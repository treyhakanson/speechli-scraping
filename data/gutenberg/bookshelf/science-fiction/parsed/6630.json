It is not the mathematics\nof astronomy, but the wonder and the mystery that seize upon the\nimagination. The calculation of an eclipse owes all its prestige to\nthe sublimity of its data; the operation, in itself, requires no more\nmental effort than the preparation of a railway time-table.\n\nThe dominion which astronomy has always held over the minds of men is\nakin to that of poetry; when the former becomes merely instructive and\nthe latter purely didactic, both lose their power over the\nimagination. Astronomy is known as the oldest of the sciences, and it\nwill be the longest-lived because it will always have arcana that have\nnot been penetrated.\n\nSome of the things described in this book are little known to the\naverage reader, while others are well known; but all possess the\nfascination of whatever is strange, marvelous, obscure, or mysterious\n-- magnified, in this case, by the portentous scale of the phenomena.\n\nThe idea of the author is to tell about these things in plain\nlanguage, but with as much scientific accuracy as plain language will\npermit, showing the wonder that is in them without getting away from\nthe facts. Most of them have hitherto been discussed only in technical\nform, and in treatises that the general public seldom sees and never\nreads.\n\nAmong the topics touched upon are:\n  * The strange unfixedness of the ``fixed stars,'' the vast\n    migrations of the suns and worlds constituting the universe.\n  * The slow passing out of existence of those collocations of stars\n    which for thousands of years have formed famous\n    ``constellations,'' preserving the memory of mythological heroes\n    and heroines, and perhaps of otherwise unrecorded history.\n  * The tendency of stars to assemble in immense clouds, swarms, and\n    clusters.\n  * The existence in some of the richest regions of the universe of\n    absolutely black, starless gaps, deeps, or holes, as if one were\n    looking out of a window into the murkiest night.\n  * The marvelous phenomena of new, or temporary, stars, which appear\n    as suddenly as conflagrations, and often turn into something else\n    as eccentric as themselves.\n  * The amazing forms of the ``whirlpool,'' ``spiral,'' ``pinwheel,''\n    and ``lace,'' or ``tress,'' nebul\u00e6.\n  * The strange surroundings of the sun, only seen in particular\n    circumstances, but evidently playing a constant part in the daily\n    phenomena of the solar system.\n  * The mystery of the Zodiacal Light and the Gegenschein.\n  * The extraordinary transformations undergone by comets and their\n    tails.\n  * The prodigies of meteorites and masses of stone and metal fallen\n    from the sky.\n  * The cataclysms that have wrecked the moon.\n  * The problem of life and intelligence on the planet Mars.\n  * The problematical origin and fate of the asteroids.\n  * The strange phenomena of the auroral lights.\n\nAn attempt has been made to develop these topics in an orderly way,\nshowing their connection, so that the reader may obtain a broad\ngeneral view of the chief mysteries and problems of astronomy, and an\nidea of the immense field of discovery which still lies, almost\nunexplored, before it.\n\nThe Windows of Absolute Night\n\nTo most minds mystery is more fascinating than science. But when\nscience itself leads straight up to the borders of mystery and there\ncomes to a dead stop, saying, ``At present I can no longer see my\nway,'' the force of the charm is redoubled. On the other hand, the\nillimitable is no less potent in mystery than the invisible, whence\nthe dramatic effect of Keats' ``stout Cortez'' staring at the\nboundless Pacific while all his men look at each other with a wild\nsurmise, ``silent upon a peak in Darien.'' It is with similar feelings\nthat the astronomer regards certain places where from the peaks of the\nuniverse his vision seems to range out into endless empty space. He\nsees there the shore of his little isthmus, and, beyond, unexplored\nimmensity.\n\nThe name, ``coal-sacks,'' given to these strange voids is hardly\ndescriptive. Rather they produce upon the mind the effect of blank\nwindows in a lonely house on a pitch-dark night, which, when looked at\nfrom the brilliant interior, become appalling in their rayless murk.\nInfinity seems to acquire a new meaning in the presence of these black\nopenings in the sky, for as one continues to gaze it loses its purely\nmetaphysical quality and becomes a kind of entity, like the ocean. The\nobserver is conscious that he can actually see the beginning of its\nebon depths, in which the visible universe appears to float like an\nenchanted island, resplendent within with lights and life and gorgeous\nspectacles, and encircled with screens of crowded stars, but with its\ndazzling vistas ending at the fathomless sea of pure darkness which\nencloses all.\n\nThe Galaxy, or Milky Way, surrounds the borders of our island in space\nlike a stellar garland, and when openings appear in it they are, by\ncontrast, far more impressive than the general darkness of the\ninterstellar expanse seen in other directions. Yet even that expanse\nis not everywhere equally dark, for it contains gloomy deeps\ndiscernable with careful watching. Here, too, contrast plays an\nimportant part, though less striking than within the galactic region.\nSome of Sir William Herschel's observations appear to indicate an\nassociation between these tenebrious spots and neighboring star clouds\nand nebul\u00e6. It is an illuminating bit of astronomical history that\nwhen he was sweeping the then virgin heavens with his great telescopes\nhe was accustomed to say to his sister who, note-book in hand, waited\nat his side to take down his words, fresh with the inspiration of\ndiscovery: ``Prepare to write; the nebul\u00e6 are coming; here space is\nvacant.''\n\nThe most famous of the ``coal-sacks,'' and the first to be brought to\ngeneral attention before astronomers had awakened to the significance\nof such things, lies adjacent to the ``Southern Cross,'' and is truly\nan amazing phenomenon. It is not alone the conspicuousness of this\ncelestial vacancy, opening suddenly in the midst of one of the richest\nparts of the Galaxy, that has given it its fame, but quite as much the\nsuperstitious awe with which it was regarded by the early explorers of\nthe South Seas. To them, as well as to those who listened in rapt\nwonder to their tales, the ``Coal-sack'' seemed to possess some occult\nconnection with the mystic ``Cross.'' In the eyes of the sailors it\nwas not a vacancy so much as a sable reality in the sky, and as,\nshuddering, they stared at it, they piously crossed themselves. It was\nanother of the magical wonders of the unknown South, and as such it\nformed the basis of many a ``wild surmise'' and many a sea-dog's yarn.\nScientific investigation has not diminished its prestige, and today no\ntraveler in the southern hemisphere is indifferent to its fascinating\nstrangeness, while some find it the most impressive spectacle of the\nantarctic heavens.\n\nAll around, up to the very edge of the yawning gap, the sheen of the\nMilky Way is surpassingly glorious; but there, as if in obedience to\nan almighty edict, everything vanishes. A single faint star is visible\nwithin the opening, producing a curious effect upon the sensitive\nspectator, like the sight of a tiny islet in the midst of a black,\nmotionless, waveless tarn. The dimensions of the lagoon of darkness,\nwhich is oval or pear-shaped, are eight degrees by five, so that it\noccupies a space in the sky about one hundred and thirty times greater\nthan the area of the full moon. It attracts attention as soon as the\neye is directed toward the quarter where it exists, and by virtue of\nthe rarity of such phenomena it appears a far greater wonder than the\ndrifts of stars that are heaped around it. Now that observatories are\nmultiplying in the southern hemisphere, the great austral\n``Coal-sack'' will, no doubt, receive attention proportioned to its\nimportance as one of the most significant features of the sky. Already\nat the Sydney Observatory photographs have shown that the southern\nportion of this Dead Sea of Space is not quite ``bottomless,''\nalthough its northern part defies the longest sounding lines of the\nastronomer.\n\nThere is a similar, but less perfect, ``coal-sack'' in the northern\nhemisphere, in the constellation of ``The Swan,'' which, strange to\nsay, also contains a well-marked figure of a cross outlined by stars.\nThis gap lies near the top of the cross-shaped figure. It is best seen\nby averted vision, which brings out the contrast with the Milky Way,\nwhich is quite brilliant around it. It does not, however, exercise the\nsame weird attraction upon the eye as the southern ``Coal-sack,'' for\ninstead of looking like an absolute void in the sky, it rather appears\nas if a canopy of dark gauze had been drawn over the stars. We shall\nsee the possible significance of this appearance later.\n\nJust above the southern horizon of our northern middle latitudes, in\nsummer, where the Milky Way breaks up into vast sheets of nebulous\nluminosity, lying over and between the constellations Scorpio and\nSagittarius, there is a remarkable assemblage of ``coal-sacks,''\nthough none is of great size. One of them, near a conspicuous\nstar-cluster in Scorpio, M80, is interesting for having been the first\nof these strange objects noted by Herschel. Probably it was its\nnearness to M80 which suggested to his mind the apparent connection of\nsuch vacancies with star-clusters which we have already mentioned.\n\nBut the most marvelous of the ``coal-sacks'' are those that have been\nfound by photography in Sagittarius. One of Barnard's earliest and\nmost excellent photographs includes two of them, both in the\nstar-cluster M8. The larger, which is roughly rectangular in outline,\ncontains one little star, and its smaller neighbor is lune-shaped --\nsurely a most singular form for such an object. Both are associated\nwith curious dark lanes running through the clustered stars like\ntrails in the woods. Along the borders of these lanes the stars are\nranked in parallel rows, and what may be called the bottoms of the\nlanes are not entirely dark, but pebbled with faint stellar points.\nOne of them which skirts the two dark gaps and traverses the cluster\nalong its greatest diameter is edged with lines of stars, recalling\nthe alignment of the trees bordering a French highway. This road of\nstars cannot be less than many billions of miles in length!\n\nAll about the cluster the bed of the Galaxy is strangely disturbed,\nand in places nearly denuded, as if its contents had been raked away\nto form the immense stack and the smaller accumulations of stars\naround it. The well-known ``Trifid Nebula'' is also included in the\nfield of the photograph, which covers a truly marvelous region, so\nintricate in its mingling of nebul\u00e6, star-clusters, star-swarms,\nstar-streams, and dark vacancies that no description can do it\njustice. Yet, chaotic as it appears, there is an unmistakable\nsuggestion of unity about it, impressing the beholder with the idea\nthat all the different parts are in some way connected, and have not\nbeen fortuitously thrown together. Miss Agnes M. Clerke made the\nstriking remark that the dusky lanes in M8 are exemplified on the\nlargest scale in the great rift dividing the Milky Way, from Cygnus in\nthe northern hemisphere all the way to the ``Cross'' in the southern.\nSimilar lanes are found in many other clusters, and they are generally\nassociated with flanking rows of stars, resembling in their\narrangement the thick-set houses and villas along the roadways that\ntraverse the approaches to a great city.\n\nBut to return to the black gaps. Are they really windows in the\nstar-walls of the universe? Some of them look rather as if they had\nbeen made by a shell fired through a luminous target, allowing the eye\nto range through the hole into the void space beyond. If science is\ndiscretely silent about these things, what can the more venturesome\nand less responsible imagination suggest? Would a huge ``runaway\nsun,'' like Arcturus, for instance, make such an opening if it should\npass like a projectile through the Milky Way? It is at least a\nstimulating inquiry. Being probably many thousands of times more\nmassive than the galactic stars, such a stellar missile would not be\nstopped by them, though its direction of flight might be altered. It\nwould drag the small stars lying close to its course out of their\nspheres, but the ultimate tendency of its attraction would be to sweep\nthem round in its wake, thus producing rather a star-swarm than a\nvacancy. Those that were very close to it might be swept away in its\nrush and become its satellites, careering away with it in its flight\ninto outer space; but those that were farther off, and they would, of\ncourse, greatly outnumber the nearer ones, would tend inward from all\nsides toward the line of flight, as dust and leaves collect behind a\nspeeding motor (though the forces operating would be different), and\nwould fill up the hole, if hole it were. A swarm thus collected should\nbe rounded in outline and bordered with a relatively barren ring from\nwhich the stars had been ``sucked'' away. In a general sense the M8\ncluster answers to this description, but even if we undertook to\naccount for its existence by a supposition like the above, the black\ngaps would remain unexplained, unless one could make a further draft\non the imagination and suggest that the stars had been thrown into a\nvast eddy, or system of eddies, whose vortices appear as dark holes.\nOnly a maelstrom-like motion could keep such a funnel open, for\nwithout regard to the impulse derived from the projectile, the proper\nmotions of the stars themselves would tend to fill it. Perhaps some\nother cause of the whirling motion may be found. As we shall see when\nwe come to the spiral nebul\u00e6, gyratory movements are exceedingly\nprevalent throughout the universe, and the structure of the Milky Way\nis everywhere suggestive of them. But this is hazardous sport even for\nthe imagination -- to play with suns as if they were but thistle-down\nin the wind or corks in a mill-race.\n\nAnother question arises: What is the thickness of the hedge of stars\nthrough which the holes penetrate? Is the depth of the openings\nproportionate to their width? In other words, is the Milky Way round\nin section like a rope, or flat and thin like a ribbon? The answer is\nnot obvious, for we have little or no information concerning the\nrelative distances of the faint galactic stars. It would be easier,\ncertainly, to conceive of openings in a thin belt than in a massive\nring, for in the first case they would resemble mere rifts and breaks,\nwhile in the second they would be like wells or bore-holes. Then, too,\nthe fact that the Milky Way is not a continuous body but is made up of\nstars whose actual distances apart is great, offers another quandary;\npersistent and sharply bordered apertures in such an assemblage are a\npriori as improbable, if not impossible, as straight, narrow holes\nrunning through a swarm of bees.\n\nThe difficulty of these questions indicates one of the reasons why it\nhas been suggested that the seeming gaps, or many of them, are not\nopenings at all, but opaque screens cutting off the light from stars\nbehind them. That this is quite possible in some cases is shown by\nBarnard's later photographs, particularly those of the singular region\naround the star Rho Ophiuchi. Here are to be seen somber lanes and\npatches, apparently forming a connected system which covers an immense\nspace, and which their discoverer thinks may constitute a ``dark\nnebula.'' This seems at first a startling suggestion; but, after all,\nwhy should their not be dark nebul\u00e6 as well as visible ones? In truth,\nit has troubled some astronomers to explain the luminosity of the\nbright nebul\u00e6, since it is not to be supposed that matter in so\ndiffuse a state can be incandescent through heat, and phosphorescent\nlight is in itself a mystery. The supposition is also in accord with\nwhat we know of the existence of dark solid bodies in space. Many\nbright stars are accompanied by obscure companions, sometimes as\nmassive as themselves; the planets are non-luminous; the same is true\nof meteors before they plunge into the atmosphere and become heated by\nfriction; and many plausible reasons have been found for believing\nthat space contains as many obscure as shining bodies of great size.\nIt is not so difficult, after all, then, to believe that there are\nimmense collections of shadowy gases and meteoric dust whose presence\nis only manifested when they intercept the light coming from shining\nbodies behind them.\n\nThis would account for the apparent extinguishment of light in open\nspace, which is indicated by the falling off in relative number of\ntelescopic stars below the tenth magnitude. Even as things are, the\namount of light coming to us from stars too faint to be seen with the\nnaked eye is so great that the statement of it generally surprises\npersons who are unfamiliar with the inner facts of astronomy. It has\nbeen calculated that on a clear night the total starlight from the\nentire celestial sphere amounts to one-sixtieth of the light of the\nfull moon; but of this less than one-twenty-fifth is due to stars\nseparately distinguished by the eye. If there were no obscuring medium\nin space, it is probable that the amount of starlight would be\nnoticeably and perhaps enormously increased.\n\nBut while it seems certain that some of the obscure spots in the Milky\nWay are due to the presence of ``dark nebul\u00e6,'' or concealing veils of\none kind or another, it is equally certain that there are many which\nare true apertures, however they may have been formed, and by whatever\nforces they may be maintained. These, then, are veritable windows of\nthe Galaxy, and when looking out of them one is face to face with the\ngreat mystery of infinite space. There the known universe visibly\nends, but manifestly space itself does not end there. It is not within\nthe power of thought to conceive an end to space, for the instant we\nthink of a terminal point or line the mind leaps forward to the\nbeyond. There must be space outside as well as inside. Eternity of\ntime and infinity of space are ideas that the intellect cannot fully\ngrasp, but neither can it grasp the idea of a limitation to either\nspace or time. The metaphysical conceptions of hypergeometry, or\nfourth-dimensional space, do not aid us.\n\nHaving, then, discovered that the universe is a thing contained in\nsomething indefinitely greater than itself; having looked out of its\nwindows and found only the gloom of starless night outside -- what\nconclusions are we to draw concerning the beyond? It seems as empty as\na vacuum, but is it really so? If it be, then our universe is a single\natom astray in the infinite; it is the only island in an ocean without\nshores; it is the one oasis in an illimitable desert. Then the Milky\nWay, with its wide-flung garland of stars, is afloat like a tiny\nsmoke-wreath amid a horror of immeasurable vacancy, or it is an\nevanescent and solitary ring of sparkling froth cast up for a moment\non the viewless billows of immensity. From such conclusions the mind\ninstinctively shrinks. It prefers to think that there is something\nbeyond, though we cannot see it. Even the universe could not bear to\nbe alone -- a Crusoe lost in the Cosmos! As the inhabitants of the\nmost elegant ch\u00e2teau, with its gardens, parks, and crowds of\nattendants, would die of loneliness if they did not know that they\nhave neighbors, though not seen, and that a living world of indefinite\nextent surrounds them, so we, when we perceive that the universe has\nlimits, wish to feel that it is not solitary; that beyond the hedges\nand the hills there are other centers of life and activity. Could\nanything be more terrible than the thought of an isolated universe?\nThe greater the being, the greater the aversion to seclusion. Only the\ninfinite satisfies; in that alone the mind finds rest.\n\nWe are driven, then, to believe that the universal night which\nenvelopes us is not tenantless; that as we stare out of the\nstar-framed windows of the Galaxy and see nothing but uniform\nblackness, the fault is with our eyes or is due to an obscuring\nmedium. Since our universe is limited in extent, there must be other\nuniverses beyond it on all sides. Perhaps if we could carry our\ntelescopes to the verge of the great ``Coal-sack'' near the ``Cross,''\nbeing then on the frontier of our starry system, we could discern,\nsparkling afar off in the vast night, some of the outer galaxies. They\nmay be grander than ours, just as many of the suns surrounding us are\nimmensely greater than ours. If we could take our stand somewhere in\nthe midst of immensity and, with vision of infinite reach, look about\nus, we should perhaps see a countless number of stellar systems, amid\nwhich ours would be unnoticeable, like a single star among the\nmultitude glittering in the terrestial sky on a clear night. Some\nmight be in the form of a wreath, like our own; some might be\nglobular, like the great star-clusters in Hercules and Centaurus; some\nmight be glittering circles, or disks, or rings within rings. If we\ncould enter them we should probably find a vast variety of\ncomposition, including elements unknown to terrestrial chemistry; for\nwhile the visible universe appears to contain few if any substances\nnot existing on the earth or in the sun, we have no warrant to assume\nthat others may not exist in infinite space.\n\nAnd how as to gravitation? We do not know that gravitation acts beyond\nthe visible universe, but it is reasonable to suppose that it does. At\nany rate, if we let go its sustaining hand we are lost, and can only\nwander hopelessly in our speculations, like children astray. If the\nempire of gravitation is infinite, then the various outer systems must\nhave some, though measuring by our standards an imperceptible,\nattractive influence upon each other, for gravitation never lets go\nits hold, however great the space over which it is required to act.\nJust as the stars about us are all in motion, so the starry systems\nbeyond our sight may be in motion, and our system as a whole may be\nmoving in concert with them. If this be so, then after interminable\nages the aspect of the entire system of systems must change, its\nvarious members assuming new positions with respect to one another. In\nthe course of time we may even suppose that our universe will approach\nrelatively close to one of the others; and then, if men are yet living\non the earth, they may glimpse through the openings which reveal\nnothing to us now, the lights of another nearing star system, like the\nsignals of a strange squadron, bringing them the assurance (which can\nbe but an inference at present) that the ocean of space has other\nargosies venturing on its limitless expanse.\n\nThere remains the question of the luminiferous ether by whose agency\nthe waves of light are borne through space. The ether is as mysterious\nas gravitation. With regard to ether we only infer its existence from\nthe effects which we ascribe to it. Evidently the ether must extend as\nfar as the most distant visible stars. But does it continue on\nindefinitely in outer space? If it does, then the invisibility of the\nother systems must be due to their distance diminishing the quantity\nof light that comes from them below the limit of perceptibility, or to\nthe interposition of absorbing media; if it does not, then the reason\nwhy we cannot see them is owing to the absence of a means of\nconveyance for the light waves, as the lack of an interplanetary\natmosphere prevents us from hearing the thunder of sun-spots. (It is\ninteresting to recall that Mr Edison was once credited with the\nintention to construct a gigantic microphone which should render the\nroar of sun-spots audible by transforming the electric vibrations into\nsound-waves). On this supposition each starry system would be\nenveloped in its own globule of ether, and no light could cross from\none to another. But the probability is that both the ether and\ngravitation are ubiquitous, and that all the stellar systems are\nimmersed in the former like clouds of phosphorescent organisms in the\nsea.\n\nSo astronomy carries the mind from height to greater height. Men were\nlong in accepting the proofs of the relative insignificance of the\nearth; they were more quickly convinced of the comparative littleness\nof the solar system; and now the evidence assails their reason that\nwhat they had regarded as the universe is only one mote gleaming in\nthe sunbeams of Infinity.\n\nStar-Clouds, Star-Clusters, and Star-Streams\n\nIn the preceding chapter we have seen something of the strangely\ncomplicated structure of the Galaxy, or Milky Way. We now proceed to\nstudy more comprehensively that garlanded ``Pathway of the Gods.''\n\nJudged by the eye alone, the Milky Way is one of the most delicately\nbeautiful phenomena in the entire realm of nature -- a shimmer of\nsilvery gauze stretched across the sky; but studied in the light of\nits revelations, it is the most stupendous object presented to human\nken. Let us consider, first, its appearance to ordinary vision. Its\napparent position in the sky shifts according to the season. On a\nserene, cloudless summer evening, in the absence of the moon, whose\nlight obscures it, one sees the Galaxy spanning the heavens from north\nto southeast of the zenith like a phosphorescent arch. In early spring\nit forms a similar but, upon the whole, less brilliant arch west of\nthe zenith. Between spring and summer it lies like a long, faint,\ntwilight band along the northern horizon. At the beginning of winter\nit again forms an arch, this time spanning the sky from east to west,\na little north of the zenith. These are its positions as viewed from\nthe mean latitude of the United States. Even the beginner in\nstar-gazing does not have to watch it throughout the year in order to\nbe convinced that it is, in reality, a great circle, extending\nentirely around the celestial sphere. We appear to be situated near\nits center, but its periphery is evidently far away in the depths of\nspace.\n\nAlthough to the casual observer it seems but a delicate scarf of\nlight, brighter in some places than in others, but hazy and indefinite\nat the best, such is not its appearance to those who study it with\ncare. They perceive that it is an organic whole, though marvelously\ncomplex in detail. The telescope shows that it consists of stars too\nfaint and small through excess of distance to be separately visible.\nOf the hundred million suns which some estimates have fixed as the\nprobable population of the starry universe, the vast majority (at\nleast thirty to one) are included in this strange belt of misty light.\nBut they are not uniformly distributed in it; on the contrary, they\nare arrayed in clusters, knots, bunches, clouds, and streams. The\nappearance is somewhat as if the Galaxy consisted of innumerable\nswarms of silver-winged bees, more or less intermixed, some massed\ntogether, some crossing the paths of others, but all governed by a\nsingle purpose which leads them to encircle the region of space in\nwhich we are situated.\n\nFrom the beginning of the systematic study of the heavens, the fact\nhas been recognized that the form of the Milky Way denotes the scheme\nof the sidereal system. At first it was thought that the shape of the\nsystem was that of a vast round disk, flat like a cheese, and filled\nwith stars, our sun and his relatively few neighbors being placed near\nthe center. According to this view, the galactic belt was an effect of\nperspective; for when looking in the direction of the plane of the\ndisk, the eye ranged through an immense extension of stars which\nblended into a glimmering blur, surrounding us like a ring; while when\nlooking out from the sides of the disk we saw but few stars, and in\nthose directions the heavens appeared relatively blank. Finally it was\nrecognized that this theory did not correspond with the observed\nappearances, and it became evident that the Milky Way was not a mere\neffect of perspective, but an actual band of enormously distant stars,\nforming a circle about the sphere, the central opening of the ring\n(containing many scattered stars) being many times broader than the\nwidth of the ring itself. Our sun is one of the scattered stars in the\ncentral opening.\n\nAs already remarked, the ring of the Galaxy is very irregular, and in\nplaces it is partly broken. With its sinuous outline, its pendant\nsprays, its graceful and accordant curves, its bunching of masses, its\noccasional interstices, and the manifest order of a general plan\ngoverning the jumble of its details, it bears a remarkable resemblance\nto a garland -- a fact which appears the more wonderful when we recall\nits composition. That an elm-tree should trace the lines of beauty\nwith its leafy and pendulous branches does not surprise us; but we can\nonly gaze with growing amazement when we behold a hundred million suns\nimitating the form of a chaplet! And then we have to remember that\nthis form furnishes the ground-plan of the universe.\n\nAs an indication of the extraordinary speculations to which the\nmystery of the Milky Way has given rise, a theory recently (1909)\nproposed by Prof. George C. Comstock may be mentioned. Starting with\nthe data (first) that the number of stars increases as the Milky Way\nis approached, and reaches a maximum in its plane, while on the other\nhand the number of nebul\u00e6 is greatest outside the Milky Way and\nincreases with distance from it, and (second) that the Milky Way,\nalthough a complete ring, is broad and diffuse on one side through\none-half its course -- that half alone containing nebul\u00e6 -- and\nrelatively narrow and well defined on the opposite side, the author of\nthis singular speculation avers that these facts can best be explained\nby supposing that the invisible universe consists of two\ninterpenetrating parts, one of which is a chaos of indefinite extent,\nstrewn with stars and nebulous dust, and the other a long, broad but\ncomparatively thin cluster of stars, including the sun as one of its\ncentral members. This flat star-cluster is conceived to be moving\nedgewise through the chaos, and, according to Professor Comstock, it\nacts after the manner of a snow-plough sweeping away the cosmic dust\nand piling it on either hand above and below the plane of the moving\ncluster. It thus forms a transparent rift, through which we see\nfarther and command a view of more stars than through the intensified\ndust-clouds on either hand. This rift is the Milky Way. The dust\nthrown aside toward the poles of the Milky Way is the substance of the\nnebul\u00e6 which abound there. Ahead, where the front of the star-plough\nis clearing the way, the chaos is nearer at hand, and consequently\nthere the rift subtends a broader angle, and is filled with primordial\ndust, which, having been annexed by the vanguard of the star-swarm,\nforms the nebul\u00e6 seen only in that part of the Milky Way. But behind,\nthe rift appears narrow because there we look farther away between\ndust-clouds produced ages ago by the front of the plough, and no\nscattered dust remains in that part of the rift.\n\nIn quoting an outline of this strikingly original theory the present\nwriter should not be understood as assenting to it. That it appears\nbizarre is not, in itself, a reason for rejecting it, when we are\ndealing with so problematical and enigmatical a subject as the Milky\nWay; but the serious objection is that the theory does not\nsufficiently accord with the observed phenomena. There is too much\nevidence that the Milky Way is an organic system, however fantastic\nits form, to permit the belief that it can only be a rift in chaotic\nclouds. As with every organism, we find that its parts are more or\nless clearly repeated in its ensemble. Among all the strange things\nthat the Milky Way contains there is nothing so extraordinary as\nitself. Every astronomer must many times have found himself marveling\nat it in those comparatively rare nights when it shows all its beauty\nand all its strangeness. In its great broken rifts, divisions, and\nspirals are found the gigantic prototypes of similar forms in its\nstar-clouds and clusters. As we have said, it determines the general\nshape of the whole sidereal system. Some of the brightest stars in the\nsky appear to hang like jewels suspended at the ends of tassels\ndropped from the Galaxy. Among these pendants are the Pleiades and the\nHyades. Orion, too, the ``Mighty Hunter,'' is caught in ``a loop of\nlight'' thrown out from it. The majority of the great first-magnitude\nstars seem related to it, as if they formed an inner ring inclined at\nan angle of some twenty degrees to its plane. Many of the long curves\nthat set off from it on both sides are accompanied by corresponding\ncurves of lucid stars. In a word, it offers every appearance of\nstructural connection with the entire starry system. That the universe\nshould have assumed the form of a wreath is certainly a matter for\nastonishment; but it would have been still more astonishing if it had\nbeen a cube, a rhomboid, or a dodecahedron, for then we should have\nhad to suppose that something resembling the forces that shape\ncrystals had acted upon the stars, and the difficulty of explaining\nthe universe by the laws of gravitation would have been increased.\n\nFrom the Milky Way as a whole we pass to the vast clouds, swarms, and\nclusters of stars of which it is made up. It may be, as some\nastronomers hold, that most of the galactic stars are much smaller\nthan the sun, so that their faintness is not due entirely to the\neffect of distance. Still, their intrinsic brilliance attests their\nsolar character, and considering their remoteness, which has been\nestimated at not less than ten thousand to twenty thousand light-years\n(a light-year is equal to nearly six thousand thousand million miles)\ntheir actual masses cannot be extremely small. The minutest of them\nare entitled to be regarded as real suns, and they vary enormously in\nmagnitude. The effects of their attractions upon one another can only\nbe inferred from their clustering, because their relative movements\nare not apparent on account of the brevity of the observations that we\ncan make. But imagine a being for whom a million years would be but as\na flitting moment; to him the Milky Way would appear in a state of\nceaseless agitation -- swirling with ``a fury of whirlpool motion.''\n\nThe cloud-like aspect of large parts of the Galaxy must always have\nattracted attention, even from naked-eye observers, but the true\nstar-clouds were first satisfactorily represented in Barnard's\nphotographs. The resemblance to actual clouds is often startling. Some\nare close-packed and dense, like cumuli; some are wispy or mottled,\nlike cirri. The rifts and modulations, as well as the general\noutlines, are the same as those of clouds of vapor or dust, and one\nnotices also the characteristic thinning out at the edges. But we must\nbeware of supposing that the component suns are thickly crowded as the\nparticles forming an ordinary cloud. They look, indeed, as if they\nwere matted together, because of the irradiation of light, but in\nreality millions and billions of miles separate each star from its\nneighbors. Nevertheless they form real assemblages, whose members are\nfar more closely related to one another than is our sun to the stars\naround him, and if we were in the Milky Way the aspect of the\nnocturnal sky would be marvelously different from its present\nappearance.\n\nStellar clouds are characteristic of the Galaxy and are not found\nbeyond its borders, except in the ``Magellanic Clouds'' of the\nsouthern hemisphere, which resemble detached portions of the Milky\nWay. These singular objects form as striking a peculiarity of the\naustral heavens as does the great ``Coal-sack'' described in Chapter\n1. But it is their isolation that makes them so remarkable, for their\ncomposition is essentially galactic, and if they were included within\nits boundaries they would not appear more wonderful than many other\nparts of the Milky Way. Placed where they are, they look like masses\nfallen from the great stellar arch. They are full of nebul\u00e6 and\nstar-clusters, and show striking evidences of spiral movement.\n\nStar-swarms, which are also characteristic features of the Galaxy,\ndiffer from star-clouds very much in the way that their name would\nimply -- i.e., their component stars are so arranged, even when they\nare countless in number, that the idea of an exceedingly numerous\nassemblage rather than that of a cloud is impressed on the observer's\nmind. In a star-swarm the separate members are distinguishable because\nthey are either larger or nearer than the stars composing a ``cloud.''\nA splendid example of a true star-swarm is furnished by Chi Persei, in\nthat part of the Milky Way which runs between the constellations\nPerseus and Cassiopeia. This swarm is much coarser than many others,\nand can be seen by the naked eye. In a small telescope it appears\ndouble, as if the suns composing it had divided into two parties which\nkeep on their way side by side, with some commingling of their members\nwhere the skirts of the two companies come in contact.\n\nSmaller than either star-clouds or star-swarms, and differing from\nboth in their organization, are star-clusters. These, unlike the\nothers, are found outside as well as inside the Milky Way, although\nthey are more numerous inside its boundaries than elsewhere. The term\nstar-cluster is sometimes applied, though improperly, to assemblages\nwhich are rather groups, such, for instance, as the Pleiades. In their\nmost characteristic aspect star-clusters are of a globular shape --\nglobes of suns! A famous example of a globular star-cluster, but one\nnot included in the Milky Way, is the ``Great Cluster in Hercules.''\nThis is barely visible to the naked eye, but a small telescope shows\nits character, and in a large one it presents a marvelous spectacle.\nPhotographs of such clusters are, perhaps, less effective than those\nof star-clouds, because the central condensation of stars in them is\nso great that their light becomes blended in an indistinguishable\nblur. The beautiful effect of the incessant play of infinitesimal rays\nover the apparently compact surface of the cluster, as if it were a\nglobe of the finest frosted silver shining in an electric beam, is\nalso lost in a photograph. Still, even to the eye looking directly at\nthe cluster through a powerful telescope, the central part of the\nwonderful congregation seems almost a solid mass in which the stars\nare packed like the ice crystals in a snowball.\n\nThe same question rises to the lips of every observer: How can they\npossibly have been brought into such a situation? The marvel does not\ngrow less when we know that, instead of being closely compacted, the\nstars of the cluster are probably separated by millions of miles; for\nwe know that their distances apart are slight as compared with their\nremoteness from the Earth. Sir William Herschel estimated their number\nto be about fourteen thousand, but in fact they are uncountable. If we\ncould view them from a point just within the edge of the assemblage,\nthey would offer the appearance of a hollow hemisphere emblazoned with\nstars of astonishing brilliancy; the near-by ones unparalleled in\nsplendor by any celestial object known to us, while the more distant\nones would resemble ordinary stars. An inhabitant of the cluster would\nnot know, except by a process of ratiocination, that he was dwelling\nin a globular assemblage of suns; only from a point far outside would\ntheir spherical arrangement become evident to the eye. Imagine\nfourteen-thousand fire-balloons with an approach to regularity in a\nspherical space -- say, ten miles in diameter; there would be an\naverage of less than thirty in every cubic mile, and it would be\nnecessary to go to a considerable distance in order to see them as a\nglobular aggregation; yet from a point sufficiently far away they\nwould blend into a glowing ball.\n\nPhotographs show even better than the best telescopic views that the\ngreat cluster is surrounded with a multitude of dispersed stars,\nsuggestively arrayed in more or less curving lines, which radiate from\nthe principle mass, with which their connection is manifest. These\nstars, situated outside the central sphere, look somewhat like vagrant\nbees buzzing round a dense swarm where the queen bee is sitting. Yet\nwhile there is so much to suggest the operation of central forces,\nbringing and keeping the members of the cluster together, the\nattentive observer is also impressed with the idea that the whole\nwonderful phenomenon may be the result of explosion. As soon as this\nthought seizes the mind, confirmation of it seems to be found in the\nappearance of the outlying stars, which could be as readily explained\nby the supposition that they have been blown apart as that they have\nflocked together toward a center. The probable fact that the stars\nconstituting the cluster are very much smaller than our sun might be\nregarded as favoring the hypothesis of an explosion. Of their real\nsize we know nothing, but, on the basis of an uncertain estimate of\ntheir parallax, it has been calculated that they may average\nforty-five thousand miles in diameter -- something more than half the\ndiameter of the planet Jupiter. Assuming the same mean density,\nfourteen thousand such stars might have been formed by the explosion\nof a body about twice the size of the sun. This recalls the theory of\nOlbers, which has never been altogether abandoned or disproved, that\nthe Asteroids were formed by the explosion of a planet circulating\nbetween the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The Asteroids, whatever their\nmanner of origin, form a ring around the sun; but, of course, the\nexplosion of a great independent body, not originally revolving about\na superior center of gravitational force, would not result in the\nformation of a ring of small bodies, but rather of a dispersed mass of\nthem. But back of any speculation of this kind lies the problem, at\npresent insoluble: How could the explosion be produced? (See the\nquestion of explosions in Chapters 6 and 14).\n\nThen, on the other hand, we have the observation of Herschel, since\nabundantly confirmed, that space is unusually vacant in the immediate\nneighborhood of condensed star-clusters and nebul\u00e6, which, as far as\nit goes, might be taken as an indication that the assembled stars had\nbeen drawn together by their mutual attractions, and that the tendency\nto aggregation is still bringing new members toward the cluster. But\nin that case there must have been an original condensation of stars at\nthat point in space. This could probably have been produced by the\ncoagulation of a great nebula into stellar nuclei, a process which\nseems now to be taking place in the Orion Nebula.\n\nA yet more remarkable globular star-cluster exists in the southern\nhemisphere, Omega Centauri. In this case the central condensation of\nstars presents an almost uniform blaze of light. Like the Hercules\ncluster, that in Centaurus is surrounded with stars scattered over a\nbroad field and showing an appearance of radial arrangement. In fact,\nexcept for its greater richness, Omega Centauri is an exact duplicate\nof its northern rival. Each appears to an imaginative spectator as a\nveritable ``city of suns.'' Mathematics shrinks from the task of\ndisentangling the maze of motions in such an assemblage. It would seem\nthat the chance of collisions is not to be neglected, and this idea\nfinds a certain degree of confirmation in the appearance of\n``temporary stars'' which have more than once blazed out in, or close\nby, globular star-clusters.\n\nThis leads up to the notable fact, first established by Professor\nBailey a few years ago, that such clusters are populous with variable\nstars. Omega Centauri and the Hercules cluster are especially\nremarkable in this respect. The variables found in them are all of\nshort period and the changes of light show a noteworthy tendency to\nuniformity. The first thought is that these phenomena must be due to\ncollisions among the crowded stars, but, if so, the encounters cannot\nbe between the stars themselves, but probably between stars and meteor\nswarms revolving around them. Such periodic collisions might go on for\nages without the meteors being exhausted by incorporation with the\nstars. This explanation appears all the more probable because one\nwould naturally expect that flocks of meteors would abound in a close\naggregation of stars. It is also consistent with Perrine's discovery\n-- that the globular star clusters are powdered with minute stars\nstrewn thickly among the brighter ones.\n\nIn speaking of Professor Comstock's extraordinary theory of the Milky\nWay, the fact was mentioned that, broadly speaking, the nebul\u00e6 are\nless numerous in the galactic belt than in the comparatively open\nspaces on either side of it, but that they are, nevertheless, abundant\nin the broader half of the Milky Way which he designates as the front\nof the gigantic ``plough'' supposed to be forcing its way through the\nenveloping chaos. In and around the Sagittarius region the\nintermingling of nebul\u00e6 and galactic star clouds and clusters is\nparticularly remarkable. That there is a causal connection no\nthoughtful person can doubt. We are unable to get away from the\nevidence that a nebula is like a seed-ground from which stars spring\nforth; or we may say that nebul\u00e6 resemble clouds in whose bosom\nraindrops are forming. The wonderful aspect of the admixtures of\nnebul\u00e6 and star-clusters in Sagittarius has been described in Chapter\n1. We now come to a still more extraordinary phenomenon of this kind\n-- the Pleiades nebul\u00e6.\n\nThe group of the Pleiades, although lying outside the main course of\nthe Galaxy, is connected with it by a faint loop, and is the scene of\nthe most remarkable association of stars and nebulous matter known in\nthe visible universe. The naked eye is unaware of the existence of\nnebul\u00e6 in the Pleiades, or, at the best, merely suspects that there is\nsomething of the kind there; and even the most powerful telescopes are\nfar from revealing the full wonder of the spectacle; but in\nphotographs which have been exposed for many hours consecutively, in\norder to accumulate the impression of the actinic rays, the revelation\nis stunning. The principle stars are seen surrounded by, and, as it\nwere, drowned in, dense nebulous clouds of an unparalleled kind. The\nforms assumed by these clouds seem at first sight inexplicable. They\nlook like fleeces, or perhaps more like splashes and daubs of luminous\npaint dashed carelessly from a brush. But closer inspection shows that\nthey are, to a large extent, woven out of innumerable threads of filmy\ntexture, and there are many indications of spiral tendencies. Each of\nthe bright stars of the group -- Alcyone, Merope, Maia, Electra,\nTaygeta, Atlas -- is the focus of a dense fog (totally invisible,\nremember, alike to the naked eye and to the telescope), and these\nparticular stars are veiled from sight behind the strange mists.\nRunning in all directions across the relatively open spaces are\nnebulous wisps and streaks of the most curious forms. On some of the\nnebular lines, which are either straight throughout, or if they change\ndirection do so at an angle, little stars are strung like beads. In\none case seven or eight stars are thus aligned, and, as if to\nemphasize their dependence upon the chain which connects them, when it\nmakes a slight bend the file of stars turns the same way. Many other\nstar rows in the group suggest by their arrangement that they, too,\nwere once strung upon similar threads which have now disappeared,\nleaving the stars spaced along their ancient tracks. We seem forced to\nthe conclusion that there was a time when the Pleiades were embedded\nin a vast nebula resembling that of Orion, and that the cloud has now\nbecome so rare by gradual condensation into stars that the merest\ntrace of it remains, and this would probably have escaped detection\nbut for the remarkable actinic power of the radiant matter of which it\nconsists. The richness of many of these faint nebulous masses in\nultra-violet radiations, which are those that specifically affect the\nphotographic plate, is the cause of the marvelous revelatory power of\ncelestial photography. So the veritable unseen universe, as\ndistinguished from the ``unseen universe'' of metaphysical\nspeculation, is shown to us.\n\nA different kind of association between stars and nebul\u00e6 is shown in\nsome surprising photographic objects in the constellation Cygnus,\nwhere long, wispy nebul\u00e6, billions of miles in length, some of them\nlooking like tresses streaming in a breeze, lie amid fields of stars\nwhich seem related to them. But the relation is of a most singular\nkind, for notwithstanding the delicate structure of the long nebul\u00e6\nthey appear to act as barriers, causing the stars to heap themselves\non one side. The stars are two, three, or four times as numerous on\none side of the nebul\u00e6 as on the other. These nebul\u00e6, as far as\nappearance goes, might be likened to rail fences, or thin hedges,\nagainst which the wind is driving drifts of powdery snow, which, while\nscattered plentifully all around, tends to bank itself on the leeward\nside of the obstruction. The imagination is at a loss to account for\nthese extraordinary phenomena; yet there they are, faithfully giving\nus their images whenever the photographic plate is exposed to their\nradiations.\n\nThus the more we see of the universe with improved methods of\nobservation, and the more we invent aids to human senses, each\nenabling us to penetrate a little deeper into the unseen, the greater\nbecomes the mystery. The telescope carried us far, photography is\ncarrying us still farther; but what as yet unimagined instrument will\ntake us to the bottom, the top, and the end? And then, what hitherto\nuntried power of thought will enable us to comprehend the meaning of\nit all?\n\nStellar Migrations\n\nTo the untrained eye the stars and the planets are not\ndistinguishable. It is customary to call them all alike ``stars.'' But\nsince the planets more or less rapidly change their places in the sky,\nin consequence of their revolution about the sun, while the stars\nproper seem to remain always in the same relative positions, the\nlatter are spoken of as ``fixed stars.'' In the beginnings of\nastronomy it was not known that the ``fixed stars'' had any motion\nindependent of their apparent annual revolution with the whole sky\nabout the earth as a seeming center. Now, however, we know that the\nterm ``fixed stars'' is paradoxical, for there is not a single really\nfixed object in the whole celestial sphere. The apparent fixity in the\npositions of the stars is due to their immense distance, combined with\nthe shortness of the time during which we are able to observe them. It\nis like viewing the plume of smoke issuing from a steamer, hull down,\nat sea: if one does not continue to watch it for a long time it\nappears to be motionless, although in reality it may be traveling at\ngreat speed across the line of sight. Even the planets seem fixed in\nposition if one watches them for a single night only, and the more\ndistant ones do not sensibly change their places, except after many\nnights of observation. Neptune, for instance, moves but little more\nthan two degrees in the course of an entire year, and in a month its\nchange of place is only about one-third of the diameter of the full\nmoon.\n\nYet, fixed as they seem, the stars are actually moving with a speed in\ncomparison with which, in some cases, the planets might almost be said\nto stand fast in their tracks. Jupiter's speed in his orbit is about\neight miles per second, Neptune's is less than three and one-half\nmiles, and the earth's is about eighteen and one-half miles; while\nthere are ``fixed stars'' which move two hundred or three hundred\nmiles per second. They do not all, however, move with so great a\nvelocity, for some appear to travel no faster than the planets. But in\nall cases, notwithstanding their real speed, long-continued and\nexceedingly careful observations are required to demonstrate that they\nare moving at all. No more overwhelming impression of the frightful\ndepths of space in which the stars are buried can be obtained than by\nreflecting upon the fact that a star whose actual motion across the\nline of sight amounts to two hundred miles per second does not change\nits apparent place in the sky, in the course of a thousand years,\nsufficiently to be noticed by the casual observer of the heavens!\n\nThere is one vast difference between the motions of the stars and\nthose of the planets to which attention should be at once called: the\nplanets, being under the control of a central force emanating from\ntheir immediate master, the sun, all move in the same direction and in\norbits concentric about the sun; the stars, on the other hand, move in\nevery conceivable direction and have no apparent center of motion, for\nall efforts to discover such a center have failed. At one time, when\ntheology had finally to accept the facts of science, a grandiose\nconception arose in some pious minds, according to which the Throne of\nGod was situated at the exact center of His Creation, and, seated\nthere, He watched the magnificent spectacle of the starry systems\nobediently revolving around Him. Astronomical discoveries and\nspeculations seemed for a time to afford some warrant for this view,\nwhich was, moreover, an acceptable substitute for the abandoned\ngeocentric theory in minds that could only conceive of God as a\nsuperhuman artificer, constantly admiring his own work. No longer ago\nthan the middle of the nineteenth century a German astronomer,\nMaedler, believed that he had actually found the location of the\ncenter about which the stellar universe revolved. He placed it in the\ngroup of the Pleiades, and upon his authority an extraordinary\nimaginative picture was sometimes drawn of the star Alcyone, the\nbrightest of the Pleiades, as the very seat of the Almighty. This idea\neven seemed to gain a kind of traditional support from the mystic\nsignificance, without known historical origin, which has for many\nages, and among widely separated peoples, been attached to the\nremarkable group of which Alcyone is the chief. But since Maedler's\ntime it has been demonstrated that the Pleiades cannot be the center\nof revolution of the universe, and, as already remarked, all attempts\nto find or fix such a center have proved abortive. Yet so powerful was\nthe hold that the theory took upon the popular imagination, that even\ntoday astronomers are often asked if Alcyone is not the probable site\nof ``Jerusalem the Golden.''\n\nIf there were a discoverable center of predominant gravitative power,\nto which the motions of all the stars could be referred, those motions\nwould appear less mysterious, and we should then be able to conclude\nthat the universe was, as a whole, a prototype of the subsidiary\nsystems of which it is composed. We should look simply to the law of\ngravitation for an explanation, and, naturally, the center would be\nplaced within the opening enclosed by the Milky Way. If it were there\nthe Milky Way itself should exhibit signs of revolution about it, like\na wheel turning upon its hub. No theory of the star motions as a whole\ncould stand which failed to take account of the Milky Way as the basis\nof all. But the very form of that divided wreath of stars forbids the\nassumption of its revolution about a center. Even if it could be\nconceived as a wheel having no material center it would not have the\nform which it actually presents. As was shown in Chapter 2, there is\nabundant evidence of motion in the Milky Way; but it is not motion of\nthe system as a whole, but motion affecting its separate parts.\nInstead of all moving one way, the galactic stars, as far as their\nmovements can be inferred, are governed by local influences and\nconditions. They appear to travel crosswise and in contrary\ndirections, and perhaps they eddy around foci where great numbers have\nassembled; but of a universal revolution involving the entire mass we\nhave no evidence.\n\nMost of our knowledge of star motions, called ``proper motions,''\nrelates to individual stars and to a few groups which happen to be so\nnear that the effects of their movements are measurable. In some cases\nthe motion is so rapid (not in appearance, but in reality) that the\nchief difficulty is to imagine how it can have been imparted, and what\nwill eventually become of the ``runaways.'' Without a collision, or a\nseries of very close approaches to great gravitational centers, a star\ntraveling through space at the rate of two hundred or three hundred\nmiles per second could not be arrested or turned into an orbit which\nwould keep it forever flying within the limits of the visible\nuniverse. A famous example of these speeding stars is ``1830\nGroombridge,'' a star of only the sixth magnitude, and consequently\njust visible to the naked eye, whose motion across the line of sight\nis so rapid that it moves upon the face of the sky a distance equal to\nthe apparent diameter of the moon every 280 years. The distance of\nthis star is at least 200,000,000,000,000 miles, and may be two or\nthree times greater, so that its actual speed cannot be less than two\nhundred, and may be as much as four hundred, miles per second. It\ncould be turned into a new course by a close approach to a great sun,\nbut it could only be stopped by collision, head-on, with a body of\nenormous mass. Barring such accidents it must, as far as we can see,\nkeep on until it has traversed our stellar system, whence in may\nescape and pass out into space beyond, to join, perhaps, one of those\nother universes of which we have spoken. Arcturus, one of the greatest\nsuns in the universe, is also a runaway, whose speed of flight has\nbeen estimated all the way from fifty to two hundred miles per second.\nArcturus, we have every reason to believe, possesses hundreds of times\nthe mass of our sun -- think, then, of the prodigious momentum that\nits motion implies! Sirius moves more moderately, its motion across\nthe line of sight amounting to only ten miles per second, but it is at\nthe same time approaching the sun at about the same speed, its actual\nvelocity in space being the resultant of the two displacements.\n\nWhat has been said about the motion of Sirius brings us to another\naspect of this subject. The fact is, that in every case of stellar\nmotion the displacement that we observe represents only a part of the\nactual movement of the star concerned. There are stars whose motion\ncarries them straight toward or straight away from the earth, and such\nstars, of course, show no cross motion. But the vast majority are\ntraveling in paths inclined from a perpendicular to our line of sight.\nTaken as a whole, the stars may be said to be flying about like the\nmolecules in a mass of gas. The discovery of the radial component in\nthe movements of the stars is due to the spectroscope. If a star is\napproaching, its spectral lines are shifted toward the violet end of\nthe spectrum by an amount depending upon the velocity of approach; if\nit is receding, the lines are correspondingly shifted toward the red\nend. Spectroscopic observation, then, combined with micrometric\nmeasurements of the cross motion, enables us to detect the real\nmovement of the star in space. Sometimes it happens that a star's\nradial movement is periodically reversed; first it approaches, and\nthen it recedes. This indicates that it is revolving around a near-by\ncompanion, which is often invisible, and superposed upon this motion\nis that of the two stars concerned, which together may be approaching\nor receding or traveling across the line of sight. Thus the\ncomplications involved in the stellar motions are often exceedingly\ngreat and puzzling.\n\nYet another source of complication exists in the movement of our own\nstar, the sun. There is no more difficult problem in astronomy than\nthat of disentangling the effects of the solar motion from those of\nthe motions of the other stars. But the problem, difficult as it is,\nhas been solved, and upon its solution depends our knowledge of the\nspeed and direction of the movement of the solar system through space,\nfor of course the sun carries its planets with it. One element of the\nsolution is found in the fact that, as a result of perspective, the\nstars toward which we are going appear to move apart toward all points\nof the compass, while those behind appear to close up together. Then\nthe spectroscopic principle already mentioned is invoked for studying\nthe shift of the lines, which is toward the violet in the stars ahead\nof us and toward the red in those that we are leaving behind. Of\ncourse the effects of the independent motions of the stars must be\ncarefully excluded. The result of the studies devoted to this subject\nis to show that we are traveling at a speed of twelve to fifteen miles\nper second in a northerly direction, toward the border of the\nconstellations Hercules and Lyra. A curious fact is that the more\nrecent estimates show that the direction is not very much out of a\nstraight line drawn from the sun to the star Vega, one of the most\nmagnificent suns in the heavens. But it should not be inferred from\nthis that Vega is drawing us on; it is too distant for its gravitation\nto have such an effect.\n\nMany unaccustomed thoughts are suggested by this mighty voyage of the\nsolar system. Whence have we come, and whither do we go? Every year of\nour lives we advance at least 375,000,000 miles. Since the traditional\ntime of Adam the sun has led his planets through the wastes of space\nno less than 225,000,000,000 miles, or more than 2400 times the\ndistance that separates him from the earth. Go back in imagination to\nthe geologic ages, and try to comprehend the distance over which the\nearth has flown. Where was our little planet when it emerged out of\nthe clouds of chaos? Where was the sun when his ``thunder march''\nbegan? What strange constellations shone down upon our globe when its\nmasters of life were the monstrous beasts of the ``Age of Reptiles''?\nA million years is not much of a span of time in geologic reckoning,\nyet a million years ago the earth was farther from its present place\nin space than any of the stars with a measurable parallax are now. It\nwas more than seven times as far as Sirius, nearly fourteen times as\nfar as Alpha Centauri, three times as far as Vega, and twice as far as\nArcturus. But some geologists demand two hundred, three hundred, even\none thousand million years to enable them to account for the\nevolutionary development of the earth and its inhabitants. In a\nthousand million years the earth would have traveled farther than from\nthe remotest conceivable depths of the Milky Way!\n\nOther curious reflections arise when we think of the form of the\nearth's track as it follows the lead of the sun, in a journey which\nhas neither known beginning nor conceivable end. There are probably\nmany minds which have found a kind of consolation in the thought that\nevery year the globe returns to the same place, on the same side of\nthe sun. This idea may have an occult connection with our traditional\nregard for anniversaries. When that period of the year returns at\nwhich any great event in our lives has occurred we have the feeling\nthat the earth, in its annual round, has, in a manner, brought us back\nto the scene of that event. We think of the earth's orbit as a\nwell-worn path which we traverse many times in the course of a\nlifetime. It seems familiar to us, and we grow to have a sort of\nattachment to it. The sun we are accustomed to regard as a fixed\ncenter in space, like the mill or pump around which the harnessed\npatient mule makes his endless circuits. But the real fact is that the\nearth never returns to the place in space where it has once quitted.\nIn consequence of the motion of the sun carrying the earth and the\nother planets along, the track pursued by our globe is a vast spiral\nin space continually developing and never returning upon its course.\nIt is probable that the tracks of the sun and the others stars are\nalso irregular, and possibly spiral, although, as far as can be at\npresent determined, they appear to be practically straight. Every\nstar, wherever it may be situated, is attracted by its fellow-stars\nfrom many sides at once, and although the force is minimized by\ndistance, yet in the course of many ages its effects must become\nmanifest.\n\nLooked at from another side, is there not something immensely\nstimulating and pleasing to the imagination in the idea of so\nstupendous a journey, which makes all of us the greatest of travelers?\nIn the course of a long life a man is transported through space thirty\nthousand million miles; Halley's Comet does not travel one-quarter as\nfar in making one of its immense circuits. And there are adventures on\nthis voyage of which we are just beginning to learn to take account.\nSpace is full of strange things, and the earth must encounter some of\nthem as it advances through the unknown. Many singular speculations\nhave been indulged in by astronomers concerning the possible effects\nupon the earth of the varying state of the space that it traverses.\nEven the alternation of hot and glacial periods has sometimes been\nascribed to this source. When tropical life flourished around the\npoles, as the remains in the rocks assure us, the needed high\ntemperature may, it has been thought, have been derived from the\npresence of the earth in a warm region of space. Then, too, there is a\ncertain interest for us in the thought of what our familiar planet has\npassed through. We cannot but admire it for its long journeying as we\nadmire the traveler who comes to us from remote and unexplored lands,\nor as we gaze with a glow of interest upon the first locomotive that\nhas crossed a continent, or a ship that has visited the Arctic or\nAntarctic regions. If we may trust the indications of the present\ncourse, the earth, piloted by the sun, has come from the Milky Way in\nthe far south and may eventually rejoin that mighty band of stars in\nthe far north.\n\nWhile the stars in general appear to travel independently of one\nanother, except when they are combined in binary or trinary systems,\nthere are notable exceptions to this rule. In some quarters of the sky\nwe behold veritable migrations of entire groups of stars whose members\nare too widely separated to show any indications of revolution about a\ncommon center of gravity. This leads us back again to the wonderful\ngroup of the Pleiades. All of the principle stars composing that group\nare traveling in virtually parallel lines. Whatever force set them\ngoing evidently acted upon all alike. This might be explained by the\nassumption that when the original projective force acted upon them\nthey were more closely united than they are at present, and that in\ndrifting apart they have not lost the impulse of the primal motion. Or\nit may be supposed that they are carried along by some current in\nspace, although it would be exceedingly difficult, in the present\nstate of our knowledge, to explain the nature of such a current. Yet\nthe theory of a current has been proposed. As to an attractive center\naround which they might revolve, none has been found. Another instance\nof similar ``star-drift'' is furnished by five of the seven stars\nconstituting the figure of the ``Great Dipper.'' In this case the\nstars concerned are separated very widely, the two extreme ones by not\nless than fifteen degrees, so that the idea of a common motion would\nnever have been suggested by their aspect in the sky; and the case\nbecomes the more remarkable from the fact that among and between them\nthere are other stars, some of the same magnitude, which do not share\ntheir motion, but are traveling in other directions. Still other\nexamples of the same phenomenon are found in other parts of the sky.\nOf course, in the case of compact star-clusters, it is assumed that\nall the members share a like motion of translation through space, and\nthe same is probably true of dense star-swarms and star-clouds.\n\nThe whole question of star-drift has lately assumed a new phase, in\nconsequence of the investigations of Kapteyn, Dyson, and Eddington on\nthe ``systematic motions of the stars.'' This research will, it is\nhoped, lead to an understanding of the general law governing the\nmovements of the whole body of stars constituting the visible\nuniverse. Taking about eleven hundred stars whose proper motions have\nbeen ascertained with an approach to certainty, and which are\ndistributed in all parts of the sky, it has been shown that there\nexists an apparent double drift, in two independent streams, moving in\ndifferent and nearly opposed directions. The apex of the motion of\nwhat is called ``Stream I'' is situated, according to Professor\nKapteyn, in right ascension 85\u00b0, declination south 11\u00b0, which places\nit just south of the constellation Orion; while the apex of ``Stream\nII'' is in right ascension 260\u00b0, declination south 48\u00b0, placing it in\nthe constellation Ara, south of Scorpio. The two apices differ very\nnearly 180\u00b0 in right ascension and about 120\u00b0 in declination. The\ndiscovery of these vast star-streams, if they really exist, is one of\nthe most extraordinary in modern astronomy. It offers the correlation\nof stellar movements needed as the basis of a theory of those\nmovements, but it seems far from revealing a physical cause for them.\nAs projected against the celestial sphere the stars forming the two\nopposite streams appear intermingled, some obeying one tendency and\nsome the other. As Professor Dyson has said, the hypothesis of this\ndouble movement is of a revolutionary character, and calls for further\ninvestigation. Indeed, it seems at first glance not less surprising\nthan would be the observation that in a snow-storm the flakes over our\nheads were divided into two parties and driving across each other's\ncourse in nearly opposite directions, as if urged by interpenetrating\nwinds.\n\nBut whatever explanation may eventually be found for the motions of\nthe stars, the knowledge of the existence of those motions must always\nafford a new charm to the contemplative observer of the heavens, for\nthey impart a sense of life to the starry system that would otherwise\nbe lacking. A stagnant universe, with every star fixed immovably in\nits place, would not content the imagination or satisfy our longing\nfor ceaseless activity. The majestic grandeur of the evolutions of the\ncelestial hosts, the inconceivable vastness of the fields of space in\nwhich they are executed, the countless numbers, the immeasurable\ndistances, the involved convolutions, the flocking and the scattering,\nthe interpenetrating marches and countermarches, the strange community\nof impulsion affecting stars that are wide apart in space and causing\nthem to traverse the general movement about them like aides and\ndespatch-bearers on a battle-field -- all these arouse an intensity of\ninterest which is heightened by the mystery behind them.\n\nThe Passing of the Constellations\n\nFrom a historical and picturesque point of view, one of the most\nstriking results of the motions of the stars described in the last\nchapter is their effect upon the forms of the constellations, which\nhave been watched and admired by mankind from a period so early that\nthe date of their invention is now unknown. The constellations are\nformed by chance combinations of conspicuous stars, like figures in a\nkaleidoscope, and if our lives were commensurate with the \u00e6ons of\ncosmic existence we should perceive that the kaleidoscope of the\nheavens was ceaselessly turning and throwing the stars into new\nsymmetries. Even if the stars stood fast, the motion of the solar\nsystem would gradually alter the configurations, as the elements of a\nlandscape dissolve and recombine in fresh groupings with the\ntraveler's progress amid them. But with the stars themselves all in\nmotion at various speeds and in many directions, the changes occur\nmore rapidly. Of course, ``rapid'' is here understood in a relative\nsense; the wheel of human history to an eye accustomed to the majestic\nprogression of the universe would appear to revolve with the velocity\nof a whirling dynamo. Only the deliberation of geological movements\ncan be contrasted with the evolution and devolution of the\nconstellations.\n\nAnd yet this secular fluctuation of the constellation figures is not\nwithout keen interest for the meditative observer. It is another\nreminder of the swift mutability of terrestial affairs. To the passing\nglance, which is all that we can bestow upon these figures, they\nappear so immutable that they have been called into service to form\nthe most lasting records of ancient thought and imagination that we\npossess. In the forms of the constellations, the most beautiful, and,\nin imaginative quality, the finest, mythology that the world has ever\nknown has been perpetuated. Yet, in a broad sense, this scroll of\nhuman thought imprinted on the heavens is as evanescent as the summer\nclouds. Although more enduring than parchment, tombs, pyramids, and\ntemples, it is as far as they from truly eternizing the memory of what\nman has fancied and done.\n\nBefore studying the effects that the motions of the stars have had and\nwill have upon the constellations, it is worth while to consider a\nlittle further the importance of the stellar pictures as archives of\nhistory. To emphasize the importance of these effects it is only\nnecessary to recall that the constellations register the oldest\ntraditions of our race. In the history of primeval religions they are\nthe most valuable of documents. Leaving out of account for the moment\nthe more familiar mythology of the Greeks, based on something older\nyet, we may refer for illustration to that of the mysterious Maya race\nof America. At Izamal, in Yucatan, says Mr Stansbury Hagar, is a group\nof ruins perched, after the Mexican and Central-American plan, on the\nsummits of pyramidal mounds which mark the site of an ancient\ntheogonic center of the Mayas. Here the temples all evidently refer to\na cult based upon the constellations as symbols. The figures and the\nnames, of course, were not the same as those that we have derived from\nour Aryan ancestors, but the star groups were the same or nearly so.\nFor instance, the loftiest of the temples at Izamal was connected with\nthe sign of the constellation known to us as Cancer, marking the place\nof the sun at the summer solstice, at which period the sun was\nsupposed to descend at noon like a great bird of fire and consume the\nofferings left upon the altar. Our Scorpio was known to the Mayas as a\nsign of the ``Death God.'' Our Libra, the ``Balance,'' with which the\nidea of a divine weighing out of justice has always been connected,\nseems to be identical with the Mayan constellation Teoyaotlatohua,\nwith which was associated a temple where dwelt the priests whose\nspecial business it was to administer justice and to foretell the\nfuture by means of information obtained from the spirits of the dead.\nOrion, the ``Hunter'' of our celestial mythology, was among the Mayas\na ``Warrior,'' while Sagittarius and others of our constellations were\nknown to them (under different names, of course), and all were endowed\nwith a religious symbolism. And the same star figures, having the same\nsignificance, were familiar to the Peruvians, as shown by the temples\nat Cuzco. Thus the imagination of ancient America sought in the\nconstellations symbols of the unchanging gods.\n\nBut, in fact, there is no nation and no people that has not recognized\nthe constellations, and at one period or another in its history\nemployed them in some symbolic or representative capacity. As handled\nby the Greeks from prehistoric times, the constellation myths became\nthe very soul of poetry. The imagination of that wonderful race\nidealized the principal star groups so effectively that the figures\nand traditions thus attached to them have, for civilized mankind,\ndisplaced all others, just as Greek art in its highest forms stands\nwithout parallel and eclipses every rival. The Romans translated no\nheroes and heroines of the mythical period of their history to the\nsky, and the deified C\u00e6sars never entered that lofty company, but the\nheavens are filled with the early myths of the Greeks. Herakles\nnightly resumes his mighty labors in the stars; Zeus, in the form of\nthe white ``Bull,'' Taurus, bears the fair Europa on his back through\nthe celestial waves; Andromeda stretches forth her shackled arms in\nthe star-gemmed ether, beseeching aid; and Perseus, in a blaze of\ndiamond armor, revives his heroic deeds amid sparkling clouds of\nstellar dust. There, too, sits Queen Cassiopeia in her dazzling chair,\nwhile the Great King, Cepheus, towers gigantic over the pole.\nProfessor Young has significantly remarked that a great number of the\nconstellations are connected in some way or other with the Argonautic\nExpedition -- that strangely fascinating legend of earliest Greek\nstory which has never lost its charm for mankind. In view of all this,\nwe may well congratulate ourselves that the constellations will\noutlast our time and the time of countless generations to follow us;\nand yet they are very far from being eternal. Let us now study some of\nthe effects of the stellar motions upon them.\n\nWe begin with the familiar figure of the ``Great Dipper.'' He who has\nnot drunk inspiration from its celestial bowl is not yet admitted to\nthe circle of Olympus. This figure is made up of seven conspicuous\nstars in the constellation Ursa Major, the ``Greater Bear.'' The\nhandle of the ``Dipper'' corresponds to the tail of the imaginary\n``Bear,'' and the bowl lies upon his flank. In fact, the figure of a\ndipper is so evident and that of a bear so unevident, that to most\npersons the ``Great Dipper'' is the only part of the constellation\nthat is recognizable. Of the seven stars mentioned, six are of nearly\nequal brightness, ranking as of the second magnitude, while the\nseventh is of only the third magnitude. The difference is very\nstriking, since every increase of one magnitude involves an increase\nof two-and-a-half times in brightness. There appears to be little\ndoubt that the faint star, which is situated at the junction of the\nbowl and the handle, is a variable of long period, since three hundred\nyears ago it was as bright as its companions. But however that may be,\nits relative faintness at the present time interferes but little with\nthe perfection of the ``Dipper's'' figure. In order the more readily\nto understand the changes which are taking place, it will be well to\nmention both the names and the Greek letters which are attached to the\nseven stars. Beginning at the star in the upper outer edge of the rim\nof the bowl and running in regular order round the bottom and then out\nto the end of the handle, the names and letters are as follows: Dubhe\n({\\alpha}), Merak ({\\beta}), Phaed ({\\gamma}), Megrez ({\\delta}),\nAlioth ({\\epsilon}), Mizar ({\\zeta}), and Benetnasch ({\\eta}). Megrez\nis the faint star already mentioned at the junction of the bowl and\nhandle, and Mizar, in the middle of the handle, has a close, naked-eye\ncompanion which is named Alcor. The Arabs called this singular pair of\nstars ``The Horse and Rider.'' Merak and Duhbe are called ``The\nPointers,'' because an imaginary line drawn northward through them\nindicates the Pole Star.\n\nNow it has been found that five of these stars -- viz., Merak, Phaed,\nMegrez, Alioth, and Mizar (with its comrade) -- are moving with\npractically the same speed in an easterly direction, while the other\ntwo, Dubhe and Benetnasch, are simultaneously moving westward, the\nmotions of Benetnasch being apparently more rapid. The consequence of\nthese opposed motions is, of course, that the figure of the ``Dipper''\ncannot always have existed and will not continue to exist. In the\naccompanying diagrams it has been thought interesting to show the\nrelative positions of these seven stars, as seen from the point which\nthe earth now occupies, both in the past and in the future. Arrows\nattached to the stars in the figure representing the present\nappearance of the ``Dipper'' indicate the directions of the motions\nand the distances over which they will carry the stars in a period of\nabout five hundred centuries. The time, no doubt, seems long, but\nremember the vast stretch of ages through which the earth has passed,\nand then reflect that no reason is apparent why our globe should not\ncontinue to be a scene of animation for ten thousand centuries yet to\ncome. The fact that the little star Alcor placed so close to Mizar\nshould accompany the latter in its flight is not surprising, but that\ntwo of the principal stars of the group should be found moving in a\ndirection directly opposed to that pursued by the other five is\nsurprising in the highest degree; and it recalls the strange theory of\na double drift affecting all the stars, to which attention was called\nin the preceding chapter. It would appear that Benetnasch and Dubhe\nbelong to one ``current,'' and Merak, Phaed, Megrez, Alioth, and Mizar\nto the other. As far as is known, the motion of the seven stars are\nnot shared by the smaller stars scattered about them, but on the\ntheory of currents there should be such a community of motion, and\nfurther investigation may reveal it.\n\nFrom the ``Great Dipper'' we turn to a constellation hardly less\nconspicuous and situated at an equal distance from the pole on the\nother side -- Cassiopeia. This famous star-group commemorating the\nromantic Queen of Ethiopia whose vain boasting of her beauty was\npunished by the exposure of her daughter Andromeda to the ``Sea\nMonster,'' is well-marked by five stars which form an irregular letter\n``W'' with its open side toward the pole. Three of these stars are\nusually ranked as of the second magnitude, and two of the third; but\nto ordinary observation they appear of nearly equal brightness, and\npresent a very striking picture. They mark out the chair and a part of\nthe figure of the beautiful queen. Beginning at the right-hand, or\nwestern, end of the ``W,'' their Greek letter designations are: Beta\n({\\beta}), Alpha ({\\alpha}), Gamma ({\\gamma}), Delta ({\\delta}), and\nEpsilon ({\\epsilon}). Four of them, Beta, Alpha, Delta, and Epsilon\nare traveling eastwardly at various speeds, while the fifth, Gamma,\nmoves in a westerly direction. The motion of Beta is more rapid than\nthat of any of the others. It should be said, however, that no little\nuncertainty attaches to the estimates of the rate of motion of stars\nwhich are not going very rapidly, and different observers often vary\nconsiderably in their results.\n\nIn the beautiful ``Northern Crown,'' one of the most perfect and\ncharming of all the figures to be found in the stars, the alternate\ncombining and scattering effects of the stellar motions are shown by\ncomparing the appearance which the constellation must have had five\nhundred centuries ago with that which it has at present and that which\nit will have in the future. The seven principle stars of the asterism,\nforming a surprisingly perfect coronet, have movements in three\ndirections at right angles to one another. That in these circumstances\nthey should ever have arrived at positions giving them so striking an\nappearance of definite association is certainly surprising; from its\naspect one would have expected to find a community of movement\ngoverning the brilliants of the ``Crown,'' but instead of that we find\nevidence that they will inevitably drift apart and the beautiful\nfigure will dissolve.\n\nA similar fate awaits such asterisms as the ``Northern Cross'' in\nCygnus; the ``Crow'' (Corvus), which stands on the back of the great\n``Sea Serpent,'' Hydra, and pecks at his scales; ``Job's Coffin''\n(Delphinus); the ``Great Square of Pegasus''; the ``Twins'' (Gemini);\nthe beautiful ``Sickle'' in Leo; and the exquisite group of the Hyades\nin Taurus. In the case of the Hyades, two controlling movements are\nmanifest: one, affecting five of the stars which form the well-known\nfigure of a letter ``V,'' is directed northerly; the other, which\ncontrols the direction of two stars, has an easterly trend. The chief\nstar of the group, Aldebaran, one of the finest of all stars both for\nits brilliance and its color, is the most affected by the easterly\nmotion. In time it will drift entirely out of connection with its\npresent neighbors. Although the Hyades do not form so compact a group\nas the Pleiades in the same constellation, yet their appearance of\nrelationship is sufficient to awaken a feeling of surprise over the\nfact that, as with the stars of the ``Dipper,'' their association is\nonly temporary or apparent.\n\nThe great figure of Orion appears to be more lasting, not because its\nstars are physically connected, but because of their great distance,\nwhich renders their movements too deliberate to be exactly\nascertained. Two of the greatest of its stars, Betelgeuse and Rigel,\npossess, as far as has been ascertained, no perceptible motion across\nthe line of sight, but there is a little movement perceptible in the\n``Belt.'' At the present time this consists of an almost perfect\nstraight line, a row of second-magnitude stars about equally spaced\nand of the most striking beauty. In the course of time, however, the\ntwo right-hand stars, Mintaka and Alnilam (how fine are these Arabic\nstar names!) will approach each other and form a naked-eye double, but\nthe third, Alnita, will drift away eastward, so that the ``Belt'' will\nno longer exist.\n\nFor one more example, let us go to the southern hemisphere, whose most\ncelebrated constellation, the ``Southern Cross,'' has found a place in\nall modern literatures, although it has no claim to consideration on\naccount of association with ancient legends. This most attractive\nasterism, which has never ceased to fascinate the imagination of\nChristendom since it was first devoutly described by the early\nexplorers of the South, is but a passing collocation of brilliant\nstars. Yet even in its transfigurations it has been for hundreds of\ncenturies, and will continue to be for hundreds of centuries to come,\na most striking object in the sky. Our figures show its appearance in\nthree successive phases: first, as it was fifty thousand years ago\n(viewed from the earth's present location); second, as it is in our\nday; and, third, as it will be an equal time in the future. The\nnearness of these bright stars to one another -- the length of the\nlonger beam of the ``Cross'' is only six degrees -- makes this group\nvery noticeable, whatever the arrangement of its components may be.\nThe largest star, at the base of the ``Cross,'' is of the first\nmagnitude, two of the others are of the second magnitude, and the\nfourth is of the third. Other stars, not represented in the figures,\nincrease the effect of a celestial blazonry, although they do not help\nthe resemblance to a cross.\n\nBut since the motion of the solar system itself will, in the course of\nso long a period as fifty thousand years, produce a great change in\nthe perspective of the heavens as seen from the earth, by carrying us\nnearly nineteen trillion miles from our present place, why, it may be\nasked, seek to represent future appearances of the constellations\nwhich we could not hope to see, even if we could survive so long? The\nanswer is: Because these things aid the mind to form a picture of the\neffects of the mobility of the starry universe. Only by showing the\nchanges from some definite point of view can we arrive at a due\ncomprehension of them. The constellations are more or less familiar to\neverybody, so that impending changes of their forms must at once\nstrike the eye and the imagination, and make clearer the significance\nof the movements of the stars. If the future history of mankind is to\nresemble its past and if our race is destined to survive yet a million\nyears, then our remote descendents will see a ``new heavens'' if not a\n``new earth,'' and will have to invent novel constellations to\nperpetuate their legends and mythologies.\n\nIf our knowledge of the relative distances of the stars were more\ncomplete, it would be an interesting exercise in celestial geometry to\nproject the constellations probably visible to the inhabitants of\nworlds revolving around some of the other suns of space. Our sun is\ntoo insignificant for us to think that he can make a conspicuous\nappearance among them, except, perhaps, in a few cases. As seen, for\ninstance, from the nearest known star, Alpha Centauri, the sun would\nappear of the average first magnitude, and consequently from that\nstandpoint he might be the gem of some little constellation which had\nno Sirius, or Arcturus, or Vega to eclipse him with its superior\nsplendor. But from the distance of the vast majority of the stars the\nsun would probably be invisible to the naked eye, and as seen from\nnearer systems could only rank as a fifth or sixth magnitude star,\nunnoticed and unknown except by the star-charting astronomer.\n\nConflagrations in the Heavens\n\nSuppose it were possible for the world to take fire and burn up -- as\nsome pessimists think that it will do when the Divine wrath shall have\nsufficiently accumulated against it -- nobody out of our own little\ncorner of space would ever be aware of the catastrophe! With all their\ntelescopes, the astronomers living in the golden light of Arcturus or\nthe diamond blaze of Canopus would be unable to detect the least\nglimmer of the conflagration that had destroyed the seat of Adam and\nhis descendents, just as now they are totally ignorant of its\nexistence.\n\nBut at least fifteen times in the course of recorded history men\nlooking out from the earth have beheld in the remote depths of space\ngreat outbursts of fiery light, some of them more splendidly luminous\nthan anything else in the firmament except the sun! If they were\nconflagrations, how many million worlds like ours were required to\nfeed their blaze?\n\nIt is probable that ``temporary'' or ``new'' stars, as these wonderful\napparitions are called, really are conflagrations; not in the sense of\na bonfire or a burning house or city, but in that of a sudden eruption\nof inconceivable heat and light, such as would result from the\nstripping off the shell of an encrusted sun or the crashing together\nof two mighty orbs flying through space with a hundred times the\nvelocity of the swiftest cannon-shot.\n\nTemporary stars are the rarest and most erratic of astronomical\nphenomena. The earliest records relating to them are not very clear,\nand we cannot in every instance be certain that it was one of these\nappearances that the ignorant and superstitious old chroniclers are\ntrying to describe. The first temporary star that we are absolutely\nsure of appeared in 1572, and is known as ``Tycho's Star,'' because\nthe celebrated Danish astronomer (whose remains, with his\ngold-and-silver artificial nose -- made necessary by a duel -- still\nintact, were disinterred and reburied in 1901) was the first to\nperceive it in the sky, and the most assiduous and successful in his\nstudies of it. As the first fully accredited representative of its\nclass, this new star made its entry upon the scene with becoming\n\u00e9clat. It is characteristic of these phenomena that they burst into\nview with amazing suddenness, and, of course, entirely unexpectedly.\nTycho's star appeared in the constellation Cassiopeia, near a now\nwell-known and much-watched little star named Kappa, on the evening of\nNovember 11, 1572. The story has often been repeated, but it never\nloses interest, how Tycho, going home that evening, saw people in the\nstreet pointing and staring at the sky directly over their heads, and\nfollowing the direction of their hands and eyes he was astonished to\nsee, near the zenith, an unknown star of surpassing brilliance. It\noutshone the planet Jupiter, and was therefore far brighter than the\nfirst magnitude. There was not another star in the heavens that could\nbe compared with it in splendor. Tycho was not in all respects free\nfrom the superstitions of his time -- and who is? -- but he had the\ntrue scientific instinct, and immediately he began to study the\nstranger, and to record with the greatest care every change in its\naspect. First he determined as well as he could with the imperfect\ninstruments of his day, many of which he himself had invented, the\nprecise location of the phenomena in the sky. Then he followed the\nchanges that it underwent. At first it brightened until its light\nequaled or exceeded that of the planet Venus at her brightest, a\nstatement which will be appreciated at its full value by anyone who\nhas ever watched Venus when she plays her dazzling r\u00f4le of ``Evening\nStar,'' flaring like an arc light in the sunset sky. It even became so\nbrilliant as to be visible in full daylight, since, its position being\ncircumpolar, it never set in the latitude of Northern Europe. Finally\nit began to fade, turning red as it did so, and in March, 1574, it\ndisappeared from Tycho's searching gaze, and has never been seen again\nfrom that day to this. None of the astronomers of the time could make\nanything of it. They had not yet as many bases of speculation as we\npossess today.\n\nTycho's star has achieved a romantic reputation by being fancifully\nidentified with the ``Star of Bethlehem,'' said to have led the\nwondering Magi from their eastern deserts to the cradle-manger of the\nSavior in Palestine. Many attempts have been made to connect this\ntraditional ``star'' with some known phenomenon of the heavens, and\nnone seems more idle than this. Yet it persistently survives, and no\nastronomer is free from eager questions about it addressed by people\nwhose imagination has been excited by the legend. It is only necessary\nto say that the supposition of a connection between the phenomenon of\nthe Magi and Tycho's star is without any scientific foundation. It was\noriginally based on an unwarranted assumption that the star of Tycho\nwas a variable of long period, appearing once every three hundred and\nfifteen years, or thereabout. If that were true there would have been\nan apparition somewhere near the traditional date of the birth of\nChrist, a date which is itself uncertain. But even the data on which\nthe assumption was based are inconsistent with the theory. Certain\nmonkish records speak of something wonderful appearing in the sky in\nthe years 1264 and 945, and these were taken to have been outbursts of\nTycho's star. Investigation shows that the records more probably refer\nto comets, but even if the objects seen were temporary stars, their\ndates do not suit the hypothesis; from 945 to 1264 there is a gap of\n319 years, and from 1264 to 1572 one of only 308 years; moreover 337\nyears have now (1909) elapsed since Tycho saw the last glimmer of his\nstar. Upon a variability so irregular and uncertain as that, even if\nwe felt sure that it existed, no conclusion could be found concerning\nan apparition occurring 2000 years ago.\n\nIn the year 1600 (the year in which Giordano Bruno was burned at the\nstake for teaching that there is more than one physical world), a\ntemporary star of the third magnitude broke out in the constellation\nCygnus, and curiously enough, considering the rarity of such\nphenomena, only four years later another surprisingly brilliant one\nappeared in the constellation Ophiuchus. This is often called\n``Kepler's star,'' because the great German astronomer devoted to it\nthe same attention that Tycho had given to the earlier phenomenon. It,\ntoo, like Tycho's, was at first the brightest object in the stellar\nheavens, although it seems never to have quite equaled its famous\npredecessor in splendor. It disappeared after a year, also turning of\na red color as it became more faint. We shall see the significance of\nthis as we go on. Some of Kepler's contemporaries suggested that the\noutburst of this star was due to a meeting of atoms in space, and idea\nbearing a striking resemblance to the modern theory of ``astronomical\ncollisions.''\n\nIn 1670, 1848, and 1860 temporary stars made their appearance, but\nnone of them was of great brilliance. In 1866 one of the second\nmagnitude broke forth in the ``Northern Crown'' and awoke much\ninterest, because by that time the spectroscope had begun to be\nemployed in studying the composition of the stars, and Huggins\ndemonstrated that the new star consisted largely of incandescent\nhydrogen. But this star, apparently unlike the others mentioned, was\nnot absolutely new. Before its outburst it had shown as a star of the\nninth magnitude (entirely invisible, of course, to the naked eye), and\nafter about six weeks it faded to its original condition in which it\nhas ever since remained. In 1876 a temporary star appeared in the\nconstellation Cygnus, and attained at one time the brightness of the\nsecond magnitude. Its spectrum and its behavior resembled those of its\nimmediate predecessor. In 1885, astronomers were surprised to see a\nsixth-magnitude star glimmering in the midst of the hazy cloud of the\ngreat Andromeda Nebula. It soon absolutely disappeared. Its spectrum\nwas remarkable for being ``continuous,'' like that of the nebula\nitself. A continuous spectrum is supposed to represent a body, or a\nmass, which is either solid or liquid, or composed of gas under great\npressure. In January, 1892, a new star was suddenly seen in the\nconstellation Auriga. It never rose much above the fourth magnitude,\nbut it showed a peculiar spectrum containing both bright and dark\nlines of hydrogen.\n\nBut a bewildering surprise was now in store; the world was to behold\nat the opening of the twentieth century such a celestial spectacle as\nhad not been on view since the times of Tycho and Kepler. Before\ndaylight on the morning of February 22, 1901, the Rev. Doctor\nAnderson, of Edinburgh, an amateur astronomer, who had also been the\nfirst to see the new star in Auriga, beheld a strange object in the\nconstellation Perseus not far from the celebrated variable star Algol.\nHe recognized its character at once, and immediately telegraphed the\nnews, which awoke the startled attention of astronomers all over the\nworld. When first seen the new star was no brighter than Algol (less\nthan the second magnitude), but within twenty-four hours it was\nablaze, outshining even the brilliant Capella, and far surpassing the\nfirst magnitude. At the spot in the sky where it appeared nothing\nwhatever was visible on the night before its coming. This is known\nwith certainty because a photograph had been made of that very region\non February 21, and this photograph showed everything down to the\ntwelfth magnitude, but not a trace of the stranger which burst into\nview between the 21st and the 22nd like the explosion of a rocket.\n\nUpon one who knew the stars the apparition of this intruder in a\nwell-known constellation had the effect of a sudden invasion. The new\nstar was not far west of the zenith in the early evening, and in that\nposition showed to the best advantage. To see Capella, the hitherto\nunchallenged ruler of that quarter of the sky, abased by comparison\nwith this stranger of alien aspect, for there was always an unfamiliar\nlook about the ``nova,'' was decidedly disconcerting. It seemed to\nportend the beginning of a revolution in the heavens. One could\nunderstand what the effect of such an apparition must have been in the\nsuperstitious times of Tycho. The star of Tycho had burst forth on the\nnorthern border of the Milky Way; this one was on its southern border,\nsome forty-five degrees farther east.\n\nAstronomers were well-prepared this time for the scientific study of\nthe new star, both astronomical photography and spectroscopy having\nbeen perfected, and the results of their investigations were\ncalculated to increase the wonder with which the phenomenon was\nregarded. The star remained at its brightest only a few days; then,\nlike a veritable conflagration, it began to languish; and, like the\nreflection of a dying fire, as it sank it began to glow with the red\ncolor of embers. But its changes were spasmodic; once about every\nthree days it flared up only to die away again. During these\nfluctuations its light varied alternately in the ratio of one to six.\nFinally it took a permanent downward course, and after a few months\nthe naked eye could no longer perceive it; but it remained visible\nwith telescopes, gradually fading until it had sunk to the ninth\nmagnitude. Then another astonishing change happened: in August\nphotographs taken at the Yerkes Observatory and at Heidelberg showed\nthat the ``nova'' was surrounded by a spiral nebula! The nebula had\nnot been there before, and no one could doubt that it represented a\nphase of the same catastrophe that had produced the outburst of the\nnew star. At one time the star seemed virtually to have disappeared,\nas if all its substance had been expanded into the nebulous cloud, but\nalways there remained a stellar nucleus about which the misty spiral\nspread wider and ever wider, like a wave expanding around a center of\ndisturbance. The nebula too showed a variability of brightness, and\nfour condensations which formed in it seemed to have a motion of\nrevolution about the star. As time went on the nebula continued to\nexpand at a rate which was computed to be not less than twenty\nthousand miles per second! And now the star itself, showing\nindications of having turned into a nebula, behaved in a most erratic\nmanner, giving rise to the suspicion that it was about to burst out\nagain. But this did not occur, and at length it sunk into a state of\nlethargy from which it has to the present time not recovered. But the\nnebulous spiral has disappeared, and the entire phenomena as it now\n(1909) exists consists of a faint nebulous star of less than the ninth\nmagnitude.\n\nThe wonderful transformations just described had been forecast in\nadvance of the discovery of the nebulous spiral encircling the star by\nthe spectroscopic study of the latter. At first there was no\nsuggestion of a nebular constitution, but within a month or two\ncharacteristic nebular lines began to appear, and in less than six\nmonths the whole spectrum had been transformed to the nebular type. In\nthe mean time the shifting of the spectral lines indicated a\ncomplication of rapid motions in several directions simultaneously.\nThese motions were estimated to amount to from one hundred to five\nhundred miles per second.\n\nThe human mind is so constituted that it feels forced to seek an\nexplanation of so marvelous a phenomenon as this, even in the absence\nof the data needed for a sound conclusion. The most natural\nhypothesis, perhaps, is that of a collision. Such a catastrophe could\ncertainly happen. It has been shown, for instance, that in infinity of\ntime the earth is sure to be hit by a comet; in the same way it may be\nasserted that, if no time limit is fixed, the sun is certain to run\nagainst some obstacle in space, either another star, or a dense meteor\nswarm, or one of the dark bodies which there is every reason to\nbelieve abound around us. The consequences of such a collision are\neasy to foretell, provided that we know the masses and the velocities\nof the colliding bodies. In a preceding chapter we have discussed the\nmotions of the sun and stars, and have seen that they are so swift\nthat an encounter between any two of them could not but be disastrous.\nBut this is not all; for as soon as two stars approached within a few\nmillion miles their speed would be enormously increased by their\nreciprocal attractions and, if their motion was directed radially with\nrespect to their centers, they would come together with a crash that\nwould reduce them both to nebulous clouds. It is true that the chances\nof such a ``head-on'' collision are relatively very small; two stars\napproaching each other would most probably fall into closed orbits\naround their common center of gravity. If there were a collision it\nwould most likely be a grazing one instead of a direct front-to-front\nencounter. But even a close approach, without any actual collision,\nwould probably prove disastrous, owing to the tidal influence of each\nof the bodies on the other. Suns, in consequence of their enormous\nmasses and dimensions and the peculiarities of their constitution, are\nexceedingly dangerous to one another at close quarters. Propinquity\nawakes in them a mutually destructive tendency. Consisting of matter\nin the gaseous, or perhaps, in some cases, liquid, state, their tidal\npull upon each other if brought close together might burst them\nasunder, and the photospheric envelope being destroyed the internal\nincandescent mass would gush out, bringing fiery death to any planets\nthat were revolving near. Without regard to the resulting disturbance\nof the earth's orbit, the close approach of a great star to the sun\nwould be in the highest degree perilous to us. But this is a danger\nwhich may properly be regarded as indefinitely remote, since, at our\npresent location in space, we are certainly far from every star except\nthe sun, and we may feel confident that no great invisible body is\nnear, for if there were one we should be aware of its presence from\nthe effects of its attraction. As to dark nebul\u00e6 which may possibly\nlie in the track that the solar system is pursuing at the rate of\n375,000,000 miles per year, that is another question -- and they, too,\ncould be dangerous!\n\nThis brings us directly back to ``Nova Persei,'' for among the many\nsuggestions offered to explain its outburst, as well as those of other\ntemporary stars, one of the most fruitful is that of a collision\nbetween a star and a vast invisible nebula. Professor Seeliger, of\nMunich, first proposed this theory, but it afterward underwent some\nmodifications from others. Stated in a general form, the idea is that\na huge dark body, perhaps an extinguished sun, encountered in its\nprogress through space a widespread flock of small meteors forming a\ndark nebula. As it plunged into the swarm the friction of the\ninnumerable collisions with the meteors heated its surface to\nincandescence, and being of vast size it then became visible to us as\na new star. Meanwhile the motion of the body through the nebula, and\nits rotation upon itself, set up a gyration in the blazing atmosphere\nformed around it by the vaporized meteors; and as this atmosphere\nspread wider, under the laws of gyratory motion a rotation in the\nopposite direction began in the inflamed meteoric cloud outside the\ncentral part of the vortex. Thus the spectral lines were caused to\nshow motion in opposite directions, a part of the incandescent mass\napproaching the earth simultaneously with the retreat of another part.\nSo the curious spectroscopic observations before mentioned were\nexplained. This theory might also account for the appearance of the\nnebulous spiral first seen some six months after the original\noutburst. The sequent changes in the spectrum of the ``nova'' are\naccounted for by this theory on the assumption, reasonable enough in\nitself, that at first the invading body would be enveloped in a\nvaporized atmosphere of relatively slight depth, producing by its\nabsorption the fine dark lines first observed; but that as time went\non and the incessant collisions continued, the blazing atmosphere\nwould become very deep and extensive, whereupon the appearance of the\nspectral lines would change, and bright lines due to the light of the\nincandescent meteors surrounding the nucleus at a great distance would\ntake the place of the original dark ones. The vortex of meteors once\nformed would protect the flying body within from further immediate\ncollisions, the latter now occurring mainly among the meteors\nthemselves, and then the central blaze would die down, and the\noriginal splendor of the phenomenon would fade.\n\nBut the theories about Nova Persei have been almost as numerous as the\nastronomers who have speculated about it. One of the most startling of\nthem assumed that the outburst was caused by the running amuck of a\ndark star which had encountered another star surrounded with planets,\nthe renewed outbreaks of light after the principal one had faded being\ndue to the successive running down of the unfortunate planets! Yet\nanother hypothesis is based on what we have already said of the tidal\ninfluence that two close approaching suns would have upon each other.\nSupposing two such bodies which had become encrusted, but remained\nincandescent and fluid within, to approach within almost striking\ndistance; they would whirl each other about their common center of\ngravity, and at the same time their shells would burst under the tidal\nstrain, and their glowing nuclei being disclosed would produce a great\noutburst of light. Applying this theory to a ``nova,'' like that of\n1866 in the ``Northern Crown,'' which had been visible as a small star\nbefore the outbreak, and which afterward resumed its former aspect, we\nshould have to assume that a yet shining sun had been approached by a\ndark body whose attraction temporarily burst open its photosphere. It\nmight be supposed that in this case the dark body was too far advanced\nin cooling to suffer the same fate from the tidal pull of its victim.\nBut a close approach of that kind would be expected to result in the\nformation of a binary system, with orbits of great eccentricity,\nperhaps, and after the lapse of a certain time the outburst should be\nrenewed by another approximation of the two bodies. A temporary star\nof that kind would rather be ranked as a variable.\n\nThe celebrated French astronomer, Janssen, had a different theory of\nNova Persei, and of temporary stars in general. According to his idea,\nsuch phenomena might be the result of chemical changes taking place in\na sun without interference by, or collision with, another body.\nJanssen was engaged for many years in trying to discover evidence of\nthe existence of oxygen in the sun, and he constructed his observatory\non the summit of Mount Blanc specially to pursue that research. He\nbelieved that oxygen must surely exist in the sun since we find so\nmany other familiar elements included in the constitution of the solar\nglobe, and as he was unable to discover satisfactory evidence of its\npresence he assumed that it existed in a form unknown on the earth. If\nit were normally in the sun's chromosphere, or coronal atmosphere, he\nsaid, it would combine with the hydrogen which we know is there and\nform an obscuring envelope of water vapor. It exists, then, in a\nspecial state, uncombined with hydrogen; but let the temperature of\nthe sun sink to a critical point and the oxygen will assume its normal\nproperties and combine with the hydrogen, producing a mighty outburst\nof light and heat. This, Janssen thought, might explain the phenomena\nof the temporary stars. It would also, he suggested, account for their\nbrief career, because the combination of the elements would be quickly\naccomplished, and then the resulting water vapor would form an\natmosphere cutting off the radiation from the star within.\n\nThis theory may be said to have a livelier human interest than some of\nthe others, since, according to it, the sun may carry in its very\nconstitution a menace to mankind; one does not like to think of it\nbeing suddenly transformed into a gigantic laboratory for the\nexplosive combination of oxygen and hydrogen! But while Janssen's\ntheory might do for some temporary stars, it is inadequate to explain\nall the phenomena of Nova Persei, and particularly the appearance of\nthe great spiral nebula that seemed to exhale from the heart of the\nstar. Upon the whole, the theory of an encounter between a star and a\ndark nebula seems best to fit the observations. By that hypothesis the\nexpanding billow of light surrounding the core of the conflagration is\nvery well accounted for, and the spectroscopic peculiarities are also\nexplained.\n\nDr Gustov Le Bon offers a yet more alarming theory, suggesting that\ntemporary stars are the result of atomic explosion; but we shall touch\nupon this more fully in Chapter 14.\n\nTwice in the course of this discussion we have called attention to the\nchange of color invariably undergone by temporary stars in the later\nstages of their career. This was conspicuous with Nova Persei which\nglowed more and more redly as it faded, until the nebulous light began\nto overpower that of the stellar nucleus. Nothing could be more\nsuggestive of the dying out of a great fire. Moreover, change of color\nfrom white to red is characteristic of all variable stars of long\nperiod, such as ``Mira'' in Cetus. It is also characteristic of stars\nbelieved to be in the later stages of evolution, and consequently\napproaching extinction, like Antares and Betelgeuse, and still more\nnotably certain small stars which ``gleam like rubies in the field of\nthe telescope.'' These last appear to be suns in the closing period of\nexistence as self-luminous bodies. Between the white stars, such as\nSirius and Rigel, and the red stars, such as Aldebaran and Alpha\nHerculis, there is a progressive series of colors from golden yellow\nthrough orange to deep red. The change is believed to be due to the\nincrease of absorbing vapors in the stellar atmosphere as the body\ncools down. In the case of ordinary stars these changes no doubt\noccupy many millions of years, which represent the average duration of\nsolar life; but the temporary stars run through similar changes in a\nfew months: they resemble ephemeral insects -- born in the morning and\ndoomed to perish with the going down of the sun.\n\nExplosive and Whirling Nebul\u00e6\n\nOne of the most surprising triumphs of celestial photography was\nProfessor Keeler's discovery, in 1899, that the great majority of the\nnebul\u00e6 have a distinctly spiral form. This form, previously known in\nLord Rosse's great ``Whirlpool Nebula,'' had been supposed to be\nexceptional; now the photographs, far excelling telescopic views in\nthe revelation of nebular forms, showed the spiral to be the typical\nshape. Indeed, it is a question whether all nebul\u00e6 are not to some\nextent spiral. The extreme importance of this discovery is shown in\nthe effect that it has had upon hitherto prevailing views of solar and\nplanetary evolution. For more than three-quarters of a century\nLaplace's celebrated hypothesis of the manner of origin of the solar\nsystem from a rotating and contracting nebula surrounding the sun had\nguided speculation on that subject, and had been tentatively extended\nto cover the evolution of systems in general. The apparent forms of\nsome of the nebul\u00e6 which the telescope had revealed were regarded, and\nby some are still regarded, as giving visual evidence in favor of this\ntheory. There is a ``ring nebula'' in Lyra with a central star, and a\n``planetary nebula'' in Gemini bearing no little resemblance to the\nplanet Saturn with its rings, both of which appear to be practical\nrealizations of Laplace's idea, and the elliptical rings surrounding\nthe central condensation of the Andromeda Nebula may be cited for the\nsame kind of proof.\n\nBut since Keeler's discovery there has been a decided turning away of\nspeculation another way. The form of the spiral nebul\u00e6 seems to be\nentirely inconsistent with the theory of an originally globular or\ndisk-shaped nebula condensing around a sun and throwing or leaving off\nrings, to be subsequently shaped into planets. Some astronomers,\nindeed, now reject Laplace's hypothesis in toto, preferring to think\nthat even our solar system originated from a spiral nebula. Since the\nspiral type prevails among the existing nebul\u00e6, we must make any\nmechanical theory of the development of stars and planetary systems\nfrom them accord with the requirements which that form imposes. A\nglance at the extraordinary variations upon the spiral which Professor\nKeeler's photographs reveal is sufficient to convince one of the\ndifficulty of the task of basing a general theory upon them. In truth,\nit is much easier to criticize Laplace's hypothesis than to invent a\nsatisfactory substitute for it. If the spiral nebul\u00e6 seem to oppose it\nthere are other nebul\u00e6 which appear to support it, and it may be that\nno one fixed theory can account for all the forms of stellar evolution\nin the universe. Our particular planetary system may have originated\nvery much as the great French mathematician supposed, while others\nhave undergone, or are now undergoing, a different process of\ndevelopment. There is always a too strong tendency to regard an\nimportant new discovery and the theories and speculations based upon\nit as revolutionizing knowledge, and displacing or overthrowing\neverything that went before. Upon the plea that ``Laplace only made a\nguess'' more recent guesses have been driven to extremes and treated\nby injudicious exponents as ``the solid facts at last.''\n\nBefore considering more recent theories than Laplace's, let us see\nwhat the nature of the photographic revelations is. The vast celestial\nmaelstrom discovered by Lord Rosse in the ``Hunting Dogs'' may be\ntaken as the leading type of the spiral nebul\u00e6, although there are\nless conspicuous objects of the kind which, perhaps, better illustrate\nsome of their peculiarities. Lord Rosse's nebula appears far more\nwonderful in the photographs than in his drawings made with the aid of\nhis giant reflecting telescope at Parsonstown, for the photographic\nplate records details that no telescope is capable of showing. Suppose\nwe look at the photograph of this object as any person of common sense\nwould look at any great and strange natural phenomenon. What is the\nfirst thing that strikes the mind? It is certainly the appearance of\nviolent whirling motion. One would say that the whole glowing mass had\nbeen spun about with tremendous velocity, or that it had been set\nrotating so rapidly that it had become the victim of ``centrifugal\nforce,'' one huge fragment having broken loose and started to gyrate\noff into space. Closer inspection shows that in addition to the\nprincipal focus there are various smaller condensations scattered\nthrough the mass. These are conspicuous in the spirals. Some of them\nare stellar points, and but for the significance of their location we\nmight suppose them to be stars which happen to lie in a line between\nus and the nebula. But when we observe how many of them follow most\nfaithfully the curves of the spirals we cannot but conclude that they\nform an essential part of the phenomenon; it is not possible to\nbelieve that their presence in such situations is merely fortuitous.\nOne of the outer spirals has at least a dozen of these star-like\npoints strung upon it; some of them sharp, small, and distinct, others\nmore blurred and nebulous, suggesting different stages of\ncondensation. Even the part which seems to have been flung loose from\nthe main mass has, in addition to its central condensation, at least\none stellar point gleaming in the half-vanished spire attached to it.\nSome of the more distant stars scattered around the ``whirlpool'' look\nas if they too had been shot out of the mighty vortex, afterward\ncondensing into unmistakable solar bodies. There are at least two\ncurved rows of minute stars a little beyond the periphery of the\nluminous whirl which clearly follow lines concentric with those of the\nnebulous spirals. Such facts are simply dumbfounding for anyone who\nwill bestow sufficient thought upon them, for these are suns, though\nthey may be small ones; and what a birth is that for a sun!\n\nLook now again at the glowing spirals. We observe that hardly have\nthey left the central mass before they begin to coagulate. In some\nplaces they have a ``ropy'' aspect; or they are like peascods filled\nwith growing seeds, which eventually will become stars. The great\nfocus itself shows a similar tendency, especially around its\ncircumference. The sense that it imparts of a tremendous shattering\nforce at work is overwhelming. There is probably more matter in that\nwhirling and bursting nebula than would suffice to make a hundred\nsolar systems! It must be confessed at once that there is no\nconfirmation of the Laplacean hypothesis here; but what hypothesis\nwill fit the facts? There is one which it has been claimed does so,\nbut we shall come to that later. In the meanwhile, as a preparation,\nfix in the memory the appearance of that second spiral mass spinning\nbeside its master which seems to have spurned it away.\n\nFor a second example of the spiral nebul\u00e6 look at the one in the\nconstellation Triangulum. God, how hath the imagination of puny man\nfailed to comprehend Thee! Here is creation through destruction with a\nvengeance! The spiral form of the nebula is unmistakable, but it is\nhalf obliterated amid the turmoil of flying masses hurled away on all\nsides with tornadic fury. The focus itself is splitting asunder under\nthe intolerable strain, and in a little while, as time is reckoned in\nthe Cosmos, it will be gyrating into stars. And then look at the\ncyclonic rain of already finished stars whirling round the outskirts\nof the storm. Observe how scores of them are yet involved in the\nfading streams of the nebulous spirals; see how they have been thrown\ninto vast loops and curves, of a beauty that half redeems the terror\nof the spectacle enclosed within their lines -- like iridescent cirri\nhovering about the edges of a hurricane. And so again are suns born!\n\nLet us turn to the exquisite spiral in Ursa Major; how different its\naspect from that of the other! One would say that if the terrific coil\nin Triangulum has all but destroyed itself in its fury, this one on\nthe contrary has just begun its self-demolition. As one gazes one\nseems to see in it the smooth, swift, accelerating motion that\nprecedes catastrophe. The central part is still intact, dense, and\nuniform in texture. How graceful are the spirals that smoothly rise\nfrom its oval rim and, gemmed with little stars, wind off into the\ndarkness until they have become as delicate as threads of gossamer!\nBut at bottom the story told here is the same -- creation by gyration!\n\nCompare with the above the curious mass in Cetus. Here the plane of\nthe whirling nebula nearly coincides with our line of sight and we see\nthe object at a low angle. It is far advanced and torn to shreds, and\nif we could look at it perpendicularly to its plane it is evident that\nit would closely resemble the spectacle in Triangulum.\n\nThen take the famous Andromeda Nebula (see Frontispiece), which is so\nvast that notwithstanding its immense distance even the naked eye\nperceives it as an enigmatical wisp in the sky. Its image on the\nsensitive plate is the masterpiece of astronomical photography; for\nwild, incomprehensible beauty there is nothing that can be compared\nwith it. Here, if anywhere, we look upon the spectacle of creation in\none of its earliest stages. The Andromeda Nebula is apparently less\nadvanced toward transformation into stellar bodies than is that in\nTriangulum. The immense crowd of stars sprinkled over it and its\nneighborhood seem in the main to lie this side of the nebula, and\nconsequently to have no connection with it. But incipient stars (in\nsome places clusters of them) are seen in the nebulous rings, while\none or two huge masses seem to give promise of transformation into\nstellar bodies of unusual magnitude. I say ``rings'' because although\nthe loops encompassing the Andromeda Nebula have been called spirals\nby those who wish utterly to demolish Laplace's hypothesis, yet they\nare not manifestly such, as can be seen on comparing them with the\nundoubted spirals of the Lord Rosse Nebula. They look quite as much\nlike circles or ellipses seen at an angle of, say, fifteen or twenty\ndegrees to their plane. If they are truly elliptical they accord\nfairly well with Laplace's idea, except that the scale of magnitude is\nstupendous, and if the Andromeda Nebula is to become a solar system it\nwill surpass ours in grandeur beyond all possibility of comparison.\n\nThere is one circumstance connected with the spiral nebul\u00e6, and\nconspicuous in the Andromeda Nebula on account of its brightness,\nwhich makes the question of their origin still more puzzling; they all\nshow continuous spectra, which, as we have before remarked, indicate\nthat the mass from which the light comes is either solid or liquid, or\na gas under heavy pressure. Thus nebul\u00e6 fall into two classes: the\n``white'' nebul\u00e6, giving a continuous spectrum; and the ``green''\nnebul\u00e6 whose spectra are distinctly gaseous. The Andromeda Nebula is\nthe great representative of the former class and the Orion Nebula of\nthe latter. The spectrum of the Andromeda Nebula has been interpreted\nto mean that it consists not of luminous gas, but of a flock of stars\nso distant that they are separately indistinguishable even with\npowerful telescopes, just as the component stars of the Milky Way are\nindistinguishable with the naked eye; and upon this has been based the\nsuggestion that what we see in Andromeda is an outer universe whose\nstars form a series of elliptical garlands surrounding a central mass\nof amazing richness. But this idea is unacceptable if for no other\nreason than that, as just said, all the spiral nebul\u00e6 possess the same\nkind of spectrum, and probably no one would be disposed to regard them\nall as outer universes. As we shall see later, the peculiarity of the\nspectra of the spiral nebul\u00e6 is appealed to in support of a modern\nsubstitute for Laplace's hypothesis.\n\nFinally, without having by any means exhausted the variety exhibited\nby the spiral nebul\u00e6, let us turn to the great representative of the\nother species, the Orion Nebula. In some ways this is even more\nmarvelous than the others. The early drawings with the telescope\nfailed to convey an adequate conception either of its sublimity or of\nits complication of structure. It exists in a nebulous region of\nspace, since photographs show that nearly the whole constellation is\ninterwoven with faintly luminous coils. To behold the entry of the\ngreat nebula into the field even of a small telescope is a startling\nexperience which never loses its novelty. As shown by the photographs,\nit is an inscrutable chaos of perfectly amazing extent, where spiral\nbands, radiating streaks, dense masses, and dark yawning gaps are\nstrangely intermingled without apparent order. In one place four\nconspicuous little stars, better seen in a telescope than in the\nphotograph on account of the blurring produced by over-exposure, are\nsuggestively situated in the midst of a dark opening, and no observer\nhas ever felt any doubt that these stars have been formed from the\nsubstance of the surrounding nebula. There are many other stars\nscattered over its expanse which manifestly owe their origin to the\nsame source. But compare the general appearance of this nebula with\nthe others that we have studied, and remark the difference. If the\nunmistakably spiral nebul\u00e6 resemble bursting fly-wheels or grindstones\nfrom whose perimeters torrents of sparks are flying, the Orion Nebula\nrather recalls the aspect of a cloud of smoke and fragments produced\nby the explosion of a shell. This idea is enforced by the look of the\nouter portion farthest from the bright half of the nebula, where\nsharply edged clouds with dark spaces behind seem to be billowing away\nas if driven by a wind blowing from the center.\n\nNext let us consider what scientific speculation has done in the\neffort to explain these mysteries. Laplace's hypothesis can certainly\nfind no standing ground either in the Orion Nebula or in those of a\nspiral configuration, whatever may be its situation with respect to\nthe grand Nebula of Andromeda, or the ``ring'' and ``planetary''\nnebul\u00e6. Some other hypothesis more consonant with the appearances must\nbe found. Among the many that have been proposed the most elaborate is\nthe ``Planetesimal Hypothesis'' of Professors Chamberlin and Moulton.\nIt is to be remarked that it applies to the spiral nebul\u00e6\ndistinctively, and not to an apparently chaotic mass of gas like the\nvast luminous cloud in Orion. The gist of the theory is that these\ncurious objects are probably the result of close approaches to each\nother of two independent suns, reminding us of what was said on this\nsubject when we were dealing with temporary stars. Of the previous\nhistory of these appulsing suns the theory gives us no account; they\nare simply supposed to arrive within what may be called an effective\ntide-producing distance, and then the drama begins. Some of the\nprobable consequences of such an approach have been noticed in Chapter\n5; let us now consider them a little more in detail.\n\nTides always go in couples; if there is a tide on one side of a globe\nthere will be a corresponding tide on the other side. The cause is to\nbe found in the law that the force of gravitation varies inversely as\nthe square of the distance; the attraction on the nearest surface of\nthe body exercised by another body is greater than on its center, and\ngreater yet than on its opposite surface. If two great globes attract\neach other, each tends to draw the other out into an ellipsoidal\nfigure; they must be more rigid than steel to resist this -- and even\nthen they cannot altogether resist. If they are liquid or gaseous they\nwill yield readily to the force of distortion, the amount of which\nwill depend upon their distance apart, for the nearer they are the\ngreater becomes the tidal strain. If they are encrusted without and\nliquid or gaseous in the interior, the internal mass will strive to\nassume the figure demanded by the tidal force, and will, if it can,\nburst the restraining envelope. Now this is virtually the predicament\nof the body we call a sun when in the immediate presence of another\nbody of similarly great mass. Such a body is presumably gaseous\nthroughout, the component gases being held in a state of rigidity by\nthe compression produced by the tremendous gravitational force of\ntheir own aggregate mass. At the surface such a body is enveloped in a\nshell of relatively cool matter. Now suppose a great attracting body,\nsuch as another sun, to approach near enough for the difference in its\nattraction on the two opposite sides of the body and on its center to\nbecome very great; the consequence will be a tidal deformation of the\nwhole body, and it will lengthen out along the line of the\ngravitational pull and draw in at the sides, and if its shell offers\nconsiderable resistance, but not enough to exercise a complete\nrestraint, it will be violently burst apart, or blown to atoms, and\nthe internal mass will leap out on the two opposite sides in great\nfiery spouts. In the case of a sun further advanced in cooling than\nours the interior might be composed of molten matter while the\nexterior crust had become rigid like the shell of an egg; then the\nforce of the ``tidal explosion'' produced by the appulse of another\nsun would be more violent in consequence of the greater resistance\novercome. Such, then, is the mechanism of the first phase in the\nhistory of a spiral nebula according to the Planetesimal Hypothesis.\nTwo suns, perhaps extinguished ones, have drawn near together, and an\nexplosive outburst has occured in one or both. The second phase calls\nfor a more agile exercise of the imagination.\n\nTo simplify the case, let us suppose that only one of the tugging suns\nis seriously affected by the strain. Its vast wings produced by the\noutburst are twisted into spirals by their rotation and the contending\nattractions exercised upon them, as the two suns, like battleships in\ndesperate conflict, curve round each other, concentrating their\ndestructive energies. Then immense quantities of d\u00e9bris are scattered\nabout in which eddies are created, and finally, as the sun that caused\nthe damage goes on its way, leaving its victim to repair its injuries\nas it may, the dispersed matter cools, condenses, and turns into\nstreams of solid particles circling in elliptical paths about their\nparent sun. These particles, or fragments, are the ``planetesimals''\nof the theory. In consequence of the inevitable intersection of the\norbits of the planetesimals, nodes are formed where the flying\nparticles meet, and at these nodes large masses are gradually\naccumulated. The larger the mass the greater its attraction, and at\nlast the nodal points become the nuclei of great aggregations from\nwhich planets are shaped.\n\nThis, in very brief form, is the Planetesimal Hypothesis which we are\nasked to substitute for that based on Laplace's suggestion as an\nexplanation of the mode of origin of the solar system; and the\nphenomena of the spiral nebul\u00e6 are appealed to as offering evident\nsupport to the new hypothesis. We are reminded that they are\nelliptical in outline, which accords with the hypothesis; that their\nspectra are not gaseous, which shows that they may be composed of\nsolid particles like the planetesimals; and that their central masses\npresent an oval form, which is what would result from the tidal\neffects, as just described. We also remember that some of them, like\nthe Lord Rosse and the Andromeda nebul\u00e6, are visually double, and in\nthese cases we might suppose that the two masses represent the\ntide-burst suns that ventured into too close proximity. It may be\nadded that the authors of the theory do not insist upon the appulse of\ntwo suns as the only way in which the planetesimals may have\noriginated, but it is the only supposition that has been worked out.\n\nBut serious questions remain. It needs, for instance, but a glance at\nthe Triangulum monster to convince the observer that it cannot be a\nsolar system which is being evolved there, but rather a swarm of\nstars. Many of the detached masses are too vast to admit of the\nsupposition that they are to be transformed into planets, in our sense\nof planets, and the distances of the stars which appear to have been\noriginally ejected from the focal masses are too great to allow us to\nliken the assemblage that they form to a solar system. Then, too, no\nnodes such as the hypothesis calls for are visible. Moreover, in most\nof the spiral nebul\u00e6 the appearances favor the view that the\nsupposititious encountering suns have not separated and gone each\nrejoicing on its way, after having inflicted the maximum possible\ndamage on its opponent, but that, on the contrary, they remain in\nclose association like two wrestlers who cannot escape from each\nother's grasp. And this is exactly what the law of gravitation\ndemands; stars cannot approach one another with impunity, with regard\neither to their physical make-up or their future independence of\nmovement. The theory undertakes to avoid this difficulty by assuming\nthat in the case of our system the approach of the foreign body to the\nsun was not a close one -- just close enough to produce the tidal\nextrusion of the relatively insignificant quantity of matter needed to\nform the planets. But even then the effect of the appulse would be to\nchange the direction of flight, both of the sun and of its visitor,\nand there is no known star in the sky which can be selected as the\nsun's probable partner in their ancient pas deux. That there are\nunconquered difficulties in Laplace's hypothesis no one would deny,\nbut in simplicity of conception it is incomparably more satisfactory,\nand with proper modifications could probably be made more consonant\nwith existing facts in our solar system than that which is offered to\nreplace it. Even as an explanation of the spiral nebul\u00e6, not as solar\nsystems in process of formation, but as the birthplaces of stellar\nclusters, the Planetesimal Hypothesis would be open to many\nobjections. Granting its assumptions, it has undoubtedly a strong\nmathematical framework, but the trouble is not with the mathematics\nbut with the assumptions. Laplace was one of the ablest mathematicians\nthat ever lived, but he had never seen a spiral nebula; if he had, he\nmight have invented a hypothesis to suit its phenomena. His actual\nhypothesis was intended only for our solar system, and he left it in\nthe form of a ``note'' for the consideration of his successors, with\nthe hope that they might be able to discover the full truth, which he\nconfessed was hidden from him. It cannot be said that that truth has\nyet been found, and when it is found the chances are that intuition\nand not logic will have led to it.\n\nThe spiral nebul\u00e6, then, remain among the greatest riddles of the\nuniverse, while the gaseous nebul\u00e6, like that of Orion, are no less\nmysterious, although it seems impossible to doubt that both forms give\nbirth to stars. It is but natural to look to them for light on the\nquestion of the origin of our planetary system; but we should not\nforget that the scale of the phenomena in the two cases is vastly\ndifferent, and the forces in operation may be equally different. A\nhill may have been built up by a glacier, while a mountain may be the\nproduct of volcanic forces or of the upheaval of the strata of the\nplanet.\n\nThe Banners of the Sun\n\nAs all the world knows, the sun, a blinding globe pouring forth an\ninconceivable quantity of light and heat, whose daily passage through\nthe sky is caused by the earth's rotation on its axis, constitutes the\nmost important phenomenon of terrestial existence. Viewed with a dark\nglass to take off the glare, or with a telescope, its rim is seen to\nbe a sharp and smooth circle, and nothing but dark sky is visible\naround it. Except for the interference of the moon, we should probably\nnever have known that there is any more of the sun than our eyes\nordinarily see.\n\nBut when an eclipse of the sun occurs, caused by the interposition of\nthe opaque globe of the moon, we see its immediate surroundings, which\nin some respects are more wonderful than the glowing central orb.\nThese surroundings, although not in the sense in which we apply the\nterm to the gaseous envelope of the earth, may be called the sun's\natmosphere. They consist of two very different parts -- first, the red\n``prominences,'' which resemble tongues of flame ascending thousands\nof miles above the sun's surface; and, second, the ``corona,'' which\nextends to distances of millions of miles from the sun, and shines\nwith a soft, glowing light. The two combined, when well seen, make a\nspectacle without parallel among the marvels of the sky. Although many\nattempts have been made to render the corona visible when there is no\neclipse, all have failed, and it is to the moon alone that we owe its\nrevelation. To cover the sun's disk with a circular screen will not\nanswer the purpose because of the illumination of the air all about\nthe observer. When the moon hides the sun, on the other hand, the\nsunlight is withdrawn from a great cylinder of air extending to the\ntop of the atmosphere and spreading many miles around the observer.\nThere is then no glare to interfere with the spectacle, and the corona\nappears in all its surprising beauty. The prominences, however,\nalthough they were discovered during an eclipse, can now, with the aid\nof the spectroscope, be seen at any time. But the prominences are\nrarely large enough to be noticed by the naked eye, while the\nstreamers of the corona, stretching far away in space, like ghostly\nbanners blown out from the black circle of the obscuring moon, attract\nevery eye, and to this weird apparition much of the fear inspired by\neclipses has been due. But if the corona has been a cause of terror in\nthe past it has become a source of growing knowledge in our time.\n\nThe story of the first scientific observation of the corona and the\nprominences is thrillingly interesting, and in fact dramatic. The\nobservation was made during the eclipse of 1842, which fortunately was\nvisible all over Central and Southern Europe so that scores of\nastronomers saw it. The interest centers in what happened at Pavia in\nNorthern Italy, where the English astronomer Francis Baily had set up\nhis telescope. The eclipse had begun and Bailey was busy at his\ntelescope when, to quote his own words in the account which he wrote\nfor the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society:\n\n  I was astounded by a tremendous burst of applause from the streets\n  below, and at the same moment was electrified by the sight of one\n  of the most brilliant and splendid phenomena that can well be\n  imagined; for at that instant the dark body of the moon was\n  suddenly surrounded with a corona, or kind of bright glory, similar\n  in shape and magnitude to that which painters draw round the heads\n  of saints...\n\n  Pavia contains many thousand inhabitants, the major part of whom\n  were at this early hour walking about the streets and squares or\n  looking out of windows in order to witness this long-talked-of\n  phenomenon; and when the total obscuration took place, which was\n  instantaneous, there was a universal shout from every observer\n  which ``made the welkin ring,'' and for the moment withdrew my\n  attention from the object with which I was immediately occupied. I\n  had, indeed, expected the appearance of a luminous circle round the\n  moon during the time of total obscurity; but I did not expect, from\n  any of the accounts of preceding eclipses that I had read, to\n  witness so magnificent an exhibition as that which took place...\n\n  Splendid and astonishing, however, as this remarkable phenomenon\n  really was, and although it could not fail to call forth the\n  admiration and applause of every beholder, yet I must confess that\n  there was at the same time something in its singular and wonderful\n  appearance that was appalling...\n\n  But the most remarkable circumstance attending the phenomenon was\n  the appearance of three large protuberances apparently emanating\n  from the circumference of the moon, but evidently forming a portion\n  of the corona. They had the appearance of mountains of a prodigious\n  elevation; their color was red tinged with lilac or purple; perhaps\n  the color of the peach-blossom would more nearly represent it. They\n  somewhat resembled the tops of the snowy Alpine mountains when\n  colored by the rising or the setting sun. They resembled the Alpine\n  mountains in another respect, inasmuch as their light was perfectly\n  steady, and had none of that flickering or sparkling motion so\n  visible in other parts of the corona...\n\n  The whole of these protuberances were visible even to the last\n  moment of total obscuration, and when the first ray of light was\n  admitted from the sun they vanished, with the corona, altogether,\n  and daylight was instantly restored.\n\nI have quoted nearly all of this remarkable description not alone for\nits intrinsic interest, but because it is the best depiction that can\nbe found of the general phenomena of a total solar eclipse. Still, not\nevery such eclipse offers an equally magnificent spectacle. The\neclipses of 1900 and 1905, for instance, which were seen by the\nwriter, the first in South Carolina and the second in Spain, fell far\nshort of that described by Bailey in splendor and impressiveness. Of\ncourse, something must be allowed for the effect of surprise; Bailey\nhad not expected to see what was so suddenly disclosed to him. But\nboth in 1900 and 1905 the amount of scattered light in the sky was\nsufficient in itself to make the corona appear faint, and there were\nno very conspicuous prominences visible. Yet on both occasions there\nwas manifest among the spectators that mingling of admiration and awe\nof which Bailey speaks. The South Carolinians gave a cheer and the\nladies waved their handkerchiefs when the corona, ineffably delicate\nof form and texture, melted into sight and then in two minutes melted\naway again. The Spaniards, crowded on the citadel hill of Burgos, with\ntheir king and his royal retinue in their midst, broke out with a\ngreat clapping of hands as the awaited spectacle unfolded itself in\nthe sky; and on both occasions, before the applause began, after an\nawed silence a low murmur ran through the crowds. At Burgos it is said\nmany made the sign of the cross.\n\nIt was not long before Bailey's idea that the prominences were a part\nof the corona was abandoned, and it was perceived that the two\nphenomena were to a great extent independent. At the eclipse of 1868,\nwhich the astronomers, aroused by the wonderful scene of 1842, and\neager to test the powers of the newly invented spectroscope, flocked\nto India to witness, Janssen conceived the idea of employing the\nspectroscope to render the prominences visible when there was no\neclipse. He succeeded the very next day, and these phenomena have been\nstudied in that way ever since.\n\nThere are recognized two kinds of prominences -- the ``erruptive'' and\nthe ``quiescent.'' The latter, which are cloud-like in form, may be\nseen almost anywhere along the edge of the sun; but the former, which\noften shoot up as if hurled from mighty volcanoes, appear to be\nassociated with sun-spots, and appear only above the zones where spots\nabound. Either of them, when seen in projection against the brilliant\nsolar disk, appears white, not red, as against a background of sky.\nThe quiescent prominences, whose elevation is often from forty\nthousand to sixty thousand miles, consist, as the spectroscope shows,\nmainly of hydrogen and helium. The latter, it will be remembered, is\nan element which was known to be in the sun many years before the\ndiscovery that it also exists in small quantities on the earth. A fact\nwhich may have a significance which we cannot at present see is that\nthe emanation from radium gradually and spontaneously changes into\nhelium, an alchemistical feat of nature that has opened many curious\nvistas to speculative thinkers. The eruptive prominences, which do not\nspread horizontally like the others, but ascend with marvelous\nvelocity to elevations of half a million miles or more, are apparently\ncomposed largely of metallic vapors -- i.e. metals which are usually\nsolid on the earth, but which at solar temperatures are kept in a\nvolatilized state. The velocity of their ascent occasionally amounts\nto three hundred or four hundred miles per second. It is known from\nmathematical considerations that the gravitation of the sun would not\nbe able to bring back any body that started from its surface with a\nvelocity exceeding three hundred and eighty-three miles per second; so\nit is evident that some of the matter hurled forth in eruptive\nprominences may escape from solar control and go speeding out into\nspace, cooling and condensing into solid masses. There seems to be no\nreason why some of the projectiles from the sun might not reach the\nplanets. Here, then, we have on a relatively small scale, explosions\nrecalling those which it has been imagined may be the originating\ncause of some of the sudden phenomena of the stellar heavens.\n\nOf the sun-spots it is not our intention here specifically to speak,\nbut they evidently have an intimate connection with eruptive\nprominences, as well as some relation, not yet fully understood, with\nthe corona. Of the real cause of sun-spots we know virtually nothing,\nbut recent studies by Professor Hale and others have revealed a\nstrange state of things in the clouds of metallic vapors floating\nabove them and their surroundings. Evidences of a cyclonic tendency\nhave been found, and Professor Hale has proved that sun-spots are\nstrong magnetic fields, and consist of columns of ionized vapors\nrotating in opposite directions in the two hemispheres. A fact which\nmay have the greatest significance is that titanium and vanadium have\nbeen found both in sun-spots and in the remarkable variable Mira Ceti,\na star which every eleven months, or thereabout, flames up with great\nbrilliancy and then sinks back to invisibility with the naked eye. It\nhas been suggested that sun-spots are indications of the beginning of\na process in the sun which will be intensified until it falls into the\nstate of such a star as Mira. Stars very far advanced in evolution,\nwithout showing variability, also exhibit similar spectra; so that\nthere is much reason for regarding sunspots as emblems of advancing\nage.\n\nThe association of the corona with sun-spots is less evident than that\nof the eruptive prominences; still such an association exists, for the\nform and extent of the corona vary with the sun-spot period of which\nwe shall presently speak. The constitution of the corona remains to be\ndiscovered. It is evidently in part gaseous, but it also probably\ncontains matter in the form of dust and small meteors. It includes one\nsubstance altogether mysterious -- ``coronium.'' There are reasons for\nthinking that this may be the lightest of all the elements, and\nProfessor Young, its discoverer, said that it was ``absolutely unique\nin nature; utterly distinct from any other known form of matter,\nterrestial, solar, or cosmical.'' The enormous extent of the corona is\none of its riddles. Since the development of the curious subject of\nthe ``pressure of light'' it has been proposed to account for the\nsustentation of the corona by supposing that it is borne upon the\nbillows of light continually poured out from the sun. Experiment has\nproved, what mathematical considerations had previously pointed out as\nprobable, that the waves of light exert a pressure or driving force,\nwhich becomes evident in its effects if the body acted upon is\nsufficiently small. In that case the light pressure will prevail over\nthe attraction of gravitation, and propel the attenuated matter away\nfrom the sun in the teeth of its attraction. The earth itself would be\ndriven away if, instead of consisting of a solid globe of immense\naggregate mass, it were a cloud of microscopic particles. The reason\nis that the pressure varies in proportion to the surface of the body\nacted upon, while the gravitational attraction is proportional to the\nvolume, or the total amount of matter in the body. But the surface of\nany body depends upon the square of its diameter, while the volume\ndepends upon the cube of the diameter. If, for instance, the diameter\nis represented by 4, the surface will be proportional to 4 \u00d7 4, or 16,\nand the volume to 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4, or 64; but if the diameter is taken as 2,\nthe surface will be 2 \u00d7 2, or 4, and the volume 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, or 8. Now,\nthe ratio of 4 to 8 is twice as great as that of 16 to 64. If the\ndiameter is still further decreased, the ratio of the surface to the\nvolume will proportionally grow larger; in other words, the pressure\nwill gain upon the attraction, and whatever their original ratio may\nhave been, a time will come, if the diminution of size continues, when\nthe pressure will become more effective than the attraction, and the\nbody will be driven away. Supposing the particles of the corona to be\nbelow the critical size for the attraction of a mass like that of the\nsun to control them, they would be driven off into the surrounding\nspace and appear around the sun like the clouds of dust around a mill.\nWe shall return to this subject in connection with the Zodiacal Light,\nthe Aurora, and Comets.\n\nOn the other hand, there are parts of the corona which suggest by\ntheir forms the play of electric or magnetic forces. This is\nbeautifully shown in some of the photographs that have been made of\nthe corona during recent eclipses. Take, for instance, that of the\neclipse of 1900. The sheaves of light emanating from the poles look\nprecisely like the ``lines of force'' surrounding the poles of a\nmagnet. It will be noticed in this photograph that the corona appears\nto consist of two portions: one comprising the polar rays just spoken\nof, and the other consisting of the broader, longer, and less-defined\nmasses of light extending out from the equatorial and middle-latitude\nzones. Yet even in this more diffuse part of the phenomenon one can\ndetect the presence of submerged curves bearing more or less\nresemblance to those about the poles. Just what part electricity or\nelectro-magnetism plays in the mechanism of the solar radiation it is\nimpossible to say, but on the assumption that it is a very important\npart is based the hypothesis that there exists a direct solar\ninfluence not only upon the magnetism, but upon the weather of the\nearth. This hypothesis has been under discussion for half a century,\nand still we do not know just how much truth it represents. It is\ncertain that the outbreak of great disturbances on the sun,\naccompanied by the formation of sun-spots and the upshooting of\neruptive prominences (phenomena which we should naturally expect to be\nattended by action), have been instantly followed by corresponding\n``magnetic storms'' on the earth and brilliant displays of the auroral\nlights. There have been occasions when the influence has manifested\nitself in the most startling ways, a great solar outburst being\nfollowed by a mysterious gripping of the cable and telegraph systems\nof the world, as if an invisible and irresistible hand had seized\nthem. Messages are abruptly cut off, sparks leap from the telegraph\ninstruments, and the entire earth seems to have been thrown into a\nmagnetic flurry. These occurrences affect the mind with a deep\nimpression of the dependence of our planet on the sun, such as we do\nnot derive from the more familiar action of the sunlight on the growth\nof plants and other phenomena of life depending on solar influences.\n\nPerhaps the theory of solar magnetic influence upon the weather is\nbest known in connection with the ``sun-spot cycle.'' This, at any\nrate, is, as already remarked, closely associated with the corona. Its\nexistence was discovered in 1843 by the German astronomer Schwabe. It\nis a period of variable length, averaging about eleven years, during\nwhich the number of spots visible on the sun first increases to a\nmaximum, then diminishes to a minimum, and finally increases again to\na maximum. For unknown reasons the period is sometimes two or three\nyears longer than the average and sometimes as much shorter.\nNevertheless, the phenomena always recur in the same order. Starting,\nfor instance, with a time when the observer can find few or no spots,\nthey gradually increase in number and size until a maximum, in both\nsenses, is reached, during which the spots are often of enormous size\nand exceedingly active. After two or three years they begin to\ndiminish in number, magnitude, and activity until they almost or quite\ndisappear. A strange fact is that when a new period opens, the spots\nappear first in high northern and southern latitudes, far from the\nsolar equator, and as the period advances they not only increase in\nnumber and size, but break out nearer and nearer to the equator, the\nlast spots of a vanishing period sometimes lingering in the equatorial\nregion after the advance-guard of its successor has made its\nappearance in the high latitudes. Spots are never seen on the equator\nnor near the poles. It was not very long after the discovery of the\nsun-spot cycle that the curious observation was made that a striking\ncoincidence existed between the period of the sun-spots and another\nperiod affecting the general magnetic condition of the earth. When a\ncurved line representing the varying number of sun-spots was compared\nwith another curve showing the variations in the magnetic state of the\nearth the two were seen to be in almost exact accord, a rise in one\ncurve corresponding to a rise in the other, and a fall to a fall.\nContinued observation has proved that this is a real coincidence and\nnot an accidental one, so that the connection, although as yet\nunexplained, is accepted as established. But does the influence extend\nfurther, and directly affect the weather and the seasons as well as\nthe magnetic elements of the earth? A final answer to this question\ncannot yet be given, for the evidence is contradictory, and the\ninterpretations put upon it depend largely on the predilections of the\njudges.\n\nBut, in a broad sense, the sun-spots and the phenomena connected with\nthem must have a relation to terrestial meteorology, for they prove\nthe sun to be a variable star. Reference was made, a few lines above,\nto the resemblance of the spectra of sun-spots to those of certain\nstars which seem to be failing through age. This in itself is\nextremely suggestive; but if this resemblance had never been\ndiscovered, we should have been justified in regarding the sun as\nvariable in its output of energy; and not only variable, but probably\nincreasingly so. The very inequalities in the sun-spot cycle are\nsuspicious. When the sun is most spotted its total light may be\nreduced by one-thousandth part, although it is by no means certain\nthat its outgiving of thermal radiations is then reduced. A loss of\none-thousandth of its luminosity would correspond to a decrease of\n.0025 of a stellar magnitude, considering the sun as a star viewed\nfrom distant space. So slight a change would not be perceptible; but\nit is not alone sun-spots which obscure the solar surface, its entire\nglobe is enveloped with an obscuring veil. When studied with a\npowerful telescope the sun's surface is seen to be thickly mottled\nwith relatively obscure specks, so numerous that it has been estimated\nthat they cut off from one-tenth to one-twentieth of the light that we\nshould receive from it if the whole surface were as brilliant as its\nbrightest parts. The condition of other stars warrants the conclusion\nthat this obscuring envelope is the product of a process of\nrefrigeration which will gradually make the sun more and more variable\nuntil its history ends in extinction. Looking backward, we see a time\nwhen the sun must have been more brilliant than it is now. At that\ntime it probably shone with the blinding white splendor of such stars\nas Sirius, Spica, and Vega; now it resembles the relatively dull\nProcyon; in time it will turn ruddy and fall into the closing cycle\nrepresented by Antares. Considering that once it must have been more\nradiantly powerful than at present, one is tempted to wonder if that\ncould have been the time when tropical life flourished within the\nearth's polar circles, sustained by a vivific energy in the sun which\nit has now lost.\n\nThe corona, as we have said, varies with the sun-spot cycle. When the\nspots are abundant and active the corona rises strong above the\nspotted zones, forming immense beams or streamers, which on one\noccasion, at least, had an observed length of ten million miles. At\nthe time of a spot minimum the corona is less brilliant and has a\ndifferent outline. It is then that the curved polar rays are most\nconspicuous. Thus the vast banners of the sun, shaken out in the\neclipse, are signals to tell of its varying state, but it will\nprobably be long before we can read correctly their messages.\n\nThe Zodiacal Light Mystery\n\nThere is a singular phenomenon in the sky -- one of the most puzzling\nof all -- which has long arrested the attention of astronomers,\ndefying their efforts at explanation, but which probably not one in a\nhundred, and possibly not one in a thousand, of the readers of this\nbook has ever seen. Yet its name is often spoken, and it is a\nconspicuous object if one knows when and where to look for it, and\nwhen well seen it exhibits a mystical beauty which at the same time\ncharms and awes the beholder. It is called ``The Zodiacal Light,''\nbecause it lies within the broad circle of the Zodiac, marking the\nsun's apparent annual path through the stars. What it is nobody has\nyet been able to find out with certainty, and books on astronomy\nusually speak of it with singular reserve. But it has given rise to\nmany remarkable theories, and a true explanation of it would probably\nthrow light on a great many other celestial mysteries. The Milky Way\nis a more wonderful object to look upon, but its nature can be\ncomprehended, while there is a sort of uncanniness about the Zodiacal\nLight which immediately impresses one upon seeing it, for its part in\nthe great scheme of extra-terrestrial affairs is not evident.\n\nIf you are out-of-doors soon after sunset -- say, on an evening late\nin the month of February -- you may perceive, just after the angry\nflush of the dying winter's day has faded from the sky, a pale ghostly\npresence rising above the place where the sun went down. The writer\nremembers from boyhood the first time it was pointed out to him and\nthe unearthly impression that it made, so that he afterward avoided\nbeing out alone at night, fearful of seeing the spectral thing again.\nThe phenomenon brightens slowly with the fading of the twilight, and\nsoon distinctly assumes the shape of an elongated pyramid of pearly\nlight, leaning toward the south if the place of observation is in the\nnorthern hemisphere. It does not impress the observer at all in the\nsame manner as the Milky Way; that looks far off and is clearly among\nthe stars, but the Zodiacal Light seems closer at hand, as if it were\nsomething more intimately concerning the earth. To all it immediately\nsuggests a connection, also, with the sunken sun. If the night is\nclear and the moon absent (and if you are in the country, for city\nlights ruin the spectacles of the sky), you will be able to watch the\napparition for a long time. You will observe that the light is\nbrightest near the horizon, gradually fading as the pyramidal beam\nmounts higher, but in favorable circumstances it may be traced nearly\nto the meridian south of the zenith, where its apex at last vanishes\nin the starlight. It continues visible during the evenings of March\nand part of April, after which, ordinarily, it is seen no more, or if\nseen is relatively faint and unimpressive. But when autumn comes it\nappears again, this time not like a wraith hovering above the westward\ntomb of the day-god, but rather like a spirit of the morning\nannouncing his reincarnation in the east.\n\nThe reason why the Zodiacal Light is best seen in our latitudes at the\nperiods just mentioned is because at those times the Zodiac is more\nnearly perpendicular to the horizon, first in the west and then in the\neast; and, since the phenomenon is confined within the borders of the\nZodiac, it cannot be favorably placed for observation when the\nzodiacal plane is but slightly inclined to the horizon. Its faint\nlight requires the contrast of a background of dark sky in order to be\nreadily perceptible. But within the tropics, where the Zodiac is\nalways at a favorable angle, the mysterious light is more constantly\nvisible. Nearly all observant travelers in the equatorial regions have\ntaken particular note of this phenomenon, for being so much more\nconspicuous there than in the temperate zones it at once catches the\neye and holds the attention as a novelty. Humboldt mentions it many\ntimes in his works, for his genius was always attracted by things out\nof the ordinary and difficult of explanation, and he made many careful\nobservations on its shape, its brilliancy, and its variations; for\nthere can be no doubt that it does vary, and sometimes to an\nastonishing degree. It is said that it once remained practically\ninvisible in Europe for several years in succession. During a trip to\nSouth Africa in 1909 an English astronomer, Mr E. W. Maunder, found a\nremarkable difference between the appearance of the Zodiacal Light on\nhis going and coming voyages. In fact, when crossing the equator going\nsouth he did not see it at all; but on returning he had, on March 6th,\nwhen one degree south of the equator, a memorable view of it.\n\n  It was a bright, clear night, and the Zodiacal Light was\n  extraordinarily brilliant -- brighter than he had ever seen it\n  before. The Milky Way was not to be compared with it. The brightest\n  part extended 75\u00b0 from the sun. There was a faint and much narrower\n  extension which they could just make out beyond the Pleiades along\n  the ecliptic, but the greater part of the Zodiacal Light showed as\n  a broad truncated column, and it did not appear nearly as conical\n  as he had before seen it.\n\nWhen out of the brief twilight of intertropical lands, where the sun\ndrops vertically to the horizon and night rushes on like a wave of\ndarkness, the Zodiacal Light shoots to the very zenith, its color is\ndescribed as a golden tint, entirely different from the silvery sheen\nof the Milky Way. If I may venture again to refer to personal\nexperiences and impressions, I will recall a view of the Zodiacal\nLight from the summit of the cone of Mt Etna in the autumn of the year\n1896 (more briefly described in Astronomy with the Naked Eye). There\nare few lofty mountains so favorably placed as Etna for observations\nof this kind. It was once resorted to by Prof. George E. Hale, in an\nattempt to see the solar corona without an eclipse. Rising directly\nfrom sea-level to an elevation of nearly eleven thousand feet, the\nobserver on its summit at night finds himself, as it were, lost in the\nmidst of the sky. But for the black flanks of the great cone on which\nhe stands he might fancy himself to be in a balloon. On the occasion\nto which I refer the world beneath was virtually invisible in the\nmoonless night. The blaze of the constellations overhead was\nastonishingly brilliant, yet amid all their magnificence my attention\nwas immediately drawn to a great tapering light that sprang from the\nplace on the horizon where the sun would rise later, and that seemed\nto be blown out over the stars like a long, luminous veil. It was the\nfinest view of the Zodiacal light that I had ever enjoyed -- thrilling\nin its strangeness -- but I was almost disheartened by the\nindifference of my guide, to whom it was only a light and nothing\nmore. If he had no science, he had less poetry -- rather a remarkable\nthing, I thought, for a child of his clime. The Light appeared to me\nto be distinctly brighter than the visible part of the Milky Way which\nincluded the brilliant stretches in Auriga and Perseus, and its color,\nif one may speak of color in connection with such an object, seemed\nricher than that of the galactic band; but I did not think of it as\nyellow, although Humboldt has described it as resembling a golden\ncurtain drawn over the stars, and Du Chaillu in Equatorial Africa\nfound it of a bright yellow color. It may vary in color as in\nconspicuousness. The fascination of that extraordinary sight has never\nfaded from my memory. I turned to regard it again and again, although\nI had never seen the stellar heavens so brilliant, and it was one of\nthe last things I looked for when the morning glow began softly to\nmount in the east, and Sicily and the Mediterranean slowly emerged\nfrom the profound shadow beneath us.\n\nThe Zodiacal Light seems never to have attracted from astronomers in\ngeneral the amount of careful attention that it deserves; perhaps\nbecause so little can really be made of it as far as explanation is\nconcerned. I have referred to the restraint that scientific writers\napparently feel in speaking of it. The grounds for speculation that it\naffords may be too scanty to lead to long discussions, yet it piques\ncuriosity, and as we shall see in a moment has finally led to a most\ninteresting theory. Once it was the subject of an elaborate series of\nstudies which carried the observer all round the world. That was in\n1845--46, during the United States Exploring Expedition that visited\nthe then little known Japan. The chaplain of the fleet, the Rev. Mr\nJones, went out prepared to study the mysterious light in all its\nphases. He saw it from many latitudes on both sides of the equator,\nand the imagination cannot but follow him with keen interest in his\nworld-circling tour, keeping his eyes every night fixed upon the\nphantasm overhead, whose position shifted with that of the hidden sun.\nHe demonstrated that the flow extends at times completely across the\ncelestial dome, although it is relatively faint directly behind the\nearth. On his return the government published a large volume of his\nobservations, in which he undertook to show that the phenomenon was\ndue to the reflection of sunlight from a ring of meteoric bodies\nencircling the earth. But, after all, this elaborate investigation\nsettled nothing.\n\nProf. E. E. Barnard has more recently devoted much attention to the\nZodiacal Light, as well as to a strange attendant phenomenon called\nthe ``Gegenschein,'' or Counterglow, because it always appears at that\npoint in the sky which is exactly opposite the sun. The Gegenschein is\nan extremely elusive phenomenon, suitable only for eyes that have been\nspecially trained to see it. Professor Newcomb has cautiously remarked\nthat\n\n  it is said that in that point of the heavens directly opposite the\n  sun there is an elliptical patch of light... This phenomenon is so\n  difficult to account for that its existence is sometimes doubted;\n  yet the testimony in its favor is difficult to set aside.\n\nIt certainly cannot be set aside at all since the observations of\nBarnard. I recall an attempt to see it under his guidance during a\nvisit to Mount Hamilton, when he was occupied there with the Lick\ntelescope. Of course, both the Gegenschein and the Zodiacal Light are\ntoo diffuse to be studied with telescopes, which, so to speak, magnify\nthem out of existence. They can only be successfully studied with the\nnaked eye, since every faintest glimmer that they afford must be\nutilized. This is especially true of the Gegenschein. At Mount\nHamilton, Mr Barnard pointed out to me its location with reference to\ncertain stars, but with all my gazing I could not be sure that I saw\nit. To him, on the contrary, it was obvious; he had studied it for\nmonths, and was able to indicate its shape, its boundaries, its\ndiameter, and the declination of its center with regard to the\necliptic. There is not, of course, the shadow of a doubt of the\nexistence of the Gegenschein, and yet I question if one person in a\nmillion has ever seen or ever will see it. The Zodiacal Light, on the\nother hand, is plain enough, provided that the time and the\ncircumstances of the observation are properly chosen.\n\nIn the attempts to explain the Zodiacal Light, the favorite hypothesis\nhas been that it is an appendage of the sun -- perhaps simply an\nextension of the corona in the plane of the ecliptic, which is not\nvery far from coinciding with that of the sun's equator. This idea is\nquite a natural one, because of the evident relation of the light to\nthe position of the sun. The vast extension of the equatorial wings of\nthe corona in 1878 gave apparent support to this hypothesis; if the\nsubstance of the corona could extend ten million miles from the sun,\nwhy might it not extend even one hundred million, gradually fading out\nbeyond the orbit of the earth? A variation of this hypothesis assumes\nthat the reflection is due to swarms of meteors circling about the\nsun, in the plane of its equator, all the way from its immediate\nneighborhood to a distance exceeding that of the earth. But in neither\nform is the hypothesis satisfactory; there is nothing in the\nappearance of the corona to indicate that it extends even as far as\nthe planet Mercury, while as to meteors, the orbits of the known\nswarms do not accord with the hypothesis, and we have no reason to\nbelieve that clouds of others exist traveling in the part of space\nwhere they would have to be in order to answer the requirements of the\ntheory. The extension of the corona in 1878 did not resemble in its\ntexture the Zodiacal Light.\n\nNow, it has so often happened in the history of science that an\nimportant discovery in one branch has thrown unexpected but most\nwelcome light upon some pending problem in some other branch, that a\nstrong argument might be based upon that fact alone against the too\nexclusive devotion of many investigators to the narrow lines of their\nown particular specialty; and the Zodiacal Light affords a case in\npoint, when it is considered in connection with recent discoveries in\nchemistry and physics. From the fact that atoms are compound bodies\nmade up of corpuscles at least a thousand times smaller than the\nsmallest known atom -- a fact which astounded most men of science when\nit was announced a few years ago -- a new hypothesis has been\ndeveloped concerning the nature of the Zodiacal Light (as well as\nother astronomical riddles), and this hypothesis comes not from an\nastronomer, but from a chemist and physicist, the Swede, Svante\nArrhenius. In considering an outline of this new hypothesis we need\nneither accept nor reject it; it is a case rather for suspension of\njudgment.\n\nTo begin with, it carries us back to the ``pressure of light''\nmentioned in the preceding chapter. The manner in which this pressure\nis believed generally to act was there sufficiently explained, and it\nonly remains to see how it is theoretically extended to the particles\nof matter supposed to constitute the Zodiacal Light. We know that\ncorpuscles, or ``fragments of atoms'' negatively electrified, are\ndischarged from hot bodies. Streams of these ``ions'' pour from many\nflames and from molten metals; and the impact of the cathode and\nultra-violet rays causes them to gush even from cold bodies. In the\nvast laboratory of the sun it is but reasonable to suppose that\nsimilar processes are taking place. ``As a very hot metal emits these\ncorpuscles,'' says Prof. J. J. Thomson, ``it does not seem an\nimprobable hypothesis that they are emitted by that very hot body, the\nsun.'' Let it be assumed, then, that the sun does emit them; what\nhappens next? Negatively charged corpuscles, it is known, serve as\nnuclei to which particles of matter in the ordinary state are\nattracted, and it is probable that those emitted from the sun\nimmediately pick up loads in this manner and so grow in bulk. If they\ngrow large enough the gravitation of the sun draws them back, and they\nproduce a negative charge in the solar atmosphere. But it is probable\nthat many of the particles do not attain the critical size which,\naccording to the principles before explained, would enable the\ngravitation of the sun to retain them in opposition to the pressure of\nthe waves of light, and with these particles the light pressure is\ndominant. Clouds of them may be supposed to be continually swept away\nfrom the sun into surrounding space, moving mostly in or near the\nplane of the solar equator, where the greatest activity, as indicated\nby sunspots and related phenomena, is taking place. As they pass\noutward into space many of them encounter the earth. If the earth,\nlike the moon, had no atmosphere the particles would impinge directly\non its surface, giving it a negative electric charge. But the presence\nof the atmosphere changes all that, for the first of the flying\nparticles that encounter it impart to it their negative electricity,\nand then, since like electric charges repel like, the storm of\nparticles following will be sheered off from the earth, and will\nstream around it in a maze of hyperbolic paths. Those that continue on\ninto space beyond the earth may be expected to continue picking up\nwandering particles of matter until their bulk has become so great\nthat the solar attraction prevails again over the light pressure\nacting upon them, and they turn again sunward. Passing the earth on\ntheir return they will increase the amount of dust-clouds careering\nround it; and these will be further increased by the action of the\nultra-violet rays of the sunlight causing particles to shoot radially\naway from the earth when the negative charge of the upper atmosphere\nhas reached a certain amount, which particles, although starting\nsunward, will be swept back to the earth with the oncoming streams. As\nthe final result of all this accumulation of flying and gyrating\nparticles in the earth's neighborhood, we are told that the latter\nmust be transformed into the semblance of a gigantic solid-headed\ncomet provided with streaming tails, the longest of them stretching\naway from the direction of the sun, while another shorter one extends\ntoward the sun. This shorter tail is due to the particles that we have\njust spoken of as being driven sunward from the earth by the action of\nultra-violet light. No doubt this whole subject is too technical for\npopular statement; but at any rate the general reader can understand\nthe picturesque side of the theory, for its advocates assure us that\nif we were on the moon we would doubtless be able to see the\ncomet-like tails of the earth, and then we could appreciate the part\nthat they play in producing the phenomenon of the Zodiacal Light.\n\nThat the Light as we see it could be produced by the reflection of\nsunlight from swarms of particles careering round the earth in the\nmanner supposed by Arrhenius' hypothesis is evident enough; and it\nwill be observed that the new theory, after all, is only another\nvariant of the older one which attributes the Zodiacal Light to an\nextension of the solar corona. But it differs from the older theory in\noffering an explanation of the manner in which the extension is\neffected, and it differentiates between the corona proper and the\nstreams of negative particles shot away from the sun. In its details\nthe hypothesis of Arrhenius also affords an explanation of many\npeculiarities of the Zodiacal Light, such as that it is confined to\nthe neighborhood of the ecliptic, and that it is stronger on the side\nof the earth which is just turning away from a position under the sun\nthan on the other side; but it would carry us beyond our limits to go\ninto these particulars. The Gegenschein, according to this theory, is\na part of the same phenomenon as the Zodiacal Light, for by the laws\nof perspective it is evident that the reflection from the streams of\nparticles situated at a point directly opposite to the sun would be at\na maximum, and this is the place which the Gegenschein occupies. Apart\nfrom its geometrical relations to the position of the sun, the\nvariability of the Zodiacal Light appears to affirm its solar\ndependence, and this too would be accounted for by Arrhenius'\nhypothesis better than by the old theory of coronal extension. The\namount of corpuscular discharge from the sun must naturally be\ngoverned by the state of relative activity or inactivity of the\nlatter, and this could not but be reflected in the varying splendor of\nthe Zodiacal Light. But much more extended study than has yet been\ngiven to the subject will be required before we can feel that we know\nwith reasonable certainty what this mysterious phenomenon really is.\nBy the hypothesis of Arrhenius every planet that has an atmosphere\nmust have a Zodiacal Light attending it, but the phenomenon is too\nfaint for us to be able to see it in the case, for instance, of Venus,\nwhose atmosphere is very abundant. The moon has no corresponding\n``comet's tail'' because, as already explained, of the lack of a lunar\natmosphere to repel the streams by becoming itself electrified; but if\nthere were a lunar Zodiacal Light, no doubt we could see it because of\nthe relative nearness of our satellite.\n\nMarvels of the Aurora\n\nOne of the most vivid recollections of my early boyhood is that of\nseeing my father return hastily into the house one evening and call\nout to the family: ``Come outside and look at the sky!'' Ours was a\ncountry house situated on a commanding site, and as we all emerged\nfrom the doorway we were dumbfounded to see the heavens filled with\npale flames which ran licking and quivering over the stars. Instantly\nthere sprang into my terrified mind the recollection of an awful\ndescription of ``the Day of Judgment'' (the Dies Ir\u00e6), which I had\nheard with much perturbation of spirit in the Dutch Reformed church\nfrom the lips of a tall, dark-browed, dreadfully-in-earnest preacher\nof the old-fashioned type. My heart literally sank at sight of the\nspectacle, for it recalled the preacher's very words; it was just as\nhe had said it would be, and it needed the assured bearing of my\nelders finally to convince me that\n\n  That Day of Wrath, O dreadful day,\n  When Heaven and Earth shall pass away,\n  As David and the Sibyl say\n\nhad not actually come upon us. And even the older members of the\nhousehold were not untouched with misgivings when menacing spots of\ncrimson appeared, breaking out now here, now there, in the shuddering\nsky. Toward the north the spectacle was appalling. A huge arch spanned\nan unnaturally dark segment resting on the horizon, and above this\narch sprang up beams and streamers in a state of incessant agitation,\nsometimes shooting up to the zenith with a velocity that took one's\nbreath, and sometimes suddenly falling into long ranks, and marching,\nmarching, marching, like an endless phalanx of fiery specters, and\nmoving, as I remember, always from east to west. The absolute silence\nwith which these mysterious evolutions were performed and the\nquavering reflections which were thrown upon the ground increased the\nawfulness of the exhibition. Occasionally enormous curtains of lambent\nflame rolled and unrolled with a majestic motion, or were shaken to\nand fro as if by a mighty, noiseless wind. At times, too, a sudden\nbillowing rush would be made toward the zenith, and for a minute the\nsky overhead would glow so brightly that the stars seemed to have been\nconsumed. The spectacle continued with varying intensity for hours.\n\nThis exhibition occurred in Central New York, a latitude in which the\nAurora Borealis is seldom seen with so much splendor. I remember\nanother similar one seen from the city of New York in November, 1882.\nOn this last occasion some observers saw a great upright beam of light\nwhich majestically moved across the heavens, stalking like an\napparition in the midst of the auroral pageant, of whose general\nmovements it seemed to be independent, maintaining always its upright\nposture, and following a magnetic parallel from east to west. This\nmysterious beam was seen by no less than twenty-six observers in\ndifferent parts of the country, and a comparison of their observations\nled to a curious calculation indicating that the apparition was about\none hundred and thirty-three miles tall and moved at the speed of ten\nmiles per second!\n\nBut, as everybody knows, it is in the Arctic regions that the Aurora,\nor the ``Northern Lights,'' can best be seen. There, in the long polar\nnight, when for months together the sun does not rise, the strange\ncoruscations in the sky often afford a kind of spectral daylight in\nunison with the weird scenery of the world of ice. The pages in the\nnarratives of Arctic exploration that are devoted to descriptions of\nthe wonderful effects of the Northern Lights are second to none that\nman has ever penned in their fascination. The lights, as I have\nalready intimated, display astonishing colors, particularly shades of\nred and green, as they flit from place to place in the sky. The\ndiscovery that the magnetic needle is affected by the Aurora,\nquivering and darting about in a state of extraordinary excitement\nwhen the lights are playing in the sky, only added to the mystery of\nthe phenomenon until its electro-magnetic nature had been established.\nThis became evident as soon as it was known that the focus of the\ndisplays was the magnetic pole; and when the far South was visited the\nAurora Australis was found, having its center at the South Magnetic\nPole. Then, if not before, it was clear that the earth was a great\nglobular magnet, having its poles of opposite magnetism, and that the\nauroral lights, whatever their precise cause might be, were\nmanifestations of the magnetic activity of our planet. After the\ninvention of magnetic telegraphy it was found that whenever a great\nAurora occurred the telegraph lines were interrupted in their\noperation, and the ocean cables ceased to work. Such a phenomenon is\ncalled a ``magnetic storm.''\n\nThe interest excited by the Aurora in scientific circles was greatly\nstimulated when, in the last half of the nineteenth century, it was\ndiscovered that it is a phenomenon intimately associated with\ndisturbances on the sun. The ancient ``Zurich Chronicles,'' extending\nfrom the year 1000 to the year 1800, in which both sun-spots visible\nto the naked eye and great displays of the auroral lights were\nrecorded, first set Rudolf Wolf on the track of this discovery. The\nfirst notable proof of the suspected connection was furnished with\ndramatic emphasis by an occurrence which happened on September 1,\n1859. Near noon on that day two intensely brilliant points suddenly\nbroke out in a group of sun-spots which were under observation by Mr\nR. C. Carrington at his observatory at Redhill, England. The points\nremained visible for not more than five minutes, during which interval\nthey moved thirty-five thousand miles across the solar disk. Mr R.\nHodgson happened to see the same phenomenon at his observatory at\nHighgate, and thus all possibility of deception was removed. But\nneither of the startled observers could have anticipated what was to\nfollow, and, indeed, it was an occurrence which has never been\nprecisely duplicated. I quote the eloquent account given by Miss\nClerke in her History of Astronomy During the Nineteenth Century.\n\n  This unique phenomenon seemed as if specially designed to\n  accentuate the inference of a sympathetic relation between the\n  earth and the sun. From August 28 to September 4, 1859, a magnetic\n  storm of unparalleled intensity, extent, and duration was in\n  progress over the entire globe. Telegraphic communication was\n  everywhere interrupted -- except, indeed, that it was in some cases\n  found practicable to work the lines without batteries by the agency\n  of the earth-currents alone; sparks issued from the wires; gorgeous\n  auroras draped the skies in solemn crimson over both hemispheres,\n  and even in the tropics; the magnetic needle lost all trace of\n  continuity in its movements and darted to and fro as if stricken\n  with inexplicable panic. The coincidence was even closer. At the\n  very instant of the solar outburst witnessed by Carrington and\n  Hodgson the photographic apparatus at Kew registered a marked\n  disturbance of all the three magnetic elements; while shortly after\n  the ensuing midnight the electric agitation culminated, thrilling\n  the whole earth with subtle vibrations, and lighting up the\n  atmosphere from pole to pole with coruscating splendors which\n  perhaps dimly recall the times when our ancient planet itself shone\n  as a star.\n\nIf this amazing occurrence stood alone, and as I have already said it\nhas never been exactly duplicated, doubt might be felt concerning some\nof the inferences drawn from it; but in varying forms it has been\nrepeated many times, so that now hardly anyone questions the reality\nof the assumed connection between solar outbursts and magnetic storms\naccompanied by auroral displays on the earth. It is true that the late\nLord Kelvin raised difficulties in the way of the hypothesis of a\ndirect magnetic action of the sun upon the earth, because it seemed to\nhim that an inadmissible quantity of energy was demanded to account\nfor such action. But no calculation like that which he made is final,\nsince all calculations depend upon the validity of the data; and no\nauthority is unshakable in science, because no man can possess\nomniscience. It was Lord Kelvin who, but a few years before the thing\nwas actually accomplished, declared that aerial navigation was an\nimpracticable dream, and demonstrated its impracticability by\ncalculation. However the connection may be brought about, it is as\ncertain as evidence can make it that solar outbursts are coincident\nwith terrestial magnetic disturbances, and coincident in such a way as\nto make the inference of a causal connection irresistible. The sun is\nonly a little more than a hundred times its own diameter away from the\nearth. Why, then, with the subtle connection between them afforded by\nthe ether which conveys to us the blinding solar light and the\nlife-sustaining solar heat, should it be so difficult to believe that\nthe sun's enormous electric energies find a way to us also? No doubt\nthe impulse coming from the sun acts upon the earth after the manner\nof a touch upon a trigger, releasing energies which are already stored\nup in our planet.\n\nBut besides the evidence afforded by such occurrences as have been\nrelated of an intimate connection between solar outbreaks and\nterrestial magnetic flurries, attended by magnificent auroral\ndisplays, there is another line of proof pointing in the same\ndirection. Thus, it is known that the sun-spot period, as remarked in\na preceding chapter, coincides in a most remarkable manner with the\nperiodic fluctuations in the magnetic state of the earth. This\ncoincidence runs into the most astonishing details. For instance, when\nthe sun-spot period shortens, the auroral period shortens to precisely\nthe same extent; as the short sun-spot periods usually bring the most\nintense outbreaks of solar activity, so the corresponding short\nauroral periods are attended by the most violent magnetic storms; a\nsecular period of about two hundred and twenty-two years affecting\nsun-spots is said to have its auroral duplicate; a shorter period of\nfifty-five and a half years, which some observers believe that they\nhave discovered appears also to be common to the two phenomena; and\nyet another ``superposed'' period of about thirty-five years, which\nsome investigators aver exists, affects sun-spots and aurora alike. In\nshort, the coincidences are so numerous and significant that one would\nhave to throw the doctrine of probability to the winds in order to be\nable to reject the conclusion to which they so plainly lead.\n\nBut still the question recurs: How is the influence transmitted? Here\nArrhenius comes once more with his hypothesis of negative corpuscles,\nor ions, driven away from the sun by light-pressure -- a hypothesis\nwhich seems to explain so many things -- and offers it also as an\nexplanation of the way in which the sun creates the Aurora. He would\ngive the Aurora the same lineage with the Zodiacal Light. To\nunderstand the application of this theory we must first recall the\nfact that the earth is a great magnet having its two opposite poles of\nmagnetism, one near the Arctic and the other near the Antarctic\nCircle. Like all magnets, the earth is surrounded with ``lines of\nforce,'' which, after the manner of the curved rays we saw in the\nphotograph of a solar eclipse, start from a pole, rising at first\nnearly vertically, then bend gradually over, passing high above the\nequator, and finally descending in converging sheaves to the opposite\npole. Now the axis of the earth is so placed in space that it lies at\nnearly a right angle to the direction of the sun, and as the streams\nof negatively charged particles come pouring on from the sun (see the\nlast preceding chapter), they arrive in the greatest numbers over the\nearth's equatorial regions. There they encounter the lines of magnetic\nforce at the place where the latter have their greatest elevation\nabove the earth, and where their direction is horizontal to the\nearth's surface. Obeying a law which has been demonstrated in the\nlaboratory, the particles then follow the lines of force toward the\npoles. While they are above the equatorial regions they do not become\nluminescent, because at the great elevation that they there occupy\nthere is virtually no atmosphere; but as they pass on toward the north\nand the south they begin to descend with the lines of force, curving\ndown to meet at the poles; and, encountering a part of the atmosphere\ncomparable in density with what remains in an exhausted Crookes tube,\nthey produce a glow of cathode rays. This glow is conceived to\nrepresent the Aurora, which may consequently be likened to a gigantic\nexhibition of vacuum-tube lights. Anybody who recalls his student days\nin the college laboratory and who has witnessed a display of Northern\nLights will at once recognize the resemblance between them in colors,\nforms, and behavior. This resemblance had often been noted before\nArrhenius elaborated his hypothesis.\n\nWithout intending to treat his interesting theory as more than a\npossibly correct explanation of the phenomena of the Aurora, we may\ncall attention to some apparently confirmatory facts. One of the most\nstriking of these relates to a seasonal variation in the average\nnumber of auror\u00e6. It has been observed that there are more in March\nand September than at any other time of the year, and fewer in June\nand December; moreover (and this is a delicate test as applied to the\ntheory), they are slightly rarer in June than in December. Now all\nthese facts seem to find a ready explanation in the hypothesis of\nArrhenius, thus: (1) The particles issuing from the sun are supposed\nto come principally from the regions whose excitement is indicated by\nthe presence of sun-spots (which accords with Hale's observation that\nsun-spots are columns of ionized vapors), and these regions have a\ndefinite location on either side of the solar equator, seldom\napproaching it nearer than within 5\u00b0 or 10\u00b0 north or south, and never\nextending much beyond 35\u00b0 toward either pole; (2) The equator of the\nsun is inclined about 7\u00b0 to the plane of the earth's orbit, from which\nit results that twice in a year -- viz., in June and December -- the\nearth is directly over the solar equator, and twice a year -- viz., in\nMarch and September -- when it is farthest north or south of the solar\nequator, it is over the inner edge of the sun-spot belts. Since the\ncorpuscles must be supposed to be propelled radially from the sun, few\nwill reach the earth when the latter is over the solar equator in June\nand December, but when it is over, or nearly over, the spot belts, in\nMarch and September, it will be in the line of fire of the more active\nparts of the solar surface, and relatively rich streams of particles\nwill reach it. This, as will be seen from what has been said above, is\nin strict accord with the observed variations in the frequency of\nauror\u00e6. Even the fact that somewhat fewer auror\u00e6 are seen in June than\nin December also finds its explanation in the known fact that the\nearth is about three million miles nearer the sun in the winter than\nin the summer, and the number of particles reaching it will vary, like\nthe intensity of light, inversely as the square of the distance. These\ncoincidences are certainly very striking, and they have a cumulative\nforce. If we accept the theory, it would appear that we ought to\ncongratulate ourselves that the inclination of the sun's equator is so\nslight, for as things stand the earth is never directly over the most\nactive regions of the sun-spots, and consequently never suffers from\nthe maximum bombardment of charged particles of which the sun is\ncapable. Incessant auroral displays, with their undulating draperies,\nflitting colors, and marching columns might not be objectionable from\nthe point of view of picturesqueness, but one magnetic storm of\nextreme intensity following closely upon the heels of another, for\nmonths on end, crazing the magnetic needle and continually putting the\ntelegraph and cable lines out of commission, to say nothing of their\neffect upon ``wireless telegraphy'', would hardly add to the charms of\nterrestrial existence.\n\nOne or two other curious points in connection with Arrhenius'\nhypothesis may be mentioned. First, the number of auror\u00e6, according to\nhis explanation, ought to be greatest in the daytime, when the face of\nthe earth on the sunward side is directly exposed to the atomic\nbombardment. Of course visual observation can give us no information\nabout this, since the light of the Aurora is never sufficiently\nintense to be visible in the presence of daylight, but the records of\nthe magnetic observatories can be, and have been, appealed to for\ninformation, and they indicate that the facts actually accord with the\ntheory. Behind the veil of sunlight in the middle of the afternoon,\nthere is good reason to believe, auroral exhibitions often take place\nwhich would eclipse in magnificence those seen at night if we could\nbehold them. Observation shows, too, that auror\u00e6 are more frequent\nbefore than after midnight, which is just what we should expect if\nthey originate in the way that Arrhenius supposes. Second, the theory\noffers an explanation of the alleged fact that the formation of clouds\nin the upper air is more frequent in years when auror\u00e6 are most\nabundant, because clouds are the result of the condensation of\nmoisture upon floating particles in the atmosphere (in an absolutely\ndustless atmosphere there would be no clouds), and it has been proved\nthat negative ions like those supposed to come from the sun play a\nmaster part in the phenomena of cloud formation.\n\nYet another singular fact, almost mystical in its suggestions, may be\nmentioned. It seems that the dance of the auroral lights occurs most\nfrequently during the absence of the moon from the hemisphere in which\nthey appear, and that they flee, in greater part, to the opposite\nhemisphere when the moon's revolution in an orbit considerably\ninclined to the earth's equator brings her into that where they have\nbeen performing. Arrhenius himself discovered this curious relation of\nauroral frequency to the position of the moon north or south of the\nequator, and he explains it in this way. The moon, like the earth, is\nexposed to the influx of the ions from the sun; but having no\natmosphere, or almost none, to interfere with them, they descend\ndirectly upon her surface and charge her with an electric negative\npotential to a very high degree. In consequence of this she affects\nthe electric state of the upper parts of the earth's atmosphere where\nthey lie most directly beneath her, and thus prevents, to a large\nextent, the negative discharges to which the appearance of the Aurora\nis due. And so ``the extravagant and erring spirit'' of the Aurora\navoids the moon as Hamlet's ghost fled at the voice of the cock\nannouncing the awakening of the god of day.\n\nThere are even other apparent confirmations of the hypothesis, but we\nneed not go into them. We shall, however, find one more application of\nit in the next chapter, for it appears to be a kind of cure-all for\nastronomical troubles; at any rate it offers a conceivable solution of\nthe question, How does the sun manage to transmit its electric\ninfluence to the earth? And this solution is so grandiose in\nconception, and so novel in the mental pictures that it offers, that\nits acceptance would not in the least detract from the impression that\nthe Aurora makes upon the imagination.\n\nStrange Adventures of Comets\n\nThe fears and legends of ancient times before Science was born, and\nthe superstitions of the Dark Ages, sedulously cultivated for\ntheological purposes by monks and priests, have so colored our ideas\nof the influence that comets have had upon the human mind that many\nreaders may be surprised to learn that it was the apparition of a\nwonderful comet, that of 1843, which led to the foundation of our\ngreatest astronomical institution, the Harvard College Observatory. No\ndoubt the comet superstition existed half a century ago, as, indeed,\nit exists yet today, but in this case the marvelous spectacle in the\nsky proved less effective in inspiring terror than in awakening a\ndesire for knowledge. Even in the sixteenth century the views that\nenlightened minds took of comets tended powerfully to inspire popular\nconfidence in science, and Halley's prediction, after seeing and\nstudying the motion of the comet which appeared in 1682, that it would\nprove to be a regular member of the sun's family and would be seen\nreturning after a period of about seventy-six years, together with the\nfulfillment of that prediction, produced a revulsion from the\nsuperstitious notions which had so long prevailed.\n\nThen the facts were made plain that comets are subject to the law of\ngravitation equally with the planets; that there are many which\nregularly return to the neighborhood of the sun (perihelion); and that\nthese travel in orbits differing from those of the planets only in\ntheir greater eccentricity, although they have the peculiarity that\nthey do not, like the planets, all go round the sun in the same\ndirection, and do not keep within the general plane of the planetary\nsystem, but traverse it sometimes from above and sometimes from below.\nOther comets, including most of the ``great'' ones, appear to travel\nin parabolic or, in a few cases, hyperbolic orbits, which, not being\nclosed curves, never bring them back again. But it is not certain that\nthese orbits may not be extremely eccentric ellipses, and that after\nthe lapse of hundreds, or thousands, of years the comets that follow\nthem may not reappear. The question is an interesting one, because if\nall orbits are really ellipses, then all comets must be permanent\nmembers of the solar system, while in the contrary case many of them\nare simply visitors, seen once and never to be seen again. The\nhypothesis that comets are originally interlopers might seem to derive\nsome support from the fact that the certainly periodic ones are\nassociated, in groups, with the great outer planets, whose attraction\nappears to have served as a trap for them by turning them into\nelliptical orbits and thus making them prisoners in the solar system.\nJupiter, owing to his great mass and his commanding situation in the\nsystem, is the chief ``comet-catcher;'' but he catches them not for\nhimself, but for the sun. Yet if comets do come originally from\nwithout the borders of the planetary system, it does not, by any\nmeans, follow that they were wanderers at large in space before they\nyielded to the overmastering attraction of the sun. Investigation of\nthe known cometary orbits, combined with theoretical considerations,\nhas led some astronomers to the conclusion that as the sun travels\nonward through space he ``picks up en route'' cometary masses which,\nwithout belonging strictly to his empire, are borne along in the same\nvast ``cosmical current'' that carries the solar system.\n\nBut while no intelligent person any longer thinks that the appearance\nof a great comet is a token from the heavenly powers of the\napproaching death of a mighty ruler, or the outbreak of a devastating\nwar, or the infliction of a terrible plague upon wicked mankind,\nscience itself has discovered mysteries about comets which are not\nless fascinating because they are more intellectual than the\nirrational fancies that they have displaced. To bring the subject\nproperly before the mind, let us see what the principal phenomena\nconnected with a comet are.\n\nAt the present day comets are ordinarily ``picked up'' with the\ntelescope or the photographic plate before any one except their\ndiscoverer is aware of their existence, and usually they remain so\ninsignificant in appearance that only astronomers ever see them. Yet\nso great is the prestige of the word ``comet'' that the discovery of\none of these inconspicuous wanderers, and its subsequent movements,\nbecome items of the day's news which everybody reads with the feeling,\nperhaps, that at least he knows what is going on in the universe even\nif he doesn't understand it. But a truly great comet presents quite a\ndifferent proposition. It, too, is apt to be detected coming out of\nthe depths of space before the world at large can get a glimpse of it,\nbut as it approaches the sun its aspect undergoes a marvelous change.\nAgitated apparently by solar influence, it throws out a long streaming\ntail of nebulous light, directed away from the sun and looking as if\nblown out like a pennon by a powerful wind. Whatever may be the\nposition of the comet with regard to the sun, as it circles round him\nit continually keeps its tail on the off side. This, as we shall soon\nsee, is a fact of capital importance in relation to the probable\nnature of comets' tails. Almost at the same time that the formation of\nthe tail is observed a remarkable change takes place in the comet's\nhead, which, by the way, is invariably and not merely occasionally its\nmost important part. On approaching the sun the head usually\ncontracts. Coincidently with this contraction a nucleus generally\nmakes its appearance. This is a bright, star-like point in the head,\nand it probably represents the totality of solid matter that the comet\npossesses. But it is regarded as extremely unlikely that even the\nnucleus consists of a uniformly solid mass. If it were such, comets\nwould be far more formidable visitors when they pass near the planets\nthan they have been found to be. The diameter of the nucleus may vary\nfrom a few hundred up to several thousand miles; the heads, on the\naverage, are from twenty-five thousand to one hundred thousand miles\nin diameter, although a few have greatly exceeded these dimensions;\nthat of the comet of 1811, one of the most stupendous ever seen, was a\nmillion and a quarter miles in diameter! As to the tails, not\nwithstanding their enormous length -- some have been more than a\nhundred million miles long -- there is reason to believe that they are\nof extreme tenuity, ``as rare as vacuum.'' The smallest stars have\nbeen seen shining through their most brilliant portions with\nundiminished luster.\n\nAfter the nucleus has been formed it begins to throw out bright jets\ndirected toward the sun. A stream, and sometimes several streams, of\nlight also project sunward from the nucleus, occasionally appearing\nlike a stunted tail directed oppositely to the real tail. Symmetrical\nenvelopes which, seen in section, appear as half circles or parabolas,\nrise sunward from the nucleus, forming a concentric series. The ends\nof these stream backward into the tail, to which they seem to supply\nmaterial. Ordinarily the formation of these ejections and envelopes is\nattended by intense agitation of the nucleus, which twists and turns,\nswinging and gyrating with an appearance of the greatest violence.\nSometimes the nucleus is seen to break up into several parts. The\nentire heads of some comets have been split asunder in passing close\naround the sun; The comet of 1882 retreated into space after its\nperihelion passage with five heads instead of the one that it had\noriginally, and each of these heads had its own tail!\n\nThe possession of the spectroscope has enabled astronomers during\nlater years to study the chemical composition of comets by analyzing\ntheir light. At first the only substances thus discovered in them were\nhydro-carbon compounds, due evidently to the gaseous envelopes in\nwhich some combination of hydrogen with carbon existed. Behind this\ngaseous spectrum was found a faint continuous spectrum ascribed to the\nnucleus, which apparently both reflects the sunlight and gives forth\nthe light of a glowing solid or liquid. Subsequently sodium and iron\nlines were found in cometary spectra. The presence of iron would seem\nto indicate that some of these bodies may be much more massive than\nobservations on their attractive effects have indicated. In some\nrecent comets, such as Morehouse's, in 1908, several lines have been\nfound, the origin of which is unknown.\n\nWithout going back of the nineteenth century we may find records of\nsome of the most extraordinary comets that man has ever looked upon.\nIn 1811, still spoken of as ``the year of the comet,'' because of the\nwonderful vintage ascribed to the skyey visitor, a comet shaped like a\ngigantic sword amazed the whole world, and, as it remained visible for\nseventeen months, was regarded by superstitious persons as a symbol of\nthe fearful happenings of Napoleon's Russian campaign. This comet, the\nextraordinary size of whose head, greatly exceeding that of the sun\nitself, has already been mentioned, was also remarkable for exhibiting\nso great a brilliancy without approaching even to the earth's distance\nfrom the sun. But there was once a comet (and only once -- in the year\n1729) which never got nearer to the sun than four times the distance\nof the earth and yet appeared as a formidable object in the sky. As\nProfessor Young has remarked, ``it must have been an enormous comet to\nbe visible from such a distance.'' And we are to remember that there\nwere no great telescopes in the year 1729. That comet affects the\nimagination like a phantom of space peering into the solar system,\ndisplaying its enormous train afar off (which, if it had approached as\nnear as other comets, would probably have become the celestial wonder\nof all human memory), and then turning away and vanishing in the\ndepths of immensity.\n\nIn 1843 a comet appeared which was so brilliant that it could be seen\nin broad day close beside the sun! This was the first authenticated\ninstance of that kind, but the occurrence was to be repeated, as we\nshall see in a moment, less than forty years later.\n\nThe splendid comet of 1858, usually called Donati's, is remembered by\nmany persons yet living. It was, perhaps, both as seen by the naked\neye and with the telescope, the most beautiful comet of which we have\nany record. It too marked a rich vintage year, still remembered in the\nvineyards of France, where there is a popular belief that a great\ncomet ripens the grape and imparts to the wine a flavor not attainable\nby the mere skill of the cultivator. There are ``comet wines,''\ncarefully treasured in certain cellars, and brought forth only when\ntheir owner wishes to treat his guests to a sip from paradise.\n\nThe year 1861 saw another very remarkable comet, of an aspect\nstrangely vast and diffuse, which is believed to have swept the earth\nwith its immense tail when it passed between us and the sun on the\nnight of June 30th, an event which produced no other known effect than\nthe appearance of an unwonted amount of scattered light in the sky.\n\nThe next very notable comet was the ``Great Southern Comet'' of 1880,\nwhich was not seen from the northern hemisphere. It mimicked the\naspect of the famous comet of 1843, and to the great surprise of\nastronomers appeared to be traveling in the same path. This proved to\nbe the rising of the curtain for an astronomical sensation\nunparalleled in its kind; for two years later another brilliant comet\nappeared, first in the southern hemisphere, and it too followed the\nsame track. The startling suggestion was now made that this comet was\nidentical with those of 1843 and 1880, its return having been hastened\nby the resistance experienced in passing twice through the coronal\nenvelope, and there were some who thought that it would now swing\nswiftly round and then plunge straight into the sun, with consequences\nthat might be disastrous to us on account of the ``flash of heat''\nthat would be produced by the impact. Nervous people were frightened,\nbut observation soon proved that the danger was imaginary, for\nalthough the comet almost grazed the sun, and must have rushed through\ntwo or three million miles of the coronal region, no retardation of\nits immense velocity was perceptible, and it finally passed away in a\ndamaged condition, as before remarked, and has never since appeared.\n\nThen the probable truth was perceived -- viz., that the three comets\n(1843, 1880, and 1882) were not one identical body, but three separate\nones all traveling in the same orbit. It was found, too, that a comet\nseen in 1668 bore similar insignia of relationship. The natural\ninference was that these four bodies had once formed a single mass\nwhich had been split apart by the disruptive action of the sun.\nStrength was lent to this hypothesis by the fact that the comet of\n1882 was apparently torn asunder during its perihelion passage,\nretreating into space in a dissevered state. But Prof. George Forbes\nhas a theory that the splitting of the original cometary mass was\neffected by an unknown planet, probably greater than Jupiter, situated\nat a hundred times the earth's distance from the sun, and revolving in\na period of a thousand years. He supposes that the original comet was\nnot that of 1668, but one seen in 1556, which has since been\n``missing,'' and that its disruption occurred from an encounter with\nthe supposititious planet about the year 1700. Truly from every point\nof view comets are the most extraordinary of adventurers!\n\nThe comet of 1882 was likewise remarkable for being visible, like its\npredecessor of 1843, in full daylight in close proximity to the sun.\nThe story of its detection when almost in contact with the solar disk\nis dramatic. It had been discovered in the southern hemisphere only a\ncouple of weeks before its perihelion, which occurred on September\n17th, and on the forenoon of that day it was seen by Doctor Common in\nEngland, and by Doctor Elkin and Mr Finlay at the Cape of Good Hope,\nalmost touching the sun. It looked like a dazzling white bird with\noutspread wings. The southern observers watched it go right into the\nsun, when it instantly disappeared. What had happened was that the\ncomet in passing its perihelion point had swung exactly between the\nearth and the sun. On the following morning it was seen from all parts\nof the world close by the sun on the opposite side, and it remained\nthus visible for three days, gradually receding from the solar disk.\nIt then became visible for northern observers in the morning sky\nbefore sunrise, brandishing a portentous sword-shaped tail which, if\nit had been in the evening sky, would have excited the wonder of\nhundreds of millions, but situated where it was, comparatively few\never saw it.\n\nThe application of photography to the study of comets has revealed\nmany curious details which might otherwise have escaped detection, or\nat best have remained subject to doubt. It has in particular shown not\nonly the precise form of the tails, but the remarkable vicissitudes\nthat they undergo. Professor Barnard's photographs of Brooks' comet in\n1893 suggested, by the extraordinary changes in the form of the tail\nwhich they revealed, that the comet was encountering a series of\nobstructions in space which bent and twisted its tail into fantastic\nshapes. The reader will observe the strange form into which the tail\nwas thrown on the night of October 21st. A cloud of meteors through\nwhich the comet was passing might have produced such deformations of\nits tail. In the photograph of Daniels' comet of 1907, a curious\nstriping of the tail will be noticed. The short bright streaks seen in\nthe photograph, it may be explained, are the images of stars which are\ndrawn out into lines in consequence of the fact that the photographic\ntelescope was adjusted to follow the motion of the comet while the\nstars remained at rest.\n\nBut the adventures of comets are not confined to possible encounters\nwith unknown obstacles. We have referred to the fact that the great\nplanets, and especially Jupiter, frequently interfere with the motions\nof comets. This interference is not limited to the original alteration\nof their orbits from possible parabolas to ellipses, but is sometimes\nexercised again and again, turning the bewildered comets into\nelliptical paths of all degrees of eccentricity. A famous example of\nthis kind of planetary horse-play is furnished by the story of\nLexell's missing comet. This comet was first seen in 1770.\nInvestigation showed that it was moving in an orbit which should bring\nit back to perihelion every five and a half years; yet it had never\nbeen seen before and, although often searched for, has never been seen\nsince. Laplace and Leverrier proved mathematically that in 1767 it had\napproached so close to Jupiter as to be involved among the orbits of\nhis satellites. What its track had been before is not known, but on\nthat occasion the giant planet seized the interloper, threw it into a\nshort elliptic orbit and sent it, like an arrested vagrant, to receive\nsentence at the bar of the sun. On this journey it passed within less\nthan 1,500,000 miles of the earth. The form of orbit which Jupiter had\nimpressed required, as we have said, its return in about five and a\nhalf years; but soon after 1770 it had the misfortune a second time to\nencounter Jupiter at close range, and he, as if dissatisfied with the\nleniency of the sun, or indignant at the stranger's familiarity,\nseized the comet and hurled it out of the system, or at any rate so\nfar away that it has never since been able to rejoin the family circle\nthat basks in the immediate rays of the solar hearth. Nor is this the\nonly instance in which Jupiter has dealt summarily with small comets\nthat have approached him with too little deference.\n\nThe function which Jupiter so conspicuously fulfills as master of the\nhounds to the sun is worth considering a little more in detail. To\nchange the figure, imagine the sun in its voyage through space to be\nlike a majestic battleship surrounded by its scouts. Small vessels\n(the comets, as they are overhauled by the squadron, are taken in\ncharge by the scouts, with Jupiter for their chief, and are forced to\naccompany the fleet, but not all are impressed. If a strange comet\nundertakes to run across Jupiter's bows the latter brings it to, and\nmakes prize of it by throwing it into a relatively small ellipse with\nthe sun for its focus. Thenceforth, unless, as happened to the unhappy\ncomet of Lexell, it encounters Jupiter again in such a way as to be\ndiverted by him into a more distant orbit, it can never get away.\nAbout thirty comets are now known to have thus been captured by the\ngreat planet, and they are called ``Jupiter's Comet Family.'' But, on\nthe other hand, if a wandering comet crosses the wake of the chief\nplanetary scout the latter simply drives it away by accelerating its\nmotion and compels it to steer off into open space. The transformation\nof comets into meteors will be considered in the next chapter, but\nhere, in passing, mention may be made of the strange fate of one\nmember of Jupiter's family, Biela's comet, which, having become over\nbold in its advances to its captor, was, after a few revolutions in is\nimpressed orbit, torn to pieces and turned into a flock of meteors.\n\nAnd now let us return to the mystery of comets' tails. That we are\nfully justified in speaking of the tails of comets as mysterious is\nproved by the declaration of Sir John Herschel, who averred, in so\nmany words, that ``there is some profound secret and mystery of nature\nconcerned in this phenomenon,'' and this profound secret and mystery\nhas not yet been altogether cleared up. Nevertheless, the\nall-explaining hypothesis of Arrhenius offers us once more a certain\namount of aid. Comets' tails, Arrhenius assures us, are but another\nresult of the pressure of light. The reader will recall the\napplications of this theory to the Zodiacal Light and the Aurora. In\nthe form in which we now have to deal with it, the supposition is made\nthat as a comet approaches the sun eruptions of vapor, due to the\nsolar heat, occur in its nucleus. These are naturally most active on\nthe side which is directly exposed to the sun, whence the appearance\nof the immense glowing envelopes that surround the nucleus on the\nsunward side. Among the particles of hydro-carbon, and perhaps solid\ncarbon in the state of fine dust, which are thus set free there will\nbe many whose size is within the critical limit which enables the\nlight-waves from the sun to drive them away. Clouds of such particles,\nthen, will stream off behind the advancing comet, producing the\nappearance of a tail. This accounts for the fact that the tails of\ncomets are always directed away from the sun, and it also explains the\nvarying forms of the tails and the extraordinary changes that they\nundergo. The speed of the particles driven before the light-waves must\ndepend upon their size and weight, the lightest of a given size\ntraveling the most swiftly. By accretion certain particles might grow,\nthus losing velocity and producing the appearance of bunches in the\ntail, such as have been observed. The hypothesis also falls in with\nthe researches of Bredichin, who has divided the tails of comets into\nthree principal classes -- viz.: (1) Those which appear as long,\nstraight rays; (2) Those which have the form of curved plumes or\nscimitars; (3) Those which are short, brushy, and curved sharply\nbackward along the comet's path. In the first type he calculates the\nrepulsive force at from twelve to fifteen times the force of gravity;\nin the second at from two to four times; and in the third at about one\nand a half times. The straight tails he ascribes to hydrogen because\nthe hydrogen atom is the lightest known; the sword-shaped tails to\nhydro-carbons; and the stumpy tails to vaporized iron. It will be seen\nthat, if the force driving off the tails is that which Arrhenius\nassumes it to be, the forms of those appendages would accord with\nthose that Bredichin's theory calls for. At the same time we have an\nexplanation of the multiple tails with which some comets have adorned\nthemselves. The comet of 1744, for instance, had at one time no less\nthan seven tails spread in a wide curved brush behind it. Donati's\ncomet of 1858 also had at least two tails, the principal one\nsword-shaped and the other long, narrow, and as straight as a rule.\nAccording to Bredichin, the straight tail must have been composed of\nhydrogen, and the other of some form of hydro-carbon whose atoms are\nheavier than those of hydrogen, and, consequently, when swept away by\nthe storm of light-waves, followed a curvature depending upon the\nresultant of the forces operating upon them. The seven tails of the\ncomet of 1744 presented a kind of diagram graphically exhibiting its\ncomplex composition, and, if we knew a little more about the\nconstituents of a comet, we might be able to say from the amount of\ncurvature of the different tails just what were the seven substances\nof which that comet consisted.\n\nIf these theories seem to the reader fantastic, at any rate they are\nno more fantastic than the phenomena that they seek to explain.\n\nMeteors, Fire-Balls, and Meteorites\n\nOne of the most terrorizing spectacles with which the heavens have\never caused the hearts of men to quake occurred on the night of\nNovember 13, 1833. On that night North America, which faced the storm,\nwas under a continual rain of fire from about ten o'clock in the\nevening until daybreak.\n\nThe fragments of a comet had struck the earth.\n\nBut the meaning of what had happened was not discovered until long\nafterward. To the astronomers who, with astonishment not less than\nthat of other people, watched the wonderful scene, it was an\nunparalleled ``shower of meteors.'' They did not then suspect that\nthose meteors had once formed the head of a comet. Light dawned when,\na year later, Prof. Denison Olmsted, of Yale College, demonstrated\nthat the meteors had all moved in parallel orbits around the sun, and\nthat these orbits intersected that of the earth at the point where our\nplanet happened to be on the memorable night of November 13th.\nProfessor Olmsted even went so far as to suggest that the cloud of\nmeteors that had encountered the earth might form a diffuse comet; but\nfull recognition of the fact that they were cometary d\u00e9bris came\nlater, as the result of further investigation. The key to the secret\nwas plainly displayed in the spectacle itself, and was noticed without\nbeing understood by thousands of the terror-stricken beholders. It was\nan umbrella of fire that had opened overhead and covered the heavens;\nin other words, the meteors all radiated from a particular point in\nthe constellation Leo, and, being countless as the snowflakes in a\nwinter tempest, they ribbed the sky with fiery streaks. Professor\nOlmsted showed that the radiation of the meteors from a fixed point\nwas an effect of perspective, and in itself a proof that they were\nmoving in parallel paths when they encountered the earth. The fact was\nnoted that there had been a similar, but incomparably less brilliant,\ndisplay of meteors on the same day of November, 1832, and it was\nrightly concluded that these had belonged to the same stream, although\nthe true relationship of the phenomena was not immediately\napprehended. Olmsted ascribed to the meteors a revolution about the\nsun once in every six months, bringing them to the intersection of\ntheir orbit with that of the earth every November 13th; but later\ninvestigators found that the real period was about thirty-three and\none-quarter years, so that the great displays were due three times in\na century, and their return was confidently predicted for the year\n1866. The appearance of the meteors in 1832, a year before the great\ndisplay, was ascribed to the great length of the stream which they\nformed in space -- so great that they required more than two years to\ncross the earth's orbit. In 1832 the earth had encountered a\nrelatively rare part of the stream, but in 1833, on returning to the\ncrossing-place, it found there the richest part of the stream pouring\nacross its orbit. This explanation also proved to be correct, and the\npredicted return in 1866 was duly witnessed, although the display was\nmuch less brilliant than in 1833. It was followed by another in 1867.\n\nIn the mean time Olmsted's idea of a cometary relationship of the\nmeteors was demonstrated to be correct by the researches of\nSchiaparelli and others, who showed that not only the November\nmeteors, but those of August, which are seen more or less abundantly\nevery year, traveled in the tracks of well-known comets, and had\nundoubtedly an identical origin with those comets. In other words the\ncomets and the meteor-swarms were both remnants of original masses\nwhich had probably been split up by the action of the sun, or of some\nplanet to which they had made close approaches. The annual periodicity\nof the August meteors was ascribed to the fact that the separation had\ntaken place so long ago that the meteors had become distributed all\naround the orbit, in consequence of which the earth encountered some\nof them every year when it arrived at the crossing-point. Then\nLeverrier showed that the original comet associated with the November\nmeteors was probably brought into the system by the influence of the\nplanet Uranus in the year 126 of the Christian era. Afterward\nAlexander Herschel identified the tracks of no less than seventy-six\nmeteor-swarms (most of them inconspicuous) with those of comets. The\nstill more recent researches of Mr W. F. Denning make it probable that\nthere are no meteors which do not belong to a flock or system probably\nformed by the disintegration of a cometary mass; even the apparently\nsporadic ones which shoot across the sky, ``lost souls in the night,''\nbeing members of flocks which have become so widely scattered that the\nearth sometimes takes weeks to pass through the region of space where\ntheir paths lie.\n\nThe November meteors should have exhibited another pair of spectacles\nin 1899 and 1900, and their failure to do so caused at first much\ndisappointment, until it was made plain that a good reason existed for\ntheir absence. It was found that after their last appearance, in 1867,\nthey had been disturbed in their movements by the planets Jupiter and\nSaturn, whose attractions had so shifted the position of their orbit\nthat it no longer intersected that of the earth, as it did before.\nWhether another planetary interference will sometime bring the\nprincipal mass of the November meteors back to the former point of\nintersection with the earth's orbit is a question for the future to\ndecide. It would seem that there may be several parallel streams of\nthe November meteors, and that some of them, like those of August, are\ndistributed entirely around the orbit, so that every mid-November we\nsee a few of them.\n\nWe come now to a very remarkable example of the disintegration of a\ncomet and the formation of a meteor-stream. In 1826 Biela, of\nJosephstadt, Austria, discovered a comet to which his name was given.\nCalculation showed that it had an orbital period of about six and a\nhalf years, belonging to Jupiter's ``family.'' On one of its returns,\nin 1846, it astonished its watchers by suddenly splitting in two. The\ntwo comets thus formed out of one separated to a distance of about one\nhundred and sixty thousand miles, and then raced side by side,\nsometimes with a curious ligature connecting them, like Siamese twins,\nuntil they disappeared together in interplanetary space. In 1852 they\ncame back, still nearly side by side, but now the distance between\nthem had increased to a million and a quarter of miles. After that, at\nevery recurrence of their period, astronomers looked for them in vain,\nuntil 1872, when an amazing thing happened. On the night of November\n28th, when the earth was crossing the plane of the orbit of the\nmissing comet, a brilliant shower of meteors burst from the northern\nsky, traveling nearly in the track which the comet should have\npursued. The astronomers were electrified. Klinkerfues, of G\u00f6ttingen,\ntelegraphed to Pogson, of Madras: ``Biela touched earth; search near\nTheta Centauri.'' Pogson searched in the place indicated and saw a\ncometary mass retreating into the southern heavens, where it was soon\nswallowed from sight!\n\nSince then the Biela meteors have been among the recognized periodic\nspectacles of the sky, and few if any doubt that they represent a\nportion of the missing comet whose disintegration began with the\nseparation into two parts in 1846. The comet itself has never since\nbeen seen. The first display of these meteors, sometimes called the\n``Andromedes,'' because they radiate from the constellation Andromeda,\nwas remarkable for the great brilliancy of many of the fire-balls that\nshot among the shower of smaller sparks, some of which were described\nas equaling the full moon in size. None of them is known to have\nreached the earth, but during the display of the same meteors in 1885\na meteoric mass fell at Mazapil in Northern Mexico (it is now in the\nMuseum at Vienna), which many have thought may actually be a piece of\nthe original comet of Biela. This brings us to the second branch of\nour subject.\n\nMore rare than meteors or falling stars, and more startling, except\nthat they never appear in showers, are the huge balls of fire which\noccasionally dart through the sky, lighting up the landscapes beneath\nwith their glare, leaving trains of sparks behind them, often\nproducing peals of thunder when they explode, and in many cases\nfalling upon the earth and burying themselves from a few inches to\nseveral feet in the soil, from which, more than once, they have been\npicked up while yet hot and fuming. These balls are sometimes called\nbolides. They are not really round in shape, although they often look\nso while traversing the sky, but their forms are fragmentary, and\noccasionally fantastic. It has been supposed that their origin is\ndifferent from that of the true meteors; it has even been conjectured\nthat they may have originated from the giant volcanoes of the moon or\nhave been shot out from the sun during some of the tremendous\nexplosions that accompany the formation of eruptive prominences. By\nthe same reasoning some of them might be supposed to have come from\nsome distant star. Others have conjectured that they are wanderers in\nspace, of unknown origin, which the earth encounters as it journeys\non, and Lord Kelvin made a suggestion which has become classic because\nof its imaginative reach -- viz., that the first germs of life may\nhave been brought to the earth by one of these bodies, ``a fragment of\nan exploded world.''\n\nIt is a singular fact that astronomers and scientific men in general\nwere among the last to admit the possibility of solid masses falling\nfrom the sky. The people had believed in the reality of such phenomena\nfrom the earliest times, but the savants shook their heads and talked\nof superstition. This was the less surprising because no\nscientifically authenticated instance of such an occurrence was known,\nand the stones popularly believed to have fallen from the sky had\nbecome the objects of worship or superstitious reverence, a fact not\ncalculated to recommend them to scientific credence. The celebrated\n``black stone'' suspended in the Kaaba at Mecca is one of these\nreputed gifts from heaven; the ``Palladium'' of ancient Troy was\nanother; and a stone which fell near Ensisheim, in Germany, was placed\nin a church as an object to be religiously venerated. Many legends of\nfalling stones existed in antiquity, some of them curiously\ntransfigured by the imagination, like the ``Lion of the\nPeloponnesus,'' which was said to have sprung down from the sky upon\nthe Isthmus of Corinth. But near the beginning of the nineteenth\ncentury, in 1803, a veritable shower of falling stones occurred at\nL'Aigle, in Northern France, and this time astronomers took note of\nthe phenomenon and scientifically investigated it. Thousands of the\nstrange projectiles came from the sky on this occasion, and were\nscattered over a wide area of country, and some buildings were hit.\nFour years later another shower of stones occurred at Weston, Conn.,\nnumbering thousands of individuals. The local alarm created in both\ncases was great, as well it might be, for what could be more\nintimidating than to find the blue vault of heaven suddenly hurling\nsolid missiles at the homes of men? After these occurrences it was\nimpossible for the most skeptical to doubt any longer, and the regular\nstudy of ``aerolites,'' or ``meteorites,'' began.\n\nOne of the first things recognized was the fact that fire-balls are\nsolid meteorites in flight, and not gaseous exhalations in the air, as\nsome had assumed. They burn in the air during their flight, and\nsometimes, perhaps, are entirely consumed before reaching the ground.\nTheir velocity before entering the earth's atmosphere is equal to that\nof the planets in their orbits -- viz., from twenty to thirty miles\nper second -- a fact which proves that the sun is the seat of the\ncentral force governing them. Their burning in the air is not\ndifficult to explain; it is the heat of friction which so quickly\nbrings them to incandescence. Calculation shows that a body moving\nthrough the air at a velocity of about a mile per second will be\nbrought, superficially, to the temperature of ``red heat'' by friction\nwith the atmosphere. If its velocity is twenty miles per second the\ntemperature will become thousands of degrees. This is the state of\naffairs with a meteorite rushing into the earth's atmosphere; its\nsurface is liquefied within a few seconds after the friction begins to\nact, and the melted and vaporized portion of its mass is swept\nbackward, forming the train of sparks that follows every great\nfire-ball. However, there is one phenomenon connected with the trains\nof meteorites which has never been satisfactorily explained: they\noften persist for long periods of time, drifting and turning with the\nwind, but not ceasing to glow with a phosphorescent luminosity. The\nquestion is, Whence comes this light? It must be light without heat,\nsince the fine dust or vapor of which the train can only consist would\nnot retain sufficient heat to render it luminous for so long a time.\nAn extremely remarkable incident of this kind occurred on February 22,\n1909, when an immense fire-ball that passed over southern England left\na train that remained visible during two hours, assuming many curious\nshapes as it was drifted about by currents in the air.\n\nBut notwithstanding the enormous velocity with which meteorites enter\nthe air they are soon slowed down to comparatively moderate speed, so\nthat when they disappear they are usually traveling not faster than a\nmile a second. The courses of many have been traced by observers\nsituated along their track at various points, and thus a knowledge has\nbeen obtained of their height above the ground during their flight and\nof the length of their visible courses. They generally appear at an\nelevation of eighty or a hundred miles, and are seldom visible after\nhaving descended to within five miles of the ground, unless the\nobserver happens to be near the striking-point, when he may actually\nwitness the fall. Frequently they burst while high in the air and\ntheir fragments are scattered like shrapnel over the surface of the\nground, sometimes covering an area of several square miles, but of\ncourse not thickly; different fragments of the same meteorite may\nreach the ground at points several miles apart. The observed length of\ntheir courses in the atmosphere varies from fifty to five hundred\nmiles. If they continued a long time in flight after entering the air,\neven the largest of them would probably be consumed to the last scrap,\nbut their fiery career is so short on account of their great speed\nthat the heat does not have time to penetrate very deeply, and some\nthat have been picked up immediately after their fall have been found\ncold as ice within. Their size after reaching the ground is variable\nwithin wide limits; some are known which weigh several tons, but the\ngreat majority weigh only a few pounds and many only a few ounces.\n\nMeteorites are of two kinds: stony meteorites and iron meteorites. The\nformer outnumber the latter twenty to one; but many stone meteorites\ncontain grains of iron. Nickel is commonly found in iron meteorites,\nso that it might be said that that redoubtable alloy nickel-steel is\nof cosmical invention. Some twenty-five chemical elements have been\nfound in meteorites, including carbon and the ``sun-metal,'' helium.\nThe presence of the latter is certainly highly suggestive in\nconnection with the question of the origin of meteorites. The iron\nmeteorites, besides metallic iron and nickel, of which they are almost\nentirely composed, contain hydrogen, helium, and carbonic oxide, and\nabout the only imaginable way in which these gases could have become\nabsorbed in the iron would be through the immersion of the latter\nwhile in a molten or vaporized state in a hot and dense atmosphere\ncomposed of them, a condition which we know to exist only in the\nenvelopes of the sun and the stars.\n\nThe existence of carbon in the Canyon Diablo iron meteorites is\nattended by a circumstance of the most singular character -- a very\n``fairy tale of science.'' In some cases the carbon has become\ndiamond! These meteoric diamonds are very small; nevertheless, they\nare true diamonds, resembling in many ways the little black gems\nproduced by Moissan's method with the aid of the electric furnace. The\nfact that they are found embedded in these iron meteorites is another\nargument in favor of the hypothesis of the solar or stellar origin of\nthe latter. To appreciate this it is necessary to recall the way in\nwhich Moissan made his diamonds. It was by a combination of the\neffects of great heat, great pressure, and sudden or rapid superficial\ncooling on a mass of iron containing carbon. When he finally broke\nopen his iron he found it a pudding stuffed with miniature black\ndiamonds. When a fragment of the Canyon Diablo meteoric iron was\npolished in Philadelphia over fifteen years ago it cut the emery-wheel\nto pieces, and examination showed that the damage had been effected by\nmicroscopic diamonds peppered through the mass. How were those\ndiamonds formed? If the sun or Sirius was the laboratory that prepared\nthem, we can get a glimpse at the process of their formation. There is\nplenty of heat, plenty of pressure, and an abundance of vaporized iron\nin the sun and the stars. When a great solar eruption takes place,\nmasses of iron which have absorbed carbon may be shot out with a\nvelocity which forbids their return. Plunged into the frightful cold\nof space, their surfaces are quickly cooled, as Moissan cooled his\nprepared iron by throwing it into water, and thus the requisite stress\nis set up within, and, as the iron solidifies, the included carbon\ncrystallizes into diamonds. Whether this explanation has a germ of\ntruth in it or not, at any rate it is evident that iron meteorites\nwere not created in the form in which they come to us; they must once\nhave been parts of immeasurably more massive bodies than themselves.\n\nThe fall of meteorites offers an appreciable, though numerically\ninsignificant, peril to the inhabitants of the earth. Historical\nrecords show perhaps three or four instances of people being killed by\nthese bodies. But for the protection afforded by the atmosphere, which\nacts as a very effective shield, the danger would doubtless be very\nmuch greater. In the absence of an atmosphere not only would more\nmeteorites reach the ground, but their striking force would be\nincomparably greater, since, as we have seen, the larger part of their\noriginal velocity is destroyed by the resistance of the air. A\nmeteorite weighing many tons and striking the earth with a velocity of\ntwenty or thirty miles per second, would probably cause frightful\nhavoc.\n\nIt is a singular fact that recent investigations seem to have proved\nthat an event of this kind actually happened in North America --\nperhaps not longer than a thousand or two thousand years ago. The\nscene of the supposed catastrophe is in northern central Arizona, at\nCoon Butte, where there is a nearly circular crater in the middle of a\ncircular elevation or small mountain. The crater is somewhat over four\nthousand feet in diameter, and the surrounding rim, formed of upturned\nstrata and ejected rock fragments, rises at its highest point one\nhundred and sixty feet above the plain. The crater is about six\nhundred feet in depth -- that is, from the rim to the visible floor or\nbottom of the crater. There is no evidence that volcanic action has\never taken place in the immediate neighborhood of Coon Butte. The rock\nin which the crater has been made is composed of horizontal sandstone\nand limestone strata. Between three hundred and four hundred million\ntons of rock fragments have been detached, and a large portion hurled\nby some cause out of the crater. These fragments lie concentrically\ndistributed around the crater, and in large measure form the elevation\nknown as Coon Butte. The region has been famous for nearly twenty\nyears on account of the masses of meteoric iron found scattered about\nand known as the ``Canyon Diablo'' meteorites. It was one of these\nmasses, which consist of nickel-iron containing a small quantity of\nplatinum, and of which in all some ten tons have been recovered for\nsale to the various collectors throughout the world, that as before\nmentioned destroyed the grinding-tool at Philadelphia through the\ncutting power of its embedded diamonds. These meteoric irons are\nscattered about the crater-hill, in concentric distribution, to a\nmaximum distance of about five miles. When the suggestion was first\nmade in 1896 that a monster meteorite might have created by its fall\nthis singular lone crater in stratified rocks, it was greeted with\nincredulous smiles; but since then the matter has assumed a different\naspect. The Standard Iron Company, formed by Messrs. D. M. Barringer,\nB. C. Tilghman, E. J. Bennitt, and S. J. Holsinger, having become, in\n1903, the owner of this freak of nature, sunk shafts and bored holes\nto a great depth in the interior of the crater, and also trenched the\nslopes of the mountain, and the result of their investigations has\nproved that the meteoric hypothesis of origin is correct. (See the\npapers published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences\nof Philadelphia, December, 1905, wherein it is proved that the United\nStates Geological Survey was wrong in believing this crater to have\nbeen due to a steam explosion. Since that date there has been\ndiscovered a great amount of additional confirmatory proof). Material\nof unmistakably meteoric origin was found by means of the drills,\nmixed with crushed rock, to a depth of six hundred to seven hundred\nfeet below the floor of the crater, and a great deal of it has been\nfound admixed with the ejected rock fragments on the outer slopes of\nthe mountain, absolutely proving synchronism between the two events,\nthe formation of this great crater and the falling of the meteoric\niron out of the sky. The drill located in the bottom of the crater was\nsent, in a number of cases, much deeper (over one thousand feet) into\nunaltered horizontal red sandstone strata, but no meteoric material\nwas found below this depth (seven hundred feet, or between eleven and\ntwelve hundred feet below the level of the surrounding plain), which\nhas been assumed as being about the limit of penetration. It is not\npossible to sink a shaft at present, owing to the water which has\ndrained into the crater, and which forms, with the finely pulverized\nsandstone, a very troublesome quicksand encountered at about two\nhundred feet below the visible floor of the crater. As soon as this\nwater is removed by pumping it will be easy to explore the depths of\nthe crater by means of shafts and drifts. The rock strata (sandstone\nand limestone) of which the walls consist present every appearance of\nhaving been violently upturned by a huge body penetrating the earth\nlike a cannon-ball. The general aspect of the crater strikingly\nresembles the impression made by a steel projectile shot into an\narmor-plate. Mr Tilghman has estimated that a meteorite about five\nhundred feet in diameter and moving with a velocity of about five\nmiles per second would have made just such a perforation upon striking\nrocks of the character of those found at this place. There was some\nfusion of the colliding masses, and the heat produced some steam from\nthe small amount of water in the rocks. As a result there has been\nfound at depth a considerable amount of fused quartz (original\nsandstone), and with it innumerable particles or sparks of fused\nnickel-iron (original meteorite). A projectile of that size\npenetrating eleven to twelve hundred feet into the rocky shell of the\nglobe must have produced a shock which was perceptible several hundred\nmiles away.\n\nThe great velocity ascribed to the supposed meteorite at the moment of\nstriking could be accounted for by the fact that it probably plunged\nnearly vertically downward, for it formed a circular crater in the\nrocky crust of the earth. In that case it would have been less\nretarded by the resistance of the atmosphere than are meteorites which\nenter the air at a lower angle and shoot ahead hundreds of miles until\nfriction has nearly destroyed their original motion when they drop\nupon the earth. Some meteoric masses of great size, such as Peary's\niron meteorite found at Cape York, Greenland, and the almost equally\nlarge mass discovered at Bacubirito, Mexico, appear to have penetrated\nbut slightly on striking the earth. This may be explained by supposing\nthat they pursued a long, horizontal course through the air before\nfalling. The result would be that, their original velocity having been\npractically destroyed, they would drop to the ground with a velocity\nnearly corresponding to that which gravity would impart within the\nperpendicular distance of their final fall. A\nsix-hundred-and-sixty-pound meteorite, which fell at Knyahinya,\nHungary, striking at an angle of 27\u00b0 from the vertical, penetrated the\nground to a depth of eleven feet.\n\nIt has been remarked that the Coon Butte meteorite may have fallen not\nlonger ago than a few thousand years. This is based upon the fact that\nthe geological indications favor the supposition that the event did\nnot occur more than five thousand years ago, while on the other hand\nthe rings of growth in the cedar-trees growing on the slopes of the\ncrater show that they have existed there about seven hundred years.\nProf. William H. Pickering has recently correlated this with an\nancient chronicle which states that at Cairo, Egypt, in the year 1029,\n``many stars passed with a great noise.'' He remarks that Cairo is\nabout 100\u00b0, by great circle, from Coon Butte, so that if the meteorite\nthat made the crater was a member of a flock of similar bodies which\nencountered the earth moving in parallel lines, some of them might\nhave traversed the sky tangent to the earth's surface at Cairo. That\nthe spectacle spoken of in the chronicle was caused by meteorites he\ndeems exceedingly probable because of what is said about ``a great\nnoise;'' meteorites are the only celestial phenomena attended with\nperceptible sounds. Professor Pickering conjectures that this supposed\nflock of great meteorites may have formed the nucleus of a comet which\nstruck the earth, and he finds confirmation of the idea in the fact\nthat out of the ten largest meteorites known, no less than seven were\nfound within nine hundred miles of Coon Butte. It would be interesting\nif we could trace back the history of that comet, and find out what\nmalicious planet caught it up in its innocent wanderings and hurled it\nwith so true an aim at the earth! This remarkable crater is one of the\nmost interesting places in the world, for there is absolutely no\nrecord of such a mass, possibly an iron-headed comet, from outer space\nhaving come into collision with our earth. The results of the future\nexploration of the depths of the crater will be awaited with much\ninterest.\n\nThe Wrecking of the Moon\n\nThere are sympathetic moods under whose influence one gazes with a\ncertain poignant tenderness at the worn face of the moon; that little\n``fossil world'' (the child of our mother earth, too) bears such\nterrible scars of its brief convulsive life that a sense of pity is\nawakened by the sight. The moon is the wonder-land of the telescope.\nThose towering mountains, whose ``proud aspiring peaks'' cast\nsilhouettes of shadow that seem drawn with india-ink; those vast\nplains, enchained with gentle winding hills and bordered with giant\nranges; those oval ``oceans,'' where one looks expectant for the flash\nof wind-whipped waves; those enchanting ``bays'' and recesses at the\nseaward feet of the Alps; those broad straits passing between guardian\nheights incomparably mightier than Gibraltar; those locket-like\nvalleys as secluded among their mountains as the Vale of Cashmere;\nthose colossal craters that make us smile at the pretensions of\nVesuvius, Etna, and Cotopaxi; those strange white ways which pass with\nthe unconcern of Roman roads across mountain, gorge, and valley -- all\nthese give the beholder an irresistible impression that it is truly a\nworld into which he is looking, a world akin to ours, and yet no more\nlike our world than Pompeii is like Naples. Its air, its waters, its\nclouds, its life are gone, and only a skeleton remains -- a mute but\neloquent witness to a cosmical tragedy without parallel in the range\nof human knowledge.\n\nOne cannot but regret that the moon, if it ever was the seat of\nintelligent life, has not remained so until our time. Think what the\nconsequences would have been if this other world at our very door had\nbeen found to be both habitable and inhabited! We talk rather airily\nof communicating with Mars by signals; but Mars never approaches\nnearer than 35,000,000 miles, while the moon when nearest is only a\nlittle more than 220,000 miles away. Given an effective magnifying\npower of five thousand diameters, which will perhaps be possible at\nthe mountain observatories as telescopes improve, and we should be\nable to bring the moon within an apparent distance of about forty\nmiles, while the corresponding distance for Mars would be more than\nseven thousand miles. But even with existing telescopic powers we can\nsee details on the moon no larger than some artificial constructions\non the earth. St Peter's at Rome, with the Vatican palace and the\ngreat piazza, if existing on the moon, would unquestionably be\nrecognizable as something else than a freak of nature. Large cities,\nwith their radiating lines of communication, would at once betray\ntheir real character. Cultivated tracts, and the changes produced by\nthe interference of intelligent beings, would be clearly recognizable.\nThe electric illumination of a large town at night would probably be\nmarkedly visible. Gleams of reflected sunlight would come to us from\nthe surfaces of the lakes and oceans, and a huge ``liner'' traversing\na lunar sea could probably be followed by its trail of smoke. As to\ncommunications by ``wireless'' signals, which certain enthusiasts have\nthought of in connection with Mars, in the case of the moon they\nshould be a relatively simple matter, and the feat might actually be\naccomplished. Think what a literature would grow up about the moon if\nit were a living world! Its very differences from the earth would only\naccentuate its interest for us. Night and day on the moon are each two\nweeks in length; how interesting it would be to watch the manner in\nwhich the lunarians dealt with such a situation as that. Lunar and\nterrestrial history would keep step with each other, and we should\nrecord them both. Truly one might well wish to have a neighbor world\nto study; one would feel so much the less alone in space.\n\nIt is not impossible that the moon did at one time have inhabitants of\nsome kind. But, if so, they vanished with the disappearance of its\natmosphere and seas, or with the advent of its cataclysmic age. At the\nbest, its career as a living world must have been brief. If the water\nand air were gradually absorbed, as some have conjectured, by its\ncooling interior rocks, its surface might, nevertheless, have retained\nthem for long ages; but if, as others think, their disappearance was\ndue to the escape of their gaseous molecules in consequence of the\ninability of the relatively small lunar gravitation to retain them,\nthen the final catastrophe must have been as swift as it was\ninevitable. Accepting Darwin's hypothesis, that the moon was separated\nfrom the earth by tidal action while both were yet plastic or\nnebulous, we may reasonably conclude that it began its career with a\ngood supply of both water and air, but did not possess sufficient mass\nto hold them permanently. Yet it may have retained them long enough\nfor life to develop in many forms upon its surface; in fact, there are\nso many indications that air and water have not always been lacking to\nthe lunar world that we are driven to invent theories to explain both\ntheir former presence and their present absence.\n\nBut whatever the former condition of the moon may have been, its\nexisting appearance gives it a resistless fascination, and it bears so\nclearly the story of a vast catastrophe sculptured on its rocky face\nthat the thoughtful observer cannot look upon it without a feeling of\nawe. The gigantic character of the lunar features impresses the\nbeholder not less than the universality of the play of destructive\nforces which they attest. Let us make a few comparisons. Take the\nlunar crater called ``Tycho'', which is a typical example of its kind.\nIn the telescope Tycho appears as a perfect ring surrounding a\ncircular depression, in the center of which rises a group of\nmountains. Its superficial resemblance to some terrestrial volcanic\ncraters is very striking. Vesuvius, seen from a point vertically\nabove, would no doubt look something like that (the resemblance would\nhave been greater when the Monte del Cavallo formed a more complete\ncircuit about the crater cone). But compare the dimensions. The\nremains of the outer crater ring of Vesuvius are perhaps half a mile\nin diameter, while the active crater itself is only two or three\nhundred feet across at the most; Tycho has a diameter of fifty-four\nmiles! The group of relatively insignificant peaks in the center of\nthe crater floor of Tycho is far more massive than the entire mountain\nthat we call Vesuvius. The largest known volcanic crater on the earth,\nAso San, in Japan, has a diameter of seven miles; it would take sixty\ncraters like Aso San to equal Tycho in area! And Tycho, though one of\nthe most perfect, is by no means the largest crater on the moon.\nAnother, called ``Theophilus,'' has a diameter of sixty-four miles,\nand is eighteen thousand feet deep. There are hundreds from ten to\nforty miles in diameter, and thousands from one to ten miles. They are\nso numerous in many places that they break into one another, like the\ncells of a crushed honeycomb.\n\nThe lunar craters differ from those of the earth more fundamentally\nthan in the matter of mere size; they are not situated on the tops of\nmountains. If they were, and if all the proportions were the same, a\ncrater like Tycho might crown a conical peak fifty or one hundred\nmiles high! Instead of being cavities in the summits of mountains, the\nlunar craters are rather gigantic sink-holes whose bottoms in many\ncases lie two or three miles below the general surface of the lunar\nworld. Around their rims the rocks are piled up to a height of from a\nfew hundred to two or three thousand feet, with a comparatively gentle\ninclination, but on the inner side they fall away in gigantic broken\nprecipices which make the dizzy cliffs of the Matterhorn seem but\n``lover's leaps.'' Down they drop, ridge below ridge, crag under crag,\ntottering wall beneath wall, until, in a crater named ``Newton,'' near\nthe south lunar pole, they attain a depth where the rays of the sun\nnever reach. Nothing more frightful than the spectacle which many of\nthese terrible chasms present can be pictured by the imagination. As\nthe lazy lunar day slowly advances, the sunshine, unmitigated by\nclouds or atmospheric veil of any kind, creeps across their rims and\nbegins to descend the opposite walls. Presently it strikes the ragged\ncrest of a ridge which had lain hidden in such darkness as we never\nknow on the earth, and runs along it like a line of kindling fire.\nRocky pinnacles and needles shoot up into the sunlight out of the\nblack depths. Down sinks the line of light, mile after mile, and\ncontinually new precipices and cliffs are brought into view, until at\nlast the vast floor is attained and begins to be illuminated. In the\nmeanwhile the sun's rays, darting across the gulf, have touched the\nsummits of the central peaks, twenty or thirty miles from the crater's\ninmost edge, and they immediately kindle and blaze like huge stars\namid the darkness. So profound are some of these awful craters that\ndays pass before the sun has risen high enough above them to chase the\nlast shadows from their depths.\n\nAlthough several long ranges of mountains resembling those of the\nearth exist on the moon, the great majority of its elevations assume\nthe crateriform aspect. Sometimes, instead of a crater, we find an\nimmense mountain ring whose form and aspect hardly suggest volcanic\naction. But everywhere the true craters are in evidence, even on the\nsea-beds, although they attain their greatest number and size on those\nparts of the moon -- covering sixty per cent of its visible surface --\nwhich are distinctly mountainous in character and which constitute its\nmost brilliant portions. Broadly speaking, the southwestern half of\nthe moon is the most mountainous and broken, and the northeastern half\nthe least so. Right down through the center, from pole to pole, runs a\nwonderful line of craters and crateriform valleys of a magnitude\nstupendous even for the moon. Another similar line follows the western\nedge. Three or four ``seas'' are thrust between these mountainous\nbelts. By the effects of ``libration'' parts of the opposite\nhemisphere of the moon which is turned away from the earth are from\ntime to time brought into view, and their aspect indicates that that\nhemisphere resembles in its surface features the one which faces the\nearth. There are many things about the craters which seem to give some\nwarrant for the hypothesis which has been particularly urged by Mr G.\nK. Gilbert, that they were formed by the impact of meteors; but there\nare also many things which militate against that idea, and, upon the\nwhole, the volcanic theory of their origin is to be preferred.\n\nThe enormous size of the lunar volcanoes is not so difficult to\naccount for when we remember how slight is the force of lunar gravity\nas compared with that of the earth. With equal size and density,\nbodies on the moon weigh only one-sixth as much as on the earth.\nImpelled by the same force, a projectile that would go ten miles on\nthe earth would go sixty miles on the moon. A lunar giant thirty-five\nfeet tall would weigh no more than an ordinary son of Adam weighs on\nhis greater planet. To shoot a body from the earth so that it would\nnot drop back again, we should have to start it with a velocity of\nseven miles per second; a mile and a half per second would serve on\nthe moon. It is by no means difficult to believe, then, that a lunar\nvolcano might form a crater ring eight or ten times broader than the\ngreatest to be found on the earth, especially when we reflect that in\naddition to the relatively slight force of gravity, the materials of\nthe lunar crust are probably lighter than those of our terrestrial\nrocks.\n\nFor similar reasons it seems not impossible that the theory mentioned\nin a former chapter -- that some of the meteorites that have fallen\nupon the earth originated from the lunar volcanoes -- is well founded.\nThis would apply especially to the stony meteorites, for it is hardly\nto be supposed that the moon, at least in its superficial parts,\ncontains much iron. It is surely a scene most strange that is thus\npresented to the mind's eye -- that little attendant of the earth's\n(the moon has only one-fiftieth of the volume, and only one-eightieth\nof the mass of the earth) firing great stones back at its parent\nplanet! And what can have been the cause of this furious outbreak of\nvolcanic forces on the moon? Evidently it was but a passing stage in\nits history; it had enjoyed more quiet times before. As it cooled down\nfrom the plastic state in which it parted from the earth, it became\nincrusted after the normal manner of a planet, and then oceans were\nformed, its atmosphere being sufficiently dense to prevent the water\nfrom evaporating and the would-be oceans from disappearing continually\nin mist. This, if any, must have been the period of life in the lunar\nworld. As we look upon the vestiges of that ancient world buried in\nthe wreck that now covers so much of its surface, it is difficult to\nrestrain the imagination from picturing the scenes which were once\npresented there; and, in such a case, should the imagination be\nfettered? We give it free rein in terrestrial life, and it rewards us\nwith some of our greatest intellectual pleasures. The wonderful\nlandscapes of the moon offer it an ideal field with just enough\nhalf-hidden suggestions of facts to stimulate its powers.\n\nThe great plains of the Mare Imbrium and the Mare Serenitatis (the\n``Sea of Showers'' and the ``Sea of Serenity''), bordered in part by\nlofty mountain ranges precisely like terrestrial mountains, scalloped\nalong their shores with beautiful bays curving back into the adjoining\nhighlands, and united by a great strait passing between the nearly\nabutting ends of the ``Lunar Apennines'' and the ``Lunar Caucasus,''\noffer the elements of a scene of world beauty such as it would be\ndifficult to match upon our planet. Look at the finely modulated\nbottom of the ancient sea in Mr Ritchey's exquisite photograph of the\nwestern part of the Mare Serenitatis, where one seems to see the play\nof the watery currents heaping the ocean sands in waving lines, making\nshallows, bars, and deeps for the mariner to avoid or seek, and\naffording a playground for the creatures of the main. What geologist\nwould not wish to try his hammer on those rocks with their stony pages\nof fossilized history? There is in us an instinct which forbids us to\nthink that there was never any life there. If we could visit the moon,\nthere is not among us a person so prosaic and unimaginative that he\nwould not, the very first thing, begin to search for traces of its\ninhabitants. We would look for them in the deposits on the sea\nbottoms; we would examine the shores wherever the configuration seemed\nfavorable for harbors and the sites of maritime cities -- forgetting\nthat it may be a little ridiculous to ascribe to the ancient lunarians\nthe same ideas that have governed the development of our race; we\nwould search through the valleys and along the seeming courses of\nvanished streams; we would explore the mountains, not the terrible\ncraters, but the pinnacled chains that recall our own Alps and\nRockies; seeking everywhere some vestige of the transforming presence\nof intelligent life. Perhaps we should find such traces, and perhaps,\nwith all our searching, we should find nothing to suggest that life\nhad ever existed amid that universal ruin.\n\nLook again at the border of the ``Sea of Serenity'' -- what a name for\nsuch a scene! -- and observe how it has been rent with almost\ninconceivable violence, the wall of the colossal crater Posidonius\ndropping vertically upon the ancient shore and obliterating it, while\nits giant neighbor, Le Monnier, opens a yawning mouth as if to swallow\nthe sea itself. A scene like this makes one question whether, after\nall, those may not be right who have imagined that the so-called sea\nbottoms are really vast plains of frozen lava which gushed up in\nfloods so extensive that even the mighty volcanoes were half drowned\nin the fiery sea. This suggestion becomes even stronger when we turn\nto another of the photographs of Mr Ritchey's wonderful series,\nshowing a part of the Mare Tranquilitatis (``Sea of Tranquility''!).\nNotice how near the center of the picture the outline of a huge ring\nwith radiating ridges shows through the sea bottom; a fossil volcano\nsubmerged in a petrified ocean! This is by no means the only instance\nin which a buried world shows itself under the great lunar plains.\nYet, as the newer craters in the sea itself prove, the volcanic\nactivity survived this other catastrophe, or broke out again\nsubsequently, bringing more ruin to pile upon ruin.\n\nYet notwithstanding the evidence which we have just been considering\nin support of the hypothesis that the ``seas'' are lava floods,\nMessrs. Loewy and Puiseux, the selenographers of the Paris\nObservatory, are convinced that these great plains bear characteristic\nmarks of the former presence of immense bodies of water. In that case\nwe should be forced to conclude that the later oceans of the moon lay\nupon vast sheets of solidified lava; and thus the catastrophe of the\nlunar world assumes a double aspect, the earliest oceans being\nswallowed up in molten floods issuing from the interior, while the\nlands were reduced to chaos by a universal eruption of tremendous\nvolcanoes; and then a period of comparative quiet followed, during\nwhich new seas were formed, and new life perhaps began to flourish in\nthe lunar world, only to end in another cataclysm, which finally put a\nterm to the existence of the moon as a life-supporting world.\n\nSuppose we examine two more of Mr Ritchey's illuminating photographs,\nand, first, the one showing the crater Theophilus and its\nsurroundings. We have spoken of Theophilus before, citing the facts\nthat it is sixty-four miles in diameter and eighteen thousand feet\ndeep. It will be noticed that it has two brother giants -- Cyrillus\nthe nearer, and Catharina the more distant; but Theophilus is plainly\nthe youngest of the trio. Centuries, and perhaps thousands of years,\nmust have elapsed between the periods of their upheaval, for the two\nolder craters are partly filled with d\u00e9bris, while it is manifest at a\nglance that when the south eastern wall of Theophilus was formed, it\nbroke away and destroyed a part of the more ancient ring of Cyrillus.\nThere is no more tremendous scene on the moon than this; viewed with a\npowerful telescope, it is absolutely appalling.\n\nThe next photograph shows, if possible, a still wilder region. It is\nthe part of the moon lying between Tycho and the south pole. Tycho is\nseen in the lower left-hand part of the picture. To the right, at the\nedge of the illuminated portion of the moon, are the crater-rings,\nLongomontanus and Wilhelm I, the former being the larger. Between them\nare to be seen the ruins of two or three more ancient craters which,\ntogether with portions of the walls of Wilhelm I and Longomontanus,\nhave been honeycombed with smaller craters. The vast crateriform\ndepression above the center of the picture is Clavius, an unrivaled\nwonder of lunar scenery, a hundred and forty-two miles in its greatest\nlength, while its whole immense floor has sunk two miles below the\ngeneral surface of the moon outside the ring. The monstrous\nshadow-filled cavity above Clavius toward the right is Blancanus,\nwhose aspect here gives a good idea of the appearance of these chasms\nwhen only their rims are in the sunlight. But observe the\nindescribable savagery of the entire scene. It looks as though the\nspirit of destruction had gone mad in this spot. The mighty craters\nhave broken forth one after another, each rending its predecessor; and\nwhen their work was finished, a minor but yet tremendous outbreak\noccurred, and the face of the moon was gored and punctured with\nthousands of smaller craters. These relatively small craters (small,\nhowever, only in a lunar sense, for many of them would appear gigantic\non the earth) recall once more the theory of meteoric impact. It does\nnot seem impossible that some of them may have been formed by such an\nagency.\n\nOne would not wish for our planet such a fate as that which has\novertaken the moon, but we cannot be absolutely sure that something of\nthe kind may not be in store for it. We really know nothing of the\nultimate causes of volcanic activity, and some have suggested that the\ninternal energies of the earth may be accumulating instead of dying\nout, and may never yet have exhibited their utmost destructive power.\nPerhaps the best assurance that we can find that the earth will escape\nthe catastrophe that has overtaken its satellite is to be found in the\nrelatively great force of its gravitation. The moon has been the\nvictim of its weakness; given equal forces, and the earth would be the\nbetter able to withstand them. It is significant, in connection with\nthese considerations, that the little planet Mercury, which seems also\nto have parted with its air and water, shows to the telescope some\nindications that it is pitted with craters resembling those that have\ntorn to pieces the face of the moon.\n\nUpon the whole, after studying the dreadful lunar landscapes, one\ncannot feel a very enthusiastic sympathy with those who are seeking\nindications of the continued existence of some kind of life on the\nmoon; such a world is better without inhabitants. It has met its fate;\nlet it go! Fortunately, it is not so near that it cannot hide its\nscars and appear beautiful -- except when curiosity impels us to look\nwith the penetrating eyes of the astronomer.\n\nThe Great Mars Problem\n\nLet any thoughtful person who is acquainted with the general facts of\nastronomy look up at the heavens some night when they appear in their\ngreatest splendor, and ask himself what is the strongest impression\nthat they make upon his mind. He may not find it easy to frame an\nanswer, but when he has succeeded it will probably be to the effect\nthat the stars give him an impression of the universality of\nintelligence; they make him feel, as the sun and the moon cannot do,\nthat his world is not alone; that all this was not made simply to form\na gorgeous canopy over the tents of men. If he is of a devout turn of\nmind, he thinks, as he gazes into those fathomless deeps and among\nthose bewildering hosts, of the infinite multitude of created beings\nthat the Almighty has taken under his care. The narrow ideas of the\nold geocentric theology, which made the earth God's especial\nfootstool, and man his only rational creature, fall away from him like\na veil that had obscured his vision; they are impossible in the\npresence of what he sees above. Thus the natural tendency, in the\nlight of modern progress, is to regard the universe as everywhere\nfilled with life.\n\nBut science, which is responsible for this broadening of men's\nthoughts concerning the universality of life, itself proceeds to set\nlimits. Of spiritual existences it pretends to know nothing, but as to\nphysical beings, it declares that it can only entertain the\nsupposition of their existence where it finds evidence of an\nenvironment suited to their needs, and such environment may not\neverywhere exist. Science, though repelled by the antiquated\ntheological conception of the supreme isolation of man among created\nbeings, regards with complacency the probability that there are\nregions in the universe where no organic life exists, stars which\nshine upon no inhabited worlds, and planets which nourish no animate\ncreatures. The astronomical view of the universe is that it consists\nof matter in every stage of evolution: some nebulous and chaotic; some\njust condensing into stars (suns) of every magnitude and order; some\nshaped into finished solar bodies surrounded by dependent planets;\nsome forming stars that perhaps have no planets, and will have none;\nsome constituting suns that are already aging, and will soon lose\ntheir radiant energy and disappear; and some aggregated into masses\nthat long ago became inert, cold, and rayless, and that can only be\nrevivified by means about which we can form conjectures, but of which\nwe actually know nothing.\n\nAs with the stars, so with the planets, which are the satellites of\nstars. All investigations unite to tell us that the planets are not\nall in the same state of development. As some are large and some\nsmall, so some are, in an evolutionary sense, young, and some old. As\nthey depend upon the suns around which they revolve for their light,\nheat, and other forms of radiant energy, so their condition varies\nwith their distance from those suns. Many may never arrive at a state\nsuitable for the maintenance of life upon their surfaces; some which\nare not at present in such a state may attain it later; and the forms\nof life themselves may vary with the peculiar environment that\ndifferent planets afford. Thus we see that we are not scientifically\njustified in affirming that life is ubiquitous, although we are thus\njustified in saying that it must be, in a general sense, universal. We\nmight liken the universe to a garden known to contain every variety of\nplant. If on entering it we see no flowers, we examine the species\nbefore us and find that they are not of those which bloom at this\nparticular season, or perhaps they are such as never bear flowers. Yet\nwe feel no doubt that we shall find flowers somewhere in the garden,\nbecause there are species which bloom at this season, and the garden\ncontains all varieties.\n\nWhile it is tacitly assumed that there are planets revolving around\nother stars than the sun, it would be impossible for us to see them\nwith any telescope yet invented, and no instrument now in the\npossession of astronomers could assure us of their existence; so the\nonly planetary system of which we have visual knowledge is our own.\nExcluding the asteroids, which could not from any point of view be\nconsidered as habitable, we have in the solar system eight planets of\nvarious sizes and situated at various distances from the sun. Of these\neight we know that one, the earth, is inhabited. The question, then,\narises: Are there any of the others which are inhabited or habitable?\nSince it is our intention to discuss the habitability of only one of\nthe seven to which the question applies, the rest may be dismissed in\na few words. The smallest of them, and the nearest to the sun, is\nMercury, which is regarded as uninhabitable because it has no\nperceptible supply of water and air, and because, owing to the\nextraordinary eccentricity of its orbit, it is subjected to excessive\nand very rapid alterations in the amount of solar heat and light\npoured upon its surface, such alterations being inconsistent with the\nsupposition that it can support living beings. Even its average\ntemperature is more than six and a half times that prevailing on the\nearth! Another circumstance which militates against its habitability\nis that, according to the results of the best telescopic studies, it\nalways keeps the same face toward the sun, so that one half of the\nplanet is perpetually exposed to the fierce solar rays, and the other\nhalf faces the unmitigated cold of open space. Venus, the next in\ndistance from the sun, is almost the exact twin of the earth in size,\nand many arguments may be urged in favor of its habitability, although\nit is suspected of possessing the same peculiarity as Mercury, in\nalways keeping the same side sunward. Unfortunately its atmosphere\nappears to be so dense that no permanent markings on its surface are\ncertainly visible, and the question of its actual condition must, for\nthe present, be left in abeyance. Mars, the first planet more distant\nfrom the sun than the earth, is the special subject of this chapter,\nand will be described and discussed a few lines further on. Jupiter,\nSaturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the four giant planets, all more distant\nthan Mars, and each more distant than the other in the order named,\nare all regarded as uninhabitable because none of them appears to\npossess any degree of solidity. They may have solid or liquid nuclei,\nbut exteriorly they seem to be mere balls of cloud. Of course, one can\nimagine what he pleases about the existence of creatures suited to the\nphysical constitution of such planets as these, but they must be\nexcluded from the category of habitable worlds in the ordinary sense\nof the term. We go back, then, to Mars.\n\nIt will be best to begin with a description of the planet. Mars is\n4230 miles in diameter; its surface is not much more than one-quarter\nas extensive as that of the earth (.285). Its mean distance from the\nsun is 141,500,000 miles, 48,500,000 miles greater than that of the\nearth. Since radiant energy varies inversely as the square of\ndistance, Mars receives less than half as much solar light and heat as\nthe earth gets. Mars' year (period of revolution round the sun) is 687\ndays. Its mean density is 71 per cent of the earth's, and the force of\ngravity on its surface is 38 per cent of that on the surface of the\nearth; i.e., a body weighing one hundred pounds on the earth would, if\ntransported to Mars, weigh but thirty-eight pounds. The inclination of\nits equator to the plane of its orbit differs very little from that of\nthe earth's equator, and its axial rotation occupies 24 hours 37\nminutes. so that the length of day and night, and the extent of the\nseasonal changes on Mars, are almost precisely the same as on the\nearth. But owing to the greater length of its year, the seasons of\nMars, while occurring in the same order, are almost twice as long as\nours. The surface of the planet is manifestly solid, like that of our\nglobe, and the telescope reveals many permanent markings on it,\nrecalling the appearance of a globe on which geographical features\nhave been represented in reddish and dusky tints. Around the poles are\nplainly to be seen rounded white areas, which vary in extent with the\nMartian seasons, nearly vanishing in summer and extending widely in\nwinter. The most recent spectroscopic determinations indicate that\nMars has an atmosphere perhaps as dense as that to be found on our\nloftiest mountain peaks, and there is a perceptible amount of watery\nvapor in this atmosphere. The surface of the planet appears to be\nremarkably level, and it has no mountain ranges. No evidences of\nvolcanic action have been discovered on Mars. The dusky and reddish\nareas were regarded by the early observers as respectively seas and\nlands, but at present it is not believed that there are any bodies of\nwater on the planet. There has never been much doubt expressed that\nthe white areas about the poles represent snow.\n\nIt will be seen from this brief description that many remarkable\nresemblances exist between Mars and the earth, and there is nothing\nwonderful in the fact that the question of the habitability of the\nformer has become one of extreme and wide-spread interest, giving rise\nto the most diverse views, to many extraordinary speculations, and\nsometimes to regrettably heated controversy. The first champion of the\nhabitability of Mars was Sir William Herschel, although even before\nhis time the idea had been suggested. He was convinced by the\nrevelations of his telescopes, continually increasing in power, that\nMars was more like the earth than any other planet. He could not\nresist the testimony of the polar snows, whose suggestive conduct was\nin such striking accord with what occurs upon the earth. Gradually, as\ntelescopes improved and observers increased in number, the principal\nfeatures of the planet were disclosed and charted, and ``areography,''\nas the geography of Mars was called, took its place among the\nrecognized branches of astronomical study. But it was not before 1877\nthat a fundamentally new discovery in areography gave a truly\nsensational turn to speculation about life on ``the red planet.'' In\nthat year Mars made one of its nearest approaches to the earth, and\nwas so situated in its orbit that it could be observed to great\nadvantage from the northern hemisphere of the earth. The celebrated\nItalian astronomer, Schiaparelli, took advantage of this opportunity\nto make a trigonometrical survey of the surface of Mars -- as coolly\nand confidently as if he were not taking his sights across a\nthirty-five-million-mile gulf of empty space -- and in the course of\nthis survey he was astonished to perceive that the reddish areas, then\ncalled continents, were crossed in many directions by narrow, dusky\nlines, to which he gave the suggestive name of ``canals.'' Thus a kind\nof firebrand was cast into the field of astronomical speculation,\nwhich has ever since produced disputes that have sometimes approached\nthe violence of political faction. At first the accuracy of\nSchiaparelli's observations was contested; it required a powerful\ntelescope, and the most excellent ``seeing,'' to render the\nenigmatical lines visible at all, and many searchers were unable to\ndetect them. But Schiaparelli continued his studies in the serene sky\nof Italy, and produced charts of the gridironed face of Mars\ncontaining so much astonishing detail that one had either to reject\nthem in toto or to confess that Schiaparelli was right. As subsequent\nfavorable oppositions of Mars occurred, other observers began to see\nthe ``canals'' and to confirm the substantial accuracy of the Italian\nastronomer's work, and finally few were found who would venture to\naffirm that the ``canals'' did not exist, whatever their meaning might\nbe.\n\nWhen Schiaparelli began his observations it was generally believed, as\nwe have said, that the dusky areas on Mars were seas, and since\nSchiaparelli thought that the ``canals'' invariably began and ended at\nthe shores of the ``seas,'' the appropriateness of the title given to\nthe lines seemed apparent. Their artificial character was immediately\nassumed by many, because they were too straight and too suggestively\ngeometrical in their arrangement to permit the conclusion that they\nwere natural watercourses. A most surprising circumstance noted by\nSchiaparelli was that the ``canals'' made their appearance after the\nmelting of the polar snow in the corresponding hemisphere had begun,\nand that they grew darker, longer, and more numerous in proportion as\nthe polar liquidation proceeded; another very puzzling observation was\nthat many of them became double as the season advanced; close beside\nan already existing ``canal,'' and in perfect parallelism with it,\nanother would gradually make its appearance. That these phenomena\nactually existed and were not illusions was proved by later\nobservations, and today they are seen whenever Mars is favorably\nsituated for observation.\n\nIn the closing decade of the nineteenth century, Mr Percival Lowell\ntook up the work where Schiaparelli had virtually dropped it, and soon\nadded a great number of ``canals'' to those previously known, so that\nin his charts the surface of the wonderful little planet appears\ncovered as with a spider's web, the dusky lines criss-crossing in\nevery direction, with conspicuous knots wherever a number of them come\ntogether. Mr Lowell has demonstrated that the areas originally called\nseas, and thus named on the earlier charts, are not bodies of water,\nwhatever else they may be. He has also found that the mysterious lines\ndo not, as Schiaparelli supposed, begin and end at the edges of the\ndusky regions, but often continue on across them, reaching in some\ncases far up into the polar regions. But Schiaparelli was right in his\nobservation that the appearance of the ``canals'' is synchronous with\nthe gradual disappearance of the polar snows, and this fact has become\nthe basis of the most extraordinary theory that the subject of life in\nother worlds has ever given birth to.\n\nNow, the effect of such discoveries, as we have related, depends upon\nthe type of mind to whose attention they are called. Many are content\nto accept them as strange and inexplicable at present, and to wait for\nfurther light upon them; others insist upon an immediate inquiry\nconcerning their probable nature and meaning. Such an inquiry can only\nbe based upon inference proceeding from analogy. Mars, say Mr Lowell\nand those who are of his opinion, is manifestly a solidly incrusted\nplanet like the earth; it has an atmosphere, though one of great\nrarity; it has water vapor, as the snows in themselves prove; it has\nthe alternation of day and night, and a succession of seasons closely\nresembling those of the earth; its surface is suggestively divided\ninto regions of contrasting colors and appearance, and upon that\nsurface we see an immense number of lines geometrically arranged, with\na system of symmetrical intersections where the lines expand into\ncircular and oval areas -- and all connected with the annual melting\nof the polar snows in a way which irresistibly suggests the\ninterference of intelligence directed to a definite end. Why, with so\nmany concurrent circumstances to support the hypothesis, should we not\nregard Mars as an inhabited globe?\n\nBut the differences between Mars and the earth are in many ways as\nstriking as their resemblances. Mars is relatively small; it gets less\nthan half as much light and heat as we receive; its atmosphere is so\nrare that it would be distressing to us, even if we could survive in\nit at all; it has no lakes, rivers, or seas; its surface is an endless\nprairie. and its ``canals'' are phenomena utterly unlike anything on\nthe earth. Yet it is precisely upon these divergences between the\nearth and Mars, this repudiation of terrestrial standards, that the\ntheory of ``life on Mars,'' for which Mr Lowell is mainly responsible,\nis based. Because Mars is smaller than the earth, we are told it must\nnecessarily be more advanced in planetary evolution, the underlying\ncause of which is the gradual cooling and contraction of the planet's\nmass. Mars has parted with its internal heat more rapidly than the\nearth; consequently its waters and its atmosphere have been mostly\nwithdrawn by chemical combinations, but enough of both yet remain to\nrender life still possible on its surface. As the globe of Mars is\nevolutionally older than that of the earth, so its forms of organic\nlife may be proportionally further advanced, and its inhabitants may\nhave attained a degree of cultivated intelligence much superior to\nwhat at present exists upon the earth. Understanding the nature and\nthe causes of the desiccation of their planet, and possessing\nengineering science and capabilities far in advance of ours, they may\nbe conceived to have grappled with the stupendous problem of keeping\ntheir world in a habitable condition as long as possible. Supposing\nthem to have become accustomed to live in their rarefied atmosphere (a\nthing not inconceivable, since men can live for a time at least in air\nhardly less rare), the most pressing problem for them is that of a\nwater-supply, without which plant life cannot exist, while animal life\nin turn depends for its existence upon vegetation. The only direction\nin which they can seek water is that of the polar regions, where it is\nalternately condensed into snow and released in the liquid form by the\neffect of the seasonal changes. It is, then, to the annual melting of\nthe polar snow-fields that the Martian engineers are supposed to have\nrecourse in supplying the needs of their planet, and thus providing\nthe means of prolonging their own existence. It is imagined that they\nhave for this purpose constructed a stupendous system of irrigation\nextending over the temperate and equatorial regions of the planet. The\n``canals'' represent the lines of irrigation, but the narrow streaks\nthat we see are not the canals themselves, but the irrigated bands\ncovered by them. Their dark hue, and their gradual appearance after\nthe polar melting has begun, are due to the growth of vegetation\nstimulated by the water. The rounded areas visible where several\n``canals'' meet and cross are called by Mr Lowell ``oases.'' These are\nsupposed to be the principal centers of population and industry. It\nmust be confessed that some of them, with their complicated systems of\nradiating lines, appear to answer very well to such a theory. No\nattempt to explain them by analogy with natural phenomena on the earth\nhas proved successful.\n\nBut a great difficulty yet remains: How to explain the seemingly\nmiraculous powers of the supposed engineers? Here recourse is had once\nmore to the relative smallness of the planet. We have remarked that\nthe force of gravity on Mars is only thirty-eight per cent of that on\nthe earth. A steam-shovel driven by a certain horse-power would be\nnearly three times as effective there as here. A man of our stature on\nMars would find his effective strength increased in the same\nproportion. But just because of the slight force of gravity there, a\nMartian might attain to the traditional stature of Goliath without\nfinding his own weight an encumbrance to his activity, while at the\nsame time his huge muscles would come into unimpeded play, enabling\nhim single-handed to perform labors that would be impossible to a\nwhole gang of terrestrial workmen. The effective powers of huge\nmachines would be increased in the same way; and to all this must be\nadded the fact that the mean density of the materials of which Mars is\ncomposed is much less than that of the constituents of the earth.\nCombining all these considerations, it becomes much less difficult to\nconceive that public works might be successfully undertaken on Mars\nwhich would be hopelessly beyond the limits of human accomplishment.\n\nCertain other difficulties have also to be met; as, for instance, the\nrelative coldness of the climate of Mars. At its distance it gets\nconsiderably less than half as much light and heat as we receive. In\naddition to this, the rarity of its atmosphere would naturally be\nexpected to decrease the effective temperature at the planet's\nsurface, since an atmosphere acts somewhat like the glass cover of a\nhot-house in retaining the solar heat which has penetrated it. It has\nbeen calculated that, unless there are mitigating circumstances of\nwhich we know nothing, the average temperature at the surface of Mars\nmust be far below the freezing-point of water. To this it is replied\nthat the possible mitigating circumstances spoken of evidently exist\nin fact, because we can see that the watery vapor condenses into snow\naround the poles in winter, but melts again when summer comes. The\nmitigating agent may be supposed to exist in the atmosphere where the\npresence of certain gases would completely alter the temperature\ngradients.\n\nIt might also be objected that it is inconceivable that the Martian\nengineers, however great may be their physical powers, and however\ngigantic the mechanical energies under their control, could force\nwater in large quantities from the poles to the equator. This is an\nachievement that measures up to the cosmical standard. It is admitted\nby the champions of the theory that the difficulty is a formidable\none; but they call attention to the singular fact that on Mars there\ncan be found no chains of mountains, and it is even doubtful if ranges\nof hills exist there. The entire surface of the planet appears to be\nalmost ``as smooth as a billiard ball,'' and even the broad regions\nwhich were once supposed to be seas apparently lie at practically the\nsame level as the other parts, since the ``canals'' in many cases run\nuninterruptedly across them. Lowell's idea is that these sombre areas\nmay be expanses of vegetation covering ground of a more or less marshy\ncharacter, for while the largest of them appear to be permanent, there\nare some which vary coincidently with the variations of the canals.\n\nAs to the kind of machinery employed to force the water from the\npoles, it has been conjectured that it may have taken the form of a\ngigantic system of pumps and conduits; and since the Martians are\nassumed to be so far in advance of us in their mastery of scientific\nprinciples, the hypothesis will at least not be harmed by supposing\nthat they have learned to harness forces of nature whose very\nexistence in a manageable form is yet unrecognized on the earth. If we\nwish to let the imagination loose, we may conjecture that they have\nconquered the secret of those intra-atomic forces whose resistless\nenergy is beginning to become evident to us, but the possibility of\nwhose utilization remains a dream, the fulfillment of which nobody\ndares to predict.\n\nSuch, in very brief form, is the celebrated theory of Mars as an\ninhabited world. It certainly captivates the imagination, and if we\nbelieve it to represent the facts, we cannot but watch with the\ndeepest sympathy this gallant struggle of an intellectual race to\npreserve its planet from the effects of advancing age and death. We\nmay, indeed, wonder whether our own humanity, confronted by such a\ncalamity, could be counted on to meet the emergency with equal\nstoutness of heart and inexhaustibleness of resource. Up to the\npresent time we certainly have shown no capacity to confront Nature\ntoe to toe, and to seize her by the shoulders and turn her round when\nshe refuses to go our way. If we could get into wireless telephonic\ncommunication with the Martians we might learn from their own lips the\nsecret of their more than ``Roman recovery.''\n\nThe Riddle of the Asteroids\n\nBetween the orbits of Mars and Jupiter revolves the most remarkable\nsystem of little bodies with which we are acquainted -- the Asteroids,\nor Minor Planets. Some six hundred are now known, and they may\nactually number thousands. They form virtually a ring about the sun.\nThe most striking general fact about them is that they occupy the\nplace in the sky which should be occupied, according to Bode's Law, by\na single large planet. This fact, as we shall see, has led to the\ninvention of one of the most extraordinary theories in astronomy --\nviz., that of the explosion of a world!\n\nBode's Law, so-called, is only an empiric formula, but until the\ndiscovery of Neptune it accorded so well with the distances of the\nplanets that astronomers were disposed to look upon it as really\nrepresenting some underlying principle of planetary distribution. They\nwere puzzled by the absence of a planet in the space between Mars and\nJupiter, where the ``law'' demanded that there should be one, and an\nassociation of astronomers was formed to search for it. There was a\ndecided sensation when, in 1801, Piazzi, of Palermo, announced that he\nhad found a little planet which apparently occupied the place in the\nsystem which belonged to the missing body. He named it Ceres, and it\nwas the first of the Asteroids. The next year Olbers, of Bremen, while\nlooking for Ceres with his telescope, stumbled upon another small\nplanet which he named Pallas. Immediately he was inspired with the\nidea that these two planets were fragments of a larger one which had\nformerly occupied the vacant place in the planetary ranks, and he\npredicted that others would be found by searching in the neighborhood\nof the intersection of the orbits of the two already discovered. This\nbold prediction was brilliantly fulfilled by the finding of two more\n-- Juno in 1804, and Vesta in 1807. Olbers would seem to have been led\nto the invention of his hypothesis of a planetary explosion by the\nfaith which astronomers at that time had in Bode's Law. They appear to\nhave thought that several planets revolving in the gap where the\n``law'' called for but one could only be accounted for upon the theory\nthat the original one had been broken up to form the several.\nGravitation demanded that the remnants of a planet blown to pieces, no\nmatter how their orbits might otherwise differ, should all return at\nstated periods to the point where the explosion had occurred; hence\nOlbers' prediction that any asteroids that might subsequently be\ndiscovered would be found to have a common point of orbital\nintersection. And curiously enough all of the first asteroids found\npractically answered to this requirement. Olbers' theory seemed to be\nestablished.\n\nAfter the first four, no more asteroids were found until 1845, when\none was discovered; then, in 1847, three more were added to the list;\nand after that searchers began to pick them up with such rapidity that\nby the close of the century hundreds were known, and it had become\nalmost impossible to keep track of them. The first four are by far the\nlargest members of the group, but their actual sizes remained unknown\nuntil less than twenty years ago. It was long supposed that Vesta was\nthe largest, because it shines more brightly than any of the others;\nbut finally, in 1895, Barnard, with the Lick telescope, definitely\nmeasured their diameters, and proved to everybody's surprise that\nCeres is really the chief, and Vesta only the third in rank. His\nmeasures are as follows: Ceres, 477 miles; Pallas, 304 miles; Vesta,\n239 miles; and Juno, 120 miles. They differ greatly in the reflective\npower of their surfaces, a fact of much significance in connection\nwith the question of their origin. Vesta is, surface for surface,\nrather more than three times as brilliant as Ceres, whence the\noriginal mistake about its magnitude.\n\nNowadays new asteroids are found frequently by photography, but\nphysically they are most insignificant bodies, their average diameter\nprobably not exceeding twenty miles, and some are believed not to\nexceed ten. On a planet only ten miles in diameter, assuming the same\nmean density as the earth's, which is undoubtedly too much, the force\nof gravity would be so slight that an average man would not weigh more\nthan three ounces, and could jump off into space whenever he liked.\n\nAlthough the asteroids all revolve around the sun in the same\ndirection as that pursued by the major planets, their orbits are\ninclined at a great variety of angles to the general plane of the\nplanetary system, and some of them are very eccentric -- almost as\nmuch so as the orbits of many of the periodic comets. It has even been\nconjectured that the two tiny moons of Mars and the four smaller\nsatellites of Jupiter may be asteroids gone astray and captured by\nthose planets. Two of the asteroids are exceedingly remarkable for the\nshapes and positions of their orbits; these are Eros, discovered in\n1898, and T. G., 1906, found eight years later. The latter has a mean\ndistance from the sun slightly greater than that of Jupiter, while the\nmean distance of Eros is less than that of Mars. The orbit of Eros is\nso eccentric that at times it approaches within 15,000,000 miles of\nthe earth, nearer than any other regular member of the solar system\nexcept the moon, thus affording an unrivaled means of measuring the\nsolar parallax. But for our present purpose the chief interest of Eros\nlies in its extraordinary changes of light.\n\nThese changes, although irregular, have been observed and photographed\nmany times, and there seems to be no doubt of their reality. Their\nsignificance consists in their possible connection with the form of\nthe little planet, whose diameter is generally estimated at not more\nthan twenty miles. Von Oppolzer found, in 1901, that Eros lost\nthree-fourths of its brilliancy once in every two hours and\nthirty-eight minutes. Other observers have found slightly different\nperiods of variability, but none as long as three hours. The most\ninteresting interpretation that has been offered of this phenomenon is\nthat it is due to a great irregularity of figure, recalling at once\nOlbers' hypothesis. According to some, Eros may be double, the two\nbodies composing it revolving around each other at very close\nquarters; but a more striking, and it may be said probable, suggestion\nis that Eros has a form not unlike that of a dumb-bell, or hour-glass,\nturning rapidly end over end so that the area of illuminated surface\npresented to our eyes continually changes, reaching at certain times a\nminimum when the amount of light that it reflects toward the earth is\nreduced to a quarter of its maximum value. Various other bizarre\nshapes have been ascribed to Eros, such, for instance, as that of a\nflat stone revolving about one of its longer axes, so that sometimes\nwe see its face and sometimes its edge.\n\nAll of these explanations proceed upon the assumption that Eros cannot\nhave a simple globular figure like that of a typical planet, a figure\nwhich is prescribed by the law of gravitation, but that its shape is\nwhat may be called accidental; in a word, it is a fragment, for it\nseems impossible to believe that a body formed in interplanetary\nspace, either through nebular condensation or through the aggregation\nof particles drawn together by their mutual attractions, should not be\npractically spherical in shape. Nor is Eros the only asteroid that\ngives evidence by variations of brilliancy that there is something\nabnormal in its constitution; several others present the same\nphenomenon in varying degrees. Even Vesta was regarded by Olbers as\nsufficiently variable in its light to warrant the conclusion that it\nwas an angular mass instead of a globe. Some of the smaller ones show\nvery notable variations, and all in short periods, of three or four\nhours, suggesting that in turning about one of their axes they present\na surface of variable extent toward the sun and the earth.\n\nThe theory which some have preferred -- that the variability of light\nis due to the differences of reflective power on different parts of\nthe surface -- would, if accepted, be hardly less suggestive of the\norigin of these little bodies by the breaking up of a larger one,\nbecause the most natural explanation of such differences would seem to\nbe that they arose from variations in the roughness or smoothness of\nthe reflecting surface, which would be characteristic of fragmentary\nbodies. In the case of a large planet alternating expanses of land and\nwater, or of vegetation and desert, would produce a notable variation\nin the amount of reflection, but on bodies of the size of the\nasteroids neither water nor vegetation could exist, and an atmosphere\nwould be equally impossible.\n\nOne of the strongest objections to Olbers' hypothesis is that only a\nfew of the first asteroids discovered travel in orbits which\nmeasurably satisfy the requirement that they should all intersect at\nthe point where the explosion occurred. To this it was at first\nreplied that the perturbations of the asteroidal orbits, by the\nattractions of the major planets, would soon displace them in such a\nmanner that they would cease to intersect. One of the first\ninvestigations undertaken by the late Prof. Simon Newcomb was directed\nto the solution of this question, and he arrived at the conclusion\nthat the planetary perturbations could not explain the actual\nsituation of the asteroidal orbits. But afterward it was pointed out\nthat the difficulty could be avoided by supposing that not one but a\nseries of explosions had produced the asteroids as they now are. After\nthe primary disruption the fragments themselves, according to this\nsuggestion, may have exploded, and then the resulting orbits would be\nas ``tangled'' as the heart could wish. This has so far rehabilitated\nthe explosion theory that it has never been entirely abandoned, and\nthe evidence which we have just cited of the probably abnormal shapes\nof Eros and other asteroids has lately given it renewed life. It is a\nsubject that needs a thorough rediscussion.\n\nWe must not fail to mention, however, that there is a rival hypothesis\nwhich commends itself to many astronomers -- viz., that the asteroids\nwere formed out of a relatively scant ring of matter, situated between\nMars and Jupiter and resembling in composition the immensely more\nmassive rings from which, according to Laplace's hypothesis, the\nplanets were born. It is held by the supporters of this theory that\nthe attraction of the giant Jupiter was sufficient to prevent the\nsmall, nebulous ring that gave birth to the asteroids from condensing\nlike the others into a single planet.\n\nBut if we accept the explosion theory, with its corollary that minor\nexplosions followed the principal one, we have still an unanswered\nquestion before us: What caused the explosions? The idea of a world\nblowing up is too Titanic to be shocking; it rather amuses the\nimagination than seriously impresses it; in a word, it seems\nessentially chimerical. We can by no appeal to experience form a\nmental picture of such an occurrence. Even the moon did not blow up\nwhen it was wrecked by volcanoes. The explosive nebul\u00e6 and new stars\nare far away in space, and suggest no connection with such a\ncatastrophe as the bursting of a planet into hundreds of pieces. We\ncannot conceive of a great globe thousands of miles in diameter\nresembling a pellet of gunpowder only awaiting the touch of a match to\ncause its sudden disruption. Somehow the thought of human agency\nobtrudes itself in connection with the word ``explosion,'' and we\nsmile at the idea that giant powder or nitro-glycerine could blow up a\nplanet. Yet it would only need enough of them to do it.\n\nAfter all, we may deceive ourselves in thinking, as we are apt to do,\nthat explosive energies lock themselves up only in small masses of\nmatter. There are many causes producing explosions in nature, every\nvolcanic eruption manifests the activity of some of them. Think of the\ngiant power of confined steam; if enough steam could be suddenly\ngenerated in the center of the earth by a downpour of all the waters\nof the oceans, what might not the consequences be for our globe? In a\nsmaller globe, and it has never been estimated that the original\nasteroid was even as large as the moon, such a catastrophe would,\nperhaps, be more easily conceivable; but since we are compelled in\nthis case to assume that there was a series of successive explosions,\nsteam would hardly answer the purpose; it would be more reasonable to\nsuppose that the cause of the explosion was some kind of chemical\nreaction, or something affecting the atoms composing the exploding\nbody. Here Dr Gustav Le Bon comes to our aid with a most startling\nsuggestion, based on his theory of the dissipation of intra-atomic\nenergy. It will be best to quote him at some length from his book on\nThe Evolution of Forces.\n\n``It does not seem at first sight,'' says Doctor Le Bon,\n\n  very comprehensible that worlds which appear more and more stable\n  as they cool could become so unstable as to afterward dissociate\n  entirely. To explain this phenomenon, we will inquire whether\n  astronomical observations do not allow us to witness this\n  dissociation.\n\n  We know that the stability of a body in motion, such as a top or a\n  bicycle, ceases to be possible when its velocity of rotation\n  descends below a certain limit. Once this limit is reached it loses\n  its stability and falls to the ground. Prof. J. J. Thomson even\n  interprets radio-activity in this manner, and points out that when\n  the speed of the elements composing the atoms descends below a\n  certain limit they become unstable and tend to lose their\n  equilibria. There would result from this a commencement of\n  dissociation, with diminution of their potential energy and a\n  corresponding increase of their kinetic energy sufficient to launch\n  into space the products of intra-atomic disintegration.\n\n  It must not be forgotten that the atom being an enormous reservoir\n  of energy is by this very fact comparable with explosive bodies.\n  These last remain inert so long as their internal equilibria are\n  undisturbed. So soon as some cause or other modifies these, they\n  explode and smash everything around them after being themselves\n  broken to pieces.\n\n  Atoms, therefore, which grow old in consequence of the diminution\n  of a part of their intra-atomic energy gradually lose their\n  stability. A moment, then, arrives when this stability is so weak\n  that the matter disappears by a sort of explosion more or less\n  rapid. The bodies of the radium group offer an image of this\n  phenomenon -- a rather faint image, however, because the atoms of\n  this body have only reached a period of instability when the\n  dissociation is rather slow. It probably precedes another and more\n  rapid period of dissociation capable of producing their final\n  explosion. Bodies such as radium, thorium, etc., represent, no\n  doubt, a state of old age at which all bodies must some day arrive,\n  and which they already begin to manifest in our universe, since all\n  matter is slightly radio-active. It would suffice for the\n  dissociation to be fairly general and fairly rapid for an explosion\n  to occur in a world where it was manifested.\n\n  These theoretical considerations find a solid support in the sudden\n  appearances and disappearances of stars. The explosions of a world\n  which produce them reveal to us, perhaps, how the universes perish\n  when they become old.\n\n  As astronomical observations show the relative frequency of these\n  rapid destructions, we may ask ourselves whether the end of a\n  universe by a sudden explosion after a long period of old age does\n  not represent its most general ending.\n\nHere, perhaps, it will be well to stop, since, entrancing as the\nsubject may be, we know very little about it, and Doctor Le Bon's\ntheory affords a limitless field for the reader's imagination.\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\nA printed version of this book is available from Sattre Press\n(http://csky.sattre-press.com).

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
