Accordingly,\nthe symbol # was chosen, primarily because it appears on every\ntypewriter.\n\nUp to the present time, the use of the symbol # to indicate directed\nmental communication has been restricted to technical papers, term\ntheses, and scholarly treatises by professors, scholars, and students of\ntelepathy.\n\nHere, for the first time in any popular work, the symbol # is used to\nsignify that the passage between the marks was mental communication.\n\nSteve Cornell, _M. Ing._\n\n\n\n\nSTALEMATE\n\n\nMacklin said, \"Please put that weapon down, Mr. Cornell. Let's not add\nattempted murder to your other crimes.\"\n\n\"Don't force me to it, then,\" I told him.\n\nBut I knew I couldn't do it. I hated them all. I wanted the whole\nHighways in Hiding rolled up like an old discarded carpet, with every\nMekstrom on Earth rolled up in it. But I couldn't pull the trigger. The\nsurvivors would have enough savvy to clean up the mess before our bodies\ngot cold, and the Highways crowd would be doing business at the same old\nstand. Without, I might add, the minor nuisance that people call Steve\nCornell.\n\nWhat I really wanted was to find Catherine.\n\nAnd then it came to me that what I really wanted second of all was to\npossess a body of Mekstrom Flesh, to be a physical superman....\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nI came up out of the blackness just enough to know that I was no longer\npinned down by a couple of tons of wrecked automobile. I floated on soft\nsheets with only a light blanket over me.\n\nI hurt all over like a hundred and sixty pounds of boil. My right arm\nwas numb and my left thigh was aching. Breathing felt like being stabbed\nwith rapiers and the skin of my face felt stretched tight. There was a\nbandage over my eyes and the place was as quiet as the grave. But I knew\nthat I was not in any grave because my nose was working just barely well\nenough to register the unmistakable pungent odor that only goes with\nhospitals.\n\nI tried my sense of perception, but like any delicate and critical\nsense, perception was one of the first to go. I could not dig out beyond\na few inches. I could sense the bed and the white sheets and that was\nall.\n\nSome brave soul had hauled me out of that crack-up before the fuel tank\nwent up in the fire. I hope that whoever he was, he'd had enough sense\nto haul Catherine out of the mess first. The thought of living without\nCatherine was too dark to bear, and so I just let the blackness close\ndown over me again because it cut out all pain, both physical and\nmental.\n\nThe next time I awoke there was light and a pleasant male voice saying,\n\"Steve Cornell. Steve, can you hear me?\"\n\nI tried to answer but no sound came out. Not even a hoarse croak.\n\nThe voice went on, \"Don't try to talk, Steve. Just think it.\"\n\n#Catherine?# I thought sharply, because most medicos are telepath, not\nperceptive.\n\n\"Catherine is all right,\" he replied.\n\n#Can I see her?#\n\n\"Lord no!\" he said quickly. \"You'd scare her half to death the way you\nlook right now.\"\n\n#How bad off am I?#\n\n\"You're a mess, Steve. Broken ribs, compound fracture of the left tibia,\nbroken humerus. Scars, mars, abrasions, some flashburn and post-accident\nshock. And if you're interested, not a trace of Mekstrom's Disease.\"\n\n#Mekstrom's Disease--?# was my thought of horror.\n\n\"Forget it, Steve. I always check for it because it's been my specialty.\nDon't worry.\"\n\n#Okay. So how long have I been here?#\n\n\"Eight days.\"\n\n#Eight days? Couldn't you do the usual job?#\n\n\"You were pretty badly ground up, Steve. That's what took the time. Now,\nsuppose you tell me what happened?\"\n\n#Catherine and I were eloping. Just like most other couples do since\nRhine Institute made it difficult to find personal privacy. Then we\ncracked up.#\n\n\"What did it?\" asked the doctor. \"Perceptives like you usually sense\ndanger before you can see it.\"\n\n#Catherine called my attention to a peculiar road sign, and I sent my\nperception back to take another dig. We hit the fallen limb of a tree\nand went over and over. You know the rest.#\n\n\"Bad,\" said the doctor. \"But what kind of a sign would call your\ninterest so deep that you didn't at least see the limb, even if you were\nperceiving the sign?\"\n\n#Peculiar sign,# I thought. Ornamental wrought iron gizmo with curlicues\nand a little decorative circle that sort of looks like the Boy Scout\ntenderfoot badge suspended on three spokes. One of the spokes were\nbroken away; I got involved because I was trying to guess whether it had\nbeen shot away by some vandal who missed the central design.\nThen--blooie!#\n\n\"It's really too bad, Steve. But you'll be all right in a while.\"\n\n#Thanks, doctor. Doctor? Doctor--?#\n\n\"Sorry, Steve. I forget that everybody is not telepath like I am. I'm\nJames Thorndyke.\"\n\nMuch later I began to wake up again, and with better clarity of mind, I\nfound that I could extend my esper as far as the wall and through the\ndoor by a few inches. It was strictly hospital all right; sere white and\nstainless steel as far as my esper could reach.\n\nIn my room was a nurse, rustling in starched white. I tried to speak,\ncroaked once, and then paused to form my voice.\n\n\"Can--I see--How is--? Where is?\" I stopped again, because the nurse was\nprobably as esper as I was and required a full sentence to get the\nthought behind it. Only a telepath like the doctor could have followed\nmy jumbled ideas. But the nurse was good. She tried:\n\n\"Mr. Cornell? You're awake!\"\n\n\"Look--nurse--\"\n\n\"Take it easy. I'm Miss Farrow. I'll get the doctor.\"\n\n\"No--wait. I've been here eight days--?\"\n\n\"But you were badly hurt, you know.\"\n\n\"But the doctor. He said that she was here, too.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it, Mr. Cornell.\"\n\n\"But he said that she was not badly hurt.\"\n\n\"She wasn't.\"\n\n\"Then why was--is--she here so long?\"\n\nMiss Farrow laughed cheerfully. \"Your Christine is in fine shape. She is\nstill here because she wouldn't leave until you were well out of danger.\nNow stop fretting. You'll see her soon enough.\"\n\nHer laugh was light but strained. It sounded off-key because it was as\noff-key as a ten-yard-strip of baldfaced perjury. She left in a hurry\nand I was able to esper as far as outside the door, where she leaned\nback against the wood and began to cry. She was hating herself because\nshe had blown her lines and she knew that I knew it.\n\nAnd Catherine had never been in this hospital, because if she had been\nbrought in with me, the nurse would have known the right name.\n\nNot that it mattered to me now, but Miss Farrow was no esper or she'd\nhave dug my belongings and found Catherine's name on the license. Miss\nFarrow was a telepath; I'd not called my girl by name, only by an\naffectionate mental image.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nI was fighting my body upright when Doctor Thorndyke came running.\n\"Easy, Steve,\" he said with a quiet gesture. He pushed me gently back\ndown in the bed with hands that were as soft as a mother's, but as firm\nas the kind that tie bow knots in half-inch bars. \"Easy,\" he repeated\nsoothingly.\n\n\"Catherine?\" I croaked pleadingly.\n\nThorndyke fingered the call button in some code or other before he\nanswered me. \"Steve,\" he said honestly, \"you can't be kept in ignorance\nforever. We hoped it would be a little longer, when you were stronger--\"\n\n\"Stop beating around!\" I yelled. At least it felt like I was yelling,\nbut maybe it was only my mind welling.\n\n\"Easy, Steve. You've had a rough time. Shock--\" The door opened and a\nnurse came in with a hypo all loaded, its needle buried in a fluff of\ncotton. Thorndyke eyed it professionally and took it; the nurse faded\nquietly from the room. \"Take it easy, Steve. This will--\"\n\n\"No! Not until I know--\"\n\n\"Easy,\" he repeated. He held the needle up before my eyes. \"Steve,\" he\nsaid, \"I don't know whether you have enough esper training to dig the\ncontents of this needle, but if you haven't, will you please trust me?\nThis contains a neurohypnotic. It won't put you under. It will leave you\nas wide awake as you are now, but it will disconnect your running gear\nand keep you from blowing a fuse.\" Then with swift deftness that amazed\nme, the doctor slid the needle into my arm and let me have the full\nload.\n\nI was feeling the excitement rise in me because something was wrong, but\nI could also feel the stuff going to work. Within half a minute I was in\na chilled-off frame of mind that was capable of recognizing the facts\nbut not caring much one way or the other.\n\nWhen he saw the stuff taking hold, Thorndyke asked, \"Steve, just who is\nCatherine?\"\n\nThe shock almost cut through the drug. My mind whirled with all the\nthings that Catherine was to me, and the doctor followed it every bit of\nthe way.\n\n\"Steve, you've been under an accident shock. There was no Catherine with\nyou. There was no one with you at all. Understand that and accept it. No\none. You were alone. Do you understand?\"\n\nI shook my head. I sounded to myself like an actor reading the script of\na play for the first time. I wanted to pound on the table and add the\nvigor of physical violence to my hoarse voice, but all I could do was to\nreply in a calm voice:\n\n\"Catherine was with me. We were--\" I let it trail off because Thorndyke\nknew very well what we were doing. We were eloping in the new definition\nof the word. Rhine Institute and its associated studies had changed a\nlot of customs; a couple intending to commit matrimony today were\ninclined to take off quietly and disappear from their usual haunts until\nthey'd managed to get intimately acquainted with one another. Elopement\nwas a means of finding some personal privacy.\n\nWe should have stayed at home and faced the crude jokes that haven't\nchanged since Pithecanthropus first discovered that sex was funny. But\nour mutual desire to find some privacy in this modern fish-bowl had put\nme in the hospital and Catherine--where--?\n\n\"Steve, listen to me!\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"I know you espers. You're sensitive, maybe more so than telepaths. More\nimagination--\"\n\nThis was for the birds in my estimation. Among the customs that Rhine\nhas changed was the old argument as to whether women or men were\nsmarter. Now the big argument was whether espers or telepaths could get\nalong better with the rest of the world.\n\nThorndyke laughed at my objections and went on: \"You're in accident\nshock. You piled up your car. You begin to imagine how terrible it would\nhave been if your Catherine had been with you. Next you carefully build\nup in your subconscious mind a whole and complete story, so well put\ntogether that to you it seems to be fact.\"\n\nBut, #--how could anyone have taken a look at the scene of the accident\nand not seen traces of woman? My woman.#\n\n\"We looked,\" he said in answer to my unspoken question. \"There was not a\ntrace, Steve.\"\n\n#Fingerprints?#\n\n\"You'd been dating her.\"\n\n#Naturally!#\n\nThorndyke nodded quietly. \"There were a lot of her prints on the remains\nof your car. But no one could begin to put a date on them, or tell how\nrecent was the latest, due to the fire. Then we made a door to door\ncanvas of the neighborhood to be sure she hadn't wandered off in a daze\nand shock. Not even a footprint. Nary a trace.\" He shook his head\nunhappily. \"I suppose you're going to ask about that travelling bag you\nclaim to have put in the trunk beside your own. There was no trace of\nany travelling bag.\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" I asked pointedly, \"if we weren't together, suppose you tell\nme first why I had a marriage license in my pocket; second, how come I\nmade a date with the Reverend Towle in Midtown; and third, why did I\nbother to reserve the bridal suite in the Reignoir Hotel in Westlake? Or\nwas I nuts a long time before this accident. Maybe,\" I added, \"after\nmaking reservations, I had to go out and pile myself up as an excuse for\nnot turning up with a bride.\"\n\n\"I--all I can say is that there was not a trace of woman in that\naccident.\"\n\n\"You've been digging in my mind. Did you dig her telephone number?\"\n\nHe looked at me blankly.\n\n\"And you found what, when you tried to call her?\"\n\n\"I--er--\"\n\n\"Her landlady told you that Miss Lewis was not in her apartment because\nMiss Lewis was on her honeymoon, operating under the name of Mrs. Steve\nCornell. That about it?\"\n\n\"All right. So now you know.\"\n\n\"Then where the hell is she, Doc?\" The drug was not as all-powerful as\nit had been and I was beginning to feel excitement again.\n\n\"We don't know, Steve.\"\n\n\"How about the guy that hauled me out of that wreck? What does he say?\"\n\n\"He was there when we arrived. The car had been hauled off you by block\nand tackle. By the time we got there the tackle had been burned and the\ncar was back down again in a crumpled mass. He is a farmer by the name\nof Harrison. He had one of his older sons with him, a man about\ntwenty-four, named Phillip. They both swore later that there was no\nwoman in that car nor a trace of one.\"\n\n\"Oh, he did, did he?\"\n\nDr. Thorndyke shook his head slowly and then said very gently. \"Steve,\nthere's no predicting what a man's mind will do in a case of shock. I've\nseen 'em come up with a completely false identity, all the way back to\nchildhood. Now, let's take your case once more. Among the other\nincredible items--\"\n\n\"Incredible?\" I roared.\n\n\"Easy. Hear me out. After all, am I to believe your unsubstantiated\nstory or the evidence of a whole raft of witnesses, the police detail,\nthe accident squad, and the guys who hauled you out of a burning car\nbefore it blew up? As I was saying, how can we credit much of your tale\nwhen you raved about one man lifting the car and the other hauling you\nout from underneath?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"That's obviously a mistaken impression. No one could--\"\n\n\"So when you admit that one hunk of your story is mistaken--\"\n\n\"That doesn't prove the rest is false!\"\n\n\"The police have been tracking this affair hard,\" said the doctor\nslowly. \"They've gotten nowhere. Tell me, did anyone see you leave that\napartment with Miss Lewis?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said slowly. \"No one that knew us.\"\n\nThorndyke shook his head unhappily. \"That's why we have to assume that\nyou are in post-accident shock.\"\n\nI snorted angrily. \"Then explain the license, the date with the\nreverend, the hotel reservation?\"\n\nThorndyke said quietly, \"Hear me out, Steve. This is not my own idea\nalone, but the combined ideas of a number of people who have studied the\nhuman mind--\"\n\n\"In other words, I'm nuts?\"\n\n\"No. Shock.\"\n\n\"Shock?\"\n\nHe nodded very slowly. \"Let's put it this way. Let's assume that you\nwanted this marriage with Miss Lewis. You made preparations, furnished\nan apartment, got a license, made a date with a preacher, reserved a\nhoneymoon suite, and bought flowers for the bride. You take off from\nwork, arrive at her door, only to find that Miss Lewis has taken off for\nparts unknown. Maybe she left you a letter--\"\n\n\"Letter!\"\n\n\"Hear me out, Steve. You arrive at her apartment and find her gone. You\nread a letter from her saying that she cannot marry you. This is a\nrather deep shock to you and you can't face it. Know what happens?\"\n\n\"I blow my brains out along a country road at ninety miles per hour.\"\n\n\"Please, this is serious.\"\n\n\"It sounds incredibly stupid to me.\"\n\n\"You're rejecting it in the same way you rejected the fact that Miss\nLewis ran away rather than marry you.\"\n\n\"Do go on, Doctor.\"\n\n\"You drive along the same road you'd planned to take, but the\nfrustration and shock pile up to put you in an accident-prone frame of\nmind. You then pile up, not consciously, but as soon as you come upon\nsomething like that tree limb which can be used to make an accident\nauthentic.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure.\"\n\nThorndyke eyed me soberly. \"Steve,\" he asked me in a brittle voice, \"you\nwon't try to convince me that any esper will let physical danger of that\nsort get close enough to--\"\n\n\"I've told you how it happened. My attention was on that busted sign!\"\n\n\"Fine. More evidence to the fact that Miss Lewis was with you? Now\nlisten to me. In accident-shock you'd not remember anything that your\nmind didn't want you to recall. Failure is a hard thing to take. So now\nyou can blame your misfortune on that accident.\"\n\n\"So now you tell me how you justify the fact that Catherine told\nlandladies, friends, bosses, and all the rest that she was going to\nmarry me a good long time before I was ready to be verbal about my\nplans?\"\n\n\"I--\"\n\n\"Suppose I've succeeded in bribing everybody to perjure themselves.\nMaybe we all had it in for Catherine, and did her in?\"\n\nThorndyke shrugged. \"I don't know,\" he said. \"I really don't know,\nSteve. I wish I did.\"\n\n\"That makes two of us,\" I grunted. \"Hasn't anybody thought of arresting\nme for kidnapping, suspicion of murder, reckless driving and cluttering\nup the highway with junk?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said quietly. \"The police were most thorough. They had two of\ntheir top men look into you.\"\n\n\"What did they find?\" I asked angrily. No man likes to have his mind\nturned inside out and laid out flat so that all the little wheels,\ncables and levers are open to the public gaze. On the other hand, since\nI was not only innocent of any crime but as baffled as the rest of them,\nI'd have gone to them willingly to let them dig, to see if they could\ndig past my conscious mind into the real truth.\n\n\"They found that your story was substantially an honest one.\"\n\n\"Then why all this balderdash about shock, rejection, and so on?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"None of us are supermen,\" he said simply. \"Your\nstory was honest, you weren't lying. You believe every word of it. You\nsaw it, you went through it. That doesn't prove your story true.\"\n\n\"Now see here--\"\n\n\"It does prove one thing; that you, Steve Cornell, did not have any\nmalicious, premeditated plans against Catherine Lewis. They've checked\neverything from hell to breakfast, and so far all we can do is make\nlong-distance guesses as to what happened.\"\n\nI snorted in my disgust. \"That's a telepath for you. Everything so\nneatly laid out in rows of slats like a snow fence. Me--I'm going to\nconsult a scholar and have him really dig me deep.\"\n\nThorndyke shook his head. \"They had their top men, Steve. Scholar\nRedfern and Scholar Berks. Both of them Rhine Scholars, _magna cum\nlaude_.\"\n\nI blinked as I always do when I am flabbergasted. I've known a lot of\ndoctors of this and that, from medicine to languages. I've even known a\nscholar or two, but none of them intimately. But when a doctor of psi is\ninvited to take his scholarte at Rhine, that's it, brother; I pass.\n\nThorndyke smiled. \"You weren't too bad yourself, Steve. Ran twelfth in\nyour class at Illinois, didn't you?\"\n\nI nodded glumly. \"I forgot to cover the facts. They'd called all the\nbright boys out and collected them under one special-study roof. I\nmajored in mechanical ingenuity not psi. Hoped to get a D. Ing. out of\nit, at least, but had to stop. Partly because I'm not ingenious enough\nand partly because I ran out of cash.\"\n\nDoctor Thorndyke nodded. \"I know how it is,\" he said. I realized that he\nwas leading me away from the main subject gently, but I couldn't see how\nto lead him back without starting another verbal hassle. He had me cold.\nHe could dig my mind and get the best way to lead me away, while I\ncouldn't read his. I gave up. It felt better, too, getting my mind off\nthis completely baffling puzzle even for a moment. He caught my thoughts\nbut his face didn't twitch a bit as he picked up his narrative smoothly:\n\n\"I didn't make it either,\" he said unhappily. \"I'm psi and good. But I'm\ntelepath and not esper. I weasled my way through pre-med and medical by\nmain force and awkwardness, so to speak.\" He grinned at me sheepishly.\n\"I'm not much different than you or any other psi. The espers all think\nthat perception is superior to the ability to read minds, and vice\nversa. I was going to show 'em that a telepath can make Scholar of\nMedicine. So I 'pathed my way through med by reading the minds of my\nfellows, who were all good espers. I got so good that I could read the\nmind of an esper watching me do a delicate dissecting job, and move my\nhands according to his perception. I could diagnose the deep ills with\nthe best of them--so long as there was an esper in the place.\"\n\n\"So what tripped you up?\"\n\n\"Telepaths make out best dealing with people. Espers do better with\nthings.\"\n\n\"Isn't medicine a field that deals with people?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Not when a headache means spinal tumor, or\nindigestion, or a bad cold. 'Doctor,' says the patient, 'I've a bad ache\nalong my left side just below the ribs,' and after you diagnose, it\nturns out to be acute appendicitis. You see, Steve, the patient doesn't\nknow what's wrong with him. Only the symptoms. A telepath can follow the\npatient's symptoms perfectly, but it takes an esper to dig in his guts\nand perceive the tumor that's pressing on the spine or the striae on his\nliver.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"So I flopped on a couple of tests that the rest of the class sailed\nthrough, just because I was not fast enough to read their minds and put\nmy own ability to work. It made 'em suspicious and so here I am, a mere\ndoctor instead of a scholar.\"\n\n\"There are fields for you, I'm sure.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Two. Psychiatry and psychology, neither of which I have any\nlove for. And medical research, where the ability to grasp another\ndoctor or scholar's plan, ideas and theories is slightly more important\nthan the ability to dig esper into the experiments.\"\n\n\"Don't see that,\" I said with a shake of my head.\n\n\"Well, Steve, let's take Mekstrom's Disease, for instance.\"\n\n\"Let's take something simple. What I know about Mekstrom's Disease could\nbe carved on the head of a pin with a blunt butter knife.\"\n\n\"Let's take Mekstrom's. That's my chance to make Scholar of Medicine,\nSteve, if I can come up with an answer to one of the minor questions.\nI'll be in the clinical laboratory where the only cases present are\nthose rare cases of Mekstrom's. The other doctors, espers every one of\nthem, and the scholars over them, will dig the man's body right down to\nthe last cell, looking and combing--you know some of the better espers\ncan actually dig into the constituency of a cell?--but I'll be the\ndoctor who can collect all their information, correlate it, and maybe\ncome up with an answer.\"\n\n\"You picked a dilly,\" I told him.\n\nIt was a real one, all right. Otto Mekstrom had been a mechanic-tech at\nWhite Sands Space Station during the first flight to Venus, Mars and\nMoon round-trip with landings. About two weeks after the ship came home,\nOtto Mekstrom's left fingertips began to grow hard. The hardening\ncrawled up slowly until his hand was like a rock. They studied him and\nworked over him and took all sorts of samples and made all sorts of\ntests until Otto's forearm was as hard as his hand. Then they amputated\nat the shoulder.\n\nBut by that time, Otto Mekstrom's toes on both feet were getting solid\nand his other hand was beginning to show signs of the same. On one side\nof the creepline the flesh was soft and normal, but on the other it was\nall you could do to poke a sharp needle into the skin. Poor Otto ended\nup a basket case, just in time to have the damned stuff start all over\nagain at the stumps of his arms and legs. He died when hardening reached\nhis vitals.\n\nSince that day, some twenty-odd years ago, there had been about thirty\ncases a year turn up. All fatal, despite amputations and everything else\nknown to modern medical science. God alone knew how many unfortunate\nhuman beings took to suicide without contacting the big Medical Research\nCenter at Marion, Indiana.\n\nWell, if Thorndyke could uncover something, no one could claim that a\ntelepath had no place in medicine. I wished him luck.\n\nI did not see Thorndyke again in that hospital. They released me the\nnext day and then I had nothing to do but to chew my fingernails and\nwonder what had happened to Catherine.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nI'd rather not go into the next week and a half in detail. I became\nknown as the bridegroom who lost his bride, and between the veiled\naccusations and the half-covered snickers, life was pretty miserable. I\ntalked to the police a couple-three times, first as a citizen asking for\ninformation and ending up as a complainant against party or parties\nunknown. The latter got me nowhere. Apparently the police had more lines\nout than the Grand Bank fishing fleet and were getting no more nibbles\nthan they'd get in the Dead Sea. They admitted it; the day had gone when\nthe police gave out news reports that an arrest was expected hourly,\nmeaning that they were baffled. The police, with their fine collection\nof psi boys, were willing to admit when they were really baffled. I\ntalked to telepaths who could tell me what I'd had for breakfast on the\nday I'd entered pre-school classes, and espers who could sense the color\nof the clothing I wore yesterday. I've a poor color-esper, primitive so\nto speak. These guys were good, but no matter how good they were,\nCatherine Lewis had vanished as neatly as Ambrose Bierce.\n\nI even read Charles Fort, although I have no belief in the supernatural,\nand rather faint faith in the Hereafter. And people who enter the\nHereafter leave their remains behind for evidence.\n\nHaving to face Catherine's mother and father, who came East to see me,\nmade me a complete mental wreck.\n\nIt is harder than you think to face the parents of a woman you loved,\nand find that all you can tell them is that somehow you fouled your\ndrive, cracked up, and lost their daughter. Not even dead-for-sure.\nDeath, I think, we all could have faced. But this uncertainty was\nsomething that gnawed at the soul's roots and left it rotting.\n\nTo stand there and watch the tears in the eyes of a woman as she asks\nyou, \"But can't you remember, son?\" is a little too much, and I don't\ncare to go into details.\n\nThe upshot of it was, after about ten days of lying awake nights and\nwondering where she was and why. Watching her eyes peer out of a metal\ncasting at me from a position sidewise of my head. Nightmares, either\nthe one about us turning over and over and over, or Mrs. Lewis pleading\nwith me only to tell her the truth. Then having the police inform me\nthat they were marking this case down as \"unexplained.\" I gave up. I\nfinally swore that I was going to find her and return with her, or I was\ngoing to join her in whatever strange, unknown world she had entered.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe first thing I did was to go back to the hospital in the hope that\nDr. Thorndyke might be able to add something. In my unconscious\nramblings there might be something that fell into a pattern if it could\nbe pieced together.\n\nBut this was a failure, too. The hospital super was sorry, but Dr.\nThorndyke had left for the Medical Research Center a couple of days\nbefore. Nor could I get in touch with him because he had a six-week\ninterim vacation and planned a long, slow jaunt through Yellowstone,\nwith neither schedule nor forwarding addresses.\n\nI was standing there on the steps hoping to wave down a cruising\ncoptercab when the door opened and a woman came out. I turned to look\nand she recognized me. It was Miss Farrow, my former nurse.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Cornell, what are you doing back here?\"\n\n\"Mostly looking for Thorndyke. He's not here.\"\n\n\"I know. Isn't it wonderful, though? He'll get his chance to study for\nhis scholarte now.\"\n\nI nodded glumly. \"Yeah,\" I said. It probably sounded resentful, but it\nis hard to show cheer over the good fortune of someone else when your\nown world has come unglued.\n\n\"Still hoping,\" she said. It was a statement and not a question.\n\nI nodded slowly. \"I'm hoping,\" I said. \"Someone has the answer to this\npuzzle. I'll have to find it myself. Everyone else has given up.\"\n\n\"I wish you luck,\" said Miss Farrow with a smile. \"You certainly have\nthe determination.\"\n\nI grunted. \"It's about all I have. What I need is training. Here I am, a\nmechanical engineer, about to tackle the job of a professional detective\nand tracer of missing persons. About all I know about the job is what I\nhave read. One gets the idea that these writers must know something of\nthe job, the way they write about it. But once you're faced with it\nyourself, you realize that the writer has planted his own clues.\"\n\nMiss Farrow nodded. \"One thing,\" she suggested, \"have you talked to the\npeople who got you out from under your car yet?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't. The police talked to them and claimed they knew nothing.\nI doubt that I can ask them anything that the police have not satisfied\nthemselves about.\"\n\nMiss Farrow looked up at me sidewise. \"You won't find anything by asking\npeople who have never heard of you.\"\n\n\"I suppose not.\"\n\nA coptercab came along at that moment, and probably sensing my\nintention, he gave his horn a tap. I'd have liked to talk longer with\nMiss Farrow, but a cab was what I wanted, so with a wave I took it and\nshe went on down the steps to her own business.\n\nI had to pause long enough to buy a new car, but a few hours afterward I\nwas rolling along that same highway with my esper extended as far as I\ncould in all directions. I was driving slowly, this time both alert and\nready.\n\nI went past the scene of the accident slowly and shut my mind off as I\nsaw the black-burned patch. The block was still hanging from an overhead\nbranch, and the rope that had burned off was still dangling, about two\nfeet of it, looped through the pulleys and ending in a tapered, burned\nend.\n\nI turned left into a driveway toward the home of the Harrisons and went\nalong a winding dirt road, growing more and more conscious of a dead\narea ahead of me.\n\nIt was not a real dead zone, because I could still penetrate some of the\nregion. But as far as really digging any of the details of the rambling\nHarrison house, I could get more from my eyesight than from any sense of\nperception. But even if they couldn't find a really dead area, the\nHarrisons had done very well in finding one that made my sense of\nperception ineffective. It was sort of like looking through a light fog,\nand the closer I got to the house the thicker it became.\n\nJust about the point where the dead area was first beginning to make its\neffect tell, I came upon a tall, browned man of about twenty-four who\nhad been probing into the interior of a tractor up to the time he heard\nmy car. He waved, and I stopped.\n\n\"Mr. Harrison?\"\n\n\"I'm Phillip. And you are Mr. Cornell.\"\n\n\"Call me Steve like everybody else,\" I said. \"How'd you guess?\"\n\n\"Recognized you,\" he said with a grin. \"I'm the guy that pulled you\nout.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said, offering a hand.\n\nHe chuckled. \"Steve, consider the hand taken and shook, because I've\nenough grime to muss up a regiment.\"\n\n\"It won't bother me,\" I said.\n\n\"Thanks, but it's still a gesture, and I appreciate it, but let's be\nsensible. I know you can wash, but let's shake later. What can I do for\nyou?\"\n\n\"I'd like a first-hand account, Phil.\"\n\n\"Not much to tell. Dad and I were pulling stumps over about a thousand\nfeet from the wreck. We heard the racket. I am esper enough to dig that\ndistance with clarity, so we knew we'd better bring along the block and\ntackle. The tractor wouldn't go through. So we came on the double, Dad\nrigged the tackle and hoisted and I took a running dive, grabbed and\nhauled you out before the whole thing went _Whoosh!_ We were both lucky,\nSteve.\"\n\nI grunted a bit but managed to nod with a smile.\n\n\"I suppose you know that I'm still trying to find my fianc\u00e9e?\"\n\n\"I'd heard tell,\" he said. He looked at me sharply. I'm a total blank as\na telepath, like all espers, but I could tell what he was thinking.\n\n\"Everybody is convinced that Catherine was not with me,\" I admitted.\n\"But I'm not. I know she was.\"\n\nHe shook his head slowly. \"As soon as we heard the screech of brakes and\nrubber we esped the place,\" he said quietly. \"We dug you, of course. But\nno one else. Even if she'd jumped as soon as that tree limb came into\nview, she could not have run far enough to be out of range. As for\nremoving a bag, she'd have had to wait until the slam-bang was over to\nget it out, and by the time your car was finished rolling, Dad and I\nwere on the way with help. She was not there, Steve.\"\n\n#You're a goddam liar!#\n\nPhillip Harrison did not move a muscle. He was blank telepathically. I\nwas esping the muscles in his stomach, under his loose clothing, for\nthat first tensing sign of anger, but nothing showed. He had not been\nreading my mind.\n\nI smiled thinly at Phil Harrison and shrugged.\n\nHe smiled back sympathetically, but behind it I could see that he was\nwishing that I'd stop harping on a dead subject. \"I sincerely wish I\ncould be of help,\" he said. In that he was sincere. But somewhere,\nsomeone was not, and I wanted to find out who it was.\n\nThe impasse looked as though it might go on forever unless I turned away\nand left. I had no desire to leave. Not that Phil could help me, but\neven though this was a dead end, I was loath to leave the place because\nit was the last place where I had been close to Catherine.\n\nThe silence between us must have been a bit strained at this point, but\nluckily we had an interruption. I perceived motion, turned and caught\nsight of a woman coming along the road toward us.\n\n\"My sister,\" said Phil. \"Marian.\"\n\nMarian Harrison was quite a girl; if I'd not been emotionally tied to\nCatherine Lewis, I'd have been happy to invite myself in. Marian was\nalmost as tall as I am, a dark, brown-haired woman with eyes of a\nstartling, electricity colored blue. She was about twenty-two, young and\nhealthy. Her skin was tanned toast brown so that the bright blue eyes\nfairly sparked out at you. Her red mouth made a pleasing blend with the\ntan of her skin and her teeth gleamed white against the dark when she\nsmiled.\n\nInsultingly, I made some complimentary but impolite mental observations\nabout her figure, but Marion did not appear to notice. She was no\ntelepath.\n\n\"You're Mr. Cornell,\" she said, \"I remembered you,\" she said quietly.\n\"Please believe us, Mr. Cornell, when we extend our sympathy.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" I said glumly. \"Please understand me, Miss Harrison. I\nappreciate your sympathy, but what I need is action and information and\nanswers. Once I get those, the sympathy won't be needed.\"\n\n\"Of course I understand,\" she replied instantly. \"We are all aware that\nsympathy is a poor substitute. All the world grieving with you doesn't\nturn a stitch to help you out of your trouble. All we can do is to wish,\nwith you, that it hadn't happened.\"\n\n\"That's the point,\" I said helplessly. \"I don't even know what\nhappened.\"\n\n\"That makes it even worse,\" she said softly. Marian had a pleasant\nvoice, throaty and low, that sounded intimate even when talking about\nsomething pragmatic. \"I wish we could help you, Steve.\"\n\n\"I wish someone could.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"They asked me about it, too, even though I was not present\nuntil afterward. They asked me,\" she said thoughtfully, \"about the\nmental attitude of a woman running off to get married. I told them that\nI couldn't speak for your woman, but that I might be able to speak for\nme, putting myself in the same circumstances.\"\n\nShe paused a moment, and her brother turned idly back to his tractor and\nfitted a small end wrench to a bolt-head and gave it a twist. He seemed\nto think that as long as Marian and I were talking, he could well afford\nto get along with his work. I agreed with him. I wanted information, but\nI did not expect the entire world to stop progress to help me. He spun\nthe bolt and started on another, lost in his job while Marian went on:\n\n\"I told them that your story was authentic--the one about the bridal\nnightgown.\" A very slight color came under the deep tan. \"I told them\nthat I have one, too, still in its wrapper, and that someday I'd be\nplanning marriage and packing a go-away bag with the gown shaken out and\nthen packed neatly. I told them that I'd be doing the same thing no\nmatter whether we were having a formal church wedding with a four-alarm\nreception and all the trimmings or a quiet elopement such as you were. I\ntold them that it was the essentials that count, not the trimmings and\nthe tinsel. My questioner's remark was to the effect that either you\nwere telling the truth, or that you had esped a woman about to marry and\nidentified her actions with your own wishes.\"\n\n\"I know which,\" I said with a sour smile. \"It was both.\"\n\nMarian nodded. \"Then they asked me if it were probable that a woman\nwould take this step completely unprepared and I laughed at them. I told\nthem that long before Rhine, women were putting their nuptial affairs in\norder about the time the gentleman was beginning to view marriage with\nan attitude slightly less than loathing, and that by the time he popped\nthe question, she'd been practicing writing her name as 'Mrs.' and\npicking out the china-ware and prospective names for the children, and\nthat if any woman had ever been so stunned by a proposal of marriage\nthat she'd take off without so much as a toothbrush, no one in history\nhad ever heard of her.\"\n\n\"Then you begin to agree with me?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Please,\" she said in that low voice, \"don't ask me my\nopinion of your veracity. You believe it, but all the evidence lies\nagainst you. There was not a shred of woman-trace anywhere along your\ncourse, from the point along the road where you first caught sight of\nthe limb that threw you to the place where you piled up. Nor was there a\ntrace anywhere in a vast circle--almost a half mile they searched--from\nthe crack-up. They had doctors of psi digging for footprints, shreds of\nclothing, everything. Not a trace.\"\n\n\"But where did she go?\" I cried, and when I say 'cried' I mean just\nthat.\n\nMarian shook her head very slowly. \"Steve,\" she said in a voice so low\nthat I could hardly hear her over the faint shrill of bolts being\nunscrewed by her brother, \"so far as we know, she was never here. Why\ndon't you forget her--\"\n\nI looked at her. She stood there, poised and a bit tensed as though she\nwere trying to force some feeling of affectionate kinhood across the gap\nthat separated us, as though she wanted to give me both physical and\nmental comfort despite the fact that we were strangers on a ten-minute\nfirst-meeting. There was distress in her face.\n\n\"Forget her--?\" I ground out. \"I'd rather die!\"\n\n\"Oh Steve--no!\" One hand went to her throat and the other came out to\nfasten around my forearm. Her grip was hard.\n\nI stood there wondering what to do next. Marian's grip on my arm relaxed\nand she stepped back.\n\nI pulled myself together. \"I'm sorry,\" I told her honestly. \"I'm putting\nyou through a set of emotional hurdles by bringing my problems here. I'd\nbetter take them away.\"\n\nShe nodded very slowly. \"Please go. But please come back once you get\nyourself squared away, no matter how. We'd all like to see you when you\naren't all tied up inside.\"\n\nPhil looked up from the guts of the tractor. \"Take it easy, Steve,\" he\nsaid. \"And remember that you do have friends here.\"\n\nBlindly I turned from them and stumbled back to my car. They were a pair\nof very fine people, firm, upright. Marian's grip on my arm had been no\nweaker than her sympathy, and Phil's less-emotional approach to my\ntrouble was no less deep, actually. It was as strong as his good right\narm, loosening the head bolts of a tractor engine with a small\nadjustable wrench.\n\nI'd be back. I wanted to see them again. I wanted to go back there with\nCatherine and introduce them to her. But I was definitely going to go\nback.\n\nI was quite a way toward home before I realized that I had not met the\nold man. I bet myself that Father Harrison was quite the firm, active\npatriarch.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThe days dragged slowly. I faced each morning hopefully at first, but as\nthe days dragged on and on, I began to feel that each morning was\nopening another day of futility, to be barely borne until it was time to\nflop down in weariness. I faced the night in loneliness and in anger at\nmy own inability to do something productive.\n\nI pestered the police until they escorted me to the door and told me\nthat if I came again, they'd take me to another kind of door and loose\nthereafter the key. I shrugged and left disconsolately, because by that\ntime I had been able to esp, page by page, the entire file that dealt\nwith the case of \"Missing Person: Lewis, Catherine,\" stamped \"Inactive,\nbut not Closed.\"\n\nI hated the words.\n\nBut as the days dragged out, one after another, with no respite and no\nhope, my raw nervous system began to heal. It was probably a case of\nnumbness; you maul your thumb with a hammer and it will hurt just so\nlong before it stops.\n\nI was numb for a long time. I remember night after night, lying awake\nand staring into the darkness at the wall I knew was beside me, and I\nhated my esper because I wanted to project my mind out across some\nunknown space to reach for Catherine's mind. If we'd both been telepaths\nwe could cross the universe to touch each other with that affectionate\ntenderness that mated telepaths always claim they have.\n\nInstead I found myself more aware of a clouded-veil perception of Marian\nHarrison as she took my arm and looked into my face on that day when I\nadmitted that I found little worth living for.\n\nI knew what that meant--nothing. It was a case of my subconscious mind\npointing out that the available present was more desirable than the\nunavailable not-present. At first I resented my apparent inconstancy in\nforming an esper projection of Marian Harrison when I was trying to\nproject my blank telepathic inadequacy to Catherine. But as the weeks\nfaded into the past, the shock and the frustration began to pale and I\nfound Marian's projective image less and less an unwanted intrusion and\nmore and more pleasant.\n\nI had two deeply depressed spells in those six weeks. At the end of the\nfourth week I received a small carton containing some of my personal\njunk that had been in Catherine's apartment. A man can't date his girl\nfor weeks without dropping a few things like a cigarette lighter, a tie\nclip, one odd cuff-link, some papers, a few letters, some books, and\nstuff both valuable and worthless that had turned up as gifts for one\nreason or another. It was a shock to get this box and its arrival\nbounced me deep into a doldrum-period of three or four days.\n\nThen at the end of the sixth week I received a card from Dr. Thorndyke.\nIt contained a lithograph in stereo of some scene in Yellowstone other\nthan Old Faithful blowing its stack.\n\nOn the message side was a cryptic note:\n\n     _Steve: I just drove along that road in the right side of the\n     picture. It reminded me of yours, so I'm writing because I want to\n     know how you are making out. I'll be at the Med-Center in a couple\n     of weeks, you can write me there.\n\n     Jim Thorndyke._\n\nI turned the postcard over and eyed it critically. Then I got it. Along\nthe roadside was a tall ornamental standard of wrought iron. The same\ndesign as the road signs along that fatal highway of mine.\n\nI sat there with a magnifying glass on the roadsign; its stereo image\nstanding up alongside the road in full color and solidity. It took me\nback to that moment when Catherine had wriggled against my side,\nthrilling me with her warmth and eagerness.\n\nThat put me down a few days, too.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother month passed. I'd come out of my shell quite a bit in the\nmeantime. I now felt that I could walk in a bar and have a drink without\nwondering whether all the other people in the place were pointing at me.\nI'd cut myself off from all my previous friends, and I'd made no new\nfriends in the weeks gone by. But I was getting more and more lonely and\nconsequently more and more inclined to speak to people and want friends.\n\nThe accident had paled from its original horror; the vital scene\nreturned only infrequently. Catherine was assuming the position of a\nlost love rather than a sweetheart expected to return soon. I remembered\nthe warmth of her arms and the eagerness of her kiss in a nostalgic way\nand my mind, especially when in a doze, would play me tricks. I would\nrecall Catherine, but when she came into my arms, I'd be holding Marian,\nbrown and tawny, with her electric blue eyes and her vibrant nature.\n\nBut I did nothing about it. I knew that once I had asked Marian Harrison\nfor a date I would be emotionally involved. And then if--no,\nwhen--Catherine turned up I would be torn between desires.\n\nI would wake up and call myself all sorts of a fool. I had seen Marian\nfor a total of perhaps fifteen minutes--in the company of her brother.\n\nBut eventually dreaming loses its sting just as futile waiting and\nsearching does, and I awoke one morning in a long and involved debate\nbetween my id and my conscience. I decided at that moment that I would\ntake that highway out and pay a visit to the Harrison farm. I was\nsalving my slightly rusty conscience by telling myself that it was\nbecause I had never paid my respects to Father Harrison, but not too\ndeep inside I knew that if Father were missing and Daughter were present\nI'd enjoy my visit to the farm with more relish.\n\nBut my id took a licking because the doorbell rang about nine o'clock\nthat morning and when I dug the doorstep I came up with two gentlemen\nwearing gold badges in leather folders in their jacket pockets.\n\nI opened the door because I couldn't have played absent to a team\nconsisting of one esper and one telepath. They both knew I was home.\n\n\"Mr. Cornell, we'll waste no time. We want to know how well you know\nDoctor James Thorndyke.\"\n\nI didn't blink at the bluntness of it. It is standard technique when an\nesper-telepath team go investigating. The telepath knew all about me,\nincluding the fact that I'd dug their wallets and identification cards,\nbadges and the serial numbers of the nasty little automatics they\ncarried. The idea was to drive the important question hard and first; it\nbeing impossible to not-think the several quick answers that pop through\nyour mind. What I knew about Thorndyke was sketchy enough but they got\nit all because I didn't have any reason for covering up. I let them know\nthat, too.\n\nFinally, #That's about all,# I thought. #Now--why?#\n\nThe telepath half of the team answered. \"Normally we wouldn't answer,\nMr. Cornell, unless you said it aloud. But we don't mind letting you\nknow which of us is the telepath this time. To answer, you are the last\nperson to have received any message from Thorndyke.\"\n\n\"I--what?\"\n\n\"That postcard. It was the last contact Thorndyke made with anyone. He\nhas disappeared.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Thorndyke was due to arrive at The Medical Research Center in Marion,\nIndiana, three weeks ago. We've been tracking him ever since he failed\nto turn up. We've been able to retrace his meanderings very well up to a\ncertain point in Yellowstone. There the trail stops. He had a telephoned\nreservation to a small hotel; there he dropped out of sight. Now, Mr.\nCornell, may I see that postcard?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\" I got it for them. The esper took it over to the window and\neyed it in the light, and as he did that I went over to stand beside him\nand together we espered that postcard until I thought the edges would\nstart to curl. But if there were any codes, concealed writings or any\nother form of hidden meaning or message in or on that card, I didn't dig\nany.\n\nI gave up. I'm no trained investigator. But I knew that Thorndyke was\nfairly well acquainted with the depth of my perceptive sense, and he\nwould not have concealed anything too deep for me.\n\nThen the esper shook his head. He handed me the card. \"Not a trace.\"\n\nThe telepath nodded. He looked at me and smiled sort of thin and\nstrained. \"We're naturally interested in you, Mr. Cornell. This seems to\nbe the second disappearance. And you know nothing about either.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said slowly. The puzzle began to go around and around in my\nhead again, all the way back to that gleaming road and the crack-up.\n\n\"We'll probably be back, Mr. Cornell. You don't mind?\"\n\n\"Look,\" I told them rather firmly, \"if this puzzle can be unwound, I'll\nbe one of the happiest men on the planet. If I can do anything to help,\njust say the word.\"\n\nThey left after that and so did I. I was still going to pay my visit to\nthe Harrison farm. Another wild goose chase, but somewhere along this\ncockeyed row there was an angle. Honest people who are healthy and\nfairly happy with good prospects ahead of them do not just drop out of\nsight without a trace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA couple of hours later I was making a good pace along the highway\nagain. It was getting familiar to me.\n\nI could not avoid letting my perceptive sense rest on the sign as I\ndrove past. Not long enough to put me in danger, but long enough to\ndiscover to my surprise that someone had taken the trouble to repair the\nbroken spoke. Someone must have been a perfectionist. The break was so\nslight that it seemed like calling in a mechanic because the ashtray in\nthe car is full.\n\nThen I noticed other changes that time had caused.\n\nThe burned scar was fading in a growth of tall weeds. The limb of the\ntree that hung out over the scene, from which block and tackle had hung,\nwas beginning to lose its smoke-blackened appearance. The block was gone\nfrom the limb.\n\n_Give us a year_, I thought, _and the only remaining scar will be the\none on my mind, and even that will be fading_.\n\nI turned into the drive, wound around the homestead road, and pulled up\nin front of the big, rambling house.\n\nIt looked bleak. The front lawn was a bit shaggy and there were some\nwisps of paper on the front porch. The venetian blinds were down and\nslatted shut behind closed windows. Since it was summer by now, the\nclosed windows and the tight door, neither of which had flyscreens\ninstalled, quickly gave the fact away. The Harrisons were gone.\n\nAnother disappearance?\n\nI turned quickly and drove to the nearest town and went to the post\noffice.\n\n\"I'm looking for the Harrison family,\" I told the man behind the wicket.\n\n\"Why, they moved several weeks ago.\"\n\n\"Moved?\" I asked with a blank-sounding voice.\n\nThe clerk nodded. Then he leaned forward and said in a confidential\nwhisper, \"Heard a rumor that the girl got a touch of that spacemen's\ndisease.\"\n\n\"Mekstrom's?\" I blurted.\n\nThe clerk looked at me as if I'd shouted a dirty word. \"She was a fine\ngirl,\" he said softly. \"It's a shame.\"\n\nI nodded and he went into the back files. I tried to dig alone behind\nhim, but the files were in a small dead area in the rear of the\nbuilding. I swore under my breath although I'd expected to find files in\ndead areas. Just as Rhine Institute was opened, the Government combed\nthe countryside for dead or cloudy areas for their secret and\nconfidential files. There had been one mad claim-staking rush with the\nGovernment about six feet ahead of the rest of the general public,\nbusiness and the underworld.\n\nHe came back with a sorrowful look. \"They left a concealed address,\" he\nsaid.\n\nI felt like flashing a twenty at him like a private eye did in the old\ntough-books, but I knew it wouldn't work. Rhine also made it impossible\nfor a public official to take a bribe. So instead, I tried to look\ndistressed.\n\n\"This is extremely important. I'd say it was a matter of life and\ndeath.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. A concealed forwarding address is still concealed. If you\nmust get in touch with them, you might drop them a letter to be\nforwarded. Then if they care to answer, they'll reply to your home.\"\n\n\"Later,\" I told him. \"I'll probably be back to mail it direct from\nhere.\"\n\nHe waved at the writing desk. I nodded and left.\n\nI drove back to the ex-Harrison Farm slowly, thinking it over.\nWondering. People did not just go around catching Mekstrom's Disease,\nfrom what little I knew of it. And somehow the idea of Marian Harrison\nwithering away or becoming a basket case, or maybe taking the painless\nway out was a thought that my mind kept avoiding except for occasional\nflashes of horror.\n\nI drove in toward the farmhouse again and parked in front of the\nverandah. I was not sure of why I was there except that I wanted to\nwander through it to see what I could find before I went back to the\npost-office to write that card or letter.\n\nThe back of the house was locked with an old-fashioned slide bolt that\nwas turned with what they used to call an \"E\" key. I shrugged, oiled my\nconscience and found a bit of bent wire. Probing a lock like that would\nhave been easy for a total blank; with esper I lifted the simple keepers\nand slid back the bolt almost as swiftly as if I had used a proper key.\n\nThis was no case of disappearance. In every one of the fourteen rooms\nwere the unmistakable signs of a deliberate removal. Discarded stuff was\nmixed with the odds and ends of packing case materials, a scattered\ncollection of temporary nails, a half-finished but never used box filled\nwith old clothing.\n\nI pawed through this but found nothing, even though I separated it from\nthe rest to help my esper dig it without interference.\n\nI roamed the house slowly letting my perception wander from point to\npoint. I tried to time-dig the place but that was futile. I didn't have\nenough perception.\n\nI caught only one response. It was in one of the upper bedrooms. But\nthen as I stopped in the room where Marian had slept, I began again to\ndoubt my senses. It could have been esper, but it was more likely that\nI'd caught the dying traces of perfume.\n\nThen I suddenly realized that the entire premises were clear to me!\n\nAn esper map of the world looked sort of like a mottled sky, with bright\nplaces and cloudy patches strewn in disorder across it. A mottled sky,\nexcept that the psi-pattern usually does not change. But this house had\nbeen in a murky area, if not dead. Now it was clear.\n\nI left the house and went to the big combination barn and garage. It was\nas unsatisfying as the house had been. Phillip Harrison, or someone, had\nhad a workshop out there. I found the bench and a small table where\nbolt-holes, oil marks, and other traces said that there had been one of\nthose big combination woodworking machines there, the kind that combines\ncircular saw, drill, lathe, planer, router, dado, and does everything.\nThere had been some metal-working stuff there, too, but nothing as\nelaborate as the woodshop. Mostly things like hacksaws and an electric\ndrill, and a circular scar where a blowtorch had been sitting.\n\nI don't know why I kept on standing there esping the abandoned set-up.\nMaybe it was because my esper dug the fact that there was something\nthere that I should know about, but which was so minute or remote that\nthe impression did not come through. I stood there puzzled at my own\nreluctance to leave until something satisfied that almost imperceptible\nimpression.\n\nIdly I leaned down and picked up a bit of metal from the floor and\nfumbled it in my hand nervously. I looked around the place with my eyes\nand saw nothing. I gave the whole garage a thorough scanning with my\nesper and got zero for my trouble.\n\nFinally I snarled at myself for being an imbecile, and left.\n\nEveryone has done what I did, time and time again. I do not recall\nanything of my walk back to the car, lost in a whirl of thoughts, ideas,\nplans and questions. I would probably have driven all the way back to my\napartment with my mind in that whirligig, driving by habit and training,\nbut I was shaken out of it because I could not start my car by poking\nthat bit of metal in the lock. It did not fit.\n\nI laughed, a bit ashamed of my preoccupation, and flung the bit of metal\ninto the grass, poked my key in the lock--\n\nAnd then I was out pawing the grass for that piece of metal.\n\nFor the small piece of metal I had found on the floor of the abandoned\nworkshop was the spoke of that road sign that had been missing when\nCatherine and I cracked up!\n\nI drove out along the highway and stopped near one of the standards. I\nesped the sign, compared my impression against my eyesight. I made sure.\n\nThat bit of metal, a half inch long and a bit under a quarter inch in\ndiameter, with both ends faintly broken-ragged, was identical in size\nand shape to the unbroken spokes in the sign!\n\nThen I noticed something else. The trefoil ornament in the middle did\nnot look the same as I recalled them. I took Thorndyke's card out of my\npocket and looked at the stereo. I compared the picture against the real\nthing before me and I knew that I was right.\n\nThe trefoil gizmo was a take-off on the fleur-de-lis or the Boy Scout\nTenderfoot badge, or the design they use to signify North on a compass.\nBut the lower flare of the leaves was wider than any of the more\nfamiliar emblems; almost as wide as the top. It took a comparison to\ntell the difference between one of them right-side-up and another one\nupside-down. One assumes for this design that the larger foils are\nsupposed to be up. If that were so, then the ones along that road out\nthere in or near Yellowstone were right-side-up, while the ones along my\nfamiliar highway were upside-down.\n\nI goaded myself. #Memory, have these things been turned or were they\nalways upside-down?#\n\nThe last thing I did as I turned off the highway was to stop and let my\nesper dig that design once more. I covered the design itself, let my\nperception roam along the spokes, and then around the circlet that\nsupported the spokes that held the trefoil emblem.\n\nOh, it was not obvious. It was designed in, so to speak. If I were asked\neven today for my professional opinion I would have to admit that the\nway the circlet snapped into the rest of the ornamental scrollwork was a\nmatter of good assembly design, and not a design deliberately created so\nthat the emblem could be turned upside down.\n\nIn fact, if it had not been for that tiny, broken spoke I found on the\nfloor of the Harrison garage, never in a million years would I have\nconsidered these road signs significant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the post office I wrote a letter to Phillip Harrison:\n\n     _Dear Phil:_\n\n     _I was by your old place today and was sorry to find that you had\n     moved. I'd like to get in touch with you again. If I may ask,\n     please send me your forwarding address. I'll keep it concealed if\n     you like, or I'll reply through the post office, concealed\n     forward._\n\n     _As an item of interest, did you know that your house has lost its\n     deadness? A medium-equipped esper can dig it with ease. Have you\n     ever heard of the psi-pattern changing before?_\n\n     _Ah, and another item, that road sign with the busted spoke has\n     been replaced. You must be a bum shot, not to hit that curlicue in\n     the middle. I found the spoke you hit on the floor of your garage,\n     if you'd like it for a souvenir of one close miss._\n\n     _Please write and let me know how things are going. Rumor has it\n     that Marian contracted Mekstrom's and if you will pardon my\n     mentioning a delicate subject, I am doing so because I really want\n     to help if I am able. After all, no matter how lightly you hold it,\n     I still owe you my life. This is a debt I do not intend to forget._\n\n     _Sincerely,_\n\n     _Steve Cornell._\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nI did not go to the police.\n\nThey were sick of my face and already considering me a candidate for the\nparanoid ward. All I would have to do is go roaring into the station to\ntell them that I had uncovered some deep plot where the underground was\nusing ornamental road signs to conceal their own network of roads and\ndirections, and that the disappearance of Catherine Lewis, Dr. Thorndyke\nand the removal of the Harrisons were all tied together.\n\nInstead, I closed my apartment and told everyone that I was going to\ntake a long, rambling tourist jaunt to settle my nerves; that I thought\ngetting away from the scene might finish the job that time and rest had\nstarted.\n\nThen I started to drive. I drove for several days, not attempting to\npace off miles, but covering a lot of aimless-direction territory. I was\njust as likely to spend four hours going North on one highway, and then\ntake the next four coming back South on a parallel highway, and\nsometimes I even came back to the original starting place. After a week\nI had come no farther West than across that sliver of West Virginia into\nEastern Ohio. And in Eastern Ohio I saw some more of the now familiar\nand suspicious road signs.\n\nThe emblem was right side up, and the signs looked as though they had\nnot been up long.\n\nI followed that road for seventy-five miles, and as I went the signs\nkept getting newer and newer until I finally came to a truck loaded with\npipe, hardware, and ornamental ironwork. Leading the truck was one of\nthose iron mole things.\n\nI watched the automatic gear hoist one of the old pipe and white and\nblack enamel roadsigns up by its roots, and place it on a truck full of\ndiscards. I watched the mole drive a corkscrew blade into the ground\nwith a roaring of engine and bucking of the truck. It paused, pulled\nupward to bring out the screw and its load of dirt, stones and gravel.\nThe crew placed one of the new signs in the cradle and I watched the\nmachine set the sign upright, pour the concrete, tamp down the earth,\nand then move along down the road.\n\nThere was little point in asking questions of the crew, so I just took\noff and drove to Columbus as hard as I could make it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShined, cleaned, polished, and very conservatively dressed, I presented\nmyself to the State Commissioner of Roads and Highways. I toyed briefly\nwith the idea of representing myself as a minor official from some\ndistant state like Alaska or the Virgin Islands, inquiring about these\nsigns for official reasons. But then I knew that if I bumped into a hot\ntelepath I'd be in the soup. On the other hand, mere curiosity on the\npart of a citizen, well oiled with compliments, would get me at the very\nleast a polite answer.\n\nThe Commissioner's fifth-under-secretary bucked me down the hall;\nanother office bucked me upstairs. A third buck-around brought me to the\nDepartment of Highways Marking and Road Maps.\n\nA sub-secretary finally admitted that he might be able to help me. His\nname was Houghton. But whether he was telepath or esper did not matter\nbecause the Commission building was constructed right in the middle of a\ndead area.\n\nI still played it straight. I told him I was a citizen of New York,\ninterested in the new road signs, Ohio was to be commended, et cetera.\n\n\"I'm glad you feel that way,\" he said beaming.\n\n\"I presume these signs cost quite a bit more than the stark, black and\nwhite enamel jobs?\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" he said with pride. \"They might, but mass-production\nmethods brought the cost down. You see, the enamel jobs, while we buy\nseveral thousand of the plates for any highway, must be set up, stamped\nout, enamelled, and so on. The new signs are all made in one plant as\nthey are needed; I don't suppose you know, but the highway number and\nany other information is put on the plate from loose, snap-in letters.\nThat means we can buy so many thousand of this or that letter or number,\nand the necessary base plates and put them together as needed. They\nadmitted that they were still running at a loss, but if they could get\nenough states interested, they'd eventually come out even, and maybe\nthey could reduce the cost. Why, they even have a contingent-clause in\nthe contract stating that if the cost were lowered, they would make a\nrebate to cover it. That's so the first users will not bide their time\ninstead of buying now.\"\n\nHe went on and on and on like any bureaucrat. I was glad we were in a\ndead area because he'd have thrown me out of his office for what I was\nthinking.\n\nEventually Mr. Houghton ran down and I left.\n\nI toyed around with the idea of barging in on the main office of the\ncompany but I figured that might be too much like poking my head into a\nhornet's nest.\n\nI pocketed the card he gave me from the company, and I studied the\nink-fresh road map, which he had proudly supplied. It pointed out in a\nreplica panel of the fancy signs, that the State of Ohio was beautifying\ntheir highways with these new signs at no increased cost to the\ntaxpayer, and that the dates in green on the various highways here and\nthere gave the dates when the new signs would be installed. The bottom\nof the panel gave the Road Commissioner's name in boldface with\nHoughton's name below in slightly smaller print.\n\nI smiled. Usually I get mad at signs that proclaim that such and such a\ntunnel is being created by Mayor So-and-so, as if the good mayor were\nout there with a shovel and hoe digging the tunnel. But this sort of\nthing would have been a worthy cause if it hadn't been for the sinister\nside.\n\nI selected a highway that had been completed toward Cincinnati and made\nmy way there with no waste of time.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe road was new and it was another beaut. The signs led me on, mile\nafter mile and sign after sign.\n\nI did not know what I was following, and I was not sure I knew what I\nwas looking for. But I was on the trail of something and a bit of\nactivity, both mental and physical, after weeks of blank-wall\nfrustration made my spirits rise and my mental equipment sharper. The\nradio in the car was yangling with hillbilly songs, the only thing you\ncan pick up in Ohio, but I didn't care. I was looking for something\nsignificant.\n\nI found it late in the afternoon about half-way between Dayton and\nCincinnati. One of the spokes was missing.\n\nFifty yards ahead was a crossroad.\n\nI hauled in with a whine of rubber and brakes, and sat there trying to\nreason out my next move by logic. Do I turn with the missing spoke, or\ndo I turn with the one that is not missing?\n\nMemory came to my aid. The \"ten o'clock\" spoke had been missing back\nthere near the Harrison farm. The Harrisons had lived on the left side\nof the highway. One follows the missing spoke. Here the \"two o'clock\"\nspoke was missing, so I turned to the right along the crossroad until I\ncame to another sign that was complete.\n\nThen, wondering, I U-turned and drove back across the main highway and\ndrove for about five miles watching the signs as I went. The ones on my\nright had that trefoil emblem upside down. The ones on my left were\nright side up. The difference was so small that only someone who knew\nthe significance would distinguish one from the other. So far as I could\nreason out, it meant that what I sought was in the other direction. When\nthe emblem was upside down I was going away from, and when right side\nup, I was going toward.\n\nAway from or toward what?\n\nI U-turned again and started following the signs.\n\nTwenty miles beyond the main highway where I'd seen the sign that\nannounced the turn, I came upon another missing spoke. This indicated a\nturn to the left, and so I slowed down until I came upon a homestead\nroad leading off toward a farmhouse.\n\nI turned, determined to make like a man lost and hoping that I'd not\nbump into a telepath.\n\nA few hundred yards in from the main road I came upon a girl who was\nwalking briskly toward me. I stopped. She looked at me with a quizzical\nsmile and asked me if she could be of any help.\n\nBrashly, I nodded. \"I'm looking for some old friends of mine,\" I said.\n\"Haven't seen them for years. Named Harrison.\"\n\nShe smiled up at me. \"I don't know of any Harrison around here.\" Her\nvoice had the Ohio twang.\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"Just where do they live?\"\n\nI eyed her carefully, hoping my glance did not look like a wolf eyeing a\nlamb. \"Well, they gave me some crude directions. Said I was to turn at\nthe main highway onto this road and come about twenty miles and stop on\nthe left side when I came upon one of those new road signs where someone\nhad shot one of the spokes out.\"\n\n\"Spokes? Left side--\" She mumbled the words and was apparently mulling\nthe idea around in her mind. She was not more than about seventeen,\nsun-tanned and animal-alive from living in the open. I wondered about\nher. As far as I was concerned, she was part and parcel of this whole\nmysterious affair. No matter what she said or did, it was an obvious\nfact that the hidden road sign directions pointed to this farm. And\nsince no one at seventeen can be kept in complete ignorance of the\nbusiness of the parents, she must be aware of some of the ramifications.\n\nAfter some thought she said, \"No, I don't know of any Harrisons.\"\n\nI grunted. I was really making the least of this, now that I'd arrived.\n\n\"Your folks at home?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\n\"I think I'll drop in and ask them, too.\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Go ahead,\" she said with the noncommittal attitude of\nyouth. \"You didn't happen to notice whether the mailbox flag was up, did\nyou?\"\n\nI hadn't, but I espied back quickly and said, \"No, it isn't.\"\n\n\"Then the mailman hasn't been to deliver,\" she said. \"Mind if I ride\nback to the house with you, mister?\"\n\n\"Hop in.\"\n\nShe smiled brightly and got in quickly. I took off down the road toward\nthe house at an easy pace. She seemed interested in the car, and finally\nsaid, \"I've never been in a car like this before. New?\"\n\n\"Few weeks,\" I responded.\n\n\"Fast?\"\n\n\"If you want to make it go fast. She'll take this rocky road at fifty,\nif anyone wants to be so foolish.\"\n\n\"Let's see.\"\n\nI laughed. \"Nobody but an idiot would tackle a road like this at fifty.\"\n\n\"I like to go fast. My brother takes it at sixty.\"\n\nThat, so far as I was concerned, was youthful exaggeration. I was busy\ntelling her all the perils of fast driving when a rabbit came barrelling\nout of the bushes along one side and streaked across in front of me.\n\nI twitched the wheel. The car went out of the narrow road and up on the\nshoulder, tilting quite a bit. Beyond the rabbit I swung back into the\nroad, but not before the youngster had grabbed my arm to keep from being\ntossed all over the front seat.\n\nHer grip was like a hydraulic vise. My arm went numb and my fingers went\nlimp on the wheel. I struggled with my left hand to spin the wheel to\nkeep on the narrow, winding road and my foot hit the brake to bring the\ncar down, but fast.\n\nTaking a deep breath as we stopped, I shook my right hand by holding it\nin my left at the wrist. I was a mass of tingling pins and needles\nbecause she had grabbed me just above the elbow. It felt as though it\nwould have taken only a trifle more to pinch my arm off and leave me\nwith a bloody stump.\n\n\"Sorry, mister,\" she said breathlessly, her eyes wide open. Her face was\nwhite around the corners of the mouth and at the edges of her nose. The\nwhiteness of the flesh under the deep tan gave her a completely\nfrightened look, far more than the shake-up could have produced.\n\nI reached over and took her hand. \"That's a mighty powerful grip you--\"\n\nThe flesh of her hand was hard and solid. Not the meaty solidity of good\ntone, fine training and excellent health. It was the solidity of a--all\nI could think of at the time was a green cucumber. I squeezed a bit and\nthe flesh gave way only a trifle. I rubbed my thumb over her palm and\nfound it solid-hard instead of soft and yielding.\n\nI wondered.\n\nI had never seen a case of Mekstrom's Disease--before.\n\nI looked down at the hand and said, \"Young lady, do you realize that you\nhave an advanced case of Mekstrom's Disease?\"\n\nShe eyed me coldly. \"Now,\" she said in a hard voice. \"I know you'll come\nin.\"\n\nSomething in my make-up objects violently to being ordered around by a\nslip of a girl. I balance off at about one-sixty. I guessed her at about\ntwo-thirds of that, say one-ten or thereabouts--\n\n\"One-eight,\" she said levelly.\n\n#A telepath!#\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied calmly. \"And I don't mind letting you know it, so\nyou'll not try anything stupid.\"\n\n#I'm getting the heck out of here!#\n\n\"No, you're not. You are coming in with me.\"\n\n\"Like heck!\" I exploded.\n\n\"Don't be silly. You'll come in. Or shall I lay one along your jaw and\ncarry you?\"\n\nI had to try something, anything, to get free. Yet--\n\n\"Now you're being un-bright,\" she told me insolently. \"You should know\nthat you can't plan any surprise move with a telepath. And if you try a\nfrontal attack I'll belt you so cold they'll have to put you in the oven\nfor a week.\"\n\nI just let her ramble for a few seconds because when she was rattling\nthis way she couldn't put her entire mental attention on my thoughts. So\nwhile she was yaking it off, I had an idea that felt as though it might\nwork.\n\nShe shut up like a clam when she realized that her mouthing had given me\na chance to think, and I went into high gear with my perception:\n\n#Not bad--for a kid. Growing up fast. Been playing hookey from momma,\nleaving off your panties like the big girls do. I can tell by the\nelastic cord marks you had 'em on not long ago.#\n\nSeventeeners have a lot more modesty than they like to admit. She was\nstunned by my cold-blooded catalog of her body just long enough for me\nto make a quick lunge across her lap to the door handle on her side.\n\nI flipped it over and gave her a shove at the same time. She went bottom\nover appetite in a sprawl that would have jarred the teeth loose in a\nnormal body and might have cracked a few bones. But she landed on the\nback of her neck, rolled and came to her feet like a cat.\n\nI didn't wait to close the door. I just tromped on the go-pedal and the\ncar leaped forward with a jerk that slammed the door for me. I roared\nforward and left her just as she was making another grab.\n\nHow I hoped to get out of there I did not know. All I wanted was\nmomentary freedom to think. I turned this way and that to follow the\nroad until I came to the house. I left the road, circled the house with\nthe turbine screaming like a banshee and the car taking the corners on\nthe outside wheels. I skidded into a turn like a racing driver and\nironed my wheels out flat on the takeaway, rounded another corner and\nturned back into the road again going the other way.\n\nShe was standing there waiting for me as I pelted past at a good sixty,\nand she reached out one girder-strong arm, latched onto the frame of the\nopen window on my side, and swung onto the half-inch trim along the\nbottom of the car-body like a switchman hooking a freight car.\n\nShe reached for the steering wheel with her free hand.\n\nI knew what was to happen next. She'd casually haul and I'd go off the\nroad into a tree or pile up in a ditch, and while the smoke was clearing\nout of my mind, she'd be untangling me from the wreck and carting me\nover her shoulder, without a scratch to show for her adventure.\n\nI yanked the wheel--whip! whap!--cutting an arc. I slammed past a tree,\nmissing it by half an inch. I wiped her off the side of the car like a\nmailbag is clipped from the fast express by the catch-hook.\n\nI heard a cry of \"Whoof!\" as her body hit the trunk of the tree. But as\nI regained the road and went racing on to safety, I saw in the rear view\nmirror that she had bounced off the tree, sprawled a bit, caught her\nbalance, and was standing in the middle of the road, shaking her small\nbut very dangerous fist at my tail license plate.\n\nI didn't stop driving at one-ten until I was above Dayton again. Then I\npaused along the road to take stock.\n\nStock? What the hell did I know, really?\n\nI'd uncovered and confirmed the fact that there was some secret\norganization that had a program that included their own highway system,\nconcealed within the confines of the United States. I was almost certain\nby this time that they had been the prime movers in the disappearance of\nCatherine and Dr. Thorndyke. They--\n\nI suddenly re-lived the big crack-up.\n\nWillingly now, no longer rejecting the memory, I followed my\nrecollection as Catherine and I went along that highway at a happy pace.\nWith care I recalled every detail of Catherine, watching the road\nthrough my mind and eyes, how she'd mentioned the case of the missing\nspoke, and how I'd projected back to perceive that which I had not been\nconscious of.\n\nReminding myself that it was past, I went through it again,\ndeliberately. The fallen limb that blocked the road, my own horror as\nthe wheels hit it. The struggle to regain control of the careening car.\n\nAs a man watching a motion picture, I watched the sky and the earth turn\nover and over, and I heard my voice mouthing wordless shouts of fear.\nCatherine's cry of pain and fright came, and I listened as my mind\nreconstructed it this time without wincing. Then the final crash, the\nhorrid wave of pain and the sear of the flash-fire. I went through my\nown horror and self condemnation, and my concern over Catherine. I\ndidn't shut if off. I waded through it.\n\nNow I remembered something else.\n\nSomething that any normal, sensible mind would reject as an\nhallucination. Beyond any shadow of a doubt there had been no time for a\nman to rig a block and tackle on a tree above a burning automobile in\ntime to get the trapped victims out alive. And even more certain it was\nthat no normal man of fifty would have had enough strength to lift a car\nby its front bumper while his son made a rush into the flames.\n\nThat tackle had been rigged and burned afterward. But who would reject a\nblock and tackle in favor of an impossibly strong man? No, with the\ntackle in sight, the recollection of a man lifting that overturned\nautomobile like a weight lifter pressing up a bar bell would be buried\nin any mind as a rank hallucination. Then one more item came driving\nhome hard. So hard that I almost jumped when the idea crossed my mind.\n\nBoth Catherine and Dr. Thorndyke had been telepaths.\n\nA telepath close to any member of his underground outfit would divine\ntheir purpose, come to know their organization, and begin to grasp the\nfundamentals of their program. Such a person would be dangerous.\n\nOn the other hand, an esper such as myself could be turned aside with\nbland remarks and a convincing attitude. I knew that I had no way of\ntelling lie from truth and that made my problem a lot more difficult.\n\nFrom the facts that I did have, something smelled of overripe seafood.\nGovernment and charities were pouring scads of dough into a joint called\nthe Medical Research Center. To hear the scholars of medicine tell it,\nMekstrom's Disease was about the last human frailty that hadn't been\nlicked to a standstill. They boasted that if a victim of practically\nanything had enough life left in him to crawl to a telephone and use it,\nhis life could be saved. They grafted well. I'd heard tales of things\nlike fingers, and I know they were experimenting on hands, arms and legs\nwith some success. But when it came to Mekstrom's they were stopped\ncold. Therefore the Medical Research Center received a walloping batch\nof money for that alone; all the money that used to go to the various\nheart, lung, spine and cancer funds. It added up well.\n\nBut the Medical Research Center seemed unaware that some group had\nsolved their basic problem.\n\nFrom the books I've read I am well aware of one of the fundamental\nprinciples of running an underground: _Keep it underground!_ The Commie\nmenace in these United States might have won out in the middle of the\ncentury if they'd been able to stay a secret organization. So the\nHighways in Hiding could stay underground and be an efficient\norganization only until someone smoked them out.\n\nThat one was going to be me.\n\nBut I needed an aide-de-camp. Especially and specifically I needed a\ntrained telepath, one who would listen to my tale and not instantly howl\nfor the nut-hatch attendants. The F.B.I. were all trained investigators\nand they used esper-telepath teams all the time. One dug the joint while\nthe other dug the inhabitant, which covered the situation to a\nfaretheewell.\n\nIt would take time to come up with a possible helper. So I spent the\nnext hour driving toward Chicago, and by the time I'd crossed the\nOhio-Indiana line and hit Richmond, I had a plan laid out. I placed a\ncall to New York and within a few minutes I was talking to Nurse Farrow.\n\nI'll not go into detail because there was a lot of mish-mash that is not\nparticularly interesting and a lot more that covered my tracks since I'd\nparted company with her on the steps of the hospital. I did not, of\ncourse, mention my real purpose over the telephone and Miss Farrow could\nnot read my mind from New York.\n\nThe upshot of the deal was that I felt that I needed a nurse for a\nwhile, not that I was ill, but that I felt a bit woozy now and then\nbecause I hadn't learned to slow down. I worked too fast and too long\nand my condition was not up to it yet. This Miss Farrow allowed as being\nquite possible. I repeated my offer to pay her at the going prices for\nregistered nurses with a one-month guarantee, paid in advance. That\nsoftened her quite a bit. Then I added that I'd videograph her a check\nlarge enough to cover the works plus a round trip ticket. She should\ncome out and have a look, and if she weren't satisfied, she could return\nwithout digging into her own pocket. All she'd lose was one day, and it\nmight be a bit of a vacation if she enjoyed flying in a jetliner at\nsixty thousand feet.\n\nThe accumulation of offers finally sold her and she agreed to\narrange a leave of absence. She'd meet me in the morning of the\nday-after-tomorrow, at Central Airport in Chicago.\n\nI videographed the check and then took off again, confident that I'd be\nable to sell her on the idea of being the telepath half of my amateur\ninvestigation team.\n\nThen because I needed some direct information, I turned West and crossed\nthe line into Indiana, heading toward Marion. So far I had a lot of\nwell-placed suspicions, but until I was certain, I could do no more than\npostulate ideas. I had to know definitely how to identify Mekstrom's\nDisease, or at least the infected flesh. I have a fairly good recall;\nall I needed now was to have someone point to a Case and say flatly that\nthis was a case of Mekstrom's Disease. Then I'd know whether what I'd\nseen in Ohio was actually one hundred percent Mekstrom.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nI walked into the front office with a lot of self-assurance. The Medical\nCenter was a big, rambling place with a lot of spread-out one- and\ntwo-story buildings that looked so much like \"Hospital\" that no one in\nthe world would have mistaken them for anything else. The main building\nwas by the road, the rest spread out behind as far as I could see;\nbeyond my esper range even though the whole business was set in one of\nthe clearest psi areas that I'd even been in.\n\nI was only mildly worried about telepaths. In the first place, the only\nthing I had to hide was my conviction about a secret organization and\nhow part of it functioned. In the second place, the chances were good\nthat few, if any, telepaths were working there, if the case of Dr.\nThorndyke carried any weight. That there were some telepaths, I did not\ndoubt, but these would not be among the high-powered help.\n\nSo I sailed in and faced the receptionist, who was a good-looking\nchemical-type blonde with a pale skin, lovely complexion and figure to\nmatch. She greeted me with a glacial calm and asked my business.\n\nBrazenly I lied. \"I'm a freelance writer and I'm looking for material.\"\n\n\"Have you an assignment?\" she asked without a trace of interest in the\nanswer.\n\n\"Not this time. I'm strictly freelance. I like it better this way\nbecause I can write whatever I like.\"\n\nHer glacial air melted a bit at the inference that my writing had not\nbeen in vain. \"Where have you been published?\" she asked.\n\nI made a fast stab in the dark, aiming in a direction that looked safe.\n\"Last article was one on the latest archeological findings in Assyria.\nGot my source material direct from the Oriental Institute in Chicago.\"\n\n\"Too bad I missed it,\" she said, looking regretful. I had to grin, I'd\ncarefully avoided giving the name of the publication and the supposed\ndate. She went on, \"I suppose you would not be happy with the usual\npress release?\"\n\n\"Handouts contain material, all right, but they're so confounded trite\nand impersonal. People prefer to read anecdotes about the people rather\nthan a listing of facts and figures.\"\n\nShe nodded at that. \"Just a moment,\" she said. Then she addressed her\ntelephone in a voice that I couldn't hear. When she finished, she smiled\nin a warmish-type manner as if to indicate that she'd gone all out in my\nbehalf and that I'd be a heel to forget it. I nodded back and tried to\nmatch the tooth-paste-ad smile. Then the door opened and a man came in\nbriskly.\n\nHe was a tall man, as straight as a ramrod, with a firm jaw and a\nclose-clipped moustache. He had an air like a thin-man's Captain Bligh.\nWhen he spoke, his voice was as clipped and precise as his moustache; in\nfact it was so precise that it seemed almost mechanical.\n\n\"I am Dr. Lyon Sprague,\" he clipped. \"What may I do for you?\"\n\n\"I'm Steve Cornell,\" I said. \"I'm here after source material for a\nmagazine article about Mekstrom's Disease. I'd prefer not to take my\nmaterial from a handout.\"\n\n\"Do you hope to get more?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I usually do. I've seen your handouts; I could get as much by taking\nlast year's medical encyclopedia. Far too dry, too uninteresting, too\nimpersonal.\"\n\n\"Just exactly what do you have in mind?\"\n\nI eyed him with speculation. Here was not a man who would take kindly to\nimaginative conjecture. So Dr. Lyon Sprague was not the man I'd like to\ntalk to. With an inward smile, I said, \"I have a rather new idea about\nMekstrom's that I'd like to discuss with the right party.\"\n\nHe looked down at me, although our eyes were on the same level. \"I doubt\nthat any layman could possibly come up with an idea that has not been\nmost thoroughly discussed here among the research staff.\"\n\n\"In cold words you feel that no untrained lunk has a right to have an\nidea.\"\n\nHe froze. \"I did not say that.\"\n\n\"You implied, at least, that suggestions from outsiders were not\nwelcome. I begin to understand why the Medical Center has failed to get\nanywhere with Mekstrom's in the past twenty years.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he snapped.\n\n\"Merely that it is the duty of all scientists to listen to every\nsuggestion and to discard it only after it has been shown wrong.\"\n\n\"Such as--?\" he said coldly, with a curl of his eyebrows.\n\n\"Well, just for instance, suppose some way were found to keep a victim\nalive during the vital period, so that he would end up a complete\nMekstrom Human.\"\n\n\"The idea is utterly fantastic. We have no time for such idle\nspeculation. There is too much foggy thinking in the world already. Why,\nonly last week we had a Velikovsky Adherent tell us that Mekstrom's had\nbeen predicted in the Bible. There are still people reporting flying\nsaucers, you know. We have no time for foolish notions or utter\nnonsense.\"\n\n\"May I quote you?\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" he snapped stiffly. \"I'm merely pointing out that\nnon-medical persons cannot have the grasp--\"\n\nThe door opened again and a second man entered. The new arrival had\npleasant blue eyes, a van dyke beard, and a good-natured air of\nself-confidence and competence. \"May I cut in?\" he said to Dr. Sprague.\n\n\"Certainly. Mr. Cornell, this is Scholar Phelps, Director of the Center.\nScholar Phelps, this is Mr. Steve Cornell, a gentleman of the press,\" he\nadded in a tone of voice that made the identification a sort of nasty\nname. \"Mr. Cornell has an odd theory about Mekstrom's Disease that he\nintends to publish unless we can convince him that it is not possible.\"\n\n\"Odd theory?\" asked Scholar Phelps with some interest. \"Well, if Mr.\nCornell can come up with something new, I'll be most happy to hear him\nout.\"\n\nDr. Lyon Sprague decamped with alacrity. Scholar Phelps smiled after\nhim, then turned to me and said, \"Dr. Sprague is a diligent worker,\nbusinesslike and well-informed, but he lacks the imagination and the\nsense of humor that makes a man brilliant in research. Unfortunately,\nDr. Sprague cannot abide anything that is not laid out as neat as an\ninterlocking tile floor. Now, Mr. Cornell, how about this theory of\nyours?\"\n\n\"First,\" I replied, \"I'd like to know how come you turn up in the nick\nof time.\"\n\nHe laughed good-naturedly. \"We always send Dr. Sprague out to interview\nvisitors. If the visitor can be turned away easily, all is well and\nquiet. Dr. Sprague can do the job with ease. But if the visitor, like\nyourself, Mr. Cornell, proposes something that distresses the good Dr.\nSprague and will not be loftily dismissed, Dr. Sprague's blood pressure\ngoes up. We all keep a bit of esper on his nervous system and when the\nfuse begins to blow, we come out and effect a double rescue.\"\n\nI laughed with him. Apparently the Medical Center staff enjoyed needling\nDr. Sprague. \"Scholar Phelps, before I get into my theory, I'd like to\nknow more about Mekstrom's Disease. I may not be able to use it in my\narticle, but any background material works well with writers of fact\narticles.\"\n\n\"You're quite right. What would you like to know?\"\n\n\"I've heard, too many times, that no one knows anything at all about\nMekstrom's. This is unbelievable, considering that you folks have been\nworking on it for some twenty years.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"We have some, but it's precious little.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that you could analyze the flesh--\"\n\nHe smiled. \"We have. The state of analytical chemistry is well advanced.\nWe could, I think, take a dry scraping out of the cauldron used by\nMacBeth's witches, and determine whether Shakespeare had reported the\nformula correctly. Now, young man, if you think that something is added\nto the human flesh to make it Mekstrom's Flesh, you are wrong. Standard\nanalysis shows that the flesh is composed of exactly the same chemicals\nthat normal flesh contains, in the same proportion. Nothing is added,\nas, for instance, in the case of calcification.\"\n\n\"Then what is the difference?\"\n\n\"The difference lies in the structure. By X-ray crystallographic method,\nwe have determined that Mekstrom's Flesh is a micro-crystalline\nformation, interlocked tightly.\" Scholar Phelps looked at me\nthoughtfully. \"Do you know much about crystallography?\"\n\nAs a mechanical engineer I did, but as a writer of magazine articles I\nfelt I should profess some ignorance, so I merely said that I knew a\nlittle about the subject.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Cornell, you may know that in the field of solid geometry\nthere are only five possible regular polyhedrons. Like the laws of\ntopology that state that no more than four colors need be used to print\na map on a flat surface, or that no more than seven colors are required\nto print separate patches on a toroid, the laws of solid geometry prove\nthat no more than five regular polyhedrons are possible. Now in\ncrystallography there are only thirty-two possible classes of crystal\nlattice construction. Of these only thirty have ever been discovered in\nnature. Yet we know how the other two would appear if they did emerge in\nnatural formation.\"\n\nI knew it all right but I made scribblings in my notebooks as if the\nidea were of interest. Scholar Phelps waited patiently until I'd made\nthe notation.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Cornell, here comes the shock. Mekstrom's Flesh is one of the\nother two classes.\"\n\nThis was news to me and I blinked.\n\nThen his face faded into a solemn expression. \"Unfortunately,\" he said\nin a low voice, \"knowing how a crystal should form does not help us much\nin forming one to that class. We have no real control over the\narrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice. We can prevent the crystal\nformation, we can control the size of the crystal as it forms. But we\ncannot change the crystal into some other class.\"\n\n\"I suppose it's sort of like baking a cake. Once the ingredients are\nmixed, the cake can be big or small or shaped to fit the pan, or you can\nspoil it complete. But if you mix devil's food, it either comes out\ndevil's food or nothing.\"\n\n\"An amusing analogy and rather correct. However I prefer the one used\nyears ago by Dr. Willy Ley, who observed that analysis is fine, but you\ncan't learn how a locomotive is built by melting it down and analyzing\nthe mess.\"\n\nThen he went on again. \"To get back to Mekstrom's Disease and what we\nknow about it. We know that the crawl goes at about a sixty-fourth of an\ninch per hour. If, for instance, you turned up here with a trace on your\nright middle finger, the entire first joint would be Mekstrom's Flesh in\napproximately three days. Within two weeks your entire middle finger\nwould be solid. Without anesthesia we could take a saw and cut off a bit\nfor our research.\"\n\n\"No feeling?\"\n\n\"None whatever. The joints knit together, the arteries become as hard as\nsteel tubing and the heart cannot function properly--not that the heart\ncares about minor conditions such as the arteries in the extremities,\nbut as the Mekstrom infection crawls up the arm toward the shoulder the\nlarger arteries become solid and then the heart cannot drive the blood\nthrough them in its accustomed fashion. It gets like an advanced case of\narteriosclerosis. Eventually the infection reaches and immobilizes the\nshoulder; this takes about ninety days. By this time, the other\nextremities have also become infected and the crawl is coming up all\nfour limbs.\"\n\nHe looked at me very solemnly at that. \"The rest is not pretty. Death\ncomes shortly after that. I can almost say that he is blessed who\ncatches Mekstrom's in the left hand for them the infection reaches the\nheart before it reaches other parts. Those whose initial infection is in\nthe toes are particularly cursed, because the infection reaches the\nlower parts of the body. I believe you can imagine the result,\nelimination is prevented because of the stoppage of peristalsis. Death\ncomes of autointoxication, which is slow and painful.\"\n\nI shuddered at the idea. The thought of death has always bothered me.\nThe idea of looking at a hand and knowing that I was going to die by the\ncalendar seemed particularly horrible.\n\nTaking the bit between my teeth, I said, \"Scholar Phelps, I've been\nwondering whether you and your Center have ever considered treating\nMekstrom's by helping it?\"\n\n\"Helping it?\" he asked.\n\n\"Sure. Consider what a man might be if he were Mekstrom's all the way\nthrough.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"You would have a physical superman,\" he said. \"Steel-strong\nmuscles driving steel-hard flesh covered by a near impenetrable skin.\nPerhaps such a man would be free of all minor pains and ills. Imagine a\nnormal bacterium trying to bore into flesh as hard as concrete. Mekstrom\nFlesh tends to be acid-resistant as well as tough physically. It is not\nbeyond the imagination to believe that your Mekstrom Superman might live\nthree times our frail four-score and ten. But--\"\n\nHere he paused.\n\n\"Not to pull down your house of cards, this idea is not a new one. Some\nyears ago we invited a brilliant young doctor here to study for his\nscholarate. The unfortunate fellow arrived with the first traces of\nMekstrom's in his right middle toe. We placed about a hundred of our\nmost brilliant researchers under his guidance, and he decided to take\nthis particular angle of study. He failed; for all his efforts, he did\nnot stay his death by a single hour. From that time to the present we\nhave maintained one group on this part of the problem.\"\n\nIt occurred to me at that moment that if I turned up with a trace of\nMekstrom's I'd be seeking out the Highways in Hiding rather than the\nMedical Center. That fast thought brought a second: Suppose that Dr.\nThorndyke learned that he had a trace, or rather, the Highways found it\nout. What better way to augment their medical staff than to approach the\nvictim with a proposition: You help us, work with us, and we will save\nyour life.\n\nThat, of course, led to the next idea: That if the Highways in Hiding\nhad any honest motive, they'd not be hidden in the first place and\nthey'd have taken their cure to the Medical Center in the second. Well,\nI had a bit of something listed against them, so I decided to let my\nbombshell drop.\n\n\"Scholar Phelps,\" I said quietly, \"one of the reasons I am here is that\nI have fairly good evidence that the cure for Mekstrom's Disease does\nexist, and that it produces people of ultrahard bodies and superhuman\nstrength.\"\n\nHe smiled at me with the same tolerant air that father uses on the\noffspring who comes up with one of the standard juvenile plans for\nperpetual motion.\n\n\"What do you consider good evidence?\"\n\n\"Suppose I claimed to have seen it myself.\"\n\n\"Then I would say that you had misinterpreted your evidence,\" he replied\ncalmly. \"The flying saucer enthusiasts still insist that the things they\nsee are piloted by little green men from Venus, even though we have been\nthere and found Venus to be absolutely uninhabited by anything higher\nthan slugs, grubs, and little globby animals like Tellurian leeches.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"This, too, is an old story,\" he told me with a whimsical smile. \"It\ngoes with the standard routine about a secret organization that is\nintending to take over the Earth. The outline has been popular ever\nsince Charles Fort. Now--er--just tell me what you saw.\"\n\nI concocted a tale that was about thirty-three percent true and the rest\npartly distorted. It covered my hitting a girl in Ohio with my car, hard\nenough to clobber her. But when I stopped to help her, she got up and\nran away unhurt. She hadn't left a trace of blood although the front\nfender of the car was badly smashed.\n\nHe nodded solemnly. \"Such things happen,\" he said. \"The human body is\nreally quite durable; now and then comes the lucky happenstance when the\nfearful accident does no more than raise a slight bruise. I've read the\nstory of the man whose parachute did not open and who lived to return it\nto the factory in person, according to the old joke. But now, Mr.\nCornell, have you ever considered the utter impossibility of running any\nsort of secret organization in this world of today. Even before Rhine it\nwas difficult. You'll be adding to your tale next--some sort of secret\nsign, maybe a form of fraternity grip, or perhaps even a world-wide\nsystem of local clubs and hangouts, all aimed at some dire purpose.\"\n\nI squirmed nervously for a bit. Scholar Phelps was too close to the\ntruth to make me like it, because he was scoffing. He went right on\nmaking me nervous.\n\n\"Now before we get too deep, I only want to ask about the probable\nmotives of such an organization. You grant them superhuman strength,\nperhaps extreme longevity. If they wanted to take over the Earth,\ncouldn't they do it by a show of force? Or are they mild-mannered\nsupermen, only quietly interested in overrunning the human race and\nwaiting out the inevitable decline of normal homo sapiens? You're not\nendowing them with extraterrestrial origin, are you?\"\n\nI shook my head unhappily.\n\n\"Good. That shows some logic, Mr. Cornell. After all, we know now that\nwhile we could live on Mars or Venus with a lot of home-sent aid, we'd\nbe most uncomfortable there. We could not live a minute on any planet of\nour solar system without artificial help.\"\n\n\"I might point out that our hypothetical superman might be able to stand\na lot of rough treatment,\" I blurted.\n\n\"Oh, this I'll grant if your tale held any water at all. But let's\nforget this fruitless conjecture and take a look at the utter\nimpossibility of running such an organization. Even planting all of\ntheir secret hangouts in dead areas and never going into urban centers,\nthey'd still find some telepath or esper on their trail. Perhaps a team.\nLet's go back a step and consider, even without psi training, how long\nsuch an outfit could function. It would run until the first specimen had\nan automobile accident on, say Times Square; or until one of them\nwalked--or ran--out of the fire following a jetliner crash.\"\n\nHe then spared me with a cold eye. \"Write it as fiction, Mr. Cornell.\nBut leave my name out of it. I thought you were after facts.\"\n\n\"I am. But the better fact articles always use a bit of speculation to\nliven it up.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he grunted, \"one such fanciful suggestion is the possibility of\nsuch an underground outfit being able to develop a 'cure' while we\ncannot. We, who have had the best of brains and money for twenty years.\"\n\nI nodded, and while I did not agree with Phelps, I knew that to insist\nwas to insult him to his face, and get myself tossed out.\n\n\"You do seem to have quite a set-up here,\" I said, off-hand.\n\nAt this point Phelps offered to show me around the place, and I\naccepted. Medical Center was far larger than I had believed at first; it\nspread beyond my esper range into the hills beyond the main plant. The\nbuildings were arranged in a haphazard-looking pattern out in the back\nsection; I say \"looking\" because only a psi-trained person can dig a\npattern. The wide-open psi area did not extend for miles. Behind the\nmain buildings it closed down into the usual mottled pattern and the\nmedical buildings had been placed in the open areas. Dwellings and\ndormitories were in the dark places. A nice set-up.\n\nI did not meet any of the patients, but Phelps let me stand in the\ncorridor outside a couple of rooms and use my esper on the flesh. It was\nboth distressing and instructive.\n\nHe explained, \"The usual thing after someone visits this way, is that\nthe visitor goes out itching. In medical circles this is a form of what\nwe call 'Sophomore's Syndrome.' Ever heard of it?\"\n\nI nodded. \"That's during the first years at pre-med. Knowing all too\nlittle of medicine, every disease they study produces the same symptoms\nthat the student finds in himself. Until tomorrow, when they study the\nnext. Then the symptoms in the student change.\"\n\n\"Right. So in order to prevent 'Sophomore's Syndrome' among visitors we\nusually let them study the real thing. Also,\" he added seriously, \"we'd\nlike to have as many people as possible recognize the real thing as\nearly as possible. Even though we can't do anything for them at the\npresent time, someday we will.\"\n\nHe stopped before a closed door. \"In here is a girl of eighteen, doomed\nto die in a month.\" His voice trailed off as he tapped on the door of\nthe room.\n\nI froze. A few beads of cold sweat ran down my spine, and I fought\nmyself into a state of nervous calmness. I put the observation away,\nburied it as deep as I could, tried to think around it, and so far as I\nknew, succeeded.\n\nThe tap of Scholar Phelps' finger against the door panel was the\nrap-rap-rap sound characteristic of hard-tanned leather tapping wood.\n\nScholar Phelps was a Mekstrom!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI paid only surface attention to the rest of my visit. I thanked my\npersonal gods that esper training had also given me the ability to\ndissemble. It was impossible to not think of something but it is\npossible to keep the mind so busy with surface thoughts that the\nunderlying idea does not come through the interference.\n\nEventually I managed to leave the Medical Center without exciting\nanyone, and when I left I took off like a skyrocket for Chicago.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nNurse Gloria Farrow waved at me from the ramp of the jetliner, and I ran\nforward to collect her baggage. She eyed me curiously but said no more\nthan the usual greetings and indication of which bag was hers.\n\nI knew that she was reading my mind like a psychologist all the time,\nand I let her know that I wanted her to. I let my mind merely ramble on\nwith the usual pile of irrelevancies that the mind uses to fill in blank\nspaces. It came up with a couple of notions here and there but nothing\ndefinite. Miss Farrow followed me to my car without saying a word, and\nlet me install her luggage in the trunk.\n\nThen, for the first time, she spoke: \"Steve Cornell, you're as healthy\nas I am.\"\n\n\"I admit it.\"\n\n\"Then what is this all about? You don't need a nurse!\"\n\n\"I need a competent witness, Miss Farrow.\"\n\n\"For what?\" She looked puzzled. \"Suppose you stay right here and start\nexplaining.\"\n\n\"You'll listen to the bitter end?\"\n\n\"I've two hours before the next plane goes back. You'll have that time\nto convince me--or else. Okay?\"\n\n\"That's a deal.\" I fumbled around for a beginning, and then I decided to\nstart right at the beginning, whether it sounded cockeyed or not.\n\nGiving information to a telepath is the easiest thing in the world.\nWhile I started at the beginning, I fumbled and finally ended up by\ngoing back and forth in a haphazard manner, but Miss Farrow managed to\ninsert the trivia in the right chronological order so that when I\nfinished, she nodded with interest.\n\nI posed the question: #Am I nuts?#\n\n\"No, Steve,\" she replied solemnly. \"I don't think so. You've managed to\naccept data which is obviously mingled truth and falsehood, and you've\nmanaged to question the validity of all of it.\"\n\nI grunted. \"How about the crazy man who questions his own sanity, using\nthis personal question as proof of his sanity since real nuts _know_\nthey're sane?\"\n\n\"No nut can think that deep into complication. What I mean is that they\ncannot even question their own sanity in the first premise of postulated\nargument. But forget that, what I wanted to know is where you intend to\ngo from here.\"\n\nI shook my head unhappily. \"When I called you I had it all laid out like\na roadmap. I was going to show you proof and use you as an impartial\nobserver to convince someone else. Then we'd go to the Medical Center\nand hand it to them on a platter. Since then I've had a shock that I\ncan't get over, or plan beyond. Scholar Phelps is a Mekstrom. That means\nthat the guy knows what gives with Mekstrom's Disease and yet he is\nrunning an outfit that professes to be helpless in the face of this\ndisease. For all we know Phelps may be the head of the Highways in\nHiding, an organization strictly for profit of some sort at the expense\nof the public welfare.\"\n\n\"You're certain that Phelps is a Mekstrom?\"\n\n\"Not absolutely positive. I had to close my mind because there might be\na telepath on tap. But I can tell you that nobody with normal flesh-type\nfingers ever made that solid rap.\"\n\n\"A fingernail?\"\n\nI shook my head at her. \"That's a click. With an ear at all you'd note\nthe difference.\"\n\n\"I'll accept it for the moment. But lacking your original plan, what are\nyou going to do now?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure beyond showing you the facts. Maybe I should call up that\nF.B.I. team that called on me after Thorndyke's disappearance and put it\nin their laps.\"\n\n\"Good idea. But why would Scholar Phelps be lying? And beyond your basic\nsuspicions, what can you prove?\"\n\n\"Very little. I admit that my evidence is extremely thin. I saw Phillip\nHarrison turning head bolts on a tractor engine with a small end wrench.\nIt should require a crossbar socket and a lot of muscle. Next is the\ngirl in Ohio who should be a bloody mess from the way she was treated.\nInstead she got up and tried to chase me. Then answer me a puzzler: Did\nthe Harrisons move because Marian caught Mekstrom's, or did they move\nbecause they felt that I was too close to discovering their secret? The\nHighway was relocated after that, you'll recall.\"\n\n\"It sounds frightfully complicated, Steve.\"\n\n\"You bet it does,\" I grunted. \"So next I meet a guy who is supposed to\nknow all the answers; a man dedicated to the public welfare, medicine,\nand the ideal of Service. A man sworn to the Hippocratic Oath. Or,\" I\nwent on bitterly, \"is it the Hypocritic Oath?\"\n\n\"Steve, please--\"\n\n\"Please, Hell!\" I stormed. \"Why is he quietly sitting there in Mekstrom\nhide while he is overtly grieving over the painful death of his fellow\nman?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm tired of being pushed around,\" I growled.\n\n\"Pushed around?\" she asked quietly.\n\nWith a trace of scorn, I said, \"Miss Farrow, I can see two possible\nanswers. Either I am being pushed around for some deliberate reason, or\nI'm too smart, too cagey and too dangerous for them to handle directly.\nIt takes only about eight weeks for me to reluctantly abandon the second\nin favor of the first.\"\n\n\"But what makes you think you are being pushed?\" she wanted to know.\n\n\"You can't tell me that I am so important that they couldn't erase me as\neasily as they did Catherine and Dr. Thorndyke. And now that his name\ncomes up, let's ask why any doctor who once met a casual patient would\ngo to the bother of sending a postcard with a message on it that is\ncertain to cause me unhappiness. He's also the guy who nudged me by\ncalling my attention to my so-called 'shock hallucination' about Father\nHarrison lifting my car while Phillip Harrison raced into the fire to\nmake the rescue. Add it up,\" I told her sharply. \"Next he is invited to\nMedical Center to study Mekstrom's. Only instead of landing there, he\nsends me a postcard with one of the Highways in the picture, after which\nhe disappears.\"\n\nMiss Farrow nodded thoughtfully. \"It is all tied up with your Highways\nand your Mekstrom People.\"\n\n\"That isn't all,\" I said. \"How come the Harrisons moved so abruptly?\"\n\n\"You're posing questions that I can't answer,\" complained Miss Farrow.\n\"And I'm not one hundred percent convinced that you are right.\"\n\n\"You are here, and if you take a look at what I'll show you, you'll be\nconvinced. We'll put it this way, to start: Something cockeyed is going\non. Now, one more thing I can add, and this is the part that confuses\nme: Everything that has been done seems to point to me. So far as I can\nsee they are operating just as though they want me to start a big hassle\nthat will end up by getting the Highways out of their Hiding.\"\n\n\"Why on earth would they be doing that?\" she wanted to know.\n\n\"I don't have the foggiest notion. But I do have that feeling and there\nis evidence pointing that way. They've let me in on things that normally\nthey'd be able to conceal from a highly trained telepath. So I intend to\ngo along with them, because somewhere at the bottom of it all we'll find\nthe answer.\"\n\nShe nodded agreement.\n\nNow I started up the car, saying, \"I'm going to find us one of the\nHighways in Hiding, and we'll follow it to one of the way stations. Then\nyou'll see for yourself that there is something definitely fishy going\non.\"\n\n\"This I'd like to see,\" she replied quietly. Almost too quietly. I took\na dig at her as I turned the car out through a tight corner of the lot\nonto the road. She was sitting there with a noncommittal expression on\nher face and I wondered why. She replied to my thought: \"Steve, you must\nface one thing. Anything you firmly believe will necessarily pass across\nyour mind as fact. So forgive me if I hold a few small doubts until I\nhave a chance to survey some of the evidence at first hand.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I told her. \"The first bit won't be hard.\"\n\nI drove eagerly across Illinois into Iowa watching for road signs. I\nknew that once I convinced someone else, it would be easier to convince\na third, and a fourth, and a fiftieth until the entire world was out on\nthe warpath. We drove all day, stopping for chow now and then, behaving\nlike a couple out on a vacation tour. We stopped in a small town along\nabout midnight and found a hotel without having come upon any of the\nhidden highways.\n\nWe met at breakfast, talked our ideas over mildly, and took off again.\nWe crossed into Nebraska about noon and continued to meander until late\nin the afternoon when we came upon our first giveaway road sign.\n\n\"There,\" I told her triumphantly.\n\nShe nodded. \"I see the sign, Steve. That much I knew. Now all you have\nto do is to show me the trial-blazes up in that emblem.\"\n\n\"Unless they've changed their method,\" I told her, \"this one leads West,\nslightly south of.\" I stopped the car not many yards from the sign and\nwent over it with my sense of perception. #You'll note the ease with\nwhich the emblem could be turned upside down,# I interjected. #Note the\nsimilar width of the top and bottom trefoil, so that only a trained and\ninterested observer can tell the difference.#\n\nI drove along until we saw one on the other side of the road and we\nstopped again, giving the sign a thorough going over. #Note that the\nsigns leading away from the direction are upside down,# I went on. I\ndidn't say a word, I was using every ounce of energy in running my\nperception over the sign and commenting on its various odds and ends.\n\n#Now,# I finished, #we'll drive along this Highway in Hiding until we\ncome to some intersection or hideout. Then you'll be convinced.#\n\nShe was silent.\n\nWe took off along that road rather fast and we followed it for miles,\npassing sign after sign with its emblem turned up along the right side\nof the road and turned upside-down when the sign was on the left.\n\nEventually we came to a crossing highway, and at that I pointed\ntriumphantly. \"Note the missing spoke!\" I said with considerable\nenthusiasm. \"Now, Miss Farrow, we shall first turn against it for a few\nmiles and then we shall U-turn and come back along the cross highway\nwith it.\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to be convinced, Steve.\"\n\nWe turned North against the sign and went forty or fifty miles, just to\nbe sure. The signs were all against us. Eventually I turned into a gas\nstation and filled the carte up to the scuppers. As we turned back\nSouth, I asked her, \"Any more comment?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Not yet.\"\n\nI nodded. \"If you want, we'll take a jaunt along our original course.\"\n\n\"By all means.\"\n\n\"In other words you are more than willing to be convinced?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said simply. She went silent then and I wondered what she was\nthinking about, but she didn't bother to tell me.\n\nEventually we came back to the crossroad, and with a feeling of having\nbeen successful, I continued South with a confidence that I had not felt\nbefore. We stopped for dinner in a small town, ate hastily but well, and\nthen had a very mild debate.\n\n\"Shall we have a drink and relax for a moment?\"\n\n\"I'd like it,\" she replied honestly. \"But somehow I doubt that I could\nrelax.\"\n\n\"I know. But it does seem like a good idea to take it easy for a half\nhour. It might even be better if we stopped over and took off again in\nthe morning.\"\n\n\"Steve,\" she told me, \"the only way I could relax or go to sleep would\nbe to take on a roaring load so that I'd pass out cold. I'd rather not\nbecause I'd get up tomorrow with a most colossal hangover. Frankly, I'm\nexcited and I'd prefer to follow this thing to a finish.\"\n\n\"It's a deal,\" I said. \"We'll go until we have to stop.\"\n\nIt was about eight o'clock when we hit the road again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy nine-forty-five we'd covered something better than two hundred miles,\nfollowed another intersection turn according to the missing spoke, and\nwere heading well toward the upper right-hand corner of Colorado on the\nroad map.\n\nAt ten o'clock plus a few minutes we came upon the roadsign that pointed\nthe way to a ranch-type house set prettily on the top of a small knoll\nseveral hundred yards back from the main road. I stopped briefly a few\nhundred feet from the lead-in road and asked Miss Farrow:\n\n\"What's your telepath range? You've never told me.\"\n\nShe replied instantly, \"Intense concentration directed at me is about a\nhalf mile. Superficial thinking that might include me or my personality\nas a by-thought about five hundred yards. To pick up a thought that has\nnothing to do with me or my interests, not much more than a couple of\nhundred feet. Things that are definitely none of my business close down\nto forty or fifty feet.\"\n\nThat was about the average for a person with a bit of psi training\neither in telepathy or in esper; it matched mine fairly well, excepting\nthat part about things that were none of my business. She meant\n_thoughts_ and not _things_. I had always had a hard time\ndifferentiating between things that were none of my damned business,\nalthough I do find it more difficult to dig the contents of a letter\nbetween two unknown parties at a given distance than it is to dig a\nletter written or addressed to a person I know. _Things_ are, by and\nlarge, a lot less personal than thoughts, if I'm saying anything new.\n\n\"Well,\" I told her, \"this is it. We're going to go in close enough for\nyou to take a 'pathic look-around. Keep your mind sensitive. If you dig\nany danger, yell out. I'm going to extend my esper as far as I can and\nif I suddenly take off like a startled spacecraft, it's because I have\nuncovered something disagreeable. But keep your mind on them and not me,\nbecause I'm relying on you to keep posted on their mental angle.\"\n\nMiss Farrow nodded. \"It's hard to remember that other people haven't the\nability to make contact mentally. It's like a normal man talking to a\nblind man and referring constantly to visible things because he doesn't\nunderstand. I'll try to remember.\"\n\n\"I'm going to back in,\" I said. \"Then if trouble turns up, I'll have an\nadvantage. As soon as they feel our minds coming in at them, they'll\nknow that we're not in there for their health. So here we go!\"\n\n\"I'm a good actor,\" she said. \"No matter what I say, I'm with you all\nthe way!\"\n\nI yanked the car forward, and angled back. I hit the road easily and\nstarted backing along the driveway at a rather fast speed with my eyes\nhalf-closed to give my esper sense the full benefit of my concentration\nalong the road. When I was not concentrating on how I was going to turn\nthe wheel at the next curve I thought, #I hope these folks know the best\nway to get to Colorado Springs from here. Dammit, we're lost!#\n\nMiss Farrow squeezed my arm gently, letting me know that she was\nthinking the same general thoughts.\n\nSuddenly she said, \"It's a dead area, Steve.\"\n\nIt was a dead area, all right. My perception came to a barrier that made\nit fade from full perception to not being able to perceive anything in a\nmatter of yards. It always gives me an eerie feeling when I approach a\ndead area and find that I can see a building clearly and not be able to\ncast my perception beyond a few feet.\n\nI kept on backing up into the fringe of that dead area until I was deep\nwithin the edge and it took all my concentration to perceive the road a\nfew feet ahead of my rear wheels so that I could steer. I was inching\nnow, coming back like a blind man feeling his way. We were within about\nforty feet of the ranch house when Miss Farrow yelped:\n\n\"They're surrounding us, Steve!\"\n\nMy hands whipped into action and my heavy right foot came down on the\ngas-pedal. The car shuddered, howled like a wounded banshee, and then\nleaped forward with a roar.\n\nA man sprang out of the bushes and stood in front of the car like a\nstatue with his hand held up. Miss Farrow screamed something\nunintelligible and clutched at my arm frantically. I threw her hand off\nwith a snarl, kept my foot rammed down hard and hit the man dead center.\nThe car bucked and I heard metal crumple angrily. We lurched, bounced\nviciously twice as my wheels passed over his floundering body, and then\nwe were racing like complete idiots along a road that should not have\nbeen covered at more than twenty. The main road came into sight and I\nsliced the car around with a screech of the rear tires, controlled the\ndeliberate skid with some fancy wheel-work and some fast digging of the\nsurrounding dangers.\n\nThen we were tearing along the broad and beautifully clear concrete with\nthe speedometer needle running into the one-fifteen region.\n\n\"Steve,\" said Miss Farrow breathlessly, \"That man you hit--\"\n\nIn a hard voice I said, \"He was getting to his feet when I drove out of\nrange.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said in a whimper. \"I was in his mind. He was not hurt!\nGod! Steve--what are we up against?\" Her voice rose to a wail.\n\n\"I don't know, exactly,\" I said. \"But I know what we're going to do.\"\n\n\"But Steve--what can we do?\"\n\n\"Alone or together, very little. But we can bring one person more out\nalong these Highways and then convince a fourth and a fifth and a\nfiftieth and a thousandth. By then we'll be shoved back off the stage\nwhile the big wheels grind painfully slow but exceedingly meticulous.\"\n\n\"That'll take time.\"\n\n\"Certainly. But we've got a start. Look how long it took getting a start\nin the first place.\"\n\n\"But what is their purpose?\" she asked.\n\n\"That I can't say. I can't say a lot of things, like how, and why and\nwherefore. But I know that now we have a front tooth in this affair\nwe're not going to let go.\" I thought for a moment. \"I could use\nThorndyke; he'd be the next guy to convince if we could find him. Or\nmaybe Catherine, if we could find her. The next best thing is to get\nhold of that F.B.I. Team that called on me. There's a pair of\ncold-blooded characters that seem willing to sift through a million tons\nof ash to find one valuable cinder. They'll listen. I--\"\n\nMiss Farrow looked at her watch; I dug it as she made the gesture.\n#Eleven o'clock.#\n\n\"Going to call?\" she asked.\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"It's too late. It's one in New York now and the F.B.I.\nTeam wouldn't be ready for a fast job at this hour.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"I have no intention of placing a 'When you are ready' call to a number\nidentified with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Not when a full\neight hours must elapse between the call and a reply. Too much can\nhappen to us in the meantime. But if I call in the morning, we can\nprobably take care of ourselves well enough until they arrive if we stay\nin some place that is positively teeming with citizens. Sensible?\"\n\n\"Sounds reasonable, Steve.\"\n\nI let the matter drop at that; I put the go-pedal down to the floor and\nfractured a lot of speed laws until we came to Denver.\n\nWe made Denver just before midnight and drove around until we located a\nhotel that filled our needs. It was large, which would prevent overt\noperations on the part of the 'enemy' and it was a dead area, which\nwould prevent one of them from reading our minds while we slept, and so\nenable them to lay counterplans against us.\n\nThe bellhop gave us a knowing leer as we registered separately, but I\nwas content to let him think what he wanted. Better that he get the\nwrong idea about us than the right one. He fiddled around in Miss\nFarrow's room on the ninth, bucking for a big tip--not for good service,\nbut for leaving us alone, which he did by demonstrating how big a\nnuisance he could be if not properly rewarded. But finally he got tired\nof his drawer-opening and lamp-testing and towel-stacking, and escorted\nme up to the twelfth. I led him out with a five spot clutched in his\nfist and the leer even stronger.\n\nIf he expected me to race downstairs as soon as he was out of ear-shot,\nhe was mistaken, for I hit the sack like the proverbial ton of crushed\nmortar. It had been literally weeks since I'd had a pleasant, restful\nsleep that was not broken by fitful dreams and worry-insomnia. Now that\nwe had something solid to work on, I could look forward to some concrete\naction instead of merely feeling pushed around.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nI'd put in for an eight o'clock call, but my sleep had been so sound and\nperfect that I was all slept out by seven-thirty. I was anxious to get\ngoing so I dressed and shaved in a hurry and cancelled the eight o'clock\ncall. Then I asked the operator to connect me with 913.\n\nA gruff, angry male voice snarled out of the earpiece at me. I began to\napologize profusely but the other guy slammed the phone down on the hook\nhard enough to make my ear ring.\n\nI jiggled my hook angrily and when the operator answered I told her that\nshe'd miscued. She listened to my complaint and then replied in a\npettish tone, \"But I did ring 913, sir. I'll try again.\"\n\nI wanted to tell her to just try, that there was no 'again' about it,\nbut I didn't. I tried to dig through the murk to her switchboard but I\ncouldn't dig a foot through this area. I waited impatiently until she\nre-made the connections at her switchboard and I heard the burring of\nthe phone as the other end rang. Then the same mad-bull-rage voice\ndelivered a number of pointed comments about people who ring up honest\ncitizens in the middle of the night; and he hung up again in the middle\nof my apology. I got irked again and demanded that the operator connect\nme with the registration clerk. To him I told my troubles.\n\n\"One moment, sir,\" he said. A half minute later he returned with,\n\"Sorry, sir. There is no Farrow registered. Could I have mis-heard you?\"\n\n\"No, goddammit,\" I snarled. \"It's Farrow. F as in Frank; A as in Arthur;\nDouble R as in Robert Robert; O as in Oliver; and W as in Washington. I\nsaw her register, I went with her and the bellhop to her room, Number\n913, and saw her installed. Then the same 'hop took me up to my room in\n1224 on the Twelfth.\"\n\nThere was another moment of silence. Then he said, \"You're Mr. Cornell.\nRegistered in Room 1224 last night approximately four minutes after\nmidnight.\"\n\n\"I know all about me. I was there and did it myself. And if I registered\nat four after midnight, Miss Farrow must have registered about two after\nmidnight because the ink was still wet on her card when I wrote my name.\nWe came in together, we were travelling together. Now, what gives?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know, sir. We have no guest named Farrow.\"\n\n\"See here,\" I snapped, \"did you ever have a guest named Farrow?\"\n\n\"Not in the records I have available at this desk. Perhaps in the past\nthere may have been--\"\n\n\"Forget the past. What about the character in 913?\"\n\nThe registration clerk returned and informed me coldly, \"Room 913 has\nbeen occupied by a Mr. Horace Westfield for over three months, Mr.\nCornell. There is no mistake.\" His voice sounded professionally\nsympathetic, and I knew that he would forget my troubles as soon as his\ntelephone was put back on its hook.\n\n\"Forget it,\" I snapped and hung up angrily. Then I went towards the\nelevators, walking in a sort of dream-like daze. There was a cold lump\nof something concrete hard beginning to form in the pit of my stomach.\nWetness ran down my spine and a drop of sweat dropped from my armpit and\nhit my body a few inches above my belt like a pellet of icy hail. My\nface felt cold but when I wiped it with the palm of a shaking hand I\nfound it beaded with an oily sweat. Everything seemed unreally\nhorrifying.\n\n\"Nine,\" I told the elevator operator in a voice that sounded far away\nand hoarse.\n\nI wondered whether this might not be a very vivid dream, and maybe if I\nwent all the way back to my room, took a short nap, and got up to start\nall over again, I would awaken to honest reality.\n\nThe elevator stopped at Nine and I walked the corridor that was familiar\nfrom last night. I rapped on the door of Room 913.\n\nThe door opened and a big stubble-faced gorilla gazed out and snarled at\nme: \"Are you the persistent character?\"\n\n\"Look,\" I said patiently, \"last night a woman friend of mine registered\nat this hotel and I accompanied her to this door. Number 913. Now--\"\n\nA long apelike arm came out and caught me by the coat lapels. He hauled\nand I went in fast. His breath was sour and his eyes were bloodshot and\nhe was angry all the way through. His other hand caught me by the seat\nof the pants and he danced me into the room like a jumping jack.\n\n\"Friend,\" he ground out, \"Take a look. There ain't no woman in this\nroom, see?\"\n\nHe whirled, carrying me off my feet. He took a lunging step forward and\nhurled me onto the bed, where I carried the springs deep down, to bounce\nup and off and forward to come up flat against the far wall. I landed\nsort of spread-eagle flat and seemed to hang there before I slid down\nthe wall to the floor with a meaty-sounding Whump! Then before I could\ncollect my wits or myself, he came over the bed in one long leap and had\nme hauled upright by the coat lapels again. The other hand was cocked\nback level with his shoulder it looked the size of a twenty-five pound\nsack of flour and was probably as hard as set cement.\n\n_Steve_, I told myself, _this time you're in for it!_\n\n\"All right,\" I said as apologetically as I knew how, \"so I've made a bad\nmistake. I apologize. I'll also admit that you could wipe up the hotel\nwith me. But do you have to prove it?\"\n\nMr. Horace Westfield's mental processes were not slow, cumbersome, and\ncrude. He was as fast and hard on his mental feet as he was on his\nphysical feet. He made some remarks about my intelligence, my\nupbringing, my parentage and its legal status, and my unwillingness to\nface a superior enemy. During this catalog of my virtueless existence,\nhe gandy-walked me to the door and opened it. He concluded his lecture\nby suggesting that in the future I accept anything that any registration\nclerk said as God-Stated Truth, and if I then held any doubts I should\ntake them to the police. Then he hurled me out of the room by just sort\nof shoving me away. I sailed across the hall on my toes, backward, and\nslapped my frame flat again, and once more I hung against the wall until\nthe kinetic energy had spent itself. Then I landed on wobbly ankles as\nthe door to Room 913 came closed with a violent slam.\n\nI cursed the habit of building hotels in dead areas, although I admitted\nthat I'd steer clear of any hotel in a clear area myself. But I didn't\nneed a clear area nor a sense of perception to inform me that Room 913\nwas absolutely and totally devoid of any remote sign of female\nhabitation. In fact, I gathered the impression that for all of his brute\nstrength and virile masculinity, Mr. Horace Westfield hadn't entertained\na woman in that room since he'd been there.\n\nThere was one other certainty: It was impossible for any agency short of\nsheer fairyland magic to have produced overnight a room that displayed\nits long-term occupancy by a not-too-immaculate character. That\ndistinctive sour smell takes a long time to permeate the furnishings of\nany decent hotel; I wondered why a joint as well kept as this one would\nput up with a bird as careless of his person as Mr. Horace Westfield.\n\nSo I came to the reluctant conclusion that Room 913 was not occupied by\nNurse Farrow, but I was not yet convinced that she was totally missing\nfrom the premises.\n\nInstead of taking the elevator, I took to the stairs and tried the\neighth. My perception was not too good for much in this murk, but I was\nmentally sensitive to Nurse Farrow and if I could get close enough to\nher, I might be able to perceive some trace of her even through the\ndeadness. I put my forehead against the door of Room 813 and drew a\nblank. I could dig no farther than the inside of the door. If Farrow\nwere in 813, I couldn't dig a trace of her. So I went to 713 and tried\nthere.\n\nI was determined to try every -13th room on every floor, but as I was\nstanding with my forehead against the door to Room 413, someone came up\nbehind me quietly and asked in a rough voice: \"Just what do you think\nyou're doing, Mister?\"\n\nHis dress indicated housedick, but of course I couldn't dig the license\nin his wallet any more than he could read my mental, #None of your\nbusiness, flatfoot!# I said, \"I'm looking for a friend.\"\n\n\"You'd better come with me,\" he said flatly. \"There's been complaints.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" I growled. \"Maybe I made one of them myself.\"\n\n\"Want to start something?\" he snapped.\n\nI shrugged and he smiled. It was a stony smile, humorless as a crevasse\nin a rock-face. He kept that professional-type smile on his face until\nwe reached the manager's office. The manager was out, but one of the\nassistant managers was in his desk. The little sign on the desk said\n\"Henry Walton. Assistant Manager.\"\n\nMr. Walton said, coldly, \"What seems to be the trouble, Mr. Cornell?\"\n\nI decided to play it just as though I were back at the beginning again.\n\"Last night,\" I explained very carefully, \"I checked into this hotel. I\nwas accompanied by a woman companion. A registered nurse. Miss Gloria\nFarrow. She registered first, and we were taken by one of your bellboys\nto Rooms 913 and 1224 respectively. I went with Miss Farrow to 913 and\nsaw her enter. Then the bellhop escorted me to 1224 and left me for the\nnight. This morning I can find no trace of Miss Farrow anywhere in this\nfleabag.\"\n\nHe bristled at the derogatory title but he covered it quickly. \"Please\nbe assured that no one connected with this hotel has any intention of\nconfusing you, Mr. Cornell.\"\n\n\"I'm tired of playing games,\" I snapped. \"I'll accept your statement so\nfar as the management goes, but someone is guilty of fouling up your\nregistration lists.\"\n\n\"That's rather harsh,\" he replied coldly. \"Falsifying or tampering with\nhotel registration lists is illegal. What you've just said amounts to\nlibel or slander, you know.\"\n\n\"Not if it's true.\"\n\nI half expected Henry Walton to backwater fast, but instead, he merely\neyed me with the same expression of distaste that he might have used\nupon finding half of a fuzzy caterpillar in his green salad. As cold as\na cake of carbon dioxide snow, he said, \"Can you prove this, Mr.\nCornell?\"\n\n\"Your night crew--\"\n\n\"You've given us a bit of trouble this morning,\" he informed me. \"So\nI've taken the liberty of calling in the night crew for you.\" He pressed\na button and a bunch came in and lined up as if for formal inspection.\n\"Boys,\" said Walton quietly, \"suppose you tell us what you know about\nMr. Cornell's arrival here last night.\"\n\nThey nodded their heads in unison.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" I snapped. \"I want a reliable witness to listen to\nthis. In fact, if I could, I'd like to have their stories made under\noath.\"\n\n\"You'd like to register a formal charge? Perhaps of kidnapping, or maybe\nillegal restraint?\"\n\n\"Just get me an impartial witness,\" I told him sourly.\n\n\"Very well.\" He picked up his telephone and spoke into it. We waited a\nfew minutes, and finally a very prim young woman came in. She was\nfollowed by a uniformed policeman. She was carrying one of those\nsub-miniature silent typewriters which she set up on its little stand\nwith a few efficient motions.\n\n\"Miss Mason is our certified public stenographer,\" he said. \"Officer,\nI'll want your signature on her copy when we're finished. This is a\nsimple routine matter, but it must be legal to the satisfaction of Mr.\nCornell. Now, boys, go ahead and explain. Give your name and position\nfirst for Miss Mason's record.\"\n\nIt was then that I noticed that the night crew had arranged themselves\nin chronological order. The elderly gent spoke first. He'd been the\nnight doorman but now he was stripped of his admiral's gold braid and he\nlooked just like any other sleepy man of middle age.\n\n\"George Comstock,\" he announced. \"Doorman. As soon as I saw the car\nangling out of traffic, I pressed the call-button for a bell boy. Peter\nWright came out and was standing in readiness by the time Mr. Cornell's\ncar came to a stop by the curb. Johnny Olson was out next, and after\nPeter had taken Mr. Cornell's bag, Johnny got into Mr. Cornell's car and\ntook off for the hotel garage--\"\n\nWalton interrupted. \"Let each man tell what he did himself. No\nprompting, please.\"\n\n\"Well, then, you've heard my part in it. Johnny Olson took off in Mr.\nCornell's car and Peter Wright took off with Mr. Cornell's bag, and Mr.\nCornell followed Peter.\"\n\nThe next man in line, at a nod from the assistant manager, stepped\nforward about a half a pace and said, \"I'm Johnny Olson. I followed\nPeter Wright out of the door and after Peter had collected Mr. Cornell's\nbag, I got in Mr. Cornell's car and took it to the hotel garage.\"\n\nThe third was Peter Wright, the bellhop. \"I carried his bag to the desk\nand waited until he registered. Then we went up to Room 1224. I opened\nthe door, lit the lights, opened the window, and stuff. Mr. Cornell\ntipped me five bucks and I left him there. Alone.\"\n\n\"I'm Thomas Boothe, the elevator operator. I took Mr. Cornell and Peter\nWright to the Twelfth. Peter said I should wait because he wouldn't be\nlong, and so I waited on the Twelfth until Peter got back. That's all.\"\n\n\"I'm Doris Caspary, the night telephone operator. Mr. Cornell called me\nabout fifteen minutes after twelve and asked me to put him down for a\ncall at eight o'clock this morning. Then he called at about seven thirty\nand said that he was already awake and not to bother.\"\n\nHenry Walton said, \"That's about it, Mr. Cornell.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\nThe policeman looked puzzled. \"What is the meaning of all this? If I'm\nto witness any statements like these, I'll have to know what for.\"\n\nWalton looked at me. I couldn't afford not to answer. Wearily I said,\n\"Last night I came in here with a woman companion and we registered in\nseparate rooms. She went into 913 and I waited until she was installed\nand then went to my own room on the Twelfth. This morning there is no\ntrace of her.\"\n\nI went on to tell him a few more details, but the more I told him the\nmore he lifted his eyebrows.\n\n\"Done any drinking?\" he asked me curtly.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Certain?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\nWalton looked at his crew. They burst into a chorus of, \"Well, he _was_\nsteady on his feet,\" and \"He didn't _seem_ under the influence,\" and a\nlot of other statements, all generally indicating that for all they knew\nI could have been gassed to the ears, but one of those rare guys who\ndon't show it.\n\nThe policeman smiled thinly. \"Just why was this registered nurse\ntravelling with you?\"\n\nI gave them the excuse-type statement; the one about the accident and\nthat I felt that I was still a bit on the rocky side and so forth. About\nall I did for that was to convince the policeman that I was not a stable\ncharacter. His attitude seemed to indicate that any man travelling with\na nurse must either be physically sick or maybe mentally out of tune.\n\nThen with a sudden thought, I whirled on Johnny Olson. \"Will you get my\ncar?\" I asked him. He nodded after a nod from Walton. I said, \"There's\nplenty of evidence in my car. In the meantime, let's face one thing,\nofficer. I've been accused of spinning a yarn. I'd hardly be demanding\nwitnesses if I weren't telling the truth. I was standing beside Miss\nFarrow when she signed the register, complete with the R.N. title. It's\ntoo bad that hotels have taken to using card files instead of the old\nregistration book. Cards are so easy to misplace--\"\n\nWalton cut in angrily. \"If that's an accusation, I'm inclined to see\nthat you make it in a court of law.\"\n\nThe policeman looked calm. \"I'd take it easy, Mr. Cornell. Your story is\nnot corroborated. But the employees of the hotel bear one another out.\nAnd from the record, it would appear that you were under the eyes of at\nleast two of them from the moment your car slowed down in front of the\nmain entrance up to the time that you were escorted to your room.\"\n\n\"I object to being accused of complicity in a kidnapping,\" put in the\nassistant manager.\n\n\"I object to being accused of mental incompetence,\" I snapped. \"Why do\nwe stand around accusing people back and forth when there's evidence if\nyou'll only uncover it.\"\n\nWe stood there glaring at one another. The air grew tense. The only ones\nin the place who did not have chips on their shoulders were the\npoliceman and the certified stenographer, who was clicking her silent\nkeys in lightning manner, taking down every comment as it was uttered.\n\nEventually Olson returned, to put an end to the thick silence. \"Y'car's\noutside,\" he told me angrily.\n\n\"Fine,\" I said. \"Now we'll go outside and take a look. You'll find\nplenty of traces of Miss Farrow's having been there. Officer--are you\ntelepath or perceptive?\"\n\n\"Perceptive,\" he said. \"But not in here.\"\n\n\"How far out does this damned dead area extend?\" I asked Walton.\n\n\"About half way across the sidewalk.\"\n\n\"Okay. So let's all go.\"\n\nWe traipsed out to the curb. Miss Mason brought her little silent along,\nslipping the stand high up so that she could type from an erect\nposition. We lined up along the curb and I looked into my car with a\ntriumphant feeling.\n\nAnd then that cold chill congealed my spine again. My car was clean and\nshining. It had been washed and buffed and polished until it looked as\nnew as the day I picked it out on the salesroom floor.\n\nWalton looked blank, and I whipped a thought at him: #Damned telepath!#\n\nHe nodded perceptibly and said smoothly, \"I'm rather sorry we couldn't\nfind any fingerprints. Because now, you see,\" and here he turned to the\npoliceman and went on, \"Mr. Cornell will now accuse us of having washed\nhis car to destroy the evidence. However, you'll find that as a general\npolicy of the hotel, the car-washing is performed as a standard service.\nIn fact, if any guest parks his car in our garage and his car is not\nrendered spick and span, someone is going to get fired for negligence.\"\n\nSo that was that. I took a fast look around, because I knew that I had\nto get out of there fast. If I remained to carry on any more argument,\nI'd be tapped for being a nuisance and jugged.\n\nI had no doubt at all that the whole hotel staff were all involved in\nNurse Farrow's disappearance. But they'd done their job in such a way\nthat if the question were pushed hard, I would end up answering formal\ncharges, the topmost of which might be murder and concealment of the\nbody.\n\nI could do nothing by sitting in jail. This was the time to get out\nfirst and worry about Farrow later.\n\nSo I opened the car door and slipped in. I fiddled with the so-called\nglove compartment and opened it; the maps were all neatly stacked and\nall the flub had been cleaned out. I fumbled inside and dropped a couple\nof road maps to the floor, and while I was down picking them up I turned\nthe ignition key which Olson had left plugged in the lock.\n\nI took off with a jerk and howl of tires.\n\nThere was the sudden shrill of a police whistle but it was stopped after\none brief blast. As I turned the corner, I caught a fast backwards dig\nat them. They were filing back into the hotel. I did not believe that\nthe policeman was part of the conspiracy, but I was willing to bet that\nWalton was going to slip the policeman a box of fine cigars as a reward\nfor having helped them to get rid of a very embarrassing screwball.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nI put a lot of miles between me and my recent adventure before I stopped\nto take stock. The answer to the mess was still obscure, but the\nelimination of Nurse Farrow fell into the pattern very neatly.\n\nAlone, I was no problem. So long as my actions were restricted to\nmeandering up and down the highways and byways, peering into nooks and\ncrannies and crying, \"Catherine,\" in a plaintive voice, no one cared.\nBut when I teamed up with a telepath, they moved in with the efficiency\nof a well-run machine and extracted the disturbing element. In fact,\ntheir machinations had been so smooth that I was beginning to believe\nthat my 'Discoveries' were really an assortment of unimportant facts\nshown to me deliberately for some reason of their own.\n\nThe only snag in the latter theory was the fact of our accident.\nAssuming that I had to get involved in the mess, there were easier ways\nto introduce me than by planning a bad crack-up that could have been\nfatal, even granting the close proximity of the Harrison tribe to come\nto the rescue. The accident had to be an accident in the dictionary\ndefinition of the word itself. Under the circumstances, a planned\naccident could only be accepted under an entirely different set of\nconditions. For instance, let's assume that Catherine was a Mekstrom and\nI was about to disclose the fact. Then she or they could plan such an\naccident, knowing that she could walk out of the wreck with her hair\nbarely mussed, leaving me dead for sure.\n\nBut Catherine was not a Mekstrom. I'd been close enough to that satin\nskin to know that the body beneath it was soft and yielding.\n\nYet the facts as they stood did not throw out my theory. It merely had\nto be revised. Catherine was no Mekstrom, but if the Harrisons had\ndetected the faintest traces of an incipient Mekstrom infection, they\ncould very well have taken her in. I fumed at the idea. I could almost\nvisualize them pointing out her infection and then informing her bluntly\nthat she could either swear in with them and be cured or she could die\nalone and miserably.\n\nThis could easily explain her disappearance. Naturally, being what they\nwere, they cared nothing for me or any other non-Mekstrom. I was no\nmenace. Not until I teamed up with a telepath, and they knew what to do\nabout that.\n\nCompletely angry, I decided that it was time that I made a noise like an\nerupting volcano. With plans forming, I took off again towards\nYellowstone, pausing only long enough at Fort Collins to buy some\narmament.\n\nColorado is still a part of the United States where a man can go into a\nstore and buy a gun over the counter just like any other tool. I picked\nout a Bonanza .375 because it is small enough to fit the hip pocket,\nlight because of the new alloys so it wouldn't unballast me, and mostly\nbecause it packs enough wallop to stop a charging hippo. I did not know\nwhether it would drill all the way through a Mekstrom hide, but the\nimpact would at least set any target back on the seat of his pants.\n\nThen I drove into Wyoming and made my way to Yellowstone, and one day I\nwas driving along the same road that had been pictured in Dr.\nThorndyke's postcard. I drove along it boldly, loaded for bear, and\nwatching the Highway signs that led me nicely toward my goal.\n\nEventually I came to the inevitable missing spoke. It pointed to a\nranch-type establishment that lay sprawled out in a billow of dead area.\nI eyed it warily and kept on driving because my plans did not include\nmarching up to the front door like a rug peddler.\n\nInstead, I went on to the next town, some twenty miles away, which I\nreached about dark. I stopped for a leisurely dinner, saw a moving\npicture at the drive-in, killed a few at the bar, and started back to\nthe way station about midnight.\n\nThe name, dug from the mailbox, was Macklin.\n\nAgain I did not turn in. I parked the car down the highway by about\nthree miles, figuring that only a psi of doctor's degree would be able\nto dig anything at that distance. I counted on there being no such\nmental giant in this out of the way place.\n\nI made my way back toward the ranch house across the fields and among\nthe rolling rock. I extended my perception as far as I could; I made\nmyself sensitive to danger and covered the ground foot by foot, digging\nfor traps, alarm lines, photocell trips, and parties who might be lying\nin wait for me.\n\nI encountered no sign of any trip or trap all the way to the fringe of\nthe dead zone.\n\nThe possibility that they knew of my presence and were comfortably\nawaiting me deep within the zone occurred to me, and so I was very\ncautious as I cased the layout and decided to make my entry at the point\nwhere the irregular boundary of the dead area was closest to the house\nitself.\n\nI entered and became completely psi-blind. Starlight cast just enough\nlight so that I could see to walk without falling into a chuck hole or\nstumbling over something, but beyond a few yards everything lost shape\nand became a murky blob. The night was dead silent except for an\noccasional hiss of wind through the brush.\n\nEsperwise I was not covering much more than my eyes could see. I stepped\ndeeper into the zone and lost another yard of perception. I kept probing\nat the murk, sort of like poking a finger at a hanging blanket. It moved\nif I dug hard enough in any direction, but as soon as I released the\npressure, the murk moved right back where it was before.\n\nI crouched and took a few more steps into the zone, got to a place where\nI could begin to see the outlines of the house itself.\n\nDark, silent, it looked uninhabited. I wished that there had been a\ncollege course in housebreaking, prowling and second-story operations. I\nwent at it very slowly. I took my sweet time crossing the boards of the\nback verandah, even though the short hair on the back of my neck was\nbeginning to prickle from nervousness. I was also scared. At any given\nmoment, they had the legal right to open a window, poke out a\nfield-piece, and blow me into bloody ribbons where I stood.\n\nThe zone was really a dead one. My esper range was no more than about\nsix inches from my forehead; a motion picture of Steve Cornell sounding\nout the border of a window with his forehead would have looked funny, it\nwas not funny at the time. But I found that the sash was not locked and\nthat the flyscreen could be unshipped from the outside.\n\nI entered a dining room. Inside, it was blacker than pitch.\n\nI crossed the dining room by sheer feel and instinct and managed to get\nto the hallway without making any racket. At this point I stopped and\nasked myself what the heck I thought I was trying to do. I had to admit\nthat I had no plan in definite form. I was just prowling the joint to\nsee what information I might be able to pick up.\n\nDown the hall I found a library. I'd been told that you tell what kind\nof people folks are by inspecting their library, and so I conned the\nbook titles by running my head along a row of books.\n\nThe books in the library indicated to me that this was a family of some\nsize with rather broad tastes. There was everything from science fiction\nto Shakespeare, everything from philosophy to adventure. A short row of\nkid's books. A bible. Encyclopedia Brittanica (Published in Chicago), in\nfifty-four volumes, but there were no places that were worn that might\ngive me an idea as to any special interest.\n\nThe living room was also blank of any evidence of anything out or the\nordinary. I turned away and stood in the hallway, blocked by indecision.\nI was a fool, I kept telling myself, because I did not have any\nexperience in casing a joint, and what I knew had been studied out of\nold-time detective tales. Even if the inhabitants of the place were to\nlet me go at it in broad daylight, I'm not too sure that I'd do a good\njob of finding something of interest except for sheer luck.\n\nBut on the other hand, I'd gotten nowhere by dodging and ducking. I was\nin no mood to run quivering in fear. I was more inclined to emit a\nbellow just to see what would happen next.\n\nSo instead of sneaking quietly away, I found the stairs and started to\ngo up very slowly.\n\nIt occurred to me at about the third step that I must be right. Anybody\nwith any sense wouldn't keep anything dangerous in their downstairs\nlibrary. It would be too much like a safe-cracker storing his nitro in\nthe liquor cabinet or the murderer who hangs his weapon over the\nmantelpiece.\n\nYet everybody kept some sort of records, or had things in their homes\nthat were not shown to visiting firemen. And if it weren't on the second\nfloor, then it might be in the cellar. If I weren't caught first, I'd\nprowl the whole damned place, inch by inch--avoiding if possible those\nrooms in which people slept.\n\nThe fifth step squeaked ever so faintly, but it sounded like someone\npulling a spike out of a packing case made of green wood. I froze, half\naching for some perceptive range so that I could dig any sign of danger,\nand half remembering that if it weren't for the dead area, I'd not be\nthis far. I'd have been frightened to try it in a clear zone.\n\nEventually I went on up, and as my head came above the level of the\nfloor, everything became psi-clear once more.\n\nHere was as neat a bit of home planning as I have ever seen. Just below\nthe level of the second floor, their dead area faded out, so that the\ntop floor was clean, bright, and clear as day. I paused, startled at it,\nand spent a few moments digging outside. The dead area billowed above\nthe rooftop out of my range; from what little I could survey of the dark\npsi area, it must have been shaped sort of like an angel-food cake,\nexcept that the central hole did not go all the way down. Only to the\nfirst-floor level. It was a wonderful set-up for a home; privacy was\ngranted on the first floor and from the road and all the surrounding\nterritory, but on the second floor there was plenty of pleasant\nesperclear space for the close-knit family and friends. Their dead area\nwas shaped in the ideal form for any ideal home.\n\nThen I stopped complimenting the architect and went on about my\nbusiness, because there, directly in front of my nose, I could dig the\nfamiliar impression of a medical office.\n\nI went the rest of the way up the stairs and into the medical office.\nThere was no mistake. The usual cabinets full of instruments, a\nlaboratory examination table, shelves of little bottles, and along one\nwall was a library of medical books. All it needed was a sign on the\ndoor: 'S. P. Macklin, MSch' to make it standard.\n\nAt the end of the library was a set of looseleaf notebooks, and I pulled\nthe more recent of them out and held it up to my face. I did not dare\nsnap on a light, so I had to go it esper.\n\nEven in the clear area, this told me very little. Esper is not like\neyesight, any more than you can hear printed words or perhaps carry on a\nconversation by watching the wiggly green line on an oscilloscope. I\nwished it was. Instead, esper gives you a grasp of materials and shapes\nand things in position with regard to other things. It is sort of like\nseeing something simultaneously from all sides, if you can imagine such\na sensation. So instead of being able to esper-read the journal, I had\nto take it letter by letter by digging the shape of the ink on the page\nwith respect to the paper and the other letters, and since the guy's\nhandwriting was atrocious, I could get no more than if the thing were\nwritten in Latin. If it had been typewritten, or with a stylized hand,\nit would have been far less difficult; or if it had been any of my\ndamned business I could have dug it easily. But as it was----\n\n\"Looking for something, Mr. Cornell?\" asked a cool voice that dripped\nwith acid sarcasm. At the same instant, the lights went on.\n\nI whirled, clutched at my hip pocket, and dropped to my knees at the\nsame time. The sights of my .375 centered in the middle of a\nsilk-covered midriff.\n\nShe stood there indolently, disdainful of the cannon that was aimed at\nher. She was not armed; I'd have caught the esper warning of danger if\nshe'd come at me with a weapon of some sort, even though I was\npreoccupied with the bookful of evidence.\n\nI stood up and faced her and let my esper run lightly over her body. She\nwas another Mekstrom, which did not surprise me a bit.\n\n\"I seem to have found what I was looking for,\" I said.\n\nHer laugh was scornful but not loud. \"You're welcome, Mr. Cornell.\"\n\n#Telepath?#\n\n\"Yes, and a good one.\"\n\n#Who else is awake?#\n\n\"Just me, so far,\" she replied quietly. \"But I'll be glad to call out--\"\n\n#Keep it quiet, Sister Macklin.#\n\n\"Stop thinking like an idiot, Mr. Cornell. Quiet or not, you'll not\nleave this house until I permit you to go.\"\n\nI let my esper roam quickly through the house. An elderly couple slept\nin the front bedroom. A man slept alone in the room beside them; a pair\nof young boys slept in an over-and-under bunk in the room across the\nhall. The next room must have been hers, the bed was tumbled but empty.\nThe room next to the medical office contained a man trussed in traction\nsplints, white bandages, and literally festooned with those little\nhanging bottles that contain everything from blood plasma to food and\nwater, right on down to lubrication for the joints. I tried to dig his\nface under the swath of bandage but I couldn't make out much more than\nthe fact that it was a face and that the face was half Mekstrom Flesh.\n\n\"He is a Mekstrom Patient,\" said Miss Macklin quietly. \"At this stage,\nhe is unconscious.\"\n\nI sort of sneered at her. \"Good friend of yours, no doubt.\"\n\n\"Not particularly,\" she said. \"Let's say that he is a poor victim that\nwould die if we hadn't found his infection early.\" The tone and\nexpression of her voice made me seethe; she sounded as though she felt\nherself to be a real benefactor to the human race, and that she and her\noutfit would do the same for any other poor guy that caught\nMekstrom's--providing they learned about this unfortunate occurrence in\ntime.\n\n\"We would, Mr. Cornell.\"\n\n\"Bah-loney,\" I grunted.\n\n\"Why dispute my word?\" she asked in the same tone of innocent honesty.\n\nI eyed her angrily and I felt my hand tighten on the revolver. \"I've a\nreason to become suspicious,\" I told her in a voice that I hoped was as\nmild-mannered as her own. \"Because three people have disappeared in the\npast half-year without a trace, but under circumstances that put me in\nthe middle. All of them, somehow, seem to be involved with your hidden\nroad sign system and Mekstrom's Disease.\"\n\n\"That's unfortunate,\" she said quietly.\n\nI had to grab myself to keep from yelling, \"Unfortunate?\" and managed to\nmuffle it down to a mere voice-volume sound. \"People dying of Mekstrom's\nbecause you're keeping this cure a secret and I'm batted from pillar to\npost because--\" I gave up on that because I really did not know why.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that you had to become involved,\" she said firmly.\n\"Because you--\"\n\n\"It's unfortunate for everybody,\" I snapped, \"because I'm going to bust\nyou all wide open!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not. You see, in order to do that you'll have to get out of\nhere and that I will not permit.\"\n\nI grunted. \"Miss Macklin, you Mekstroms have hard bodies, but do you\nthink your hide will stop a slug from this?\"\n\n\"You'll never know. You see, Mr. Cornell, you do not have the cold,\nbrittle, determined guts that you'd need to pull that trigger.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"Pull it,\" she said. \"Or do you agree, now that you're of age, that you\ncan't bluff a telepath.\"\n\nI eyed her sourly because she was right. She held that strength that\nlies in weakness; I could not pull that trigger and fire a .375 inch\nslug into that slender, silk-covered midriff. And opposite that, Miss\nMacklin also had a strength that was strength itself. She could hold me\naloft with one hand kicking and squirming while she was twisting my arms\nand legs off with her other hand.\n\nShe held all the big cards of her sex, too. I couldn't slug her with my\nfist, even though I knew that I'd only break my hand without even\nbruising her. I was in an awkward situation and I knew it. If she'd been\na normal woman I could have shrugged my way past her and left, but she\nwas determined not to let me leave without a lot of physical violence.\nViolence committed on a woman gets the man in dutch no matter how\njustified he is.\n\nYet in my own weakness there was a strength; there was another way out\nand I took it. Abruptly and without forethought.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nShifting my aim slightly, I pulled the trigger. The .375 Bonanza went\noff with a sound like an atom bomb in a telephone booth, and the slug\nwhiffed between her arm and her body and drilled a crater in the plaster\nbehind her.\n\nThe roar stunned her stiff. The color drained from her face and she\nswayed uncertainly. I found time enough to observe that while her body\nwas as hard as chromium, her nervous system was still human and\nsensitive enough to make her faint from a sudden shock. She caught\nherself, and stood there stiff and white with one delicate (but\nsteel-hard) hand up against her throat.\n\nThen I dug the household. They were piling out of the hay like a bunch\nof trained firemen answering a still alarm. They arrived in all stages\nof nightdress in the following order:\n\nThe man, about twenty-two or three, who skidded into the room on dead\ngallop and put on brakes with a screech as he caught sight of the .375\nwith its thin wisp of blue vapor still trailing out of the muzzle.\n\nThe twins, aged about fourteen, who might have turned to run if they'd\nnot been frightened stiff at the sight of the cannon in my fist.\n\nFather and then Mother Macklin, who came in briskly but without panic.\n\nMr. Macklin said, crisply, \"May I have an explanation, Mr. Cornell?\"\n\n\"I'm a cornered rat,\" I said thickly. \"And so I'm scared. I want out of\nhere in one piece. I'm so scared that if I'm intercepted, I may get\npanicky, and if I do someone is likely to get hurt. Understand?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said Mr. Macklin calmly.\n\n\"Are you going to let him get away with this?\" snapped the eldest son.\n\n\"Fred, a nervous man with a revolver is very dangerous. Especially one\nwho lacks the rudimentary training in the simpler forms of burglary.\"\n\nI couldn't help but admire the older gentleman's bland self-confidence.\n\"Young man,\" he said to me, \"You've made a bad mistake.\"\n\n\"No I haven't,\" I snapped. \"I've been on the trail of something concrete\nfor a long time, and now that I've found it I'm not going to let it go\neasily.\" I waved the .375 and they all cringed but Mr. Macklin.\n\nHe said, \"Please put that weapon down, Mr. Cornell. Let's not add\nattempted murder to your other crimes.\"\n\n\"Don't force me to it, then. Get out of my way and let me go.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"I don't have to be telepath to tell you that you won't pull\nthat trigger until you're sorely driven,\" he replied calmly. He was so\nright that it made me mad. He added, \"also, you've got four shells left\nsince you carry the firearm on an empty chamber. Not used to guns, are\nyou, Mr. Cornell?\"\n\nWell, I wasn't used to wearing a gun. Now that he mentioned it, I\nremembered that it was impossible to fire the shell under the hammer by\nany means except by pulling the trigger.\n\nWhat he was telling me meant that even if I made a careful but bloody\nsweep of it with my four shells, there would be two of them left, and\neven the twins were more than capable of taking me apart inch by inch\nonce my revolver was empty.\n\n\"Seems to be an impasse, Mr. Cornell,\" he said with an amused smile.\n\n\"You bland-mannered bunch of--\"\n\n\"Ah now, please,\" he said abruptly. \"My wife is not accustomed to such\nlanguage, nor is my daughter, although my son and the twins probably\nknow enough definitions to make them angry. This is an impasse, Mr.\nCornell, and it behooves all of us to be extremely polite to one\nanother. For one wrong move and you'll fire; this will mean complete\nchaos for all of us. One wrong word from you and someone of us will take\noffense, which will be equally fatal. Now, let's all stand quietly and\ntalk this over.\"\n\n\"What's to talk over?\" I demanded.\n\n\"A truce. Or call it an armistice.\"\n\n\"Do go on.\"\n\nHe looked at his family, and I followed his gaze. Miss Macklin was\nleaning against the wall with a look of concentrated interest. Her elder\nbrother Fred was standing alert and ready but not quite poised for a\nleap. Mrs. Macklin had a motherly-looking smile on her face which for\nsome unknown reason she was aiming at me in a disarming manner. The\ntwins were standing close together, both of them puzzled-looking. I\nwondered whether they were esper or telepath (twins are always the same\nwhen they're identical, and opposite when fraternal). The thing that\nreally bothered me was their attitude They all seemed to look at me as\nthough I were a poor misguided individual who had unwittingly tromped on\ntheir toes after having fallen in among bad company. They reminded me of\nthe Harrisons, who looked and sounded so sympathetic when I'd gone out\nthere seeking Catherine.\n\nA fine bunch to trust! First they swipe my girl and erase all traces of\nher; then when I go looking they offer me help and sympathy for my\ndistress. The right hand giveth and the left hand taketh away, yeah!\n\nI hated them all, yet I am not a hero-type. I wanted the whole Highways\nin Hiding rolled up like an old discarded corridor carpet, with every\nMekstrom on Earth rolled up in it. But even if I'd been filled to the\nscuppers with self-abnegation in favor of my fellow man, I could not\nhave pulled the trigger and started the shambles. For instead of blowing\nthe whole thing wide open because of a batch of bodies, the survivors\nwould have enough savvy to clean up the mess before our bodies got cold,\nand the old Highways crowd would be doing business at the same old\nstand. Without, I might add, without the minor nuisance that people call\nSteve Cornell.\n\nWhat I really wanted was to find Catherine.\n\nAnd then it came to me that what I really wanted second of all was to\npossess a body of Mekstrom Flesh, to be a physical superman.\n\n\"Suppose,\" said Miss Macklin unexpectedly, \"that it is impossible?\"\n\n\"Impossible?\" I roared. \"What have you got that I haven't got?\"\n\n\"Mekstrom's Disease,\" replied Miss Macklin quietly.\n\n\"Fine,\" I sneered. \"So how do I go out and get it?\"\n\n\"You'll get it naturally--or not at all,\" she said.\n\n\"Now see here--\" I started off, but Mr. Macklin stopped me with an\nupraised hand.\n\n\"Mr. Cornell,\" he said, \"we are in the very awkward position of trying\nto convince a man that his preconceived notion is incorrect. We can\nproduce no direct evidence to support our statement. All we can do is to\ntell you that so far as we know, and as much as we know about Mekstrom's\nDisease, no one has ever contracted the infection artificially.\"\n\n\"And how can I believe you?\"\n\n\"That's our awkward position. We cannot show you anything that will\nsupport our statement. We can profess the attitudes of honesty, truth,\nhonor, good-will, altruism, and every other word that means the same\nthing. We can talk until doomsday and nothing will be said.\"\n\n\"So where is all this getting us?\" I asked.\n\n\"I hope it is beginning to cause your mind to doubt the preconceived\nnotion,\" he said. \"Ask yourself why any outfit such as ours would\ndeliberately show you evidence.\"\n\n\"I have it and it does not make sense.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"Precisely. It does not.\"\n\nFred Macklin interrupted, \"Look, Dad, why are we bothering with all this\nguff?\"\n\n\"Because I have hopes that Mr. Cornell can be made to see our point, to\njoin, as it were, our side.\"\n\n\"Fat chance,\" I snapped.\n\n\"Please, I'm your elder and not at all inclined to waste my time. You\ncame here seeking information and you shall have it. You will not\nbelieve it, but it will, I hope, fill in some blank spots after you have\nhad a chance to compare, sort, and use your own logic on the problem. As\na mechanical engineer, you are familiar with the line of reasoning that\nwe non-engineering people call Occam's Razor?\"\n\n\"The law of least reaction,\" I said automatically.\n\n\"The what?\" asked Mrs. Macklin.\n\nMiss Macklin said, \"I'll read it from Mr. Cornell's mind, mother. The\nlaw of least reaction can be demonstrated by the following: If a bucket\nof mixed wood-shavings and gasoline are heated, there is a calculable\nprobability that the gasoline will catch fire first because the gasoline\nis easier--least reaction--to set on fire.\"\n\n\"Right,\" I said. \"But how does this apply to me?\"\n\nMr. Macklin took up the podium again: \"For one thing, your assumption\nregarding Catherine is correct. At the time of the accident she was\nfound to have Mekstrom's Disease in its earliest form. The Harrisons did\ntake her in to save her life. Now, dropping that side of the long story,\nwe must follow your troubles. The accident, to a certain group of\npersons, was a fortunate one. It placed under their medical care a\nman--you--in whose mind could be planted a certain mild curiosity about\na peculiar road sign and other evidences. The upshot of this was that\nyou took off on a tour of investigation.\"\n\nThat sounded logical, but there were a lot of questions that had open,\nragged ends flying loose.\n\nMr. Macklin went on: \"Let's diverge for the moment. Mr. Cornell, what is\nyour reaction to Mekstrom's Disease at this point?\"\n\nThat was easy. It was a curse to the human race, excepting that some\noutfit knew how to cure it. Once cured, it made a physical superman of\nthe so-called victim. What stuck in my craw was the number of\nunfortunate people who caught it and died painfully--or by their own\nhand in horror--without the sign of aid or assistance.\n\nHe nodded when I'd gone about half-way through my conclusions and before\nI got mentally violent about them.\n\n\"Mr. Cornell, you've expressed your own doom at certain hands. You feel\nthat the human race could benefit by exploitation of Mekstrom's\nDisease.\"\n\n\"It could, if everybody helped out and worked together.\"\n\n\"Everybody?\" he asked with a sly look. I yearned again for the ability\nof a telepath, and I knew that the reason why I was running around loose\nwas because I was only an esper and therefore incapable of learning the\ntruth directly. I stood there like a totem pole and tried to think.\n\nEventually it occurred to me. Just as there are people who cannot stand\ndictatorships, there are others who cannot abide democracy; in any\naggregation like the human race there will be the warped souls who feel\nsuperior to the rest of humanity. They welcome dictatorships providing\nthey can be among the dictators and if they are not included, they fight\nuntil the other dictatorship is deposed so that they can take over.\n\n\"True,\" said Mr. Macklin, \"And yet, if they declared their intentions,\nhow long would they last?\"\n\n\"Not very long. Not until they had enough power to make it stick,\" I\nsaid.\n\n\"And above all, not until they have the power to grant this blessing to\nthose whose minds agree with theirs. So now, Mr. Cornell, I'll make a\nstatement that you can accept as a mere collection of words, to be used\nin your arguments with yourself: We'll assume two groups, one working to\nset up a hierarchy of Mekstroms in which the rest of the human race will\nbecome hewers of wood and drawers of water. Contrasting that group is\nanother group who feels that no man or even a congress of men are\ncapable of picking and choosing the individual who is to be granted the\nbody of the physical superman. We cannot hope to watch the watchers, Mr.\nCornell, and we will not have on our conscience the weight of having to\nselect A over B as being more desirable. Enough of this! You'll have to\nargue it out by yourself later.\"\n\n\"Later?\" grunted Fred Macklin. \"You're not going to--\"\n\n\"I certainly am,\" said his father firmly. \"Mr. Cornell may yet be the\nagency whereby we succeed in winning out.\" He spoke to me again.\n\"Neither group dares to come into the open, Mr. Cornell. We cannot\naccuse the other group of anything nefarious, any more than they dare to\naccuse us. Their mode of attack is to coerce you into exposing us for a\ngroup of undercover operators who are making supermen.\"\n\n\"Look,\" I asked him, \"why not admit it? You've got nothing sinister in\nmind.\"\n\n\"Think of all the millions of people who have not had schooling beyond\nthe preparatory grades,\" he said. \"People of latent psi ability instead\nof trained practice, or those poor souls who have no psi ability worth\nmentioning. Do you know the history of the Rhine Institute, Mr.\nCornell?\"\n\n\"Only vaguely.\"\n\n\"In the early days of Rhine's work at Duke University, there were many\nscoffers. The scoffers and detractors, naturally enough, were those\npeople who had the least amount of psi ability. Admitting that at the\ntime all psi ability was latent, they still had less of it. But after\nRhine's death, his associates managed to prove his theories and\neventually worked out a system of training that would develop the psi\nability. Then, Mr. Cornell, those who are blessed with a high ability in\ntelepathy or perception--the common term of esper is a misnomer, you\nknow, because there's nothing extra-sensory about perception--found\nthemselves being suspected and hated by those who had not this delicate\nsense. It took forty of fifty years before common public acceptance got\naround to looking at telepathy and perception in the same light as they\nsaw a musician with a trained ear or an artist with a trained eye. Psi\nis a talent that everybody has to some degree, and today this is\naccepted with very little angry jealousy.\n\n\"But now,\" he went on thoughtfully, \"consider what would happen if we\nmade a public announcement that we could cure Mekstrom's Disease by\nmaking a physical superman out of the poor victim. Our main enemy would\nthen stand up righteously and howl that we are concealing the secret; he\nwould be believed. We would be tracked down and persecuted, eventually\nwiped out, while he sat behind his position and went on picking and\nchoosing victims whose attitude parallel his own.\"\n\n\"And who is the character?\" I demanded. I knew. But I wanted him to say\nit aloud.\n\nHe shook his head. \"I'll not say it,\" he said. \"Because I will not\naccuse him aloud, any more than he dares to tell you flatly that we are\nan underground organization that must be rooted out. He knows about our\nhighways and our way stations and our cure, because he uses the same\ncure. He can hide behind his position so long as he makes no direct\naccusation. You know the law, Mr. Cornell.\"\n\nYes, I knew the law. So long as the accuser came into court with a\ncompletely clean mind, he was safe. But Scholar Phelps could hardly make\nthe accusation, nor could he supply the tiniest smidgin of direct\nevidence to me. For in my accusation I'd implicate him as an\naccessory-accuser and then he would be called upon to supply not only\nevidence but a clear, clean, and open mind. In shorter words, the old\nstunt of pointing loudly to someone else as a dodge for covering up your\nown crime was a lost art in this present-day world of telepathic\ncompetence. The law, of course, insisted that no man could be convicted\nfor what he was thinking, but only upon direct evidence of action. But a\ncrooked-thinking witness found himself in deep trouble anyway, even\nthough crooked thinking was in itself no crime.\n\n\"Now for one more time,\" said Mr. Macklin. \"Consider a medical person\nwho cannot qualify because he is a telepath and not a perceptive. His\nvery soul was devoted to being a scholar of medicine like his father and\nhis grandfather, but his telepath ability does not allow him to be the\nfull scholar. A doctor he can be. But he can never achieve the final\ntraining, again the ultimate degree. Such a man overcompensates and\nbecomes the frustrate; a ripe disciple for the superman theory.\"\n\n\"Dr. Thorndyke!\" I blurted.\n\nHis face was as blank, as noncommittal as a bronze bust; I could neither\ndetect affirmation nor negation in it. He was playing it flat; I'd never\nget any evidence from him, either.\n\n\"So now, Mr. Cornell, I have given you food for thought. I've made no\ndirect statements; nothing that you could point to. I've defended myself\nas any man will do, but only by protestations of innocence. Therefore I\nsuggest that you take your artillery and vacate the premises.\"\n\nI remembered the Bonanza .375 that was hanging in my hand. Shamefacedly\nI slipped it back in my hip pocket. \"But look, sir--\"\n\n\"Please leave, Mr. Cornell. Any more I cannot say without laying us wide\nopen for trouble. I am sorry for you, it is no joy being a pawn. But I\nhope that your pawn-ship will work for our side, and I hope that you\nwill come through it safely. Now, please leave us quietly.\"\n\nI shrugged. I left. And as I was leaving, Miss Macklin touched my arm\nand said in a soft voice: \"I hope you find your Catherine, Steve. And I\nhope that someday you'll be able to join her.\"\n\nI nodded dumbly. It was not until I was all the way back to my car that\nI remembered that her last statement was something similar to wishing me\na case of measles so that I'd be afterward immune from them.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nAs the miles separated me from the Macklins, my mind kept whirling\naround in a tight circle. I had a lot of the bits, but none of them\nseemed to lock together very tight. And unhappily, too many of the bits\nthat fit together were hunks that I did not like.\n\nI knew the futility of being non-telepath. Had Mr. Macklin given me the\ntruth or was I being sold another shoddy bill of goods? Or had he spun\nme a yarn just to get me out of his house without a riot? Of course,\nthere had been a riot, and he'd been expecting it. If nothing else, it\nproved that I was a valuable bit of material, for some undisclosed\nreason.\n\nI had to grin. I didn't know the reason, but whatever reason they had,\nit must gripe the devil out of them to be unable to erase me.\n\nThen the grin faded. No one had told me about Catherine. They'd neatly\navoided the subject. Well, since I'd taken off on this still hunt to\nfind Catherine, I'd continue looking, even though every corner I looked\ninto turned out to be the hiding place for another bunch of mad spooks.\n\nMy mind took another tack: Admitting that neither side could rub me out\nwithout losing, why in heck didn't they just collect me and put me in a\ncage? Dammit, if I had an organization as well oiled as either of them,\nI could collect the President right out of the New White House and put\nhim in a cage along with the King of England, the Shah of Persia, and\nthe Dali Lama to make a fourth for bridge.\n\nThis was one of those questions that cannot be answered by the\napplication of logic, reasoning, or by applying either experience or\nknowledge. I did not know, nor understand. And the only way I would ever\nfind out was to locate someone who was willing to tell.\n\nThen it occurred to me that--aside from my one experience in\nhousebreaking--that I'd been playing according to the rules. I'm pretty\nmuch a law-abiding citizen. Yet it did seem to me that I learned more\nduring those times when the rules, if not broken, at least were bent\nrather sharply. So I decided to try my hand at busting a couple of\nrather high-level rules.\n\nThere was a way to track down Catherine.\n\nSo I gassed up the buggy, turned the nose East, and took off like a man\nwith a purpose in mind. En route, I laid out my course. Along that\ncourse there turned out to be seven Way Stations, according to the\nHighway signs. Three of them were along U.S. 12 on the way from\nYellowstone to Chicago. One of them was between Chicago and Hammond,\nIndiana. There was another to the south of Sandusky, Ohio, one was\nsomewhere south of Erie, Pa., and the last was in the vicinity of\nNewark. There were a lot of the Highways themselves, leading into and\nout of my main route--as well as along it.\n\nBut I ignored them all, and nobody gave me a rough time.\n\nEventually I walked into my apartment. It was musty, dusty, and\nlonesome. Some of Catherine's things were still on the table where I'd\ndropped them; they looked up at me mutely until I covered them with the\nwalloping pile of mail that had arrived in my long absence. I got a\nbottle of beer and began to go through the mail, wastebasketing the\nadvertisements, piling the magazines neatly, and filing some offers of\njobs (Which reminded me that I was still an engineer and that my funds\nwouldn't last indefinitely) and went on through the mail until I came to\na letter--The Letter.\n\n     _Dear Mr. Cornell:_\n\n     _We're glad to hear from you. We moved, not because Marian caught\n     Mekstrom's, but because the dead area shifted and left us sort of\n     living in a fish-bowl, psi-wise._\n\n     _Everybody is hale and hearty here and we all wish you the best._\n\n     _Please do not think for a moment that you owe us anything. We'd\n     rather be free of your so-called debt. We regret that Catherine was\n     not with you, maybe the accident might not have happened. But we do\n     all think that we stand as an association with a very unhappy\n     period in your life, and that it will be better for you if you try\n     to forget that we exist. This is a hard thing to say, Steve, but\n     really, all we can do for you is to remind you of your troubles._\n\n     _Therefore with love from all of us, we'd like to make this a\n     sincerely sympathetic and final--_\n\n     _Farewell, Philip Harrison._\n\nI grunted unhappily. It was a nice-sounding letter, but it did not ring\ntrue, somehow. I sat there digging it for hidden meanings, but none\ncame. I didn't care. In fact, I didn't really expect any more than this.\nIf they'd not written me at all, I'd still have done what I did. I sat\ndown and wrote Phillip Harrison another letter:\n\n     _Dear Philip:_\n\n     _I received your letter today, as I returned from an extended trip\n     through the west. I'm glad to hear that Marian is not suffering\n     from Mekstrom's Disease. I am told that it is fatal to\n     the--uninitiated._\n\n     _However, I hope to see you soon._\n\n     _Regards, Steve Cornell._\n\n_That_, I thought, _should do it!_\n\nThen to help me and my esper, I located a tiny silk handkerchief of\nCatherine's, one she'd left after one of her visits. I slipped it into\nthe envelope and slapped a stamp and a notation on the envelope that\nthis letter was to be forwarded to Phillip Harrison. I dropped it in the\nbox about eleven that night, but I didn't bother trying to follow it\nuntil the morning.\n\nUltimately it was picked up and taken to the local post office, and from\nthere it went to the clearing station at Pennsylvania Station at 34th\nSt., where I hung around the mail-baggage section until I attracted the\nattention of a policeman.\n\n\"Looking for something, Mr. Cornell?\"\n\n\"Not particularly,\" I told the telepath cop. \"Why?\"\n\n\"You've been digging every mailbag that comes out of there.\"\n\n\"Am I?\" I asked ingeniously.\n\n\"Can it Buster, or we'll let you dig your way out of a jail.\"\n\n\"You can't arrest a man for thinking.\"\n\n\"I'll be happy to make it loitering,\" he said sharply.\n\n\"I've a train ticket.\"\n\n\"Use it, then.\"\n\n\"Sure. At train time I'll use it.\"\n\n\"Which train?\" he asked me sourly. \"You've missed three already.\"\n\n\"I'm waiting for a special train, officer.\"\n\n\"Then please go and wait in the bar, Mr. Cornell.\"\n\n\"Okay. I'm sorry I caused you any trouble, but I've a bit of a personal\nproblem. It isn't illegal.\"\n\n\"Anything that involves taking a perceptive dig at the U.S. Mail is\nillegal,\" said the policeman. \"Personal or not, it's out. So either you\nstop digging or else.\"\n\nI left. There was no sense in arguing with the cop. I'd just end up\nshort. So I went to the bar and I found out why he'd recommended it. It\nwas in a faintly-dead area, hazy enough to prevent me from taking a\nsquint at the baggage section. I had a couple of fast ones, but I\ncouldn't stand the suspense of not knowing when my letter might take off\nwithout me.\n\nSince I'd also pushed my loitering-luck I gave up. The only thing I\ncould hope for was that the sealed forwarding address had been made out\nat that little town near the Harrisons and hadn't been moved. So I went\nand took a train that carried no mail.\n\nIt made my life hard. I had to wander around that tank town for hours,\nkeeping a blanket-watch on the post office for either the income or the\noutgo of my precious hunk of mail. I caught some hard eyes from the\nlocal yokels but eventually I discovered that my luck was with me.\n\nA fast train whiffled through the town and they baggage-hooked a mailbag\noff the car at about a hundred and fifty per. I found out that the next\nstop of that train was Albany. I'd have been out of luck if I'd hoped to\nride with the bag.\n\nThen came another period of haunting that dinky post office (I've\nmentioned before that it was in a dead area, so I couldn't watch the\ninsides, only the exits) until at long last I perceived my favorite bit\nof mail emerging in another bag. It was carted to the railroad station\nand hung up on another pick-up hook. I bought a ticket back to New York\nand sat on a bench near the hook, probing into the bag as hard as my\nsense of perception could dig.\n\nI cursed the whole world. The bag was merely labelled \"Forwarding Mail\"\nin letters that could be seen at ninety feet. My own letter, of course,\nI could read very well, to every dotted 'i' and crossed 't' and the\nstitching in Catherine's little kerchief. But I could not make out the\naddress printed on the form that was pasted across the front of the\nletter itself.\n\nAs I sat there trying to probe that sealed address, a fast train came\nalong and scooped the bag off the hook.\n\nI caught the next train. I swore and I squirmed and I groaned because\nthat train stopped at every wide spot in the road, paused to take on\nmilk, swap cars, and generally tried to see how long it could take to\nmake a run of some forty miles. This was Fate. Naturally, any train that\nstopped at my rattle burg would also stop at every other point along the\nroad where some pioneer had stopped to toss a beer bottle off of his\ncovered wagon.\n\nAt long last I returned to Pennsylvania Station just in time to perceive\nmy letter being loaded on a conveyor for LaGuardia.\n\nThen the same damned policeman collared me.\n\n\"This is it,\" he said.\n\n\"Now see here, officer. I--\"\n\n\"Will you come quietly, Mr. Cornell? Or shall I put the big arm on you?\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"You've been violating the 'Disclosure' section of the Federal\nCommunications Act, and I know it.\"\n\n\"Now look, officer, I said this was not illegal.\"\n\n\"I'm not an idiot, Cornell!\" I noted uncomfortably that he had dropped\nthe formal address. \"You have been trailing a specific piece of mail\nwith the express purpose of finding out where it is going. Since its\ndestination is a sealed forwarding address, your attempt to determine\nthis destination is a violation of the act.\" He eyed me coldly as if to\ndare me to deny it. \"Now,\" he finished, \"Shall I read you chapter and\nverse?\"\n\nHe had me cold. The 'Disclosure' Act was an old ruling that any\ntransmission must not be used for the benefit of any handler. When Rhine\ncame along, 'Disclosure' Act was extended to everything.\n\n\"Look officer, it's my girl,\" hoping that would make a difference.\n\n\"I know that,\" he told me flatly. \"Which is why I'm not running you in.\nI'm just telling you to lay off. Your girl went away and left you a\nsealed forwarding address. Maybe she doesn't want to see you again.\"\n\n\"She's sick,\" I said.\n\n\"Maybe her family thinks you made her sick. Now stop it and go away. And\nif I ever find you trying to dig the mail again, you'll dig iron bars.\nNow scat!\"\n\nHe urged me towards the outside of the station like a sheep-dog hazing\nhis flock. I took a cab to LaGuardia, even though it was not as fast as\nthe subway. I was glad to be out of his presence.\n\nI connected with my letter again at LaGuardia. It was being loaded\naboard a DC-16 headed for Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Hawaii, and\nManila. I didn't know how far it was going so I bought a ticket for the\nroute with my travel card and I got aboard just ahead of the closing\ndoor.\n\nMy bit of mail was in the compartment below me, and in the hour travel\ntime to Chicago, I found out that Chicago was the destination for the\nmailbag, although the superscript on the letter was still hazy.\n\nI followed the bag off the plane at Chicago and stopped long enough to\ncancel the rest of my ticket. There was no use wasting the money for the\nunused fare from Chicago to Manila. I rode into the city in a\ncombination bus-truck less than six feet from my little\npoint-of-interest. During the ride I managed to dig the superscript.\n\nIt forwarded the letter to Ladysmith, Wisconsin, and from there to a\nrural route that I couldn't understand although I got the number.\n\nThen I went back to Midway Airport and found to my disgust that the\nChicago Airport did not have a bar. I dug into this oddity for a moment\nuntil I found out that the Chicago Airport was built on Public School\nProperty and that according to law, they couldn't sell anything harder\nthan soda pop within three hundred feet of public school property, no\nmatter who rented it. So I dawdled in the bar across Cicero Avenue until\nplane time, and took an old propeller-driven Convair to Eau Claire on a\ndaisy-clipping ride that stopped at every wide spot on the course. From\nEau Claire the mail bag took off in the antediluvian Convair but I took\noff by train because the bag was scheduled to be dropped by guided\nglider into Ladysmith.\n\nAt Ladysmith I rented a car, checked the rural routes, and took off\nabout the same time as my significant hunk of mail.\n\nNine miles from Ladysmith is a flagstop called Bruce, and not far from\nBruce there is a body of water slightly larger than a duck pond called\nCaley Lake.\n\nA backroad, decorated with ornamental metal signs, led me from Bruce,\nWisconsin, to Caley Lake, where the road signs showed a missing spoke.\n\nI turned in, feeling like Ferdinand Magellan must have felt when he\nfinally made his passage through the Strait to discover the open sea\nthat lay beyond the New World. I had done a fine job of tailing and I\nwanted someone to pin a leather medal on me. The side road wound in and\nout for a few hundred yards, and then I saw Phillip Harrison.\n\nHe was poking a long tool into the guts of an automatic pump, built to\nlift water from a deep well into a water tower about forty feet tall. He\ndid not notice my arrival until I stopped my rented car beside him and\nsaid:\n\n\"Being a mechanical engineer and an esper, Phil, I can tell you that you\nhave a--\"\n\n\"A worn gasket seal,\" he said. \"It doesn't take an esper engineer to\nfigure it out. How the heck did you find us?\"\n\n\"Out in your mailbox there is a letter,\" I told him. \"I came with it.\"\n\nHe eyed me humorously. \"How much postage did you cost? Or did you come\nsecond class mail?\"\n\nI was not sure that I cared for the inference, but Phillip was kidding\nme by the half-smile on his face. I asked, \"Phil, please tell me--what\nis going on?\"\n\nHis half-smile faded. He shook his head unhappily as he said, \"Why can't\nyou leave well-enough alone?\"\n\nMy feelings welled up and I blew my scalp. \"Let well enough alone?\" I\nroared. \"I'm pushed from pillar to post by everybody. You steal my girl.\nI'm in hokus with the cops, and then you tell me that I'm to stay--\"\n\n\"Up the proverbial estuary lacking the customary means of locomotion,\"\nhe finished with a smile.\n\nI couldn't see the humor in it. \"Yeah,\" I drawled humorlessly.\n\n\"You realize that you're probably as big a liability with us as you were\ntrying to find us?\"\n\nI grunted. \"I could always blow my brains out.\"\n\n\"That's no solution and you know it.\"\n\n\"Then give me an alternative.\"\n\nPhillip shrugged. \"Now that you're here, you're here. It's obvious that\nyou know too much, Steve. You should have left well enough alone.\"\n\n\"I didn't know well enough. Besides, I couldn't have been pushed better\nif someone had slipped me--\" I stopped, stunned at the idea and then I\nwent on in a falter, \"--a post-hypnotic suggestion.\"\n\n\"Steve, you'd better come in and meet Marian. Maybe that's what\nhappened.\"\n\n\"Marian?\" I said hollowly.\n\n\"She's a high-grade telepath. Master of psi, no less.\"\n\nMy mind went red as I remembered how I'd catalogued her physical charms\non our first meeting in an effort to find out whether she were esper or\ntelepath. Marian had fine control; her mind must have positively seethed\nat my invasion of her privacy. I did not want to meet Marian face to\nface right now, but there wasn't a thing I could do about it.\n\nPhillip left his pump and waved for me to follow. He took off in his\njeep and I trailed him to the farmhouse. We went through a dim area that\nwas almost the ideal shape for a home. The ring was not complete, but\nthe open part faced the fields behind the house so that good privacy was\nensured for all practical purposes.\n\nOn the steps of the verandah stood Marian.\n\nSight of her was enough to make me forget my self-accusation of a few\nmoments ago. She stood tall and lissome, the picture of slender, robust\nhealth.\n\n\"Come in, Steve,\" she said, holding out her hand. I took it. Her grip\nwas firm and hard, but it was gentle. I knew that she could have pulped\nmy hand if she squeezed hard.\n\n\"I'm very happy to see that rumor is wrong and that you're\nnot--suffering--from Mekstrom's Disease,\" I told her.\n\n\"So now you know, Steve. Too bad.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because it adds a load to all of us. Even you.\" She looked at me\nthoughtfully for a moment, then said, \"Well, come on in and relax,\nSteve. We'll talk it out.\"\n\nWe all went inside.\n\nOn a divan in the living room, covered by a light blanket, resting in a\nvery light snooze, was a woman. Her face was turned away from me, but\nthe hair and the line of the figure and the--\n\n#Catherine!#\n\nShe turned and sat up at once, alive and shocked awake. She rubbed the\nsleep from her eyes with swift knuckles and then looked over her hands\nat me.\n\n\"Steve!\" she cried, and all the world and the soul of her was in the\nthrob of her voice.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nCatherine took one unsteady step towards me and then came forward with a\nrush. She hurled herself into my arms, pressed herself against me, held\nme tight.\n\nIt was like being attacked by a bulldozer.\n\nPhillip stayed my back against her headlong rush or I would have been\nthrown back out through the door, across the verandah, and into the\nmiddle of the yard. The strength of her crushed my chest and wrenched my\nspine. Her lips crushed mine. I began to black out from the physical\nhunger of a woman who did not know the extent of her new-found body. All\nthat Catherine remembered was that once she held me to the end of her\nstrength and yearned for more. To hold me that way now meant--death.\n\nHer body was the same slenderness, but the warm softness was gone. It\nwas a flesh-warm waist of flexible steel. I was being held by a statue\nof bronze, animated by some monster servo-mechanism. This was no woman.\n\nPhillip and Marian pried her away from me before she broke my back.\nPhillip led her away, whispering softly in her ear. Marian carried me to\nthe divan and let me down on my face gently. Her hands were gentle as\nshe pressed the air back into my lungs and soothed away the awful wrench\nin my spine. Gradually I came alive again, but there was pain left that\nmade me gasp at every breath.\n\nThen the physical hurt went away, leaving only the mental pain; the\nhorror of knowing that the girl that I loved could never hold me in her\narms. I shuddered. All that I wanted out of this life was marriage with\nCatherine, and now that I had found her again, I had to face the fact\nthat the first embrace would kill me.\n\nI cursed my fate just as any invalid has cursed the malady that makes\nhim a responsibility and a burden to his partner instead of a joy and\nhelpmeet. Like the helpless, I didn't want it; I hadn't asked for it;\nnor had I earned it. Yet all I could do was to rail against the\nunfairness of the unwarranted punishment.\n\nWithout knowing that I was asking, I cried out, \"But why?\" in a\nplaintive voice.\n\nIn a gentle tone, Marian replied: \"Steve, you cannot blame yourself.\nCatherine was lost to you before you met her at her apartment that\nevening. What she thought to be a callous on her small toe was really\nthe initial infection of Mekstrom's Disease. We're all psi-sensitive to\nMekstrom's Disease, Steve. So when you cracked up and Dad and Phil went\non the dead run to help, they caught a perception of it. Naturally we\nhad to help her.\"\n\nI must have looked bitter.\n\n\"Look, Steve,\" said Phillip slowly. \"You wouldn't have wanted us not to\nhelp? After all, would you want Catherine to stay with you? So that you\ncould watch her die at the rate of a sixty-fourth of an inch each hour?\"\n\n\"Hell,\" I snarled, \"Someone might have let me know.\"\n\nPhillip shook his head. \"We couldn't Steve. You've got to understand our\nviewpoint.\"\n\n\"To heck with your viewpoint!\" I roared angrily. \"Has anybody ever\nstopped to consider mine?\" I did not give a hoot that they could wind me\naround a doorknob and tuck my feet in the keyhole. Sure, I was grateful\nfor their aid to Catherine. But why didn't someone stop to think of the\npoor benighted case who was in the accident ward? The bird that had been\ntraipsing all over hell's footstool trying to get a line on his lost\nsweetheart. I'd been through the grinder; questioned by the F.B.I.,\nsuspected by the police; and I'd been the guy who'd been asked by a\ngrieving, elderly couple, \"But can't you remember, son?\" Them and their\nstinking point of view!\n\n\"Easy, Steve,\" warned Phillip Harrison.\n\n\"Easy nothing! What possible justification have you for putting me\nthrough my jumps?\"\n\n\"Look, Steve. We're in a precarious position. We're fighting a battle\nagainst an unscrupulous enemy, an undercover battle, Steve. If we could\nget something on Phelps, we'd expose him and his Medical Center like\nthat. Conversely, if we slip a millimeter, Phelps will clip us so hard\nthat the sky will ring. He--damn him--has the Government on his side. We\ncan't afford to look suspicious.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you have taken me in too?\"\n\nHe shook his head sadly. \"No,\" he said. \"There was a bad accident, you\nknow. The authorities have every right to insist that each and every\nautomobile on the highway be occupied by a minimum of one driver. They\nalso believe that for every accident there must be a victim, even though\nthe damage is no more than a bad case of fright.\"\n\nI could hardly argue with that. Changing the subject, I asked, \"but what\nabout the others who just drop out of sight?\"\n\n\"We see to it that plausible letters of explanation are written.\"\n\n\"So who wrote me?\" I demanded hotly.\n\nHe looked at me pointedly. \"If we'd known about Catherine before, she'd\nhave--disappeared--leaving you a trite letter. But no one could think of\na letter to explain her disappearance from an accident, Steve.\"\n\n\"Oh fine.\"\n\n\"Well, you'd still prefer to find her alive, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Couldn't someone tell me?\"\n\n\"And have you radiating the fact like a broadcasting station?\"\n\n\"Why couldn't I have joined her--you--?\"\n\nHe shook his head in the same way that a man shakes it when he is trying\nto explain _why_ two plus two are four and not maybe five or three and a\nhalf. \"Steve,\" he said, \"You haven't got Mekstroms' Disease.\"\n\n\"How do I get it?\" I demanded hotly.\n\n\"Nobody knows,\" he said unhappily. \"If we did, we'd be providing the\nrest of the human race with indestructible bodies as fast as we could\nspread it and take care of them.\"\n\n\"But couldn't I have been told _something_?\" I pleaded. I must have\nsounded like a hurt kitten.\n\nMarian put her hand on my arm. \"Steve,\" she said, \"You'd have been\nsmoothed over, maybe brought in to work for us in some dead area. But\nthen you turned up acting dangerously for all of us.\"\n\n\"Who--me?\"\n\n\"By the time you came out for your visit, you were dangerous to us.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Let me find out. Relax, will you Steve? I'd like to read you deep.\nCatherine, you come in with me.\"\n\n\"What are we looking for?\"\n\n\"Traces of post-hypnotic suggestion. It'll be hard to find because there\nwill be only traces of a plan, all put in so that it looks like natural,\nlogical reasoning.\"\n\nCatherine looked doubtful. \"When would they have the chance?\" she asked.\n\n\"Thorndyke. In the hospital.\"\n\nCatherine nodded and I relaxed. At the beginning I was very reluctant. I\ndidn't mind Catherine digging into the dark and dusty corners of my\nmind, but Marian Harrison bothered me.\n\n\"Think of the accident, Steve,\" she said.\n\nThen I managed to lull my reluctant mind by remembering that she was\ntrying to help me. I relaxed mentally and physically and regressed back\nto the day of the accident. I found it hard even then to go through the\nlove-play and sweet seriousness that went on between Catherine and me,\nknowing that Marian Harrison was a sort of mental spectator. But I\nfought down my reticence and went on with it.\n\nI practically re-lived the accident. It was easier now that I'd found\nCatherine again. It was like a cleansing bath. I began to enjoy it. So I\nwent on with my life and adventures right up to the present. Having come\nto the end, I stopped.\n\nMarian looked at Catherine. \"Did you get it?\"\n\nSilence. More silence. Then, \"It seems dim. Almost incredulous--that it\ncould be--\" with a trail-off into thought again.\n\nPhillip snorted. \"Make with the chin-music, you two. The rest of us\naren't telepaths, you know.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" said Marian. \"It's sort of complicated and hard to figure, you\nknow. What seems to be the case is sort of like this,\" she went on in an\nuncertain tone, \"We can't find any direct evidence of anything like\nhypnotic suggestion. The urge to follow what you call the Highways in\nHiding is rather high for a mere bump of curiosity, but nothing\ndefinite. I think you were probably urged very gently. Catherine\nobjects, saying that it would take a brilliant psycho-telepath to do a\njob delicate enough to produce the urge without showing the traces of\nthe operation.\"\n\n\"Someone of scholar grade in both psychology and telepathy,\" said\nCatherine.\n\nI thought it over for a moment. \"It seems to me that whoever did it--if\nit was done--was well aware that a good part of this urge would be\ngenerated by Catherine's total and unexplicable disappearance. You'd\nhave saved yourselves a lot of trouble--and saved me a lot of heartache\nif you'd let me know something. God! Haven't you any feelings?\"\n\nCatherine looked at me from hurt eyes. \"Steve,\" she said quietly, \"A\nbillion girls have sworn that they'd rather die than live without their\none and only. I swore it too. But when your life's end is shown to you\non a microscope slide, love becomes less important. What should I do?\nJust die? Painfully?\"\n\nThat was handing it to me on a platter. It hurt but I am not\nchuckleheaded enough to insist that she come with me to die instead of\nleaving me and living. What really hurt was not knowing.\n\n\"Steve,\" said Marian. \"You know that we couldn't have told you the\ntruth.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I agreed disconsolately.\n\n\"Let's suppose that Catherine wrote you a letter telling you that she\nwas alive and safe, but that she'd reconsidered the marriage. You were\nto forget her and all that. What happens next?\"\n\nUnhappily I told him. \"I'd not have believed it.\"\n\nPhillip nodded. \"Next would have been a telepath-esper team. Maybe a\nperceptive with a temporal sense who could retrace that letter back to\nthe point of origin, teamed up with a telepath strong enough to drill a\nhole through the dead area that surrounds New Washington. Why, even\nbefore Rhine Institute, it was sheer folly for a runaway to write a\nletter. What would it be now?\"\n\nI nodded. What he said was true, but it did not ease the hurt.\n\n\"Then on the other hand,\" he went on in a more cheerful vein, \"Let's\ntake another look at us and you, Steve. Tell me, fellow, where are you\nnow?\"\n\nI looked up at him. Phillip was smiling in a knowing-superior sort of\nmanner. I looked at Marian. She was half-smiling. Catherine looked\nsatisfied. I got it.\n\n\"Yeah. I'm here.\"\n\n\"You're here without having any letters, without leaving any broad trail\nof suspicion upon yourself. You've not disappeared, Steve. You've been\na-running up and down the country all on your own decision. Where you go\nand what you do is your own business and nobody is going to set up a hue\nand cry after you. Sure, it took a lot longer this way. But it was a lot\nsafer.\" He grinned wide then as he went on, \"And if you'd like to take\nsome comfort out of it, just remember that you've shown yourself to be\nquite capable, filled with dogged determination, and ultimately\nsuccessful.\"\n\nHe was right. In fact, if I'd tried the letter-following stunt long\nearlier, I'd have been here a lot sooner.\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"So what do we do now?\"\n\n\"We go on and on and on, Steve, until we're successful.\"\n\n\"Successful?\"\n\nHe nodded soberly. \"Until we can make every man, woman, and child on the\nface of this Earth as much physical superman as we are, our job is not\nfinished.\"\n\nI nodded. \"I learned a few of the answers at the Macklin Place.\"\n\n\"Then this does not come as a complete shock.\"\n\n\"No. Not a complete shock. But there are a lot of loose ends still. So\nthe basic theme I'll buy. Scholar Phelps and his Medical Center are busy\nusing their public position to create the nucleus of a totalitarian\nstate, or a physical hierarchy. You and the Highways in Hiding are busy\ntearing Phelps down because you don't want to see any more rule by the\nDivine Right of Kings, Dictators, or Family Lines.\"\n\n\"Go on, Steve.\"\n\n\"Well, why in the devil don't you announce yourselves?\"\n\n\"No good, old man. Look, you yourself want to be a Mekstrom. Even with\nyour grasp of the situation, you resent the fact that you cannot.\"\n\n\"You're right.\"\n\nPhillip nodded slowly. \"Let's hypothesize for a moment, taking a subject\nthat has nothing to do with Mekstrom's Disease. Let's take one of the\nold standby science-fiction plots. Some cataclysm is threatening the\nsolar system. The future of the Earth is threatened, and we have only\none spacecraft capable of carrying a hundred people to safety--somewhere\nelse. How would you select them?\"\n\nI shrugged. \"Since we're hypothecating, I suppose that I'd select the\nmore healthy, the more intelligent, the more virile, the more--\" I\nstruggled for another category and then let it stand right there because\nI couldn't think of another at that instant.\n\nPhillip agreed. \"Health and intelligence and all the rest being pretty\nmuch a matter of birth and upbringing, how can you explain to Wilbur\nZilch that Oscar Hossenpfeiffer has shown himself smarter and healthier\nand therefore better stock for survival? Maybe you can, but the\nend-result is that Wilbur Zilch slaughters Oscar Hossenpfeiffer. This\neither provides an opening for Zilch, or if he is caught at it, it\nprovides Zilch with the satisfaction of knowing that he's stopped the\nother guy from getting what he could not come by honestly.\"\n\n\"So what has this to do with Mekstrom's Disease and supermen?\"\n\n\"The day that we--and I mean either of us--announces that we can 'cure'\nMekstrom's Disease and make physical supermen of the former victims,\nthere will be a large scream from everybody to give them the same\ntreatment. No, we'll tell them, we can't cure anybody who hasn't caught\nit. Then some pedagogue will stand up and declare that we are\nsuppressing information. This will be believed by enough people to do us\nmore harm than good. Darn it, we're not absolutely indestructible,\nSteve. We can be killed. We could be wiped out by a mob of angry\ncitizens who saw in us a threat to their security. Neither we of the\nHighways nor Phelps of The Medical Center have enough manpower to be\nsafe.\"\n\n\"So that I'll accept. The next awkward question comes up: What are we\ngoing to do with me?\"\n\n\"You've agreed that we cannot move until we know how to inoculate\nhealthy flesh. We need normal humans, to be our guinea pigs. Will you\nhelp bring to the Earth's People the blessing that is now denied them?\"\n\n\"If you are successful, Steve,\" said Marian, \"You'll go down in History\nalong with Otto Mekstrom. You could be the turning point of the human\nrace, you know.\"\n\n\"And if I fail?\"\n\nPhillip Harrison's face took on a hard and determined look. \"Steve,\nthere can be no failure. We shall go on and on until we have success.\"\n\nThat was a fine prospect. Old guinea-pig Cornell, celebrating his\nseventieth birthday as the medical experimentation went on and on.\n\nCatherine was leaning forward, her eyes bright. \"Steve,\" she cried,\n\"You've just _got_ to!\"\n\n\"Just call me the unwilling hero,\" I said in a drab voice. \"And put it\ndown that the condemned specimen drank a hearty dinner. I trust that\nthere is a drink in the house.\"\n\nThere was enough whiskey in the place to provide the new specimen with a\nnear-total anesthesia. The evening was spent in forced badinage, shallow\nlaughter, and a pointed avoidance of the main subject. The whiskey was\ngood; I took it undiluted and succeeded in getting boiled to the\neyebrows before they carted me off to bed.\n\nI did not sleep well despite my anesthesia. There was too much on my\nmind and very little of it was the fault of the Harrisons. One of the\nthings that I had to face was the cold fact that part of Catherine's\nlack of communication with me was caused by logic and good sense. Both\nHistory and Fiction are filled with cases where love was set aside\nbecause consummation was impossible for any number of good reasons.\n\nSo I slept fitfully, and my dreams were as unhappy as the thoughts I had\nduring my waking moments. Somehow I realized that I'd have been far\nbetter off if I'd been able to forget Catherine after the accident, if\nI'd been able to resist the urge to follow the Highways in Hiding, if\nI'd never known that those ornamental road signs were something more\nthan the desire of some road commissioner to beautify the countryside.\nBut no, I had to go and poke my big bump of curiosity into the problem.\nSo here I was, resentful as all hell because I was denied the pleasure\nof living in the strong body of a Mekstrom.\n\nIt was not fair. Although Life itself is seldom fair, it seemed to me\nthat Life was less fair to me than to others.\n\nAnd then to compound my feelings of persecution, I woke up once about\nthree in the morning with a strong urge to take a perceptive dig down\nbelow. I should have resisted it, but of course, no one has ever been\nable to resist the urge of his sense of perception.\n\nDown in the living room, Catherine was crying on Phillip Harrison's\nshoulder. He held her gently with one arm around her slender waist and\nhe was stroking her hair softly with his other hand. I couldn't begin to\ndig what was being said, but the tableau was unmistakable.\n\nShe leaned back and looked at him as he said something. Her head moved\nin a 'No' motion as she took a deep breath for another bawl. She buried\nher face in his neck and sobbed. Phillip held her close for a moment and\nthen loosed one hand to find a handkerchief for her. He wiped her eyes\ngently and talked to her until she shook her head in a visible effort to\nshake away both the tears and the unhappy thoughts.\n\nEventually he lit two cigarettes and handed one to her. Side by side\nthey walked to the divan and sat down close together. Catherine leaned\nagainst him gently and he put his arm over her shoulders and hugged her\nto him. She relaxed, looking unhappy, but obviously taking comfort in\nthe strength and physical presence of him.\n\nIt was a hell of a thing to dig in my mental condition. I drifted off to\na sleep filled with unhappy dreams while they were still downstairs.\nFrankly, I forced myself into fitful sleep because I did not want to\nstay awake to follow them.\n\nAs bad as the nightmare quality of my dreams were, they were better for\nme than the probable reality.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOh, I'd been infernally brilliant when I uncovered the first secret of\nthe Highways in Hiding. I found out that I did not know one-tenth of the\ntruth. They had a network of Highways that would make the Department of\nRoads and Highways look like a backwood, second-rate, political\norganization.\n\nI'd believed, for instance, that the Highways were spotted only along\nmain arteries to and from their Way Stations. The truth was that they\nhad a complete system from one end of the country to the other. Lanes\nled from Maine and from Florida into a central main Highway that laid\nacross the breadth of the United States. Then from Washington and from\nSouthern California another branching network met this main Highway.\nLesser lines served Canada and Mexico. The big Main Trunk ran from New\nYork to San Francisco with only one large major division: A heavy line\nthat led down to a place in Texas called _Homestead_. Homestead, Texas,\nwas a big center that made Scholar Phelps' Medical Center look like a\nTeeny Weeny Village by comparison.\n\nWe drove in Marian's car. My rented car, of course, was returned to the\nagency and my own bus would be ferried out as soon as it could be\narranged so that I'd not be without personal transportation in Texas.\nCatherine remained in Wisconsin because she was too new at being a\nMekstrom to know how to conduct herself so that the fact of her\nsuper-powerful body did not cause a lot of slack jaws and high\nsuspicion.\n\nWe drove along the Highways to Homestead, carrying a bag of the Mekstrom\nMail.\n\nThe trip was uneventful.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nSince this account of my life and adventures is not being written\nwithout some plan, it is no mere coincidence that this particular\nsection comes under Chapter Thirteen. Old Unlucky Thirteen covers ninety\ndays which I consider the most dismal ninety days of my life. Things,\nwhich had been going along smoothly had, suddenly got worse.\n\nWe started with enthusiasm. They cut and they dug and they poked needles\ninto me and trimmed out bits of my hide for slides. I helped them by\ndigging my own flesh and letting their better telepaths read my results\nfor their records.\n\nThey were nice to me. I got the best of everything. But being nice to me\nwas not enough; it sort of made me feel like Gulliver in Brobdingnag.\nThey were so over-strong that they did not know their own strength. This\nwas especially true of the youngsters of Mekstrom parents. I tried to\nre-diaper a baby one night and got my ring finger gummed for my efforts.\nIt was like wrestling Bad Cyril in a one-fall match, winner take all.\n\nAs the days added up into weeks, their hope and enthusiasm began to\nfade. The long list of proposed experiments dwindled and it became\nobvious that they were starting to work on brand new ideas. But brand\nnew ideas are neither fast in arriving nor high in quantity, and time\nbegan to hang dismally heavy.\n\nThey began to avoid my eyes. They stopped discussing their attempts on\nme; I no longer found out what they were doing and how they hoped to\naccomplish the act. They showed the helplessness that comes of failure,\nand this feeling of utter futility was transmitted to me.\n\nAt first I was mentally frantic at the idea of failure, but as the\nfutile days wore on and the fact was practically shoved down my throat,\nI was forced to admit that there was no future for Steve Cornell.\n\nI began at that time to look forward to my visit to reorientation.\n\nReorientation is a form of mental suicide. Once reoriented, the problems\nthat make life intolerable are forgotten, your personality is changed,\nyour grasp of everything is revised, your appreciation of all things\ncomes from an entirely new angle. You are a new person.\n\nThen one morning I faced my image in the mirror and came to the\nconclusion that if I couldn't be Me, I didn't want to be Somebody Else.\nIt is no good to be alive if I am not me, I told my image, who\nobediently agreed with me.\n\nI didn't even wait to argue with Me. I just went out and got into my car\nand sloped. It was not hard; everybody in Homestead trusted me.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nI left homestead with a half-formed idea that I was going to visit\nBruce, Wisconsin, long enough to say goodbye to Catherine and to release\nher from any matrimonial involvement she may have felt binding. I did\nnot relish this idea, but I felt that getting it out, done, and agreed\nwas only a duty.\n\nBut as I hit the road and had time to think, I knew that my half-formed\nintention was a sort of martyrdom; I was going to renounce myself in a\nfine welter of tears and then go staggering off into the setting sun to\ndie of my mental wounds. I took careful stock of myself and faced the\nfact that my half-baked idea was a sort of suicide-wish; walking into\nany Mekstrom way station now was just asking for capture and a fast trip\nto their reorientation rooms. The facts of my failure and my\ntaking-of-leave would be indication enough for Catherine that I was\nbowing out. It would be better for Catherine, too, to avoid a fine,\nhigh-strung, emotional scene. I remembered the little bawling session in\nthe Harrison living room that night; Catherine would not die for want of\na sympathetic hand on her shoulder. In fact, as she'd said\npragmatically, well balanced people never die of broken hearts.\n\nHaving finally convinced myself of the validity of this piece of obvious\nlogic, I suddenly felt a lot better. My morose feeling faded away; my\nconviction of utter uselessness died; and my half-formed desire to\ninvestigate a highly hypothetical Hereafter took an abrupt about-face.\nAnd in place of this collection of undesirable self-pities came a much\nnicer emotion. It was a fine feeling, that royal anger that boiled up\ninside of me. I couldn't lick 'em and I couldn't join 'em, so I was\ngoing out to pull something down, even if it all came down around my own\nears.\n\nI stopped long enough to check the Bonanza .375 both visually and\nperceptively and then loaded it full. I consulted a road map to chart a\ncourse. Then I took off with the coal wide open and the damper rods all\nthe way out and made the wheels roll towards the East.\n\nI especially gave all the Highways a very wide berth. I went down\nseveral, but always in the wrong direction. And in the meantime, I kept\nmy sense of perception on the alert for any pursuit. I drove with my\neyes alone. I could have made it across the Mississippi by nightfall if\nI'd not taken the time to duck Highway signs. But when I got good, and\nsick, and tired of driving, I was not very far from the River. I found a\nmotel in a rather untravelled spot and sacked in for the night.\n\nI awoke at the crack of dawn with a feeling of impending _something_. It\nwas not doom, because any close-danger would have nudged me on the bump\nof perception. Nor was it good, because I'd have awakened looking\nforward to it. Something odd was up and doing. I dressed hastily, and as\nI pulled my clothing on I took a slow dig at the other cabins in the\nmotel.\n\nNumber One contained a salesman type, I decided, after digging through\nhis baggage. Number Two was occupied by an elderly couple who were\nloaded with tourist-type junk and four or five cameras. Number Three\nharbored a stopover truck driver and Number Four was almost overflowing\nwith a gang of schoolgirls packed sardine-wise in the single bed. Number\nFive was mine. Number Six was vacant. Number Seven was also vacant but\nthe bed was tumbled and the water in the washbowl was still running out,\nand the door was still slamming, and the little front steps were still\nclicking to the fast clip of high heels, and----\n\nI hauled myself out of my cabin on a dead gallop and made a fast line\nfor my car. I hit the car, clawed myself inside, wound up the turbine\nand let the old heap in gear in one unbroken series of motions. The\nwheels spun and sent back a hail of gravel, then they took a bite out of\nthe parking lot and the take-off snapped my head back.\n\nBoth esper and eyesight were very busy cross-stitching a crooked course\nthrough the parking lot between the parked cars and the trees that were\nintended to lend the outfit a rustic atmosphere. So I was too busy to\ntake more than a vague notice of a hand that clamped onto the doorframe\nuntil the door opened and closed again. By then I was out on the highway\nand I could relax a bit.\n\n\"Steve,\" she said, \"why do you do these things?\"\n\nYeah, it was Marian Harrison. \"I didn't ask to get shoved into this\nmess,\" I growled.\n\n\"You didn't ask to be born, either,\" she said.\n\nI didn't think the argument was very logical, and I said so. \"Life\nwasn't too hard to bear until I met you people,\" I told her sourly.\n\"Life would be very pleasant if you'd go away. On the other hand, life\nis all I've got and it's far better than the alternative. So if I'm\nmaking your life miserable, that goes double for me.\"\n\n\"Why not give it up?\" she asked me.\n\nI stopped the car. I eyed her dead center, eye to eye until she couldn't\ntake it any more. \"What would you like me to just give up, Marian? Shall\nI please everybody by taking a bite of my hip-pocket artillery sights\nwhilst testing the trigger pull with one forefinger? Will it make\nanybody happy if I walk into the nearest reorientation museum blowing\nsmoke out of my nose and claiming that I am a teakettle that's gotta be\ntaken off the stove before I blow my lid?\"\n\nMarian's eyes dropped.\n\n\"Do you yourself really expect me to seek blessed oblivion?\"\n\nShe shook her head slowly.\n\n\"Then for the love of God, what do you expect of me?\" I roared. \"As I\nam, I'm neither flesh nor fish; just foul. I'm not likely to give up,\nMarian. If I'm a menace to you and to your kind, it's just too tough.\nBut if you want me out of your hair, you'll have to wrap me up in\nsomething suitable for framing and haul me kicking and screaming to your\nmind-refurbishing department. Because I'm not having any on my own.\nUnderstand?\"\n\n\"I understand, Steve,\" she said softly. \"I know you; we all know you and\nyour type. You can't give up. You're unable to.\"\n\n\"Not when I've been hypnoed into it,\" I said.\n\nMarian's head tossed disdainfully. \"Thorndyke's hypnotic suggestion was\nvery weak,\" she explained. \"He had to plant the idea in such a way as to\nremain unidentified afterwards. No, Steve, your urge has always been\nyour own personal drive. All that Thorndyke did was to point you\nslightly in our direction and give you a nudge. You did the rest.\"\n\n\"Well, you're a telepath. Maybe you're also capable of planting a\npost-hypnotic suggestion that I forget the whole idea.\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" she said with a sudden flare.\n\nI looked at her. Not being a telepath I couldn't read a single thought,\nbut it was certain that she was telling the truth, and telling it in\nsuch a manner as to be convincing. Finally I said, \"Marian, if you know\nthat I'm not to be changed by logic or argument, why do you bother?\"\n\nFor a full minute she was silent, then her eyes came up and gave it back\nto me with their electric blue. \"For the same reason that Scholar Phelps\nhoped to use you against us,\" she said. \"Your fate and your future is\ntied up with ours whether you turn out to be friend or enemy.\"\n\nI grunted. \"Sounds like a soap opera, Marian,\" I told her bitterly.\n\"Will Catherine find solace in Phillip's arms? Will Steve catch\nMekstrom's Disease? Will the dastardly Scholar Phelps--\"\n\n\"Stop it!\" she cried.\n\n\"All right. I'll stop as soon as you tell me what you intend to do with\nme now that you've caught up with me again.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"Steve, I'm going along with you. Partly to play the\ntelepath-half of your team. If you'll trust me to deliver the truth. And\npartly to see that you don't get into trouble that you can't get out of\nagain.\"\n\nMy mind curled its lip. Pappy had tanned my landing gear until I was out\nof the habit of using mother for protection against the slings and\narrows of outrageous schoolchums. I'd not taken sanctuary behind a\nwoman's skirts since I was eight. So the idea of running under the\nprotection of a woman went against the grain, even though I knew that\nshe was my physical superior by no sensible proportion. Being cared for\nphysically by a dame of a hundred-ten--\n\n\"Eighteen.\"\n\n--didn't sit well on me.\n\n\"Do you believe me, Steve?\"\n\n\"I've got to. You're here to stay. I'm a sucker for a good-looking woman\nanyway, it seems. They tell me anything and I'm not hardhearted enough\nto even indicate that I don't believe them.\"\n\nShe took my arm impulsively; then she let me go before she pinched it\noff at the elbow. \"Steve,\" she said earnestly, \"Believe me and let me be\nyour--\"\n\n#Better half?# I finished sourly.\n\n\"Please don't,\" she said plaintively. \"Steve, you've simply _got_ to\ntrust _somebody_!\"\n\nI looked into her face coldly. \"The hardest job in the world for a\nnon-telepath is to locate someone he can trust. The next hardest is to\nexplain that to a telepath; because telepaths can't see any difficulty\nin weeding out the non-trustworthy. Now--\"\n\n\"You still haven't faced the facts.\"\n\n\"Neither have you, Marian. You intend to go along with me, ostensibly to\nhelp me in whatever I intend to do. That's fine. I'll accept it. But you\nknow good and well that I intend to carry on and on until something\ncracks. Now, tell me honestly, are you going along to help me crack\nsomething wide open, or just to steer me into channels that will not\nresult in a crack-up for your side?\"\n\nMarian Harrison looked down for a moment; I didn't need telepathy to\nknow that I'd touched the sore spot. Then she looked up and said,\n\"Steve, more than anything, I intend to keep you out of trouble. You\nshould know by now that there is very little you can really do to harm\neither side of our own private little war.\"\n\n#And if I can't harm either side, I can hardly do either side any good.#\n\nShe nodded.\n\n#Yet I must be of some importance.#\n\nShe nodded again. At that point I almost gave up. I'd been around this\ncircle so many times in the past half-year that I knew how the back of\nmy head looked. Always, the same old question.\n\n#_Cherchez le angle_,# I thought in bum French. Something I had was\nimportant enough to both sides to make them keep me on the loose instead\nof erasing me and my nuisance value. So far as I could see, I was as\nuseless to either side as a coat of protective paint laid on stainless\nsteel. I was immune to Mekstrom's Disease; the immunity of one who has\nhad everything tried on him that scholars of the disease could devise.\nAbout the only thing that ever took place was the sudden disappearance\nof everybody that I came in contact with.\n\nMarian touched my arm gently. \"You mustn't think like that, Steve,\" she\nsaid gently. \"You've done enough useless self-condemnation. Can't you\nstop accusing yourself of some evil factor? Something that really is not\nso?\"\n\n\"Not until I know the truth,\" I replied. \"I certainly can't dig it; I'm\nno telepath. Perhaps if I were, I'd not be in this awkward position.\"\n\nAgain her silence proved to me that I'd hit a touchy spot. \"What am I?\"\nI demanded sourly. \"Am I a great big curse? What have I done, other than\nto be present just before several people turn up missing? Makes me sort\nof a male Typhoid Mary, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Now, Steve--\"\n\n\"Well, maybe that's the way I feel. Everything I put my great big\nclutching hands on turns dark green and starts to rot. Regardless of\nwhich side they're on, it goes one, two, three, four; Catherine,\nThorndyke, You, Nurse Farrow.\"\n\n\"Steve, what on Earth are you talking about?\"\n\nI smiled down at her in a crooked sort of quirk. \"You, of course, have\nnot the faintest idea of what I'm thinking.\"\n\n\"Oh, Steve--\"\n\n\"And then again maybe you're doing your best to lead my puzzled little\nmind away from what you consider a dangerous subject?\"\n\n\"I'd hardly do that--\"\n\n\"Sure you would. I'd do it if our positions were reversed. I don't think\nit un-admirable to defend one's own personal stand, Marian. But you'll\nnot divert me this time. I have a hunch that I am a sort of male Typhoid\nMary. Let's call me old Mekstrom Steve. The carrier of Mekstrom's\nDisease, who can innocently or maliciously go around handing it out to\nanybody that I contact. Is that it, Marian?\"\n\n\"It's probably excellent logic, Steve. But it isn't true.\"\n\nI eyed her coldly. \"How can I possibly believe you?\"\n\n\"That's the trouble,\" she said with a plaintive cry. \"You can't. You've\ngot to believe me on faith, Steve.\"\n\nI smiled crookedly. \"Marian,\" I said, \"That's just the right angle to\ntake. Since I cannot read your mind, I must accept the old appeal to the\nemotions. I must tell myself that Marian Harrison just simply could not\nlie to me for many reasons, among which is that people do not lie to\nblind men nor cause the cripple any hurt. Well, phooey. Whatever kind of\ngambit is being played here, it is bigger than any of its parts or\npieces. I'm something between a queen and a pawn, Marian; a piece that\ncan be sacrificed at any time to further the progress of the game.\nSlipping me a lie or two to cause me to move in some desired direction\nshould come as a natural.\"\n\n\"But why would we lie to you?\" she asked, and then she bit her lip; I\nthink that she slipped, that she hadn't intended to urge me into deeper\nconsideration of the problem lest I succeed in making a sharp analysis.\nAfter all, the way to keep people from figuring things out is to stop\nthem from thinking about the subject. That's the first rule. Next comes\nthe process of feeding them false information if the First Law cannot be\ninvoked.\n\n\"Why would you lie to me?\" I replied in a sort of sneer. I didn't really\nwant to sneer but it came naturally. \"In an earlier age it might not be\nnecessary.\"\n\n\"What?\" she asked in surprise.\n\n\"Might not be necessary,\" I said. \"Let's assume that we are living in\nthe mid-Fifties, before Rhine. Steve Cornell turns up being a carrier of\na disease that is really a blessing instead of a curse. In such a time,\nMarian, either side could sign me up openly as a sort of missionary; I\ncould go around the country inoculating the right people, those citizens\nwho have the right kind of mind, attitude, or whatever-factor. Following\nme could be a clean-up corps to collect the wights who'd been inoculated\nby my contact. Sounds reasonable, doesn't it?\" Without waiting for\neither protest or that downcast look of agreement, I went on: \"But now\nwe have perception and telepathy all over the place. So Steve Cornell,\nthe carrier, must be pushed around from pillar to post, meeting people\nand inoculating them without ever knowing what he is doing. Because once\nhe knows what he is doing, his usefulness is ended in this world of\nRhine Institute.\"\n\n\"Steve--\" she started, but I interrupted again.\n\n\"About all I have to do now is to walk down any main street radiating my\nsuspicions,\" I said bitterly. \"And it's off to Medical Center for\nSteve--unless the Highways catch me first.\"\n\nVery quietly, Marian said, \"We really dislike to use reorientation on\npeople. It changes them so--\"\n\n\"But that's what I'm headed for, isn't it?\" I demanded flatly.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Steve.\"\n\nAngrily I went on, not caring that I'd finally caught on and by doing so\nhad sealed my own package. \"So after I have my mind ironed out smoothly,\nI'll still go on and on from pillar to post providing newly inoculated\nMekstroms for your follow-up squad.\"\n\nShe looked up at me and there were tears in her eyes. \"We were all\nhoping--\" she started.\n\n\"Were you?\" I asked roughly. \"Were you all working to innoculate me at\nHomestead, or were you really studying me to find out what made me a\ncarrier instead of a victim?\"\n\n\"Both, Steve,\" she said, and there was a ring of honesty in her tone. I\nhad to believe her, it made sense.\n\n\"Dismal prospect, isn't it?\" I asked. \"For a guy that's done nothing\nwrong.\"\n\n\"We're all sorry.\"\n\n\"Look,\" I said with a sudden thought, \"Why can't I still go on? I could\nstart a way station of some sort, on some pretext, and go on\ninnoculating the public as they come past. Then I could go on working\nfor you and still keep my right mind.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Scholar Phelps knows,\" she said. \"Above all things\nwe must keep you out of his hands. He'd use you for his own purpose.\"\n\nI grunted sourly. \"He has already and he will again,\" I told her. \"Not\nonly that, but Phelps has had plenty of chance to collect me on or off\nthe hook. So what you fear does not make sense.\"\n\n\"It does now,\" she told me seriously. \"So long as you did not suspect\nyour own part in the picture, you could do more good for Phelps by\nrunning free. Now you know and Phelps' careful herding of your motions\nwon't work.\"\n\n\"Don't get it.\"\n\n\"Watch,\" she said with a shrug. \"They'll try. I don't dare experiment,\nSteve, or I'd leave you right now. You'd find out very shortly that\nyou're with me because I got here first.\"\n\n\"And knowing the score makes me also dangerous to your Highways? Likely\nto bring 'em out of Hiding?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So now that I've dumped over the old apple cart, I can assume that\nyou're here to take me in.\"\n\n\"What else can I do, Steve?\" she said unhappily.\n\nI couldn't answer that. I just sat there looking at her and trying to\nremember that her shapely one hundred and eighteen pounds were steel\nhard and monster strong and that she could probably carry me under one\narm all the way to Homestead without breathing hard. I couldn't cut and\nrun; she could outrun me. I couldn't slug her on the jaw and get away;\nI'd break my hand. The Bonanza .375 would probably stun her, but I have\nnot the cold blooded viciousness to pull a gun on a woman and drill her.\nI grunted sourly, that weapon had been about as useful to me as a\nstuffed bear or an authentic Egyptian Obelisk.\n\n\"Well, I'm not going,\" I said stubbornly.\n\nShe looked at me in surprise. \"What are you going to do?\" she asked me.\n\nI felt a glow of self-confidence. If I could not run loose with guilty\nknowledge of my being a Mekstrom Carrier, it was equally impossible for\nanybody to kidnap me and carry me across the country. I'd radiate like\nmad; I'd complain about the situation at every crossroad, at every\nfilling station, before every farmer. I'd complain mentally and\nbitterly, and sooner or later someone would get suspicious.\n\n\"Don't think like an idiot,\" she told me sharply. \"You drove across the\ncountry before, remember? How many people did you convince?\"\n\n\"I wasn't trying, then--\"\n\n\"How about the people in the hotel in Denver?\" she asked me pointedly.\n\"What good did you do there?\"\n\n#Very little, but--#\n\n\"One of the advantages of a telepath is that we can't be taken by\nsurprise,\" she informed me. \"Because no one can possibly work without\nplans of some kind.\"\n\n\"One of the troubles of a telepath,\" I told her right back, \"is that\nthey get so confounded used to knowing what is going to happen next that\nit takes all the pleasant element of surprise out of their lives. That\nmakes 'em dull and--\"\n\nThe element of surprise came in through the back window, passed between\nus and went _Splat!_ against the wind-shield. There was the sound like\nsomeone chipping ice with a spike followed by the distant bark of a\nrifle. A second slug came through the back window about the time that\nthe first one landed on the floor of the car. The second slug, not\nslowed by the shatter-proof glass in the rear, went through the\nshatter-proof glass in the front. A third slug passed through the same\ntunnel.\n\nThese were warning shots. He'd missed us intentionally. He'd proved it\nby firing three times through the same hole, from beyond my esper range.\n\nI wound up the machinery and we took off. Marian cried something about\nnot being foolish, but her words were swept out through the hole in the\nrear window, just above the marks on the pavement caused by my tires as\nwe spun the wheels.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\n\n\"Steve, stop it!\" cried Marian as soon as she could get her breath.\n\n\"Nuts,\" I growled. I took a long curve on the outside wheels and ironed\nout again. \"He isn't after our corpse, honey. He's after our hide. I\ndon't care for any.\"\n\nThe fourth shot went singing off the pavement to one side. It whined\ninto the distance making that noise that sets the teeth on edge and\nmakes one want to duck. I lowered the boom on the go pedal and tried to\nmake the meter read off the far end of the scale; I had a notion that\nthe guy behind might shoot the tires out if we were going slow enough so\nthat a blowout wouldn't cause a bad wreck; but he probably wouldn't do\nit once I got the speed up. He was not after Marian. Marian could walk\nout of any crack-up without a bruise, but I couldn't.\n\nWe went roaring around a curve. I fought the wheel into a nasty double\n's' curve to swing out and around a truck, then back on my own side of\nthe road again to avoid an oncoming car. I could almost count the front\nteeth of the guy driving the car as we straightened out with a coat of\nvarnish to spare. I scared everybody in all three vehicles, including\nme.\n\nThen I passed a couple of guys standing beside the road; one of them\nwaved me on, the other stood there peering past me down the road. As we\nroared by, another group on the other side of the highway came running\nout hauling a big old hay wagon. They set the wagon across the road and\nthen sloped into the ditch on either side of it.\n\nI managed to dig the bare glimmer of firearms before I had to yank my\nperception away from them and slam it back on the road in front. I was\nnone too soon, because dead ahead by a thousand feet or so, they were\nhauling a second road block out.\n\nMarian, not possessed of esper, cried out as soon as she read this new\nmenace in my mind. I rode the brakes easily and came to a stop long\nbefore we hit it. In back sounded a crackle of rifle fire; in front,\nthree men came out waving their rifles at us.\n\nI whipped the car back, spun it in a seesaw, and took off back towards\nthe first road block. Half way back I whirled my car into a rough\nsideroad just as the left hand rear tire went out with a roar. The car\nsagged and dragged me to a stop with my nose in a little ditch. The heap\nhadn't stopped rocking yet before I was out and on the run.\n\n\"Steve!\" cried Marian. \"Come back!\"\n\n#To heck with it.# I kept right on running. Before me by a couple of\nhundred yards was a thicket of trees; I headed that way fast. I managed\nto sling a dig back; Marian was joining the others; pointing in my\ndirection. One of them raised the rifle but she knocked it down.\n\nI went on running. It looked as though I'd be all right so long as I\ndidn't get in the way of an accidental shot. My life was once more\ncharmed with the fact that no one wanted me dead.\n\nThe thicket of woods was not as thick as I'd have liked. From a distance\nthey'd seemed almost impenetrable, but when I was running through them\ntowards the center, they looked pitifully thin. I could see light from\nany direction and the floor of the woods was trimmed, the underbrush\ncleaned out, and a lot of it was tramped down.\n\nAhead of me I perceived a few of them coming towards the woods warily,\nbehind me there was another gang closing in. I began to feel like the\ncaterpillar on the blade of grass in front of the lawn mower.\n\nI tried to hide under a deadfall, knowing that it was poor protection\nagainst rifle fire. I hauled out the Bonanza and checked the cylinder. I\ndidn't know which side I was going to shoot at, but that didn't bother\nme. I was going to shoot at the first side that got close.\n\nA couple of shots whipped by over my head, making noises like someone\nsnapping a bullwhip. I couldn't tell which direction they came from; I\nwas too busy trying to stuff my feet into a gopher hole under my\ndeadfall.\n\nI cast around the thicket with my sense of perception and caught the\nlayout. Both sides were spread out, stalking forward like infantry\nadvancing through disputed ground. Now and then one of them would raise\nhis rifle and fire at some unexpected motion. This, I gathered, was more\nnervousness than fighting skill because no group of telepaths and/or\nperceptives would be so jittery on the trigger if they weren't basically\nnervous. They should, as I did, have the absolute position of both the\nenemy and their own side.\n\nWith a growing nervous sweat I dug their advances. They were avoiding my\nposition, trying to encircle me by making long semicircular marches,\nhoping to get between me and the other side. This was a rough maneuver,\nsort of like two telepaths playing chess. Both sides knew to a minute\nexactly what the other had in mind, where he was, and what he was going\nto do about his position. But they kept shifting, feinting and\ncounter-advancing, trying to gain the advantage of number or position so\nthat the other would be forced to retreat. It became a war of nerves; a\ngame of seeing who had the most guts; who could walk closer to the\nmuzzle of an enemy rifle without getting hit.\n\nTheir rifles were mixed; there were a couple of deer guns, a nice 35-70\nExpress that fired a slug slightly smaller than a panetella cigar, a few\nshotguns, a carbine sports rifle that looked like it might have been a\nGarand with the barrel shortened by a couple of inches, some revolvers,\none nasty-looking Colt .45 Automatic, and so on.\n\nI shivered down in my little hideout; as soon as the shooting started in\nearnest, they were going to clean out this woods but good. It was going\nto be a fine barrage, with guns going off in all directions, because it\nis hard to keep your head in a melee. Esper and telepathy go by the\nboard when shooting starts.\n\nI still didn't know which side was which. The gang behind me were\nfriends of Marian Harrison; but that did not endear them to me any more\nthan knowing that the gang in front were from Scholar Phelps Medical\nCenter or some group affiliated with him. In the midst of it, I managed\nto bet myself a new hat that old Scholar Phelps didn't really know what\nwas going on. He would be cagey enough to stay ignorant of any overt\nstrife or any other skullduggery that could be laid at his door.\n\nThen on one edge of the woodsy section, two guys of equal damfool-factor\nadvanced, came up standing, and faced one another across fifty feet of\nopen woods. Their rifles came up and yelled at one another like a string\nof firecrackers; they wasted a lot of powder and lead by not taking\ncareful aim. One of them emptied his rifle and started to fade back to\nreload, the other let him have it in the shoulder. It spun the guy\naround and dumped him on his spine. His outflung hand slammed his rifle\nagainst a tree, which broke it. He gave a painful moan and started to\ncrawl back, his arm hanging limp-like but not broken. From behind me\ncame a roar and a peltering of shotgun pellets through the trees; it was\nanswered by the heavy bark of the 35-70 Express. I'm sure that in the\nentire artillery present, the only rifle heavy enough to really damage\nthose Mekstroms was that Express, which would stop a charging rhino.\nWhen you get down to facts, my Bonanza .375 packed a terrific wallop but\nit did not have the shocking power of the heavy big-game rifle.\n\nMotion caught my perception to one side; two of them had let go shotgun\nblasts from single-shot guns. They were standing face to face swinging\ntheir guns like a pair of axemen; swing, chop! swing, chop! and with\neach swing their guns were losing shape, splinters from the butts, and\nbits of machinery. Their clothing was in ribbons from the shotgun\nblasts. But neither of them seemed willing to give up. There was not a\nsign of blood; only a few places on each belly that looked shiny-like.\nOn the other side of me, one guy let go with a rifle that slugged the\nother bird in the middle. He folded over the shot and his middle went\nback and down, which whipped his head over, back, and down where it hit\nthe ground with an audible thump. The first guy leaped forward just as\nthe victim of his attack sat up, rubbed his belly ruefully, and drew a\nhunting knife with his other hand. The first guy took a running dive at\nthe supine one, who swung the hunting knife in a vicious arc. The point\nhit the chest of the man coming through the air but it stopped as though\nthe man had been wearing plate armor. You could dig the return shock\nthat stunned the knife-wielder's arm when the point turned. All it did\nwas rip the clothing. Then the pair of them were at it in a free-for-all\nthat made the woods ring. This deadly combat did not last long. One of\nthem took aim with a fist and let the other have it. The rifle shot\nhadn't stopped him but the hard fist of another Mekstrom laid him out\ncolder than a mackerel iced for shipment.\n\nThe deadly 35-70 Express roared again, and there started a concentration\nof troops heading towards the point of origin. I had a hunch that the\nother side did not like anybody to be playing quite as rough as a\nbig-game gun. Someone might really get hurt.\n\nBy now they were all in close and swinging; now and then someone would\nstand off and gain a few moments of breathing space by letting go with a\nshotgun or knocking someone off of his feet with a carbine. There was\nsome bloodshed, too; not all these shots bounced. But from what I could\nperceive, none of them were fatal. Just painful. The guy who'd been\nstopped first with the rifle slug and then the other Mekstrom's fist was\nstill out cold and bleeding lightly from the place in his stomach. A bit\nhorrified, I perceived that the pellet was embedded about a half-inch\nin. The two birds who'd been hacking at one another with the remains of\ntheir shotguns had settled it barehanded, too. The loser was groaning\nand trying to pull himself together. The shiny spots on his chest were\nshotgun pellets stuck in the skin.\n\nIt was one heck of a fight.\n\nMekstroms could play with guns and knives and go around taking swings at\none another with hunks of tree or clubbed rifles, or they could stand\noff and hurl boulders. Such a battlefield was no place for a guy named\nSteve Cornell.\n\nBy now all good sense and fine management was gone. If I'd been spotted,\nthey'd have taken a swing at me, forgetting that I am no Mekstrom. So I\ndecided that it was time for Steve to leave.\n\nI cast about me with my perception; the gang that Marian had joined had\nadvanced until they were almost even with my central position; there\nwere a couple of swinging matches to either side and one in front of me.\nI wondered about Marian; somehow I still don't like seeing a woman\ntangled up in a free-for-all. Marian was out of esper range, which was\nall right with me.\n\nI crawled out of my hideout cautiously, stood up in a low crouch and\nbegan to run. A couple of them caught sight of me and put up a howl, but\nthey were too busy with their personal foe to take off after me. One of\nthem was free; I doubled him up and dropped him on his back with a slug\nfrom my Bonanza .375. Somehow it did not seem rough or vicious to shoot\nsince there was nothing lethal in it. It was more like a game of cowboy\nand Indian than deadly earnest warfare.\n\nThen I was out and free of them all, out of the woods and running like a\ndeer. I cursed the car with its blown out tire; the old crate had been a\nfine bus, nicely broken in and conveniently fast. But it was as useful\nto me now as a pair of skids.\n\nA couple of them behind me caught on and gave chase. I heard cries for\nme to stop, which I ignored like any sensible man. Someone cut loose\nwith a roar; the big slug from the Express whipped past and went\n_Sprang!_ off a rock somewhere ahead.\n\nIt only added a few more feet per second to my flight. If they were\ngoing to play that rough, I didn't care to stay.\n\nI fired an unaimed shot over my shoulder, which did no good at all\nexcept for lifting my morale. I hoped that it would slow them a bit, but\nif it did I couldn't tell. Then I leaped over a ditch and came upon a\ncluster of cars. I dug at them as I approached and selected one of the\nfaster models that still had its key dangling from the lock.\n\nI was in and off and away as fast as a scared man can move. They were\nstill yelling and fighting in the woods when I raced out of my range.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe heap I'd jumped was a Clinton Special with rock-like springs and a\nlow slung frame that hugged the ground like a clam. I was intent upon\nputting as many miles as I could between me and the late engagement in\nas short a time as possible, and the Clinton seemed especially apt until\nI remembered that the figure 300 on the dial meant kilometers instead of\nmiles per hour. Then I let her out a bit more and tried for the end of\nthe dial. The Clinton tried with me, and I had to keep my esper\ncarefully aimed at the road ahead because I was definitely overdriving\nmy eyesight and reaction-time.\n\nI was so intent upon making feet that I did not notice the jetcopter\nthat came swooping down over my head until the howl of its vane-jets\nraised hell with my eardrums. Then I slowed the car and lifted my\nperception at the same time for a quick dig.\n\nThe jetcopter was painted Policeman Blue and it sported a large\ngold-leaf on its side, and inside the cabin were two hard-faced\ngentlemen wearing uniforms with brass buttons and that Old Bailey look\nin their eye. The one on the left was jingling a pair of handcuffs.\n\nThey passed over my head at about fifteen feet, swooped on past by a\nthousand, and dropped a road-block bomb. It flared briefly and let out\nwith a billow of thick red smoke.\n\nI leaned on the brakes hard enough to stand the Clinton up on its nose,\nbecause if I shoved my front bumper through that cloud of red smoke it\nwas a signal for them to let me have it. I came to a stop about a foot\nthis side of the bomb, and the jetcopter came down hovering. Its vanes\nblew the smoke away and the 'copter landed in front of my swiped Clinton\nSpecial.\n\nThe policeman was both curt and angry. \"Driver's ticket, registration,\nand maybe your pilot's license,\" he snapped.\n\nWell, that was _it_. I had a driver's ticket all right, _but_ it did not\npermit me to drive a car that I'd selected out of a group willy nilly.\nThe car registration was in the glove compartment where it was supposed\nto be, but what it said did not match what the driver's license claimed.\nNo matter what I said, there would be the Devil to pay.\n\n\"I'll go quietly, officer,\" I told him.\n\n\"Darn' white of you, pilot,\" he said cynically. He was scribbling on a\nbook of tickets and it was piling up deep. Speeding, reckless driving,\nviolation of ordinance something-or-other by number. Driving a car\nwithout proper registration in the absence of the rightful owner (Check\nfor stolen car records) and so on and on and on until it looked like a\nlife term in the local jug.\n\n\"Move over, Cornell,\" he said curtly. \"I'm taking you in.\"\n\nI moved politely. The only time it pays to be arrogant with the police\nis long after you've proved them wrong, and then only when you're facing\nyour mirror at home telling yourself what you should have said.\n\nI was driven to court; escorted in by the pair of them and seated with\none on each side. The sign on the judge's table said: Magistrate\nHollister.\n\nMagistrate Hollister was an elderly gentleman with a cast iron jaw and a\nglance as cold as a bucket of snow. He dealt justice with a sharp-edged\nshovel and his attitude seemed to be that everybody was either guilty as\ncharged or was contemplating some form of evil to be committed as soon\nas he was out of the sight of Justice. I sat there squirming while he\npiled the top on a couple whose only crime was parking overtime; I\nitched from top to bottom while he slapped one miscreant in gaol for\nturning left in violation of City Ordinance. His next attempt gave a ten\ndollar fine for failing to come to a full and grinding halt at the sign\nof the big red light, despite the fact that the criminal was esper to a\nfine degree and dug the fact that there was no cross-traffic for a half\nmile.\n\nThen His Honor licked his chops and called my name.\n\nHe speared me with an icicle-eye and asked sarcastically: \"Well, Mr.\nCornell, with what form of sophistry are you going to explain your\nrecent violations?\"\n\nI blinked.\n\nHe aimed a cold glance at the bailiff, who arose and read off the\ncharges against me in a deep, hollow intonation.\n\n\"Speak up!\" he snapped. \"Are you guilty or not guilty?\"\n\n\"Guilty,\" I admitted.\n\nHe beamed a sort of self-righteous evil. It was easy to see that never\nin his tenure of office had he ever encountered a criminal as hardened\nand as vicious as I. Nor one who admitted to his turpitude so blandly. I\nfelt it coming, and it made me itch, and I knew that if I tried to\nscratch His Honor would take the act as a personal affront. I fought\ndown the crazy desire to scratch everything I could reach and it was\nhard; about the time His Honor added a charge of endangering human life\non the highway to the rest of my assorted crimes, the itch had localized\ninto the ring finger of my left hand. That I could scratch by rubbing it\nagainst the seam of my trousers.\n\nThen His Honor went on, delivering Lecture Number Seven on Crime,\nDelinquency, and Grand Larceny. I was going to be an example, he vowed.\nI was assumed to be esper since no normal--that's the word he used,\nwhich indicated that the old bird was a blank and hated everybody who\nwasn't--human being would be able to drive as though he had eyes mounted\na half mile in front of him. Not that my useless life was in danger, or\nthat I was actually not-in-control of my car, but that my actions made\nfor panic among normal--again he used it!--people who were not blessed\nwith either telepathy or perception by a mere accident of birth. The\nlast one proved it; it was not an accident of birth so much as it was\nproper training, to my way of thinking. Magistrate Hollister hated\npsi-trained people and was out to make examples of them.\n\nHe polished off his lecture by pronouncing sentence: \"--and the Law\nprovides punishment by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars, or a\nsentence of ninety days in jail--_or both_.\" He rolled the latter off as\nthough he relished the sound of the words.\n\nI waited impatiently. The itch on my finger increased; I flung a fast\ndig at it but there was nothing there but Sophomore's Syndrome. Good old\nnervous association. It was the finger that little Snoodles, the\nthree-month baby supergirl had munched to a faretheewell. Darned good\nthing the kid didn't have teeth! But I was old Steve, the immune, the\ncarrier, the--\n\n\"Well, Mr. Cornell?\"\n\nI blinked. \"Yes, your honor?\"\n\n\"Which will it be? I am granting you the leniency of selecting which\npenalty you prefer.\"\n\nI could probably rake up a thousand by selling some stock, personal\npossessions, and draining my already-weakened bank account. The most\nvaluable of my possessions was parked in a ditch with a blowout and\nprobably a bent frame and even so, I only owned about six monthly\npayments worth of it.\n\n\"Your Honor, I will prefer to pay the fine--if you'll grant me time in\nwhich to go and collect--\"\n\nHe rapped his desk with his gavel. \"Mr. Cornell,\" he boomed angrily. \"A\nthief cannot be trusted. Within a matter of minutes you could remove\nyourself from the jurisdiction of this court unless a binding penalty is\nplaced against your person. You may go on your search for money, but\nonly after posting bond--to the same amount as your fine!\"\n\n_Lenient--?_\n\n\"However, unless you are able to pay, I have no recourse but to exact\nthe prison sentence of ninety days. Bailiff--!\"\n\nI gave up. It even felt sort of good to give up, especially when the\nturn is called by someone too big to be argued with. No matter what, I\nwas going to take ninety days off, during which I could sit and think\nand plan and wonder and chew my fingernails.\n\nThe itch in my finger burned again, deep this time, and not at all easy\nto satisfy by rubbing it against my trousers. I picked at it with the\nthumbnail and the nail caught something hard.\n\nI looked down at the itching finger and sent my perception into it with\nas much concentration as I could.\n\nMy thumbnail had lifted a tiny circle no larger than the head of a pin.\nBlood was oozing from beneath the lifted rim, and I nervously picked off\nthe tiny patch of hard, hard flesh and watched the surface blood well\nout into a tiny droplet. My perception told me the truth: It was\nMekstrom's Disease and not a doubt. The Immune had caught it!\n\nThe bailiff tapped me on the shoulder and said, \"Come along, Cornell!\"\n\nAnd I was going to have ninety days to watch that patch grow at the\ninexorable rate of one sixty-fourth of an inch per hour!\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\n\nThe bailiff repeated, \"Come along, Cornell.\" Then he added sourly, \"Or\nI'll have to slip the cuffs on you.\"\n\nI turned with a helpless shrug. I'd tried to lick 'em and I'd tried to\njoin 'em and I'd failed both. Then, as of this instant when I might have\nbeen able to go join 'em, I was headed for the wrong side as soon as I\nopened my big yap. And if I didn't yelp, I was a dead one anyway. Sooner\nor later someone in the local jug would latch on to my condition and\npack me off to Scholar Phelps' Medical Center.\n\nOnce more I was in a situation where all I could do was to play it by\near, wait for a break, and see if I could make something out of it.\n\nBut before I could take more than a step or two toward the big door,\nsomeone in the back of the courtroom called out:\n\n\"Your Honor, I have some vital information in this case.\"\n\nHis Honor looked up across the court with a great amount of irritation\nshowing in his face. His voice rasped, \"Indeed?\"\n\nI whirled, shocked.\n\nSuavely, Dr. Thorndyke strode down the aisle. He faced the judge and\nexplained who he was and why, then he backed it up with a wallet full of\ncredentials, cards, identification, and so forth. The judge looked the\nshebang over sourly but finally nodded agreement. Thorndyke smiled\nself-confidently and then went on, facing me:\n\n\"It would be against my duty to permit you to incarcerate this\nmiscreant,\" he said smoothly. \"Because Mr. Cornell has Mekstrom's\nDisease!\"\n\nEverybody faded back and away from me as though he'd announced me to be\nthe carrier of plague. They looked at me with horror and disgust on\ntheir faces, a couple of them began to wipe their hands with\nhandkerchiefs; one guy who'd been standing where I'd dropped my little\npatch of Mekstrom Flesh backed out of that uncharmed circle. Some of the\nspectators left hurriedly.\n\nHis Honor paled. \"You're certain?\" he demanded of Dr. Thorndyke.\n\n\"I'm certain. You'll note the blood on his finger; Cornell recently\npicked off a patch of Mekstrom Flesh no larger than the head of a pin.\nIt was his first sign.\" The doctor went on explaining, \"Normally this\nearly seizure would be difficult to detect, except from a clinical\nexamination. But since I am telepath and Cornell has perception, his own\nmind told me he was aware of his sorry condition. One only need read his\nmind, or to dig at the tiny bit of Mekstrom Flesh that he dropped to\nyour floor.\"\n\nThe judge eyed me nastily. \"Maybe I should add a charge of contaminating\na courtroom,\" he muttered. He was running his eyes across the floor from\nme to wherever I'd been, trying to locate the little patch. I helped him\nby not looking at it. The rest of the court faded back from me still\nfarther. I could hardly have been less admired if I'd been made of pure\ncyanide gas.\n\nThe judge rapped his gavel sharply. \"I parole this prisoner in the\ncustody of Dr. Thorndyke, who as a representative of the Medical Center\nwill remove the prisoner to that place where the proper treatment awaits\nhim.\"\n\n\"Now see here--\" I started. But His Honor cut me off.\n\n\"You'll go as I say,\" he snapped. \"Unfortunately, the Law does not\npermit me to enjoy any cruel or unusual punishments, or I'd insist upon\nyour ninety-day sentence and watch you die painfully. I--Bailiff! Remove\nthis menace before I forget my position here and find myself in contempt\nof the law I have sworn to uphold. I cannot be impartial before a man\nwho contaminates my Court with the world's most dangerous disease!\"\n\nI turned to Thorndyke. \"All right,\" I grunted. \"You win.\"\n\nHe smiled again; I wanted to wipe that smile away with a set of knuckles\nbut I knew that all I'd get would be a broken hand against Thorndyke's\nstone-hard flesh. \"Now, Mr. Cornell,\" he said with that clinical\nsmoothness, \"let's not get the old standard attitude.\"\n\n\"Nearly everybody who contracts Mekstrom's Disease,\" he said to the\njudge, \"takes on a persecution complex as soon as he finds out that he\nhas it. Some of them have even accused me of fomenting some big\nfantastic plot against them. Please, Mr. Cornell,\" he went on facing me,\n\"we'll give you the best of treatment that Medical Science knows.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I grunted.\n\nHis Honor rapped on the gavel once more. \"Officer Gruenwald,\" he\nsnapped, \"you will accompany the prisoner and Dr. Thorndyke to the\nMedical Center and having done that you will return to report to me that\nyou have accomplished your mission.\"\n\nThen the judge glared around, rapped once more, and cried, \"Case\nFinished. Next Case!\"\n\nI felt almost as sorry for the next guy coming in as I felt for myself.\nHis Honor was going to be one tough baby for some days to come. As they\nescorted me out, a janitor came in and began to swab the floor where I'd\nbeen standing. He was using something nicely corrosive that made the\nicy, judicial eyes water, all of which discomfort was likely to be added\nto the next law-breaker's sorry lot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was in fine company. Thorndyke was a telepath and Officer Gruenwald\nwas perceptive. They went as a team and gave me about as much chance to\nescape as if I'd been a horned toad sealed in a cornerstone. Gruenwald,\nof course, treated me as though my breath was deadly, my touch foul, and\nmy presence evil. In Gruenwald's eyes, the only difference between me\nand Medusa the Gorgon was that looking at me did not turn him to stone.\nHe kept at least one eye on me almost constantly.\n\nI could almost perceive Thorndyke's amusement. With the best of social\namenities, he could hardly have spent a full waking day in the company\nof either a telepath or a perceptive without giving away the fact that\nhe was Mekstrom. But with me to watch over, Officer Gruenwald's mental\nattention was not to be turned aside to take an impolite dig at his\ncompanion. Even if he had, Thorndyke would have been there quickly to\nturn his attention aside.\n\nI've read the early books that contain predictions of how we are\nsupposed to operate. The old boys seemed to have the quaint notion that\na telepath should be able at once to know everything that goes on\neverywhere, and a perceptive should be aware of everything material\nabout him. There should be no privacy. There was to be no defense\nagainst the mental peeping Tom.\n\nIt ain't necessarily so. If Gruenwald had taken a dig at Thorndyke's\nhide, the doctor would have speared the policeman with a cold, indignant\neye and called him for it. Of course, there was no good reason for\nGruenwald to take a dig at Thorndyke and so he didn't.\n\nSo I went along with the status quo and tried to think of some way to\nbreak it up.\n\nAn hour later I was still thinking, and the bleeding on my finger had\nstopped. Mekstrom Flesh had covered the raw spot with a thin, stone-hard\nplate that could not be separated visually from the rest of my skin.\n\n\"As a perceptive,\" observed Dr. Thorndyke in a professional tone,\n\"you'll notice the patch of infection growing on Mr. Cornell's finger.\nThe rate of growth seems normal; I'll have to check it accurately once I\nget him to the clinic. In fifty or sixty hours, Mr. Cornell's finger\nwill be solid to the first joint. In ninety days his arm will have\nbecome as solid as the arm of a marble statue.\"\n\nI interjected, \"And what do we do about it?\"\n\nHe moved his head a bit and eyed me in the rear view mirror. \"I hope we\ncan help you, Cornell,\" he said in a tone of sympathy that was\ndefinitely intended to impress Officer Gruenwald with his medical\nappreciation of the doctor's debt to humanity. \"I sincerely hope so. For\nin doing so, we will serve the human race. And,\" he admitted with an\nentirely human-sounding selfishness, \"I may be able to deliver a thesis\non the cure that will qualify me for my scholarate.\"\n\nI took a fast stab: \"Doctor, how does my flesh differ from yours?\"\n\nThorndyke parried this attention-getting question: \"Mine is of no\nconsequence. Dig your own above and below the line of infection,\nCornell. If your sense of perception has been trained fine enough, dig\nthe actual line of infection and watch the molecular structure\nrearrange. Can you dig that fine, Officer? Cornell, I hate to dwell at\nlength upon your misfortune, but perhaps I can help you face it by\nbringing the facts to light.\"\n\n#Like the devil you hate to dwell, Doctor Mekstrom!#\n\nIn the rear view mirror, his lips parted in a bland smile and one eyelid\ndropped in a knowing wink.\n\nI opened my mouth to make another stab in the open but Thorndyke got\nthere first. \"Officer Gruenwald,\" he suggested, \"you can help by putting\nout your perception along the road ahead and seeing how it goes. I'd\nlike to make tracks with this crate.\"\n\nGruenwald nodded.\n\nThorndyke put the goose-pedal down and the car took off with a howl of\npassing wind. He said with a grin, \"It isn't very often that I get a\nchance to drive like this, but as long as I've an officer with me--\"\n\nHe was above one forty by the time he let his voice trail off.\n\nI watched the back of their heads for a moment. At this speed, Thorndyke\nwould have both his mind and his hands full and the cop would be digging\nat the road as far ahead as his perception could dig a clear\nappreciation of the road and its hazards. Thorndyke's telepathy would be\noccupied in taking this perception and using it. That left me free to\nthink.\n\nI cast a dig behind me, as far behind me as my perception would reach.\nNothing.\n\nI thought furiously. It resulted in nothing.\n\nI needed either a parachute or a full set of Mekstrom Hide to get out of\nthis car now. With either I might have taken a chance and jumped. But as\nit was, the only guy who could scramble out of this car was Dr. James\nThorndyke.\n\nI caught his dropping eyelid in the rear view mirror again and swore at\nhim under my breath.\n\nTime, and miles, went past. One after the other, very fast. We hissed\nthrough towns where the streets had been opened for us and along broad\nstretches of highway and between cars and trucks running at normal\nspeeds. One thing I must say for Thorndyke: He was almost as good a\ndriver as I.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy second arrival at the Medical Center was rather quiet. I went in the\nservice entrance, so to speak, and didn't get a look at the enamelled\nblonde at the front portal. They whiffed me in at a broad gate that was\nopened by a flunky and we drove for another mile through the grounds far\nfrom the main road. We ended up in front of a small brick building and\nas we went through the front office into a private place, Thorndyke told\na secretary that she should prepare a legal receipt for my person. I did\nnot like being bandied about like a hunk of merchandise, but nobody\nseemed to care what I thought. It was all very fast and efficient. I'd\nbarely seated myself and lit a cigarette when the nurse came in with the\ndocument which Thorndyke signed, she witnessed, and was subsequently\nhanded to Officer Gruenwald.\n\n\"Is there any danger of me--er--contracting--\" he faltered uncertainly\nto Dr. Thorndyke.\n\n\"You'll notice that--\" I started to call attention to Thorndyke's\ncalmness at being in my presence and was going to invite Gruenwald to\ntake a dig at the doctor's hide, but once more the doctor blocked me.\n\n\"None of us have ever found any factor of contagion,\" he said. \"And we\nlive among Mekstrom Cases. You'll notice Miss Clifton's lack of\nconcern.\"\n\nMiss Clifton, the nurse, turned a calm face to the policeman and gave\nhim her hand. Miss Clifton had a face and a figure that was enough to\nmake a man forget anything. She knew her part very well; together, the\nnurse and the policeman left the office together and I wondered just why\na non-Mekstrom would have anything to do with an outfit like this.\n\nThorndyke smiled and said, \"I won't tell you, Steve. What you don't know\nwon't hurt anybody.\"\n\n\"Mind telling me what I'm slated for? The high jump? Going to watch me\nwrithing in pain as my infection climbs toward my vitals? Going to\namputate? Or are you going to cut it off inch by inch and watch me\nsuffer?\"\n\n\"Steve, some things you know already. One, that you are a carrier. There\nhave been no other carriers. We'd like to know what makes you a\ncarrier.\"\n\n#The laboratory again?# I thought.\n\nHe nodded. \"Also whether your final contraction of Mekstrom's Disease\nremoves the carrier-factor.\"\n\nI said hopefully, \"I suppose as a Mekstrom I'll eventually be qualified\nto join you?\"\n\nThorndyke looked blank. \"Perhaps,\" he said flatly.\n\nTo my mind, that flat _perhaps_ was the same sort of reply that Mother\nused to hand me when I wanted something that she did not want to give.\nI'd been eleven before I got walloped across the bazoo by pointing out\nto her that _we'll see_ really meant _no_, because nothing that she said\nit to ever came to pass.\n\n\"Look, Thorndyke, let's take off our shoes and stop dancing,\" I told\nhim. \"I have a pretty good idea of what's been going on. I'd like an\nhonest answer to what's likely to go on from here.\"\n\n\"I can't give you that.\"\n\n\"Who can?\"\n\nHe said nothing, but he began to look at me as though I weren't quite\nbright. That made two of us, I was looking at him in the same manner.\n\nMy finger itched a bit, saving the situation. I'd been about to forget\nthat Thorndyke was a Mekstrom and take a swing at him.\n\nHe laughed at me cynically. \"You're in a very poor position to dictate\nterms,\" he said sharply.\n\n\"All right,\" I agreed reluctantly. \"So I'm a prisoner. I'm also under a\nsentence of death. Don't think me unreasonable if I object to it.\"\n\n\"The trouble with your thinking is that you expect all things to be\nblack or white and so defined. You ask me, 'am I going to live or die?'\nand expect me to answer without qualification. I can only tell you that\nI don't know which. That it all depends.\"\n\n\"Depends upon exactly what?\"\n\nHe eyed me with a cold stare. \"Whether you're worthy of living.\"\n\n\"Who's to decide?\"\n\n\"We will.\"\n\nI grunted, wishing that I knew more Latin. I wanted to quote that Latin\nplatitude about who watches the watchers. He watched me narrowly, and I\nexpected him to quote me the phrase after having read my mind. But\napparently the implication of the phrase did not appeal to him, and so\nhe remained silent.\n\nI broke the silence by saying, \"What right has any man or collection of\nmen to decide whether I, or anyone else, has the right to live or die?\"\n\n\"It's done all the time,\" he replied succinctly.\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Criminals are--\"\n\n\"I'm not a criminal; I've violated no man-made law. I've not even\nviolated very many of the Ten Commandments. At least, not the one that\nis punishable by death.\"\n\nHe was silent for a moment again, then he said, \"Steve, you're the\nvictim of loose propaganda.\"\n\n\"Who isn't?\" I granted. \"The entire human race is lambasted by one form\nof propaganda or another from the time the infant learns to sit up until\nthe elderly lays down and dies. We're all guilty of loose thinking. My\nown father, for instance, had to quit school before he could take any\nadvanced schooling, had to fight his way up, had to collect his advanced\neducation by study, application, and hard practice. He always swore that\nthis long period of hardship strengthened his will and his character and\ngave him the guts to go out and do things that he'd never have thought\nof if he'd had an easy life. Then the old duck turns right around and\nswears that he'll never see any son of his take the bumps as he took\nthem.\"\n\n\"That's beside the point, Steve. I know what sort of propaganda you've\nbeen listening to. It's the old do-good line; the everything for anybody\nline; the no man must die alone line.\"\n\n\"Is it bad?\"\n\nDr. Thorndyke shrugged. \"You've talked about loose propaganda,\" he said.\n\"Well, in this welter of loose propaganda, every man had at least the\nopportunity of choosing which line of guff he intends to adhere to. I'm\neven willing to admit that there is both right and wrong on both sides.\nAre you?\"\n\nI stifled a sour grin. \"I shouldn't, because it is a mistake in any\npolitical argument to even let on that the other guy is slightly more\nthan an idiot. But as an engineer, I'll admit it.\"\n\n\"Now that's a help,\" he said more cheerfully. \"You're objecting, of\ncourse, to the fact that we are taking the right to pick, choose, and\nselect those people that we think are more likely to be of good\nadvantage to the human race. You've listened to that old line about the\nhypothetical cataclysm that threatens the human race, and how would you\nchoose the hundred people who are supposed to carry on. Well, have you\never eyed the human race in slightly another manner?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't know,\" I told him. \"Maybe.\"\n\n\"Have you ever watched the proceedings of one of those big trials where\nsome conkpot has blown the brains out of a half-dozen citizens by\npointing a gun and emptying it at a crowd? If you have, you've been\nappalled by the sob sisters and do-gooders who show that the vicious\ncharacter was momentarily off his toggle. We mustn't execute a nut, no\nmatter how vicious he is. We've got to protect him, feed him, and house\nhim for the next fifty years. Now, not only is he doing Society\nabsolutely no damned good while he's locked up for fifty years, he's\nalso eating up his share of the standard of living. Then to top this\noff, so long as this nut is alive, there is the danger that some\nsoft-hearted fathead will succeed in getting him turned loose once\nmore.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" I said. \"But you're again talking about criminals, which I\ndon't think applies in my case.\"\n\n\"No, of course not,\" he said quickly. \"I used it to prove to you that\nthis is one way of looking at a less concrete case. Carry this soft\nheaded thinking a couple of steps higher. Medical science has made it\npossible for the human race to dilute its strength. Epileptics are saved\nto breed epileptics; haemophiliacs are preserved, neurotics are ironed\nout, weaknesses of all kinds are kept alive to breed their strain of\nweakness.\"\n\n\"Just what has this to do with me and my future?\" I asked.\n\n\"Quite a lot. I'm trying to make you agree that there are quite a lot of\nundeserving characters here on Earth.\"\n\n\"Did I ever deny it?\" I asked him pointedly, but he took it as not\nincluding present company.\n\nBut I could see where Thorndyke was heading. First eliminate the lice on\nthe body politic. Okay, so I am blind and cannot see the sense of\nincarcerating a murderer that has to be fed, clothed, and housed at my\nexpense for the rest of his natural life. Then for the second step we\nget rid of weaklings, both physical and mental. I'll call Step Two\npassably okay, but--? Number Three includes grifters, beggars, bums, and\nguys out for the soft touch and here I begin to wonder. I've known some\nentertaining grifters, beggars, and bums; a few of them chose their way\nof life for their own, just as I became a mechanical engineer.\n\nThe trouble with this sort of philosophy is that it starts off with an\nappeal to justice and logic (I'm quoting myself), but it quickly gets\ndangerous. Start knocking off the bilge-scum. Then when the lowest\nstrata of society is gone, start on the next. Carry this line of\nreasoning out to straight Aristotelian Logic and you come up with\nparties like you and me, who may have been quite acceptable when\ncompared to the whole cross-section of humanity, but who now have no one\nbut his betters to compete with.\n\nI had never reasoned this out before, but as I did right there and then,\nI decided that Society cannot draw lines nor assume a static pose.\nSociety must move constantly, either in one direction or the other. And\nwhile I object to paying taxes to support some rattlehead for the rest\nof his natural life, I'd rather have it that way than to have someone\nstart a trend of bopping off everybody who has not the ability to absorb\nthe educational level of the scholar. Because, if the trend turned\nupward instead of downward, that's where the dividing line would end.\n\nAnarchy at one end, is as bad as tyranny at the other--\n\n\"I'm sorry you cannot come to a reasonable conclusion,\" said Dr.\nThorndyke. \"If you cannot see the logic of--\"\n\nI cut him off short. \"Look, Doc,\" I snapped, \"If you can't see where\nyour line of thinking ends, you're in bad shape.\"\n\nHe looked superior. \"You're sour because you know you haven't got what\nit takes.\"\n\nI almost nipped. \"You're so damned dumb that you can't see that in any\nsociety of supermen, you'd not be qualified to clean out ash trays,\" I\ntossed back at him.\n\nHe smiled self-confidently. \"By the time they start looking at my\nlevel--if they ever do--you'll have been gone long ago. Sorry, Cornell.\nYou don't add up.\"\n\nWell, that was nothing I didn't know already. In his society, I was a\nnonentity. Yet, somehow, if that's what the human race was coming to\nunder the Thorndyke's and the Phelps', I didn't care to stay around.\n\n\"All right,\" I snapped. \"Which way do I go from here? The laboratory, or\nwill you dispense with the preliminaries and let me take the high slide\nright now before this--\" I held up my infected finger, \"gets to the\npainful stages.\"\n\nWith the air and tone of a man inspecting an interesting specimen\nimpaled on a mounting pin, Thorndyke replied:\n\n\"Oh--we have use for the likes of you.\"\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\nIt would please me no end to report here that the gang at the Medical\nCenter were crude, rough, vicious, and that they didn't give a damn\nabout human suffering. Unfortunately for my sense of moral balance, I\ncan't. They didn't cut huge slices out of my hide without benefit of\nanaesthesia. They didn't shove pipe-sized needles into me, or strap me\non a board and open me up with dull knives. Instead, they treated me as\nif I'd been going to pay for my treatment and ultimately emerge from the\nCenter to go forth and extol its virtues. I ate good food, slept in a\nclean and comfortable bed, smoked free cigarettes, read the best\nmagazines--and also some of the worst, if I must report the whole\ntruth--and was permitted to mingle with the rest of the patients,\nguests, victims, personnel, and so forth that were attached to my ward.\n\nI was not at any time treated as though I were anything but a willing\nand happy member of their team. It was known that I was not, but if any\nemotion was shown, it was sympathy at my plight in not being one of\nthem. This was viewed in the same way as any other accident of birth or\nupbringing.\n\nIn my room was another man about my age. He'd arrived a day before me,\nwith an early infection at the tip of his middle toe. He was, if I've\ngot to produce a time-table, about three-eights of an inch ahead of me.\nHe had no worries. He was one of their kind of thinkers.\n\n\"How'd you connect?\" I asked him.\n\n\"I didn't,\" he said, scratching his infected toe vigorously. \"They\nconnected with me.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I was sleeping tight and not even dreaming. Someone rapped on my\napartment door and I growled myself out of bed and sort of felt my way.\nIt was three in the morning. Guy stood there looking apologetic. 'Got a\nmessage for you,' he tells me. 'Can't it wait until morning?' I snarl\nback. 'No,' he says. 'It's important!' So I invite him in. He doesn't\nwaste any time at all; his first act is to point at an iron floor lamp\nin the corner and ask me how much I'd paid for it. I tell him. Then this\nbird drops twice the amount on the coffee table, strides over to the\ncorner, picks up the lamp, and ties the iron pipe into a fancy-looking\nbowknot. He didn't even grunt. 'Mr. Mullaney,' he asks me, 'How would\nyou like to be that strong?' I didn't have to think it over. I told him\nright then and there. Then we spent from three ayem to five thirty going\nthrough a fast question and answer routine, sort of like a complicated\nword-association test. At six o'clock I've packed and I'm on my way here\nwith my case of Mekstrom's Disease.\"\n\n\"Just like that?\" I asked Mr. Mullaney.\n\n\"Just like that,\" he repeated.\n\n\"So now what happens?\"\n\n\"Oh, about tomorrow I'll go in for treatment,\" he said. \"Seems as how\nthey've got to start treatment before the infection creeps to the first\njoint or I'll lose the joint.\" He contemplated me a bit; he was a\nperceptive and I knew it. \"You've got another day or more. That's\nbecause your ring finger is longer than my toe.\"\n\n\"What's the treatment like?\" I asked him.\n\n\"That I don't know. I've tried to dig the treatment, but it's too far\naway from here. This is just a sort of preliminary ward; I gather that\nthey know when to start and so on.\" He veiled his eyes for a moment. He\nwas undoubtedly thinking of my fate. \"Chess?\" he asked, changing the\nsubject abruptly.\n\n\"Why not?\" I grinned.\n\nMy mind wasn't in it. He beat me three out of four. I bedded down about\neleven, and to my surprise I slept well. They must have been shoving\nsomething into me to make me sleep; I know me very well and I'm sure\nthat I couldn't have closed an eye if they hadn't been slipping me the\nold closeout powder. For three nights, now, I'd corked off solid until\nseven ack emma and I'd come alive in the morning fine, fit, and fresh.\n\nBut on the following morning, Mr. Mullaney was missing. I never saw him\nagain.\n\nAt noon, or thereabouts, the end of the ring finger on my left hand was\nas solid as a rock. I could squeeze it in a door or burn it with a\ncigarette; I got into a little habit of scratching kitchen matches on it\nas I tried to dig into the solid flesh with my perception. I growled a\nbit at my fate, but not much.\n\nIt was about this time, too, that the slight itch began to change. You\nknow how a deep-felt itch is. It can sometimes be pleasant. Like the\nitch that comes after a fast swim in the salty sea and a dry-out in the\nbright sun, when the drying salt water makes your skin itch with the\nvibrant pleasure of just being alive. This is not like the bite of any\nbug, but the kind that makes you want to take another dive into the\nocean instead of trying to scratch it with your claws. Well, the itch in\nmy finger had been one of the pleasant kinds. I could sort of scratch it\naway by taking the steel-hard part of my finger in my other hand and\nwiggle, briskly. But now the itch turned into a deep burning pain.\n\nMy perception, never good enough to dig the finer structure clearly, was\ngood enough to tell me that my crawling horror had come to the boundary\nline of the first joint.\n\nIt was this pause that was causing the burning pain.\n\nAccording to what I'd been told, if someone didn't do something about me\nright now, I'd lose the end joint of my finger.\n\nNobody came to ease my pain, nor to ease my mind. They left me strictly\nalone. I spent the time from noon until three o'clock examining my\nfingertip as I'd not examined it before. It was rock hard, but strangely\nflexible if I could exert enough pressure on the flesh. It still moved\nwith the flexing of my hands. The fingernail itself was like a chip of\nchilled steel. I could flex the nail neither with my other hand nor by\nbiting it; between my teeth it had the uncomfortable solidity of a sheet\nof metal that conveyed to my brain that the old teeth should not try to\nbite too hard. I tried prying on a bit of metal with the fingernail;\ninserting the nail in the crack where a metal cylinder had been formed\nto make a table leg. I might have been able to pry the crack wider, but\nthe rest of my body did not have the power nor the rigidity necessary to\ndrive the tiny lever that was my fingertip.\n\nI wondered what kind of tool-grinder they used for a manicure.\n\nAt three-thirty, the door to my room opened and in came Scholar Phelps,\ncomplete with his benign smile and his hearty air.\n\n\"Well,\" he boomed over-cheerfully, \"we meet again, Mr. Cornell.\"\n\n\"Under trying circumstances,\" I said.\n\n\"Unfortunately so,\" he nodded. \"However, we can't all be fortunate.\"\n\n\"I dislike being a vital statistic.\"\n\n\"So does everybody. Yet, from a philosophical point of view, you have no\nmore right to live at the expense of someone else than someone else has\na right to live at your expense. It all comes out even in the final\naccounting. And, of course, if every man were granted a guaranteed\nimmortality, we'd have one cluttered-up world.\"\n\nI had to admit that he was right, but I still could not accept his\nstatistical attitude. Not while I'm the statistic. He followed my\nthought even though he was esper; it wasn't hard to follow anyway.\n\n\"All right, I admit that this is no time to sit around discussing\nphilosophy or metaphysics or anything of that nature. What you are\ninterested in is you.\"\n\n\"How absolutely correct.\"\n\n\"You know, of course, that you are a carrier.\"\n\n\"So I've come to believe. At least, everybody I seem to have any contact\nwith either turns up missing or comes down with Mekstrom's--or both.\"\n\nScholar Phelps nodded. \"You might have gone on for quite some time if it\nhadn't been so obvious.\"\n\nI eyed him. \"Just what went on?\" I asked casually. \"Did you have a\nclean-up squad following me all the time, picking up the debris? Or did\nyou just pick up the ones you wanted? Or did the Highways make you\nindulge in a running competition?\"\n\n\"Too many questions at once. Most of which answers would be best that\nyou did not know. Best for us, that is. Maybe even for you.\"\n\nI shrugged. \"We seem to be bordering on philosophy again when the\nimportant point is what you intend to do to me.\"\n\nHe looked unhappy. \"Mr. Cornell, it is hard to remain unphilosophical in\na case like this. So many avenues of thought have been opened, so many\nideas and angles come to mind. We'll readily admit what you've probably\nconcluded; that you as a carrier have become the one basic factor that\nwe have been seeking for some twenty years and more. You are the\ndirigible force, the last brick in the building, the final answer. Or,\nand I hate to say it, were.\"\n\n\"Were?\"\n\n\"For all of our knowledge of Mekstrom's we know so very little,\" he\nsaid. \"In certain maladies the carrier is himself immune. In some we\nobserve that the carrier results from a low-level, incomplete infection\nwith the disease which immunizes him but does not kill the bugs. In\nothers, we've seen the carrier become normal after he has finally\ncontracted the disease. What we must know now is: Is Steve Cornell, the\nMekstrom Carrier, now a non-carrier because he has contracted the\ndisease?\"\n\n\"How are you going to find out?\" I asked him.\n\n\"That's a problem,\" he said thoughtfully. \"One school feels that we\nshould not treat you, since the treatment itself may destroy whatever\nunknown factor makes you a carrier. The other claims that if we don't\ntreat you, you'll hardly live long enough to permit comprehensive\nresearch anyway. A third school believes that there is time to find out\nwhether you are still a carrier, make some tests, and then treat you,\nafter which these tests are to be repeated.\"\n\nRather bitterly, I said, \"I suppose I have absolutely no vote.\"\n\n\"Hardly,\" his face was pragmatic.\n\n\"And to which school do you belong?\" I asked sourly. \"Do you want me to\nget the cure? Or am I to die miserably while you take tabs on my blood\npressure, or do I merely lose an arm while you're sitting with folded\nhands waiting for the laboratory report?\"\n\n\"In any case, we'll learn a lot about Mekstrom's from you,\" he said.\n\"Even if you die.\"\n\nAs caustically as I could, I said, \"It's nice to know that I am not\ngoing to die in vain.\"\n\nHe eyed me with contempt. \"You're not afraid to die, are you, Mr.\nCornell?\"\n\nThat's a dirty question to ask any man. Sure, I'm afraid to die. I just\ndon't like the idea of being not-alive. As bad as life is, it's better\nthan nothing. But the way he put the question he was implying that I\nshould be happy to die for the benefit of Humanity in general, and\nthat's a question that is unfairly loaded. After all, everybody is\nslated to kick off. There is no other way of resigning from the\nuniverse. So if I have to die, it might as well be for the Benefit of\nSomething, and if it happens to be Humanity, so much the better. But\nwhen the case is proffered on a silver tray, I feel, \"Somebody else, not\nme!\"\n\nThe next argument Phelps would be tossing out would be the one that\ngoes, \"Two thousand years ago, a Man died for Humanity--\" which always\nmakes me sick. No matter how you look at us, there is no resemblance\nbetween Him and me.\n\nI cut him short before he could say it: \"Whether or not I'm afraid to\ndie, and for good or evil, now or later, is beside the point. I have,\nobviously, nothing to say about the time, place, and the reasons.\"\n\nWe sat there and glared at one another; he didn't know whether to laugh\nor snarl and I didn't care which he did. It seemed to me that he was\nleading up to something that looked like the end. Then I'd get the\nstandard funeral and statements would be given out that I'd died because\nmedical research had not been able to save me and blah blah blah\ncomplete with lack of funds and The Medical Center charity drive. The\nresult would mean more moola for Phelps and higher efficiency for his\noperations, and to the devil with the rest of the world.\n\n\"Let's get along with it,\" I snapped. \"I've no opinion, no vote, no\nright of appeal. Why bother to ask me how I feel?\"\n\nCalmly he replied, \"Because I am not a rough-shod, unhuman monster, Mr.\nCornell. I would prefer that you see my point of view--or at least\nenough of it to admit that there is a bit of right on my side.\"\n\n\"Seems to me I went through that with Thorndyke.\"\n\n\"This is another angle. I'm speaking of my right of discovery.\"\n\n\"You're speaking of what?\"\n\n\"My right of discovery. You as an engineer should be familiar with the\nidea. If I were a poet I could write an ode to my love and no one would\nforbid me my right to give it to her and to nobody else. If I were a\ncook with a special recipe no one could demand that I hand it over\nunless I had a special friend. He who discovers something new should be\ngranted the right to control it. If this Mekstrom business were some\nsort of physical patent or some new process, I could apply for a patent\nand have it for my exclusive use for a period of seventeen years. Am I\nnot right?\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"Except that my patent would be infringed upon and I'd have no\ncontrol--\"\n\nI stood up suddenly and faced him angrily. He did not cower; after all\nhe was a Mekstrom. But he did shut up for a moment.\n\n\"Seems to me,\" I snarled, \"that any process that can be used to save\nhuman life should not be held secret, patentable, or under the control\nof any one man or group.\"\n\n\"This is an argument that always comes up. You may, of course, be\ncorrect. But happily for me, Mr. Cornell, I have the process and you\nhave not, and it is my own conviction that I have the right to use it on\nthose people who seem, in my opinion, to hold the most for the future\nadvancement of the human race. However, I do not care to go over this\nargument again, it is tiresome and it never ends. As one of the ancient\nGreek Philosophers observed, you cannot change a man's mind by arguing\nwith him. The other fact remains, however, that you do have something to\noffer us, despite your contrary mental processes.\"\n\n\"Do go on? What do I have to do to gain this benefit? Who do I have to\nkill?\" I eyed him cynically and then added, \"Or is it 'Whom shall I\nkill?' I like these things to be proper, you know.\"\n\n\"Don't be sarcastic. I'm serious,\" he told me.\n\n\"Then stop pussyfooting and come to the point,\" I snapped. \"You know\nwhat the story is. I don't. So if you think I'll be interested, why not\ntell me instead of letting me find out the hard way.\"\n\n\"You, of course, were a carrier. Maybe you still are. We can find out.\nIn fact, we'll have to find out, before we--\"\n\n\"For God's Sake stop it!\" I yelled. \"You're meandering.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" he said in a tone of apology that surprised me all the way down\nto my feet. He shook himself visibly and went on from there: \"You, if\nstill a carrier, can be of use to The Medical Center. Now do you\nunderstand?\"\n\nSure I understand, but good. As a normal human type, they held nothing\nover me and just shoved me here and there and picked up the victims\nafter me. But now that I was a victim myself, they could offer me their\n\"cure\" only if I would swear to go around the country deliberately\ninfecting the people they wanted among them. It was that--or lie there\nand die miserably. This had not come to Scholar Phelps as a sudden flash\nof genius. He'd been planning this all along; had been waiting to pop\nthis delicate question after I'd been pushed around, had a chance to\ntorture myself mentally, and was undoubtedly soft for anything that\nlooked like salvation.\n\n\"There is one awkward point,\" said Scholar Phelps suavely. \"Once we have\ncured you, we would have no hold on you other than your loyalty and your\npersonal honor to fulfill a promise given. Neither of us are naive, Mr.\nCornell. We both know that any honorable promise is only as valid as the\nbasic honor involved. Since your personal opinion is that this medical\ntreatment should be used indiscriminately, and that our program to\nbetter the human race by competitive selection is foreign to your\nfeelings, you would feel honor-bound to betray us. Am I not correct?\"\n\nWhat could I say to that? First I'm out, then I'm in, now I'm out again.\nWhat was Phelps getting at?\n\n\"If our positions were reversed, Mr. Cornell, I'm sure that you'd seek\nsome additional binding force against me. I shall continue to seek some\nsuch lever against you for the same reason. In the meantime, Mr.\nCornell, we shall make a test to see whether we have any real basis for\nany agreement at all. You may have ceased to be a carrier, you know.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I admitted darkly.\n\n\"In the meantime,\" he said cheerfully, \"the least we can do is to treat\nyour finger. I'd hate to have you hedge a deal because we did not\ndeliver your cured body in the whole.\"\n\nHe put his head out of the door and summoned a nurse who came with a\nblack bag. From the bag, Scholar Phelps took a skin-blast hypo and a\nsmall metal box, the top of which held a small slender, jointed platform\nand some tiny straps. He strapped my finger to this platform and then\nplugged in a length of line cord to the nearest wall socket. The little\nplatforms moved; the one nearest my wrist vibrated rapidly across a very\nsmall excursion that tickled like the devil. The end platform moved in\nan arc, flexing the finger tip from straight to about seventy degrees.\nThis moved fairly slow but regularly up and down.\n\n\"I'll not fool you,\" he said drily. \"This is going to hurt.\"\n\nHe set the skin-blast hypo on top of the joint and let it go. For a\nmoment the finger felt cold, numb, pleasant. Then the shock wore away\nand the tip of my finger, my whole finger and part of my hand shocked me\nwith the most excruciating agony that the hide of man ever felt. Flashes\nand waves of pain darted up my arm to the elbow and the muscles in my\nforearm jumped. The sensitive nerve in my elbow sang and sent darting\nwaves of zigzag needles up to my shoulder. My hand was a source of\nsearing heat and freezing cold and the pain of being crushed and twisted\nand wrenched out of joint all at the same time.\n\nPhelps wiped my wet face with a towel, loaded another hypo and let me\nhave it in the shoulder. Gradually the stuff took hold and the awful\npain began to subside. Not all the way, it just diminished from\nabsolutely unbearable to merely terrible.\n\nI knew at that moment why a trapped animal will bite off its own foreleg\nto get free of the trap.\n\nFrom the depths of his bag he found a bottle and poured a half-tumbler\nfor me; it went down like a whiskey-flavored soft drink. It had about as\nmuch kick as when you pour a drink of water into a highball glass that\nstill holds a dreg of melted ice and diluted liquor. But it burned like\nfury once it hit my stomach and my mind began to wobble. He'd given me a\nslug of the pure quill, one hundred proof.\n\nAs some sort of counter-irritant, it worked. Very gradually the awful\npain in my hand began to subside.\n\n\"You can take that manipulator off in an hour or so,\" he told me. \"And\nin the meantime we'll get along with our testing.\"\n\nI gathered that they could stop this treatment anywhere along the\nprocess if I did not measure up.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\nMidnight. The manipulator had been off my hand for several hours, and it\nwas obvious that my Mekstrom's was past the first joint and creeping up\ntowards the next. I eyed it with some distaste; as much as I wanted to\nhave a fine hard body, I was not too pleased at having agony for a\ncompanion every time the infection crossed a joint. I began to wonder\nabout the wrist; this is a nice complicated joint and should, if\npossible, exceed the pain of the first joint in the ring finger. I'd\nheard tell, of course, that once you've reached the top, additional\ntorture does not hurt any greater. I'd accepted this statement as it was\nprinted. But now I was not too sure that what I'd just been through was\nnot one of those exceptions that take place every now and then to the\nbest of rules.\n\nI was still in a dark and disconsolate mood. But I'd managed to eat, and\nI'd shaved and showered, and I'd hit the hay because it was as good a\nplace to be as anywhere else. I could lie there and dig the premises\nwith my esper.\n\nThere were very few patients in this building, and none were done up\nlike the character in the Macklin place. They moved the patients to some\nother part of the grounds when the cure started. There weren't very many\nnurses, doctors, scholars, or other personnel around, either.\n\nOutside along one side of a road was a small lighted house that was\nobviously a sort of guard, but it was casual instead of being formal and\nmilitary in appearance. The ground, instead of being patrolled by human\nguards (which might have caused some comment) was carefully laid off\ninto checkerboard squares by a complicated system of photobeams and\ninduction bridges.\n\nYou've probably read about how the job of casing a joint should be done.\nI did it the same way. I dug back and forth, collecting the layout from\nthe back door of my building towards the nearest puff of dead area. This\ncoign of safety billowed outward from the pattern towards the building\nlike an arm of cumulus cloud and the top of it rose like a column to a\nheight above my range. It sort of leaned forward but it did not lean far\nenough to be directly above the building. The far side of the column was\njust like the rear side; even though I'm well trained, it always\nstartles me when I perceive the far side of a smallish dead area. I'm\ninclined like everybody else to consider perception on a line-of-sight\nbasis instead of on a sort of all-around grasp.\n\nI let my thinker run free. If I could direct a breakout from this joint\nwith a lot of outside help, I'd have a hot jetcopter pilot come down the\ndead-area column with a dead engine. The Medical Center did not have any\nradar, probably on the proposition that too high a degree of security\nindicated a high degree of top-secret material to hide. So I'd come down\ndead engine, land, and wait it out. Timing would have to be perfect,\nbecause I, the prisoner, would have to make a fast gallop across a\ncouple of hundred yards of wide open psi area, scale a tall fence topped\nwith barbed wire, cross another fifty yards into the murk, and then find\nmy rescuer. The take off would be fast once I'd located the 'copter in\nthe murk, and everything would depend upon a hot pilot who felt\nconfident enough in his engine and his rotorjets to let 'em go with a\nroar and a lift without warmup.\n\nDuring which time, unfortunately for all plans, the people at The\nMedical Center would have been reading my mind and would probably have\nthat dead patch well patrolled with big, rough gentlemen armed with\nstuff heavy enough to stop a tank.\n\nLacking any sort of device or doodad that would conceal my mind from\nprying telepaths, about the only thing I could do was to lay here in my\nsoft bed and daydream of making my escape.\n\nEventually I went to sleep and dreamed that I was hunting Mallards with\na fly-rod baited with a stale doughnut. The only thing that bothered me\nwas a couple of odd-looking guys who thought that the way to hunt\nMallards was with shotguns, and their dress was just as out of taste as\ntheir equipment. Who ever hunted ducks from a canoe, dressed in\nwindbreakers and hightopped boots? Eventually they bought some ducks\nfrom me and went home, leaving me to my slumbers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout eight in the morning, there was a tentative tap on my door. While\nI was growling about why they should bother tapping, the door opened and\na woman came in with my breakfast tray. She was not my nurse; she was\nthe enamelled blonde receptionist.\n\nShe had lost some of her enamelled sophistication. It was not evident in\nher make-up, her dress, or her hair-do. These were perfection. In fact,\nshe bore that store-window look that made me think of an automaton,\ntriggered to make the right noises and to present the proper expression\nat the correct time. As though she had never had a thought of her own or\nan emotion that was above the level of very mild interest. As if the\nperfection of her dress and the characterless beauty of her face were\nmore important than anything else in her life.\n\nBut the loss of absolute plate-glass impersonality was gone, and it took\nme some several moments to dig it out of her appearance. Then I saw it.\nHer eyes. They no longer looked glassily out of that clear oval face at\na point about three inches above my left shoulder, but they were\ncentered on me from no matter what point in the room she'd be as she\nwent about the business of running open the blinds, checking the this\nand that and the other like any nurses' helper.\n\nFinally she placed my tray on the bed-table and stood looking down at\nme.\n\nFrom my first meeting with her I knew she was no telepath, so I bluntly\nsaid, \"Where's the regular girl? Where's my nurse?\"\n\n\"I'm taking over for the time,\" she told me. Her voice was strained;\nshe'd been trying to use that too-deeply cultured tone she used as the\nprofessional receptionist but the voice had cracked through the training\nenough to let some of her natural tone come through.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nThen she relaxed completely, or maybe it was a matter of coming unglued.\nHer face allowed itself to take on some character and her body ceased\nbeing that rigid window-dummy type. \"What's your trouble--?\" I asked her\nsoftly. She had something on her mind that was a bit too big for her,\nbut her training was not broad enough to allow her to get it out. I\nhoped to help, if I could. I also wanted to know what she was doing\nhere. If Scholar Phelps was thinking about putting a lever on me of the\nfemale type, he'd guessed wrong.\n\nShe was looking at me and I could see a fragment of fright in her face.\n\n\"Is it terrible?\" she asked me in a whisper.\n\n\"Is what terrible?\"\n\n\"Me--Me--Mekstrom's D--Disease--\" The last word came out with a couple\nof big tears oozing from closed lids.\n\n\"Why?\" I asked. \"Do I look all shot to bits?\"\n\nShe opened the eyes and looked at me. \"Does it hurt?\"\n\nI remembered the agony of my finger and tried to lie. \"A little,\" I told\nher. \"But I'm told that it was because I'd waited too long for my first\ntreatment.\" I hoped that I was correct; maybe it was wishful thinking,\nbut I claim that right. I didn't want to go through the same agony every\ntime we crossed a joint.\n\nI reached over to the bedside table and found my cigarettes. I slipped\ntwo up and offered one of them to her. She put a tentative hand forward,\nslowly, a scared-to-touch reluctance in her motion. This changed as her\nhand came forward. It was the same sort of reluctance that you feel when\nyou start out to visit the dentist for a roaring tooth. The closer you\nget to the dentist's office the less inclined you are to finish the job.\nThen at some indeterminate point you cross the place of no return and\nfrom that moment you go forward with increased determination.\n\nShe finally made the cigarette package but she was very careful not to\ntouch my hand as she took out the weed. Then, as if she'd reached that\npoint of no return, her hand slipped around the package and caught me by\nthe wrist.\n\nWe were statue-still for three heartbeats. Then I lifted my other hand,\ntook out the cigarette she'd missed, and held it forward for her. She\ntook it. I dropped the pack and let my hand slip back until we were\nholding hands, practically. She shuddered.\n\nI flipped my lighter and let her inhale a big puff before I put the next\nquestion: \"Why are you here and what goes on?\"\n\nIn a flat, dry voice she said, \"I'm--supposed--to--\" and let it trail\naway without finishing it.\n\n\"Guinea pig?\" I blurted bluntly.\n\nShe collapsed like a deflated balloon. Next, she had her face buried in\nmy shoulder, bawling like a hurt baby. I stroked her shoulder gently,\nbut she shuddered away from my hand as though it were poison.\n\nI shoved her upright and shook her a bit. \"Don't blubber like an idiot.\nSit there and talk like a human being!\"\n\nIt took her a minute of visible effort before she said, \"You're supposed\nto be a--carrier. I'm supposed to find out--whether you are--a carrier.\"\n\nWell, I'd suspected something of that sort.\n\nShakily she asked me, \"How do I get it, Mr. Cornell?\"\n\nI eyed her sympathetically.\n\nThen I held up my left hand and looked at the infection. This was the\nfinger that had been gummed to bits by the Mekstrom infant back in\nHomestead. With a shrug of uncertainty, I lifted her hand to my mouth. I\nfelt with my tongue and dug with my perception until I had a tiny fold\nof her skin between my front teeth. Then sharply, I bit down, drawing\nblood. She jerked, stiffened, closed her eyes and took a deep breath but\nshe did not cry out.\n\n\"That, if anything, should do it,\" I said flatly. \"Now go out and get\nsome iodine for the cut. Human-bite is likely to become infected with\nsomething bad. And I don't think antiseptic will hurt the Mekstrom\nInfection if it's taken place.\" They'd given me the antiseptic works in\nHomestead, I recalled. \"Now, Miss Nameless, you sit over there and tell\nme how come this distressing tableau?\"\n\n\"Oh--I can't,\" she cried. Then she left in a hurry sucking on her\nbleeding finger.\n\nI didn't need any explanation; I'd just wanted my suspicions confirmed.\nSomeone had a lever on her. Maybe someone she loved was a Mekstrom and\nher loyalty was extracted because of it. The chances were also high that\nshe'd been given to understand that they'd accept her as a member if she\never caught Mekstrom's; and they'd taken my arrival as a fine chance to\ncheck me and get her at the same time.\n\nI wondered about her; she was no big-brain. I couldn't quite see the\nstratified society outlined by Scholar Phelps as holding a position open\nfor her in the top echelon. Except she was a woman, attractive if you\nlike your women beautiful and dull-minded, and she probably would be\nhappy to live in a little vacuum-type world bounded on all sides with\nwomen's magazines, lace curtains, TV soap opera, and a corral full of\nlittle Mekstrom kids. I grinned. Funny how the proponents of the\nstratified society always have their comeuppance by the need of women\nwhose minds are bent on mundane things like homes and families.\n\nWell, I hoped she caught it, if that's what she wanted. I was willing to\nbet my life that she cared a lot more for being with her man than she\ndid for the cockeyed society he was supporting.\n\nI finished my breakfast and went out to watch a couple of telepaths\nplaying chess until lunch time and then gave up. Telepathic chess was\ntoo much like playing perceptive poker.\n\nThen after lunch came the afternoon full of laboratory tests,\ninspections, experiments, and so forth; they didn't do much that hadn't\nbeen tried at Homestead, and I surprised them again by being able to\nhelp in their never-ending blood counts and stuff of that sort.\n\nThey did not provide me with a new room mate, so I wandered around after\ndinner hoping that I could avoid both Thorndyke and Phelps. I didn't\nwant to get into another fool social-structure argument with them and\nthe affair of the little scared receptionist was more than likely to\nmake me say a few words that might well get me cast into the Outer\nDarkness for their mere semantic content.\n\nOnce more I hit the sack early.\n\nAnd, once more, there came a tap on my door about eight o'clock. It was\nnot a tentative little frightened tap this time, it was more jovial and\neager sounding. My reaction was about the same. Since it was their show\nand their property, I couldn't see any reason why they made this odd\nlip-service to politeness.\n\nIt was the receptionist again. She came in with a big wistful smile and\ndropped my tray on the bed table.\n\n\"Look,\" she cried. She held up her hand. The bleeding had stopped and\nthere was a thin film over the cut. I dug at it and nodded; it was the\nfirst show of Mekstrom Flesh without a doubt.\n\n\"That's it, kid.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said happily. \"Golly, I could kiss you.\"\n\nThen before I could think of all the various ways in which the word\n\"Golly\" sounded out of character for her, she launched herself into my\narms and was busily erasing every attempt at logical thought with one of\nthe warmest, no-holds-barred smoocheroo that I'd enjoyed for what seemed\nlike years. Since I'd held Catherine in my arms in her apartment just\nbefore we'd eloped, I'd spent my time in the company of Nurse Farrow who\nheld no emotional appeal to me, and the rest of my female company had\nbeen Mekstroms whose handholding might twist off a wrist if they got a\nthrill out of it. About the time I began to respond with enthusiasm and\nvigor, she extricated herself from my clutch and slid back to the foot\nof the bed out of reach.\n\nA little breathlessly she said, \"Harry will thank you for this.\" _This_\nmeant the infection in her finger.\n\nThen she was gone and I was thinking, _Harry should drop dead_!\n\nThen I grinned at myself like the Cheshire Cat because I realized that I\nwas so valuable a property that they couldn't afford to let me die. No\nmatter what, I'd be kept alive. And after having things go so sour for\nso long a time, things were about to take a fast turn and go my way.\n\nI discounted the baby-bite affair. Even if the baby were another\ncarrier, it would take a long time before the kid was old enough to be\ntrusted in his aim.\n\nI discounted it even more because I hadn't been roaring around the\ncountryside biting innocent citizens. Mere contact was enough; if the\nbite did anything, it may have hastened the process.\n\nSo here I was, a nice valuable property, with a will of my own. I could\neither throw in with Phelps and bite only Phelps' Chosen Aristocrats, or\nI could go back to the Highways and bite everybody in sight.\n\nI laughed at my image in the mirror. I am a democratic sort of soul, but\nwhen it comes to biting, there's some I'd rather bite than others.\n\nI bared my teeth at my image, but it was more of a leering smile of the\ntooth-paste ad than a fierce snarl.\n\nMy image looked pensive. It was thinking, _Steve, old carnivore, ere you\ngo biting anybody, you've first got to bite your way out of the Medical\nCenter._\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\nOne hour later they pulled my fangs without benefit of anaesthesia.\n\nThorndyke came in to inspect the progress of my infection and allowed as\nhow I'd be about ready for the full treatment in a few days. \"We like to\ndelay the full treatment as long as possible,\" he told me, \"because it\nimmobilizes the patient too long as it is.\" He pressed a call bell,\nwaited, and soon the door opened to admit a nurses' helper pushing a\ntrundle cart loaded with medical junk. I still don't know what was on\nthe cart because I was too flabbergasted to notice it.\n\nI was paying all my attention to Catherine, cheerful in her Gray Lady\nuniform, being utterly helpful, bright, gay, and relaxed. I was tongue\ntied, geflummoxed, beaten down, and--well, just speechless.\n\nCatherine was quite professional about her help. She loaded the\nskin-blast hypo and slapped it into Thorndyke's open hand. Her eyes\nlooked into mine and they smiled reassuringly. Her hand was firm as she\ntook my arm; she locked her strength on my hand and held it immobile\nwhile Thorndyke shot me in the second joint. There was a personal touch\nto her only briefly when she breathed, \"Steve, I'm so glad!\" and then\nwent on about her work. The irony of it escaped me; but later I did\nrecall the oddity of congratulating someone who's just contracted a\ndisease.\n\nThen that wave of agony hit me, and the only thing I can remember\nthrough it was Catherine folding a towel so that the hem would be on the\ninside when she wiped the beads of sweat from my face. She cradled my\nhead between her hands and crooned lightly to me until the depths of the\npain was past. Then she got efficient again and waved Thorndyke aside to\nsee to the little straps on the manipulator herself. She adjusted them\ndelicately. Then she poured me a glass of ice water and put it where I\ncould reach it with my other hand. She left after one long searching\nlook into my eyes, and I knew that she would be back later to talk to me\nalone. This seemed all right with Dr. Thorndyke, the wily telepath who\nwould be able to dig a reconstruction of our private talk with a little\nurging on his part.\n\nAfter Catherine was gone, Thorndyke smiled down at me with cynical\nself-confidence. \"There's your lever, Steve,\" he said.\n\nThe dope helped to kill all but the worst waves of searing pain; between\nthem I managed to grind out, \"How did you sell her that bill of goods,\nThorndyke?\"\n\nHis reply was scornful. \"Maybe she likes your hide all in one piece,\" he\ngrunted.\n\nHe left me with my mind a-whirl with thoughts and pain. The little\nmanipulator was working my second finger joint up and down rhythmically,\nand with each move came pain. It also exercised the old joint, which had\ngrown so rigid that my muscles hadn't been able to move it for several\nhours. That added agony, too.\n\nThe dope helped, but it also dimmed my ability to concentrate.\n\nUp to a certain point everything was quite logical and easy to\nunderstand. Catherine was here because they had contacted her through\nsome channel and said, \"Throw in with us and we'll see that your lover\ndoes not die miserably.\" So much was reasonable, but after that point\nthe whole thing began to take on a mad puzzle-like quality. Given normal\ncircumstances, Catherine would have come to me as swiftly as I'd have\ngone to her if I'd known how. Not only that, but I'd probably have sworn\neternal fealty to them for their service even though I could not stand\ntheir way of thinking.\n\nBut Catherine was smart enough to realize that I, as the only known\ncarrier of Mekstrom's Disease, was more valuable live than dead.\n\nWhy, then, had Catherine come here to place herself in their hands?\nAlone, she might have gone off half-cocked in an emotional tizzy. But\nthe Highways had good advisers who should have pointed out that Steve\nCornell was one man alive who could walk with impunity among friend or\nfoe. Why, they hadn't even tried to collect me until it became evident\nthat I was in line for the Old Treatment. Then they had to take me in,\nbecause the Medical Center wanted any information they could get above\nand beyond the fact that I was a carrier. If someone from Homestead had\nbeen in that courtroom, I'd now be among friends.\n\nThen the ugly thought hit me and my mind couldn't face it for some time.\n\n_Reorientation._\n\nCatherine's cheerful willingness to help them must be reorientation and\nnothing else.\n\nNow, although I've mentioned reorientation before, what I actually know\nabout it is meager. It makes Dr. Jekylls out of former Mr. Hydes and the\ntransformation is complete. It can be done swiftly; the rapidity depends\nupon the strength of the mind of the operator compared to the mind of\nthe subject. It is slightly harder to reorient a defiant mind than a\nwilling one. It sticks unless someone else begins to tinker again. It is\neasier to make a good man out of a bad one than the reverse, although\nthe latter is eminently possible. This is too difficult a problem to\ndiscuss to the satisfaction of everybody, but it seems to go along with\nthe old theory that \"Good\" does benefit the tribe of mankind in the long\nrun, while \"Bad\" things cause trouble. I'll say no more than to point\nout that no culture based upon theft, murder, piracy, and pillage, has\never survived.\n\nThe thought of Catherine's mind being tampered with made me seethe with\nanger. I forgot my pain and began to probe around wildly, and as I\nprobed I began to know the real feeling of helpless futility.\n\nFor here I was, practically immobilized and certainly dependent upon\nthem for help. This was no time to attempt a rescue of my\nsweetheart--who would only be taken away kicking and screaming all the\nway from here to the first place where I could find a haven and have her\nre-reoriented. The latter would not be hard; among the other things I\nknew about reorientation was that it could be negated by some strong\nemotional ties and a personal background that included worthy objection\nto the new personality.\n\nFor my perceptive digging I came up with nothing but those things that\nany hospital held. Patients, nurses, interns, orderlies; a couple of\ndoctors, a scholar presiding over a sheaf of files. And finally\nCatherine puttering over an autoclave. She was setting out a string of\ninstruments under the tutelage of a superintendent of nurses who was\nexplaining how the job should be done.\n\nI took a deep, thankful breath. Her mind was occupied enough to keep her\nfrom reading the dark thoughts that were going through mine. I did not\neven want a loved one to know how utterly helpless and angry I felt.\n\nAnd then, because I was preoccupied with Catherine and my own thoughts,\nthe door opened without my having taken a dig at the opener beforehand.\nThe arrival was all I needed to crack wide open in a howling fit of\nhysteria. It was so pat. I couldn't help but let myself go: \"Well! This\nlooks like Old Home Week!\"\n\nMiss Gloria Farrow, Registered Nurse, did not respond to my awkward\njoviality. Her face, if anything, was darker than my thoughts. I doubted\nthat she had her telepathy working; people who get that wound up find it\nhard to even see and hear straight, let alone think right. And telepathy\nor perception goes out of kilter first because the psi is a very\ndelicate factor.\n\nShe eyed me coldly. \"You utter imbecile,\" she snarled. \"You--\"\n\n\"Whoa, baby!\" I roared. \"Slow down. I'm a bit less than bright, but what\nhave I done now?\"\n\nI'd have slapped her across the face as an anodyne if she hadn't been\nMekstrom.\n\nFarrow cooled visibly, then her face sort of came apart and she sort of\nflopped forward onto the bed and buried her face in my shoulder. I\ncouldn't help but make comparisons; she was like a hunk of marble, warm\nand vibrant. Like having a statue crying on my shoulder. She sagged\nagainst me like a loose bag of cement and her hands clutched at my\nshoulder blades like a pair of C-clamps. A big juicy tear dropped from\nher cheek to land on my chest, and I was actually surprised to find that\na teardrop from a Mekstrom did not land like a drop of mercury. It just\nsplashed like any other drop of water, spread out, and made my chest\nwet.\n\nEventually I held her up from me, tried to shake her gently, and said,\n\"Now what's the shooting all about, Farrow?\"\n\nShe shook her head as if to clear her thinking gear.\n\n\"Steve,\" she said in a quietly serious tone, \"I've been such an utter\nfool.\"\n\n\"You're not unique, Farrow,\" I told her. \"People have been doing damfool\nstunts since--\"\n\n\"I know,\" she broke in. Then with an effort at light-heartedness, she\nadded, \"There must be a different version of that Garden of Eden story.\nEve is always blamed as having tempted Adam. Somewhere, Old Adam must\nhave been slightly to blame--?\"\n\nI didn't know what she was driving toward, but I stroked her hair and\nwaited. She was probably right. It still takes two of a kind to make one\npair.\n\n\"Steve--get out of here! While you're safe!\"\n\n\"Huh?\" I blurted. \"What cooks, Farrow?\"\n\n\"I was a nice patsy,\" she said. She sat up and wiped her eyes. \"I was a\nfool. Steve, if James Thorndyke had asked me to jump off the roof, I'd\nhave asked him 'what direction?' That's how fat-headed I am.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Something was beginning to form, now.\n\n\"I--led you on, Steve.\"\n\nThat blinkoed me. The phrase didn't jell. The half a minute she'd spent\nbawling on my shoulder with my arms around her had been the first\nphysical contact I'd ever had with Nurse Farrow. It didn't seem--\n\n\"No, Steve. Not that way. I couldn't see you for Thorndyke any more than\nyou could see me for Catherine.\" Her telepathy had returned, obviously;\nshe was in better control of herself. \"Steve,\" she said, \"I led you on;\ndid everything that Thorndyke told me to. You fell into it like a rock.\nOh--it was going to be a big thing. All I had to do was to haul you\ndeeper into this mess, then I'd disappear strangely. Then we'd\nbe--tog--ether--we'd be--\"\n\nShe started to come unglued again but stopped the dissolving process\njust before the wet and gooey stage set in. She seemed to put a set in\nher shoulders, and then she looked down at me with pity. \"Poor esper,\"\nshe said softly, \"you couldn't really know--\"\n\n\"Know what?\" I asked harshly.\n\n\"He fooled me--too,\" she said, in what sounded like a complete\nirrelevancy.\n\n\"Look, Farrow, try and make a bit of sense to a poor perceptive who\ncan't read a mind. Keep it running in one direction, please?\"\n\nAgain, as apparently irrelevant, she said, \"He's a top grade telepath;\nhe knows control--\"\n\n\"Control--?\" I asked blankly.\n\n\"You don't know,\" she said. \"But a good telepath can think in patterns\nthat prevent lesser telepaths from really digging deep. Thorndyke is\nbrilliant, of scholar grade, really. He--\"\n\n\"Let's get back to it, Farrow. What's cooking?\"\n\nSternly she tossed her head. It was an angry motion, one that showed her\ndisdain for her own tears and her own weakness. \"Your own sweet\nCatherine.\"\n\nI eyed her, not coldly but with a growing puzzlement. I tried to\nformulate my own idea but she went on, briskly, \"That accident of yours\nwas one of the luckiest things that ever happened to you, Steve.\"\n\n\"How long have I been known to be a Mekstrom Carrier?\" I asked bluntly.\n\n\"No more than three weeks before you met Catherine Lewis,\" she told me\nas bluntly. \"It took the Medical Center that long to work her into a\nposition to meet you, Steve.\"\n\nThat put the icing on the cake. If nothing else, it explained why\nCatherine was here willingly. I didn't really believe it because no one\ncan turn one hundred and eighty degrees without effort, but I couldn't\ndeny the fact that the evidence fits the claim. If what Farrow said were\ntrue, my marriage to Catherine would have provided them with the same\nlever as the little blonde receptionist. The pile-up must have really\nfouled up their plans.\n\n\"It did, Steve,\" said Farrow, who had been following my mental\nramblings. \"The Highways had to step in and help. This fouled things up\nfor both sides.\"\n\n\"Both sides?\" I asked, completely baffled.\n\nShe nodded. \"Until the accident, the Medical Center did not know that\nthe Highways existed. But when Catherine dropped completely out of\nsight, Thorndyke did a fine job of probing you. That's when he came upon\nthe scant evidence of the Highway Sign and the mental impression of the\nelder Harrison lifting the car so that Phillip could get you out. Then\nhe knew, and--\"\n\n\"Farrow,\" I snapped, \"there are a lot of holes in your story. For\ninstance--\"\n\nShe held up a hand to stop me. \"Steve,\" she said quietly, \"you know how\ndifficult it is for a non-telepath to find someone he can trust. But I'm\ntrying to convince you that--\"\n\nI stopped Farrow this time. \"How can I believe you now?\" I asked her\npointedly. \"You seem to have a part in this side of the quiet warfare.\"\n\nNurse Farrow made a wry face as though she'd just discovered that the\nstuff she had in her mouth was a ball of wooly centipedes. \"I'm a\nwoman,\" she said simply. \"I'm soft and gullible and easily talked into\ncomplacency. But I've just learned that their willingness to accept\nwomen is based upon the fact that no culture can thrive without women to\npropagate the race. I find that I am--\" She paused, swallowed, and her\nvoice became strained with bitterness, \"--useful as a breeding animal.\nJust one of the peasants whose glory lies in carrying their heirs. But I\ntell you, Steve--\" and here she became strong and her voice rang out\nwith a vigorous rejection of her future, \"I'll be forever damned if I\nwill let my child be raised with the cockeyed notion that he has some\nGod-Granted Right to Rule.\"\n\nMy vigilant sense of perception had detected a change in the\nhuman-pattern in the building. People were moving--no, it was one person\nwho was moving.\n\nDown in the laboratory below, and at the other end of the building,\nCatherine was still working over the autoclave and instruments. The\nwaspish-looking superintendent had taken off for somewhere else, and\nwhile Catherine was alone now, she was about to be joined by Dr.\nThorndyke. Half afraid that my perception of them would touch off their\nown telepathic sense of danger, I watched deliberately.\n\nThe door opened and Thorndyke came in; Catherine turned from her work\nand said something, which of course I could not possibly catch.\n\n#What are they saying, Farrow?# I snapped mentally.\n\n\"I don't know. They're too far for my range.\"\n\nI swore, but I didn't really have to have a dialog script. Nor did they\ndo the obvious; what they did was far more telling.\n\nCatherine turned and patted his cheek. They laughed at one another, and\nthen Catherine began handing Thorndyke the instruments out of the\nautoclave, which he proceeded to mix in an unholy mess in the surgical\ntray. Catherine saw what he was doing and made some remark; then\nthreatened him with a pair of haemostats big enough to clamp off a\nthree-inch fire hose. It was pleasant enough looking horseplay; the sort\nof intimacy that people have when they've been together for a long time.\nThorndyke did not look at all frightened of the haemostats, and\nCatherine did not really look as though she'd follow through with her\nthreat. They finally tangled in a wrestle for the instrument, and\nThorndyke took it away from her. They leaned against a cabinet side by\nside, their elbows touching, and went on talking as if they had\nsomething important to discuss in the midst of their fun. It could have\nbeen reorientation or it could have been Catherine's real self. I still\ncouldn't quite believe that she had played me false. My mind spinned\nfrom one side to the other until I came up with a blunt question that\ncame to my lips without any mental planning. I snapped, \"Farrow, what\ngrade of telepath is Catherine?\"\n\n\"Doctor grade,\" she replied flatly. \"Might have taken some pre-scholar\ntraining if economics hadn't interfered. I'd not really call her Rhine\nScholar material, but I'm prejudiced against her.\"\n\nIf what Farrow said was true, Catherine was telepath enough to control\nand marshall her mind to a faretheewell. She could think and plan to\nherself in the presence of another telepath without giving her plots\naway.\n\nShe was certainly smart enough to lead one half-trained perceptive\naround by a ring in my nose. Me? I was as big a fool as Farrow.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\n\nNurse Farrow caught my hand. \"Steve,\" she snapped out in a rapid, flat\nvoice, \"Think only one thought. Think of how Catherine is here; that she\ncame here to protect your life and your future!\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Think it!\" she almost cried. \"She's coming!\"\n\nI nearly fumbled it. Then I caught on. Catherine was coming; to remove\nthe little finger manipulator and to have a chit-chat with me. I didn't\nwant to see her, and I was beginning to wish--then I remembered that one\nglimmer out of me that I knew the truth and everything would be higher\nthan Orbital Station One.\n\nI shoved my mind into low gear and started to think idle thoughts,\nletting myself sort of daydream. I was convincing to myself; it's hard\nto explain exactly, but I was play-thinking like a dramatist. I fell\ninto it; it seemed almost truth to me as I roamed on and on. I'd been\ntrapped and Catherine had come here to hand herself over as a hostage\nagainst my good behavior. She'd escaped the Highways bunch or maybe she\njust left them quietly. Somehow Phelps had seen to it that Catherine got\nword--I didn't know how, but that was not important. The important thing\nwas Catherine being here as a means of keeping me alive and well.\n\nI went on thinking the lie. Catherine came in shortly and saw what Nurse\nFarrow was doing.\n\n\"I was supposed to do that,\" said Catherine.\n\nNurse Farrow straightened up from her work of loosening the straps on\nthe manipulator. \"Sorry,\" she said in a cool, crisp voice. \"I didn't\nknow that. This is usually my job. It's a rather delicate proposition,\nyou know.\" There was a chill of professional rebuff in Farrow's voice.\nIt was the pert white hat and the gold pin looking down upon the gray\nuniform with no adornment. Catherine looked a bit uncomfortable but she\napparently had to take it.\n\nCatherine tried lamely, \"You see, Mr. Cornell is my fianc\u00e9e.\"\n\nFarrow jumped on that one hard. \"I'm aware of that. So let's not forget\nthat scholars of medicine do not treat their own loved ones for ethical\nreasons.\"\n\nCatherine took it like a slap across the face with an iced towel. \"I'm\nsure that Dr. Thorndyke would not have let me take care of him if I'd\nnot been capable,\" she replied.\n\n\"Perhaps Dr. Thorndyke did not realize at the time that Mr. Cornell\nwould be ready for the Treatment Department. Or,\" she added slyly, \"have\nyou been trained to prepare a patient for the full treatment?\"\n\n\"The full treatment--? Dr. Thorndyke did not seem to think--\"\n\n\"Please,\" said Farrow with that cold crispness coming out hard, \"As a\nnurse I must keep my own opinion to myself, as well as keeping the\nopinions of doctors to myself. I take orders only and I perform them.\"\n\nThat was a sharp shot; practically telling Catherine that she, as a\nnurses' helper, had even less right to go shooting off her mouth.\nCatherine started to reply but gave it up. Instead she came over and\nlooked down at me. She cooed and stroked my forehead.\n\n\"Ah, Steve,\" she breathed, \"So you're going for the treatment. Think of\nme, Steve. Don't let it hurt too much.\"\n\nI smiled thinly and looked up into her eyes. They were soft and warm, a\nbit moist. Her lips were full and red and they were parted slightly; the\nlower lip glistened slightly in the light. These were lips I'd kissed\nand found sweet; a face I'd held between my hands. Her hair fluffed\nforward a trifle; threatened to cascade down over her shoulders. No, it\nwas not at all hard to lie there and go on thinking all the soft-sweet\nthoughts I'd once hoped might come true--\n\nShe recoiled, her face changing swiftly from its mask of sweet concern\nto one of hard calculation. I'd slipped with that last hunk of thinking\nand given the whole affair away.\n\nCatherine straightened up and turned to head for the door. She took one\nstep and caved in like a wet towel.\n\nOver her still-falling body I saw Nurse Farrow calmly reloading the\nskin-blast hypo, which she used to fire a second load into the base of\nCatherine's neck, just below the shoulder blades.\n\n\"That,\" said Farrow succinctly, \"should keep her cold for a week. I just\nwish I'd been born with enough guts to commit murder.\"\n\n\"What--?\"\n\n\"Get dressed,\" she snapped. \"It's cold outside, remember?\" I started to\ndress as Farrow hurled my clothing out of the closet at me. She went on\nin the meantime: \"I knew you couldn't keep it entirely concealed from\nher. She's too good a telepath. So while you were holding her attention,\nI let her have a shot in the neck. One of the rather bad things about\nbeing a Mekstrom is that minor items like the hypo don't register too\nwell.\"\n\nI stopped. \"Isn't that bad? Seems to me that I've heard that pain is a\nnecessary factor for the preservation of the--\"\n\n\"Stop yapping and dress,\" snapped Farrow. \"Pain is useful when it's\nneeded. It isn't needed in the case of a pin pricking the hide of a\nMekstrom. When a Mekstrom gets in the way of something big enough to\ndamage him physically, then it hurts him.\"\n\n\"Sort of when a locomotive falls on their head?\" I grunted.\n\n\"Keep on dressing. We're not out of this jungle yet.\"\n\n\"So have you any plans?\"\n\nShe nodded soberly. \"Yes, Steve. Once you asked me to be your telepath,\nto complete your team. I let you down. Now I've picked you up again, and\nfrom here on--out--I--\"\n\nI nodded. \"Sold,\" I told her.\n\n\"Good. Now, Steve, dig the hallway.\"\n\nI did. There was no one there. I opened my mouth to tell her so, and\nthen closed it foolishly.\n\n\"Dig the hallway down to the left. Farther. To the door down\nthere--three beyond the one you're perceiving now--is there a wheelchair\nthere?\"\n\n\"Wheelchair?\" I blurted.\n\n\"Steve, this is a hospital. They don't even let a man with an aching\ntooth walk to the toothache ward. He rides. Now, you keep a good esper\nwatch on the hall and if anybody looks out while I'm gone, just cast a\ndeep dig at their face. It's possible that at this close range I can\nidentify them from the perceived image in your mind. Although, God\nknows, no two people ever _see_ anything alike, let alone perceive it.\"\n\nShe slipped out, leaving me with the recumbent form of my former\nsweetheart. Her face had fallen into the relaxed expression of sleep,\nsort of slack and unbuttoned.\n\n#Tough, baby,# I thought as I closed my eyes so that all my energy could\nbe aimed at the use of my perception.\n\nFarrow was going down the hall like a professional heading for the\nwheelchair on a strict order. No one bothered to look out; she reached\nthe locker room and dusted the wheelchair just as if she'd been getting\nit for a real patient. (The throb in my finger returned for a parthian\nshot and I remembered that I _was_ a real patient!) She trundled the\nchair back and into my room.\n\n\"In,\" she said. \"And keep that perception aimed on the hallway, the\nelevator, and the center corridor stairs.\"\n\nShe packed me with a blanket, tucking it so that my shoes and\noverclothing would not show, doing the job briskly. Then she scooped\nCatherine up from the floor and dropped her into my bed, and then rolled\nCatherine into one of those hospital doodads that hospitals use for male\nand female alike as bedclothing.\n\n\"Anyone taking a fast dig in here will think she's a patient--unless the\ndigger knows that this room is supposed to be occupied by one Steve\nCornell, obviously male. Now, Steve, ready to steer?\"\n\n\"Steer?\"\n\n\"Steer by esper. I'll drive. Oh--I know the way,\" she told me with a\nchuckle. \"You just keep your perception peeled for characters who might\nbe over-nosy. I'll handle the rest.\"\n\nWe went along the hallway. I took fast digs at the rooms and hall ahead\nof us; the whole coast seemed clear. Waiting for the two-bit elevator\nwas nerve wracking; hospitals always have such poky elevators. But\neventually it came and we trundled aboard. The pilot was no big-dome. He\nsmiled at Nurse Farrow and nodded genially at me. He was probably a\nblank, jockeying an elevator is about the top job for a non-psi these\ndays.\n\nBut as the elevator started down, a doctor came out of one of the rooms\non the floor below. He took a fast look at the indicator above the\nelevator door and made a dash to thumb the button. The elevator came to\na grinding halt and he got on.\n\nThis bothered me, but Farrow merely simpered at the guy and melted him\ndown to size. She made some remark to him that I couldn't hear, but from\nthe sudden increase of his pulse rate, I gathered that she'd really put\nhim off guard. He replied in the same unintelligible tone and reached\nfor her hand. She held his hand, and if the guy was thinking of me, my\nname is Sing Hoy Low and I am a Chinese Policeman.\n\nHe held her hand until we hit the first floor, and he debarked with a\ncalf-like glance at Nurse Farrow. We went on to the ground floor and\ndown the lower corridor to the end, where Farrow spent another lifetime\nand a half filling out a white cardboard form.\n\nThe superintendent eyed me with a sniff. \"I'll call the car,\" she said.\n\nI half-expected Farrow to make some objection, but she quietly nodded\nand we waited for another lifetime until a big car whined to a stop\noutside. Two big guys in white coats came in, tripped the lever on back\nof the wheelchair and stretched me out flat and low-slung on the same\nwheels. It was a neat conversion from wheelchair to wheeled stretcher,\nbut as Farrow trundled me out feet first into the cold, I felt a sort of\nnervous chill somewhere south of my navel. She swung me around at the\nlast minute and I was shoved head first into the back of the car.\n\nCar? This was a full-fledged ambulance, about as long as a city block\nand as heavy as a battleship. It was completely fitted for everything\nthat anybody could think of, including a great big muscular\nturbo-electric power plant capable of putting many miles per behind the\ntail-pipe.\n\nThe door closed on my feet, and we took off with Farrow sitting right\nbehind the two big hospital attendants, one of whom was driving and the\nother of whom was ogling Farrow in a calculating manner. She invited the\nogle. Heck, she did it in such a way that I couldn't help ogling a bit\nmyself. If I haven't said that Farrow was an attractive woman, it was\nbecause I hadn't really paid attention to her looks. But now I went\nalong and ogled, realizing in the dimmer and more obscure recesses of my\nmind that if I ogled in a loudly lewd perceptive manner, I'd not be\nthinking of what she was doing.\n\nSo while I was pleasantly occupied in ogling, Farrow slipped two more\nhypos out from under her clothing. She slipped her hands out sidewise on\nthe backs of their seats, put her face between them and said, \"Anybody\ngot a cigarette, fellows?\"\n\nThe next that took place happened, in order of occurrence, as follows:\n\nThe driver grunted and turned his head to look at her. The other guy\nfumbled for a cigarette. Driver poked at the lighter on the dash, still\ndividing his attention between the road and Nurse Farrow. The man beside\nhim reached for the lighter when it popped out and he held it for her\nwhile she puffed it into action. Farrow fingered the triggers on the\nskin-blast hypos. The man beside the driver replaced the lighter in its\nsocket on the dash. The driver slid aside and to the floor, a second\nbefore the other hospital orderly flopped down like a deflated balloon.\n\nThe ambulance took a swoop to the right, nosed down into a shallow ditch\nand leaped like a shot deer out on the other side.\n\nFarrow went over the back of the seat in a flurry and I rolled off of my\nstretcher into the angle of the floor and the sidewall. There was a\nrumble and then a series of crashes before we came to a shuddering halt.\nI came up from beneath a pile of assorted medical supplies, braced\nmyself against the canted deck, and looked out the wind-shield. The\ntrunk of a tree split the field of view as close to dead center as it\ncould be.\n\n\"Out, Steve,\" said Farrow, untangling herself from the steering wheel\nand the two attendants. \"Out!\"\n\n\"What next?\" I asked her.\n\n\"We've made enough racket to wake the statue of Lincoln. Out and run for\nit.\"\n\n\"Which way?\"\n\n\"Follow me!\" she snapped, and took off. Even in nurse's shoes with those\nsemi-heels, Farrow made time in a phenomenal way. I lost ground\nsteadily. Luckily it was still early in the afternoon, so I used my\nperception to keep track of her once she got out of sight. She was\nfollowing the gently rolling ground, keeping to the lower hollows and\ngradually heading toward a group of buildings off in the near-distance.\n\nI caught up with her just as we hit a tiny patch of dead area; just\ninside the area she stopped and we flopped on the ground and panted our\nlungs full of nice biting cold air. Then she pointed at the collection\nof buildings and said, \"Steve, take a few steps out of this deadness and\ntake a fast dig. Look for cars.\"\n\nI nodded; in a few steps I could send my esper forward to dig the fact\nthat there were several cars parked in a row near one of the buildings.\nI wasted no time in digging any deeper, I just retreated into the dead\narea and told her what I'd seen.\n\n\"Take another dig, Steve. Take a dig for ignition keys. We've got to\nsteal.\"\n\n\"I don't mind stealing.\" I took another trip into the open section and\ngandered at ignition locks. I tried to memorize the ones with keys\nhanging in the locks but failed to remember all of them.\n\n\"Okay, Steve. This is where we walk in boldly and walk up to a couple of\ncars and get in and drive off.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but why--\"\n\n\"That's the only way we'll ever get out of here,\" she told me firmly.\n\nI shrugged. Farrow knew more about the Medical Center than I did. If\nthat's the way she figured it, that's the way it had to be. We broke out\nof the dead area, and as we came into the open, Farrow linked her arm in\nmine and hugged it.\n\n\"Make like a couple of fatuous mushbirds,\" she chuckled. \"We've been out\nwalking and communing with nature and getting acquainted.\"\n\n\"Isn't the fact that you're Mekstrom and I'm human likely to cause some\nrather pointed comment?\"\n\n\"It would if we were to stick around to hear it,\" she said. \"And if they\ntry to read our minds, all we have to do is to think nice mushy\nthoughts. Face it,\" she said quietly, \"it won't be hard.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"You're a rather nice guy, Steve. You're fast on the uptake, you're\ngenerally pleasant. You've got an awful lot of grit, guts and\ndetermination, Steve. You're no pinup boy, Steve, but--and this may come\nas a shock to you--women don't put one-tenth the stock in pulchritude\nthat men do? You--\"\n\n\"Hey. Whoa,\" I bubbled. \"Slow down, before you--\"\n\nShe hugged my arm again. \"Steve,\" she said seriously, \"I'm not in love\nwith you. It's not possible for a woman to be in love with a man who\ndoes not return that love. You don't love me. But you can't help but\nadmit that I am an attractive woman, Steve, and perhaps under other\ncircumstances you'd take on a large load of that old feeling. I'll admit\nthat the reverse could easily take place. Now, let's forget all the odd\nangles and start thinking like a pair of people for whom the time, the\nplace, and the opposite sex all turned up opportunely.\"\n\nI couldn't help thinking of Nurse Farrow as--Nurse Farrow. The name\nGloria did not quite come out. I tried to submerge this mental attitude,\nand so I looked down at her with what I hoped to resemble the expression\nof a love-struck male. I think it was closer to the expression of a\nwould-be little-theatre actor expressing lust, and not quite making the\ngrade. Farrow giggled.\n\nBut as I sort of leered down at her, I had to admit upon proper\nexamination of her charm that Nurse Farrow could very easily become\nGloria, if as she said, we had the time to let the change occur. Another\nidea formed in my mind: If Farrow had been kicked in the emotions by\nThorndyke, I'd equally been pushed in the face by Catherine. That made\nus sort of kindred souls, as they used to call it in the early books of\nthe Twentieth Century.\n\nGloria Farrow chuckled. \"Unlike the old torch-carriers of that day,\" she\nsaid, \"we rebound a bit too fast.\"\n\nThen she let my arm go and took my hand. We went swinging across the\nfield in a sort of happy comradeship; it must have looked as though we\nwere long-term friends. She was a good egg, hurt and beaten down and\nshoved off by Thorndyke, but she had a lot of the good old bounce. Of a\nsudden impulse I wanted to kiss her.\n\n\"Go ahead, Steve,\" she said. \"But it'll be for the probable onlookers.\nI'm Mekstrom, you know.\"\n\nSo I didn't try. I just put an arm around her briefly and realized that\nany attempt at affection would be like trying to strike sparks off flint\nwith a hunk of flannel.\n\nWe walked hand in hand towards the buildings, strolled up saucily\ntowards two of the parked cars, made the sort of wave that lovers give\none another in goodbye when they don't really want to demonstrate their\naffection before ten thousand people and stepped into two cars and took\noff.\n\nGloria Farrow was in the lead.\n\nWe went howling down the road, Farrow in the lead car by a hundred feet\nand me behind her. We went roaring around a curve, over a hill, and I\nhad my perception out to its range, which was far ahead of her car. The\nmain gate came into range, and we bore down upon that wire and steel\nportal like a pair of madmen.\n\nGloria Farrow plowed into the gate without letting up. The gate went\nwhirling in pieces, glass flew and tires howled and bits of metal and\nplastic sang through the air. Her car weaved aside; I forgot the road\nahead and put my perception into her car.\n\nFarrow was fighting the wheel like a racing driver in a spin. Her hands\nwrenched the wheel with the swift strength of the Mekstrom Flesh she\nwore, and the wheel bent under her hands. Over and around she went, with\na tire blown and the lower rail of the big gate hanging onto the fender\nlike a dry-land sea-anchor. She juggled the wheel and made a snaky path\noff to one side of the road.\n\nOut of the guardhouse came a uniformed man with a riot gun. He did not\nhave time to raise it. Farrow ironed out her course and aimed the\ncareening car dead center. She mowed the guard down and a\nhalf-thousandth of a second later she plowed into the guardhouse. The\nstructure erupted like a box of stove-matches hit with a heavy-caliber\nsoft-nosed slug, like a house of cards and an air-jet. There was a roar\nand a small gout of flame and then out of the flying wreckage on the far\nside came Farrow and her stolen car. Out of the mess of brimstone and\nshingles she came, turning end for end in a crazy, metal-crushing twist\nand spin. She ground to a broken halt before the last of the debris\nlanded, and then everything was silent.\n\nAnd then for the first and only time in my life I felt the penetrant,\nforceful impact of an incoming thought; a mental contact from another\nmind:\n\n#Steve!# it screamed in my mind, #Get out! Get going! It's your move\nnow----#\n\nI put my foot on the faucet and poured on the oil.\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\nMy car leaped forward and I headed along the outside road towards the\nnearby highway. Through the busted gate I roared, past the downed guard\nand the smashed guardhouse, past the wreck of Farrow's car.\n\nBut Nurse Farrow was not finished with this gambit yet. As I drew even\nwith her, she pried herself out of the messy tangle and came across the\nfield in a dead run--and how that girl could run! As fast as I was\ngoing, she caught up; as fast as it all happened I had too little time\nto slow me down before Nurse Farrow closed the intervening distance from\nher wreck to my car and had hooked her arm in through one open window.\n\nMy car lurched with the impact, but I fought the wheel straight again\nand Farrow snapped, \"Keep going, Steve!\"\n\nI kept going; Farrow snaked herself inside and flopped into the seat\nbeside me. \"Now,\" she said, patting the dashboard of our car, \"It's up\nto the both of us now! Don't talk, Steve. Just drive like crazy!\"\n\n\"Where--?\"\n\nShe laughed a weak little chuckle. \"Anywhere--so long as it's a long,\nlong way from here.\"\n\nI nodded and settled down to some fancy mile-getting. Farrow relaxed in\nthe seat, opened the glove compartment and took out a first aid kit. It\nwas only then I noticed that she was banged up quite a bit for a\nMekstrom. I'd not been too surprised when she emerged from the wreck;\nI'd become used to the idea of the indestructibility of the Mekstrom. I\nwas a bit surprised at her being banged up; I'd become so used to their\ndamage-proof hide that the idea of minor cuts, scars, mars, and\nabrasions hadn't occurred to me. Yes, that wreck would have mangled a\nnormal man into an unrecognizable mess of hamburger. Yet I'd expected a\nMekstrom to come through it unscathed.\n\nOn the other hand, the damage to Farrow's body was really minor. She\nbled from a long gash on her thigh, from a wound on her right arm, and\nfrom a myriad of little cuts on her face, neck, and shoulders.\n\nSo as I drove crazy-fast away from the Medical Center Nurse Farrow\nrelaxed in the seat and applied adhesive tape, compresses, and closed\nthe gashes with a batch of little skin clips in lieu of sutures. Then\nshe lit two cigarettes and handed one of them to me. \"Okay now, Steve,\"\nshe said easily. \"Let's drive a little less crazily.\"\n\nI pulled the car down to a flat hundred and felt the strain go out of\nme.\n\n\"As I remember, there's one of the Highways not far from here--\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"No, Steve. We don't want the Highways in Hiding,\neither.\"\n\nAt a mere hundred per I could let my esper do the road-sighting, so I\nlooked over at her. She was half-smiling, but beneath the little smile\nwas a firm look of self-confidence. \"No,\" she said quietly, \"We don't\nwant the Highways. If we go there, Phelps and his outfit will turn\nheaven and earth to break it up, now that you've become so important.\nYou forget that the Medical Center is still being run to look legal and\naboveboard; while the Highways are still in Hiding. Phelps could make\nquite a bitter case out of their reluctance to come out into the open.\"\n\n\"Well, where do we go?\" I asked.\n\n\"West,\" she said simply. \"West, into New Mexico. To my home.\"\n\nThis sort of startled me. Somehow I'd not connected Farrow with any\npermanent home; as a nurse and later as one of the Medical Center, I'd\ncome to think of her as having no permanent home of her own. Yet like\nthe rest of us, Nurse Farrow had been brought up in a home with a mother\nand a father and probably some sisters and brothers. Mine were dead and\nthe original home disbanded, but there was no reason why I should think\nof everybody else in the same terms. After all, Catherine had had a\nmother and a father who'd come to see me after her disappearance.\n\nSo we went West, across Southern Illinois and over the big bridge at St.\nLouis into Missouri and across Missouri and West, West, West. We parked\nnights in small motels and took turns sleeping with one of us always\nawake and alert with esper and telepath senses geared high for the first\nsight of any threat. We gave the Highways we came upon a wide berth; at\nno time did we come close to any of their way stations. It made our path\ncrooked and much longer than it might have been if we'd strung a line\nand gone. But eventually we ended up in a small town in New Mexico and\nat a small ranch house on the edge of the town.\n\nIt is nice to have parents; I missed my own deeply when I was reminded\nof the sweet wonder of having people just plain glad to see their\nchildren again, no matter what they'd done under any circumstances. Even\nbringing a semi-invalid into their homes for an extended course of\ntreatment.\n\nJohn Farrow was a tall man with gray at the temples and a pair of sharp\nblue eyes that missed nothing. He was a fair perceptive who might have\nbeen quite proficient if he had taken the full psi course at some\nuniversity. Mrs. Farrow was the kind of elderly woman that any man would\nlike to have for a mother. She was sweet and gentle but there was\nneither foolish softness or fatuous nonsense about her. She was a\ntelepath and she knew her way around and let people know that she knew\nwhat the score was. Farrow had a brother, James, who was not at home; he\nlived in town with his wife but came out to the old homestead about once\nevery week on some errand or other.\n\nThey took me in as though I'd come home with their daughter for\nsentimental reasons; Gloria sat with us in their living room and went\nthrough the whole story, interrupted now and then by a remark aimed at\nme. They inspected my hand and agreed that something must be done. They\nwere extremely interested in the Mekstrom problem and were amazed at\ntheir daughter's feats of strength and endurance.\n\nMy hand, by this time, was beginning to throb again. The infection was\nheading on a fine start down the pinky and middle fingers; the ring\nfinger was approaching the second joint to that point where the advance\nstopped long enough for the infection to become complete before it\ncrossed the joint. The first waves of that particular pain were coming\nat intervals and I knew that within a few hours the pain would become\nwaves of agony so deep that I would not be able to stand it.\n\nUltimately, Farrow got her brother James to come out from town with his\ntools, and between us all we rigged up a small manipulator for my hand.\nFarrow performed the medical operations from the kit in the back of her\ncar we'd stolen from the Medical Center.\n\nThen after they'd put my hand through the next phase, Nurse Farrow\nlooked me over and gave the opinion that it was now approaching the time\nfor me to get the rest of the full treatment.\n\nOne evening I went to bed, to be in bed for four solid months.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI'd like to be able to give a blow by blow description of those four\nsolid months. Unfortunately, I was under dope so much of the time that I\nknow little about it. It was not pleasant. My arm laid like a log from\nthe Petrified Forest, strapped into the machine that moved the joints\nwith regular motion, and with each motion starting a dart of fire and\nmangling pain up to the shoulder. Needles entered the veins at the elbow\nand the armpit, and from bottles suspended almost to the ceiling to\nprovide a pressurehead, plasma and blood-sustenance was trickled in to\nkeep the arm alive.\n\nDimly I recall having the other arm strapped down and the waves of pain\nthat blasted at me from both sides. The only way I kept from going out\nof my mind with the pain was living from hypo to hypo and waiting for\nthe blessed blackness that wiped out the agony; only to come out of it\nhours later with my infection advanced to another point of pain. When\nthe infection reached my right shoulder, it stopped for a long time; the\ninfection rose up my left arm and also stopped at the shoulder. I came\nout of the dope to find James and his father fitting one of the\nmanipulators to my right leg and through that I could feel the darting\npains in my calf and thigh.\n\nAt those few times when my mind was clear enough to let me use my\nperception, I dug the room and found that I was lying in a veritable\nforest of bottles and rubber tubes and a swathe of bandages.\n\nUtterly helpless, I vaguely knew that I was being cared for in every\nway. The periods of clarity were fewer, now, and shorter when they came.\nI awoke once to find my throat paralyzed, and again to find that my jaw,\ntongue, and lower face was a solid pincushion of darting needles of\nfire. Later, my ears reported not a sound, and even later still I awoke\nto find myself strapped into a portable resuscitator that moved my chest\nup and down with an inexorable force.\n\nThat's about all I know of it. When the smoke cleared away completely\nand the veil across my eyes was gone, it was Spring outside and I was a\nMekstrom.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI sat up in bed.\n\nIt was morning, the sun was streaming in the window brightly and the\nfresh morning air of Spring stirred the curtains gently. It was quite\nwarm and the smell that came in from the outside was alive with newborn\ngreenery. It felt good just to be alive.\n\nThe hanging bottles and festoons of rubber hose were gone. The crude\nmanipulators had been stowed somewhere and the bottles of medicine and\nstuff were missing from the bureau. There wasn't even a thermometer in a\nglass anywhere within the range of my vision, and frankly I was so glad\nto be alive again that I did not see any point to digging through the\njoint with my perception to find the location of the medical junk.\nInstead, I just wanted to get up and run.\n\nI did take a swing at the clothes closet and found my stuff. Then I took\na mild pass at the house, located the bathroom and also assured myself\nthat no one was likely to interrupt me.\n\nI was going to shave and shower and dress and go downstairs. I was just\nshrugging myself up and out of bed when Nurse Farrow came bustling up\nthe stairs and into the room with no preamble.\n\n\"Hi!\" I greeted her. \"I was going to--\"\n\n\"Surprise us,\" she said quickly. \"I know. So I came up to see that you\ndon't get into trouble.\"\n\n\"Trouble?\" I asked, pausing on the edge of the bed.\n\n\"You're a Mekstrom, Steve,\" she told me unnecessarily. Then she caught\nmy thought and went on: \"It's necessary to remind you. You have to learn\nhow to control your strength, Steve.\"\n\nI flexed my arms. They didn't feel any different. I pinched my muscle\nwith my other hand and it pinched just as it always had. I took a deep\nbreath and the air went in pleasantly and come out again.\n\n\"I don't feel any different,\" I told her.\n\nShe smiled and handed me a common wooden lead pencil. \"Write your name,\"\nshe directed.\n\n\"Think I'll have to learn all over?\" I grinned. I took the pencil, put\nmy fist down on the top of the bureau above a pad of paper and chuckled\nat Farrow. \"Now, let's see, my first initial is the letter 'S' made by\nstarting at the top and coming around in a sweeping, graceful curve like\nthis--\"\n\nIt didn't come around in any curve. As the lead point hit the paper it\nbore down in, flicked off the tip, and then crunched down, breaking off\nthe point and splintering the thin, whittled wood for about an eighth of\nan inch. The fact that I could not control it bothered me inside and I\ninstinctively clutched at the shaft of the pencil. It cracked in three\nplaces in my hand; the top end with the eraser fell down over my wrist\nto the bureau top and rolled in a rapid rattle to the edge where it fell\nto the floor.\n\n\"See?\" asked Farrow softly.\n\n\"But--?\" I blundered uncertainly.\n\n\"Steve, your muscles and your nervous system have been stepped up\nproportionately. You've got to re-learn the coordination between the\nmuscle-stimulus and the feedback information from the work you are\ndoing.\"\n\nI began to see what she meant. I remembered long years ago at school,\nwhen we'd been studying some of the new alloys and there had been a\nsample of a magnesium-lithium-something alloy that was machined into a\nsmooth cylinder about four inches in diameter and a foot long. It looked\nlike hard steel. People who picked it up for the first time invariably\nbraced their muscles and set both hands on it. But it was so light that\ntheir initial effort almost tossed the bar through the ceiling, and even\nlong after we all knew, it was hard not to attack the bar without using\nthe experience of our mind and sense that told us that any bar of metal\n_that_ big had to be _that_ heavy.\n\nI went to a chair. Farrow said, \"Be careful,\" and I was. But it was no\ntrick at all to take the chair by one leg at the bottom and lift it chin\nhigh.\n\n\"Now, go take your shower,\" she told me. \"But Steve, please be careful\nof the plumbing. You can twist off the faucet handles, you know.\"\n\nI nodded and turned to her, holding out a hand. \"Farrow, you're a\nbrick!\"\n\nShe took my hand. It was not steel hard. It was warm and firm and\npleasant. It was--holding hands with a woman.\n\nFarrow stepped back. \"One thing you'll have to remember,\" she said\ncheerfully, \"is only to mix with your own kind from now on. Now go get\nthat shower and shave. I'll be getting breakfast.\"\n\nShowering was not hard and I remembered not to twist off the water-tap\nhandles. Shaving was easy although I had to change razor blades three\ntimes in the process. I broke all the teeth out of the comb because it\nwas never intended to be pulled through a thicket of piano wire.\n\nGetting dressed was something else. I caught my heel in one trouser leg\nand shredded the cloth. I broke the buckle on my belt. My shoelaces went\nlike parting a length of wet spaghetti. The button on the top of my\nshirt pinched off and when I gave that final jerk to my necktie it\npulled the knot down into something about the size of a pea.\n\nBreakfast was very pleasant, although I bent the fork tines spearing a\nrasher of bacon and removed the handle of my coffee cup without half\ntrying. After breakfast I discovered that I could not remove a cigarette\nfrom the package without pinching the end down flat, and after I\nsucceeded in getting one into my mouth by treating both smoke and match\nas if they were made of tissue paper, my first drag on the smoke lit a\nhowling furnace-fire on the end that consumed half of the cigarette in\nthe first puff.\n\n\"You're going to take some school before you are fit to walk among\nnormal people, Steve,\" said Gloria with amused interest.\n\n\"You're informing me?\" I asked with some dismay, eyeing the wreckage\nleft in my wake. Compared to the New Steve Cornell, the famous bull in\nthe china shop was Gentle Ferdinand. I picked up the cigarette package\nagain; it squoze down even though I tried to treat it gentle; I felt\nlike Lenny, pinching the head off of the mouse. I also felt about as\nmuch of a bumbling idiot as Lenny, too.\n\nMy re-education went on before, through, and after breakfast. I\nmanhandled old books from the attic. I shredded newspapers. I ruined\nsome more lead pencils and finally broke the pencil sharpener to boot. I\nput an elbow through the middle panel of the kitchen door without even\nfeeling it and then managed to twist off the door knob. Generally\noperating like a one-man army of vandals, I laid waste to the Farrow\nhome.\n\nHaving thus ruined a nice house, Gloria decided to try my strength on\nher car. I was much too fast and too hard on the brakes, which of course\nwas not too bad because my foot was also too insensitive on the\ngo-pedal. We took off like a rocket being launched and then I tromped on\nthe brakes (Bending the pedal) which brought us down sharp like hitting\na haystack. This allowed our heads to catch up with the rest of us; I'm\nsure that if we'd been normal-bodied human beings we'd have had our\nspines snapped. Eventually I learned that everything had to be handled\nas if it were tissue paper, and gradually re-adjusted my reflexes to\ntake proper cognizance of the feedback data according to my new body.\n\nWe returned home after a hectic twenty miles of roadwork and I broke the\nglass as I slammed the car door.\n\n\"It's going to take time,\" I admitted with some reluctance.\n\n\"It always does,\" smiled Farrow as cheerfully as if I hadn't ruined\ntheir possessions.\n\n\"I don't know how I'm going to face your folks.\"\n\nFarrow's smile became cryptic. \"Maybe they won't notice.\"\n\n\"Now look, Farrow----\"\n\n\"Steve, don't forget for the moment that you're the only known Mekstrom\nCarrier.\"\n\n\"In other words your parents are due for the treatment next?\"\n\n\"Oh, I was most thorough. Both of them are in the final stages right\nnow. I'm sure that anything you did to the joint will only be added to\nby the time they get to the walking stage. And also anything you did\nthey'll feel well repaid.\"\n\n\"I didn't do anything for them.\"\n\n\"You provided them with Mekstrom bodies,\" she said simply.\n\n\"They took to it willingly?\"\n\n\"Yes. As soon as they were convinced by watching me and my strength.\nThey knew what it would be like, but they were all for it.\"\n\n\"You've been a very busy girl,\" I told her.\n\nShe just nodded. Then she looked up at me with troubled eyes and asked,\n\"What are you going to do now, Steve?\"\n\n\"I'm going to haul the whole shebang down like Samson in the Temple.\"\n\n\"A lot of innocent people are going to get hurt if you do that.\"\n\n\"I can't very well find a cave in Antarctica and hide,\" I replied\nglumly.\n\n\"Think a bit, Steve. Could either side afford to let you walk into New\nWashington with the living proof of your Mekstrom Body?\"\n\n#Didn't stop 'em before,# I thought angrily. #And it seems to me that\nboth sides were sort of urging me to go and do something that would\nuncover the other side.#\n\n\"Not deep enough,\" said Farrow. \"That was only during the early phases.\nGo back to the day when you didn't know what was going on.\"\n\nI grunted sourly, \"Look, Farrow, tell me. Why must I fumble my way\nthrough this as I've fumbled through everything else?\"\n\n\"Because only by coming to the conclusion in your own way will you be\nconvinced that someone isn't lying to you. Now, think it over, Steve.\"\n\nIt made sense. Even if I came to the wrong conclusion, I'd believe it\nmore than if someone had told me. Farrow nodded, following my thoughts.\nThen I plunged in:\n\n#First we have a man who is found to be a carrier of Mekstrom's Disease.\nHe doesn't know anything about the disease. Right?# (Farrow nodded\nslowly.) #So now the Medical Center puts an anchor onto their carrier by\nsicking an attractive dame on his trail. Um--# At this point I went into\na bit of a mental whirly-around trying to find an answer to one of the\npuzzlers. Farrow just looked at me with a non-leading expression,\nwaiting. I came out of the merry-go-round after six times around the\ncircuit and went on:\n\n#I don't know all the factors. Obviously, Catherine had to lead me fast\nbecause we had to marry before she contracted the disease from me. But\nthere's a discrepancy, Farrow. The little blonde receptionist caught it\nin twenty-four hours--?#\n\n\"Steve,\" said Farrow, \"this is one I'll have to explain, since you're\nnot a medical person. The period of incubation depends upon the type of\ncontact. You actually bit the receptionist. That put blood contact into\nit. You didn't draw any blood from Catherine.\"\n\n\"We were pretty close,\" I said with a slight reddening of the ears.\n\n\"From a medical standpoint, you were not much closer to Catherine than\nyou have been to me, or Dr. Thorndyke. You were closer to Thorndyke and\nme, say, than you've been to many of the incidental parties along the\npath of our travels.\"\n\n\"Well, let that angle go for the moment. Anyway, Catherine and I had to\nmarry before the initial traces were evident. Then I'd be in the\nposition of a man whose wife had contracted Mekstrom's Disease on our\nhoneymoon, whereupon the Medical Center would step in and cure her, and\nI'd be in the position of being forever grateful and willing to do\nanything that the Medical Center wanted me to do. And as a poor\nnon-telepath, I'd probably never learn the truth. Right?\"\n\n\"So far,\" she said, still in a noncommittal tone.\n\n\"So now we crack up along the Highway near the Harrison place. The\nHighways take her in because they take any victim in no matter what. I\nalso presume from what's gone on that Catherine is a high enough\ntelepath to conceal her thinking and so to become an undercover agent in\nthe midst of the Highways organization. And at this point the long long\ntrail takes a fork, doesn't it? The Medical Center gang did not know\nabout the Highways in Hiding until Catherine and I barrelled into it end\nover end.\"\n\nFarrow's face softened, and although she said nothing I knew I was on\nthe right track.\n\n#So at this point,# I went on silently, #Medical Center found themselves\nin a mild quandary. They could hardly put another woman on my trail\nbecause I was already emotionally involved with the missing\nCatherine--and so they decided to use me in another way. I was shown\nenough to keep me busy, I was more or less urged to go track down the\nHighways in Hiding for the Medical Center. After all, as soon as I'd\nmade the initial discovery, Phelps and his outfit shouldn't have needed\nany more help.#\n\n\"A bit more thinking, Steve. You've come up with that answer before.\"\n\n#Sure. Phelps wanted me to take my tale to the Government. About this\nsecret Highway outfit. But if neither side can afford to have the secret\ncome out, how come--?# I pondered this for a long time and admitted that\nit made no sense to me. Finally Farrow shook her head and said,\n\n\"Steve, I've got to prompt you now and then. But remember that I'm\ntrying to make you think it out yourself. Now consider: You are running\nan organization that must be kept secret. Then someone learns the secret\nand starts heading for the Authorities. What is your next move?\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I replied. \"So I'm stupid. Naturally, I pull in my horns, hide\nmy signs, and make like nothing was going on.\"\n\n\"So stopping the advance of your organization, which is all that Phelps\nreally can expect.\"\n\nI thought some more. #And the fact that I was carrying a story that\nwould get me popped into the nearest hatch for the incipient paranoid\nmade it all right?#\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"And now?\" she asked me.\n\n\"And now I'm living proof of my story. Is that right?\"\n\n\"Right. And Steve, do not forget for one moment that the only reason\nthat you're still alive is because you are valuable to both sides alive.\nDead, you're only good for a small quantity of Mekstrom Inoculation.\"\n\n\"Don't follow,\" I grunted. \"As you say, I'm no medical person.\"\n\n\"Alive, your hair grows and must be cut. You shave and trim off beard.\nYour fingernails are pared. Now and then you lose a small bit of hide or\na few milliliters of blood. These are things that, when injected under\nthe skin of a normal human, makes them Mekstrom. Dead, your ground up\nbody would not provide much substance.\"\n\n\"Pleasant prospect,\" I growled. \"So what do I do to avert this future?\"\n\n\"Steve, I don't know. I've done what I can for you. I've effected the\ncure and I've done it in safety; you're still Steve Cornell.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\n\n\"Look,\" I blurted with a sudden rush of brain to the head, \"If I'm so\nall-fired important to both sides, how come you managed to sequester me\nfor four months?\"\n\n\"We do have the laws of privacy,\" said Farrow simply. \"Which neither\nside can afford to flout overtly. Furthermore, since neither side really\nknew where you were, they've been busily prowling one another's camps\nand locking up the prowlers from one another's camps, and playing spy\nand counterspy and counter-counterspy, and generally piling it up\npyramid-wise,\" she finished with a chuckle. \"You got away with following\nthat letter to Catherine because uppermost in your mind was the brain of\na lover hunting down his missing sweetheart. No one could go looking for\nSteve Cornell, Mekstrom Carrier, for reasons not intrinsically private.\"\n\n\"For four months?\" I asked, still incredulous.\n\n\"Well, one of the angles is that both sides knew you were immobilized\nsomewhere, going through this cure. Having you a full Mekstrom is\nsomething that both sides want. So they've been willing to have you\ncured.\"\n\n\"So long as someone does the work, huh?\"\n\n\"Right,\" she said seriously.\n\n\"Well, then,\" I said with a grim smile, \"the obvious thing for me to do\nis to slink quietly into New Washington and to seek out some high\nofficial in secrecy. I'll put my story and facts into his hands, make\nhim a Mekstrom, have him cured, and then we'll set up an agency to\nprovide the general public with--\"\n\n\"Steve, you're an engineer. I presume you've studied mathematics. So\nlet's assume that you can--er--bite one person every ten seconds.\"\n\n\"That's six persons per minute; three-sixty per hour; and, ah,\neighty-six-forty per day. With one hundred and sixty million Americans\nat the last census--um. Sixty years without sleep. I see what you mean.\"\n\n\"Not only that, Steve, but it would create a panic, if not a global war.\nMake an announcement like that, and certain of our not-too-friendly\nneighbors would demand their shares or else. So now add up your time to\ntake care of about three billion human souls on this Earth, Steve.\"\n\n\"All right. So I'll forget that cockeyed notion. But still, the\nGovernment should know--\"\n\n\"If we could be absolutely certain that every elected official is a\nsensible, honest man, we could,\" said Farrow. \"The trouble is that we've\ngot enough demagogues, publicity hounds, and rabble-rousers to make the\nsecret impossible to keep.\"\n\nI couldn't argue against that. Farrow was right. Not only that, but\nGovernment found it hard enough to function in this world of Rhine\nInstitute with honest secrets.\n\n\"Okay, then,\" I said. \"The only thing to do is to go back to Homestead,\nTexas, throw my aid to the Highways in Hiding, and see what we can do to\nprovide the Earth with some more sensible method of inoculation. I\nobviously cannot go around biting people for the rest of my life.\"\n\n\"I guess that's it, Steve.\"\n\nI looked at her. \"I'll have to borrow your car.\"\n\n\"It's yours.\"\n\n\"You'll be all right?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Eventually I'll be a way station on the Highways, I\nsuppose. Can you make it alone, Steve? Or would you rather wait until my\nparents are cured? You could still use a telepath, you know.\"\n\n\"Think it's safe for me to wait?\"\n\n\"It's been four months. Another week or two--?\"\n\n\"All right. And in the meantime I'll practice getting along with this\nnew body of mine.\"\n\nWe left it there. I roamed the house with Farrow, helping her with her\nparents. I gradually learned how to control the power of my new muscles;\nlearned how to walk among normal people without causing their attention;\nand one day succeeded in shaking hands with a storekeeper without giving\naway my secret.\n\nEventually Nurse Farrow's parents came out of their treatment and we\nspent another couple of days with them.\n\nWe left them too soon, I'm sure, but they seemed willing that we take\noff. They'd set up a telephone system for getting supplies so that\nthey'd not have to go into town until they learned how to handle their\nbodies properly, and Farrow admitted that there was little more that we\ncould do.\n\nSo we took off because we all knew that time was running out. Even\nthough both sides had left us alone while I was immobilized, both sides\nmust have a time-table good enough to predict my eventual cure. In fact,\nas I think about it now, both sides must have been waiting along the\nouter edges of some theoretical area waiting for me to emerge, since\nthey couldn't come plowing in without giving away their purpose.\n\nSo we left in Farrow's car and once more hit the big broad road.\n\nWe drove towards Texas until we came upon a Highway, and then turned\nalong it looking for a way station. I wanted to get in touch with the\nHighways. I wanted close communication with the Harrisons and the rest\nof them, no matter what. Eventually we came upon a Sign with a missing\nspoke and turned in.\n\nThe side road wound in and out, leading us back from the Highway towards\nthe conventional dead area. The house was a white structure among a\nlight thicket of trees, and as we came close to it, we met a man busily\ntilling the soil with a tractor plow.\n\nFarrow stopped her car. I leaned out and started to call, but something\nstopped me.\n\n\"He is no Mekstrom, Steve,\" said Farrow in a whisper.\n\n\"But this is a way station, according to the road sign.\"\n\n\"I know. But it isn't, according to him. He doesn't know any more about\nMekstrom's Disease than you did before you met Catherine.\"\n\n\"Then what the devil is wrong?\"\n\n\"I don't know. He's perceptive, but not too well trained. Name's William\nCarroll. Let me do the talking, I'll drop leading remarks for you to\npick up.\"\n\nThe man came over amiably. \"Looking for someone?\" he asked cheerfully.\n\n\"Why, yes,\" said Gloria. \"We're sort of mildly acquainted with\nthe--Mannheims who used to live here. Sort of friends of friends of\ntheirs, just dropped by to say hello, sort of,\" she went on, covering up\nthe fact that she'd picked the name of the former occupant out of his\nmind.\n\n\"The Mannheims moved about two months ago,\" he said. \"Sold the place to\nus--we got a bargain. Don't really know, of course, but the story is\nthat one of them had to move for his health.\"\n\n\"Too bad. Know where they went?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Carroll regretfully. \"They seem to have a lot of friends.\nAlways stopping by, but I can't help 'em any.\"\n\n#So they moved so fast that they couldn't even change their Highway\nSign?# I thought worriedly.\n\nFarrow nodded at me almost imperceptibly. Then she said to Carroll,\n\"Well, we won't keep you. Too bad the Mannheims moved, without leaving\nan address.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said with obvious semi-interest. He eyed his half-plowed\nfield and Farrow started her car.\n\nWe started off and he turned to go back to his work. \"Anything?\" I\nasked.\n\n\"No,\" she said, but it was a very puzzled voice. \"Nothing that I can put\na finger on.\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"I don't know much about real estate deals,\" she said. \"I suppose that\none family could move out and another family move in just in this short\na time.\"\n\n\"Usually they don't let farmlands lie fallow,\" I pointed out. \"If\nthere's anything off color here, it's the fact that they changed their\nresidence without changing the Highway sign.\"\n\n\"Unless,\" I suggested brightly, \"this is the coincidence. Maybe this\nsign is really one that got busted.\"\n\nFarrow turned her car into the main highway and we went along it. I\ncould have been right about the spoke actually being broken instead of\nremoved for its directing purpose. I hoped so. In fact I hoped so hard\nthat I was almost willing to forget the other bits of evidence. But then\nI had to face the truth because we passed another Highway Sign and, of\ncourse, its directional information pointed to that farm. The signs on\nour side of the highway were upside down; indicating that we were\nleaving the way station. The ones that were posted on the left hand side\nwere rightside up, indicating that the drive was approaching a way\nstation. That cinched it.\n\n#Well,# as I told both Farrow and me, #one error doesn't create a trend.\nLet's take another look!#\n\nOne thing and another, we would either hit another way station before we\ngot to Homestead, or we wouldn't. Either one could put us wise. So we\ntook off again with determination and finally left that side of\nerroneous Highway Signs when we turned onto Route 66. We weren't on\nRoute 66 very long because the famous U.S. Highway sort of trends to the\nNortheast and Homestead was in a Southern portion of Texas. We left\nRoute 66 at Amarillo and picked up U.S. 87, which leads due South.\n\nNot many miles out of Amarillo we came up another set of Highway Signs\nthat pointed us on to the South. I tried to remember whether this\nsection led to Homestead by a long route, but I hadn't paid too much\nattention to the maps when I'd had the chance and therefore the facts\neluded me.\n\nWe'd find out, Farrow and I agreed, and then before we could think much\nmore about it, we came upon a way station sign that pointed in to\nanother farmhouse.\n\n\"Easy,\" I said.\n\n\"You bet,\" she replied, pointing to the rural-type mailbox alongside the\nroad.\n\nI nodded. The box was not new but the lettering on the side was. \"Still\nwet,\" I said with a grunt.\n\nFarrow slowed her car as we approached the house and I leaned out and\ngave a cheerful hail. A woman came out of the front door and waved at\nus.\n\n\"I'm trying to locate a family named Harrison,\" I called. \"Lived around\nhere somewhere.\"\n\nThe woman looked thoughtful. She was maybe thirty-five or so, clean but\nnot company-dressed. There was a smudge of flour on her cheek and a\nsmile on her face and she looked wholesome and honest.\n\n\"Why, I don't really know,\" she said. \"That name sounds familiar, but it\nis not an uncommon name.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said uselessly. Farrow nudged me on the ankle with her toe\nand then made a swift sign for \"P\" in the hand-sign code.\n\n\"Why don't you come on in?\" invited the woman. \"We've got an area\ntelephone directory here. Maybe--?\"\n\nFarrow nudged me once more and made the sign of \"M\" with her swift\nfingers. We had hit it this time; here was a woman perceptive and a\nMekstrom residing in a way station. I took a mild dig at her hands and\nthere was no doubt of her.\n\nA man's head appeared in the doorway above the woman; he had a hard face\nand he was tall and broad shouldered but there was a smile on his face\nthat spread around the pipe he was biting on. He called, \"Come on in and\ntake a look.\"\n\nFarrow made the sign of \"T\" and \"M\" and that told me that he was a\ntelepath. She hadn't needed the \"M\" sign because I'd taken a fast\nglimpse of his hide as soon as he appeared. Parrying for time and\nsomething evidential, I merely said, \"No, we'd hate to intrude. We were\njust asking.\"\n\nThe man said, \"Oh, shucks, Mister. Come on in and have a cup of coffee,\nanyway.\" His invitation was swift enough to set me on edge.\n\nI turned my perception away from him and took a fast cast at the\nsurrounding territory. There was a mildly dead area along the lead-in\nroad to the left; it curved around in a large arc and the other horn of\nthis horseshoe shape came up behind the house and stopped abruptly just\ninside of their front door. The density of this area varied, the end in\nwhich the house was built was so total that I couldn't penetrate, while\nthe other end that curved around to end by the road tapered off in\ndeadness until it was hard to define the boundary.\n\nIf someone were pulling a flanking movement around through that\nhorseshoe to cut off our retreat, it would become evident very soon.\n\nA swift thought went through my mind: #Farrow, they're Mekstroms and\nhe's a telepath and she's a perceptive, and they know we're friendly if\nthey're Highways. If they're connected with Scholar Phelps and his--#\n\nThe man repeated, \"Come on in. We've some mail to go to Homestead that\nyou can take if you will.\"\n\nFarrow made no sound. She just seesawed her car with three rapid\nback-and-forth jerks that sent showers of stones from her spinning\nwheels. We whined around in a curve that careened the car up on its\noutside wheels. Then we ironed out and showered the face of the man with\nstones from the wheels as we took off. The shower of dust and stones\nblinded him, and kept him from latching onto the tail of the car and\nclimbing in. We left him behind, swearing and rubbing dirt from his\neyes.\n\nWe whipped past the other end of the horseshoe area just as a jeepster\ncame roaring down out of the thickened part into the region where my\nperception could make out the important things (Like three burly gents\nwearing hunting rifles, for instance.) They jounced over the rough\nground and onto the lead-in road just behind us; another few seconds of\ngab with our friends and they'd have been able to cut us off.\n\n\"Pour it on, Farrow!\"\n\nI knew I was a bit of a cowboy, but Farrow made me look like a\ntenderfoot. We rocketed down the winding road with our wheels riding up\non either side like the course in a toboggan run and Farrow rode that\ncar like a test pilot in a sudden thunderstorm.\n\nI was worried about the hunting rifles, but I need not have been\nconcerned. We were going too fast to make good aim, and their jeepster\nwas not a vehicle known for its smooth riding qualities. They lost one\ncharacter over a rough bounce and he went tail over scalp into the grass\nalong the way. He scared me by leaping to his feet, grabbing the rifle\nand throwing it up to aim. But before he could squeeze off a round we\nwere out of the lead-in road and on the broad highway.\n\nOnce on the main road again, Farrow put the car hard down by the nose\nand we outran them. The jeepster was a workhorse and could have either\npulled over the house or climbed the wall and run along the roof, but it\nwas not made for chase.\n\n\"That,\" I said, \"seems to be that.\"\n\n\"Something is bad,\" agreed Farrow.\n\n\"Well, I doubt that they'll be able to clean out a place as big as\nHomestead. So let's take our careful route to Homestead and find out\nprecisely what the devil is cooking.\"\n\n\"Know the route?\"\n\n\"No, but I know where it is on the map and we can figure it out from--\"\n\n\"Steve, stop. Take a very careful and delicate view over to the right.\"\n\n\"Digging for what?\"\n\n\"Another car pacing us along a road on the other side of that field.\"\n\nI tried and failed. Then I leaned back in the seat and closed my eyes\nand tried again. On this second try I got a very hazy perception of a\nlarge moving mass that could only have been a car. In the car I received\na stronger impression of weapons. It was the latter that cinched it.\n\nI hauled out my roadmap and turned it to Texas. I thumbed the sectional\nmaps of Texas until I located the sub-district through which we were\npassing and then I identified this section of U.S. 87 precisely. There\nwas another road parallel and a half mile to the right, a dirt road\naccording to the map-legend. It intersected our road a few miles ahead.\n\nMy next was a thorough covering of the road behind; as I expected\nanother car was pacing us just beyond the range of my perception for\nanything but a rifle aimed at my hide.\n\nPacing isn't quite the word, I use it in the sense of their keeping up\nwith us. Fact is that all of us were going about as fast as we could go,\nwith safety of tertiary importance. Anyway, they were pacing us and\nclosing down from that parallel road on the right.\n\nI took a fast and very careful scanning of the landscape to our left but\ncouldn't find anything. I spent some time at it then, but still came up\nwith a blank.\n\n#Turn left at that feeder road a mile ahead,# I thought at Farrow and\nshe nodded.\n\nThere was one possibility that I did not like to face. We had definitely\ndetected pursuit to our right and behind, but not to our left. This did\nnot mean that the left-side was not covered. It was quite likely that\nthe gang to the rear were in telepathic touch with a network of other\ntelepaths, the end of which mental relay link was far beyond range, but\nas close in touch with our position and action as if we'd been in sight.\nThe police make stake-out nets that way, but the idea is not exclusive.\nI recall hazing an eloping couple that way once.\n\nBut there was nothing to do but to take the feeder road to the left,\nbecause the devil we could see was more dangerous than the devil we\ncouldn't.\n\nFarrow whipped into the side road and we tore along with only a slight\nslowing of our headlong speed. I ranged ahead, worried, suspicious of\neverything, scanning very carefully and strictly on the watch for any\nevidence of attempted interception.\n\nI caught a touch of danger converging up from the South on a series of\nsmall roads. This I did not consider dangerous after a fast look at my\nroadmap because this series of roads did not meet our side road for a\nlong time and only after a lot of turning and twisting. So long as we\nwent Easterly, we were okay from that angle.\n\nThe gang behind, of course, followed us, staying at the very edge of my\nrange.\n\n\"You'll have to fly, Farrow,\" I told her. \"If that gang to our South\nstays there, we'll not be able to turn down Homestead way.\"\n\n\"Steve, I'm holding this crate on the road by main force and awkwardness\nas it is.\"\n\nBut she did step it up a bit, at that. I kept a cautious and suspicious\nwatchout, worrying in the back of my mind that someone among them might\nturn up with a jetcopter. So long as the sky remained clear--\n\nAs time went on, I perceived that the converging car to the South was\nlosing ground because of the convolutions of their road. Accordingly we\nturned to the South, making our way around their nose, sort of, and\ncrossing their anticipated course to lead South. We hit U.S. 180 to the\nWest of Breckenridge, Texas and then Farrow really poured on the coal.\nThe idea was to hit Fort Worth and lose them in the city where fun,\ngames, and telepath-perceptive hare-and-hounds would be viewed dimly by\nthe peaceloving citizens. Then we'd slope to the South on U.S. 81, cut\nover to U.S. 75 somewhere to the South and take 75 like a cannonball\nuntil we turned off on the familiar road to Homestead.\n\nFort Worth was a haven and a detriment to both sides. Neither of us\ncould afford to run afoul of the law. So we both cut down to sensible\nspeeds and snaked our way through the town, with Farrow and me probing\nthe roads to the South in hope of finding a clear lane.\n\nThere were three cars pacing us, cutting off our retreat Southward. They\nhazed us forward to the East like a dog nosing a bunch of sheep towards\npappy's barn.\n\nThen we were out of Forth Worth and on U.S. 180. We whipped into Dallas\nand tried the same circumfusion as before and we were as neatly barred.\nSo we went out of Dallas on U.S. 67 and as we left the city limits, we\npoured on the oil again, hoping to get around them so that we could turn\nback South towards Homestead.\n\n\"Boxed,\" I said.\n\n\"Looks like it,\" said Farrow unhappily.\n\nI looked at her. She was showing signs of weariness and I realized that\nshe'd been riding this road for hours. \"Let me take it,\" I said.\n\n\"We need your perception,\" she objected. \"You can't drive and keep a\nranging perception, Steve.\"\n\n\"A lot of good a ranging perception will do once you drop for lack of\nsleep and we tie us up in a ditch.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"We're boxed,\" I told her. \"We're being hazed. Let's face it, Farrow.\nThey could have surrounded us and glommed us any time in the past six\nhours.\"\n\n\"Why didn't they?\" she asked.\n\n\"You ask that because you're tired,\" I said with a grim smile. \"Any\nbunch that has enough cars to throw a barrier along the streets of\ncities like Forth Worth and Dallas have enough manpower to catch us if\nthey want to. So long as we drive where they want us to go, they won't\ncramp us down.\"\n\n\"I hate to admit it.\"\n\n\"So do I. But let's swap, Farrow. Then you can use your telepathy on\nthem maybe and find out what their game is.\"\n\nShe nodded, pulled the car down to a mere ramble and we swapped seats\nquickly. As I let the crate out again, I took one last, fast dig of the\nlandscape and located the cars that were blocking out the passageways to\nthe South, West, and North, leaving a nice inviting hole to the\nEasterly-North way. Then I had to haul in my perception and slap it\nalong the road ahead, because I was going to ramble far and fast and see\nif I could speed out of the trailing horseshoe and cut out around the\nSouth horn with enough leeway to double back towards Homestead.\n\n\"Catch any plans from them?\" I asked Farrow.\n\nThere was no answer. I looked at her. Gloria Farrow was semi-collapsed\nin her seat, her eyes closed gently and her breath coming in long,\npleasant swells. I'd known she was tired, but I hadn't expected this\nabsolute ungluing. A damned good kid, Farrow.\n\nAt that last thought, Farrow moved slightly in her sleep and a wisp of a\nsmile crossed her lips briefly. Then she turned a bit and snuggled down\nin the seat and really hit the slumber-path.\n\nA car came roaring at me with flashing headlamps and I realized that\ndusk was coming. I didn't need the lights, but oncoming drivers did, so\nI snapped them on. The beams made bright tunnels in the light and we\nwent along and on and on and on, hour after hour. Now and then I caught\na perceptive impression the crescent of cars that were corralling us\nalong U.S. 67 and not letting us off the route.\n\nI hauled out my roadmap and eyed the pages as I drove by perception.\nU.S. 67 led to St. Louis and from there due North. I had a hunch that by\nthe time we played hide and seek through St. Louis and got ourselves\nhazed out to their satisfaction, I'd be able to give a strong guess as\nto our ultimate destination.\n\nI settled down in my seat and just drove, still hoping to cut fast and\nfar around them on my way to Homestead.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\n\nThree times during the night I tried to flip around and cut my way\nthrough their cordon, and each time I faced interception. It was evident\nthat we were being driven and so long as we went to their satisfaction\nthey weren't going to clobber us.\n\nNurse Farrow woke up along about dawn, stretched, and remarked that she\ncould use a toothbrush and a tub of hot water and amusedly berated\nherself for not filling the back seat before we took off. Then she\nbecame serious again and asked for the details of the night, which I\nslipped her as fast as I could.\n\nWe stopped long enough to swap seats, and I stretched out but I couldn't\nsleep.\n\nFinally I said, \"Stop at the next dog wagon, Farrow. We're going to eat,\ncomes anything.\"\n\n\"Won't that be dangerous?\"\n\n\"Shucks,\" I grunted angrily. \"They'll probably thank us. They're\nprobably hungry too.\"\n\n\"We'll find out.\"\n\nThe smell of a roadside diner is usually a bit on the thick and greasy\nside, but I was so hungry that morning that it smelled like mother's\nkitchen. We went in, ordered coffee and orange juice, and then\ndisappeared into the rest rooms long enough to clean up. That felt so\ngood we ordered the works and watched the guy behind the fryplate handle\nthe bacon, eggs, and home-fries with a deft efficient manner.\n\nWe pitched in fast, hoping to beat the flies to our breakfast. We were\nso intent that we paid no attention to the car that came into the lot\nuntil a man came in, ordered coffee and a roll, and then carried it over\nto our table.\n\n\"Fine day for a ride, isn't it?\"\n\nI eyed him; Farrow bristled and got very tense. I said, \"I doubt that I\nknow you, friend.\"\n\n\"Quite likely. But I know you, Cornell.\"\n\nI took a fast dig; there was no sign of anything lethal except the usual\ncollection of tire irons, screwdrivers, and other tools which, oddly\nenough, seldom come through as being dangerous because they're not\nweapons-by-design.\n\n\"I'm not heeled, Cornell. I'm just here to save us all some trouble.\"\n\n#Telepath?#\n\nHe nodded imperceptibly. Then he said, \"We'll all save time, gasoline,\nand maybe getting into grief with the cops if you take Route 40 out of\nSt. Louis.\"\n\n\"Suppose I don't like U.S. 40?\"\n\n\"Get used to it,\" he said with a crooked smile. \"Because you'll take\nU.S. 40 out of St. Louis whether you like it or not.\"\n\nI returned his crooked smile. I also dug his hide and he was a Mekstrom,\nof course. \"Friend,\" I replied, \"Nothing would convince me, after what\nyou've said, that U.S. 40 is anything but a cowpath; slippery when wet;\nand impassible in the Early Spring, Late Summer, and the third Thursday\nafter Michelmas.\"\n\nHe stood up. \"Cornell, I can see your point. You don't like U.S. 40. So\nI'll help you good people. If you don't want to drive along such a lousy\nslab of concrete, just say the word and we'll arrange for you to take it\nin style, luxury, and without a trace of pain or strain. I'll be seein'\nyou. And a very pleasant trip to you, Miss Farrow.\"\n\nThen the character got up, went to the cashier and paid for our\nbreakfast as well as his own. He took off in his car and I have never\nseen him since.\n\nFarrow looked at me, her face white and her whole attitude one of\nfright. \"U.S. 40,\" she said in a shaky voice, \"runs like a stretched\nstring from St. Louis to Indianapolis.\"\n\nShe didn't have to tell me any more. About sixty miles North of\nIndianapolis on Indiana State Highway 37 lies the thriving metropolis of\nMarion, Indiana, the most important facet of which (to Farrow and me) is\nan establishment called the Medical Research Center.\n\nNothing was going to make me drive out of St. Louis along U.S. 40.\nPeriod; End of message; No answer required.\n\nNothing, because I was very well aware of their need to collect me alive\nand kicking. If I could not roar out of St. Louis in the direction I\nselected, I was going to turn my car end for end and have at them. Not\nin any mild manner, but with deadly intent to do deadly damage. If I'd\nmake a mild pass, they'd undoubtedly corral me by main force and carry\nme off kicking and screaming. But if I went at them to kill or get\nkilled, they'd have to move aside just to prevent me from killing\nmyself. I didn't think I'd get to the last final blow of that\nself-destruction. I'd win through.\n\nSo we left the diner after a breakfast on our enemy's expense account\nand took off again.\n\nI was counting on St. Louis. The center of the old city is one big\nshapeless blob of a dead area; so nice and cold that St. Louis has\nreversed the usual city-type blight area growth. Ever since Rhine, the\nslum sections have been moving out and the new buildings have been\nmoving in. So with the dead area and the brand-new, wide streets and\nfancy traffic control, St. Louis was the place to go in along one road,\nget lost in traffic, and come out, roaring along any road desirable. I\ncould not believe that any outfit, hoping to work under cover, could\ncollect enough manpower and cars to block every road, lane, highway and\nduckrunway that led out of a city as big as St. Louis.\n\nAgain they hazed us by pacing along parallel roads and behind us with\nthe open end of their crescent aimed along U.S. 67. We went like hell;\nwithout slowing a bit we sort of swooped up to St. Louis and took a fast\ndive into that big blob-shaped dead area. We wound up in traffic and\ntied Boy Scout knots in our course. I was concerned about overhead\ncoverage from a 'copter even though I've been told that the St. Louis\ndead area extends upward in some places as high as thirteen thousand\nfeet.\n\nThe only thing missing was some device or doodad that would let us use\nour perception or telepathy in this deadness while they couldn't. As it\nwas, we were as psi-blind as they were, so we had to go along the\nstreets with our eyes carefully peeled for cars of questionable\nownership. We saw some passenger cars with out-of-state licenses and\ngave them wide clearances. One of them hung on our tail until I\ncommitted a very neat coup by running through a stoplight and\nsandwiching my car between two whopping big fourteen-wheel moving vans.\nI'd have enjoyed the expression on the driver's face if I could have\nseen it. But then we were gone and he was probably cussing.\n\nI stayed between the vans as we wound ourselves along the road and\nturned into a side street.\n\nI stayed between them too long.\n\nBecause the guy in front slammed on his air-brakes and the big van came\nto a stop with a howl of tires on concrete. The guy behind did not even\nslow down. He closed in on us like an avalanche. I took a fast look\naround and fought the wheel of my car to turn aside, but he whaled into\nmy tail and we went sliding forward. I was riding my brakes but the mass\nof that moving van was so great that my tires just wore flats on the\npavement-side.\n\nWe were bearing down on that stopped van and it looked as though we were\ngoing to be driving a very tall car with a very short wheelbase in a\nvery short time.\n\nThen the whole back panel of the front van came tumbling towards me from\nthe top, pivoting on a hinge at the bottom, making a fine ramp. The van\nbehind me nudged us up the ramp and we hurtled forward against a thick,\nresilient pad that stopped my car without any damage either to the car\nor to the inhabitants.\n\nThen the back panel closed up and the van took off.\n\nTwo big birds on each side opened the doors of our car simultaneously\nand said \"Out!\"\n\nThe tall guy on my side gave me a cocksure smile and the short guy said,\n\"We're about to leave St. Louis on U.S. 40, Cornell. I hope you won't\nfind this journey too rough.\"\n\nI started to take a swing, but the tall one caught my elbow and threw me\noff balance. The short one reached down and picked up a baseball bat.\n\"Use this, Cornell,\" he told me. \"Then no one will get hurt.\"\n\nI looked at the pair of them, and then gave up. There are odd characters\nin this world who actually enjoy physical combat and don't mind getting\nhurt if they can hurt the other guy more. These were the type. Taking\nthat baseball bat and busting it over the head of either one would be\nthe same sort of act as kids use when they square off in an alley and\nexchange light blows which they call a \"cardy\" just to make the fight\nlegal. All it would get me was a sore jaw and a few cracked ribs.\n\nSo after my determination to take after them with murderous intent,\nthey'd pulled my teeth by scooping me up in this van and disarming me.\n\nI relaxed.\n\nThe short one nodded, although he looked disappointed that I hadn't\nallowed him the fun of a shindy. \"You'll find U.S. 40 less rough than\nyou expected,\" he said. \"After all, it's like life; only rough if you\nmake it rough.\"\n\n\"Go to hell and stay there,\" I snapped. That was about as weak a\nrejoinder as I've ever emitted, but it was all I could get out.\n\nThe tall one said, \"Take it easy, Cornell. You can't win 'em all.\"\n\nI looked across the nose of our trapped car to Farrow. She was leaning\nagainst the hood, facing her pair. They were just standing there at\nease. One of them was offering a cigarette and the other held a lighter\nready. \"Relax,\" said the one with the smokes. The other one said, \"Might\nas well, Miss Farrow. Fighting won't get nobody nowhere but where you're\ngoing anyway. Might as well go on your own feet.\"\n\nScornfully, Farrow shrugged. \"Why should I smoke my own?\" she asked\nnobody in particular.\n\nMentally I agreed: #Take 'em for all they're worth, Farrow!# And then I\nreached for one, too. Along the side of the van were benches. I sat\ndown, stretched out on my back and let the smoke trickle up. I finished\nmy cigarette and then found that the excitement of this chase, having\ndied so abruptly, left me with only a desire to catch up on sleep.\n\nI dozed off thinking that it wasn't everybody who started off to go to\nHomestead, Texas, and ended up in Marion, Indiana.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nScholar Phelps did not have the green carpet out for our arrival, but he\nwas present when our mobile prison cell opened deep inside of the\nMedical Center grounds. So was Thorndyke. Thorndyke and three nurses of\nAmazon build escorted Farrow off with the air of captors collecting a\ntraitor.\n\nPhelps smiled superciliously at me and said, \"Well, young sir, you've\ngiven us quite a chase.\"\n\n\"Give me another chance and we'll have another chase,\" I told him\ngrumpily.\n\n\"Not if we can help it,\" he boomed cheerfully. \"We've big plans for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Have I got a vote? It's 'Nay!' if I do.\"\n\n\"You're too precipitous,\" he told me. \"It is always an error, Mr.\nCornell, to be opinionated. Have an open mind.\"\n\n\"To what?\"\n\n\"To everything,\" he said with an expansive gesture. \"The error of all\nthinking, these days, is that people do not think. They merely follow\nsomeone else's thinking.\"\n\n\"And I'm to follow yours?\"\n\n\"I'd prefer that, of course. It would indicate that you were possessed\nof a mind of your own; that you weren't merely taking the lazy man's\nattitude and following in the footsteps of your father.\"\n\n\"Skip it,\" I snapped. \"Your way isn't--\"\n\n\"Now,\" he warned with a wave of a forefinger like a prohibitionist\nwarning someone not to touch that quart, \"One must never form an opinion\non such short notice. Remember, all ideas are not to be rejected just\nbecause they do not happen to agree with your own preconceived notions.\"\n\n\"Look, Phelps,\" I snapped, deliberately omitting his title which I knew\nwould bite a little, \"I don't like your personal politics and I deplore\nyour methods. You can't go on playing this way--\"\n\n\"Young man, you err,\" he said quietly. He did not even look nettled that\nI'd addressed him in impolite (if not rough) terms. \"May I point out\nthat I am far ahead of your game? Thoroughly outnumbered, and in\nignorance of the counter-movement against me until you so vigorously\nbrought it to my attention; within a year I have fought the\ncounter-movement to a standstill, caused the dispersement of their main\nforces, ruined their far-flung lines of communication, and have so\nconsolidated my position that I have now made open capture of the main\nroving factor. The latter is you, young man. A very disturbing influence\nand so very necessary to the conduct of this private war. You prate of\nmy attitude, Mr. Cornell. You claim that such an attitude must be\ndefeated. Yet as you stand there mouthing platitudes, we are preparing\nto make a frontal assault upon their main base at Homestead. We've waged\nour war of attrition; a mere spearhead will break them and scatter them\nto the far winds.\"\n\n\"Nice lecture,\" I grunted. \"Who are your writers?\"\n\n\"Let's not attempt sarcasm,\" he said crisply. \"It sits ill upon you, Mr.\nCornell.\"\n\n\"I'd like to sit on you,\" I snapped.\n\n\"Your humor is less tolerable than your sarcasm.\"\n\n\"Can it!\" I snapped. \"So you've collected me. I'll still--\"\n\n\"You'll do very little, Mr. Cornell,\" he told me. \"Your determination to\nattack us tooth and nail was an excellent program, and with another type\nof person it might have worked. But I happen to know that your will to\nlive is very great, young man, and that in the final blow, you'd not\nhave the will to die great enough to carry your assault to its\ncompletion.\"\n\n\"Know a lot, don't you.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed I do. So now if you're through trying to fence at words,\nwe'll go to your quarters.\"\n\n\"Lead on,\" I said in a hollow voice.\n\nWith an air of stage-type politeness, he indicated a door. He showed me\nout and followed me. He steered me to a big limousine with a chauffeur\nand offered me cigarettes from a box on the arm rest as the driver\nstarted the turbine. The car purred with that muted sound of\nwell-leashed power.\n\n\"You could be of inestimable value to us,\" he said in a conversational\ntone. \"I am talking this way to you because you can be of much more\nvalue as a willing ally than you would be if unwilling.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" I replied dryly.\n\n\"I suggest you set aside your preconceived notions and employ a modicum\nof practical logic,\" suggested Scholar Phelps. \"Observe your position\nfrom a slightly different reign of vantage. Be convinced that no matter\nwhat you do or say, we intend to make use of you to the best of our\nability. You are not entertaining any doubts of that fact, I'm sure.\"\n\nI shrugged. Phelps was not asking me these things, the inquisitor was\nactually telling me. He went right on telling me:\n\n\"Since you will be used no matter what, you might consider the\nadvisability of being sensible, Mr. Cornell. In blunt words, we are\nprepared to meet cooperation with certain benefits which will not be\nproffered otherwise.\"\n\n\"In blunter words you are offering to hire me.\"\n\nScholar Phelps smiled in a superior manner. \"Not that blunt, Mr.\nCornell, not that crude. The term 'hire' implies the performance of\ncertain tasks in return for stipulated remuneration. No, my intention is\nto give you a position in this organization the exact terms of which are\nnot clearly definable. Look, young man, I've indicated that your willing\ncooperation is more valuable to us than otherwise. Join us and you will\nenjoy the freedom of our most valued and trusted members; you will take\npart in upper level planning; you will enjoy the income and advantages\nof top executive personnel.\" He stopped short and eyed me with a\npeculiar expression. \"Mr. Cornell, you have the most disconcerting way.\nYou've actually caused me to talk as if this organization were some sort\nof big business instead of a cultural unit.\"\n\nI eyed him with the first bit of humor I'd found in many days. \"You seem\nto talk just as though a cultural unit were set above, beyond, and\nspiritually divorced from anything so sordid as money, position, and the\nhuman equivalent of the barnyard pecking order,\" I told him. \"So now\nlet's stop goofing off, and put it into simple terms. You want me to\njoin you willingly, to do your job for you, to advance your program. In\nreturn for which I shall be permitted to ride in the solid gold\ncadillac, quaff rare champagne, and select my own office furniture.\nIsn't that about it?\"\n\nScholar Phelps smiled, using a benign expression that indicated that he\nwas pleased with himself, but which had absolutely nothing to do with\nhis attitude towards me or any of the rest of the human race.\n\n\"Mr. Cornell, I am well aware of the time it may take for a man to\neffect a change in his attitude. In fact, I would be very suspicious if\nyou were to make an abrupt reversal. However, I have outlined my\nposition and you may have time to think it over. Consider, at the very\nleast, the fact that while cooperation will bring you pleasure and\nnon-cooperation will bring you pain, the ultimate result will be that we\nwill make use of your ability in either case. Now--I will say no more\nfor the present.\"\n\nThe limousine had stopped in front of a four story brick building that\nwas only slightly different in general architecture than others in the\nMedical Center. I could sense some slight difference, but when I took a\ndig at the interior I found to my amazement that this building had been\nbuilt deliberately in a dead zone. The dead area stood up in the clarity\nlike a little blob of black ink at the bottom of a crystal clear\nswimming pool, seen just before the ink began to diffuse.\n\nScholar Phelps saw my look of puzzlement and said, suavely, \"We've\nreversed the usual method of keeping unwilling guests. Here we know\ntheir frame of mind and attitude; therefore to build the place in a dead\narea keeps them from plotting among themselves. I trust that your\nresidence herein will be only temporary, Mr. Cornell.\"\n\nI nodded glumly. I was facing those last and final words: _Or Else!_\n\nPhelps signed a register at a guard's station in the lobby. We took a\nvery fast and efficient elevator to the third floor and Phelps escorted\nme along a hallway that was lined with doors, dormitory style. In the\neye-level center of each door was a bull's eye that looked like one-way\nglass and undoubtedly was. I itched to take a look, but Phelps was not\nhaving any; he stopped my single step with a hand on my arm.\n\n\"This way,\" he said smoothly.\n\nI went this way and was finally shown into one of the rooms. My nice\nclean cell away from home.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n\nAs soon as Phelps was gone, I took a careful look at my new living\nquarters. The room itself was about fourteen by eighteen, but the end in\nwhich I was confined was only fourteen by ten, the other eight feet of\nend being barred off by a very efficient-looking set of heavy metal rods\nand equally strong cross-girdering. There was a sliding door that fit in\nplace as nicely as the door to a bank vault; it was locked by heavy\nkeeper-bars that slid up from the floor and down from the ceiling and\nthey were actuated by hidden motors. In the barrier was a flat\nhorizontal slot wide enough to take a tray and high enough to pass a\nteacup. The bottom of this slot was flush with a small table that\nextended through the barrier by a couple of feet on both sides so that a\ntray could be set down on the outside and slipped in.\n\nI tested the bars with my hands, but even my new set of muscles wouldn't\nflex them more than a few thousandths of an inch.\n\nThe walls were steel. All I got as I tried them was a set of\npaint-clogged fingernails. The floor was also steel. The ceiling was a\nbit too high for me to tackle, but I assumed that it, too, was steel.\nThe window was barred from the inside, undoubtedly so that any visitor\nfrom the outside could not catch on to the fact that this building was a\nprivate calaboose.\n\nThe--er--furnishings of this cold storage bin were meager of minimum\nrequirements. A washstand and toilet. A bunk made of metal girders\nwelded to the floor. The bedding rested on wide resilient straps fixed\nto the cross-bars at top and bottom of the bed. A foam-rubber mattress,\nsheets, and one blanket finished off the bed.\n\nIt was a cell designed by Mekstroms to contain Mekstroms and by\nwiseacres to contain other wiseacres. The non-metallic parts of the room\nwere, of course, fireproof. Anything I could get hold of was totally\nuseless as a weapon or lever or tool; anything that might have been\nuseful to a prisoner was welded down.\n\nHaving given up in the escape department, I sat on my bunk and lit a\ncigarette. I looked for tell-tales, and found a television lens set\nabove the door of the room eight feet outside of my steel barrier.\nBeside the lens was a speaker grille and a smaller opening that looked\nlike a microphone dust cover.\n\nWith a grunt, I flipped my cigarette at the television lens. I hit just\nabove the hole, missing it by about an inch. Immediately a\ntinny-sounding voice said,\n\n\"That is not permitted, Mr. Cornell. You are expected to maintain some\ndegree of personal cleanliness. Since you cannot pick up that cigarette\nbutt, you have placed an unwelcome task upon our personnel. One more\ninfraction of this nature and you will not be permitted the luxury of\nsmoking.\"\n\n\"Go to the devil!\" I snapped.\n\nThere was no reply. Not even a haughty chuckle. The silence was worse\nthan any reply because it pointed out the absolute superiority of their\nposition.\n\nEventually I dozed off, there being nothing else to do. When I awoke\nthey'd shoved a tray of food in on my table. I ate unenthusiastically. I\ndozed again, during which time someone removed the tray. When I woke up\nthe second time it was night and time to go to bed, so I went. I woke up\nin the morning to see a burly guy enter with a tray of breakfast. I\nattempted to engage him in light conversation but he did not even let on\nthat I was in the cell. Later he removed the tray as silently as he'd\nbrought it, and I was left with another four hours of utter boredom\nuntil the same bird returned with a light lunch. Six hours after lunch\ncame a slightly more substantial dinner, but no talk.\n\nBy bedtime the second night I was getting stir-crazy.\n\nI hit the sack at about nine thirty, and tossed and turned, unable to\ndrop off because I was not actually tired. I was also wondering when\nthey'd come around with their brain-washing crew, or maybe someone who'd\nenter with an ultimatum.\n\nOn the following morning, the tray-bearer was Dr. Thorndyke, who sat on\nthe chair on the outside of my bars and looked at me silently. I tried\ngiving him stare for stare, but eventually I gave up and said, \"So now\nwhere do we go?\"\n\n\"Cornell, you're in a bad spot of your own making.\"\n\n\"Could be,\" I admitted.\n\n\"And yet, really, you're more of a victim of circumstances.\"\n\n\"Forgetting all the sideplay, I'm a prisoner,\" I told him curtly. \"Let's\nface a few facts, Thorndyke, and stop tossing this guff.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he said shortly, \"The facts are these: We would prefer that\nyou help us willingly. We'd further prefer to have you as you are. That\nis, un-reoriented mentally.\"\n\n\"You couldn't afford to trust me,\" I grunted.\n\n\"Maybe we can. It's no secret that we've latched on to quite a number of\nyour friends. Let's assume that they will all be well-treated if you\nagree to join us willingly.\"\n\n\"I'm sure that the attitude of any of my friends is such that they'd\nprefer me to stand my ground rather than betray their notions of right\nand wrong.\" I told him.\n\n\"That's a foolish premise,\" he replied. \"You could no more prevail\nagainst us than you could single-handedly overthrow the Government.\nHaving faced that fact, it becomes sound and sensible to accept the\npremise and then see what sort of niche you can carve out of the new\norder.\"\n\n\"I don't like your new order,\" I grunted.\n\n\"Many people will not,\" he admitted. \"But then, people do not really\nknow what's good for them.\"\n\nI almost laughed at him. \"Look,\" I said, \"I'd rather make my own\nignorant mistakes than to have some Great Father supervise my life. And\nspeaking of fathers, we've both got to admit that God Himself permits us\nthe complete freedom of our wills.\"\n\nThorndyke sneered at me. \"If we're to quote the Scripture,\" he said\nsourly, \"I'll point out that 'The Lord Thy God is a jealous God,\nvisiting His wrath even upon seven generations of those who hate Him.'\"\n\n\"Granted,\" I replied calmly, \"But whether we love Him or hate Him is\nentirely up to our own particular notion. Now--\"\n\n\"Cornell, stop talking like an idiot. Here, too, you can take your\nchoice. I'm not ordering you. I'm just trying to point out that whether\nyou go on suffering or enjoying life is entirely up to your own\ndecision. And also your decision will help or hinder others.\"\n\n\"You're entirely too Godlike,\" I told him.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"think it over.\"\n\n\"Go to the devil!\"\n\n\"Now, that's a very weak response,\" he said loftily, \"Doing nobody any\ngood or harm. Just talk. So stop gabbing and think.\"\n\nThorndyke left me with my thoughts. Sure, I had bargaining power, but it\nwas no good. I'd be useful only until they discovered some method of\ninoculating normal flesh with Mekstrom's Disease, and once that was\ntaken care of, Steve Cornell would be a burden upon their resources.\n\nSo that was the morning of my third day of incarceration and nothing\nmore took place all day. They didn't even give me anything to read, and\nI almost went nuts. You have no idea of how long fourteen hours can be\nuntil you've been sitting in a cell with absolutely nothing to do. I\nexercised by chinning myself on the bars and playing gymnastics. I\nwanted to run but there was not enough room. The physical thrill I got\nout of being able to chin myself with one hand wore off after a half\nhundred pull-ups because it was no great feat for a Mekstrom. I did\npush-ups and bridges and other stunts until I was bored again.\n\nAnd all the while, my thinking section was going around and around. The\none main point that I kept coming back to was a very unpleasant future\nto face:\n\nIt was certain that no matter what I did, nor how I argued, I was going\nto help them out. Either I would do it willingly or they'd grow tired of\nthe lecture routine and take me in for a mental re-evaluation, after\nwhich (Being not-Steve Cornell any more) I'd join their ranks and do\ntheir bidding. About the only thing I could look at with self-confidence\nwas my determination to hold out. If I was going to join them, it would\nbe after I were no longer the man I am, but reoriented into whatever\ndesign they wanted. And that resolve was weakened by the normal human\nwill to live. You can't make a horse drink water, but you can lead a\nhuman being to a well and he will drink it dry if you keep a shotgun\npointed in his direction.\n\nAnd so it ended up with my always wondering if, when the cards were all\ndealt out face up, whether I would have the guts to keep on saying 'No'\nright up to the point where I walked into their department of\nbrain-washing. In fact, I was rather afraid that in the last moment I'd\nweaken, just to stay being me.\n\nThat uncertainty of mine was, of course, just the idea they wanted to\nnourish in my mind. They were doing it by leaving me alone with my\nmental merry-go-round.\n\nAgain I hit the sack out of sheer boredom and I turned and tossed for\nwhat seemed like hours before I dropped off to sleep, wondering and\ndreaming about who was to be the next visitor with a bill of goods to\nsell.\n\nThe next visitor came in about midnight, or thereabouts. I woke up with\nthe realization that someone had come in through the outer door and was\nstanding there in the semi-dark caused by a bright moon shining in\nthrough my barred window.\n\n\"Steve,\" she said, in a near whisper.\n\n\"Go away,\" I told her. \"Haven't you done enough already?\"\n\n\"Oh, please, Steve. I've got to talk to you.\"\n\nI sat on the edge of my bunk and looked at her. She was fully dressed;\nher light printed silk was of the same general pattern and fit that she\npreferred. In fact, Catherine looked as I'd always seen her, and as I'd\npictured her during the long hopeless weeks of our separation.\n\n\"You've got something to add?\" I asked her coldly.\n\n\"I've got to make you understand, Steve,\" she pleaded.\n\n\"Understand what?\" I snapped. \"I know already. You deliberately set out\nto marry, or else-how tie some emotional cable onto me. God knows that\nyou succeeded. If it hadn't been for that accident, I'd have been nailed\ndown tight.\"\n\n\"That part is true,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Naturally, you've got justification.\"\n\n\"Well, I have.\"\n\n\"So has any burglar.\"\n\nShe shook her head at me. \"Steve, you don't really understand. If only\nyou could read my mind and know the truth--\"\n\nShe let this trail off in a helpless awkwardness. It was one of those\nstatements that are meaningless because it can be said by either friend\nor foe and cannot be checked.\n\nI just looked at her and suddenly remembered something:\n\nThis was the first time in my life that I was in a position to do some\nverbal fencing with a telepath on even terms. I could say 'Yes' and\nthink 'No' with absolute impunity. In fact, I might even have had an\nedge, since as a poor non-telepath I did have some training in\nsubterfuge, falsehood, and diplomatic maneuver that the telepath\ncouldn't have. Catherine and I, at long last, were in the position of\nthe so-called good old days when boys and girls couldn't really know the\ntruth about one another's real thoughts.\n\n\"So what's this truth?\" I demanded.\n\n\"Steve, answer me truly. Have you ever been put on an odious job, only\nto find that the job is really pleasant?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then hear me out. I--in fact, no woman--takes kindly to being directed\nto do what I did. I was told to meet you, to marry--\" Her face looked\nflustered and it might have been a bit flushed for all I knew. I\ncouldn't see color enough in the dim light to be sure. \"--And then I met\nyou, Steve, and I found out that you were really a very nice sort of\nguy.\"\n\n\"Well, thanks.\"\n\n\"Don't be bitter. Hear the truth. If Otto Mekstrom had not existed, if\nthere were no such thing as Mekstrom's Disease, and I had met you freely\nand openly as men and women meet, I'd have come to feel the same, Steve.\nI must make you understand that my emotional attachment to you was not\nincreased nor decreased by the fact that my physical actions were\ndirected at you. If anything, my job was just rendered pleasantly\neasier.\"\n\nI grunted. \"And so you were made happy.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she whispered. \"And I was going to marry you and live honestly\nwith you--\"\n\n\"Heck of a marriage with the wife in the Medical Center for Mekstrom's\nDisease and our first child--\"\n\n\"Steve, you poor fool, don't you understand? If our child came as\npredicted, the first thing I'd do would be to have the child inoculate\nthe father? Then we'd be--\"\n\n\"Um,\" I grunted. \"I hadn't thought of that.\" This was a flat lie. I'd\nconsidered it a-plenty since my jailing here. Present the Medical Center\nwith a child, a Mekstrom, and a Carrier, and good old pappy would be no\nlonger needed.\n\n\"Well, after I found out all about you, Steve, that's what I had in\nmind. But now--\"\n\n\"Now what?\" I urged her gently. I had a hunch that she was leading up to\nsomething, but ducking shy about it until she managed to find out how I\nthought. It would have been all zero if we'd been in a clear area, but\nas it was I led her gently on.\n\n\"But now I've failed,\" she said with a slight wail.\n\n\"What do they do with failures?\" I asked harshly. \"Siberia? Or a gunny\nsack weighted down with an anvil? Or do they drum you out of the corps?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nI eyed her closely. I was forced to admit that no matter how Catherine\nthought, she was a mighty attractive dish from the physical standpoint.\nAnd regardless of the trouble she'd put me through, I could not overlook\nthe fact that I had been deep enough in love to plan elopement and\nmarriage. I'd held her slender body close, and either her response had\nbeen honestly warm or Catherine was an actress of very rare physical\nability. Scholar Phelps could hardly have picked a warmer temptress in\nthe first place; putting her onto me now was a stroke of near-genius.\n\nI got up from the edge of my bunk and faced her through my bars. She\ncame close, too, and we looked into each other's faces over a cross-rail\nof the heavy fence.\n\nI managed a wistful grin at her. \"You're not really a failure yet, are\nyou, kid?\"\n\n\"I don't quite know how to--to--\" she replied.\n\nI looked around my little cell with a gruesome gesture. \"This isn't my\nidea of a pleasant home. And yet it will be my home until someone\ndecides that I'm too expensive to keep.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she breathed.\n\nTaking the bit in my teeth, I said, \"Catherine even though--well, heck.\nI'd like to help you.\"\n\n\"You mean that?\" she asked in almost an eager voice.\n\n\"It's not impossible to forget that we were eloping when all this\nstarted.\"\n\n\"It all seems so long ago,\" she said with a thick voice. \"And I wish we\nwere back there--no, Steve, I wish Mekstrom's Disease had never\nhappened--I wish--\"\n\n\"Stop wishing and think,\" I told her half-humorously. \"If there were no\nMekstrom's Disease, the chances are that we'd never have met in the\nfirst place.\"\n\n\"That's the cruel part of it all,\" she cried. And I mean _cried_.\n\nI rapped on the metal bars with a fist. \"So here we are,\" I said\nunhappily. \"I can't help you now, Catherine.\"\n\nShe put her hands through the bars and held my face between them. She\nlooked searching into my eyes, as if straining to force her blocked\ntelepath sense through the deadness of the area. She leaned against the\nsteel but the barrier was very effective; our lips met through the cold\nmetal. It was a very unsatisfactory kiss because we had to purse our\nlips like a pair of piccolo players to make them meet. It was like\nmaking love through a keyhole.\n\nThis unsatisfactory lovemaking did not last long. Unsteadily, Catherine\nsaid, \"I want you, Steve.\"\n\nInwardly I grinned, and then with the same feeling as if I'd laughed out\nloud at a funeral, I said, \"Through these steel bars?\"\n\nShe brought out a little cylindrical key. Then went to a brass wall\nplate beside the outer door, inserted the key, and turned. The sliding\ndoor to my cell opened on noiseless machined slides.\n\nThen with a careful look at me, Catherine slipped a little shutter over\nthe glass bull's eye in the door. Her hand reached up to a hidden toggle\nabove the door and as she snapped it, a thick cover surged out above the\nspeaker, television lens, and microphone grille, curved down and shut\noff the tell-tales with a cushioned sound. Apparently the top management\nof the joint used these cells for other things than mere containment of\nunruly prisoners. I almost grinned; the society that Scholar Phelps\nproposed was not the kind that flourished in an atmosphere of trust, or\nprivacy--except for the top brass.\n\nCatherine turned from her switch plate and came across the floor with\nher face lifted and her lips parted.\n\n\"Hold me, Steve.\"\n\nMy hand came forward in a short jab that caught her dead center in the\nplexus below the ribs. Her breath caught in one strangled gasp and her\neyes went glassy. She swayed stiffly in half-paralysis. My other hand\ncame up, closing as it rose, until it became a fist that connected in a\nshoulder-jarring wallop on the side of her jaw. Her head snapped up and\nher knees caved in. She folded from the hips and went down bonelessly.\nFrom her throat came the bubbly sound of air being forced painfully\nthrough a flaccid wet tube.\n\nI jumped outside of the cell barrier because I was certain that they had\nsome means of closing the cell from a master control center. I don't\nknow much about penology, but that's the way I'd do it. I was\nhalf-surprised that I'd been able to get away with this much.\n\nCatherine stirred and moaned, and I stopped long enough to take the key\nout of the wall plate. The cell door closed on its silent slides.\n\nI had hardly been able to more than run the zipper up my shirt when the\ndoor opened and I had to dance like a fool to get behind it. The door\nadmitted a flood of bright light from the corridor, and Dr. James\nThorndyke. The cell door must have been bugged.\n\nThorndyke came in behind a large automatic clutched in one nervous fist.\nHe strained his eyes at the gloom that was not cut by the ribbon of\nlight.\n\nAnd then I cut him down with a solid slice of my right hand to the base\nof his neck. I remembered to jump off the ground as the blow went home;\nthere was a sickening crunch of bone and muscle as Thorndyke caved\nforward to the floor. He dropped the gun, luckily, as his body began to\ntwitch and kick spasmodically as the life drained out of him.\n\nI re-swallowed a mouthful of bitter bile as I reached down to pick up\nhis gun. Then the room got hot and unbearably small and I felt a frantic\nurge to leave, to close the door upon that sight.\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\n\nI was yards away from my door before my panic left me. Then I remembered\nwhere and who I was and took a fast look around. There was no one else\nin the corridor, of course, or I would not have been able to cut and run\nas I had. But I looked around anyway until my reasoning power told me\nthat I had done little to help my position.\n\nLike the canary, my plans for escape ended once I was outside of my\ncage. I literally did not know what to do with my new-found freedom. One\nthing was becoming painfully obvious: I'd be pinned down tight once I\nput a foot outside of the dead area in which this building was\nconstructed. What I needed was friends, arms, ammunition, and a good,\nsolid plan of escape. I had neither; unless you call my jailed friends\nsuch help. And there I could not go; the tell-tales would give me away\nto the master control center before I could raise my small--and\nunarmed--army.\n\nSo I stood there in the brightly lighted corridor and tried to think. I\ngot nowhere, but I was driven to action again by the unmistakable sound\nof the elevator at the end of the corridor.\n\nI eyed the various cell doors with suspicion; opening any but an empty\nroom would cause some comment from the occupant, which again would give\nme away. Nor did I have time to canvass the joint by peeking into the\none-way bull's eyes, peering into a semi-gloom to see which room was\nempty.\n\nSo instead of hiding in the corridor, I sloped towards the elevator and\nthe stairwell that surrounded it, hoping that I could make it before the\nelevator rose to my floor.\n\nI know that my passage must have sounded like a turbojet in full flight,\nbut I made the stairway and took a headlong leap down the first short\nflight of stairs just as the elevator door rolled open. I hit the wall\nwith a bumping crash that jarred my senses, but I kept my feet and\nlooked back up the stairs.\n\nI caught a flash of motion; a guard sauntering past the top of the well,\na cigarette in one hand and a lazy-looking air about him. He was\nexpecting no trouble, and so I gave him none.\n\nI crept up the stairs and poked my head out just at the floor level.\n\nThe guard, obviously confident that nothing, but nothing, could ever\nhappen in this welded metal crib, jauntily peered into a couple of the\nrooms at random, took a long squint at the room I'd recently vacated,\nand then went on to the end of the hall where he stuck a key in a\nsignal-box. On his way back he paused again to peer into my room,\nstraining to see if he could peer past the little shutter over the\nbull's eye. Then he shrugged unhappily, and started to return.\n\nI loped down the stairs to the second floor and waited. The elevator\ncame down, stopped, and the guard repeated his desultory search, not\nstopping to pry into any darkened rooms.\n\nJust above the final, first-floor flight, I stopped and sprawled on the\nfloor with only my head and the nose of my gun over the top step. Below\nwas the guard's desk and standing beside the desk with anger in every\nline of his ugly face was Scholar Phelps!\n\nThe elevator came down, stopped, and the guard walked out, to be nailed\nby Phelps.\n\n\"Your job,\" snapped the good Scholar coldly, \"says you are to walk.\"\n\n\"Well, er--sir--it's--\"\n\n\"Walk!\" stormed Phelps angrily. \"You can't cover that stairway in the\nelevator, you fumbling idiot.\"\n\n\"But, sir--\"\n\n\"Someone could easily come down while you go up.\"\n\n\"I know that, sir, but--\"\n\n\"Then why do you disobey?\" roared Phelps.\n\n\"Well, you see, sir, I know how this place is built and no one has ever\nmade it yet. Who could?\" The guard looked mystified.\n\nPhelps had to face that fact. He did not accept it gracefully. \"My\norders are orders,\" he said stiffly. \"You'll follow them. To the last\nletter.\"\n\n\"Yes sir. I will.\"\n\n\"See that you do. Now, I'm going up. I'll ride and you walk. Meet me on\nthe fourth and bring the elevator down with you.\"\n\n\"Yessir.\"\n\nI sloped upstairs like a scared rabbit. Up to the third again where I\nmoved down the corridor and slipped into the much-too-thin niche made by\na door. Stolidly the guard came up the stairs, crossed in front of the\nelevator with his back to me, turned the far corner and went on up to\nthe fourth.\n\nAs his feet started up the stairs, I was behind him; by the time he\nreached the top, I was half way up.\n\nPhelps said, \"Now, from this moment on, Waldron, you'll follow every\norder to the absolute letter. And when I ring, don't make the error of\nbringing the elevator. Send it. It'll come up and stop without a pilot.\"\n\n\"Yes sir. I'm sorry sir. But you understand, sir, there isn't really\nmuch to guard, sir.\"\n\n\"Then guard nothing. But guard it well, because a man in your position\nis gauged in success by the amount of boredom he creates for himself.\"\n\nThe guard started down and I darted up to poke my head out to see where\nPhelps was going. As I neared the floor level, I had a shock like\nsomeone hurling twenty gallons of ice water in my face. The top floor\nwas the end of the dead area, and I--\n\n--pulled my head down into the murk like a diver taking a plunge.\n\nSo I stood there making like a guppy with my head, sounding out the\nboundary of that deadness, ducking down as soon as the mental murk gave\nme a faint perception of the wall and ceiling above me. Then I'd move\naside and sound it again. Eventually I found a little billowing furrow\nthat rose above the floor level and I crawled out along the floor, still\nsounding and moving cautiously with my body hidden in the deadness that\nrose and fell like a cloud of murky mental smoke to my sense of\nperception.\n\nI would have looked silly to any witness; wallowing along the floor like\na porpoise acting furtive in the bright lights.\n\nBut then I couldn't go any farther; the deadness sank below the floor\nlevel and left me looking along a bare floor that was also bare to my\nsense of perception.\n\nI shoved my head out of the dead zone and took a fast dig, then dropped\nback in again and lay there re-constructing what I'd perceived mentally.\nI did it the second time and the third, each time making a rapid scan of\nsome portion of that fourth floor.\n\nIn three fast swings, I collected a couple of empty offices, a very\ncomplete hospital set-up operating room, and a place that looked like a\nconsultation theatre.\n\nOn my fourth scan, I whipped past Scholar Phelps, who was apparently\ndeep in some personal interest.\n\nI rose at once and strode down the hall and snapped the door open just\nas Phelps' completely unexpecting mind grasped the perceptive fact that\nsomeone was coming down his hallway wearing a great big forty five\nautomatic.\n\n\"Freeze!\" I snapped.\n\n\"Put that weapon down, Mr. Cornell. It, nor its use, will get your\nfreedom.\"\n\n\"Maybe all I want out of life is to see you leave it,\" I told him.\n\n\"You'd not be that foolish, I'm sure,\" he said.\n\n\"I might.\"\n\nHe laughed, with all the self-confidence in the world. \"Mr. Cornell, you\nhave too much will to live. You're not the martyr type.\"\n\n\"I might turn out to be the cornered-rat type,\" I told him seriously.\n\"So play it cagey, Phelps.\"\n\n\"Scholar Phelps, please.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't disgrace the medical profession,\" I told him. \"So--\"\n\n\"So what do you propose to do about this?\"\n\n\"I'm getting out.\"\n\n\"Don't be ridiculous. One step out of this building and you'll return\nwithin a half minute. How did you get out?\"\n\n\"I was seduced out. Now--\"\n\n\"I'd advise you to surrender; to stop this hopeless attempt; to put that\nweapon down. You cannot escape. There are, in this building, your mental\nand intellectual superiors whose incarceration bear me witness.\"\n\nI eyed him coldly and quietly. \"I'm not convinced. I'm out. And if you\ncould take a dig below you'd see a dead man and an unconscious woman to\nbear me witness. I broke your Dr. Thorndyke's neck with a chop of my\nbare hand, Phelps; I knocked Catherine cold with a fist. This thing\nmight not kill you, but I'm a Mekstrom, too, and so help me I can cool\nyou down but good.\"\n\n\"Violence will get you nothing.\"\n\n\"Try my patience. I'll bet my worthless hide on it.\" Then I grinned at\nhim. \"Oh, it isn't so worthless, is it?\"\n\n\"One cry from me, Mr. Cornell, and--\"\n\n\"And you'll not live to see what happens. I've killed once tonight. I\ndidn't like it. But the idea is not as new now as it was then. I'll kill\nyou, Phelps, if for no other reason than merely to keep my word.\"\n\nWith a sneer, Phelps turned to his desk and I stabbed my perception\nbehind the papers and stuff to the call button; then I launched myself\nacross the room like a rocket, swinging my gun hand as I soared. The\nsteel caught him on the side of the head and drove him back from his\ncall button before his finger could press it. Then I let him have a fist\nin the belly because the pistol swat hadn't much more than dazed him.\nThe fist did it. He crumpled in a heap and fought for breath\nunconsciously.\n\nI turned to the wall he'd been eyeing with so much attention.\n\nThere was row upon row of small kine tubes, each showing the dark\ninterior of a cell. Below each was a row of pilot lights, all dark.\n\nOn his desk was a large bank of push buttons, a speaker, and a\nmicrophone. And beside the push button set-up was a ledger containing a\nlist of names with their cell numbers.\n\nI found Marian Harrison; pushed her button, and heard her ladylike snore\nfrom the speaker. A green lamp winked under one of the kine tubes and I\nwalked over and looked into the darkened cell to see her familiar hair\nsprawled over a thick pillow.\n\nI went to the desk and snapped on the microphone.\n\n\"Marian,\" I said. \"MARIAN! HEY! MARIAN HARRISON!\"\n\nIn the picture tube there was a stir, then she sat up and looked around\nin a sort of daze.\n\n\"Marian, this is Steve Cornell, but don't--\"\n\n\"Steve!\"\n\n\"--cry out,\" I finished uselessly.\n\n\"Where are you?\" she asked in a whisper.\n\n\"I'm in the con room.\"\n\n\"But how on Earth--?\"\n\n\"No time to gab. I'll be down in a rush with the key. Get dressed!\"\n\n\"Yes, Steve.\"\n\nI took off in a headlong rush with the 'Hotel Register' in one hand. I\nmade the third floor and Marian's cell in slightly more than nothing\nflat, but she was ready when I came barging into her room. She was out\nof the cell before it hit the backstop and following me down the hall\ntowards her brother's room.\n\n\"What happened?\" she asked breathlessly.\n\n\"Later,\" I told her. I opened Phillip Harrison's cell. \"You go wake up\nFred Macklin and tell him to come here. Then get the Macklin\ngirl--Alice, it says here--and the pair of you wake up others and start\nsending 'em up stairs. I'll call you on the telltale as soon as I can.\"\n\nMarian took off with the key and the register and I started to shake\nPhillip Harrison's shoulder. \"Wake up!\" I cried. \"Wake up, Phillip!\"\n\nPhillip made a noise like a baby seal.\n\n\"Wake up!\"\n\n\"Wha--?\"\n\n\"It's Steve Cornell. Wake up!\"\n\nWith a rough shake of his head, Phillip groaned and unwound himself out\nof a tangle of bedclothing. He looked at me through half-closed glassy\neyes. Then he straightened and made a perilous course to the washstand\nwhere he sopped a towel in cold water and applied it to his face, neck,\nand shoulders. When he dropped the towel in the sink, his expression was\nfresher and his eyes were mingled curiosity and amazement.\n\n\"What gives?\" he asked, starting to dress in a hurry.\n\n\"I busted out, slugged Scholar Phelps, and took over the master control\nroom. I need help. We can't keep it long unless we move fast.\"\n\n\"Yeah man. Any moving will be fast,\" he said sourly. \"Got any plans?\"\n\n\"We've--\"\n\nThe door opened to let Fred Macklin enter. He carried his shirt and had\nbeen dressing on the run. \"What goes on?\" he asked.\n\n\"Look,\" I said quickly. \"If I have to stop and give anybody a rundown,\nwe'll have no time to do what has to be done. There are a couple of\nsources of danger. One is the guard down at the bottom of the stairway.\nThe other is the possible visitor. You get a couple of other young,\nambitious fellows and push that guard post over, but quick.\"\n\n\"Right. And you?\"\n\n\"I've got to keep our hostage cold,\" I snapped. \"And I'm running the\nshow by virtue of being the guy that managed to bust loose.\"\n\nIn the hallway there was movement, but I left it to head back to Scholar\nPhelps. I got there in time to hear him groan and make scratching noises\non the carpet. I took no chances; I cooled him down with a short jab to\nthe pit of the stomach and doubled him over again.\n\nHe was sleeping painfully but soundlessly when Marian came in.\n\nI turned to her. \"You're supposed to be waking up--\"\n\n\"I gave the key and the register to Jo Anne Tweedy,\" she said. \"Jo\nAnne's the brash young teenager you took a bump with in Ohio. She's\ncompetent, Steve. And she's got the Macklin twins to help her. Waking up\nthe camp is a job for the junior division.\" She eyed the recumbent\nPhelps distastefully. \"What have you in mind for him?\"\n\n\"He's valuable,\" I said. \"We'll use him to buy our freedom.\"\n\nThe door opened again, interrupting Marian. It was Jonas Harrison. He\nstood there in the frame of the door and looked at us with a sort of\ngrim smile. I had never met the old patriarch of the Harrison Family\nbefore, but he lived up to my every expectation. He stood tall and\nstraight; topped by a wealth of snow white hair, white eyebrows, and the\ntouch of a white moustache. His eyes contrasted with the white; a rich\nand startling brown.\n\nThis was a man to whom I could hand the basic problem of engineering our\nfinal escape; Jonas Harrison was capable of plotting an airtight\ngetaway.\n\nHis voice was rich and resonant; it had a lift in its tone that sounded\nas though his self-confidence had never been in danger of a set-back:\n\"Well, son, you seem to have accomplished quite a job this night. What\nshall we do next?\"\n\n\"Get the devil out of here,\" I replied--\n\n--wondering just exactly how I'd known so instantly that this was Jonas\nHarrison. The rich and resonant voice had flicked a subsurface\nrecollection on a faint, raw spot and now something important was\nswimming around in the mire of my mind trying to break loose and come\nclear.\n\nI turned from the sword-sharp brown eyes and looked at Marian. She was\nalmost as I had first seen her: Not much make-up if any at all, her hair\nfree of fancy dressing but neat, her legs were bare and healthy-tanned.\n\nI looked at her, and for a half dozen heartbeats her image faded from my\nsight, replaced by the well remembered figure of Catherine as I had\nknown her first. It was a dizzy-making montage because my perception\nsenses the real figure of Marian, superimposed on the visual\nmemory-image of Catherine. Then the false sight faded and both\nperception and eyesight focused upon the true person of Marian Harrison.\n\nMarian stood there, her face softly proud. Her eyes were looking\nstraight into mine, as if she were mentally urging me to fight that\nhidden memory into full recollection.\n\nThen I both saw and perceived something that I had never noticed before.\nA fine golden chain hung around her throat, its pendant hidden from\nsight beneath the edge of her bodice. But my sense of perception dug a\nmodest diamond, and I could even dig the tiny initials engraved in the\nmetal circlet:\n\n     SC-MH\n\nTo dig anything that fine, I knew that it must be of importance to me.\nAnd then I knew that it had once been so very personally my own\nbusiness, for the submerged recollection came bursting up to the top of\nmy mind. Marian Henderson had been mine once long ago!\n\nBoldly I stepped forward and took the chain between my fingers. I\nsnapped it, and held the ring. \"Will you wear it again, my dear?\"\n\nShe held up her left hand for me to slip it on. \"Steve,\" she breathed,\n\"I've never stopped wearing it, not really.\"\n\n\"But I didn't see it until now--\"\n\nJonas Harrison said, \"No, Steve, you couldn't see it until you\nremembered.\"\n\n\"But look--\"\n\n\"Blame me,\" he said in his firm determined voice. \"The story begins and\nends with you, Steve. When Marian contracted Mekstrom's Disease, she\nherself insisted that you be spared the emotional pain that the rest of\nus could not avoid. So I erased her from your mind, Steve, and submerged\nany former association. Then when the Highways in Hiding came to take us\nin, I left it that way because Marian was still as unattainable to you\nas if she were dead. If an apology is needed, I'll only ask that you\nforgive my tampering with your mind and personality.\"\n\n\"Apologize?\" I exploded. \"I'm here, we're here, and you've just provided\nme with a way out of this mousetrap!\"\n\n\"A way out?\" he murmured, in that absent way that telepaths have when\nthey're concentrating on another mind. Fast comprehension dawned in the\nsharp brown eyes and he looked even more self-confident and determined.\nMarian leaned back in my arms to look into my eyes. \"Steve,\" she cried,\n\"it's simply got to work!\" Gloria Farrow merely said, \"He'll have to\nhave medication, of course,\" and went briskly to a wall cabinet and\nbegan to fiddle with medical tools. Howard Macklin and Jonas Harrison\nwent into a deep telepathic conference that was interrupted only when\nJonas Harrison turned to Phillip to say, \"You'll have to provide us with\nuninterrupted time, somehow.\"\n\nMarian disengaged herself reluctantly and started to propel me out of\nthe room. \"Go help him, Steve. What we are going to do is not for any\nnon-telepath to watch.\"\n\nOutside, Phillip threatened me with the guard's signal-box key. \"Mind\ntelling a non-telepath what the devil you cooked up?\"\n\nI smiled. \"If your father has the mental power to erase Marian from my\nmind, he also has the power to do a fine reorientation job on Scholar\nPhelps. Once we get the spiderwebs cleaned out of the top dog, we start\ndown the pyramid, line by line and echelon by echelon, with each\nreoriented recruit adding to our force. Once we get this joint operating\non the level, we can all go to work for the rest of the human race!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere is little left to tell. The Medical Center and the Highways in\nHiding are one agency dedicated to the conquest of the last and most\npuzzling of the diseases and maladies that beset Mankind. We are no\ncloser to a solution than we ever were, and so I am still a very busy\nman.\n\nI have written this account and disclosed our secret because we want no\nmore victims of Mekstrom's Disease to suffer.\n\nSo I will write finish with one earnest plea and one ray of hope:\n\nPlease do not follow one of our Highways unless you are already\ninfected. Since I cannot hope to inoculate the entire human race, and\nwill not pick or choose certain worthy types for special attention, I\nwill deal only with those folks who find Mekstrom's Disease among their\nimmediate family. Such people need never be parted from their loved\nones. The rest of you will have to wait your turn.\n\nBut we'll get to it sooner or later. Thirty days ago, Steve, Junior, was\nborn. He's a healthy little Mekstrom, and like his pappy, Steve Junior\nis a carrier, too.\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n[Transcriber's note: Back cover]\n\n\n\n\nQUEST IMPOSSIBLE\n\n\nSomeone had stolen an important part of Steve Cornell's life.\n\nIt was bad enough when his fianc\u00e9e vanished. It was infinitely worse\nwhen everyone in the world insisted it couldn't have happened the way he\nknew it had.\n\nIn a world where ESP and telepathy were normal, it was difficult to keep\nsecrets. But Steve's search for his missing sweetheart brought him to\nthe threshold of one of the greatest secrets of all time. And it was\nobvious that somebody would stop at nothing to keep him from uncovering\nit.\n\nWhat were the oddly sinister symbols along otherwise ordinary roads?\nWhat was behind the spreading plague called Mekstrom's Disease? Why were\nthere \"blank\" spots where telepathy didn't work? Who was the elusive\nenemy with powers even beyond those ESP had bestowed on mankind?\n\nAnd, most important of all ... could Steve find that enemy before they\nmade him vanish too?\n\nA Lancer Book \u00b7 Never Before Complete In Paperback\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Highways in Hiding, by George Oliver Smith\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HIGHWAYS IN HIDING ***\n\n***** This file should be named 20519-8.txt or 20519-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/0/5/1/20519/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
