The Bending of the Twig_\n\nFrom a very early period of my life the entire bent of my inclinations\nhad been towards microscopic investigations. When I was not more than\nten years old, a distant relative of our family, hoping to astonish\nmy inexperience, constructed a simple microscope for me, by drilling\nin a disk of copper a small hole, in which a drop of pure water was\nsustained by capillary attraction. This very primitive apparatus,\nmagnifying some fifty diameters, presented, it is true, only indistinct\nand imperfect forms, but still sufficiently wonderful to work up my\nimagination to a preternatural state of excitement.\n\nSeeing me so interested in this rude instrument, my cousin explained\nto me all that he knew about the principles of the microscope, related\nto me a few of the wonders which had been accomplished through its\nagency, and ended by promising to send me one regularly constructed,\nimmediately on his return to the city. I counted the days, the hours,\nthe minutes, that intervened between that promise and his departure.\n\nMeantime I was not idle. Every transparent substance that bore the\nremotest resemblance to a lens I eagerly seized upon, and employed\nin vain attempts to realize that instrument, the theory of whose\nconstruction I as yet only vaguely comprehended. All panes of glass\ncontaining those oblate spheroidal knots familiarly known as \"bull's\neyes\" were ruthlessly destroyed, in the hope of obtaining lenses of\nmarvelous power. I even went so far as to extract the crystalline humor\nfrom the eyes of fishes and animals, and endeavored to press it into\nthe microscopic service. I plead guilty to having stolen the glasses\nfrom my Aunt Agatha's spectacles, with a dim idea of grinding them\ninto lenses of wondrous magnifying properties--in which attempt it is\nscarcely necessary to say that I totally failed.\n\nAt last the promised instrument came. It was of that order known\nas Field's simple microscope, and had cost perhaps about fifteen\ndollars. As far as educational purposes went, a better apparatus could\nnot have been selected. Accompanying it was a small treatise on the\nmicroscope--its history, uses, and discoveries. I comprehended then\nfor the first time the _Arabian Nights Entertainments_. The dull veil\nof ordinary existence that hung across the world seemed suddenly to\nroll away, and to lay bare a land of enchantments. I felt towards my\ncompanions as the seer might feel towards the ordinary masses of men.\nI held conversations with nature in a tongue which they could not\nunderstand. I was in daily communication with living wonders, such as\nthey never imagined in their wildest visions. I penetrated beyond the\nexternal portal of things, and roamed through the sanctuaries. Where\nthey beheld only a drop of rain slowly rolling down the window-glass,\nI saw a universe of beings animated with all the passions common to\nphysical life, and convulsing their minute sphere with struggles as\nfierce and protracted as those of men. In the common spots of mold,\nwhich my mother, good housekeeper that she was, fiercely scooped away\nfrom her jam pots, there abode for me, under the name of mildew,\nenchanted gardens, filled with dells and avenues of the densest foliage\nand most astonishing verdure, while from the fantastic boughs of these\nmicroscopic forests hung strange fruits glittering with green, and\nsilver and gold.\n\nIt was no scientific thirst that at this time filled my mind. It was\nthe pure enjoyment of a poet to whom a world of wonders has been\ndisclosed. I talked of my solitary pleasures to none. Alone with my\nmicroscope, I dimmed my sight, day after day and night after night,\nporing over the marvels which it unfolded to me. I was like one who,\nhaving discovered the ancient Eden still existing in all its primitive\nglory, should resolve to enjoy it in solitude, and never betray to\nmortal the secret of its locality. The rod of my life was bent at this\nmoment. I destined myself to be a microscopist.\n\nOf course, like every novice, I fancied myself a discoverer. I was\nignorant at the time of the thousands of acute intellects engaged in\nthe same pursuit as myself, and with the advantage of instruments a\nthousand times more powerful than mine. The names of Leeuwenhoek,\nWilliamson, Spencer, Ehrenberg, Schultz, Dujardin, Schacht and\nSchleiden were then entirely unknown to me, or if known, I was ignorant\nof their patient and wonderful researches. In every fresh specimen of\ncryptogamia which I placed beneath my instrument I believed that I\ndiscovered wonders of which the world was as yet ignorant. I remember\nwell the thrill of delight and admiration that shot through me the\nfirst time that I discovered the common wheel animalcule (_Rotifera\nvulgaris_) expanding and contracting its flexible spokes, and seemingly\nrotating through the water. Alas! as I grew older, and obtained some\nworks treating of my favorite study, I found that I was only on the\nthreshold of a science to the investigation of which some of the\ngreatest men of the age were devoting their lives and intellects.\n\nAs I grew up, my parents, who saw but little likelihood of anything\npractical resulting from the examination of bits of moss and drops of\nwater through a brass tube and a piece of glass, were anxious that I\nshould choose a profession. It was their desire that I should enter the\ncounting-house of my uncle, Ethan Blake, a prosperous merchant, who\ncarried on business in New York. This suggestion I decisively combated.\nI had no taste for trade; I should only make a failure; in short, I\nrefused to become a merchant.\n\nBut it was necessary for me to select some pursuit. My parents were\nstaid New England people, who insisted on the necessity of labor; and\ntherefore, although, thanks to the bequest of my poor Aunt Agatha, I\nshould, on coming of age, inherit a small fortune sufficient to place\nme above want, it was decided that, instead of waiting for this,\nI should act the nobler part, and employ the intervening years in\nrendering myself independent.\n\nAfter much cogitation I complied with the wishes of my family, and\nselected a profession. I determined to study medicine at the New York\nAcademy. This disposition of my future suited me. A removal from my\nrelatives would enable me to dispose of my time as I pleased without\nfear of detection. As long as I paid my Academy fees, I might shirk\nattending the lectures if I chose; and, as I never had the remotest\nintention of standing an examination, there was no danger of my being\n\"plucked.\" Besides, a metropolis was the place for me. There I could\nobtain excellent instruments, the newest publications, intimacy with\nmen of pursuits kindred with my own--in short, all things necessary\nto insure a profitable devotion of my life to my beloved science. I\nhad an abundance of money, few desires that were not bounded by my\nilluminating mirror on one side and my object-glass on the other; what,\ntherefore, was to prevent my becoming an illustrious investigator of\nthe veiled worlds? It was with the most buoyant hope that I left my New\nEngland home and established myself in New York.\n\n\n_2. The Longing of a Man of Science_\n\nMy first step, of course, was to find suitable apartments. These I\nobtained, after a couple of days' search, in Fourth Avenue; a very\npretty second-floor unfurnished, containing sitting-room, bedroom,\nand a smaller apartment which I intended to fit up as a laboratory.\nI furnished my lodgings simply, but rather elegantly, and then\ndevoted all my energies to the adornment of the temple of my worship.\nI visited Pike, the celebrated optician, and passed in review his\nsplendid collection of microscopes--Field's Compound, Hingham's,\nSpencer's, Nachet's Binocular (that founded on the principles of the\nstereoscope), and at length fixed upon that form known as Spencer's\nTrunnion Microscope, as combining the greatest number of improvements\nwith an almost perfect freedom from tremor. Along with this I purchased\nevery possible accessory--draw-tubes, micrometers, a _camera-lucida_,\nleverstage, achromatic condensers, white cloud illuminators, prisms,\nparabolic condensers, polarizing apparatus, forceps, aquatic boxes,\nfishing-tubes, with a host of other articles, all of which would have\nbeen useful in the hands of an experienced microscopist, but, as I\nafterwards discovered, were not of the slightest present value to me.\nIt takes years of practise to know how to use a complicated microscope.\nThe optician looked suspiciously at me as I made these wholesale\npurchases. He evidently was uncertain whether to set me down as some\nscientific celebrity or a madman. I think he inclined to the latter\nbelief. I suppose I was mad. Every great genius is mad upon the subject\nin which he is greatest. The unsuccessful madman is disgraced and\ncalled a lunatic.\n\nMad or not, I set myself to work with a zeal which few scientific\nstudents have ever equaled. I had everything to learn relative to the\ndelicate study upon which I had embarked--a study involving the most\nearnest patience, the most rigid analytic powers, the steadiest hand,\nthe most untiring eye, the most refined and subtile manipulation.\n\nFor a long time half my apparatus lay inactively on the shelves of my\nlaboratory, which was now most amply furnished with every possible\ncontrivance for facilitating my investigations. The fact was that I did\nnot know how to use some of my scientific implements--never having been\ntaught microscopics--and those whose use I understood theoretically\nwere of little avail, until by practise I could attain the necessary\ndelicacy of handling. Still, such was the fury of my ambition, such\nthe untiring perseverance of my experiments, that, difficult of credit\nas it may be, in the course of one year I became theoretically and\npractically an accomplished microscopist.\n\nDuring this period of my labors, in which I submitted specimens of\nevery substance that came under my observation to the action of my\nlenses, I became a discoverer--in a small way, it is true, for I was\nvery young, but still a discoverer. It was I who destroyed Ehrenberg's\ntheory that the _Volvox globator_ was an animal, and proved that his\n\"monads\" with stomachs and eyes were merely phases of the formation\nof a vegetable cell, and were, when they reached their mature state,\nincapable of the act of conjugation, or any true generative act,\nwithout which no organism rising to any stage of life higher than\nvegetable can be said to be complete. It was I who resolved the\nsingular problem of rotation in the cells and hairs of plants into\nciliary attraction, in spite of the assertions of Mr. Wenham and\nothers, that my explanation was the result of an optical illusion.\n\nBut notwithstanding these discoveries, laboriously and painfully\nmade as they were, I felt horribly dissatisfied. At every step I\nfound myself stopped by the imperfections of my instruments. Like all\nactive microscopists, I gave my imagination full play. Indeed, it is\na common complaint against many such, that they supply the defects\nof their instruments with the creations of their brains. I imagined\ndepths beyond depths in nature which the limited power of my lenses\nprohibited me from exploring. I lay awake at night constructing\nimaginary microscopes of immeasurable power, with which I seemed\nto pierce through all the envelopes of matter down to its original\natom. How I cursed those imperfect mediums which necessity through\nignorance compelled me to use! How I longed to discover the secret of\nsome perfect lens, whose magnifying power should be limited only by\nthe resolvability of the object, and which at the same time should be\nfree from spherical and chromatic aberrations, in short from all the\nobstacles over which the poor microscopist finds himself continually\nstumbling! I felt convinced that the simple microscope, composed\nof a single lens of such vast yet perfect power, was possible of\nconstruction. To attempt to bring the compound microscope up to such a\npitch would have been commencing at the wrong end; this latter being\nsimply a partially successful endeavor to remedy those very defects of\nthe simple instrument, which, if conquered, would leave nothing to be\ndesired.\n\nIt was in this mood of mind that I became a constructive microscopist.\nAfter another year passed in this new pursuit, experimenting on every\nimaginable substance--glass, gems, flints, crystals, artificial\ncrystals formed of the alloy of various vitreous materials--in short,\nhaving constructed as many varieties of lenses as Argus had eyes, I\nfound myself precisely where I started, with nothing gained save an\nextensive knowledge of glass-making. I was almost dead with despair. My\nparents were surprized at my apparent want of progress in my medical\nstudies (I had not attended one lecture since my arrival in the city),\nand the expenses of my mad pursuit had been so great as to embarrass me\nvery seriously.\n\nI was in this frame of mind one day, experimenting in my laboratory\non a small diamond--that stone, from its great refracting power,\nhaving always occupied my attention more than any other--when a young\nFrenchman, who lived on the floor above me, and who was in the habit of\noccasionally visiting me, entered the room.\n\nI think that Jules Simon was a Jew. He had many traits of the Hebrew\ncharacter: a love of jewelry, of dress, and of good living. There was\nsomething mysterious about him. He always had something to sell, and\nyet went into excellent society. When I say sell, I should perhaps\nhave said peddle; for his operations were generally confined to the\ndisposal of single articles--a picture, for instance, or a rare carving\nin ivory, or a pair of duelling-pistols, or the dress of a Mexican\n_caballero_. When I was first furnishing my rooms, he paid me a visit,\nwhich ended in my purchasing an antique silver lamp, which he assured\nme was a Cellini--it was handsome enough even for that--and some other\nknickknacks for my sitting-room. Why Simon should pursue this petty\ntrade I never could imagine. He apparently had plenty of money, and had\nthe _entr\u00e9e_ of the best houses in the city--taking care, however, I\nsuppose, to drive no bargains within the enchanted circle of the Upper\nTen. I came at length to the conclusion that this peddling was but a\nmask to cover some greater object, and even went so far as to believe\nmy young acquaintance to be implicated in the slave-trade. That,\nhowever, was none of my affair.\n\nOn the present occasion, Simon entered my room in a state of\nconsiderable excitement.\n\n\"_Ah! mon ami!_\" he cried, before I could even offer him the ordinary\nsalutation, \"it has occurred to me to be the witness of the most\nastonishing things in the world. I promenade myself to the house of\nMadame--how does the little animal--_le renard_--name himself in the\nLatin?\"\n\n\"Vulpes,\" I answered.\n\n\"Ah! yes--Vulpes. I promenade myself to the house of Madame Vulpes.\"\n\n\"The spirit medium?\"\n\n\"Yes, the great medium. Great heavens! what a woman! I write on a slip\nof paper many of questions concerning affairs the most secret--affairs\nthat conceal themselves in the abysses of my heart the most profound;\nand behold! by example! what occurs? This devil of a woman makes me\nreplies the most truthful to all of them. She talks to me of things\nthat I do not love to talk of to myself. What am I to think? I am fixed\nto the earth!\"\n\n\"Am I to understand you, Monsieur Simon, that this Mrs. Vulpes replied\nto questions secretly written by you, which questions related to events\nknown only to yourself?\"\n\n\"Ah! more than that, more than that,\" he answered, with an air of some\nalarm. \"She related to me things----But,\" he added, after a pause, and\nsuddenly changing his manner, \"why occupy ourselves with these follies?\nIt was all the biology, without doubt. It goes without saying that it\nhas not my credence.--But why are we here, _mon ami_? It has occurred\nto me to discover the most beautiful thing as you can imagine--a vase\nwith green lizards on it, composed by the great Bernard Palissy. It is\nin my apartment; let us mount. I go to show it to you.\"\n\nI followed Simon mechanically; but my thoughts were far from Palissy\nand his enameled ware, although I, like him, was seeking in the dark\na great discovery. This casual mention of the spiritualist, Madame\nVulpes, set me on a new track. What if this spiritualism should be\nreally a great fact? What if, through communication with more subtile\norganisms than my own, I could reach at a single bound the goal, which\nperhaps a life of agonizing mental toil would never enable me to attain?\n\nWhile purchasing the Palissy vase from my friend Simon, I was mentally\narranging a visit to Madame Vulpes.\n\n\n_3. The Spirit of Leeuwenhoek_\n\nTwo evenings after this, thanks to an arrangement by letter and the\npromise of an ample fee, I found Madame Vulpes awaiting me at her\nresidence alone. She was a coarse-featured woman, with keen and rather\ncruel dark eyes, and an exceedingly sensual expression about her mouth\nand under jaw. She received me in perfect silence, in an apartment on\nthe ground floor, very sparely furnished. In the center of the room,\nclose to where Mrs. Vulpes sat, there was a common round mahogany\ntable. If I had come for the purpose of sweeping her chimney, the woman\ncould not have looked more indifferent to my appearance. There was no\nattempt to inspire the visitor with awe. Everything bore a simple\nand practical aspect. This intercourse with the spiritual world was\nevidently as familiar an occupation with Mrs. Vulpes as eating her\ndinner or riding in an omnibus.\n\n\"You come for a communication, Mr. Linley?\" said the medium, in a dry,\nbusinesslike tone of voice.\n\n\"By appointment--yes.\"\n\n\"What sort of communication do you want?--a written one?\"\n\n\"Yes--I wish for a written one.\"\n\n\"From any particular spirit?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Have you ever known this spirit on this earth?\"\n\n\"Never. He died long before I was born. I wish merely to obtain from\nhim some information which he ought to be able to give better than any\nother.\"\n\n\"Will you seat yourself at the table, Mr. Linley,\" said the medium,\n\"and place your hands upon it?\"\n\nI obeyed--Mrs. Vulpes being seated opposite to me, with her hands also\non the table. We remained thus for about a minute and a half, when a\nviolent succession of raps came on the table, on the back of my chair,\non the floor immediately under my feet, and even on the window-panes.\nMrs. Vulpes smiled composedly.\n\n\"They are very strong tonight,\" she remarked. \"You are fortunate.\" She\nthen continued, \"Will the spirits communicate with this gentleman?\"\n\nVigorous affirmative.\n\n\"Will the particular spirit he desires to speak with communicate?\"\n\nA very confused rapping followed this question.\n\n\"I know what they mean,\" said Mrs. Vulpes, addressing herself to me;\n\"they wish you to write down the name of the particular spirit that\nyou desire to converse with. Is that so?\" she added, speaking to her\ninvisible guests.\n\nThat it was so was evident from the numerous affirmatory responses.\nWhile this was going on, I tore a slip from my pocket-book, and\nscribbled a name, under the table.\n\n\"Will this spirit communicate in writing with this gentleman?\" asked\nthe medium once more.\n\nAfter a moment's pause, her hand seemed to be seized with a violent\ntremor, shaking so forcibly that the table vibrated. She said that a\nspirit had seized her hand and would write. I handed her some sheets\nof paper that were on the table, and a pencil. The latter she held\nloosely in her hand, which presently began to move over the paper with\na singular and seemingly involuntary motion. After a few moments had\nelapsed, she handed me the paper, on which I found written, in a large,\nuncultivated hand, the words:\n\n     He is not here, but has been sent for.\n\nA pause of a minute or so now ensued, during which Mrs. Vulpes remained\nperfectly silent, but the raps continued at regular intervals. When the\nshort period I mention had elapsed, the hand of the medium was again\nseized with its convulsive tremor, and she wrote, under this strange\ninfluence, a few words on the paper, which she handed to me. They were\nas follows:\n\n     I am here. Question me.\n\n                LEEUWENHOEK.\n\nI was astounded. The name was identical with that I had written beneath\nthe table, and carefully kept concealed. Neither was it at all probable\nthat an uncultivated woman like Mrs. Vulpes should know even the name\nof the great father of microscopics. It may have been biology; but\nthis theory was soon doomed to be destroyed. I wrote on my slip--still\nconcealing it from Mrs. Vulpes--a series of questions, which, to avoid\ntediousness, I shall place with the responses, in the order in which\nthey occurred:\n\n    I.--Can the microscope be brought to perfection?\n\n    SPIRIT.--Yes.\n\n    I.--Am I destined to accomplish this great task?\n\n    SPIRIT.--You are.\n\n    I.--I wish to know how to proceed to attain this end. For the love\n    which you bear to science, help me!\n\n    SPIRIT.--A diamond of one hundred and forty carats, submitted to\n    electro-magnetic currents for a long period, will experience a\n    rearrangement of its atoms _inter se_, and from that stone you will\n    form the universal lens.\n\n    I.--Will great discoveries result from the use of such a lens?\n\n    SPIRIT.--So great that all that has gone before is as nothing.\n\n    I.--But the refractive power of the diamond is so immense, that the\n    image will be formed within the lens. How is that difficulty to be\n    surmounted?\n\n    SPIRIT.--Pierce the lens through its axis, and the difficulty is\n    obviated. The image will be formed in the pierced space, which will\n    itself serve as a tube to look through. Now I am called.\n    Good-night.\n\nI can not at all describe the effect that these extraordinary\ncommunications had upon me. I felt completely bewildered. No biological\ntheory could account for the _discovery_ of the lens. The medium might,\nby means of biological _rapport_ with my mind, have gone so far as to\nread my questions, and reply to them coherently. But biology could\nnot enable her to discover that magnetic currents would so alter the\ncrystals of the diamond as to remedy its previous defects, and admit\nof its being polished into a perfect lens. Some such theory may have\npassed through my head, it is true; but if so, I had forgotten it. In\nmy excited condition of mind there was no course left but to become a\nconvert, and it was in a state of the most painful nervous exaltation\nthat I left the medium's house that evening. She accompanied me to the\ndoor, hoping that I was satisfied. The raps followed us as we went\nthrough the hall, sounding on the balusters, the flooring, and even the\nlintels of the door. I hastily expressed my satisfaction, and escaped\nhurriedly into the cool night air. I walked home with but one thought\npossessing me--how to obtain a diamond of the immense size required. My\nentire means multiplied a hundred times over would have been inadequate\nto its purchase. Besides, such stones are rare, and become historical.\nI could find such only in the regalia of Eastern or European monarchs.\n\n\n_4. The Eye of Morning_\n\nThere was a light in Simon's room as I entered my house. A vague\nimpulse urged me to visit him. As I opened the door of his sitting-room\nunannounced, he was bending, with his back toward me, over a carcel\nlamp, apparently engaged in minutely examining some object which he\nheld in his hands. As I entered, he started suddenly, thrust his hand\ninto his breast pocket, and turned to me with a face crimson with\nconfusion.\n\n\"What!\" I cried, \"poring over the miniature of some fair lady? Well,\ndon't blush so much; I won't ask to see it.\"\n\nSimon laughed awkwardly enough, but made none of the negative\nprotestations usual on such occasions. He asked me to take a seat.\n\n\"Simon,\" said I, \"I have just come from Madame Vulpes.\"\n\nThis time Simon turned as white as a sheet, and seemed stupefied, as\nif a sudden electric shock had smitten him. He babbled some incoherent\nwords, and went hastily to a small closet where he usually kept his\nliquors. Although astonished at his emotion, I was too preoccupied with\nmy own idea to pay much attention to anything else.\n\n\"You say truly when you call Madame Vulpes a devil of a woman,\" I\ncontinued. \"Simon, she told me wonderful things tonight, or rather was\nthe means of telling me wonderful things. Ah! if I could only get a\ndiamond that weighed one hundred and forty carats!\"\n\nScarcely had the sigh with which I uttered this desire died upon\nmy lips, when Simon, with the aspect of a wild beast, glared at me\nsavagely, and, rushing to the mantelpiece, where some foreign weapons\nhung on the wall, caught up a Malay creese, and brandished it furiously\nbefore him.\n\n\"No!\" he cried in French, into which he always broke when excited. \"No!\nyou shall not have it! You are perfidious! You have consulted with that\ndemon, and desire my treasure! But I shall die first! Me! I am brave!\nYou can not make me fear!\"\n\nAll this, uttered in a loud voice trembling with excitement, astounded\nme. I saw at a glance that I had accidentally trodden upon the edges of\nSimon's secret, whatever it was. It was necessary to reassure him.\n\n\"My dear Simon,\" I said, \"I am entirely at a loss to know what you\nmean. I went to Madame Vulpes to consult her on a scientific problem,\nto the solution of which I discovered that a diamond of the size I\njust mentioned was necessary. You were never alluded to during the\nevening, nor, so far as I was concerned, even thought of. What can be\nthe meaning of this outburst? If you happen to have a set of valuable\ndiamonds in your possession, you need fear nothing from me. The diamond\nwhich I require you could not possess; or, if you did possess it, you\nwould not be living here.\"\n\nSomething in my tone must have completely reassured him; for his\nexpression immediately changed to a sort of constrained merriment,\ncombined, however, with a certain suspicious attention to my movements.\nHe laughed, and said that I must bear with him; that he was at certain\nmoments subject to a species of vertigo, which betrayed itself in\nincoherent speeches, and that the attacks passed off as rapidly as\nthey came. He put his weapon aside while making this explanation, and\nendeavored, with some success, to assume a more cheerful air.\n\nAll this did not impose on me in the least. I was too much accustomed\nto analytical labors to be baffled by so flimsy a veil. I determined to\nprobe the mystery to the bottom.\n\n\"Simon,\" I said, gayly, \"let us forget all this over a bottle of\nBurgundy. I have a case of Lausseure's _Clos Vougeot_ downstairs,\nfragrant with the odors and ruddy with the sunlight of the C\u00f4te d'Or.\nLet us have up a couple of bottles. What say you?\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" answered Simon, smilingly.\n\nI produced the wine and we seated ourselves to drink. It was of\na famous vintage, that of 1848, a year when war and wine throve\ntogether--and its pure but powerful juice seemed to impart renewed\nvitality to the system. By the time we had half finished the second\nbottle, Simon's head, which I knew was a weak one, had begun to yield,\nwhile I remained calm as ever, only that every draft seemed to send a\nflush of vigor through my limbs. Simon's utterance became more and more\nindistinct. He took to singing French _chansons_ of a not very moral\ntendency. I rose suddenly from the table just at the conclusion of one\nof those incoherent verses, and, fixing my eyes on him with a quiet\nsmile, said: \"Simon, I have deceived you. I learned your secret this\nevening. You may as well be frank with me. Mrs. Vulpes, or rather one\nof her spirits, told me all.\"\n\nHe started with horror. His intoxication seemed for the moment to fade\naway, and he made a movement towards the weapon that he had a short\ntime before laid down. I stopped him with my hand.\n\n\"Monster,\" he cried, passionately, \"I am ruined! What shall I do? You\nshall never have it! I swear by my mother!\"\n\n\"I don't want it,\" I said; \"rest secure, but be frank with me. Tell me\nall about it.\"\n\nThe drunkenness began to return. He protested with maudlin earnestness\nthat I was entirely mistaken--that I was intoxicated; then asked me to\nswear eternal secrecy, and promised to disclose the mystery to me. I\npledged myself, of course, to all. With an uneasy look in his eyes, and\nhands unsteady with drink and nervousness, he drew a small case from\nhis breast and opened it. Heavens! How the mild lamplight was shivered\ninto a thousand prismatic arrows, as it fell upon a vast rose-diamond\nthat glittered in the case! I was no judge of diamonds, but I saw at a\nglance that this was a gem of rare size and purity. I looked at Simon\nwith wonder, and--must I confess it?--with envy. How could he have\nobtained this treasure? In reply to my questions, I could just gather\nfrom his drunken statements (of which, I fancy, half the incoherence\nwas affected) that he had been superintending a gang of slaves engaged\nin diamond-washing in Brazil; that he had seen one of them secrete a\ndiamond, but, instead of informing his employers, had quietly watched\nthe negro until he saw him bury his treasure; that he had dug it up\nand fled with it, but that as yet he was afraid to attempt to dispose\nof it publicly--so valuable a gem being almost certain to attract too\nmuch attention to its owner's antecedents--and he had not been able\nto discover any of those obscure channels by which such matters are\nconveyed away safely. He added, that, in accordance with the Oriental\npractise, he had named his diamond with the fanciful title of \"The Eye\nof Morning.\"\n\nWhile Simon was relating this to me, I regarded the great diamond\nattentively. Never had I beheld anything so beautiful. All the glories\nof light, ever imagined or described, seemed to pulsate in its\ncrystalline chambers. Its weight, as I learned from Simon, was exactly\none hundred and forty carats. Here was an amazing coincidence. The\nhand of destiny seemed in it. On the very evening when the spirit of\nLeeuwenhoek communicates to me the great secret of the microscope, the\npriceless means which he directs me to employ start up within my easy\nreach! I determined, with the most perfect deliberation, to possess\nmyself of Simon's diamond.\n\nI sat opposite to him while he nodded over his glass, and calmly\nrevolved the whole affair. I did not for an instant contemplate so\nfoolish an act as a common theft, which would of course be discovered,\nor at least necessitate flight and concealment, all of which must\ninterfere with my scientific plans. There was but one step to be\ntaken--to kill Simon. After all, what was the life of a little peddling\nJew, in comparison with the interests of science? Human beings are\ntaken every day from the condemned prisons to be experimented on by\nsurgeons. This man, Simon, was by his own confession a criminal, a\nrobber, and I believed on my soul a murderer. He deserved death quite\nas much as any felon condemned by the laws: why should I not, like\ngovernment, contrive that his punishment should contribute to the\nprogress of human knowledge?\n\nThe means for accomplishing everything I desired lay within my reach.\nThere stood upon the mantelpiece a bottle half full of French laudanum.\nSimon was so occupied with his diamond, which I had just restored to\nhim, that it was an affair of no difficulty to drug his glass. In a\nquarter of an hour he was in a profound sleep.\n\nI now opened his waistcoat, took the diamond from the inner pocket in\nwhich he had placed it, and removed him to the bed, on which I laid\nhim so that his feet hung down over the edge. I had possessed myself of\nthe Malay creese, which I held in my right hand, while with the other\nI discovered as accurately as I could by pulsation the exact locality\nof the heart. It was essential that all the aspects of his death should\nlead to the surmise of self-murder. I calculated the exact angle at\nwhich it was probable that the weapon, if leveled by Simon's own hand,\nwould enter his breast; then with one powerful blow I thrust it up to\nthe hilt in the very spot which I desired to penetrate. A convulsive\nthrill ran through Simon's limbs. I heard a smothered sound issue from\nhis throat, precisely like the bursting of a large air-bubble, sent up\nby a diver, when it reaches the surface of the water; he turned half\nround on his side, and, as if to assist my plans more effectually, his\nright hand, moved by some mere spasmodic impulse, clasped the handle\nof the creese, which it remained holding with extraordinary muscular\ntenacity. Beyond this there was no apparent struggle. The laudanum,\nI presume, paralyzed the usual nervous action. He must have died\ninstantly.\n\nThere was yet something to be done. To make it certain that all\nsuspicion of the act should be diverted from any inhabitant of the\nhouse to Simon himself, it was necessary that the door should be found\nin the morning _locked on the inside_. How to do this, and afterwards\nescape myself? Not by the window; that was a physical impossibility.\nBesides, I was determined that the windows _also_ should be found\nbolted. The solution was simple enough. I descended softly to my own\nroom for a peculiar instrument which I had used for holding small\nslippery substances, such as minute spheres of glass, etc. This\ninstrument was nothing more than a long slender hand-vise, with a very\npowerful grip, and a considerable leverage, which last was accidentally\nowing to the shape of the handle. Nothing was simpler than, when the\nkey was in the lock, to seize the end of its stem in this vise, through\nthe keyhole, from the outside, and so lock the door. Previously,\nhowever, to doing this, I burned a number of papers on Simon's hearth.\nSuicides almost always burn papers before they destroy themselves.\nI also emptied some more laudanum into Simon's glass--having first\nremoved from it all traces of wine--cleaned the other wine-glass, and\nbrought the bottles away with me. If traces of two persons drinking had\nbeen found in the room, the question naturally would have arisen, Who\nwas the second? Besides, the wine-bottles might have been identified as\nbelonging to me. The laudanum I poured out to account for its presence\nin his stomach, in case of a post-mortem examination. The theory\nnaturally would be, that he first intended to poison himself, but,\nafter swallowing a little of the drug, was either disgusted with its\ntaste, or changed his mind from other motives, and chose the dagger.\nThese arrangements made, I walked out, leaving the gas burning, locked\nthe door with my vise, and went to bed.\n\nSimon's death was not discovered until nearly 3 in the afternoon. The\nservant, astonished at seeing the gas burning--the light streaming on\nthe dark landing from under the door--peeped through the keyhole and\nsaw Simon on the bed. She gave the alarm. The door was burst open, and\nthe neighborhood was in a fever of excitement.\n\nEveryone in the house was arrested, myself included. There was an\ninquest; but no clue to his death beyond that of suicide could be\nobtained. Curiously enough, he had made several speeches to his\nfriends the preceding week, that seemed to point to self-destruction.\nOne gentleman swore that Simon had said in his presence that \"he was\ntired of life.\" His landlord affirmed that Simon, when paying him\nhis last month's rent, remarked that \"he should not pay him rent much\nlonger.\" All the other evidence corresponded--the door locked inside,\nthe position of the corpse, the burnt papers. As I anticipated, no one\nknew of the possession of the diamond by Simon, so that no motive was\nsuggested for his murder. The jury, after a prolonged examination,\nbrought in the usual verdict, and the neighborhood once more settled\ndown into its accustomed quiet.\n\n\n_5. Animula_\n\nThe three months succeeding Simon's catastrophe I devoted night and day\nto my diamond lens. I had constructed a vast galvanic battery, composed\nof nearly two thousand pairs of plates--a higher power I dared not use,\nlest the diamond should be calcined. By means of this enormous engine\nI was enabled to send a powerful current of electricity continually\nthrough my great diamond, which it seemed to me gained in luster\nevery day. At the expiration of a month I commenced the grinding and\npolishing of the lens, a work of intense toil and exquisite delicacy.\nThe great density of the stone, and the care required to be taken with\nthe curvatures of the surfaces of the lens, rendered the labor the\nseverest and most harassing that I had yet undergone.\n\nAt last the eventful moment came; the lens was completed. I stood\ntrembling on the threshold of new worlds. I had the realization of\nAlexander's famous wish before me. The lens lay on the table, ready\nto be placed upon its platform. My hand fairly shook as I enveloped a\ndrop of water with a thin coating of oil of turpentine, preparatory\nto its examination--a process necessary in order to prevent the rapid\nevaporation of the water. I now placed the drop on a thin slip of\nglass under the lens, and throwing upon it, by the combined aid of a\nprism and a mirror, a powerful stream of light, I approached my eye to\nthe minute hole drilled through the axis of the lens. For an instant\nI saw nothing save what seemed to be an illuminated chaos, a vast\nluminous abyss. A pure white light, cloudless and serene, and seemingly\nlimitless as space itself, was my first impression. Gently, and with\nthe greatest care, I depressed the lens a few hair's-breadths. The\nwondrous illumination still continued, but as the lens approached the\nobject a scene of indescribable beauty was unfolded to my view.\n\nI seemed to gaze upon a vast space, the limits of which extended far\nbeyond my vision. An atmosphere of magical luminousness permeated the\nentire field of view. I was amazed to see no trace of animalculous\nlife. Not a living thing, apparently, inhabited that dazzling expanse.\nI comprehended instantly that, by the wondrous power of my lens, I had\npenetrated beyond the grosser particles of aqueous matter, beyond the\nrealms of infusoria and protozoa, down to the original gaseous globule,\ninto whose luminous interior I was gazing, as into an almost boundless\ndome filled with a supernatural radiance.\n\nIt was, however, no brilliant void into which I looked. On every side\nI beheld beautiful inorganic forms, of unknown texture, and colored\nwith the most enchanting hues. These forms presented the appearance of\nwhat might be called, for want of a more specific definition, foliated\nclouds of the highest rarity; that is, they undulated and broke into\nvegetable formations, and were tinged with splendors compared with\nwhich the gilding of our autumn woodlands is as dross compared with\ngold. Far away into the illimitable distance stretched long avenues of\nthese gaseous forests, dimly transparent, and painted with prismatic\nhues of unimaginable brilliancy. The pendent branches waved along the\nfluid glades until every vista seemed to break through half-lucent\nranks of many-colored drooping silken pennons. What seemed to be\neither fruits or flowers, pied with a thousand hues, lustrous and ever\nvarying, bubbled from the crowns of this fairy foliage. No hills, no\nlakes, no rivers, no forms animate or inanimate, were to be seen,\nsave those vast auroral copses that floated serenely in the luminous\nstillness, with leaves and fruits and flowers gleaming with unknown\nfires, unrealizable by mere imagination.\n\nHow strange, I thought, that this sphere should be thus condemned\nto solitude! I had hoped, at least to discover some new form of\nanimal life--perhaps of a lower class than any with which we are at\npresent acquainted, but still, some living organism. I found my newly\ndiscovered world, if I may so speak, a beautiful chromatic desert.\n\nWhile I was speculating on the singular arrangements of the internal\neconomy of Nature, with which she so frequently splinters into atoms\nour most compact theories, I thought I beheld a form moving slowly\nthrough the glades of one of the prismatic forests. I looked more\nattentively, and found that I was not mistaken.\n\nWords can not depict the anxiety with which I awaited the nearer\napproach of this mysterious object. Was it merely some inanimate\nsubstance, held in suspense in the attenuated atmosphere of the\nglobule? or was it an animal endowed with vitality and motion? It\napproached, flitting behind the gauzy, colored veils of cloud-foliage,\nfor seconds dimly revealed, then vanished. At last the violet pennons\nthat trailed nearest to me vibrated; they were gently pushed aside, and\nthe form floated out into the broad light.\n\nIt was a female human shape. When I say human, I mean it possessed the\noutlines of humanity--but there the analogy ends. Its adorable beauty\nlifted it illimitable heights beyond the loveliest daughter of Adam.\n\nI can not, I dare not, attempt to inventory the charms of this divine\nrevelation of perfect beauty. Those eyes of mystic violet, dewy and\nserene, evade my words. Her long, lustrous hair following her glorious\nhead in a golden wake, like the track sown in heaven by a falling star,\nseems to quench my most burning phrases with its splendors. If all the\nbees of Hybla nestled upon my lips, they would still sing but hoarsely\nthe wondrous harmonies of outline that enclosed her form.\n\nShe swept out from between the rainbow-curtains of the cloud-trees\ninto the broad sea of light that lay beyond. Her motions were those\nof some graceful naiad, cleaving, by a mere effort of her will, the\nclear, unruffled waters that fill the chambers of the sea. She floated\nforth with the serene grace of a frail bubble ascending through the\nstill atmosphere of a June day. The perfect roundness of her limbs\nformed suave and enchanting curves. It was like listening to the most\nspiritual symphony of Beethoven the divine, to watch the harmonious\nflow of lines. This, indeed, was a pleasure, cheaply purchased at\nany price. What cared I, if I had waded to the portal of this wonder\nthrough another's blood? I would have given my own to enjoy one such\nmoment of intoxication and delight.\n\nBreathless with gazing on this lovely wonder, and forgetful for an\ninstant of everything save her presence, I withdrew my eye from the\nmicroscope eagerly--alas! As my gaze fell on the thin slide that lay\nbeneath my instrument, the bright light from mirror and from prism\nsparkled on a colorless drop of water! There, in that tiny bead of dew,\nthis beautiful being was forever imprisoned. The planet Neptune was not\nmore distant from me than she. I hastened once more to apply my eye to\nthe microscope.\n\nAnimula (let me now call her by that dear name which I subsequently\nbestowed on her) had changed her position. She had again approached\nthe wondrous forest, and was gazing earnestly upwards. Presently one\nof the trees--as I must call them--unfolded a long ciliary process,\nwith which it seized one of the gleaming fruits that glittered on its\nsummit, and, sweeping slowly down, held it within reach of Animula. The\nsylph took it in her delicate hand and began to eat. My attention was\nso entirely absorbed by her, that I could not apply myself to the task\nof determining whether this singular plant was or was not instinct with\nvolition.\n\nI watched her, as she made her repast, with the most profound\nattention. The suppleness of her motions sent a thrill of delight\nthrough my frame; my heart beat madly as she turned her beautiful\neyes in the direction of the spot in which I stood. What would I not\nhave given to have had the power to precipitate myself into that\nluminous ocean, and float with her through those groves of purple and\ngold! While I was thus breathlessly following her every movement, she\nsuddenly started, seemed to listen for a moment, and then cleaving\nthe brilliant ether in which she was floating, like a flash of light,\npierced through the opaline forest, and disappeared.\n\nInstantly a series of the most singular sensations attacked me. It\nseemed as if I had suddenly gone blind. The luminous sphere was\nstill before me, but my daylight had vanished. What caused this\nsudden disappearance? Had she a lover or a husband? Yes, that was the\nsolution! Some signal from a happy fellow-being had vibrated through\nthe avenues of the forest, and she had obeyed the summons.\n\nThe agony of my sensations, as I arrived at this conclusion, startled\nme. I tried to reject the conviction that my reason forced upon me. I\nbattled against the fatal conclusion--but in vain. It was so. I had no\nescape from it. I loved an animalcule!\n\nIt is true that, thanks to the marvelous power of my microscope, she\nappeared of human proportions. Instead of presenting the revolting\naspect of the coarser creatures, that live and struggle and die, in the\nmore easily resolvable portions of the water-drop, she was fair and\ndelicate and of surpassing beauty. But of what account was all that?\nEvery time that my eye was withdrawn from the instrument, it fell on a\nmiserable drop of water, within which, I must be content to know, dwelt\nall that could make my life lovely.\n\nCould she but see me once! Could I for one moment pierce the mystical\nwalls that so inexorably rose to separate us, and whisper all that\nfilled my soul, I might consent to be satisfied for the rest of my\nlife with the knowledge of her remote sympathy. It would be something\nto have established even the faintest personal link to bind us\ntogether--to know that at times, when roaming through those enchanted\nglades, she might think of the wonderful stranger, who had broken the\nmonotony of her life with his presence, and left a gentle memory in her\nheart!\n\nBut it could not be. No invention of which human intellect was capable\ncould break down the barriers that nature had erected. I might feast\nmy soul upon her wondrous beauty, yet she must always remain ignorant\nof the adoring eyes that day and night gazed upon her, and, even when\nclosed, beheld her in dreams. With a bitter cry of anguish I fled from\nthe room, and, flinging myself on my bed, sobbed myself to sleep like a\nchild.\n\n\n_6. The Spilling of the Cup_\n\nI arose the next morning almost at daybreak, and rushed to my\nmicroscope. I trembled as I sought the luminous world in miniature\nthat contained my all. Animula was there. I had left the gas-lamp,\nsurrounded by its moderators, burning, when I went to bed the night\nbefore. I found the sylph bathing, as it were, with an expression\nof pleasure animating her features, in the brilliant light which\nsurrounded her. She tossed her lustrous golden hair over her shoulders\nwith innocent coquetry. She lay at full length in the transparent\nmedium, in which she supported herself with ease, and gamboled with the\nenchanting grace that the nymph Salmacis might have exhibited when she\nsought to conquer the modest Hermaphroditus. I tried an experiment to\nsatisfy myself if her powers of reflection were developed. I lessened\nthe lamplight considerably. By the dim light that remained, I could see\nan expression of pain flit across her face. She looked upward suddenly,\nand her brows contracted. I flooded the stage of the microscope again\nwith a full stream of light, and her whole expression changed. She\nsprang forward like some substance deprived of all weight. Her eyes\nsparkled and her lips moved. Ah! if science had only the means of\nconducting and reduplicating sounds, as it does the rays of light, what\ncarols of happiness would then have entranced my ears! what jubilant\nhymns to Adonis would have thrilled the illumined air!\n\nI now comprehended how it was that the Count de Gabalis peopled his\nmystic world with sylphs--beautiful beings whose breath of life was\nlambent fire, and who sported forever in regions of purest ether and\npurest light. The Rosicrucian had anticipated the wonder that I had\npractically realized.\n\nHow long this worship of my strange divinity went on thus I scarcely\nknow. I lost all note of time. All day from early dawn, and far into\nthe night, I was to be found peering through that wonderful lens. I saw\nno one, went nowhere, and scarce allowed myself sufficient time for my\nmeals. My whole life was absorbed in contemplation as rapt as that of\nany of the Romish saints. Every hour that I gazed upon the divine form\nstrengthened my passion--a passion that was always overshadowed by the\nmaddening conviction, that, although I could gaze on her at will, she\nnever, never could behold me!\n\nAt length, I grew so pale and emaciated, from want of rest and\ncontinual brooding over my insane love and its cruel conditions, that\nI determined to make some effort to wean myself from it. \"Come,\" I\nsaid, \"this is at best but a fantasy. Your imagination has bestowed on\nAnimula charms which in reality she does not possess. Seclusion from\nfemale society has produced this morbid condition of mind. Compare her\nwith the beautiful women of your own world, and this false enchantment\nwill vanish.\"\n\nI looked over the newspapers by chance. There I beheld the\nadvertisement of a celebrated _danseuse_ who appeared nightly at\nNiblo's. The Signorina Caradolce had the reputation of being the most\nbeautiful as well as the most graceful woman in the world. I instantly\ndressed and went to the theater.\n\nThe curtain drew up. The usual semicircle of fairies in white muslin\nwere standing on the right toe around the enameled flower-bank, of\ngreen canvas, on which the belated prince was sleeping. Suddenly a\nflute is heard. The fairies start. The trees open, the fairies all\nstand on the left toe, and the queen enters. It was the Signorina. She\nbounded forward amid thunders of applause, and, lighting on one foot,\nremained poised in air! Heavens! was this the great enchantress that\nhad drawn monarchs at her chariot-wheels? Those heavy muscular limbs,\nthose thick ankles, those cavernous eyes, that stereotyped smile, those\ncrudely painted cheeks! Where were the vermeil blooms, the liquid\nexpressive eyes, the harmonious limbs of Animula?\n\nThe Signorina danced. What gross, discordant movements! The play of her\nlimbs was all false and artificial. Her bounds were painful athletic\nefforts; her poses were angular and distressed the eye. I could bear\nit no longer; with an exclamation of disgust that drew every eye\nupon me, I rose from my seat in the very middle of the Signorina's\n_pas-de-fasination_, and abruptly quitted the house.\n\nI hastened home to feast my eyes once more on the lovely form of\nmy sylph. I felt that henceforth to combat this passion would be\nimpossible. I applied my eye to the lens. Animula was there--but\nwhat could have happened? Some terrible change seemed to have taken\nplace during my absence. Some secret grief seemed to cloud the lovely\nfeatures of her I gazed upon. Her face had grown thin and haggard;\nher limbs trailed heavily; the wondrous luster of her golden hair had\nfaded. She was ill!--ill, and I could not assist her! I believe at that\nmoment I would have gladly forfeited all claims to my human birthright,\nif I could only have been dwarfed to the size of an animalcule, and\npermitted to console her from whom fate had forever divided me.\n\nI racked my brain for the solution of this mystery. What was it that\nafflicted the sylph? She seemed to suffer intense pain. Her features\ncontracted, and she even writhed, as if with some internal agony. The\nwondrous forests appeared also to have lost half their beauty. Their\nhues were dim and in some places faded away altogether. I watched\nAnimula for hours with a breaking heart, and she seemed absolutely to\nwither away under my very eye. Suddenly I remembered that I had not\nlooked at the water-drop for several days. In fact, I hated to see it;\nfor it reminded me of the natural barrier between Animula and myself.\nI hurriedly looked down on the stage of the microscope. The slide was\nstill there--but, great heavens! the water-drop had vanished! The awful\ntruth burst upon me; it had evaporated, until it had become so minute\nas to be invisible to the naked eye; I had been gazing on its last\natom, the one that contained Animula--and she was dying!\n\nI rushed again to the front of the lens, and looked through. Alas! the\nlast agony had seized her. The rainbow-hued forests had all melted\naway, and Animula lay struggling feebly in what seemed to be a spot\nof dim light. Ah! the sight was horrible: the limbs once so round and\nlovely shriveling up into nothings; the eyes--those eyes that shone\nlike heaven--being quenched into black dust; the lustrous golden hair\nnow lank and discolored. The last throe came. I beheld that final\nstruggle of the blackening form--and I fainted.\n\nWhen I awoke out of a trance of many hours, I found myself lying amid\nthe wreck of my instrument, myself as shattered in mind and body as it.\nI crawled feebly to my bed, from which I did not rise for months.\n\nThey say now that I am mad; but they are mistaken. I am poor, for I\nhave neither the heart nor the will to work; all my money is spent, and\nI live on charity. Young men's associations that love a joke invite me\nto lecture on optics before them, for which they pay me, and laugh at\nme while I lecture. \"Linley, the mad microscopist,\" is the name I go\nby. I suppose that I talk incoherently while I lecture. Who could talk\nsense when his brain is haunted by such ghastly memories, while ever\nand anon among the shapes of death I behold the radiant form of my lost\nAnimula!\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Diamond Lens, by Fitz-James O'Brien\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DIAMOND LENS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 50332-8.txt or 50332-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/0/3/3/50332/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
