Diffin_\n\n[Illustration: \"_That'll be all from you,\" he told the black one._]\n\n[Sidenote: It is magic against magic as Garry Connell bluffs for his\nlife with a prehistoric savage in the heart of Sentinel Mountain.]\n\n\nThe first tremor that set the timbers of the house to creaking brought\nGarry Connell out of his bunk and into the middle of the floor. Then\nthe floor heaved and 'dobe walls swayed while the man fought to keep\nhis footing and pull himself through the doorway to the safety of the\ndark night. The earthquake that came with the spring of 1932 was on.\n\nHe was nauseated with that deathly sickness that only an earthquake\ngives, and he dropped breathlessly in the shelter of a date palm while\nthe earth beneath him rolled and groaned in agony. A deeper roar was\nrising above all other sounds, and Connell looked up at the nearby top\nof Sentinel Mountain.\n\nThe stars of the desert land showed clear; the grim blackness of\nSentinel's lone peak rose abruptly from the sand of the desert floor\nin darker silhouette against the velvet of a midnight sky. And the\nmountain was roaring.\n\nSoftened by the distance, the deep, grumbling bass sang thunderingly\nthrough and above the other noises of the night, as if old Sentinel\nitself were voicing its remonstrance against this disturbance of its\nage-long rest.\n\nThe grumbling died to a clatter of falling boulders a hundred yards\naway at the mountain's base, and Connell's eyes discerned a puff of\nvaporous gray, a cloud of wind-blown dust, high up on the mountain's\nflank.\n\n\"Holy cats!\" said Garry explosively, \"what a slide! That must have\nripped the old boy wide open.\"\n\nHis eyes followed the white scar far up on the mountainside, followed\nit down to the last loosened stones that had crashed among the date\npalms of Miramar ranch. \"I don't just like the idea of the whole\nmountain moving in on me,\" he told himself; \"I'll have to go up and\nlook at that to-morrow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was afternoon of the following day when Garry rolled blankets and\nfood into a snug pack and prepared for the ascent. \"Guess likely I'll\nsleep out to-night,\" he mused and looked at the pistol he held in his\nhand.\n\n\"I don't want that thing slapping against me,\" he argued; \"too darned\nhot! And there's nothing to use a gun on up on Sentinel.... Oh, well!\"\nHe threw the holster upon his bunk and dropped the automatic into the\npack he was rolling. \"I'll take it along. Might meet up with a\nrattler.\"\n\nHe brushed the sandy hair from his wet forehead and straightened to\nhis full six feet of slender height before he slipped the straps of\nhis pack about his shoulders. And a broad grin made pleasant lines\nabout his gray eyes as he realized the boyish curiosity that was\ndriving him to a stiff climb in the heat of the day.\n\nThere was no real trail up the thousand-foot slope of Sentinel\nMountain. Prospectors had been over it, doubtless, in earlier days,\nbut in all of Garry's twenty-one years no one besides himself had ever\nmade the ascent.\n\nThere was nothing in all that solitary, desolate peak to call them;\nnothing, for that matter, to beckon Garry, except the hot desert days,\nthe cool breath of evening and the glory of nights when the stars hung\nlow over all the miles of sand and sagebrush that reached far out to\nthe rippling sand-dunes shimmering in the distance. Nothing, that is,\nbut the \"feel\" of the desert--and young Garry Connell was desert-born\nand bred.\n\nHe stopped once and dropped his pack while he mopped his wet face.\nFrom this point he could see his own ranch spread below him. Miramar,\nhe had named it--\"Beautiful Sea.\" The name was half an affectionate\nmockery of this land where the nearest water was fifty miles away, and\nhalf because of the sea of blue that he looked at now. Garry had never\nceased to wonder at the mirage.\n\nIt was always the same in the summer heat--a phantom ocean of water.\nGarry's eyes loved to follow the quivering blue expanse that seemed so\ncool and deep. It rippled softly away to end in a line of white, like\ndistant breakers on the horizon's rolling dunes.\n\nThis had been the bed of an ocean in some distant past, and that\nancient ocean could never have seemed more real than this; yet Garry\nknew that this sea would vanish with the setting sun. He had watched\nit often.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA hundred yards farther and he stopped again. It was no well-trodden\npath that Garry followed, but he knew his landmarks. There was the big\nsplit rock a half mile ahead, and the three-branched cactus beside it.\nBut between these and the place where Garry stood was a fan-shaped\nsweep of boulders--and this where smooth going had been before.\n\nHe forgot for the moment all discomfort. He stood staring under the\nhot sun that cast purple shadows beside the weathered rocks, and his\neyes followed up the scarred mountainside.\n\n\"That whole ledge that stood out up there--that's gone!\" he told\nhimself. \"The whole side of the mountain just shook itself loose....\"\n\nFar above, his eyes found another towering mass that reared itself\nmenacingly. \"That will come down next time,\" he said with conviction,\n\"and I don't want to be under it when it breaks loose.\" Then his\nsearching eyes found the lower ledge and its shattered remains.\n\nIt had held a welter of rocks above it as a dam holds the pressure of\nwater--and the dam had burst. The torrent of stone from above had\nswept into motion and carried with it the accumulation of loose rubble\nbelow. Where the ledge had been was now a cliff--a sheer wall of rock.\nIt had been covered before by the talus that was swept away.\n\nGarry's eyes narrowed to see more plainly under the sun's glare. He\nwas staring not alone at the cliff but at a shadow within it--a black\nshadow in the white face of the cliff itself.\n\n\"That was all covered up before,\" Garry stated; \"buried for thousands\nof years, I suppose. But it can't be a cave; not a natural one, at\nleast. There are no caves in this rock.\"\n\nHe stopped at times for breath, and his wonder grew as he climbed and\nthe black mark took clearer form. At last he stood panting before it,\nto stare deep into the utter blackness of a passageway beyond an\nentrance of carved stone.\n\nIt was carved; there was no mistaking it! Here was a passage that\nnature had never formed. He took a quick stride forward to see the\ntool marks that showed on hard walls where symbols and figures of\nstrange design were carved. An intrusion of harder rock had formed a\nroof, and they had cut in below--\n\n\"They!\" He spoke the word aloud. Who were \"they?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe remembered the scientist who had stopped at the ranch some time\nbefore, and he recalled enough of the talk of Aztec and Toltec and\nMayas to know that none of these old civilizations could explain the\nthings he saw.\n\n\"This goes way back beyond them--it must,\" he reasoned. And there were\npictures, long forgotten, that came to his mind to show him a vision\nfrom the past--figures whose coppery faces shone dark above their\nbrilliant, colored robes--slaves, toiling and sweating to drive this\ntunnel into solid rock. He was suddenly a-quiver with a feeling of the\npresence of living things. His breath seemed stifled within him as he\nstepped into the dark where a pencil of light from his pocket-flash\nmade the blackness more intense.\n\nHe tried to shake off the feeling, but an indefinable oppression was\nheavy upon him; the weight of the uncounted centuries these walls had\nseen filled him with strange forebodings.\n\nHis feet stumbled and scuffed over chips of stone; he steadied himself\nagainst the wall at times as he followed the corridor that went down\nand still down before him. It turned and twisted, then leveled off at\nlast, and Garry Connell drew himself up sharply with a quick-drawn\nbreath.\n\nHis flash was making a circle of light a dozen steps ahead, and showed\na litter of sharp stone fragments. And, scattered over them, a tangle\nof bones shone white; one skull stood upright to stare mockingly from\nhollow sockets. The sudden white of them was startling in the black\npit.\n\n\"Bones!\" he said, and forced himself to disregard the echoes that\ntried to shout him down; \"just bones! And the old-timers that wore\nthem haven't been using them for thousands of years.\" He moved forward\nwith determined steps to the end of the passage that finished in solid\nstone. He stopped abruptly. At closer range was something that froze\nhim to a tense, waiting crouch.\n\nThis wall of solid stone--it was not solid as it had seemed. There was\na doorway; the stone was swung inward; and at one side in a\nstraight-marked crack, he saw a thread of light.\n\nHe snapped off his own flash. Someone was there! Someone had beaten\nhim to it! He held himself crouched and rigid at the thought. But who\ncould it be? The utter silence and the steady, unchanging, pale-green\nlight showed him the folly of the thought. There was no one there;\nthere couldn't be anyone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis hand, that trembled with excitement, reached across and over the\nskeleton remains posted like a ghostly guard before the door. He threw\nhis weight upon the stone.\n\nIts bearings groaned, but it moved at his touch. The stone swung\nslowly and ponderously into a silent room, and Garry Connell stared\nwide-eyed and wondering where rock walls, in carved and colored\nbrilliance reflected the softest of diffused light.\n\nA great room, hewn from the solid rock!--and Garry tried to see it and\nall that it held at one glance. He grasped the extent of the stone\nvault, a hundred feet across; the distant walls were plain in the soft\nlight.\n\nOne high point of flashing color caught his eye and held it in\nmarveling amazement. A thing of beauty and grace. It was a shining,\nsilvery shape like a mushroom growth; it towered high in air, almost\nto the ceiling, a slender rod that swelled and opened to a curved and\ngleaming head. Graceful as a fairy parasol, huge enough to shelter a\ngiant, it was like nothing he had ever seen.\n\nBut there was no time now for conjectures. He made no effort to\nunderstand; he wanted only to see what might be here; and his eyes\nflashed quickly over sculptured walls and a stone floor where metal\nboxes were arranged in orderly rows.\n\nHundreds of them, he estimated; huge cases, some eight or ten feet\nlong. Two nearby were raised above the floor on bases of carved stone.\nLusterless gray in color--metal, unmistakably--and in them....\n\n\"No use getting all hopped up over treasure hunting,\" Garry had told\nhimself. But under all his incredulous amazement had been flickering\nthoughts of what he might find.\n\nHe stared hungrily at those two boxes near him. Each of the hundreds\nwas big enough to hold a fortune. He reached for a metal bar beside\nthe scattered bones, and, like a man in a sleep-walking dream, he\nstepped across those relics of earlier men and entered the room that\nthey had guarded.\n\nThe light stopped him for a moment. He puzzled over it; stared\nwonderingly at a circle of glowing radiance in the roof of stone. It\nreminded him of something ... the watch on his wrist ... yes, that was\nthe answer--some radio-active substance. His eyes came back to the\nnearest chest, and he jammed the point of his corroded bar beneath the\nflange of a tight-fitting lid.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hidden room was cool, but Garry Connell wiped the sweat from his\neyes when he ceased his frantic efforts. The metal bar clanged loudly\nupon the floor beside him. He stood, breathing heavily, his eyes on\nthe metal cover that refused to move. And in the silence there came to\nhim again that strange, prickling apprehension. He caught himself\nlooking quickly behind him as if to find another person there.\n\nHis eyes were accustomed now to the pale light, and the sculptured\nfigures on the walls stood out with startling distinctness. Garry\nturned to look at the nearer wall and the figure that was repeated\nover and over again.\n\nIt was a man, tall and lean, his robes, undimmed by the years, blazed\nin crimson and gold. But the face above! Garry shivered in spite of\nhimself at the devilish ugliness the artist had copied. It was dead\nblack in color, with slitted eyes that had been touched up artfully\nto bring out their venomous stare. The head itself rose up to a\nrounded point that added to the inhuman brutality of the face.\n\nHe was seated on a throne, Garry saw, and other figures, less\nskilfully carved, were kneeling before him. Again, he was standing\nabove a prostrate enemy, a triple-pointed spear raised to deliver the\nfinal blow.\n\nSilently, Garry let his eyes follow around the room with its\nrepetition of the horrible being who was evidently a king. Then he\nwhistled softly. \"Nice kind of hombre, he must have been,\" he said.\nAnd, \"Boy,\" he told the carved image familiarly, \"whoever you were,\nyou've been dead a long time, and I don't mind telling you I'm glad of\nit.\"\n\nHe was slowly circling the first casket. Beyond it was the slender rod\nwith its mushroom head that seemed more like a bell as he looked from\nbelow. The head's inner surface was emblazoned, like the figures on\nthe wall, with crimson and gold in strange designs. He saw now that\nthe base of it was connected with a smaller box, placed like the two\nbeside it on a stone pedestal.\n\nHe came slowly beside it to study the box with narrowed eyes. He\nexpected the metal cover would be as immovable as the others, and he\nstarted back and caught his breath sharply as the metal raised at his\ntouch and the green radiance from above flashed back from within the\nbox in a thousand scintillant lights. Then he stooped to see the\nbrilliant, silvery sheen of metal wheels that moved on jeweled\nbearings.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA mechanism of some sort--but what? he wondered. He had some knowledge\nof the stream of electrons that discharged continuously from the light\nabove, and he knew how they could charge an electroscope that would\nautomatically discharge to produce motion. He nodded in\nhalf-understanding as the fluttering gold-leaf fell and allowed a\ntiny wheel to move one notch in its escapement.\n\n\"Clockworks!\" he told himself--it was as near as he could come to a\nname for the machine--\"and it's been running here all this time....\nWhat for, I wonder? What was it supposed to do?\"\n\nHe stared again at the bell-shape towering above him, but its purpose\nwas beyond guessing: it was a part of the machine. His eyes came back\nto the mechanism itself. There was a splinter of stone.... Garry\nreached for it unthinkingly, but his hand was checked in mid-air.\n\nThe fragment was wedged beneath a tiny lever, holding it erect.\n\"That's the answer,\" Garry whispered. \"The machine was left open,\"--he\nfelt of the cover that had been dented by some heavy blow, and saw\nsharp splinters of rock beneath his feet--\"a rock fell from the roof,\nflaked off and dropped onto the machine, and a splinter jammed this\nlittle lever. But the machine has been ticking along....\"\n\nHis fingers reached for the stone.\n\n\"Let's go!\" he said, and grinned broadly at the thoughts that were in\nhis mind. \"Let's see what the machine would have done!\"\n\nThe fragment came away within his hand, and he saw the lever fall\nslowly. There was motion within the case--wheels and shining spheres\nthat touched one upon another were spinning in gleaming circles of\nsilvery green--and from above he heard the first faint whisper of a\nsound.\n\nIt came from the bell, and Garry drew back to stare upward. The first\nsoft humming of the clear bell-note was incredibly sweet. It rose in\npitch while the volume increased, till the musical note was lost in\nthe rising roar that resounded from walls and roof. Higher it rose; it\nwas a scream that was human in its agony, prodigious in its volume!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGarry Connell stood trembling with unnamed fear. This sound was\nunbearable; it beat upon his ears; it battered his whole body; it\nsearched out every quivering nerve and tore at it with fingers of\nfire. Still higher!--and the scream was piercing and torturing his\nbrain. He felt the jerk of uncontrollable muscles.\n\nThe whirling machine was a blur of light, and he longed with every\nfibre of his tortured mind to throw himself upon it--into\nit!--anything to end the unbearable impact from on high. His body,\nassailed by a clamor that was physical torment, could not move; the\nvibrations beat him down with crushing force, while the shrieking\nvoice rose higher, then grew faint, and, with a final whisper, died to\nnothingness.\n\nAnd still Garry felt himself sinking; the room was blurred; the\nexcruciating agony of tortured nerves melted into a lethargy that\nswept through him. Dimly he sensed that the monstrous, quivering,\nbell-topped thing was still launching its devastating rain of\nvibrations; they were above the range of hearing; but he felt his body\nquivering in response to the unheard note. Then even these vague\nfragments of understanding left him. The towering, soundless thing was\nindistinct ... it vanished in the darkness that closed about....\n\nHe was upon the floor in a crouching heap when the tremors that shook\nhim ceased. His mind, in the same instant, was cleared, and he knew\nthat the soundless vibrations from the bell had ended. A wave of\nthankfulness flooded through him, and he luxuriated in the utter\nsilence of the room--until that silence was broken by another sound.\n\nIt was hard and metallic, like the click of a withdrawn bolt, and came\nfirst from the case at his side. A second sharp rap replied from the\nother raised casket, then an echoing tattoo of metallic impacts\nrattled and clattered in the resounding room. Each of the hundreds of\ncaskets was adding its voice to the clacking chorus.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe paralysis that had held Garry's muscles was gone, and he came\nslowly to his feet to see the edge of the cover he had tried vainly\nto move, rising smoothly in the air. His eyes darted about; the second\ncasket was opening; beyond were countless others; the room was alive\nwith silent motion where metal lids lifted like petals of flowers\nunfolding to the sun.\n\nThe machine had done it! The conviction came to him abruptly. Those\nvibrations that had beaten him down had done this: some unlocking\nmechanism within each case had been actuated when the vibrations\nreached the proper pitch. Then the thoughts were driven from his mind\nby a more thrilling conviction: The caskets were open! The treasure!\nWho could know what some of them might contain? He took one quick step\ntoward the nearer of the two.\n\nOne step!--and his reaching hands stopped motionless above the open\ncase. The contents of the box were plain before him--and he stared in\nhorror at the black, half-naked figure of a man as silent and unmoving\nas its counterpart upon the wall.\n\nBlack as a carving in ebony, it was the face that held Garry's eyes.\nHe saw the pointed head, the thin lips half-drawn from snarling teeth,\nthe expression of brutal savagery that even this frozen stillness\ncould not conceal.\n\nThe eyes were closed; Garry saw their slitted lids. He was looking at\nthem when they quivered and twitched. The lids opened slowly, drew\nback from staring eyes that were cold and dead--eyes that came\nsuddenly to life, that turned and stared unwinkingly, horribly, into\nhis.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGarry's lips were moving as he drew back in slow retreat, but he heard\nno sound of his own voice, only a husky whisper that said over and\nover again: \"Mummies! Caskets of mummies! And they're coming back to\nlife!\"\n\nSuspended animation. He had heard of such things. Dim, fleeting\nremembrance of what he had read came flashingly to him--toads that had\nlived a thousand years sealed up in rock--but this, a human thing, a\nman!--no, no!--it couldn't come to life; not after all this time!\n\nThe pointed head, the ugly, menacing face and the body of dead black\nthat rose slowly within the casket gave his argument the lie. In\ndreadful, living reality he saw the thing before him as it stretched\nits corded neck, extended and flexed its long, black arms and breathed\ndeeply through lips drawn thin. Then, with a bound of returning\nenergy, it leaped out and down to stand half-naked and black, towering\nthreateningly above his head.\n\nAnd Garry, too stunned to feel a sense of fear, looked first at the\nliving face before him and then at the carvings done in stone. There\nwas too much here for instant comprehension; his reason could not\nfollow fast enough where facts were leading, and his mind seemed\ngroping for some certain, proven thing.\n\n\"It's the same one that's on the wall,\" he explained painstakingly to\nhimself. \"It's the king, the old boy himself! I said he would be a bad\nhombre; I said he was a bad one--\"\n\nHe saw the other raise his hands threateningly, and he crouched to\nmeet the attack. But the black hands dropped, and the scowling face\nturned, while Garry's eyes followed toward a sound of movement in the\nsecond casket.\n\nThe green light flooded down, and Garry Connell glanced quickly at the\ndoorway. Too many of these blacks and this would be no safe place for\nhim. He was expecting another apparition like the first; he would have\nthought himself prepared against any further surprise, but his gray\neyes opened wide at what the light disclosed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was the casket, gray and lusterless on its low, stone base. Its\ncover, like the others, stood erect, and above the nearer edge an arm\nwas raising. But it was a white arm, and it ended in a slim, white\nhand!--its rounded softness held in clear outline against the back\nground of gray, until the arm fell that the hand might grip the metal\nedge.\n\nGarry's eyes held in wondering fascination upon those slender white\nfingers. The hand of a woman--a girl!--what marvel of miracles was\nthis? He held his silent pose while he stared at the face that\nappeared before him.\n\nIt was milk-white against the dull gray metal beyond, the white of\ndeath itself, until returning circulation brought a flush of pink that\ncrept slowly to the rounded cheeks. Dark hair cascaded about the\nshoulders to mingle with a lacy veil of golden threads. A film of\ngolden lace wrapped about her--her robes had gone to dust, vanished\nwith the vanished years--and only the threads of gold with which the\nrobe was shot remained, a futile concealment for the slim white of her\nshoulders, the soft curves of rounded breasts. But Garry's eyes were\nheld by the eyes that looked and locked with his.\n\nDark eyes, deep and steady, yet glowing softly with the wonder of this\nawakening. Windows, crystal clear, through which shone softly a light\nthat filled him through and through!\n\nAlluring as was the rounded whiteness of the form so thinly veiled, it\nwas not this nor the childlike beauty of the face that held him\nspellbound. Garry Connell's only love had been the desert, and now he\nwas filled and shaken by the glamour from within these thrilling eyes.\n\nA rasping word made echoes in the silence, and Garry saw the girl's\neyes widen as she turned them upon the black one, who had spoken. He\nsaw her face lose its color and go dead white, and plainly her wide\neyes showed the fears that swept in upon her with returning\nremembrance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGarry followed her gaze to the wild figure whose slitted eyes\nglittered in savage triumph and possessiveness at the white beauty of\nthe trembling girl. The lean figure spoke again in that rasping,\nunintelligible voice--he addressed the girl now--and the tone sent a\nstrange prickling of animosity through every fibre of the watching\nman.\n\nThe black one took one stride forward; the girl, in a flash of white\nand gold, sprang from her resting place to take shelter behind the\nhigh casket. Her eyes came back to Garry's, and the call for help\nthough voiceless was none the less real.\n\nThen her pale lips moved, and she called to him with a clear voice\nthat uttered unknown words.\n\nGarry came from the spell that bound him, and with a quick rush made\nbetween her and the advancing man. He landed tense and crouching, and\nhis voice was hoarse with excitement when he spoke.\n\n\"That'll be all from you,\" he told the black one.\n\nHis words could mean nothing to this savage, but the tone that rang\nthrough them, and his crouching, ready pose, must have been plain. The\ninky face beneath the high-pointed dome of head was twisted with rage;\nthe eyes glared at this being who dared to oppose him. But the black\none paused, then stepped backward to the casket where he had been.\n\nGarry retreated a few slow steps to the end of the metal box that\nsheltered the girl. \"Can't you understand me?\" he asked. \"Am I\ndreaming? What has happened? Who are you, and who is this black beast?\nWhat does it all mean?\"\n\nAgain he was sure that mere speech useless, but he felt that he had to\nspeak, to say something, anything, to prove the reality of his own\nwaking self and of the wild, nightmare experience.\n\nHe saw the crouching girl rise to her full height; he saw the movement\nof her hand as she swept the dark hair away from her face, and the\nfilm of gold lace clung closely about her as she came to his side.\nOne hand was outstretched to rest, light and cool, upon his forehead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe heard her voice, so soft and liquid yet so charged with terror. She\nspoke meaningless words and phrases, but at the touch of her hand upon\nhis face he started abruptly.\n\nDid the words themselves take on meaning and coherence, or was it\nsomething within himself?--Garry could not have told. But, with the\nstartling clarity of a radio switched full on, he got the impress of\nher thoughts, and his own brain took them and put them into words that\nhe knew.\n\n\"You will help me, you will save me,\" the words were saying. \"You are\none of us, I know. You are a stranger, but your skin is white; you are\nnot of the tribe of Horab.\"\n\nGarry was motionless and listening. He knew he was sensing her\nthoughts--she was communicating with him by some telepathic magic--and\nhe knew, as he caught the words, that Horab was the black one there\nbefore him, reaching and feeling within the casket where he had slept.\nHorab--a savage king of a savage land--\n\n\"He captured me,\" the words continued in breathless haste. \"I am from\nZahn: do you know the good land of Zahn? I am Luhra. Horab captured\nme; carried me here to this island; it was yesterday he brought me\nhere. He put me to sleep, and he put his men to sleep, hundreds of his\nchosen warriors. He worked his magic, and he said we would sleep for\none hundred summers. But it was yesterday. And now you will save me;\nmy father is a great man; he will reward you--\"\n\nThe sentences flashed almost incoherently into his mind, but ceased at\na sound and stirring from the room at their backs.\n\nGarry needed a moment for the substance of the message to register. He\nhad heard it as truly as if she had spoken: Horab had captured\nher--yesterday!... And his own lips that had been loose with\nastonishment closed to a grim smile.\n\n\"Yesterday!\" She thought it was yesterday that her long night had\nbegun. Did Horab know the truth? Garry was suddenly certain that he\ndid. Horab's plans had miscarried; he could not know how far in a\ndistant past was that day when he had placed himself and this girl in\ntheir caskets, safe in their mountain tomb.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnly an instant for these thoughts to form--then his eyes were steady\nupon the tall savage who had found what he sought in the big metal\ncase. Horab, king of a vanished race, turned now with a heavy scepter\nin his hand; and its jeweled head flashed brilliantly as he raised it\nhigh in air and shouted an echoing command into the room. A white hand\nwas tugging at Garry's shoulder, a soft body clinging close, to turn\nhim where new danger threatened.\n\nThe other caskets! He had forgotten them, and he saw the nearer ones\nalive with struggling forms. A black man-shape, with sullen, animal\nface and pointed head, came slowly erect and staggered upon the floor.\nAnother--and another! There were scores of the black, naked men who\nscrambled from the nearer caskets and swayed drunkenly upon their\nfeet.\n\nGarry stood tense, his mind a chaos of half-formed plans. This one\nbrute he might handle, but the whole tribe--that was too large an\norder. Yet he knew with an unshakable conviction that he would carry\nthis girl from their evil clutches or die in the trying.\n\nFeminine charms had failed to interest Garry in that world outside,\nbut now the message of these soft eyes, the appealing beauty of this\nlovely face, proud and unafraid despite her fears, the hand so soft\nand trusting upon his face!--there had something entered into Garry\nConnell's lonely life that struck deep within him and found a ready\nresponse.\n\nHe swept one arm about the soft, yielding body beneath its wisp of\ngarment, and he swung her behind him as he set himself to meet the\nattack. And he flashed her a look that must have carried a message,\nfor the trembling lips were framing a ghost of a smile as her eyes met\nhis.\n\nGarry's thoughts darted to the gun, but his tightly-wrapped pack was\nin the passage outside. He prayed for a moment's time that he might\nmeet this mob pistol in hand, and he half turned; but no time was\ngiven. The leader was shouting orders, his harsh voice resounded in\nshattering echoes throughout the stone vault, and the horde of blacks\nsurged forward at his command.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA mass of lean bodies, with faces ugly and brutal where sleep-filled\neyes opened wide and glaring! They crowded upon him, and Garry met the\nrush with a rain of straight rights and lefts into the nearest faces.\nHe was carried backward to the wall by the weight of their numbers,\nbut he saw some go down for the count.\n\nThe room seemed filled with leaping, shouting men. Their shrill cries\nechoed in a tumult of discord, and above all Garry heard the hoarse\nscreams of their leader.\n\nThere were fists and arms clubbing at his head. He warded them off,\nthen sprang from the wall, leaping outward and sideways, where there\nwas room for free swings of his pounding fists. Another black face\nwent blank under the impact of his blow--a second--and a third!\n\nHe was giving ground slowly as the others came on. Then beyond the\ncrowding figures he saw one who held a trident spear high in air. The\nweapon was poised; the metal points shone in the green light--points\nthat would tear his body to shreds at a single blow.\n\nGarry paused but an instant, then opened his clenched fists to clutch\nthe lean neck of an enemy before him. He whirled the man's body and\nheld it as a shield while he reached vainly to grip at the thrusting\nspear. Dimly he saw the flash of white and gold where the girl,\nLuhra, threw her own body upon the armed figure and clung in\ndesperation to the shaft of the deadly weapon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGarry hung fast to the struggling body, that was his shield; there\nwere other spears now that flashed in the air. He loosed one hand and\nlanded a short jab in the face of a savage whose hands were at his\nthroat. The blow was light, and he was amazed to see the man stagger\nand fall. There were others who swayed helplessly and stumbled to\ntheir knees. Spears rang sharply, clattering upon the stone.... They\nwere falling. The body he held went suddenly limp within his arms and\nsagged heavily to the floor....\n\nGarry saw the one who had threatened him drop; he took the girl with\nhim as he fell, and his spear flew wildly from his open hand. Garry\nwas alone!--and the enemy was only a tangle of sprawling bodies where\nthe twitching of an outflung arm marked the last sign of life.\n\nHe was breathing hard, for some of the enemies' blows had landed, and\nhe staggered as he wiped a trickle of blood from his eyes. No time to\nfigure what this meant, but the blacks were certainly out of it.\nBeyond the huddled bodies the tall figure of Horab leaped wildly in\nair as he sprang forward, and in the same instant Garry threw himself\nbetween the black menace and the prostrate girl.\n\nHe staggered again as he landed from his wild leap, and he called for\nhis last reserve of strength to put power behind the blow that he\nlaunched for the snarling face above.\n\nThe heavy scepter swung high, and was falling as Garry struck. He saw\nthe blow start; saw the fiery arc the jeweled head made in descending\nlike a mace above his head. Then the face of Horab vanished, and the\nroom was a whirling place of flashing red and yellow before blackness\nblotted it out....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGarry awoke to blink stupidly at a green light above him. His head was\na blinding, throbbing pain that blurred his thoughts.\n\nIt cleared slowly. The gleaming figure of a girl was rising from the\nfloor. His aching eyes saw the white of her young body through the\ndull glow of golden lace. Her eyes came to his, and sharply he\nrealized that this was no dream--this cave whose walls seemed swaying,\nthe face that was staring pitifully at him, and, beyond, in a ghastly\ngreen light, the dark silhouette of a lean man who bent his pointed\nhead above a chest.\n\nConnell's mind was a whirl of snarled thoughts and emotions, of\npuzzled wonder and fighting rage; yet strangely through and above them\nall was a feeling of pure joy in the message of the eyes in a face\nthat was utterly lovely.\n\nThe black figure had opened the chest. Garry saw the luminous green\nabout it shot through with the reflected radiance of many gems. Jewels\ncascaded brilliantly from the lean black hands as they withdrew a\ngolden cord. Part of some gem-incrusted fabric, it was, that he tore\nroughly from its rotted fastenings before coming swiftly to the still\nhelpless body of Connell.\n\nGarry's struggles were futile; his hands were tied before him. The\nshooting pain of a prodding spear brought him from the paralyzing\nnumbness that held him, and he came dizzily to his feet. Again the\nwalls whirled, and he would have fallen headlong but for a lithe, soft\nbody that sprang close to throw white arms about him.\n\nThrough blood-shot eyes he saw Luhra, of the land of Zahn, with head\nheld high and flashing eyes as she turned squarely to face the savage\nblack. And he heard the stream of strange sentences that she poured\nprotestingly upon him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer message broke off abruptly. Garry's eyes followed hers to watch a\nsavage king, naked but for the tattered remnants of robes that time\nhad eaten. He was reaching, into a casket that had once held kingly\nraiment--reaching with a lean black hand that brought forth only\nfragments of purple and crimson cloth that went quickly to dust within\nhis hands.\n\nGarry saw the slitted eyes stare in puzzled wonder at the rotted\ncloth, then glance sharply and inquiringly about. He saw the black one\nplace a jeweled head-dress of barbaric splendor upon his ugly, pointed\nhead, then rise and cross slowly to the heap of bodies. Spear in hand,\nhe passed on to the serried rows of caskets.\n\nThose nearest were empty, as Garry knew; he had seen the eruption of\nlife from within them. Horab, with a growled word, moved on to the\nother caskets that stretched out across the room. The ugly head\nstooped; again the hands reached down, to come back this time with an\nempty, gleaming skull.\n\nGarry thought once of his pistol, but knew in the same thought that he\ncould never reach it; the spear of Horab would crash through him at\nthe first movement. He dismissed the thought--forgot it--and forgot\nall else in the fascination of beholding the sagging lips and the\nscowling stupefaction on the black face of Horab. And slowly there\ncame to his throbbing brain an explanation.\n\nOne hundred summers, Luhra had said--Horab had meant to sleep for a\nhundred years--and the machine that was to waken him had failed to\nfunction. Ages beyond computing had passed, and these two only, the\nblack king and the girl, had survived. They had been directly beneath\nthe light; its flooding energy had brought them safely through the\ndreamless years. But, for the others, it had been different.\n\nThose nearest the light had responded to the vibrating call, but their\nvitality was gone; their moment of life was short. As for the hundreds\nwho had felt the light but faintly--the skull told the story. They\nhad died as they slept, died thousands of years ago, and their\nskeletons were all that remained to mock at their king and the\nfrustration of his plans.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut what was the purpose of the long sleep? Luhra's touch and her\nsoundless words supplied the answer.\n\n\"Why did he wish this?\" her mind said, repeating his question.\n\"Horab's own country was lost; the yellow-ones from across the great\nwater had conquered and overrun it. But Horab had planted the seeds of\ndisease, and the yellow ones must all die in time. Horab is a king and\na worker of magic; he is in league with a devil; he learns his magic\nof him. We of Zahn, all feared the magic of Horab--\" She stopped at\nthe quiver of rock beneath their feet.\n\nGarry's mind had cleared, but it was an instant before he knew that\nthe movement was not in his own throbbing head. Then the earth tremor\ncame unmistakably, and his thoughts flashed back to the mass of rock\nabove the mouth of the cave. If more quakes were coming they must get\nout, and do it at once--\n\nThe black hand of King Horab cast the skull vindictively against the\nwall, and the clatter of its falling fragments mingled with strange\noaths from the savage lips. Then he came toward the two and Garry\nsearched his mind desperately for some means of escape.\n\nThe trident spear was aimed, and Garry waited for the throw. He felt,\nmore than saw, the flash of light that was Luhra as she sprang for a\nspear beside the fallen men. An instant and she was before him, tense\nand poised, a golden Amazon, whose upraised arm and steady eyes\nchecked even Horab in his advance.\n\nShe spoke to the savage in sharp, staccato phrases, but Garry got no\nmeaning from the words. There was a quick interchange between them;\nvehement protest and shaking of his poised spear on the part of\nHorab. Luhra added a word or two, and she lowered her weapon as Horab\ndid the same.\n\nHer head was bowed as she reached to touch Garry's forehead. He sensed\na hopeless sorrow that was so plainly hers, but with it he felt a\nmingling of another emotion that stirred him to the depths of his\nbeing. The slim, white figure straightened, and the dark eyes squarely\nupon his when she spoke.\n\n\"Listen carefully,\" she said; \"it is the last time--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGarry found himself trembling; he was suddenly breathless with\nemotion. The racking pain in his head had settled to a dull ache, but\nhis brain was clear, and through it were flashing strange thoughts.\n\nThe threat, the wild adventure itself!--they were nothing before the\ntruth that was so plain to him now. He loved this girl! he loved\nher!--and his whole self responded with an inflow of fresh energy at\nthe thought. A stranger from a strange, lost world!--but what of\nit?--he loved her!... The message from the lips and fingers of the\ngirl broke in upon the thoughts that were crying for expression.\n\n\"You think of me.\" She smiled with her lips and eyes. \"I am glad that\nyou do, my dear one, but it is hopeless.\n\n\"Listen: I have promised; Luhra has spoken: I will go with Horab to do\nas he wills. I will go freely, and he will leave you here unharmed. He\npromises me this.\n\n\"I will go with Horab far across the blue water that surrounds us\nhere. It is an island, as you know, for have you not come here from\nafar?\" Garry broke in with a startled exclamation. An island! Water!\nHe closed his lips upon the denial of her words.\n\n\"And you,\" Luhra continued unheeding, \"when we have gone, will return\nto your own land.\n\n\"But, oh, my dear one, remember always I love you. I have read your\nthoughts, oh bravest and tenderest of men; I loved you from the\nmoment when my eyes opened and found you waiting there. I am telling\nyou now, for I will never see you again.\" She broke in upon the wild\nurge of protest that filled his mind.\n\nWith an imperious gesture she motioned Horab to discard his spear, and\nshe placed hers beside it on the rocky floor. But she flinched and\nretreated from the outstretched arms and grasping hands, while Garry\nConnell struggled in insane frenzy at the cords that bound his wrists.\n\nHe felt the lean hands of Horab upon him, and the long arms held him\nin a crushing grip. And he saw the black face laugh evilly at the\nwatching girl as Horab kicked the spears over beside the casket where\nshe had been.\n\nGarry felt himself raised in air, and he was as helpless as a child in\nthat grasp. An instant later he was thrown heavily, to lie bruised and\nbreathless in the metal box where first he had seen Luhra's face in\nwide-eyed awakening.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rasping voice of Horab rose high and shrill. He was shouting\ntriumphantly at the girl, while his hands worked to bind Garry's feet.\nLuhra's head and shoulders showed above the casket edge as she circled\nswiftly to approach from the opposite side and reach a trembling hand\nthat would make the contact necessary for thought transference. Her\ncool touch was upon him; Garry ceased his futile struggle while her\nwords came, brokenly to his mind.\n\n\"Horab has tricked us,\" she cried; \"he is leaving you here. He will\nparalyze you with the devil song of the bell, but not to sleep as I\ndid: it will stop on another note. He says you will be always awake,\nbut helpless--thinking--thinking--always!\"\n\nShe buried her face in her hands to hide from his gaze the horror that\nwas in her eyes. Garry Connell's straining hands went limp. The terror\nin the girl's voice struck through his own wild medley of thoughts to\nmake him shudder with realization of the truth.\n\nThe threat was real! If Horab left the cave and took Luhra with him,\nthe two would die in the desert. The black savage would never dare to\nface the strange, new world. And he, Garry, would be here in this\ncave, in this very coffin, held in a waking death. No one knew he was\nhere; only by chance would the cave be investigated. And when someone\nfinally came!\n\nGarry stared in fascination at the green light. He knew with terrible\ncertainty that whatever help might come would come too late. To lie\nthere hour after hour, for days and then for years--waiting!--always\nwaiting!... And he could never still his thoughts.... He had a\nsickening realization of the thing they would find. A body!--his\nbody!--and the mind within it utterly insane....\n\nThe sound of the shrieking bell was in his ears, and his nerves were\ntrembling in response. He saw long arms above the casket, tearing away\nthe figure of a struggling girl.... And then he knew he was alone....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sound of the bell rose to the piercing, nerve-shredding scream he had\nheard before. He must think fast--and act!--but the numbness of brain and\nmuscle was creeping upon him. He tried to call out, but his throat was\ntight, and would not respond. The echoes died into silence; the\nvibrations, as before, passed beyond audible range. He was sinking ...\nsinking....\n\nDimly he felt the casket shaking beneath him. In some distant corner\nof his mind he knew that the earthquake shocks had turned. Then he\nheard with ear-splitting plainness the shrieking discord as the tremor\nshook the vibrating machine to silence.\n\nThe room was quiet; the paralysis left him; and in the instant of his\nrelease the clear brain of Garry Connell flashed from chaos to lay\nbefore him a full-formed plan.\n\n\"Luhra!\" he called in the silent room. \"Luhra!\" But it seemed an age\nbefore he heard Horab and his captive returning from the passage. Then\nthe touch of her hand gave him courage to continue.\n\n\"Yes?\" she whispered; \"yes, my dear one?\"\n\nHe saw the shoulders of the black as he half-raised a spear\nthreateningly toward the girl, then turned to adjust the whirring\nmachine.\n\n\"Tell him,\" shouted Garry, \"--tell Horab to shut off that damnable\nmachine!\" The shriek of it was rising again to drown his voice. \"Tell\nhim his life depends upon it. Tell him to listen to what I say or he\nwill die.\"\n\nHe heard the girl's voice raised in a high-pitched call, and he heard\nthe rasping snarl of Horab in reply. The girl repeated her cry above\nthe echoing clamor of the bell--and the intolerable, rising scream,\nafter a time, was stilled.\n\nGarry experienced one raging moment when he would have given his hope\nof life for the ability to talk to Horab face to face and in words\nthat could penetrate the black one's brain. But he could not. He must\nuse this girl as an interpreter, and he must give her words to say\nthat would make this ugly beast pause. He must speak as she would\nspeak; put words and sentences into her mouth that would reach the\nsavage superstitions of the other.\n\nHe spoke slowly, and stared impressively into the dark, fear-filled\neyes in the white face that bent above him. He must make the girl\nbelieve.\n\n\"Horab works magic,\" he told her. \"Tell Horab that I, too, am a\nmagician--a great magician--a greater one than Horab.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe waited an instant to hear the girl's words and the disdainful\nlaughter from lips in a savage face thrust close to where he lay.\n\n\"Horab is truly a magician,\" said Luhra doubtfully; \"he laughs at your\nmagic. Horab's _Tao_ is a strong _Tao_, wicked and powerful.\"\n\n\"His _Tao_?\" said Garry, and looked at the girl questioningly. He got\nthe thought in her mind. \"Oh, yes--his god, or devil.\"\n\nHe turned his head to stare straight into the grinning face whose wide,\nthin lips were twisted into a leering snarl. Garry had to summon all\nhis power of will to hold the look that he gave his enemy and to\nlaugh, in his turn, long and contemptuously. Another tremor shook the\ncasket where he lay.\n\n\"Tell Horab,\" he ordered, while his eyes stared steadily into those of\nthe savage king, \"--tell Horab my _Tao_ is stronger than his. My _Tao_\nis angry because I have been harmed; he is shaking the mountain. He\nwill shake it down on Horab and crush out his life.\"\n\nHe continued to stare while he heard Luhra's voice, high with hope,\nand he saw a change of expression flicker across the black face,\nthough Horab shouted a vehement reply.\n\nLuhra was speaking to him. \"Horab says the earth has shaken before;\nthat it is not your _Tao_ who shakes it. He asks for another sign.\"\n\nGarry was not surprised. He had fired this shot at random; the tremor\nitself had suggested it. And now--\n\n\"Another sign!\" Garry had to fight hard for self-control to keep from\nshouting the truth to this evil thing--to keep from telling him of the\ntime that had passed, and of the world that was waiting for him. But\nthat would never do: he must play upon this black one's superstitions.\nLet Horab once leave this cave with that devilish, soundless scream\nringing in his ears and he, Garry Connell, was lost. And Luhra!--what\nhope for her out there?... The black hands were moving impatiently\ntoward the machine....\n\nGarry found himself speaking slowly--short sentences that Luhra\nquickly repeated. And something within him rose to frame words such as\nGarry Connell, man of the desert, would never have thought to\nspeak--phrases that best might reach a savage, vicious mind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe glanced once at the watch on his wrist. He did not feel the torture\nof the tight gold cord. He was thinking in terms of daylight, and of\nhow much time had passed since he had seen the sun....\n\n\"Horab shall have a sign--a terrible sign,\" he said. \"Death waits for\nHorab in the world outside, my _Tao_ tells me. Horab shall die\nhorribly. I see him choking in the hot sand. His tongue fills his\nmouth. The hot sun burns, and he is filled with fire. He tries to\nscream--to call upon his _Tao_--but he makes no sound.... And so shall\nHorab die.\"\n\nThe girl translated swiftly; the answer was a wild cry of rage from\nthe black. He sprang beside the helpless man and his spear was raised\nhigh.\n\nGarry felt the weight of Luhra's body thrown protectingly across him,\nand looked up to see murder in the savage, slitted eyes. \"Tell Horab,\"\nhe directed sharply, \"that if be harms you or me the burning death is\nhis! But--\" He waited deliberately after Luhra had spoken, and he saw\nplainly the flicker of fear in the ugly face. Now was the time.\n\n\"Unbind my feet!\" he ordered, and he put into his voice all the force\nand menace he could muster. \"Take me to the outer world. Take your\nspear. If I do not speak truth, kill me there. My _Tao_ will show you\na sign; he will fill your heart with fear as it now is filled with\nevil. But, it may be I can save you. Unbind my feet! Be quick!\"\n\nAgain he waited while Luhra spoke, and he cursed silently with the\nagony of waiting. To be playing a part, speaking these absurdly\nchildish things, when what he wanted was his hand upon a gun or in a\ngrip of death about that black throat! Yet he lay as still as if the\nvibrations of the bell were upon him, and his eyes held unwaveringly\nupon the savage face, until he felt the fumbling of hands about his\nfeet....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA square-cut portal!--and beyond it a golden sun that shone through\nmists of purple and rose! Was he too late? Garry pressed forward in\nwhat would have been a clumsy run, but for the spear that had prodded\nhim through all the long passage, and that warned now against\nattempted escape.\n\nThe brilliance and heat that struck him when he stepped, out into the\nopen brought Garry in a flash from the world of horror and\nmake-believe into the world he knew. He wanted to shout for sheer joy;\nbut more than all else he wanted to leap at the ugly thing who stood\nblinking his eyes in the mouth of the cave.\n\nThe thought of escape was strong upon him, but the touch of a timid\nhand showed the folly of that. Luhra was beside him, her filmy\nlacework shining softly in the sun, to make more lovely the delicate\nflush beneath. Her eyes, shielded from the sun, were upon him with a\nlook half hopeful, half despairing. No, he must see it through--go on\nwith his play-acting--meet magic with magic. Horab had come out from\nthe cave, and spear in hand he stood commandingly above them on a huge\nboulder. Yes, the magic must go on.\n\nThe harsh voice of the savage ripped out unintelligible words. Luhra\ntranslated. \"It is changed,\" she said, \"and Horab fears. But the water\nis there, and there is no burning death.... He says your _Tao_ is\nweak.\"\n\nGarry stared with thankful eyes across the blue expanse where a line\nof white marked ghostly breakers on a distant shore; where hills were\nreflected in the shimmering blue. But the sun was still above their\ntops, so he must spar for time--\n\n\"My _Tao_ is strong,\" he said, and went on with whatever fantastic\nthoughts came into his mind. He was talking against time. He told of\nthe new world his _Tao_ had built, of men harnessing the lightning and\nflying through the air; of cannon that roared like the thunder and\nthrew death and destruction upon those that the _Tao_ would\ndestroy.... And his eyes watched the slow descent of the dropping sun,\nwhile the figure above stirred impatiently and raised his spear.\n\n\"A sign!\" Luhra was imploring. \"He does not believe!\"\n\nThe golden ball was touching now on a distant, purple peak. The\namazing magic of the desert!--its moment had come! Garry indicated as\nbest he could the phantom sea, so real, below.\n\n\"My _Tao_ has spoken,\" he shouted: \"watch! The waters shall be dried\nup; the seas shall become a desert of hot sand; the lands and waters\nthat Horab knows shall be no more! There shall be no food for his\nstomach nor water for his lips where Horab wanders in torment....\nUnless I save him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned to stare at the vast mirage. He knew that the eyes of the\nothers had followed his, and he knew that they saw the first change\nthat crept over the land.\n\nThe blue that was so unmistakably a sea was dissolving; it seemed\nsucked into the sand. And, while yet the hot rays cast their lingering\ngold over mountain and plain, the seas faded and were gone ... and\nwhere they had been in unquestioned reality was only yellow sand that\nwhirled hotly and drifted in the first breath of the coming night....\n\nThe towering figure above them stood rigid. Garry had found a sharp\nedge of rock, and sawed frantically upon it to cut the soft gold of\nthe cords at his wrists. The one above them paid no heed; his eyes\nwere held in horror of this silent death that swept across the world.\n\nThe hand that Garry extended was steady and cautious; his arm crept\nabout the body of white and gold to draw the amazed and wondering girl\nsilently into the open cave.\n\n\"Follow!\" he ordered, and dashed headlong down the darkened way where\nan automatic was waiting for his eager fingers.\n\nThe pack was there, and he tore at it with frenzied hands to grip at\nthe pistol within. And there was also an open chest whose contents\nglittered in the green light, and whose weight was not too great for\nhim to carry....\n\nHe had both chest and gun when he returned. The stumbling falls in his\nmad rush had not served to allay the hurts of his tortured body, nor\nstill his raging fury. He called to Luhra as he ran--and realized that\nLuhra was gone. The chest fell forgotten at his feet as he rushed out;\nhe shouted her name and cursed himself for leaving her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHad the fascination of the outer world drawn her back? Had she trusted\ntoo greatly in the power of his Tao to shield her from harm? Connell\ncould not know. He knew only that he saw her struggling in the grip of\nthe long arms where the black one held her on an outthrust rock.\n\nThey were a hundred feet away, yet the black face beneath its pointed\nskull showed plainly its bestial fury as Garry sprang forward. With\none motion the tall figure dashed the girl to the stone at his feet\nand raised his spear. He paused to laugh harshly at the man who rushed\ntoward him--who could never reach him to stop the fatal thrust.\n\nA threat, it might have been, to hold the attacker off, or a murderous\nintent to end now and forever this one captive's life: Garry did not\nwait to learn. And the hundred-foot distance that meant a hundred feet\nof safety to the savage was spanned by a stream of lead from a gun\nwhose stabbing flashes cracked sharply upon the still air. The ringing\nclatter of a spear that fell among granite stones came thinly to Garry\nas he saw the black form of Horab, king of another day, spin dizzily\nfrom the rock on which he stood.\n\nHe had hit him--wounded him at least--and the firing of that wild\nfusillade might have emptied the magazine! Gary waited for nothing\nmore, but gathered the limp body of the girl within his outstretched\narms and carried her stumblingly across the welter of rocks on the\nboulder-strewn slope. Nor did he stop until he had gained the safety\nof open ground beyond the marks of the great slide.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe earth was shivering and weaving as he laid her down; a rock\ncrashed sharply in the distance. Garry turned to retrace his steps and\nleap wildly from rock to rock toward the mouth of the cave in a\ngranite cliff. And the metal chest was in his arms when he returned\nwhere Luhra waited.\n\nThe ground was alive with sickening motion, he was nauseated with\nearthquake sickness, but he gave thought only to his gun and the one\ncartridge that he found in the chamber. He steadied his arm upon a\nrock to take aim at a figure on a distant slope.\n\nHorab had climbed back upon the rock. A lean figure and black, he was\nsharply outlined in the last rays of the setting sun; the target was\nclear beyond the pistol's sights. But the fingers of the grim-faced\nman refused to tighten upon the trigger.\n\nSavage and cruel--a relic of a bygone age! He stood there, ludicrous\nand unreal in his stark black nakedness, his frayed robes of crimson\nwhipping to tatters in the breeze. Yet he had forgotten his\nwounds--Horab was standing upright--and Garry's hand that held the\npistol fell loosely at his side. The hate melted from his heart as he\nwatched where Horab drew himself painfully erect.\n\nA barbarous figure was Horab, and evil beyond redemption, yet there\nwere not lacking the attributes of a king in the grotesque form whose\nhead was still held high. The sun made flashing brilliance of the\njewels on that distorted head, while he stared with hopeless, savage\neyes across the changed world where he could have no part. His _Tao_\nhad failed him; his enemy had struck him down; and now--\n\nThe rock that had been a rest for Garry's arm was swaying, and to his\nears came a rumble and groan. Sentinel Mountain, that had watched the\nages pass, that had seen the oceans truly change to sand, protested\nagain at this disturbance of its own long sleep.\n\nGarry heard the coming of the masses from above; the crashing din was\ndeadening to his ears. They were safe--and his eyes were upon a savage\nfigure, black and tall, that stared and stared, silently, across a sea\nof yellow sand. He watched it, clear-cut, motionless--until it\nvanished beneath the roaring flood of rocks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd close in his arms there pressed the soft body of a trembling girl\nwho touched his face and whispered: \"Your _Tao_, my brave one, is\nstrong. Hold me closely that he may count me as your friend.\"\n\nHis own whispered words, though differing somewhat, were a fervent\necho of hers. He saw the rocky masses piled high where the mouth of a\ncave had been; and \"Thank God!\" Garry Connell said, \"we got out of\nthere in time!\"\n\nThe casket of jewels lay neglected among the rocks: to-morrow would be\ntime enough to salvage the wealth for which he had risked his life. He\nswept the girl into his arms, and the sun's last rays made golden\nsplendor of his burden as he carried her across the broken stones.\n\nHis ranch showed far below him when he stopped, but the green of date\npalms had vanished under the last great sweep of rocks. Some few that\nremained made dark splotches among the shadows that were engulfing the\nworld.\n\nWhat did it matter? Miramar--\"Beautiful Sea!\" He laughed grimly at\nthought of how that sea had served him, but his eyes were tender in\nhis tanned and blood-stained face.\n\nMiramar could be restored. And it would be less lonely now....\n\n\nROBOT CHEMIST\n\nA robot chemist with an electric eye, radio brain and magnet hands\nfunctioned without human supervision in an improvised laboratory\nrecently before members of the New York Electrical Society.\n\nThe automatic chemist performed several experiments. Its work was\nexplained by William C. MacTavish, professor of chemistry at New York\nUniversity, and was part of a program in which cold light was\nreproduced, a sample weighing a millionth of a gram analyzed, a\nphoto-electric cell used to control analysis and new scientific\napparatus demonstrated.\n\nIn his talk on \"The Magic of Modern Chemistry,\" Professor MacTavish\ndemonstrated the separation of para-hydrogen and ortho-hydrogen. In\nthe micro-analysis of a millionth of a gram, Professor MacTavish\nexhibited in the micro-projector a ball of gold weighing one\nthousandth of a milligram (one twenty-eight millionth of an ounce),\nhaving a value of less than one ten-thousandth of a cent.\n\nThe robot chemist was the joint creation of Dr. H. M. Partridge and\nProfessor Ralph H. Muller of the department of chemistry at New York\nUniversity. In explaining what the automatic chemist can do, Professor\nMacTavish said:\n\n\"The ability of the automatic chemist to control chemical operations\nis due to its sensitivity to slight variations in color and light\nintensity. Its working parts are very simple. They consist of a\nstandard light source, in this case an electric light, a\nphoto-electric cell which detects differences in the amount of light\nimpinging on it, a radio tube which amplifies the signal received from\nthe photo-electric cell and which operates the relays controlling the\nautomatic valves.\n\n\"Between the electric light and the photo-electric cell is placed a\nglass vessel holding an alkali that is to be neutralized. Above is a\ntube from which an acid passes, drop by drop, through an automatic\nvalve, into the alkali. A small amount of chemical indicator added to\nthe alkali maintains a red color in it until it is neutralized. When a\nsufficient amount of the acid has dropped into the alkali, the red\ncolor disappears, indicating complete neutralization.\n\n\"When the solution is colored red, an insufficient amount of lights\ngets through to the photo-electric cell. As the red color gradually\ndiminishes, the amount of light passing through increases, and when\nthe solution is entirely clear the light reaches a critical value\nwhich causes the photo-electric cell to pass a signal to the radio\ntube. This tube operates the relay which closes a valve and shuts off\nthe supply of acid.\n\n\"Using a device of this sort to perform such operations around a\nlaboratory will save a great deal of a chemist's time. Its electric\neye is about 165 times as sensitive to differences in color as any\nhuman eye.\"\n\n\n\n\nBeyond the Vanishing Point\n\nA COMPLETE NOVELETTE\n\n_By Ray Cummings_\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_The Fragment of Quartz_\n\n[Sidenote: The tale of a golden atom--an astounding adventure in\nsize.]\n\n[Illustration: The fly landed with a thud on the center table.]\n\n\nIt was shortly after noon of December 31, 1960, when the series of\nweird and startling events began which took me into the tiny world of\nan atom of gold, beyond the vanishing point, beyond the range of even\nthe highest-powered electric-microscope. My name is George Randolph. I\nwas, that momentous afternoon, assistant chemist for the Ajax\nInternational Dye Company, with main offices in New York City.\n\nIt was twelve-twenty when the local exchange call-sorter announced\nAlan's connection from Quebec.\n\n\"You, George? Look here, we've got to have you up here at once.\nChateau Frontenac, Quebec. Will you come?\"\n\nI could see his face imaged in the little mirror on my desk; the\nanxiety, tenseness in his voice, was duplicated in his expression.\n\n\"Well--\" I began.\n\n\"You must, George. Babs and I need you. See here--\"\n\nHe tried at first to make it sound like an invitation for a New Year's\nEve holiday. But I knew it was not that. Alan and Barbara Kent were my\nbest friends. They were twins, eighteen years old. I felt that Alan\nwould always be my best friend; but for Babs my hopes, longings, went\nfar deeper, though as yet I had never brought myself to the point of\ntelling her so.\n\n\"I'd like to come, Alan. But--\"\n\n\"You must! George, I can't tell you over the public air. It's--I've\nseen _him_! He's diabolical! I know it now!\"\n\n_Him!_ It could only mean, of all the world, one person!\n\n\"He's here!\" he went on. \"Near here. We've seen him to-day! I didn't\nwant to tell you, but that's why we came. It seemed a long chance, but\nit's he, I'm positive!\"\n\nI was staring at the image of Alan's eyes; it seemed that there was\nhorror in them. And in his voice. \"God, George, it's weird! Weird, I\ntell you. His looks--he--oh I can't tell you now! Only, come!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was busy at the office in spite of the holiday season, but I dropped\neverything and went. By one o'clock that afternoon I was wheeling my\nlittle sport midge from its cage on the roof of the Metropole\nbuilding, and went into the air.\n\nIt was a cold gray afternoon with the feel of coming snow. I made a\ngood two hundred and fifty miles at first, taking the northbound\nthrough-traffic lane which to-day the meteorological conditions had\nplaced at 6,200 feet altitude.\n\nFlying is largely automatic. There was not enough traffic to bother\nme. The details of leaving the office so hastily had been too\nengrossing for thought of Alan and Babs. But now, in my little pit at\nthe controls, my mind flung ahead. They had located him. That meant\nFranz Polter, for whom we had been searching nearly four years. And my\nmemory went back into the past with vivid vision....\n\nThe Kents, four years ago, were living on Long Island. Alan and Babs\nwere fourteen years old, and I was seventeen. Even then Babs\nrepresented to me all that was desirable in girlhood. I lived in a\nneighboring house that summer and saw them every day.\n\nTo my adolescent mind a thrilling mystery hung upon the Kent family.\nThe mother was dead. Dr. Kent, father of Alan and Babs, maintained a\nluxurious home, with only a housekeeper and and no other servant. Dr.\nKent was a retired chemist. He had, in his home, a chemical laboratory\nin which he was working upon some mysterious problem. His children did\nnot know what it was, nor, of course, did I. And none of us had ever\nbeen in the laboratory, except that when occasion offered we stole\nsurreptitious peeps.\n\nI recall Dr. Kent as a kindly, iron-gray haired gentleman. He was\nstern with the discipline of his children; but he loved them, and was\nindulgent in a thousand ways. They loved him; and I, an orphan, began\nlooking upon him almost as a father. I was interested in chemistry. He\nknew it, and did his best to help and encourage me in my studies.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere came an afternoon in the summer of 1956, when arriving at the\nKent house, I ran upon a startling scene. The only other member of the\nhousehold was a young fellow of twenty-five, named Franz Polter. He\nwas a foreigner, born, I understood, in one of the Balkan\nProtectorates; and he was here, employed by Dr. Kent as laboratory\nassistant. He had been with the Kents, at this time, two years. Alan\nand Babs did not like him, nor did I. He must have been a clever,\nskilful chemist. No doubt he was. But in aspect he was, to us,\nrepulsive. A hunchback, with a short thick body; dangling arms that\nsuggested a gorilla; barrel chest; a lump set askew on his left\nshoulder, and his massive head planted down with almost no neck. His\nface was rugged in feature; a wide mouth, a high-bridged heavy nose;\nand above the face a great shock of wavy black hair. It was an\nintelligent face; in itself, not repulsive.\n\nBut I think we all three feared Franz Polter. There was always\nsomething sinister about him, quite apart from his deformity.\n\nI came, that afternoon, upon Babs and Polter under a tree on the Kent\nlawn. Babs, at fourteen with her long black braids down her back,\nbare-legged and short-skirted in a summer sport costume, was standing\nagainst the tree with Polter facing her. They were about of a height.\nTo my youthful imaginative mind rose the fleeting picture of a young\ngirl in a forest menaced by a gorilla.\n\nI came upon them suddenly. I heard Polter say:\n\n\"But I lof you, And you are almos' a woman. Some day you lof me.\"\n\nHe put out his thick hand and gripped her shoulder. She tried to twist\naway. She was frightened, but she laughed.\n\n\"You--you're crazy!\"\n\nHe was suddenly holding her in his arms, and she was fighting him. I\ndashed forward. Babs was always a spunky sort of girl. In spite of her\nfear now, she kept on laughing, and she shouted:\n\n\"You--let me go, you--hunchback!\"\n\nHe did let her go; but in a frenzy of rage he hauled back his hand and\nstruck her in the face. I was upon him the next second. I had him down\non the lawn, punching him; but though at seventeen I was a reasonably\nhusky lad, the hunchback with his thick, hairy gorilla arms proved\nmuch stronger. He heaved me off. And then the commotion brought Alan.\nWithout waiting to find out what the trouble was, he jumped on Polter.\nBetween us, I think we would have beaten him pretty badly. But the\nhousekeeper summoned Dr. Kent and the fight was over.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPolter left for good within an hour. He did not speak to any of us.\nBut I saw him as he put his luggage into the taxi which Dr. Kent had\nsummoned. I was standing silently nearby with Babs and Alan. The look\nhe flung us as he drove away carried an unmistakable menace--the\npromise of vengeance. And I think now that in his warped and twisted\nmind he was telling himself that he would some day make Babs regret\nthat she had laughed at his love.\n\nWhat happened that night none of us ever knew. Dr. Kent worked late in\nhis laboratory; he was there when Alan and Babs and the housekeeper\nwent to bed. He had written a note to Alan; it was found on his desk\nin a corner of the laboratory next morning, addressed in care of the\nfamily lawyer to be given Alan in the event his father died. It said\nvery little. Described a tiny fragment of gold quartz rock the size\nof a walnut which would be found under the giant microscope in the\nlaboratory; and told Alan to give it to the American Scientific\nSociety to be guarded and watched very carefully.\n\nThis note was found, but Dr. Kent had vanished! There had been a\nmidnight marauder. The laboratory was on the lower floor of the house.\nThrough one of its open windows, so the police said, an intruder had\nentered. There was evidence of a struggle, but it must have been\nshort, and neither Babs, Alan, the housekeeper nor any of the\nneighbors heard anything amiss. And the fragment of golden quartz was\ngone!\n\nThe police investigation came to nothing. Polter was found in New\nYork. He withstood the police questions. There was nothing except\nsuspicion upon which he could be held, and he was finally released.\nImmediately, he disappeared.\n\nNeither Alan, Babs nor I saw Polter again. Dr. Kent had never been\nheard from to this day, four years later when I flew to join the twins\nin Quebec. And now Alan had told me that Polter was up there! We had\nnever ceased to believe that Dr. Kent was alive, and that Polter was\nthe midnight marauder. And as we grew older, we began to search for\nPolter. It seemed to us that now we were older, if we could once get\nour hands on him, we could drag from him the truth in which the police\nhad failed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe call of a traffic director in mid-Vermont brought me back from\nthese vivid thoughts. My buzzer was clanging; a peremptory\nhalting-signal day-beam came darting up at me from below. It caught me\nand clung: I shouted down at it.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" I gave my name and number and all the details in\na breath. Above everything I had no wish to be halted now. \"What's the\nmatter? I haven't done anything wrong.\"\n\n\"The hell you haven't,\" the director roared. \"Come down to three\nthousand. That lane's barred.\"\n\nI dove obediently and his beam followed me. \"Once more like that,\nyoung fellow--\" But he went busy with somebody else and I didn't hear\nthe end of his threat.\n\nI crossed into Maine in mid-afternoon. Twilight was upon me. The sky\nwas solid lead. The landscape all up through here was gray-white with\nsnow in the gathering darkness. I passed the city of Jackman, crossing\nfull over it to take no chances of annoying the border officials; and\na few miles further, I dropped to the glaring lights of the\nInternational Inspection Field. The formalities were soon finished. I\nwas ready to take-away when Alan rushed at me.\n\n\"George! I thought I could connect here.\" He gripped me. He was\nwild-eyed, incoherent. He waved his taxiplane away. \"I'm going back\nwith my friend. George. I can't--I don't know what's happened to her.\n_She's_ gone, now!\"\n\n\"Who's gone? Babs?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He pushed me into my plane and climbed in after me. \"Don't\ntalk. Get us up! I'll tell you then. I shouldn't have left.\"\n\nWhen we were up in the air, I swung on him. \"What are you talking\nabout? Babs gone?\"\n\nI could feel myself shuddering with a nameless horror.\n\n\"I don't know what I'm talking about, George. I'm about crazy. The\nQuebec police think I am, anyway. I been raising hell with them for an\nhour. Babs is gone. I can't find her. I don't know where she is.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe finally calmed down enough to tell me. Shortly after his radiophone\nto me in New York, he had missed Babs. They had had lunch in the huge\nhotel and then walked on the Dufferin Terrace--the famous promenade\noutside looking down over the lower city, the great sweep of the St.\nLawrence River and the gray-white distant Laurentian mountains.\n\n\"I was to meet her inside. I went in ahead of her. But she didn't\ncome. I went back to the terrace and she was gone. Wasn't in our\nrooms. Nor the lobby--nor anywhere.\"\n\nBut it was early afternoon, in the public place of a civilized city.\nIn the daylight of the Dufferin Terrace, beside the long ice toboggan\nslide, under the gaze of skaters on the ice-rink and several hundred\nholiday merrymakers, a young girl could hardly be murdered, or\nforcibly abducted, without attracting some attention! The Quebec\npolice thought the young American unduly excited over his sister, who\nwas missing only an hour. They would do what they could, if by dark\nshe had not rejoined him. They suggested that doubtless the young lady\nhad gone shopping.\n\n\"Maybe she did,\" I agreed. But in my heart, I felt differently.\n\"She'll be waiting for us in the hotel when we get there, Alan.\"\n\n\"But I'm telling you we saw Polter this morning. He lives here--not\nthirty miles from Quebec. We saw him on the terrace after breakfast.\nRecognized him at once.\"\n\n\"Did he see you?\"\n\n\"I don't know. He was lost in the crowd in a minute. But I asked a\nyoung French fellow who it was. He knew him. Told me, Frank Raskor.\nThat's the name he wears now. He's a famous man up here--well known,\nimmensely rich. I don't know if he saw us or not. What a fool I was to\nleave Babs alone, even for a minute!\"\n\nWe were speeding over a white-clad valley with a little frozen river\nwinding down its middle. Almost full night had come. The leaden sky\nwas low above us. It began snowing. The lights of the small villages\nalong the river were barely visible.\n\n\"Can you land us, Alan?\"\n\n\"Yes, surely. Municipal field just beyond the Citadel. We can get to\nthe hotel in five minutes. Good landing lights.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a flight of only half an hour. During it, Alan told me about\nPolter. The hunchback, known now as Frank Rascor, owned a mine in the\nLaurentides, some thirty miles from Quebec City--a fabulously\nproductive mine of gold. It was an anomaly that gold should be\nproduced in this region. No vein of gold-bearing rock had been found,\nexcept the one on Polter's property. Alan had seen a newspaper account\nof the strangeness of it; and just upon the chance had come to Quebec,\nseen Frank Rascor on the Dufferin Terrace, and recognized him as\nPolter.\n\nAgain my thoughts went back into the past. Had Polter stolen that\nmissing fragment of golden quartz the size of a walnut which had been\nbeneath Dr. Kent's microscope? We always thought so. Dr. Kent had some\nsecret, some great problem upon which he was working. Polter, his\nassistant, had evidently known, or partially known, its details. And\nnow, four years later, Polter was immensely rich, with a \"gold mine\"\nin mountains where there was no other such evidence of gold!\n\nI seemed to see some connection. Alan, I knew, was groping with a dim\nidea, so strange he hardly dared voice it.\n\n\"I tell you, it's weird, George. The sight of him. Polter--heavens,\none couldn't mistake that hunchback--and his face, his features, just\nthe same as when we knew him.\"\n\n\"Then what's weird?? I demanded.\n\n\"His age.\" There was a queer solemn hush in Alan's voice. \"George,\nwhen we knew Polter, he was about twenty-five, wasn't he? Well, that\nwas four years ago. But he isn't twenty-nine now! I swear it's the\nsame man--but he isn't around thirty. Don't ask me what I'm talking\nabout. I don't know. But he isn't thirty. He's nearer fifty!\nUnnatural! Weird! I felt it, and so did Babs, just that brief look we\nhad at him.\"\n\nI did not answer. My attention was on managing the plane. The lights\nof Sevis were under us. Beyond the city cliffs the St. Lawrence lay\nin its deep valley; and the Quebec lights, the light-dotted ramparts\nwith the terrace and the great fortress-like hotel showed across the\nriver.\n\n\"Better take the stick, Alan. I don't know where the field is. And\ndon't you worry about Babs. She'll be back by now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut she was not. We went to the two connecting rooms in the tower of\nthe hotel which Alan and Babs had engaged. We inquired with half a\ndozen phone-calls. No one had seen or heard from her. The Quebec\npolice were sending a man up to talk to Alan.\n\n\"Well, we won't be here,\" Alan called to me. He was standing by the\nwindow in Bab's room; he was trembling too much to use the phone. I\nhung up the receiver and went through the connecting door to join him.\n\nBab's room! It sent a pang through me. A few of her garments were\nlying around. A negligee was laid out on the dainty little bed. A\nvelvet boudoir doll--she had always loved them--stood on the dresser.\nUpon this hotel room, in a day, she had impressed her personality. Her\nperfume was in the air. And now she was gone.\n\n\"We won't be here,\" Alan was repeating. He gripped me at the window.\n\"Look!\" In his hand was an ugly-looking, smokeless, soundless\nautomatic of the Essen type. \"And I've got another, for you. Brought\nthem up with me.\"\n\nHis face was white and drawn, but his hands abruptly were steady. The\ntremble was gone out of his voice.\n\n\"I'm going after him. George! Now! Understand that? Now! His place is\nonly thirty miles from here, out there in the mountains. You can see\nit in the daylight--a wall around his property and a stone castle\nwhich he built in the middle of it. A gold mine? Hell!\"\n\nThere was nothing to be seen now out of the window but the\nsnow-filled darkness, the blurred lights of lower Quebec and the line\nof dock-lights five hundred feet under us.\n\n\"Will you fly me, George?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nI was the one trembling now; the cool feel of the automatic which Alan\nthrust into my hand seemed suddenly to crystallize Bab's danger. I was\nhere in her room, with the scent of her perfume around it, and this\ndeadly weapon was needed! But the trembling was gone in a moment.\n\n\"Yes. Of course, Alan. No use talking to the police. You can't get a\nsearch warrant to ransack the castle of a rich man just because you\ncan't find your sister. Come on. You can tell me what his place is\nlike as we go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBundled in our flying suits we hurried from the hotel, climbed the\nCitadel slope of the landing field, and in ten minutes were again in\nthe air. The wind sucked at us. The snow now was falling with thick\nhuge flakes. Directed by Alan, I headed out over the ice-filled St.\nLawrence, past the frozen Isle d'Orleans, toward Polter's mysterious\nmountain castle.\n\nSuddenly Alan burst out, \"I know what father's secret was, George! I\ncan piece it together now, from little things that were meaningless\nwhen I was a kid. He invented the electro-microscope. You know that.\nThe infinitely small fascinated him. I remember he once said that if\nwe could see far enough down into smallness, we would come upon human\nlife!\"\n\nAlan's low tense voice was more vehement than I had ever heard it\nbefore. \"It's clear to me now, George. That little fragment of golden\nquartz which he wanted me to be so careful of contained a world with\nhuman inhabitants! Father knew it, or suspected it. And I think the\nchemical problem on which he was working aimed for some drug. I know\nit was a drug they were compounding. Polter said so once, a\nradio-active drug; I remember listening at the door. A drug, George,\ncapable of making a human being infinitely small!\"\n\nI did not answer when momentarily Alan paused. So strange a thing! My\nmind whirled with it; struggled to encompass it. And like the\nmeaningless pieces of a puzzle, dropping so easily into place when the\nkey-piece is fitted. I saw Polter stealing that fragment of gold;\nabducting Dr. Kent--perhaps because Polter himself was not fully\nacquainted with the secret. And now, Polter, up here with a fabulously\nrich \"gold mine.\" And Babs, abducted by him, to be taken--where?\n\nIt set me shuddering.\n\n\"Alan!\"\n\n\"That's what it was!\" Alan reiterated. \"And Polter, here now with what\nhe calls a 'mine.' It isn't a mine, it's a laboratory! He's got\nfather, too, hidden God knows where! And now Babs. We've got to get\nthem. George! The police can't help us! It's just you and me, to fight\nthis thing. And it's diabolical!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_The Girl an Inch Tall_\n\nWe soared over the divided channel of the St. Lawrence, between\nOrleans and the mainland. Montmorency Falls in a moment showed dimly\nwhite through the murk to our left, a great hanging veil of ice higher\nthan Niagara. Further ahead, the lights of the little village of St.\nAnne de Beaupr\u00e9 were visible with the gray-black, towering hills\nbehind them. Historic region! But Alan and I had no thoughts for it.\n\n\"Swing left, George. Over the mainland. That's St. Anne; we pass this\nside of it. Put the mufflers on. This damn thing roars like a tower\nsiren.\"\n\nI cut in the mufflers, and switched off our wing-lights. It was\nillegal, but we were past all thought of that. We were both desperate;\nthe slow prudent process of acting within the law had nothing to do\nwith this affair. We both knew it.\n\nOur little plane was dark, and amid the sounds of this night blizzard\nour muffled engine could not be heard.\n\nAlan touched me. \"There are his lights; see them?\"\n\nWe had passed St. Anne. The hills lay ahead--wild mountainous country\nstretching northward to the foot of Hudson Bay. The blizzard was\nroaring out of the north and we were heading into it. I saw, on what\nseemed a dome-like hill perhaps a thousand feet above the river level,\na small cluster of lights which marked Polter's property.\n\n\"Fly over it once, George. Low--we can chance it. And find a place to\nland outside the walls.\"\n\nWe presently had it under us. I held us at five hundred feet, and cut\nour speed to the minimum of twenty miles an hour facing the gale,\nthough it was sixty or seventy when we turned. There were a score or\ntwo of hooded ground lights. But there was little reflection aloft,\nand in the murk of the snowfall I felt we would escape notice.\n\nWe crossed, turned and went back in an arc following Polter's outer\ncurved wall. We had a good view of it. A weird enough looking place,\nhere on its lonely hilltop. No wonder the wealthy \"Frank Rascor\" had\nattained local prominence!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe whole property was irregularly circular, perhaps a mile in\ndiameter covering the almost flat dome of the hilltop. Around it,\ncompletely enclosing it, Polter had built a stone and brick wall. A\nminiature wall of China! We could see that it was fully thirty feet\nhigh with what evidently were naked high-voltage wires protecting its\ntop. There were half a dozen little gates, securely barred, with\ndoubtless a guard at each of them.\n\nWithin the wall there were several buildings: a few small stone houses\nsuggesting workmen's dwellings; an oblong stone structure with smoke\nfunnels which seemed perhaps a smelter; a huge, dome-like spread of\ntranslucent glass over what might have been the top of a mine-shaft.\nIt looked more like the dome of an observatory--an inverted bowl fully\na hundred feet wide and equally as high, set upon the ground. What did\nit cover?\n\nAnd, there was Polter's residence--a castle-like brick and stone\nbuilding with a central tower not unlike a miniature of the Chateau\nFrontenac. We saw a stone corridor on the ground connecting the lower\nfloor of the castle with the dome, which lay about a hundred feet to\none side.\n\nCould we chance landing inside the wall? There was a dark, level\nexpanse of snow where we could have done it, but our descending plane\nwould doubtless have been discovered. But the mile-wide inner area was\ndark in many places. Spots of light were at the little wall-gates.\nThere was a glow all along the top of the wall. Lights were in\nPolter's house; they slanted out in yellow shafts to the nearby white\nground. But for the rest, the whole place was dark, save a dim glow\nfrom under the dome.\n\nI shook my head at Alan's suggestion. \"We couldn't land inside.\" We\nhad circled back and were a mile or so off toward the river. \"You saw\nguards down there. But that low stretch outside the gate on this\nside--\"\n\nA plan was coming to me. Heaven knows it was desperate enough, but we\nhad no alternative. We would land and accost one of the gate guards.\nForce our way in. Once inside the wall, on foot in the darkness of\nthis blizzard, we could hide; creep up to that dome. Beyond that my\nimagination could not go.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe landed in the snow a quarter of a mile from one of the gates. We\nleft the plane and plunged into the darkness. It was a steady upward\nslope. A packed snowfield was under foot, firm enough to hold our\nshoes, with a foot or so of loose soft snow on its top. The falling\nflakes whirled around us. The darkness was solid, Our helmeted\nleather-furred flying suits were soon shapeless with a gathering white\nshroud. We carried our Essens in our gloved hands. The night was cold,\naround zero I imagine, though with that biting wind it felt far\ncolder.\n\nFrom the gloom a tiny spot of light loomed up.\n\n\"There it is, Alan. Easy now! Let me go first.\" The wind tore away my\nwords. We could see the narrow rectangle of bars at the gate, with a\nglow of light behind them.\n\n\"Hide your gun, Alan.\" I gripped him. \"Hear me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Let me go first. I'll do the talking. When he opens the gate, let me\nhandle him. You--if there are two of them--you take the other.\"\n\nWe emerged from the darkness, into the glow of light by the gate. I\nhad the horrible feeling that a shot would greet us. A challenge came,\nat first in French, then in English.\n\n\"Stop! What do you want?\"\n\n\"To see Mr. Rascor.\"\n\nWe were up to the bars now, shapeless hooded bundles of snow and\nfrost. A man stood in the doorway of a lighted little cubby behind the\nbars. A black muzzle in his hand was leveled at us.\n\n\"He sees no one. Who are you?\"\n\nAlan was pressing at me from behind. I shoved back, and took a step\nforward. I touched the bars.\n\n\"My name is Fred Davis. Newspaper man from Montreal. I must see Mr.\nRascor.\"\n\n\"You cannot. You may send in your call. The mouthpiece is there--out\nthere to the left. Bare your face; he talks to no one without the face\nimage.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe guard had drawn back into his cubby; there was only this extended\nhand and the muzzle of his weapon left visible.\n\nI took a step forward. \"I don't want to talk by phone. Won't you open\nthe gate? It's cold out here. We have important business. We'll wait\nwith you.\"\n\nAbruptly the gate lattice slid aside. Beyond the cubby doorway was the\nopen darkness within the wall. A scuffed path leading inward from the\ngate showed for a few feet.\n\nI walked over the threshold, with Alan crowding me. The Essen in my\ncoat pocket was leveled. But from the cubby doorway, I saw that the\nguard was gone! Then I saw him crouching back of a metal shield. His\nvoice rang out.\n\n\"Stand!\"\n\nA light struck my face--a little beam from a television sender beside\nme. It all happened in an instant, so quickly Alan and I had barely\ntime to make a move. I realized my image was now doubtless being\npresented to Polter. He would recognize me!\n\nI ducked my head, yelling: \"Don't do that! You frighten me!\"\n\nIt was too late! The guard had received a signal. I was aware of its\nbuzz.\n\nFrom the shield a tiny jet of fluid leaped at me. It struck my hood.\nThere was a heavy, sickening-sweet smell. It seemed like chloroform. I\nfelt my senses going. The cubby room was turning dark; was roaring.\n\nI think I fired at the shield. And Alan leapt aside. I heard the faint\nhiss of his Essen. And his choked, horrified voice:\n\n\"George--come back! Run! Don't fall! Don't!\"\n\nI crumpled; slid into blackness. And it seemed, as I went down, that\nAlan's inert body was falling on top of me....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI recovered consciousness after a nameless interval, a phantasmagoria\nof wild, drugged dreams. My senses came slowly. At first, there were\ndim muffled voices and the tread of footsteps. Then I knew that I was\nlying on the ground, and that I was indoors. It was warm. My overcoat\nwas off. Then I realized that I was bound and gagged.\n\nI opened my eyes. Alan was lying inert beside me, roped and with a\nblack gag around his face and in his mouth. We were in a huge dim open\nspace. Presently, as my vision cleared, I saw that the dome was\noverhead. This was a circular, hundred-foot-wide room. It was dimly\nlighted. The figures of men were moving about, their great misshapen\nshadows shifting with them. Twenty feet from me there was a pile of\ngolden rock--chunks of gold the size of a man's fist, or his head, and\nlarger, heaped loosely into a mound ten feet high.\n\nBeyond this pile of ore, near the center of the room, twenty feet\nabove the concrete floor, there was a large hanging electrolier. It\ncast a circular glow downward. Under it I saw a low platform raised a\nfoot or two above the ground. A giant electro-microscope was hung with\nits twenty-foot cylinder above the platform. Its intensification tubes\nwere glowing in a dim phosphorescent row on a nearby bracket. A man\nsat in a chair on the platform at the microscope's eyepiece.\n\nI saw all this with a brief glance, then my attention went to a white\nstone slab under the giant lense. It rested on the platform floor, a\ntwo-foot-square surface of smooth white stone like marble. A little\nroped railing a few inches high fenced it. And in its center lay a\nfragment of golden quartz the size of a walnut!\n\nThere was a movement across my line of vision. Two figures advanced. I\nrecognized both of them. And I strained at my bonds; mouthed the gag\nwith futile, horrified effort. I could no more than writhe; and I\ncould not make a sound. I lay, after a moment exhausted, and stared\nwith horror.\n\nThe familiar hunched figure of Polter advanced toward the microscope.\nAnd with him, his huge hand holding her wrists, was Babs. They were\nnearly fifty feet from me, but with the light over them I could see\nthem clearly. Bab's slim figure was clad in a long skirted dress--pale\nblue, now, with the light on it. Her long black hair had fallen\ndisheveled to her shoulders. I could not see her face. She did not cry\nout. Polter was half dragging her as she resisted him; and then\nabruptly she ceased struggling.\n\nI heard his gutteral voice. \"That iss better.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey mounted to the platform. It seemed to me that they must have been\nfar away; they were very small. Abnormally small. I blinked. Horror\nsurged over me. Their figures were dwindling as they stood there!\nPolter was saying something to the man at the microscope. Other men\nwere nearby, watching. All normal, save Polter and Babs. A moment\npassed. Polter was standing by the chair in which the man at the\nmicroscope was sitting. And Polter's head barely reached its seat!\nBabs was clinging to him, now. Another moment. They were both little\nfigures down by the chair-leg. Then they began walking with swaying\nsteps toward the tiny railing of the white slab. The white reflection\nfrom the slab plainly illumined then. Polter's arm was around Babs. I\nhad not realized how small they were until I saw Polter lift the rope\nof the four-inch little fence, and he and Babs stooped and walked\nunder it. The fragment of quartz lay a foot from them in the center of\nthe white surface. They walked unsteadily toward it. But soon they\nwere running.\n\nMy horrified senses whirled. Then abruptly I felt something touch my\nface! Alan and I were lying in shadow. No one had noticed my writhing\nmovements, and Alan was still in drugged unconsciousness. Something\ntiny and light and soundless as a butterfly wing brushed my face! I\njerked my head aside. On the floor, within six inches of my eyes, I\nsaw the tiny figure of a girl an inch high! She stood, with a warning\ngesture to her lips--a human girl in a filmy flowing drapery. Long\npale golden tresses lay on her white shoulders; her face, small as my\nlittle fingernail, colorful as a miniature painted upon ivory, was so\nclose to my eyes that I could see her expression--warning me not to\nmove.\n\nThere was a faint glow of light on the floor where she stood, but in a\nmoment she moved out of it. Then I felt her brush against the back of\nmy head. My ear was near the ground. A tiny warm hand touched my\near-lobe; clung to it. A tiny voice sounded in my ear.\n\n\"Please do not move your head! You might kill me!\"\n\nThere was a pause. I held myself rigid. Then the tiny voice came\nagain.\n\n\"I am Glora, a friend. I have the drug! I will help you!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_The Fight in the Shrinking Dome Room_\n\nIt seemed that Alan was stirring. I felt the tiny hand leave my ear. I\nthought that I could hear faint little footfalls as the girl scampered\naway, fearful that a sudden movement from Alan would crush her. I\nturned cautiously after a moment and saw Alan's eyes upon me. He too\nhad seen, with a blurred returning consciousness, the dwindling\nfigures of Babs and Polter. I followed his gaze. The white slab with\nthe golden quartz under the microscope seemed empty of human movement.\nThe several men in this huge circular dome-room were dispersing to\ntheir affairs: three of them sat whispering by what I now saw was a\npile of gold ingots stacked crosswise. But the fellow at the\nmicroscope held his place, his eye glued to its aperture as he watched\nthe vanishing figures of Polter and Babs on the rock-fragment.\n\nAlan seemed trying to convey something to me, He could only gaze and\njerk his head. I saw behind his head the figure of the tiny girl on\nthe floor behind him. She wanted evidently to approach his head but\ndid not dare. When for an instant he was quiet, she ran forward, but\nat once scampered back.\n\nFrom the group by the ingots, one of the men rose and came toward us.\nAlan held still, watching. And the girl, Glora, seized the opportunity\nto come nearer. We both heard her tiny voice:\n\n\"Do not move! Close your eyes! Make him think you are still\nunconscious.\"\n\nThen she was gone, like a mouse hiding in the shadows near us.\n\nAmazement swept Alan's face; he twisted, mouthed at his gag. But he\nsaw my eager nod and took his cue from me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI closed my eyes and lay stiff, breathing slowly. Footsteps\napproached. A man bent over Alan and me.\n\n\"Are you no conscious yet?\" It was the voice of a foreigner, with a\nqueer, indescribable intonation. A foot prodded us. \"Wake up!\"\n\nThen the footsteps retreated, and when I dared to look the man was\nrejoining his fellows. It was a strange-looking trio. They were\nheavy-set men in leather jackets and short, wide knee-length trousers.\nOne wore tight, high boots, and the others a sort of white buskin,\nwith ankle straps. All were bareheaded--round, bullet heads of\nclose-dipped black hair.\n\nI suddenly had another startling realization. These men were not of\nnormal size as I had assumed! They were eight or ten feet tall at the\nvery least! And they and the pile of ingots, instead of being close to\nme, were more distant than I had thought.\n\nAlan was trying to signal me. The tiny girl was again at his ear,\nwhispering to him. And then she came to me.\n\n\"I have a knife. See?\" She backed away. I caught the pin-point gleam\nof what might have been a knife in her hand. \"I will get a little\nlarger. I am too small to cut your ropes. You lie still, even after I\nhave cut them.\"\n\nI nodded. The movement frightened her so that she leaped backward; but\nshe came again, smiling. The three men were talking earnestly by the\ningots. No one else was near us.\n\nGlora's tiny voice was louder, so that we both could hear it at once.\n\n\"When I free you, do not move or they may see that you are loose. I\nget larger now--a little larger--and return.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe darted away and vanished. Alan and I lay listening to the voices\nof the three men. Two were talking in a strange tongue. One called to\nthe man at the microscope, and he responded. The third man said\nsuddenly:\n\n\"Say, talk English. You know damn well I can't understand that lingo.\"\n\n\"We say, McGuire, the two prisoners soon wake up.\"\n\n\"What we oughta do is kill 'em. Polter's a fool.\"\n\n\"The doctor say, wait for him return. Not long--what you call three,\nfour hours.\"\n\n\"And have the Quebec police up here lookin' fer 'em? An' that damn\ngirl he stole off the terrace--What did he call her, Barbara Kent?\"\n\n\"These two who are drugged, their bodies can be thrown in a gully down\nbehind St. Anne. That what the doctor plan to do, I think. Then the\npolice find them--days maybe from now--and their smashed airship with\nthem.\"\n\nGruesome suggestion!\n\nThe man at the microscope called, \"They are gone. Almost. I can hardly\nsee them more.\" He left the platform and joined the others. And I saw\nthat he was much smaller than they--about my own size possibly.\n\nThere seemed six men here altogether. Four now, by the ingots, and two\nothers far across the room where I saw the dark entrance of the\ncorridor-tunnel which led to Polter's castle.\n\nAgain I felt a warning hand touch my face, and saw the figure of Glora\nstanding by my head. She was larger now--about a foot tall. She moved\npast my eyes; stood by my mouth; bent down over my gag. I felt the\ncautious side of a tiny knife-blade inserted under the fabric of the\ngag. She hacked, tugged at it, and in a moment ripped it through.\n\nShe stood panting from the effort. My heart was pounding with fear\nthat she would be seen; but the man had turned the central light off\nwhen he left the microscope, and it was far darker here now than\nbefore.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI moistened my dry mouth. My tongue was thick, but I could talk.\n\n\"Thank you, Glora.\"\n\n\"Quiet!\"\n\nI felt her hacking at the ropes around my wrists. And then at my\nankles. It took her a long time, but at last I was free! I rubbed my\narms and legs; felt the returning strength in them.\n\nAnd presently Alan was free. \"George, what--\" he began.\n\n\"Wait!\" I whispered. \"Easy! Let her tell us what to do.\"\n\nWe were unarmed. Two, against these six, three of whom were giants.\n\nGlora whispered, \"Do not move! I have the drugs. But I can no give\nthem to you when I am still so small. I have not enough. I will\nhide--there.\" Her little arm gestured to where, near us, half a dozen\nboxes were piled. \"When I am large as you, I come back. Be ready,\nquickly to act. I may be seen. I give you then the drug.\"\n\n\"But wait,\" Alan whispered. \"We must know--\"\n\n\"The drug to make you large. In a moment then you can fight these men.\nI had planned it for myself, to do that, and then I saw you held\ncaptive. That girl of your world the doctor just now steal, she is\nfriend of yours?\n\n\"Yes! Yes, Glora. But--\" A thousand questions were springing in my\nmind, but this was no time to ask them. I amended, \"Go! Hurry! Give us\nthe drug when you can.\"\n\nThe little figure moved away from us and disappeared. Alan and I lay\nas we had before. But now we could whisper. We tried to anticipate\nwhat would happen; tried to plan, but that was futile. The thing was\ntoo strange, too astoundingly fantastic.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHOW long Glora was gone I do not know. I think, not over three or four\nminutes. She came from her hiding place, crouching this time, and\njoined us. She was, probably, of normal Earth size--a small,\nfrail-looking girl something over five feet tall. We saw now that she\nwas about sixteen years old. We lay staring at her, amazed at her\nbeauty. Her small oval face was pale, with the flush of pink upon her\ncheeks--a face queerly, transcendently beautiful. It was wholly human,\nyet somehow unearthly, as though unmarked by even the heritage of our\nEarthly strifes.\n\n\"Now! I am ready.\" She was fumbling at her robe. \"I will give you each\nthe same.\"\n\nHer gestures were rapid. She flung a quick glance at the distant men.\nAlan and I were tense. We could easily be discovered now, but we had\nto chance it. We were sitting erect. He murmured:\n\n\"But what do we do? What happens? What--\"\n\nOn the palm of her hand were two small pink-white pellets. \"Take\nthese--one for each of you. Quickly!\"\n\nInvoluntarily we drew back. The thing abruptly was gruesome,\nfrightening. Horribly frightening.\n\n\"Quickly,\" she urged. \"The drug is what you call highly radio-active.\nAnd volatile. Exposed to the air it is gone very soon. You are afraid?\nNo! No, it will not harm you.\"\n\nWith a muttered curse at his own reluctance, Alan seized the pellet. I\nstopped him.\n\n\"Wait!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe men momentarily were engaged in a low-voiced, earnest discussion.\nI dared to hesitate a moment longer.\n\n\"Glora, where will you be?\"\n\n\"Here. Right here. I will hide.\"\n\n\"We want to go after Mr. Polter.\" I gestured. \"Into that little piece\nof golden rock. Is that where he went? Is that where he took the Earth\ngirl?\"\n\n\"Yes. My world is there--within an atom there in that rock.\"\n\n\"Will you take us?\"\n\n\"Yes! Yes!\"\n\nAlan whispered suddenly, \"Then let us go now. Get smaller, now.\"\n\nBut she shook her head vehemently. \"That is not possible. We would be\nseen as we climbed the platform and crossed the white slab.\"\n\n\"No.\" I protested. \"Not if we get very small, hiding here first.\"\n\nShe was smiling, but urgently fearful of this delay. \"Should we get\nthat small, then it would be, from here\"--she gestured toward the\nmicroscope--\"to there, a journey of very many miles. Don't you\nunderstand?\"\n\nThis thing so strange!\n\nAlan was plucking at me. \"Ready, George?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI put the pellet on my tongue. It tasted slightly sweet, but seemed\nquickly melted and I swallowed it hastily. My head swam. My heart was\npounding, but that was apprehension, not the drug. A thrill of heat\nran through my veins as though my blood were on fire.\n\nAlan was clinging to me as we sat together. Glora again had vanished.\nIn the background of my whirling consciousness the sudden thought\nhovered that she had tricked us; done to us something diabolical. But\nthe thought was swept away in the confusion of the flood of\nimpressions upon me.\n\nI turned dizzily. \"All right, Alan?\"\n\n\"Yes, I--I guess so.\"\n\nMy ears were roaring, the room seemed whirling, but in a moment that\npassed. I felt a sudden, growing sense of lightness. A humming was\nwithin me--a soundless tingle. To every tiny microscopic cell in my\nbody the drug had gone. The myriad pores of my skin seemed thrilling\nwith activity. I know now it was the exuding volatile gas of this\ndisintegrating drug. Like an aura it enveloped me, acted upon my\ngarments.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI learned later much of the principles of this and its companion drug.\nI had no thought for such things now. The huge dimly illumined room\nunder the dome was swaying. Then abruptly it steadied. The strange\nsensations within me were lessening, or I forgot them. And I became\naware of externals.\n\nThe room was shrinking! As I stared, not with horror now, but with\namazement and a coming triumph, I saw everywhere a slow, steady,\ncrawling movement. The whole place was dwindling. The platform, the\nmicroscope, were nearer than before, and smaller. The pile of ingots,\nwith the men off there, was shifting toward me.\n\n\"George! My God--weird!\"\n\nI saw Alan's white face as I turned to him. He was growing at the same\nrate as myself evidently, for of all the scene he only was unchanged.\n\nWe could feel the movement. The floor under us was shifting, crawling\nslowly. From all directions it came, contracting as though it were\nbeing squeezed beneath us. In reality our expanding bodies were\npushing outward.\n\nThe pile of boxes which had been a few feet away, were thrusting\nthemselves at me I moved incautiously and knocked them over. They\nseemed small now, perhaps half their former size. Glora was standing\nbehind them. I was sitting and she was standing, but across the\nlitter, our faces were level.\n\n\"Stand up!\" she murmured. \"You all right now. I hide!\"\n\nI struggled to my feet, drawing Alan up with me. Now! The time for\naction was upon us! We had already been discovered. The men were\nshouting, clambering to their feet. Alan and I stood swaying. The\ndome-room had contracted to half its former size. Near us was a little\nplatform, chair and microscope. Small figures of men were rushing at\nus.\n\nI shouted, \"Alan! Watch yourself!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were unarmed. These men might have automatics. But evidently they\ndid not. Knives were in their hands. The whole place was ringing with\nshouts. And then a shrill siren alarm from outside was clanging.\n\nThe first of the men--a few moments before he had seemed a\ngiant--flung himself upon me. His head was lower than my shoulders. I\nmet him with a blow of my fist in his face. He toppled backward; but\nfrom one side, another figure came at me. A knife-blade bit into the\nflesh of my thigh.\n\nThe pain seemed to fire my brain. A madness descended upon me. It was\nthe madness of abnormality. I saw Alan with two dwarfed figures\nclinging to him. But he threw them off, and they turned and ran.\n\nThe man at my thigh stabbed again, but I caught his wrist and, as\nthough he were a child, whirled him around me and flung him away. He\nlanded with a crash against the shrunken pile of gold nuggets and lay\nstill.\n\nThe place was in a turmoil. Other men were appearing from outside. But\nthey stood now well away from us. Alan backed against me. His laugh\nrang out, half hysterical with the madness upon him as it was upon me.\n\n\"God! George, look at them! So small!\"\n\nThey were now hardly the height of our knees. This was now a small,\ncircular room, under a lowering concave dome. A shot came from the\ngroup of pigmy figures. I saw the small stab of flame, heard the sing\nof the bullet.\n\nWe rushed, with the full frenzy of madness upon us, enraged giants.\nWhat actually happened I can not recount. I recall scattering the\nlittle figures; seizing them; flinging them headlong. A bullet, tiny\nnow, stung the calf of my leg. Little chairs and tables under my feet\nwere crashing. Alan was lunging back and forth; stamping; flinging his\ntiny adversaries away. There were twenty or thirty of the figures\nhere now. Then I saw some of them escaping.\n\nThe room was littered with wreckage. I saw that by some miracle of\nchance the microscope was still standing, and I had a moment of\nsanity.\n\n\"Alan, watch out! The microscope! The platform--don't smash it! And\nGlora! Look out for her!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI suddenly became aware that my head and a shoulder had struck the\ndome roof. Why, this was a tiny room! Alan and I found ourselves\nbacked together, panting in the small confines of a circular cubby\nwith an arching dome close over us. At our feet the platform with the\nmicroscope over it hardly reached our boot-tops. There was a sudden\nsilence, broken only by our heavy breathing. The tiny forms of humans\nstrewn around us were all motionless. The others had fled.\n\nThen we heard a small voice. \"Here! Take this! Quickly! You are too\nlarge! Quickly!\"\n\nAlan took a step. And then a sudden panic was on us both. Glora was\nhere at our feet. We did not dare turn; hardly dared move. To stoop\nmight have crushed her. My leg hit the top of the microscope cylinder.\nIt rocked but did not fall.\n\nWhere was Glora? In the gloom we could not see her. We were in a\npanic.\n\nAlan began, \"George, I say--\"\n\nThe contracting inner curve of the dome bumped gently against my head.\nThe panic of confusion which was upon us turned to fear. The room was\nclosing in to crush us.\n\nI muttered. \"Alan! I'm going out!\" I braced myself and heaved against\nthe side and top curve of the dome. Its metal ribs and heavy\ntranslucent, reinforced glass plates resisted me. There was an instant\nwhen Alan and I were desperately frightened. We were trapped, to be\ncrushed in here by our own horrible growth. Then the dome yielded\nunder our smashing blows. The ribs bent; the plates cracked.\n\nWe straightened, pushed upward and emerged through the broken dome,\nwith head and shoulders towering into the outside darkness and the\nwind and snow of the blizzard howling around us!\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_The Journey Into Smallness_\n\n\"Glora, that--that was horrible.\"\n\nWe stood, again in normal size, with the wrecked dome-laboratory\naround us. The dome had a great jagged hole halfway up one of its\nsides, through which the snow was falling. The broken bodies strewn\naround were gruesome.\n\nAlan repeated, \"Horrible, Glora. This drug, the power of it, is\ndiabolical.\"\n\nGlora had grown large after us; had given us the companion drug. I\nneed not detail the strange sensations of our dwindling. We were so\nsoon to experience them again!\n\nWe had searched, when still large, all of Polter's grounds. Some of\nhis men undoubtedly escaped, made off into the blizzard. How many, we\nnever knew. None of them ever made themselves known again.\n\nWe were ready to start into the atom. The fragment of golden quartz\nstill lay under the microscope on the white square of stone slab. We\nhad hurried with our last preparations. The room was chilling. We were\nall inadequately dressed for such cold.\n\nI left a note scribbled on a square of paper by the microscope. With\ndaylight, Polter's wrecked place would be discovered. The police would\ncome.\n\n\"Guard this piece of golden quartz. Take it at once, very carefully,\nto the Royal Canadian Scientific Society. Have it watched day and\nnight. We will return.\"\n\nI signed it George Randolph. And as I did so, the extraordinary aspect\nof these events swept me anew. Here in Polter's weird place I had\nseemed living in some strange fantastic realm. But this was the\nProvince of Quebec, in civilized Canada. These were the Quebec\nauthorities I was addressing.\n\nI flung the thoughts away. \"Ready, Glora?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen doubts assailed me. None of Polter's men had gotten large to\nfight us. Evidently he did not trust them with the drug. We could well\nbelieve that, for the thing, misused, was diabolical beyond human\nconception. A single giant, a criminal, a madman, by the power of\ngiant size alone, could devastate the earth! The drug, lost, or\ncarelessly handled, could get loose. Animals, insects, eating it,\ncould roam the earth, gigantic monsters! Vegetation, nourished with\nit, might in a day overrun a great city, burying it with a jungle\ngrowth!\n\nHow terrible a thing, if the realm of smallness were suddenly to\nemerge! Monsters of the sea, marine organisms, could expand until even\nthe ocean was too small for them. Microbes of disease, feeding upon\nthis drug--\n\nAlan was gripping me. \"We're ready, George.\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes, I'm ready.\"\n\nThis was not largeness we were facing now, but smallness. I thought of\nBabs, down there with Polter, beyond the vanishing point in the realm\nof the infinitely small. They had been gone an hour at least. Every\nmoment lost now was adding to Bab's danger.\n\n\"Yes. I'm ready, Alan.\"\n\nGlora sat with us on the platform. Strange little creature! She was\nwholly calm now; methodical with her last directions. There had been\nno time for her to tell us anything about herself. Alan had asked her\nwhy she had come here and how she had gotten the drugs. She waved him\naway:\n\n\"On the journey down. Plenty of time, then.\"\n\n\"How long?\" Alan demanded.\n\n\"Not too long. If we are careful with managing the trip, what you\nmight call ten hours.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd now as we were ready to start, she told us calmly:\n\n\"I will give you each your share of the drugs, but them you take only\nas I tell you.\"\n\nShe produced from her robe several small vials a few inches long. They\nwere tightly stoppered. The feel of them was cool and sleek; they\nseemed of some strange, polished metal. Some of them were tinted black\nwhile the others glowed opalescent. She gave each of us one vial of\neach kind.\n\n\"The light ones are for diminishing,\" she said. \"We take them very\ncarefully, one small pellet only at first.\"\n\nAlan was opening one of his, but she checked him.\n\n\"Wait! The drug evaporates very quickly. I have more to say, first. We\nsit here together. Then you follow me to the white slab. We climb upon\nthe little rock.\"\n\nShe laid her hands on our arms. Her blue eyes regarded us earnestly.\nHer manner was naive; childlike. But I could not mistake her\nintelligence; the force of character stamped on her face for all its\ndainty, ethereal beauty.\n\n\"Alan--\" She smiled at him, and tossed back a straying lock of her\nhair which was annoying her. \"You pay attention, Alan. You are very\nyoung, reckless. You listen. We must not be separated. You understand\nthat, both of you? We will be always in that little piece of rock. But\nthere will be miles of distance. And to be lost in size--\"\n\nStrange journey upon which now we were starting! Lost in size?\n\n\"You understand me? Lost in size. If that happens, we might never find\neach other. And if we come upon the Doctor Polter and the girl he\nholds captive--if we can overtake them--\"\n\n\"We must!\" I exclaimed. \"And we must start, Glora!\"\n\n\"Yes. Now!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe showed us which pellet to select. They were of several sizes, I\nfound. And as she afterward told us, the larger ones were not only\nlarger but of an intensified strength. We took the smallest. It was\nbarely a thousandth part of the strength of the largest. In unison we\nplaced the pellets on our tongues, and hastily swallowed.\n\nThe first sensations were as before. And, familiar now, they caused no\nmore than a fleeting discomfort. But I think I could never get used to\nthe outward strangeness!\n\nThe room in a moment was expanding. I could feel the platform floor\ncrawling outward beneath me, so that I had to hitch and change my\nposition as it pulled. We were seated together, Alan and I on each\nside of Glora. My fingers were on her arm. It did not change size, but\nit slowly drew away with a space opening between us. Overhead, the\ndome-roof, the great jagged hole there, was receding, lifting, moving\nupward and away.\n\nGlora pulled us to our feet. \"We had better start now. The distance is\nso far, so quickly.\"\n\nWe had been sitting within five feet of the stone slab with its little\nfour-inch-high railing around it. A chair was by the microscope\neyepiece. As we stood swaying I saw that the chair was huge, and its\nseat level with my head. The great barrel-cylinder of the microscope\nslanted sixty feet upward. The dome-roof was a distant spread three\nhundred feet up in the dimness. This gigantic room! It was a vast\narena now.\n\nAlan and I must have hesitated, confused by the expanding scene--a\nslow steady movement everywhere. Everything was drawing away from us.\nEven as we stood together, the creeping platform floor was separating\nus.\n\nA moment passed. Glora was urging vehemently:\n\n\"Come! You must not stand!\"\n\nWe started walking. The railing around the slab was knee-high. The\nslab itself was a broad square surface. The fragment of golden quartz\nlay in its center. It was now a jagged lump nearly a foot in\ndiameter!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe platform seemed shifting as we walked; the railing hardly came\ncloser as we advanced toward it. Then suddenly I realized it was\nreceding. Thirty feet away? No, now it was more than that--a great,\nthick rope, waist-high, with a huge spread of white surface behind it.\n\n\"Faster!\" urged Glora. We ran, and reached the railing. It was higher\nthan our heads. We ran under it, and out upon the white slab--a level\nsurface, larger now than the whole dome-room had been.\n\nGlora, like a fawn ran in advance of us, her draperies flying in the\nwind. She turned to look back.\n\n\"Faster! Faster--or it will be too hard a climb!\"\n\nAhead lay a golden mound of rock. It was widening; raising its top\nsteadily higher. Beyond it and over it was a vast dim distance. We\nreached the rock, breathless, winded. It was a jagged mound like a\ngreat fifty-foot butte. We plunged upon it, began climbing.\n\nThe ascent was steep; precipitous in places. There were little\ngullies, which expanded as we climbed up them. It seemed that we\nshould never reach the top, but at last we were there. I was aware\nthat the drug had ceased its action. The yellow rocky ground was no\nlonger expanding.\n\nWe came to the summit and stood to get back our breath. And Alan and I\ngazed with awe upon the top of a rocky hill. Little buttes and strewn\nboulders lay everywhere. It was all naked rock, ridged and pitted, and\neverywhere yellow-tinged.\n\nOverhead was distance. I could not call it a sky. A blur was\nthere--something almost but not quite distinguishable. Then I thought\nthat I could make out a more solid blur which might be the lower lens\nof the microscope above us. And there were blurred, very distant spots\nof light, like huge suns masked by a haze, and I knew that they were\nthe hooded lights of the laboratory room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore us, over the brink of a five hundred-foot cliff, a great\nglistening white plain stretched into the distance. I seemed to see\nwhere it ended in a murky blur. And far higher than our own hilltop\nlevel a horizontal streak marked the rope railing of the slab.\n\n\"Well,\" said Alan, \"we're here.\" He gazed behind us, back across the\nrocky summit which seemed several hundred feet across to its opposite\nbrink. He was smiling, but the smile faded. \"Now what, Glora? Another\npellet?\"\n\n\"No. Not yet. There is a place where we go down. It is marked in my\nmind.\"\n\nI had a sudden ominous sense that we three were not alone up here.\nGlora led us back from the cliff. As we picked our way among the naked\ncrags, it seemed behind each of them an enemy might be lurking.\n\n\"Glora, do you know if any of Dr. Polter's men have the drug? I mean,\ndo they come in and out here?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I think not. He lets no one have the drug. He\ntrusts not any one. I stole it; I will tell you later. Much I have to\ntell you before we arrive.\"\n\nAlan made a sudden sidewise leap, and dashed around a rock. He came\nback to us, smiling ruefully.\n\n\"Gets on your nerves, all this. I had the same idea you did, George.\nMight be someone around here. But I guess not.\" He took Glora's hand\nand they walked in advance of me. \"We haven't thanked you yet, Glora.\"\n\n\"Not needed. I came for help from your world. I could not get back to\nmy own, and I followed the Doctor Polter when he came outward. He has\nmade my world, my people, his slaves. I came for help. And because I\nhave helped you needs no thanks.\"\n\n\"But we do thank you, Glora.\" Alan turned his flushed, earnest face\nback to me. I thought I had never seen him so handsome, with his\nboyish, rugged features, and shock of tousled brown hair. The grimness\nof adventure was upon him, but in his eyes there was something else.\nIt was not for me to see it. That was for Glora; and I think that even\nthen its presence and its meaning did not escape her.\n\n\"Stay close, George.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe reached a little gully near the center of the hilltop. It was some\ntwenty feet deep. Glora paused.\n\n\"We descend here.\"\n\nThe gully was an unmistakable landmark--open at one end, forty feet\nlong, with the other end terminating in a blind wall, smoothly\nprecipitous. We retraced our steps, entered the gully at its open end,\nand walked its length. Glora paused by the wall which now loomed above\nus.\n\n\"A pit is here--a hole. I cannot tell just how large it will look when\nwe are in this size.\"\n\nWe found and stood over it--a foot-wide circular hole extending\ndownward. Alan abruptly knelt and shoved his hand and arm into it, but\nGlora sprang at him.\n\n\"Don't do that!\"\n\n\"Why not? Is this it? How deep is it?\"\n\nShe retorted sharply, \"The Doctor Polter is ahead of us. How far away\nin size, who knows? Do you want to crush him, and crush that young\ngirl with him?\"\n\nAlan's jaw dropped. \"Good Lord!\"\n\nWe stood with the little pit before us, and another of the pellets\nready.\n\n\"Now!\" said Glora.\n\nAgain we took the drug, a somewhat larger pellet this time. The\nfamiliar sensations began. Everywhere the rocks were creeping with a\nslow inexorable movement, the landscape expanding around us. The gully\nwalls drew back and upward. In a moment they were precipice\ncliff-walls and we were in a broad valley.\n\nWe had been standing close together. We had not moved except to shift\nour feet as the expanding ground drew them apart. I became aware that\nAlan and Glora were a distance from me. Glora called:\n\n\"Come, George! We go down, quickly now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe ran to the pit. It had expanded to a great round hole some six feet\nwide and equally as deep. Glora let herself down, peered anxiously\nbeneath her, and dropped. Alan and I followed. We jammed the pit; but\nas we stood there, the walls were receding and lifting.\n\nI had remarked Glora's downward glance, and shuddered. Suppose, in\nsome slightly smaller size, Babs had been here among these rocks!\n\nThe pit widened steadily. The movement was far swifter now. We stood\npresently in a great circular valley. It seemed fully a mile in\ndiameter, with huge encircling walls like a crater rim towering\nthousands of feet into the air. We ran along the base of one expanding\nwall, following Glora.\n\nI noticed now that overhead the turgid murk had turned into the blue\nof distance. A sky. It was faintly sky-blue, and there seemed a haze\nin it, almost as though clouds were forming. It had been cold when we\nstarted. The exertion had kept us fairly comfortable; but now I\nrealized that the air was far warmer. It was a different air, more\nhumid, and I thought the smell of moist earth was in it. Rocks and\nboulders were strewn here on the floor of this giant valley, and I saw\noccasional pools of water. There had been rain recently!\n\nThe realization came with a shock of surprise. This was a new world! A\nfaint, luminous twilight was around us. And then I noticed that the\nlight was not altogether coming from overhead. It seemed inherent to\nthe rocks themselves. They glowed very faintly luminous, as though\nphosphorescent.\n\nWe were now well embarked upon this strange journey. We spoke seldom.\nGlora was intent upon guiding us. She was trying to make the best\npossible speed. I realized that it was a case of judgment, as well as\nphysical haste. We had dropped into that six-foot pit. Had we waited a\nfew moments longer, the depth would have been a hundred feet, two\nhundred, a thousand! It would have involved hours of arduous\ndescent--if we had lingered until we were a trifle smaller!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe took other pellets. We traveled perhaps an hour more. There were\nmany instances of Glora's skill. We squeezed into a gully and waited\nuntil it widened; we leaped little expanding caverns; we slid down a\nsmooth yellowish slide of rock like a child's toboggan, and saw it\nbehind and over us, rising to become a great spreading ramp extending\nupward into the blue of the sky. Now, up there, little sailing white\nclouds were visible. And down where we stood it was deep twilight,\nqueerly silvery with the phosphorescence from the luminous rocks as\nthough some hidden moon were shining.\n\nStrange, new world! I suddenly envisaged the full strangeness of it.\nAround me were spreading miles of barren, naked landscape. I gazed off\nto where, across the rugged plateau we were traversing, there was a\nrange of hills. Behind and above them were mountains; serrated tiers,\nhigher and more distant. An infinite spread of landscape! And, as we\ndwindled, still other vast reaches opened before us. I gazed overhead.\nWas it--compared to my stature now--a thousand miles, perhaps even a\nmillion miles up to where we had been two or three hours ago? I think\nso.\n\nThen suddenly I caught the other viewpoint. This was all only an inch\nof golden quartz--if one were large enough to see it that way!\n\nAlan had been trying to memorize the main topographical features of\nour route. It was not as difficult as it seemed at first. We were\nalways far larger than normal to our environment. The main\ndistinguishing characteristics of the landscape were obvious--the\nblind gully, with the round pit, for instance, or the ramp-slide.\n\nWe had been traveling some three or four hours when Glora suggested a\nrest. We were at the side-wall of a broad canyon. The wall towered\nseveral hundred feet above us; but a few moments before we had jumped\ndown it with a single leap!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe drug we had last taken had ceased its action. We sat down to rest.\nIt was a wild, mountainous scene around us, deep with luminous gloom.\nWe could barely see across the canyon to its distant cliff-wall. The\nwall beside us had been smooth, but now it was broken and ridged.\nThere were ravines in it, and dark holes like cave-mouths. One was\nnear us. Alan gazed at it apprehensively.\n\n\"I say, Glora. I don't like sitting here.\"\n\nI had been telling her all we knew of Polter. She listened quietly,\nseldom interrupting me. Then she said:\n\n\"I understand. I tell you now about Polter as I have seen him.\"\n\nShe talked for five or ten minutes. I listened amazed, awed by what\nshe told.\n\nBut Alan suddenly interrupted her. \"I say, let's move away from here.\nThat tunnel-mouth, or cave, whatever it is--\"\n\n\"But we go in there,\" she protested. \"A little tunnel. That is our way\nto travel. We are not far from my city now.\"\n\nPerhaps Alan felt what a generation ago they called a hunch, a\npremonition, the presage of evil which I think comes strangely to us\nmore often than we realize. Whatever it was, we had no time to act\nupon it. The tunnel-mouth which had caused Alan's apprehension was\nabout a hundred feet away. It was a ten-foot, black yawning hole in\nthe cliff. Perhaps Alan sensed a movement off there. As I turned to\ngaze, from the opening came a great hairy human arm! Then a shoulder!\nA head!\n\nThe giant figure of a man came squeezing through the hole on his\nhands and knees! He gathered himself, and as he stood erect, I saw\nthat he was growing in size! Already he was twenty feet tall compared\nto us--a thick-set fellow, dressed in leather garments, his legs and\nbare arms heavily matted with black hair. He stood swaying, gazing\naround him. I stared up at his round bullet head, his villainous face.\n\nHe saw us! Stupid amazement struck him, then comprehension.\n\nHe let out a roar and came at us!\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_The Message from Polter_\n\nGlora shouted, \"Into the tunnel! This way!\" She held her wits and\ndarted to one side, with Alan and me after her. We ran through a\nnarrow passage between two fifty-foot boulders which lay close\ntogether. Momentarily the giant was out of sight, but we could hear\nhis heavy tread and his panting breath. We emerged; had passed him. He\nwas taller now. He seemed confused at our sudden scampering activity.\nHe checked his forward rush, and ran around the twin boulders. But we\nhad squeezed into a narrow ravine. He could not follow. He threw a\nrock: to us it was a boulder. It crashed behind us. To him, we were\nlike scampering insects; he could not tell which way we were about to\ndart.\n\nAlan panted, \"Glora, this--does this lead out?\"\n\nThe little ravine seemed to open fifty feet ahead of us. Alan stopped,\nseized a chunk of rock, flung it up. I saw the giant's face above us.\nHe was kneeling, trying to reach in. The rock hit him in the\nforehead--a pebble, but it stung him. His face rose away.\n\nAgain we emerged. The tunnel-mouth was near us. We reached it and\nflung ourselves into its ten-foot width just as the giant came lunging\nup. He was far larger than before. Looking back, I could see only the\nlower part of his legs blocked against the outer light.\n\n\"Glora! Alan, where are you?\"\n\nFor a moment I did not see them. It was darker in this tunnel; broken\nrocky walls, a jagged arching roof ten feet high. Then I heard Alan's\nvoice.\n\n\"George! Here!\"\n\nThey came running to me. For a moment we stood, undecided what to do.\nMy eyes were growing accustomed to the darkness; it was illumined by a\ndim phosphorescence from the rocks. I saw Alan fumbling for his vials,\nbut Glora stopped him.\n\n\"No! We are the right size.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were a hundred feet back from the opening. The giant's legs\ndisappeared. But in a moment the round light hole of the exit was\nobscured again. His head and shoulders! He was lying prone. His great\narms came in. He hitched forward. The width of his expanding shoulders\nwedged.\n\nI think that he expected to reach us with a single snatch of his\ntremendous arms. Or perhaps he was confused, and forgot his growth. He\ndid not reach us. His shoulders stuck. Then suddenly he was trying to\nback out, but could not!\n\nIt was only a moment. We stood in the radiant gloom of the tunnel,\nclinging to each other, ourselves stricken by confusion. The giant's\nvoice roared, reverberating around us. Anger. A note of fear. Finally\nstark terror. He heaved, but the rocks of the opening held solid. Then\nthere was a crack, a gruesome rattling, splintering--his shoulder\nbones breaking. His whole gigantic body gave a last convulsive lunge,\nand he emitted a deafening shrill scream of agony.\n\nI was aware of the tunnel-mouth breaking upward. Falling rocks--an\navalanche, a cataclysm around us. Then light overhead.\n\nThe giant's crushed body lay motionless. A pile of boulders, rocks and\nloose metallic earth was strewn upon his head and torso, illumined by\nthe outer light through a jagged rent where the cliff-face had fallen\ndown.\n\nWe were unhurt, crouching back from the avalanche. The giant's mangled\nbody was still expanding; shoving at the litter of loose rocks. In a\nmoment it would again be too large for the broken cliff opening.\n\nI found my wits. \"Alan! Out of here--God! Don't you see--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Glora held us. The drug the giant had taken was about at its end,\nand Glora recognized it. The growth presently stopped. That huge,\nnoisome mass of pulp which once had been human shoulders--\n\nI shoved Glora away. \"Don't look!\" I was shaking; my head was reeling.\nAlan's face, painted by the phosphorescence, was ghastly.\n\nGlora pulled at us. \"This way! The tunnel is not too long. We go.\"\n\nBut the giant had drugs. And perhaps weapons. \"Wait!\" I urged. \"You\ntwo wait here. I'll climb over him.\"\n\nI told them why, and ran. I can only leave to the imagination that\nbrief exploratory climb. The broken body seemed at least a hundred\nfeet long; the mangled shoulders and chest filled the great torn hole\nin the cliff. I climbed over the litter. Indescribable, horrible\nscene! A river of warm blood was flowing down the declivity\noutside....\n\nI came back to Glora and Alan. Under my arm was a huge cylinder vial.\nIt was black--the enlarging drug. I set it down. They stared at me in\nmy blood-stained garments.\n\n\"George! You're--\"\n\n\"His blood, not mine, Alan.\" I tried to smile. \"There's the drug he\ncarried. Evidently Polter was only sending him out. Just the one\ndrug.\"\n\n\"What'll we do with it?\" Alan demanded. \"Look at the size of it!\"\n\n\"Destroy it,\" said Glora. \"See, that is not difficult.\" She tugged at\nthe huge stopper, and exposed a few of the pellets--to us as large as\napples. \"The air will soon spoil it.\"\n\nWe left it in the tunnel. I had brought a great roll of paper; had\nfound it folded in the giant's belt, with the drug cylinder. We\nunrolled it, and hauled its folds to a spread some ten feet long. It\nwas covered with a scrawled handwriting in pencil, but its giant\ncharacters seemed thick blurred strokes of charcoal. We could not read\nit; we were too close. Alan and Glora held it up against the tunnel\nwall. From a distance I could make it out. It was a note written in\nEnglish, signed \"Polter,\" evidently to one of his men.\n\nI read it:\n\n\"The two men prisoners, kill them at once. That is better. It will be\ntoo dangerous to wait for my return. Put their bodies with their\nairplane. Crash it a mile or more from our gate.\"\n\nFull directions for our death followed. And Polter said he would\nreturn by dawn or soon after.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt gave me a start. By dawn! We had been traveling four or five hours.\nThe dawn was up there now!\n\n\"No,\" said Glora. She and Alan cast away the paper. \"No, the time in\nhere is different. A different time-rate. I do not know how much\ndifference. My world speeds faster; yours is very slow. It is not the\ndawn up there quite yet.\"\n\nAgain my mind strove to encompass these things so strange. A faster\ntime-rate prevailed in here? Then our lives were passing more quickly.\nWe were living, experiencing things, compressed into a shorter\ninterval. It was not apparent; there was nothing to which comparison\ncould be made. I recalled Alan's description of Polter--not thirty\nyears old as he should have been, but nearer fifty. I could understand\nthat, now. A day in here--while our gigantic world outside might only\nhave progressed a few hours.\n\nWe walked the length of the tunnel. I suppose it was a quarter of a\nmile, to us in this size. It wound through the cliff with a steady\ndownward slope. And suddenly I realized that we had turned downward\nnearly half the diameter of a circle! We had turned over--or at least\nit seemed so. But the gravity was the same. I had noticed from the\nbeginning very little change.\n\nThe realization of this turning brought a mental confusion. I lost all\nsense of direction. The outer world of Earth was under my feet,\ninstead of overhead. Then we went level. I forgot the confusion; this\nwas normality here. We turned upward a little. Cross tunnels\nintersected ours at intervals. I saw caverns, open, widened tunnels,\nas though this mountain were honeycombed.\n\n\"Look!\" said Glora. \"There is the way out. All these passages lead the\nsame way.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a glow of light ahead. I recall that I was at that moment\nfumbling at my belt in two small compartments of which I was carrying\nthe two vials of the drugs which Glora had given me. Alan wore the\nsame sort of belt. We had found them in the wrecked dome-room. I heard\na click on the ground at my feet. I was about to stoop to see what I\nhad kicked--only a loose stone, perhaps--but Glora's words distracted\nme. I did not stoop. If only I had, how different events might have\nbeen!\n\nThe glow of light ahead of us widened as we approached, and presently\nwe stood at the end of the tunnel. A spread of open distance was\noutside. We were on a ledge of a rocky, precipitous wall some fifty\nfeet above a wide level landscape. Vegetation! I saw trees--a forest\noff to the left. A range of naked hills lay behind it. A mile away, in\nfront and to the right, a little town nestled on the shore of shining\nwater. There was starlight on the water! And over it a vast\nblue-purple sky was studded with stars!\n\nI gazed, with that first sudden shock of emotion, into illimitable\ndepths of interplanetary space! Light years of distance. Gigantic\nworlds, blazing suns off there shrunken by distance now to little\npoints of light. A universe was here!\n\nBut this was an inch of golden quartz!\n\nAbove my head were stars which, compared to my bodily size now, were\nvast worlds ten thousand light-years away! Yet, from the other\nviewpoint, I had only descended perhaps an eighth or a quarter of an\ninch beneath the broken pitted surface of a little fragment of golden\nquartz the size of a walnut--into just one of its myriads of golden\natoms!\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n_The Girl in the Golden Cage_\n\n\"My world,\" Glora was saying. \"You like it? See the starlight on the\nlake? I have heard that your world looks like this at night, in\nsummer. Ours is always like this. No day, no night. Just like\nthis--starlight.\" Her hand went to Alan's shoulder. \"You like it? My\nworld?\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes, Glora, It's beautiful.\"\n\nThere seemed a sheen on everything, a soft, glowing sheen of\nphosphorescence from the rocks rising to meet the pale wan starlight.\nThe night air was soft, with a gentle breeze that rippled the distant\nlake into a great spread of gold and silver light.\n\nThe city was called Orena. I saw at once that we were about normal\nsize to its houses and people. There were fields beneath our ledge,\nwith farm implements lying in them; no workers, for this was the time\nfor sleep. Ribbons of roads wound over the country, pale streamers in\nthe starlight.\n\nGlora gestured. \"The giants are on their island. Everyone sleeps now.\nYou see the island off there?\"\n\nBeyond the city, over the low stone roofs of its flat-topped\ndwellings, the silver spread of lake showed a green-clad island some\nthree miles off shore. The distance made its white stone houses seem\nsmall. But as I gazed, I realized that they were large to their\nenvironment, all far larger than those of the little town. The island\nwas perhaps a mile in length. Between it and the mainland a boat was\ncoming toward us. It was a dark blob of hull on the shining water, and\nabove it a queerly shaped circular sail was puffed out like a\nballoon-parachute by the wind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The giants live, there?\" said Alan.\n\n\"You mean Polter's men?\"\n\n\"And women. Yes.\"\n\n\"Are there many giants?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"How many?\" I put in. \"How large are they? In relation to us now, I\nmean. And to your normal size?\"\n\nI turned to Alan. \"Polter and Babs must be down there now! They must\nhave arrived only recently. But we must determine what size to be\nbefore we go any further. We can't be gigantic If he sees us--if we\nassailed him--well, he'd kill Babs. We're got to plan. Glora tell\nus--\"\n\n\"You ask so many questions so fast, George. There are two hundred or\nmore of the giants. And there are more than that many thousands of our\npeople here. Slaves, because the giants are four times as large. This\nlittle city, these fields, these hills of stone and metal, all this\nwas ours to have in peace and happiness--until your Polter came. And\nthat starlight on the water--\"\n\nShe gestured. \"Everywhere is a great reach of desert and forests.\nInsects, but there are no wild beasts--nothing to harm us. Nature is\nkind here. The weather is always like this. We were happy--until\nPolter came.\"\n\n\"And only a few thousand people,\" Alan said. \"No other cities?\"\n\n\"What lies off in the great distance we do not know. Our nation is ten\ntimes what is here. A few other cities, though some of our people live\nin the forests--\"\n\nShe broke off. \"That boat is coming for Polter. He is in the city, no\ndoubt of that. The boat will take him and that girl you call Babs to\nthe giant's island. His castle is there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIf we could get on that boat and go with him to the island--! But in\nwhat size? Very small? But then, if we were very small it would take\nus hours to get from here to the boat. Glora pointed out where it\nwould land--just beyond the village where the houses were set in a\nsparse fringe. It would be there, apparently, in ten or fifteen\nminutes. Polter was probably there now with Babs, waiting for it.\n\nIn our present size we could not get there in time. It was two or\nthree miles at least. But a trifle larger--the size of one of Polter's\ngiants--would enable us to make it. We would be seen, but in the pale\nstarlight, keeping away from the city as much as possible, we might\nonly be mistaken for Polter's people. And when we got closer we would\ndiminish our size, creep into the boat, get near Babs and Polter and\nthen plan what to do.\n\nFutile plans! All of life is so futile, so wind-swept upon the tossing\nsea of chance!\n\nWe climbed down from the ledge and stood at the base of the towering\ncliff which reared its jagged wall against the stars. A field and a\nroad were near us. The road seemed of normal size. A man was across\nthe field. He did not seem to notice us. He was apparently about my\nheight. He presently discarded his work, went away from us and\nvanished.\n\n\"Hurry, Glora.\" Alan and I stood beside her while she took pellets\nfrom her vials. It needed a careful adjustment. We wanted our stature\nnow to be four times what it was. Glora gave us pellets of both drugs,\none of which was slightly more intense than the other.\n\n\"Polter made them this way,\" she said. \"The two at once gives just the\ngrowth to take us from this normal size to the stature of the giants.\"\n\nAlan and I did not touch our own vials. We had used none of our\nenlarging drug upon the journey; the supply she had given us of the\nother was nearly gone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs I took these pellets which Glora now gave us, standing there by the\nside of that road, I recall that I was struck with the realization\nthat never once upon this journey had I conceived myself to be other\nthan normal stature. I am normally about six feet tall. I still\nfelt--there in that golden atom--the same height. This landscape\nseemed of normal size. There were trees nearby--spreading, fantastic\nlooking growths with great strings of pods hanging from them. But\nstill, as I looked up to see one arching over me with its blue-brown\nleaves and an air-vine carrying vivid yellow blossoms--whatever the\nsize of the tree, my consciousness could only conceive myself as of a\nnormal six-foot stature standing beneath it. The human ego always is\nsupreme! Around each man's consciousness of himself the entire\nuniverse revolves!\n\nWe crouched on the ground when this growth now began; it would not do\nto be observed changing size. Polter's giants never did that. Years\nbefore, he had made them large--his few hundred men and women. They\nwere, Glora said, people both of this realm and from our great world\nabove--dissolute, criminal characters who now had set themselves up\nhere as the nucleus of a ruling race.\n\nIn a moment now, we were the size of these giants. Twenty to\ntwenty-five feet tall, in relation to this environment. But I did not\nfeel so. As I stood up--still myself in normal stature--I saw around\nme a shrunken little landscape. The trees, as though in a Japanese\ngarden, were about my own height; the road was a smooth level path:\nthe little field near us a toy fence around it. In another road across\nit, the man was walking. In height he would barely have reached my\nknees. He saw us rise beside the trees. He darted off his road in\nalarm, and disappeared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI have taken longer to tell all this than the actual time which\npassed. We could see the boat coming from the island, and it was still\na fair distance off shore. We ran along the road, skirting the edge of\nthe little town. Its houses were none of them taller than ourselves.\nThe windows and doorways were ovals into which we could only have\ninserted a head or an arm. They were most of them dark. Little people\noccasionally stared out, saw us run past, and ducked back, thankful\nthat we did not stop to harass them.\n\n\"This way,\" said Glora. She ran like a fawn, hardly winded, with Alan\nand me heavily panting behind her. \"There are trees--thick\ntrees--quite near where the boat lands. We can get in them and hide\nand change our size to smallness. But hurry, for we will need so much\ntime when we are small!\"\n\nThe little spread of town and the shining lake remained always to our\nright. In five minutes we were past most of the houses. A patch of\nwoods, with thick interlacing treetops about our own height, lay\nahead. It extended a few hundred feet over to the lake shore. The\nsailboat was heading in close. There was a broad, starlit roadway at\nthe edge of the lake, and a dock there at which the boat was preparing\nto land.\n\nWould we be in time? I suddenly feared not. To get small now, with\ndistance lengthening between us and the boat, would be disastrous. And\nwhere was Polter?\n\nAbruptly we saw him. There had been only little people visible to us;\nnone of our own height. The lake roadway by the dock was brightly\nstarlit. As we approached the intervening patch of woods it seemed\nthat a crowd of little people were near the dock. Polter must have\nbeen sitting. But now he rose up. We could not mistake his hunched\nthick figure, the lump on his shoulders clear in the starlight with\nthe gleaming lake as a background. The crowd of little figures were\nmilling around his knees. In the silence of the night the murmur of\ntheir voices floated over to us.\n\n\"There he is!\" Alan gasped. We all three checked our running; we were\nat the edge of the patch of woods. \"By God, there he is! Let's get\nlarger! Rush him! Why that's only a few hundred feet over there!\"\n\nBut Babs? Where was Babs?\n\n\"Alan! Down!\" I crouched, pulling Alan and Glora with me. \"Don't let\nhim see us! He'd know at once--and where is Babs? Can't rush him,\nAlan. He'd see us coming--kill her--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOf all the strange events which had been flung at us, I think this\nsudden crisis now most confused Alan and me. To get larger, or\nsmaller? Which? Yet something must be done at once.\n\nGlora said, \"We can get through the woods best in this size. And not\nbe seen--get closer to the landing.\"\n\nWe crouched so that the little treetops were always well over us. The\npatch of woods was dark. A soil of black loam was under us, a thick\nsoft underbrush reached our knees, and lacy, flexible leaves and\nbranches were at our shoulder height. We pushed them aside, forcing\nour way softly forward. It was not far. The little murmuring voices of\nthe crowd grew louder.\n\nPresently we were crouching at the other edge of the woods. I softly\nshoved the tree branches aside until we could all three get a clear\nview of the strange scene now directly before us.\n\nAnd I saw a toy dock, at which a twenty-foot, barge-like open sailboat\nwas landing; a narrow starlit roadway, crowded with a milling throng\nof people all no more than a foot and a half in height. The crowd\nmilled almost to where we were crouching, unseen in the shrubbery.\n\nAcross the road by the dock. Polter stood with the crowd down around\nhis knees. In height he seemed the old familiar Polter. Bareheaded,\nwith his shaggy black hair shot with white. He was dressed in Earth\nfashion: narrow black evening trousers and a white shirt and collar\nwith flowing black tie. I saw at once what Alan had noticed--the\nchange in him. An abnormality of age. I would have called him now\nforty, or older. Beyond even that there was an abnormality. A man old\nbefore his time; or younger than he should have been for the years he\nhad lived. An indescribable mingling of something. The mingling, of\nthe two worlds, perhaps. It marked him with a look at once unnatural\nand sinister.\n\nThese were instant impressions. Glora was plucking at me. \"On the\nwhite chest of his shirt, something is there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPolter was coatless, with snowy white shirt and cuffs to his thick\nwrists. He was no more than fifty feet from us. On his shirt bosom\nsomething golden in color was hanging like a large bauble, an\nornament, an insignia. It was strapped tightly there with a band about\nhis chest, a cord like a necklace chain up to his thick hunched neck,\nand other chains down to his belt.\n\nI stared at it. An ornament, like a cube held flat against his\nshirt-front--a little golden cube, ornate with tiny bars.\n\nI heard Alan murmuring, \"A cage! Why George, it's--\"\n\nAnd then, simultaneously, realization struck me. It was a golden cage\nstrapped there. And I seemed to see that there was something in it. A\ntiny figure? Babs!\n\n\"I think he has her there,\" Glora murmured. \"You see the little box\nwith bars? The girl Babs, a prisoner in there.\" She spoke swiftly,\nvehemently. \"He will take the boat to the island.\"\n\nShe suddenly gripped us. \"You think really it best to go? I do what\nyou say. I had the wish to get to my father with these drugs.\"\n\n\"No!\" exclaimed Alan. \"We must keep close to Polter!\"\n\nWe were ready with our pellets. But a sudden activity in the road made\nus pause. The crowd of little people were hostile to Polter. A sullen\nhostility. They milled about him as he stood there, gazing down at\nthen sardonically.\n\nAnd abruptly he shouted at them in English. \"You speak my language,\nsome of you. Then listen.\"\n\nThe crowd fell silent.\n\n\"Listen. This iss your future Queen. Can you see her? She iss small\nnow. But she has the magic power. Soon, she will be large. Like me.\"\n\nThe crowd was shouting again. It surged forward, but it lacked a\nleader, and those in advance shoved backward in fear.\n\nPolter spoke again. \"This girl from my world, you will like her. She\niss kind and very beautiful. When she iss large, you will see how\nbeautiful.\"\n\nA little stone suddenly came up from the throng of little people and\nstruck Polter on the shoulder. Then another. The crowd, emboldened,\nmade a rush; surged against his legs.\n\nHe shouted, \"You do that? Why how dare you? I show to you what giants\ndo when you make dem angry!\"\n\nFrom down by his knees he plucked the small figure of a man. The crowd\nscattered with shouts of terror. Polter had the struggling\neighteen-inch figure by the wrist. He whirled it around his head like\na nine-pin and flung it over the canopy of the dock far out into the\nshimmering lake!\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_Within the Golden Cage_\n\nThe trees around us expanded to towering forest giants. The underbrush\nrose up over our heads. We had taken only a taste of the diminishing\ndrug; Glora showed us how to touch it to our tongue several times, to\nadjust our size as we became smaller. It was no more than a minute of\ndiminishing. We could hear the roar of the crowd, and Polter's voice\nshouting. We ran forward through the great forest. It was a fair\ndistance out to the starlit road. We saw it as a wide shining\nesplanade. The people now were giants twice our height! Polter,\nhimself towering with a seeming fifty foot stature, was standing by\nthe gigantic canopy of the dock. He had dispersed the crowd. There was\nan open space on the esplanade--a run for us of about a hundred feet.\n\n\"We've got to chance it!\" I murmured. \"Make a run of it--now.\"\n\nWe darted across. In the confusion, with all eyes centered on Polter,\nwe escaped discovery. It was dim under the dock canopy. Polter had\nbacked from the road and was walking to the barge. It lay like the\nlength of an ocean liner, its sail looming an enormous spread above\nit. The gunwale was level with the dock-floor. A dozen or more\nfifty-foot men were greeting Polter. They were amidships.\n\nI realize now that in those moments as we scurried aboard like wharf\nrats, we took wild chances. We made for the stern which momentarily\nwas unoccupied. To Polter and his men we were eight or nine inches\ntall. We dropped over the gunwale, slid down the convex thirty or\nforty-foot incline of the interior and landed on the bottom of the\nboat.\n\nThere were many places where we could safely hide. A litter of\ngigantic rope-strands was around us. We could see the bottom of a\ncross-bench looming overhead, and the great curving sides of the\nvessel with the gunwales outlined against the starlight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe boat left the dock in a moment; the sail bellied out enormous over\nus. Ten feet forward from us the towering figure of a man sat on a\nbench with the steering mechanism before him. Further on, the other\nmen were dispersed, with one or two in the distant bow. Polter\nreclined on a cushioned couch amidships. Looking along the dark widely\nlevel bottom of the boat there were only the feet and legs of the men\nvisible.\n\nAlan whispered, \"Let's get closer.\"\n\nWe were insects soundlessly scuttling unnoticed in the dimness. And it\nwas noisy down here--the clank of the steering mechanism; the swish,\nand surge of the water against the hull; the voices of the men.\n\nWe passed the boots of the seated helmsmen, and found another hiding\nplace nearer Polter. We could see his giant length plainly. None of\nthe other men were near him. He was reclining on an elbow, stretched\nat ease on the cushion. And at the moment, he was fumbling with the\nchains that fastened the little golden cage to his chest. The cage was\ndouble its former size to us now. A shaft of pale light came down,\nreflected from the great sail surface overhead. It struck the bars of\nthe cage. We could see a small figure in there.\n\nBabs!\n\nThen we heard Polter's voice. \"I will let you out, Babs. You come out,\nsit on my hand and talk with me. That will be nice? We haf a little\ntime.\"\n\nHe unfastened the cage and put it on the cushion beside him. He was\nstill propped up on one elbow.\n\n\"I let you out, now. Be careful, Babs.\"\n\nMy heart was almost smothering me. \"Alan! We've got to get still\ncloser! Try something! Get large, shall we?\"\n\nAlan whispered tensely, \"I don't know! Oh, I don't know what to do!\nThis thing--\"\n\nThis thing so strange.\n\n\"We can get closer,\" Glora whispered. \"But never larger--not here.\nThey would discover us too soon.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe crept forward. We reached the edge of the cushion. Its top surface\nwas a trifle lower than our heads--a billowing, wrinkled mass of\nfabric. But I saw that the folds of it were rough enough to afford a\nfoothold. I thought that I could climb it. We stood erect. There was a\ndeep shadow along here, but it was brighter on the cushion top. We\ncould see over its edge; an undulating spread of surface with the\ngiant length of Polter stretched there. The cage was nearer to us.\nPolter's great fingers fumbled with it; a door in the lattice bars\nflipped open.\n\n\"Careful, my Babs!\" His voice was a throaty, rumbling roar from above\nus. \"Careful! I do not want you to be hurt.\"\n\nFrom the little doorway came the figure of Babs! The starlight glowed\non her long blue dress; her black hair was tumbling over her\nshoulders; her face was pale, but she was unhurt.\n\nBabs! I think that I had never loved her so much as at that moment.\nNor ever seen her so beautiful as in that miniature, standing at the\ndoor of her golden cage, bravely facing the monstrous misshapen figure\nof her captor.\n\nWe heard her small voice.\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Stand quiet. Now I put my hand for you.\"\n\nHis monstrous hand bristled with a thatch of heavy black hair. He\nbrought it carefully sliding along the cushion. Babs was barely the\nlength of one of its finger joints. She climbed upon its palm.\n\n\"That iss right, Babs. Now I bring you--hold tight to my finger. Here,\nI crook the little one. Fling your arms around it.\"\n\nWith a swoop his hand took her aloft and away. Then we saw her, twenty\nfeet or so in the air, still on his hand as he held it near his face.\n\n\"Now we haf a little talk, Babs. When we get to the island, I put you\nback in your cage.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had a sudden flash of realization. Something I could do. I did not\nplan it. I know now my judgment was bad. I recall it struck me that\nAlan would want to do it also. And, perhaps, even Glora. That would\nnot work. My chances, however desperate, were better alone. And Glora\nand Alan--in our present size-could doubtless disembark safely. Glora\nknew the lay-out of the island. She could follow Polter.\n\nAlan and Glora were standing beside me, peering over that billowing\ncushion spread toward the distant giant palm with Babs standing upon\nit. I gripped Alan's shoulder.\n\n\"See here, Alan,\" I whispered vehemently, \"whatever happens, we must\nfollow Polter. Glora knows the way. Some chance will come. What we\nwant is an opportunity to get large without discovery. Then rush\nPolter!\"\n\nAlan's white face turned to me. \"Yes, that's what we're planning. But\nGeorge, here on this boat--\"\n\n\"Of course. Can't do it here. Tell Glora, be sure and follow Polter.\nWhatever happens, you think of nothing else: you won't, will you?\"\n\n\"George, what--\"\n\n\"We've got to make some opportunity.\" I was trembling inside, fearful\nthat Alan would be suspicious of me. Yet I had to make sure that he\nand Glora would stay as close to Polter as possible.\n\n\"Yes,\" Alan agreed. \"Listen to them.\"\n\nPolter was talking to Babs. But I did not hear the words. I moved a\ntrifle away. Rash decision! I hardly decided anything. There was only\nthe vision of Babs before me; my love for her. And my desperate need\nof doing something; getting to her; seeing her, being with her; having\nher near my own size again as though the blessed normality of that\nwould rationalize and lessen her danger. If only I had been less rash!\nIf only back there in that tunnel I had stopped to see what it was my\nfoot kicked against!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI slid away. Alan and Glora did not notice it; they were whispering\ntogether and gazing over the cushion at Babs. In the floor shadow I\nmoved some ten feet. On the undulating top of the cushion the little\ngolden cage stood with its lattice door open! It was only a few feet\nfrom my face.\n\nI fumbled at my belt for the diminishing vial. I found one pellet\nleft. Well, that would be enough. I was hurried. Alan might discover\nme. Polter might move; put Babs back in the cage and close its door.\nWe might be near the island already, and the confusion, the activity\nof disembarking would defeat me. A thousand things might happen.\n\nI touched the pellet to my tongue. In a few seconds the drug action\nhad come and passed. The cushion top loomed well over my head. The\nside was a ridged, indescribably unnatural vista of cliff-wall. The\nfabric was coarse with hairy strands, dented into little ravines and\ncrevices. I climbed. I came panting to the pillow surface. The golden\ncage was six or eight feet away and was now two feet high.\n\nAgain I touched the drug to my tongue; held it an instant. The cage\ndrew away; grew to a normal six-foot height; then larger, until in a\nmoment it stopped. I stood peering at it, trying to gauge its size in\nrelation to me. I wanted so intensely now to be normal to Babs. The\ncage seemed about ten feet high. A little less, possibly. I barely\ntasted the pellet, and replaced it carefully in the vial. I could only\nhope its efficacy would be preserved.\n\nI had to chance that I would not be seen now crossing this billowy\nexpanse. I ran. The rope strands of the fabric now had spaces between\ntheir curving surfaces. The cage was a shining golden house, set on\nthis wide rolling area. Far in the distance there was a blur--Polter's\nreclining body.\n\nI reached the cage. It was a room about ten feet square and equally as\nhigh. Walled solid, top and bottom, and on three sides. The front was\na lattice of bars, with a narrow six-foot-high doorway, standing open\nnow.\n\nI dashed in. The interior was not wholly bare. There was a\nmetal-wrought couch fastened to the wall, with a railing around it and\nhandles. It suggested a ship's bunk. There was a railing at convenient\nheight all around the wall.\n\nI sought a hiding place. I saw just one--under the couch. It was\nsecluded enough. There was a grille-like lattice extending down from\nthe seat to the floor. I squeezed under one end, and lay wedged behind\nthe grille.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHow much time passed I do not know. My thoughts were racing. Babs\nwould be coming.\n\nI heard the distant approaching rumble of Polter's voice. Through the\ngrille I could see across the floor of the ten-foot cage to the front\nlattice bars. Outside, there appeared a huge, pink-white, mottled\nblob--Polter's hand, a ridged and pitted surface with great bristling\nblack stalks of hair.\n\nThe figure of Babs came through the cage doorway. Blessed normality!\nThe same slim little Babs who always stood, since we were both\nmatured, with her head about level with my shoulders.\n\nThe latticed door swung shut with a reverberating metallic clank. Babs\nstood tense, clinging to the wall railing. I heard the blurred rumble\nof Polter's voice.\n\n\"Hold tightly, my little Babs!\"\n\nThe room lurched; went upward and sidewise with a wild dizzying swoop.\nBabs clung; and I was wedged prone under the couch. Then the movement\nstopped; there was a jolting, rocking, and outside I heard the clank\nof metal. Polter was fastening the chains of the cage to his chest.\n\nA white reflected glow now came through the bars. It was starlight\nreflected from Polter's shirt bosom. An abyss of distance was outside.\nI could see nothing but the white glow.\n\nMomentarily there was very little movement to the room. Only the\nrhythmic sway of Polter's breathing and an occasional jolt as he\nshifted his position. The floor was tilted at a sharp angle. Babs came\ntoward the couch, pulling herself along the wall railing.\n\nI called softly, \"Babs! Babs, dear!\"\n\nShe stopped. I called again, \"Babs! Don't cry out! It's George!\nHere--stand still!\"\n\nShe gave a little cry. \"George--where are you? I don't--\"\n\nI slid out from my concealment and stood up, holding to the railing.\n\n\"Babs, dear.\"\n\nBlessed normality of size! She cried again, \"George! You! George,\ndear--\"\n\nShe edged along the railing, a step or two down the tilting floor,\nthen released her hold and flung herself into my waiting arms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I think we are landing. Hold the railing, George. When the room moves\nit goes with a rush.\"\n\nBabs laughed softly. It must have seemed to her, after being alone in\nhere, that now our plight was far less desperate. She had told me how\nshe was captured. A man accosted her on the terrace, saying he wanted\nto speak to her about Alan. Then a weapon threatened her. Amid all\nthose people she was held up in old fashioned style, hurried to a\ntaxicar and whirled away.\n\nShe was saying now, \"When Polter moves, it is dizzying. You'll see.\"\n\n\"I have already, Babs. Heavens, that swoop!\"\n\nThe room was more level now. We carefully drew ourselves to the front\nlattice. Polter was standing, and we had the white sheen from his\nshirt-front. A sheer drop was outside the bars, but looking down I\ncould see the outlines of his body with the huge spread of the boat\ninterior underneath us.\n\nA confusion of rumbling voices sounded. Blurred giant shapes were\noutside. The room jolted and swayed as the boat landed and Polter\ndisembarked.\n\nBabs stood clinging to me. Blessed normality of size! We, at least,\nwere normal--this metal barred room, Babs and I. But outside was the\nabnormality of largeness. I think that in relation to us, the men were\nof over two hundred foot stature, and the hunched Polter a trifle\nless. It seemed as he walked that we were lurching at least a hundred\nand fifty feet above the ground.\n\n\"You had better hide,\" Babs urged. \"He might stop and speak to\nsomeone. If anyone peered in here you would be seen: no chance then,\neven to get across the room.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was true. But for a few moments I lingered, though I could\ndistinguish vegetation on their flat roof-tops, as though\nflower-gardens were laid there.\n\nWe passed a house with its hundred-foot oval windows all aglow with\nlight. Music floated out--a distant blare of musical sounds, and the\nribald laughter of giant voices. I had seen no women among these\ngiants of the islands. But now a huge face was at one of the ovals. A\ndissolute, painted woman of Earth, staring out at Polter as he passed.\nIt was like the enormous close-up image on a large motion picture\nscreen. She shouted a ribald jest as he went by.\n\n\"George, please go back. Suppose she had seen you?\"\n\nWe were ascending a hill. A distance ahead a great oblong building\nloomed like a giant's palace, which indeed it was. We headed for it,\npassed through a vast arching doorway into the greater dimness of an\nechoing interior. I scurried back across the lurching room and again\nwedged myself under the couch. Babs stood at the lattice ten feet\naway. We dared to talk in low tones; the rumbling voices and footsteps\noutside would make our tiny voices inaudible to Polter.\n\nI was tense with my plans. I had told them to Babs. With the one\npartially used remaining pellet of the diminishing drug we could make\nourselves small enough to walk out through the bars. Then my black\nvial of the enlarging chemicals, as yet unused, would take us up, out\nto our own world. We could not use the drugs now. But the chance might\ncome when Polter would set the cage on the ground, or somewhere so\nthat we might climb down from it, with a chance to hide and get large\nbefore we were discovered. I would fight our way upward; all I needed\nwas a fair start in size.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut I lay now with doubts assailing me. This was the first moment I\nhad had for calm thoughts, though in truth they were far from calm!\nWhere were Alan and Glora? Following us now? I could only hope so.\nOnce out of this, Babs and I would have to rejoin them. But how? A\npanic swept me. I should not have left them. Or at least I should have\ntold them what I was trying, and given Alan a chance to plan.\n\nThe panic grew upon me, the premonition of disaster. From my belt I\ntook the opalescent vial with its one partly used pellet. I dumped the\npellet out. It was spoiling! The former exposure of the air, the\nmoisture of my tongue, had ruined it! I had no need to guess at the\ncatastrophe; as I held its crumbling, deliquescing fragments on my\npalm it melted into vapor and was gone!\n\nWe could not make ourselves smaller! We would have to wait now until\nPolter opened the cage. But once outside, the enlarging drug would\ngive us our chance to fight our way upward. My trembling fingers\nsought the black vial in my belt. It was not there! My mind flung\nback: in that tunnel, something had dropped and I had kicked it!\nAccursed chance! My accursed, heedless stupidity!\n\nI had lost the black vial! We were helpless! Caged! Marooned here in a\nsize microscopic!\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n_From a Drop of Water_\n\nI lay concealed, and Babs stood at the lattice of our cage room. I was\naware that Polter had entered some vast apartment of this giant\npalace. A brighter light was outside; I heard voices--Polter's and\nanother man's. I could see the distant monster shape of one. He was at\nfirst so far away that all his outline was visible. A seated man, in a\nhuge white room. I thought there were great shelves with enormous\nbottles. The spread of table tops passed under our cage as Polter\nwalked by them. They held a litter of apparatus, and there was the\nsmell of chemicals in the air. It seemed that this was a laboratory.\n\nThe man stood up to greet Polter. I had a glimpse of his head and\nshoulders level with us. He wore a white linen coat, open, soft collar\nand black tie. He seemed an old man, queerly old, with snow-white\nhair....\n\nI had an instant of whirling, confused impressions. Something was\nfamiliar about his face. It was seamed and wrinkled with lines of age\nand care. There were gentle blue eyes.\n\nThen all I could see was the vast spread of his white shirt and coat,\na black splotch of his tie outside our bars as Polter faced him.\n\nBabs gave a low cry. \"Why--why--dear God--\"\n\nAnd then I knew! And Polter's words were not needed, though I heard\ntheir rumble.\n\n\"I am back again, Kent. Are you still rebellious? You haf still\ndetermined to compound no more of our drugs? You would rather I killed\nyou? Then see what I haf here. This little cage, someone--\"\n\nIt was Dr. Kent, a prisoner here all these years!\n\nBabs turned her white face toward me. \"George, it's father! He's\nalive! Here!\"\n\n\"Quiet, Babs! Don't let them know I'm here. Remember!\"\n\nThe old man recognized her. \"Babs!\" It was an agonized cry. The blur\nof him was gone as he sank down into his chair.\n\nPolter continued standing. I could envisage his sardonic grin. Babs\nwas calling:\n\n\"Father, dear! Father!\"\n\nFrom over us came Polter's rumble. \"She iss glad to see you, Kent. I\nhaf her here, safe. You always knew I would nefer be satisfied until I\nhad my little Babs? Well, now I haf her. Can you hear me?\"\n\nA sudden desperate calmness fell on Babs. She called evenly, \"Yes, I\nhear you. Father, do not anger him. Do not rebel; do what he commands.\nDr. Polter, will you let me be with my father? After all these years,\nlet me be with him, just for a little while. In his size--normal.\"\n\n\"Hah! My Babs iss scheming.\"\n\n\"No! I want to talk to him, after so long. These years when I thought\nhe was dead.\"\n\n\"Scheming. You think, my little Babs, that he has the drugs? I am not\nso much a fool. He makes them. He can do that, and the last secret\nreactions only he can perform. He iss stubborn. Never would he tell me\nthat one reaction. But he makes no drugs complete, only when I am\nhere.\"\n\n\"No, Dr. Polter! I want only to be with him.\"\n\nThe old man's broken voice floated up to us. \"You will not harm her,\nPolter?\"\n\n\"No. Fear nothing. But you no longer rebel?\"\n\n\"I will do what you tell me.\" The tones carried hopeless resignation,\nyears of being beaten down, rebelling--but now this last blow\nvanquished him. Then he spoke again, with a sudden strange fire.\n\n\"Even for the life of my daughter, I will not make your drugs, Polter,\nif you mean to harm our Earth.\"\n\nThe golden cage room swooped as Polter sat down. \"Hah! Now we bargain.\nWhat do you care what I do to your world? You never will see it again.\nI can lie to you. My plans--\"\n\n\"I do care.\"\n\n\"Well, I will tell you, Kent. I am good natured now. Why should I not\nbe, with my dear little Babs? I tell you. I am done with the Earth\nworld. It iss so much nicer here. My friends, they haf a good time\nalways. We like this little atom realm. I am going out once more. I\nmust hide the little piece of golden quartz so no harm will come to\nit.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPolter was evidently in a high good humor. His voice fell to an\nintimate tone of comradeship; but still I could not mistake the irony\nof it.\n\n\"You listen to me, Kent. There was a time, years ago, when we were\ngood friends. You liked your young assistant, the hunchback Polter.\nIss it not so? Then why should we quarrel now? I am gifing up the\nEarth world. I wanted of it only the little Babs.... You look at me so\nstrange! You do not speak.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to say,\" retorted Dr. Kent wearily.\n\n\"Then you listen. I haf much gold above, in Quebec. You know that. So\nvery simple to take it out of our atom, grow large with it, to what we\ncall up there the size of a hundred feet. I haf a place, a room,\nsecluded from prying eyes under a dome-roof. I become very tall,\nholding a piece of gold. It is large when I am a hundred feet tall. So\nI haf collected much gold. They think I own a mine. I haf a smelter\nand my gold quartz I make into ingots, refined to the standard purity.\nSo simple, and I am a rich man.\n\n\"But gold does not bring happiness, my friend Kent.\" He chuckled\nironically at his use of the platitude. \"There is more in life than\nthe ownership of gold. You ask my plans. I haf Babs, now. I am gifing\nup our Earth world. The mysterious man they know as Frank Rascor will\nvanish. I will hide our little fragment of quartz. No one up there\nwill even try to find it. Then I come down here, with Babs, and we\nwill haf so nice a little government and rule this world. No more of\nthe drugs then will be needed, Kent. When you die, let the secret die\nwith you.\"\n\nAgain Polter's voice turned ingratiating, even more so than before.\n\"We will be friends, Kent. Our little Babs will lof me; why should\nshe not? You will tell her--advise her--and we will all three be very\nhappy.\"\n\nDr. Kent said abruptly, \"Then leave her with me now. That was her\nrequest, a moment ago. If you expect to treat her kindly, then why\nnot--\"\n\n\"I do! I do! But not now. I cannot spare her now. I am very busy, but\nI must take her with me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBabs had been silent, clinging to the bars of our cage. She called:\n\n\"Why? I ask you to put this cage down.\"\n\n\"Not now, little bird.\"\n\n\"And let me be with my father.\"\n\nIt struck a pang through me. Babs was scheming, but not the way Polter\nthought. She wanted the cage put on the floor, herself out, and a\nchance for me to escape. I had not yet told her of my miserable\nstupidity in losing the vial.\n\nPolter was repeating. \"No, little bird. Presently; not now. I may take\nyou out with me, my last trip out. I want to talk with you in a normal\nsize when I haf time.\"\n\nOur room swooped as he stood up. \"You think over what I haf said,\nKent. You get ready now to make the fresh drugs I will need to bring\ndown all my men from the outer world. They will all be glad to come,\nor, if not--well, we can easily kill those who refuse. You make the\ndrugs. I need plenty. Will you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That iss good. I come back soon and gif you the catalyst for that\nlast reaction. Will you be ready?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe blur outside our bars swung with a dizzying whirl as Polter turned\nand left the room, locking its door after him with a reverberating\nclank.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLeft alone in his laboratory, Dr. Kent began his preparations for\nmaking a fresh supply of the drugs. This room, with two smaller ones\nadjoining, was at once his workshop and his prison. He stood at his\nshelves, selecting the basic chemicals. He could not complete the\nfinal compounds. The catalyst which was necessary to the final\nreaction would be brought to him by Polter.\n\nHow long he worked there with his thoughts in a whirl at seeing Babs,\nhe did not know. His movements were automatic; he had done all this so\nmany times before. His mind was confused, and he was trembling from\nhead to foot, an old, queerly, unnaturally old man now--unnerved. His\nshaking fingers could hardly hold the test tubes.\n\nHis thoughts were flying. Babs was here, come down from the world\nabove. It was disaster--the thing he had feared all these years.\n\nHe suddenly heard a voice.\n\n\"Father!\"\n\nAnd again: \"Father!\" A tiny voice, down by his shoe-tops. Two small\nfigures were there on the floor beside him. They were both panting,\nwinded by running. They were enlarging; they had come from a smaller\nsize.\n\nIt was Alan and Glora, who had followed Polter from the boat,\ndiminished again, and come running through the tiny crack under the\nmetal door of the laboratory.\n\nThey grew to a foot in size, down by Dr. Kent's legs. He was too\nunnerved; he sat in a chair while Alan swiftly told him what had\nhappened. Babs was in the golden cage. Dr. Kent knew that; but none of\nthem knew what had happened to me.\n\n\"We must make you small, Father. We have the drugs, here with us.\"\n\n\"Yes! Yes, Alan. How much have you? Show me. Oh, my boy, that you are\nhere--and Babs--\"\n\n\"Don't you worry, we'll get away from him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGlora and Alan had almost reached Dr. Kent's size before their excited\nfingers could get out the vials. They took some of the diminishing\ndrug to check their growth. Alan handed his father a black vial.\n\n\"Yes, lad--\"\n\n\"No! Wait, Father! That's the wrong drug. This other--\"\n\nDr. Kent had opened the vial. His trembling hand spilled some of the\npellets, but none of them noticed it.\n\n\"Father, dear, this one.\" Alan held an opalescent vial. \"This one.\"\n\nGlora said abruptly, \"Listen! Is that someone coming?\"\n\nThey thought they heard approaching footsteps. A moment passed, but no\none came into the room.\n\n\"Hurry,\" urged Glora. \"It is nothing. We wait too long.\"\n\n\"My boy--Alan, dear, after all these years--\"\n\nThey were about to take the diminishing drug. From across the room\nthere came a very queer sound. A scuttling, scratching, and the drone\nof wings.\n\n\"Father, good God--look!\"\n\nOver by the wall, a giant fly was running across the floor. It was\ngrowing larger!\n\nAt Dr. Kent's feet the pellets he had dropped were crushed by his\nfootsteps and strewn on the floor. A fly had eaten of the sweetish\npowder.\n\nThe enlarging drug was loose!\n\nA few drops of water lay mingled with the drug on the floor. And from\nthe water nameless hideous things were rising!\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n_The Doomed Realm_\n\nTo Alan the first few moments that followed the escape of the drug\nwere the most horrible of his life. The discovery struck old Dr. Kent,\nGlora and Alan into a numb, blank confusion. They stood transfixed,\nstaring with cold terror. The fly was scurrying along the floor close\nagainst the wall Already it was as large as Alan's hand. It ran into\nthe corner, hit the wall in its confused alarm, and turned back. Its\nwings were droning with an audible hum. It reared itself on its hairy\nlegs, lifted and sailed across the room.\n\nAs though drawn by a magnet Alan turned to watch it. It landed on the\nwall. Alan was aware of Dr. Kent rushing with trembling steps to a\nshelf where bottles stood. Glora was stricken into immobility, the\nblood draining from her face.\n\nThe fly flew again. It passed directly over Alan. Its body, with a\nmembrane sac of eggs, was now as large as his head; its wide-spread\ntransparent wings were beating with a reverberating drone.\n\nAlan flung a bottle which was on the table beside him. It missed,\ncrashed against the ceiling, came down with splintering glass and\nspilling liquid. Fumes spread chokingly over the room.\n\nThe fly landed again on the floor. Larger now! Expanding with a\nhorribly rapid growth. Glora flung something--a little wooden rack\nwith a few empty test-tubes in it. The rack struck the monstrous fly,\nbut did not hurt it. The fly stood with hairy legs braced under its\nbulging body. Its multiple-lensed eyes were staring at the humans. And\nwith its size must have come a sense of power, for it seemed to Alan\nthat the monstrous insect had an abnormal alertness as it stood\nmeasuring its adversaries, gathering itself to attack them.\n\nOnly a few seconds had passed. Confused thoughts swept Alan. This fly\nwith its growth would soon fill this room. Burst it; burst upward\nthrough a wrecked palace; soar out, and by the power of its size\nalone, devastate this world.\n\nHe heard himself shouting. \"Father, get back! It's too large! I've got\nto kill it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLaunch himself upon it? Wrestle with it in a hand to hand combat? Alan\nedged around the center table. He was bathed in cold sweat. This thing\nso horrible! It was too large! Half the length of his own body, now.\nIn a moment it might be twice that! He was aware of Glora pulling at\nhim; and his father rushing past him with a bottle of liquid, and\nshouting:\n\n\"Alan! Run! You and this girl, get out of here! The other room--\"\n\nThen Alan saw the things upon the floor! His foot crushed one with a\nslippery squash! Nameless, hideous, noisome things grown monstrous,\nrisen from their lurking invisibility in the drops of water! Sodden,\ngray-black and green-slimed monsters of the deep; palpitating masses\nof pulp! One lay rocking, already as large as a football with\nstreamers of ooze hanging upon it, and a black-ink fluid squirting;\nothers were rods of red jelly-pulp, already as large as lead pencils,\nquivering, twitching. Germs of disease, these ghastly things,\nenlarging from the invisibility of a drop of water!\n\nThe fly landed with a thud on the center table. The fumes of the\nshattered bottle of chemicals were choking Alan. He flung himself\ntoward the monster fly, but Glora held him.\n\n\"No! Escape! The other room!\"\n\nDr. Kent was stamping the things upon the floor; pouring acids upon\nthem. Some eluded him. The air in the room was unbreathable....\n\nThey reached the bedroom. The laboratory was a hideous chaos. They\nwere aware of its outer door opening, disclosing the figure of Polter\nwho, undoubtedly, had been attracted by the noise. He shouted a\nstartled oath. Alan heard it above the beating wings of the monster\nfly. Things lurched at the opened door; Polter banged it upon them and\nrushed away, shouting the alarm through the palace.\n\nDr. Kent was stammering, \"Not the enlarging drug! Glora, child, the\nother! Hurry!\"\n\nAlan helped Glora with the opalescent vial. Things were lurching\ntoward this room from the laboratory. Alan with averted face, choked\nby the incoming fumes, slammed the door upon the gruesome turmoil.\n\nThey took the diminishing drug. The bedroom expanded. The hideous\nsounds from the laboratory, and the whole palace now ringing with a\nwild alarm, then faded into the blessed remoteness of distance above\nthem....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I think it is this way, Alan. Off there--a doorway from my bedroom.\nPolter always kept it locked, but it leads into a corridor. We must\nget out of here. A crack under the door--is that it, off there?\" Dr.\nKent pointed into the gloomy blur of distance. \"We are horribly\nsmall--it's so far to run--and I've lost my sense of direction.\"\n\nThe drug had ceased its action. The wooden floor of the room had\nexpanded to a spread of cellular surface, ridged with broken,\ntube-like tunnels; pits and jagged cave-mouths. A knot-hole yawned\nlike a crater a hundred feet away.\n\n\"We are too small,\" Glora protested hurriedly. \"The door is where you\nsay, Dr. Kent, but miles away.\"\n\nWith the other drug, the room contracted. The floor-surface shrank and\nsmoothed a little. The door was distinguishable--a square panel\nseveral hundred feet in width and towering into the upper haze. The\nblack line of the crack was visible along its bottom.\n\nThey ran to it. The top of the crack was ten feet above their heads.\nThey ran under, across the wide intervening darkness toward a glow of\nlight. Then they came from under the door into a corridor--and shrank\nagainst a cliff-wall as with a rush of wind and pounding tread the\nblurred shapes of a man's huge feet and legs rushed passed. The upper\nair was filled with rumbling shouts.\n\n\"We must chance it!\" exclaimed Dr. Kent. \"Too dangerous, so small!\nLarger--and if they see us, fight our way out!\"\n\nIn the turmoil of the doomed palace no one noticed them. They cast\naside all restraint. It was too dangerous to wait. The excessive dose\nthey took of the drug made the corridor shrink with dizzying speed.\nThey rushed along its length. Alan hurled a little man aside who was\nin their path. Already they were larger than the Polter people.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey squeezed out of a shrinking doorway. The dwindling island was a\nturmoil. Little figures were plunging from the palace. At the edge of\nthe water, Alan, Glora and Dr. Kent stood for an instant looking\nbehind them. The palace was rocking! Its roof heaved upward then\nsmashed and fell aside with the clatter of tumbling masonry. The\nmonstrous fly, its hideous face mashed and oozing, reared itself up\nand, with broken, torn wings tried to soar away. But it could not. It\nslipped back. The drone and buzz of its fright sounded over the chaos\nof noise. Other things came lurching and twitching upward; slithering\nout....\n\nThe expanding body of the fly was pushing the palace walls outward. In\na moment they collapsed and it emerged....\n\nTo Alan and his companions the scene was all shrinking into a\nminiature chaos of horror at their shoe-tops. A diminuendo of screams\nmingled down there. Overhead were the stars, shining peacefully\nremote. Nearby lay a rapidly narrowing channel of shining water. A\ntiny city was across it. Lights were moving. The panic had spread from\nthe island to Orena. Beyond the tiny city, a range of mountains\nshowed; a cliff, gleaming in the starlight; tunnel mouths.\n\nSuddenly against the stars off there, Alan saw the enlarging figure of\nPolter, his hunched shape unmistakable. He was facing the other way.\nHe lunged and scrambled into a yawning black hole in the mountains.\nPolter was escaping! None of these people except himself had the\ndrugs. He was escaping with the golden cage, out of this doomed atomic\nworld to our Earth above.\n\nGlora murmured, \"There is our way out. Your way. And that is Polter\ngoing. I think he did not see us. So much is growing gigantic here.\"\nShe clung to Alan. \"Dear one--\"\n\nDr. Kent muttered, \"We will wait a moment--wade across--or leap over,\nand follow him out. Babs with him--dear God I hope so! This doomed\nrealm!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlan held Glora close. And suddenly he was laughing--a madness, half\nhysteria. \"Why, this, all this--why look, Glora, it's funny! This\nlittle world all excited, an ant-hill, outraged! Look! There's our\ngiant sailboat!\"\n\nDown near their feet the inch-long sailboat stood at its dock. Tiny\nhuman figures were rushing for it; others, floundering in the water,\nwere trying to climb upon it. Dr. Kent had stepped from the shore a\nfoot or two, and tiny, lashing white rollers rocked the boat, almost\nengulfing it.\n\nAlan's laugh rang out, \"God! It's funny, isn't it? All those little\ncreatures, so excited!\"\n\n\"Steady, lad!\" Dr. Kent touched him. \"Don't let yourself laugh! A\nmoment now, then we'll wade across. Polter won't have much start on\nus. We mustn't get too close to him in size, but try and attack him\nunawares. We have got to get Babs away from him.\"\n\nThe narrowing passage rose hardly to their knees. They stepped ashore,\nwell to one side of the toy city. Their growth had almost stopped. But\nsuddenly Alan realized that Glora was diminishing! She had taken the\nother drug.\n\n\"Glora!\"\n\n\"I must go back, Alan. This is my world, doomed perhaps, but I cannot\nforsake it now. I must give the enlarging drug to my father. And\nothers who can rise and fight these monsters.\"\n\n\"Glora!\"\n\nDr. Kent said hurriedly, \"She's right, Alan. There is a chance they\ncan save their city. For her to leave them would be dastardly.\"\n\nShe cried, \"You go on up, Alan. You have enough of the drugs. Leave\nme, dear one--I am going back!\"\n\n\"No!\" he protested. \"You must not! Or if you do, I'll come with you!\"\n\nShe clung to him. He felt her body diminishing within his encircling\narms. His love for her swept him--this girl who had cajoled Polter, or\ntricked him, stolen several of the little vials from him heaven knows\nhow, and followed him up to the other world. This girl whom Alan now\nknew he loved, was leaving him. Forever?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he stood there, with the miniature landscape at his feet in the wan\nstarlight, the panic-stricken tiny city, the island with its monsters\nrising to overwhelm this microscopic world--it seemed to Alan then\nthat if he let her go it was the end for him of all life's promised\nhappiness.\n\n\"Alan, lad, come.\" His father was pulling at him. So horrible a\nchoice! Alan thought that I was back on that island. But Babs, a\nprisoner in the golden cage, was with Polter, plunging upward in size.\nAnd his father was beside him, pleading.\n\n\"Alan--come--I can't get out alone. Nor save Babs. And the maddened\nPolter, with the power of this drug, can conquer and enslave our Earth\nas he has enslaved Orena--just one little city of one tiny golden\natom! Believe me, lad, your duty lies above.\"\n\nGlora's head was now down at Alan's waist. He stooped and kissed her\nwhite forehead; his fingers, just for an instant, smoothed her glossy\nhair.\n\n\"Good-by, Glora.\"\n\n\"Dear one, good-by.\"\n\nShe plunged away, and her tread as she dwindled mashed the forest\nbehind the city. Alan and his father ran for the cliff. They were too\nlarge to squeeze into the little hole. But in a moment they made\nthemselves smaller. They climbed as they dwindled; checked the drug\naction and rushed into the tunnel-mouth.\n\nAlan stopped just for an instant to gaze out over the starlit scene.\nIt was almost the same viewpoint from which he had his first sight of\nGlora's world only an hour or two before. The distant island beyond\nthe city showed plainly with the shining water around it. The\nvegetation there was growing! And there were dark, horribly formless\nblobs lurching outward and rising with monstrous bulk against the\nbackground of the stars!\n\n\"Alan! Come, lad!\"\n\nWith a prayer for Glora trembling on his lips, Alan plunged into the\ndim phosphorescent gloom of the tunnel.\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n_The Escape_\n\nTo Babs and me the ride in the golden cage strapped to Polter's chest\nas he made his escape outward into largeness was an experience awesome\nand frightening almost beyond conception. We heard the alarm in the\npalace on the island. Polter rushed to Dr. Kent's laboratory door,\nlooked in, and in a moment banged it shut. Babs and I saw very little.\nWe knew only that something horrible had happened; we could see only a\nblur with formless things in the void beneath our bars; and there were\nthe choking fumes of chemicals surging at us.\n\nPolter rushed through the castle corridor. We heard rumbling distant\nshouts.\n\n\"The drug is loose! The drug is loose! Monsters! Death for everyone!\"\n\nThe room swayed with horrible dizzying lurches as Polter ran. We clung\nto the lattice bars, our legs and arms entwined. There were moments\nwhen Polter leaped, or suddenly stooped, and our reeling senses all\nbut faded.\n\n\"Babs! Babs, darling, don't let go! Don't lose consciousness!\"\n\nIf she should be limp, here in this lurching room, her body to be\nflung back and forth across its confines--that would be death in a\nmoment. I feared I could not hold her. I managed to get an arm about\nher waist.\n\n\"Babs!\"\n\n\"I'm--all right, George. I can stand it. We're--he is enlarging.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI saw water far beneath us, lashed into a turmoil of foam with\nPolter's wading steps. There was a brief swaying vista of a toy city;\nstarlight overhead; a lurching swaying miniature of landscape as\nPolter ran for the towering cliffs. Then he climbed and scrambled into\nthe tunnel-mouth. Had he turned at that instant doubtless he would\nhave seen the rising distant figures of Glora, Alan and Dr. Kent. But\nhe did not see them, evidently. Nor did we.\n\nPolter spoke only very occasionally to Babs. \"Hold tightly!\" It was a\nrumbling voice from above us. He made no move to touch the cage,\nexcept that a few times the great blur of his hand came up to adjust\nits angle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lurching and jolting was less violent in the tunnel. Polter's\nfrenzy to escape was subsiding into calmness. He traversed the tunnel\nwith a methodical swinging stride. We were aware of him climbing over\nthe noisome litter of the dead giant's body which blocked the tunnel's\nfurther end. We heard his astonished exclamations. But evidently he\ndid not suspect what had happened, thinking only that the stupid\nmessenger had miscalculated his growth and been crushed.\n\nWe emerged into a less dim area. Polter did not stop at the fallen\ngiant. Nothing mattered now to him, quite evidently, save his own\nrapid exit with Babs from this atomic realm. His movements seemed\ncalm, yet hurried.\n\nWe realized now how different was an outward journey from the trip\ncoming in. This was all only an inch of golden quartz! The stages\nupward were frequently only a matter of growth in size; the distances\nin this vast desert realm of golden rock always were shrinking. Polter\nmany times stood almost motionless until the closing dwindling walls\nmade him scramble upward into the greater space above.\n\nIt may have been an hour, or less. Babs and I, from our smaller\nviewpoint, with the landscape so frequently blurred by distance and\nPolter's movements, seldom recognized where we were. But I realized\nthat going out was far easier in every way than coming in. Easier to\ndetermine the route, since usually the diminishing caverns and gullies\nmade the upward step obvious.... We knew when Polter scrambled up the\nincline ramp.\n\nIt seemed impossible for us to plan anything. Would Polter make the\nentire trip without a stop? It seemed so. We had no drugs. Our cage\nwas barred beyond possibility of our getting out. But even if we had\nhad the drugs, or had our door been open, there was no escape. An\nabyss of distance was always yawning beyond our lattice--the sheer\nprecipice of Polter's body from his chest to the ground.\n\n\"Babs, we must make him stop. If he sits down to rest, you might get\nhim to take you out. I must reach his drugs.\"\n\n\"Yes. I'll try it, George.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPolter was momentarily standing motionless as though gazing around\nhim, judging what to do next. His size seemed stationary. Beyond our\nbars we could see the distant circular walls as though this were some\ngiant crater-pit in which Polter was standing. Then I thought I\nrecognized it--the round, nearly vertical pit into which Alan had\nplunged his hand and arm. Above us then was a gully, blind at one end.\nAnd above that, the outer surface, the summit of the fragment of\ngolden quartz.\n\n\"Babs! I know where we are! If he takes you out, keep his attention.\nI'll try and get one of his black vials. Make him hold you near the\nground. If I see you there, in position where you can jump, I'll\nstartle him. Oh, Babs, dear, it's desperately dangerous but I can't\nthink of anything else. Jump! Get away from here. I'll keep his\nattention on me. Then I'll join you if I can--with the drug.\"\n\nPolter was moving. We had no time to say more.\n\n\"Yes! Yes, I'll try it, George.\" For just an instant she clung to me\nwith her soft arms about my neck. Our love was sweeping us in this\ndesperate moment, and it seemed that above us was a remote Earth world\nholding the promise of all our dreams. Or were we star-crossed, doomed\nlike the realm of the atom? Was this swift embrace now marking the end\nof everything for us?\n\nBabs called, \"Dr. Polter?\"\n\nWe could feel his movements stopping.\n\n\"Yes? You are all right, Babs?\"\n\nShe laughed--a ripple of silvery laughter--but there was tragic fear\nin her eyes as she held her gaze on me. \"Yes, Dr. Polter, but\nbreathless. Almost dead, but not quite. What happened? I want to come\nout and talk to you.\"\n\n\"Not now, little bird.\"\n\n\"But I want to.\" To me it was a miracle that she could call so lightly\nand hold that note of lugubrious laughter in her voice. \"I am hungry.\nDon't you think of that? And frightened. Take me out.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was sitting down! \"You remind me that I am tired, Babs. And hungry,\nalso. I haf a little food. You shall come out for just a short time.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Take me carefully.\"\n\nOur tilted cage was near the ground as he seated himself. But still it\nwas too far for me to jump.\n\nI murmured, \"Babs--\"\n\n\"Wait, George! I'll fix that. You hide! If he looks in he'll see you,\nwhere you are now!\"\n\nI scrambled back to my hiding place. Polter's huge fingers were\nfumbling at our bars. The little door sprang open.\n\n\"Come, Babs.\"\n\nHe held the cupped bowl of his palm to the doorway. \"Come out.\"\n\n\"No!\" she called. \"It is too far down!\"\n\n\"Come. That iss foolish.\"\n\n\"No! I'm afraid. Put the cage on the ground.\"\n\n\"Babs!\" His finger and thumb came reaching in to seize her, but she\navoided them.\n\n\"Dr. Polter! Don't! You'll crush me!\"\n\n\"Then come out on my hand.\"\n\nHe seemed annoyed. I had scrambled back to the doorway; I knew he\ncould not see me so long as the cage remained strapped to his shirt\nfront.\n\nI whispered, \"I can make it, Babs!\"\n\nPolter was apparently on one elbow, half turned on his side. From our\ncage, the sloping gleaming white surface of his stiff glossy\nshirt-bosom went down a steep incline. His belt was down there, and\nthe outward bulging curve of his lap--a spreading surface where I\ncould land like a scuttling insect, unobserved, if only Babs could\nhold his attention.\n\nI whispered vehemently. \"Try it! Go out! Leave me! Keep talking to\nhim!\"\n\nShe called instantly, \"Very well, then. Bring your hand! Closer!\nCarefully! It seems so high up here!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe swung herself to his palm, and flung her arms about the great\npillar of his upcrooked finger. The bowl of his hand moved slowly\naway. I heard her calling voice, and his overhead rumble.\n\nI chanced it! I could not determine the exact position, or which way\nhe was looking.\n\nAgain I heard Bab's voice. \"Careful, Dr. Polter. Don't let me fall!\"\n\n\"Yes, little bird.\"\n\nI let myself down from the tilted doorway, hung by my hands and\ndropped. I struck the ramp-like yielding surface of his shirt-bosom. I\nslid, tumbling, scrambling, and landed softly in the huge folds of his\ntrouser fabric. I was unhurt. The width of his belt, high as my body,\nwas near me. I shrank against it; I found I could cling to its upper\nedge.\n\nMy hold came just in time. He shifted, and sat up. I was lifted with a\nswoop of movement. When it steadied I saw above me the top of his\nknee. His left leg was crooked, the foot drawn close to him. Babs was\nperched up there on the knee summit. His right leg was outstretched. I\nwas at the right side of his belt. I could dart off along that curving\nexpanse of his leg and leap to the ground. If he would hold this\nposition! One of the pouches of his belt was near me. The vial in it\nwas black. The enlarging drug! I moved toward it.\n\nBut Babs was too high to jump from that summit of his crooked knee! I\nthink she saw me at his belt. I heard her voice.\n\n\"I cannot eat up here. It is too high. Oh, please be careful how you\nmove! I am so dizzy, so frightened! You move with such great jerks!\"\n\nHe had what seemed a huge surface of bread and meat. He was breaking\noff crumbs to put before her. I reached the pouch of his belt. The\nvial was as long as my body. I tugged to try and lift it out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll the giant contours of Polter's body shifted as he cautiously\nmoved. I clung. I saw that Babs was being held gently between his\nthumb and forefinger. He lowered her to the ground, and she stood\nbeside the bread and meat he had placed there.\n\nAnd she had the courage to laugh! \"Why this--this is an enormous\nsandwich! You will have to break it.\"\n\nHe was leaning over her, half turned on his left side. The vial came\nfree. I shoved it; but I could not control its weight. I pushed\ndesperately. It slid over the round brink of his right hip, and fell\nbehind him. I heard the tinkling thud of it down on the rocks.\n\nThere was no alarm. I could not chance leaping from his hip. I\nscurried along the convex top of his outstretched leg, and beyond his\nknee I jumped.\n\nI landed safely. I could see the black vial back across the broken\nrock surface, with the bulge of Polter's hip above it. I ran back and\nreached the vial; tugged at its huge stopper. The cork began to yield\nunder my panting, desperate efforts. In a moment I would have a pellet\nof the enlarging drug; make away with it; startle Polter so that Babs\nmight dart off and escape.\n\nThe huge stopper of the vial was larger than my head. It came suddenly\nout. I flung it away, plunged in my hand, and seized an enormous round\npellet.\n\nThen abruptly the alarm came, and I had not caused it! Polter ripped\nout a startled, rumbling curse and sat upright. Under the curve of his\nleg, I saw that Babs had been momentarily neglected. She was running.\n\nAcross the boulder-strewn plain, two tiny men had appeared. Polter had\nseen them.\n\nThey were the enlarging figures of Dr. Kent and Alan!\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n_The Combat of Size_\n\nThe astounded Polter was taken wholly by surprise. He could have had\nno idea that anyone was following him. He thought he was alone with\nthe tiny Babs in this rock-strewn metal desert. What he saw as he\nscrambled to his feet were four insect-size humans, two of them at a\ndistance, and two within reach of him, and all of them scampering in\ndifferent directions. The ground was littered with crags and boulders;\nwas ridged and pitted, pock-marked, with tiny crater-holes and caves.\nThe four scuttling figures almost instantly had disappeared from his\nsight.\n\nI did not see where Babs went. I turned from the black vial of\nPolter's enlarging drug, and with the huge pellet under my arm I ran\nleaping over the rough ground and flung myself into a gully. I lay\nprone, flattened against a rock. In the murky distance of a pseudo-sky\noverhead, the monstrous head and shoulders of Polter were visible. I\ncould see down to just below his waist. The empty cage with its door\nflapping open hung against his shirt-front. He had stooped to try and\nrecover Babs. And instinctively his hands went to his belt to seize\nhis enlarging drug.\n\nThey were fumbling there now. He hauled out an opalescent vial of the\ndiminishing element. But his black vial was gone. His frown spread\ninto fear as he searched for it in the other compartments of his belt.\nI had thought that he had more than one black vial, but now it seemed\nnot. His huge face was swept with the panic of terror. He flung a wild\nglance around him.\n\nThrough the open end of my gully I saw in the distance, miles away,\nthe enlarging figure of Alan rising up. Then it ducked back of a\ndistant rocky peak. Polter undoubtedly saw it. He was fumbling with\nhis opalescent vial, and with confused panic upon him he made the\nmistake of taking the diminishing drug. And instantly seemed to regret\nit. His curse rumbled above me. His glance went down to the rocks at\nhis feet, and there he saw lying his black vial with its stopper out.\nHis body already was beginning to dwindle. He stooped, seized the\nvial, and took the enlarging drug. The shock of it made him stagger;\nmomentarily he disappeared from my line of vision but I could hear his\npanting breath and the unsteady pound of his footsteps.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI still held that huge round ball of the drug. I seized a loose stone\nand frantically knocked off a chunk--heaven knows how much, I do not.\nI shoved it into my mouth, chewed and hastily swallowed it. And with\nthe lurching, swaying, shrinking gully closing in upon me, I ran to\nget out of its distant open end.\n\nI was heading toward where Alan and his father were lurking. I came\nfrom the gully into the open, just as the walls closed behind me. The\nwhole scene was a dizzying blurred sway of contracting movement. I saw\nthat I was in a circular valley now some five miles in diameter, with\nits jagged enclosing walls rising sheerly perpendicular out of sight\nin the haze overhead.\n\nPolter had staggered backward. I saw him a mile or so away. His back\nat that instant was turned to me. He was now no more than three or\nfour times my own height. He scrambled against the valley cliff-wall\nas though trying to find a foothold to climb up it. He went a little\nway, but fell back.\n\nNear me, Alan and old Dr. Kent suddenly appeared. I was larger. They\nflung themselves at my knees. Alan gasped:\n\n\"You, George! You got Babs?\"\n\n\"Yes--Babs is around somewhere! Stay down here! Don't lose her in\nsize! Stay small! Search and--\"\n\n\"But George--\"\n\n\"I'll tackle Polter. I've taken--God, I don't know how much I've taken\nof the drug!\"\n\nThey were shrinking down by my boot-tops. Alan shouted suddenly,\n\"There's Babs! Thank God, there's Babs!\"\n\nShe was too small; I could not see her, nor even hear her, though she\nmust have been calling to them. Alan again screamed up at me with his\nlittle voice:\n\n\"She's here, George! You--go on and get Polter! I can't overtake you\nyou--haven't enough of the drug!\" His tiny voice was fading away. \"Go\non and get him, George! This time--get him--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI swung with a staggering step around to face the open valley. It was\nshrunken now to barely half a mile of width. Its smooth walls rose\nsome two or three thousand feet to an upper circular horizon with\nmurky distance overhead. Polter stood across from me. He had tried to\nclimb out but could not. He saw me and came lurching. We were a\nquarter of a mile from each other. I ran forward through a shifting\nscene of shrinking rock walls and crawling, contracting ground.\nQuarter of a mile? It seemed hardly more than a score of running\nstrides before Polter loomed close ahead of me. He was still nearly\ntwice my size. I stooped, seized a loose boulder, and flung it. I\nmissed his face, but, as his hand went up carrying a bared\nknife-blade, by fortunate chance the stone struck his wrist. The knife\ndropped to the rocks. He stooped to recover it, but I was upon him. As\nI felt his huge arms go around me, half lifting me, my foot struck the\nknife. But in an instant it was swept down into smallness beneath us\nas we expanded above it.\n\nBoth of us were unarmed in this combat of size. I was a half-grown\nyouth in Polter's first grip upon me. I heard his panting words,\ngrimly triumphant:\n\n\"This--George Randolph, I haf been--waiting for so many many years!\nThe hunchback--takes his revenge--now--\"\n\nHe lifted me. His great arms were horribly powerful, but I could feel\nthem dwindling. I was enlarging faster. Just a few moments--if I could\nlast a few moments!... My feet were off the ground, my chest close\npressed against the little golden cage between us. He had a hand\nshoving back my head; his fingers sought my throat. I wound my legs\naround him, and then he tried to throw me down and fall upon me. But\nwe had twisted and my back was to the cliff. The rocks were shoving at\nus, insistently pushing with almost a living movement. Polter\nstaggered with me. His grip on my throat tightened, shutting off my\nbreath. My senses whirled. His grim sardonic face over me was blurred\nto my sight. I tore futilely at my throat to break his choking grip.\nAll the world was a roaring chaos to my fading senses. Then in the\nblur I saw horror sweep his expression. His fingers involuntarily\nloosened. I got a breath of blessed air, gasping, and my sight\ncleared.\n\nWalls were closing around us! We were in a pit barely ten feet wide,\nwith the top a few feet above Polter's head. The nearer wall shoved us\nagain. Our bodies almost filled the shrinking pit! Polter lurched and\ncast me off. I half fell, striking my shoulder against the opposite\nwall, and I saw Polter leap at the dwindling brink and scramble out.\n\nI was nearly wedged. As I rose, the top of the pit only reached my\nwaist. Polter had fallen on the upper ground, and was on hands and\nknees. Instead of standing up, he lurched at me; tried to shove me\nback. But I was out. I clutched at him. We were almost of a size now.\nWe rolled on the ground, locked together; rolled to the brink of the\npit and over it, as it shrank to a little round hole unnoticed beneath\nour threshing bodies!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the side of the circular valley Alan and Dr. Kent crouched with the\nsmaller figure of Babs between them. They saw Polter and me as two\nswaying gigantic forms locked in a death struggle, towering against\nthe sky. Tremendous expanded bodies! They saw us come to grips; saw\nthe great hunched Polter bend me backward, choking me.\n\nOur bodies lurched. Our huge legs with a single step brought us to the\ncenter of the valley. It was a shrinking valley to Alan, Babs and Dr.\nKent, for they too, were enlarging. But the fighting giant figures\nwere growing faster. In only a moment their shoulders were up there in\nthe sky, pressing against the narrowing cliff-walls.\n\nAlan gasped. \"But George will be crushed! Look at him!\"\n\nHorror swept them as they crouched watching. The enormous pillars of\nPolter's legs towered straight up from near at hand. Alan was aware of\nhimself screaming:\n\n\"George--out! You're too large! Too large for in here!\"\n\nAs though his microscopic voice could reach me--my head hundred of\nfeet above him. But he screamed it again. This was all in a few\nhorrible moments, though it seemed to the three watchers an eternity.\nAlan was helpless to aid me; they had taken all of the enlarging drug\nthey had.\n\nThen they saw Polter cast me off. I lurched and struck, with my\nshoulders wedged against the cliff directly over where they crouched.\nThe overhead sky was darkened as Polter scrambled upward.\n\nAlan was still screaming futilely, \"George--up! Get out!\"\n\nBabs huddled with white, horrified face, staring. Then I went out\nafter Polter. My disappearing legs were great dark blurs in the sky.\nAlan saw the valley now contracted to a thousand feet of width, with\nits cliffs equally as high. Then everything was smaller.... The sky\noverhead went dark again; from cliff to cliff a segment of our rolling\nbodies momentarily spanned the opening.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd presently Alan realized that the valley had narrowed to a pit. He\nstood up. \"Hurry! Now we can get out after them. Up there!\"\n\nThe opening above was empty. Polter and I were fighting some distance\naway....\n\nDr. Kent was soon large enough to scramble out of the pit. Alan handed\nthe little Babs up to him and followed. Alan saw that they were now in\na long gully, blind at one end with a five hundred-foot perpendicular\ncliff. Against the wall, the titanic form of Polter stood at bay. And\nI was fronting him. The summit of the cliff was lower than our waists.\nTriumph swept Alan; he saw that I was the larger! As Polter bored into\nme my backward step crossed the full width of the gully. Alan shouted:\n\n\"Down! Babs--Father!\"\n\nThey had barely time to flatten themselves in a narrow crevice between\nupstanding rocks before my foot crashed down. For an instant the sole\nof my boot formed a flat black ceiling as it trod and spanned the\nrocks. Then it lifted; was gone with a blurred swoop. They saw the\nwhite blur of my hand come down and snatch a tremendous boulder,\nraising it with a great sweep of movement into the sky. They saw me\ncrash it against Polter; but it only struck his shoulder. He roared\nwith anger. The whole sky was roaring and rumbling with our shouts and\nour panting breathing, and the ground was clattering, pounding with\nour giant tread. Huge loose boulders were tumbled in an avalanche\neverywhere.\n\nAgain it seemed to Alan that our lurching, heedlessly surging bodies\nmust be crushed within these contracting walls. Only our locked,\nintertwined legs were visible; our bodies were lost in the sky. Then\nit seemed to Alan that I had heaved Polter upward. And followed him.\nWe disappeared. There was a distant overhead rumble, and the murky\nsky, with vague patches of far-distant illumination in it, became\nempty of movement....\n\nThe walls presently were again closing upon Alan and his companions.\nThey ran out of the open end of the shrinking little gully and came to\na new upward vista....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI found myself a full head and shoulders taller than Polter. And he\nwas tiring, panting heavily. His face was cut and bleeding from the\nblows of my fists. The rock I heaved struck his shoulder. He roared,\nhead down, and bored into me. He was heavier than I. His weight flung\nme back. My foot slid on the loose stones of the gully floor. I did\nnot know that Babs, Alan and their father were huddled under those\nstones!\n\nMy back struck the opposite wall. Polter's upflung knee caught me in\nthe stomach, all but knocking the breath from me. He was desperate,\noblivious to the closing walls. And as he flung his arms with a grip\nabout my neck, hanging, trying to bear me down, I saw in his blazing\ndark eyes what seemed the light of suicide. I think that then, with a\nsudden frenzied madness he realized that he was beaten. And tried to\npull us to the ground and let the walls crush us.\n\nI summoned all my remaining strength and heaved us forward. I broke\nhis hold. His body was jammed back against a lowering wall. Its top\nseemed almost at our knees. I shoved frantically. He fell backward and\nI jumped after him.\n\nWe were on a great rocky plateau. But it was shrinking, crawling into\nitself. Spots of light were in the murk overhead; there seemed a\ndistant circular horizon of emptiness around us.\n\nPolter was lying in a heap. But it was trickery, for as I incautiously\nbent over him his hand crashed a rock against my head. I reeled, with\nall the world turning black, but did not fall. There was a horrible\ninstant when my senses were going, but I fought to hold them. Blood\nfrom a wound on my forehead was streaming in my eyes. I was\nstaggering. Then I realized I was grimly tossing my head, shaking the\nblood away; and little by little my sight came back.\n\nPolter was on his feet, rushing me. His fist came with an upward swing\nat my chin, but I ducked my head aside at the last moment.\n\nAnd suddenly, fighting up there in the open, my mind envisaged how\ngigantic we were! This was a great upland plateau, rounded with miles\nof distance and a shadowy, dimly radiant abyss beyond its circular\nhorizon. And I was a thousand feet or more tall! A titan, looming here\nin the sky!...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy fist quite unexpectedly caught Polter's jaw. His simultaneous swing\nwent wild, though I leaped backward from it. He staggered, and his\narms dropped to his sides. I was crouched forward, guarded, watching\nhim while I gasped for breath. There was the briefest of instants when\nan expression of vague surprise swept his face. But I had not knocked\nhim out.\n\nIt was death overtaking him. His heart was yielding, overtaxed from\nthis strain; and I think there at the last, he realized it. The blood\ndrained suddenly from his face and lips, leaving them livid. I saw\nfear, then a wild horror in his eyes. He stood swaying. Then his knees\ngave way and he toppled. He fell from his height in the air where I\nstood gazing at him--fell forward on his face, his titanic length\nspread all across the top of this rocky landscape!\n\nFor a moment I did not move. My head was reeling, my ears roaring.\nBlood streamed into my eyes. I wiped it away with a torn sleeve and\nstood panting, gazing at the glowing distance around me.\n\nI was a titan, standing there. The body of Polter was shrinking at my\nfeet. The circular abyss of emptiness came nearer as this rocky\neminence contracted.\n\nSuddenly my attention went to the sky overhead. Vague distant lights\nwere there. Then a broad flat blur seemed spread over me. Light\neverywhere was growing. Beyond the nearby brink of the abyss was a\nwhite reflected radiance from beneath. Abruptly I realized there was a\nlevel, flat white plain running far off there in the distance.\n\nOverhead a radiance contracted into a spot of light. A shape in the\nsky moved! I heard a far-away rumble--a human voice!\n\nThe body of Polter lay at my feet. It was hardly the length of my\nforearm I stood, a titan.\n\nAnd then, with a shock of realization, I saw how tiny I was! This was\nthe broken top of that fragment of golden quartz the size of a walnut!\nI was standing there, under the lens of the giant microscope in\nPolter's dome-room laboratory, with half a dozen astounded Quebec\npolice officials peering down at me!\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n_Mysterious Little Golden Rock_\n\nI need not detail the aftermath of our emergence from the atom. Dr.\nKent and Babs followed me out within a few moments. But Alan was not\nwith them! He had seen Polter fall. His father and Babs were safe. The\nsacrifice he had made in leaving Glora was no longer needed.\n\nDown there on the rocky plateau, Dr. Kent suddenly realized that Alan\nwas dwindling.\n\n\"Father, I must! Don't you understand? Glora's world is menaced. I\ncan't leave her like this. My duty to you and Babs is ended. I did my\nbest, Dad--you two are safe now.\"\n\n\"Alan! My boy!\"\n\nHe was already down at Dr. Kent's waist, Bab's size. He held up his\nhand. \"Dad, good-by.\" His rugged, youthful face was flushed, his voice\nchoked. \"You--you've been a mighty good father to me. Always.\"\n\nBabs flung her arms about him. \"Alan, don't!\"\n\n\"But I must.\" He smiled whimsically as he kissed her. \"You wouldn't\nwant to leave George, would you? Never see him again? I'm not asking\nyou to do that, am I?\"\n\n\"But, Alan--\"\n\n\"You've been a great little pal, Babs. I'll never forget it.\"\n\n\"Alan! You talk as though you were never coming back!\"\n\n\"Do I? But of course I'm coming back!\" He cast her off. \"Babs, listen.\nFather's upset. That's natural. You tell him not to worry. I'll be\ncareful, and do what I can to save that little city. I must find Glora\nand--\"\n\nBabs was suddenly trembling with eagerness for him. \"Yes! Of course\nyou must, Alan!\"\n\n\"Find her and bring her out here! I'll do it! Don't you worry.\" He was\ndwindling fast. Dr. Kent had collapsed to a rock, staring down with\nhorror-stricken eyes. Alan called up to Babs:\n\n\"Listen! Have George watch the chunk of gold-quartz. Have it guarded\nand watched day and night. Handle it carefully, Babs!\"\n\n\"Yes! Yes! How long will you be gone, Alan?\"\n\n\"Heavens--how do I know? But I'll come back, don't you worry. Maybe in\nonly a day or two of your time.\"\n\n\"Right! Good-by, Alan!\"\n\n\"Good-by,\" his tiny voice echoed up. \"Good-by, Babs--Father!\"\n\nBabs could see his miniature face smiling up at her. She smiled back\nand waved her arm as he vanished into the pebbles at her feet.\n\nThe eyes of youth! They look ahead; they see all things so easily\npossible! But old Dr. Kent was sobbing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt has broken Dr. Kent. A month now has passed. He seldom mentions\nAlan to Babs and me. But when he does, he tries to smile and say that\nAlan soon will return. He has been very ill this last week, though he\nis better now. He did not tell us that he was working to compound\nanother supply of the drugs, but we knew it very well.\n\nAnd his emotion, the strain of it, made him break. He was in bed a\nweek. We are living in New York, quite near the Museum of the American\nSociety for Scientific Research. In a room of the biological\ndepartment there, the precious fragment of golden quartz lies guarded.\nA microscope is over it, and there is never a moment of the day or\nnight without an alert, keen-eyed watcher peering down.\n\nBut nothing has appeared. Neither friend nor foe--nothing. I cannot\nsay so to Babs, but often I fear that Dr. Kent will suddenly die, and\nthe secret of his drugs die with him. I hinted once that I would make\na trip into the atom if he would let me, but it excited him so greatly\nI had to laugh it off with the assurance that of course Alan will soon\nreturn safely to us. Dr. Kent is an old man now, unnaturally old,\nwith, it seems, the full weight of eighty years pressing upon him. He\ncannot stand this emotion. I think he is despairingly summoning\nstrength to work upon his drugs, fearful that he will not be equal to\nit. Yet more fearful to disclose the secret and unloose so diabolical\na power.\n\nThere are nights when with Dr. Kent asleep, Babs and I slip away and\ngo to the Museum. We dismiss the guard for a time, and in that private\nroom we sit hand in hand by the microscope to watch. The fragment of\ngolden quartz lies on its clean white slab with a brilliant light upon\nit.\n\nMysterious little golden rock! What secrets are there, down beyond the\nvanishing point in the realm of the infinitely small! Our human\nlongings go to Alan and to Glora.\n\nBut sometimes we are swept by the greater viewpoint. Awed by the\nmysteries of nature, we realize how very small and unimportant we are\nin the vast scheme of things. We envisage the infinite reaches of\nastronomical space overhead. Realms of largeness unfathomable. And at\nour feet, everywhere, are myriad entrances into the infinitely small.\nWith ourselves in between--with our fatuous human consciousness that\nwe are of some importance to it all!\n\nTruly there are more things in Heaven and Earth than are dreamed of in\nour philosophy!\n\n\nINVISIBLE EYES\n\nAn invisible eye that can see in the dark and detect the light of a\nship two miles away on a black foggy night was introduced to newspaper\nmen recently by its inventor, John Baird of television fame. He calls\nthe invention \"Noctovisor.\"\n\nIt looks like a large camera and can be mounted on a ship or airplane.\nIt was announced that it would soon be tried on trans-Atlantic liners.\nFor the demonstration it was mounted in the garden of Baird's cottage,\noverlooking the twinkling lights of Dorking. In the dark beyond those\nlights an automobile headlight three miles away pointed toward the\ncottage.\n\nAt a signal from the inventor a sheet of ebonite, as a substitute for\na supposed fog, two miles thick, was placed in front of the headlight.\nNot a glimmer was then visible to the human eye, but it appeared on\nthe noctovisor screen as a bright red disc. It was supposed to have\nparticular value in permitting a navigator in a fog to tell the exact\ndirection of a beacon and to estimate roughly its distance.\n\nThe device is a combination of camera lens, television transmitter and\ntelevision receiver. The lens throws a distant image on the exploring\ndisc of the transmitter, through which it acts on a photo-electric\ncell sensitive to invisible infra-red rays. The receiver amplifies it\nfor the observer.\n\n\nMOON ROCKETS\n\nSeventeen years of experimenting on a rocket designed by Prof. Albert\nH. Goddard of Clark University, to shriek its way from the earth to\nthe moon, came to a glorious climax recently in an isolated and\nclosely guarded section of Worcester when the rocket tore its flaming\nway through the air for a quarter-mile with a roar heard for a\ndistance of two miles.\n\nProf. Goddard said the rocket was shot out of its cradle, careened\nthrough the air a mass of flame, and landed about where it was\ndirected to land, beyond the Auburn town line. Test of a new\npropellant was the object of his demonstration, Prof. Goddard said.\n\nTwo or three times a week a small rocket goes up into the air a short\ndistance, not enough to attract great attention. But the latest was a\nnine-foot rocket, shot out of a forty-foot tower. Near the tower is a\nsafety post built of stone, with slits for peepholes. The experimental\nparty stepped into the safety zone when the rocket was started.\n\nThe forty-foot tower is built much like an oil well derrick. Inside it\nare two steel rails to fill grooves in the rocket. These guide the\nrocket much as rifling in a gun barrel guides a bullet. Prof. Goddard,\nwhen teaching at Princeton in 1912, evolved the idea of shooting a\nrocket to the moon by means of successive charges of explosive much as\nthe new German rocket motor racers are powered. In this most recent\nexperiment he used a new powder mixture.\n\nProf. Goddard issued a statement after the demonstration, which said:\n\n\"My test was one of a series of experiments with rockets using an\nentirely new propellant. There was no attempt to reach the moon or\nanything of such a spectacular nature. The rocket is normally noisy,\npossibly enough to attract considerable attention. The test was\nthoroughly satisfactory, nothing exploded in the air, and there was no\ndamage except possibly that incidental to landing.\"\n\n\n\n\nTerrors Unseen\n\n_By Harl Vincent_\n\n[Illustration: _\"Eddie!\" Lisa screamed suddenly. \"Look out!\"_]\n\n[Sidenote: One after another the invisible robots escape Shelton's\ncontrol--and their trail leads straight to the gangster chief\nCadorna.]\n\n\nSomething about the lonely figure of the girl caused Edward Vail to\nbring his car to a sudden stop at the side of the road. When first he\nhad glimpsed her off there on that narrow strip of rock-bound coast he\nwas mildly surprised, for it was a desolate spot and seldom frequented\nby bathers so late in the season. Now he was aroused to startled\nattention by the unnatural posture of the slender body that had just\nbeen erect and outlined sharply against the graying September sky. He\nswitched off the ignition and sprang to the ground.\n\nBent backward and twisted into the attitude of a contortionist, the\nlittle figure in the crimson bathing suit was a thing at which to\nmarvel. No human being could maintain that position without falling,\nyet the girl did not fall to the jagged stones that lay beneath her.\nShe was rigid, straining. Then suddenly her arm waved wildly and she\nscreamed, a wild gasping cry that died in her throat on a note of\ndespairing terror. It seemed that she struggled furiously with an\nunseen power for one horrible instant. Then the tortured body lurched\nviolently and collapsed in a pitiful quivering heap among the stones.\n\nEddie Vail was running now, miraculously picking his way over the\ntreacherous footing. The girl had fainted, no doubt of that, and\nsomething was seriously wrong with her.\n\nA mysterious mechanical something whizzed past; something that buzzed\nlike a thousand hornets and slithered over the rocks in a series of\nmetallic clanks. Then it was gone--or so it seemed in the confusion of\nEddie's mind; but he had seen nothing. Probably a fantasy of his\noverworked brain, or only the surf breaking against the sea wall. He\nturned his attention to the girl.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe was moaning and tossing her head, returning painfully to\nconsciousness. He straightened her limbs and placed his folded coat\nunder the restless head, noting with alarm that vicious red welts\nmarred the whiteness of her arms and shoulders. It was as if she had\nbeen beaten cruelly; those marks could never have resulted from her\nfall. Poor kid. Subject to fits of some sort, he presumed. She was a\ngood looker, too, and no mistake. He smoothed back the rumpled mass of\ngolden hair and studied her features. They were vaguely familiar.\n\nThen she opened her eyes. Stark terror looked out from their\nultra-marine depths, and her lips quivered as if she were about to\ncry. He raised her to a more comfortable position and supported her\nwith an encircling arm. She did cry a little, like a frightened child.\nThen, with startling abruptness, she sprang to her feet.\n\n\"Where is it?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Where's what?\" Eddie was on his feet, peering in all directions. He\nremembered the queer sounds he had heard or imagined.\n\n\"I--I don't know.\" The girl passed a trembling hand before her eyes as\nif to wipe away some horrifying vision. \"Perhaps it's my imagination,\nbut I felt--it was just as real--one of father's iron monsters.\nBeating me; bending me. I'd have snapped in a moment. But nothing was\nthere. I--I'm afraid....\"\n\nEddie caught her as she swayed on her feet. \"There now,\" he said\nsoothingly, \"you're all right, Miss Shelton. It's gone now, whatever\nit was.\" Iron monsters! In a flash it had come to him that this girl\nhe held in his arms was Lina Shelton, daughter of the robot wizard. No\nwonder she was afflicted with hallucinations! But those bruises were\nreal, as was the forcible twisting of her lithe young body. And he\n_had_ heard something.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You know me?\" The girl was calmer now and faced him with a surprised\nlook.\n\n\"Yes, Miss Shelton. At least I recognize you from the pictures.\nSociety page, you know. And I'm Edward Vail--Eddie for short--on\nvacation and at your service.\"\n\nThe girl smiled wanly. \"You know of father's break with Universal\nElectric? Of his private experiments?\"\n\n\"I heard of the scrap and of how he walked out on the outfit, but\nnothing further.\" Eddie thought grimly of how nearly he had come to\nlosing his own job when David Shelton broke relations with his\nemployers. He had been too enthusiastic in support of some of the\nolder man's claims.\n\n\"It's been terrible,\" the girl whispered. She clung nervously to his\narm as he picked the way back to the road. \"The loneliness, and all.\nNo servants will stay out here now, and father spends all of his time\nin the laboratory. Then--this fear of the mechanical men--they haunt\nme. I--I guess they've got me a little goofy.\"\n\nEddie laughed reassuringly. \"Perhaps,\" he suggested, \"you will let me\nhelp you. Your father, I believe, will remember me, and I'll be very\nglad to--\"\n\n\"No, no!\" The girl seemed frightened at the thought. \"I'm sure he\nwouldn't welcome you. He's changed greatly of late and is suspicious\nof everyone, even keeping things from me. But it's awfully nice of you\nto offer your assistance, and you've been a perfect peach to take care\nof me this way. I--I'd better go now.\"\n\nThey had reached the road and Eddie looked uncertainly at his\nroadster. He hated to think of leaving the girl in this lonely spot.\nShe was obviously in a state of extreme nervous tension and, to him,\nseemed pathetically helpless, and afraid.\n\n\"That the house?\" he asked, pointing in the direction of the gloomy\nold mansion whose dilapidated gables were barely visible over the tree\ntops.\n\n\"Yes.\" The girl shivered and drew closer to him.\n\nThe ensuing silence was broken by the slam of a door. His car! Eddie\nlooked toward it in amazement; he was hearing things again. The\nsprings sagged on the driver's side as under the weight of a very\nheavy occupant, but the seat was empty. Then came the whine of the\nstarter and the motor purred into life. The gears clashed sickeningly\nand the car was jerked into the road with a violence that should have\nstripped the differential. He pulled the girl aside just as it roared\npast and disappeared around the bend in a cloud of dust. The sound of\nthe exhaust died away rapidly and left them staring into each other's\neyes in awed silence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDavid Shelton was prowling around in the shrubbery when they\napproached the house--a furtive, unkempt creature whom Eddie would\nhardly have recognized. He straightened up and peered at his\ndaughter's companion with obvious disapproval.\n\n\"Lina,\" he said severely, \"I've told you we want no visitors.\"\n\n\"Yes, Dad, I know, but Mr. Vail's car was stolen out in front and\nthere is no way for him to go on. We must look after him.\"\n\n\"His car--stolen? Who stole it?\" David Shelton drew close and glared\nsuspiciously at his unwelcome visitor.\n\n\"One of your monsters, I think,\" she replied shakily, \"though we could\nsee nothing. And the same thing attacked me and beat me. Look at my\nbruises!\"\n\nShelton was examining the marks, and his fingers trembled as he\ntouched his daughter's shoulder. He looked piteously into her eyes.\n\"Are you sure, Lina? Sure? Did you see it?\"\n\n\"No, no. But I felt and heard--the iron arms and the clamps and the\nbuzzing. Oh, it was horrible!\" The girl's voice rose hysterically.\n\n\"Oh, Lord! What have I done?\" groaned Shelton. \"It's true, then. Lina,\nlisten: I've succeeded in making them invisible, and one got away this\nmorning. But I thought--I thought--\" He looked at Eddie, remembering\nhis presence suddenly. \"But I'm talking too much. It seems to me I\nremember having seen you before, young man.\"\n\n\"You have, sir,\" Eddie stated. \"In the research laboratory of\nUniversal Electric. I work with Borden.\"\n\n\"They've sent you to find me?\" Shelton stiffened perceptibly.\n\n\"Indeed, not, sir. I'm on vacation and was merely passing by when I\nsaw your daughter in danger, a danger I still do not understand.\"\n\n\"Yes, and he helped me to the road,\" Lina interposed, \"and then lost\nhis car at the hands of--\"\n\n\"Silence!\" the father thundered. But his eyes fell before the fire\nthat instantly flashed in those of the girl.\n\n\"Now, you listen to me!\" she returned angrily, \"I've stayed on here\nwith you until I'm nearly crazy with your everlasting puttering and\nexperimenting--hearing your uncanny machines walking around in the\nmiddle of the night--seeing impossible sights--then, this thing I\ncouldn't see but could feel. And you've gotten into such a state that\nyou'll go crazy yourself, if you continue. Something's got to be done,\nI tell you. I can't stand it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer voice broke on a choked sob.\n\n\"But Lina--\"\n\n\"Don't but me, Father. I mean it. Mr. Vail discovered your hideout\nquite by accident and he's been very nice to me. I tell you he means\nno harm and I want him to stay. If you're not decent to him, if you\nsend him away, I swear I'll go too. I will--I will!\"\n\nShelton's eyes misted and something of the hardness left his\nexpression. A look of haunting fear took its place and he stared\npleadingly at Eddie.\n\n\"Br-r! I'm cold!\" Lina exclaimed irrelevantly. \"And--and I believe I'm\ngoing to cry.\" She turned away and raced for the shelter of the gloomy\nold house without another word.\n\nEddie turned inquiring eyes on his unwilling host.\n\n\"Just like her mother before her,\" Shelton muttered softly. Then he\nfaced the younger man squarely and his shoulders straightened. \"Mr.\nVail,\" he said sheepishly, \"I've been a fool and I ask your pardon.\nBut Lina doesn't know. There's something tremendous behind all this,\nsomething that's gotten beyond me. I'll send her away for her own\nsafety, but I must stay on. If--if only there was someone I could\ntrust--\"\n\n\"You can trust me, sir,\" Eddie stated simply.\n\nThe older man paced the ground nervously, and Eddie could see that he\nwas under a most severe mental strain. Several times he halted in his\ntracks and peered anxiously at his guest. Then he seemed to make a\nsudden decision.\n\n\"Vail,\" he said sharply, \"I need help badly. I want you to stay, if\nyou will. You swear you'll not reveal what I am about to show you?\"\n\n\"I swear it, sir.\"\n\n\"You'll not report to Universal?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey surveyed each other appraisingly. Eddie was mystified by the\nhappenings of the day and was curious to learn more concerning these\nmythical invisible creations. It was inconceivable that the scientist\nhad spoken truly of his accomplishment. Yet, he had done some\nmarvelous things with Universal and, maybe--well, anyway, there was\nthe girl.\n\n\"Come with me,\" Shelton was saying: \"I believe you're a square\nshooter, Vail.\" He was leading the way along the gravel path at the\nside of the house. Before them loomed the squat brick building that\nwas the laboratory.\n\nThe door crashed open before Shelton's hand had reached the knob, and\none of those buzzing, unseen, monstrosities rushed clanking by,\nknocking the scientist from his feet in its passage. Ponderous,\nspeeding footsteps crunched the gravel of the path, and then, with a\nwild thrashing of the underbrush alongside, the thing was gone.\n\nEddie bent over the prostrate man and saw that he was unconscious. A\nthin trickle of blood ran from a cut in the side of his head.\n\n\"Lina! Lina!\" called Eddie frantically. For the first time in his life\nhe was genuinely frightened.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe half carried, half dragged the limp body through the door of the\nlaboratory and propped it in a chair. It required but a moment for him\nto see that Shelton's injury was inconsequential. He had only been\nstunned and already showed signs of recovering.\n\n\"What is it, Mr. Vail? What's happened?\" came the voice of Lina\nShelton breathlessly. She was framed in the doorway, dressed now and\npanting from her exertions in responding to his call. \"Oh, it's\nfather,\" she wailed, dropping to her knees at his side. \"He's been\nhurt. Badly, too.\"\n\n\"No, not badly, Miss Shelton. He'll be around in a minute. I'm sorry\nto have excited you, but when I called I feared it was worse than it\nis.\" He was washing the blood from her father's small wound as he\nspoke.\n\nShe took the basin from his hand, spilling some of the water in her\neagerness. \"Here, let me have that cloth,\" she demanded.\n\nEddie admired her as her deft fingers took up the task. She was as\nexquisite in a simple sport outfit as she had been in her bathing\nsuit.\n\nThe scientist opened his eyes after a moment. Remembrance came at once\nand he sat erect in the chair, staring.\n\n\"Lina!\" he exclaimed, grasping her hand conclusively. \"You're here,\nthank God! I dreamed--oh, it was horrible--I dreamed they had you.\" He\nclung to her closely.\n\n\"They?\" she murmured inquiringly.\n\n\"Yes. Two of them are loose now. It's danger for you, my dear. You\nmust leave at once. No, no--I can't let you out of my sight until they\nare captured or destroyed.\" He rose to his feet in his agitation and\nshook his head to clear it. He looked pleadingly at Eddie as if\nexpecting him to offer a solution of the difficulty.\n\n\"Vail!\" he exploded, then, pointing a shaking forefinger at an\nelaborate short-wave radio transmitter which occupied a corner of the\nlarge room. \"I ask you to bear witness. That is the source of energy\nfor these creations of mine and it's shut down. How on earth can they\nkeep going? I ask you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps someone else, sir,\" Eddie suggested doubtfully. \"Have you any\nenemies who might be able to duplicate the impulses of that\napparatus?\"\n\n\"Bah! Enemies, yes--with Universal--but none who could duplicate the\ncomplicated frequencies I use. My secrets are my own. I've never even\nput them on paper.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEddie was examining the intricate apparatus. \"You knew of the first\none's escape, didn't you?\" he asked. \"How did it happen?\"\n\nShelton again became the enthusiastic scientist. \"Here,\" he said,\n\"I'll show you and you can judge for yourself.\" He strode to the\ngleaming figure of a seven-foot robot of startlingly human-like\nappearance.\n\nLina let forth an exclamation of repugnance and fear.\n\n\"No, Mr. Shelton,\" Eddie objected. \"The same thing will occur again.\nThen there will be three.\"\n\n\"We'll fix that, my boy.\" The scientist was removing cover plates from\nthe hip joints of the mechanical man. \"I'll disconnect the cables that\nfeed the locomotors. He _can't_ walk then.\"\n\nEddie was still doubtful but dared offer no further objection,\nespecially since Lina Shelton was watching in wide-eyed silence. He\nexamined the monster and saw that it was quite similar in outside\nappearance to those supplied by Universal for heavy manual labor,\nexcepting that this one was armed as were those used for prison\nguards. There were the same articulated limbs and the various clamps\nand hooks for lifting and heavy hauling; the tentacles for grasping;\nmachine guns front and back. Under the helical headpiece that was the\nantenna this robot seemed to have two eyes--a new feature--but closer\nexamination showed these to be the twin lenses of a stereoscopic\nmotion picture camera. This robot, then, could see. Or at least it\ncould record what the lenses saw for its masters.\n\n\"There,\" Shelton grunted when he had finished his tinkering, \"he's\nparalyzed from the waist down. Let this one try and get away from us.\"\n\n\"Guns aren't loaded, are they?\" Eddie asked.\n\n\"Lord, no! Never have any of them loaded. That _would_ be a fool\nstunt.\" Shelton had pulled the starting handle of a motor-generator\nand its rising whine accompanied his words.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe vacuum tubes of the transmitter glowed into life and the scientist\nmanipulated the controls rapidly. Lina was watching the robot with\nfascinated awe. Its arms moved in obedience to the controls, tentacles\nwaved and coiled; the humming of its internal mechanisms filled the\nroom. The locomotion controls had no effect, as the scientist had\npredicted. Eddie drew a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Now, Vail, watch,\" Shelton exulted. \"I'll show you what I was doing\nwith the first one.\" He closed a switch that lighted another bank of\nvacuum tubes behind the control panel.\n\n\"You can make this one invisible?\" Eddie asked incredulously.\n\n\"Certainly--from the waist up. This ought to be good.\"\n\n\"Mind telling me the principle?\"\n\n\"Not at all--now. I've your promise of secrecy. It's a simple matter,\nVail, really. Just a problem of wave motions--light. Invisible light;\nthe ultra-violet, you know. My robots are built of specially alloyed\nmetals which permit great freedom of molecular vibration. The\ninsulating materials and even the glass of the camera lenses are\npossessed of the same property. Get it? I merely set up a wave motion\nin the atoms of the material that is in synchronism with the frequency\nof ultra-violet light, which is invisible to the human eye. All\nvisible colors are absorbed, or more accurately, none are reflected\nexcepting the ultra-violet. Perfect transparency is obtained since\nthere is neither refraction nor diffraction of the visible colors. And\nthere you are!\"\n\nEddie stared at the upper half of the robot and saw that it was\nchanging color as Shelton tuned the transmitted wave. Then suddenly it\nwas gone. The entire upper portion of the mechanism had vanished; had\njust snuffed out like the flame of a candle. He could see down into\nthe tops of the thing's hollow legs. Shelton laughed at him as he\nstretched forth his hand and hesitatingly felt for the invisible\nmid-section and upper body. It was there all right, unyielding and\ncold, that metal body. But no trace of it was visible to the eye. He\ndrew back his fingers as if they had touched a hot stove. The thing\nwas positively uncanny.\n\n\"Dad! Turn it off--please,\" Lina begged. \"It's getting on my nerves.\nPlease!\"\n\nObligingly, Shelton pulled the switch. \"Now you'll see,\" he said to\nEddie, \"whether the same thing happens. Watch.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMistily at first, the outlines of the monster's torso and arms came\ninto view, semi-transparent but clouding rapidly to opacity. Then it\nglinted with the barely visible violet, a solid once more, rigid and\nmotionless. It was a lifeless mechanism, for the source of its energy\nhad been cut off. Eddie had an almost irresistible impulse to pinch\nhimself.\n\nThen he gasped audibly, as did Shelton, for the thing snuffed out of\nsight again without warning, and the hum of its many motors resumed.\nThere came a terrific clanking as it waved arms and tentacles and\nviolently threshed with its upper body. But the visible portion, its\nlegs, remained rooted to the floor of the laboratory. Lucky it was\nthat the scientist had disconnected those wires; lucky too that the\nmachine guns were empty of ammunition.\n\n\"There now--see?\" Shelton's voice rose excitedly. \"It's been no fault\nof mine. The power is off but it moves--it moves. What on earth do you\nsuppose--\"\n\nEddie's shout interrupted him. He had seen something at the window: a\nface pressed against the pane and contorted with unutterable malice.\nThen it was gone. With the shout of warning still in his throat, Eddie\nbounded through the door in pursuit of the intruder. Lina's cry of\nrecognition followed him into the twilight. \"Carlos!\" she had called.\n\nHe saw a stocky figure slink around the corner of the laboratory and\nmake for the underbrush beyond. In a flash he was after him. No, he\nthought grimly, Shelton hadn't any enemy clever enough to duplicate\nhis transmitter! The hell he didn't! Who the devil was this fellow\nCarlos anyway? He tore savagely at the impeding branches as he plunged\ndeeper and deeper into the thicket.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a fruitless chase and Eddie soon retraced his steps to the\nlaboratory. Swell mess he'd gotten himself into! His car was gone:\nprobably wrapped around a tree by this time. And here was a situation\nthat spelled real danger, a thing with which Shelton was utterly\nunable to cope. As a matter of fact, he was so impractical--such a\nvisionary cuss, after the fashion of all geniuses--that he'd never be\nconvinced of the seriousness of the matter until it was too late. What\nto do? The girl was a corker, though, and game as they made 'em. Just\nthe sort a fellow could tie to....\n\nLina's firm clear voice came to him through the open door of the\nlaboratory. \"Dad,\" she was saying, \"why don't you give it up? Let's go\nback to New York where it is safe for you and for me. Let the things\ngo and forget about them. What do they amount to, after all? We've\nplenty of money and you already have earned enough fame to last the\nrest of your life. Come on now--please--for me.\"\n\n\"What do they amount to?\" Shelton reiterated, his voice rising\nquerulously. \"Lina, it's the most tremendous thing I've ever done.\nThink for a moment of what my robots could accomplish in the next war.\nAnd there'll be a next war as sure as you're alive. Think of it! No\nsending of our young manhood into the bloody fields of battle; no\nmanning of our air fleets with the cream of our youth; no bloodshed on\nour side whatsoever. Instead, these robots will fight the war. They'll\nfight other robots too, no doubt, but the property of invisibility\nwill be an invincible weapon. It will be a war that will end war once\nand for all. You can't--\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Father,\" the girl returned sharply. \"You've let your\nenthusiasm run away with your judgment. See what's happened\nalready?--someone's figured it out before you've even perfected the\nthing. An enemy of our country could do the same in wartime. Maybe\nit's a foreign spy who has done what's been done to-day.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEddie walked into the laboratory. \"Couldn't find him,\" he announced\nbriefly.\n\n\"No difference,\" said Shelton. \"He doesn't count in this. We called to\nyou when you rushed out, but couldn't make you hear.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\" Eddie asked shortly. What he had overheard made him more\nthan ever impatient with the older man. So clever and yet so dense,\nShelton was.\n\nLina avoided his gaze.\n\n\"Only Carlos--Carlos Savarino,\" said Shelton, carelessly, \"a Chilean,\nI think. He worked for me for two months during the summer and I fired\nhim for getting fresh with Lina. Good mechanic, but dumb as an ox. Had\nto tell him every little detail when he was doing something in the\nshop. I'd have saved time if I'd done it myself.\"\n\nThe girl looked at Eddie squarely now. She was flushing hotly. \"And I\nhorsewhipped him,\" she added.\n\n\"Yes,\" Shelton laughed; \"it was rich. He sneaked away like a whipped\npuppy, and this is the first time we've seen him since.\"\n\nEddie whistled. \"And you think he doesn't count in this?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course not. Too dumb, I tell you. Doesn't know the first\nprinciples of science. He thinks the only wave motion is that of the\nocean.\" Shelton chuckled over his own jest.\n\n\"I wouldn't be too sure,\" Eddie snapped. \"And I want to tell you\nsomething, Mr. Shelton. Through no fault of my own, I heard some of\nyour conversation with Li--with your daughter, before I returned here.\nI was puzzled over your reasons for working so absorbedly on this\nthing, but now I know them and I think you're wasting your time and\nkeeping your daughter in needless danger.\"\n\n\"You dare talk to me like this!\" Shelton roared.\n\n\"I do, sir, and you'll thank me later.\" Eddie returned the older man's\nglare with one equally savage.\n\nLina's gurgle of laughter broke the tension. \"He's right, Dad, and you\nknow it,\" she interposed. \"Let him finish.\"\n\nEddie needed no such encouragement, though it warmed his heart. And\nShelton listened respectfully when he continued, \"I'm into this now,\nsir, and I intend to see it through to the end. I'll keep your secret,\ntoo, though I doubt if it'll ever be of much value to you. Know what I\nthink? I think this Carlos is a damn clever fellow instead of the ass\nyou took him to be. He probably just pretended he was ignorant of\nscience. Why shouldn't he? That way he got a liberal education from\nyou in the very things he wanted to find out. Since you tied the can\nto him he's had plenty of chances to build a duplicate of your control\napparatus--with the aid of some foreign government, no doubt--and now\nthey've stolen two of your machines to complete the job. Your secret\nalready is out and in the very hands you've tried to keep it from.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShelton paled visibly as Eddie talked. \"But--but how--\" he stammered.\n\n\"How should I know how they did it?\" the younger man countered.\n\"Here--let's take a look around. I'll bet they've left their trail\nright here in this room.\"\n\nHe walked from one end of the laboratory to the other, peering into\ncorners and under work benches as he passed. Shelton trailed him like\na shadow, squinting through the square lenses of his spectacles.\n\nThey carefully avoided the partially invisible robot, for the humming\nof its upper motors continued and clanking sounds occasionally issued\nfrom the unseen upper portion. The enemies of David Shelton were still\nat work on their hidden controls.\n\n\"Here--what's this?\" Eddie exclaimed suddenly, pointing out a glinting\nobject in a dark corner of the laboratory.\n\nShelton examined it closely, looking over his shoulder. The object he\nhad located seemed to be a mounted and hooded lens, a highly polished\nglass of about two inches diameter with its mounting attached rigidly\nto the wall.\n\n\"Never saw that before,\" Shelton stated with conviction. \"And--why--it\nlooks like an objective such as those used in the latest automatic\ntelevision transmitters.\"\n\n\"Just what it is,\" Eddie grunted. He picked up a pinch bar from a\nnearby tool rack and drove its end through the glass as he spoke the\nwords.\n\nA violent wrench tore the thing loose and broke away a section of the\nthin plastered wall. There, in the cleverly concealed cavity behind,\nwas revealed the mechanism of the radio \"eye.\" Somewhere, someone bad\nbeen watching their every move. And abruptly the thrashings of the\nrobot ceased and its upper portion again became visible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well,\" said David Shelton. \"Well! Looks as if you're right, young\nman. I'm astonished.\" His watery eyes looked sheepishly over the rims\nof his glasses.\n\nLina watched their every move. She seemed to sense the seriousness of\nthe situation far more than did her father.\n\nThen the lights went out. It had darkened to night outside and the\nblackness and silence in the laboratory was like that of a tomb.\n\n\"They've cut the wires,\" Eddie whispered hoarsely. \"Got any weapons\nhere, Shelton?\"\n\n\"Yes. A couple of automatics. I'll get them.\" The scientist was no\ncoward, anyway. His whispered words came calmly through the silence.\n\nEddie heard him shuffle a few steps and fumble with a drawer of the\ndesk. In a moment the cold hard butt of a pistol was thrust into his\nhand. It had a comforting feel.\n\n\"Stay here with Lina,\" he commanded. \"I'll go out and see if I can\nfind them. This looks nasty to me.\"\n\n\"No,\" came the girl's voice, \"I'm going too.\"\n\n\"You are not,\" Eddie hissed. \"You'll stay here or I'll know the\nreason. It's dark as a pocket outside and my eyes are as good as\ntheirs. I'll get 'em if they're around here. You hear me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she whispered meekly.\n\nEdward Vail, only that morning headed for rest and quiet, was now out\nin the night, stalking an unknown and vicious enemy. And--for what? As\nhe asked himself the question, the smile of Lina seemed to answer him\nfrom the blackness. Cherchez la femme! He was getting dotty as he\nneared his thirties. Maybe it was the hard work that had affected his\nmind.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe black hulk of the old house loomed against the scarcely less dark\nsky. There was no moon, and in only one tiny portion of the heavens\nwere the stars visible. Mighty few of them at that. The swish-swish of\nthe surf came to his ears faintly. Or was it someone creeping along\nthe wall of the house? He held his breath and waited.\n\nThey wouldn't use the robots at night. Couldn't follow their movements\nin the teleview, if such an attachment had been built into their\ncontrol transmitter. No, the devils would be here in person.\n\nA muttered Teutonic curse sounded close at hand. That wouldn't be\nCarlos. God! Were the heinies mixed up in this thing? Just like 'em to\nbe swiping a new war machine; but hadn't they gotten enough in 1944?\nWithout warning he was catapulted from his feet by the impact of a\nheavy body. He struck the ground so violently that the pistol was\njarred from his hand. Disarmed before the fight had started!\n\nThen he was rolling over and over, battling desperately with an\nassailant who was much larger and heavier than himself. He was dazed\nand weakened from his initial dive to the hard ground. All rules of\nboxing and wrestling were forgotten. Biting, kicking, gouging, all\nwere the same to this silent and powerful antagonist. It was\ncatch-as-catch-can in the darkness, and mostly the other fellow could\nand did. He had a grip like the clamp of a robot. Trying to dig out\none of his eyes? Eddie saw stars--and lashed out with all his might,\nhis flying fists playing a tattoo on the others ribs. Short arm jabs\nthat brought grunts of agony from his big assailant. Try to blind him,\nwould he?\n\nEddie somehow managed to get on top; his clutching fingers found the\nother's collar. Then he let loose with terrific rights and lefts that\nsmacked home to head and face. Those outlanders don't like the good\nold American fist, and Eddie had room to bring them in from way back,\nnow. The fellow had ceased struggling and Eddie's hands were getting\nslippery. Blood! Must be, for the stuff was warm and sticky. He rested\nfor a moment, breathing heavily. The other was quiet beneath\nhim--knocked cold. He staggered to his feet triumphantly; wondered how\nmany more of them there were.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked around in the darkness, straining his eyes in vain to pierce\nits thick veil. There was a glimmer of light over there, through a\nwindow. The laboratory! The light flickered a second and vanished. A\ncold fear gripped him and he stumbled through the grounds blindly,\nfinally colliding painfully with the brick wall. He felt his way\ntoward the door, or where he thought it should be.\n\nHe dared not call out for fear the others would hear. Where was that\ndamned door? He rested again and listened. Not a sound was to be\nheard from within or without. He clawed his way frantically along the\nunsympathetic wall. It was a mile wide, that laboratory of Shelton's.\nAh--at last! Weakly, he staggered within.\n\n\"Lina!\" he whispered, \"Lina! Shelton!\"\n\nThere was no reply. He fumbled for a match. Funny how slowly his mind\nworked ... thoughts coming jerkily like a sound film running at quarter\nspeed ... fingers shaking so he could scarcely strike a light. The flare\nshowed the laboratory empty of human beings ... Lina gone ... that crazy\nrobot ... quiet now, and visible ... but grinning at him ... then\ndarkness....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat a headache! Eddie rolled over and groaned. Astounded by the\nhardness of his bed and the stiffness of his joints, he roused to\ninstant wakefulness; sat up and stared. Where the devil was he? The\nlaboratory--Shelton's--Lina. He jumped to his feet. Dawn was breaking\nand its first faint radiance lighted the robot with eery shifting\ncolors. He berated himself: he'd passed out.\n\nHe dashed through the door and made a wild circuit of the grounds.\nEmpty! No--there was his automatic, where it had fallen. Blood stains\non the grass showed where the encounter had taken place last night.\nMust have smashed the Dutchman's nose. But he was gone. Everybody was\ngone. He rushed into the house and from room to room, upstairs and\ndown. The place was deserted.\n\nThis was something to think about. Not an automobile around, no\nneighbors, not even a telephone. When Shelton went into seclusion, he\ndid it thoroughly. Eddie returned to the laboratory and hunched\nhimself in the scientist's chair. Maybe he could think better here.\n\nThey had Shelton and his daughter, all right. Kidnapped them. There\nwas probably some detail of his discovery they couldn't dope out, and\nhad decided to force him into telling them. The devils would use\nLina's safety as a threat to force him into anything. Horrible, that\nthought. And Carlos already had made advances to her.\n\nStartled by a sharp click, he turned around. The robot was whirring\ninto life. Fast workers, whoever Shelton's enemies were, and up early!\nHe found the pinch bar with which he had wrecked the television\napparatus and, with a few mighty blows, destroyed the antenna and\nheadpiece of the mechanical man. They'd not pull off any devilment\nwith this one, anyway.\n\nA wave meter on one of the benches attracted his attention and he\ntwirled its knob. It gave strong indication at one and a half meters.\nThe wave length of their control transmitter! If only he could\nfind--but there it was: a direction finder. Hastily, he lighted its\ntubes and tuned to the frequency shown by the meter. He rotated the\nloop over the compass dial and carefully noted maximum and minimum\nsignals. He had a line on the transmitter! And it must be close by,\nfor the intensity of the carrier wave was tremendous.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlipping the automatic into his pocket, he left the laboratory and\nstruck out through the underbrush in the direction Carlos had taken\nthe day before. Fighting his way through the tangled shrubbery, he\nkept his eyes constantly on the needle of the magnetic compass he had\nwrenched from the direction finder. It was tough going through the\nthicket, and just as bad across a swampy clearing where he was mired\nto the knees before he got across. Up the hill and into the woods he\nforged, keeping doggedly to the direction he had determined. This was\nrough country, less than a hundred miles from New York but\nuncultivated and unsettled excepting for the few summer places along\nthe shore. He'd heard that these backwoods were infested with\nrum-runners and hijackers, a cutthroat gang.\n\nThere was a cabin off there through the trees, almost on the line he\nwas following. Must be what he was looking for. He advanced\ncautiously, creeping stealthily from tree to tree.\n\nVoices came to his ears, and the throb of a motor-generator. It was\nthe place, all right. He crept closer, and, circling the house, saw\nthat an almost impassable road led to it from the rear. A heavy\nlimousine was parked there in the trees, and another car, a yellow\nroadster--his own. A feeling of grim satisfaction was quickly\ndispelled by the sound of a familiar humming. Within a foot of his\near, it seemed to be, and instinctively he ducked.\n\nClick! A powerful clamp had fastened itself to his wrist. One of\nShelton's invisible robots! He struck blindly at the unseen monster\nand was rewarded by a shooting pain up his wrist as one of his\nknuckles was driven backward by the impact with the hard metal. Bands\nof writhing metal encompassed his body, pinning his arms to his side\nand lifting him bodily from the ground. There he hung, kicking and\nstruggling in mid-air, supported by nothing he could see. He closed\nhis eyes and felt of the thing that held him. Cold, hard metal it\nwas--implacable and unyielding.\n\nClank, clank. The monster was walking with long, jerky strides. The\npressure against his ribs brought a gasp of agony from his lips. Each\njarring step was an individual and excruciating torture. His breath\nwas cut off by the relentless constriction of one of the tentacles\nwhich now encircled his neck. It wouldn't be long now.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen, when everything had turned black and he had given up hope, he\nwas dumped unceremoniously on the hard floor of the cabin. A harsh\nlaugh greeted him as he struggled weakly to his knees.\n\n\"Thought you could put one over on Al Cadorna, did you?\" a voice\nrasped.\n\nThe room spun round as he tried to regain his feet. A mist swam\nbefore his eyes. Al Cadorna! The most picturesque figure in gangland.\nCredited with a dozen killings and with ill-gotten wealth untold, this\nleader of the underworld openly boasted that the police had never\ngotten anything on him. And they hadn't. So it was a criminal who had\nlaid hands on Shelton's robots, not a foreign spy. Worse and worse. He\nthought of what they might be able to do with these invisible\nmechanical things: make gunmen out of them; safe blowers; house\nbreakers. Why, society would be at their mercy; banks defenceless; the\nmints, even--\n\n\"Stand up on your pins, you worm! Let's have a look at you!\" The\nmuzzle of an automatic was thrust in his abdomen, prodding\ninsistently. Things stabilized in the room and he looked up into the\ncruelest face he had ever seen, and recognizable from the many\npictures which had appeared in the yellow press.\n\nEddie took in the surroundings at a glance. He was in a low-ceilinged\nroom that was almost unfurnished. In one corner there was a replica of\nShelton's robot control, teleview disc and all. Carlos had just pulled\nthe switch and the robot was taking visible form. The man who prodded\nhim with the automatic was Cadorna, no doubt of that. His evil leer\nand yellow eyes marked him at once. The other occupant of the room was\na big square-built man with a patch over one eye and strips of\nadhesive tape across his nose--his antagonist of the night before.\nMust have sneaked off after he came to; it was safer to send one of\nthe robots after the _verdammt Amerikaner_. Eddie restrained a chuckle\nat the thought.\n\n\"Nothing to laugh at, kid!\" Cadorna snarled. \"You're goin' for a nice\nlong ride pretty quick. Know that?\"\n\nEddie's head was clearing rapidly, but he pretended to sway on his\nfeet. Lina and her father were not in sight. If only he could spar for\na little time.\n\n\"What's the idea?\" he asked. \"Haven't you guys got enough?\"\n\n\"That's our business. We know what we're doin', and when you butted in\nyou just signed your own papers. Dead men don't talk, you know, kid!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a door at the other side of the room. If only he could see\nwhether Lina was in there; whether she was alive.\n\n\"Tie him up, Gus!\" Cadorna kept the pistol pressed into the pit of\nEddie's stomach as he gave the order. \"Hands and feet--and make it a\ngood job, you wiener.\"\n\nEddie shouted then. \"Lina!\" Resistance was useless, but it would give\nhim some satisfaction to know she still lived even though Cadorna\npulled that trigger in the next instant. No reply came from beyond\nthat door.\n\n\"So!\" Cadorna grinned maliciously. \"Another victim! Carlos first, then\nyou, and now--Al Cadorna. If you're worrying about her, kid, you\nneedn't. She'll be perfectly safe with me.\"\n\nEddie's roar of rage shook the rafters. Heedless of consequences, he\nbrought his knee up suddenly and violently. Cadorna sank to the floor\nwith a groan, his pistol clattering harmlessly on the rough planks. In\na flash Eddie retrieved it, dropping behind the prostrate form of the\nstricken gangster. Gus had fired and missed. Now he dared not shoot\nfor fear of hitting his chief. Eddie's gun spat fire and the big\nGerman clapped his hands over his heart, his good eye widening in\nsurprise. Then he reeled and pitched forward on his face. A feminine\ncry sounded from the adjoining room and Eddie's heart skipped a beat\nwhen he heard it.\n\nCarlos was padding across the floor, trying to get into a position\nwhere he could fire without endangering Cadorna. Eddie swung his\npistol around and pulled the trigger. A miss! He fired again, but too\nlate. Fingers of steel had gripped his wrist and the king of gangland\nrolled over on him, twisting the gun from his hand. Clubbed now, the\npistol was raised high over that distorted, malicious face. Eddie\ntried to twist away from under the blow as it started its downward\nswing, then a thousand steam hammers hit him all at once and ...\nblackness....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomething was pounding insistently at the doors of his consciousness.\nHe must pull himself together! They'd left him for dead and he\nwas--almost. But voices as loud and raucous as those would waken the\ndead. He groaned with pain when he attempted to move his head.\n\n\"That for you, you rat.\" It was Cadorna's voice. \"Try to take my\nwoman, will you?\"\n\nThe pounding resolved itself into the angry barking of an automatic.\nSomeone squealed with mortal agony. Eddie opened his eyes cautiously\nand saw that the room was full of people. The pungent odor of burned\npowder assailed his nostrils. There was Cadorna and Carlos, David\nShelton and Lina. An undersized, dapper youth stood over the body of\nthe big German, his hands outstretched before his horror-stricken\nface. A moment he stood thus, like a statue. Then his knees gave way\nbeneath him and he crumpled into a grotesque heap beside the man who\nhad been called Gus. Such was the manner of Cadorna's dealing with\nthose who displeased him.\n\nThe door to the adjoining room was open. Lina and her father had been\nkept in there, with the little thug as their guard. Evidently Cadorna\nhad caught him trying to force his attentions on the girl. Good thing\nhe'd killed him.\n\nLina was sobbing and the sound brought increased agony to the helpless\nEddie. He lay still where they had placed him, beside the table which\nsupported the robot control apparatus. His cheek was against the floor\nand he saw that a little pool of blood was forming there, blood drawn\nby the butt of Cadorna's pistol when it contacted with his skull. He\nwas bound hand and foot. They hadn't thought him dead, after all.\nKeeping him for that ride and a watery grave. Couldn't afford to leave\nhis body around where it might be found.\n\n\"What are you going to do with us?\" Shelton was asking, his voice\nbravely defiant. Game old sport at that, he was.\n\n\"Don't fret over your daughter. Al Cadorna's her protector now, and\nshe'll be taken care of better'n she's ever been. But you--that's\nsomethin' else again. First off, you're goin' to give Carlos the dope\non these trick metals in your machines. He couldn't analyze 'em, or\nwhatever you call it. Then you're goin' to have a nice long ride with\nyour friend over there.\"\n\n\"You'll go to the chair for this, Cadorna. And I'll never tell you the\nsecret of the alloys.\"\n\n\"Tell him, Dad,\" Lina was crying. \"He'll let us go if you do.\"\n\n\"The hell I will, girlie. What I said, goes. We'll make him talk\nfirst, too,\" Cadorna snarled.\n\n\"Never!\" Shelton shouted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLina had seen Eddie and, with a little cry, she bounded across the\nroom. Carlos was after her like a panther.\n\n\"Hands off that dame!\" Cadorna yelled. \"Let her cry over the boy\nfriend if she wants to. Won't do her any good. You get busy and set\none of the tin soldiers goin'. Make the old buzzard talk.\"\n\nCarlos muttered sullenly as he started the motor-generator. Give him a\nchance and he'd knife Cadorna in the back--for Lina.\n\nThe girl was kneeling at Eddie's side now, examining his bleeding\nscalp. He opened one eye and gazed at her solemnly, pursing his lips\nin a warning to silence. She caught her breath and nodded in\nunderstanding.\n\nCadorna was shouting like a madman. \"Keep the damn thing so I can see\nit, you spig! They make me bug-house when you blink 'em off. Besides,\nI don't trust you.\"\n\nThe bold Cadorna was afraid of something he couldn't see! An idea\nflashed across Eddie's quickening mind. But he was helpless--bound so\ntightly that the cords cut his wrists.\n\nOne of the robots was clanking across the room. Lina looked up in\nmomentary terror and Eddie saw her eyes stray over the table top where\nCarlos was working.\n\n\"Want to grab the old one?\" the Chilean called.\n\n\"Yes. Pick him up and squeeze him till his ribs crack. He'll talk.\"\n\nLina let a little moan escape her lips. Eddie was watching as the iron\nmonster approached the scientist and flung its tentacles around his\nmadly struggling form. Lina was fussing with him, trying to turn him\nover. Cadorna's back was to them, his face thrust into that of\nShelton, who was fighting desperately to avoid the crushing grip of\nthe robot.\n\n\"Give him a squeeze, Carlos.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShelton's yell brought another low moan from the girl's set lips. She\nwas working furiously at Eddie's bonds. Lord, she had a knife! Good\ngirl! Must have found it on the table. His hands were free and he\nwriggled his fingers to bring them to life. Then his feet. He was able\nto move. Lina whispered in his ear.\n\n\"All right?\" she asked anxiously.\n\n\"Yes,\" he whispered. Somehow their lips touched and Eddie felt his\nheart pound at his temples. New life came to him with a rush of\nexaltation.\n\nShelton was crying out in pain and Lina sprang to her feet. \"You\nbeast!\" she shouted at Cadorna. \"Let him go.\"\n\nThen she was across the room, tearing at the unyielding metal bands\nthat pinioned her father and slowly crushed him. Cadorna laughed\nmirthlessly.\n\n\"Tell him to give me the dope,\" he retorted. \"Then I'll let him\ngo--for a while.\"\n\nShelton's head hung on his chest, rolling weakly from side to side.\nEddie doubted whether he could speak if he wished to. The Chilean was\nworking at the controls, increasing the tension of those terrible\ntentacles. Eddie raised himself to his knees, watching Cadorna\nnarrowly. He fingered the knife Lina had used in freeing him. No, he\ncouldn't use that. The Chilean would cry out and queer everything. He\nlaid it on the floor, within easy reach.\n\nCadorna was cursing now, first Shelton and then the girl. His rage was\nmaniacal. \"Another notch!\" he bellowed.\n\nEddie rose silently and clamped his fingers on the Chilean's windpipe.\nLina's eyes widened as she saw. She did everything in her power to\nkeep Cadorna's attention occupied as Eddie sunk those fingers into\nCarlos' throat. The Chilean's eyes popped from his head as he\nstruggled furiously to tear away the steel-sinewed hand that had\nstopped off his breath. Death was staring him in the face, and he\ncould not cry out. His strength left suddenly as the fingers dug in\ndeeper, and Eddie shook him as he would a rat. In a surprisingly short\ntime he had slumped to the floor, and not until his squirmings ceased\ndid Eddie loose that awful grip.\n\n\"Another notch, you spiggoty!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEddie bent over the controls. Lina's pleadings mingled with the curses\nof Cadorna. She was cajoling now--telling the brute she'd go with him\ngladly if only he'd free her father; promising anything, everything,\nin the desperate attempt to keep him from discovering that his last\nhenchman was out of the picture. But her words served only to spur\nEddie to swifter action. He twirled the knobs of the dual control. The\nsecond robot was fading from view. He'd give Cadorna a dose of the\nthing he really feared. He eased off a little on the other control,\nreleasing the pressure on poor Shelton's ribs as much as he dared.\n\nThe position indicator of the second robot moved slightly as Eddie\nstarted the invisible monster toward the yelling gangster. He watched\nthe screen closely. It was quite a trick, at that, controlling these\nthings you couldn't see. All you had to go by were these sketchy\nrepresentations in the teleview; tiny flecks of light that outlined\nthe various movable members of the robot.\n\n\"Eddie!\" Lina screamed suddenly. \"Look out!\"\n\nBut he had seen Cadorna wheel around as he watched his image on the\nscreen. At that moment a tentacle was writhing its way around his\nthick neck. A bullet whistled past Eddie's ear and buried itself\nharmlessly in the wall.\n\nThen from the blasphemous mouth of the king of gangland there came a\nshriek of awful fear. The tightening tentacle shut it off in a choking\ngurgle. Cadorna was captured at last--by a monster he could not see, a\nmonster that struck terror to his craven soul.\n\nIt was the work of but a moment to free David Shelton from the grip of\nthe other robot. The tortured man tottered into Lina's arms for\nsupport.\n\nEddie played with Cadorna now, releasing the grip from his throat and\npinioning his arms instead. With rapid fingers he manipulated the\ncontrols until the screaming gangster was raised high in the air by\nthe unseen arms of the robot.\n\n\"Another notch, Al,\" he chortled.\n\nCadorna yelled anew as the clamps tightened, \"For God's sake, kid,\nquit it! Let me down. I'll do anything you say.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" Eddie moved one of the rheostat knobs a trifle.\n\nThe prince of racketeers was whimpering now, like a baby. The sharp\nsnap of a rib punctured his outcries.\n\n\"Another notch,\" said Eddie grimly.\n\nBut the king of the underworld had fainted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour later Eddie Vail surveyed the scene complacently. Lina had\nwashed the blood from his head and face and bandaged his wound.\nLuckily, Cardorna's blow had been a glancing one. The girl was fussing\nover her father, now, and the scientist was on the point of resenting\nher attentions; swore he could take care of himself; he wasn't a baby.\nCarlos and his chief were trussed up like mummies, and had been\nsnarling at each other ever since the Chilean recovered his senses,\neach blaming the other for their predicament. The robots stood\nmotionless by the wall.\n\nThis would be a big haul for the police. Plenty of evidence to send\nCadorna to the chair now. The murder of Butch Collins, the undersized\nthug, had been witnessed by three of them. No, four: Carlos would\nsqueal. He was that kind. There would be rejoicing in the underworld\ntoo, for Cadorna had many enemies. They'd be killing each other off in\ndroves though, for the leaders of rival gangs would be battling for\nhis place.\n\n\"Guess we'll have to dump them in the limousine,\" he remarked to\nShelton. \"Drive them to the nearest town and turn them over to the\nauthorities.\"\n\n\"Yes. Then they can come back for the bodies of the other two.\"\nShelton grimaced as he contemplated the sprawled figures.\n\n\"What about your robots?\" Eddie asked.\n\n\"Why, I'll go ahead with my original plans, of course.\" The scientist\nlooked surprised.\n\n\"Dad!\" Lina turned beseeching eyes on Eddie and his heart performed\namazingly as he looked into their depths.\n\n\"And why not?\" asked her father dolefully. \"They'll insure the peace\nof the world. They'll--\"\n\n\"Listen, Mr. Shelton,\" Eddie interrupted. \"If you'll think a little\nyou'll realize that they'll do no such thing. Has any new and terrible\nengine of destruction ever accomplished that result? No--the enemy\nalways finds a way of combating the new weapon and of devising another\nstill more terrible. You've discovered a marvelous thing, but its\nvalue is quite problematical.\"\n\n\"How can they ever combat a thing they cannot see?\"\n\n\"Easily. Why, I could devise a teleview attachment in two days that\nwould make them visible. Photo-electric cells are capable of detecting\nultra-violet light as you well know. Radium glows under its rays. Why\nnot coat a teleview screen with some radio-active material?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShelton frowned thoughtfully. \"You're right. Vail,\" he said, after a\nmoment of silence; \"absolutely right. It was only a dream.\"\n\nWith dragging feet he walked to the transmitter, his expression grim\nin the realization of failure. He started the motor-generator with a\ngesture of finality.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" Eddie asked fearfully.\n\n\"Watch me! At least I can demonstrate another phase of the basic\nprinciple I have discovered.\"\n\nThe motors of both robots whirred.\n\n\"Don't!\" Cadorna wailed. \"For God's sake, don't blink 'em out!\"\n\nCarlos cursed his chief for a coward.\n\nShelton was talking rapidly as he manipulated the controls. Instead of\nbuilding up the wave motion to the frequency of invisible light he was\nreducing it. Past the other end of the spectrum and into the\ninfra-red. The heat ray! Both monsters were changing color as he\nmarched them through the door and into the open. But now they glowed\nwith a visible red that rapidly intensified to the dazzling whiteness\nof intense heat. Cadorna babbled in superstitious terror. Then, in an\ninstant, both mechanisms were reduced to shapeless blobs of molten\nmetal. Lina clapped her hands gleefully.\n\nShelton looked up with enthusiasm once more shining in his face.\n\"Vail, my boy,\" he said, \"we can find some use for that in industry.\nLet the next war take care of itself.\"\n\n\"You bet!\" Eddie was lost in contemplation of the girl--the flush of\npleasure that came at her father's words; the shining eyes.\n\n\"Then you'll leave the old place down here?\" she asked eagerly.\n\n\"Yes, as soon as we get rid of these crooks and the other robot. Vail\nis to spend the rest of his vacation with us, too--if he will.\"\n\nWould he? Eddie gazed at the girl in rapt admiration and with an\ninward thrill over his astounding good fortune. Her eyes dropped\nbefore the intensity in his and her flush heightened.\n\nDavid Shelton was wiping his glasses and peering at them with an\nunderstanding smile. Good sport, Shelton--and in some ways as wise as\nthey made them. Eddie waited breathlessly for the girl to speak.\n\n\"Oh, that's wonderful, Dad,\" she approved; \"and I'm sure that Mr. Vail\nwill agree.\"\n\nShe turned those glorious eyes on Eddie once more and her inquiring\nsmile spoke volumes. He opened his mouth to accept the invitation but\nthe words would not come. He could only nod his head vigorously like\nan abashed schoolboy.\n\nSome vacation!\n\n[Illustration: Advertisement.]\n\n\n\n\nPhalanxes of Atlans\n\n_By F. V. W. Mason_\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWHAT HAS GONE BEFORE\n\n[Illustration: _Yes, there came a strange, but welcome sight._]\n\n[Sidenote: Never did an aviator ride a more amazing sky-steed than\nAlden on his desperate dash to the great Jarmuthian Ziggurat.]\n\n\nVictor Nelson and Richard Alden are forced down on a flight over an\nunexplored Arctic region. Returning from a hunt for food, Nelson finds\nhis companion gone; but many footprints and blood splashes establish a\nclear trail to a tunnel, passing beneath a range of very high\nmountains on the edge of the unexplored area. In following the trail,\nNelson encounters and slays an allosaurus, a terrible, carnivorous\nspecies of dinosaur surviving from the Cretaceous era.\n\nThen he presses on to presently emerge in an almost tropical valley\nand encounter a remnant of the long lost Atlantean race, who are ruled\nby a dynasty of English-speaking kings--descendants of Sir Henry\nHudson, who had wandered into Atlans after being abandoned by his men.\n\nThis valley in the Arctic owes its existence to the thinness of the\nearth's crust, which permits the interior heat to warm the surface.\n\nThe Atlanteans are on the verge of war with another race, the\nJarmuthians, descended from the Lost Tribes of Israel, when Nelson is\ntransported to Heliopolis, the Atlantean Capital, for trial. All\nstrangers must prove their value to the State or be condemned to feed\nthe war monsters.\n\nNelson soon discovers that Alden had been captured from the Atlanteans\nby the Jarmuthians. He strikes a bargain with Altorius, Emperor of\nAtlans. He will undertake to fight any six of the enemy on condition\nhe and Alden will be released if successful.\n\nAltorius agrees to Nelson's suggestion and makes a proposal to the\nJarmuthians. Heretofore he had been paying them an annual tribute of\nsix maidens, as price for the safety of Altara, Sacred Virgin of\nAtlans, whom Jarmuth had captured in a previous war. With Nelson's\nbargain in mind he offers an increase of six maidens to the annual\ntribute, if the American fails to defeat six Jarmuthian champions. On\nthe other hand, if Nelson wins, all tribute will cease, Altara will\nnot be sacrificed, and Alden is to be returned unharmed.\n\nOn a dueling ground between the rival armies Nelson, armed with his\nWinchester rifle, sallies out to battle with the enemy, who, on their\nside, are armed with retortii--curious weapons hurling live\nsteam--fungus bombs, swords and lances.\n\nThe tricky Jarmuthians, however, mount their men on a diplodocus, a\nhuge dinosaur some eighty-seven feet in length. All seems lost; but by\nblinding the colossal creature, Nelson destroys its usefulness, and\none by one kills the six Jarmuthians.\n\nStung with rage, the enemy disregard the terms of the contest and\nattack with their whole army. They are, however, defeated, and the\nconquered Jarmuthians sullenly turn over Alden and the captive\nmaidens; though Altara still remains in their possession.\n\nAfter making much of the Americans, Altorius reluctantly allows his\npreservers to depart for their plane--unconscious that the priestly\nparty is planning rebellion against his authority because he did not\ninsist on Altara's return.\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\"That's one of the fixed retortiis I was speaking about,\" remarked\nVictor Nelson as he paused to point out a tapering brass tube which\nwas mounted on a platform above the long staircase up which he and\nAlden were toiling. \"It's a big brute: see how small the gunners look\nbeside it? These steam guns are wonderful things.\"\n\nThe younger aviator sighed. \"I've had enough of miracles,\" he said\nwiping his flushed features and hitching a small pack higher on his\nleather-clad shoulders. \"All I want to do is to lay my weary eyes on\nthe plane again. What with these ghastly allosauri, diplodocuses and\nother monsters, I'm damn well fed up with this place.\"\n\nNelson settled his Winchester rifle more comfortably into the hollow\nof his arm. \"Correct. So am I. But we can't say Altorius didn't do\nright by our Nell. Good Lord, what a triumph he gave us!\" The dark\npilot's smile flashed from beneath his neat, close-clipped black\nmustache. \"Wait till Cartier gets a peep at those diamonds he gave\nus.\"\n\nPanting, the two halted by mutual consent. \"Ever see so many stairs?\"\ngrunted Nelson. \"Three more flights and we'll be into the tunnel; ah,\nthere's the opening. I only hope these blighters haven't hurt the\nplane.\"\n\nBefore resuming the climb Nelson shifted his rifle, idly regarding the\narmored gunners just above; then suddenly he stiffened his wiry body\nwith a sharp cry. \"Look out, Dick! What the devil? Those damn fools\nahead are swinging the retortii across our--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dark haired aviator's words were drowned out in a deafening,\nhissing roar that burst from the great retortii's throat, and his\nheart gave a great convulsive leap at the sight. Was this an\naccident--or treachery? An accident of course. Somehow he could not\nbring himself to think that Altorius would break his pledged word.\nProjected in a shimmering white arm the scalding death vapor shot\nacross the staircase, its hot breath licking the faces of the startled\nand angry Americans, and quickly forcing them to turn and run\ndownwards to avoid being scalded.\n\n\"What the devil are these idiots trying to do?\" gasped Nelson,\nanxiously eyeing the red-crested warriors who, peering down through\nthe blue lenses of their helmets, watched the khaki-clad aviators but\nmade no effort to realign their retortii. \"Hero Giles'll skin those\nfools alive if he hears of this. Guess we'd better wait a minute:\nthey'll soon shut off the steam.\"\n\nShielding his face from the steam clouds that obliterated all view of\nthe staircase above, Alden stood watching the billowing steam clouds\nin silent awe.\n\n\"Terrible, aren't they, Vic?\" he remarked. \"I've never seen those big\nfellows in action. They make the portable variety look like water\npistols.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the steam barrier showed no signs of abating, an uneasy gleam crept\ninto Nelson's dark eye, and with jaw grimly set, he cocked the\nWinchester and turned with the intention of lodging a complaint at the\nnext station below; but, to his utter dismay, he beheld bronze armored\nfigures on the next platform now training their long-muzzled steam gun\nacross the stair. Even as he sprang back, the deadly white vapor\nhissed forth from the second retortii, completely barring further\nretreat down the stair. Like an icy flood the chill of impending doom\ninvaded Nelson's soul. This was no accidental discharge, for with the\nslightest change of direction in the deflection of either retortii,\ndeath would descend upon him and his companion.\n\nSwiftly speech became impossible, as the roar of the huge retortii was\ndeafening; the two were lost in the heart of an opaque cloud which\ncompletely blotted out the copper-hued Atlantean sky. Hot blood surged\ninto Nelson's head while he became aware of ghostly and stealthy\nfigures advancing through the shimmering billows of vapor. Up, up,\nthey came, like dream men, their eyes weird and unreal. Cursing the\ntreachery of their late host, Nelson and Alden watched dozens upon\ndozens of hoplites come swarming up the stairs in solid,\ndully-gleaming ranks. Apparently intent to take them prisoners, the\nforemost Atlanteans made a rush, giving the American time to fire just\ntwice.\n\nUnable to retreat, the helpless aviators stood to meet the engulfing\nwave of hoplites. Nelson struck out as hard as he could at those\nyelling, red-bearded faces, though he knew the effort was hopeless. He\nwas dimly conscious that Alden, not far away, also fought with the\nvigor of despair.\n\nWith a sense of savage satisfaction, the dark haired aviator felt his\nfist impact solidly into a yelling, sweating face; then something\nstruck his head and, amid a miniature sunburst, his senseless form\nsank limply on the damp stones of the great staircase.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter an interval, the length of which he did not know, Victor Nelson\nopened his eyes slowly, for his head throbbed like a savage's war\ndrum. Uttering a stifled groan he shut the lids to still an\noverpowering sense of nausea which gripped him, but a moment later he\nmade another attempt to discover in what sort of place he found\nhimself. Gradually, his eyes became accustomed to a curious orange-red\nglare beyond a series of bars. Bars? The idea fixed itself in his\nbenumbed brain; bars meant prison! Yes, those grim blank walls bore\nout the assumption. He lay on the damp stone floor of what must be a\nfairly spacious cell. Beneath his leather aviator's jacket he\nshuddered. \"Jail, eh? What a nice place to wake up in!\"\n\nA groan from behind him prompted Nelson to painfully raise his head\nand look about. He blinked dazedly, meanwhile trying to focus his\neyes, then he heaved a faint sigh of relief as his gaze encountered\nthe muscular, well-proportioned figure of Richard Alden, who half sat,\nhalf reclined, against one of the grey stone walls, burying a ghastly\npale face between trembling hands.\n\n\"You hurt?\" To speak, Nelson drew a slightly deeper breath and at once\nbecame conscious of a horrible, throat-wrenching stench. Dimly, he\nrecalled having once before encountered such an odor; when was it? Oh,\nyes; during the Great War when he'd stumbled into a dugout tenanted by\nlong unburied corpses. A cold finger stabbed at his brain. Corpses.\n\n\"Are you hurt, Dick?\" he repeated hoarsely.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lax figure stirred and Alden's blonde head was raised slowly. \"I\ndon't know.\" His voice came very thickly. \"I--I'm still dizzy. What's\nhappened?\"\n\n\"Damned if I know; but those bright boys have evidently heaved us into\na calaboose of some kind!\"\n\nNelson, on peering about, had discovered that one end of the cell was\nclosed only by a series of massive bronze bars; the two other walls\nwere solid masonry; while the fourth was also solid but fitted with a\nsmall oval door of bronze.\n\n\"Calaboose? The hell you say!\" Alden coughed feebly. \"My God, but that\nsteam was terrible stuff. I nearly smothered before I got knocked\nout.\"\n\nSlowly, the younger aviator looked about, and suddenly his eyes\nwidened in an expression of indescribable horror.\n\n\"Look!\" Alden's voice had died to a shaken whisper. \"My God, Nelson,\nwe're finished! Look at that allosaurus!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFollowing the line indicated by the pilot's shaking forefinger, Nelson\npeered out through the series of great bars while a shudder shook his\naching body. Though he had seen these fearful monsters on many\noccasions, yet it was never from such a position as that in which he\nnow found himself. To his ears came a sibilant hissing like that of a\nthousand serpents; and, quivering in every nerve, he forced his eyes\nopen once again, to discover that the cell which he and his companion\noccupied was but one of a series of cells surrounding a huge square in\nwhich were imprisoned perhaps twenty or thirty of those horrible,\ngargoylesque creatures which were the Atlantean dogs of war. Some\nthirty-four feet in length, the enormous, slate-grey monsters hopped\nleisurely about, their warty hides and huge luminous eyes betraying\ntheir reptilian origin. In shape the allosauri resembled loathsome and\ntitanic kangaroos as they lumbered awkwardly to and fro, picking\nviciously at what appeared to be fragments of human flesh and bones.\n\nWhile the two prisoners crouched paralyzed with horror, one of the\nnightmarish creatures came hopping over and, pressing a head as big as\na steam scoop against the bars, stared in with huge, pale green eyes.\nA long minute the ghastly creature remained looking in, clearly\noutlined by the orange glow from outside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe doomed aviators found something fearfully fascinating about those\nnarrow vertical irises set in pupils the size of dinner plates.\nUttering a deep growl, the allosaurus shuffled nearer, and impatiently\nrubbed its huge, bullet head against the bars; then gripped the\nponderous bronze bars with its ridiculously small front legs to shake\nthe whole grille-work with a savagery that dislocated bits of plaster\nand made the metal reverberate. While Nelson and Alden shrank flat\nagainst the far wall, a scarlet tongue at least four feet long\nflicked the air but a few feet from their bloodless, sweating visages.\nBecoming irritated at the sturdiness of the barrier, the mountainous\nreptile tugged harder and hissed, filling the cell with a foul\nexhalation that stank like the reeks of smoldering rags.\n\nNelson's wavering consciousness reeled, and a mad, dreadful fear, like\nthat a dreamer suffers in the grip of nightmare, invaded his being. He\nfelt the hairs rising on the nape of his neck.\n\nBut, with a squall of rage, the monster abandoned its futile efforts\nand leaped away. Feigning indifference, the allosaurus picked up a\nhalf-gnawed skull with its tiny forelegs; and, while the prisoners\nwatched, it stuffed the head into a maw twice the size of an\nelephant's and crunched the gruesome tidbit as easily as a boy would a\nwalnut. Presently it shuffled off to rejoin the hideous herd in the\ncenter of the court.\n\n\"Nice kind of a jail we've been thrown into. Wish I could understand\nwhat's happened.\" Alden buried his face in his hands. \"It kind of\nlooks as though Altorius had a change of heart.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNelson replied nothing, but sat staring fixedly out into the horrible\ncourt.\n\n\"Somehow, I don't think Altorius would do such a thing,\" he said at\nlast. \"Let's think back and see if we can't piece this treachery\ntogether.\"\n\n\"Wish I had your faith in the Emperor--but I haven't.\" Alden's\nhandsome face twisted itself into a wry smile.\n\n\"Let's see, now,\" persisted Nelson, fingering a square jaw upon which\nsprouted a thick growth of reddish bristles. \"There was a deputation\nof priests to see Altorius yesterday. They were clamoring for the\nreturn of Altara--the Sacred Virgin--and looked pretty mad when he put\nthem off.\"\n\n\"Maybe this is the private doing of the priests,\" admitted Alden.\n\"Anyway, we're in one devil of a fix. There's certainly no way out of\nthis calaboose--and those damned brutes out there look hungry.\"\n\nNelson frowned, deep in thought. \"Wish I could find a reasonable\nexplanation. I really don't think it's Altorius; still, that's what\nyou get for mixing in on the politics of these forgotten kingdoms.\"\n\n\"But,\" reminded the other, \"you had no choice, old lad. Remember, you\nmixed in to save me.\"\n\nFrom across the courtyard rang a loud, penetrating shriek of fear that\nmade the two aviators spring to their feet and rush to the bars.\nPeering across the court, they discovered three naked men shrieking\nand clinging frantically to the bars of an exactly similar cell.\n\n\"What's wrong with them?\" demanded Alden as the agonized screams rang\nlouder still.\n\n\"I don't know,\" was Alden's breathless reply. \"But what's that noise?\"\n\nA curious metallic clanking sound filled the poisoned air, and for a\nmoment Nelson remained utterly puzzled. Then, as the noise grew\nlouder, the allosauri commenced to betray a strange restlessness. They\nceased basking and feeding, and their hideous heads commenced to dart\nquickly this way and that.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile the terrific shrieks of the wretches across the court rang to\nthe copper-hued sky, the two Americans remained in doubt; then all at\nonce the chill of death gripped their hearts, as they saw the bars of\nthat cell directly opposite slowly but surely rising! Uttering\nheart-rending cries, the doomed prisoners clung frantically to stay\nthe vanishing barrier separating them from those appalling man-eaters.\nBut, disdainful of their pitiful efforts, the bronze bars rose\nrelentlessly with metallic rattlings and janglings from some unseen\nmechanism.\n\nRooted to the floor, both Americans watched the distant grille vanish\ninto the upper stone-work and heard the ghastly hissing as the\nallosauri herd commenced to move forward. Sick and shaken, Nelson\nbeheld one of the doomed men cling in desperation to the bars; he was\nlifted clear of the floor and borne towards the ceiling, meanwhile\nventing his terror with such screams as could otherwise have risen\nonly from an inquisitor's torture chamber.\n\nThe tragedy was swiftly completed. Half a dozen of the nearest\nallosauri, taller than any giraffes, suddenly sprang forward, their\nlong, naked tails rising as their gait increased. Snarling horribly,\nthe vast slate-colored beasts plunged into the cell, terminating\nshrieks of mortal terror. Backs broader than bus tops squirmed and\ntugged, then one of the loathsome monsters reappeared carrying in its\ndripping jaws a mangled, yet struggling victim much as a cat carries a\nmouse. In a trice the other allosauri came rushing eagerly up, seeking\nto snatch the prey from the first monster.\n\nNelson stiffened. \"Great God! And that's what'll happen to us!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWeakened by his head wound, and blind with nausea, he stumbled to the\nrear of the cell to collapse upon a pile of foul straw, littered with\nequipment which the superstitious captors must have condemned together\nwith the owners.\n\nNelson sank upon them, then stiffened, for his outflung hand had\nencountered a hard, familiar outline. It was a .45 automatic pistol.\n\nA moment's furious search revealed that the captors had missed or not\nunderstood the use of the weapon in Alden's leather flying coat.\n\n\"God, but we're lucky,\" Nelson panted. \"The Atlanteans never saw this\npistol of yours. They're only used to my rifle.\"\n\nHope lit Alden's features, then faded. \"But what good is a .45\nagainst brutes like those? Might at well have a pop gun!\"\n\n\"Still we're lucky,\" grunted Nelson, delighted to find the magazine\nyet filled. \"Can't tell what's ahead. Yes, we're the luckiest--\"\n\nHe broke off in quick alarm. From overhead had come a premonitory\nclang! Somewhere a tackle whined and, with a sense of suffocation,\nboth men realised that now the bars of _their_ prison were beginning\nto creep up into a long slit in the stone ceiling!\n\nCold fingers of fear clutched Nelson's heart as the terrible\nallosauri, their jaws yet dripping redly, wheeled about at the\nfamiliar sound--to stand listening. Up and up crept the ponderous\ngrille, while the allosauri commenced to shuffle forward, fixing on\ntheir next victims enormous, unblinking green eyes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile the whole loathsome cell spun about, Victor Nelson forced stiff\nfingers to throw off the safety catch as the nearest allosaurus opened\nits cavernous mouth in anticipation, displaying an array of curved\nteeth, as long and sharp as bayonets. Standing some fifteen feet high\nat the shoulder the horrible creature's body was; it all but blotted\nout the light. The bars rose inexorably. Now they were waist high....\nNow above Nelson's head.... In a moment would come the rush.\n\nRichard Alden stood up straight and squared his shoulders. \"Good-by,\nVic,\" he said, in clear, unafraid tones. \"I don't imagine that .45\nwill even tickle those ghastly brutes.\"\n\nNelson nodded. \"All over but the cheering,\" he replied with that\nstrange, macabre humor which often comes to solace men about to die.\n\n\"See you in church.\" There was an equally gallant lightness to Alden's\nreply.\n\nThe dark haired pilot, with a curious, detached sense of unreality,\nstepped into the middle of the room, the automatic in his hand seeming\nno more potent than a water pistol, for a ponderous, lambent eyed\nmonster was now hopping forward. While minute particles of dust and\ndirt rained down from the disappearing barrier, the foremost\nallosaurus opened its enormous jaws, uttered an eery scream and\ncharged straight at the unbarred cell.\n\nDrawing a deep breath, Nelson raised the .45, sighted, and,\nremembering his former experience, fired at the enormous right eye. As\nin a dream, he felt the recoil. The monster neither slowed nor swerved\nin the least, though its great, saucer-like eye disintegrated\nhorribly. Immediately Nelson swiftly sighted at the other eye and\nfired, just as the allosaurus' shadow filled the threshold.\n\n_Crack!_ A swirl of bitter smoke stung the aviator's staring eyes.\nHe'd hit; he knew it!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCyclopean moments followed as the blinded monster dashed forward,\nmissed the circular door, and, butting his head against the stone wall\nto the left, fell completely stunned, effectively blocking the doorway\nwith its huge body. One enormous hind leg, fully ten feet long, and\nequipped with three razor-like claws, projected into the cell and\nlashed aimlessly back and forth, forcing the two prisoners to dodge\nwildly.\n\nThere ensued that indescribable kind of a moment when men go mad.\nOutside the cell the ravenous herd pounced upon their fallen mate and\nwith hideous grunts and snarls promptly commenced to tear it apart.\nThe shaken prisoners realized that the rending jaws would before long\nundoubtedly remove the temporary obstacle; but meanwhile the hideous\nhissing and the fetid stench of the allosauri breath made the cell a\nmad-house.\n\nGradually, the gigantic carcass at the door commenced to quiver and\nroll violently under the ferocious tugs of the eager feasters. A gap\nof light appeared over the huge haunches, and, all at once, another\nof those terrible heads slipped over the carcass and into the cell.\n\nAgain the .45 thundered, lighting the darkened cell with a brief\norange flame. A noise like the furious trumpeting of a dozen elephants\nnearly blew Nelson flat as the wounded monster drew back its head, but\nthe respite promised to be short, for the other reptiles only\nre-doubled their horrid, cannibalistic rending of the carcass. When\nthe barrier was removed there would be a general rush which the shaken\naviators could not hope to stay.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly, Alden uttered a low shout and pointed to the small, oval\ndoor which had, up to this point, remained securely bolted and shut.\nIt was swinging gradually open, rimmed with a strong reddish light.\n\nWide-eyed, and with black hair streaming lank over his forehead,\nNelson, in the act of reloading, swung about to meet this new menace.\nHell! What point was there in prolonging the pitiful struggle? What\nwas happening?\n\nSlowly, the door swung back, and a rosy glow lit the opening, a glow\nthat became as strong as the gleam of a spotlight. Then, slowly, a\nglittering, green-crested helmet of highly polished bronze appeared,\nand, under it, Hero Giles' familiar features, now distorted by a\nterrible fear. The blue eyes seemed enormous. \"Quickly!\" he called.\n\"Quick or ye are lost!\"\n\nUnbelieving of the reprieve, both the aviators stared an instant at\nthat martial figure clad in brazen armor liberally studded with\nenormous diamonds and emeralds, then leaped forward with the speed of\ndesperation, for from behind came a fierce squalling from the\nallosauri. As he darted towards the door Nelson had a glimpse of the\ncarcass blocking the door commencing to slip sidewise.\n\nAlden was already out and Nelson sped through the door barely in time\nto escape the razor-sharp talons of the foremost allosaurus as it\nscrambled into the deserted cell with a resounding bellow of\ndisappointed fury.\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nAs the door clanged shut, drowning out the allosauri's furious\nscreams, both aviators, shaken to the depths of their beings, could do\nnothing but stare about them in surprise. Completely surrounding and\nprotecting the exit stood a double rank of hoplites in bronze armor.\nLike unreal automata, they remained utterly motionless, fixed in the\nvarious postures of an ancient Macedonian phalanx, their broad backs\ngleaming dully in the light of the neon flares. As in a dream, Nelson\nrecognized on top of each spearsman's casque the graceful Atlantean\nmilitary crest--a metal dolphin from the back of which sprouted a\nseries of bright blue feathers, arranged like a dorsal fin.\n\n\"Thank Poseidon, ye still live!\" cried Hero Giles, gripping their\nhands eagerly. \"I had fear for ye, oh my friends.\"\n\nNelson grinned. \"You cut the rescue act pretty fine, but of course\nwe're damned grateful. And now,\"--eagerly seizing the Hero's\nsplendidly muscled arm--\"in God's name tell us what's happened. Why we\nwere arrested and--nearly made into allosaurus fodder?\"\n\nHero Giles turned from snapping an order to a subaltern who was\npeering down a great, shadowy hallway with a distinctly uneasy manner.\n\n\"Much,\" he said. \"Scarcely had ye two departed from Heliopolis than\nthe priests, mad with rage over Altara's continued captivity, dared to\nseize the person of His Splendor and proclaim a regency. Herakles, the\narch-priest is--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom far down the gloomy, vaulted corridor came a faint sound, rather\nlike the distant cheering of a crowd. The hoplites, standing about,\nturned their helmeted heads and stared uneasily, their brazen armor\nglowing dully with each movement.\n\n\"I'll tell ye more later, but now--\"--Hero Giles' voice took on a\nringing quality like the clash of steel--\"there is work to be done. To\nrescue ye, oh Hero Nelson, I slew the guards at the lower gate, for\nthis prison lies in the hands of a caitiff rogue, Hero Edmund, one who\nclings to the priestly party. We had best be off lest we be trapped\nand slaughtered like rats in a pit.\"\n\nVery distinctly to the ears of the aviator now came the dull clash of\nequipment and the tread of feet.\n\n\"Forward! We must hasten to reach the podokos waiting below,\" cried\nHero Giles, settling his ponderous helmet more squarely on his leonine\nhead.\n\nAt once the escort of fifteen-odd hoplites commenced to move down the\ncorridor to the left, their hands tightly gripping the butts of their\nretortii pistols. At their head ran Hero Giles, and by his side Alden\nand Victor Nelson, who gripped his .45 vowing never again to return to\nthat ghastly cell.\n\nA long ringing cry from the rear brought home the dread realization\nthat the enemy had appeared. Looking back, Nelson could see the far\nend of the great corridor filled with menacing figures. Then his heart\nleaped like a deer in a thicket, for _from ahead_ sounded the clash of\nweapons! The rescue party's retreat was cut off!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHero Giles acted with the speed of a veteran accustomed to\nemergencies. \"Forward!\" he roared, making the bare walls reverberate\nand rumble with his voice. \"_Halor v\u00e0n! Ula Storr!_\"[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: Make ready for your retortii.]\n\nAs by magic, there appeared before the retreating force a double rank\nof blue-crested hoplites who debouched from a side passage into the\nhall and clawed desperately for fungus bombs and retortii. Evidently\nthey had not expected to come upon the invaders so abruptly.\n\n\"_Storr!_\" Like a brazen trumpet's call, the voice of Hero Giles rang\nout the order to fire--which was instantly drowned out in the furious\nhissing of the retortii of his followers.\n\nEver watchful, Nelson fired at a gigantic officer who, avoiding the\nfirst steam jets, flung back his arms to hurl one of the deadly fungus\nbombs among the rescuers. Shattering the bronze helmet, the American's\nbullet struck the Atlantean squarely between the eyes, but\nnevertheless the stricken officer's grenade rolled forward and burst\namong the hindermost of Hero Giles' followers. Instantly, the deadly\ngreen mold flung itself upon the nearest hoplites and in a moment they\ncrashed to the smooth granite floor, the yellowish growths already\nsprouting from nose, mouth and ears.\n\nIn the corridor reigned chaos, for Hero Giles' followers were now\nturning the full fury of their retortii upon the rank of men barring\nfurther flight. With dreadful ease, the scalding steam struck dead the\nopposing warriors, stripping the flesh from their bones as easily as a\nboy peels a banana.\n\nAmid the swirling white clouds, Nelson had ghastly visions of yellow\nskulls, of steaming accoutrement, of limp heaps of disintegrating\nbodies; then silence fell, and, before he quite realized it, he,\ntogether with Alden and three hoplites who had survived the disastrous\nfungus grenade, were bounding along after Hero Giles' glittering\nfigure as he led the way down one passage after another.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLouder than ever rang the fierce cry from the rear. Behind him Nelson\ncould see dozens upon dozens of yelling pursuers, and knew that if he\nwere to live he must run as never before.\n\nInto a succession of spacious rooms dashed the fugitives; on through\ndeserted armories where hundreds of bronze helmets dangled in orderly\nrows; and across silent barrack halls.\n\nCloser and closer sounded the pursuing feet, spurring the runners to\nan even more headlong gait.\n\nAll at once a door loomed to the right; into this darted Hero Giles\nand after him pounded the two Americans and three hoplites. In an\ninstant the six men set their shoulder to the ponderous bronze door\nand swung it to, just as the hiss of a retortii on the other side rose\nabove the mad, blood-hungry clamor of the momentarily baffled rebels.\nGasping and sweat-bathed, the fugitives paused only an instant.\n\n\"We've gained a short passage,\" gasped the Atlantean wrenching off his\nhelmet and breast plate. The veins stood out in great blue cords on\nhis forehead, for the weight of the armor could not have been\ninconsiderable. \"Below wait our podokos.\"\n\nNelson stripped off his leather coat, following the example of the\nhoplites, who swiftly divested themselves of such cumbersome equipment\nas could readily be removed. Then, while the shouts of the thwarted\npursuers swelled like a demonic chorus, and while feathers of steam\ncrept under the great door, Hero Giles spun about and, with his short\nyellow hair gleaming bright, led on down another series of passages.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll at once the fugitives, now reduced by exhaustion to five, found\nthemselves on a balcony overlooking the great valley of Atlans. Before\nthem opened an enormous staircase and down this they dashed at top\nspeed, infinitely relieved to be once more in the open air.\n\nRunning like hunted stags, the fugitives had descended but a third of\nthe great staircase, when, from behind, came a sudden, menacing cry\nthat warned Nelson that the pursuers had, after going a longer way\naround, come once more in sight.\n\n\"Ah! Poseidon blast the traitorous Edmund and his varlets! See?\"\npanted Hero Giles pointing to a huge arch from beneath which was\nissuing a glittering column of shouting, swift running warriors at\nwhose head dashed a splendidly-proportioned figure that must be Hero\nEdmund.\n\nWith the speed of the hunted, Hero Giles bounded forward, taking three\nand four steps at a stride, his jade green cloak snapping out behind.\nDown, ever downwards over the endless flight of stairs the aviators\nfollowed him until, spent and panting, the hard pressed five plunged\ndown a final circular staircase and so gained a courtyard where waited\na detachment of armored lancers whose yellow plumes and pennons shone\nbright in the glare of the flame suns. Staring anxiously upwards, the\ntroopers nevertheless stood to attention in an orderly rank beside\nthose curious Atlantean mounts called podokos.\n\nDuring all his sojourn in Atlans, Nelson had never become used to the\nhideous and awe-inspiring podokos which closely resembled the\nallosauri but were only eighteen feet long. Like the other monsters,\nthey had tremendously developed hind legs which promised the speed now\nso vital for escape and safety. Ready in the tooth-studded jaws of\neach podoko was fitted a bronze bit together with a bridle and reins;\nand cinched up on each creature's back was one of those curious\nAtlantean saddles, which was built up at the cantle to overcome the\ndownward slope of the podokos' spines.\n\nNeed for vital haste was but too obvious and, as he drew near, Hero\nGiles gasped the command to be off.\n\n\"Quick,\" he shouted, his scarred visage flushed and sweat-bathed.\n\"Saddles! Speed! Speed! Cling fast as your beasts arise!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll five literally hurled themselves into gorgeously caparisoned\nsaddles. Instantly, the urging squatting podokos leaped to their feet.\n\nIt was the work of a moment for Nelson to wrench his reptile around,\nfor already Alden and the Atlantean cavalrymen were speeding across\nthe wide paved court, their lance pennons fluttering bravely in the\norange-hued glare.\n\nAt top speed the rescuers dashed for a great, oval gateway while the\npodokos increased their gait; like aero-planes gathering speed, the\nfaster the weird creatures traveled, the higher arose their tails.\n\nThen, following the frightened, backward glances of the hard-riding,\nred-haired lancers, Nelson suddenly discovered a new and terrible\ncause for this headlong flight, for, issuing from an unbarred gateway,\ncame perhaps a dozen of _the terrible and enormous allosauri_, which,\nspying the fleeing cavalry, instantly gave chase.\n\nWith a sense of despair, the aviators heard the ferocious bellows\nbooming from behind and watched the appallingly swift progress of\nthose uncouth monsters as, leaping high into the air, the allosauri\ncovered between fifty and sixty feet at a single bound.\n\n\"They'll get you,\" cried an inner voice in Nelson's being. \"They'll\ncatch you sure.\" But the small and lithe podokos, sensing death\nleaping up from the rear, stretched out their slender, snake-like\nheads, stood on tiptoe, and, pressing their small forelegs tight\nagainst their chests, commenced to run far faster than any horse could\ngallop. Nevertheless, the allosauri came bounding up like colossal\nkangaroos, uttering weird, screaming roars that brought a chill of\nimminent death to the fugitives.\n\nCasting a quick glance over his shoulder, Nelson's blood froze to find\nan allosaurus not more than seventy yards behind, and making terrible\nexertions to close that slender gap! Nearer and nearer coursed the\nincredible monster, body rocking in its terrific stride, dreadful jaws\nwide apart--jaws that could, without an effort, cut a horse in half.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA fear such as he had never known racked Nelson's consciousness as he\nfound he was hindermost of the cavalcade, which was strung out like a\nfield of racers. The other riders crouched low in their saddles like\njockeys, lances held straight out before them, and furiously goaded\ntheir strange mounts with curious hooks. Nelson was vastly relieved to\nget a glimpse of Alden far in the lead, almost beside the Atlantean\nPrince. His podoko was evidently better than the average.\n\nFaster and faster pursuers and pursued raced across level meadows,\nover straight, white roads and rolling grain fields. Wind whistled\nmadly in Nelson's ears, filled his eyes with tears, and made his\nshort, dark hair snap, but two huge allosauri were now not twenty\nyards behind and _gaining with appalling speed!_\n\nOn the verge of madness, Nelson hammered his heels into the podoko's\nscaly side and wished he dared let go the saddle horn to draw his\npistol, but to loose his grip was to risk falling off.\n\nCloser and closer! Two enormous nightmarish heads were actually\nsnapping at the fleeing podoko's tail. Then fear must have inspired\nthe reptile Nelson bestrode, for it put on a sudden desperate burst of\nspeed which carried it past the next two lancers. In passing he\nglimpsed the doomed wretches, pale-faced and horrified, as they\nfrantically goaded their failing podokos.\n\nA moment later, piercing screams from just behind assailed Nelson's\nears, but when he looked to the rear once more it was to find that a\nwide gap had opened between him and the great monsters behind.\nEvidently, the heavy-built allosauri were unable to long maintain the\nterrific pace set by the smaller and more agile podokos whose maximum\nspeed Nelson judged to be well over sixty miles an hour.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe pilot's eyes narrowed on beholding, in clear relief and not far\naway, the majestic, whitish outline of mighty Heliopolis, whose lofty\ntowers, graceful domes and frowning citadels shone pink under the\nleaping, blinding glare on Mount Pelion.\n\n\"We certainly picked a nice time to drop in on this God-forsaken\ncountry,\" grunted Alden as the walls of Heliopolis loomed near. \"We\nseem to have crashed into the busiest days they've had in centuries.\nHow many shots you got?\"\n\nNelson, swaying to the steady trot of his podoko, hesitated.\n\n\"Only five. Damned if I know what's going to happen next. I suppose it\nall depends on Hero Giles. Looks as though the nobles were bent on\nrestoring Altorius--if he's not dead by now.\"\n\nAlden tugged powerfully at the strange bridle which controlled his\nbeast. \"The priests wouldn't dare kill him, but it surely looks like\ntheir rebellion has gained a lot of headway.\"\n\nA moment Alden's clear, blue eyes swept the towering battlements,\ngorgeously-sculptured temples and curious stepped pyramids, which now\nloomed near at hand and cast their rugged outlines sharp against the\ncopper-colored heavens.\n\n\"Maybe there's some way we can work this revolution trouble to help\nus,\" suggested Nelson, without enthusiasm. \"If we could play off one\ncrowd against the other--\"\n\nHis remarks were cut short as the foremost lancers slowed before an\nenormous bronze gate looming ahead. On the vast main panel was a\nbeautifully-wrought dolphin curling about a trident--symbol of the\nimperial power now so sorely tried. Beyond that gate, breathlessly\nmused Nelson, lay Heliopolis and an unknown fate.\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nIt would have taken no trained eye to observe that something very\nunusual had happened in Atlans. Some of Heliopolis' many wide streets\nwere quite deserted save for several small, bright-red cat-like\nreptiles that the Atlanteans sheltered as pets, but in other\nthoroughfares large throngs of people milled uneasily about, while\nlistening to the impassioned harangue of black-robed priests.\nEverywhere business was at a standstill, shops were closed and markets\ntenantless.\n\nRiding at an easy hopping gallop, the aviators urged their green,\nscaly mounts to the side of Hero Giles, for here and there some\nwandering citizens, spying the Americans, would yell shrill curses and\nshake their fists. Reining in, Nelson demanded to know the reason for\nthis unaccountable hostility.\n\n\"'Tis the work of our gentle and holy priests,\" explained Hero Giles\nwith a hard laugh. \"They have told the populace ye are magicians\nseeking to set other gods above Poseidon.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" rapped the American, looking about uneasily. \"We've never\ngiven two thin damns about anything except getting back to our plane.\"\n\n\"So I know,\" was the Atlantean's preoccupied reply; \"but this spawn of\nHerakles' temples speak loud, and the loutish populace hearkens to\ntheir lies!\"\n\n\"But what the devil is all this revolt about?\" broke in Alden. \"Why\nwere we arrested? You started to tell us at the prison.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHero Giles frowned as he pulled his podoko into a gracefully carved\ngateway of green marble. \"There's but little to add, for 'tis all very\nsimple. The priests have laid impious hands on His Splendor, Altorius,\nand imprisoned him in the great temple of Poseidon. We nobles have\ndefied the arch-priest, for the dog-conceived Jereboam already\nmarshals his forces for a fresh attack, knowing that Atlans is sore\nbeset by internal strife. Have patience for now we go to the council\nchamber, where ye shall hear everything.\"\n\nTo say that the newcomers found the council of nobles in a furore\nwould be to put it mildly. Their angry voices carried far down the\nbeautifully ornamented corridors of the Imperial Palace, which was\nused as headquarters.\n\n\"Sounds like a dog-fight going on in there,\" muttered Alden anxiously.\n\"Don't like the sound of it a bit. I hope they feel kindly towards\nus.\"\n\nNelson, swinging along with his ragged shirt fluttering like a\nscarecrow's, nodded. \"Yes, so do I. But I guess they need our help or\nHero Giles wouldn't have risked his life to save us.\"\n\nConscious of the value of appearances, the dark-haired aviator\nunconsciously straightened his frayed black tie, buttoned the sleeves\nof his khaki flannel shirt and otherwise made pathetic attempts at\nimproving his appearance as the clamor of wrangling voices grew loud\ndown the corridor.\n\nHis wide shoulders swinging to his stride, Hero Giles flung open a\ndoor, beautifully wrought with leaping podokos, and halted on the\nthreshold.\n\n\"Death!\" rumbled a voice from inside. \"I say death to the Wanderers!\nLet us make our peace with the priests, lest they slay His Splendor\nforthwith.\"\n\n\"And that's what I call a nice friendly greeting,\" was Alden's\nmurmured comment. \"Better get your gat handy, Vic. I'll bet they've\ngot a reception committee of retortii men behind the door.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no time for Nelson to reply because now the threshold was at\nhand. Inside, seated at a table, he had an impression of perhaps ten\nor fifteen scarred and angry-looking veteran nobles whose green cloaks\nand bejeweled armor revealed their high rank.\n\nIn mid-dispute they halted, eyeing the three figures in the doorway\nwith curiously conflicting expressions. Some smiled a relieved\nwelcome, some stared in surprise, but not a few greeted the Americans\nwith lowering brows and angry, threatening eyes.\n\n\"Harken,\" Hero Giles greeted them. \"By Poseidon's grace the Wanderers\nwere saved from a vile death. Rise Heroes, and bid them welcome!\"\n\n\"Ah, the Wanderers!\" In an instant Hero John was wringing Nelson's\nhand. \"Oh blessed hour! I had feared for ye both. Welcome, Hero\nAlden!\"\n\nA faint flush crept over the young man's wan and trouble-lined face.\n\"'Tis well ye've come,\" he whispered. \"The council was prepared to\nchange their intent towards ye.\"\n\nA grizzled, one-eyed prince arose, and leveling an accusing forefinger\nat Nelson shouted, \"'Tis he hath caused the rebellion. Slay him!\"\n\n\"Nay!\" thundered the Hero Giles, \"and forget not, Hero Paul--_I_ am\nsenior Prince of Atlans!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the great white marble council chamber silence fell, while from\nwonderfully carved ivory and gold chairs the harassed, yellow-bearded\nprinces regarded the two uneasy Americans.\n\n\"Hearken, Hero Giles!\" rasped another dark-browed officer in a plain,\nmuch-dented red breast plate. \"I side with Paul. Away with them, I\nsay! Time is too precious. Do not the dark hordes of Jereboam beat\nback our frontiers?\"\n\nHero Giles glowered and sat bolt upright in his chair--a strange\ndisordered figure among his gorgeously robed and armored peers. \"Thou\nwert ever a hothead! I prithee pause a moment! Remember how the\ndark-haired Wanderer once aided our imprisoned Emperor, whom Poseidon\nprotect! Perchance, Hero Nelson and his friend once more can aid us in\nthis, our hour of need.\"\n\nA chorus of variously opined voices broke out, while Nelson with an\neye to possible violence stood ready.\n\n\"Silence! Sirrah!\" The fierce old veteran banged a powerful fist on a\ngolden dolphin head forming his chair arm. \"This idle wrangling\naccomplishes naught, and a thousand weighty matters await our\nattention. Is it true the phalanxes at Tricca have risen for the\npriests?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n[Illustration: _Map of Jarmuth and Atlans_]\n\nBefore Hero Giles could reply, a stalwart guard at the door flung it\nopen to admit a dust and sweat-bathed courier who, darting forward,\nflung himself at Hero Giles' no less dusty feet. While the\nyellow-haired Prince started back muttering in amazement, the runner\nraised a shaking hand.\n\n\"Woe, woe to Atlans!\" he panted. \"Jarmuthian retortii men have crossed\nthe boiling river. Cierum is fallen! Its garrison is drenched in\nclouds of fungus gas. But a handful escaped!\"\n\n\"Speak on: is that all?\" A terribly intent expression crept over the\naquiline faces around the council table.\n\n\"Nay, spare thy servant!\" begged the green kilted courier, raising\nsweaty, imploring hands. \"I--I dare not--\"\n\n\"Speak!\" snarled Hero Giles, his blue eyes terribly lit. \"Speak!--else\nthy carcass shall be flung to the pteranodons.\"\n\nWild-eyed, the fellow blinked fearfully about. The grim-lipped nobles\nedged closer. Nelson, realizing all that lay at stake, watched\nintently, conscious that Alden was now by his side.\n\n\"I--I, Her Sacred Holiness, Altara--.\" The messenger's red face\ntwitched and he choked as in terror.\n\n\"Altara!\" The name reechoed weirdly from a dozen dry throats, and\nNelson saw the skin suddenly pale and tighten over Hero John's face.\n\n\"What of the divine Altara, fool?\" he thundered in a dreadful, shaken\nmonotone. \"Have those foul swine of Jarmuth dared--?\"\n\n\"Forgive, oh Hero!\" cried the groveling courier, his long red hair\nsweeping the marble floor. \"The dog-sired Jereboam hath made\nproclamation in Jezreel that the Sacred Virgin is doomed to perish on\nthe altar of Beelzebub, their demon god, in two days' time!\"\n\n\"What?\" The great marble-walled chamber was shaken by an unearthly\noutcry as horror and rage struggled for mastery in the circle of tense\nfaces surrounding the momentarily forgotten aviators.\n\nBedlam broke loose, while Hero Giles sat as though stunned, staring on\nthe shivering runner at his feet.\n\nNelson, very much on the alert, could see that the announcement of\nAltara's impending death had produced nothing short of a cataclysm in\nthe plans of the council.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLike men paralyzed by electric shocks, the yellow bearded veterans and\nnobles sat stupefied, frozen in their last gesture. Then, in the midst\nof their silent despair, came the sound of a curious, high-pitched\nhorn that had in its note something of the eery wail of a fire siren.\nThe effect was magical, for the nobles sprang up, hands on sword hilts\nand eyes searching the corridor.\n\n\"The priests!\" gasped a short, broad-shouldered noble at Altorius'\nleft. \"By Poseidon! 'Tis the fanfare of the Herakles himself.\"\n\nThen indeed did the council glower, for, as Nelson soon learned,\nHerakles was the moving spirit and evil genius of that priestly party\nwhich had dared to imprison the Emperor.\n\nAgain the horn wailed its warning of the arch-priest's approach,\nwhereat a stalwart hoplite in green painted armor clanked in, saluted\nstiffly and waited for Hero Giles' instructions.\n\n\"Bid the old man enter,\" directed the Prince at last. \"Tell the\ngraybeard he has naught to fear if he comes alone. Otherwise, bid him\nreturn to his kennel in the temples.\"\n\nA moment after the hoplite had vanished, there appeared in the doorway\na tall, emaciated old man on whose silvery head was set a curious\ngolden mitre ending in the shape of a wondrously bejewelled trident.\nThe curious Americans noted that the arch-priest's robes were as black\nas his evilly glittering eyes, and were embroidered with curious\ncabalistic symbols done in silver thread. In his withered hand\nHerakles carried a ceremonial trident--the mark of the Head Priest of\nPoseidon.\n\nAs though wary of advancing, the arch priest paused in the doorway,\nnot three feet from where Nelson stood poised for action.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll at once the gaunt figure in black raised thin hands to the dome\nfar overhead and cried in high-pitched prophetic tones:\n\n\"Woe to Atlans! When perishes Altara, virgin of Poseidon the God-head,\nthen shall a darkness fall on Atlans! Her cities shall be cast down,\nthere will be a weeping and wailing in the land, for Beelzebub and his\nfollowers shall prevail! Woe to Atlans and woe to ye all, blasphemous\nnobles!\"\n\nGripped by a superstitious awe, the generals and nobles fell into an\nuneasy silence, fearfully lowering their eyes and then glancing\naskance at the plain khaki clad figures standing alert in their\ncorner.\n\nNelson, defiantly meeting their eyes, beheld Hero Giles staring\nfixedly before him, his powerful shoulders bowed as though bearing an\noverwhelming burden.\n\nDeeper grew the silence of disaster while the American furiously\nsearched his mind for some means of thwarting the death in store for\nhim and his companion. By chance, a word of Hero Giles recurred, the\n\"pteranodons.\" What in the devil was a pteranodon? He turned sidewise\nto Alden who stood, hands in the pocket of his leather jacket, also\nthinking deeply.\n\n\"Dick,\" he whispered. \"You studied paleontology at college. Do you\nremember what a pteranodon was?\"\n\n\"A what?\" The younger aviator seemed to make a definite effort to\nreturn to the present. \"A pteranodon? I'm not sure, Vic, but I think\nit was a kind of flying reptile related to the pterodactyl group.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe could go on no further, for Herakles, the arch-priest, raised his\nsnowy head suddenly, his eyes blazing. \"To save Atlans in her hour of\ntrial, we demand that ye deliver to us the Wanderers. They shall die\nas an offering to Ares, God of War. Perchance he will preserve us.\"\nThe arch-priest's deep-set and glittering eyes swept with venomous\nhatred the two calm-featured aviators, who looked very plain and\nunromantic in their flying jackets and khaki serge. \"We, familiars of\nthe Gods, herewith demand that the blasphemers perish on the War God's\naltar! Else shall ye all die unbeloved of the Gods!\"\n\n\"And we do your bidding, will ye give us back His Splendor?\" demanded\nHero Giles.\n\n\"Nay--we priests do not bargain like hucksters.\"\n\nRisking all, Nelson muttered a swift aside to Alden. \"How big were\nthose pteranodons?\"\n\n\"Some species had a wing spread of twenty-five feet.\"\n\nThe muscular pilot's mouth closed into a firm, colorless line as he\nnodded and glanced at the vindictive old man who was by now white with\nfury.\n\nUp sprang a good three-quarters of the nobles present and turned on\nthe grim figure at the head of the board.\n\n\"Surrender the Wanderers!\" they shouted. \"We demand it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn another instant the death sentence would have been forced on Hero\nGiles, but Victor Nelson leaped forward, pistol menacing the raging\ngray-bearded priest.\n\n\"Listen, all of you!\" he shouted in deep tones that were strangely\nauthoritative. \"Beware, foolish Princes, how you threaten us. Great is\nour knowledge and power: you've seen that already. Even now, the other\nWanderer and I can save or ruin Atlans, as we wish! Have ye forgotten\nthe battle by Lake Copias?\"\n\nThe Princes, furious at the American's defiance, half rose, hand on\nsword hilt, but sank back at a swift, menacing gesture from Nelson's\npistol.\n\n\"What sayest thou, mad fellow?\" screeched the arch-priest, his black\neyes bright as knife points. \"Save Atlans--?\" Fierce questioning was\nin his sombre, sunken eyes.\n\n\"I said,\" repeated Nelson, \"that, if we choose, we can yet save your\nAltara and the Emperor from death.\"\n\n\"Impossible! He is mad!\" shouted Paul, the one-eyed Hero. \"Not the\nGods themselves could rescue Altara from the claws of the demon\nBeelzebub!\" The nearest nobles flung themselves back in their chairs\nand snarled threats of all kinds as they gripped their sword hilts.\n\nSensing an inescapable climax, the khaki-clad American raised his\npistol, covering Hero Paul, the speaker. \"Silence!\" he rasped.\n\"You're a thick-headed idiot not to see the truth. Can this priest\nsave Altara? No! You know damned well he can't! And yet you'd have us\nkilled.\"\n\n\"Now, Herakles,\" he swung on the priest, \"about this Altara matter--if\nyou'll restore Altorius unharmed, guarantee our safety, and punish\nthose liars who condemned us to death, the other Wanderer and I will\nundertake to not only prevent the sacrifice of Altara, but to bring\nthe Princess back as well!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo all this Alden listened with increasing and indescribable dismay,\nhis blue eyes round as marbles. \"My God!\" he whispered in an\nundertone. \"What in the devil is Vic doing? _Undertake_ is _right_,\nthe crazy fool!\"\n\n\"How will ye accomplish this mad boast?\" demanded the arch-priest in\ndeep suspicion. \"Know ye that the Sacred Virgin lies captive in the\ndungeons of the great temple of Beelzebub? Know ye that this temple is\nin the center of Jezreel, capitol of Jarmuth?\"\n\n\"I had some idea that was the case.\"\n\n\"Know ye,\" continued, the graybeard priest, \"that Altara is ever\nguarded by two thousand picked priests and warriors? Know ye,\nmoreover, that this vile sacrifice will be made but two days hence?\"\n\nThe aviator's lean, dark head inclined with a serenity he far from\nfelt.\n\nAt this point the scarred veteran officer who had spoken before broke\nin, his face menacing. \"Believe not this liar, oh Hero Giles! He\nspeaks with a tongue made bold by fear. He promises that which he\ncannot accomplish!\"\n\nHad Victor Nelson had time to reflect upon the weirdness of the plan\nhe had evolved, he would probably have silently admitted that his\ngrizzled accuser was more than a little justified, but as it was he\nsmiled serenely.\n\nFrom all sides rose a threatening shout. \"Let the blasphemers be\nsacrificed. Ares will protect us!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis yellow brows knit, Hero Giles wavered, but as he hesitated there\nran through a great circular window a distant yet menacing shout.\n\"Down with Altorius, the Unlucky! Down with the sons of Hudson! Give\nback to the ancient Gods their Sacred Virgin. Hail to Ares! Death to\nthe Wanderers! Death! Death!\"\n\nDrowning out these ominous cries there came from below the window the\nbrazen clang of trumpets and the clank of many armored men hurrying\nforward. Presently the mob's outcry grew fainter, but still the cries\nof \"Death\" could be heard.\n\nIt was a tense moment. Would Hero Giles remain friendly? With poignant\nanxiety, Nelson watched that dishevelled martial head sink forward in\nperplexity.\n\n\"Hero Giles,\" he warned, in a low voice. \"You'd better trust us.\nYou're risking nothing.\"\n\nSlowly, the fierce blue eyes of the veteran rose, and, meeting the\nlevel gray ones of the aviator, lingered there as though asking a\nquestion. Suddenly reaching a determination, he rose to his feet and\naddressed the triumphantly grinning arch-priest, who tightly clutched\nhis trident wand with thin, blue-veined fingers.\n\n\"Hearken, black crow of a priest, who has dared lay foul hands on His\nSplendor, the Emperor. This is my reply: show me how ye will rescue\nAltara; otherwise begone! My hand itches for the sword.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA deep silence fell while Herakles glowered helplessly, then shrewdly\navoided the trap. \"This is blasphemy!\" he croaked and raised a\nquivering forefinger in solemn warning. \"Woe to thee, Hero Giles. Woe\nto the people! Fear the wrath of the Gods!\n\n\"Jeer not, ye nobles!\" Herakles stormed on. \"Be not deceived by lies!\nI bid thee deliver these magicians to Ares, God of War!\"\n\nA nasty moment; Nelson's heart drummed as he gazed down at the row of\nuneasy, war-like faces, but Hero Giles proved the strength of his\nheritage. Back went his patrician head; he drew himself up to full\nheight and stared coldly upon the black robed priest, who, nothing\ndaunted, gave back look for look.\n\n\"Nay! We keep them: they will bear out their promise. I give ye good\nday, oh Holiness!\"\n\nQuivering with rage Herakles raised his withered hand in anathema.\n\"Then perish, blind spawn of Hudson! Verily shall ye all die under the\ntorture. Woe! Woe! Woe!\"\n\nThen, amid a strained silence, pregnant of distrust and disaster, the\nold man wheeled and stalked out.\n\nAs he watched the departure, color drained from the Atlantean prince's\nhaggard features. \"Ah,\" he observed bitterly, \"ever have these black\ncrows feasted on our land, and ever as birds of ill omen.\" He turned\nand, with a weary sigh, surveyed the group of loyal, but anxious\nsouls. \"I thank ye. Will ye still do my bidding and help to save our\nsovereign lord?\"\n\nOut flashed the swords of a dozen-odd nobles as they raised the\nhoarse, ringing cry of \"Altorius! Altorius! Supreme!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA little later Nelson, before a very mistrustful gathering composed of\nHero Giles, Hero John and two or three other veterans, traced the\nbarest outline of his plan.\n\n\"You understand? I'm to be taken to the border as a prisoner; then, in\nplain sight of the enemy lines, the guards must maltreat me and turn\nme loose.\"\n\nThe aviator searched one after another of the brutal, war-like faces,\nwhile Hero Giles translated for the benefit of two Atlantean generals\nwho did not speak the royal language.\n\n\"Are you positive,\" Alden demanded of Hero John, \"that this revolution\nin Atlans will die out if Altara is returned?\"\n\n\"Yes! A thousand times yes!\" The prince's fine eyes gleamed with\nsavage enthusiasm. \"With the Sacred Virgin restored to Atlans, new\ncourage will come into the phalanxes! The priests will cease their\noutcries against them. Then, with the help of the blue maxima vapor,\nwe will rend the dog-begotten followers of Jereboam limb from limb!\"\n\n\"All right.\" Nelson's wiry khaki-clad body bent far over the table.\n\"Remember, Hero Giles, that part of the fighting's up to you. When I'm\ngone, you'll do exactly what Alden tells you. Now, one thing more:\nwhat part of the border is still unquestionably loyal?\"\n\nHero Giles frowned and shrugged his armor-clad shoulders a little\nhelplessly beneath the splendid cloak of imperial green. \"The gods\nalone know; but at the third division of this morning, Mayda and\nThebes still vowed their loyalty. 'Tis there are quartered the\nphalanxes of the Imperial guards. They alone can I trust to the\ndeath.\"\n\n\"All right.\" Bending over a huge parchment map of the valley, Nelson\nnodded, and his keen black eyes became very serious. \"I want you to\nconcentrate every man you can muster in each of those cities.\nMeanwhile tell the populace,\"--he drew a deep breath--\"that Altara\nwill certainly be returned to them.\"\n\n\"Art thou sure?\" broke in the scarred veteran in the dented breast\nplate; then, his brow dark with doubt, he engaged Hero Giles and the\nrest in a heated, low-voiced colloquy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlden stepped near, an anxious frown on his unshaven features. \"Think\nthis idea of yours is sure-fire?\"\n\n\"No,\" Nelson's lean head shook. \"I'm far from sure. It's a wild gamble\nat best, but we can't be any worse off than we are now. If the priests\nwin out, we're sunk and no mistake about it; but there's a fighting\nchance my idea could be brought off.\"\n\n\"Now look here,\" objected the younger pilot tensely. \"What's this rot\nabout your going into Jarmuth alone? How d'you know they won't skin\nyou alive once you're over the border?\"\n\n\"I don't,\" admitted his friend, shrugging slightly. \"But I don't see\nthere's anything but to take the risk. If I don't go over there, sure\nas shooting we're going to feed some damn unpleasant kind of beast\nhere in Atlans.\n\n\"Another thing,\" Nelson said, turning to the Hero who, surrounded by\nthe others, was bent in deep consultation over a map. \"How am I to\nknow Altara if I see her? Is there a statue, a painting or\nsomething--?\"\n\nThe Hero's aquiline features lit in a slow smile. \"Nay, we have better\nthan that. Come, thou shalt see the Sacred Virgin as she now is.\"\n\nThe members of the conference followed Hero Giles down a short\ncorridor, through a couple of doors and into a chamber where a huge\ndisc of crystal stood on edge fixed upon an axis above a bewildering\narray of wires, pipes and gauges.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHero John, who seemed familiar with the mechanism, turned a lever,\nwhereupon the disc commenced to spin like a pie plate on a dance\nfloor. Faster and faster it spun, silently gathering speed each second\nwhile a low humming sound filled the chamber. Gradually the outline of\nthe whirling disk commenced to brighten, tinting the scar-seamed,\ncraggy features of the Atlantean generals and picking glorious,\nglowing lights from the jewels on Hero Giles' wonderfully engraved\nbreastplate.\n\n\"Ah.\" Hero John turned a small dial. \"The crystal warms. Look, oh\nWanderers!\"\n\nNelson rubbed his eyes incredulously, for in the heart of the\nshimmering circle had materialized the outline of a room with walls of\nyellow marble.\n\n\"Well, I'm damned!\" gasped Alden. \"See how it flickers!\"\n\nAs the revolving disc of crystal gained top speed, the flickering\nsubsided and a picture, clearer than most photographs, could be seen\nin the center. A wondrously slender, yellow-haired young girl clad in\nGrecian robes of pale blue sat in deep despond upon a plain wooden\ncouch, with a black haired servant kneeling before her, apparently\nlacing sandals on her tiny, pink-hued feet.\n\n\"Bring closer the face,\" snapped Hero Giles gruffly.\n\nGradually the focus changed, like the close-up of a movie camera,\nuntil in the center of the madly whirling disc could be seen in minute\ndetail and living color the face of an indescribably lovely girl.\n\n\"Whew,\" muttered Nelson, staring in silent amazement. \"No wonder they\nwant her back! She makes Ziegfeld's little girls look like Armenian\nrefugees.\" He cast a sidewise glance, but Alden had apparently not\nheard him; the younger American stood gazing with rapturous joy at the\ngirl.\n\n\"Aye! Aye!\" The two veteran generals uttered stifled groans and one of\nthem drew a hand across his eyes. \"Poseidon save her! Aye! Preserve\nthe fair Altara.\"\n\n\"Wouldst thou not doubly save her, now?\" demanded Hero John in a low\nvoice that bespoke his anguish. He seemed suddenly older than the\ngrim, helmeted veterans to either side.\n\n\"You bet! I guess a man sees a face like that only once is a lifetime.\nAnd now,\" Nelson continued with an effort to return to the practical,\n\"there's no time to be lost--so I'd just like to take a look at those\npteranodons of yours.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few minutes later, the two aviators found themselves nearing a lofty\nstructure which adjoined the imperial palace. It was constructed along\nthe lines of an immense aviary. Between beautiful, glistening Ionic\ncolumns of white marble, gleamed bronze bars, set at regular intervals\nto prevent the escape of the most appalling creatures which could ever\nhave skimmed the air.\n\n\"What in the devil is your idea?\" demanded Alden, taken aback. \"God,\nlook at the loathsome brutes!\"\n\nSome of these huge, flying reptiles were hopping awkwardly over the\nground picking at bones and refuse littering the floor with long\npelican-like bills, which were, however, very much thicker than those\nof pelicans, and set with sharp teeth at least six inches long.\n\n\"Not very pretty are they? Kind of look like huge bats,\" commented\nNelson thoughtfully. \"Wonder if they could be handled?\"\n\n\"Yes, their wings are leathery. Look at 'em up yonder.\" Alden pointed\nto the roof of that immense aviary where, hanging head downwards like\ngigantic bats, must have been hundreds upon hundreds of the\npteranodons. One of them, whistling oddly, fluttered up to the bars,\naffording the Wanderers an excellent view of a loathsome head, the\nback of which ended in a curious sort of horn, that, projecting\nbackwards, jutted far above its rear. Fierce, vermillion eyes with\ngreen irises glared at the Americans through the bars, and great wings\nof greasy-looking leather fanned a disgusting stench from the interior\nof the aviary.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Sweet little things,\" was Alden's comment. \"God! Imagine having one\nof those great things swooping down on you. Hey, Alden, look at that\nbig devil over there! He must have a wing spread of thirty feet. Big\nas a Moth plane, isn't he?\"\n\nFor answer the pteranodon clattered its vast beak savagely. One of the\ngenerals stooped and, catching up a huge slab of meat from a basket\nnearby, hurled it through the bars into the gaping jaws.\n\n\"What would ye with these creature?\" demanded Hero Giles with\nundisguised curiosity.\n\n\"You'd be surprised.\" Nelson was not deliberately rude, but his mind\nwas wrapped up in the daring project he had evolved. \"I want a couple\nof the biggest of these caught and set aside in a courtyard where\nthere will be no one looking on. If your people can train and handle\npodokos and allosauri--I guess a couple of Yanks ought to be able to\nmanage these flying nightmares. So don't you worry about us.\"\n\nHero Giles uttered grim, significant laugh. \"Thou hadst best manage\nthem. I note yonder pteranodon is in need of nourishment.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nWith sharp anxiety, Victor Nelson kept watching the towers of Jezreel\nrise ever clearer above the great, warm plain of Jarmuth, but, for all\nthat, he noted how distinctly Jezreel differed from Heliopolis. The\nJarmuthian capital was predominantly amber-yellow instead of white in\ncolor; its towers were flat-topped, angular, hideous structures that\ncompared not at all favorably with the graceful Grecian architecture\nof Atlantean public buildings.\n\nThe populace, he decided, as he strode along in the midst of half a\ndozen silent guards, were as harsh and graceless as their\narchitecture. Whereas the Atlanteans had been white skinned and\nuniformly red haired--save for those of Hudsonian blood--the\ninhabitants of Jarmuth almost without exception were black haired and\nhad dark, olive-hued skins.\n\n\"They're the lost tribes of Israel, all right,\" Nelson decided after a\nbrief sojourn in that savage land lying beyond Apidanus--the great\nboiling river, whose bubbling and scalding currents had for centuries\nserved as a natural boundary between the two realms. But now the\nJarmuthian armies had crossed it and were steadily pushing back the\ndemoralized and despairing Atlanteans with savage energy that heaped\nthe dead in hillocks.\n\n\"Their armor,\" mused the ragged, barefoot prisoner, studying his\nsilent guards, \"looks a lot like a Roman legionnaire's, but that six\npointed star on their helmets is pure Semitic. Yes, this sure is an\nAsiatic outfit.\"\n\nHis eyes wandered from one fierce, big-nosed infantryman to another\nand noted the splendid physical structure of the majority. Evidently\nhardier, much less refined and luxury-loving than the Atlanteans,\nthese swart warriors disdained robes and other garments. Save for\nhelmet, armor and brief black kilts, they were quite naked. Like the\nAtlantean hoplites the infantrymen carried spears, steam retortii and\nquantities of grenades.\n\nThe country side through which the prisoner passed had a holiday air,\nfor garlands of flowers hung in every doorway, and naked, pot-bellied\nchildren squatted by the roadside, industriously weaving crowns and\nstreamers of gay blossoms.\n\n\"Look, Atlantean dog!\" commanded the black-bearded leader of the\nescort. \"Let thine infidel eyes gaze upon the mightiest city of the\nworld. Seest thou yonder Ziggurat which o'er towers all others?\"\n\nNelson raised eyes red-rimmed from sleeplessness and deep anxiety--for\nthe crafty Jarmuthians had proved unexpectedly unwilling to credit him\nas the Atlantean outcast and would-be renegade he had pretended to be.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said in reply to the English-speaking\n_jehar's_--captain's--question. \"What's it for?\"\n\n\"'Tis the temple of the almighty Beelzebub, Steam God of Jarmuth.\nWithout his hot breath no wheel would turn, our armies would be\npowerless and this land would perish under the ice of the outer\nworld.\" The dark eyed officer's eye fell speculatively upon his bound\nand dust-covered prisoner. \"Perchance, dog of a spy, thou wilt die\nduring to-day's fourth division[2] together with Altara, pale daughter\nof the feeble, false god Poseidon.\"\n\n[Footnote 2: The Atlantean day was divided into six divisions of four\nhours each; due to the flame suns there was no sunrise or sunset.]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis afternoon?\n\nNelson could not realize that the time had flown so quickly. Four\nshort hours separated him from the crisis of his life. A thousand\ndoubts assailed him. What if Alden or Hero Giles failed in their share\nof the great scheme for rescue? Narrowly, the aviator's eye searched\nthe great, rich plain, then swept the amber-hued sky where, far above\nthe plain, Jilboa, the nearest flame sun, beat off the Arctic chill\nand darkness.\n\nThe great, black-bearded jehar eased the straps from which was\nsuspended the brass coil of his retortii. \"Aye,\" he chuckled, his\nthick lips parted in a crafty smile. \"Ere long will the fair flesh of\nAltara grace the ceremonial board of His Exaltation, the King, and his\npriests and princes.\"\n\nNelson gasped in horror. The divinely beautiful Altara--butchered for\nmeat like a calf? Grotesque! Ghastly! \"What! You eat your prisoners?\"\nHe felt sick, nauseated.\n\nFor answer, the swart Jarmuthian raised an enormous hand and dealt the\ncaptive American a stinging cuff which made his teeth rattle.\n\n\"Peace!\" he snarled. \"Else I slit thy spying throat ere we pass yonder\nwalls.\"\n\nFingering a short blue-black beard that was frizzed into tight curls\nin the Assyrian manner, the jehar lengthened his stride as the little\ndetachment clanked into the shadow of a great wall surrounding\nJezreel, and through a huge gate guarded by two hideous, jackal-headed\neffigies.\n\nHurrying into the city were throngs of eager men, women and children,\ninterspersed with muscular, black bearded soldiers who cast\nthreatening, baleful eyes on the pale-skinned prisoner.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt first the great metropolis of Jezreel seemed boundless, for\neverywhere arose tall, massive monuments of yellow marble whose\nfacades were engraved with Sanskrit characters, thus bearing out\nNelson's surmise that this was indeed a race of Semitic origin.\n\nHere and there hurried grey-bearded, vulture-eyed priests oddly garbed\nin corrupt Occhive and Tyrian regalia. Nelson found it odd to see the\nTablet of the Laws, which Jarmuth so openly ignored, swaying on their\nyellow robed breasts; and none cried out more menacingly nor more\nloudly against the limping, wan-faced captive, than these same\necclesiastics, who must have long since forgotten all worship of\nJehovah in the foul service of a bestial golden effigy.\n\nA stone sailed through the air, narrowly missing the American; then\nanother, which struck his shoulder.\n\n\"God, what a rough looking crowd,\" thought Nelson, as the guards,\ncursing, held back the screaming mob. \"At this rate I won't live to\neven reach the temple!\"\n\nEvery second his life stood in great danger. Unkempt, sloe-eyed women\nhurled themselves, shrieking with fury, against the armored chests of\nthe guards, who were hard pressed to beat them off with their spear\nhafts.\n\nNelson's one small ray of comfort in this evil hour was the fact that\nhis .45 pistol remained untouched in a food wallet. At the border the\njehar had cast one contemptuous glance at the weapon, but, no doubt\ndeeming it some strange culinary tool, he had made no effort to remove\nit.\n\nIt was a continual struggle for the guards to win their way up a long\nflight of stairs, for ever the great stream of humanity grew denser\nand more menacing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNelson felt a violent sense of revolt grip his being. \"I must win\nfree,\" he thought. \"If I fail, Alden dies, and--and--\" For the first\ntime he realised how much he wanted to actually see Altara. Like a\nclear cameo, an image of her had remained fresh in his memory. Except\nfor her Grecian garments she might have been a lovely, carefree\nEnglish or American girl.\n\n\"And these decadent swine would sacrifice her!\" The thought was\nsickening. Yet how could he prevent the pitiful tragedy?\n\nFortunately, a detachment of troops--tall, sinewy fellows with conical\nhelmets, crested with six-pointed stars--reenforced the guards just as\nclawing hands began to snatch and tug at the prisoner's ragged\nAtlantean chiton of blue cotton.\n\nAlmost before he realized it, Nelson was dragged inside a great gloomy\nbuilding and into a circular chamber where four eagle-featured elders\nsat in council beneath the six-pointed star of Sem. On approaching,\nthe jehar in command sank on one knee and in humble salute raised both\nhands to the tribunal.\n\n\"A tough looking desk sergeant they've got,\" muttered the prisoner to\nhimself as his eye met the chilling regard of a lean, yellow-faced\npriest. \"Wonder what I'm booked for?\" Idiotically, he recalled being\nsummoned before a traffic court, years back. \"Guess I don't get off\nwith vagrancy; it'll probably be everything from speeding to mayhem,\nwith maybe arson and well-poisoning thrown in.\"\n\nThe deliberations of this ominous court proved to be appallingly\nshort. The dour-faced elders merely put their heads together, muttered\na few sentences, then straightened up almost immediately. The chief\npriest--he with the yellow face--thrust out his fist and made the\nimmemorial signal of death by jerking his thumb at the black marble\nfloor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore the outraged and astounded aviator could utter a word of\nprotest, powerful guards seized and hauled him off down a dark, narrow\npassageway in which the fetid prison smell was very strong. Too wise\nto struggle against overwhelming odds, yet appalled at the thought of\nhis impending doom, Nelson was dragged into a room where four or five\nfurtive, enslaved Atlanteans, made dumb by the removal of their\ntongues, were engaged in a curious occupation.\n\nOn a bare stone bench, five other Atlantean captives were sitting in\nmiserable silence. They made a grotesque array, for their heads were\ncrowned with gay yellow and blue flowers, and the upper half of their\nperfectly formed bodies gleamed with an application of a\nsweet-smelling oil. About their wrists and waists were twined fragrant\ngarlands of yellow roses which hid the leather straps confining their\nhands.\n\nStruggling, Nelson was forced on to the bench, whereupon slaves,\nskipping to avoid the lash of a scarred, olive-hued slave driver,\nhurried to wash the newly arrived prisoner's limbs, face and hands. A\nweary-looking old slave with sunken, rheumy eyes listlessly pulled the\nblue chiton from Nelson's broad shoulders, and would have removed the\nfood pouch had not the prisoner winked vigorously. The ministering\nslave glanced swiftly sidewise and, discovering the slave driver's\nattention directed to another corner, pulled the upper folds of the\nchiton over the food pouch and its precious contents, then set a crown\nof yellow roses more or less askew on the American's head. For all the\nperil of the situation Nelson could not suppress a fleeting smile as\nthe phrase, \"For I'm to be Queen of the May, Mother,\" leaped\nnonsensically into his brain.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Yes, I guess they are getting us all dolled up for a sacrifice of\nsome kind.\" Nelson's heart began to pound at the thought. Then he\nfought for self control. It must be a hideously realistic nightmare!\nHe, Victor Nelson, American citizen, a quiet birdman, member of the\nCaterpillar Club and ex-flight commander of the A. E. F. was about to\nbe offered as a sacrifice to some hideous, pagan god? Nonsense! He'd\nwake up in a minute and hear the drone of a ship on the line.\n\nHe blinked, staring fixedly at a single ray of light that came\nstreaming in through a small, barred window, then glanced sidewise at\nhis fellow victims, who with Spartan indifference sat waiting for the\nend of all things. It was no dream!\n\nFrom the tiny window came the shrill discordant braying of many\ntrumpets, and a roar like that of a football crowd arose surprisingly\nnear. In response, the slave driver lashed the gaudily bedecked\nsacrificial victims to their feet with vicious cuts of his pliant\nwhip, and herded them like a drove of calves down a very long passage,\nlit at intervals by those strange column lamps of incandescent gas. In\ntheir red glare the doomed six seemed as though already bathed in\nblood.\n\n\"Must be some crowd of people outside,\" muttered Nelson as a great\ngale of sound deafened him. Yonder the amber glare of the flame suns\nglimmered, and now it was his turn to step into the open!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn a sort of spiral roadway he paused, breathless, awed, bewildered,\nfor there, eddying restlessly about the bases of towers and other huge\nstructures, was a great sea of up-turned faces. To his surprise he\nfound the passage he had followed opened perhaps halfway up what must\nbe the great Ziggurat of Beelzebub. He judged the tower's height must\nbe immense, for already the crowd was a good hundred feet below.\n\n\"_Zarotoa! Zarotoa! \u00f9 Wlanka!_\"[3]\n\nNelson shivered. How terrible was the wild, bloodthirsty clamor of\nthat vast throng, when they beheld the six flower-decked prisoners\nappear upon the circular winding road which led to the lofty and\nwind-swept summit of the great conical pyramid of the people of\nJezreel.\n\n[Footnote 3: Death to the victims!]\n\nBehind the victims marched perhaps eighteen or twenty spearmen\ngorgeously uniformed in yellow and black painted armor. Their\nretortii were plated with gold, and in the center of a star forming\nthe crest of each helmet was set a diamond large as a hickory nut.\n\nPreceding the despairing prisoners marched a squad of tall,\nclean-shaven priests with great gold hoops in their ears. They blew\nmightily upon long, curved horns, and were followed by perhaps a dozen\nlithe, posturing girls, half clothed in diaphanous yellow robes. These\npriestesses swung golden censers which flung bluish clouds of aromatic\nsmoke high into the humid air above.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUp and up, around and around the great tower temple, Nelson was\ndragged, while the vast city of Jezreel, palaces, towers, courts,\ndwellings and all, lay like a great panorama below. Up and up, and the\nwind grew stronger while Nelson marvelled at the great height of the\nstructure he was mounting. Immediately in front of him swayed the\nnaked shoulders of the three captive Atlanteans; he could see rose\npetals from their crowns fluttering in the strong warm breeze sweeping\nthat man-made pinnacle for the worship of a heathen god.\n\nDespairingly, the American's eyes searched the horizon, to discover\nnothing but a few great birds wheeling lazily in the bronze-hued sky.\nVery clearly he could discern three of the flame suns, casting flame\nhigh from their peaks.\n\n\"Alden!\" he groaned. \"Oh God, Alden, don't fail me!\"\n\nChilled by the fate in store, he scanned the dark and hostile faces\nbelow, but found no friendly visage.\n\nUp and up. The procession was now nearing the summit.\n\nThere were hosts of poignant problems before him, each vital if Altara\nand the Empire of Atlans were to be saved; but one primary question\nimmediately confronted him. How could he get his hands free? He\nventured a few words in English to the stolid Atlantean at his side,\nwhereat the fellow only stared dully and shook his red, flower-crowned\nhead.\n\nHe next tried to cautiously work loose his hands, but to no avail. The\nrope of plaited skin binding his aching wrists together was tough as\nany rawhide. Cursing, he abandoned the effort, and, as his eyes once\nmore swept the great bloodthirsty throng below, he felt himself doomed\nindeed.\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nStanding at last on the summit of the great Ziggurat, Nelson found\nhimself staring up at the fearsome golden image of the dread demon\nBeelzebub. The god stood some twelve feet in height and had a hideous\nhuman face, but, in place of hair and beard, countless golden tubes\nwrithed in all directions. From the end of one, the puzzled prisoner\nbeheld several tiny feathers of steam creeping forth, indicating that\nthese hairs were a species of steam vent.\n\nWhen, with the other captives, he was made to halt near its base, he\nfurther discovered that the idol sat upon a throne of yellow marble,\nthe sides of which were carved with Sanskrit characters, necessarily\nquite meaningless to the doomed aviator.\n\nIn a grim and silent rank before Beelzebub's feet, stood some six or\neight priest-executioners bending their black-robed bodies against the\nstrong wind which swept that ghastly pinnacle.\n\nJust below the base of the image, Nelson noted several great, copper\ncoils, no doubt conducting steam from the interior of the Ziggurat.\nBetween the knees of Beelzebub rested a huge, shallow bowl, the use of\nwhich puzzled the American not a little, for he saw that the base of\nthis ornate receptacle was also wrapped with a number of steam coils.\nTwo great hands, ending in cruel-looking claws, were stretched\nhorizontally above the demon's knees, seeming to plead for victims.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly a deep toned brazen gong sounded somewhere below; the\ntrumpeters blew an ear-piercing note; and, at a gesture from the high\npriest, four of the brawny executioner-priests leaped forward, seized\none of the Atlantean victims, hurled him to the stone platform and, in\nan unbelievably short interval, strapped the shrieking wretch by\nwrists, elbows, knees and ankles to a long, brass rod. Slung like a\ndead deer from a rail, they lifted the helpless Atlantean, and, while\nfive hundred thousand voices roared in acclaim the priests fitted the\npole ends into notches above the hands of the idol with the effect\nthat the idol actually seemed to be clutching its victim.\n\nThen, from all the pipes composing the hair and beard of Beelzebub,\nsprang forth hissing spouts of snowy steam which, whipped by the\nrising wind, went whirling madly down the lee of the Ziggurat. At the\nsame time, from the half open mouth of the demon issued a fearful,\nscreaming howl, a thousand times louder than the whistle of a speeding\nlocomotive. Deafening and barbaric, it was reechoed from a hundred\ntowers and battlements.\n\nA dreadful, exultant yell burst from the multitude below as the\nred-robed priest drew from beneath his garments a sickle-shaped knife\nthat glittered evilly in the light of the flaming suns. Still\nchanting, he stooped and quickly made a deep incision over the heart\nof the victim. While a piercing, agonized shriek burst from the ashen\nlips of the doomed Atlantean, his bright life-blood began to splash\ninto the golden bowl below where, due to the presence of the steam\ncoils, it swiftly commenced to hiss and bubble. Very quickly the last\nscarlet drops had fallen.\n\nThen while Nelson, sick and horrified, stood watching, the dead body\non its pole was taken down, unstrapped, and hurled, limp and\nred-spattered, to the next lower platform where other priests waited\nto dismember it for the ceremonial cannibalism soon to follow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn rapid succession two more victims were slaughtered amid the\nblood-hungry cheers of the Jarmuthian populace. Now the great bowl\nhissed and bubbled with a generous supply of the dark red fluid, from\nwhich rose clouds of evil-smelling steam that fanned the hideous\nfeatures above.\n\nFrom below suddenly arose an excited shout far mightier than any which\nhad preceded it, when the executioners, sweating from their exertions,\nnow turned and, spying Nelson, hurried forward. Coincidently, the\nAmerican's bound hands disappeared beneath the chiton. Squaring his\nshoulders, he gripped the pistol, prepared to make a good end.\n\n\"They'll get me, but before I die I'll send at least two or three of\nthese devils to hell,\" he thought. \"Come on--\"\n\nBut, for an inexplicable reason, the arch-priest beckoned back his\nsatellites, while roar upon roar of terrific excitement swelled from\nthe swarming mob below, and a shout which at last became\ndistinguishable bid fair to split the heavens. \"Altara! Altara!\nAltara!\"\n\nSlowly, the temporarily reprieved victim's muscles stiffened. He\nunderstood. The next victim was to be the fair Altara, sister of\nAltorius and Sacred Virgin of Atlans.\n\n\"Altara! Altara!\" A rising hurricane of impassioned human voices\nthundered the name.\n\nSuddenly, the desire to live burned doubly strong in the American's\nbreast. He must somehow prevent this inhuman catastrophe. But how?\nHow?\n\nStealing a quick glance over his shoulder, Nelson stifled a groan. The\nsouthern horizon remained clear, and put an end to hope. No help! He\nmust fight it out to the end alone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA rank of exultant, black-bearded priests now appeared at the head of\nthe stairway, then a quartet of olive skinned, semi-naked priestesses\njoyfully clashing brass cymbals.\n\nThere came an interval--and Nelson's heart stood still as there\nappeared the lovely head and shoulders of her whom he had first seen\nin the heart of the revolving crystal. Even more fiercely, mad revolt\nat fate gripped him.\n\nThrough hot, strained eyes the American saw that the stately Altara\nwas beautiful beyond all possible comparison, and that she seemed\nutterly unafraid in the hour of her dreadful death. The Atlantean\nmaiden's large, clear blue eyes were fixed with calm resignation on\nthe distant flame sun of Jilboa. On her curling golden hair had been\nset a circlet of ceremonial yellow roses, while her white, slender\nbody was thinly covered with a scanty robe of yellow silk.\n\nSlowly, and moving her small bare feet in a regal stride, Altara\nclimbed the last few steps and stood straight and unafraid before the\nhideous demon god of Jarmuth.\n\nThousands of frantic inner voices assailed the aviator's\nconsciousness. \"Save her! You must save her! She's too young, too\nbeautiful to die!\"\n\nLike a vast maelstrom of sound, so swelled the lustful cry of the dark\nmultitude at the base of the Ziggurat, while the arch-priest chanted\nhis litany in a sort of triumphant exultation. Then, all at once, one\nof the executioners roughly tripped the golden haired girl, sprawling\nher helpless on the bloody stones; and, before Nelson could quite\nrealize it, the slender, silver hued form lay limp and helpless\nbetween Beelzebub's bloody claws.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLike a dynamo furiously gathering speed, so buzzed Nelson's brain. He\nwas going to save her--if only for a brief interval! One man against a\nnation. Through a raging mist of fury he saw the red-robed priest\nraise his lean arms; then the American's bound hands darted beneath\nthe blue chiton to reappear immediately. No one saw the pistol, for\nevery eye was rivetted upon the gleaming, sickle-knife of the red\npriest. Like a voice from hell, that eery scream burst again from\nBeelzebub's throat as his priest stepped near, the knife raised.\n\nAmid a deafening roar the sickle-knife flashed higher; but it never\nfell, for the red priest suddenly reeled, clutched his chest and,\nstaring wildly, staggered sidewise, while the assembled priests stared\nthunderstruck. The deafening roar of Beelzebub, the clamor of horns\nand cymbals had drowned out the report. In superstitious awe the\nJarmuthians leaped back, panic-stricken, from the convulsively\nwrithing body of the red priest, which rolled crazily down the steps\nbefore the idol; but a high shout of terror rang out as he toppled off\nthe summit and, like a discarded puppet, plunged down the precipitous\nside of the cone-like tower.\n\nAgain Nelson's pistol spat, and two of the executioners collapsed in\nkicking agony. Like an avenging fury, the American raged about the\nsummit, the pistol in his bound bands dealing death right and left\nuntil panic seized the remaining priests, who, with one accord,\nabandoned their weapons to rush headlong down the dizzy, winding\nroadway. In a trice, none but Altara, Nelson, the two Atlanteans and\nthe fallen priests remained on the summit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the work of a moment for the Atlanteans to cast loose Nelson's\nbound wrists, and he theirs; time was precious, for, from below, a\nfurious cohort of spearmen were charging up the stairs, their dark\nfeatures terrible in their wrath.\n\n\"Only four more shots!\" The sickening realization dashed into Nelson's\nbrain. \"That'll never stop them.\" Then in the midst of his despair he\nsaw an answer. Stepping back he fired twice full into the great steam\ncoil circling the base of the idol.\n\n_Spang! Spang!_ His bullets smacked through the copper coil to\npuncture neat, round holes. As he fervently hoped, jets of live steam\nrushed through these vents with terrible force and bathed the head of\nthe stairs with a scalding, blinding vapor. Howling like mad beasts,\nthe agonized Jarmuthian hoplites fell back, while overhead Beelzebub\nbellowed incessantly, shaking the sky with his hideous voice.\n\n\"That's better.\" But Nelson knew his triumph to be brief. \"_Where in\nhell is Alden?_\" he raged as with shaking hands be released the\nbewildered girl from the death bar after the two Atlanteans had lifted\nit and its fair burden from the claws of Beelzebub.\n\nPicking up the swords and other weapons of the fallen priests the two\nAtlanteans uttered their deep-toned war cry of _Halor v\u00e0n!_ and\njoyously prepared to die fighting, as furious roar on roar of wrath\narose from the populace, infuriated at being cheated of their prey.\nBut the black-armored temple guards dared not charge those twin steam\njets barring their approach. Accordingly they tried other means.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNelson's heart stopped as a small, dark object sailed up from below\nand clattered on the platform. It was a grenade. With the speed of\nthought, the American kicked it to the landing below, where it\nexploded, annihilating a detachment of Jarmuthians by drenching them\nwith the terrible fungus gas. Heart bounding with savage joy, Nelson\nwatched the deadly green fog leap from the broken grenade and of its\nown accord settle on the nearest soldiers. With the usual astonishing\nspeed there formed on the stricken soldiery that poisonous yellow\nmould, whose fungus-like shoots sprouted through nostrils and mouths.\nOn the dense crowd below the bomb's effect was appalling, and no more\ngrenades were hurled....\n\nDuring the respite Nelson's anguished eyes once more swept the skies.\nHe started. Was it true or was it a mirage? Far to the southward a\nsmall, black speck materialized in the orange-hued heavens. Good old\nAlden! Hope wavered in the American's breast. Could he and his two\nfellows beat off the infuriated Jarmuthians long enough? He doubted\nit.\n\nA shower of spears sailed up, but because of the angle, their\ntrajectory was too great, and like rays of death the lances flashed\nharmlessly overhead to plunge over the summit and wreak death among\nthose on the other side.\n\nNearer and nearer came the black speck while from the populace a low\nshout of amazement arose. Coincidently Nelson's heart stopped; aghast,\nhe saw that the steam was no longer hissing from the holes at the\nidol's feet! Evidently, the steam current had been shut off from below\nto allow the raging priests to lead their followers in a desperate\ncharge up the stairs.\n\nMarshalling an Atlantean to either side, Nelson sprang to the head of\nthe stair and fired full in the face of gorgeously robed priests who\nstaggered back screaming. But the others wavered only an instant.\n\n\"_Halor v\u00e0n!_\" Both Atlanteans hurled spears retrieved from the\nabandoned weapons--and each struck down his man.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe American's eye flickered up. Yes, there came a strange, but\nwelcome sight: a great creature with enormous, leathery pinions was\ncircling down towards the tower top! A clashing of weapons brought\nNelson's eyes earthwards. He joined in a furious mel\u00e9e at the stair\ntop, like the Atlanteans, using a captured bronze sword. There came a\ndeep groan as the right-hand Atlantean collapsed with a bloodied\nbronze spear point standing far out from between his naked shoulder\nblades.\n\nA swooping shadow fell across the slowly advancing attackers.\nBeholding that awesome creature the Jarmuthians cowered, hesitated;\nthen in headlong panic they darted below, uttering howls of fear and\npursued by the surviving Atlantean, who, gone berserk, must have\nshortly paid for his folly.\n\nThe pteranodon was now quite recognizable, and seated on a double\nsaddle was Alden, skillfully guiding the ungainly monster by means of\na curious bridle, by shifting his weight and by pressing certain nerve\ncenters between the great reptile's leathery shoulders.\n\nDown, down circled Alden until the great wings skimmed just above\nBeelzebub's ugly golden head.\n\nHer courage strained beyond endurance, Altara screamed shrilly in fear\nas Alden guided the huge reptile to the summit and forced it to light.\n\n\"Quick!\" shouted Alden. \"They're coming back up!\"\n\n\"All right!\" Catching up the fainting girl, Nelson hurdled two or\nthree fallen bodies, and, while Alden showered fungus bombs upon the\nreturning Jarmuthians, he laid his precious burden across the saddle\nand secured her with straps specially designed for the purpose.\n\n\"All right, Dick,\" he snapped. \"Get going!\"\n\n\"But you?\" Alden's brown face was terribly intent.\n\n\"I'm not going! This creature could never carry the three of us. It\ncan't, I tell you! Hurry, those devils are coming!\"\n\nAlden folded his arms. \"If you don't go, I don't.\"\n\n\"All right then,\" snarled Nelson, vaulting into the saddle after\ncasting loose the inert, yellow-robed girl. \"Be a damned fool! We'll\nall die now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a near thing, for the pteranodon, scenting the fresh blood, was\nvery loath to obey its master, and scuffed awkwardly around the tower\ntop two or three times, while Nelson, clutching Altara to him,\nexpended his last shot in driving back the enemy.\n\nAt last, the pteranodon spread its huge brown pinions and took off.\nThen Nelson gasped in alarm, for, unaccustomed to the heavy weight it\nnow bore, the pteranodon scaled earthwards with the speed of a meteor,\nwildly flapping its bat-like-wings. Down! Down! Nelson had an\nimpression of people scattering like frightened ants.\n\nAlden cursed, tugged furiously on the bridle, and set his weight back\nin the saddle, but to no avail. Down! Ever down! The pteranodon now\nstruggled among the tall buildings.\n\nA sickening sense of defeat gripped Nelson as a long jet of steam shot\nout from a huge brass retortii mounted on the roof of an arsenal. The\nscalding fingers of steam just missed its target, but fortunately\nserved to sting the descending pteranodon. With a convulsive shudder\nand a whistling scream, the hideous reptile commenced to flap its\ngigantic wings faster, and, slowly but surely, began to rise over the\nyellow temples and towers of the barbarous city of Jezreel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat followed is now a matter of Atlantean history. On its pages is\nset forth in full detail how the giant pteranodon barely crossed the\nboiling river to sink exhausted in the outskirts of Tricca.\n\nThere, also, is described the series of tremendous battles in which\nthe Atlanteans, led by Altorius and inspired by the return of their\nSacred Virgin, employed the terrible fungus gas to overwhelm the\nJarmuthian invaders, driving them back with great slaughter to the\nsteaming plains of their own land.\n\nAt even greater length is described the great triumph Altorius\naccorded the victorious aviators on the occasion of Victor Nelson's\nmarriage to Altara.\n\n\"Doth it not seem strange,\" she whispered as they stood looking out\nover the great, sleeping city of Heliopolis, \"that thou of the New\nWorld and I of the Lost World, should stand man and wife?\"\n\nThe American's tanned face softened. \"My darling,\" he whispered,\n\"there are lots of strange things in the new Atlantis--but this isn't\none of them.\"\n\n_(The End.)_\n\n\n\n\nThe Meteor Girl\n\n_By Jack Williamson_\n\n[Illustration: _She seemed to scream, though we could hear nothing._]\n\n[Sidenote: Through the complicated space-time of the fourth dimension\ngoes Charlie King in an attempt to rescue the Meteor Girl.]\n\n\n\"What's the good in Einstein, anyhow?\"\n\nI shot the question at lean young Charlie King. In a moment he looked\nup at me; I thought there was pain in the back of his clear brown\neyes. Lips closed in a thin white line across his wind-tanned face;\nnervously he tapped his pipe on the metal cowling of the _Golden\nGull's_ cockpit.\n\n\"I know that space is curved, that there is really no space or time,\nbut only space-time, that electricity and gravitation and magnetism\nare all the same. But how is that going to pay my grocery bill--or\nyours?\"\n\n\"That's what Virginia wants to know.\"\n\n\"Virginia Randall!\" I was astonished. \"Why, I thought--\"\n\n\"I know. We've been engaged a year. But she's called it off.\"\n\nCharlie looked into my eyes for a long minute, his lips still\ncompressed. We were leaning on the freshly painted, streamline\nfuselage of the _Golden Gull_, as neat a little amphibian monoplane as\never made three hundred miles an hour. She stood on the glistening\nwhite sand of our private landing field on the eastern Florida coast.\nBelow us the green Atlantic was running in white foam on the rocks.\n\nIn the year that Charlie King and I had been out of the Institute of\nTechnology, we had built the nucleus of a commercial airplane\nbusiness. We had designed and built here in our own shops several very\nsuccessful seaplanes and amphibians. Charlie's brilliant mathematical\nmind was of the greatest aid, except when he was too far lost in his\nabstruse speculations to descend to things commercial. Mathematics is\npainful enough to me when it is used in calculating the camber of an\nairplane wing. And pure mathematics, such as the theories of\nrelativity and equivalence, I simply abhor.\n\nI was amazed. Virginia Randall was a girl trim and beautiful as our\nshining _Golden Gull_. I had thought them devotedly in love, and had\nbeen looking forward to the wedding.\n\n\"But it isn't two weeks, since Virginia was out here! You took her up\nin our _Western Gull IV_!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNervously Charlie lit his pipe, drew quickly on it. His face, lean and\ndrawn beneath the flying goggles pushed up on his forehead, sought\nmine anxiously.\n\n\"I know. I drove her back to the station. That was when--when we\nquarreled.\"\n\n\"But why? About Einstein? That's silly.\"\n\n\"She wanted me to give it up here, and go in with her father in his\nWall Street brokerage business. The old gent is willing to take me,\nand make a business man of me.\"\n\n\"Why, I couldn't run the business without you, Charlie!\"\n\n\"We talked about that, Hammond. I don't really do much of the work.\nJust play around with the mathematics, and leave the models and\nblueprints to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Charlie, that's not quite--\"\n\n\"It's the truth, right enough,\" he said, bitterly. \"You design\naircraft, and I play with Einstein. And as you say, a fellow can't eat\nequations.\"\n\n\"I'd hate to see you go.\"\n\n\"And I'd hate to give up you, and our business, and the math. Really\nno need of it. My tastes are simple enough. And old 'Iron-clad'\nRandall has made all one family needs. Virginia's not exactly a\npauper, herself. Two or three millions, I think.\"\n\n\"And where did Virginia go?\"\n\n\"She took the _Valhalla_ yesterday at San Francisco. Going to join her\nfather at Panama. He cruises about the world in his steam yacht, you\nknow, and runs Wall Street by radio. I was to telegraph her if I'd\nchanged my mind. I decided to stick to you, Hammond. I telegraphed a\ncorsage of orchids, and sent her the message, 'Einstein forever!'\"\n\n\"If I know Virginia, those were not very politic words.\"\n\n\"Well, a man--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis words were cut short by a very unusual incident.\n\nA thin, high scream came suddenly from above our neat stuccoed hangars\nat the edge of the white field. I looked up quickly, to catch a\nglimpse of a bright object hurtling through the air above our heads.\nThe bellowing scream ended abruptly in a thunderous crash. I felt a\ntremor of the ground underfoot.\n\n\"What--\" I ejaculated.\n\n\"Look!\" cried Charlie.\n\nHe pointed. I looked over the gleaming metal wing of the _Golden\nGull_, to see a huge cloud of white sand rising like a fountain at the\nfarther side of the level field. Deliberately the column of debris\nrose, spread, rained down, leaving a gaping crater in the earth.\n\n\"Something fell?\"\n\n\"It sounded like a shell from a big gun, except that it didn't\nexplode. Let's get over and see!\"\n\nWe ran to where the thing had struck, three hundred yards across the\nfield. We found a great funnel-shaped pit torn in the naked earth. It\nwas a dozen yards across, fifteen feet deep, and surrounded with a\npowdery ring of white sand and pulverized rock.\n\n\"Something like a shell-hole,\" I observed.\n\n\"I've got it!\" Charlie cried. \"It was a meteor!\"\n\n\"A meteor? So big?\"\n\n\"Yes. Lucky for us it was no bigger. If it had been like the one that\nfell in Siberia a few years ago, or the one that made the Winslow\ncrater in Arizona--we wouldn't have been talking about it. Probably we\nhave a chunk of nickel-iron alloy here.\"\n\n\"I'll get some of the men out here with digging tools, and we'll see\nwhat we can find.\"\n\nOur mechanics were already hurrying across the field. I shouted at\nthem to bring picks and shovels. In a few minutes five of us were at\nwork throwing sand and shattered rock out of the pit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly I noticed a curious thing. A pale bluish mist hung in the\nbottom of the pit. It was easily transparent, no denser than tobacco\nsmoke. Passing my spade through it did not seem to disturb it in the\nleast.\n\nI rubbed my eyes doubtfully, said to Charlie, \"Do you see a sort of\nblue haze in the pit?\"\n\nHe peered. \"No. No.... Yes. Yes, I do! Funny thing. Kind of a blue\nfog. And the tools cut right through it without moving it! Queer! Must\nhave something to do with the meteor!\" He was very excited.\n\nWe dug more eagerly. An hour later we had opened the hole to a depth\nof twenty feet. Our shovels were clanging on the gray iron of the rock\nfrom space. The mist had grown thicker as the excavation deepened; we\nlooked at the stone through a screen of motionless blue fog.\n\nWe had found the meteor. There were several queer things about it. The\nfirst man who touched it--a big Swede mechanic named Olson--was\nknocked cold as if by a nasty jolt of electricity. It took half an\nhour to bring him to consciousness.\n\nAs fast as the rugged iron side of the meteorite was uncovered, a\nwhite crust of frost formed over it.\n\n\"It was as cold as outer space, nearly at the absolute zero,\" Charlie\nexplained. \"And it was heated only superficially during its quick\npassage through the air. But how it comes to be charged with\nelectricity--I can't say.\"\n\nHe hurried up to his laboratory behind the hangars, where he had\nequipment ranging from an astronomical telescope to a delicate\nseismograph. He brought back as much electrical equipment as he could\ncarry. He had me touch an insulated wire to the frost-covered stone\nfrom space, while he put the other end to one post of a galvanometer.\n\nI think he got a current that wrecked the instrument. At any rate, he\ngrew very much excited.\n\n\"Something queer about that stone!\" he cried. \"This is the chance of a\nlifetime! I don't know that a meteor has ever been scientifically\nexamined so soon after falling.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe hurried us all across to the laboratory. We came back with a truck\nload of coils and tubes and batteries and potentiometers and other\nassorted equipment. He had men with heavy rubber gloves lift the\nfrost-covered stone to a packing box on a bench. The thing was\nirregular in shape, about a foot long; it must have weighed two\nhundred pounds. He sent a man racing on a motorcycle to the drug store\nto get dry ice (solidified carbon dioxide) to keep the iron stone at\nits low temperature.\n\nIn a few hours he had a complete laboratory set up around the\nmeteorite. He worked feverishly in the hot sunshine, reading the\nvarious instruments he had set up, and arranging more. He contrived to\nkeep the stone cold by packing it in a box of dry ice.\n\nThe mechanics stopped for dinner, and I tried to get him to take time\nto eat.\n\n\"No, Hammond,\" he said. \"This is something big! We were talking about\nEinstein. This rock seems energized with a new kind of force: all\nmeteors are probably the same way, when they first plunge out of\nspace. I think this will be to relativity what the falling apple is to\ngravity. This is a big thing.\"\n\nHe looked up at me, brown eyes flashing.\n\n\"This is my chance to make a name, Hammond. If I do something big\nenough--Virginia might reconsider her opinion.\"\n\nCharlie worked steadily through the long hot afternoon. I spent most\nof the time helping him, or gazing in fascination at the curious haze\nof luminous blue mist that clung like a sphere of azure fog about the\nmeteoric stone. I did not completely understand what he did; the\nreader who wants the details may consult the monograph he is preparing\nfor the scientific press.\n\nHe had the men string up a line from our direct current generator in\nthe shops, to supply power for his electrical instruments. He mounted\na powerful electromagnet just below the meteorite, and set up an X-ray\ntube to bombard it with rays.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNight came, and the fire of the white sun faded from the sky. In the\ndarkness, the curious haze about the stone became luminescent,\ndistinct, a dim, motionless sphere of blue light. I fancied that I saw\ngrotesque shapes flashing through it. A ball of blue fire, shimmering\nand ghost-like, shrouded the instruments.\n\nCharlie's induction coil buzzed wickedly, with purple fire playing\nabout the terminals. The X-ray tube flickered with a greenish glow. He\nmanipulated the rheostat that controlled the current through the\nelectromagnet, and continued to read his instruments.\n\n\"Look at that!\" he cried.\n\nThe bluish haze about the stone grew brighter; it became a ball of\nsapphire flame, five feet thick, bright and motionless. A great sphere\nof shimmering azure fire! Wisps of pale, sparkling bluish mist ringed\nit. The stone in its box, the X-ray bulb and other apparatus were\nhidden. The end of the table stuck oddly from the ball of light.\n\nI heard Charlie move a switch. The hum of the coils changed a note.\n\nThe ball of blue fire vanished abruptly. It became a hole, a window in\nspace!\n\nThrough it, we saw another world!\n\nThe darkness of the night hung about us. Where the ball had been was a\ncircle of misty blue flame, five feet across. Through that circle I\ncould see a vast expanse of blue ocean, running in high, white-capped\nrollers, beneath a sky overcast with low gray clouds.\n\nIt was no flat picture like a movie screen. The scene had vast depth;\nI knew that we were really looking over an infinite expanse of stormy\nocean. It was all perfectly clear, distinct, real!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAstounded, I turned to find Charlie standing back and looking into the\nring of blue fire, with a curious mixture of surprise and delighted\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"What--what--\" I gasped.\n\n\"It's amazing! Wonderful! More than I had dared hope for! The\ncomplete vindication of my theory! If Virginia cares for scientific\nreputation--\"\n\n\"But what is it?\"\n\n\"It's hard to explain without mathematical language. You might say\nthat we are looking through a hole in space. The new force in the\nmeteorite, amplified by the X-rays and the magnetic field, is causing\na distortion of space-time coordinates. You know that a gravitational\nfield bends light; the light of a star is deflected in passing the\nsun. The field of this meteorite bends light through space-time,\nthrough the four-dimensional continuum. That scrap of ocean we can see\nmay be on the other side of the earth.\"\n\nI walked around the circle of luminous smoke with the marvelous\npicture in the center. It seemed that the window swung with me. I\nsurveyed the whole angry surface of that slate-gray, storm-beaten sea,\nto the misty horizon. Nowhere was it broken by land or ship.\n\nCharlie fell to adjusting his rheostat and switches.\n\nIt seemed that the gray ocean moved swiftly beyond the window. Vast\nstretches of it raced below our eyes. Faint black stains of steamer\nsmoke appeared against the blue-gray horizon and swept past. Then land\nappeared--a long, green-gray line. We had a flash of a long coast that\nunreeled in endless panorama before us. It was such a view as one\nmight get from a swift airplane--a plane flying thousands of miles per\nhour.\n\nThe Golden Gate flashed before us, with the familiar skyline of San\nFrancisco rising on the hills behind it.\n\n\"San Francisco!\" Charlie cried. \"This is the Pacific we've been\nseeing. Let's find the _Valhalla_. We might be able to see Virginia!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe coast-line vanished as he manipulated his instruments. Staring\ninto the circle of shining blue mist, I saw the endless ocean racing\nbelow us again. We picked up a pleasure yacht, running under bare\npoles.\n\n\"I didn't know there was such a storm on,\" Charlie murmured.\n\nOther vessels swam past below us, laboring against heavy seas.\n\nThen we looked upon an ocean whipped into mighty white-crowned waves.\nRain beat down in sheets from low dense clouds; vivid violet\nlightnings flashed before us. It seemed very strange to see such\nlightning and hear not the faintest whisper of thunder--but no sound\ncame from anything we saw through the blue-rimmed window in space.\n\n\"I hope the _Valhalla_ isn't in weather like this!\" cried Charlie.\n\nIn a few minutes a dark form loomed through the wind-riven mist.\nSwiftly it swam nearer; became a black ship.\n\n\"Only a tramp,\" Charlie said, breathing a sigh of relief.\n\nIt was a dingy tramp steamer, her superstructure wrecked. Her fires\nseemed dead. She lay across the wind, rolling sluggishly, threatening\nto sink with every monstrous wave. We saw no living person aboard her;\nshe seemed a sinking derelict. We made out the name _Roma_ on her\nside.\n\nCharlie moved his dials again.\n\nIn a few minutes the slender prow of another great steamer came\nthrough the sheets of rain. It was evidently a passenger vessel. She\nseemed limping along, half wrecked, with mighty waves breaking over\nher rail.\n\nCharlie grew white with alarm. \"The _Valhalla_!\" he gasped. \"And she's\nheaded straight for that wreck!\"\n\nIn a moment, as he brought the liner closer below our blue-rimmed\nwindow, I, too, made out the name. The wet, glistening decks were\nalmost deserted. Here and there a man struggled futilely against the\nforce of the storm.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a few minutes the drifting wreck of the _Roma_ came into our view,\ndead ahead of the limping liner. Through the mist and falling rain,\nthe derelict could not have been in sight of the lookout of the\npassenger vessel until she was almost upon it.\n\nWe saw the white burst of steam as the siren was blown. We watched the\ndesperate effort of the liner to check her way, to come about. But it\nwas too much for the already crippled ship. Charlie cried out as a\nmighty wave drove the _Valhalla_ down upon the sluggishly drifting\nwreck.\n\nAll the mad scene that ensued was strangely silent. We heard no crash\nwhen the collision occurred; heard no screams or shouts while the mob\nof desperate, white-faced passengers were fighting their way to the\ndeck. The vain struggle to launch the boats was like a silent movie.\n\nOne boat was splintered while being lowered. Another, already filled\nwith passengers, was lifted by a great ware and crushed against the\nside of the ship. Only shivered wood and red foam were left. The ship\nlisted so rapidly that the boats on the lee side were useless. It was\nimpossible to launch the others in that terrible, lashing sea.\n\n\"Virginia can swim.\" Charlie said hopefully. \"You know she tried the\nChannel last year, and nearly made it, too.\"\n\nHe stopped to watch that terrible scene in white-faced, anxious\nsilence.\n\nThe tramp went down before the steamer, drawing fragments of wrecked\nboats after it. The liner was evidently sinking rapidly. We saw dozens\nof hopeless, panic-stricken passengers diving off the lee side, trying\nto swim off far enough to avoid the tremendous suction.\n\nThen, with a curious deliberation, the bow of the _Valhalla_ dipped\nunder green water; her stern rose in the air until the ship stood\nalmost perpendicular. She slipped quickly down, out of sight.\n\nOnly a few swimming humans, and the wrecks of a few boats, were left\non the rough gray sea. Charlie fumbled nervously with his dials,\ntrying to get the scene near enough so that we could see the identity\nof the struggling swimmers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA long boat, which must have been swept below by the suction of the\nship, came plunging above the surface, upside down. It drifted swiftly\namong the swimmers, who struggled to reach it. I saw one person,\nevidently a girl, grasp it and drag herself upon it. It swept on past\nthe few others still struggling.\n\nThe wrecked boat with the girl upon it seemed coming swiftly toward\nour blue-rimmed window. In a few minutes I saw something familiar\nabout her.\n\n\"It's Virginia!\" Charlie cried. \"God! We've got to save her, somehow!\"\n\nThe long rollers drove the over-turned boat swiftly along. Virginia\nRandall clung desperately to it, deluged in foam, whipped with flying\nspray, the wild wind tearing at her.\n\nAbout us, the clear still night was deepening. The air was warm and\nstill; the hot stars shone steadily. Quiet lighted houses were in\nsight above the beach. It was very strange to look through the\nfire-rimmed circle, to see a girl struggling for life, clinging to a\nwrecked boat in a stormy sea.\n\nCharlie watched in an apathy of grief and horror, trembling and\nspeechless doing nothing except move the controls to keep the floating\ngirl in our sight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHours went by as we watched. Then Charlie cried out in sudden hope.\n\"There's a chance! I might do it! I might be able to save her!\"\n\n\"Might do what?\"\n\n\"We are able to see what we do because the field of the meteor bends\nlight through the four-dimensional continuum. The world line of a ray\nof light is a geodesic in the continuum. The field I have built\ndistorts the continuum, so we see rays that originated at a distant\npoint. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Clear as mud!\"\n\n\"Well, anyhow, if the field were strong enough, we could bring\nphysical objects through space-time, instead of mere visual images. We\ncould pick Virginia up and bring her right here to the crater! I'm\nsure of it!\"\n\n\"You mean you could move a girl through some four or five thousand\nmiles of space!\"\n\n\"You don't understand. She wouldn't come through space at all, but\nthrough space-time, through the continuum, which is a very different\nthing. She is four thousand miles away in our three-dimensional space,\nbut in space-time, as you see, she is only a few yards away. She is\nonly a few yards from us in the fourth dimension. If I can increase\nthe field a little, she will be drawn right through!\"\n\n\"You're a wizard if you can do it!\"\n\n\"I've got to do it! She's a fine swimmer--that's the only reason she's\nstill alive--but she'll never live to reach the shore. Not in a sea\nlike that!\"\n\nCharlie fell to work at once, mounting another electromagnet beside\nthe one he had set up, and rigging up two more X-ray bulbs beside the\npacking box which held the meteor. The motion of the boat in the\nfire-rimmed window kept drawing it swiftly away from us, and Charlie\nshowed me how to move the dial of his rheostat to keep the girl in\nview.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore he had completed his arrangements, a patch of white foam came\ninto view just ahead of the drifting boat. In a moment I made out a\ncruel black rock, with the angry sea breaking into fleecy spray upon\nit. The boat was almost upon it, driving straight for it. Charlie saw\nit, and cried out in horror.\n\nThe long black hull of the splintered boat, floating keel upward, was\nonly a few yards away. A great white-capped breaker lifted it and\nhurled it forward, with the girl clinging to it. She drew herself up\nand stared in terror at the black rock, while another long surging\nroller picked up the boat and swept it forward again.\n\nI stood, paralyzed in horror, while the shattered boat was driven full\nupon the great rock. I could imagine the crash of it, but it was all\nas still as a silent picture. The boat, riding high on a crest of\nwhite foam, smashed against the rock and was shivered to splinters.\nVirginia was hurled forward against the slick wet stone. Desperately\nshe scrambled to reach the top of the boulder. Her hands slipped on\nthe polished rock; the wild sea dragged at her. At last she got out of\nreach of the angry gray water, though spume still deluged her.\n\nI breathed a sigh of relief, though her position was still far from\nenviable.\n\n\"Virginia! Virginia! Why did I let you go?\" Charlie cried.\n\nDesperately he fell to work again, mounting the magnet and tubes.\nAnother hour went by, while I watched the shivering girl on the rock.\nBobbed hair, wet and glistening, was plastered close against her head,\nand her clothing was torn half off. She looked utterly exhausted; it\nseemed to take all her ebbing energy to cling to the rock against the\nforce of the wind and the waves that dashed against her. She looked\ncold, blue and trembling.\n\nThe water stood higher.\n\n\"The tide is rising!\" Charlie exclaimed. \"It will cover the rock\npretty soon. If I don't get her off in time--she's lost!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe finished twisting his wires together.\n\n\"I've got it all ready,\" he said. \"Now, I've got to find out exactly\nwhere she is, to know how to set it. Even then it's fearfully\nuncertain. I hate to try it, but it's the only chance.\n\n\"You can find out?\"\n\n\"Yes. From the spectral shift and other factors. I'll have to get some\nother apparatus.\" He ran up to the laboratory, across the level field\nthat lay black beneath the stars. He came back, panting, with\nspectrometer, terrestrial globe, and other articles.\n\n\"The tide is higher!\" he cried as he looked through the blue-rimmed\ncircle at the girl on the rock. \"She'll be swept off before long!\"\n\nHe mounted the spectrometer and fell to work with a will, taking\nobservations through the telescope, adjusting prisms and diffraction\ngratings, reading electrometers and other apparatus, and stopping to\nmake intricate calculations.\n\nI helped him when I could, or stared through the ring of shining blue\nmist, where I could see the waves breaking higher about the exhausted\ngirl who clung to the rock. Clouds of wind-whipped spray often hid her\nfrom sight. I knew that she would not have the strength to hold on\nmuch longer against the force of the rising sea.\n\nAlthough driven almost to distraction by the horror of her\npredicament, he worked with a cool, swift efficiency. Only the pale,\nanxiety-drawn expression on his face showed how great was the strain.\nHe finished the last spectrometer observation, snatched out a pad and\nfell to figuring furiously.\n\n\"Something queer here,\" he said presently, frowning. \"A shift of the\nspectrum that I can't explain by distortion through three-dimensional\nspace alone. I don't understand it.\"\n\nWe stared at the chilled and trembling girl on the rock.\n\n\"I'm almost afraid to try it. What if something went wrong?\"\n\nHe turned to the terrestrial globe he had brought down and traced a\nline over it. He made a quick calculation on his pad, then made a fine\ndot on the globe with the pencil point.\n\n\"Here she is. On a rock some miles off Point Eugenia, on the coast of\nthe Mexican State of Lower California. Most lonely spot in the world.\nNo chance for a rescue. We must--\n\n\"My god!\" he screamed in sudden horror. \"Look!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI looked through the blue-ringed window and saw the girl. Green water\nwas surging about her waist. It seemed that each wave almost tore her\noff. Then I saw that she was struggling with something. A great\ncoiling tentacle, black and leathery and glistening, was thrust up\nout of the green water. It wavered deliberately through the air and\ngrasped at the girl. She seemed to scream, though we could hear\nnothing. She beat at the monster, weakly, vainly.\n\n\"She's gone!\" cried Charlie.\n\n\"An octopus!\" I said. \"A giant cuttlefish!\"\n\nVirginia made a sudden fierce effort. With a strength that I had not\nthought her chilled limbs possessed, she tore away from the dreadful\ncreature and clambered higher on the rock. But still a hideous black\ntentacle clung about her ankle, tugging at her, drawing her back\ndespite her desperate struggle to break free.\n\n\"I've got to try it!\" Charlie said, determination flashing in his\neyes. \"It's a chance!\"\n\nHe closed a switch. His new coils sung out above the old one. X-ray\ntubes flickered beside the blue fire that ringed the window. He\nadjusted his rheostats and closed the circuit through the new magnet.\n\nA curtain of blue flame was drawn quickly between us and the round,\nfire-rimmed window. A huge ball of blue fire hung, about the meteorite\nand the instruments. For minutes it hung there, while Charlie,\nperspiring, worked desperately with the apparatus. Then it expanded;\nbecame huge. It exploded noiselessly, in a great flash of sapphire\nflame, then vanished completely.\n\nMeteor, bench, and apparatus were gone!\n\nIn the light of the stars we could make out the huge crater the\nmeteorite had torn, with a few odds and ends of equipment scattered\nabout it. But all the apparatus Charlie had set up, connected with the\nmeteoric stone, had disappeared.\n\nHe was dumbfounded, staggered with disappointment.\n\n\"Virginia! Virginia!\" he called out, in a hopeless tone. \"No, she\nisn't here. It didn't draw her through. I've failed. And we can't even\nsee her any more!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDesperately I searched for consolation for him.\n\n\"Maybe the octopus won't hurt her,\" I offered. \"They say that most of\nthe stories of their ferocity are somewhat exaggerated.\"\n\n\"If the monster doesn't get her, the tide will!\" he said bitterly. \"I\nmade a miserable failure of it! And I don't know why! I can't\nunderstand it!\"\n\nApathetically, he picked up his pad and held it in the light of his\nelectric lantern.\n\n\"Something funny about this equation. The shift of the spectrum lines\ncan't be accounted for by distortion through space alone.\"\n\nWith wrinkled brow, he stared for many minutes at the bit of paper he\nheld in the white circle of light. Suddenly he seized a pencil and\nfigured rapidly.\n\n\"I have it! The light was bent through time! I should have recognized\nthese space-time coordinates.\"\n\nHe calculated again.\n\n\"Yes. The scene we saw in that circle of light was distant from us not\nonly in space but in time. The _Valhalla_ probably hasn't sunk yet at\nall. We were looking into the future!\"\n\n\"But how can that be? Seeing things before they happen!\"\n\nI have the profoundest respect for Charlie King's mathematical genius.\nBut when he said that I was frankly incredulous.\n\n\"Space and time are only relative terms. Our material universe is\nmerely the intersection of tangled world lines of geodesics in a\nfour-dimensional continuum. Space and time have no meaning\nindependently of each other. Jeans says. 'A terrestrial astronomer may\nreckon that the outburst on Nova Persei occurred a century before the\ngreat fire of London, but an astronomer on the Nova may reckon with\nequal accuracy that the great fire occurred a century before the\noutburst on the Nova.' The field of this meteorite deflected light\nwaves so that we saw them earlier, according to our conventional\nideas of time, than they originated. We saw several hours into the\nfuture.\n\n\"And the amplified field of the magnet, though strong enough to move\nVirginia through space, was not sufficiently powerful to draw her back\nto us across time. Yet she must have felt the pull. Some dreadful\nthing may have happened. The problem is rather complicated.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe lifted his pencil again. In the glow of the little electric lantern\nI saw his lean young face tense with the fierce effort of his thought.\nHis pencil raced across the little pad, setting down symbols that I\ncould make nothing of.\n\nMy own thoughts were racing. Seeing into the future was a rather\nrevolutionary idea to me. My mind is conservative; I have always been\nsceptical of the more fantastic ideas suggested by science. But\nCharlie seemed to know what he was talking about. In view of the\nmarvelous things he had done that night, it seemed hardly fair to\ndoubt him now. I decided to accept his astounding statement at face\nvalue and to follow the adventure through.\n\nHe lifted his pencil and consulted the luminous dial of his wrist\nwatch.\n\n\"We saw that last scene some twelve hours and forty minutes before it\nhappened--to put it in conventional language. The distortion of the\ntime coordinates amounted to that.\"\n\nIn the light of dawn--for we had been all night at the meteor pit, and\nsilver was coming in the east--he looked at me with fierce resolve in\nhis eyes.\n\n\"Hammond, that gives us over twelve hours to get to Virginia!\"\n\n\"You mean to go? But just twelve hours! That's better than the\ntranscontinental record--to say nothing of the time it would take to\nfind a little rock in the Pacific!\"\n\n\"We have the _Golden Gull_! She's as fast as any ship we've ever\nflown.\"\n\n\"But we can't take the _Gull_! Those alterations haven't been made.\nAnd that new engine! A bear-cat for power, but it may go dead any\nsecond. The _Gull_ can fly, but she isn't safe!\"\n\n\"Safety be damned! I've got to get to Virginia, and get there in the\nnext twelve hours!\"\n\n\"The _Gull_ will fly, but--\"\n\n\"All right. Please help me get off!\"\n\n\"Help you off? It's a fool thing to do! But if you go, I do!\"\n\n\"Thanks, Hammond. Awfully!\" He gripped my hand. \"We've got to make\nit!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith a last glance into the gaping pit from which we had dug the\nmarvelous stone, we turned and ran across to the hangars. As we ran\nthe sun came above the sea in the east: its first rays struck us like\na fiery lance. The mechanics had not yet appeared. Charlie pushed the\ndoors back, and we ran out the trim little _Golden Gull_, beautiful\nwith her slender wing and her graceful, tapering lines.\n\nI seized the starting crank and Charlie sprang into the cockpit. I\ncranked until the mechanism was droning dismally, and pulled the lever\nthat engaged it with the engine. I had been in too much haste to get\nup the proper speed, and the powerful new engine failed to fire.\nCharlie almost cried with vexation while I was cranking again.\n\nThis time the motor coughed and fell into a steady, vibrant roar. With\nthe wind from the propeller screaming about me, I disengaged the crank\nand stood waiting while the motor warmed. Charlie gave it scant time\nto do so before he motioned me to kick out the blocks. I tumbled into\nthe enclosed cockpit beside him, he gave the ship the gun, and we\nroared across the field.\n\nIn five minutes we were flying west, at a speed just under three\nhundred miles per hour. Charlie was crouched over the stick, scanning\nthe instrument board, and flying the _Gull_ almost at her top speed.\nAgain and again his eyes went to the little clock on the panel.\n\n\"Twelve hours and forty minutes,\" he said. \"And an hour gone already!\nWe're got to be there by five minutes after six.\"\n\nWe were flying over Louisiana when the oil line clogged. The engine\nheated dangerously. Reluctantly, Charlie cut off the ignition, and\nfell in a swift spiral to an open field.\n\n\"We're got to fix it!\" he said. \"Another hour gone! And we needed\nevery minute!\"\n\n\"This new engine! It's powerful enough, but we should have had time to\noverhaul it, and make those changes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCharlie landed with his usual skill, and we fell to work in desperate\nhaste. A grizzled farmer, a wad of tobacco in his cheek and three\nragged urchins at his heels, stopped to watch us. He had just been to\nhis mailbox, and had a morning paper in his hand. Charlie questioned\nhim about the storm.\n\n\"Storm-center nears the American coast,\" he read in a nasal drawl.\n\"Greatest storm of year drives shipping upon west coast. Six vessels\nreported lost. _S. S. Valhalla_, disabled, sends S. O. S.\n\n\"A thousand lives are the estimated toll to-night of the most terrific\nstorm of the year, which is sweeping toward the Pacific coast, driving\nall shipping before it. Radiograms from the _Valhalla_ at 5 P. M.\nreport that she is disabled and in danger. It is doubtful that rescue\nvessels can reach her through the storm.\"\n\nWe got the engine repaired, took off again. Charlie looked at the\nlittle clock.\n\n\"Five minutes to ten. Eight hours and ten minutes left, and we've got\na darn long ways to go.\"\n\nWe had to stop at San Antonio, Texas, to replenish gasoline and oil.\n\n\"Ten minutes lost!\" Charlie complained as we took off. \"And that\nmonster--waiting in the future to drag Virginia to a hideous death!\"\n\nTwo hours later the plane developed trouble in the ignition system.\nThe motor was new, with several radical changes that we had introduced\nto increase power and lessen weight. As I had objected to Charlie, we\nhad not done enough experimental work on it to perfect it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe limped into the field at El Paso and spent another priceless\nhalf-hour at work. I got some sandwiches at a luncheon counter beside\nthe field, and listened a moment to a radio loudspeaker there.\n\n\"Many thousands are dead,\" came the crisp, metallic voice of the\nannouncer, \"as a result of the storm now raging on the Pacific coast,\nthe worst in several years. The storm-center is spending its force on\nthe coastal regions to-day. Millions of dollars in damage are reported\nin cities from San Francisco to Manzanillo, Mexico.\n\n\"The greatest disaster of the storm is the loss of the passenger liner\n_Valhalla_, of the Red Star Line. It is believed to have collided with\nthe abandoned hulk of an Italian-owned tramp freighter, the _Roma_,\nwhich was left by its crew yesterday in a sinking condition.\nRadiograms from the liner ceased three hours ago, when she was said to\nbe sinking. The officers doubted that her boats could be launched in\nsuch a sea--\"\n\nI waited to hear no more. Charlie checked our route while we were\nstopped. And we took off; we crossed the Rio Grande and flew across\nthe rocky, brush-scattered hills of Mexico, in a direct line for the\nrock in the sea.\n\n\"If anything happens so we have to land again--well, it's just too\nbad,\" Charlie said grimly. \"But we've got to go this way. It's\nsomething over six hundred miles in a straight line. Fifteen minutes\nto four, now. We have to average nearly three hundred miles an hour to\nget there.\"\n\nHe was silent and intent over his maps and instruments as we flew on\nover the lofty Sierra Madre Range, and over a long slope down to the\nGulf of California. Head-winds beset us as we were over the stretch\nof blue water, and we flew on into a storm.\n\n\"We had hardly time to make it, without the wind against us,\" Charlie\nsaid. \"If it holds us back many miles--well, it just mustn't!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPurple lightning flickered ominously in the mass of blue storm-clouds\nthat hung above the mountainous peninsula of Lower California. I had a\nqualm about flying into it in our untested machine. But Charlie leaned\ntensely forward and sent the _Golden Gull_ on at the limit of her\nspeed. Gray vapor swirled about us, rent with livid streaks of\nlightning. Thunder crashed and rumbled above the roar of our racing\nengine. Wild winds screeched in the struts; rain and hail beat against\nus. The plane rose and fell; she was swirled about like a falling\nleaf. The stick struggled in Charlie's hands like a living thing. With\nlips tightened to a thin line, he fought silently, fiercely,\ndesperately.\n\nSuddenly we were sucked down until I had an uneasy feeling at the pit\nof my stomach. I saw the grim outline of a bare mountain peak\ndangerously close below us, shrouded in wind-whipped mist.\n\nIn sudden alarm I shouted, \"We'd better get out of this, Charlie! We\ncan't live in it long!\"\n\nIn the roar of the storm he did not hear me, and I shouted again.\n\nHe turned to face me, after a glance at the clock. \"We've less than an\nhour, Hammond. We've got to go on!\"\n\nI sank back in my seat. The plane rolled and tossed until I thanked my\nlucky stars for the safety strap. In nervous anxiety I watched Charlie\nbring the ship up again, and fight his way on through the storm. For\nan eternity, it seemed, we battled through a chaos of wind-driven\nmist, bright with purple lightning and shaken with crashing thunder.\n\nCharlie struggled with the controls until he was dripping with\nperspiration. He must have been utterly worn out, after thirty-six\nhours of exhausting effort. A dozen times I despaired of life. The\ncompass had gone to spinning crazily; we dived through the rain until\nwe could pick up landmarks below. Three times a great bare peak loomed\nsuddenly up ahead of us, and Charlie averted collision only by zooming\nsuddenly upward.\n\nThen slate-gray water was beneath us, running in white-crested\nmountains. I knew that we were at last out over the Pacific.\n\n\"We've passed Point Eugenia,\" Charlie said. \"It can't be far, now. But\nwe have only fifteen minutes left. Fifteen minutes to get to\nher--before the attraction of the meteor jerks her away, perhaps to a\nhorrible fate.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe flew low and fast over the racing waves. Charlie looked over his\ncharts and made a swift calculation. He changed our course a bit and\nwe flew on at top speed. We scanned the vast, mad expanse of sea below\nthe blue-gray clouds. Here and there were lines of white breakers, but\nnowhere did we see a rock with a girl upon it. Presently the green\noutline of an island appeared out of the wild water on our right.\n\n\"That's Del Tiburon,\" Charlie said. \"We missed the rock.\"\n\nHe swung the plane about and we flew south over the hastening waves. I\nlooked at the little clock. It showed two minutes to six. I turned to\nCharlie.\n\n\"Seven minutes!\" he whispered grimly.\n\nOn and on we flew, in a wide circle. The motor roared loud. An endless\nexpanse of racing waves unreeled below us. The little hand crawled\naround the dial. One minute past six. Only four minutes to go.\n\nWe saw a speck of white foam on the mad gray water. It was miles away,\nalmost on the horizon. We plunged toward it, motor bellowing loud.\nFive miles a minute we flew. The white fleck became a black rock\nsmothered in snowy foam. On we swept, and over the rock, with\nbullet-like speed.\n\nAs we plunged by, I saw Virginia's slender form, tattered,\nbrine-soaked, straggling in the hideous tentacles of the monster\noctopus. It was the same terrible scene that we had viewed, through\nthe amazing phenomenon of distortion of light through space-time, four\nthousand miles away and twelve hours before.\n\nIn a few minutes the time would come when Charlie had ended our view\nof the scene by his attempt to draw the girl through the fourth\ndimension to our apparatus in Florida. What terrible thing might\nhappen then?\n\nCharlie brought the ship about so quickly that we were flung against\nthe sides. Down we came toward the mad waves in a swift glide. In\nsudden apprehension, I dropped my hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Man, you can't land in a sea like that! It's suicide!\"\n\nWithout a word, he shook off my hand and continued our steep glide\ntoward the rock. I drew my breath in apprehension of a crash.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI do not blame Charlie for what happened. He is as skilful a pilot as\nI know. It was a mad freak of the sea that did the thing.\n\nThe gray waste of mountainous, white-crested waves rose swiftly up to\nmeet us, with the rock with the girl clinging to it just to our right.\nThe _Golden Gull_ struck the crest of a wave, buried herself in the\nfoam, and plunged down the long slope to the trough. We rose safely to\nthe crest of the oncoming roller, and I saw the black outline of the\nrock not a dozen yards away.\n\nCharlie had landed with all his skill. It was not his fault that the\nblustering wind caught the ship as she reached the crest of the wave\nand flung her sidewise toward the rock. It is no fault of his that the\nwhite-capped mountain of racing green water completed what the wind\nhad begun and hurled the frail plane crashing on the rock.\n\nI have a confused memory of the wild plunge at the mercy of the wave,\nof my despair as I realized that we were being wrecked. I must have\nbeen knocked unconscious when we struck. The next I remember I was\nopening my eyes to find myself on the rock, Charlie's strong arm on my\nshoulder. I was soaked with icy brine and my head was aching from a\nheavy blow.\n\nVirginia, shivering and blue, was perched beside us. I could see no\nsign of the plane: the mighty sea had swept away what was left of it.\nClinging to the lee side of the rock I saw the black tentacles of the\ngiant octopus--waiting for a wave to dash us to its mercy.\n\n\"All right, Hammond?\" Charlie inquired anxiously. \"I'm afraid you got\na pretty nasty bump on the head. About all I could do to fish you out\nbefore the _Gull_ was swept away.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe helped me to a better position to withstand the force of the great\nroller that came plunging down upon us like a moving mountain.\nVirginia was in his arms, too exhausted to do more than cling to him.\n\n\"What can we do?\" I sputtered, shaking water from my head.\n\n\"Not a thing! We're in a pretty bad fix, I imagine. In a few seconds\nwe will feel the attraction of the meteor's field--the force with\nwhich I tried to draw Virginia to the crater through the fourth\ndimension. I don't know what will happen; we may be jerked out of\nspace altogether. And if that doesn't get us, the tide and the octopus\nwill!\"\n\nHis voice was drowned in the roar of the coming wave. A mountain of\nwater deluged us. Half drowned, I clung to the rock against the mad\nwater.\n\nThen blinding blue light flashed about me. A sharp crash rang in my\nears, like splintering glass. I reeled, and felt myself falling\nheadlong.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI brought up on soft sand.\n\nI sat up, dumbfounded, and opened my eyes. I was sitting on the steep\nsandy side of a conical pit. Charlie and Virginia were sprawled beside\nme, looking as astonished as I felt. Charlie got to his knees and\nlifted the limp form of the girl in his arms.\n\nSomething snapped in my brain. The sand-walled pit was suddenly\nfamiliar. I got to my feet and clambered out of it. I saw that we were\non our own landing field.\n\nAstonishingly, we were back in the meteor crater. Charlie's vanished\napparatus was scattered about us. I saw the gray side of the rough\niron meteorite itself, half-buried in the sand at the bottom of the\npit.\n\n\"What--what happened?\" I demanded of Charlie.\n\n\"Don't you see? Simple enough. I should have thought of it before. The\nfield of the meteorite brought Virginia--and us--through to this point\nin space. But it could not bring us back through time; instead, the\napparatus itself was jerked forward through time. That is why it\nvanished. We got here just twelve hours and forty minutes after I\nclosed the switch, since we had been looking that far into the future.\nThe mathematical explanation--\"\n\n\"That's enough for me!\" I said hastily. \"We better see about a warm,\ndry bed for Virginia, and some hot soup or something.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow the rough gray meteorite, in a neat glass case, rests above the\nmantel in the library of a beautiful home where I am a frequent guest.\nI was there one evening, a few days ago, when Charlie King fell silent\nin one of his fits of mathematical speculation.\n\n\"Einstein again?\" I chaffingly inquired.\n\nHe raised his brown eyes and looked at me. \"Hammond, since relativity\nenabled us to find the Meteor Girl, you ought to be convinced!\"\n\nVirginia--whom her husband calls the Meteor Girl--came laughingly to\nthe rescue.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Hammond, what do you think of Einstein now?\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Reader's Corner\n\n[Illustration: The Reader's Corner]\n\n\n_Now--Internationale Scientific Society_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     The genial editor of this \"Astounding\" publication has\n     granted me a few words directed to all readers who may be\n     interested.\n\n     The Science Correspondence Club, with the inception of the\n     new year, will operate under an entirely new policy, most\n     important of which is the change of name to Internationale\n     Scientific Society. The archaic and tedious correspondence\n     will be a minor consideration in the new policy. Our\n     publications and form letter methods of communication keep\n     all members fully informed as to up-to-date news of the\n     Society. Affiliation with the \"Verein f\u00fcr Raumschiffarht\" in\n     Berlin has been accomplished also. This makes available to\n     all \"Internationale Scientific\" members the latest news from\n     the forefront of science in Germany, with especial reference\n     to latest rocket interplanetary developments. Constant\n     improvements on our monthly journal are always sought for.\n     Contributors of well-known reputation are: Willy Ley, Earl\n     D. Streeter, R. P. Starzl, Robt. A. Wait, Dr. Wm.

Is it absolutely\n     without a doubt the best magazine on the market, and that\n     means something. I have only been acquainted with Astounding\n     Stories since May--since then I have had greater pleasure in\n     reading them than anything else. To my sad disappointment I\n     missed the first four issues, but I've read every story\n     since.\n\n     The first story I read was \"The Atom Smasher,\" and I\n     considered this very good. The majority of your stories are\n     very good. Occasionally a poor one will mix in, but I know\n     we all regard this as only a slight error.\n\n     I suggest that it would be to your advantage to advertise\n     Astounding Stories more than you do because it was by mere\n     accident that I came in contact with it, and it has happened\n     to others the same way. You would see the increased number\n     of copies sold if you make special advertising a part of\n     your business. The reason I suggest this is because I know\n     what your future readers are missing if they don't read\n     Astounding Stories.\n\n     Here's wishing you success in continuing to publish the best\n     stories.--Walter Oathout, 91 College Ave., Troy, New York.\n\n\n\"_Cut That Romantic Stuff_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I am accepting your offer to come over to \"The Readers'\n     Corner,\" and am coming over in two ways, as you will see by\n     my address.\n\n     First of all, I must say that I raise my hat to you and your\n     coworkers for having brought out another Science Fiction\n     magazine--a real benefaction to readers like myself who\n     thrive, as it were, on such stories. I can tell you my eyes\n     grew big with delight when I saw the first number--to me--of\n     Astounding Stories. Mille mercis. Why don't you try\n     publishing a thick Quarterly?\n\n     My favorite authors are A. Hyatt Verrill, J. W. Campbell,\n     Jr., Miles J. Breuer, M. D., Captain S. P. Meek, Ray\n     Cummings, Arthur J. Berks and Edmond Hamilton. If you get\n     stories by these for your magazine it will continue to\n     prosper, as they are excellent writers, and the first four\n     have fine science in their tales. I have had only three\n     copies of Astounding Stories, and the tales I like best are:\n     \"Vandals of the Stars,\" the serial \"Brigands of the Moon,\"\n     \"Monsters of Moyen\"--this was most interesting--\"The Ray of\n     Madness,\" \"The Soul Snatcher,\" and \"The Jovian Jest.\" This\n     last, though short, I thought to be very good, and it gave\n     one furiously to think, too. While I like all kinds of\n     Science Fiction, I have a special preference for\n     interplanetary and fourth dimension stories.\n\n     Now having handed out one or two bouquets, I am going to\n     sling some brickbats. Doggone it, but why don't you cut out\n     some of that romantic stuff in your stories? Goodness knows,\n     but one has enough of love and the ubiquitous heroine in\n     other tales without this sentimentality entering into\n     Science Fiction. Indeed, that is the biggest criticism I\n     have of Astounding Stories, and I do honestly wish that if\n     you have absolutely got to give the stuff you would confine\n     it to half the stories. Half and half--that's fair, isn't\n     it?\n\n     If you will publish this letter, which I should like you to\n     do, it would draw to the notice of the other readers that I\n     am always very pleased to correspond with any of them on\n     science and science stories.\n\n     Now I'll dry up, wishing you the very best of sincere wishes\n     for the continued success of your--or rather \"our\"--little\n     treasure, Astounding Stories.--Glyn Owens, 20, Rugby Rd.,\n     Newport, Man., Canada.\n\n\n_Nossir--No \"Half Pints\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have been reading Astounding Stories for some time,\n     although this is the first time I have written, and I want\n     to say it is one swell mag. I like all of its stories,\n     though I like the ones of adventure on other planets and in\n     strange lands best. But listen, I don't want any by a few\n     half pint authors I know of that write for a few other\n     quarter pint magazines. Let's have some more by such as\n     Victor Rousseau, Capt. S. P. Meek, Arthur J. Burks, Murry\n     Leinster and R. P. Starzl. Also Ray Cummings. Here's to them\n     and to the best mag on the market. Remember, no half\n     pints.--Boyd Goodman, 2801 Laclede St., Dallas, Texas.\n\n\n\"_Out of Curiosity_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Seeing your magazine on the newsstands the other day, I\n     purchased it out of curiosity to see whether it was just\n     another magazine or something out of the ordinary. Being a\n     reader of other Science Fiction magazines, I was surprised\n     to see how much better Astounding Stories turned out to be\n     than the rest. Ever since that first issue I have been a\n     steady reader of \"our\" magazine.\n\n     I think that one of the best improvements that could be made\n     is to cut all the pages even. Wesso sure is a dandy artist.\n     Try not to lose him. I, for one, am very much in favor of\n     reprints. I think they would very much increase our circle\n     of readers.\n\n     Some of your best authors are: S. P. Meek, V. Rousseau, Ray\n     Cummings and S. P. Wright. Let's have some more novels by\n     those authors, please.--E. F. Hittleman, 3400 Wayne Ave.,\n     Bronx, N. Y.\n\n\n\"_Or What Have You?_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I've just finished reading the October issue of Astounding\n     Stories and am convinced that the magazine is getting better\n     and better.\n\n     I'd like to take back what I said in my first letter about\n     interplanetary stories being ruled out, because I notice\n     they are improving. They seem more realistic and true.\n\n     I like \"Jetta of the Lowlands.\" Something different, don't\n     you think? Seems strange to imagine what the ocean bottoms\n     might be like.\n\n     And how can \"Stolen Brains\" help but be good when Captain\n     Meek brings his Philo Vance to the rescue--that intelligent\n     Dr. Bird. (This may sound like sarcasm, but it's meant to be\n     praise.) I always read Dr. Bird first of all.\n\n     \"Prisoners on the Electron\" is just what I like. Somewhere I\n     read a story similar to it--that of life on an electron. I\n     don't doubt one bit that there can be life on such minute\n     surfaces, which also gives me an idea that the earth may be\n     an electron to some gigantic planet which is so large that\n     we cannot comprehend its size. Couldn't that be possible?\n\n     I still find that among the contributors there is only one\n     girl besides myself. Letters sent to me from readers are all\n     from men or boys. Am I so different from other girls? Or\n     what have you?--Gertrude Hemken, 5730 So. Ashland Ave.,\n     Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n_Only Fiction_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I am writing a second letter criticizing some of the later\n     stories you published. I think Astounding Stories is\n     steadily improving. In the June issue, \"The Moon Master\"\n     takes first place. Other first place stories are: \"The\n     Forgotten Planet,\" (July); \"The Second Satellite,\" (August);\n     \"Marooned Under the Sea,\" (Sept); \"The Invisible Empire,\"\n     (Oct).\n\n     I agree with Mr. W. Gelman. You ought to have coupons to\n     fill out on reprints and see whether or not the majority\n     vote for reprints. I saw a mistake in \"Prisoners on the\n     Electron.\" The author states that four months of time passed\n     on the electron during fifteen seconds Earth time. That is\n     wrong, because electrons revolve several thousand times per\n     second around their nucleus or sun, so by the time Karl\n     Danzig fished out Aaron and Nanette they would be as old as\n     the hills. I would like to know if the story, \"Marooned\n     Under the Sea,\" was found near New Zealand or is it just\n     fiction? Another thing I want to say is that you have too\n     many serials.--Geo. Brandes, 141 South Church St.,\n     Schenectady, New York.\n\n\n_This Is Treason!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     This is the first time I have written to the \"Corner,\" but I\n     wished to call your attention to a story I have just\n     finished reading in another magazine--\"Skylark Three,\" by\n     Edward E. Smith. I think it is by far better than anything I\n     have read in your magazine. I thought you might be able to\n     get something on this line.\n\n     Of course, some of the theories are rather far fetched. I\n     think this is the best story I have read for years, and hope\n     that if Smith writes any more, I will be able to read\n     them.--D. R. Guthrie, P. O. Box 23, Copeland, Idaho.\n\n\n_Announcement_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Several months ago an announcement was made in this magazine\n     concerning The Scienceers, an organization of\n     scientifically-minded young men, with headquarters in New\n     York City.\n\n     We wish to thank you for publishing this notice, which\n     resulted in the acquisition of several new members. We are\n     all readers of Astounding Stories, and consider it the\n     premier magazine in the Science Fiction field.\n\n     The purpose of our organization, as taken from the\n     constitution, is as follows: To promote informal fellowship\n     among persons interested in science, and to foster\n     discussion and debate on modern discoveries, theories, and\n     projects in the realm of science.\n\n     The only requirements for membership in The Scienceers are\n     that applicants must be over sixteen years of age, and must\n     show a hearty willingness to cooperate with the other\n     members in discussing theories, etc., in science.\n\n     The member of the club has the companionship and friendship\n     of other persons interested in the same activities. He will\n     find a congenial atmosphere upon his arrival and will have a\n     wonderful time in helping the club to be bigger and better.\n     He will be as well informed on the latest events in science\n     as though he were taking a course in it, which in reality he\n     will be doing. He will have access to the club's library,\n     consisting of several hundred books and magazines on science\n     and Science Fiction. In our library are the latest Science\n     Fiction books published, such as \"Red Snow,\" by F. W.\n     Moxley, \"The Monster Men,\" by E. R. Burroughs and \"The World\n     Below,\" by S. Fowler Wright. In our collection we have\n     reprints that we feel sure many of our present Science\n     Fiction fans have not read. We have a great many scientific\n     books and magazines. The club buys regularly Popular\n     Science, Popular Mechanics, Science and Invention, and\n     others.\n\n     Those who would like to visit the clubroom will be gladly\n     received. The clubroom is at 266 E. Van Cortland Ave. Get\n     off at Mosholu Parkway station on the Jerome Avenue line.\n     Our secretary, Allen Glasser, of 1610 University Ave., New\n     York City, will receive all inquiries for information.\n\n     The Scienceers have a branch in Clearwater, Florida, and\n     another in Temple, Texas. The former may be reached by\n     writing to Mr. Guy Cole, Secretary, Clearwater, Florida, and\n     the latter by writing to Mr. Gabriel Kirschner, Box 301,\n     Temple, Texas.--Nathan Greenfeld, Librarian, The Scienceers,\n     873 Whitlock Ave, New York, N. Y.\n\n\n\"_Abominable,\" \"Rotten,\" etc._\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I aim for this letter to represent the hardest and reddest\n     brickbats imaginably possible, excepting perhaps the first\n     paragraph, not counting this prelude (warping).\n\n     I have classified the stories of all issues out so far, and\n     the results show that Victor Rousseau, Ray Cummings, Murray\n     Leinster, Capt. Meek, Charles W. Diffin, Arthur J. Burks,\n     Harl Vincent, S. P. Wright, R. P. Starzl, Edmond Hamilton,\n     Miles J. Breuer, M. D., James P. Olsen, Tom Curry, S. W.\n     Ellis and Jackson Gee are your most outstanding authors. The\n     first seven stand head and shoulders above the other\n     authors, though.\n\n     Now for the brickbats. No kiddin'--where is your Editor's\n     pride? We want a magazine to be proud of, don't we? Its\n     binding is abominable. The edges are terrible: it takes ten\n     minutes to find a certain page. The paper itself is\n     absolutely rotten. What about the poor readers who want to\n     have a Science Fiction library? He wants a magazine that can\n     be bound and will look half good. Please put better grade\n     paper in your magazine. And for goodness sake, answer in the\n     department all questions and inquiries from the readers. Why\n     not have a vote on this? I guarantee you that over 90% of\n     the votes will want your answers to their personal\n     questions. Please answer my request in \"The Readers'\n     Corner.\"--Ward Elmore, 3022 Avenue K, Fort Madison, Iowa.\n\n\n\"_Pictures of the Readers_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     The November Astounding Stories is up to the high standard\n     set by previous issues. For first place I nominate \"The\n     Pirate Planet,\" which promises to be as good as \"Earth, the\n     Marauder.\" The last part of \"Jetta of the Lowlands\" was a\n     fitting conclusion to a great story. \"Vagabonds of Space,\"\n     \"The Wall of Death,\" and \"The Gray Plague\" are all worthy of\n     being ranked with your best stories.\n\n     The cover illustration is one of Wesso's best, if not the\n     best. It is a marked improvement over the October one.\n     There's also a great improvement in the illustrations inside\n     the book, since all except one were drawn by Wesso.\n\n     I heartily approve of the suggestion of Jack Darrow, who\n     proposes that you devote a page to your authors. Your\n     writers are the outstanding Science Fiction authors of the\n     day, and we should like to know something about them. If you\n     happen to run out of new authors, you could run the Eves and\n     pictures of some of the readers (Mr. Darrow, Mr. Kirschner,\n     Mr. Wentzler, etc.), who contribute almost as much material\n     as some of your authors. To be serious, though, the above\n     make many valuable suggestions, especially Mr. Darrow, with\n     whom I agree on almost every point.\n\n     Those persons who said that the small size of Astounding\n     Stories was insult to Science Fiction can't complain now.\n     After October the majority of the monthly Science Fiction\n     magazines will have the small size.\n\n     The controversy over the reprint question seems to be\n     getting warm. There are a good many letters on the subject\n     in this issue both pro and con. In fact, there were more\n     \"con\" letters in this issue than all the previous issues\n     combined. However, the \"pros\" are more than holding their\n     own, and I believe that if a vote was held they would be in\n     the majority.--Michael Fogaris, 157 Fourth St., Passaic, N.\n     J.\n\n\n_Prefers More Science_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     The size of Astounding Stories now is O. K. Only it would be\n     better if it was thicker than it is, even if you have to\n     raise the price five cents. I like the Edgar Rice Burroughs\n     stories and wish you would have them in your magazine.\n\n     In the November issue, \"The Wall of Death\" wasn't any good;\n     \"The Pirate Planet\" was good: \"The Destroyer\" was fair; \"The\n     Gray Plague\" was very good; \"Vagabonds of Space\" was\n     excellent, but I didn't like the ending. \"Jetta of the\n     Lowlands\" was fair. I don't like the stories by Victor\n     Rousseau very much.\n\n     I don't want any reprints and I think you should cut the\n     pages even. I wish you would have some true Science Fiction\n     stories with more science in them.--Alvin Wasserman, 339 N.\n     6th St., Allentown, Pa.\n\n\n\"_Fits Book Case_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have read every issue of Astounding Stories yet produced.\n     Keep the magazine the same size, as it conveniently fits in\n     a book rack or book case. I like stories on chemistry and\n     physics, also stories narrating the exploits of Dr. Bird. I\n     think your November issue is the best one yet. My favorite\n     story so far is \"The Gray Plague.\" I did not like \"Beyond\n     the Heaviside Layer.\" The illustrations are fine. Well, I\n     guess it's about time for me to sign off.--Henry Seitz, 1732\n     Summerfield St., Brooklyn, N. Y.\n\n\n_Suggestions from Australia_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have accepted your invitation to join \"The Readers'\n     Corner\" and give criticism on your magazine. I will\n     criticize the recent stories first, and divide them into\n     three classes: good, medium and bad.\n\n     August: \"The Lord of Space,\" \"The Second Satellite,\" \"Silver\n     Dome,\" \"The Flying City,\" good. \"The Planet of Dread,\"\n     medium.\n\n     September: \"Marooned under the Sea,\" \"The Terrible Tentacles\n     of L-472,\" good. \"Problem in Communication,\" medium. \"Murder\n     Machine,\" bad.\n\n     Serials: \"Brigands of the Moon,\" good. \"Murder Madness,\"\n     good, but I don't consider it a suitable story for this type\n     of magazine. \"Earth, the Marauder,\" good, but the end was\n     too hurried. I wonder why the gnomes of Luar were brought\n     into the story; I don't see that they serve any useful\n     purpose there.\n\n     There seems to be a hand-rail around the submarines on the\n     cover of the April number. If this is so, it is out of\n     proportion. And don't you think that such monsters as those\n     in \"The Moon Master\" would need more to eat than just the\n     few herbivorous animals that could exist on the fungus\n     vegetation?\n\n     I think that your magazine would be much better if printed\n     on smoother paper and cut evenly. I am sure that no one\n     would mind the extra cost of the book. And why not call \"The\n     Readers' Corner\" something more appropriate, such as the\n     \"Observatory,\" or the \"Microscope,\" or something, anyway,\n     that deals with science?--P. Leadbeater, Drysdale, Victoria,\n     Australia.\n\n\n_Thanks Very Much_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I would like to shake hands with Mr. P. Schuyler Miller. He\n     has given us such conclusive and unopposable proof for\n     reprints in his letter printed in the November issue, that\n     there is hardly anything more to be said. All we ask (by\n     \"we,\" I mean those thousands of Readers who are eagerly\n     waiting for a story of which they have heard so much) is one\n     good reprint. That is, one a year. During the year 1930,\n     Astounding Stories has published five novels. Can you not\n     publish four new novels and one reprint in 1931? It amounts\n     to much the same thing.\n\n     Also, there are other magazines which publish Science\n     Fiction and these would see to it that the good authors did\n     not starve. The bad ones, however, deserve to. Especially\n     when some poor misguided Editor accepts their stuff. No, Mr.\n     Bates, I am not placing you in that category. The stories\n     you publish certainly show that you are not misguided. Quite\n     the opposite. At a vote taken among the members of the\n     Scienceers last week, the results showed that reprints were\n     unanimously wanted. In my opinion, Astounding Stories is\n     best fitted for the publishing of reprints because of the\n     high standard it has preserved throughout the year of its\n     existence.\n\n     I have been directed, Mr. Bates, because of the great work\n     you have accomplished in popularizing science through\n     Science Fiction, and because of the keen enjoyment you have\n     given the Scienceers during 1930, to inform you that you\n     have been elected an honorary member of the Scienceers.\n\n     The Scienceers is now taking a vote among all its members to\n     find out their favorite stories of 1930. That is, in Science\n     Fiction. We want to find the five best serials, and the ten\n     best short stories of the year. First returns indicate that\n     Astounding Stories captured most of the honors. \"Murder\n     Madness,\" \"Brigands of the Moon\" and \"Earth, the Marauder\"\n     having places among the serials. About six of the ten short\n     stories were also published in Astounding Stories.\n\n     I close with best wishes from all Scienceers for a bigger\n     and better year for Astounding Stories. Happy\n     birthday!--Nathan Greenfeld, President, Scienceers, 873\n     Whitlock Avenue, New York, New York.\n\n\n_Words Are Weak_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     It was a terrible storm!\n\n     The thunder roared; the lightning flashed; the wind howled;\n     the tempest beat through the night, bearing on its fleet\n     winds of darkness a torrent of driving, splattering rain.\n     Splintering darts of lightning crackled through the raging\n     storm, their crystalline reflection caught in the driving\n     sheets of watery spray; their swift illumination lighting\n     but dimly a rocky shore beaten and tossed by black lashing\n     waves of the angry ocean. And, upon that ragged,\n     element-swept shore, cowered the Searcher.\n\n     He crouched there in the darkness, his muffled figure\n     swaying to the fierce tug of the wind and the impact of the\n     driving rain. Water ran in streams from his drenched\n     clothing. The icy breath of the wind pierced through to his\n     soul like so many needles of death. Placing a gaunt, weary\n     hand above his brow he strained his vision to pierce out\n     into the darkness.\n\n     And suddenly the storm ceased. The rain disappeared with a\n     last futile spray, and the dark clouds overhead parted\n     sullenly to reveal a cold frozen moon of silver. The\n     thousands of tiny aberrations in the tossing wavelets on\n     the ocean's bottom sent steely reflection of the moon's\n     luminescence in sparkling sheens to the Searcher's eyes. For\n     long he hung there motionless, a gaunt shadow peering into\n     the distant darkness of the horizon. But abruptly--\n\n     He started. He has sighted an object floating inward upon\n     the tide. Running swiftly along the shore, he seized it\n     eagerly as it fell to the shore at his feet. With a wild cry\n     of exuberant delight he threw himself down upon the sands to\n     scan its pages. It was a copy of Astounding Stories! Yes!\n\n     Out of the great ocean of magazine fiction it had come to\n     the Searcher's eyes, the magazine supreme--Astounding\n     Stories! A magazine which was new, a magazine which\n     expressed something new in an entirely different way! A\n     thing super-ordinary, it was--a boon to the tired fiction\n     reader.\n\n     Yessirree! Something new and in a different way! You bet\n     that's what I like, and that's why I halted, hearkened, and\n     hastened to the newsstands to buy that new magazine,\n     Astounding Stories. New authors!--a breath of delicious\n     novelty!--the magazine of to-morrow's romance and the\n     super-science thereof! Why, it's almost too good to be true,\n     and here am I, ready to take that new mag to hand and make\n     it our own.\n\n     Yes, I think we can call it \"our\" own, for with the\n     installation of Astounding Stories comes the new epic of the\n     magazine, a magazine which is made by the reader. Sure\n     nuff--our wants and whims rule the magazine; so it's surely\n     \"ours,\" and I mean possessively!\n\n     So, Readers all, I'm going to take my part of the magazine\n     this day and operate on it, no matter what Mr. Bates thinks\n     or cares about it. Yes, sir.\n\n     First, I'm creating a new department of a page which prints\n     the picture of the most popular author (as voted for by the\n     reader) and which gives a brief synopsis of his life. Once\n     his picture has been printed, that's enough. Next time a new\n     author.\n\n     And then I'm filling that magazine with new \"different\"\n     stories, daring in aspect beyond ordinary Science Fiction,\n     more glorious by far than any predecessors.\n\n     And now, the rest of you Readers, what are you going to do\n     with your share? As I have said, I am going to do what I\n     want with my part even if we have to split up the magazine\n     and pass a page all around. There's just a lot of you\n     Readers who look at a magazine, and, because it isn't your\n     ideal, pass it up and go down the line passing up all the\n     magazines. Take it from me, you'll never find your ideal.\n\n     Savvy? The only way to get that ideal is to step in and take\n     a hand. Make your ideal! A magazine must be fashioned to the\n     reader's wants! The fact is our weapon, and believe me I'm\n     beaning Mr. Bates a smacking good one with it. As I said,\n     the magazine is ours, and my part in it surely is going to\n     be more daring in tone, thought and structure than any\n     paltry nowaday Science Fiction! Reach out into the\n     imagination, stretch your faintest and most super-ordinary\n     scientific hypothesis to its vaguest straining point, and\n     produce--\n\n     A real, honest-to-goodness, glorious he-man action magazine\n     of Science Fiction!\n\n     I mean it! And that's how my page is gonna be, and I'll bet\n     that I have made my page of that future idealistic magazine,\n     merely by writing this letter! How about it, Mr. Bates?\n\n     Aren't we all signed up as associate editors for the future\n     \"ideal magazine?\"--Tom Olog, 940--5th St., San Bernardino,\n     Calif.\n\n\n_Right! One on Us_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have been following with great interest Ray Cummings'\n     latest piece, \"Jetta of the Lowlands,\" which is rather\n     unique in its ideas. In a recent issue Mr. Cummings\n     explained to his readers that the flyer was made invisible\n     by bending the light rays around it. This in itself is quite\n     plausible, but when he tells us he could see the land below\n     them, and the other flyer, we have to draw a line. It is\n     quite plain that if the light is bent away from the hull of\n     the flyer that no light will come to the eyes within, and\n     that the invisibility will be more of a hindrance than an\n     advantage. However, it was a good story and we know that\n     authors cannot be perfect any more than ordinary humans can.\n\n     I am wishing you the best of luck for your second year,\n     which you will soon enter!--W. Johnston, New York City.\n\n\n_A Riddle_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have only read two issues of Astounding Stories. These two\n     have determined me to continue reading A. S. until I grow\n     broke or give up my ghost.\n\n     The only brickbats that you are going to get are: Use a\n     better grade of paper and bind the magazines more securely.\n     Your stories are O. K. In fact there is only one story in\n     the two issues (October and November), that I did not give a\n     darn about, and that was \"The Extra Man,\" by Jackson Gee.\n\n     As I have been a reader of Science Fiction for the past four\n     years I think that I know a little about a good story when I\n     read one.\n\n     And last but not least, I have a riddle to ask you.\n\n     Question: What is the difference between an egg and a copy\n     of Astounding Stories?\n\n     Answer: When an egg falls it busts. But when a copy of\n     Astounding Stories falls only the cover comes off.\n\n     A steady reader from now on.--Edward Anderson, 929 S.\n     Westlake Ave., Los Angeles, Calif.\n\n\n\"_High Literary Quality_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Just a few words to express my appreciation of the\n     consistently high standard of stories which have so far\n     appeared in Astounding Stories. I was mainly inspired to\n     write to you by those two fine stories, \"Brigands of the\n     Moon,\" by Ray Cummings and \"Murder Madness,\" by Murray\n     Leinster. The former was one of the year's best\n     interplanetary stories, and the latter a very fine adventure\n     yarn. As well as being of scientific interest, these stories\n     held my interest to the end by reason of their high literary\n     quality and the fact that they did not lack excitement. I am\n     afraid that these two qualities are lacking in a large\n     number of Science Fiction stories. I would suggest that you\n     accept these stories as a standard for the magazine.--A. M.\n     D. Pender, 201, Red Lion Road, Tolworth, Surbiton, Surrey,\n     England.\n\n\n_Expert Testimony_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     We had quite a little discussion at a recent meeting of The\n     Scienceers as to why all of us consider Astounding Stories\n     the best Science Fiction magazine printed to-day. One reason\n     to which all of us agreed was your endless variety of good\n     continued stories. They always have a new twist about them.\n     I read a number of Science Fiction magazines each month.\n     None of them comes anywhere near Astounding Stories as to\n     the quality of the stories printed. On both long and short\n     stories they rank way below the Astounding standard.\n\n     Your best writer is Ray Cummings, with Harl Vincent and R.\n     F. Starzl close behind. I consider \"Vagabonds of space,\" by\n     Harl Vincent, as the best story I have read so far. Ask Mr.\n     Vincent to give us a sequel.--Herbert Smith, Sec.,\n     Scienceers, 2791 Grand Concourse, Bronx, New York City.\n\n\n\"_Heads My List_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I'm accepting your kind invitation to come over to \"The\n     Readers' Corner\" and express my opinion of your magazine.\n\n     I like it immensely. I read all the Science Fiction I can,\n     and your magazine heads my list. I think the serial \"The\n     Pirate Planet,\" is as interesting a story as any I've read.\n     Astounding Stories improves with every issue.--Dorothea\n     Cutler, P.O. Box 122, Mesa, Arizona.\n\n\n_Two Problems_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     My last letter was entirely commendatory, but this time I am\n     losing the full force of my critical powers (?) on the story\n     \"Marooned Under the Sea,\" by Paul Ernst. In this story the\n     characters descend to the depths of the ocean by means of a\n     large glass sphere. Mr. Ernst mentions the terrific strain\n     on the supporting cable caused by the weight of the sphere.\n     He quite overlooks the fact that it would float. As a matter\n     of fact the sphere, not counting its contents, weighs about\n     3,511,520 lbs.--less than an equal amount of water. Hard to\n     believe, but true, as the figures show. The formula for the\n     volume of a sphere is V equals pi 1/2 diameter cubed. It is\n     a pretty little problem. Also, there was no need to break\n     the helmets of the Quabos, since the hoses could be cut with\n     an ax. However, it was a fine story. Let's have more like\n     it.\n\n     Here is another problem. X equals wonderful. Y equals\n     superb. Z equals marvelous. XYZ equals Astounding Stories.\n     Yes? No?\n\n     You are getting many requests to change your size. Don't do\n     it. As it is now, it is just the size to carry conveniently,\n     or put in your pocket. It is easier to read, too. Don't\n     change your grade of paper, either. Glazed paper is hard on\n     the eyes. I join my fervent prayers to those who wish the\n     edges cut smooth, however. It is hard to turn to the page\n     you want, with the deckle edge you now have.\n\n     \"Earth, the Marauder\" was wonderful. Too bad it wasn't\n     longer. \"The Pirate Planet\" is fine. Dr. Bird is keeping up\n     the good work. Some of his stories are a bit far-fetched,\n     but that is no drawback.\n\n     I notice that some authors repeat themselves. I read\n     \"Brigands of the Moon,\" by Cummings, and also his story,\n     \"Tarrano the Conqueror.\" The weapons used in both stories\n     are identical--Hugh M. Gilmore, 11307 N. Orange Drive,\n     Hollywood, California.\n\n\n_Concerning \"Indisputable Data\"_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     From the time Astounding Stories first made its debut, I\n     have been a rabid and enthusiastic reader of your excellent\n     publication. As yet, I have never missed an issue, and only\n     a physical incapability could compel me to. The unlimited\n     amount of pleasure derived from your magazine is beyond\n     compensation. Your selections are varied, interesting and\n     based on cold, scientific logic, barring minor\n     discrepancies. My whole-hearted approval, commendation and\n     good wishes go to you for your remarkably fine work.\n     Continue along the lines you are now pursuing, and I feel\n     assured your magazine will outrival all others in\n     circulation, as it already does in literature.\n\n     Perhaps I have been a trifle flowery, but I also have a\n     criticism to make. Why do these skeptical and scientifically\n     disposed critics continue to waste your valuable time\n     picking scientific flaws in various stories? Some of the\n     amateur experts' opinions really serve as a comic sequel\n     after a night of interesting reading. If they would only\n     stop to realize that some of their most indisputable data is\n     merely hypothesis, the criticisms might be more lenient.\n\n     I am certainly enjoying \"The Pirate Planet,\" by Charles W.\n     Diffin, in the current issue. It is exceptionally\n     well-written, and I am looking forward to more work by his\n     pen. Other stories of merit are \"Gray Denim,\" by Harl\n     Vincent and \"Slaves of the Dust,\" by S. W. Ellis.\n\n     Well, I guess I've unburdened myself enough for one evening.\n     I give you many thanks for hours of enjoyable recreation,\n     and wish everlasting success to your illustrious magazine\n     and the personnel that makes it possible.--Mortimer\n     Weisinger, 266 Van Cortland Ave., Bronx, N. Y.\n\n\n_A Letter from England_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     You will no doubt be surprised at receiving a letter of\n     appreciation of your really stunning magazine from England.\n     And here let me say as an aside, that I think Americans are\n     very fortunate in having publishing concerns who are not\n     afraid of publishing a modern book like Astounding Stories.\n     In England I am considered abnormal minded because of my\n     fondness for Science Fiction. We have nothing like it in our\n     bookshops, where the stereotyped thriller and prosaic life\n     and adventure novels are popular to the majority of English\n     Readers.\n\n     Unfortunately, my file is incomplete by the June, July,\n     August and September issues. My only kick is that \"Brigands\n     of the Moon\" remains unfinished for me; and \"Murder Madness\"\n     whetted my palate for more. Still I am happy to be now in\n     regular contact with the mag and hope for more stories like\n     the above. Now for my only brickbat. Of all the stories I\n     have read, \"The Wall of Death\" is the only one I dislike;\n     and the worst of it is that it was written by Victor\n     Rousseau, who is one of my favorite authors. The story is\n     horribly reminiscent of the old Greek myth of the Minotaur,\n     which it resembles in many phases. Still, this is an\n     exception that proves Victor Rousseau's stories to be of\n     high average value. And I shall expect to see more of him.\n\n     As regards bouquets, I can only say that each succeeding\n     magazine is more astounding, more wonderful and of better\n     value than the last. Of your authors I class as favorites S.\n     P. Meek, C. W. Diffin, Murray Leinster, Harl Vincent, Ray\n     Cummings and S. P. Wright among others, not forgetting\n     Victor Rousseau. In the current edition I think \"The Pirate\n     Planet\" is going strong; and \"Gray Denim\" is a peach of a\n     story, as is also \"The Ape-Men of Xloti.\" I like\n     extra-dimensional stories of which I see you have one in\n     your next issue, so roll on, January! I should like to see\n     Astounding Stories printed more often, or else have a\n     brother mag. The mag itself stands pat as it is, and more\n     power to your authors' elbows! You will please excuse my bad\n     penmanship, but since the war, in which I served throughout,\n     I cannot altogether control the nerves of my right hand when\n     writing.\n\n     I wish you a prosperous future with Astounding Stories!--Leo\n     Greenhill, 5 Market Terrace, St. Leonards on Sea, Sussex,\n     England.\n\n\n\"_At Last It's Come_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have read all the issues of your magazine from the July\n     issue to the December, and it sure fills a long felt need in\n     Science Fiction. Ever since I knew what an atom was I've\n     been longing for just such a mag, and at last it's come. You\n     sure deserve credit, and lots of it. You were better at the\n     very start than your competitors ever will be, and that's\n     saying a lot, as they're pretty good. By the way, you may\n     have noticed that one of them has come down to your size and\n     price since your mag came out. That's proof against big\n     mags. They're awful. However, I would not mind an Astounding\n     Stories quarterly, and I'd gladly pay fifty cents for one.\n     As to reprints, I'm in favor of them. I think a story by\n     Edgar Rice Burroughs running in your mag each month would\n     make it just about perfect.\n\n     As to your authors and stories, they're good as a general\n     rule; however, you've made some pretty bad slips at times,\n     such as \"The Invisible Death,\" by Victor Rousseau, \"The Wall\n     of Death,\" by the same man, \"Slaves of the Dust,\" \"Gray\n     Denim\" and \"The Ape-Men of Xloti.\" In fact, the December\n     issue was pretty poor for you. I hope you make up for it\n     next month.\n\n     When it comes to artists I think that Wesso takes the cake,\n     especially in drawing machinery, etc. However, Gould is good\n     on people and inanimate things, and I don't think you should\n     drop him as many seem to wish. I like Wesso's covers very\n     much, and I don't think they are too gaudy for a magazine\n     like yours.\n\n     I like nearly all Science Fiction stories if they are\n     written well, but especially I lean toward interplanetary,\n     atomic adventure and prehistoric stories. I do not care so\n     much for murders, wars, mind control, etc. I notice that you\n     have never printed a story of prehistoric conditions\n     existing at present on some part of the earth or universe,\n     and I would like to see one of this type. I like serials\n     only if they do not get boresome; and a lot of them do. That\n     is the trouble. I think that the love interest in your\n     stories is a good point, and should be encouraged in your\n     authors. And I also think there should be more\n     interplanetary friendship than hatred, and that the heroes\n     should fight beasts rather than men, as a rule, in your\n     stories.\n\n     Just one more thing before I close. I think that Astounding\n     Stories should have more than one department. I would like\n     to see a list of scientific terms defined each month; a\n     department for answering scientific questions; and some kind\n     of fraternity of Science Fiction Readers with membership\n     cards, some kind of emblems, and possibly an entrance test\n     of some kind. Seriously, now, why not consider this and take\n     up a vote among your Readers to see what they think? You\n     could cut down on \"The Readers' Corner\" for them without\n     using much more space, or you could enlarge the mag a\n     little. What say?\n\n     Well, I'm about out of Z-ray so I guess I'll come back to\n     earth and refuel with the January issue, which will be out\n     soon. So long and good luck.--Frank Missman, Jr., V. E. R.\n     (Very Enthusiastic Reader), 739 N. Alexandria, Los Angeles,\n     Calif.\n\n\n_Gr-r-r--She's Mad!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Gr-r-r, now I am mad! I do wish that people who want a\n     regular instruction book of a magazine would kindly refrain\n     from spending their valuable pennies on ours.\n\n     And if Mr. Johnston of Newark believes us who like A. S. to\n     be morons, why let's be morons! for when ignorance is bliss,\n     'tis folly to be wise. I'd like to inform this highly\n     intelligent person that our mag is dealing with pure Science\n     Fiction, and why should any author go into detail describing\n     how cities are made to float and why invisible cloaks are\n     invisible? Why, if every paragraph were broken off to let us\n     know how this or that is possible, I'm sure we'd all be\n     yawning and nodding over the magazine, and finally discard\n     it entirely in search of something more to our liking!\n\n     Why waste your time, Mr. Johnston, telling us you don't like\n     A. S.? Just don't purchase it, if it isn't to your liking.\n     We're satisfied with what we have.\n\n     What if the stories are like fairy tales? Isn't all fiction\n     more or less of a fairy tale? I want Mr. Johnston to get\n     this point: what we want is fiction, pure Science Fiction\n     and not instructions. We read A. S. as a pleasure. We do not\n     have to be scientists just because we are interested in\n     science!\n\n     \"The Wall of Death\" was grand. It's somewhat terrorizing and\n     gruesome, but I get a big \"kick\" out of such horrors.\n     However, I hope nothing like that would ever happen, 'cause\n     I'm 18 years old, and I'd be among the first ones to be\n     chosen for those mad half-human jelly-fishes, without a\n     doubt.\n\n     I shudder to think that meteors could be hurled from one\n     planet to another and then have some kind of machine, with\n     people in it, on the inside of the meteor. But the hero of\n     \"The Gray Plague\" surely proved himself a hero, in spite of\n     his handicap. I relish the idea of that Venusian instrument,\n     by which one can learn all from another within a few\n     minutes. Something for our students who cannot seem to learn\n     anything.\n\n     Here's one point that I don't like: Why are all those\n     invaders from other planets hostile? Why can't they go on an\n     exploring expedition to our Earth? C'm'on, you Authors--get\n     busy!\n\n     \"The Pirate Planet\" has me all hot and bothered, and my\n     brain in a muddle how any craft of such dimension can move\n     through space with such speed. As the story has just\n     started, I can't say much about it, but here's hoping the\n     captured hero conquers the hostile invaders and comes home\n     with bells on and colors flying, as all good stories should\n     end.\n\n     That Sargasso Sea, in \"Vagabonds of Space,\" reminds me of a\n     Halloween ghost. And it was just as bad as a ghost, too.\n     After having been scattered once, it just coolly collects\n     itself into twice its size. Br-r-r--that gives me the\n     chills. Howsoever, nevertheless, be that as it may, I will\n     say that I liked it so much that I'm asking for more like\n     it.\n\n     Another word to ye Authors: Please do not always have the\n     girls in your stories such sweet little bundles of humanity.\n     Aren't there any tall girls in your imaginations? Please\n     give us tall girls a break once in a while. It makes me feel\n     better. Thanks.--Gertrude Hemken, 5730 So. Oshland Ave.,\n     Chicago, Ill.\n\n\n\"_Also Amazed ... But--_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Since my good friend, Forrest Ackerman has undertaken to\n     suggest an author whose works would be enjoyed by your\n     readers, I will add two more to your \"should have\" list.\n     They are Francis Flagg, an author who is freely engraved in\n     the minds of all Science Fiction lovers as a genius at\n     writing time-traveling and dimensional stories, and Jack\n     Williamson, a shark for new plots and inventions and one who\n     knows how to put romance into a story.\n\n     Although I doubt whether the Editor himself can secure\n     stories from these two famed authors, (Wrong! At this time\n     we have two or three stories by Jack Williamson waiting\n     their turn to be published!--Ed.) I hope they may see our\n     wants and favor us with a tale in the near future.\n\n     I agree with George E. Addison in that Miles J. Bruer is a\n     \"wow\" in other magazines, but I emphatically disagree in\n     that he does not belong in Astounding Stories. Maybe \"A\n     Problem in Communication\" wasn't as good as some others he\n     has written, but do you think he will honor us with a real\n     good story if he, himself, gets such a welcome as Mr.\n     Addison gave him? If you have faith in \"the good old Doc,\" I\n     am sure he will feel encouraged and consequently be spurred\n     to greater heights.\n\n     As for Mr. C. E. Bush: I am also amazed by some of the\n     letters in \"The Readers' Corner,\" but not from those who\n     take their literature too seriously. Rather, from those who\n     write letters such as his. If he doesn't care whether a\n     story is scientifically possible or not, why, then, doesn't\n     he read Anderson's Fairy Tales or some of the Oz books?--Jim\n     H. Nicolson, 40 Lunado Way, San Francisco, Calif.\n\n\n\"_Shrewd,\" Yet Somehow Obtuse!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I like your magazine. By this, I do not mean that it is the\n     best Science Fiction periodical, for it assuredly is not;\n     but it is the most reliable. I am sure when I pick up your\n     magazine that I shall find therein consistently interesting\n     stories. I have yet to find a story that failed to hold my\n     attention; on the other hand, I have yet to find a\n     masterpiece. Of all the Editors, you have shown yourself the\n     shrewdest judge of public taste, but also the least\n     interested in the advancement of Science Fiction.\n\n     Your authors are among the leading lights in Science\n     Fiction; yet, strangely, the days when they submit their\n     offerings to Astounding Stories seem to be \"off days.\" Not\n     one of them has given us a story to equal his best for the\n     other magazines. For instance, Ray Cummings has yet to write\n     a story for you as entertaining as \"The Girl in the Golden\n     Atom\" or his others. Speaking of Cummings, I wish he would\n     take a course in grammar. His grammatical atrocities--such\n     as sentences without predicates--are eye-wracking.\n\n     The main purpose of this letter, however, is to offer a\n     fervent plea for reprints. I am unalterably opposed to your\n     short-sighted policy in regard to the reprinting of old\n     Science Fiction tales long out of print. You made an utterly\n     asinine statement when you declared that 99 per cent of your\n     readers have already read these classics. [We did not say\n     that. We said: \"Would it be fair to 99 per cent of our\n     Readers to force on them reprint novels they have already\n     read, or had a chance to read?\"--Ed.] I am willing to wager\n     that the percentage is nearer 10 per cent. For instance, can\n     a baby read magazines? You seem to grant them this strange\n     ability.\n\n     Most of the stories that should be reprinted were published\n     from eight to fifteen years ago, in one other magazine. That\n     automatically excludes all those who have not been constant\n     Readers of that one magazine. In the second place, the\n     average Reader of your magazine is under twenty-one (I am\n     eighteen myself). When the science classics were published,\n     we were anywhere from four to ten years of age. In the third\n     place, relatively few of these stories were published in\n     book form, and these few have for years been out of print.\n     Try to buy \"The Moon Pool,\" the greatest Science Fiction\n     story ever written, in book form. In the fourth place, even\n     those who were old enough to understand them did not become\n     interested in Science Fiction until several years ago. In\n     the fifth place, the few who have read them--and they are\n     very few--would welcome the chance to re-read them. In the\n     sixth place, and this is the most important reason of all,\n     not one of the stories you have published is worth\n     re-reading, or is even a sixteenth as good as some of the\n     old stories.\n\n     Take a sporting offer. If you don't, I won't think much of\n     you. Publish just one of the Science Fiction classics,\n     preferably A. Merritt's \"Through the Dragon Class,\" which so\n     many of your Readers have clamored for and see how\n     gratifying is its reception. If it does receive their\n     acclaim, you could reprint one story in each issue.--J.\n     Vernon Shea, Jr., 1140 N. Negley Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pa.\n\n\n\"_Right Formula_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have been a satisfied and silent reader of your magazine,\n     and while I'm still satisfied, I wish to break my silence.\n\n     A letter by C.E. Bush, of Decatur, Ark., in the January\n     issue has caught my attention. Miss Bush apparently does not\n     care whether the stories contain science or not. I believe\n     she wants the author to leave out the scientific\n     explanations of the various machines and forces used in the\n     story. To me, an \"improbable\" story is much more interesting\n     if the author succeeds in making it seem perfectly\n     plausible. The author needs to give technical explanations\n     now and then to do this; and a good author can weave these\n     facts into the fiction in such a manner that they are not\n     dry.\n\n     For some reason, the letter by M. Clifford Johnston, of\n     Newark, N. J., antagonizes me. I am willing to admit that\n     there are--or were--one or two stories that showed a\n     definite lack of scientific explanation in certain parts,\n     yet I do not believe that all the issues can be condemned\n     because of these few stories. Mr. Johnston is apparently the\n     opposite of Miss Bush. He, from the \"sound\" of his letter,\n     revels in scientific explanations. On the whole I've enjoyed\n     practically every story, and am thankful to you for your\n     magazine. I believe that most of the authors have found the\n     right formula for mixing their explanations with the story\n     so that such technical discussions are complete without\n     being dry.\n\n     I enjoy the novelettes more than either the short stories or\n     the serials. The serials are all right, but a month is too\n     long to let the hero or heroine suffer. Imagine how WE\n     suffer, too, from the suspense!\n\n     If either Miss Bush or Mr. Johnston feel that they have been\n     misunderstood and wronged in any way I shall be glad to\n     either apologize or vindicate myself in a personal letter to\n     them.\n\n     May Astounding Stories continue to improve!--Ben Smith, Box\n     1542, Butte, Montana.\n\n\n_Fiction's the Thing!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Hurrah for Mr. Lorenzo's letter in January's \"The Readers'\n     Corner\"! For a half year already, all other Science Fiction\n     magazines have had to struggle along without my patronage,\n     also. For the same reason as Mr. Lorenzo gives, I want to\n     heartily congratulate you, Mr. Editor, on your magazine.\n\n     I have read Science Fiction stories since the first magazine\n     of its kind ever appeared in print. They started out good,\n     but in the last few years have utterly degenerated into a\n     collection of dry, drawn-out lectures.\n\n     Also, C. E. Bush's letter should be rated as 100 per cent\n     correct. We want FICTION mixed with some science, and above\n     all a good plot and lots of action; and if your authors feel\n     so inclined, let them weave a romance into the stories, too.\n     \"We read stories to be amused, not for technical\n     information.\" I am a radio operator, but I wouldn't think of\n     reading a story for information on the latest transmitter\n     design.\n\n     Mr. Editor, your choice of authors is par excellence. I\n     can't too highly emphasize this, because we don't want the\n     authors who write for other Science Fiction magazines. Why?\n     Because they can't even write a story that has a semblance\n     of coherence or plot to it, and never any action. If you\n     should ever use any of these writers, I shall give up\n     Science Fiction altogether. Please, Mr. Editor, continue to\n     run Astounding Stories yourself, and don't heed the request\n     of a minority who want dead authors to write dead stories in\n     our magazine.\n\n     \"The Pirate Planet\" is the fastest moving, best written\n     interplanetary story I have ever read, and I've read scores.\n     C. W. Diffin surpasses himself. \"Vagabonds of Space\" was\n     great. Isn't a sequel possible?\n\n     I have your January issue before me, and although I haven't\n     read it yet, I'm delighted to see Murray Leinster with us\n     again. He's excellent. I can't figure out how you can afford\n     so many top-notch authors in each issue, but keep it up,\n     because it's the life of your magazine. As Mr. Addison says\n     in his letter, \"Why ruin a truly great magazine by catering\n     to a misguided minority?\" and printing flops by cheap\n     writers, who are ruining other Science Fiction magazines?\n\n     Forgive me for so much repetition, Mr. Editor; run your\n     magazine \"as is\" and I'll continue to be an interested\n     reader.--P.C. Favre, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\n\n_For Blushers_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I noticed in a letter in the December number of Astounding\n     Stories that one of your Readers thinks your covers too\n     gaudy. In fact, he blushes when he buys it. If he feels that\n     way about it, why doesn't he subscribe to it and take the\n     cover off when he reads it? I believe that the majority of\n     your Readers like your covers and illustrations, and are not\n     afraid to let people see them reading Astounding Stories.\n\n     I wish that you could have a long novelette like \"The\n     Ape-Men of Xloti\" in every issue of \"our\" magazine. The\n     longer stories are most always the more interesting. That is\n     one of the reasons why I like book-length serials.\n\n     Why should Five-Novels Monthly get all the breaks? I am sure\n     that you as the Editor of \"our\" magazine think Astounding\n     Stories the best magazine published by Mr. Clayton. I should\n     think that you would like to see it published in as good an\n     edition as F. N. M. I am pretty sure that the majority of\n     your Readers would not mind paying five cents more for many\n     more pages of fiction, smooth-cut edges, and a better grade\n     of paper.--Jack Darrow, 4225 N. Spaulding Avenue, Chicago,\n     Illinois.\n\n\n\"_The Readers' Corner_\"\n\nAll Readers are extended a sincere and cordial invitation to \"come\nover in 'The Readers' Corner',\" and join in our monthly discussion of\nstories, authors, scientific principles and possibilities--everything\nthat's of common interest in connection with our Astounding Stories.\n\nAlthough from time to time the Editor may make a comment or so, this\nis a department primarily for _Readers_, and we want you to make full\nuse of it.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
