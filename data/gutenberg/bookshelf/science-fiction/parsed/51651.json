Of course,\n              that was precisely why they were dangerous!\n\n\nThere was no use hanging around after breakfast. His wife was in a hurt\nmood, and he could neither endure the hurt nor remove it. He put on his\ncoat in the kitchen and stood for a moment with his hat in his hands.\nHis wife was still at the table, absently fingering the handle of her\ncup and staring fixedly out the window at the kennels behind the house.\nHe moved quietly up behind her and touched her silk-clad shoulder. The\nshoulder shivered away from him, and her dark hair swung shiningly as\nshe shuddered. He drew his hand back and his bewildered face went slack\nand miserable.\n\n\"Honeymoon's over, huh?\"\n\nShe said nothing, but shrugged faintly.\n\n\"You knew I worked for the F.B.A.,\" he said. \"You knew I'd have charge\nof a district pound. You knew it before we got married.\"\n\n\"I didn't know you killed them,\" she said venomously.\n\n\"I won't have to kill many. Besides, they're only animals.\"\n\n\"_Intelligent_ animals!\"\n\n\"Intelligent as a human imbecile, maybe.\"\n\n\"A small child is an imbecile. Would you kill a small child?\"\n\n\"You're taking intelligence as the only criterion of humanity,\" he\nprotested hopelessly, knowing that a logical defense was useless\nagainst sentimentality. \"Baby--\"\n\n\"Don't call me baby! Call _them_ baby!\"\n\nNorris backed a few steps toward the door. Against his better judgment,\nhe spoke again. \"Anne honey, look! Think of the _good_ things about the\njob. Sure, everything has its ugly angles. But think--we get this house\nrent-free; I've got my own district with no bosses around; I make my\nown hours; you'll meet lots of people that stop in at the pound. It's a\n_fine_ job, honey!\"\n\nShe sipped her coffee and appeared to be listening, so he went on.\n\n\"And what can I do? You know how the Federation handles employment.\nThey looked over my aptitude tests and sent me to Bio-Administration.\nIf I don't want to follow my aptitudes, the only choice is common\nlabor. That's the _law_.\"\n\n\"I suppose you have an aptitude for killing babies?\" she said sweetly.\n\nNorris withered. His voice went desperate. \"They assigned me to it\nbecause I _liked_ babies. And because I have a B.S. in biology and an\naptitude for dealing with people. Can't you understand? Destroying\nunclaimed units is the smallest part of it. Honey, before the\nevolvotron, before Anthropos went into the mutant-animal business,\npeople used to elect dogcatchers. Think of it that way--I'm just a\ndogcatcher.\"\n\nHer cool green eyes turned slowly to meet his gaze. Her face was\ndelicately cut from cold marble. She was a small woman, slender and\nfragile, but her quiet contempt made her loom.\n\nHe backed closer to the door.\n\n\"Well, I've got to get on the job.\" He put on his hat and picked at a\nsplinter on the door. He frowned studiously at the splinter. \"I--I'll\nsee you tonight.\" He ripped the splinter loose when it became obvious\nthat she didn't want to be kissed.\n\nHe grunted a nervous good-by and stumbled down the hall and out of the\nhouse. The honeymoon was over, all right.\n\nHe climbed in the kennel-truck and drove east toward the highway. The\nsuburban street wound among the pastel plasticoid cottages that were\nset approximately two to an acre on the lightly wooded land. With its\npopulation legally fixed at three hundred million, most of the country\nhad become one big suburb, dotted with community centers and lined\nwith narrow belts of industrial development. Norris wished there were\nsomeplace where he could be completely alone.\n\nAs he approached an intersection, he saw a small animal sitting on the\ncurb, wrapped in its own bushy tail. Its oversized head was bald on\ntop, but the rest of its body was covered with blue-gray fur. Its tiny\npink tongue was licking daintily at small forepaws with prehensile\nthumbs. It was a cat-Q-5. It glanced curiously at the truck as Norris\npulled to a halt.\n\nHe smiled at it from the window and called, \"What's your name, kitten?\"\n\nThe cat-Q-5 stared at him impassively for a moment, let out a\nstuttering high-pitched wail, then: \"Kiyi Rorry.\"\n\n\"Whose child are you, Rorry?\" he asked. \"Where do you live?\"\n\nThe cat-Q-5 took its time about answering. There were no houses near\nthe intersection, and Norris feared that the animal might be lost.\nIt blinked at him, sleepily bored, and resumed its paw-washing. He\nrepeated the questions.\n\n\"Mama kiyi,\" said the cat-Q-5 disgustedly.\n\n\"That's right, Mama's kitty. But where is Mama? Do you suppose she ran\naway?\"\n\nThe cat-Q-5 looked startled. It stuttered for a moment, and its fur\ncrept slowly erect. It glanced around hurriedly, then shot off down the\nstreet at a fast scamper. He followed it in the truck until it darted\nonto a porch and began wailing through the screen, \"Mama no run ray!\nMama no run ray!\"\n\nNorris grinned and drove on. A class-C couple, allowed no children\nof their own, could get quite attached to a cat-Q-5. The felines\nwere emotionally safer than the quasi-human chimp-K series called\n\"neutroids.\" When a pet neutroid died, a family was broken with grief;\nbut most couples could endure the death of a cat-Q or a dog-F. Class-C\ncouples were allowed two lesser units or one neutroid.\n\nHis grin faded as he wondered which Anne would choose. The Norrises\nwere class-C--defective heredity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe found himself in Sherman III Community Center--eight blocks of\ncommercial buildings, serving the surrounding suburbs. He stopped at\nthe message office to pick up his mail. There was a memo from Chief\nFranklin. He tore it open nervously and read it in the truck. It was\nsomething he had been expecting for several days.\n\n    Attention All District Inspectors:\n    Subject: Deviant Neutroid.\n\n    You will immediately begin a systematic and thorough survey of all\n    animals whose serial numbers fall in the Bermuda-K-99 series for\n    birth dates during July 2234. This is in connection with the\n    Delmont Negligency Case. Seize all animals in this category,\n    impound, and run proper sections of normalcy tests. Watch for\n    mental and glandular deviation. Delmont has confessed to passing\n    only one non-standard unit, but there may be others. He disclaims\n    memory of deviant's serial number. This could be a ruse to bring\n    a stop to investigations when one animal is found. Be thorough.\n\n    If allowed to reach age-set or adulthood, such a deviant could be\n    dangerous to its owner or to others. Hold all seized K-99s who show\n    the slightest abnormality in the normalcy tests. Forward to central\n    lab. Return standard units to their owners. Accomplish entire\n    survey project within seven days.\n\n    C. Franklin\n\nNorris frowned at the last sentence. His district covered about two\nhundred square miles. Its replacement-quota of new neutroids was around\nthree hundred animals a month. He tried to estimate how many of July's\ninflux had been K-99s from Bermuda Factory. Forty, at least. Could he\ndo it in a week? And there were only eleven empty neutroid cages in his\nkennel. The other forty-nine were occupied by the previous inspector's\n\"unclaimed\" inventory--awaiting destruction.\n\nHe wadded the memo in his pocket, then nosed the truck onto the highway\nand headed toward Wylo City and the district wholesale offices of\nAnthropos, Inc. They should be able to give him a list of all July's\nBermuda K-99 serial numbers that had entered his territory, together\nwith the retailers to whom the animals had been sold. A week's deadline\nfor finding and testing forty neutroids would put him in a tight\nsqueeze.\n\nHe was halfway to Wylo City when the radiophone buzzed on his\ndashboard. He pulled into the slow lane and answered quickly, hoping\nfor Anne's voice. A polite professional purr came instead.\n\n\"Inspector Norris? This is Doctor Georges. We haven't met, but I\nimagine we will. Are you extremely busy at the moment?\"\n\nNorris hesitated. \"Extremely,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, this won't take long. One of my patients--a Mrs. Sarah\nGlubbes--called a while ago and said her baby was sick. I must be\ngetting absent-minded, because I forgot she was class C until I got\nthere.\" He hesitated. \"The baby turned out to be a neutroid. It's\ndying. Eighteenth order virus.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"Well, she's--uh--rather a _peculiar_ woman, Inspector. Keeps telling\nme how much trouble she had in childbirth, and how she can't ever\nhave another one. It's pathetic. She _believes_ it's her own. Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" Norris replied slowly. \"But what do you want me to do?\nCan't you send the neutroid to a vet?\"\n\n\"She insists it's going to a hospital. Worst part is that she's heard\nof the disease. Knows it can be cured with the proper treatment--in\nhumans. Of course, no hospital would play along with her fantasy and\ntake a neutroid, especially since she couldn't pay for its treatment.\"\n\n\"I still don't see--\"\n\n\"I thought perhaps you could help me fake a substitution. It's a K-48\nseries, five-year-old, three-year set. Do you have one in the pound\nthat's not claimed?\"\n\nNorris thought for a moment. \"I think I have _one_. You're welcome to\nit, Doctor, but you can't fake a serial number. She'll know it. And\neven though they look exactly alike, the new one won't recognize her.\nIt'll be spooky.\"\n\nThere was a long pause, followed by a sigh. \"I'll try it anyway. Can I\ncome get the animal now?\"\n\n\"I'm on the highway--\"\n\n\"Please, Norris! This is urgent. That woman will lose her mind\ncompletely if--\"\n\n\"All right, I'll call my wife and tell her to open the pound for you.\nPick out the K-48 and sign for it. And listen--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Don't let me catch you falsifying a serial number.\"\n\nDoctor Georges laughed faintly. \"I won't, Norris. Thanks a million.\" He\nhung up quickly.\n\nNorris immediately regretted his consent. It bordered on being illegal.\nBut he saw it as a quick way to get rid of an animal that might later\nhave to be killed.\n\nHe called Anne. Her voice was dull. She seemed depressed, but not\nangry. When he finished talking, she said, \"All right, Terry,\" and hung\nup.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy noon, he had finished checking the shipping lists at the wholesale\nhouse in Wylo City. Only thirty-five of July's Bermuda-K-99s had\nentered his territory, and they were about equally divided among five\npet shops, three of which were in Wylo City.\n\nAfter lunch, he called each of the retail dealers, read them the serial\nnumbers, and asked them to check the sales records for names and\naddresses of individual buyers. By three o'clock, he had the entire\nlist filled out, and the task began to look easier. All that remained\nwas to pick up the thirty-five animals.\n\nAnd _that_, he thought, was like trying to take a year-old baby away\nfrom its doting mother. He sighed and drove to the Wylo suburbs to\nbegin his rounds.\n\nAnne met him at the door when he came home at six. He stood on the\nporch for a moment, smiling at her weakly. The smile was not returned.\n\n\"Doctor Georges came,\" she told him. \"He signed for the--\" She stopped\nto stare at him. \"Darling, your face! What happened?\"\n\nGingerly he touch the livid welts down the side of his cheek. \"Just\nscratched a little,\" he muttered. He pushed past her and went to the\nphone in the hall. He sat eying it distastefully for a moment, not\nliking what he had to do. Anne came to stand beside him and examine the\nscratches.\n\nFinally he lifted the phone and dialed the Wylo exchange. A grating\nmechanical voice answered, \"Locator center. Your party, please.\"\n\n\"Sheriff Yates,\" Norris grunted.\n\nThe robot operator, which had on tape the working habits of each Wylo\nCity citizen, began calling numbers. It found the off-duty sheriff on\nits third try, in a Wylo pool hall.\n\n\"I'm getting so I hate that infernal gadget,\" Yates grumbled. \"I think\nit's got me psyched. What do you want, Norris?\"\n\n\"Cooperation. I'm mailing you three letters charging three Wylo\ncitizens with resisting a Federal official--namely _me_--and charging\none of them with assault. I tried to pick up their neutroids for a\npound inspection--\"\n\nYates bellowed lusty laughter into the phone.\n\n\"It's not funny. I've got to get those neutroids. It's in connection\nwith the Delmont case.\"\n\nYates stopped laughing. \"Oh. Well, I'll take care of it.\"\n\n\"It's a rush-order, Sheriff. Can you get the warrants tonight and pick\nup the animals in the morning?\"\n\n\"Easy on those warrants, boy. Judge Charleman can't be disturbed just\nany time. I can get the newts to you by noon, I guess, provided we\ndon't have to get a helicopter posse to chase down the mothers.\"\n\n\"That'll be all right. And listen, Yates--fix it so the charges will\nbe dropped if they cooperate. Don't shake those warrants around unless\nthey just won't listen to reason. But get those neutroids.\"\n\n\"Okay, boy. Gotcha.\"\n\nNorris gave him the names and addresses of the three unwilling mothers.\nAs soon as he hung up, Anne touched his shoulders and said, \"Sit\nstill.\" She began smoothing a chilly ointment over his burning cheek.\n\n\"Hard day?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not too hard. Those were just three out of fifteen. I got the other\ntwelve. They're in the truck.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" she said. \"You've got only twelve empty cages.\"\n\nHe neglected to tell her that he had stopped at twelve for just this\nreason. \"Guess I better get them unloaded,\" he said, standing up.\n\n\"Can I help you?\"\n\nHe stared at her for a moment, saying nothing. She smiled a little and\nlooked aside. \"Terry, I'm sorry--about this morning. I--I know you've\ngot a job that has to be--\" Her lip quivered slightly.\n\nNorris grinned, caught her shoulders, and pulled her close.\n\n\"Honeymoon's on again, huh?\" she whispered against his neck.\n\n\"Come on,\" he grunted. \"Let's unload some neutroids, before I forget\nall about work.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey went out to the kennels together. The cages were inside a\nsprawling concrete barn, which was divided into three large rooms--one\nfor the fragile neuter humanoid creatures, and another for the lesser\nmutants, such as cat-Qs, dog-Fs, dwarf bears, and foot-high lambs that\nnever matured into sheep. The third room contained a small gas chamber\nwith a conveyor belt leading from it to a crematory-incinerator.\n\nNorris kept the third locked lest his wife see its furnishings.\n\nThe doll-like neutroids began their mindless chatter as soon as their\nkeepers entered the building. Dozens of blazing blond heads began\ndancing about their cages. Their bodies thwacked against the wire mesh\nas they leaped about their compartments with monkey grace.\n\nTheir human appearance was broken by only two distinct features: short\nbeaverlike tails decorated with fluffy curls of fur, and an erect\nthatch of scalp-hair that grew up into a bright candleflame. Otherwise,\nthey appeared completely human, with baby-pink skin, quick little\nsmiles, and cherubic faces. They were sexually neuter and never grew\nbeyond a predetermined age-set which varied for each series. Age-sets\nwere available from one to ten years human equivalent. Once a neutroid\nreached its age-set, it remained at the set's child-development level\nuntil death.\n\n\"They must be getting to know you pretty well,\" Anne said, glancing\naround at the cages.\n\nNorris was wearing a slight frown as he inspected the room. \"They've\nnever gotten this excited before.\"\n\nHe walked along a row of cages, then stopped by a K-76 to stare.\n\n\"_Apple cores!_\" He turned to face his wife. \"How did apples get in\nthere?\"\n\nShe reddened. \"I felt sorry for them, eating that goo from the\nmechanical feeder. I drove down to Sherman III and bought six dozen\ncooking apples.\"\n\n\"That was a mistake.\"\n\nShe frowned irritably. \"We can afford it.\"\n\n\"That's not the point. There's a reason for the mechanical feeders.\" He\npaused, wondering how he could tell her the truth. He blundered on:\n\"They get to love whoever feeds them.\"\n\n\"I can't see--\"\n\n\"How would you feel about disposing of something that loved you?\"\n\nAnne folded her arms and stared at him. \"Planning to dispose of any\nsoon?\" she asked acidly.\n\n\"Honeymoon's off again, eh?\"\n\nShe turned away. \"I'm sorry, Terry. I'll try not to mention it again.\"\n\nHe began unloading the truck, pulling the frightened and squirming\ndoll-things forth one at a time with a snare-pole. They were one-man\npets, always frightened of strangers.\n\n\"What's the Delmont case, Terry?\" Anne asked while he worked.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I heard you mention it on the phone. Anything to do with why you got\nyour face scratched?\"\n\nHe nodded sourly. \"Indirectly, yes. It's a long story.\"\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\n\"Well, Delmont was a green-horn evolvotron operator at the Bermuda\nplant. His job was taking the unfertilized chimpanzee ova out of the\negg-multiplier, mounting them in his machine, and bombarding the\ngene structure with sub-atomic particles. It's tricky business. He\nflashes a huge enlargement of the ovum on the electron microscope\nscreen--large enough so he can see the individual protein molecules. He\nhas an artificial gene pattern to compare it with. It's like shooting\nsub-atomic billiards. He's got to fire alpha-particles into the gene\nstructure and displace certain links by just the right amount. And\nhe's got to be quick about it before the ovum dies from an overdose of\nradiation from the enlarger. A good operator can get one success out of\nseven tries.\n\n\"Well, Delmont worked a week and spoiled over a hundred ova without a\nsingle success. They threatened to fire him. I guess he got hysterical.\nAnyway, he reported one success the next day. It was faked. The ovum\nhad a couple of flaws--something wrong in the central nervous system's\ndeterminants, and in the glandular makeup. Not a standard neutroid\novum. He passed it on to the incubators to get a credit, knowing it\nwouldn't be caught until after birth.\"\n\n\"It wasn't caught at all?\" Anne asked.\n\n\"Funny thing, he was afraid it wouldn't be. He got to worrying about\nit, thought maybe a mental-deviant would pass, and that it might be\ndangerous. So he went back to its incubator and cut off the hormone\nflow into its compartment.\"\n\n\"Why that?\"\n\n\"So it _would_ develop sexuality. A neutroid would be born a female\nif they didn't give it suppressive doses of male hormone prenatally.\nThat keeps ovaries from developing and it comes out neuter. But\nDelmont figured a female would be caught and stopped before the final\ninspection. They'd dispose of her without even bothering to examine for\nthe other defects. And he could blame the sexuality on an equipment\nmalfunction. He thought it was pretty smart. Trouble was they didn't\ncatch the female. She went on through; they all _look_ female.\"\n\n\"How did they find out about it now?\"\n\n\"He got caught last month, trying it again. And he confessed to doing\nit once before. No telling how many times he _really_ did it.\"\n\nNorris held up the final kicking, squealing, tassel-haired doll from\nthe back of the kennel-truck. He grinned at his wife. \"This little\nfellow, for instance. It might be a potential she. It might also be a\npotential murderer. _All_ these kiddos are from the machines in the\nsection where Delmont worked.\"\n\nAnne snorted and caught the baby-creature in her arms. It struggled and\ntried to bite, but subsided a little when she disentangled it from the\nsnare. \"Kkr-r-reee,\" it cooed nervously. \"Kkr-r-reee!\"\n\n\"You tell him you're no murderer,\" Anne purred to it.\n\nNorris watched disapprovingly while she fondled it. One thing he had\nlearned: to steer clear of emotional attachments. It was eight months\nold and looked like a child of two years--a year short of its age-set.\nAnd it was designed to be as affectionate as a human child.\n\n\"Put it in the cage, Anne,\" he said quietly.\n\nShe looked up and shook her head.\n\n\"It belongs to somebody else. If it fixes a libido attachment on you,\nyou're actually robbing its owner. They can't love many people at once.\"\n\nShe snorted, but installed the thing in its cage.\n\n\"Anne--\" Norris hesitated, hating to approach the subject. \"Do\nyou--want one--for yourself? I can sign an unclaimed one over to you to\nkeep in the house. It won't cost us anything.\"\n\nSlowly she shook her head, and her pale eyes went moody and luminous.\n\"I'm going to have one of my own,\" she said.\n\nHe stood in the back of the truck, staring down at her. \"Do you realize\nwhat--\"\n\n\"I know what I'm saying. We're class-C on account of heart-trouble in\nboth our families. Well, I don't care, Terry. I'm not going to waste a\nheart over one of these pathetic little artificial animals. We're going\nto have a baby.\"\n\n\"You know what they'd do to us?\"\n\n\"If they catch us, yes--compulsory divorce, sterilization. But they\nwon't catch us. I'll have it at home, Terry. Not even a doctor. We'll\nhide it.\"\n\n\"I won't let you do such a thing.\"\n\nShe faced him angrily. \"Oh, this whole rotten _world_!\" she choked.\nSuddenly she turned and fled out of the building. She was sobbing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorris climbed slowly down from the truck and wandered on into the\nhouse. She was not in the kitchen nor the living room. The bedroom door\nwas locked. He shrugged and went to sit on the sofa. The television\nset was on, and a newscast was coming from a local station.\n\n\"... we were unable to get shots of the body,\" the announcer was\nsaying. \"But here is a view of the Georges residence. I'll switch you\nto our mobile unit in Sherman II, James Duncan reporting.\"\n\nNorris frowned with bewilderment as the scene shifted to a two-story\nplasticoid house among the elm trees. It was after dark, but the mobile\nunit's powerful floodlights made daylight of the house and its yard and\nthe police 'copters sitting in a side lot. An ambulance was parked in\nthe street. A new voice came on the audio.\n\n\"This is James Duncan, ladies and gentlemen, speaking to you from our\nmobile unit in front of the late Doctor Hiram Georges' residence just\nwest of Sherman II. We are waiting for the stretcher to be brought out,\nand Police Chief Erskine Miler is standing here beside me to give us a\nword about the case. Doctor Georges' death has shocked the community\ndeeply. Most of you local listeners have known him for many years--some\nof you have depended upon his services as a family physician. He was a\nman well known, well loved. But now let's listen to Chief Miler.\"\n\nNorris sat breathing quickly. There could scarcely be two Doctor\nGeorges in the community, but only this morning....\n\nA growling drawl came from the audio. \"This's Chief Miler speaking,\nfolks. I just want to say that if any of you know the whereabouts of a\nMrs. Sarah Glubbes, call me immediately. She's wanted for questioning.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Chief. This is James Duncan again. I'll review the facts\nfor you briefly again, ladies and gentlemen. At seven o'clock,\nless than an hour ago, a woman--allegedly Mrs. Glubbes--burst into\nDoctor Georges' dining room while the family was at dinner. She was\nbrandishing a pistol and screaming, 'You stole my baby! You gave me the\nwrong baby! Where's my baby?'\n\n\"When the doctor assured her that there was no other baby, she fired,\nshattering his salad plate. Glancing off it, the bullet pierced his\nheart. The woman fled. A peculiar feature of the case is that Mrs.\nGlubbes, the alleged intruder, _has no baby_. Just a minute--just a\nminute--here comes the stretcher now.\"\n\nNorris turned the set off and went to call the police. He told them\nwhat he knew and promised to make himself available for questioning if\nit became necessary. When he turned from the phone, Anne was standing\nin the bedroom doorway. She might have been crying a little, but she\nconcealed it well.\n\n\"What was all that?\" she asked.\n\n\"Woman killed a man. I happened to know the motive.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"Neutroid trouble.\"\n\n\"You meet up with a lot of unpleasantness in this business, don't you?\"\n\n\"Lot of unpleasant emotions tangled up in it,\" he admitted.\n\n\"I know. Well, supper's been keeping hot for two hours. Shall we eat?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey went to bed at midnight, but it was after one when he became\ncertain that his wife was asleep. He lay in darkness for a time,\nlistening to her even breathing. Then he cautiously eased himself out\nof bed and tiptoed quietly through the door, carrying his shoes and\ntrousers. He put them on in the kitchen and stole silently out to the\nkennels. A half moon hung low in a misty sky, and the wind was chilly\nout of the north.\n\nHe went into the neutroid room and flicked a switch. A few sleepy\nchatters greeted the light.\n\nOne at a time, he awoke twenty-three of the older doll-things and\ncarried them to a large glass-walled compartment. These were the\nlong-time residents; they knew him well, and they came with him\nwillingly--like children after the Piper of Hamlin. When he had gotten\nthem in the glass chamber, he sealed the door and turned on the gas.\nThe conveyor would automatically carry them on to the incinerator.\n\nNow he had enough cages for the Bermuda-K-99s.\n\nHe hurriedly quit the kennels and went to sit on the back steps. His\neyes were burning, but the thought of tears made him sicker. It was\nlike an assassin crying while he stabbed his victim. It was more honest\njust to retch.\n\nWhen he tiptoed back inside, he got as far as the hall. Then he saw\nAnne's small figure framed in the bedroom window, silhouetted against\nthe moonlit yard. She had slipped into her negligee and was sitting on\nthe narrow windowstool, staring silently out at the dull red tongue of\nexhaust gases from the crematory's chimney.\n\nNorris backed away. He went to the parlor and lay down on the couch.\n\nAfter a while he heard her come into the room. She paused in the center\nof the rug, a fragile mist in the darkness. He turned his face away and\nwaited for the rasping accusation. But soon she came to sit on the edge\nof the sofa. She said nothing. Her hand crept out and touched his cheek\nlightly. He felt her cool finger-tips trace a soft line up his temple.\n\n\"It's all right, Terry,\" she whispered.\n\nHe kept his face averted. Her fingers traced a last stroke. Then she\npadded quietly back to the bedroom. He lay awake until dawn, knowing\nthat it would never be all right, neither the creating nor the killing,\nuntil he--and the whole world--completely lost sanity. And then\neverything would be all right, only it still wouldn't make sense.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnne was asleep when he left the house. The night mist had gathered\ninto clouds that made a gloomy morning of it. He drove on out in the\nkennel-truck, meaning to get the rest of the Bermuda-K-99s so that he\ncould begin his testing.\n\nStill he felt the night's guilt, like a sticky dew that refused to\ndepart with morning. Why should he have to kill the things? The answer\nwas obvious. Society manufactured them because killing them was\npermissible. Human babies could not be disposed of when the market\nbecame glutted. The neutroids offered solace to childless women, kept\nthem satisfied with a restricted birth rate. And why a restricted\nbirth rate? Because by keeping the population at five billions, the\nFederation could insure a decent living standard for everybody.\n\nWhere there was giving, Norris thought glumly, there was also taking\naway. Man had always deluded himself by thinking that he \"created,\" but\nhe created nothing. He thought that he had created--with his medical\nscience and his end to wars--a longer life for the individual. But he\nfound that he had only taken the lives of the unborn and added them to\nthe years of the aged. Man now had a life expectancy of eighty, except\nthat he had damn little chance of being born to enjoy it.\n\nA neutroid filled the cradle in his stead. A neutroid that never ate\nas much, or grew up to be unemployed. A neutroid could be killed if\nthings got tough, but could still satisfy a woman's craving to mother\nsomething small.\n\nNorris gave up thinking about it. Eventually he would have to adjust\nto it. He was already adjusted to a world that loved the artificial\nmutants as children. He had been brought up in it. Emotion came in\nconflict with the grim necessities of his job. Somehow he would have\nto love them in the parlor and kill them in the kennel. It was only a\nmatter of adjustment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt noon, he brought back another dozen K-99s and installed them in his\ncages. There had been two highly reluctant mothers, but he skipped\nthem and left the seizure to the local authorities. Yates had already\nbrought in the three from yesterday.\n\n\"No more scratches?\" Anne asked him while they ate lunch. They did not\nspeak of the night's mass-disposal.\n\nNorris smiled mechanically. \"I learned my lesson yesterday. If\nthey bare their fangs, I get out without another word. Funny thing\nthough--I've got a feeling one mother pulled a fast one.\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"Well, I told her what I wanted and why. She didn't like it, but she\nlet me in. I started out with her newt, but she wanted a receipt. So I\ngave her one; took the serial number off my checklist. She looked at\nit and said, 'Why, that's not Chichi's number!' I looked at the newt's\nfoot, and sure enough it wasn't. I had to leave it. It was a K-99, but\nnot even from Bermuda.\"\n\n\"I thought they were all registered,\" Anne said.\n\n\"They are. I told her she had the wrong neutroid, but she got mad. Went\nand got the sales receipt. It checked with her newt, and it was from\nO'Reilley's pet shop--right place, wrong number. I just don't get it.\"\n\n\"Nothing to worry about, is it Terry?\"\n\nHe looked at her peculiarly. \"Ever think what might happen if someone\nstarted a black market in neutroids?\"\n\nThey finished the meal in silence. After lunch he went out again to\ngather up the rest of the group. By four o'clock, he had gotten all\nthat were to be had without the threat of a warrant. The screams and\npleas and tears of the owners left him gloomily despising himself.\n\nIf Delmont's falsification had been widespread, he might have to turn\nseveral of the thirty-five over to central lab for dissection and\nultimate destruction. That would bring the murderous wrath of their\nowners down upon him. He began to understand why bio-inspectors were\nfrequently shifted from one territory to another.\n\nOn the way home, he stopped in Sherman II to check on the missing\nnumber. It was the largest of the Sherman communities, covering fifty\nblocks of commercial buildings. He parked in the outskirts and took a\nsidewalk escalator toward O'Reilley's address.\n\nIt was on a dingy sidestreet, reminiscent of past centuries, a street\nof small bars and bowling alleys and cigar stores. There was even a\nshop with three gold balls above the entrance, but the place was now\nan antique store. A light mist was falling when he stepped off the\nescalator and stood in front of the pet shop. A sign hung out over the\nsidewalk, announcing:\n\n                         J. \"DOGGY\" O'REILLEY\n                             PETS FOR SALE\n                       DUMB BLONDES AND GOLDFISH\n                       MUTANTS FOR THE CHILDLESS\n                          BUY A BUNDLE OF JOY\n\nNorris frowned at the sign and wandered inside. The place was warm\nand gloomy. He wrinkled his nose at the strong musk of animal odors.\nO'Reilley's was not a shining example of cleanliness.\n\nSomewhere a puppy was yapping, and a parrot croaked the lyrics of _A\nChimp to Call My Own_, which Norris recognized as the theme song of a\npopular soap-opera about a lady evolvotron operator.\n\nHe paused briefly by a tank of silk-draped goldfish. The shop had a\ncustomer. An elderly lady was haggling with a wizened manager over the\nprice of a half grown second-hand dog-F. She was shaking her last dog's\ndeath certificate under his nose and demanding a guarantee of the dog's\nalleged F-5 intelligence. The old man offered to swear on a Bible, but\nhe demurred when it came to swearing on a ledger.\n\nThe dog was saying, \"Don' sell me, Dada. Don' sell me.\"\n\nNorris smiled sardonically to himself. The non-human pets were smarter\nthan the neutroids. A K-108 could speak a dozen words, and a K-99\nnever got farther than \"mamma,\" \"pappa,\" and \"cookie.\" Anthropos was\nafraid to make the quasi-humans too intelligent, lest sentimentalists\nproclaim them really human.\n\nHe wandered on toward the back of the building, pausing briefly by\nthe cash register to inspect O'Reilley's license, which hung in a\ndusty frame on the wall behind the counter. \"James Fallon\nO'Reilley ... authorized dealer in mutant animals ... all non-predatory\nmammals including chimpanzee-K series ... license expires June 1, 2235.\"\n\nIt seemed in order, although the expiration date was approaching. He\nstarted toward a bank of neutroid cages along the opposite wall, but\nO'Reilley was mincing across the floor to meet him. The customer had\ngone. The little manager wore an elfin professional smile, and his bald\nhead bobbled in a welcoming nod.\n\n\"Good day, sir, good day! May I show you a dwarf kangaroo, or a--\" He\nstopped and adjusted his spectacles. He blinked and peered as Norris\nflashed his badge. His smile waned.\n\n\"I'm Agent Norris, Mr. O'Reilley. Called you yesterday for that rundown\non K-99 sales.\"\n\nO'Reilley looked suddenly nervous. \"Oh, yes. Find 'em all?\"\n\nNorris shook his head. \"No. That's why I stopped by. There's some\nmistake on--\" he glanced at his list--\"on K-99-LJZ-351. Let's check it\nagain.\"\n\nO'Reilley seemed to cringe. \"No mistake. I gave you the buyer's name.\"\n\n\"She has a different number.\"\n\n\"Can I help it if she traded with somebody?\"\n\n\"She didn't. She bought it here. I saw the receipt.\"\n\n\"Then she traded with one of my other customers!\" snapped the old man.\n\n\"Two of your customers have the same name--Adelia Schultz? Not likely.\nLet's see your duplicate receipt book.\"\n\nO'Reilley's wrinkled face set itself into a stubborn mask. \"Doubt if\nit's still around.\"\n\nNorris frowned. \"Look, pop, I've had a rough day. I _could_ start\nnaming some things around here that need fixing--sanitary violations\nand such. Not to mention that sign--'dumb blondes.' They outlawed that\none when they executed that shyster doctor for shooting K-108s full\nof growth hormones, trying to raise himself a harem to sell. Besides,\nyou're required to keep sales records until they've been micro-filmed.\nThere hasn't been a microfilming since July.\"\n\nThe wrinkled face twitched with frustrated anger. O'Reilley shuffled\nto the counter while Norris followed. He got a fat binder from under\nthe register and started toward a wooden stairway.\n\n\"Where you going?\" Norris called.\n\n\"Get my old glasses,\" the manager grumbled. \"Can't see through these\nnew things.\"\n\n\"Leave the book here and _I'll_ check it,\" Norris offered.\n\nBut O'Reilley was already limping quickly up the stairs. He seemed not\nto hear. He shut the door behind him, and Norris heard the lock click.\nThe bio-agent waited. Again the thought of a black market troubled him.\nUnauthorized neutroids could mean lots of trouble.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFive minutes passed before the old man came down the stairs. He said\nnothing as he placed the book on the counter. Norris noticed that his\nhands were trembling as he shuffled through the pages.\n\n\"Let _me_ look,\" said the bio-agent.\n\nO'Reilley stepped reluctantly aside. Norris had memorized the owner's\nreceipt number, and he found the duplicate quickly. He stared at it\nsilently. \"Mrs. Adele Schultz ... chimpanzee-K-99-LJZ-351.\" It was\nthe number of the animal he wanted, but it wasn't the number on Mrs.\nSchultz's neutroid nor on her original copy of the receipt.\n\nHe held the book up to his eye and aimed across the page at the light.\nO'Reilley's breathing became audible. Norris put the book down, folded\ntwo thicknesses of handkerchief over the blade of his pocketknife, and\nran it down the seam between the pages. He took the sheet he wanted,\nfolded it, and stowed it in his vest pocket. O'Reilley was stuttering\nangrily.\n\nNorris turned to face him coldly. \"Nice erasure job, for a carbon copy.\"\n\nThe old man prepared himself for exploding. Norris quietly put on his\nhat.\n\n\"See you in court, O'Reilley.\"\n\n\"_Wait!_\"\n\nNorris turned. \"Okay, I'm waiting.\"\n\nThe old man sagged into a deflated bag of wrinkles. \"Let's sit down\nfirst,\" he said weakly.\n\nNorris followed him up the stairs and into a dingy parlor. The tiny\napartment smelled of boiled cabbage and sweat. An orange-haired\nneutroid lay asleep on a small rug in a corner. Norris knelt\nbeside it and read the tattooed figures on the sole of its left\nfoot--K-99-LJZ-351. Somehow he was not surprised.\n\nWhen he stood up, the old man was sagged in an ancient armchair, his\nhead propped on a hand that covered his eyes.\n\n\"Lots of good explanations, I guess?\" Norris asked quietly.\n\n\"Not good ones.\"\n\n\"Let's hear them, anyway.\"\n\nO'Reilley sighed and straightened. He blinked at the inspector\nand spoke in a monotone. \"My missus died five years back. We were\nclass-B--allowed one child of our own--if we could have one. We\ncouldn't. But since we were class-B, we couldn't own a neutroid either.\nSorta got around it by running a pet shop. Mary--she always cried when\nwe sold a neut. I sorta felt bad about it myself. But we never did\nswipe one. Last year this Bermuda shipment come in. I sold most of 'em\npretty quick, but Peony here--she was kinda puny. Seemed like nobody\nwanted her. Kept her around so long, I got attached to her. 'Fraid\nsomebody'd buy her. So I faked the receipt and moved her up here.\"\n\n\"That all?\"\n\nThe old man nodded.\n\n\"Ever done this before?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\nNorris let a long silence pass while he struggled with himself. At last\nhe said, \"Your license could be revoked, you know.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nNorris ground his fist thoughtfully in his palm and stared at the\nsleeping doll-thing. \"I'll take your books home with me tonight,\"\nhe said. \"I want to make a complete check for similar changes. Any\nobjections?\"\n\n\"None. It's the only trick I've pulled, so help me.\"\n\n\"If that's true, I won't report you. We'll just attach a correction\nto that page, and you'll put the newt back in stock.\" He hesitated.\n\"Providing it's not a deviant. I'll have to take it in for examination.\"\n\nA choking sound came from the armchair. Norris stared curiously at the\nold man. Moisture was creeping in the wrinkles around his eyes.\n\n\"Something the matter?\"\n\nO'Reilley nodded. \"She's a deviant.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\nThe dealer pulled himself erect and hobbled to the sleeping neutroid.\nHe knelt beside it and stroked a small bare shoulder gently.\n\n\"Peony,\" he breathed. \"Peony, girl--wake up.\"\n\nIts fluffy tail twitched for a moment. Then it sat up, rubbing its eyes\nand yawning. It _looked_ normal, like a two-year-old girl with soft\nbrown eyes. It pouted at O'Reilley for awakening it. It saw Norris and\nignored him, apparently too sleepy to be frightened.\n\n\"How's my Peony-girl?\" the dealer purred.\n\nIt licked its lips. \"Wanna g'ass o' water, Daddy,\" it said drowsily.\n\nNorris caught his breath. No K-99 should be able to make a speech that\nlong, even when it reached the developmental limit. He glanced at\nO'Reilley. The old man nodded slowly, then went to the kitchen for a\nglass of water. She drank greedily and eyed her foster-parent.\n\n\"Daddy crying.\"\n\nO'Reilley glowered at her and blew his nose solemnly. \"Don't be silly,\nchild. Now get your coat on and go with Mister Norris. He's taking you\nfor a ride in his truck. Won't that be fine?\"\n\n\"I don't want to. I wanna stay here.\"\n\n\"_Peeony!_ On with you!\"\n\nShe brought her coat and stared at Norris with childish contempt. \"Can\nDaddy go, too?\"\n\n\"Be on your way!\" growled O'Reilley. \"I got things to do.\"\n\n\"We're coming back?\"\n\n\"Of course you're coming back! _Git_ now--or shall I get my spanking\nswitch?\"\n\nPeony strolled out the door ahead of Norris.\n\n\"Oh, inspector, would you be punching the night latch for me as you\nleave the shop? I think I'll be closing for the day.\"\n\nNorris paused at the head of the stairs, looking back at the old man.\nBut O'Reilley closed himself inside and the lock clicked. The agent\nsighed and glanced down at the small being beside him.\n\n\"Want me to carry you, Peony?\"\n\nShe sniffed disdainfully. She hopped upon the banister and slid down\nahead of him. Her motor-responses were typically neutroid--something\nlike a monkey, something like a squirrel. But there was no question\nabout it; she was one of Delmont's deviants. He wondered what they\nwould do with her in central lab. He could remember no instance of an\nintelligent mutant getting into the market.\n\nSomehow he could not consign her to a cage in the back of the truck. He\ndrove home while she sat beside him on the front seat. She watched the\nscenery and remained aloof, occasionally looking around to ask, \"Can we\ngo back now?\"\n\nNorris could not bring himself to answer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he got home, he led her into the house and stopped in the hall to\ncall Chief Franklin. The operator said, \"His office doesn't answer,\nsir. Shall I give you the robot locator?\"\n\nNorris hesitated. His wife came into the hall. She stooped to grin at\nPeony, and Peony said, \"Do you live here, too?\" Anne gasped and sat on\nthe floor to stare.\n\nNorris said, \"Cancel the call. It'll wait till tomorrow.\" He dropped\nthe phone quickly.\n\n\"What series is it?\" Anne asked excitedly. \"I never saw one that could\ntalk.\"\n\n\"_It_ is a _she_,\" he said. \"And she's a series unto herself. Some of\nDelmont's work.\"\n\nPeony was looking from one to the other of them with a baffled face.\n\"Can we go back now?\"\n\nNorris shook his head. \"You're going to spend the night with us,\nPeony,\" he said softly. \"Your daddy wants you to.\"\n\nHis wife was watching him thoughtfully. Norris looked aside and plucked\nnervously at a corner of the telephone book. Suddenly she caught\nPeony's hand and led her toward the kitchen.\n\n\"Come on, baby, let's go find a cookie or something.\"\n\nNorris started out the front door, but in a moment Anne was back. She\ncaught at his collar and tugged. \"Not so fast!\"\n\nHe turned to frown. Her face accused him at a six-inch range.\n\n\"Just what do you think you're going to do with that child?\"\n\nHe was silent for a long time. \"You know what I'm _supposed_ to do.\"\n\nHer unchanging stare told him that she wouldn't accept any evasions. \"I\nheard you trying to get your boss on the phone.\"\n\n\"I canceled it, didn't I?\"\n\n\"Until tomorrow.\"\n\nHe worked his hands nervously. \"I don't know, honey--I just don't know.\"\n\n\"They'd kill her at central lab, wouldn't they?\"\n\n\"Well, they'd need her as evidence in Delmont's trial.\"\n\n\"They'd kill her, wouldn't they?\"\n\n\"When it was over--it's hard to say. The law says deviants must be\ndestroyed, but--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nHe paused miserably. \"We've got a few days to think about it, honey. I\ndon't have to make my report for a week.\"\n\nHe sidled out the door. Looking back, he saw the hard determination in\nher eyes as she watched him. He knew somehow that he was going to lose\neither his job or his wife. Maybe both. He shuffled moodily out to the\nkennels to care for his charges.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA great silence filled the house during the evening. Supper was a\ngloomy meal. Only Peony spoke; she sat propped on two cushions at the\ntable, using her silver with remarkable skill.\n\nNorris wondered about her intelligence. Her chronological age was ten\nmonths; her physical age was about two years; but her mental age seemed\nto compare favorably with at least a three year old.\n\nOnce he reached across the table to touch her forehead. She eyed\nhim curiously for a moment and continued eating. Her temperature was\nwarmer than human, but not too warm for the normally high neutroid\nmetabolism--somewhere around 101\u00b0. The rapid rate of maturation made\nI.Q. determination impossible.\n\n\"You've got a good appetite, Peony,\" Anne remarked.\n\n\"I like Daddy's cooking better,\" she said with innocent bluntness.\n\"When can I go home?\"\n\nAnne looked at Norris and waited for an answer. He managed a smile at\nthe flame-haired cherub. \"Tell you what we'll do. I'll call your daddy\non the phone and let you say hello. Would you like that?\"\n\nShe giggled, then nodded. \"Uh-huh! When can we do it?\"\n\n\"Later.\"\n\nAnne tapped her fork thoughtfully against the edge of her plate. \"I\nthink we better have a nice long talk tonight, Terry,\" she said.\n\n\"Is there anything to talk about?\" He pushed the plate away. \"I'm not\nhungry.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe left the table and went to sit in darkness by the parlor window,\nwhile his wife did the dishes and Peony played with a handful of\nwalnuts on the kitchen floor.\n\nHe watched the scattered lights of the suburbs and tried to think of\nnothing. The lights were peaceful, glimmering through the trees.\n\nOnce there had been no lights, only the flickering campfires of hunters\nshivering in the forest, when the world was young and sparsely planted\nwith the seed of Man. Now the world was infected with his lights, and\nwith the sound of his engines and the roar of his rockets. He had\ninherited the Earth and had filled it--too full.\n\nThere was no escape. His rockets had touched two of the planets, but\neven the new worlds offered no sanctuary for the unborn. Man could have\nbabies--if allowed--faster than he could build ships to haul them away.\nHe could only choose between a higher death rate and a lower birth rate.\n\nAnd unborn children were not eligible to vote when Man made his choice.\n\nHis choice had robbed his wife of a biological need, and so he made a\ndisposable baby with which to pacify her. He gave it a tail and only\nhalf a mind, so that it could not be confused with his own occasional\nchildren.\n\nBut Peony had only the tail. Still she was not born of the seed of Man.\nStrange seed, out of the jungle, warped toward the human pole, but\nstill not human.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorris heard a car approaching in the street. Its headlights swung\nalong the curb, and it slowed to a halt in front of the house. A tall,\nslender man in a dark suit climbed out and stood for a moment, staring\ntoward the house. He was only a shadow in the faint street light.\nNorris could not place him. Suddenly the man snapped on a flashlight\nand played it over the porch. Norris caught his breath and darted\ntoward the kitchen. Anne stared at him questioningly, while Peony\npeered up from her play.\n\nHe stooped beside her. \"Listen, child!\" he said quickly. \"Do you know\nwhat a neutroid is?\"\n\nShe nodded slowly. \"They play in cages. They don't talk.\"\n\n\"Can you pretend you're a neutroid?\"\n\n\"I can play neutroid. I play neutroid with Daddy sometimes, when people\ncome to see him. He gives me candy when I play it. When can I go home?\"\n\n\"Not now. There's a man coming to see us. Can you play neutroid for me?\nWe'll give you lots of candy. Just don't talk. Pretend you're asleep.\"\n\n\"Now?\"\n\n\"Now.\" He heard the door chimes ringing.\n\n\"Who is it?\" Anne asked.\n\n\"I don't know. He may have the wrong house. Take Peony in the bedroom.\nI'll answer it.\"\n\nHis wife caught the child-thing up in her arms and hurried away. The\nchimes sounded again. Norris stalked down the hall and switched on the\nporch-light. The visitor was an elderly man, erect in his black suit\nand radiating dignity. As he smiled and nodded, Norris noticed his\ncollar. A clergyman. Must have the wrong place, Norris thought.\n\n\"Are you Inspector Norris?\"\n\nThe agent nodded, not daring to talk.\n\n\"I'm Father Paulson. I'm calling on behalf of a James O'Reilley. I\nthink you know him. May I come in?\"\n\nGrudgingly, Norris swung open the door. \"If you can stand the smell of\npaganism, come on in.\"\n\nThe priest chuckled politely. Norris led him to the parlor and turned\non the light. He waved toward a chair.\n\n\"What's this all about? Does O'Reilley want something?\"\n\nPaulson smiled at the inspector's brusque tone and settled himself in\nthe chair. \"O'Reilley is a sick man,\" he said.\n\nThe inspector frowned. \"He didn't look it to me.\"\n\n\"Sick of heart, Inspector. He came to me for advice. I couldn't give\nhim any. He told me the story--about this Peony. I came to have a look\nat her, if I may.\"\n\nNorris said nothing for a moment. O'Reilley had better keep his mouth\nshut, he thought, especially around clergymen. Most of them took a dim\nview of the whole mutant business.\n\n\"I didn't think you'd associate with O'Reilley,\" he said. \"I thought\nyou people excommunicated everybody that owns a neutroid. O'Reilley\nowns a whole shopful.\"\n\n\"That's true. But who knows? He might get rid of his shop. May I see\nthis neutroid?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"O'Reilley said it could talk. Is that true or is O'Reilley suffering\ndelusions? That's what I came to find out.\"\n\n\"Neutroids don't talk.\"\n\nThe priest stared at him for a time, then nodded slowly, as if\napproving something. \"You can rest assured,\" he said quietly, \"that\nI'll say nothing of this visit, that I'll speak to no one about this\ncreature.\"\n\nNorris looked up to see his wife watching them from the doorway.\n\n\"Get Peony,\" he said.\n\n\"It's true then?\" Paulson asked.\n\n\"I'll let you see for yourself.\"\n\nAnne brought the small child-thing into the room and set her on the\nfloor. Peony saw the visitor, chattered with fright, and bounded upon\nthe back of the sofa to sit and scold. She was playing her game well,\nNorris thought.\n\nThe priest watched her with quiet interest. \"Hello, little one.\"\n\nPeony babbled gibberish. Paulson kept his eyes on her every movement.\nSuddenly he said, \"I just saw your daddy, Peony. He wanted me to talk\nto you.\"\n\nHer babbling ceased. The spell of the game was ended. Her eyes went\nsober. Then she looked at Norris and pouted. \"I don't want any candy. I\nwanna go home.\"\n\nNorris let out a deep breath. \"I didn't say she couldn't talk,\" he\npointed out sullenly.\n\n\"I didn't say you did,\" said Paulson. \"You invited me to see for\nmyself.\"\n\nAnne confronted the clergyman. \"What do you want?\" she demanded. \"The\nchild's death? Did you come to assure yourself that she'd be turned\nover to the lab? I know your kind! You'd do anything to get rid of\nneutroids!\"\n\n\"I came only to assure myself that O'Reilley's sane,\" Paulson told her.\n\n\"I don't believe you,\" she snapped.\n\nHe stared at her in wounded surprise; then he chuckled. \"People used\nto trust the cloth. Ah, well. Listen, my child, you have us wrong. We\nsay it's evil to create the creatures. We say _also_ that it's evil\nto destroy them after they're made. Not murder, exactly, but--mockery\nof life, perhaps. It's the entire institution that's evil. Do you\nunderstand? As for this small creature of O'Reilley's--well, I hardly\nknow what to make of her, but I certainly wouldn't wish\nher--uh--d-e-a-d.\"\n\nPeony was listening solemnly to the conversation. Somehow Norris sensed\na disinterested friend, if not an ally, in the priest. He looked at his\nwife. Her eyes were still suspicious.\n\n\"Tell me, Father,\" Norris asked, \"if you were in my position, what\nwould you do?\"\n\nPaulson fumbled with a button of his coat and stared at the floor while\nhe pondered. \"I wouldn't be in your position, young man. But if I were,\nI think I'd withhold her from my superiors. I'd also quit my job and go\naway.\"\n\nIt wasn't what Norris wanted to hear. But his wife's expression\nsuddenly changed; she looked at the priest with a new interest. \"And\ngive Peony back to O'Reilley,\" she added.\n\n\"I shouldn't be giving you advice,\" he said unhappily. \"I'm duty-bound\nto ask O'Reilley to give up his business and have nothing further to do\nwith neutroids.\"\n\n\"But Peony's _human_,\" Anne argued. \"She's _different_.\"\n\n\"I fail to agree.\"\n\n\"What!\" Anne confronted him again. \"What makes _you_ human?\"\n\n\"A soul, my child.\"\n\nAnne put her hands on her hips and leaned forward to glare down at him\nlike something unwholesome. \"Can you put a voltmeter between your ears\nand measure it?\"\n\nThe priest looked helplessly at Norris.\n\n\"_No!_\" she said. \"And you can't do it to Peony either!\"\n\n\"Perhaps I had better go,\" Paulson said to his host.\n\nNorris sighed. \"Maybe you better, Padre. You found out what you wanted\nto know.\"\n\nAnne stalked angrily out of the room, her dark hair swishing like a\nbattle-pennant with each step. When the priest was gone, Norris picked\nup the child and held her in his lap. She was shivering with fright,\nas if she understood what had been said. Love them in the parlor, he\nthought, and kill them in the kennels.\n\n\"Can I go home? Doesn't Daddy want me any more?\"\n\n\"Sure he does, baby. You just be good and everything'll be all right.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorris felt a bad taste in his mouth as he laid her sleeping body on\nthe sofa half an hour later. Everything was all wrong and it promised\nto remain that way. He couldn't give her back to O'Reilley, because she\nwould be caught again when the auditor came to microfilm the records.\nAnd he certainly couldn't keep her himself--not with other Bio-agents\nwandering in and out every few days. She could not be concealed in a\nworld where there were no longer any sparsely populated regions. There\nwas nothing to do but obey the law and turn her over to Franklin's lab.\n\nHe closed his eyes and shuddered. If he did that, he could do\nanything--stomach anything--adapt to any vicious demands society made\nof him. If he sent the child away to die, he would know that he had\nattained an \"objective\" outlook. And what more could he want from life\nthan adaptation and objectivity?\n\nWell--his wife, for one thing.\n\nHe left the child on the sofa, turned out the light, and wandered into\nthe bedroom. Anne was in bed, reading. She did not look up when she\nsaid, \"Terry, if you let that baby be destroyed, I'll....\"\n\n\"Don't say it,\" he cut in. \"Any time you feel like leaving, you just\nleave. But don't threaten me with it.\"\n\nShe watched him silently for a moment. Then she handed him the\nnewspaper she had been reading. It was folded around an advertisement.\n\n                           BIOLOGISTS WANTED\n                                  by\n                        ANTHROPOS INCORPORATED\n                                  for\n                         Evolvotron Operators\n                           Incubator Tenders\n                          Nursery Supervisors\n                         Laboratory Personnel\n                                 _in_\n                           NEW ATLANTA PLANT\n                    _Call or write: Personnel Mgr._\n                            ANTHROPOS INC.\n                            _Atlanta, Ga._\n                     _Note: Secure Work Department\n                       release from present job\n                           before applying._\n\nHe looked at Anne curiously. \"So?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"So there's a job, if you want to quit this one.\"\n\n\"What's this got to do with Peony, if anything?\"\n\n\"We could take her with us.\"\n\n\"Not a chance,\" he said. \"Do you suppose a talking neutroid would be\nany safer there?\"\n\nShe demanded angrily, \"Why should they want to destroy her?\"\n\nNorris sat on the edge of the bed and thought about it. \"No particular\n_individual_ wants to, honey. It's the law.\"\n\n\"But _why_?\"\n\n\"Generally, because deviants are unknown quantities. They can be\ndangerous.\"\n\n\"That child--_dangerous_?\"\n\n\"Dangerous to a concept, a vague belief that Man is something special,\na closed tribe. And in a practical sense, she's dangerous because she's\nnot a neuter. The Federation insists that all mutants be neuter and\ninfertile, so it can control the mutant population. If mutants started\nreproducing, that could be a real threat in a world whose economy is so\ndelicately balanced.\"\n\n\"Well, you're not going to let them have her, do you hear me?\"\n\n\"I hear you,\" he grumbled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the following day, he went down to police headquarters to sign a\nstatement concerning the motive in Doctor Georges' murder. As a result,\nMrs. Glubbes was put away in the psycho-ward.\n\n\"It's funny, Norris,\" said Chief Miler, \"what people'll do over a\nneutroid. Like Mrs. Glubbes thinking that newt was her own. I sure\ndon't envy you your job. It's a wonder you don't get your head blown\noff. You must have an iron stomach.\"\n\nNorris signed the paper and looked up briefly. \"Sure, Chief. Just a\nmatter of adaptation.\"\n\n\"Guess so.\" Miler patted his paunch and yawned. \"How you coming on this\nDelmont business? Picked up any deviants yet?\"\n\nNorris laid down the pen abruptly. \"No! Of course not! What made you\nthink I had?\"\n\nMiler stopped in the middle of his yawn and stared at Norris curiously.\n\"Touchy, aren't you?\" he asked thoughtfully. \"When I get that kind of\nanswer from a prisoner, I right away start thinking--\"\n\n\"Save it for your interrogation room,\" Norris growled. He stalked\nquickly out of the office while Chief Miler tapped his pencil absently\nand stared after him.\n\nHe was angry with himself for his indecision. He had to make a choice\nand make it soon. He was climbing in his car when a voice called after\nhim from the building. He looked back to see Chief Miler trotting down\nthe steps, his pudgy face glistening in the morning sun.\n\n\"Hey, Norris! Your missus is on the phone. Says it's urgent.\"\n\nNorris went back grudgingly. A premonition of trouble gripped him.\n\n\"Phone's right there,\" the chief said, pointing with a stubby thumb.\n\nThe receiver lay on the desk, and he could hear it saying,\n\"Hello--hello--\" before he picked it up.\n\n\"Anne? What's the matter?\"\n\nHer voice was low and strained, trying to be cheerful. \"Nothing's the\nmatter, darling. We have a visitor. Come right home, will you? Chief\nFranklin's here.\"\n\nIt knocked the breath out of him. He felt himself going white. He\nglanced at Chief Miler, calmly sitting nearby.\n\n\"Can you tell me about it now?\" he asked her.\n\n\"Not very well. Please hurry home. He wants to talk to you about the\nK-99s.\"\n\n\"Have the two of them met?\"\n\n\"Yes, they have.\" She paused, as if listening to him speak, then said,\n\"Oh, _that_! The game, honey--remember the _game_?\"\n\n\"Good,\" he grunted. \"I'll be right there.\" He hung up and started out.\n\n\"Troubles?\" the chief called after him.\n\n\"Just a sick newt,\" he said, \"if it's any of your business.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChief Franklin's helicopter was parked in the empty lot next door when\nNorris drove up in front of the house. The official heard the truck\nand came out on the porch to watch his agent walk up the path. His\nlanky, emaciated body was loosely draped in gray tweeds, and his thin\nhawk face was a dark and solemn mask. He was a middle-aged man, his\nskin seamed with wrinkles, but his hair was still abnormally black. He\ngreeted Norris with a slow, almost sarcastic nod.\n\n\"I see you don't read your mail. If you'd looked at it, you'd have\nknown I was coming. I wrote you yesterday.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Chief, I didn't have a chance to stop by the message office\nthis morning.\"\n\nFranklin grunted. \"Then you don't know why I'm here?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Let's sit out on the porch,\" Franklin said, and perched his bony\nframe on the railing. \"We've got to get busy on these Bermuda-K-99s,\nNorris. How many have you got?\"\n\n\"Thirty-four, I think.\"\n\n\"I counted thirty-five.\"\n\n\"Maybe you're right. I--I'm not sure.\"\n\n\"Found any deviants yet?\"\n\n\"Uh--I haven't run any tests yet, sir.\"\n\nFranklin's voice went sharp. \"Do you need a test to know when a\nneutroid is talking a blue streak?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Just this. We've found at least a dozen of Delmont's units that have\nmental ages that correspond to their physical age. What's more, they're\nfunctioning females, and they have normal pituitaries. Know what that\nmeans?\"\n\n\"They won't take an age-set then,\" Norris said. \"They'll grow to\nadulthood.\"\n\n\"And have children.\"\n\nNorris frowned. \"How can they have children? There aren't any males.\"\n\n\"No? Guess what we found in one of Delmont's incubators.\"\n\n\"Not a--\"\n\n\"Yeah. And it's probably not the first. This business about padding\nhis quota is baloney! Hell, man, he was going to start his own black\nmarket! He finally admitted it, after twenty-hours' questioning without\na letup. He was going to raise them, Norris. He was stealing them\nright out of the incubators before an inspector ever saw them. The\nK-99s--the numbered ones--are just the ones he couldn't get back. Lord\nknows how many males he's got hidden away someplace!\"\n\n\"What're you going to do?\"\n\n\"_Do!_ What do you _think_ we'll do? Smash the whole scheme, that's\nwhat! Find the deviants and kill them. We've got enough now for lab\nwork.\"\n\nNorris felt sick. He looked away. \"I suppose you'll want me to handle\nthe destruction, then.\"\n\nFranklin gave him a suspicious glance. \"Yes, but why do you ask? You\n_have_ found one, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he admitted.\n\nA moan came from the doorway. Norris looked up to see his wife's white\nface staring at him in horror, just before she turned and fled into the\nhouse. Franklin's bony head lifted.\n\n\"I see,\" he said. \"We have a fixation on our deviant. Very well,\nNorris, I'll take care of it myself. Where is it?\"\n\n\"In the house, sir. My wife's bedroom.\"\n\n\"Get it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorris went glumly in the house. The bedroom door was locked.\n\n\"Honey,\" he called softly. There was no answer. He knocked gently.\n\nA key turned in the lock, and his wife stood facing him. Her eyes were\nweeping ice.\n\n\"Stay back!\" she said. He could see Peony behind her, sitting in the\ncenter of the floor and looking mystified.\n\nThen he saw his own service revolver in her trembling hand.\n\n\"Look, honey--it's _me_.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"No, it's not you. It's a man that wants to kill a\nlittle girl. Stay back.\"\n\n\"You'd shoot, wouldn't you?\" he asked softly.\n\n\"Try to come in and find out,\" she invited.\n\n\"Let me have Peony.\"\n\nShe laughed, her eyes bright with hate. \"I wonder where Terry went. I\nguess he died. Or adapted. I guess I'm a widow now. Stay back, Mister,\nor I'll kill you.\"\n\nNorris smiled. \"Okay, I'll stay back. But the gun isn't loaded.\"\n\nShe tried to slam the door; he caught it with his foot. She struck at\nhim with the pistol, but he dragged it out of her hand. He pushed her\naside and held her against the wall while she clawed at his arm.\n\n\"Stop it!\" he said. \"Nothing will happen to Peony, I promise you!\" He\nglanced back at the child-thing, who had begun to cry.\n\nAnne subsided a little, staring at him angrily.\n\n\"There's no other way out, honey. Just trust me. She'll be all right.\"\n\nBreathing quickly, Anne stood aside and watched him. \"Okay, Terry.\nBut if you're lying--tell me, is it murder to kill a man to protect a\nchild?\"\n\nNorris lifted Peony in his arms. Her wailing ceased, but her tail\nswitched nervously.\n\n\"In whose law book?\" he asked his wife. \"I was wondering the same\nthing.\" Norris started toward the door. \"By the way--find my\ninstruments while I'm outside, will you?\"\n\n\"The dissecting instruments?\" she gasped. \"If you intend--\"\n\n\"Let's call them surgical instruments, shall we? And get them\nsterilized.\"\n\nHe went on outside, carrying the child. Franklin was waiting for him in\nthe kennel doorway.\n\n\"Was that Mrs. Norris I heard screaming?\"\n\nNorris nodded. \"Let's get this over with. I don't stomach it so well.\"\nHe let his eyes rest unhappily on the top of Peony's head.\n\nFranklin grinned at her and took a bit of candy out of his pocket. She\nrefused it and snuggled closer to Norris.\n\n\"When can I go home?\" she piped. \"I want Daddy.\"\n\nFranklin straightened, watching her with amusement. \"You're going home\nin a few minutes, little newt. Just a few minutes.\"\n\nThey went into the kennels together, and Franklin headed straight for\nthe third room. He seemed to be enjoying the situation. Norris hating\nhim silently, stopped at a workbench and pulled on a pair of gloves.\nThen he called after Franklin.\n\n\"Chief, since you're in there, check the outlet pressure while I turn\non the main line, will you?\"\n\nFranklin nodded assent. He stood outside the gas-chamber, watching\nthe dials on the door. Norris could see his back while he twisted the\nmain-line valve.\n\n\"Pressure's up!\" Franklin called.\n\n\"Okay. Leave the hatch ajar so it won't lock, and crack the intake\nvalves. Read it again.\"\n\n\"Got a mask for me?\"\n\nNorris laughed. \"If you're scared, there's one on the shelf. But just\nopen the hatch, take a reading, and close it. There's no danger.\"\n\nFranklin frowned at him and cracked the intakes. Norris quietly closed\nthe main valve again.\n\n\"Drops to zero!\" Franklin called.\n\n\"Leave it open, then. Smell anything?\"\n\n\"No. I'm turning it off, Norris.\" He twisted the intakes.\n\nSimultaneously, Norris opened the main line.\n\n\"Pressure's up again!\"\n\nNorris dropped his wrench and walked back to the chamber, leaving Peony\nperched on the workbench.\n\n\"Trouble with the intakes,\" he said gruffly. \"It's happened before.\nMind getting your hands dirty with me, Chief?\"\n\nFranklin frowned irritably. \"Let's hurry this up, Norris. I've got five\nterritories to visit.\"\n\n\"Okay, but we'd better put on our masks.\" He climbed a metal ladder to\nthe top of the chamber, leaned over to inspect the intakes. On his way\ndown, he shouldered a light-bulb over the door, shattering it. Franklin\ncursed and stepped back, brushing glass fragments from his head and\nshoulders.\n\n\"Good thing the light was off,\" he snapped.\n\nNorris handed him the gas-mask and put on his own. \"The main switch\nis off,\" he said. He opened the intakes again. This time the dials\nfell to normal open-line pressure. \"Well, look--it's okay,\" he called\nthrough the mask. \"You sure it was zero before?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm sure!\" came the muffled reply.\n\n\"Leave it on for a minute. We'll see. I'll go get the newt. Don't let\nthe door close, sir. It'll start the automatics and we can't get it\nopen for half an hour.\"\n\n\"I know, Norris. Hurry up.\"\n\nNorris left him standing just outside the chamber, propping the door\nopen with his foot. A faint wind was coming through the opening. It\nshould reach an explosive mixture quickly with the hatch ajar.\n\nHe stepped into the next room, waited a moment, and jerked the switch.\nThe roar was deafening as the exposed tungsten filament flared and\ndetonated the escaping anesthetic vapor. Norris went to cut off the\nmain line. Peony was crying plaintively. He moved to the door and\nglanced at the smouldering remains of Franklin.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFeeling no emotion whatever, Norris left the kennels, carrying\nthe sobbing child under one arm. His wife stared at him without\nunderstanding.\n\n\"Here, hold Peony while I call the police,\" he said.\n\n\"_Police?_ What's happened?\"\n\nHe dialed quickly. \"Chief Miler? This is Norris. Get over here quick.\nMy gas chamber exploded--killed Chief Agent Franklin. Man, it's awful!\nHurry.\"\n\nHe hung up and went back to the kennels. He selected a normal\nBermuda-K-99 and coldly killed it with a wrench. \"You'll serve for a\ndeviant,\" he said, and left it lying in the middle of the floor.\n\nThen he went back to the house, mixed a sleeping capsule in a glass of\nwater, and forced Peony to drink it.\n\n\"So she'll be out when the cops come,\" he explained to Anne.\n\nShe stamped her foot. \"Will you tell me what's happened?\"\n\n\"You heard me on the phone. Franklin accidentally died. That's all you\nhave to know.\"\n\nHe carried Peony out and locked her in a cage. She was too sleepy to\nprotest, and she was dozing when the police came.\n\nChief Miler strode about the three rooms like a man looking for a\nburglar at midnight. He nudged the body of the neutroid with his foot.\n\"What's this, Norris?\"\n\n\"The deviant we were about to destroy. I finished her with a wrench.\"\n\n\"I thought you said there weren't any deviants.\"\n\n\"As far as the public's concerned, there aren't. I couldn't see that it\nwas any of your business. It still isn't.\"\n\n\"I see. It may become my business, though. How'd the blast happen?\"\n\nNorris told him the story up to the point of the detonation. \"The light\nover the door was loose. Kept flickering on and off. Franklin reached\nup to tighten it. Must have been a little gas in the socket. Soon as he\ntouched it--wham!\"\n\n\"Why was the door open with the gas on?\"\n\n\"I told you--we were checking the intakes. If you close the door, it\nstarts the automatics. Then you can't get it open till the cycle's\nfinished.\"\n\n\"Where were you?\"\n\n\"I'd gone to cut off the gas again.\"\n\n\"Okay, stay in the house until we're finished out here.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Norris went back in the house, his wife's white face turned slowly\ntoward him.\n\nShe sat stiffly by the living room window, looking sick. Her voice was\nquietly frightened.\n\n\"Terry, I'm sorry about everything.\"\n\n\"Skip it.\"\n\n\"What did you do?\"\n\nHe grinned sourly. \"I adapted to an era. Did you find the instruments?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"What are they for?\"\n\n\"To cut off a tail and skin a tattooed foot. Go to the store and buy\nsome brown hair-dye and a pair of boy's trousers, age two. Peony's\ngoing to get a crew-cut. From now on, she's Mike.\"\n\n\"We're class-C, Terry! We can't pass her off as our own.\"\n\n\"We're class-A, honey. I'm going to forge a heredity certificate.\"\n\nAnne put her face in her hands and rocked slowly to and fro.\n\n\"Don't feel bad, baby. It was Franklin or a little girl. And from now\non, it's society or the Norrises.\"\n\n\"What'll we do?\"\n\n\"Go to Atlanta and work for Anthropos. I'll take up where Delmont left\noff.\"\n\n\"_Terry!_\"\n\n\"Peony will need a husband. They may find all of Delmont's males. I'll\n_make_ her one. Then we'll see if a pair of chimp-Ks can do better than\ntheir makers.\"\n\nWearily, he stretched out on the sofa.\n\n\"What about that priest? Suppose he tells about Peony. Suppose he\nguesses about Franklin and tells the police?\"\n\n\"The police,\" he said, \"would then smell a motive. They'd figure it out\nand I'd be finished. We'll wait and see. Let's don't talk; I'm tired.\nWe'll just wait for Miler to come in.\"\n\nShe began rubbing his temples gently, and he smiled.\n\n\"So we wait,\" she said. \"Shall I read to you, Terry?\"\n\n\"That would be pleasant,\" he murmured, closing his eyes.\n\nShe slipped away, but returned quickly. He heard the rustle of dry\npages and smelled musty leather. Then her voice came, speaking old\nwords softly. And he thought of the small child-thing lying peacefully\nin her cage while angry men stalked about her. A small life with a\nmind; she came into the world as quietly as a thief, a burglar in the\ncrowded house of Man.\n\n\"_I will send my fear before thee, and I will destroy the peoples\nbefore whom thou shalt come, sending hornets to drive out the Hevite\nand the Canaanite and the Hethite before thou enterest the land. Little\nby little I will drive them out before thee, till thou be increased,\nand dost possess the land. Then shalt thou be to me a new people, and I\nto thee a God...._\"\n\nAnd on the quiet afternoon in May, while he waited for the police to\nfinish puzzling in the kennels, it seemed to Terrell Norris that an end\nto scheming and pushing and arrogance was not too far ahead. It should\nbe a pretty good world then.\n\nHe hoped Man could fit into it somehow.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Conditionally Human, by Walter M.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
