He was an aircraft\nemergency survival equipment specialist\nin the Pacific Area during World War II and a\ntechnical writer for several years afterwards.\nDuring the Cold War he transferred to a USAF\nbase in North Africa where he developed logistics\nplans for USAF-NATO emergency maintenance\nof disabled aircraft that would land along the\nNorth African coast after returning from missions\nin any future war with the USSR. During the U.S.\npost-Sputnik initiatives to create a national space\nprogram, he critiqued aerospace industries' logistics\nconcepts on future space systems organization,\ninfrastructure and support. Among the studies\nhe critiqued was 'Space Logistics, Operations,\nMaintenance and Rescue' (Project SLOMAR).\nDuring the Viet Nam War, he was the senior\ncivilian in the Inspector General's Office at\nMcClellan Air Force Base, a major logistics\ninstallation near Sacramento, California. As\npart of his 'added' duties during 'Viet Nam' Mike\nwas a hotline volunteer in a suicide prevention\ncenter and consequently, an advocate for\nprofessionally-staffed 'suicide prevention'\ncapabilities throughout the entire Department\nof Defense. He compiled documentation,\npublished, and widely distributed copies of\nhis book, \"Military-Civilian Teamwork in\nSuicide Prevention\" (1971, 1985 and 1994.)\nMike's updated essay on suicide prevention\nin the U.S. Armed Forces has been included\nin his collection of memoirs, \"Hot War/Cold War\n-- Back-of-the-Lines Logistics\", which is at:\nhttp://hometown.aol.com/yarnspinner7191/\nmyhomepage/military.html\n\n\n\n\n\n Also by Meyer Moldeven\n\n\n                 Military-Civilian Teamwork in Suicide Prevention\n                 Write Stories to Me, Grandpa!\n                 A Grandpa's Notebook\n\n\n\n\n\n The Preface\n\n\n \"It is difficult to say\n what is impossible,\n for the dream of yesterday\n is the hope of today and\n the reality of tomorrow.\"\n -- Dr. Robert H. Goddard\n\n\n \"There is no way back into the past;\n the choice, as H. G. Wells once said,\n is the universe -- or nothing.\n Though men and civilizations\n may yearn for rest, for the\n dream of the lotus-eaters,\n that is a desire that merges\n imperceptibly into death.\n The challenge of the great\n spaces between the worlds\n is a stupendous one; but\n if we fail to meet it,\n the story of our race will\n be drawing to its close.\"\n -- Arthur C. Clarke\n\n\n\n\n\n The Prologue\n\n\n The Present\n\nA conclusion in the Report to the Club of Rome:\nThe Limits to Growth states: \"...within a time span\nof less than 100 years with no major change in\nthe physical, economic, or social relationships that\nhave traditionally governed world development,\nsociety will run out of the nonrenewable resources\non which the industrial base depends. When the\nresources have been depleted, a precipitous\ncollapse of the economic system will result,\nmanifested in massive unemployment, decreased\nfood production, and a decline in population as the\ndeath rate soars. There is no smooth transition,\nno gradual slowing down of activity; rather, the\neconomic system consumes successively larger\namounts of the depletable resources until they\nare gone. The characteristic behavior of the\nsystem is overshoot and collapse.\"\n\nJeremy Rifkin, President of the Foundation on\nEconomic Trends and the Greenhouse Crisis\nFoundation, in Biosphere Politics: A New\nConsciousness for a New Century (Crown Publishers,\nNew York 1991) reports how industrialized and\ndeveloped nations exploit the sea beds of the world\nfor their rich deposits of industrial minerals and\nmetals. He notes that the struggle between rich\nand poor nations and multinational corporations over\nminerals in the vast oceanic seabed is likely to be\nheated in the years to come, especially as reserves\nof land-based minerals approach exhaustion.\n\nNews media reported in October 2000 that the\nPeople's Republic of China announced plans to\nexplore Earth's moon for useful substances. On\nOctober 15, 2003 the PRC launched into Earth\norbit its first manned rocket.\n\nIn a speech on January 14, 2004 the President of\nthe United States of America unveiled a new vision\nfor space exploration. He called on the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to\n\"...gain a new foothold on the moon and to prepare\nfor new journeys to worlds beyond our own.\"\n\n\"We do not know where this journey will end,\" said\nthe President, \"yet we know this: Human beings are\nheaded into the cosmos.\" White House Press Release,\nJanuary 14, 2004.\n\n ##\n\n The Future\n\n The Interstellar Mining and Teleport System\n\nThe System consists of two terminals, each of\nwhich includes an integral, fully robotized capability\nto conduct internal command-and-control,\nself-maintenance and repair, and logistical,\nteleportation, communications and other functions\nand operations essential to its unique mission. The\nterminal positioned in orbit above Alpha Centauri is\ndesignated the Extractor and the terminal positioned\nalong the Solar System's rim is designated the\nCollector.\n\nThe Extractor selects and draws pre-designated\nelements, minerals and other usable substances\nfrom the Alpha Centauri star system, and collects,\naccumulates, converts and channels the matter\ninto its spunnel transmission subsystem for direct\ninterstellar transfer to the Collector.\n\nThe Collector receives the product, converts\nit into its original form, identifies, classifies,\nquantifies and records constituents and mass;\nrefines and ejects the raw product for transport\nto and storage along the solar rim or at a location\nthat Authority determines to be more suitable.\n\nThe Extractor and Collector terminals are\nconstructed four million kilometers beyond Planet\nPluto. During the System's research, development,\ntest, evaluation, engineering, construction, launch\nand voyage phases, the terminals are spunnel-linked\nand tested both as separate machines with their\nsupport systems, and as the integrated master\nscheme.\n\nDuring construction the System is linked to Planet\nPluto, employing mass attractors, orbital dynamics\ncontrols and stabilizers, and other means, as\nappropriate.\n\nThe System Authority possesses and Commands a\nSelf-Defense Force under Powers delegated by the\nPresident of the United Inner Planetary System\n(UIPS).\n\nAt launch, disengage the Extractor fleet from the\nSolar System's gravitational and other constraints\nemploying Planet Pluto's outbound orbital momentum\nplus augmentation thrusters in a manner that the\nExtractor fleet retains its integrity in transit to\ndestination, and on station in perpetuity.\n\nPosition the Extractor in orbit above Alpha\nCentauri at a location commensurate with data\nprovided previously by drone scouts. Authority,\nat all times, maintains surveillance and exercises\ncontrol over operations and support systems, and\nanalyses of the Extractor's functions, structures\nand equipment.\n\nThe Collector is positioned along the solar rim, or\nelsewhere, as determined by Authority. The Collector\nis fixed to the Extractor's product launch nodes,\nfunctions and operations, and to the Extractor's\norbital dynamics at destination.\n\nThe Extractor, operating at destination, analyzes,\nselects, and draws substance from proximate\nasteroids, comets, satellites, planetoids, space\ndebris, swarms, star surfaces, subsurface and other\naccessible bodies and strata, reduces the substance\nto teleportable constituents (the product), loads\nthe product into launch hoppers and dispatches\nit to the Collector.\n\nCritical to the program's success is timing the\nExtractor's launch. Piggy-backed to Planet Pluto\nduring construction, the Extractor uses the\nplanet's orbital momentum for launch. The launch\nwindow is precise and short-lived along Planet\nPluto's outbound orbit; there is only one launch\nopportunity in centuries for the Extractor.\n\nDisengaged from Pluto, the Extractor fleet\naccelerates along its course to optimum velocity\nthrough integrated thrust of augmented thrusters\nor other more advanced propulsion systems that\nare or become available in time to accomplish the\nObjective.\n\n ##\n\nThe Terminals and their command and control,\nsupporting research and development schemes\nand projects, facilities, spunnel teleport and other\nlogistics and communications networks, surface and\nspace stations and outposts is formally designated\nThe Interstellar Mining and Transport System.\nAuthority acknowledges that the mission, launch and\nassets acquisition processes intrigued the whimsical\nfancy of the solar community during pre-program\ndefinition studies and the System was nicknamed\n\"Slingshot\".\n\n\n\n\n\n THE UNIVERSE\n -- or nothing\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter ONE\n\n\nThe recon-patroller's leg and torso-pads fine-tuned\ntheir tensions as Lieutenant Pete O'Hare shifted\nposition. His eyes ranged the banks of flickering\nlights around him. An aberrant indicator caught his\neye and he mind-stroked a sensor control. Satisfied,\nhe moved on; the greens held firm.\n\nPlanet Pluto arced into view from starboard, half\na million kay distant. The mottled moonlet, Charon,\norbited the mother planet tightly. Only tanktown\nColdfield's dome and its hard unblinking lights\nbroke Pluto's drab crust. A dozen or so rutted\ntrails formed a network that connected encapsulated\noutposts to each other and to Pluto's solitary city.\n\nThe recon-patroller's omni-directional screen\ndisplayed the huge cylinder that floated in space\nbehind him, its gravity-enhanced rotation barely\nperceptible to O'Hare's vision. Five-meter high\norange letters glowed brightly along its blunt\nbow and stern, and on each quarter sector of its\nexposed surface, proclaiming the huge cylinder\nas the UIPS SLINGSHOT LOGISTICS DEPOT.\n\nSpace transports, no two alike, rode their\nmagnetic-beam's moorings along the Depot's flanks.\nSpace tugs and barges labored in all directions,\ntaxis charged about, and space-cranes swayed above\ndozens of platforms that protruded from the Depot's\nhull.\n\nLeviathans off-loaded to barges as other ships in a\nmultitude of shapes and sizes grappled with cargo\nfrom flex-conveyers that snaked from the Depot's\ngaping portals. Slender, multi-armed space cranes\nraised and lowered crates, bundles and modules, and\narranged, aligned, connected and disconnected gear\nand cargo in all directions.\n\nAggregations of netted or tethered girders,\nplatforms, multi-meter-wide conduits in hundreds\nof shapes and lengths, and modules linked by\nstabilizer-beams crossed open spaces, pulled or\npushed by robot tugs controlled from the station's\ncargo control centers. In trains or clusters,\nmachines traversed the open stretches between\nthe Depot's portals and nearby transports in their\nfinal step toward a long journey.\n\nThe brightly checkered Depot slipped from O'Hare's\nscreen. A deployment station to O'Hare and hundreds\nof his colleagues, and to more than four centuries\nof his predecessors, the Depot was as much home\nto him as his permanent station afloat in space\nbetween Earth and Luna.\n\n\"Time,\" O'Hare silently flashed the code that\nopened his spunnel channel to Keeper. \"This is a\nSlingshot Tac Ops from Red Fox to Keeper. I am hot\nto trot on Point Charlie off Fandango Force Field.\nAll coordinates green for Scout Operation Xray\nDelta slash Four. Time for go is 2112 slash 14\nSolar. Keyed to transmit status on Spunnel Channel\n9212, scramble 38. Confirm. Over.\"\n\nThe response was equally silent, registered\ndirectly in his consciousness. The message's\nclarity was unaffected by passage through\nhundreds of spunnel boosters that linked O'Hare\nto a shielded bunker beneath Luna's surface.\n\n\"Keeper to Red Fox. Your orders to scout Planet\nPluto Zone confirmed. You are cleared to start\nat 2112 slash 14 Solar. Spunnel 9212 slash 38 is\nopen for your transmissions. You are spunnel-psy\nmonitored by Spacetrack Ceres. Out.\"\n\nO'Hare tensed, psy-blinked his view screen down to\nthe instruments vital to his immediate mission, and\nmind-keyed several controls. The fifteen-meters-long\nvessel, with a barely two-meter beam, swooped\nlow and snapped into its run barely fifteen meters\nacross Pluto's desolate plains.\n\nThe view screen readouts showed subsurface\ngalleries, several outlined in irregular outlines\nbut empty, others reflected high-mass warship\nconfigurations. He focused to adjust his\ninstruments for deeper penetration.\n\nQuite suddenly, O'Hare's vision blurred. His head\nand body swelled. In an instant, his brains, bones\nand guts burst and splattered the cockpit as his\nship exploded.\n\n ##\n\nLieutenant Jake Ramirez smoothly accepted the\ntarget blip that registered on his mind-screen. It\ninstantly displayed the target's dimensions, mass,\nspin, velocity and coordinates. As the data strung\nout Jake whistled, soft and low. He tapped the\nchannel traffic override to the Depot's spunnel\nbooster.\n\n\"Spunnel Flash to Keeper. Switch to Scramble 2.\"\nJake flipped the key and, without pause, mind-cast\nhis alert.\n\n\"Blue Fox to Keeper on Scramble 2. Message keyed\nat 2115 slash 14 Solar. Request Spacetrack Ceres\nverify ship's position and readings. Field is about\none-fourth by three-fourths kay, depth one-fourth\nkay. No organics. Neutronic penetray analysis shows\nthat in addition to thermonuclear power plants\nthe aggregate includes machined parts configured\nto Catalog 11 long range lasers, explosive\ndecompressors, particle beamers and gun mounts.\nI suspect this is a cache of contraband ordnance\nand spares positioned for pickup by Planet Pluto\ninsurgents. Orders? Over.\"\n\n\"Keeper to Blue Fox. Spacetrack Ceres confirms\nunregistered objects proximate your position.\nCeres' sensors verify the findings. Space Force\nconcludes the stores present an immediate threat\nto Slingshot. Your orders: Destroy the cache\nimmediately using your Type K1 nuclear explosive\nmissile setting: Baker Two Seven. Launch at\nnot less than 15,000 kay. Remain on station and\nfollow up. Search out and dissolve all residues; use\nyour laser-doubles at setting 8. Report when task\ncompleted. Your Tac Ops and psych systems are\nmonitored. Start now. Out.\"\n\nKeeper's message simultaneously loaded into the\nrecon-patroller's computer as authenticator for the\nmission and demolition and laser gun settings. The\ncomputer adjusted thrust and vector to bring the\nship to the 'fire' point and engage the countdown\nand sequence to launch, arm the warhead, and follow\nup. Missile launch was at six seconds.\n\nWithout warning, the computer froze. The frame\nof the pilot's enclosure glowed red, then white. An\ninstant later the ship disintegrated into thousands\nof metal and composite fragments, and shards of\nwhat had been human flesh and bone.\n\n ##\n\n\"Flash -- Spunnel Transmission Priority One. To\nSupreme Commander, United Inner Planetary System\nSpace Force, Earth Headquarters, from Keeper,\nLuna Station. Attack report. Repeat: attack report.\nRecon-patrollers R-19557, Red Fox, and R-87265,\nBlue Fox in Planet Pluto Special Zone on recon\nmissions under Keeper control, were attacked and\ndestroyed by particle beams; attack times: Red Fox\n212014; Blue Fox 215514.\n\n\"Beamers fired from unidentified batteries, source\nSectus Gorge, coordinates GT165, Planet Pluto. The\nUIPS patrollers were on directed Tac Ops missions:\ncite our messages to Red Fox and Blue Fox\npast half-hour, info recorded in Tac Ops Actions\nRegister, your Headquarters. Regret to inform you\nthat no life signals emanate from Red Fox and Blue\nFox wreckage. Spacetrack Ceres will monitor for\nsurvivors. Ship recovery and investigation teams\ndispatched from Log Depot to both sites. Out.\"\n\n ##\n\n\"Flash To President, United Inner Planetary System\nfrom Supreme Commander, Space Force. This\nis my initial report of attacks on two of our\nrecon-patrollers while on UIPS-directed missions\nin the Planet Pluto Special Zone. No survivors. I\nconclude that Plutonian weapons destroyed both\nships. UIPS ships and support stations sunside\nof Neptune hold on Defense Alert Level Two.\nDefense Alert One remains in effect at Slingshot\nconstruction site and throughout Plutonian Special\nZone. Details follow.\"\n\n ##\n\n\"To President, UIPS from Commander, Space Force.\nCopy to each Senior Elder of the General Assembly,\nto Ministers of Intelligence and Diplomatic\nProtocols, and to Slingshot Director. This is\nfollow-on to my initial report of attacks on our\nrecon-patrollers in Planet Pluto Special Zone.\nRecon-patroller Red Fox was destroyed while on\nassigned mission to scout Special Zone to locate\nlaunch and support sites for spacecraft that\npresent a clear and present danger to Slingshot.\nThirty-five seconds later, sister ship Blue Fox, on\ndirected survey of the Planet Pluto Special Zone\nfor unregistered space debris and contraband was\nsimilarly attacked and destroyed.\n\n\"Transmissions from the patrollers Tac Ops systems,\nand scansplays of their external observations ceased\ninstantly at time of attack. Note that Spacetrack\nCeres' reports of the events, confirmed by\nKeeper, indicate conclusively that in the last few\nmilliseconds of functional stability before the\nships' defenses were breached their damage report\nsystems salvoed message bursts to spunnel boosters.\nThe signals confirm that each patroller had been the\ntarget of long-range particle beamers.\n\n\"The missions of the two patrollers have not been\ncompleted. Although the Red Fox scout mission can\nbe rescheduled, we must be prepared for an increase\nin such attacks throughout the Special Zone. Blue\nFox was four seconds from a missile launch to\ndestroy a cache of contraband, and was attacked\nbefore it could complete the task. Consequently,\nPlutonian insurgents have now added significantly\nto their already large stores of space weapons.\n\n\"Repeat alerts have been spunneled to Commanders\nof UIPS ships, posts and stations throughout the\nUIPS, and to all UIPS vessels that enter or are in the\nOuter Region; also to ships under way, and at space\nand surface moorings. Note that UIPS ships en route\nto Slingshot, the Log Depot, and work sites have\nbeen on Defense Alert Red since the Outer Region\nseceded from the old United Planetary System,\ntherefore Slingshot readiness in their sectors\nremains unchanged.\n\n\"This completes Commander Space Force Attack\nReport.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter TWO\n\n\nRymer Camari, President of the United Inner\nPlanetary System entered his official residence's\nconference room in a brisk walk, a loose, gray\nankle-length robe draped about his thin shoulders.\nHe nodded perfunctory greetings to his Ministers\nof Intelligence and Diplomatic Protocols, and to the\nCommander of the UIPS Space Forces as he took\nhis seat at the head of the long table. An abundant\nmane of white hair framed his aged features; his\nstony glare reflected the rage they shared.\n\nA panel in the wall slid upward to reveal a\ntwo-meter square well. A cylindrical view tank\nfilled its available space. The tank cleared to the\nUnited Inner Planetary System's standard simulation.\nColored and geometric symbols glowed the real\ntime positions of UIPS planets and their natural and\nartificial satellites and outposts, schema of space\ntraffic lanes, space spunnel booster stations,\nthe Asteroids, and the twenty Guardian Stations\nequidistant along the Asteroids' outer perimeter.\n\nStroking a key embedded nearby in the table the\nPresident brought the Strategic Concepts Computer\non line. \"Computer,\" he said, \"integrate these\nproceedings into the database. Follow, analyze\nin depth across-the-board and display.\"\n\nTurning to the Space Force Commander he said,\n\"What's the situation, Jim?\" His voice was flat\nwith the effort to control his anger.\n\nAdmiral Jim Selvin, shifted his stocky torso about\nto ease his discomfort. Battle-flinty eyes cast a\nquick baleful glance at his colleagues and turned\nto face the President. Thin lips, slashed across\nhis rough-hewn face, twisted as he spoke.\n\n\"There's little to add to what we had an hour\nago,\" he said. \"Two good pilots dead; two\nimpossible-to-replace patrollers destroyed.\"\n\nRubbing his chin vigorously, he grated, \"We\nconfirmed that the bandit beamer drew back into\nan underground tunnel that cuts into an ice gorge\nsouth of Coldfield. Their weapons' cache is even\nnow being approached by unidentified tugs. No doubt\nthat they're Narval's thugs and they're going to\nclamp a tow beam on the stores and haul them off to\nsome subsurface storage or assembly shop. Once the\nweapons are assembled, installed and calibrated we\ncould be on the receiving end of more nastiness.\"\n\nLeaning forward over the table, he looked directly\nat the President. His hand transformed into a fist,\nand he pounded the table in cadence with his words.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" he said, \"the real hell of it is\nwe can't stop them, and we've got no one to blame\nbut ourselves. It's downright unrealistic to keep\nour self-defense forces in the Special Zone so far\nbelow what's needed to protect our vital interests.\"\n\n\"What do you suggest, Jim,\" the President shrugged,\n\"break our treaties with the Outer Region? What'll\nthat get us?\"\n\nJim looked directly into the President's eyes.\n\"But they're the ones violating the treaties,\"\nhe growled. \"If we've ever needed irrefutable\nevidence, we've just had it rammed down our\nthroats. We'd better get off our duffs and do\nsomething.\"\n\nAllen Dynal, Minister for Intelligence, nodded in\nagreement, but did not speak. His turn was coming.\n\nSelvin leaned back, turned his head to scowl at the\nview tank. Together, they contemplated the forming\nscene.\n\nThe Admiral's outburst had given subject matter\nguidance to the computer. The display shifted to\nthe Planet Pluto Special Zone. Two tiny red lights\nflashed rapidly at the coordinates where the\nattacks had occurred. A steady blue light tracked\nthe hijacked stores.\n\nSelvin continued. \"The entire sector from which\nthis attack was launched is honeycombed with\nutility passages and subsurface supply and\nmaintenance shops,\" he said. \"They date back to\nwhen our earliest construction cadres went in.\nThe subsurface should have been returned to its\noriginal state when we had no further use for the\ntunnels and galleries. We did start to collapse the\nice walls and overheads; obviously, we didn't get\nvery far.\"\n\nSelvin sighed, heavily.\n\n\"Understandable,\" he went on. \"Hundreds of\njunctions and cutouts were dug to serve one-time\nneeds. They were never mapped. The same can be\nsaid for subsurface technical facilities. No question\nthat many are still usable.\"\n\nThe view tank's image blurred, then cleared to show\na broad expanse of Pluto's barren surface out to\nthe planet's horizon. A white, steady glow identified\nColdfield, the surrounding red and blue lines\nidentified scores of subsurface passageways and\nrutted trails that curved away from the domed city\nin all directions.\n\n\"There's no doubt that the underground passages\nand caverns are being used by Narval as maintenance\nand operations hangars for his fleet,\" Selvin said\nreturning his eyes to Camari. \"Many have enough\nroom to accommodate nuclear energy capsules, ship\nand equipment repair shops, and catapult launchers.\nPseudo-gravity enhancers during construction\nstabilized the floors. Foundations are secured deep\nin the frozen surfaces, and bonded well enough,\nso that even under the planet's low density, they'll\ntake the weight of battle wagons.\"\n\nThe silence hung heavily as Selvin glared at the\nview tank. His voice rasped. \"They must have\ninstalled heavy screens in the overheads. Many\nof our penetration readings are dim, even with\nour most advanced sensors.\"\n\n\"That's all I have for now, Mr. President,\" he\nsaid, leaning back. Absently, his stubby fingers\ndrummed the tabletop. He caught himself and\nglanced about guiltily as he drew his hands back\nto the edge of the table.\n\nCamari's eyes moved on to a somber-faced ancient\nwho gravely returned his stare. \"Let's hear the\nintelligence review, Allen,\" the President said.\n\nThe Minister for Intelligence placed his clasped\nhands before him on the table and spoke. His voice\nwas hoarse, low and intense, and his eyes moved\nfrom the President to Jim Selvin, who faced him\ngrimly.\n\nThe view tank flickered, clouded and cleared to an\noverview of the Outer Region. The scale reduced\nplanets, satellites, and stations to the colored\npinpoints of light with which they all were long\nfamiliar. The computer adjusted to focus on\na magnified Plutonian sector. The Uranus and\nNeptune orbits, although contained within the\ntank displays, were cut out by the compression.\nThe Slingshot Construction Site rode the rim.\n\n\"Updating, the latest reports of military\nconstruction, commitments and political\nrealignments among the Outer Nations are ominous,\"\nAllen said. \"They're pledging themselves to each\nother through mutual assistance pacts and are\nbuilding military spacecraft, weapons and support\nsystems to back up their agreements.\"\n\nPointing thoughtfully with his right forefinger at\nhis left palm, Allen updated the military assets of\neach opposing nation, and correlated its potential\ncapabilities to economic resources over the coming\ndecades and centuries until Slingshot reduced the\nsolar system's deficits. He wove into his analysis\nthe effects of orbital dynamics on normal and\nspunnel transit times from each Inner and Outer\nRegion point-of-origin to the Slingshot work sites.\nHe moved on to the status of weapons research\nand development, and identified the locations of\nthe Outer Region's weapons manufacturing sites\nand military training facilities.\n\n\"The long-term defense of Slingshot through purely\nmilitary means,\" he added, following a deep breath,\n\"especially in protecting our routes and the Log\nDepot, is, as Jim stated, not possible given the\nprevailing circumstances. The so-called members\nof the Independent Nations of the Outer Region are\nexpanding their field of operations, and they get\ngenerous support from satellite collectives and\nindividual sympathizers throughout the region.\n\n\"Our intelligence sources,\" Allen concluded,\n\"report that many supporters of Plutonian\nobjectives are, themselves, descendants of the\ninsurrectionists that fomented the dissolution\nof our first interplanetary union. Now, it seems,\ntheir intent is to destroy Slingshot, and us as\nwell.\"\n\nAllen Dynal and Jim Selvin glanced at each other;\nthey were not in disagreement.\n\nCamari broke the hush that followed Dynal's words.\n\n\"We are well into an armed confrontation,\" he said.\n\"Nevertheless, whatever actions we take must\nminimize destruction to life and property,\nrequire no diversions from resources allocated\nto Slingshot, and in no way restrict Slingshot's\nconstruction and launch schedules.\"\n\nTurning his head slightly, he nodded at the last\nof his three advisors. Chan Dahl, Minister of\nDiplomatic Protocols, laid his massive forearms on\nthe table, palms down. His abrasive voice matched\nhis heavy features and rotund body. He spoke\nrapidly in summary fashion: offering little that\nwas new, Chan passed quickly over the diplomatic\nchasm that had formed between the UIPS and\nthe Outer Region after the dissolution of the first\nUnited Planetary System. He summarized the complex\nalliances that had evolved among the independent\ngovernments beyond the Asteroids following the\nsecession, and moved on quickly to the initiatives\nof his Ministry to reconcile inter-regional\ndifferences.\n\n\"The issue of the transit fee is critical,\" he\nsaid. \"Each Outer Region nation has expressed\nvehement impatience to get on with its toll tax on\nthe UIPS for each transport or other vessel that\nenters space contiguous to their planetary and\nsatellite orbits. They insist that such space\nis legally within their natural boundaries, and\nthat by merely passing through, we trespass.\nRestitution, they claim, is in order.\n\n\"Negotiations remain in limbo. The impasse will,\nquite likely, remain for some time. Our position is\nunchanged: the fees that they demand are without\njustification, an extortion to which we cannot\nsubmit.\"\n\nThroughout the discussions, the Strategic Concepts\nComputer flashed a continuing display. As each\ntopic was opened for discussion the view tank\nportrayed the corresponding regions, sectors,\nplanets or satellites, shifting from one to the\nother as needed to clarify points under discussion\nor accompany the exploration for alternatives. The\nlower section of the tank registered the computer's\nquantification of speculations by the President's\nadvisors, and their probabilities toward\nrealization.\n\nFinally, President Camari raised his hand. He\npressed a softly glowing disk on the table. The\nview tank cleared. Resting his chin in the palm of\none hand, Camari gently rubbed his temple with\nthe fingertips of the other.\n\n\"Instructions to Strategic Concepts Computer,\" he\nbegan. \"Summarize the facts adverse to our cause\nand our options for dealing with each. Arrange and\nrate the options according to their probabilities\nfor results favorable to the UIPS, and separately,\nfavorable to the interests of the Outer Region's\nNations. Consider UIPS limitations in nonrenewable\nmetals, minerals and other vital reserves until\nSlingshot begins to produce. Take the options into\naccount and assume that Slingshot will succeed\non schedule and will generate sufficient refined\nmatter over time to meet the needs of both Regions.\n\n\"Project each option's draw down on resources\ncommitted to Slingshot, and estimate their impact\non schedules. We may need to gamble here. Crank\nin the latest estimates on the years it will take\nfor the Extractor to reach Alpha Centauri, get\norganized around the job, go online, and begin to\nproduce. Compute out to the time that we will\nhave rebuilt stockpiles within the Solar System.\"\n\nLeaning slowly back into his chair as he spoke,\nCamari lowered his hands into his lap. His eyes\nmoved from one advisor to the other. They returned\nhis gaze, the bleakness in their eyes matching his\nown. \"Try different combinations within the options\nand rate them,\" he continued. \"Examine our treaties\nwith the other powers and status of current\nnegotiations and pending proposals. Show how\neach option, which has statistical probability\nfor success up to exponent three can adversely\naffect those treaties or negotiations.\"\n\nCamari drew a deep breath. \"We need to take\na fresh look at where we are. We've also got to\navoid political irritations that may exacerbate the\nsituation further. On the other hand, revisions to\ntreaties and to our positions at the negotiating\ntables may be essential. Slingshot may solve our\ndisagreements, but we cannot wait.\n\n\"Review our readiness and activation sequences\nconsistent with our Quick Reaction Capability to\ndeal with contingencies in the Slingshot Special\nZone. Work up details on what needs to be done and\nby whom to upgrade our QRC initiatives for each\ncontingency that I keyed in as probable. Show\ncosts in still accessible resources separately and\nintegrate results with relevant commitments and\nschedules. Draft implementation plans and execution\ndirectives to commit resources. Update constantly,\nbut keep all implementation directives on 'hold'\nuntil I direct otherwise.\n\n\"We meet again in two hours,\" Camari, said, rising\nfrom his chair. \"Computer: be ready to give a\npresentation on each option and its variations\nwithin the parameters I specified and which surface\nthrough your analyses. Double-check resource\nrequirements and schedules, and tactical options\nand their possible effects on UIPS forces and\nassets in the Special Zone. Maintain current. When\nI select the course of action and authenticate them\nwith the Presidential Implementation Designators,\nrelease directives to implement the decisions.\nMonitor and report. This completes my instructions\nto Computer.\"\n\nThe President turned toward the door from which\nhe had entered. Pausing, he glanced back at the\nMinister of Intelligence.\n\n\"Allen,\" he said, \"give me a rundown, within the\nhour, on our intelligence assets throughout the\nOuter Region. I am especially interested in your\nability to intensify earliest possible infiltration\nand disruption throughout Narval's domain.\"\n\nThe door slid shut as he passed through. The\nwall panel across the view tank cavity lowered\nas the advisors departed.\n\nThe Strategic Concepts Computer presented\nvisual displays accompanied by a gently modulated\naudio. The analysis was incisive, the coverage\ncomprehensive. At its conclusion, the President\nscanned the faces of his Ministers and the\nCommander of the Space Forces.\n\n\"Comments?\"\n\nScores of questions probed and tested the\ncomputer's logic and conclusions. Questions became\nobservations, which, following discussion, became\nrevisions that, were instantly extended to\ncorollaries. Often, objectives and programs\nwere adjusted. Finally, it was done -- for the\ntime being.\n\nRising from his seat, the President's eyes took\nin his grim advisors. Speaking softly, he passed\ndecisions on several recommendations to his\nMinisters, Admiral Selvin, and into the Computer.\nDone, they sat silently for several moments,\nweighing the decisions' potential effects.\n\nRising and making his way toward the doorway,\nCamari motioned to the Minister of Intelligence.\n\"I've read your report on our assets in the Outer\nRegion, Allen. I have a special task for your\nMinistry.\"\n\nHe motioned the Minister for Intelligence to join\nhim. They passed through and the door closed\nsilently.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter THREE\n\n\nThe Watch Commander drew a hand weapon from the\nrack, adjusted the power to low stun, and checked\nthe safety. He slipped the sidearm into the sheath\nat his waist and scanned the monitors displaying\nhis areas of jurisdiction.\n\nThe agri-ecol bays and industrial shops of the\nGuardian Station were orderly and busy. The\nofficer's fingers ranged the console's keys.\nAud-viz transmissions from passageways, wardrooms,\nand work and recreation areas slipped across the\nscreens in rapid succession. Inmates and guards\nmoved about, operated equipment, or worked at\ntheir benches, each, in his or her own way, putting\nin their time on the station's business.\n\nA keystroke brought up the eight people boarding\nthe Station through the lower air lock. Two were\nstation guards, their weapons sheathed but\nretainer clips disengaged for instant withdrawal.\n\nA slight adjustment brought into sharp focus the\nclosed features of the three men and three women\nin dun-colored coveralls, under escort. He studied\ntheir faces for a moment and turned away. The\nbank of screens shut down as he stepped across\nthe doorway of the cubicle that served him as both\ncommand post and sleeping quarters. He strode\nbriskly toward a hatch at the far end of the\npassageway.\n\nThe lead guard, who had appeared a moment before\non the screen, stepped off the ladder leading\nfrom the lower level and glided forward in the light\npseudo-gravity followed by the six prisoners he\nhad escorted from the transport. The prisoners,\nwithout constraints, walked silently. All had their hair\ntrimmed uniformly close to their heads. The men's\nfaces were as hairless as the faces of the women.\n\nThe second guard brought up the rear.\n\nThe forward guard came abreast the Watch\nCommander, stopped, barked a command to halt,\nand turned to face his charges. They knotted\nforward, not anticipating the order, separated\nand spaced themselves.\n\n\"OK, inmates,\" the guard grinned, \"up against\nthe bulkhead, please. Relax. You're gonna get the\nofficial greeting to this paradise of the outback.\"\n\nSwinging about, he tossed a perfunctory salute\nin the officer's direction. At ease against\nthe opposite bulkhead, he watched benignly as\nhis charges shuffled about and lined up in no\nparticular order. The guard at the other end\nstood astride the passageway in a casual stance.\n\nThe Watch Commander cleared his throat with\na slight cough to focus their attention.\n\n\"I'm Lieutenant Malcolm,\" he said. \"I run the\nReception Center on this station. You may or\nmay not know where you are; let's be certain\nthat you do.\"\n\nThe six faces stared at him. One of the men in\nthe lineup, third from the head, shifted his gaze\nfrom the officer to the guards and back again.\nA bit above medium height, ropy necked and\nthick-shouldered he gave the impression of a male\nat ease, confident but wary. Below his gray-black\nbristle of close-cropped hair and space-bleached\nbrows his deep-set green eyes moved on to calmly\nscan the deck, bulkheads and corridor. He returned\neyes to the officer and the guards. He had the air\nof a leader.\n\nThe officer drew a deep breath and continued.\n\"The manifest of the transport from which you just\ndisembarked listed you as 'cargo' transferred to\nthis station from the temporary holding jails of\nEarth, Luna or Mars, or wherever you were being\nheld. Don't let being recorded as 'cargo' bother\nyou. Official visitors and guests are passengers,\nprisoners are cargo. If the transport's brigs were\ncramped, that's the name of the game; they're not\nbuilt for comfort. Each of you did get a separate\ncell on board, I understand. In that respect, at\nleast, you all got better than routine treatment.\"\n\nThe last remark raised sardonic eyebrows on two\nfaces in the line. The rest remained impassive.\n\nMalcolm paused, then continued.\n\n\"Be prepared to be here for a while. You know your\ncommitment period. Whatever happens to you here\ndepends on your attitude and your compliance with\norders, and on decisions by those conducting your\nrehabilitation.\"\n\nPacing the line he stopped before each prisoner\nand stared at him or her from under bushy black\neyebrows. Relaxed against the wall, or tense\nand erect, they returned his gaze. Inspection\ncompleted, he nodded at the guard astride the\npassageway and turned back to address the line.\n\n\"You are inmates in the Social Rehabilitation\nCenter of Guardian Station 15, about five million\nkay outbound from the Asteroid Belt's rim, or what\nwas the Belt before the space-miners got through\nwith it. This station was the mining operations\ncenter for this sector.\n\n\"Our internal security is good. We've had no\nattempts at breakout in a dozen years. In the\nattempt that was made before then, the inmate\ndidn't clear the sector. When it was over, I might\nadd, he was a bit the worse for the experience.\"\n\nMalcolm paused to let his words sink in.\n\n\"This prison,\" he continued, \"is where the rehab\nsystem confines its high-risk and special treatment\nprisoners. Inmates include persons convicted of\npiracy of spacecraft, smuggling controlled minerals\nand other substances, theft of government and\nimportant private properties, hijacking, espionage,\narmed robbery, gun-running to insurgents and\nterrorists in the Outer Region, and murder. That's\nthe short list.\"\n\nThe prisoner's faces remained expressionless.\n\n\"Bear in mind...\" the Lieutenant reached the end of\nthe line and reversed direction, \"that although the\nGuardian Stations are along the border between the\nInner and Outer Regions, we're far from isolated.\nFor example, this station's present orbital\ncoordinates accommodate Inner Region traffic to the\nPlanet Pluto Special Zone through both normal space\nand spunnel express.\n\n\"Escorted Inner Region convoys regularly pass\nthrough this sector on their way to the Slingshot\nconstruction site. They include high-mass-loaded\ncontainer ships, construction rigs under tow\nand objects too large for the spunnel are routed\nthrough this sector when we're lined up.\n\n\"Sometimes they stop to pick up and discharge\npassengers and cargo, or technicians to service our\nspecialized posts along the way and at destination.\nWe may have a half-dozen or so spacecraft alongside\nat any one time, just doing their jobs. When the\nmoored ships are perceived as crowded, inmates\ndream of stowing away to somewhere else. That's\nno more than a dream; don't underestimate our\nsurveillance systems. You've been warned.\"\n\nHe pointed at one prisoner, then another in a\njabbing gesture.\n\n\"Our job is custodianship of those who can't adjust\nto the realities of our society, and rehabilitation\nand training of those who can be helped,\neventually, to return to the outside world. There\nare other options for inmates who have special\nattributes. You will learn more of those in time.\"\n\nPausing, he scratched at his jaw.\n\n\"You are sojourners among us, and transient,\" he\nclosed. \"We will not abuse you; on the other hand,\nwe will not coddle you. We tell all new inmates, as\nI'm now telling you: cooperate, and you'll find your\nstay tolerable, resist, and take the consequences.\"\n\nA stern, hard stare, a shrug and his features\nrelaxed.\n\n\"OK, that's the official greeting for all\nnewcomers. I know you've all had a long, boring\ntrip on a beat-up transport. I expect you'll want\nto unwind a bit.\"\n\nHe glanced at the forward guard, back against\nthe bulkhead, and turned back to the prisoners.\n\n\"First, we'll get you into some decent quarters,\nand let you clean up and rest. Get to know each\nother; you'll be together for a long time.\n\n\"The guards will escort you to your core\ncompartment. Normally, you would have started\norientation and psy-phys testing immediately.\nYour schedule is different. Your first orientation\nlecture will be in two hours. Sergeant Jenkins,\" he\nmotioned the lead guard forward, \"will escort you to\nand from orientation. Don't play games with him; he\nknows them all.\"\n\n\"All yours, Jenks,\" he said. \"Move 'em out.\"\n\nJenkins came forward, pointed to a hatch further\nalong the passageway.\n\n\"Follow me.\"\n\nLieutenant Malcolm stepped aside. He watched the\nline move past silently and climb the companionway\nout of sight. None looked back.\n\nLining up in loose formation at the head of the\ncompanionway and responding to Jenkins signal the\nprisoners started along a passageway. The other\nguard brought up the rear.\n\nThey crossed spidery overpasses that spanned busy\nworkshops and agriculture bays under cultivation.\nPeople and service robots moved about; the new\nprisoners drew few glances.\n\nJenkins drew them to a halt in a wide corridor.\nAhead was a shimmering force field. He murmured\nwords and placed the palm of his hand on a dull\ncomposite plate embedded in the wall. The force\nfield faded to a haze. They passed through, and\nthe haze resumed its shimmer behind them.\n\nA portal came into view up ahead.\n\nJenkins motioned toward it and stepped aside as the\nprisoners passed him and on through the opening.\nThe guards did not follow.\n\nOf a sudden minus their escorts, the inmates\nclustered inside the entry and stared about.\n\nThe compartment was generous by space habitat\nstandards. Well-lighted, it stretched ten meters\nfrom wall to opposite wall. Parallel in the center\nof the room a double line of four gray tables stood\nfused to the deck, each with benches on each long\nside, similarly immobilized. Evenly spaced along\nthe wall were curtained sleep-privacy enclosures.\nBehind partitions on opposite sides of the\ncompartment were entries to two standard\nwash-lavs. The furnishings were functional and clean.\n\nOne after the other, the prisoners drifted off to\ninspect the enclosures. All were back in less than\na minute; they silently kept distance from each\nother.\n\nThe inmate who had so carefully examined the\ncorridor while Malcolm talked, leaned against one\nof the tables and crossed his arms. He repeated his\nscan of the compartment, but this time one sector\nat a time, turning to take it all in yet pass over\neach cell-mate that entered his field of vision. His\nmovements gave the group a focus; it was easier\nthan to just stare at the walls and the austere\nfurnishings.\n\n\"I don't get this,\" the table-leaner locked arms\nacross his chest as he spoke with a puzzled\nexpression on his face. His voice was low, flat yet\ncourteous. \"We may as well get the formalities out\nof the way. Who are we? Names will do for starters.\nI'm Brad.\"\n\nFaces relaxed a mite. One of the women sat on a\nbench. The ice may have cracked, but the silence\nheld. Brad had their attention.\n\nSeconds passed.\n\n\"Hodak.\"\n\nThe word welled up as a growl, low and rumbling\nfrom a squat, muscular man. His deeply embedded\neyes circled the room from under a boulder-brow\nthat bridged the space beneath his bald pate to\nblend with the stub nose, wide mouth and crinkled\nskin of a seemingly amiable face.\n\n\"I'm Zolan,\" said the third male. He was of medium\nheight, slight of build, waxy features and a high\nbrow with the pallid complexion of a spacer. As\nalert and tense as a coiled spring, Zolan leaned\nagainst a bulkhead, eyes moving rapidly from\nBrad to Hodak to the walls to fix on an opposite\nbulkhead.\n\n\"That takes care of the men.\" A woman's voice,\nmelodious, dulcet. \"I'm Adari.\"\n\nSturdy, tightly curled hair and chocolate-toned\nskin. Her soft, rounded features were dimpled,\ncheerful, animated. Standing near a sleep\nenclosure, her grin was infectious. She brought\nlong-absent grins, twinkles and nods from the\nothers.\n\nRepeating her name slowly, she smiled invitingly\nat the petite woman seated on a nearby bench.\n\n\"My, aren't we cautious,\" the little one said as\nshe looked up and returned Adari's grin. \"I am\nKumiko,\" she shifted her eyes to take in the\nothers, \"and I regret to say that I am not\nparticularly pleased to be among you.\" She\npaused, looked down. \"Nothing personal, mind\nyou, it's just that I did have other hopes.\"\n\nEyes shifted to the last of the group. Tall and\nslender, olive-skinned, she paced the narrow space\nbetween the wall and the cell's central section.\nHer turn, no longer to be put off.\n\n\"Myra,\" she said flatly.\n\nThe silence closed back in.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter FOUR\n\n\nThe meeting hall was roughly triangular, the rows\nof form-fit seats molded into the deck which sloped\ndownward toward a slightly raised platform jammed\ninto a corner. Alongside the platform a meter-wide\nview tank rose from the deck to merge with the\noverhead. A single cable snaked from the view\ntank's base and disappeared into the nearby\nbulkhead.\n\nThe six inmates entered, milled about, silent,\ntheir features without expressions. In their own\ntime, they each took seats, several empties apart.\nThe first three rows remained vacant.\n\nHodak broke the silence. \"The Blue Plate Special\nthe Looie gave didn't sound right,\" he growled.\n\"I want to know more about what he was gettin' at\nwith that crack about our schedule 'being different'.\"\n\nAdari turned, eyebrows raised, to stare at him\nthoughtfully. She nodded slowly and turned back\nto join the others to focus on a figure perched\non a high stool beside the view tank.\n\nHe looked tall, despite his being seated. A\nslate-gray uniform covered him from neck to ankles;\nhis feet shod in high-top deck slippers that matched\nthe shade of his garment. He wore no insignia. Long,\ncrowded features and tawny space-worn skin formed\na face of planes and angles. His hairless head and\nlong hands looked like they might have been hacked\nfrom a block of Mercurian tuscanite and left to\nweather for a few million years in the sun's glare.\n\nThe hall quieted. Satisfied that he had their\nattention, the man stood. The mere suggestion of\nheight, seated, did not do him justice. He unfolded\nlike an articulated, mechanical crane. Fully\nextended, his towering frame rose more than\ntwo meters from heels to naked, gleaming scalp.\n\nHis first words took Hodak's challenge.\n\n\"You will know, Hodak.\" His voice was soft, and\ncarried the gravity of authority.\n\nHis eyes moved from one to the other.\n\n\"What I say here applies to all of you,\" he said.\n\"I will not answer all of your questions, but you\nwill be told all you need to know at this time.\"\n\nHe stepped down toward them from the dais,\nhalting inside the curve of the first row of seats.\n\n\"I am Ram Xindral,\" he said, \"your orientation\nlecturer, your trainer and, should you need one,\nyour counselor. I am also your Control. Take\nspecific note of the term 'control'. It has only\none meaning: you are in a prison, but from here on\ntake no orders from prison staff. You take your\norders only from me; I am not 'prison' staff.\"\n\n\"What the hell!\"\n\nHodak again, bouncing up, down, up again. Adari,\nher mouth open in surprise and alarm, also stood,\npaused, and moved to stand beside Hodak. Zolan\nremained seated, his hooded eyes on Xindral. Kumiko\nshifted position slightly and stared vacantly at\nthe deck. Myra remained motionless, her face also\nclosed. Brad, brows drawn into a frown, crossed\nhis arms, waiting.\n\n\"Hah! This sure as hell isn't the standard\norientation lecture for new inmates.\" Adari's\njeering laugh burst from her in a sardonic cascade.\n\n\"No, Adari, it isn't,\" Ram said with a smile, \"but\nhear me out.\"\n\nThe hall was suddenly charged with tension and\nwariness. Hodak remained on his feet, bent forward,\nhands gripping the back of the seat in front of him,\nchallenge in his eyes.\n\nXindral clasped his hands behind his back. The\ngesture tightened his frame and seemed to increase\nhis height. He faced away from them, strode back\nto stand beside the view tank and turned. Hodak\ngrunted, sat, muttered under his breath; Adari took\nthe seat alongside, leaned in toward Hodak, listened\nto him mumble, and grinned, nudged and nodded.\n\n\"Details later,\" Xindral continued. \"Let's get\nthis first part over with. I'll talk. Cut in with\nquestions if you must, and bitch if it helps; we'll\nget to know each other better. If you take off\non a tangent, so be it. I'll go along, within limits.\nI didn't expect this to be a monologue, by far.\nIt'll take a while, but you'll get the information\nI intend you to have.\"\n\nAn uneasy shifting about ensued. The prisoners\nweren't buying. Brad sensed the apprehension in\nthe others that he felt in himself. Xindral's opening\nremarks along with his aura projected formidable\npower despite his slender frame.\n\n\"Before we continue,\" Xindral said, \"know that\nyou are not quartered in the penal section of the\nstation. The usual new arrivals don't get this sort\nof attention. Furthermore, the lectures given\nto them are confined to station routines. Their\nprocessing includes a few tests that are evaluated\nfor basic intelligence and skills. It helps the\nstaff assign them to shops, rehab training,\nand eventually for return to the outside world.\nYou're not that lucky.\"\n\nXindral's last words jolted Hodak back on to his\nfeet.\n\n\"Look, whoever the hell you are,\" he rumbled,\njabbing a stubby finger at Xindral, \"let's cut out\nthe crap about our luck. First the Looie, now you,\nputtin' on this mystery act with fancy hints that\ndon't make sense. You said we're allowed to ask\nquestions. OK, here's one: am I an inmate in this\nprison or not?\"\n\n\"You are, and you aren't,\" Xindral shrugged.\n\"That's my answer at this time. As we talk,\nthe picture will clear.\"\n\nXindral's face flexed into a grin.\n\nThe animosity in the hall was palpable, exacerbated\nby Xindral's evasive response to a fair question.\nAs Hodak grumbled his way back down into his seat\nthe elongated figure drew a flat, palm-sized control\nfrom a sheath fastened to his belt and pressed an\nembedded key.\n\nThe view tank's haze cleared to the standard solar\nschematic. The scene faded, replaced by a ring of\ntiny multicolored lights: the Asteroid Belt.\n\n\"This display is tailored to the general run of\ninmates processed through orientation, just to give\nthem an idea where they are. Their familiarity with\ndeep space is often limited, so station lectures\nstart with fundamentals. We'll pass on this.\"\n\nBrad tensed at Xindral's choice of words, and\nsensed the others had been similarly alerted.\nHe glanced sideways. His companions, as he,\nstared at one another as if seeing them for\nthe first time. Were they of a kind?\n\nXindral continued as if he hadn't noticed.\n\n\"A footnote,\" he said. \"The Belt's been cleared of\nalmost all rocks and swarms, plus the big ones that\nwe couldn't use for outposts. As you may recall\nfrom your school days, it wasn't easy hauling\nmicro-spunnel terminals around the Belt and ramming\nrocks into the hoppers for transfer to meltdown and\nrefining above Venus.\n\n\"In short, the big space sweeps of five to eight\nhundred years ago cleared away most of the residue\nin Belt orbits that had no beneficial purpose and\nwere a hazard to traffic. The Belt was a good\nsource for minerals -- while it lasted.\"\n\nHe paused to key the instrument in his hand.\n\n\"That's done,\" he said. \"What's left are only a few\nof the big asteroids, like Ceres. They serve both\nregions as Solar Spacetrack Centers, communications\nrelays, search and rescue operations, space lanes\ndebris collection teams, urgent care hospitals, and\nfor spunnel gateways management.\"\n\nAs he spoke the ring of lights in the tank\nflickered. Another ring formed, evenly spaced rods,\neach glowing a contrasting color.\n\n\"The Guardian Stations,\" Xindral said, \"have been\nin position for more than six centuries. Twenty\nstations; no more are planned.\"\n\nThe tank zoomed in on five of the twenty rods\nin a quarter segment of the full orbit; the rods\nexpanded to form slowly rotating cylinders.\n\n\"The Guardians are apportioned among four\ngenerally equal sectors, any one of which serves\nthe quadrant that it happens to transit at the\ntime. Responsibilities and missions overlap, and\nare passed along from the station moving out of a\nquadrant to the one entering it along the common\norbital path. Using standard and hyperspace\nomnidirectional surveillance, each station's\nprimary job is to monitor its sector: inward toward\nthe Sun, and outward to the rim and beyond as far as\nour technical capabilities extend. The service areas\nchange constantly in keeping with the alignments\nand dynamics of planets and their satellites,\ntraffic-lane management, neutralizing debris\nintrusions, and conventional and spunnel teleport\nmaintenance.\"\n\nXindral folded himself back on to the high stool as\nhe spoke.\n\n\"After the political separation of the Inner and\nOuter Regions these Guardian Stations reverted\nto us by the treaty. Formally, they serve only the\nInner Region's jurisdictions. Informally, however,\nthe stations cover the entire system; to do\notherwise would bring about enormous disruptions\nand disasters in space traffic and communications.\n\n\"The Guardians' functions include standard and\nspunnel communications, disaster relief, search and\nrescue of distressed spacecraft, intercepting and\ndiverting comets-of-hazard, meteors, debris and\nother threats to traffic in the space-ways that\nserve the Inner Region's space colonies needs.\nOften the Outer Region's folks help when their\ninterests are involved; just as often they don't.\nIt's one of the prices we pay for this political\nbreach, and one of the most frustrating.\"\n\nZolan turned to aim a remark at Adari. She giggled\nand elbowed Hodak. He growled and twisted away.\nKumiko's eyes lifted from the deck to lazily roam\nthe blank overhead.\n\nMyra's face openly played non-listener. Brad\ncontinued to observe Xindral closely, glancing\noccasionally at the tank.\n\nAware that he was losing his audience, Xindral\npaused and stood quietly for a moment.\n\n\"Do my words bore you?\" He leaned forward to\ntake them all in. His voice, still soft, nevertheless\nexposed a cutting edge.\n\nZolan looked at Xindral as he contemptuously gave\nthe tank the back of his hand.\n\n\"Who're you trying to kid?\" His challenge was\ncast low, tight. \"I don't know about the rest of\nthese folks. I haven't asked any of them about\nthemselves, nor have they tried to check me out.\nBut you wouldn't have brought us together without\nfirst investigating us for whatever your purpose\nmight be. For example; you must know I'm a space\ncommunicator. So, frankly, your rambling on like\nthis not only bores me, its phoniness is clear and\ninsulting.\"\n\nHodak slapped his knee and laughed. He pointed at\nZolan, then wagged his finger at Ram.\n\n\"Comm isn't my beat,\" he said. Thumbing over his\nshoulder at Zolan, he added, \"but what he said goes\nfor me.\"\n\nXindral brushed the keys on the control and\nreturned it to its case. The view tank faded\nas he fixed his eyes on Zolan.\n\n\"Yes, Zolan, I am familiar with your background.\"\nShifting to Hodak, \"Yours, too.\" His glance widened\nto include the others, \"as I am with the backgrounds\nof you all.\"\n\nIn response, the prisoners silently glared defiance.\n\n\"Zolan's observation is correct and on point,\"\nXindral said, ignoring their disdain. \"We're not\nfooling one another. Simply stated, you have much\nin common. You are professional space men and\nspace women, and highly qualified at that. Your\nskills and resourcefulness remain with you and\nI am aware of them.\"\n\nSlouchers straightened. Hodak and Adari looked\naround and their faces broke into grins, which were\nreturned. Tension remained, but subtly altered.\n\n\"A couple of points,\" said Xindral. \"First, you are\nall from sunside of the Belt and you are not known,\nas far as my sources can determine, where I don't\nwant you to be. Second, together, you represent a\ncross-section of space professions and experience\nvital to the success of an important and urgent\ntask. What you are going to be asked to do will\nplace your lives at risk. You will need to rely on\neach other, personally and professionally, under\ndifficult circumstances.\"\n\nBrad had enough.\n\n\"Now let's just wait a minute!\"\n\nBrad was on his feet, instantly joined by the\nothers.\n\nXindral, head cocked slightly to one side, sat\nand listened.\n\n\"Zolan said it first,\" said Brad. \"None of us\nspeaks for the others, so what I say is for\nmyself. Who are you to force me -- us -- into\na life-risk situation?\"\n\nThe words, tightened in long-suppressed rage,\nspewed forth.\n\n\"You just counted off a couple of 'points'.\" Brad\nraised his hand, index finger raised. \"Now here's\none for you. I'm here because I was convicted\nof a so-called offense against society. No way\ndo I consider myself a criminal; furthermore, I\ndon't know if these others,\" motioning in their\ndirection, \"consider themselves criminals or not.\nAgain, I say, not my business. I'm here to serve\na prison sentence, and that doesn't include doing\nodd jobs where my life goes on the line.\"\n\nBrad and Xindral faced each other across\ntension-charged space. The momentary\nconfrontation passed, Brad, obviously fed up\nwith Xindral's evasions, crossed his arms across\nhis chest and waited. The tall man studied him.\n\n\"Your point is well made,\" he said. \"You have\nforced the issue forward, and your challenge\nmust be answered before we go much further.\nHere are a few of the pieces. Think about them.\"\n\nHe stepped back on to the platform and took his\nseat.\n\n\"You were selected only after a searching\ninvestigation into your backgrounds,\" he said.\n\"We considered your records, personalities,\nand your capabilities: phys and psy, professional\nskills, job performance, resiliency, whatever the\ntask I assign to you will likely call for.\n\n\"You are now a UIPS task group, for want of a\nbetter designation. One of you will be appointed\nCommander. You will be given a job to do. You\nwill depend on each other in most difficult\ncircumstances: your records for reliability\nunder stress were among the selection criteria.\nYou were acceptable.\n\n\"As to your appointment, that was made by an\nauthority outside this station, actually, outside\nthe Correctional Service of which this penal\ninstitution is a part. From the time you were\nmoved into the holding cells for transfer here, you\ncame under the jurisdiction of a Ministry that is\ninvolved with the most vital interests of the UIPS.\nThe specifics of your mission will be covered in our\nnext session.\"\n\n\"The hell you say.\" Hodak bounced again. \"You're\nstill dangling us on a string. Lay the whole bit\nout. Now!\"\n\nNods and grunts followed Hodak's demand.\n\n\"Very well,\" Xindral said, after a short pause.\n\"Actually, there's no reason to delay your marching\norders.\"\n\nHis voice flattened.\n\n\"By direction of the President of the United Inner\nPlanetary System you are appointed to the Strategic\nPenetrations Detachment of the Ministry of\nIntelligence. Your unit identifier is 'Sentinels'.\nYour unit commander is Brad Curtin, present.\n\n\"Copies of your orders are in a secured file in\nthe Ministry of Intelligence. A copy is temporarily\nposted in your core compartment. When you read it,\nnote that all requests for release or reassignment\nare denied.\"\n\nXindral folded back into his normal, slightly bowed\nposture. His audience, frozen, stared at him blankly.\n\n\"That's it for now.\" Xindral ordered, the flatness\ngone. \"Return to your compartment and report\nback here in an hour. Brad, please stand by.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter FIVE\n\n\nHis jaws clamped tight, eyes glaring, Brad sensed\nhis companions rise to their feet around him.\nKumiko first, stood and wordlessly glided to the\nclosed passage portal. Her back to the others, she\nwaited for the panel to clear. Zolan, on his feet,\nmouth agape, stared at Xindral.\n\nAdari, still seated, gawked in bewildered disbelief\nfrom Xindral to Brad to Hodak. Hodak glowered,\ngestured rudely and cursed furiously and loudly.\nMyra stood, silent behind an icy mask. Xindral,\nperched on his stool, arms in his lap, impassively\nobserved their reactions.\n\nThe scene held for several seconds. Xindral broke\nthe silence.\n\n\"Your formal orientation and training begins when\nyou return. First I must speak with your Commander.\nPlease excuse us.\"\n\nHe turned and touched a disk on the bulkhead. The\nentryway cleared and Jenkins appeared.\n\n\"Escort our friends back to their compartment,\nJenks. Commander Curtin will remain with me.\nReturn the group in an hour.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nMyra, Adari, Hodak and Zolan milled about for a\nmoment, then joined Kumiko at the portal. Passing\nthrough, they spoke and gestured animatedly to\neach other. The portal clouded over.\n\nXindral hefted his stool forward, placed it\nalongside Brad, and folded his long frame onto it\nfacing the view tank.\n\n\"Just so you know, Brad,\" he said gently, bridging\nthe silence between them, \"those of us who work in\nStrategic Penetrations carry no formal rank. If we\ndid, yours would be the equivalent of a Lieutenant\nCommander in the United Inner Planetary System\nSpace Force. Mine would be a notch or so above.\"\n\nHe shifted his frame about and bent a long leg\nto bring his foot up to the lower rung. His tone\nshifted into neutral. Cool.\n\n\"My friends call me Ram. OK?\"\n\nBrad nodded, eyeing him. Ram drew back a bit\nand contemplated the control in his grasp. After a\nmoment he stroked the keys. A rainbow of colors\nswirled and drifted off, replaced by an ash-gray\nsphere. Planet Pluto spread across half the tank\nwith its flat stretches of methane frost broken\nby low, jagged chasms, hillocks and craters. Charon\nand the Slingshot Logistics Depot hung off near\nthe edge of the tank's flattened top.\n\nBrad glanced at the scene, and back to Ram.\n\n\"Brad,\" Ram spoke slowly, quietly, \"a trite\nexpression, repeated all too often during our\nhistory, is 'humankind now faces its greatest\ncrisis'. The statement has been declared so often\nacross the ages that it's lost meaning, obviously\nbecause it changes in context and perception\nfrom one event, century or millennium to the\nnext. I suppose those who said it, believed it.\nNevertheless, even if the term 'crisis' never\nreally applied in the past, it does in these times\nfor humankind's destiny.\n\n\"The deficits in our nonrenewable assets, and the\nmany other natural substances we depend on, if\nnot resolved within the next few centuries, could\nforce us back into caves, and I don't use that word\n'figuratively'. Ceramics, composites, and other\nsubstitutes are fine as far as they go, but they\ndo only a tiny part of the job.\n\n\"We'll soon be running short of substitutes for\nour substitutes. Building bigger and better colonies\nin space over the past thousand years or so has\nconsumed far more of our resources than expected.\nEarth is almost barren and many space colonies in\nboth regions can no longer meet existing needs\nfromtheir regions, let alone those of the future.\n\n\"In short, our dispersed civilizations must have\naccess to sources for minerals and other industrial\nsubstances, not only now but in perpetuity, in order\nto survive and evolve. Our species isn't built to\naccept inactivity or slipping backward. If we don't\nmove on to something new and challenging, then\nwe'll drift into extinction. You've heard this all\ndozens of times; I won't dwell on it further.\"\n\nRam stood, paced, and turned his head to keep Brad\nin sight as he paced and reversed direction. Brad's\neyes fixed on the view tank and stayed there.\nThere was nothing new in Ram's words, so far.\n\n\"Slingshot schedules are in their most critical\nphase. We have a launch window for the Extractor.\nIt's not much of a window. If we miss it, Slingshot\nfails. It's that simple. The launch cannot be\naborted; there'll be no second chance. People\nacross the system, by the millions, are committed\nto the schedule. You, and your crew now serve in\nthat legion.\"\n\n\"What's going on here?\" Brad cut in. \"Are you\ntelling me we've been pressed into this job with\nno choice of our own?\"\n\nHis anger showing, Brad thumbed over his shoulder\ntoward the entryway, then at his chest.\n\n\"Tell me, Ram,\" Brad demanded, \"how did it happen\nthat we six, three men and three women, are here\nat this time for this purpose?\"\n\n\"We'll get to that in time.\" Ram said, \"I've\nreviewed your trial record, but I'd like to hear it\nfrom you -- straight. What happened?\"\n\nBrad stared at Ram for several seconds, obviously\nmaking up his mind. Finally, he shrugged, and\ncontemplated his hands.\n\n\"Well, then you know I was Captain of a space\nfreighter,\" he began. \"My job was to transport\nhigh-mass mining equipment, ores and refined\nstuff between Mercury, Venus and Luna.\n\n\"When this mess happened, we were Luna-bound with\na full load of worn out track-layers, rock-crushers,\ndrill robots, filters and other tools in the\nforward and aft storage bays, and ingots\nwell-secured in stress-certified compartments.\nThe ship was at capacity, but within legal limits.\nMass and balance had been certified by Space\nTraffic Control before they cleared us from Venus\norbit. The ship was in order.\n\n\"We were only about twenty-million kay from\nthe Luna Space Traffic Control Zone, but still in\nmax drive. Plenty of time to kick-in vector and\ndeceleration programs.\"\n\nBrad paused, shifted position, rubbed his jaws,\nsighed deeply, glanced sideways at Xindral and,\nhis voice tighter, continued.\n\n\"That's when that strung-out jock in a space-buggy\ntook us on for a game of 'chicken'.\n\n\"The buggy was a single-seater, tiny, barely ten\nmeters bow to stern, but the way she whipped\naround us, it was plain to my duty officer that\nshe was charged by a micro deep space drive.\nMy duty officer hit the alarm; I got to the bridge\nwithin ten seconds after the buggy's first pass.\n\n\"I checked our status and proximity-to-mass\nin vicinity; then my ship's scope analyses of the\nbuggy's thrust and gyrations. She was obviously\noverpowered for mass, especially in the confined\nlanes plowed by slow freighters like mine.\n\n\"My three-hundred-meter freighter with all storage\nbays packed bulkhead to bulkhead with high mass, is\nbarely maneuverable under the best of circumstances.\nEvasive action against some hot shot in a souped up\nspace-buggy was out of the question.\n\n\"It got worse. Not only did the jock ignore my\nwarnings; he lined up alongside my bridge and\ndanced on his thrusters. He flipped from relative\nvertical to horizontal, then corkscrewed us\nlengthwise fore to aft and back. To add insult, he\nwhirled his buggy on its tail like a damn dervish,\nright alongside where I stood on my bridge and\nthen cut across my bow. That hotshot was one\ngood pilot, I'll grant him that.\n\n\"After a minute or so of that, the buggy circled\nmy ship, close. The pilot probably liked what he saw,\nbecause he surface-snaked us again bow to stern.\nThat must have been boring; he peeled away, tore\nahead a quarter-million kay, skewed around, and\ncame straight at my bow, curdling space. When\ncollision was just about unavoidable, he did an up\nand over. In doing that, he cut us much too close,\nsnapped off a dozen masts, sensors and nav guides.\n\n\"The jock must have gone berserk; he took us on\nfor full 'chicken'. He shot ahead about a million kay,\nflip-flopped, and came at us head-to-head, taunting\nus with his collision signals. Our computer showed\nhim as boosting all the way.\"\n\nAnother long pause. Brad looked directly at Xindral.\n\n\"We collided, head on,\" he said. \"That brightly\ncolored, beautiful little flitter buried itself\ndeep in our forward cargo bay. My rescue team\nwent in, but we knew ahead of time what we'd find.\nIt was there: chunks of metal, shards of bone,\nand scraps of flesh splattered on mining gear,\nrock-crushers, and other odd pieces of equipment.\n\n\"The Space Guard hearings were followed by a\nquick trial. The jock was the son of a politician,\nso here I am.\"\n\nBrad looked away, then back at Ram.\n\n\"Your turn,\" he said. \"What's the story on how we\nbecame the 'chosen'?\"\n\n\"The selection was certainly not random,\" Ram\nstood and stretched to his full height as he\nspoke. \"Despite the billions of citizens in the UIPS,\nwe're all tagged and catalogued. It's a simple job\nfor the computers to correlate any unique manpower\nrequirements the government might have to the UIPS\nindex, cross-check phys-psy profiles, professions\nand technical skills plus experience, competence,\nreliability and anything else that we crank in as\nrating factors. You mentioned 'three men and\nthree women'; your mission can not exclude\ngender compatibility consistent with the prevailing\npsychosocial construct -- this is what we are.\n\n\"In my line of work, our data bank produces\nan optimal selection of personalities, skills and\nidentities for the best possible teams we might\nneed to support our contingency plans. Old stuff;\nwe've been doing that throughout history. Why you\nfolks? The computer selected you, showed where\neach of you was located and why, and that you were\nall, shall we say, relatively unknown and available.\nNone of you will be missed.\"\n\nBrad and Ram locked eyes as Ram added, \"As far as\nthe mission goes, you and your colleagues were sent\nhere for confinement and rehab, whatever the reason\nand however rehab was to be done. It's just that\nyour team has been diverted. Coddling and other\namenities of confinement are not part of our\nprogram. If you feel you're being treated unfairly,\nthat's unfortunate. We need every qualified man\nand woman we can get. The prime requisite is that\nthe team, meaning you and your colleagues, have\nand share the intelligence, initiative, guts and\nwhatever else it takes to do the job.\"\n\n\"That's another point right there,\" Brad shot\nback. \"You've assigned us a mission, you tell us it's\ndangerous, and then add, as an aside, you've judged\nus up to it, whatever in hell that's supposed to\nmean. But let me tell you, if I'm the guy to run\nit, I want to know a lot more. I've got to have\nconfidence each team member will be there when\nthe chips are down. So, what can I expect?\"\n\nFor a moment, Ram gazed shrewdly at Brad. His\neyes twinkled, and his features mustered a sly grin.\n\n\"You seem to have slipped into the role of team\nCommander,\" he said.\n\nBrad looked away, hesitated a moment, and rubbed\nhis jaw thoughtfully.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I agree with what you've said\nabout the mess we're in. No question in my mind\nthat Slingshot is our only option. Obviously, I\nhave nothing else on my schedule. Just doing time\nin this tin can would be a bore. But that doesn't\njustify your pushing me -- us -- around. OK, that's\nsaid, let's get back to my crew. I'll not pry where\nI've no business to, but who are they?\"\n\n\"Their psychological profiles are available to\nyou,\" said Ram. \"I agree, you'll know all you need\nto know about them to get the job done. I can give\nyou a quick rundown on each now, if you wish.\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Myra is a logistician and a Medic certified to\nLevel 4 in space-related trauma, physical and\npsychological. She was Med-Exec to a research\nteam in a mini-tank town off Venus. Somehow,\nshe got involved with the leader of a gang running\ncontrolled substances around the Inner Region. When\nthe net was pulled in, there she was. Tried as an\naccessory and judged guilty. Nowhere near criminal\nin my judgment. She's quite bitter because she was\nused, and then convicted and sentenced on what\nshe feels are false charges.\"\n\n\"I understand her bitterness.\"\n\n\"Nothing we can do. Your engineer, Hodak, is a\ndamned good heavy-duty spacecraft maintenance\nengineer. Also lots of experience on a broad range\nof space support equipment used in surface ops.\nHe's been all over the Inner Region, and worked\non Ceres where he was the spaceport's Chief of\nMaintenance for about ten years. Got into a fight\noff Mars while on R & R and killed a guy. Convicted\nof manslaughter. He's an expert in the martial arts\nand in using exotic weapons. Space-wise.\"\n\n\"Understood. Next?\"\n\n\"Zolan. As he said, a communicator and, I might\nadd, from way back. As a child, he was classified\n'gifted' and treated accordingly by the system.\nAt the age of twelve, he came up with design\nrefinements for spunnel cracking and transmission\nthat raised eyebrows among the top pros in\nthe field. His skill caused his downfall: he was\nconvicted of illegally penetrating and modifying a\ndatabase that was integrating a highly sensitive\nproject. Just enjoying the challenge, he claimed.\nThe project engineer didn't get wise until too\nlate. During the trial he told off his former\nbosses; called them incompetent and not qualified\nto pass judgment on him or his work. Anyhow,\nhe got a couple of years to cool off.\"\n\n\"Does this job call for his kind of communications\nexpertise?\"\n\n\"Yes, and more. Zolan is an extremely important\nasset for your mission. You'll agree, I think, when\nwe get to your orders and the operation. I should\nadd that, when your training is over, you will all\nbe good communicators. But Zolan is at the hub.\"\n\n\"That leaves Adari and Kumiko. What's their input?\"\n\n\"Adari is your navigator. She knows both Regions\nlike the palm of her hand, and her record shows\nshe's well versed in nav for the entire system. She\ngot drunk on duty and borrowed the ship's recreation\nfunds without permission to have a gambling holiday\non Luna's Station Vegas. She returned broke as well\nas hung over. To add to her problems, some joker on\nVegas gave her a whiff of Titan's deep strata gas.\nAlmost blew her mind, but she's OK now. Spent\na year in hospital on Guardian 18. No permanent\ndamage. Now, she's doing time on the funds charge.\nExcellent navigator and gutsy.\"\n\n\"Kumiko?\"\n\n\"Ah, little Kumiko,\" Ram smiled. \"Last, but far\nfrom least. Kumiko is a former officer of the UIPS\nSpace Force and an expert in space armaments.\nShe can break down entire systems, and repair and\nreassemble them, blindfolded, from micro-miniatures\nto the big stuff. For some reason, her talent\nmade her rather defiant of authority. Took\nmanual control of her ship's guns when her patrol's\nsensors tagged unknowns inbound across no-mans-land\nsunside of the Jovian orbit. The unknowns were\nunder a heavy screen and wouldn't cooperate with\nthe Space Guard's self-identification requirements.\nHer Commander told her to punch a tiny hole in the\nscreens, just enough to identify.\n\n\"Instead, she not only blew the screens away, she\nscorched the bow of a UIPS cruiser on a classified\nmission. The cruiser was out-of-line, of course;\nthey should have responded to the query; protocols\ncall for them to do so. But Kumiko went too far.\nShe was forced to resign from the Service, and\noffered a choice to either join a penetration team\nto the Outer Region or work in an arsenal under\ntight supervision. She made her choice.\"\n\n\"Quite a group.\"\n\n\"All different, yet six of a kind,\" he said. \"None\nof you, by far, are hardened offenders of the law.\nThe crimes you were convicted of were, how shall\nI put it, less than deliberately malicious.\"\n\n\"Hah!\" Brad's bitter snort curdled in his gullet.\n\nXindral shrugged. His manner changed; tightened.\nHe motioned toward the view tank.\n\n\"Let's get on with it, Brad,\" he said. \"There's a\nlot we need to cover.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter SIX\n\n\nBrad leaned back, drew his legs in and stretched\nthem straight, heels to the deck. His eyes followed\nRam to the dais and as he turned to face him.\n\n\"You and your crew will start intensive training in\nintelligence operations using our most advanced\nmethods. It will cover infiltration, interrogation,\npsychological defenses against psychic probes\nand other means that might be used to acquire\ninformation from you, under duress or otherwise.\nYou will absorb intelligence countermeasures and\ncounter-countermeasures, identification of military\nspacecraft and weapons used by both the UIPS\nand INOR, analysis of our military capabilities and\nthose of our adversaries, covert communications\nthrough conventional, unconventional and spunnel\nchannels, and other tricks of the trade. Your quick\nreaction reflexes will be enhanced through means\nthat will not be apparent to you.\"\n\n\"What does that last part mean?\"\n\n\"I'll get to it. First, your mission. Your escape\nfrom this Station has been arranged. The pieces\nare being moved into place. Your immediate\ndestination is tanktown Coldfield on Planet Pluto.\"\n\nThe view tank's image of Pluto expanded as did\nthe gray-black contrasts of the planet's surface.\nA white light in a mottled area blinked, drawing\nBrad's momentary attention. His eyes returned\nto Ram.\n\n\"Your initial field of operations is centered in\nColdfield,\" Ram pointed to the light. \"Where you go\nfrom there depends on the contacts you develop\nand how well you exploit each opportunity. The tank\ntown has a permanent population of about fifty\nthousand plus about ten thousand transients.\nMix with the transients for starters.\"\n\n\"Get to the mission, Ram,\" Brad cut Xindral short.\n\nRam sighed. \"We've sent a succession of formal\ndiplomatic missions to INOR,\" he said, \"including a\nfew to the renegades that now run Planet Pluto.\nWe've asked them repeatedly to not interfere with\nthe Slingshot program. We've emphasized to each\nINOR government that Slingshot is as important\nto them as it is to us. They're not listening. We're\nstill pressing diplomatic means, meanwhile, our\nlogistics is being disrupted by Pluto's President\nNarval's hoodlums.\"\n\n\"How does this team fit in?\"\n\n\"If we send in a military force to sweep away\nthese scoundrels, our action will be seen as an\nimperialist intrusion into the Outer Region. It\nwill create such resentment among the governments\nout there that the Slingshot schedule cannot help\nbut suffer serious harm. Getting INOR's cooperation\nwill also become more difficult than ever.\n\n\"Maybe, if we gather enough hard evidence of\na conspiracy and confront them with it, they'll\nchange their ways. Right now, they're blaming the\nattacks on partisans over whom they say they\nhave no control. We don't buy that. We need you\nto gather and send confirmations to us and, while\nyou're doing that, disrupt the plans and weapons\nbeing marshaled against us. Use whatever\ninitiatives you can devise on site. Go where you\nneed to, do whatever it takes to frustrate our\nadversaries.\"\n\n\"What happens if we fail?\"\n\n\"Failure is unacceptable. As long as you or any\nof your people are alive and useful to us we'll get\nthrough to you and we'll expect you to keep us\ncurrent on developments.\"\n\n\"Big order.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is.\"\n\n\"I am, or rather, I was, skipper of a space\nfreighter,\" Brad said, tenting his hands. \"I know\nalmost nothing of military operations, intelligence\ngathering, and especially covert actions, whatever\nthose might entail. I'm not familiar with space\nweapons except for garden-variety small arms. Other\nthan Kumiko, I gather that the members of this team\nare not experts in the weapons and explosives we\nare likely to encounter or use. You're sending us\nin against a rough crowd, from the way you describe\nthem. Aren't you risking a lot on us?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"I refuse.\"\n\n\"You're not being given the choice. Neither are\nthe others.\"\n\n\"I can withhold my cooperation.\"\n\n\"I repeat, Brad, you have no choice.\"\n\nRam paused, eyeball to eyeball with Brad,\nwhose eyes had gone cold. Ram's voice went as\nflat as when he had read the group their orders.\n\n\"You will be psychologically adjusted as you\nprogress through this indoctrination. The\n'adjustment', for want of a better term, is\nnecessary for several reasons. It applies to\nthe entire team.\"\n\nBrad stared.\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"Just that we can't afford to let normal human\nweaknesses and scruples interfere the mission.\"\n\n\"The hell you say,\" Brad raised his voice. \"You're\ntelling me we're expendable?\"\n\n\"You're in covert intelligence work, Brad, and\nyou'll be in the enemy's camp. Doesn't that\nanswer your question?\"\n\n\"Come on, dammit.\"\n\nMeeting Brad's eyes, Ram shrugged.\n\n\"Each of you will be full to the brim with\nmotivational boosters to keep you oriented to\nthe mission. You won't stray, whatever the\ntemptations. We'll install undetectable barriers\nagainst psychic probes; then there are...\"\n\n\"Damn you, Ram.\" Brad cut in, his voice crackling\nwith rage. \"You sons of bitches are going to\nrobotize us. Expendable is bad enough; you're\nprogramming us into suicide.\"\n\n\"Not quite, Brad. Hear me out.\"\n\nRam paced restlessly as he spoke, his tall, slender\nframe swaying, his head changing direction to\nmaintain eye contact.\n\nBrad rose and stood erect, legs apart, fists on\nhips, fury pouring out in his body language.\n\n\"Your team has just been assembled,\" Ram said,\n\"yet we don't have a moment to lose to get you\nin place and operational. Orientation and training\nwill allow no more than four sleeps. The special\nknowledge and skills each you needs for this\nmission will be implanted into your conscious and\nsubconscious minds, and, as it suits our needs,\ninto your survival instincts. We have a long\nhistory at this game.\"\n\nBrad rose and strode angrily up the aisle to the\ndoor and pressed the panel that would slide it\nopen. The panel did not function. Other than raise\nhis eyes to follow him to the door, Ram continued\ntalking as if Brad had remained nearby. After a\nmoment's hesitation, Brad returned to his seat.\nRam paused and gazed at Brad sympathetically.\n\n\"If you're all going to operate like a well-lubed\nmachine, without appearing to be doing so,\" he\nsaid, \"you'll need all the gimmicks we can hang on\nto each of you.\"\n\nRam shrugged and went on, \"News of your escape\nwill be broadcast system-wide; all part of the cover.\nThey'll be suspicious for quite a while, but you've\ngot to infiltrate, despite the risks.\n\n\"The mission has many subtleties; you must all\nunderstand how they interact. Above all, you must\nnever, despite the most extreme interrogation,\nbetray the mission. In that sense, yes, you are\nexpendable. Small comfort, I know, but insurance\nagainst betrayal will entail a simple psy-mod.\"\n\n\"Is there to be a complex one?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Let's have it all, man.\"\n\n\"If you are to join these terrorists, pirates, or\nwhatever they are, your characters must be suitable\nto blend with theirs. On the one hand, you will be\nloyal to each other and to us; on the other, you,\nand I mean each of you, will lie, cheat, bribe,\nsubvert, sabotage, and kill for the mission, and\nif it serves our greater purpose, act convincingly\nagainst us. That's one complex psy-mod.\"\n\n\"There's more?\"\n\n\"There's communications and one other. About\ncomm, off-planet messages from Planet Pluto,\nespecially through spunnel channels, are under\nthe tight control of Pluto's insurgent government.\nTransmission facilities are under constant heavy\nguard. You'll all be checked out by the Pluto's\nsecurity people to make sure none of you are\ncarrying prohibited comm gear or are otherwise\nwired.\"\n\n\"The 'other'.\"\n\n\"Last resort. It's need-to-know, if and when\nneeded. When you become aware of the\ncrisis to which it applies it will surface in your\nconsciousness and in the mind of one other member\nof your team. You'll each know what to do.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a jolly crowd.\"\n\nRam grinned.\n\n\"I'm sure you'll all have a party. Back to comm:\nthe Log Depot and the Terminal work sites\nhave spunnel centers. Zolan will have the access\ncodes to the Log Depot. At all costs, keep the\nconstruction site from becoming involved in\nthis intelligence operation. If word got out that\nwe used the Terminals for covert intelligence\nor military transmissions, the Outer Region\ngovernments would blow their collective tops.\nWe can rationalize using the Log Depot if we\nexperience piracy and harassment of our\ntransports and citizens. It'll be extremely\ndangerous to go beyond that.\"\n\n\"No chance of using the Pluto comm center?\"\nBrad asked.\n\n\"Don't count on it.\" Ram replied grimly.\n\n\"What happens afterward, assuming that we\nsurvive? Also, can what you're doing to each\nof us be reversed so that we can return to\nwhat, for us, would be normal?\"\n\n\"In the order you raise them: first, after this\nis over you will all be free citizens, records\ncleared, and we'll help you to return to your\nformer lives, or reasonably close to what they\nwere; second, the mods are reversible and you\nwill all be de-programmed.\n\n\"You mention survival, Brad. You may be searching\nfor assurance that you'll come through alive. I\ncan't give you that assurance, for you or for your\nteam. In all sincerity, I think that you and your\nteam have less than an even chance for survival.\nUnderstand then, the name of the game is dare,\nbut not stupidly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter SEVEN\n\n\nArms folded across his chest, Brad half-listened\nto Hodak reeling off status from screens that lined\nthe Raven's flaked, time-battered bridge.\n\nThe indicators in Brad's line-of-sight, at least\nthose that still functioned, displayed erratic and\nuncertain status of systems and accessories in the\nmain power plant, fluids pressure pumps, oxygen\ngenerators and other vital gear. More than slightly\nprecarious, according to the dials and blinking\nlights, but the records would show that the ancient\nutility had been accepted at the spunnel gateway\nin the void between the Asteroid Belt and Jupiter,\ndespite its technical difficulties.\n\nSneaking into the tail end of a crowded convoy of\nSlingshot-bound transports gave them the 'jump'\nthey needed. The Neptune spunnel exit would do\nfine and provide a seemingly reasonable story\nunder interrogation, if it came to that.\n\nStripped to her vitals, all but the simplest\ndecisions diverted from her computer, the Raven\nreminded Brad of his old freighter when he first\ntook her over. The Raven's maintenance records\nshowed that she had slipped to less than marginal.\nHodak's expertise with duct tape and hand tools\nwould get credit for the successful escape.\n\nPlanet Pluto, in her ashen melancholy, lay dead\nahead. Sprawled across the frozen methane plain\na couple of points to starboard Coldfield's lights\nshimmered through its frost-crusted, barely\ntranslucent dome. Stretching away from the\ntwenty-kilometer-wide city, the mottled terrain\nspread in all directions, slashed by ravines and\nman-made, soil-fused excavations, roads and\nbridges. Mooring towers, launch and landing pads\nspotted the barren landscape across which\ncrawled processions of utility tugs.\n\nNear-space cargo and passenger shuttles and\ntaxis landed at and departed from pads adjacent\npressurized air docks into the city. Deep-space\ntransports and utilities rode high, immobilized\nby fore-and-aft mag-beams at the pinnacles of\ntwo-hundred-meter mooring towers.\n\nThe Raven drifted closer. Brad noted the hard\norange glow of energy packs encapsulated in\nvehicles moving about on the dome and surrounding\nland surfaces. Adjusted magnification defined the\nvehicles as personnel carriers, flatbed trailers,\ndome fissure-fusers, and methane frost scrapers.\nColdfield was a busy place.\n\nCharon drifted into view from over the horizon as\nthe Raven nosed forward. Only Lamplight's dome\nand high-intensity flashers that pinpointed its\nlanding pads, gateways and walkways broke the\nmoonlet's solid gray-green landscape. Further out,\nthe logistics depot slid slowly across the sky like\na glowing green-and-orange sausage.\n\nZolan keyed a signal to Pluto Traffic Control\nas the Raven crossed the line into the planet's\njurisdiction. He added the ship's name and call\nsign. Several minutes passed without response.\nZolan leaned back from the console and winked at\nBrad. News of their presence had preceded them\nand the locals were likely wondering why had the\nship appeared in their skies.\n\nThe receiver squawked, \"Raven. Stand by for escort.\"\n\nA yellow-and-green-striped space tug drifted\nalongside and flashed its 'Follow Me' signal. Brad\nnodded at Zolan who acknowledged the tug's\ninstruction. Adari trimmed the Raven's controls\nand clamped a mag beam on the tug. She and the\ntug driver exchanged salutations and prattled\nnavigational details as the escort moved off with\nthe Raven following like an elephant leashed to a\nflea. Adari logged their destination: Slot 09 along\nColdfield marker 13K.\n\nTheir passage was slow. Despite the heavy traffic\nof tugs, taxis, and other small craft the lanes\nwere orderly and the flow steady. Traffic thinned\nas the ship drifted across surface-parked lots for\nsmall vessels and disappeared entirely as the Raven\nclosed on its mooring towers.\n\nThe escort rattled off the coordinates and the\nRaven fixed her position. Adari released the\nmag-beam. The tug slipped around to starboard\nand mag-nosed the clumsy vessel into its slot. A\ncommand from the tug and mooring beams glowed\nat the fore-and-aft towers to immobilize the Raven.\nAdari and the tug driver exchanged rough civilities\nand the escort was up and away.\n\n\"Lock down, fore and aft,\" Brad intoned. \"Safety\ncheck mooring beams and vital connections. Secure\nall internal hatches and passages. Set environment\ncontrols at minimal levels for an indefinite stay.\nReport.\"\n\nHe keyed the order into the log, added the time\nof entry, and keyed the record closed using his\nsuspended Space Master's code.\n\nMyra assembled records required by port officials.\nHodak and Adari consulted checklists as they\ntrooped from one compartment to the next; Hodak\nopened and closed switches, turned wheels and\nsecured and sealed valves as Adari observed and\nverified. She surveyed each station, mumbled,\n\"confirmed,\" and initialed the appropriate items\non her copy of the checklist.\n\nZolan closed down the deep space communications\nsystem and inspected their suit's intercoms. Kumiko\ndrew six handguns from a rack, checked firing\ncontrols and charges, and fitted the weapons to\nsuits.\n\nZolan called for a taxi.\n\n ##\n\n\"Lock-sealing the effective range on personal\nweapons is the first order of business for all\nnewcomers.\"\n\nThe officious clerk in the Port Registration Office\nwas skinny, short, stooped and sallow; and he\nsquinted as if he had just emerged from darkness\ninto glare. The deep wrinkles around his mouth\ntwitched from cast-iron grin to scowl and back as\nhe pointed from Brad's holster to the waist-high\ncounter that separated them.\n\nBrad drew his sidearm, checked the safety and\nset it on the counter. His companions followed\nsuit. The clerk hefted each weapon in turn,\ndouble-checked the safety, and positioned it\nunder a penetray scanner to check for illegal\nmodifications and, using a hand-held standard,\nreset the range to Coldfield's limits.\n\n\"Five meters, max,\" he said as he worked, \"and\nminimum-effect level at all times. Set it any way\nyou want when you leave the dome, but reset it as\nsoon as you come back in. We do the first one for\nthe record; after that it's up to you. Penalty for\nviolation depends on circumstances; minimum is\na couple of sleeps in the brig.\"\n\nHe peered at them across the counter.\n\n\"We know who you are and where you came from,\"\nhe said. \"Keep out of trouble and you'll get by OK.\"\n\nAs he finished each weapon inspection he returned\nit to the countertop, pointing the muzzle into\na shielded enclosure and stepped back behind a\nbarrier. The owner picked up the sidearm, rechecked\nthe safety and the setting, and slipped it back into\nits sheath.\n\n\"Hope you were listening when I said we know\nwho you are,\" said the clerk, scowling, looking\nfrom one to the other. \"If you didn't hear me\nthe first time, I'll repeat it: keep out of trouble\nand you'll get by OK. Y'hear?\"\n\nBrad scowled back, silent. Hodak grinned; Myra and\nKumiko nodded and vigorously pointed at themselves.\n\n\"I hate trouble,\" Myra said with solemn sincerity.\n\n\"Me too,\" Kumiko chimed in. \"I hate trouble.\nI really do.\"\n\nAdari laughed, leaned over the counter, and\nrumpled the little man's scant hair. He jerked away.\n\n\"Wouldn't think of it, Buster,\" she boomed.\n\nShe drew her hand back, looked at the palm,\nand rubbed it on her suit as she turned away.\nZolan ignored the scene.\n\nHodak leaned over the counter and waved the clerk\ncloser.\n\n\"So you know where we're from, do you?\" His voice\nwas a friendly growl and he got a curt nod in reply.\n\n\"Then you know we came here for sanctuary,\"\nHodak said. \"How do we get it?\"\n\n\"Your entry permit is provisional; permanent party\nstatus depends on how you adjust to our rules.\"\n\n\"This is the only place left to us,\" Hodak added\na whine to his voice. \"We're not about to start\ntrouble and wear out our welcome.\" Switching to\na hoarse whisper, he added, \"Look, man, we need\na place to put our stuff, and then we want to look\naround. Maybe we can find action in our kind of\nwork that'll build up our credits. We've talked it\nover.\" He thumbed to include his companions.\n\"We're available, and we can't afford to be choosy.\nThe Inner Region doesn't mean a thing to us. Know\nwhat I mean?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nThe clerk repeated his grin-scowl, snickered, and\nslapped Hodak on the shoulder.\n\n\"What's the word on living accommodations under\nthe dome?\" Adari cut in.\n\n\"Gotta register for permanent quarters, and you'll\nneed a permit to build a place of your own. They're\nalmost impossible to get. Try for 'temporary' until\nyou know your way around. Good place to start is\nthe Condor over on Con-man Slash.\"\n\n\"How do we get there?\" Kumiko asked.\n\n\"Taxi to dome air lock 22,\" he replied. \"Inside,\ntake the second transit strip. The off-ramps are\nSmuggler's Alley, Faithhealer's Spread, Plunder\nCove, Bunco Crawl, and then Con-Man Slash.\nIt's in the center of town; you can't miss it.\"\nHe waved them toward the air lock. \"On your way,\nfolks; you're cleared.\"\n\nHe watched them suit up and enter the air lock.\nWhen he heard the whisper of the outer door, he\nlifted a comm device, pressed buttons and spoke\nhurriedly.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter EIGHT\n\n\nClearing the outer door, Zolan leaned against the\nbuffer, tightened his bootstrap with one gloved\nhand, the other pressed against the wall to steady\nhimself. Seconds later, he pulled away, shook his\nleg to settle the boot for comfort, and caught up\nwith Brad.\n\nGrasping Brad's elbow activated the secure to-suit\ncircuit. Myra, Hodak, Adari and Kumiko crowded\nin close and energized a camouflaging mix of\nartificial jive and loud laughs on the nature of\nthe terrain, the location of the Transit Strip, the\ntank town's appearance in the distance, whatever\nserved as a barrier to electronic penetration.\n\n\"The clerk passed the word about us,\" Zolan said.\n\"Gave full descriptions and said to notify someone\ncalled 'Scarf'. By the way, he did a lot more than\ncheck our weapons while we stood at the counter.\nWe were scanned down to our bones. He's sending\nthe file to his control, including the main portal's\nlock combination on the Raven. He'll have a lifter\nready for someone who's to arrive soon. Looks\nlike they're going to search the ship.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Brad nodded. \"Nothing there to cause\nus a problem. Pass the word as we move along.\nNo changes in plans until some contacts develop.\nThen we'll regroup and go on from there.\"\n\nBoarding a robo-taxi that had just discharged\nsuited figures at a nearby mooring tower, the\nSentinels lined up along the taxi's portal. Zolan\nconsulted a placard on the instrument panel and\npunched in the coordinates for Air Lock 22. As\nthe flitter rose and headed toward the dome Brad\nthought back as he weighed their chances.\n\nThe processes of intense physical training and\nweapons drills, the concentrated telepathic loading\nof Plutonian political history and its government's\ndespotic apparatus had been cleared from their\nconsciousness; the substance remained. Nor were\nthey aware of any new or altered neuro-muscular\ncapabilities or functions. They knew they had a job\nto do, and what the job was. They were on their own:\nno mercy from one side, no help from the other.\n\nMore than three-score sleeps had passed since\ntheir choreographed escape; only the events flashed\nthrough his mind; why they happened did not.\n\nThe Raven, on a lengthy umbilical-catwalk, had\nbeen tethered to the Guardian Station, ostensibly\nfor maintenance after a servicing round of\nnearby communications boosters. The ship was\nskeleton-staffed. Brad and his companions had\nbeen secretly transferred beforehand to a cubicle\nadjacent access to the catwalk.\n\nAt Brad's signal, the Sentinels moved quickly.\nHodak, acting as clumsily as he could, slammed\nand locked the passageway safety doors with the\nloudest noises he could generate, broadcasting the\nunusual activity to all within hearing range and for\nelectronic sensor pickup.\n\nThey had lurched and stumbled noisily along the\ncatwalk, Adari suppressing giggles. As the last\nof the six cleared in through the Raven's air\nlock, Hodak had hit \"Emergency,\" on appropriate\nswitches and the ship-to-station servicing lines went\nthrough quick-disconnect. Portals closed and locked.\n\nWithin seconds, Brad was on the bridge and his crew\nat rehearsed departure stations. The caretaker\nofficer and his two aides stepped aside, silent,\nbusinesslike. They were Ram's men.\n\nAdari hit the tether-disconnect. Disengaged, the\ncatwalk coiled in toward the station as the ship\nedged away. Signaling Hodak for minimal repulse and\nacceleration to increase the drift, Brad ordered all\nhands immediately into accelo-nets. He increased\nthrusters to 'low' and, following a moment's pause\ninto 'intermediate'. As soon as he sensed they\ncould handle the acceleration he stepped the thrust\nup to successive levels.\n\nThe old tub creaked, pitched, rolled and yawed;\nlights flickered and dimmed; systems slipped\ninto yellow or borderline red on half a dozen\nindicators, all recorded on the ship's log. The\nRaven all but flapped wings, and true to her\nname, took off. To the hundreds who watched\nfrom the station's portholes, the escape was\nreal. The cover might hold.\n\nThe alarms went out from the Guardian Station to\nSector Space Guard, and from there to a patroller\nconveniently distant.\n\nMessages spunneled throughout the sector and\nto Earth and Luna: \"Escape of dangerous felons,\",\n\"Sabotage of station surveillance system,\",\n\"Station 15 unable to respond in time,\" or\n\"Immediate pursuit and capture essential\" with\nabundant 'Expedites' and 'ASAPs' scattered\nthroughout the text.\n\nThe scenario was exquisite. The word was out,\nand within hours, had spread system-wide.\n\n ##\n\nA couple of million kay out, Ram's men boarded\na well-stocked lifeboat and headed back to a\nprearranged pick-up. The Raven settled into\noutbound, Brad aware of an opportunity to merge\nwith traffic at a not too distant spunnel gate.\n\n ##\n\nBrad brought his mind back to the present as\nthe flitter settled on the landing pad near air lock\n22. Entering the pressure compartment and attaining\natmospheric balance the Sentinels removed their\nsuits and sealed them in wall lockers. The switch\nof weapons and holsters to clips on their inner\ncoveralls completed, they strolled out of the\nstorage room and mingled with a throng of citizen\ncommuters. Moments later they were on a moving\ntransit strip on their way to beautiful downtown\nColdfield.\n\nThe strip cut across and through narrow streets\nand alleys lined with huts fused from the gray\ndetritus of the planet.\n\nOccasionally, a mall or square appeared along the\ntransit route, lined with workshops, playgrounds,\nand colorful private houses or apartment complexes.\nOccasionally, they passed a dwarf tree or a\nflowering shrub in an earth-filled container.\n\nRunning and leaping alongside the moving strip as\nit passed slowly through stations, hawkers waved\nand shouted at the commuters and passers-by,\ninviting them to examine and purchase the novelties\nand artefacts they waved about or in nearby open\nair stalls. From above, lighted globes, strung close\nbeneath the dome, cast a harsh, grotesque glare\nacross the city.\n\nPeople swarmed, and a raucous clamor shrilled along\nthe tightly packed streets and alleys. Men, women\nand children in all shapes and sizes: tall, short,\nstocky, slender, organic, bionic, robotic, and\ncombinations thereof. Hairstyles ranged from\ntotally shaved skulls to elaborate hair-puffs, and\ngarments from dreary, simple shifts to flamboyant,\ncomplex robes that twisted, circled, and knotted\naround their wearers.\n\nThis was Planet Pluto post-secession: a mixture of\nmigrants from across the system. The tank town\ntook them all, for itself or for Slingshot, or both.\nThose who stayed procreated, natural or clone,\naccording to their customs or inclinations. The\neffect was a mixture of breeds whose interactions\nhad brought out a bewildering patchwork of hybrid\ncults, philosophies and arts. Behavior ran the\ngamut; newcomers accepted or were overwhelmed.\n\nKumiko pointed ahead. The Condor loomed,\na sprawling, multi-storied, down-at-the heels\napartment-hotel, its surface colors akin to the\nlow, drab rise on which it stood.\n\nDisembarking the strip, the companions assembled,\nslipped into an alley and entered a portal into the\ncrowded lobby. Joining the laughing, chattering\nthrong, they squeezed their way to the desk robot,\nand registered as a group. Individual identicards\nejected from an aperture, assigning them to a small\napartment with sleeping cubicles off a common room.\nThe communal lavatory and electronic bio-shower\nwere down the hall.\n\nEntering the apartment and tossing their gear into\na corner, they kept up a running chatter. Hodak's\nmain concern was where their next meal was coming\nfrom.\n\n\"Gotta find jobs or we don't eat,\" he barked as he\nhoisted his pack on to a sleep pad and tore at its\nflaps.\n\nKumiko and Adari opened and slammed cabinets,\nchecked housekeeping supplies and \"ooh-ed\" and\n\"ah-ed\" each discovery. Myra and Brad stomped\ninto a sleeping cubicle and heaved the sleeping\npads first one way, then the other.\n\n\"Look in the corners,\" Hodak bawled across the\nnarrow hall, \"that's where the little buggers build\ntheir nests.\"\n\nMyra shrieked and drew her sidearm as Brad stepped\nback. She set the ray-spread to conic and ran the\nbeam from one end of the pad to the other, into\nthe corners and along the walls. They inspected\nthe results, laughed loudly, and went on to the next\ncubicle to repeat their exuberant performance.\n\nZolan strolled from one room to the next,\nsharing the action with his noisy friends,\nmeanwhile scanning the walls, ceiling, floor,\nlighting fixtures, visi-screens and cabinets.\n\nHe rounded toward Brad and brushed against\nhim. His fingers pressed their message. The\nothers, watching, drew the correct conclusion.\n\nThe rooms were bugged, sight and sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter NINE\n\n\nBrad and Hodak pushed into the Charnel Pit,\nColdfield's popular tavern.\n\nThe bar-room was noisy, grimy and crowded.\nIncense streamers slid and coiled along the\nsoil-fused floor, their dissipating pungency\nunable to disguise the acrid stench of sweaty\nbodies and unwashed garments.\n\nThe long bar was hidden by leaners. Narrow aisles\nsnaked among benches and clustered tables around\nwhich boisterous, elbowing humanity teemed.\n\nA coarsely seamed face along the bar turned,\nobserved Brad and Hodak as they glanced around\nfrom inside the doorway. Whispers went down the\nline, jumped to the tables and around the room.\n\nThe tumult ground down as necks craned. A hum\nrose and fell as Brad and Hodak were inspected,\ncommented upon, and judged. It didn't take long\nfor the noise to return to its former level: the\namenities of bar-rooms everywhere.\n\nFrom where he stood, Hodak failed to see a\ntable with a couple of empty chairs. They waited.\nShortly, nudging Brad's arm, he nodded toward\na table newly vacated against a wall.\n\nThey shoved and twisted through the narrow spaces\nto the table in time for Hodak to slam his hand,\npalm down, flat on the tabletop, glaring off a trio\nof competitors.\n\nThey sat, and Hodak pressed the glow-disk in the\ncenter of the table to summon the robo-dispenser.\nMeanwhile, they surveyed the throng.\n\nSome types were recognizable; others would\nneed to be guessed at. Mostly, they were familiar:\nspacefarers and space tug cowboys in tight-fitting\nfoundation suits, construction stiffs in fitted\nhelmets and spacer harnesses, clerks and tradesmen\nin business tunics, and street people in coarsely\nwoven, grimy open-necked shirts and shorts.\nSlingshot technicians' jumpsuits were marked\nby distinctive shoulder patches.\n\nScattered in knots, or leaning against walls and\nsupports, men and women, bare to the waist\nand sporting sheer breechcloths or none at all,\nflaunted their wares.\n\nBrad recognized spoilsmen plying their trades.\nThey were the dandies attired in colorful, skin-tight\nsports suits: thieves, pickpockets, high-tech gear\nrustlers, black marketeers, professional gamblers,\nand experts in all the scams that are or ever were.\n\nHand and shoulder weapons were everywhere: lashed\nto thighs or slung across backs, flat on tables or\nstacked along the bar. Churning and jostling, the\nswarm shifted constantly: singly, in couples and\ngroups; from fledglings newly on the wing to old\ntimers diminished by adversity. Most were in their\nprime: hard of face and body, wary, unbridled and\nself-seeking. They mixed freely.\n\nAt a table further along the wall near to where\nBrad and Hodak sat, Drummer gently swirled the\ncontents of his drinking goblet. He was gaunt, well\npast middle years, with a high-boned countenance.\nHis head was capped by snow-white hair trimmed\nstraight across at his shoulders. Dressed simply,\nDrummer wore a dark cloak over a white, open-necked\nblouse tucked into loose breeches that ended a bit\nbelow his knees. He did not bear a weapon.\n\nDrummer stared about and searched for strangers\nthat might serve his purpose. When he heard that\nthe Raven was at planet-fall, he had called for\nand reread all available newscasts and reports to\nrefresh his recollections of their crimes, personal\nbackgrounds, and escape.\n\nWere they really escaped prisoners? Or were\nthey agents of the UIPS? If they were fugitives\nthey might be suckered into President Narval's\nmercenaries where their spacer skills would help\nfill the gaps. If they were revealed to be UIPS\nagents, they would be quickly disposed of, or\nmanipulated and exploited through false leads\nto Narval's benefit. When no longer useful they\nwould be terminated.\n\nThe newscasts and intelligence summaries on the\nescape were insufficient. Drummer's position as\none of Narval's closest advisors, and his own private\nand secret ambitions, compelled him to learn more\nabout the newcomers. How could they fit into his\nschemes?\n\nDrummer ordered a fresh drink from a passing\nrobo-dispenser. It arrived in a large snifter.\nCradling the rounded bottom in his palm, he swished\nthe gold-hued liquid with a gentle motion, eyes\nmoving from the drink to the crowd to Brad and\nHodak, and randomly round again.\n\nA hard-muscled sledgehammer of a man barged\ninto the Charnel Pit, sullen anger knotting his beefy\nface. His military uniform was skin-tight: a black\ntunic belted over blood-red breeches. The military\nhelmet he wore was also halved black and red as\nwere his holster and the handgrip of the protruding\nweapon. His black cavalier boots were made for\nswaggering. Formidable.\n\nDeep, red-rimmed eyes glared from under the\nhelmet's visor, searching for an open space along\nthe bar. The line was solid.\n\n\"Open ranks,\" he snarled, and leaned heavily into\nthe instant gap.\n\nThe barman rushed forward and raised his hand\nin respectful greeting.\n\n\"Honored to see you, Major Scarf,\" he said,\n\"what'll it be?\"\n\n\"Firehouse Red, and I don't mean the runny slops\nyou peddle to the bar flies.\"\n\nThe barman dashed off and returned with a\nlong-necked flagon and a large tumbler. He poured\na slow-flowing, crimson liquor that bubbled as it\nsettled. The barman set the brimming tumbler\nclose to the Major's massive, thick-fingered hand.\n\nThe Firehouse Red disappeared in a single,\nspasmodic swallow, for all its slow-flowing nature.\nThe barman stood by. The instant the tumbler slammed\ndown, he refilled it, the ritual repeated in silence.\n\n ##\n\nFinally, the sledgehammer hesitated, belched, and,\nwith a satisfied sneer, scratched his crotch. The\nbarman filled the tumbler a third time and turned\naway. Instantly, the flagon was yanked from his\nhand. The barman glanced back at the flagon, Major\nScarf's face, grinned sheepishly, and kept going.\n\nPlacing the flagon alongside on the bar, Scarf\nraised the half-filled tumbler, fondled it, and\ntossed a scornful glance up and down the line. Few\nmet his eyes, and those who did looked elsewhere as\nsoon as he fixed on them. With a snort of contempt\nhe wheeled to face the room. Removing his heavy\nhelmet and lowering it to the ground alongside his\nleg, he leaned back to rest his elbows on the bar's\nedge.\n\nHis eyes scanned the room, sectoring the crowd\nand scrutinizing each person. Taking in the tables\nalong the wall, he paused at Brad and Hodak, and\nscowled at them steadily through half-closed eyes.\n\nBrad and Hodak returned Scarf's gaze with\nexpressions cold and closed. The Major's eyes\nmoved on and fixed on Drummer. His face twisted\ninto a malevolent grin.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter TEN\n\n\n\"Hey, everybody, quiet.\" Scarf's spit-and-phlegm\nbellow tamped the bar-room noise. It ground down.\n\nPointing at the solitary figure seated at the wall\ntable, Scarf smirked and barked, \"Give us the magic\nwords, Drummer.\"\n\nThe crowd's eyes went from Scarf to Drummer and\nback. No one spoke.\n\n\"Drummer knows,\" Scarf added sarcasm to his\ntone, raising his finger to tap his temple. \"The future\nis open to him.\"\n\nDrummer sat, transfixed, staring at Scarf. His free\nhand closed into a tense fist, then opened to cap\nhis knee.\n\n\"C'mon, Drummer,\" Scarf went on, derisively, \"tell\nus what you're going to do to make things right\nfor all of us, and how we'll all be prosperous after\nSlingshot cuts away.\"\n\nHis voice became harsher, gibing.\n\n\"You've been sittin' on that Plutonian Council for\nyears, Drummer, pushing your pet ideas to loosen\nup controls here and give more civil liberties there.\nYou call yourself a Progressive, whatever the\nhell that's supposed to mean. To me, you're a\nrevolutionist, undermining Narval's government,\nand trying to cram your politics down our throats.\"\n\nScarf moved away from the bar, drink in hand.\nTaking a long noisy swallow, he fixed his eyes on\nDrummer from above the rim.\n\nLowering his drink, he belched again and wiped his\nmouth with his sleeve. Placing the tumbler on a\nnearby table he took another step toward Drummer.\n\n\"Being on the Council saves your neck for now,\nDrummer,\" he said with venom. \"Soon as Narval\ngets wise to you, and kicks your tail off, I'll be\ncoming after you.\"\n\nHe reached Drummer's table.\n\n\"On second thought, why wait that long,\" his voice\nchanged to a snarl. \"Now's as good a time as any.\"\n\nHe grasped the front of Drummer's cloak and jerked\nhim to his feet.\n\n\"Tell me, old man, what can you do that Narval\ncan't?\"\n\nThe onlookers' silence hung heavily. The stale\nincense rose in eddies and diffused the shadows\ncast by the glowing wall sconces.\n\n\"Show's over, Scarf,\" said Drummer in a low voice,\ntrying to twist away. \"I've got to be on my way.\"\n\nHe placed his hand over Scarf's huge paw to loosen\nits grip.\n\nThey were of equal height, but Scarf, more than\ntwice Drummer's mass and build, would have none\nof it.\n\n\"The hell you do,\" he growled, tightening his hold.\n\nScarf began to shake Drummer, at first slowly, then\nwith growing violence. Drummer, unable to maintain\nbalance, slipped to his knees. Scarf jerked upward,\nraising Drummer on unsteady feet. Ramming his\nface close, he cursed in a loud, coarse monotone,\nswinging Drummer in one direction, then another.\nUnable to disengage, Drummer was confused. His\ncloak tore, his hair fluttered about his face, and\nspecks of spittle flew from his lips.\n\nBrad and Hodak watched the action from where\nthey sat. Scarf's sudden outburst was of more\nthan passing interest. He had called his victim\n\"Drummer,\" a name familiar to Brad through the\nmany intelligence briefings he had been given during\nindoctrination; also, \"Scarf\" was a name used in\nthe immigration clerk's call from the landing site.\n\nOther than military, who and what was Scarf, and\nwhy was he tormenting Drummer? More important,\ncould this bar-room brawl be exploited to the\nSentinels' advantage? They desperately needed\ncontacts within Narval's regime. Their mission did\nnot allow the luxury of time. An opportunity had\njust fallen into his lap. Brad leaned toward Hodak.\n\n\"The bruiser,\" he said. \"Take him down, but easy.\"\n\nHodak shot a quick glance at Brad, rose and\nshambled between the tables until he was behind\nthe sledgehammer.\n\nTapping Scarf on the shoulder, he said quietly,\n\"Hey, c'mon, let the old geezer alone. He was just\nminding his...\"\n\nScarf reacted with incredible speed for his size.\nShoving Drummer away, he whirled, arm extended.\nPowered by the force of his pivot, the edge of his\nrigid hand aimed directly at Hodak's throat.\n\nHodak stepped back and to the side, gripped Scarf's\nthick wrist in his muscle-corded hands. Using his\nattacker's momentum, Hodak twisted and bent.\nThe Major's huge body catapulted through the air\nand crashed on to a table and its several chairs,\nsending the occupants spinning.\n\nA hand appeared from nowhere and pulled Scarf's\npistol from its holster. In seconds, Brad was back\nat his table. The bar-room went deathly silent.\n\nScarf bounded up, spitting saliva, floor dust and\ncurses. He reached for his weapon and gaped when\nhe felt emptiness.\n\nRecovering, hunched forward, he charged Hodak,\nmurder in his eyes.\n\nFreed, Drummer stepped back to the wall, shaken,\nnot understanding what was happening. He searched\nfor a safe place.\n\nFocusing on the struggle he recognized Hodak as one\nof the escaped prisoners he had been speculating\nabout. Taking a chance, he moved toward the table\nfrom where Brad watched the action and the crowd.\n\nHodak, waiting for Scarf's charge, stood balanced\nuntil the last fraction of a second, then stepped\naside. Scarf passed like a juggernaut and smashed\ninto the bar.\n\nLeaning heavily over the bar, breathing in\nconvulsive gasps, Scarf turned his head to glare at\nHodak. Running his hand down his thigh he felt again\nfor his weapon. Eyes narrowed to slits, he searched\nalong the filth-strewn floor. Scanning, his eyes\npassed the table where Brad sat, stopped, and\nsnapped back.\n\nThe weapon, distinctive by its red and black grip,\nlay there. He saw Brad watching, and Drummer\nnearby, back to the wall.\n\nScarf lunged at Hodak, arms grappling. Hodak danced\nback and away. As Scarf passed, Hodak grasped his\nwrist and elbow, twisted, and curved Scarf's arm\nback and up between his shoulder blades.\n\nHodak was gentle. With his free hand he probed\nand manipulated nerve centers in Scarf's neck and\nshoulders. Scarf dropped to his knees, then slipped\nback on to his rump, legs spread, arms slack, face\nperplexed. It was enough.\n\nHe sat there, shaking his head to clear it. Looking\nup, he saw Hodak standing a short distance away,\nand beyond, a ring of faces, several grinning, others\nfrightened and wary. Shifting his eyes to where his\nweapon lay, Scarf glared at Brad and Drummer.\n\nThe silence was broken by the shuffle of Scarf\ngroping upright, using a nearby table for support.\nHe lurched to the bar and leaned over it for\nseveral seconds. Straightening, he grasped his\nhelmet with one hand, wrapped the other around\nthe flagon of Firehouse Red, and stalked out of\nthe Charnel Pit.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter ELEVEN\n\n\nThe bar-room's heavy vapors seemed to cease\ntheir dreary ballet. An uneasy cackle, strident and\njarring, erupted from a corner, accompanied by\nthe flat slap of a hard hand against the bar's rough\ncounter. The tension dissolved into a ripple of\nraucous laughter. The hubbub resumed, and quickly\nreturned to its former level.\n\nMyra, followed by Zolan, Adari and Kumiko, entered\nthe bar-room, spotted Brad and Hodak, and moved\ntoward them, snatching empty stools along the way.\nPlacing the stools, they encircled the table.\n\nTheir eyes took in Scarf's heavy-duty red-black\nweapon, and then Brad and Hodak, elbows on table,\nscanning the crowd. They saw Drummer nearby\nand noted his disheveled appearance.\n\nThey rose silently, rearranged their seats, and\nsat again, backs against the wall. Kumiko fixed her\neyes on the entryway; Adari scanned in the opposite\ndirection, taking in the bar. Zolan and Myra joined\nBrad and Hodak to observe the roisterers resume\ntheir bar-room habits.\n\nDrummer still showed his embarrassment,\napprehension and rage. His eyes darted from\nthe doorway to Hodak to Brad. Brad turned his\nhead slightly to take him in, then pointed to an\noverturned stool nearby.\n\n\"Pull up and sit a while.\"\n\n\"You in charge?\" Drummer asked.\n\n\"No,\" Brad said, \"we're each on our own. Just\nsocializing.\"\n\nHe motioned at the stool again.\n\n\"C'mon, join us.\"\n\nDrummer looked closely at Brad, then at the others\nwho ignored him. Brad's expression was bland,\nneutral.\n\nDrummer felt certain that Scarf would return soon\nwith reinforcements. He had to get out, fast, and\nhe needed an escort to safety. Beyond that, he\nwanted to know why the squat powerhouse, now\nsitting calmly at the table, had intervened. He\nmust have realized that his interference had been\nmade at great personal risk.\n\nDrummer righted the stool and stared intently at\nHodak as he sat. Hodak, sensing Drummer's scrutiny,\nglanced sideways at him, winked straight-faced, and\nreturned to observe the crowd.\n\nDrummer finally turned to Brad, convinced he was\nthe leader of this pack.\n\n\"We'd better get out of here, now,\" he said,\nhis tone urgent. \"Scarf'll be back as soon as he\ncollects a few of his goons.\"\n\n\"What was it about?\" Brad asked.\n\n\"No time for talk,\" Drummer replied, gesturing\nhis impatience. \"We've got to get away from here,\nand I mean right now.\"\n\n\"Sure, but who is that guy?\"\n\n\"Major Scarf, Chief of Internal Security for\nPresident Narval. He has his own troops, and I\ndon't doubt that he's lining them up right now.\"\nDrummer's fingertips tapped the table in nervous\nstaccato. \"Let's get out of here. Now.\"\n\nBrad stood, and the others rose with him. \"Lead\nthe way,\" he motioned Drummer toward the\ndoorway. \"We're not familiar with the territory.\"\n\n\"Leave that to me,\" said Drummer.\n\nBrad hefted Scarf's weapon, slipped it into 'safe'\nand, passing the bar, handed it to the bartender\nwith a nod that was returned with a respectful wave.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter TWELVE\n\n\nMixing with the street people, Drummer in sight up\nahead, they moved swiftly. Adari trailed Drummer;\nBrad next followed by Myra and Kumiko. Zolan and\nHodak brought up the rear. Drummer successfully\nresisted the temptation to look back.\n\nZolan tensed, activating the mind-mike in his\narmpit. Brad acknowledged by stepping up his pace.\nHe passed Adari and drew alongside Drummer.\n\n\"Your buddy, Scarf, must have had a friend in the\nbar,\" he said. \"We're being tailed.\"\n\n\"Another hundred meters. Cut into the alley on the\nleft.\"\n\nDrummer responded. \"It'll take us through a\nmaze that still confounds the street people. We'll\nhave a better chance in there to lose whoever is\nfollowing.\"\n\nA corner loomed. They squeezed into a narrow,\nrubble-strewn passageway between high, rough\nwalls. Stumbling along the barely lighted shaft\nthey entered an alley, equally shabby, crowded with\nstreet people, refuse, and abandoned machinery.\n\nThey sped along the alley, noting its darkened,\nfuser-formed doorways, some empty, others\nclogged with trash. Inside, they saw the shadowy\noutlines of men, huddled women and children.\n\nDrummer twisted from one alley into the next,\nand then another.\n\nHe ducked through a gap in one wall, squeezed along\na narrow hallway and exited into an open space. They\npacked up close, running and stumbling.\n\nDrummer slowed next to a wall of composite blocks.\nSeveral were missing, leaving a space through\nwhich they squirmed. It was tighter than they had\nexperienced. In near darkness, they had reached\na dead end.\n\nAhead was loose rubble forming a heap about two\nmeters high. Drummer clawed his way around the\nside. He motioned the others forward and slipped\nout of sight.\n\nFollowing one behind the other, they saw an opening\nin the surface. Responding to Drummer's beckoning,\nthey dropped into its darkness. The fall was less\nthan a couple of meters. A light glowed from a wall\nto just enough to illuminate Drummer.\n\nThey were in a small, roughly rounded chamber.\nThe walls were fused rubble, irregular and jagged.\nThe floor was a mixture of Plutonian detritus.\n\nDrummer knelt beside a rock that protruded from\nthe wall. He twisted the rock, pulled, and pushed\nit sideways. Reaching into the vacated space, he\nplaced his palm on a flat, smooth disk.\n\nA low hum from the wall. A fissure formed where\nthe wall met the trash-laden floor. The breach\nlengthened and curved, its ends meeting the wall.\nThe section dropped away into darkness.\n\n\"Move, move,\" Drummer snarled his impatience.\n\"Scarf has this entire sector blocked out by now.\nHe'll throw his gangs into the alleys and cover\nevery square meter. These subsurface crawl spaces\nand links are our only way. Feel for the ladder.\"\n\nHe lowered himself through the opening and vanished.\n\nBrad was committed. His glance ordered the others\nto follow Drummer. Hodak passed his light to Brad\nand dropped through first, then Zolan followed\nMyra, Adari and Kumiko. Brad dropped through\nand pushed the cover up until it snapped. Closed.\nHe felt vibrations above him, then, after several\nseconds, silence.\n\n\"Must be spreading the dust of our tracks and the\noutline of the cover,\" Zolan murmured, looking up\nfrom immediately below.\n\nThe ladder was rickety, and the shaft narrow and\nlong. When Brad reached bottom, he was in a low\ngallery, about two meters square, hacked out of the\nrock. They were in the hub of a dozen passageways\nthat led off in as many directions from low entries.\n\nDrummer bent and disappeared through one of\nthe entries. One after the other, they followed.\n\nThe entry led into a utility service tunnel, the\nwalls lined with scores of braided cables and banks\nof wall switches and junctions. Neutro-lighted\nsconces glowed at intervals, providing dim\ndirection to their flight.\n\nScuttling in single file and dodging cables slung\nbetween supporting columns, they covered distance\nswiftly. Brad moved up behind Drummer, replacing\nHodak who dropped back to rear guard immediately\nbehind Zolan.\n\n\"Scarf knows about these utility passages, and that\nwe would head for them,\" Drummer gasped over his\nshoulder. \"What he doesn't know is which access and\nbranches we took and where we'll surface. A slight\nadvantage, if we act quickly.\"\n\nThey scampered and slithered for more than half\nan hour. \"Looks like we're the only ones down here,\"\nsaid Brad.\n\nDrummer halted to recover breath. The line closed\nup.\n\n\"Normal,\" Drummer gasped. \"These passages were\nabandoned years ago, after we switched to local\ntransmission from control modules suspended\nbeneath the dome. Too much trouble to collapse\nthe subsurface tunnels, I suppose. Also, we had\nto consider the surface effects of a collapse.\nCouldn't afford the chance. As you see, the\nnetwork is still useful.\"\n\nHe shot a quick glance at Brad, then ahead along\ntheir route.\n\n\"Don't get the impression I've got to run from\nScarf,\" Drummer said, heaving another deep breath,\n\"or even to avoid him under ordinary circumstances.\nObviously, he was drunk. My presence in the bar-room\ngave him an opportunity to enhance his image.\nYour companion's intervention, I admit, relieved\nthe pressure, but the method he chose may prove\nunfortunate.\"\n\n\"Why this melodramatic escape?\"\n\n\"To avoid a confrontation in which Scarf, backed\nup by his troops, would be in complete control; a\nconfrontation in which you couldn't possibly hold\nyour own. The encounter has already caused\nme embarrassment. I don't relish a repetition.\"\nDrummer paused. \"And there's another reason.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"I know who you are, and the circumstances that\nbrought you and your associates to Planet Pluto.\nI want to know more.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"My answer to that depends on what I learn about\nyou and your companions.\"\n\nDrummer slowed to a fast walk, searching spaces\nbetween the bundles of the thick cables.\n\n\"So that you know,\" he said, \"we're heading for my\nvilla-dome about five kay from the city.\"\n\nDrummer grunted that he'd found what he had\nsearched for. Clawing under a flap, he uncovered\na depression in the wall alongside a cable junction.\nHe pressed himself in behind the junction and\ninto a cranny, motioning to Brad. One by one, they\nsqueezed through, and found themselves at the foot\nof a flex-ladder. Drummer climbed; they followed.\n\nThey emerged through a manhole into a kiosk next\nto a transit strip. Darting from the kiosk Drummer\nboarded the strip and nodded back to Brad to join\nhim. Within moments they were all gliding toward\nan air lock leading to the outside.\n\nEntering the air lock, they hurried into space\nsuits from the public service rack, checked each\nother's seals and oxygen reserves, tested the\ncommunications and pressurization systems and\ncrowded into the pressure-equalization chamber. Air\nlock and suit pressures up, balanced and checked,\nDrummer jerked a lever and, a moment later, they\nducked under the rising panel to the outside.\n\nRunning along the ramp Drummer flashed his suit\nlamps at a parked robo-taxi. The signal activated\nthe craft and it was in ready status when they\nreached it. Boarding first, Drummer keyed in\ncoordinates. As the last Sentinel scrambled through\nthe hatch he hit the lift button. The taxi rose and\ncurved away.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter THIRTEEN\n\n\nThe black skies and drab mounds of Planet Pluto\nwere spotted with color. From where he stood on\nDrummer's enclosed patio, Brad looked through\nthe transparent shields at ice-gray Charon low\nover scarred ridges to the west. Shifting his\neyes slightly brought into focus the panorama of\nColdfield's dome and its multi-colored lights. The\norange-green cylinder of the Slingshot Logistics\nDepot gleamed in the black sky.\n\nThe Fandango force field around the depot\nshimmered. A wide gap separated the transports\nloading and unloading at the portals inside the\nforce field from those outside waiting in line\nor in clustered formations until moorings inside\nbecame available.\n\nThe short taxi ride from Coldfield had been\nuneventful. The formalities of introductions behind\nthem, the host and his guests had refreshed\nthemselves, dined and rested.\n\nDrummer joined Brad and followed his gaze to the\norange-green cylinder and its gaggle of transports\nand tugs. The silence was brief.\n\nDrummer said, \"I've had your ship searched.\"\n\nBrad shrugged, eyes scanning the scene outside, and\nreplied dryly, \"Hope it was worth your while. To us,\nit was transportation. Any old tub would have done.\nAs it turned out, we were lucky.\"\n\n\"I'll accept that it's an 'old tub'. I gathered as\nmuch from the reports I received,\" Drummer said,\n\"but I understand the primary systems are in good\ncondition, considering the vessel's history and the\nspunnel shocks the ship must have experienced on\nthe way. How does it all fit together?\"\n\n\"How does it concern you?\" Brad turned to face\nDrummer.\n\n\"Come, now.\" Drummer shook his head impatiently.\n\"Let's not act naive; it doesn't go with the rest\nof you. But,\" he added waving his finger at Brad\nas he turned away, \"just so you don't make a habit\nof responding to my questions with diversions, be\naware that I am a member of President Narval's\nCouncil of Advisors. Despite the incident with\nScarf, I have considerable authority and resources\nat my command.\n\n\"I've checked through my confidential sources in\nthe Inner Region,\" he went on, \"and confirmed you\nare all convicted criminals that escaped from a\nGuardian Station prison. Now, for starters, how\ndid you manage to get a lift by spunnel and make it\nthis far without tearing that old wreck apart? Those\nvessels don't have navigational gear for trips to\nthe rim, nor do they carry the required gear and\nsupplies. Straight answer.\"\n\n\"We're spacers,\" Brad said. \"One of us is an\nexperienced maintenance engineer. Another is\na space navigator. We've all knocked about the\nspace-ways a bit on assorted jobs. I was Captain of\na freighter before the Space Guard and the Transport\nBoard took my ship away from me on trumped up\ncharges, and then sent me up for five years of\nrehab. We teamed up on the Guardian Station, worked\nout the details, kept our noses clean and our eyes\nopen, and, when the chance came, grabbed it. We did\nhave a few breakdowns, but we kept her moving along\nuntil we could attach the ship to a convoy through\nthe spunnel. We took our chances and made it.\"\n\nDrummer shook his head. A muscle twitched in his\njaw.\n\n\"The reports I received identified your former\nprofessions and gave me the rest of your personal\nhistories. Frankly, it has me wondering: a ship's\ncaptain, paramedic-logistics type, a maintenance\nengineer, communications specialist, navigator, and\na weapons technician. Wasn't it odd to have these\nspecial skills fall into place?\"\n\n\"Not really,\" Brad countered. \"I could have made up\nany kind of crew I wanted. The station has lots of\nspacers under lock and key. These folks happened\nto fit in with my plans, and they were as anxious\nto get out as I was. It worked. Now, what's the\nproblem?\"\n\n\"The problem,\" Drummer replied, \"is that a\nhalf-dozen escaped convicts with exceptional space\nskills make it to Planet Pluto; that one of them\ndefends a high level official in a tavern brawl,\nmaking for himself a mortal enemy of their\nsanctuary's chief security officer. To cap it, the\nescaped convicts are now guests in the home of the\nofficial that they defended in the bar-room scrape\nwho, I might add, also happens to be a member of\nthe President's Council. See the problem?\"\n\n\"Crank this in,\" Brad remarked, \"the citizen, who\nconsiders himself a high government official,\nmoves about without a bodyguard thus inviting\nconfrontations. Also, his attacker's arrival at the\nbar-room couldn't possibly have been predicted, let\nalone his drunken behavior and my colleague and I\nhappening to be there. Add who it was that took the\ninitiative for departure from the tavern, and that\nit was the high government official that invited\nthe escaped convicts to his home. He wasn't\nthreatened or coerced into extending his\nhospitality.\"\n\nDrummer grinned, nodded. \"You ordered Hodak\nto intervene. Why?\"\n\n\"First, tell me more about Scarf.\"\n\nDrummer shrugged.\n\n\"He's been with Narval since the beginning of the\nregime. Did, and still does, most of the dirty work\nthat keeps any government in power, and he's\nbetter at it than most. He has a special hatred\nfor dissidents to Narval's policies and uses\nspies, informers and killers to infiltrate their\norganizations and tear them apart. By the way,\nhe also had your ship searched. Watch out for\nhim. Now, my question.\"\n\n\"When Scarf began to hassle you, I had no idea of\nhis identity or position. His words and actions in\nthe bar-room gave me an impression that, if we\ngot you out of that mess, you might reciprocate\nby helping us to get permission to remain on\nthe planet, and maybe steer us to jobs. It was\na chance. Now, as to your problem with us:\nis it insurmountable?\"\n\nDrummer studied Brad's face, trying to read his\nthoughts. \"Not really, insofar as getting you and\nyour friends temporary resident status,\" he said.\n\"Scarf will not be easy with you and your friends,\nespecially my rescuer, Hodak. I'll talk to my\nassociates. The skills you have might be useful\nto us. Since you're a former ship's captain, I'll\nconsider you spokesman for your colleagues.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter FOURTEEN\n\n\nPresident Narval invited all INOR ambassadors to\nmeet with him in his conference suite; the subject\nwas not announced in advance. The ambassadors\nsought guidance from their home governments. In\nresponse, they were instructed to attend, make no\ncommitments, and report back immediately on the\nproceedings.\n\nAs the appointed time neared, the Presidential\nSecurity Guard, augmented by a detachment of\nheavily armed police, moved into the conference\narea. They took up positions at doors leading\nfrom the President's Suite, along the connecting\ncorridors, and inside the Conference Room. All\nrooms, corridors and exterior approaches leading to\nthe meeting site were physically and electronically\nsearched, and the identity disks of all individuals\npassing through the area scrutinized and verified.\n\nShortly before the meeting, the President's Council\nentered and took seats along the wall, leaving the\nchairs around the table for the guests. A lackey\nscampered about, lifted the lids of beakers, peered\nin, made minute changes in the alignment of goblets,\nand scuttled out.\n\nA view tank rose from a well at the front of the\nroom, glowed, and cleared to show the Special\nZone. Charon and its background of stars had been\ndimmed to reduce the clutter. In the foreground,\nthe Slingshot Logistics Depot and its maze of ships,\ntugs, articulated cranes and flex-conveyers were\nportrayed busily engaged in loading and unloading\nthe moored vessels, and the new arrivals that\nwaited for their turn.\n\nA flurry rippled through the room as a door panel\nslid back into its slot and the Ambassadors strode\nin from an anteroom. They were men and women\nof varying appearance: tall and short, slender\nand rotund, and cadaverous and fleshy. More than\nhalf wore the military uniforms and ranks of their\nnation, and the rest were in the colorful robes of\ntheir offices and governments.\n\nMostly in their middle years, they had the hard,\narrogant look of ruthless power, survivors of craft\nand intrigue. Faces suspicious and wary, they took\nplaces around the table. None spoke.\n\nA brusque announcement cut the silence. \"The\nPresident of Planet Pluto.\"\n\nPresident Narval, haughty in appearance and adorned\nin red-black robes of office, entered to the sound\nof sliding chairs and rustling garments as all\npresent rose to their feet. Narval's massive\nbody, pear-shaped and tapering into short legs and\ndiminutive feet, shuffled forward in top-heavy gait.\n\nDrummer entered behind Narval and moved to stand\nsilently beside a lectern adjacent the view tank.\n\nSunken between ponderous shoulders, Narval's\nhairless head was small and neckless, his face\nsmooth-pale with thin-lipped mouth and a stumpy\nnose. Cold, deep-embedded eyes constantly shifted\nfocus and direction. His small hands, fingers laden\nwith rings, appeared to drip from his sleeves.\n\n ##\n\nLumbering to his raised chair at the head of\nthe table, Narval laboriously stepped up and\nsat, lifted his hand to his mouth and nibbled at\na fingernail. Finally, satisfied, he held the finger\nup, examined it and redirected his attention to\nhis audience.\n\nPresident Reen Narval had earned the fear and\nrespect that he enjoyed. A victor of scores\nof battles for control of the planet's criminal\nsyndicates and political machinery, Narval had left\na trail of blood and broken bones behind him as a\nwarning to challengers. Challengers to his rule did\nnot survive.\n\nA man of many talents, Narval had migrated to\nPlanet Pluto from an independent colony orbiting\nCallisto. He had accepted expulsion from the\nplace of his birth as the alternative to the court's\nsentence of labor in Callisto's encapsulated\nsubsurface mines.\n\nEducated and trained to practice law in the Outer\nRegion's inter-satellite and interplanetary courts\nhe had, instead, become a serious liability to his\ngovernment and to his community.\n\nAt his disbarment, the investigating officer of\nthe Callisto Ethical Practices Board had presented\nirrefutable evidence of Narval's numerous conflicts\nof interests, extortions, frauds and other crimes\nin the performance of his responsibilities as an\nofficer-of-the-court. Removed from the judicial\narena, he was proven to have also cheated in the\nCallisto gambling halls, swindled citizens of sound\nrepute, and twice convicted of murder.\n\nCallisto and its orbiting colonies were wide open,\nbut Reen Narval was too much for them. He was\ntold to quickly depart Callisto's jurisdiction or\ntake the consequences.\n\nHe left gracelessly, found a haven on Planet Pluto,\nand applied his many talents with vigor. Organizing\nColdfield's fragmented criminal elements, he ruled\nwith an iron fist. Solidly entrenched, he imposed\ntactics of terror on the population and encountered\nlittle resistance. He rose to the top, balanced on\na mound of cracked skulls and crushed bodies.\n\nSoon after INOR came into being, Narval proclaimed\nPlanet Pluto's independence, with himself as\nPresident. Despite the UIPS urgent need for Planet\nPluto to support Slingshot, the newly formed,\nbut weakened government of the Inner Region\nwas unable to influence a populace under the fist\nof a ruthless despot.\n\n\"I will govern well, and we shall prosper,\"\nPresident Narval glibly promised the Plutonian\ncitizenry. \"I have studied and practiced\ninterplanetary law for many years. I shall demand\njustice for our planet and for all our people. We\nwill not be slaves to the imperialists of the Inner\nRegion.\"\n\nThe new President organized a brotherhood with like\nmorals, and bestowed on them ministries of great\npersonal influence and profit. A bureaucracy rose\nand flourished; the spoils systems and corruption\nmatched those of ancient Earth.\n\nReen Narval, President of Planet Pluto, was caught\nin a dilemma.\n\nSlingshot construction was approaching completion.\nThe Terminals and Planet Pluto would come to a\nparting of the ways before the end of the century.\nEmployment and extortionate profits from Slingshot\nservices and industries would plummet as Planet\nPluto continued outbound along its eccentric orbit\ninto interstellar space. The economy would wither,\nand the inhabitants move elsewhere.\n\nNarval had to provide for himself. For the moment,\nhe held a good hand, and the stakes made the game\nworthwhile, providing it was himself that shuffled\nthe deck and dealt the cards.\n\nLeaning back in his chair, Narval scanned the faces\nat the table.\n\n\"I have dispatched a message to the President\nof the United Inner Planetary System,\" he\nannounced solemnly. \"It will open a new and better\nrelationship between INOR and the UIPS.\"\n\nThe Ambassadors stared at him, aghast. Several\nrose partially out of their seats, looked at others\nat the table, reconsidered, sat, and glared grimly\nstraight ahead rather than toward the head of the\ntable. Narval smirked. A bombshell, indeed.\n\n\"Until now we have played children's games with the\nUIPS,\" he continued, raising his voice to the level\nand tone of a despot's traditional bellow to repel\nan imagined enemy. \"That time is past. We must\nmove on to a strategy that is more aggressive\nthan petty raids on UIPS shipping or to merely\ndestroy a few of their insignificant patrols.\n\n\"The build-up of INOR's military forces has\nreached the level at which, together, we have the\nstrength to influence the final stages of Slingshot\nconstruction. That includes the launch schedule of\nthe Extractor station to Alpha Centauri. We must\nuse this new power to benefit all nations in the\nOuter Region. In short, the warships and weapons\nin Planet Pluto's military fleet, along with those of\nyour governments, are a force that the UIPS can\nnot ignore.\"\n\nNarval motioned to Drummer.\n\n\"The Proclamation.\"\n\nBringing his hand close, he inspected its palm and\nfingers.\n\nSelecting a fingernail, he commenced nibbling at\nit, giving the task his full attention.\n\nDrummer rose to his feet, drew a scrolled\ndocument from the sleeve of his robe and unrolled\nit. Holding the scroll low so that his listeners\ncould see his face, he read from the scroll without\nhesitation or inflection.\n\n\"The President of Planet Pluto sends greetings to\nthe President of the United Inner Planetary System\nand to all citizens of the Inner Region.\n\n\"I, President Reen Narval, hereby declare and\nproclaim that Planet Pluto, as an independent and\nproperly constituted member of the Independent\nNations of the Outer Region (INOR), has the legal\nand inalienable right to use and to defend INOR\nterritory under my jurisdiction consistent with\ntime-honored custom and interplanetary law.\n\n\"The Government of Planet Pluto, now and\nhenceforth, assumes for itself as lawful all\ndominant rights of independent nations to possess\nand control all territory, properties, materials,\nsupplies and all other resources on and beneath\nthe surface of Planet Pluto. Such rights extend\noff-planet to national boundaries established in\nconformance with treaties in effect for delineating\nplanetary and satellite jurisdictions in near and\ncontiguous space.\n\n\"Through this Proclamation, we, the Government\nof Planet Pluto, exercise our rights and impose\nour legitimate authority.\n\n\"On the other hand, we are realists. It is not\npossible for us, at this stage of Plutonian\nnational and industrial development, to assume the\noperation and servicing of vital life and community\nsupport systems, nor has the Planet Pluto Government\nthe technical skills and facilities at this time to\nproduce and deliver infrastructure and commodities\nessential for a self-sustaining economy.\"\n\nDrummer raised his eyes and quickly scanned the\nINOR ambassadors seated along each side of the\nconference table. His voice raised slightly for\nemphasis.\n\n\"We, therefore,\" he intoned, \"conditionally grant\nto the Government of the United Inner Planetary\nSystem license to install, operate, and service all\nlife and general infrastructure support systems\nin Coldfield, and in all posts, camps and stations\non the surface of Planet Pluto, its satellite Charon\nand throughout its contiguous space.\n\n\"We are, furthermore, gracious hosts. We herewith\ngrant conditional permission for all spaceports,\nlanding pads and mooring towers, and their\nassociated technical accoutrements and equipment,\nto remain open to UIPS traffic. This conditional\npermission is granted providing qualified UIPS\ntechnicians and administrators under the oversight\nof Plutonian citizens staff these facilities. The\nPlutonian overseers will be afforded training by\nthe UIPS to qualify them to assume the primary's\noperational and management responsibilities in all\nfunctions within two Earth years from the date of\nthis Proclamation. The Government of Planet Pluto,\nas sovereign, will provide for station security and\nwill exercise oversight and offer guidance through\nits appointed administrators.\n\n\"The Government of Planet Pluto hereby levies\nan inventory tax on all materials and products\narriving in Plutonian territories from the UIPS.\nThe tax base includes all raw materials, partial\nand fully fabricated structures, technical\nequipment, and components thereof which are or\nyet to be committed to Slingshot. The Slingshot\nLogistics Depot, which occupies space within\nPlutonian jurisdiction, and all UIPS cargo\ntransports entering Plutonian space, are subject\nto this inventory tax.\n\n\"Our inventory tax is merely an extension of\nthe passage tax on ships intruding on INOR's\njurisdictions and which is currently being\nnegotiated by the UIPS and INOR governments.\nWe anticipate the successful completion to\nthese negotiations.\n\n\"This Decree is in effect. Your cooperation is\nwelcomed.\"\n\n ##\n\nDrummer released the lower end of the scroll\nand watched it curl up. He finished rolling the\ndocument, bound it with a ribbon, and tucked it\ninto his sleeve. He stood silent, eyes on Narval.\n\nNarval rose as he spoke slowly, his tone\ndisdainful. \"I suggest that you communicate with\nyour Governments concerning my message to\nPresident Camari. Add my expression of trust\nthat they appreciate the advantages of presenting\na common front.\"\n\nWaddling toward the door, he beckoned Drummer\nto follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter FIFTEEN\n\n\nNarval slouched back into his overstuffed chair.\nDrummer faced him from across the enormous\nebony-composite desk.\n\nBringing his hand close, Narval searched for a\nfingernail that demanded his attention.\n\n\"President Camari must accept that we have the\nmilitary forces to impose our will on Slingshot,\"\nhe said, momentarily shifting his eyes to Drummer.\n\"If he does not accept my offer I want to ram it\ndown his throat. Have you come up with an action\nto implement our new policy?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"Lay it out.\"\n\n\"With no advance notice, impose the inventory tax\non all Slingshot supplies on board the Depot and\non UIPS vessels on both sides of the Fandango\nforce field. The first step is to conduct our own\ninventory of UIPS property in Plutonian space; to\ndo that we must have on site access to the Depot's\nrecords, and spot check the records against the\nassets. The presence of our military forces in\nspace close to the Depot will back up our inventory\nstaff. Businesslike, formal, and highly visible.\"\n\n\"Why don't you use that tactic on the dozens of\nSlingshot laboratories and assembly centers here\non Pluto's surface? Seems to me that would be\nless risky.\"\n\n\"For good reasons, Mr. President. We need\nan exercise that is sufficiently visible, even\nspectacular, to make both the UIPS and our\nINOR allies respect our will and capabilities to\nuse organized military forces throughout our\nlegitimate jurisdiction. A surface operation on\nPluto will be barely noticed and not impress them\nwith our military strength.\"\n\n\"How do you expect the Depot to react?\"\n\n\"At first, with confusion. The Depot Commander\nwill try to bluff. Meanwhile, he'll spunnel an alarm\nto Earth and insist on guidance. We must not\naccept delay.\"\n\n\"What if you meet resistance?\"\n\n\"Overcome it. Set an example. After all, we are\nexercising our rights as a sovereign nation.\"\n\n\"And after the inventory?\"\n\n\"If peacefully accomplished, we withdraw. We'll\nspunnel formal documentation to the UIPS on the\namount of taxes due, the schedule for payment\nand penalties for delinquencies.\"\n\n\"The penalties?\"\n\n\"I have several in mind. Fines for minor delays,\nblockade of the depot and, eventually, military\naction should they get nasty.\"\n\n\"How soon can you launch?\"\n\n\"Three days.\"\n\n\"Do it.\"\n\nDrummer turned to leave. Narval raised his jeweled\nhand. Drummer paused and turned back.\n\n\"What's this I've heard from Scarf about you taking\na pack of escaped Inner Region convicts under your\nwing?\"\n\n\"There's more to it than that,\" replied Drummer.\nHe filled in the gaps.\n\nNarval scrutinized his fingernails as Drummer\ntalked.\n\n\"I'm surprised to hear you patronize drinking\nestablishments where such raffish elements gather,\"\nNarval murmured around the focus of his attention.\n\n\"I feel it my duty to get about, to see, and to\nlisten. There is much to learn by observing our\npeople going about their daily lives. The Charnel\nPit is one of the few places in Coldfield where\npeople gather to relax and talk.\"\n\nNarval peered sideways at Drummer from narrowed\neyes.\n\n\"Hm, you see and you listen to the people. What\nelse, I wonder? Do the people also see and listen\nto you? What do you tell them, Drummer?\"\n\n\"I tell them nothing, President Narval. I don't\nknow what you mean.\"\n\n\"Well, let it go for now. Back to your little\nbrood. You say they're experienced spacers, and\nyou've checked the facts of their escape. You\nknow we're short-handed in technicians for the\nmilitary fleet. Can we use them?\"\n\n\"I'm not certain that I trust them,\" Drummer\nresponded.\n\n\"Test them.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Take them along on the inventory operation.\"\n\n\"...and?\"\n\n\"As I say, test them. Force whoever is leading them\ninto a difficult situation. Keep him close to you\nand watch how he works himself out of it. If he\ndoes well, throw him to another pack of wolves. Get\nhim and his gang involved, deeper. Make them prove\nthemselves. When you're satisfied, bring them up\nto a level where we're squeezing from them all\nthey have that's useful to us.\"\n\n\"Scarf is after them.\"\n\n\"Leave Scarf to me, Drummer. That's all.\"\n\n ##\n\nScarf entered and waited for Narval to notice him.\nNarval's eyes were fixed on his hands. He spoke\nwithout looking up.\n\n\"Drummer has given me his side of the incident\nin the bar-room,\" he said, his voice cutting with\nsarcasm. \"The hangers-on in that sinkhole have,\nby now, spread their version all over Coldfield,\nLamplight, as well as the depot and Slingshot.\nYou came out of it looking like a fool in a\nconfrontation that enhances Drummer's image to\nthe detriment of the President's Chief of Security.\"\n\nNarval raised his head. His small eyes drilled into\nScarf.\n\n\"I don't trust Drummer,\" he said. \"I suspect him\nof trying to subvert my rule. He's too popular in\nthe Council and among the officers and men of\nthe military fleet. I can't chance direct action\nagainst him at this time. For the moment, I need\nhis expertise in military strategy and managing\nour resources.\n\n\"I'm looking to you to find or create enough\nevidence so that, when I'm ready, we can undermine\nDrummer's reputation. As it is, you've built him up\nby embarrassing your high position in my government.\nDo your job right, and my problem with Drummer\nwill fade away. I'm not pleased at all with your\nprogress so far.\"\n\nScarf's face was flushed.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said. \"My intent was to accost\nDrummer in a public place, draw him out, and make\nhim look foolish. The circumstances in the Charnel\nPit were fine, or so I thought. Intervention by an\noutsider was totally unexpected. When I get my\nhands on that convict, I have plans for him.\"\n\n\"Hold off, Scarf. You can have him when I'm done\nwith the pack, including Drummer. Until then, put\nyour anger aside.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Now, listen carefully.\"\n\nNarval leaned forward, eyes on Scarf. He described\nDrummer's upcoming inventory operation. Stubby\nfingers smoothed the desk surface.\n\n\"I'll tell Drummer that I want you to go along\non the inventory,\" he said. \"Think up a reason;\nI don't care what it is so long as it gets you\naboard. The real reason is to keep your eyes on\nDrummer, the operation, and these convicts he's\nharboring. I want to know everything that happens.\nDo you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I do.\" Scarf's eyes lit up. He continued\neagerly. \"If Drummer goes to the depot or boards\nUIPS ships, I should go along to see what he does.\nAs Chief of Security, my position should compel him\nto accompany him. I suggest, sir, that you appoint\nme as your counter-intelligence representative\non Drummer's task force. My job, then, would be\nto check if the depot or a transport, whichever\nwe board, is conducting secret surveillance of\nour military facilities, field training, and ship\nmovements. Drummer can be told that my boarding\nthe depot would be essential to the mission you've\nassigned to me.\"\n\n\"Hasn't our man on the depot told us they've been\nperforming those observations for the UIPS for\nquite a while? Wouldn't Drummer see through that\nploy?\"\n\n\"Not if you tell him this would be the first\nopportunity for your Chief of Security to enter\na UIPS domain and report to you directly on his\nobservations. It would take me out from under\nDrummer's command.\"\n\n\"Hm, yes, I see what you mean.\" Narval returned\nto examining his fingernails. He lifted a finger to\nhis lips and nibbled.\n\n\"Very well, Scarf. I'll tell Drummer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter SIXTEEN\n\n\nDrummer paced the command deck of the Plutonian\nflagship Dragon, Brad nearby. Scarf, sprawled in\nan open accello-net fastened to a nearby bulkhead,\nwatched and listened.\n\nThe ship vibrated as it moved along the launch rail\nleading to the mouth of the tunnel hanger. Captain\nHyk, the ship's Commander, hunched over a control\ncomputer on the nearby bridge and snapped orders\nto his Operations Officer. Both cast sideways glances\nat Scarf, discomfited by his presence.\n\nBrad visualized the scene on the bridges and flight\ndecks of the more than two dozen warships, ranging\nfrom cruisers to fighters that formed the task\nforce. All were in final countdown for launch from\ntunnels and galleries cut into reinforced chasms\nacross a hundred kay of Pluto's surface.\n\nAt Drummer's invitation, Brad analyzed the launch\nschedule and deployment pattern. He had tactfully\nsuggested substantive alterations to minimize\nwarning time to the depot and its nearby\ntransports. After some debate, during which\nBrad repeatedly justified his proposals to skeptical\nship commanders, they were computer-tested,\nmodified and accepted.\n\nBrad knew he was on trial. Ram's words surfaced\nas he scanned the bridge: \"...you will lie, cheat,\nbribe, subvert, sabotage, and kill for us, and\nshould our greater purpose call for you to do so,\nagainst us.\"\n\n\"This one,\" he mused, ironically, \"is on the\n'against us' side of the ledger.\"\n\nHodak appeared at the entry to the command deck\nand beckoned to Brad. As Brad approached, Scarf rose\nand sauntered in their direction, seemingly scrutinizing\ninstrument dials and panels along the way. His ears\nseemed to throb with the effort of eavesdropping.\n\n\"I've gone over the maintenance and operations\nchecklists for all ships and technical support\ncommitted to this mission, as you told me to,\"\nHodak said, \"and then spot-checked them against\ninstalled equipment. We've only been on this\njob a couple of days, so I couldn't probe to any\nmeaningful depth.\"\n\nHe heaved a deep sigh. \"From what I've seen so far,\nBrad, the systems are not as well-maintained as they\nshould be, and much of the data and crew training\nare not applicable or out of date.\n\n\"My recommendation is that as soon as we get back\nwe conduct a hard-nosed professional inspection\nof the fleet to pinpoint all the cats-and-dogs these\ndunderheads have jerry-rigged into the equipment\nand the software. We gotta give priority to the\nchecklists that need to be updated to correspond\nwith installed equipment. No two ships have the\nsame configuration, so each checklist will have\nto be tailored. That's only the first step, and it'll\nbe one helluva lotta work.\"\n\n\"Drummer's main concern right now is getting\nthrough this operation without using weapons\nor incurring a technical breakdown,\" Brad said.\n\"Either one will detract from the image we're\ntrying to build. He should know ASAP what you\nfound. I'll pass it along to him. Stand by with\nKumiko in case Drummer needs some technical\nadvice on weapons or engineering.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nHodak turned to leave, and his eyes met Scarf's.\nHodak grinned, and gave Scarf a thumbs up. Scarf\nglowered and turned away, moving back to the net.\nHodak disappeared down the passageway.\n\nThe ship advanced along a rail into a gallery at\nthe mouth of the tunnel. Captain Hyk turned\nto Drummer.\n\n\"The Dragon is at launch station,\" he said.\n\nDrummer and Brad stepped from the command deck\nto a small balcony overlooking a shallow pit covered\nby a pale, translucent screen. A network of lines,\nrepresenting tunnels and galleries, formed on the\nscreen, each incorporating a tiny, yellow moving\nand blinking light to indicate a warship under\nDrummer's command. As each light reached launch\nposition, it halted and changed from yellow to\ngreen. Drummer and Brad watched the last of\nthe yellows convert. All green, ready to launch.\n\nDrummer picked up a microphone, Brad beside him.\n\n\"This is Drummer,\" he said. \"Operation\nauthenticator Tornado Six. Execute. First wave.\nLaunch.\"\n\nFive green lights flashed to red and disappeared,\non their way to predesignated stations outside\nFandango: one off each blunt end of the Depot\ncylinder and the remainder at the entry to the\ngateway force field.\n\nTen seconds later Drummer repeated his codes and\nlaunched the second wave. The corresponding lights\non the screen flashed red and out. New green lights\nappeared in their place, this time moving in arcs\nconverging on the cylinder centered in a sphere:\nthe depot in its force field cocoon.\n\nThe converging lines massed, reformed, and spread\ninto a pattern resembling the spoke tips of an open\numbrella, with the Gateway, the crowded transports\nand the depot centered at what would be the\numbrella's handgrip.\n\n ##\n\nDrummer turned his head and looked at Brad.\n\n\"Went off rather well,\" he said.\n\n\"Seems so. That was the easy part. I don't envy\nyou the next.\"\n\nDrummer touched a switch connecting him to the\nbridge.\n\n\"Captain,\" he said. \"Launch the Dragon. Take your\nposition at the coordinates I gave to you. Activate\nour comm system to the depot.\"\n\nThe ship shuddered as it shot from the gallery and\nheaded for the concentration of spacecraft above\nPluto. It slowed as it passed through the umbrella\nformation and stopped fifty kay from the nearest\ntransport.\n\nTime lapse from launch was less than two minutes.\nSurprise was complete; the effect, paralyzing.\n\nAll movement around the depot slowed to a halt.\nThe intranet filled with \"What the hell's going on?\",\n\"Who are these guys?\", and \"Bring on the dancing\ngirls.\" Then, suddenly, the channels blanked,\nreplaced by silence.\n\nDrummer keyed his microphone open and handed it\nto Brad.\n\nBrad took on a harsh tone.\n\n\"Attention: Commander of Slingshot Logistics Depot\nand Masters of all vessels, inside or outside the\nFandango Force Field. The national interests of the\nGovernment of Planet Pluto demands compliance\nwith Plutonian laws by all persons and properties\nwithin its jurisdiction. You and your vessels and\nthe Logistics Depot are in Plutonian territory,\ntherefore, our laws apply to you.\n\n\"The Fleet Commander of this Plutonian Security\nForce wishes to speak with the Commander of the\nSlingshot Logistics Depot. Depot Commander, please\nidentify yourself and stand by. Acknowledge.\"\n\nSilence. Thirty seconds.\n\n\"Logistics Depot. This is the Plutonian Security\nForce. The message we sent you moments ago was for\nthe Depot Commander. Did you read? Acknowledge.\"\n\nThe reply came.\n\n\"Your message received. Please identify Fleet\nCommander.\"\n\nBrad and Drummer exchanged glances. Drummer\nchuckled.\n\n\"The formalities must be observed,\" he chuckled,\nhis tone dry. \"Tell him.\"\n\nBrad keyed the mike.\n\n\"Fleet Commander Deke Drummer.\" He put a rasp\ninto his voice. \"Now, get on with it.\"\n\nAnother voice came on.\n\n\"Colonel Hanno here. I'm the Depot Commander.\nWhat the hell game are you playing, Drummer?\"\n\nBrad's tone turned icy.\n\n\"Let's get one point straight, Colonel Hanno. You\nwill be speaking with a Fleet Commander with the\nrank of Admiral. Should you need to be reminded,\nPlanet Pluto is a sovereign and independent nation,\nand you are a guest within our borders. Your choice\nof words is offensive. Do you read?\"\n\nA long pause.\n\n\"I read.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter SEVENTEEN\n\n\nDrummer reached for the mike.\n\n\"Colonel Hanno, this is Admiral Drummer.\" He winked\nat Brad.\n\n\"Colonel, my Government requires an inventory\nof Slingshot properties, materials and supplies\nin your depot and on the transports nearby. The\ninformation we develop from this one-time inventory\nwill be used to compute UIPS taxes while the\ndepot and transports are in Plutonian jurisdiction.\nMy fleet is escorting the inventory specialists.\nPlease arrange for them to board your Depot and\nthe transports on both sides of your force field,\nso that they can get to their work.\"\n\n\"I have not received instructions from my\nGovernment concerning the inventory or the taxes\nto which you refer.\"\n\n\"That is between you and your Government. I am\nhere at the express order of President Narval to\nsee that the inventory is conducted. May I count\non your cooperation?\"\n\n\"If I decline, what then?\"\n\n\"Blockade, for starters.\"\n\n\"The UIPS will not permit your interference with\nour operations.\"\n\n\"Is that the formal response of your Government\nto my request?\"\n\nA short pause. \"No.\"\n\n\"Then I suggest you dispense with posturing and\narrange to receive the inventory crews. Please\ninstruct all Masters of transports and other ships\ndoing business with your depot to cooperate with\nour agents.\"\n\nAnother voice cut in, heavy with anger.\n\n\"No goddamned shakedown artists are coming\naboard my ship.\"\n\nBrad motioned Drummer to give him the mike,\nindicating by his facial expression that the\nintruder did not deserve a direct response\nfrom Drummer's level.\n\n\"This is Commander Curtin,\" Brad said with\nlow-toned authority, \"Executive to Admiral\nDrummer. Who speaks?\"\n\nHe winked at Drummer, who leaned back in his\nchair, grinning.\n\n\"Lieutenant Bura, commanding the transport\nSandbox. I repeat: keep your damn squeeze clerks\naway from my ship, regardless how legitimate\nyou claim your purpose to be.\"\n\n\"You're in no position to refuse,\" Brad shot back.\n\"You're in Plutonian territory, and we have every\nright to employ police or military powers to\nenforce our jurisdiction. You will cooperate in\nthis inventory, peacefully, if possible; under\nforce, if necessary.\"\n\n\"You'll have to fight your way on to my ship.\"\nBura's voice was harsh, angry. \"Be advised we are\narmed and prepared to repel unauthorized boarders.\nI take your demands to be attempted extortion, and\na clear threat to the safety of my ship, crew and\ncargo. That, at the least, is piracy in my book,\nand I am within my authority to use force to keep\npirates off my ship. Now, chew on that.\"\n\n\"Lieutenant Bura.\" Brad's voice was space-cold.\n\"You now insult the Plutonian Government by\naccusing it of piracy. Your attitude gives us good\nreason to question the purpose of your presence\nin our territory. By your words, you command an\narmed vessel. Now you dare to threaten legitimate\nrepresentatives of a sovereign nation with your\nguns. We have no choice but to conclude you are\na danger to our ships and to our people.\"\n\n\"Ridiculous. I am merely protecting the safety\nand integrity of my ship.\"\n\n\"So you say. Nevertheless, you have threatened\nto use force against our exercise of legitimate\nrights. Tell me, Bura, is your ship really a\ncommercial cargo transporter or is it a UIPS\nwarship with a military mission inside our legal\njurisdiction?\"\n\n\"What in hell are you trying to do, whoever you\nare? My ship is a transporter of cargo, and you\nknow that damned well.\"\n\n\"I know no such thing. All I know is that you claim\nto be armed and say you will use your weapons\nagainst us. I repeat: are you on a military\nmission?\"\n\n\"No, damn it, I am not.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you.\"\n\n\"That's your problem.\"\n\n\"Not at all, my man, it's yours. You insult and\nthen threaten harm to us.\" Brad grinned at Drummer,\nwho was watching him with an appraising expression.\n\"Our fire control system has you marked and our\nguns are trained on your ship. How does that strike\nyou?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"I say,\" Brad roared, \"Bura of the Sandbox, how\ndoes that strike you? You have ten seconds to\nreply.\"\n\nLieutenant Bura's voice came in, low and tight\nwith suppressed rage.\n\n\"I read you, loud and clear. My gun crews are\nstanding down.\"\n\n\"Unacceptable, Bura,\" Brad said flatly, \"you remain\na serious obstacle to the success of our mission.\nStand by and do not interrupt again. Admiral\nDrummer wishes to complete this transaction with\nthe Depot Commander. Colonel Hanno, we are waiting\nfor your answer to Admiral Drummer's request,\nwhich, I repeat, is to arrange for our inventory\nspecialists to perform their duties aboard your\nDepot and the transports within your control area.\"\n\n\"I take note of your fleet's deployment, Admiral\nDrummer,\" the voice of Colonel Hanno was\nsubdued but intense, \"and the manner in which your\nExecutive responded to Lieutenant Bura's protest.\nMy responsibility for the safety of UIPS supplies,\nproperties and personnel under my command\nand for UIPS vessels in the Planet Pluto Special\nZone leaves me no choice but to accede to your\noutrageous demands. I do so under most solemn and\nvigorous protest, and only because your guns are\ntrained at our heads. Be aware these conversations\nare being recorded and spunnel-transmitted to my\nGovernment as we speak.\"\n\n\"Your protests are noted, Colonel Hanno,\" Drummer\nsaid, taking over. \"Please convey our respects\nto your Government. Now, as to procedure for\nthe audit, I suggest we set up a small group of\nadministrators and specialists to prepare schedules\nand other details. This must be done immediately,\nas we have no wish to delay your support operations\nunnecessarily. Do you agree?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good. One of my ships is now approaching the\nGateway. I realize you may have reservations\nconcerning one of my military craft entering your\nrestricted zone, and I respect your reservations.\nPlease have your representatives board the\nPlutonian craft outside the Gateway. My specialists\nare aboard, and the two groups can work out the\ndetails. Is this satisfactory?\"\n\n\"I reject your term 'satisfactory', and accede\nunder the same protest.\"\n\n\"I understand, Colonel Hanno. By the way, one\nother matter, concerning the Sandbox. I cannot\naccept Bura's assurance that his gun crews are\non 'stand down'.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean, Colonel Hanno, that I insist on an\ninspection of the Sandbox by members of my military\nstaff so that I am certain the Sandbox's guns are\nnot a threat to the safety of my fleet. I cannot\ncontinue to dissipate my capabilities by the need\nto keep the Sandbox under special surveillance\nthroughout this operation. The Sandbox guns must\nbe rendered inoperative and, frankly, I don't trust\nBura to perform that service for me.\"\n\n\"Lieutenant Bura,\" said Colonel Hanno, \"I assume\nthat you and other ships' Commanders have been\nlistening in on this delightful exchange.\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"What do you say?\"\n\n\"You're the Zone Commander.\"\n\n\"For the safety of your ship and the rest of us,\nI recommend you comply with their demand.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Admiral Drummer?\"\n\n\"Very good. Have the Sandbox stand by to receive\nboarders. This completes our discussion, Colonel\nHanno. I'll get back to you if the situation calls\nfor it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter EIGHTEEN\n\n\nBrad studied the Sandbox on the utility's view\nscreen.\n\n\"I think you'd better have a look,\" he said to\nKumiko as he twisted aside on the cramped flight\ndeck. She peered over his shoulder.\n\n\"Got a problem?\" Scarf sneered, his bulk cramped\nthe remaining space behind the flitter's pilot\nseat. He hunched forward trying to see around\nKumiko.\n\nBrad ignored the question. He waited for Kumiko's\nassessment of the Sandbox, dead ahead.\n\nDrummer had given him the job.\n\n\"I want this done,\" he told Brad, \"in a way that\nwill demonstrate to the UIPS that we're serious,\nand can back our words with actions. We've got\nto replace their image of us as misfits. They've\ngot to see us as an organized military force that\ncan defend its vital interests and, if necessary,\nimpose its will.\"\n\n\"What do you have in mind?\"\n\n\"I want to use Kumiko's expertise as a weapons\nofficer familiar with Inner Region ordnance. I want\nboth of you to board the Sandbox and check all\ninstalled armament that can be directed against\nour fleet. Avoid a scrap, but if you find the guns\nhave not been deactivated, do it for them.\"\n\nHe pointed at Brad to give emphasis to his words.\n\n\"I don't want their weapons slipping back into\noperational status as soon as you leave their ship.\nWhatever it is you do, fix their armament controls\nso that it'll take them at least fifteen hours to\nget them back on line. We'll need that much time\nto finish our job here and return to base.\"\n\nScarf joined them, listening.\n\n\"I don't like it.\" His words were angry; his\nfeatures petulant.\n\nDrummer looked at Scarf with open scorn.\n\n\"Your likes and dislikes are the least of my\nconcerns,\" he snorted and turned back to Brad.\n\nScarf cut back in.\n\n\"I repeat, Drummer, I don't like it, and what I\nlike or don't like is your concern. I'm here on\ncounter-intelligence work, and I don't like your\nsending this guy,\" thumbing toward Brad, \"and\none of his sidekicks over to a UIPS ship on a highly\nsensitive assignment. I'm not that trusting they'll\ndo the job as thoroughly as you're laying it out.\"\n\nDrummer frowned.\n\n\"What do you suggest?\"\n\n\"That I go along.\"\n\nBrad stepped back to let the two work it out.\nHe didn't relish the assignment. The Sandbox's\ncommander was not going to accept boarders\ngraciously.\n\n\"You go along? What the hell for?\"\n\n\"To see how the assignment is carried out, and\nfrankly, to make sure this guy doesn't, shall\nwe say, inadvertently pass information to\nthe enemy.\" After a brief pause, Scarf added,\n\"I'm within my authority, Drummer. Part of the\ncounter-intelligence function,\" adding, with a\nsmirk, \"Don't you agree?\"\n\n ##\n\nThe utility's approach to the cylindrical Sandbox\nclosed in on the port side. Brad, at the controls,\nincreased viewer magnification and inspected the\nship closely. Kumiko, looking at the same image,\nreached under Brad's arm and adjusted knobs and\nlevers, zeroing in on one gun turret after another\nalong the Sandbox's length. She whistled softly.\n\n\"They're loaded for bear,\" she said. \"Circle them,\nBrad, let's see what's on the other side.\"\n\nBrad took the utility around to starboard, then\ntopside and below.\n\nScarf again. \"OK, you've looked her over. Now,\nwhat's the problem?\"\n\n\"The ship has four laser-quads and a couple of\nexplosive decompressors. She's a heavily armed\nattack transport, that's all.\"\n\n\"So what? Can you do the job?\"\n\nKumiko looked at Scarf, her normally soft features\ntwisted, passive but icy. \"Oh, yes,\" she said.\n\"I can do it. May take a little time, though.\"\n\nScarf leaned back.\n\n\"Well, let's not fool around with these jokers. If\nthey don't cooperate, I'm for back to the Dragon\nand let our guns talk for us.\"\n\n\"Listen, Scarf,\" Brad said, exasperated, \"our job\nis to disable the armament, not destroy the ship.\nAlso, if you recall, Drummer wants to get through\nthis exercise without using force. That's why we're\nhere: to fix the Sandbox so they and any other\nship commanders of like mind won't get ideas\nabout resisting us. It's a psychological play that will\nmake the rounds of the Outer as well as the Inner\nRegion. It's to our advantage to show we do our job\nwith minimum fuss. So, let's get on with it.\"\n\nBrad opened the inter-ship comm-line.\n\n\"Calling Sandbox. This is Curtin on Dragon Utility\nOne, approaching from your starboard. Are you\nprepared to receive us?\"\n\n\"Ready,\" came back. \"Your air lock is number 4,\nstarboard. Go there now. We will extend umbilical\nand catwalk as soon as you're matched up.\"\n\nBrad guided his craft around and along the Sandbox\nto a portal bearing a large painted \"4.\" Slowing\nthe utility, he closed with the Sandbox, gently\nfingering controls until they were matched\nprecisely to the heavy transport's bearing and\ndrift.\n\n\"Now,\" he said.\n\nKumiko hit a switch, and the utility beam-anchor\nconnected to a triangular plate above the airlock,\nimmobilizing and fixing the utility to the huge\ntransporter's axis.\n\nThe number 4 clamshell panels drew back and\nslipped aside. A yellow and white-striped catwalk\nsnaked out and suckled up to the utility's hatch.\n\nKumiko took in the overhead dials and lights.\n\n\"On track,\" she said, and after a moment,\n\"connected and secure.\"\n\nBrad closed a bank of switches, opened another.\n\"We'll take no unnecessary chances,\" he said. \"I'm\nsetting the thruster to cut in at twenty percent\nas soon as we're back in and slam the hatch. Five\nseconds and into forty, another three and we\ngo max. That's for just in case. So, if we need\nto move fast when we board, hit the accello-nets\npronto. Got it?\"\n\n\"Right,\" from Kumiko.\n\n\"Scarf?\"\n\n\"Sure, sure. I got it.\"\n\n\"Next. I want 'em to be able to see that the power\nsettings on our sidearms are low enough so as\nnot to kill or cause serious injury. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"If they start anything, I'd just as soon take a\nfew of them out for good.\" Scarf postured his\nbelligerence.\n\n\"Nothing doing, Scarf,\" Brad shot back. \"Using\nour weapons on this mission is bound to delay\nthe schedule, if not much worse. It's been fouled\nup already by this little sortie. So don't provoke\n'em; set your weapon in the lower levels.\"\n\nBrad set his weapon at the extreme low setting\nand noted that Kumiko did the same. Scarf set\nhis at the highest level in the non-lethal category,\nand with a sneer at Brad, returned the weapon\nto its sheath.\n\nKumiko looked thoughtful. \"We should wear suits\nwhile we're on board the Sandbox, Brad,\" she said.\n\"It may slow us down a bit, but we'll need to look\nat gun emplacements that have minimal air or\nnone at all.\"\n\n\"Sounds reasonable. OK, keep your suits on.\"\n\nThey rigged their sidearms for control from within\ntheir suits and transferred them to outer sheaths.\nThey donned the suits, checked each other's suit\nsecurity, seal pressure, inter-suit communications,\nand reported.\n\n\"Move out,\" Brad said.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter NINETEEN\n\n\nThe Sandbox's receiving officer observed Brad and\nhis party's approach through a clear pane in the\nair lock's pressurized section. The four husky\ndeckhands and the officer-in-charge hefted\nsnub-nosed rifles.\n\nA pressure-suited deckhand responded to Brad's\nhand signal that his crew was aboard by conducting\na visual safety check of the ship-to-utility\nconnections. He turned away, and Brad felt the deck\nvibrate as the clamshells slammed shut. Kumiko and\nScarf moved up to stand behind Brad as pressure\nequalizers hissed. Moments later, the air lock's\ninner door slid aside and they passed through.\nOpening their helmet faceplates, they returned\nthe glares of the receiving party.\n\n\"Rimov, and gunnery is my business,\" said the\nofficer, \"what in hell are you gonna do to my guns?\"\n\nBrad wished he were beside the grizzled spacefarer\nfacing their common adversary, rather than\nconfronting him.\n\n\"Curtin, and my business is to make sure your\nguns don't get you all killed. I want to check your\nweapons control center, and every gun emplacement.\nFirst, central control.\"\n\n\"Hey,\" chimed in Scarf. \"How about a drink with the\nship's commander? Courtesies of the space-ways,\nand all that? I'd sure like to sample some Inner Region\nbooze.\"\n\n\"You guys ain't invited guests, no way,\" Rimov\nflashed back. \"The Commander is fussy about\nthe people he drinks with.\"\n\n\"Well, you tell him...\" Scarf raised a fist to add\ngesture to his words, but Brad waved him off,\nhis eyes holding on Rimov.\n\n\"To hell with that,\" he snapped. \"We're here to\ndo a job and get back to our ship. I repeat: first,\nthe fire control center, then each gun emplacement.\nNow.\"\n\n\"Our fire control center has been deactivated. Why\ndo you have to see each gun?\"\n\n\"You know damn well, Rimov,\" Brad said, putting as\nmuch harshness into his tone as he could muster.\n\"Your pieces can be fired independent of central\ncontrol; I'm going to make sure they won't be.\nLet's get on with it.\"\n\nBrad noted that Rimov was staring at the intensity\nslide visible on the breechblock of his sheathed\nweapon. Rimov then tilted his head to scrutinize\nthe settings on Kumiko and Scarf's weapons. His\nbrows tightened, puzzled. It passed.\n\n\"OK, follow me,\" he said, pivoting and taking the\nlead.\n\nThe passageways were narrow, confining them to two\nabreast. Rimov and one of his men walked ahead, the\nother three escorts followed close behind Brad and\nhis party. The corridors they traversed had been\ncleared; no encounters.\n\nBrad, familiar with transports of the line,\nmemorized their route. They had boarded\namidships, lower starboard, and were headed for\nan armor-enclosed section near the stern. The\nsurveillance and tracking gear and the laser-quads'\nfire control computers should be there. That\npart should be relatively simple. They reached\na closed, heavy door. Rimov turned to Brad, his\nface reflecting rage.\n\n\"You didn't answer my question,\" he growled.\n\"What're you gonna do to my guns?\"\n\n\"Nothing you couldn't fix in a couple of work\nshifts,\" Brad replied, motioning to the door.\n\"Let's move.\"\n\nGrudgingly, Rimov placed his palm on the disk\nlock. A click and the heavy door retracted into\nthe adjacent bulkhead.\n\nAs Brad expected, the fire control center consisted\nof dozens of consoles, scopes, directional and power\ncontrol devices, and clusters of computer terminals.\n\nKumiko and Brad circled the small room as Scarf\nwatched from his position inside the entryway.\nRimov stood beside Scarf, his guards along the\nbulkhead, tense, weapons directed at the deck.\n\nKumiko pointed to a console.\n\n\"I've got to see behind that panel, Brad,\" she\nsaid, pointing. \"The master firing system controls\nshould be concentrated there.\"\n\nBrad turned and waved Rimov closer. Scarf didn't\nmove; he got it all on his helmet intercom.\n\n\"Remove the panel,\" Brad said, pointing.\n\n\"Won't take my word, will you,\" Rimov growled.\n\nReaching over, he snapped several quick\ndisconnects, slid the panel forward, reached into\nthe recess behind, fiddled a couple of seconds,\nand pulled the panel forward again. It came loose,\nand he stepped back with it in his hands.\n\n\"Cut the power to this console,\" Kumiko ordered.\n\nRimov shrugged, moved to another console and\nsnapped several switches. Kumiko watched closely.\nRimov turned back and observed her check several\nlights and dials above the space from where the\npanel had been removed.\n\nSatisfied, Kumiko drew off her outer glove. Her\nhand remained encased in translucent, skin-tight\ninsulation. Reaching into the cavity, she withdrew\na tiny black chip. Setting it down on a nearby\nshelf, she repeated the operation. Shortly,\na dozen chips lay on the shelf.\n\nRimov flushed with fury as he watched Kumiko\nwork, but remained silent.\n\nFinally, Kumiko stepped back, pulled a plastic\nbag from a pocket in her suit, and dropped in\nthe assorted parts. Looking around the room,\nshe went to a wall cabinet, opened the door,\nrummaged about and withdrew still more chips.\n\n\"Back up supplies,\" she said, adding them to\nthe others in the plastic bag.\n\nKumiko looked at Brad.\n\n\"The fire control center is out of action,\" she\nsaid. \"Even if they do have more spares stashed\naway, it'll take them at least twenty hours to\ninstall the parts and calibrate the system.\"\n\nBrad turned to Rimov. \"Let's start with the aft gun\nturrets, and take them, in order, moving forward.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter TWENTY\n\n\nThe next two hours were given to rushing along\npassageways, climbing companionways and ladders,\nand crawling along narrow walkways. Several turrets\ncould only be reached from the outside; Kumiko's\nadvice to wear suits proved sound.\n\nAt each gun emplacement, Rimov, his guards and\nScarf watched Brad and Kumiko inspect sector\nguides, range and directional interlocks and power\ndrives.\n\nOnce satisfied that a gun emplacement was not\nbooby-trapped, Kumiko inserted random realignment\nparameters into laser blocks, twirled tracking\nsequencers into disarray, and switched about chips\nand connectors. When she was done with a turret,\nthe gun had a zero firing potential, and would take\nhours to repair, calibrate and test.\n\nBrad noted that Rimov, following Kumiko's work\nclosely, showed grudging admiration in his eyes.\nShe was disabling the guns with gentle care, not\ndamaging them, and Rimov knew it.\n\nFinally, they were at the ship's bow. The final\nturret had been rendered inoperative.\n\nBrad faced Rimov.\n\n\"We'll be on our way. Back to the air lock.\"\n\nBrad was relieved. They would soon be in the\nutility, heading back to the Dragon, the job done.\nEven Scarf could not fault them. Scarf's report\nmight even work to the Sentinel's advantage.\n\nRimov took the lead. The deckhands seemed less\ntense. They sensed that Rimov was impressed\nby Kumiko's professionalism, and they, too, had\nobserved the consideration that Kumiko had shown\nfor the ship's equipment. She was obviously not\na crowbar techie.\n\nThey moved toward the air lock single file, Rimov\nin the lead, Brad, Kumiko and Scarf following, and\nthe four deckhands, two abreast, in the rear.\n\nRounding a corner, they stopped. Ahead, three\nmen crouched, laser-rifles at their shoulders\naimed at them.\n\n\"Rimov, and you guys in the rear, outta the way.\nWe're puttin' these bastards down.\"\n\nThe order came from a short, blond-haired buck,\neyes glaring above his gunfight.\n\n\"Wait,\" Rimov screamed. \"What's the hell's goin'\non, Cordy? These guys got safe conduct from Bura.\"\n\n\"I don't buy that, Rimov. We got the word down\nbelow that the ship's bein' taken over by Narval's\ngoons. We're gonna stop 'em. Come for'ard,\nI'm tellin' ya. They're goin' down, right now. Get\nready, Joe, Pete.\"\n\nThe two guards behind Scarf and Kumiko dropped\nto the deck and snaked back around the corner.\nThey were not about to shoot at shipmates.\n\nRimov dashed toward Cordy, his arms waving.\n\n\"Don't fire. Back off,\" he shouted.\n\nThe men with the rifles were momentarily confused,\nuncertain; one began to lower his weapon. Rimov\nwas a ship's officer; they would be in deep trouble\nif they disobeyed.\n\nWithout warning, the decision was taken from them.\n\nScarf panicked.\n\nStepping back and behind Kumiko, using her as\nhis shield, he frantically jerked his heavy hand\nweapon loose, at the same time crouching in firing\nposition. Gripping the weapon with both hands,\nhe rammed the setting into max and fired around\nKumiko. Brad was out of his momentary line of\nfire. Not so Rimov.\n\nThe burst hit Rimov between the shoulder blades.\nThere was a sharp, crackling sound as cloth and\nRimov's flesh carbonized. He fell forward, dead\nbefore he struck the deck.\n\nNo one moved. Cordy and his men stared at their\nfallen officer.\n\nBrad didn't wait for them to recover.\n\n\"Back,\" he shouted to Kumiko and Scarf. \"Around\nthe bend. Now.\"\n\nKumiko whirled and raced around the corner.\nScarf rolled back on to his feet and dashed after\nher. Brad followed.\n\nRimov's guards were nowhere in sight.\n\nThere was a roar of rage behind them.\n\nCordy.\n\n\"They shot Rimov. After 'em. Shoot to kill.\"\n\nThe passageway was long; they would be at the\nwrong end of a shooting gallery as soon as Cordy\nreached the bend. The only break was a narrow\nladder through a hatch in the overhead.\n\n\"Up,\" Brad commanded. \"Fast.\"\n\nKumiko first, then Scarf. Brad followed.\n\nAs Brad drew his legs up through the hatchway\na searing blast struck the frame, missing him\nby centimeters. Brad twisted away as another\nbolt flashed up through the hatch, scorching\nthe bulkhead from which he had just moved.\n\nBrad shouted down. \"First guy who shoves his head\nthrough the hatch gets it burned off.\" Turning to\nKumiko and Scarf he whispered, \"That won't hold\nthem for long.\"\n\n\"Listen, about that shooting...\", Scarf began.\n\nBrad snapped him short with an impatient gesture.\n\"Not now. Let's get to the utility.\"\n\nThey looked around. The space was almost dark;\nthe only light from widely spaced, low-power\nneutro-lamps. They were standing on a narrow\nplatform, little more than a ledge, from which a\ncatwalk bridged a complex of girders and cables.\n\nBrad mentally reconstructed their route before\nCordy's challenge. The portal through which they\nboarded should be within fifty meters of where\nthey crouched. Their lives depended on the catwalk\npassing close to it.\n\nStudying the arrangement of the structures around\nthem and the coding on cable bundles, Brad peered\nalong the catwalk, first in one direction, then the\nopposite.\n\nHe looked at the open hatch and shouted down. \"We\ndemand safe conduct to our ship. Do you hear me?\"\n\nSilence.\n\nScarf shoved his face close to Brad.\n\n\"Are you kiddin'?\" he said, his tone expressing his\ndisbelief. \"I just killed one of their men. They're\nnot gonna give us safe conduct anywhere.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" Brad replied. \"Even if they do\npromise us safe conduct, it'll be just to get at\nus. I want them to think we're going to hole up\nhere until they give us an answer. Bura must know\nby now. We've got to get off before he personally\ntakes charge of the search.\"\n\nBrad again scrutinized the ship's stringers and\ncable insulation colors. He pointed.\n\n\"Stay close.\"\n\nThey crossed stretches where ledges and walkways\nnarrowed abruptly to barely enough for passage.\nSharp projections along the way snagged and abraded\ntheir protective suits. They realized that they\nmight face serious seepage from their suits as\nsoon as they entered the vacuum of space.\n\nA sudden, raking fire erupted behind them. Metal\nframes around them darkened from the bolts of\nenergy.\n\nScarf jerked his weapon and returned the shots\nbefore Brad could stop him. The flash of his weapon\nprovided the ideal target, and brought concentrated\nfire in return.\n\nStooping and sliding, Brad and Kumiko stumbled\nforward. Scarf scrambled along behind, firing\nhaphazardly to the rear.\n\nScarf howled with sudden pain. Brad looked back. In\nthe dim light, Scarf hung over a girder, motionless.\nBrad raced back to his side. A wide strip from\nsleeve and shoulder was burned away; blood oozed.\n\nKumiko bent beside Brad. She yanked her glove\noff, reached in through the still smoking sleeve\nand felt for a pulse in Scarf's neck.\n\n\"Alive.\"\n\nShe stepped back. Brad, in the cramped space,\nhauled the unconscious Scarf upright, bent, and\nwith Kumiko's help, lifted him on to Brad's back.\n\nScarf's scream of pain had brought a pause to\nthe firing.\n\nGrasping stanchions and cables for support,\nBrad staggered along the catwalk.\n\n\"Hatch up ahead.\"\n\n\"Might be it.\"\n\nBrad gasped. Even in the light pseudo-gravity,\nScarf's bulk was hard to maneuver.\n\n\"Take a peek.\"\n\nKumiko was gone and back in an instant.\n\n\"Looks clear.\"\n\n\"No choice. Down you go. I'll drop him through.\"\n\nKumiko dropped out of sight. Brad thrust Scarf\nthrough the hatch and followed. The drop was not\ndeep.\n\nThe number 4 air lock was less than ten meters\nahead. Brad heaved Scarf across his shoulders, and\nwith Kumiko leading the way, they rushed toward it.\n\nThe deck carried the slap of running feet, fast and\nclosing.\n\nCordy appeared at the end of the passage. Seeing\nthem, he crouched on one knee and raised his weapon.\n\nKumiko beat him; at the sound of running, she had\nraised her sidearm. As Cordy took aim, she fired.\nCordy fell back, stunned.\n\nBrad had the door to the outer air lock open, Scarf\non the deck inside. Kumiko rushed past Brad and\nhe slammed the door and clipped it sealed. She\nsnatched an emergency space stretcher from\na bulkhead rack and snapped it open. It took the\ntwo of them to roll Scarf's inert body into the\nenvelope, seal it around him and start an oxygen\nflow.\n\nThey snapped their faceplates closed. Brad hit\nswitches. The outer portals slid apart. The catwalk\nand other connections to the utility were still in\nplace. Carrying the stretcher between them, they\ncrossed over.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter TWENTY-ONE\n\n\nBrad poked his head into Drummer's office at Fleet\nHeadquarters. Drummer, at his desk, bent over\na document, cast frequent glances at electronic\ndisplays on the wall nearby. Racks of data\ncapsules, no space for them on the busy\ndesk, crowded the floor nearby. A conical view\ntank, recessed in the wall to his left, glowed\nwith symbols of ships and their military\ncharacteristics, along with tactical and logistical\nlinks.\n\nScanning the monitors and view tank, Drummer\nhefted a hand control and pressed keys. Eyes\nhalf-closed, he silently transformed mental images\ninto memoranda and messages. Aware of Brad's\npresence, he paused and focused on him in the doorway.\n\n\"I thought you planned to take a couple of days off\nafter Tornado Six,\" Brad said.\n\n\"Can't,\" Drummer replied, his eyes back to his notes.\n\n\"What's happening?\"\n\n\"Until Tornado Six, our forces functioned as\nseparate units. Tornado Six was our fleet's first\nintegrated operation. The mission succeeded because\nwe got away without military opposition. I can't\ntrust that sort of luck to hold. We need to refine\nour tactics, based on our experience with the log\ndepot and that armed transport, and in anticipation\nof an early organized response by the UIPS.\"\n\nBrad appeared uncertain whether to remain or\nmove on.\n\n\"Stand by a moment, Brad.\"\n\nDrummer resumed recording. Symbols in the\ntank flashed off and on too quickly for the eye to\nfollow, but Drummer was no longer giving them his\nattention. He touched a glowing disk on the arm\nof his chair, sighed, and leaned back. The view tank\ncleared to continue its work unobserved.\n\n\"I need a break. Here's what's happening, Brad.\"\n\nHe motioned Brad to a seat alongside his desk.\n\n\"Narval was impressed at our success, especially\nhow we bluffed our way through it. Just as\nwell we didn't push too hard and force an\neyeball-to-eyeball confrontation. He wants much\nmore preparation before we get to that point.\nI agree, we'll leave that until our next no-notice\ninspection.\"\n\n\"Well, we did have a fire fight, of sorts, on the\nSandbox,\" Brad interjected.\n\n\"By itself, much less significant than the raids\nwe've made on UIPS patrols and shipping. The\nSandbox incident was the ship commander's fault\nhowever one looks at it. By the way,\" Drummer\ngrinned. \"I suggested to Colonel Hanno that\nhe chastise the Sandbox's commander about\nallowing his people to attack my agents. Lax\ndiscipline, and all that.\"\n\nBrad laughed, but grimly recalled Rimov's wasted\ndeath. Drummer joined him in the laugh, then\nquickly resumed his serious expression. Elbows\non desk, hands clasped, he frowned at Brad.\n\n\"In categorizing the Sandbox incident\n'insignificant' I do so only in the context of its\neffect on objectives and strategy. In another\nsense, it was quite important.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Narval was pleased with the way you handled\nyourself on the Dragon in dealing with Hanno\nand Bura.\"\n\n\"How did he find out?\"\n\n\"Scarf's nature, it seems, made him anxious to\nget a verbatim record of everything said in his\npresence during Tornado Six. He was wired, and\neverything said in his presence was recorded.\nHad events gone otherwise, I'm convinced he\nwould have lifted statements that each of us\nmade and twisted them to discredit us.\n\n\"Putting Scarf in hospital immediately upon return\nto base didn't give him the chance to tailor the\ntranscript. Since he reports directly to Narval,\nthe recordings were sent to the boss from the\nhospital as soon as Scarf was admitted -- routine\nsecurity under the circumstances. I heard a short\nwhile ago that Narval spent some time in Scarf's\nhospital room. I can only assume he was questioning\nScarf on the unedited recording as well as whatever\nhe witnessed.\"\n\n\"What happens now?\"\n\n\"Got a call from Narval's office a short while ago.\nNarval wants to meet you. Call his office ASAP\nand get a time.\"\n\n ##\n\nNarval's stare was long and searching. He ignored\nthe armed guards standing within effective range\nof Brad.\n\n\"Sit.\" Narval pointed to a heavy chair directly in\nfront of his desk. Straight-backed from flat, hard\nseat to shoulder level, extension clamshells from\nthe upper section of the chair curved forward\nsharply to form tapered wings.\n\nBrad sat. The clamshells closed in and stopped\na few centimeters from his temple. Wired pads\nextended and touched his skull at several points.\nThe chair was not comfortable; psychic probes\nweren't meant to be.\n\n\"Tell me about yourself,\" Narval leaned back,\ninspected his fingers, and then concentrated on\na monitor in the wall behind the chair in which\nBrad sat.\n\n\"My name is Brad Curtin,\" Brad began, \"and I'm\nhere with five others to seek sanctuary.\"\n\n\"Tell me about the crimes of which you were\nconvicted, the Guardian Station prison to which you\nwere committed, how you organized your escape,\nand how it was carried through. You know, of course,\nthat you're undergoing psychic probe. The probe\ncompensates for your awareness of its being used\non you; the validity of the findings is not degraded.\nI see the monitor from where I sit, so, let's hear\nyour story.\"\n\nBrad spoke for fifteen minutes without\ninterruption. He related the events on his\ntransport off Luna, the investigation that led\nto his trial, his testimony before the Board,\nand his arrival at the Guardian Station. Without\nhesitation, he swung into the cover scenario that\nhad been burned deep into his psyche by Ram's\ntechnicians: how he had selected his accomplices,\norganized the escape, joined the convoy into the\nspunnel, and finally, his arrival on Planet Pluto.\n\nBrad let the embedded scripts flow freely. He\ntrusted Ram's preparations; his life and the lives\nof his companions depended on them. Far more\nimportant, the Sentinels mission demanded it.\nAnomalies, he knew, would be sensed immediately,\nshould he even try to color his recounting of the\npersonal knowledge and programmed experiences\nnow deeply embedded in his mind.\n\nBrad stopped talking; the general questions had\nbeen answered. Narval studied the wall monitor\nbehind Brad, and returned his stare to Brad.\n\n\"Let's clear up a few points,\" he said. \"I\nunderstand the ship that you, shall we say,\nexpropriated for your escape was no more\nthan a local utility vessel in the Belt. Yet, from\nwhat you say -- and from your ship's log -- your\ndestination was the rim. Wouldn't you have had a\nfuel problem?\"\n\n\"We thought at first that we would. Our plan,\noriginally, was to get to a refueling station,\nreplenish our energy packs, and take it from there.\nWhen we checked our bearings, we discovered that\nour coordinates put us within range of a spunnel node\nso we headed for that. When we got there, several\nconvoys were lined up for entry to the Special\nZone. Our ship had UIPS markings and the gateway\nwas crowded. We managed to get in the lineup and\nmade it.\"\n\nNarval glanced at the monitor.\n\n\"I see. Now, the Guardian Station prison, I am\ninformed, keeps tabs on its inmates using a\nsophisticated surveillance system. How did you\nmanage to evade observation long enough to get\naway?\"\n\n\"Zolan, a member of our group is an\nexpert in electronic countermeasures,\ncounter-countermeasures, and so on. The system\non the Guardian Station was installed two to three\ncenturies ago. It serves fine, I suppose, for the\nordinary run of inmates confined on the station.\nZolan devised a screen behind which we did our\nplanning and preparations. When we were ready to\ngo, he rammed both a counter and a counter-counter\ndevice into the station's sensors. The double\nwhammy confused the hell out of the system\nlong enough for us to make our getaway.\"\n\n\"That's my next question. It seems to me the\nSpace Guard should have been after you immediately.\nHow is it they let you get away?\"\n\n\"I think I owe you the credit for that.\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"That's the way I figure it. The Guard needs a\nminimum number of ships to do its work in the Inner\nRegion space lanes. Those lanes are so crowded that\nthey need every ship they can muster to maintain\norder. On that I speak from long and bitter\npersonal experience. Since the secession, many\nmore Guard vessels are needed along the Belt\nand their overlap into the Jovian Void; at best\nthey're thinly spread.\n\n\"Because of the threat to Slingshot that they\nperceive in you, the UIPS has been draining both\ngroups lately to augment patrols along routes\nthrough the Outer Region that converge on the\nSpecial Zone. The additional ships are from the\nBelt patrols. With all that they already have to\ncover, expending vital resources to chase a few\nescaped convicts just wasn't worth it.\"\n\nNarval wheezed a chuckle.\n\n\"So, you think you are beholden to me for this\nindirect assistance. Really feel that way?\"\n\nAs he asked the question he looked intently at\nthe monitor. Brad, in turn, watched Narval's eyes.\n\n\"I can't see it any other way, Mr. President.\"\n\nNarval grinned.\n\n\"Your answers to my questions present an\ninteresting scenario,\" Narval said after studying\nthe monitor. \"The probe, by the way, does not\nindicate significant deviations from the facts --\nas you understand them, of course.\"\n\nNarval waved the guards away. Saluting, they left\nthe room, closing the door softly behind them.\nNarval motioned Brad to a chair of much gentler\ndesign alongside his desk. As Brad exchanged seats\nNarval swiveled his chair to face him. He leaned\nforward and grasped Brad's wrist in a puffy grip.\n\n\"The interrogation is over,\" he said. \"This little\nsession with the probe, along with voice analyses\nof you and your associates has, up to now, failed\nto disclose a threat to me or about what you all\nnow know of my plans and military capabilities.\nYou seem to be what you claim. Nevertheless,\nyou remain under scrutiny.\"\n\nBrad shrugged and remained silent; his features\nreflected that he expected no less.\n\nNarval's smile was vapid, metallic.\n\n\"I commend you for the manner in which you\nrepresented Drummer and, I add, myself. You did\nwell with the log depot Commander and that upstart\non the transport. I am especially pleased with the\nway you conducted yourself in that little squabble\non the transport.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. President.\"\n\n\"Now, to more important matters, Brad.\"\n\nNarval leaned back in his deeply cushioned chair\nand tented his stubby fingers.\n\n\"Your observations on the deployment of UIPS\nmilitary forces interests me. It supports my\nsuspicions. The Inner Region's internal Space Guard\nis constabulary in both organization and mission.\nTheir jurisdiction is confined by the UIPS borders.\nTheir Military Space Force, on the other hand, has\na charter to roam the Solar System -- comparable\nto ancient laws ensuring open seas and oceans.\n\n\"Transfer of fighter craft and pilots from the UIPS\nSpace Guard to the Military Space Force, I suspect,\nis now taking place. Many will need to be refitted\nfor long range operations, and their crews trained\nin military concepts and tactics in place of those\nemployed in local constabulary duties.\"\n\nNarval twisted the rings on his fingers, and his\ntiny eyes seemed to sink deeper into surrounding\nflesh.\n\n\"The greatest single concern of the UIPS is the\nintegrity of Slingshot and the Special Zone. I am\nconvinced that the UIPS military forces, once they\nattain optimum strength, will attempt to crush me,\nor at the least, dominate the Zone.\n\n\"We must prepare to withstand, to resist, and\nto triumph over this UIPS aggression in the Outer\nRegion.\"\n\nBrad felt Narval's eyes on him.\n\n\"You are going to help me to prepare,\" Narval said.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter TWENTY-TWO\n\n\nDrummer expected the call.\n\n\"Drummer,\" Narval said as the door closed behind\nthe guard and they were alone, \"UIPS perception of\nme as a threat can be as effective a weapon as my\ntransforming the threat into the deed itself.\"\n\nDrummer chose caution. \"How so, Mr. President?\"\n\nNarval peered sharply at Drummer as he leaned his\nheavy body back, and folded ring-encrusted hands\nacross his paunch. He shifted his gaze to the\nceiling and half-closed his eyes.\n\n\"The UIPS now perceives us as having demonstrated\na capability for military actions against their\nvital interests. If we follow up with threats and\nmenacing gestures against Slingshot, the effect may\nunnerve them, to say the least. How do you see it?\"\n\n\"It seems to me we've gone far beyond mere\nthreats,\" Drummer's tone, now grim, continued.\n\"Raiding and harassing their transports, attacking\nand destroying UIPS patrollers in the Zone, and\nnow, the inventory tax. We formally notify them by\nProclamation that we'll lay siege to the Log Depot,\nwe've boarded one of their armed transports and\ndisabled its armaments. These are not empty\nthreats and impetuous gestures.\"\n\n\"Even so, they are prologue, Drummer. Hear me.\"\n\nNarval twisted his rings, first in one direction\nthen opposite. Lowering his eyes to his hands, he\npaused often between words, choosing them with care.\n\n\"Here in the Outer Region, the separate nations\nare convulsed by internal struggles for power both\ninternal to their sovereignty and within the family\nof independent satellites that orbit their host\nplanet. Their political philosophies are diverse,\nlack cohesion, and have powerful advocates or\nopponents, some openly, others covert. The Heads\nof State are insecure and fear political coups.\nRapid changes in leadership cannot be ruled out.\"\n\nDrummer watched Narval eyes caress his entwined\nfingers.\n\n\"If new leaders arise and take over the reins of\npower from incumbents, so much the better for\nme. New governments will need time to become\nentrenched, create lines of authority and\naccountability, and install bureaucracies\nresponsive to the wishes of a new elite. I repeat,\nconfusion in the ranks, within other governments,\nis to my advantage.\"\n\n\"Can you count on such events materializing?\"\n\n\"Of course not.\"\n\nNarval wagged a finger at Drummer.\n\n\"But the uncertainty within regimes that these\ndisruptions can, and may occur, dissipates and\nweakens their energies. If they fear enemies from\nwithin, and suspect enemies from outside, then\nthey are diseased and warrant being replaced by\na daring and skillful master.\"\n\n\"Who might that be?\"\n\n\"Me.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure I understand.\"\n\n\"Then listen carefully, because you play a vital\nrole in my plans.\"\n\nNarval motioned a now openly apprehensive Drummer\nto the chair beside his desk. As Drummer sat,\nNarval leaned close.\n\n\"My strategy has two facets: one involves INOR,\nthe other, the UIPS. They are interdependent.\"\n\nUnfolding his clasped hands, Narval's fingers\ndrummed the desk.\n\n\"I repeat, with INOR in turmoil no head of state\ncan feel secure. New philosophies surface and\nattract supporters, occasionally, even strong\nleaders. If forces with objectives opposing mine\nmove into the Outer Region, I will not sit by idly.\nI will intervene, even if it means imposing the\nmost stringent discipline and controls.\"\n\n\"With respect, President Narval, does Planet Pluto\nhave the right to intervene into the affairs of\nother nations?\"\n\nNarval scowled, recovered, and snickered.\n\n\"Power gives us rights we would not have otherwise.\nWhen the old United Planetary System decided to\nuse Planet Pluto as the forward base for Slingshot,\nthey invested the planet with some of their most\nadvanced technologies. Other communities throughout\nthe Outer Region are just that: places where people\nlive, work, play, consume and little else.\n\n\"Slingshot has given Planet Pluto a far greater\nrole in the solar scheme. And now, a role that\nwas entirely unexpected when Slingshot was\nfirst planned, dissolution of the unified solar\ngovernment released us from UIPS domination. We\ngained opportunities to fashion and strengthen an\ninfrastructure, and freedom to confuse our INOR\nneighbors with a melange of schemes to satisfy\ntheir greed. Slingshot technology, facilities, and\nmateriel give to us, more than to any other member\nof INOR, the means to attain our aspirations. Power\ncreates its own logic, Drummer.\n\n\"To answer your question: I will intervene into the\naffairs of other nations when it is to my benefit\nto do so.\"\n\nNarval's hands clenched into fists. He pounded the\ntop of his desk in a tattoo as he glared at Drummer\nthrough eye slits embedded in fat.\n\n\"Understand me, Drummer,\" Narval shrilled. \"I will\nbe the dominant force in INOR, and that's only the\nbeginning.\"\n\nNarval quieted, each warily observing the other.\nHesitatingly, Drummer tried to respond to Narval's\nincredible declaration.\n\n\"Is that what's behind your recent Proclamation\nto the UIPS on a new foundation for interregional\nrelationships?\"\n\n\"Partly.\"\n\n\"What else is there?\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, we cannot repeat Tornado Six.\nWhen I approved it, I intended it as a one-time\noperation to, shall we say, test the waters.\nIt succeeded through your command, and the\nextraordinary initiative of Brad Curtin. We\nmust now go on to other probing and design new\nconfrontations from which the UIPS will be forced\nto retreat. Our tactics will, at times, include\ndiversions, as we must keep both INOR governments\nand the UIPS off-balance. They must be kept\nguessing -- not certain -- where I will move next.\"\n\n\"How do you expect them to react to such\nprovocation?\"\n\n\"There is little likelihood the UIPS will gamble\nwith the future of our solar civilization by\nretreating from Slingshot; they cannot risk the\nsystem-wide demoralization and desolation that\nwould follow. I intend to play on their fears and\non public pressures to attain my ends. That's where\nthreats come in; we must use them regularly, but\nwith cunning and consistency. UIPS perception of\ndanger to Slingshot, compounded by the enormous\ndistances from their military centers, will\ncompel them to be reasonable. If our tactics\nare convincing the UIPS will have no alternatives.\nThey will accede to my demands.\"\n\n\"What if they resist?\"\n\nNarval's pudgy fists resumed their cadenced\npounding.\n\n\"Let them,\" he snarled, \"I will be ready; I will go\nfurther and challenge them. They will be compelled\nto come to me, and I command the high ground.\nI will defeat them, and move on quickly to my\nultimate objective.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"Isn't it obvious?\"\n\n\"Yes, President Narval, but I must be certain.\"\nDrummer's face was pale. \"My ears want to hear\nwhat my mind has been forced to conclude.\"\n\n\"Very well, Drummer, hear this. Planet Pluto\nis strategically situated at this time to be the\nsingle, most influential force in human affairs. I\nwill use that influence to consolidate my military\ncontrol over INOR. When I have that I will confront\nthe UIPS and beat them down. I, Narval, will\ndominate the Solar System.\"\n\nNarval's ultimate objective was clear and set.\nDrummer knew better than to dissuade him.\n\nHaving confided in Drummer, Narval waxed garrulous.\n\n\"I have debts to pay,\" he said, \"and I shall get\nmuch pleasure in making good on them. Many insults\nand humiliations need to be returned to former\ncolleagues on Callisto. And there are others,\nin tank towns throughout the Outer Region and\nin the UIPS. They will feel my wrath.\"\n\n\"Is vengeance all there is to it?\"\n\nNarval caught himself.\n\n\"No, no, of course not,\" he said, hurriedly. \"I\nshall govern. I shall be wise and magnanimous.\nMagnanimous, that is, to those who support\nme, and,\" clenching his fists again, \"merciless to\nthose who oppose me or seek to undermine my will.\"\n\n\"Considering Planet Pluto's distance from the\ncenters of social and industrial activity,\" Drummer\ninterjected, \"and our planet's far-ranging orbit,\nthis could be a difficult location from which to\ngovern the Solar System.\"\n\n\"I've thought of that, Drummer. I shall move to\nLuna and rule from there. In stages, we can adjust\nto its gravity. Once Slingshot goes operational,\nthis planet will revert to an outpost, for most of\nits orbit beyond the solar rim. It was never meant\nto be more. To me, Planet Pluto has always been\njust another stepping stone.\"\n\nA broad grin rippled across Narval's features.\nDrummer, somber-faced, returned Narval's gaze\nand saw his eyes shrink into lumpy flesh.\n\n\"Drummer, my plans include a position of great\npower and prestige for you.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"A new elite and a new hierarchy will be created\nwhen I take control. I will want a council of\nadvisors, commanders and administrators for\ninternal affairs, constabulary and military forces,\nsecurity, intelligence, and a vast bureaucracy to\nmanage the affairs of government for an entire\nsystem of planets, satellites, and thousands of\nartificial colonies. Much will need to be done, and\nyou will be in the forefront.\"\n\n\"You honor me.\"\n\n\"I expect faithful service, Drummer.\"\n\n\"I shall do my best.\"\n\n\"Good. Now, as to Brad Curtin.\"\n\nNarval leaned back and entwined his fingers\nacross his abdomen.\n\n\"I had him here a short time ago and questioned\nhim under a psychic probe. He withstood the inquiry.\nThe probe did not disclose any inconsistencies to\nmy questions; therefore, I can only conclude he is\nwhat he claims to be. What is your opinion?\"\n\n\"My talks with Brad and his companions led me\nto that conclusion.\"\n\n\"So be it then.\"\n\nNarval's attention seemed to wander. He reached\nfor a document on the desk, and he perused it as\nif his mind was elsewhere.\n\n\"Drummer,\" he said, raising his eyes, \"I want you\nto give Brad a special assignment, and report to\nme periodically how it is progressing. Keep Brad's\ngroup together, but watch them, and report to me\nimmediately of any suspicious activities. I've also\nordered Scarf to keep an eye on Brad and his crew.\"\n\n\"Scarf? To what purpose?\"\n\n\"I have plans for Brad, if he does well.\"\n\n\"What is the task?\"\n\nNarval locked eyes with Drummer.\n\n\"Tell Brad to prepare plans and evaluate our\nmilitary capabilities to penetrate the protective\nshield around the Logistics Depot, to capture it\nand use it as hostage.\"\n\n\"Good God! Take the depot as hostage? For what\npurpose?\"\n\n\"The reason you will give Brad is that INOR will\nhold it hostage for a greater share in decisions on\nthe disposition of Slingshot-generated assets.\"\n\n\"That isn't the real reason, is it?\"\n\n\"No. The objective is diversionary.\"\n\n\"And the real objective?\"\n\n\"You will be told when it is time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter TWENTY-THREE\n\n\nThe Sentinels slouched in chairs, or sat on\nthe floor, backs against the walls of the small\nworkroom. Their faces reflected fatigue.\n\n\"About fleet capabilities for sustained combat,\"\nBrad said. \"I need a 'how goes it' on the status of\nyour evaluations. Give me a quick rundown and a\ndocumented report by the end of the day. Myra,\nyou first.\"\n\nMyra spoke from where she sat on a chair tilted\nagainst the wall.\n\n\"I had training facilities and systems, emergency\nmedical support, and general administrative backup.\nWhat I saw was guys and gals floundering around,\nleaning on each other, and making excuses. The\ntraining programs are antiquated; many aren't even\nremotely tied in with the equipment installed on\nships of the line. Equipment operators are learning\nby hit-or-miss, and they miss much too often.\nCan't blame them for low effectiveness because\nthe procedures are hazardous to their health. If\nwe don't improve the situation fast, the crews will\ndeteriorate to where they won't be worth a damn\nwhen the going gets even a mite rough.\"\n\nMyra paused, tipped her chair forward, crossed\nher arms, and gave Brad a hard look.\n\n\"I mean it, Brad. What's more, the medical backup\nfor combat support is atrocious. If we incur\ncasualties, the injured won't have much to\ndepend on, and if the troops have no faith in their\nmedics, their morale will drop, and I mean fast.\nThere goes your combat capability. For example,\nmedical supplies haven't been checked and updated\nfor years, if they were ever checked at all. They\ndon't know what they've got or where.\n\n\"The system needs a complete overhaul. I\nspot-checked the software and links on training,\nmedical, and administrative systems, and found them\nto be full of gaps and obsolete links and citations.\nMy report, Brad, is that these areas need one hell\nof a lot of work to get them up to even minimum\nstandards.\"\n\nMyra tipped her chair back until her head and\nshoulders touched the wall and she closed her\neyes. Her exhaustion was unmistakable.\n\n\"Document your findings, Myra,\" Brad said. \"I\nwant specific recommendations to deal with each\ndeficiency that you find, the name of the person\naccountable, and a list of the supplies, equipment\nand skills to clear the problem.\"\n\nTurning to the others, he added, \"That goes for\neveryone; there isn't much to work with, so be\nrealistic. If you report a problem, tell me how to\nfix it. If the shortages can't be filled, we might\nhave to take from one ship or facility to fix\nothers. Clear?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"OK, you're next, Zolan. What's the story on\ncommunications?\"\n\n\"The equipment is generally good. It all came\nfrom the Inner Region, and not very long ago. Part\nof what we have was taken in the raids on UIPS\nships; the rest is original equipment installed\nhere during the Slingshot build-up. Most of the\nspace-to-space systems are fully operational; there\nare some weaknesses in space-to-surface links.\"\n\n\"That part can be handled.\"\n\nZolan paused to nod at Myra.\n\n\"There's a 'but', though, and here's where I tie in\nwith Myra's findings on training. We've got a good\nsupply of comm spares, but not enough skills to do\nthe work. The comm folks can operate the equipment,\nno sweat there. The problem is that although\nmuch of the gear is self-repairing through built-in\nrobotics, when the robies themselves need fixing,\nno one knows how. Chain reaction; it won't take\nlong for subsystems to break down as the pressure\nof sustained ops builds. Barely enough maintenance\nrobots on each ship and station to keep the\nequipment working. The number of out-of-commission\nrobots is increasing steadily, and no one seems\nto know what to do about it. In time, this could\neasily lead to wide gaps in communications\ncapabilities.\"\n\n\"Do you know what to do about it?\" Brad asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Lay it out in your report. That's one area where\nwe can't afford any screw-ups. Adari, let's hear it\non ship's navigation systems and surface nav-aids.\"\n\n\"Well, Brad,\" Adari grinned, \"I had a nice summary\nall arranged in my mind, but I won't waste time\nby repeating what Zolan and Myra reported. Comm\nmaintenance also applies to nav, as does training\nand data. The equipment is good, but only because\nit's fairly new and is robotically self-maintained.\nBut nav robotics have no backups. Generally, when\nmaintenance robies need fixing the work's done\nby human specialists or other specialized robies.\nThey're not on board. Eventually, this fleet is\ngoing to be in a sad predicament: nav equipment\nwill go down with no way to get 'em back on line.\"\n\n\"How are you on fixing nav robots, Adari,\" Brad\nsmiled.\n\n\"I get by.\"\n\n\"Put that in your report, too.\" Brad turned to\nKumiko and nodded.\n\n\"Guns, power packs, tracking and fire-control\nsystems in fair shape. Ordnance controllers and\ngunners are a breed apart, especially when they're\ntaking care of their own, and even when working\nconditions are tight. They normally do most of\ntheir own maintenance. The guns are modern, and\nthere's a good supply of ready-to-install chargers.\nShip commanders exercise their gun crews frequently,\nand many have been on the raids, so they have ops\nexperience that the UIPS Space Force lacks. As\nfar as armaments go, this fleet will be a powerful\nadversary in any confrontation.\"\n\n\"Sounds encouraging,\" Brad said wryly. \"When\nyou prepare your report, just tell it like it is. A bit\nof good news would be welcome.\" Motioning to Hodak,\nhe added with a tight grin, \"Last, but not least,\nwhat's the situation on structures, facilities,\nenergy sources, and general logistical support.\"\n\nHodak, leaning against the wall, rubbed his bald\nspot and frowned.\n\n\"I ain't happy at all,\" he said. \"As I told you on\nthe Dragon, maintenance training of ships' crews\nis sloppy, and standards are either just not there\nor obsolete. We're working on the ops and logistical\nsupport checklists but they're still far from\ncompatible with facilities and installed systems.\nThese guys operate by the seat-of-their-pants.\nWhat's more, ship's structural and power plant\nrobies are down for maintenance half the time\nand spare parts are a mess. That also applies\nto surface shops and equipment.\n\n\"When ships are taken out of the line for repair,\nthe process is too damn long, mostly because of\nthe marginal and nonstandard support equipment.\nWe got a real problem here, Brad. The sooner we\nget on it the better.\"\n\nBrad leveled a finger at Hodak.\n\n\"I want you to include in your report a way to\nupdate direct support from surface shops. If we're\ngoing to do ourselves any good on this rim rock\none thing we can't afford is a fleet that can't stand\nup to a confrontation with the Inner Region. I'm not\nabout to be hauled back to that tin can Guardian\nStation to face escape charges. I don't think any\nof us want that.\"\n\nAdari and Hodak nodded; the rest sat motionless.\nAll looked somber.\n\nBrad stood. \"That's all for now. I'm going to give\nan oral report to Narval as soon as I can arrange\nto see him. He needs to issue a heads up with a\nwhip in his hands. Meanwhile, you all have jobs to\ndo. Be where I can reach you.\"\n\n ##\n\nNarval and Drummer turned away from the view tank\nin which they had observed Brad and heard his words\nand those of his cohorts.\n\n\"Well, what do you think?\" Narval bit into a\nfingernail.\n\n\"They raise valid issues, President Narval. If we\nare to challenge the UIPS military we certainly\ncan't do it with an inferior force. I think we\nshould listen carefully to what Brad suggests,\nand then, considering your objectives, adopt those\nideas that will assist you in attaining them.\"\n\n\"I will listen to Brad, Drummer,\" Narval said.\n\"Then, I will tell him to report the details of his\nfindings to you. I want you both to do what's\nnecessary to bring our military fleet to a high\nlevel of readiness. Prepare instructions to our\ncommanders for my signature. We must reach\nour maximum combat capability in the shortest\npossible time.\"\n\nNarval's eyes gleamed beady-bright.\n\n\"The shortest possible time. Did you hear me,\nDrummer?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. President, I heard you.\"\n\n\"I want to be informed, within the next one hundred\nhours, when you and Brad expect the fleet will\nbe ready for sustained operations, and I mean\n'combat readiness'. The names of ship and facility\ncommanders who do not cooperate with you or\nBrad will be reported to me immediately. Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Very well. Now, I have a special assignment for\nBrad. As soon as the two of you have the fleet\nupgrading program under way, I want Brad to conduct\na joint review with INOR military commanders to\nfind out what shape they're in for a confrontation\nwith the UIPS, should it come to that. I've already\ncommunicated with the heads of Outer Region\ngovernments, and they've agreed in principle to\na preliminary meeting. I've approved a meeting\nplace off Neptune; Scarf has the schedule and the\ncoordinates. He will accompany Brad as my Security\nrepresentative and sit in on all discussions. Tell\nBrad to use the Dragon for the mission and to chair\nthe meeting. Let the INOR people tour our ship; we\nmust give the impression of power. Any questions?\"\n\n\"Brad may need to reveal what he knows of plans\nto take the Depot.\"\n\n\"I want him to do just that early on in the\nmeeting. It will give them all a target against\nwhich to plan and integrate deployment schedules,\nvectors, tactics and combined operations.\nAnything else?\"\n\n\"No, President Narval.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter TWENTY-FOUR\n\n\nBrad stood beside Captain Crisper and surveyed\nthe scene in the tank on the Dragon's bridge. Scarf\nlounged in an accello-net within sight and sound,\nas he had for most of the voyage from Pluto.\n\nThe Dragon's pilot and communicator, upper bodies\ninsulated in instrumented cubicles, concentrated\non their tasks. Arms folded across his chest, Zolan\nstood along a bulkhead where his eyes could take\nin the full compartment without altering stance.\n\nAhead lay Triton in its retrograde orbit around\nNeptune. The moon's expanse was only partially\naccommodated by the tank. The Dragon's penetration\ninstruments revealed Triton's jagged peaks and\nchasms through vaporous nitrogen clouds. Steady,\nhigh-intensity beacons marked the location of\ndomed mine shafts that probed and sucked at the\nsatellite's core. A cluster of tank towns and their\noutriders rode the satellite's horizon.\n\nGleaming slivers separated from the surface,\nconverged, assumed an egg-shape and bloomed into\na flight of spacecraft. They formed up abreast\nfifty kilometers distant, facing the Dragon's bow.\n\nThe speaker above the communicator's enclosure\nbroke into the bridge's silence.\n\n\"Message from Captain Yargoul of the Jovian\nBattle Cruiser Windstorm to Captain Crisper of\nthe Plutonian Battle Cruiser Dragon.\"\n\nCaptain Crisper spoke without moving or taking\nhis eyes from the tank.\n\n\"The message.\"\n\n\"Greetings, Captain Crisper. I have been authorized\nby my President and the INOR representatives\nI am escorting to inform you that we are here in\nresponse to the invitation of your President. Is\nthe representative of your Government present?\"\n\nThe Captain glanced at Brad, who nodded. The\nresponse was released.\n\n\"Greetings from Captain Crisper to Captain Yargoul.\nMy government's representative, Commander Brad\nCurtin, is present and prepared to meet with you\nand your colleagues. Commander Curtin suggests\nthe meeting take place in the Command Conference\nRoom on board the Dragon as soon as the primary\nmembers are aboard. Is that agreeable?\"\n\nA short pause, then the reply \"Affirmative.\"\nShortly, utility boats cut away from the ships and\nconverged on the Dragon. Each utility maneuvered\nto synchronize axis and align portals. Precisely\npositioned, each vessel locked on in turn and\nextended ship-to-ship catwalks.\n\n ##\n\nThe Dragon's conference room hummed with the\nmurmur of the Dragon's seated guests when Brad\nentered and took his seat at the table. Zolan occupied\na seat against the bulkhead behind Brad, adjacent\na glowing view tank.\n\nScarf was there somewhere along the side, known\nand ignored; a security agent to peer over INOR\ncitizens' shoulders was normal.\n\nProfessionals long in their trade, they were battle\ncruiser and destroyer flotilla commanders of the\nmajor INOR powers, backed up by their experts\nin military intelligence, tactical operations, and\nnavigation, logistics and internal security. Brad's\nmeasure would be taken quickly, and his influence\nand INOR's decisions would depend on their\nassessments. He expected no less.\n\nBrad's eyes ranged the table, giving each face\nequal time. They returned his scrutiny, casual,\narrogant, challenging. It was his show, and his\nreputation.\n\nBrad did not rise to speak.\n\n\"I needn't introduce myself,\" he began. \"We've\nall done our homework I'm sure, and you know as\nmuch about me as I do about each of you. So, to\nbusiness.\"\n\nZolan rose, drew an instrumented rod from its niche\nat the base of the tank and brought up the quadrant\nthat depicted the Special Zone. Manipulating keys\nalong the rod, eyes on the tank, Zolan quickly\nbrought the Logistics Depot in toward the core\nand increased magnification so that it occupied\nmost of the tank space.\n\n\"The objective,\" Brad said, his voice flat and low.\n\nA long silence, then from the far end of the table,\n\"What the hell does that mean?\"\n\n\"Just that. We're going to take it.\"\n\nA gasp, this time from his left, followed by, \"You\nguys are out of your minds.\"\n\nFeet shuffled on the grav-plates. Several among the\nseated were arranging themselves to rise and depart.\n\nBrad waited.\n\nThe shuffling stopped. They were here to listen,\nnot to commit.\n\nBrad leaned forward, placed his forearms on the\ntable, one hand over the other. His steady eyes\nmoved from one face to the next.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"we're not out of our minds. We can\ndo it, and our losses can be kept within acceptable\nlimits if we work together. Furthermore, the Depot\ncan be taken with minimum damage to its structures\nand to its Slingshot stores.\"\n\n\"What's the point?\"\n\nBrad looked at the questioner, a big man in a black\nand gray uniform and a soft helmet liner perched\non the back of his head. Brad knew him through the\nphys-psy profiles he had studied before the meeting.\n\n ##\n\n\"Captain Yargoul,\" Brad said, \"sooner or later the\nUIPS must accept that they no longer have mastery\nof space beyond the Belt.\"\n\nAltering his tone to include all, he continued, \"I\nneedn't dwell on the obvious: our collective forces\nand Slingshot's distance from the UIPS places\nus in a far stronger position than we thought we\nwould be at this time. I emphasize collective. On\nour own, any of us, individually as nations or in an\nalliance of satellites, wouldn't stand long against\nan organized assault by a UIPS battle fleet. But,\ncollectively, we will not only resist them, we will\nwin and take back full control of space throughout\nthe Outer Region.\"\n\nEyes cold, voice gritty as space-sand, Brad tapped\nthe tabletop.\n\n\"Having the power isn't enough. We've got to show\nit, and make it credible. Planet Pluto demonstrated\nwhat can be done with real power during Operation\nTornado Six. I'm sure you're all familiar with that\nlittle exercise, and have studied the tactics.\"\n\nClosed faces. The silence was broken with low but\naudible, \"So have their tac ops people.\"\n\n\"Right, and we think they've concluded that\nINOR is in a strong position to run its territories\nand voids without any more interference from\nthem. Also, that we can devise tactics and take\ninitiatives that put them off balance and upset\ntheir Slingshot schedule. What we did in our\nlegally contiguous space can be repeated elsewhere.\nThe result is the end of UIPS dominance over its\nformer colonies and space lanes.\"\n\nBrad paused to preface his next words.\n\n\"You can continue to accept invasive UIPS traffic\nthrough your territorial and contiguous zones. You\ncan do the same for their uninvited presence in\nyour Exclusive Economic Zones even though the\nLaws of the Seas Conventions over the past several\nmillennia expanded treaties to include or affirm\neach independent nation's rights. Or you can align\nwith Planet Pluto, which is your right as a free\nand independent nation. Together -- collectively --\nwe can demand that the UIPS acknowledge INOR's\njurisdiction in the Outer Region. INOR can back\ntheir demands with military power that the UIPS\ncan no longer ignore.\"\n\nThere was a long silence, followed by, \"What does\nthe Log Depot have to do with it?\"\n\n\"First, it's the closest, most politically\nvulnerable target within INOR's legitimate\nboundaries and jurisdictions. Second, control\nof the Depot equates to a strangle hold over\nconstruction progress and launch of the Slingshot\nterminals -- which is life-or-death for the UIPS.\"\n\n\"...and not for the rest of us?\"\n\n\"Not for centuries. If it ever really came to sheer\nsurvival, we'll outlast the UIPS. When they collapse\nwe can move in and feed off their carcasses for\na thousand years, if we have to. Meanwhile, we'll\ntake over Slingshot and have it ready for the next\nlaunch window.\"\n\nA hard-visaged warrior leaned forward in his\nchair, and shook his head slowly. \"You're a callous\nson-of-a-bitch, Commander Curtin,\" he said,\ndirecting his eyes directly at Brad.\n\n\"Maybe so. I'm also a realist. If we play the game\nright, and show a united front, this confrontation\nwon't escalate to major military actions. The UIPS\nhas got to cross our space, there's no other way.\nTake the depot and we can force them to finish\nSlingshot, but with INOR playing a major role.\nIt'll take some negotiating, but it's not likely\nthat they'll shut down Slingshot.\"\n\n\"How will you take the Depot?\"\n\n\"You mean, how will we take the Depot?\nUnfortunately, we can't repeat Tornado Six. That\nwas a crisis we manufactured and ran all the way,\na one-shot operation. We've come up with another\nstrategy to take the Depot, and that's what this\nmeeting is about. You're all in on the action.\"\n\n\"This is the first I've heard the Depot is to be\ntaken,\" said Captain Yargoul, looking around.\n\"What about the rest of you? Have your\ngovernments cleared this as a joint operation?\"\n\nHeads shook in the negative accompanied by\nshrugs and grunts. Unanimous.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter TWENTY-FIVE\n\n\nBrad leaned back in his chair both hands pressed\nagainst the table's edge, arms straight.\n\n\"Your governments have agreed to a united front\nagainst the UIPS, otherwise you wouldn't be here.\nYour Heads of State sent you. We're military men,\nnot politicians or clever diplomats. What does that\ntell you?\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Then I'll say it. We're here to plan a military\naction. That's what we do. The decision on whether\nthe plan is implemented is up to INOR politicians\nand diplomats. That's how they earn their keep. The\ntarget has been made known to you. Our immediate\ntask is to assess the forces we will have available\nand operational to do the job. For that I need to\nknow your capabilities, now and for the time they\nwill be committed to the combined operations.\nLet's start with the Jovian System.\"\n\nBrad fixed his eyes on Captain Yargoul.\n\nTime stretched, no one moved. Finally, at a nod\nfrom Captain Yargoul, a gaunt spacer seated behind\nhim reached into a pocket, withdrew a capsule and\ntossed it toward the front. It floated gracefully\nat Zolan in the light gravity. Zolan caught the\ncapsule, turned, inserted it into a slot at the\nbase of the tank and pressed a key on the rod.\n\nThe tank shimmered, cleared, and in rapid\nsuccession flashed images of battle cruisers,\ndestroyers and support ships. Data unreeled\nacross the lower section of the tank, listing\nship's armament and ship's readiness rating.\n\nThe recording completed, Zolan withdrew the capsule\nand returned it in the same manner as received.\nAnother floated toward him, preceded by a growl\n\"Titan.\" The routine repeated, and within a short\ntime, the major INOR platforms and weapons for\na combined assault on the Logistics Depot had\nbeen recorded and rated for readiness.\n\nWhen the last capsule had cleared the tank Zolan's\nfingers raced across the console's keypad and the\nscreen recapped the inputs. The Logistics Depot\nreappeared high up in the tank wrapped in its\nprotective cocoon, and lines of transports loading\nand off-loading cargoes or waiting their turns.\n\nThe scene contracted, and the vacated space filled\nwith numbers and codes representing the few UIPS\nrecon-patrollers in the Plutonian sector followed\nby a tabulation of INOR's combined assault fleet.\nThe computer presented INOR's combined fleet's\nOrder of Battle, and stabilized.\n\nThe assembled commanders, master strategists\nand tacticians all, pointed, commented, and proposed\noptions on the employment of ships, formations\nand weapons. Zolan keyed their suggestions into\nthe computer and the results appeared in the tank.\nFinally, there were no further options. Brad nodded.\n\n\"Mark it and distribute a copy to each Commander\npresent,\" he said, and turned back to survey the\ngroup around the table. He waited.\n\nCaptain Yargoul cut the brief silence.\n\n\"What we have, so far, is a textbook tactical\ndisposition of forces around a theoretical\nobjective. The reality will depend on the strategic\nplan for the operation and what we expect will\ncome out of it. When do we get to that?\"\n\nBrad grinned.\n\n\"That will be made known to you at the appropriate\ntime.\"\n\n ##\n\nBrad and Zolan walked silently down the ramp from\nthe Condor and boarded the outbound strip. Skirting\nknots of commuters they faced outward in a\nmomentarily vacant slot for two along the edge of\nthe fast moving lane. Opportune and random, the\nlocation was as secure as any from eavesdropping.\n\n\"I briefed Narval an hour ago,\" said Brad. \"He's\ncertain that he can get the INOR leaders to join\nfor a healthy share in the prize. I've been ordered\nto plan for a combined operation to take the depot.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"He's sitting on that. What he wants from me\nnow is to portray an integrated assault by INOR\ncombined forces from a point halfway between\nthe depot and the Slingshot construction site.\nI'm to work out the details and keep each element\non a timeline from launch to full military control\nof the objective.\"\n\n\"Doesn't that strike you as odd?\"\n\n\"Talk to me.\"\n\n\"Setting the launch point against the depot\nfrom a couple of million kay outbound from the\nPlutonian orbit doesn't make sense. It's especially\nsuspicious when you consider that the INOR forces\nwill be coming from sunside of Pluto and therefore\nsunside of the depot -- the presumed target less\nthan a half million kay from here. Why not have\nthe fleet rendezvous closer to the target?\"\n\n\"My question, precisely.\"\n\n\"How do you see it?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure yet. Narval did say to crank in\ndiversionary tactics that would draw the Terminals'\ndefensive forces away from their normal ops zone.\"\n\n\"That's weird.\"\n\n\"Agreed. He's setting it up this way to maximize\nhis options, he says. The final decision, he said,\nneedn't be made until the final moments. Confuse\nthe enemy and all that.\"\n\n\"Are you saying the same plan can be used against\nthe Terminals?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. Oh, a few formation and tactical\nswitches but they can be made in the field as\nthe fleet switches targets.\"\n\n\"Would it work?\"\n\n\"A bit of delay, but I'm sure it would. But at\nwhichever target Narval's final order sends the\nfleet, the results would be a disaster for the\nUIPS. The real target's spunnel lines will crash,\ndestabilization will disrupt the entire Slingshot\nconstruction schedule. We'll have lost the launch\nwindow.\"\n\nMore commuters swung aboard the strip and\ncrowded their space. Brad and Zolan eyed them;\ntime to split.\n\n\"What now?\", Zolan asked.\n\n\"Not much choice.\" Brad replied in a whisper. \"Use\nthe depot spunnel facility to get word to Ram.\nDon't take any nonsense about getting to Hanno.\nOnce you're through to him, you shouldn't have\nan access problem. So get to the depot, shoot the\nburst, and get back here without being spotted.\"\n\n\"The message?\"\n\n\"Narval's instructions to me. Everything we learned\nat the meeting off Neptune, especially the Order of\nBattle capsule with the options on formations for\nthe combined fleet. List the types of weapons and\nwarheads installed on each INOR ship of the line\nand the coordinates for rendezvous and launch\nat the depot as the target.\n\n\"That'll get them as suspicious as we are. Crank\nin what the coordinates might be if Narval makes\nlast minute switches. Point Icarus is the designated\ncode name for the INOR rendezvous. Include that.\nTell Ram I said to get his fighting folks off their\nbutts and earn their keep.\"\n\nBrad shifted, stepped over to a slower lane, and\nfrom there off the strip. He disappeared among\nthe pedestrians. Zolan remained where he was for\na distance, disembarked and strolled about near\nan air lock as he mind-impressed his message on\na comm capsule.\n\nColonel Hanno will be surprised, Zolan mused\nas he pushed his way into the suiting-up room.\nContemplating his mission, it might take a bit of\ntime for Hanno to respond and track the code,\ninterpret the instructions, and acknowledge what\nthey required of him. He would need to push Hanno\nhard.\n\nHe selected and checked a suit for fit, fresh\nfluids, air and communications. Climbing in and\nclosing up, he stepped under a helmet rack, drew it\ndown, rotated mating surfaces, closed and locked\nthe seals. The automatic self-test devices hummed\npressure checks, and indicators glowed as the\nlife support systems balanced internally. The suit\ninflated, held for several seconds, and subsided to\nnormal. A tiny light above the inside visor glowed\ngreen to show status as ready.\n\nPassing through the outer air lock Zolan turned\ntoward a line of flitters. A guard watched him\napproach, rifle held casually across his chest.\n\n\"OK,\" said the guard when Zolan was within five\nmeters. \"Hold it there. What's on your mind?\"\n\n\"Name's Zolan. I need a long range flitter for a\nhop into the outback.\"\n\n\"Let's see your authorization.\"\n\n\"What authorization?\"\n\nThe guard's head wagged in his helmet.\n\n\"Y'gotta have authorization for a distant\ndestination, buddy. That's orders. Otherwise,\ntake a taxi.\"\n\n\"Orders, hell,\" Zolan growled. \"I can't get where I\nhave to go using a taxi. I can't do my work with you\nsecurity types puttin' the chocks to me for 'orders'\neach time I need to check a work site.\" His tone\nbecame scathing. \"Get your superior on-line and\ntell him my name and what I want. If he has any\nquestions, tell him to check with Brad Curtin on\nPresident Narval's staff. C'mon now. Move, man,\nmove.\"\n\nThe guard's manner changed with the name-dropping.\n\n\"Yes sir,\" he said. \"Right away, sir.\"\n\nZolan's comm contact with the guard went on hold\nas the guard switched to another line. Ignoring the\nguard, Zolan surveyed several nearby utilities.\n\nMoments later his line with the guard reopened.\nThe guard's voice was deferential.\n\n\"Clearance received, sir,\" he said. \"Got a real\ngood single-seater here for you. Just came out\nof the maintenance shops. All systems have been\nchecked and she's ready to go. Shall I warm her\nup and crank in the coordinates for you, sir?\"\n\n\"That's OK,\" Zolan replied, \"I'll do the set ups\nmyself. I've got several places to visit and want\nto work out the trip on the box so I don't waste\nany more time. Which bird?\"\n\n\"Follow me, sir.\"\n\nMoving along the line the guard stopped at a\nlow-slung framework from which a crude cage hung\nsuspended, held in position by braces angling in\nfrom connecting structures. Behind the cage,\nhalfway along a shaft running aft, hung a tiny\nnuclear power plant. Nozzles of cone-shaped\npropulsion units on gimbals hung in neutral.\nThat would change as soon as Zolan inserted his\ncoordinates and activated the thrusters.\n\n\"Here she is, sir,\" the guard exclaimed, proudly,\noffering Zolan a checklist. \"All yours.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Zolan grunted. Shifting his eyes\ncritically from the checklist to flitter and back,\nhe walked around the tiny flyer inspecting the\nspars for alignment and cracks. Moving to the\npower plant he examined the reactor's cover\nand seals for seepage and the thruster nozzles and\ngimbals for cracks and wear. Finally, satisfied after\nscrutinizing the instrument panel, he stepped back,\ninitialed the checklist and handed it to the guard.\n\n\"Looks OK on the outside,\" he said. \"I'll check out\nthe warm up. If it cooks OK, I'm out of your way.\"\n\nHe squeezed into the cage, set and activated the\nreactor. Observing the power levels rise on the\ngauges, his fingers stroked the flitter's keys\nand levers. He tapped his coordinates into the\nnav-comp as the plant warmed.\n\nThe guard moved closer.\n\n\"Know how to set her? Maybe I can help, sir.\"\n\nHe stuck his head into the crowded space and\nwatched the computer screen flip through the\ncoordinates that Zolan inserted. The screen\nstabilized and reflected a series of vectors.\nThe guard studied them. Zolan ignored him.\n\nZolan adjusted the torso belts and rechecked\nthe reactor and weight-and-balance indicators.\nHe heaved a heavy sigh.\n\n\"Well, time to hit the road,\" he said. \"Stand back,\nman, I'm taking her up.\"\n\nThe guard stepped back and saluted. Zolan moved\nthe power lever and directional controls. The\nframework and cage quivered and the flitter lifted\nup and away.\n\nLooking down, Zolan saw the guard bending backward,\nwatching his direction of flight.\n\n\"Hope he got them all down right,\" he thought as he\nentered new data into the computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter TWENTY-SIX\n\n\nZolan peered ahead. Reaching the depot's perimeter\nwas less of a problem than he had anticipated.\nFollowing a few short stops to surface stations\nto inspect military tunnels and comm links, and\nvalidate the flitter's flight record, he diverted\nto a depression between Coldfield and the horizon.\nResetting coordinates had taken seconds. Resuming\nflight, he quickly merged for a short distance with\na queue of tugs and taxis along a crowded lane, then\nveered sharply up toward the Logistics Depot.\n\nBlending his flitter's comm with the flood of\nelectronic signals from nearby tugs and transports\nat the Gateway, Zolan drew closer to the huge\nDepot and took shelter in a knot of lashed vessels.\nTaking several deep breaths, he fixed his eyes and\nmind on the depot. Concentrating, he constricted\nand relaxed his neck and shoulder muscles in an\nirregular pattern, and repeated the rhythm until it\ninvoked a slight pressure high in his left shoulder.\nThe stresses energized the short-range sending\ndevice implanted in him prior to the Sentinel's\nescape.\n\nHis words, inaudible beyond his voice box, opened\ncontact with the depot's command post.\n\n\"Calling Ditch-digger,\" he intoned. \"Ditch-digger,\nrefer to your k-library program file 6756, and\nrespond on Bootstrap.\"\n\nHe repeated the message and waited. It would take\ntime for the comm technician on duty to work it\nout. The communications staff would scurry about,\nsearching for the program. Restricted to Sentinel,\nthis contact would be its initial activation.\n\nThe receiver in his ear whispered, \"This is\nDitch-digger in Bootstrap. Continue.\"\n\n\"Ditch-digger. Scramble 16.\"\n\nZolan hunched and tightened his shoulders to switch\nchannels.\n\nThe voice came through. \"Done.\"\n\n\"I want to speak with Colonel Hanno.\"\n\n\"One moment, please.\"\n\nA short pause.\n\n\"Hanno.\"\n\n\"This is a Sentinel call. Break the seal on your\ncopy of the Sentinel Support Plan and refer to\nAnnex C, Section 21, line numbers 416 to 422.\nNote the encryption structure. I will cite the line\nin the structure that authenticates my request\nfor support. Waiting.\"\n\nMinutes passed. Breaking the seal on the highest\nclassification Sentinel Support Plan was a grave\nresponsibility that Hanno would not take lightly.\nHe would need to do it in the station's security\nvault with no witnesses present. The comm center\nwould then need to be cleared of personnel other\nthan Hanno before the exchange could proceed.\nFinally, the receiver whispered again.\n\n\"I have the lines you refer to. Continue.\"\n\n\"Note how the authenticator is to be stated,\"\nZolan said.\n\nHe rattled off a sequence of numbers, letters\nand symbols. Injecting a short, prescribed silence,\nhe spun off another set. The authenticator was\nin two parts, each requiring its own style for\npresentation.\n\n\"Authenticator confirmed,\" Hanno said after a\npause. \"State request?\"\n\n\"I'm in a flitter near the Gateway,\" Zolan said.\n\"Request permission to come aboard and have\nunattended access to the spunnel transmitter\nfor about five minutes. I will then depart.\"\n\n\"Permission granted. Do you wish an escort from\nyour present position to the dock?\"\n\n\"Yes, please send an unarmed tug to lead me through\nthe gate, match me up, and point me at the dock. Tug\noperator and anyone else that observes my presence\nor the flitter must not repeat must not log the\nserial number of my flitter or any of its features.\nClear all your people to beyond five meters in all\ndirection from the passageways I'll be using, and\nfrom the spunnel comm center. I am armed with\na hand weapon set for maximum effect without\ncollateral damage to non-organics. My mission\nrequires such precautions. Do you accept these\nconditions?\"\n\n\"I accept.\"\n\n\"Noted. Have an unarmed guide at the air lock to\nprecede me to the spunnel console. Instruct him to\nnot speak to me, no questions, and to not interfere\nin any manner in what I do. When I've completed\nmy work in the comm room the guide is to lead me\nback to the air lock. The same tug is then to get\nme through the Gateway, same conditions, and I'll\nbe out of your way. When I'm gone conduct your\nhighest-level UIPS security briefing. This mission\nis classified UIPS Black. Understood?\"\n\n\"Understood. Ready?\"\n\n\"Ready. I am moving toward the Gateway and will be\nthere in two minutes. Have your man flash his reds\nand greens at one-second intervals. I will respond\nwith standard flitter yellows at the same spacing.\nOver. Out.\"\n\nZolan carefully adjusted the controls to slip the\nflitter away from the screening vessels. Clear,\nhe maneuvered his craft close to a space buoy\nthat marked the route through Fandango.\n\nA yellow-green striped tug appeared in the distance\nand grew larger. The Gateway's diameter could expand\nto pass the largest freighters or close completely.\nIt could be straight or as convoluted as a randomly\nconfigured corkscrew. The tug passed through,\nflashing the agreed-on signals.\n\nZolan responded. The tug stopped, reversed heading,\nand waited for him to line up. Inside the force\nfield, the route took them over, under and around\nhuge freighters and through swarms of shuttles,\ntugs, and barges. Five hundred meters from the\ndepot Zolan pressed a disk on his control column\nand a mag beam reached out and locked on to the tug.\n\nThe tug's thrusters glowed brighter with the power\nto match up both craft. Aligned, Zolan released the\ntug, and gentling his thrusters, brought his flitter\nto rest on a landing platform that had articulated\nfrom a portal.\n\nSpace suit closed and glare screens partially\nactivated to veil his features, Zolan strode the\nDepot's corridors behind his escort. Although he\nhad docked at the portal nearest his destination,\nthe spunnel console was still almost a quarter kay\nfrom the air lock.\n\nReaching the console chamber, Zolan motioned his\nguide to wait outside. He entered and inspected\nthe area for intruders and bugs. It seemed secure.\n\nApproaching the squat spunnel transmitter he noted\nthat Hanno had activated the system for immediate\nuse and disengaged all logs and file-for-record\nlinks. Confirming the disconnect, Zolan wasted\nno time in preliminaries. Inserting the capsule he\nkeyed the transmitter to the channels assigned\nto Sentinel and set off his burst.\n\nThe transmitter was a model that dated back several\ncenturies to the depot's construction. Zolan knew\nfrom his training for the mission that a spunnel\nburst from the depot had to be arranged in parts.\nEach segment was to be inserted separately into\nthe spunnel dispatch slot. The ancient transmitter\ncould process only so much at a bite.\n\nZolan held the final segment and reached to insert\nit. A couple of seconds and the transmission would\nbe complete. The console was coded to dissolve\nthe capsule immediately following the burst; there\nwould be no residue.\n\nZolan bent to insert the end of the message.\n\nSensing movement behind him, he slipped sideways\nand hit the deck. Without warning and in the\nline-of-fire, the squat console disintegrated as\na rending flash arced across to where he had been\na fraction of second before. Off balance, twisting\nto face the door, Zolan drew his weapon.\n\nThe flash blinded him. His suit shielded him\nagainst the instant hell-fire that bounced off\nthe console.\n\nSilence followed the attacker's second shot. Zolan\ncrouched, weapon extended, vision clearing. No\nfurther shots. Snapping a quick glance around, he\ntook in the damage. The console was a melted lump\nand the room a shambles. He had to get out and away.\n\nUp on his feet, he raced through the open doorway,\ngun raised. His escort to the comm room lay\nspread-eagled in the corridor, head burned to a\ncrisp by what must have been a max shot. The\ncorridor was empty.\n\n\"They cleared the area of everyone but the killer,\"\nhe thought bitterly.\n\nHaving committed the route to memory as he followed\nthe escort to the spunnel room, Zolan raced along\nthe corridors, gun in hand. No one barred his way.\n\nThe air lock came in view. He hurried through and\ntwisted into the flitter driver's cage. He cut the\nmag beam to the dock and signaled the waiting tug.\n\n ##\n\nThey met on the transit strip.\n\nStanding close, facing off the strip, observant,\nZolan briefed Brad in quick, terse phrases.\n\n\"What's your assessment?\" Brad asked when\nZolan finished.\n\n\"It was a long, straight corridor. The escort must\nhave been shot from the bend some distance away.\nDamage to the comm room was extensive. Scarf\nmust have an agent there. My having the area\ncleared alerted him. That brought on the attack.\"\n\n\"Did you get word to Hanno?\"\n\n\"No. It would have raised questions I couldn't\nanswer without breaking our cover. He'll have\nto figure it out for himself. I'm concerned about\nwhat the agent will report to his control.\"\n\n\"Whatever they conclude, the action eliminates\nthe depot as a comm resource for us. Did you\nget the entire message on its way?\"\n\n\"I don't know. The last fragment included the Point\nIcarus coordinates.\"\n\nTheir eyes met.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter TWENTY-SEVEN\n\n\nPresident Camari stonily contemplated the\nincomplete communication and turned to Intelligence\nDirector Dynal. Ram sat immobile, nearby.\n\n\"Allen?\" Camari's raised brows posed his question.\n\n\"We couldn't get through directly to Hanno to find\nout why the message was cut short. So we went\nspunnel to the Terminals and patched in to the\nDepot on coded conventional. Hanno reports his\nspunnel transmitter was destroyed. He was certain\nhe was hoodwinked into permitting a saboteur aboard\nand screamed about a security breach on the Sentinel\nSupport Plan. He said the 'saboteur' escaped before\nthe alarm could be acted on. A damned lucky delay,\nI think.\"\n\n\"Did you enlighten Hanno?\"\n\n\"No, sir. Too risky for Sentinel, and he has no\nneed-to-know. I did tell him to run deep background\nchecks and truth verification tests on all Depot\npersonnel. He objected, thinking he had already\npinpointed the culprit. I told him to do it anyhow,\nslap into the brig anyone who didn't pass,\nand report the results to me under highest\nclassification through the construction site's\nspunnel center.\"\n\n\"Good. No question they've been infiltrated. We\nmust consider the depot compromised for classified\nuntil Hanno assures us he's cleared the problem\nfrom his facility.\"\n\nThe President touched a button on his desk,\nrunning the message through again in its entirety.\nHe switched the screen dark.\n\n\"The Outer Region's target might be the depot,\nbut I wonder.\" Ram said. \"Perhaps destroying\nthe depot's spunnel transmitter is prelude to\nan attack. If it is, they must realize that the\nincident set off alarms throughout our defenses.\nThey'll also know we can maintain spunnel contact\nand relay messages to and from our patrollers\nand other craft through the construction site.\"\n\n\"Considering Hanno's report on what happened,\nthe attack on his spunnel transmitter focused on\nkeeping this message from getting through, not to\nmerely destroy the machine. That alone would not\nhave been worth the effort.\"\n\n\"We're down to one comm spunnel link in the Special\nZone,\" Dynal added. \"The one we built on Planet\nPluto is controlled by Narval's people.\"\n\n\"Does Sentinel have access to the transmitter at\nthe Terminals?\"\n\n\"The sender would need to personally key in\nthe clearances as well as the text,\" said Ram,\n\"otherwise the message would be compromised.\nSentinel would be compromised. We do have the\nlast resort.\"\n\n\"Have you checked it lately?\"\n\n\"We run random tests from this end to be certain\nthat it's ready to function. As you know, sir, it\nhas its uncertainties and imposes a high price.\"\n\n\"Back to the message,\" Camari sighed and rubbed\nhis temple gently as he pondered. \"Their combined\nforces, and the distances involved, place us at an\nenormous disadvantage.\"\n\n\"Without question.\"\n\n\"Ram, what's your estimate concerning the missing\npiece?\" Camari pointed to the message in his hand.\n\n\"The missing piece,\" Ram replied, \"the one we need\nmost is Sentinel's assessment on where and when\nwe can strike at INOR's fleet with maximum effect.\"\n\n\"Depends entirely on Sentinel? No other sources?\"\n\n\"At this stage, none, sir.\"\n\nCamari lowered his head, lost in thought. After\na moment he raised his eyes to Ram and said,\n\"We've got to get our thinking through to the Outer\nRegion, to all citizens as well as Heads of State.\n\n\"I want you to get out there, Ram. Be my emissary.\nImpress on whoever will listen the disaster\nthat all of us face, and why we must arrive at a\npeaceful solution. Concentrate on the leaders of\nmajor nations; whichever way they go, others will\nfollow.\"\n\n\"I'll need the formal weight of our government,\"\nRam said.\n\n\"Of course. I'll notify them all that you are my\nAmbassador Plenipotentiary, and that you carry\na personal message from me. Use the spunnel\nand send me reports as you go along.\"\n\n\"Narval, too?\"\n\n\"Of course. And while you're in his area, learn all\nyou can from whatever sources; but watch yourself\nwith that bastard. He'd as soon cut your throat as\nlook at you.\"\n\n ##\n\n\"Category one message, spunnel-comm to Earth via\nGuardian Station 4. Personal to President Camari\nfrom Ram Xindral. President Gelliman, Callisto,\nunchanged in his conviction that Slingshot\nwill benefit only the highly industrialized inner\nplanets. He repeated charges that the UIPS\nnon-renewables deficits resulted from poor control\nand excessive consumption of raw materials, plus\nbreakdown in recycling and conservation policies.\nHe concluded that Slingshot is our internal problem\nand that it's being forced on INOR. Demands UIPS\nhalt Slingshot construction, withdraw from the\nSpecial Zone, and resolve UIPS resource crises\ninternally.\"\n\n ##\n\n\"Category one message, spunnel to Earth via\nGuardian Station 4. Personal to President Camari\nfrom Ram Xindral. Prime Minister Manra, Io, says he\nwishes us well in building a bridge to another star.\nHe makes an issue that transportation, construction\nand operations for all phases of Slingshot,\nincluding ultimate storage of incoming raw matter\nwill be inside INOR jurisdictions; therefore, the\nINOR governments have a legitimate right to\nparticipate in apportioning Slingshot's benefits.\nRefuses to negotiate this point.\"\n\n ##\n\n\"Category one message, spunnel to Earth via\nGuardian Station 7. Personal to President Camari\nfrom Ram Xindral. Foreign Ministers Roab of\nGanymede and Slega of Europa represented their\ngovernments. At conclusion of meeting they issued\na joint communique. Quote: it is only reasonable and\nproper that the governments of the Outer Region not\nbe excluded from an equitable share of the enormous\nfinancial and material resources being lavished\non the Interstellar Matter Teleport System\n(Slingshot). The UIPS can begin to remedy this\ninjustice by agreeing to pay a transshipment tax\non all materials, manufactured parts, tools and\nequipment, and personnel passing through the\nseparate INOR jurisdictions, space-ways, and\ncontiguous space generally. Passage fees\nfor individual vessels in transit also must be\nnegotiated and included in the agreement. Unquote.\n\n\"It is my opinion that the positions taken by\nthe governments of the Jovian Federation\nare orchestrated. I suspect that reports on\nmy discussions with Heads of State or their\nrepresentatives are being passed among them.\nI am departing for Titan to meet with Chairman\nStabar. The Chiefs of Staff of the other Saturnian\ngovernments and the governments of the Uranus\nand Neptune satellite unions have notified me that\ntheir views are consistent with those of Chairman\nStraber. They state nothing is to be gained by\npressing for separate meetings with them.\"\n\n ##\n\n\"Category one message, spunnel to Earth via\nGuardian Station 9. Personal to President Camari\nfrom Ram Xindral. Chairman Staber's position is the\nsame as those summarized in my previous reports.\nStaber openly proclaims that INOR's intent is to\ncontrol the terminal that will receive and store\nincoming substance and oversee its distribution.\nInsists a formal treaty be negotiated now,\notherwise, the entire Slingshot Program will\nbe viewed as a threat to the integrity of INOR's\nlegitimate jurisdictions. I am proceeding to the\nPlanet Pluto Special Zone and will contact Narval\nfrom inside the Logistics Depot's protective\nforce field. I will insist on President Narval's\nguarantee of safe conduct prior to departing\nthe depot for Coldfield.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter TWENTY-EIGHT\n\n\nRam entered the Log Depot's conventional\ncommunications center and nodded to the young\noperator.\n\n\"Make the contact,\" he said, adding, \"Relay the\nmessage through one of the transports; delete all\nreferences that show this facility is in the loop.\"\n\nSwitches snapped as the operator nodded. His hands\nsped across the keypad. A few moments passed and\nhis voice issued as an electronic whisper.\n\n\"Calling Planet Pluto Comm Center. This is the UIPS\nTransport Akiba, Call Sign 943 dash 792. We have a\nPriority One message for your government. Stand by\nto record. Acknowledge.\"\n\nA slight crackle.\n\n\"This is Planet Pluto Comm Center to Call Sign 943\ndash 792. We are ready to record. Go ahead.\"\n\nRam drew a small plastic card from the breast\npocket of his tunic and handed it to the operator.\nWithout glancing at the card the operator slipped\nit into a slot in the console. A light on the panel\nblinked on and off and the card ejected. The\noperator returned it to Ram with a single motion\nand a smile.\n\n\"Message dispatched, sir.\"\n\n ##\n\nNarval pushed the message aside and away. Face\nflushed in anger, he stared at Drummer.\n\n\"What do you make of it?\"\n\n\"The message is less than straightforward, Mr.\nPresident,\" Drummer replied. \"Ambassador Xindral\nseemingly appeals for an audience with you to\ndiscuss matters of interest to both his government\nand ours. The suggested agenda it carries, however,\nputs us on the defensive with barely room for\nreasoning with his government. He asks for a\nguarantee of safe conduct. As a legally constituted\ngovernment in a community of nations, and in\nthe absence of, shall we say, formal military\nhostilities, such a request is not only\nunnecessary, it is an affront. I suspect, Mr.\nPresident, that the Ambassador's motives are to\nplace you at a disadvantage.\"\n\n\"I agree.\"\n\n\"His distrust of us is evident in the manner in\nwhich the message was routed. Transmitted from\na cargo transporter off the depot's force field,\nno less. His personal vessel must be somewhere in\nthe pack up there, but he obviously intends to keep\nit hidden. Very unseemly for a formal visit by an\nAmbassador.\"\n\n\"Your recommendations?\"\n\nDrummer paused, and spoke slowly, carefully.\n\n\"Consider the facts: his tour of the Outer Region\nwas preceded by a personal message from Camari\nto Chiefs of State. He has had audiences with INOR\nPresidents or Ministers. They have informed you of\ntheir replies to his appeals. Those who declined to\nmeet with him took the course they did because\nthey had nothing to add to what had already been\nstated by the others.\n\n\"Because of your initiatives, President Narval, you\nare central among the INOR leaders in pressing the\nissues between the Regions. Refusing to see him\nmay be interpreted by our colleagues in INOR as a lack\nof conviction in our cause, or even as weakness. My\nrecommendation is that you see him, but manipulate\nthe discussions to give our rights dominance.\nInsofar as 'safe conduct', I suggest we ignore the\ninsult, grant him permission to visit our planet,\nand wish him a pleasant stay.\"\n\nNarval drummed on the desk, pushed at the message\nagain, and shifted about. He was uncomfortable.\n\n\"I'll think about it, Drummer,\" he said.\n\"Meanwhile, extend the invitation, set up suitable\nquarters for him away from our official guest\nhouse, meet him when he arrives, and so on. Have\nhim stand by. When I decide on the approach to\nthe discussions, I'll let you know whether I'll meet\nwith him.\"\n\n ##\n\n\"Well, Scarf, have you finished reading that\nthing?\" Narval impatiently bit a fingernail.\n\n\"Yessir, Mr. President.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"What the hell do you mean by 'sir'? I asked for\nyour opinion, dammit.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, he asks for an audience with you...\"\n\nNarval sighed. \"Don't just repeat the message,\nScarf. Tell me what you know of this man.\"\n\nScarf's face lost its embarrassed flush and he\nhastily pulled a reader device from his pocket.\nStriking a series of keys, Scarf peered closely\nat the screen. He pointed to the reader as\nverification for his words.\n\n\"Ambassador Xindral is a senior Intelligence\nOfficer assigned to Slingshot. That's about all\nwe've got on him. Definitely not a run-of-the-mill\ndiplomatic type.\"\n\n\"That's what concerns me, Scarf. I'm highly\nsuspicious of his motives even if Camari did notify\nus in advance. Intelligence officer, indeed. If he\nbecomes aware of our preparations and reports\nback, our plans will be jeopardized. Drummer wants\nme to see him. I don't want to be in the same room\nwith this person. Yet I can't refuse without losing\nface. Now, get me out of this, Scarf.\"\n\n\"How far can I go, Mr. President?\"\n\n\"As far as you like, just keep me out of it.\"\n\nScarf rubbed his beefy jaw reflectively, then\ngrinned.\n\n\"I have reason to suspect, Mr. President, that\nthis known UIPS intelligence officer is using an\nAmbassadorial cover for purposes harmful to\nPlanet Pluto's internal security. How's that for\nstarters, sir?\"\n\nNarval's eyes gleamed with sudden craft.\n\n\"Go on,\" he said.\n\n\"His ostensible mission to meet with the President\nof Planet Pluto is, in actuality, a guise under\nwhich he intends to meet with dissident elements\namong our people. His real mission is to subvert\nand undermine the foundations of our government.\nIn other words, his coming here is to disrupt. He\nshould be dealt with according to the rules of his\nown game, and not those of normal interplanetary\nor interregional diplomacy.\"\n\n\"Explain.\"\n\n\"Agents that conduct a mission such as his are\nexpendable, Mr. President. There are no rules.\"\n\n\"Repercussions?\"\n\n\"Whatever happens to him will be outside accepted\nprotocols, and will occur prior to his arrival at\nthe President's Official Residence. The incident\nwill result from initiatives taken by the UIPS\nAmbassador, himself. The Government of Planet\nPluto will not be involved.\"\n\n\"Very well, Scarf. I leave it to you.\"\n\n ##\n\n\"Hodak,\" Brad motioned him forward. \"I want you to\nshow me the new power pack for the cruiser being\noverhauled in tunnel 3. Where is it?\"\n\nHodak glanced at Brad, then away.\n\n\"It's still in the shop near the north side of the\ndome. Take us a few minutes to get there.\"\n\n\"OK, let's go.\"\n\nLeaving the cubicle that served as office they\nboarded the strip. Standing close, they spoke\nthrough unmoving lips.\n\n\"Ram's here.\"\n\n\"In Coldfield?\"\n\n\"Not yet, but soon.\"\n\n\"What's up?\"\n\n\"He's to see Narval. His job is to try to work out\nan agreement that'll keep Slingshot construction\nmoving along.\"\n\n\"How'd you find out?\"\n\n\"Drummer mentioned it to me in passing. He's\narranging a meeting between Narval and Ram.\"\n\n\"Has the time been set?\"\n\n\"Not yet. Drummer's waiting for the go ahead from\nNarval.\"\n\n\"You mean Narval isn't sure he wants to meet Ram?\"\n\n\"Suspicious, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Damn right.\"\n\nTheir eyes met and moved on to the passing scene.\n\n\"If there's to be an incident,\" Brad asked, \"who'll\nbe setting it up?\"\n\n\"Scarf, who else?\"\n\n\"Soon as I hear when Ram's due and where he's to\nbe lodged, I'll get back to you. For as long as he's\non Planet Pluto your job is to keep him out of harm's\nway.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter TWENTY-NINE\n\n\nEntering the Charnel Pit, Ram scanned the tavern.\nAn empty table beckoned, and he folded his long\nframe onto its stool and delicately leaned an elbow\non the least filthy spot of the scarred surface.\nShifting his body slightly, he observed the milling\ncrowd with frequent glances toward the entry.\n\nGarbed in earth-toned street clothes, he had just\nleft his room at the Condor, his mind on Drummer.\nTheir meeting at the landing pad had been proper\nand courteous, with no attempts at prying, either\nway. Confining themselves to amenities, they\nspoke of tedious space jumps, the quality of\naccommodations in various parts of the system,\nand generalities on a better life for humankind\nfrom a benevolent Slingshot.\n\nDrummer had taken leave following Ram's inspecting\nhis lodgings at the Condor and shrugging them\nacceptable under the circumstances. Departing,\nDrummer informed Ram that he would call for him\nor send an escort as soon as a suitable time for his\nmeeting could be arranged with President Narval.\nRam expressed his trust that the meeting would be\nsoon and productive.\n\nAs his eyes accustomed to the bar-room's\nsmoke-diffused lighting the harsh faces of\nthe jostling crowd emerged. A frontier, indeed,\nhe mused. Satisfied that he drew no untoward\nattention, he glanced once more toward the door\nand signaled a robo-dispenser.\n\nA face drifted past, paused for the briefest\nmoment, and moved on. It was enough. Ram gave\nno outward sign, but felt less alone. Hodak ambled\nto the bar, where the drinkers greeted him and\njovially made room. An hour and several drinks\nslipped by. Hodak and Ram ignored each other.\n\nA small man in a nondescript tunic sidled up Ram's\ntable.\n\n\"Xindral?\" He wheezed.\n\nRam glanced at him and away. He remained silent.\n\n\"I have a message for Ram Xindral.\"\n\n\"Give it.\"\n\n\"If you're Xindral, the person you're here to see\nprefers to meet with you away from his normal\nplace of business. I am to guide you to the meeting.\nFollow me.\"\n\n\"Name the man who sent you?\"\n\n\"Drummer.\"\n\n\"Why didn't he come himself?\"\n\n\"He is with his superior at the meeting place.\"\n\nRam was suspicious. It could be a trap. On the\nother hand, it was not unreasonable that Narval\nmight want to meet away from the formal seat of\ngovernment. His options were limited. If Drummer\nhad really sent the message, and he refused the\nescort, the meeting with Narval would be off to a\nbad start, perhaps canceled.\n\nThe messenger stood by, subservient, waiting.\nRam brought his hands to his forehead as if\ndeliberating a decision, and gently rubbed his\ntemple to cover a flashing glance at Hodak. Hodak\nsubtly acknowledged the sign.\n\n\"Be with you as soon as I finish my drink,\" Ram\nsaid.\n\nTaking a sip, he placed the goblet on the table and\nbegan to fish about in his tunic pockets, clumsy and\ntime-consuming. Finally, he rose slowly, towering\nover the small man.\n\n\"Lead on,\" he said.\n\nAlarms shrilled in Hodak's mind as he recognized\nthe person speaking with Ram. What were Scarf's\nstooge and Ram discussing? Ram's mission to Planet\nPluto was clearly diplomatic and entirely Drummer's\nshow. Drummer would not have knowingly accepted\nScarf's involvement in the proceedings.\n\nRam's surreptitious glance in his direction and\ndeliberate clumsy hesitation imparted doubts\nconcerning his predicament. Hodak stretched,\nquickly finished his drink, paid his tab, and\nslapped drinking partners' shoulders good-bye. He\nsauntered toward the door, left the bar-room and,\noutside, turned away as Ram and his escort emerged\nand moved off. Hodak turned casually to observe.\n\nA man in a dark tunic slipped out from a shadow\nalong the wall and followed behind Ram. Another\ntrailed further behind. As Hodak watched, two more\nmoved out of an alley and took positions ahead of\nRam and his escort. Ram was boxed.\n\nHodak followed, barely close enough to distinguish\nRam's swaying form in the street crowds.\n\nRam's guide moved toward a break in the wall and\nmotioned Ram to follow. Hodak saw Ram hesitate,\nspeak harshly, and draw back. He was too late.\nThe others closed in and pushed him forward.\nRam stumbled, tripped, fell, tried to rise. Arms\nwhipped about and he stayed down. The four lifted\nand dragged him through the breach. The fifth\nwaited until they disappeared and darted away.\nIt had happened fast.\n\nDirect intervention on his part, Hodak realized,\nwould be extremely hazardous. Recognition would\ninstantly compromise the Sentinel mission. He\nhad to help Ram in a way that would not disclose\nhis own identity.\n\nHe slipped silently into the alley.\n\nFrom up ahead came rumbled curses and harsh\nlaughter; they were sure of themselves.\n\nHodak's eyes searched the shadows without success\nexcept for the grind of boots on stony detritus and\nthe scrape of a weight being dragged. He closed the\ngap, counting on the procession ignoring their rear.\n\nThe sounds muted and stopped. Peering from a\nrecessed slot along the wall he saw Ram's abductors\ncrowd around the entry to an open utility. One of\nthem crawled in and Ram's unconscious form passed\nto him. The remaining three followed and the cover\ndrawn into place.\n\nHodak moved swiftly to the entry and pressed his\near against its thick cover. Shifting position and\nscooping aside loose dirt and pebbles, he pressed\nhis ear first against the ground then back to the\ncover. Scraping noises from the other side were\naudible, but diminishing.\n\nThe odds were not with him but timing and surprise\nmight even them a bit. Lifting the cover slowly, he\nfelt the texture of the surface and slipped into the\ndimness beyond. He crouched in the rubble, the faint\nsounds giving him direction.\n\nThe tunnel lights were low and flickering, their\nsconces widely spaced. It was enough.\n\nWorking his way forward along the tunnel, short\ndashes from one bend to the next, Hodak closed on\nthe laughing, cursing pack. They were close beyond\nthe next bend.\n\nFeeling along the waistband of his tunic, Hodak\ndrew a thin, flat metal strip from the weave.\nHolding the strip gingerly, he jerked their ends in\nopposite directions and sensed the sharpness of\nthe blades that instantly snapped outward along\nboth edges. Twisting and turning formed a half-meter\nlong scimitar and bending it slightly along its\nlength added a curve comparable to the ancient\nAustralian boomerang. It was both silent and deadly.\n\nHodak eased closer to the bend in the tunnel, and\nsnaked his way along the ground until he had a view\nof the scene ahead.\n\nRam lay in a heap against one wall, motionless.\nHis captors, facing the opposite wall, were busily\nexamining its surface. Words bounced back along\nthe wall.\n\n\"...as good a place as any, huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Let's get this over with and head for the\nBlind Pig. I'm thirsty as hell.\"\n\n\"OK, Patch and Swat, you two -- start burning\nthe hole. Cut it deep enough so all of him can be\nshoved in. Leave enough room so we can seal it\nover with the same dirt. Flume, you start collecting\nrocks to pack around the body once we get it\nin place. Then we'll just pack and fuse-seal until\nit's all smoothed over. This guy'll be riding this\nice ball when hell freezes over.\"\n\n\"What're you gonna do, Angel?\"\n\nHis tone was sarcastic. It brought a snarl in\nreturn.\n\n\"Scarf put me in charge of this detail, Flume.\nRemember? So when I tell you to haul rocks, don't\nfight it.\" The heavy tone eased. \"I was ordered to\nsearch the guy. Scarf wants everything from his\npockets, and all his clothes, just in case he's got\nsomething stashed away. I gotta deliver the stuff\nas soon as we're done here. My orders are also to\nmess up the body so it'll never be identified, even\nif it does get found. So let's get with it.\"\n\nAs Hodak watched, Flume, the rock gatherer moved\noff down the tunnel. Two of the remaining three\ndrew soil-fusers from a backpack and concentrated\non their power settings. The fourth, obviously\nAngel, turned toward Ram who was beginning to stir.\n\nSeeing Ram's movement, Angel drew his weapon,\nhefted it, and aimed it at Ram's head. Angel's\nmouth twisted into a savage grin.\n\nHis companions turned from their work to watch.\n\n\"Wait. I want him to see it coming,\" Angel said\nover his shoulder.\n\nHodak pressed his fingernail against a pip on the\ninstrument in his hand and felt it vibrate with\nenergy. Thrusting his arm further into the tunnel's\nbend he hurled the boomerang toward Angel.\n\nThe weapon reached its maximum velocity within two\nmeters of the throw. Moving at a speed that made\nit invisible to the naked eye, it flew silently and\ntrue.\n\nThe slender implement curved around Angel's neck\nand, without stopping, completed its return to\nHodak's hand.\n\nAngel's head was gone from his shoulders.\n\nThe sound of Angel's falling body startled the\ntwo staring expectantly at Ram, waiting for the\nexecution shot. Turning, they gaped at what had\nbeen Angel. They scrambled in panic to press\ntheir backs against the tunnel wall. Dropping the\nsoil-fusers, they drew and waved their weapons\nabout.\n\nOne of them shouted, \"Flume. Can you hear me,\nFlume?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I hear you. Whatta ya want?\"\n\n\"Get back here, quick.\"\n\nFlume came running, took in the scene and joined\nthe other two against the wall. Together, they\nstared at Angel, then along the tunnel, one\ndirection then the other.\n\n\"What the hell's goin' on?\"\n\n\"How do I know? We didn't hear anything, then the\nnoise of him falling. We looked and there he was\nand there was his head. We had our eyes on the\nbig guy; couldn'a been him did it.\"\n\n\"What do we do now?\"\n\n\"Search me.\"\n\n\"Let's get outta here.\"\n\n\"Can't. We gotta finish the job, or Scarf'll burn\nus alive.\"\n\n\"Then we better stick together from now on,\"\nFlume said. \"You two finish cutting the hole but\nnow make it deeper. I'll keep watch. Soon as\nyou're ready we'll load 'em in, seal it up with\nstuff from around here, and scram.\"\n\nAs Hodak watched, Patch and Swat recovered\nsufficiently to raise their soil-fusers and direct\nthe nozzles at the tunnel's wall.\n\nAn amber glow formed on the fuser's tips and the\ntunnel wall's surface bubbled and flowed toward\nthe floor in the light gravity. Wielding the fusers\nexpertly they distributed its liquefied substance\nin a rough, irregular pattern, blending it in with\nthe surrounding surfaces. The excess that reached\nthe floor quickly hardened to match the rubble\nstrewn about.\n\nFlume, back against the opposite wall, weapon high\nand ready, peered tensely about. Finally satisfied,\nPatch switched off his fuser and tapped Swat on\nthe shoulder. Swat glanced at him, switched off,\nand they stepped back.\n\n\"This'll do it,\" Patch said. \"Load Angel in first.\nThe back of the hole is too small for the big guy.\"\n\nHe leaned over, grasped the open-eyed head by\na hank of hair and flung it into the hole. The head\ndisappeared with a soft thud. Swat joined Patch;\neach grasped one of the body's arms and legs\nand they heaved it in after the head. Patch leaned\ninto the hole and pushed the solid flesh as far as it\nwould go. Turning, he motioned Swat toward Ram.\n\nFor a moment Flume faced away from Hodak.\nHe did not see the boomerang before it twisted\naround his throat and was gone.\n\nIntent on Ram, Swat and Patch saw neither the\nstrike nor the weapon. They heard a gurgling sound\nand whirled. Flume was on the tunnel floor, blood\npulsing from the neck of his headless torso. The\nhead, itself, had rolled against the opposite wall,\neyes open.\n\nPanicked, they fired frantically down the tunnel\nin both directions.\n\nThe boomerang back in his hand, Hodak waited. An\nopen assault was unacceptable, both for himself and\nfor Ram. He would be cut down with a single sweep\nof the killers' heavy handguns, and with his identity\nrevealed, Scarf would track down the Sentinels with\na vengeance.\n\nSnapping a quick peek he saw Patch and Swat back\nto back in the middle of the tunnel, facing in opposite\ndirections and whispering to each other in terror.\nGuessing the distance between the two he extended\nthe boomerang slightly and pressed the pip.\n\nStepping away from the wall Hodak threw the\nboomerang around the bend.\n\nOne of the targets must have seen it coming.\nThere was the beginning of a scream.\n\nBoomerang back in hand, Hodak walked around the\nbend. Patch lay quietly; Swat's body still quivered.\n\nHodak took less than five minutes to enlarge the\nhole, load the newly dead in with their companions,\nand smooth the surface to match the tunnel's wall.\n\nRam, groggy, sat against the opposite wall and\nwatched.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter THIRTY\n\n\nThe space was little more than two meters across,\na vault cut into the side of a tunnel to store\nconstruction supplies. It was enough.\n\nLeaving Ram in the dimly lit space to recover,\nHodak rushed to an exit, surfaced, took his\nbearings, and found Brad in his office. Brad\nimmediately sensed the urgency from Hodak's\nexpression.\n\n\"Let's get our people together,\" Brad ordered.\nHodak quickly passed the word and, within minutes,\nthe Sentinels convened in an empty air lock.\n\nMyra left for headquarters to cover; the remainder\nstrung out behind Hodak to the subsurface vault\nwhere he'd left Ram.\n\n ##\n\n\"And that's it.\" Ram finished recapping his trip as\nhe gingerly rubbed the large bruise on his head.\n\n\"They're lining up for a confrontation,\" he said,\n\"both political and military, and Slingshot is the\nclub they'll hold over us. They think they smell\nthe blood of victory, and there isn't a cool head\namong them.\"\n\nHe turned to Brad.\n\n\"Your message was incomplete,\" he said. \"What\nwas left out?\"\n\n\"Narval's planning guidance on the assault launch\npoint,\" Brad replied, citing the coordinates,\nbringing Ram up to date.\n\nThey were silent as Ram mulled over his options.\nSighing, he rose and stretched his frame, bending\nslightly to keep his head from scraping against the\nvault's roof.\n\n\"The attack on me must have been approved by\nNarval,\" he said. \"My feeling is he didn't want to\ntalk to me because his preparations and commitments\nare too far along. He feared that, had we met, I\nmight get enough from our discussions to see his\ngame plan. I've got to get home -- fast.\" Grinning\nat Brad, he asked, \"OK, how are you going to get\nme out of this rat's nest and back to my ship?\"\n\n ##\n\nNarval screeched, face twisted, hands pounding\nthe desk.\n\n\"What do you mean, standing there and telling me\nyou've lost track of your people? Not that I give a\ndamn about them, but you gave them a simple job\nto do, and I want to know, now, where it stands.\"\n\n\"That's just it, Mr. President,\" Scarf said, his\nnormally ruddy face gray with fear. \"I haven't\nreceived a 'sitrep' from my agent-in-charge. I did\nget an interim report from the back-up observer\nI assigned to track them from the Charnel Pit.\nAccording to him, the Ambassador was taken into\ncustody immediately upon leaving the bar. Along the\nway he resisted and had to be -- uh -- restrained.\nEverything looked to be under control, so the\nobserver left to report.\"\n\n\"Tell me precisely what you ordered your agent to\ndo.\"\n\n\"Identify himself as coming from Drummer. Take\nthe Ambassador into custody under the pretext of\nescorting him to a private meeting with you. While\nin custody, and without witnesses, Xindral was to\nbe terminated and his body buried in a tunnel. The\nsite was to be returned to its original appearance,\nand Xindral's possessions brought to me.\"\n\n\"Where is this site located?\"\n\n\"My agent was to give me the exact location when\nhe delivered the Ambassador's personal effects.\"\n\n\"You mean you don't even know where to start\nlooking? Is that what you're saying?\"\n\n\"I know the location where they took him down.\nWell, I got a problem there too; the subsurface\njunction branches off in several directions.\"\n\n\"Is it possible Xindral overcame his restraints\nand neutralized your team?\"\n\n\"Not likely, sir. The observer said he saw\nsufficient force used against Xindral when he\nresisted to render him unconscious.\"\n\nNarval sank back into his chair, head lowered,\nstaring into his lap. Raising his head, he fixed\nburning eyes on Scarf.\n\n\"Despite your assurances, Scarf, I think it not\nonly possible, but likely, that Xindral got away\nfrom your team. For all you know, your goons\nmay be in hiding, afraid to face you with the truth.\nIf Xindral's still alive, he must have concluded by\nnow that the attempt against him would not have\noccurred without my approval. So, we're committed,\nand I can't afford to wait.\"\n\nHe pointed a shaking finger at Scarf.\n\n\"Xindral can leave Coldfield only through an air\nlock. Post extra guards. Deploy patrols to strips\nleading to air locks on the perimeter. Mark him\nas a newly arrived renegade, a killer and genetic\nflake dangerous to Coldfield's safety. Order your\npeople to take no chances with him; he is to be\ndestroyed on sight. I want Xindral found, and\nI want him dead. Do it. Now! Move!\"\n\n ##\n\nHodak was back from scouting the tunnel up ahead.\nThe way was clear with an exit a kilometer distant.\nThe opposite direction would lead them back to the\ncenter of Coldfield.\n\nBrad cocked an eyebrow at Ram. Ram nodded.\n\nHodak and Kumiko took point, Brad behind Ram. Zolan\nand Adari rear guard. They covered ground swiftly.\n\nThe passageway widened, and a ramp led up to\na mezzanine from which other tunnels branched.\nAscending the ramp Hodak disappeared into a low,\nnarrow entryway in the wall. The others followed.\nRam folded to his knees and went flat to squeeze\nthrough. The cut ended abruptly at a rock face.\nA ladder rose to the dim outline of a manhole.\n\nKumiko climbed and slipped a slender filament\nthrough the tiny gap between the edge of the\nutility cover and its frame. Below, Zolan inserted\nthe free end of the filament into a clip on the\nbridge of a pair of goggles, and donned them.\n\n\"Up a mite,\" he called to Kumiko. \"OK, hold it,\nnow scan a 360, slow.\"\n\nHe gave the goggles to Brad who donned them\nand scoped the ground level through the filament.\n\n\"The manhole is in a cul-de-sac, closed in on three\nsides by walls set back about two meters from where\nwe are. The cul-de-sac accesses a street on which\ntraffic is passing. The dome's inside wall is on\nthe far side, and I see some markings on it. Each\nof you, look about and get your bearings. Speak up\nif you recognize the area or the markings.\"\n\nThe goggles passed from one to the other. Zolan\ntossed them up to Kumiko at the top of the ladder\nand caught them when they were lowered. He handed\nthem to Ram who peered at the ground scene as he\nlistened.\n\n\"Strip markings,\" Adari said. \"They're usually\nlocated to orient folks coming in from the outside.\nMy guess is we're close to a strip or an air lock.\"\n\n\"Any idea which one?\" Brad asked.\n\n\"Not from appearances,\" Adari replied, \"but I kept\ntrack of our twists and turns to this point, and\nthe way I figure, we're in the western quadrant of\nthe city. The sector has more air locks than the\nothers because it's on the main route to landing\npads for the maintenance shops. We've lucked out\n-- maybe.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'maybe'? Don't hold back.\"\n\n\"The traffic. More people about.\"\n\nThe silence was heavy.\n\n\"If we can make it to an air lock without being\nchallenged,\" Brad said, \"we'll get Ram to a taxi.\nHodak, can you rig a taxi to manual control and\nleave it with enough power for a one-time flight\nthrough the depot's cocoon?\"\n\nHodak, Zolan and Adari put their heads together.\nRam shoved his head in among them, and vigorous\nhand motions cut the air. Ram nodded as Hodak\nturned back to Brad.\n\n\"Can do,\" he said.\n\n\"Next item,\" Brad said. \"Ram, can you get your\nlong frame into a standard suit?\"\n\n\"Once we get into the air lock I'll look for the\nbiggest suit on the rack. Then I'll just have to\npush, pull and squeeze. Won't be the first time.\"\n\nBrad looked up at Kumiko, holding the scope in\nplace.\n\n\"Got it?\" He called up.\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"Comments?\"\n\n\"As long as I'm up here, how about me taking point?\"\n\n\"OK. Now, all of you. Set weapons at max. If\nwe're seen and tied to Ram, the whole operation\nis compromised. So we'll have no witnesses. Act\naccordingly.\"\n\nKumiko pushed the manhole lid aside, climbed out\nand darted forward to where she could see along\nthe street. She took in the scene quickly.\n\nSeveral people passed on a nearby strip. They did\nnot notice Kumiko. She waited until they passed\nwhere they could have seen into the cul-de-sac,\nthen signaled the others up.\n\nAs Zolan came abreast of Kumiko he drew\na pencil-thin tube from a pocket in his tunic.\nHolding it in one hand he twisted the knurled knob\nthat formed one end, and returned it to his pocket.\nHe winked at Brad who had come up beside him.\n\nBrad saw the question in Ram's eyes.\n\n\"One of Zolan's home-grown gadgets,\" he said.\n\"Sets up an omni-interference field for a couple\nof hundred meters. We'll be moving through\ncomm-override chatter until he switches it off.\"\n\nThen to Kumiko, \"Which way?\"\n\n\"Left. Air lock. Hundred meters.\" She crouched\nand darted away.\n\n\"Ram, stoop, bend, whatever it takes to shrink.\nStay close to the wall for as long as you can.\nEveryone keep a few meters apart. Hodak, you stay\nclose to Ram and watch the rear. OK, let's do it.\"\n\nTwo burly men came around the end of a nearby\nstructure, stopped, stared at Ram as he rose\nthrough the manhole, and then at each other. Zolan\ncaught both in a conical burst as they backed away.\nThey fell in silence.\n\nHodak and Zolan dashed forward. Each grasped a\nset of ankles, hauled the bodies into the cul-de-sac\nand dumped them down the utility hole.\n\nBrad took a quick look in both directions and\nnudged Adari.\n\n\"Go,\" he said.\n\nKumiko was at the air lock. Brad, Hodak and\nRam were well away from the cul-de-sac. Kumiko\nstepped into the enclosure containing the suit racks,\nher weapon up and level, safety off, finger a tiny\nspace from the trigger.\n\nTwo guards, sitting on a bench, rifles across their\nthighs, gaped at her.\n\n\"What the hell,\" one of them yawped, raising his\nrifle.\n\nThe other guard flipped the switch on a hand-held\ntransmitter and started to raise it to his lips.\nKumiko cut them down with a single sweep. She\nraced up and across the long room, checking\nalcoves, corridors and behind suit racks. Empty.\n\nRam entered, quickly followed by the others. Hodak\nremained at the door, alert for intruders. Adari\nmoved across to the keypad control for the outer\nair lock, and peered through the visi-screen. She\nthumbed up.\n\nRam rummaged hastily among the space suits on\nthe rack. Adari left her position, grabbed a suit and\nworked herself into it. Brad, Kumiko and Zolan were\nhalfway into theirs. Zolan moved to the outer door.\nHodak, suited up, called to Ram, who hurried over.\n\n\"Here's one you might squeeze into. C'mere, give it\na try.\"\n\nRam looked distastefully at the suit. \"Well,\" he\nmuttered, \"that's what happens to a giant among\npygmies. I couldn't find anything bigger than what\nyou've come up with. Give a hand here.\"\n\nAdari joined them. Together, she and Hodak\nshoehorned Ram into the suit and closed the seals.\nHelmets fitted, they ran quickly through air tank\nand suit connections security and pressure checks.\nMinutes later they were ready for departure.\n\nBrad motioned Kumiko closer, and they opened their\nfaceplates.\n\n\"Stay here until we return,\" Brad instructed,\n\"but keep your suit on. Now that we're all wearing\nsuits we can't be identified. So, if you get innocent\nvisitors, just incapacitate them. If anyone comes\nlooking for a fight, don't wait for an invitation.\"\n\nKumiko nodded and closed her faceplate. Weapon\nin hand, she took up a position where she would\nnot be seen from the entryway.\n\nBrad lumbered to the air lock and, a moment\nlater, the panel to the buffer space slipped aside.\nGesturing Ram, Zolan, Hodak and Adari through, he\nstepped after them and closed and dogged the panel\nleading back into the dome. He lifted the safety\ncover and pressed a wall plate. With a swish of\nescaping air, the outer doors slid up. They stepped\nout.\n\n ##\n\nA dozen taxis and space tugs were scattered about\non the ramp. Choosing the taxi most distant from\nthe others Zolan beckoned Hodak and Adari to follow\nhim. Moving as quickly as their suits and the light\ngravity would allow, they reached the taxi and\nclimbed aboard. Brad and Ram brought up the rear,\nturning often to watch other suited people moving\nabout. A ramp guard was some distance away,\ngesturing among a knot of people. The Sentinels\nremained unnoticed.\n\nReaching the taxi, Zolan and Hodak began to\nadjust its controls, vector and power instruments.\nAdari's helmet filled in the pilot position. Raising her\nglove she beckoned frantically to Ram. He climbed\nin beside her. Her hand on his helmet she spoke\nrapidly, pointing at the instrument panel.\n\nBrad watched Adari move back and out as Ram moved\ninto the seat she vacated. Bending forward, her\nhelmet touched Ram's as her gloved hands pointed to\nwhere the depot was visible. She slapped Ram on the\nshoulder and stepped back.\n\nThe jerry-rigged taxi rose slowly at first, gained\nspeed and disappeared into the backdrop of black\nvelvet and stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter THIRTY-ONE\n\n\nCamari strode into the Conference Room, took\nhis seat at the head of the long table, and stared\nbleakly at his advisors. The faces of the Ministers\nof Diplomatic Protocols and Intelligence were grim;\nthe Commander of the Space Forces ready to explode.\n\n\"I suppose you've all studied Ram's report,\" Camari\nsaid in a low, angry voice. \"What do you think?\nSelvin?\"\n\n\"If they take the depot,\" Admiral Selvin said,\n\"we're out of business. Even if we get the depot\nback undamaged, we'll be unable to make up the\ntime lost. The construction and launch schedules\nare that tight.\"\n\n\"What do you suggest?\"\n\n\"Stop them -- now.\"\n\n\"They'll know we're coming when our fleet lines up\nto enter the spunnel. The gateway can handle our\nmilitary craft, no problem there. What we cannot\ncount on is INOR's failing to see us on the move.\"\n\n\"How do we get around that?\"\n\n\"Diversionary tactics; draw their attention to\na major initiative on our part in which all of INOR\nhas role vital to its interests, if not survival.\nRisky, but we have no choice.\"\n\nThe Strategic Concepts Computer recorded, analyzed,\nand reported. They listened, then talked.\n\n ##\n\nThe Solar Spunnel Communications Control flashed\na Category One Alert across the system. The Alert\nwas directed to all planets, satellites, stations,\noutposts, and all ships in space from Mercury to\ndeep within the Oort Cloud far beyond the Slingshot\nconstruction sites.\n\nRymer Camari, President of the United Inner\nPlanetary System wished to address the citizens\nof all nations on a matter of extreme urgency, one\nthat affects humankind throughout the entire Solar\nSystem. The INOR Chiefs of State were urged to\nconvene their Executive and Legislative Councils\nand to listen to the UIPS President.\n\nInterplanetary comm-spunnel boosters were raised to\nmaximum power and range. The added power cleared\nCamari's image and speech for override into all\nopen aud-viz transmitters and receivers throughout\nthe system.\n\nWhen Camari's features formed in view tanks or on\nscreens his manner was grave, and his tone solemn\nand deliberate. The message was brief.\n\n\"Greetings to all citizens and Governments of our\nSolar Community,\" he began. \"We wish you well.\nI have chosen this time and this means to speak\nto you directly because the threat to all of use is\nreal and our peril increases by the hour. Unless we\nact immediately and in concert, disaster will befall\nus all.\n\n\"Not long ago two of our manned recon craft were\nattacked and destroyed near Planet Pluto. These\nships were part of a small protective force that\nthe UIPS maintains in the Plutonian Special Zone\nfor the safety of the Slingshot terminals and its\nlogistics depot.\n\n\"The Government of Planet Pluto has been familiar\nwith the patrollers' mission to protect Slingshot\nassets in the Construction Zone since the Program\nwas in its early planning stages. In these latest\noperations, one of our patrols was known to be\nscouting the Plutonian outback for subsurface\ntunnels and galleries where unscrupulous\nadventurers sneak off to hide after preying on our\noutposts and transports. The other UIPS patroller\nhad identified a cache of contraband weapons in\nspace that presented a clear threat to Slingshot.\n\n\"The attack on the two UIPS ships could not have\noccurred without the prior knowledge, approval\nand very likely, the direct orders from the highest\nauthorities in the Plutonian Government.\"\n\nThe President sat forward in his chair and his face\nloomed larger across the system. His voice lowered,\nand increased its intensity.\n\n\"We cannot consider these incidents in isolation.\nOur transports to the Slingshot depot and\nconstruction site are being raided and harassed\nby terrorists and pirates who are directed by\nand provided sanctuary by both official and\nnon-official entities. We are compelled to conclude\nthat INOR criminal adventurers and pirates act in\nthe context of agreements among their Governments.\nDoing so constitutes direct military and economic\nwarfare against the UIPS and is an attempt to\nsabotage the Slingshot mission.\n\n\"I must tell you now we are outraged by this\nconspiracy and these attacks. The UIPS does\nhave recourse. It can respond in kind.\n\n\"What then? Warships carrying weapons of\nunprecedented destructive power are at the ready\nin both regions. Have we no choice but to keep\nescalating provocation, sneak attacks and reprisals\nuntil our full military fleets are unleashed in\ntheir fury against each other? If we get to this,\ncitizens of INOR, do not rule out reprisals on your\nencapsulated communities. Be aware: history clearly\nshows us that there are indeed few, if any, real\nsanctuaries for civilian populations in times of\nwar.\"\n\nHe paused to let the words sink in. His voice\nbecame crisp and forceful.\n\n\"I am now faced with this decision: Should the UIPS\nretaliate against Planet Pluto and all other members\nof INOR that interfere with innocent passage of our\ntransports to and from the Slingshot sites?\n\n\"That is one course open to us; it would bring\ndeath and havoc all across this star system we\nknow as our home. We must look to alternatives. The\ncreators and wielders of weapons must demonstrate\nreason along with valor. War, in any form and at\nany level, is a blind evasion of the real problems\nthat confront humankind.\n\n\"When the old United Planetary System was replaced\nby the UIPS and INOR, the relationships among\ngovernments and peoples deteriorated. We drifted\napart. The few interregional agreements that did\nevolve supported special interests. Once ingrained,\nthey became acceptable, even generally attractive,\npractices. Now we each have our spheres of\ninfluence, and we guard them jealously -- and often\nwith apprehension.\n\n\"There remains, to this day, a deep distrust and\nfear that one nation or independent colony, or any\ncollective, will attempt to secure advantage over\nanother. Each of us, focused on our own interests,\nsees the danger and seeks to avoid being its\nvictim. This infectious distrust and fear must be\ncleansed from our system-wide community of nations\nif we are ever to live in peace with each other.\n\n\"Misunderstandings have arisen over the centuries\nconcerning the intentions for Slingshot facilities\nand personnel in place throughout what has now\nbecome INOR territories or jurisdictions. We accept\nour share of blame for these misconceptions.\nLet us dispel them.\n\n\"The Collector Terminal, as you all know, will be\ndisengaged upon completion and take its position\non the system's rim. When the launch window\nopens, and it will be open to us for only a very brief\ntime, the Extractor must depart -- there will be no\nsecond chance for several centuries. The Extractor\nmust fly as fast and as true as the missile did\nfrom the sling of David to the head of Goliath.\nThe Extractor is our missile, Alpha Centauri is\nour target and, as David's leather sling was the\ninstrument to save an ancient civilization. The\norbit of Planet Pluto powers the sling that will\nsave our civilizations for the ages which extend\nbefore us, but only if we act in unity.\n\n\"What happens afterward? When the Extractor\nhas departed, we will no longer need the logistics\ndepot, and UIPS citizens in the Zone will return\nhome. All but a small portion of our facilities,\nequipment, and supplies will be transferred on site\nto the Plutonian Government or INOR generally.\nWhatever is not wanted by its new owners we\nwill remove and help Planet Pluto to convert and\nreconstruct Coldfield and the rest of the planet\nto fit the needs of its citizens. We will provide\nmaterial support and training for transition to\nan infrastructure and administration of Pluto's\nchoice. We invite all of INOR to share in this\ntask.\"\n\nCamari leaned back for a short pause. His eyes\nlooked beseechingly at his unseen audience. His\nvoice softened.\n\n\"That was the past and, admittedly, a poor\nfoundation upon which to build; let us now look to\na more positive future. I make this proposal to all\nGovernments of our star system, the common\nheritage of humankind.\n\n\"We are in disarray. As history has demonstrated\ntime and again there are no real winners in\ncontests of military might, to the contrary. Our\nresponse to the incidents off Planet Pluto is that\nwe reject reprisal merely for vengeance, or for\nimposing ourselves on the Plutonian people. In the\nsame vein, we reject war against any Government\nwithin INOR. Not because we cannot wage war, but\nbecause war would annihilate cities and lives on\nboth sides. Further, Slingshot would be lost to us,\nand ultimately, the entire solar civilization would\nwane and disappear.\n\n\"I propose we meet in space, along the border\nbetween our Regions at a place of mutual agreement.\nLet us convene as equals to examine our differences.\nWe must give greater credence to each other's needs\nand aspirations and arrive at consensus on sharing\nin the responsibilities for this, our family of\nplanets and satellites. Let us search for ways\nto combine our diverse interests into a new and\nmajestic pioneering spirit for the great leap to\nthe stars yet to come.\n\n\"This is the challenge and the opportunity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter THIRTY-TWO\n\n\nNarval's rage spluttered from his lips in a\nviperous hiss as he pointed at a baffled Drummer.\nBrad, straight-faced behind Drummer, stood easy.\nScarf, off to the side, stiff and erect, stared\nblankly at the wall behind Narval, his features\ntwitching to depress a smirk.\n\n\"You were responsible for Camari's emissary,\nDrummer. I've had you notified that I am ready to\nreceive him. Where is he?\"\n\n\"He's disappeared, Mr. President.\"\n\n\"So I'm told. What does that mean?\"\n\n\"Your orders were to provide lodgings for the\nAmbassador somewhere other than the official\nguest house. I had no choice but to put him up at the\nCondor. When I was informed of the time that you\nagreed to see him, I went to the Condor to extend\nthe formal invitation. He wasn't there. I inquired\nof the Condor's management and also among the\ncitizens present. Several recalled him because\nof his unusual height, but no one, it seems, saw\nhim leave.\" Glancing toward Scarf, he added,\n\"I immediately requested your Chief of Internal\nSecurity to put out search parties. That's where\nit stands.\"\n\nNarval turned to Scarf.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nScarf stiffened.\n\n\"We've searched the city, Mr. President,\" he said,\n\"and can't find a trace of him under the dome. But\nwe had several unexplained killings a short while\nago and I'm sure he's involved. Two of my agents\nwere gunned down on the street near air lock 43,\napparently without reason, and their bodies were\ndumped down a utility access. Also, two of my\nguards, on special detail inside the air lock were\nkilled. Add to that a communications blank-out\nswamped the same area about that time, and a\nspace taxi is missing from the 43 ramp.\n\n\"We can't get a tracer on the taxi; its automatic\nlocation signal is out, and it doesn't respond to\ndirect inquiry. All this, taken together, is very\nsuspicious, and leads me to conclude the Ambassador\nskipped rather than meet with you.\"\n\nBrad's eyes moved gravely from one speaker to the\nother.\n\n\"Drummer.\" Narval turned back to him. \"When you met\nwith Camari's Ambassador, what did you discuss?\"\n\nDrummer shrugged and stroked his chin.\n\n\"Just the routine chit-chat of protocol: small talk\nabout the inconveniences of long hops and living out\nof traveling kits. Oh, yes, we expressed our hopes\nfor a better future when Slingshot cuts in. That\nwas about it.\"\n\n\"Then why would he leave so abruptly?\"\n\n\"I have no idea, Mr. President.\"\n\n\"This incident does not please me, Drummer. A\nspecial envoy arrives from the UIPS, obviously\ncarrying an important message to me from President\nCamari. He leaves before he delivers the message,\nwith no advance notice. As he leaves he kills\nseveral Plutonian citizens and steals property.\nNo, I don't like it at all, Drummer.\"\n\nHis fingernails drummed the desk. Suddenly\nconscious of what he was doing, he stopped and\nbrought his hands close and inspected them for\ndamage.\n\n\"Drummer, draft a personal message from me to\nCamari, complaining about the manner in which his\nAmbassador conducted himself on Planet Pluto.\nAccuse the Ambassador of murdering several of\nour citizens and stealing our property to escape our\njudicial process. Tell Camari his message to me, if\nhe really sent one, was not delivered. That'll throw\nthe ball back to him. As far as I'm concerned, the\nmatter is closed. I have far more important matters\nto discuss with you and Brad.\"\n\nHe waved his hand at Scarf.\n\n\"Get on about your business.\"\n\nAs Scarf closed the door behind him, Narval shifted\nhis bulk. Placing both hands flat on the desk he\nstudied each ring. He glanced momentarily at\nDrummer and fixed his eyes on Brad.\n\n\"I am not a fool,\" he hissed as his features\ncontorted into waves of quivering fat.\n\n\"That UIPS envoy had motives for coming to Planet\nPluto far beyond delivering a message to me and\ngetting a formal response. His timing was to be\nhere when Camari broadcast his appeal for his\nconvocation with INOR Heads of State. He was here\nto assess my reaction.\" Looking from one to the\nother, he demanded, \"Did you hear Camari's speech?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" from Drummer.\n\nBrad nodded.\n\n\"Well, as my diplomatic affairs advisor, Drummer,\nwhat did you make of it?\"\n\n\"My feeling is that Camari is willing to meet us\nhalfway to resolve differences between the Regions.\"\n\n\"You do, eh? What about you, Brad?\"\n\n\"I'm neither a politician nor a diplomat, Mr.\nPresident. I can't see behind the words. Taken\nliterally, I suppose, he wants a grand party to\ntalk things out. That might be fine, providing it\nties in with your plans.\"\n\n\"Aha,\" Narval said, with a gentle slap at the\ndesk's top.\n\n\"You've hit it a lot closer than Drummer. The\nquestion of the moment is how might this so-called\npeace conference affect achieving my ultimate\nobjective?\"\n\n\"I have not been made privy to your 'ultimate\nobjective', Mr. President,\" Brad said. \"I cannot\nspeak to that point.\"\n\nDrummer looked straight at Narval, silent.\n\n\"My question, Drummer,\" Narval demanded, his tone\nimpatient.\n\n\"You shared your objectives with me in confidence,\nMr. President. I am not at liberty to speak on them\nin the presence of others without your permission.\"\n\nNarval stared long and hard at Drummer and back\nto Brad.\n\n\"Not yet,\" he said. \"Meanwhile, and especially in\nthe light of the forthcoming convocation, I want\nyou, Brad, to accelerate preparing our military\nfleet to take possession of the depot and that\ngaggle of transport and other vessels that\nconstantly hover about. They will be the main\nbargaining chip when I give my ultimatum to Camari.\"\n\nBrad nodded, his features closed.\n\nDrummer looked dubious. He said, \"That means we\nmust have the depot under our control when you\nspeak to President Camari.\"\n\n\"Sound conclusion,\" Narval replied caustically.\n\"Now, Drummer, is the time for you, my chief\ndiplomat, to engage in a bit of manipulation and\nencouragement among our allies -- in my name\nand behalf, of course.\n\n\"We'll do this one step at a time. Prepare personal\nmessages from me to the heads of INOR governments.\nRemind them of our past agreements to stand\ntogether to resist incursions by the UIPS. Point\nout that Camari's invitation presents us with an\nexcellent opportunity to exert our combined will\non this issue. Then, state my intention to take\ntemporary control of the Slingshot Logistics\nDepot to add weight to our persuasions. Are my\ninstructions clear?\"\n\n\"They are, Mr. President.\"\n\n\"Good. Emphasize the need for us to act in concert\nto bring peace and prosperity to the Outer Region.\nLay it on thick about how we can demonstrate our\nunity of purpose to Camari, and harmony among\nourselves if we join forces. This shouldn't be\na surprise to them; it was the purpose of the\nplanning at the Neptune meeting. Wasn't it, Brad?\"\n\n\"It was.\"\n\n\"Here, then, is my first objective, Drummer. I want\nthe INOR warships that were committed at the Neptune\nmeeting to be alongside ours to take over the Depot.\nThe Depot must be ours before the conference\ngets under way. That is vital to our purpose. In the\nmessage, say that now is the time to strike. Insist\nthat they send their ships as quickly as possible\nto join in the operation. Also, and be shrewd in\npresenting this: INOR ship commanders are to be\nsubordinate to and carry out the orders of the\nPlutonian Fleet Commander for the duration of this\noperation. Clear?\"\n\n\"Clear, Mr. President.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter THIRTY-THREE\n\n\nNarval sat hunched over as Drummer and Brad\nentered. He did not wait for them to approach.\n\n\"Well? Speak up, Drummer,\" he snapped. \"Don't\nwait for a special invitation.\"\n\n\"The replies to your message have come in, Mr.\nPresident. They are all in the affirmative. Their\nfleets are getting ready.\"\n\n\"Ah hah!\"\n\nNarval's head shot up, and he straightened as\nmuch as his deeply cushioned chair would allow. He\npatted the top of his desk, and his face creased\ninto a broad grin, flushed with triumph. Eyes\ndancing from Drummer to Brad and back, he patted\nthe desk once more, obviously enjoying the moment.\nThe grin quickly transformed into one of deadly\ncunning.\n\n\"That takes care of my first objective,\" he\nsaid. \"From here they are both independent and\ninterdependent. You must plan carefully and carry\nout my instructions without deviating.\"\n\nEyes fixed on Drummer, he raised his jeweled hand\nto point at him.\n\n\"I have already told you how you fit into my plans\nfor the future.\" Turning to Brad, \"You have proven\nyourself a reliable and resourceful leader, Brad.\nWhen I have attained my goals, you, along with\nDrummer, will be amply rewarded with material\nwealth and positions of honor. I tell you this\nnow because in my world loyalty has a price, and\nyou are entitled to know I will pay it. How do you\nstand?\"\n\n\"I hear and I understand, Mr. President,\" Brad\nreplied and, without a flinch, \"I stand with you.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nLeaning as far forward as his paunch would allow,\nNarval motioned Drummer and Brad forward. They\ntook chairs close to the desk.\n\n\"Drummer, I appoint you Commander of the Combined\nFleet, and I now order you to take the objective.\nBrad, I appoint you Drummer's Chief of Combat\nOperations. I will issue the necessary orders to\nall Commanders of the Plutonian fleet and to the\nCommanders of our allied forces.\"\n\nNarval watched Drummer and Brad's faces as he\nspoke. Both returned his gaze with grim, attentive\nexpressions.\n\n\"When you have taken the objective, only Scarf's\nsecurity troops are to be allowed to board and take\nstations throughout the facility. You have another\ntask.\n\n\"Once internal security is established, invite the\nship commanders to a celebration on your flagship.\nReject declinations; they must appear. Permit the\ncelebration to go on for a bit, then, Drummer, the\nbolt.\n\n\"Announce to the assembled Commanders -- those\nof the Plutonian fleet and those of our allies --\nthat I have instructed you to take their oath of\nallegiance to me, Narval of Planet Pluto, and to\nnone other. Those who refuse are to be eliminated\non the spot in plain view of the others. Those who\nagree are to be placed under psychic probes, then\nand there, to ensure that their oath of allegiance\nto me is without reservation. Any who fail to pass\nthe test are to join the ones that openly refused.\nNo second chances. Understood?\"\n\n\"Understood,\" Brad said.\n\nDrummer nodded, his face gone pale.\n\n\"Transfer contingents of Scarf's troops from\nthe objective to your flagship, several hundred if\nnecessary, whatever number you need to cover the\noperation. Make certain that you transfer enough\ntechnicians to set up and operate the psychic\nprobes. If any Commanders or their staffs chose\nto be feisty, the troops are your execution squads.\n\n\"The ships of those Commanders who refuse to swear\nallegiance to me will be boarded by our troops, and\nall resistance crushed. Subterfuge may be necessary;\ndo not hesitate: the end justifies the means.\nReplace the original INOR Commanders with officers\nnext in command; promise them wealth and position,\nuse the psychic probes to verify their decisions;\nat some point in the pressures that we will apply\nINOR officers will switch their allegiance to Pluto.\n\n\"When your takeover is complete, the combined\nINOR fleet will be under my control. I shall then use\nthis power to challenge the conferees and dictate\nmy terms to both the UIPS and INOR's rulers.\"\n\n\"Timing is of the utmost importance,\" Brad\nreflected.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Narval said sharply. \"All of your plans\nand timetables must be synchronized with the\nactions I take at the conference.\"\n\n\"Any attacks on the depot will be immediately\nspunnel-flashed by Hanno to the UIPS,\" Drummer said.\n\n\"I've thought about that,\" Narval replied. \"Brad,\nI want your man, Zolan, to install generators and\ncontrols for an electronic barrier sunside of the\nPlanet Pluto Special Zone to keep all messages from\nthe UIPS, conventional or spunnel, from passing\nthrough. Can he do it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good. I will transmit a coded message to you from\nmy ship when I have the agenda for the conference.\nThe message will tell you when to energize\nthe barrier. I must control the timing on this\noperation so precisely that the conferees have\nminimal warning before I make my announcement.\nVitally important: the electronic barrier must\ngo up sufficiently in advance of launching your\noperations against the target so that no messages\nof the attack passes through from the depot, the\nterminals site, or any UIPS ships in the area. The\ncomm-blackout will itself set off alarms throughout\nthe UIPS. By then, it will be too late for them to\ninterfere.\"\n\n\"Sounds reasonable, Mr. President,\" Brad said.\n\"Once we get the situation under control, including\nlining up the Commanders of the allied warships,\nwe can punch a hole in the barrier just big enough to\nget a flash through to you at the conference site,\ngiving you the score.\"\n\n\"Excellent, Brad, excellent.\"\n\nNarval beamed at his new Commander of Combat\nOperations and twisted his mouth into a malevolent\ngrin.\n\n\"One change,\" he said, eyes on Brad. \"Up to\nnow, the objective of your strategic planning and\ntactics has been the Depot. Now here this: the\nDepot is no longer the target. Your target is\nthe Slingshot construction site including the\n'Terminals'. You are to take control of the entire\ncomplex and hold it as my hostage. Adjust your\nplans, tactics and schedules accordingly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter THIRTY-FOUR\n\n\nThe air was stale in the alcove adjoining Brad's\noffice. Hodak and Kumiko hovered over a console,\nentering and manipulating data. They compared\ncomputations against hard print charts, entered\nnotes in manuals and drawings spread across a\nworktable, and mumbled at each other solemnly\nacross the space separating them. Adari studied\na large-scale celestial navigational chart tacked\nto the wall, Zolan tapped at a remote keyboard,\nand Myra scrutinized a spreadsheet. All were\nengrossed in their own piece of the action.\n\nBrad, entered and paused to observe them. Myra\nglanced up, waved absently as her eyes returned\nto the spreadsheet.\n\nWeaving along the tight aisle to a chair against\nthe far wall, Brad turned the chair about and sat,\nhis arms on the upper crossbar. He drew a deep\nbreath and exhaled slowly.\n\n\"Take five,\" he said. \"Let's talk.\"\n\nZolan pressed a key to save his data, Kumiko rolled\nup her chart, and Hodak put a marker in the manual.\nMyra and Adari's charts lay where they were as eyes\nfocused on Brad. The room was cramped, space for\nmoving about was tight.\n\n\"We have new orders,\" Brad said.\n\nZolan grunted, \"Ahh, nuts,\" and frowned at Brad in\ndisgust. Myra groaned and Hodak spit a sullen blast\nof profanities. Adari shrugged, and Kumiko gave Brad\nher sweet so-what-else-is-new smile.\n\nBrad recounted his meeting with Narval and Drummer.\nSo that there would be no misunderstandings\namong them, he repeated Narval's strategy and\ninstructions, finishing with the new target for the\nassault. The room was silent.\n\n\"Now that we know the construction site is the\ntarget we'll use it for working out the details for\nfleet integration, formation and logistics in place\nof what we had before,\" Brad rasped. \"Better now\nthan after we've launched and met up with our\nallies. Not much time, though. We'll be working\nround-the-clock until it's done, checked out, and\nspace and surface Commanders briefed.\"\n\nHe gave orders rapidly.\n\n\"Break out the tactical and support plans we worked\nup for the Combined Fleet's Order of Battle at\nthe Neptune meeting. Myra, rework your admin and\nmedical requirements. Install two dozen psychic\nprobes on the Dragon. We'll need at least that many\nto check out the loyalty flip-flops Narval expects\nwhen we lay the new target on the INOR Commanders,\nplus accepting Narval as their new Supreme\nCommander.\n\n\"Draft an order to Scarf for Narval's signature to\ntransfer three hundred of his shock troops from\nour attack transports to the Dragon, and crank\nits effects into tactics and logistics. Scrounge up\nenough certified technicians to operate the probes.\nThat'll still leave about eleven hundred troops to\nsecure the Terminals after we take them, which\nshould be enough. Juggle the tactics for that\nchange. If anyone asks, we're using Scarf's troops\non the Dragon as flunkies during the victory party.\nI don't think you need me to draw a picture of\nthe real reason. We've got to reshuffle the entire\nlogistics deck. Your job, Myra. Got it?\"\n\nMyra grunted, raised her middle finger, then\nquickly realigned it with the rest of her hand and\nsnapped off a mechanical salute.\n\n\"Got it,\" she said.\n\n\"Kumiko, the targets will cover an area much wider\nand deeper than you planned for in your original\ncomputations. Rework the combined fleet's weapons\ndisposition, analyze our firepower and orient them\nto the terminals' weak points. Let's talk after\nwe finish here and work up formation options and\nvectors from rendezvous. Cover surveillance and\ninterdiction against potential threats from UIPS\nassets in the Special Zone; compute tracking\nguidance for each type of weapon installed on\nPlutonian ships, and update target displays for\nour launchers and guns should it get to that.\nI especially want you to analyze the combined\nfleet's Order of Battle to identify our potential\nvulnerabilities and how an enemy force might\nexploit them. Provide me with a detailed document\nin a capsule so I can use it on the Dragon.\"\n\nBrad turned to face Hodak.\n\n\"Re-examine emergency maintenance in this new\narena. Our ships will be much further from home\nbase than when the depot was the objective. We\ncan't afford any ships dropping out of the line for\nrepairs.\n\n\"Adari, got a big one for you. The other INOR ships\nwill still rendezvous with the Plutonian fleet at\nPoint Icarus, halfway between the depot and the\nSlingshot work site. Work out the nav for our fleet\nto the rendezvous; design formations, convergence\nand other vectors that'll keep the ships out of\neach other's way. Employ Order of Battle options to\nlay out the nav for each ship of the combined fleet\nfrom Point Icarus to target. Kumiko and I will be\nworking on tac-options and we'll get them to you as\nsoon as they're ready.\n\n\"This applies to all: compute, coordinate and\ncommit resources to implement our new orders. OK.\nGet going.\"\n\nBrad motioned Zolan and Hodak closer.\n\n\"I'm putting a fast utility under your command,\nZolan. Your number one job is to build, harmonize,\ntest and whatever else it takes to create a\ncommunications interference generator. Camouflage\nand position it between the Planet Pluto Special\nZone and all sunside comm boosters, both spunnel\nand conventional. Set it up to activate by remote.\nThe screen must have enough spread to block all\nmessages, incoming and outgoing from Planet Pluto,\nthe combined fleet, plus the depot area and the\nSlingshot terminals. Exception: Narval wants us\nto flash him a message as soon as we've taken the\nobjective and turned the ships' Commanders. Fix\nthe barricade so that we can shoot a one-time\nflash-spunnel message through to him. Clear?\"\n\n\"Clear. When?\"\n\n\"Now. I'll go with you to the tunnel where the\ngenerators are stored to make sure we select the\nbest of the lot. Hodak, you come with us to give\n'em a condition check. We can't afford chances with\nthis equipment.\"\n\n ##\n\nNarval removed the tiny ear piece through which\nhe had listened to Brad give his orders, smiled with\nsatisfaction, and pressed a button along the edge\nof his desk.\n\n\"Scarf out there?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. President.\"\n\n\"In.\"\n\nScarf sidled in and stood deferentially at the\nentry.\n\n\"Don't just stand there, you idiot,\" Narval\nsnapped. \"Get up here where I can talk to you.\"\n\nScarf hastened forward and halted a couple of\nmeters from the desk. He held his helmet in one\nhand and saluted with the other.\n\n\"Here are my orders to you for while I'm gone.\nDouble the guards on Planet Pluto's spunnel\ntransmitter. No Plutonian communications are to be\npermitted to destinations outside the Special Zone.\nOne exception: I've given Drummer orders that\nwhen he completes the tasks I've assigned him, he\nis to send a flash message to me at the conference\nsite. Assign reliable technicians to open the spunnel\ncenter for only that one outgoing message.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Figure out some way to be aboard the Dragon\nduring the operation. Watch Drummer; I still don't\ntrust him. If he tries to undermine my authority\nwhile I'm away, shoot him.\"\n\n\"It'll be a pleasure, sir. What about Brad and his\nbuddies?\"\n\n\"If they resist my orders, kill them. If it does\nget to that, send me a spunnel flash after you've\ndone it. If you do kill Drummer and Brad, assume\ncontrol of the combined fleet and the Terminals.\nIf that's not possible, blast the terminals out of\nthe sky.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter THIRTY-FIVE\n\n\nZolan walked into Brad's office and dropped into\na chair, clearly exhausted.\n\n\"How'd it go?\"\n\n\"Couple of dozen screen generators in position\nsunside,\" Zolan hefted a small, flat control in his\nhand as he spoke, then tossed it on the desk.\n\n\"The energizer,\" he said quietly.\n\nBrad turned the control in his hands as he examined\neach safety lock. He slipped the control into a\npocket.\n\n\"Narval leaves for the conference in a few hours,\"\nhe said, almost in a whisper. He could not hide his\ndeep sadness.\n\nThey rose and walked together toward the door.\nWithout speaking, Zolan left and disappeared around\na bend in the corridor.\n\nThe hour of Narval's departure brought a whirl of\nexcitement to Coldfield. The transit strip from the\nofficial residence to the President's air lock had\nbeen stopped, scrubbed clean, and a padded chair\ninstalled on it for Narval's comfort.\n\nNarval boarded the strip, accompanied by his\npersonal guards. The guards took protective\npositions ahead, behind, and along the strip's\nedges, completely surrounding their leader. The\nstrip began to move and maintained a slow, steady\npace until Narval was abreast the air lock; it came\nto a smooth stop.\n\nThe air lock had been decorated with flags and\nbunting; a red carpet extended from the strip to\nthe air lock. Narval swept in and passed through\nthe inner compartment.\n\nThe Revenge, Narval's luxurious spunnel yacht was\nmoored to pylons above the air lock. The yacht's\ncommander, Captain Ras Hamdia, stood stiffly at\nthe head of a line of ship's officers inside its portal.\n\nA set of taut, parallel cables rose from the air\nlock to the ship. Fastened to the cables at the\nsurface, Narval's personal red and black lift\ncapsule was ready to transfer him aloft without\nthe inconvenience of donning a space suit.\n\nNarval entered the lift with an officer who dogged\nthe doors and flashed the ready signal.\n\n\"Up, easy,\" the ship's captain ordered.\n\nThe lift rose slowly until it reached the Revenge's\nportal. An articulated crane grasped the cabin\ngently, drew it inboard along slackened cables and\nlowered it to a mobile platform. Suited technicians\ndashed forward to disengage the cables, and the\ncapsule was pushed inside.\n\nNarval safely aboard, space tugs encircled\nthe Revenge and took positions along its hull.\nMag-beams flashed across. The Revenge disengaged\nfrom the mooring tower and drifted off. The tugs\nnudged it along to a hundred kay above the dome,\ncut their mass-attractors and the ship disappeared\ninto the node of the Planet Pluto Spunnel.\n\nNarval was off to his destiny.\n\n ##\n\nZolan stood among a throng of space-suited citizens\nbelow the Revenge, from where he watched it\nascend and move off. Minutes later, none but Zolan\nremained.\n\nAware of his awesome responsibility, a sense of\nserenity in the power of his will suffused Zolan's\nbeing. He had been faithful to the science and art\nof his chosen profession, and his devotion to the\nSentinels' mission had enriched his harmony with\nall about him. It had come to this.\n\nTilting his head back in the clear plastic helmet\nof his suit, Zolan watched the Revenge enter the\nspunnel node. He lost interest and headed for a\nspace taxi.\n\nClimbing aboard, he punched in his identifier code\nand the coordinates for a tunnel warehouse fifty\nkay distant where he had a clearance on file. The\ntaxi digested the data, reported to its master\ncontrol inside Coldfield, and received the required\npermission. The taxi rose briskly in a tight turn\nand accelerated toward a range of low hills.\n\nOut of sight beyond a hillock, Zolan reached\ninto the circuitry behind the instrument panel,\nmanipulated connections, and punched in new\ncoordinates. The taxi paused and aligned to the\nnew course, Zolan's hands on its manual controls.\nThe advance notification to control center was\ninoperative.\n\nCharon grew in size up ahead as the taxi\napproached. Zolan stabilized the flitter to hover\nstationary barely a meter above the frozen methane.\nAs he disembarked, Zolan reached behind the\ninstrument panel and readjusting the circuits.\nTransmissions from the taxi's computer would\nsoon resume and indicate a routine return from the\npreviously entered destination. Zolan watched the\ntaxi out of sight.\n\nThe distant tiny sphere that formed the solar Sun\nwas a wonder to behold against the black velvet sky\nand the clusters of distant galaxies. He absorbed\nonce more the splendor of the planets in their\ngraceful courses around the giver of life. He\nrecalled and visualized each planet, natural and\nartificial satellite and space station out to the\nGuardians. He had roamed among them all; they\nwere the only home he had known.\n\nA sense of weariness seemed to overpower him; he\ncould not delay. He searched the heavens for a star\nwith which to orient himself. Finding it, he faced\nthe direction wherein lay the secret spunnel\nbooster through which he would send his message.\nRam would know how it had come, what it meant,\nand what it had cost.\n\nZolan cleansed his mind, except for the message.\nHe closed his eyes and the strength of his\nconcentration brought on trance. A tiny glow,\ndeeply embedded in his subconscious, mushroomed\ninto a pulsing network of charged filaments. His\narms and legs throbbed, and the pain of furies cut\nthrough his torpor and slowly drained him of life\nforce. In milliseconds, his face shrunk and seamed,\nand his body collapsed in on itself. The filaments\nin Zolan's brain crackled and snapped. His brain\nexploded inside his skull as the message burst out.\nThe rigid suit held his body erect, arms extended\ntoward the Sun.\n\nStanding on the stark and lifeless plain Ram's\nstate-of-the-art modification to Zolan's brain\nand mind had completed its task.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter THIRTY-SIX\n\n\nRam Xindral, representing the UIPS, met with\nINOR's advance team on Guardian Station 16\nto plan protocols and logistics for the upcoming\nconvocation. Planet Pluto had not sent an emissary.\n\nAgreements were quickly concluded and the\ndiplomatic cadre took over to prepare an agenda\nfor the meeting's substance.\n\nSpunnel channels flashed coded messages to home\ngovernments in the Outer Region, reported on\nproblems encountered and the options available.\nInstructions flashed back, rarely agreeing with\noffered solutions, more often insisting on new\napproaches that in turn became the subjects of\nlengthy discourse. When an issue was considered\nsufficiently clarified for the convocation and\nreported to the seats of UIPS and INOR Governments,\nit was almost invariably reopened as an extension\nof still another issue. This went on and on.\n\nEventually, an agenda of sorts was fashioned\nto guide the discussions. It limited itself to\nan agreement, in principle, which identified the\nparamount issues of urgent and general concern.\nThe preliminaries over, the advance teams departed\nfor home.\n\nA fleet of UIPS transports escorted by Space Guard\nentered the Great Space that separated the Guardian\nand Jovian orbits. Hauled along by a network of\nmag-beams converging from a score of space tugs\ncame the Conference Disk, two hectometers in\ndiameter and a decameter thick at its hub.\n\nAt the agreed upon coordinates the Disk slowed\nand stabilized. The escorts drew back, clustered\nand waited.\n\nDocking slips scalloped the Disk's rim, each with\nits own hoists, articulated and flex-umbilicals,\npower junctions, and docking, launch and\nmaintenance support facilities. Emergency,\nfire-fighting, rescue, and med-evac craft dotted\nthe upper and lower surfaces. Anchored, they were\nready to service spacecraft or launch instantly\nto where they might be needed.\n\nRam and his UIPS technicians, administrators\nand security specialists boarded the Disk from\na utility transport. A INOR team entered through\nanother portal. Members of each team serving a\nChief of State inspected the suites assigned to\ntheir nation's conferees, made changes to meet\npersonal or cultural needs and, when satisfied,\ninstalled the scheduled occupant's accouterments\nand trappings of Office.\n\nEngineers and technicians swarmed throughout the\nberths and mooring docks, inspecting and testing\nequipment and procedures to accommodate\ntheir Leader's vessel, and for routine support and\nemergencies should such arise. They conducted\nor observed ship handling tests and space rescue\ncapabilities. Finally, the administrators and\ntechnicians agreed the facility was ready. The\nJoint UIPS-INOR Security Team sealed the Disk's\nportals and posted their guards in armed capsules\naround the rim and on the Disk's gently curved\nsurfaces.\n\nThey waited.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter THIRTY-SEVEN\n\n\nDrummer and Brad walked the corridor leading to\nthe Dragon's bridge. The battle cruiser, aligned with\nits sisters in countdown on catapults in galleries\nand tunnels across Planet Pluto, was minutes from\nlaunch to Point Icarus.\n\nAccompanied by a party of officers, Brad had\ncompleted the final formal inspection and sign-off\nof the Plutonian warships committed to the\noperation. Myra, Hodak, Adari and Kumiko\nhad trailed along as specialists, respectfully\nresponding to technical questions tossed at them\nby the official inspection party.\n\nThe Sentinels took Zolan's death hard, aware but\nunable to share their grief with words that might\nbe overheard by their enemy. They were in a somber\nmood difficult to hide, and Kumiko's eyes were\nred-rimmed. She spoke little.\n\nMoving from one tunnel and gallery hangar to\nanother, the inspection team had checked the\nreadiness of command and control, function systems,\nweapons readiness, logistic support and all that\nbore on their mission. Openly enthusiastic and\ncongratulatory to ships' crews on what he observed,\nBrad was inwardly appalled at the strength of\nNarval's fleet. Combined with the INOR forces\ncoming to join them at Point Icarus, the slim\nforces that the UIPS maintained in the Plutonian\nSpecial Zone faced an overwhelming adversary.\n\nAt the companionway to the command deck, Brad\ndeferred to Drummer. Drummer acknowledged\nthe courtesy with a slight smile and nod. They\nascended, and Brad closed the door.\n\nDrummer strode to the forward bulkhead, paused,\nand drew a small device from his pocket. He\nmoved casually about the compartment, meanwhile\nreading the device's indicators. Brad watched him\nin silence. After two full turns Drummer pocketed\nthe device and faced Brad.\n\n\"Routine precautions,\" Drummer said with a shrug.\n\"This deck compartment is free of both sight and\nsound bugs. How did the inspection go? Are we\nprepared and on schedule?\"\n\n\"A few glitches here and there, but nothing\nserious. I've instituted corrective actions, and\nwe'll be ready.\"\n\nDrummer nodded uneasily. Brad waited. Drummer's\nnext words came with awkward hesitation.\n\n\"Ah -- when Narval gave us his final orders, I\n-- ah -- sensed, correct me if I'm wrong, some\nmisgivings on your part.\"\n\n\"Misgivings? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Before we proceed, I must have your word that\nwhatever we discuss here will be held by you in the\nstrictest confidence. Have I your word?\"\n\nBrad stared long and hard at Drummer. He thought\nback to Scarf's accusations and threats preceding\nthe fight in the Charnel Pit. Did Drummer really\nsupport Narval? What was Drummer's real objective?\nTime was short; yet Brad had to be certain.\n\n\"You have my word.\"\n\n\"Now respond to my first statement.\"\n\n\"Affirmative.\"\n\nDrummer gave a heavy sigh and motioned Brad to a\nbench along a bulkhead. They sat and stared at the\nbulkhead opposite.\n\n\"How far will you go to take the Terminals?\"\nDrummer asked.\n\n\"Destructively?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You're in command of the combined fleet, Drummer.\nYou tell me.\"\n\nA deep silence settled between them. Drummer\nbrought his eyes around to where he could observe\nBrad's profile. His breath became shallow.\n\n\"What I now say to you, Brad, puts my life in\nyour hands, but say it I must.\" He paused, as if to\ngather strength and conviction, and to organize\nhis thoughts. \"I believe that Narval is deranged. He\nwould rather see the Solar System's civilization's\ngrovel in the dust than have them advance, even\nsurvive, without him as their ruler.\"\n\n\"Are you suggesting he be stopped?\"\n\n\"He must be.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I hoped you would know.\"\n\n\"Me? Why me?\"\n\n\"You've become the authority on the capabilities\nand tactics of this operation. The Plutonian\nmilitary Commanders respect you as a leader\nand as a professional, as do the Commanders\nof the ships soon to join us. Need I say more?\"\n\nBrad turned to face Drummer.\n\n\"How far do you commit yourself?\"\n\n\"My life.\"\n\n\"It will take that, and more.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Betrayal strips men of -- I believe the word is --\nhonor. Would you accept being a traitor to President\nNarval?\"\n\n\"If it will bring an end to this madness.\"\n\n\"Are you willing to follow my orders -- without\nquestion?\"\n\n\"To what purpose?\"\n\n\"Your words: the end of this madness.\"\n\n\"Define your terms, man. Tell me in your words, not\nmine, to what end I commit my life, and as you put\nit, my honor.\"\n\n\"Confusion and disruption throughout the combined\nfleet, destruction of Plutonian warships and,\npossibly, those of all INOR; no assault on the\nTerminals and, ultimately, removal of Narval from\nany position of authority in the Outer Region.\"\n\nDrummer nodded slowly.\n\n\"I commit myself to that purpose. And yourself?\"\n\n\"Committed.\"\n\nA knock on the door. The crewman peered in.\n\n\"Comm-center has a classified Category One spunnel\nmessage for you, Admiral Drummer,\" he said.\n\"It's in the President's personal code, sir, to which\nonly you have the keys. Have I your permission to\npick up the message and bring it to you?\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Drummer replied. \"We're heading back\nunder the dome. I'll get it.\"\n\n ##\n\nDrummer read again the message he had decoded\nand handed it to Brad who quickly scanned and silently\nreturned it. Drummer glanced at the message again\nand placed it slowly in the middle of his desk. The\ncommunication bore the dispatch symbols of the\nRevenge within the past hour. The text was brief:\n\n\"Narval to Drummer. We have left the spunnel node\nnearest the conference site, now two hours distant.\nYour launch at target must be consistent with the\nconference schedule just provided to me by the\nConference Controller.\n\n\"Based on conference agenda and schedule\nI order you to energize the communications\nbarrier immediately upon receipt of this message.\nFurther, I order you to have allegiance sworn to\nme by Commanders of all INOR ships' officers and\nthe Director of the Slingshot Construction Site\nnot more than four hours following receipt this\nmessage. Spunnel flash to me through the barrier\n'mind only' immediately upon taking the objective.\nSpunnel flash immediately to me your understanding\nof this order.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter THIRTY-EIGHT\n\n\nThe soft clicks of switches opening and closing and\nthe soft thunks of levers rammed home were the only\nsounds on the Dragon's command deck as Drummer\nand Brad climbed the companionway.\n\nCaptain Hyk, standing on the bridge platform above\nthe command deck, took them in with a quick glance,\nnodded, and continued about his business directing\nand observing the Dragon entering launch.\n\nBrad followed Drummer to a computer in a tiny\nalcove on a balcony above the plotting table. They\nswung seats out from under the table on which the\nconsole rested, sat, and Brad entered his DNA ID\nand password. He followed with instructions that\nbrought a series of real-time graphics across the\nmonitor.\n\nSelecting first one, then another, the two men\nstudied the displays, as they pointed and commented\non their observations. Drummer straightened.\n\n\"Recap, Brad,\" he ordered.\n\nBrad tapped keys and the screen listed each\nPlutonian ship in the Assault Force and its\nCommander in one column and the readiness level\nfor launch in the other.\n\nBrad pointed at the highlighted \"Fleet readiness 92\npercent.\"\n\n\"Allies?\"\n\n\"Made the trip from home stations along diverse\nroutes and under detection wraps. They're inside\nthe comm-barrier an hour from Point Icarus.\nIt'll take us that long to launch, form up, do the\ndistance, and position ourselves to receive them.\"\n\nA crewman's head appeared at the head of the\ncompanionway, looked about and fixed on Drummer.\n\n\"Call from security up at the tunnel entrance, sir.\nVisitor to see you.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\"\n\n\"Major Scarf, sir. Says he has urgent business to\ndiscuss with you.\"\n\nDrummer and Brad exchanged glances. Hyk immediately\ngave his full attention to his monitor's screen.\nDrummer knew that neither he nor Hyk could refuse\nScarf's request to come aboard. He addressed Hyk.\n\n\"Any objections, Har?\"\n\n\"None, Admiral.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Drummer glanced toward the messenger.\n\"Escort Major Scarf to my quarters.\"\n\n ##\n\nThe compartment was small, not built for comfort.\nScarf's massive frame crowded the space.\n\n\"I'm coming along.\" Scarf's tone was brusque.\n\n\"The hell you are.\" Drummer's was equally blunt.\n\nBrad eyed Scarf. \"Your job is on the surface,\" he\nsaid. \"What purpose can you serve by tagging along?\"\n\nScarf looked from Drummer to Brad and back, not\nsure whom he should address. He chose Drummer.\n\n\"Coldfield and the surrounding areas are under full\ncontrol of my security forces. I've left my deputy\nin charge, and he can contact me within seconds\nshould that be necessary. With Narval away and\nus here, there's not much going on in the Command\nSection.\"\n\nScarf tapped Drummer's chest with his forefinger,\n\"you've got more'n a thousand of my best troops for\noccupation duty on the Terminals. They're mine and\nI'm gonna lead them when they go into action. I'm\nmoving in over my on-site troop commander, that's\nall. What's more, I understand you've reassigned\nsome of my troops to this wagon. That's fine with\nme. I'll just move in with them, and assume direct\ncommand until they're back with the main group.\nEntirely proper for me to do this as chief of their\nService.\"\n\nBrad thrust his hands into his pockets to hide the\nfists they had formed. His mind worked furiously\non the new threat.\n\n\"Our plans are complete, Scarf,\" he said. \"If you\nremain, we expect you to follow orders from the\nFleet Commander.\"\n\nScarf, sure of his victory, showed his pleasure.\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" he said, a grin creasing his face,\nwaving the proviso away with the back of his\nhand. \"Anything the boss says. It's your show. I\nunderstand.\"\n\nTaking Drummer's silence as acquiescence, Scarf\npivoted in the small space and squeezed out of the\ncompartment. He barked at the guard to escort him\nto the officer-in-charge of the troop detachment.\n\nDrummer issued the launch order. One following the\nother, the warships catapulted off of their launch\ntracks, rose swiftly into space, and formed up\nbehind mine sweepers Scamp, Varlet and Scalawag.\nThe battle cruisers Dragon and Tiger, guarded by\ndestroyer screens and support ships, turned toward\nPoint Icarus.\n\nThree million kay ahead, the Slingshot terminals\nappeared as just another unblinking light in a\nrunnel of multicolored jewels.\n\nSlingshot had always been real to Brad; in the\ndeepening crisis for humankind's survival its\npurpose was profound. It had been so to him\nas far back as he could remember.\n\nBrad keyed the Slingshot complex closer on a\nnearby computer screen. Generally familiar with\nthe schematics of the Slingshot stations, he\nwas overwhelmed by the two enormous cones and\ntheir peripherals, which configured the Terminals'\nhoppers. Each terminal, almost three kay across\nits base, formed an intricate maze of interlocked\nspars, beams, panels, conduit and modules.\n\nThe Slingshot stations were centers of activity.\nInside and out, the work areas were crowded. In\nall directions were massive and intricate fusion\ngenerators, transformers and power distribution\nsystems; dozens of spherical, rectangular and\ncylindrical workshops and clusters of habitat,\nfirst aid stations, transports and tugs and barges\npushing, pulling, warping and traversing. It was a\npicture of enormous structures and modules spread\nacross the visible space ahead. The scene was\ngeometric, multidimensional, and seemingly chaotic.\n\nSeparated from each other by more than a hundred\nkay of open space, the Terminal schematic expanded\nrapidly on the Dragon's screens as the fleet\nnarrowed the gap. At Point Icarus the Slingshot\nconstruction site filled more than half the view\ntanks space.\n\nBrad and Drummer watched as changes occurred\nhastily throughout the Terminals' space. Lights\ndimmed or blacked out entirely; others increased\nintensity. Three destroyers darted through the\nprotective force field's gates, deployed, and took\ndefensive positions. A mine-layer advanced, came\nabout and laid a pattern of tac-nuclear eggs.\n\nThe Plutonian Assault Force had been quickly\ndetected. Their intentions obvious, Slingshot's\nmanagers prepared as best they could to defend\nthemselves. Scores of transports were lined up to\nescape through the gateway; those that had reached\nthe outside lumbered away toward deep space.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter THIRTY-NINE\n\n\n SOLAR LEADERS ARRIVE FOR CONFERENCE\n TRANS-SOLAR NEWS SERVICE\n FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n FLASH: SYSTEM-WIDE\n Filed at Solar Conference Site\n\nThe Leaders of the United Inner Planetary System\n(UIPS) and the Independent Nations of the Outer\nRegion (INOR) are at the place they selected to\nresolve urgent Solar System problems of mutual\nconcern. Here's how the arrangements worked out.\n\nConsistent with the schedule, the INOR guests\nflashed their international identification and ship\nnumbers to the Conference Control Center to\nreport that they had formally arrived in response\nto President Camari's invitation.\n\nConcurrently, at a signal from the UIPS President's\nship Eagle, the station flashed an array of\nmulticolored beacons. Docking berths along the\nConference Site's rim opened and controllers\ntransmitted \"Ready\" signals to the visiting\nflagships. Tugs, utilities, and emergency craft\ntook their stations.\n\nThe UIPS Eagle nosed forward and matched its\nheadings and moments to the Disk. Mass attractors\ntook over, fine-tuned the alignment and drift, and\ngently drew the Eagle a third its length into the\ndock. Mooring beams grasped the vessel and it was\ntransfixed. A red and white candy-striped umbilical\nsnaked out from the dock and sealed against the\nEagle's main portal.\n\nEagle, the host, had docked.\n\nTurning to the guests, the \"Ready\" signals flashed\nagain. Taking the lead, Planet Pluto's Revenge\nmatched up and was drawn into its docking space.\nThe others followed. The disk was transformed\ninto a multi-spoke wheel spinning slowly against\nthe backdrop of sun, planets, satellites, space\ncolonies and stars.\n\nThe umbilicals' seals tested and secure, the Heads\nof State disembarked, each followed by an entourage\nof advisors, diplomats, strategists, economists,\ninterplanetary law specialists, sociologists,\nphilosophers, and others expert in the disciplines\nappropriate to the agenda.\n\nThe parties walked along separate corridors from\ntheir docking berth to an arched entry into the\nconference theater at the hub. The pseudo-gravity\nplates had been eased to a comfortable level\nfor the inhabitants of the Outer Region. The\nrepresentatives of Earth wore soft enhancer\nboots to compensate.\n\nThe central hall was huge, and the round table at\nits center wide enough to accommodate them all.\nMassive chairs were at the table, and behind each a\nrow of smaller chairs to accommodate the lessors.\nA holoview tank, suspended halfway to the overhead,\nglowed softly. The walls were festooned with the\nemblems and insignia of all Nations in attendance.\n\nArriving under the arch, the Leaders paused.\nPresident Camari stepped away from his chair,\nhis open arms an invitation to all to enter and\njoin him at the table.\n\nEntering and approaching the table, the Leaders\nturned to right and left to greet each other.\nFormality aside for the moment, they expressed\ntheir pleasure at seeing one another again, or in\nmeeting for the first time. They came together\nat the table and formed small groups.\n\nCamari and Narval took each other's measure as they\nworked their way forward. Camari, as host, paused\nat each knot or singular meeting to shake hands\nand express his pleasure to each Head of State\nfor accepting his invitation. Politicians all, supreme\ndiplomats of the Solar Community, they accommodated\nto the occasion and replied in kind.\n\nCamari and Narval came face to face. Silence\ngripped the room.\n\n\"Greetings, President Narval,\" Camari said, \"your\npresence at this conference will contribute much\nto its success.\"\n\n\"Greeting to you, President Camari. I feel certain\nthat it will.\"\n\n\"I remind you, President Narval, these are indeed\ndesperate times. Extraordinary measures are\nessential if we are to preserve our civilizations,\nperhaps our species. Separately or collectively,\nwe must be prepared to take risks for our survival.\nDo you agree?\"\n\n\"Not only do I agree, Mr. President, but I shall\nremind you of your words as we proceed through\nthese deliberations.\"\n\n\"So be it.\"\n\nCamari nodded and turned away. With everyone's\neyes on him, he strode to his place at the table,\nspread his arms again wide in welcome, and sat.\n\nGreetings over, the Solar System's leaders took\ntheir places at the great table. Their advisors\nentered and took seats behind them.\n\nThe first convocation for the survival of the\nentire Solar Community was under way.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter FORTY\n\n\nCaptain Hyk strode the bridge impatiently.\n\n\"Point Icarus in ten minutes,\" he reported to\nDrummer and Brad as they entered the tight\ncompartment. \"The Jovians and Saturnians are\ncoming up fast, and the Neptune-Uranus team\nis close behind. Orders?\"\n\n\"You'll get yours with the rest, Har,\" Drummer's\ntone reflected his tension. He turned to Brad.\n\n\"Brad, I wish to address the Commanders of all\nPlutonian ships. Set up closed communications,\nplease.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nBrad strode to the console he and Drummer had used\nto assess the fleet's status a short while before.\nHe detached a microphone from the bulkhead nearby,\nkeyed the computer, and spoke.\n\n\"Attention, all ship Commanders of the Plutonian\nAssault Force. Rig for secure 'Commanders Only'\ncommunications with Admiral Drummer. The Admiral\nwill speak in one minute. Countdown -- start now.\"\n\nHe handed the mike to Drummer. The first of many\nuncertain steps would now be taken.\n\nDrummer glanced at the ship's chronometer, then\nat Captain Hyk.\n\nTime.\n\n\"Ship commanders, Admiral Drummer here. Our\nallies are approaching in formation and they will\nlink up with us in seven minutes at Point Icarus.\nWe must greet them properly. I order the Plutonian\nformation to come about immediately from its\nhead-on orientation to the Terminals and cluster\nto face our allies. Do it now. At Point Icarus I will\naddress the combined fleet.\"\n\nDrummer paused, then added, \"I am turning over the\ndetails of this change in formation to my Chief of\nCombat Operations. Follow his instructions without\nhesitation.\"\n\nDrummer handed the microphone to Brad and stepped\nback. Brad rattled off the revised orientations\nand positions, ship by ship listed in the Order of\nBattle. Both he and Drummer watched the effects\nin the observation pit's view tank.\n\nAs Brad spoke the close order of the original\nformation dissolved and opened. The maneuver\nwas extremely complex, but within minutes the\nships had come about in a ragged formation to\nface their oncoming allies.\n\nOut of the corners of his eyes Brad observed Hyk\ninput orders to the Dragon's guidance control and\nnavigation centers. Hyk glared at Drummer as if\nthe man was out of his mind. Brad expected the\nother Commanders to be equally perplexed and\nangered by the unexpected reorientation.\n\nDrummer, by his order without prior notice and\nplanning, had completely disrupted the Plutonian\ntactical formation. Valuable time would be spent to\nsort out the confusion and array for the assault.\n\n ##\n\nCaptain Yargoul, Commander of the Jovian Combined\nStrike Team, stood on the bridge of the Battle\nCruiser Windstorm and scowled into his view tank.\nThe unconventional redeployment of the Plutonian\nAssault Force amazed and appalled him.\n\n\"What in hell are they doing?\" Yargoul pointed at\nthe tank as his Executive stared aghast over his\nshoulder.\n\n\"Damned if I can tell, Captain Yargoul,\"\nreplied his deputy. \"This isn't called for in the\nrendezvous plan.\"\n\n\"I don't like it. Get nav on this right now and\npass the word to our ships' Commanders. Assume\na waiting formation ten thousand kay from the\nrendezvous. Get the Commanders of the Saturnian\nand Neptune-Uranus teams into a closed conference\ncall with me. I'm going to suggest they do the same\nuntil we find out what this is all about.\"\n\n\"They smell the rat,\" Brad thought as he watched\nthe oncoming fleets slowly alter their formations.\nHe hastily left the command deck.\n\nWalking swiftly along a passageway he passed Hodak\nat a workbench calibrating instruments as cover.\nTheir eyes met and Brad moved on. Hodak switched\noff his test panels and headed toward a side\npassageway.\n\nMyra, checking medical supplies in a wall cabinet,\nglanced at Hodak's features as he brushed by. His\ngrunt caused her to close the cabinet and walk off.\nKumiko and Adari would soon have the message.\n\n ##\n\nThe storage compartment was tiny, barely enough\nto hold them.\n\n\"Drummer will be talking to all ships' Commanders\nin the combined fleet in less than a minute,\" Brad\ntold them. \"I want to be there when he does so\nthat I can deal with their reactions. Also, Hyk is\na problem. I expect they'll all line up against us,\nincluding the Plutonian crews. The best we can\nhope for is a short delay while they argue among\nthemselves. It's up to the five of us; six, really,\nif I can count on Drummer.\"\n\nBrad looked from one tense face to the other.\n\n\"Hodak, your first job is Scarf. As soon as he\nhears Drummer he'll come charging up with his\ngoons to take over the ship. Stop him.\"\n\n\"Kumiko, to the ship's fire controls. Do as much\ndamage there as you can without being detected.\nI want as many as possible of the Dragon's\nlong-range guns inoperative.\"\n\nHe turned to Myra.\n\n\"Suit up and head for the hangar deck where\nthe two-place fighter-bombers are in position for\nlaunch. Tell the officer-in-charge I sent you to\ncheck combat readiness. I want three two-place\njobs up front on catapults, fully charged and armed,\nhot and ready for launch. The officer on duty is\nsure to ask why it's you that's giving the orders.\nJust say that the fighters are going after the\nTerminals' minelayers and destroyers that just\npopped out through the force field's gate. Tell him\nI'm briefing the pilots personally and will send you\nalong as my observer. He won't like it, but I doubt\nthat he'll interfere.\"\n\n\"Got it.\"\n\n\"Remain on the flight deck, Myra. Move around and\nspot where each guard is stationed. When you see\nus coming, start to take them down. Pinpoint their\npositions to us as we come in so we can clean them\nall out fast. Confusion in the ranks works to our\nadvantage.\"\n\nTurning to Adari, he asked, \"Did you put it\ntogether?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Come with me back to the bridge. I'll brief you on\nthe way.\"\n\nHis look took them all in.\n\n\"Gather round -- close.\"\n\nSpeaking rapidly, not wasting words, Brad shared\ninformation that Ram passed to him before his\ndeparture.\n\n\"A UIPS battle fleet should be loading about now\ninto an expanded spunnel gateway off Luna. They'll\nbe here shortly. If Drummer doesn't neutralize\nthe INOR fleet, the job will be taken on by the UIPS.\nBut they'll need time to re-group as they enter\nthis arena. Our job is to keep the INOR fleet off\nbalance until ours is ready.\n\n\"Everyone is to be suited-up and checked out for\nextended combat. Except for Myra, spread along\nthe corridor as close to the Flight Deck hatch as\nyou can without drawing attention. Keep a low profile\nand wait for my signal. I expect Drummer will be\nwith me and we'll all go in together. Go now.\"\n\n ##\n\nDrummer's voice was heard throughout the combined\nfleet. His tone was grave.\n\n\"This is Admiral Drummer. My words are, first, for\nCommanders of this combined fleet. Beyond that,\nI speak to all ships' crews and troops who make up\nthis task force, and for all men and women within\nreach of my voice, whatever your nationality or\nwhomever your leader.\n\n\"We are confronted with a dilemma. The mission\nassigned to this fleet is to capture the Slingshot\nTerminals. Slingshot and all that it represents\nwill then become hostage to the negotiations now\ntaking place between INOR and the United Inner\nPlanetary System.\n\n\"If denying the UIPS access to their Terminals for\na brief period was the real objective, I would have\nno qualms in moving forward. But the orders given to\nme by President Narval go much further, and I must\nshare them with you so that you will understand\nwhat we face.\"\n\nCaptain Hyk's eyes narrowed and he took steps\ntoward Drummer. Brad, standing silently behind Hyk,\ncovered the distance to the door he had closed when\nhe returned to the command deck. He shoved the\nlocking dog closed. Turning back his hand brushed\nhis sidearm, releasing the safety. Hyk halted\nseveral paces from Drummer, who ignored him.\n\n\"With heavy heart, I must now inform you that\nPresident Narval has a deeper strategy,\" Drummer\ncontinued, \"one that presents a clear and present\ndanger to all nations and peoples of INOR, and\nperhaps to the entire Solar Community. I state it\nas simply as I can: Narval's strategy is betrayal.\"\n\nThe way back had closed; Drummer plunged ahead.\n\n\"Here are the orders given to me by our President.\nJudge their purpose and their honor for yourselves.\nFirst, to capture and hold the Terminals. As soon\nas the Terminals are taken and secured, I am\nunder orders to subvert all ships' Commanders\nof our allies so that they swear allegiance only\nto Narval. Those who refuse, under psychic probe\nverification, are to be killed on the spot.\n\n\"If this is done, Narval will have consolidated\nenough military power to dominate the entire Outer\nRegion. When his position is firm, his strategy is\nto use Slingshot to force the UIPS to its knees,\nand establish himself as ruler over the entire\nSolar System. These are the real objectives of\nPresident Narval of Planet Pluto. If we follow\nhis orders, have no doubt that he will attain his\ndiabolic objectives.\n\n\"I refuse to comply with those orders. I urge all\nCommanders of INOR ships and forces to return\nto their home stations and report to their Heads of\nState who are now attending the Solar Convocation.\nEstablish boards of inquiry, or conduct such\ninvestigations as you feel appropriate. But do not\nproceed with this adventure concocted in the mind\nof a madman. It means disaster for us all.\n\n\"I am now opening this channel for replies from\nthe Senior Commanders of the combined fleet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter FORTY-ONE\n\n\nCaptain Yargoul's face, inflamed with rage, flashed\non the screen.\n\n\"By what right do you take this on yourself,\nDrummer?\" he exploded.\n\n\"I choose to be a free man, Captain Yargoul, and\nhave spoken as one.\"\n\n\"I don't believe President Narval gave you orders\nto turn us against our own Governments.\" Yargoul's\neyes glittered his suspicion. \"What's your game,\nDrummer?\"\n\n\"Those were indeed the orders given to me by\nNarval. As for my 'game', as you put it, it is,\nfirst, to take Planet Pluto out from under tyranny;\nand second, to bring reason to the negotiations now\ntaking place between INOR and the UIPS. You cannot\nhelp me with the first, but you and all honorable\ncitizens of the INOR federation share in the\nobligation to help with the second. With whom do\nyou stand, Captain Yargoul?\"\n\n\"I stand against you, Drummer, and I charge you\nwith treason against your Government and disloyalty\nto our cause. You are not fit to lead this fleet.\nAs ranking officer next in line I now challenge your\nright to act as Supreme Commander of this Combined\nFleet. I hereby replace you in that capacity and\nassume command.\" His voice rang with the power of\nhis new authority.\n\n\"Captain Hyk, take Admiral Drummer into custody.\nIf he resists, shoot him.\"\n\nDrummer switched off the communications console\nand turned to face Hyk.\n\n\"And you, Har, you're a Plutonian and should\nunderstand, better than most where the real\ntreachery lies. You've seen Narval's psychic probes\nplaced on board and must have suspected what they\nand Scarf's troops aboard must mean. Think, man.\nTell me I can count on you.\"\n\n\"I'm an officer in the service of President\nNarval,\" Hyk growled, \"and I remain loyal to him.\nI accept that Captain Yargoul has replaced you as\nSupreme Commander of the Combined Fleet. The\nPlutonian forces in this combined fleet now come\nunder my command. Drummer; I place you under\narrest. If you resist I won't hesitate to shoot you\ndown where you are.\"\n\nHyk drew his weapon and aimed it at Drummer.\n\n\"Easy does it, Har.\"\n\nBrad spoke from where he stood off to the side.\nHyk shifted his focus and saw the weapon raised\nin Brad's grip. Reacting instinctively, he crouched\nand swung toward Brad, the nozzle of his gun\nflaring. A tight beam laced across Hyk's chest,\nand he crumpled to the deck. Brad slipped his gun\nback into its sheath.\n\nCaptain Yargoul's commanding voice blasted from\nthe ship's loudspeakers, addressing the fleet.\n\n\"All ships' Commanders. You've heard and witnessed\nAdmiral Drummer's treasonous statements. I am\ncompelled, by circumstances, to assume command\nof the Combined Fleet. You will follow my orders;\nI order that any commander or crew-member who\nrefuses to recognize my authority is to be disarmed,\nand imprisoned. Those who resist will be shot\nimmediately.\n\n\"The target stands: we will move on the Slingshot\nTerminals and take them. I order the fleet to array\nitself for the assault. Unfortunately, Drummer has\nsabotaged our rendezvous, and we must reconstitute\nthe assault formation. My chief navigator will\nissue sector orientation and vectors to each ship\nin the fleet so that we can form up for combat\noperations. Follow his orders without question.\"\n\nAs Yargoul spoke Brad released the clip securing\nthe door and yanked it open. Adari rushed in and\ndarted to the communications console, drawing\na comm capsule from her tunic. She slipped the\ncapsule into the computer slot, slapped switches\nand pressed keys. She looked at Brad. He nodded.\nAdari pressed the final key. A light flashed red;\nthe message on the capsule went out to the fleet.\n\nA deep voice issued from the ship's speakers:\n\"This is Captain Yargoul's chief navigator,\" it began.\n\"Here are the formation positions for each ship\nin our Order of Battle. Use as your reference\nAnnex X-ray to the Slingshot Assault Plan. Comply\nimmediately upon receipt of your ship's new\ncoordinates. Jovian Battle Cruiser Boulder and\ndestroyer screen to Sector Alpha, coordinates\nR784-212-426; Saturnian Battle Cruiser Encounter\nand destroyer screen to Sector Gamma, coordinates\nR784-856-275; Plutonian Battle Cruisers Dragon\nand Tiger and screen to Sector Beta, coordinates...\"\n\nAdari grinned at Drummer who was staring at her.\n\n\"Lucked out,\" she said. \"Yargoul brought his chief\nnavigator along to Brad's planning meeting off\nNeptune. His voice was on our tapes, and easy to\nsynthesize. Even Yargoul himself won't know the\ndifference. The capsule is transmitting orders to\neach ship of the fleet to move to new coordinates\nin a three-dimensional tract. This redeployment\nwill get them so screwed up it'll take 'em a while\nto even figure out which way is sunside.\"\n\n\"But how did you know events would develop just\nthis way?\"\n\nAdari winked; tapped her temple with her forefinger.\n\n\"Just put myself in their place, and figured the\noptions,\" she said and turned to Brad.\n\n\"Do you have all the data on where you've sent\nthem?\" Brad asked.\n\nAdari patted her pocket and nodded.\n\n\"Figured we'd need the information. Run a copy for\neach fighter. Meet us on the flight deck.\"\n\nDrummer snatched up Hyk's weapon as he followed\nAdari who raced out of the bridge compartment.\nBrad motioned Drummer to join Adari.\n\nBrad followed and pulled the door closed behind\nhim. He drew his sidearm, narrowed the beam to its\nminimum and its power to maximum. He directed the\nbeam into the space between the door and the frame.\nWithin seconds the door had fused shut. The Dragon's\nbridge, at least for the moment, was isolated.\n\n ##\n\nHodak crouched behind a massive generator at the\nbend of an L-shaped corridor. The rapid-fire beam\nrifle in his hands was energized and safety off.\nThe passageway had a single entry to the bay in\nwhich Scarf and his troops were quartered. Hodak\nhad a free field of fire. He did not expect a long\nwait.\n\nDrummer's appeal to the fleet commanders cut\ninto the talk and laughter rolling down the corridor.\nDrummer's opening words brought complete silence.\nLong before it ended Hodak heard shouts and curses\nfrom the bay. Scarf's heavy voice rose above the\nclamor, giving orders. Hodak drew breath, raised\nand leveled the weapon. He hoped Scarf would come\nout first; that would simplify his job.\n\nScarf did not. Instead, armed troops spilled from\nthe bay, crowding the passageway. Scarf followed,\nhis coarse features congested.\n\n\"There's five of 'em, plus Drummer,\" he shouted.\n\"Search the ship. You know who they are. Shoot\n'em on sight. I want them dead.\"\n\nHodak tried to draw a bead on Scarf but troopers\nblocked the line of fire. Several started in his\ndirection. He cut a swath through them, searching\nfor Scarf.\n\nThe first streaks of concentrated energy wrought\nhavoc in the forward ranks. The stench of burning\nflesh came at him with a rush, and the corridor\nreverberated with howls and screeches of agony.\nUnaware of what they were up against, the troops\nmilled about in confusion. They clawed at each\nother in panic to get back into the bay and out\nof the line of fire. Scarf was somewhere in the\nstruggle.\n\nThe tiny receiver in Hodak's ear came alive.\n\n\"Sentinels. Flight deck. Now.\"\n\nHodak directed a final lengthy barrage of rifle\nbursts at the entry. Molten metal and sparks\nbounced off the frames in all directions, followed\nby screams and shrieks from inside the compartment.\n\n\"Unfinished business,\" Hodak muttered as he turned\nand raced off.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter FORTY-TWO\n\n\nThe watch was changing on the flight deck. Up ahead\nBrad saw three guards and two technicians entering\nto take their posts; moments later an equal number\ncame out and disappeared down a companionway.\nShip's crew strolled the passageways and on\nbusiness in and out of maintenance shops, or\nengrossed in discussions with companions about\nDrummer's appeal.\n\nFew noticed Brad or his companions; those who\ndid gave them a passing glance and moved on.\nThe ship was preparing for action, and armed,\nsuited-up crews were to be expected.\n\nBrad signaled a pause. Adari, in flight gear as the\nothers were, joined them and stood with Kumiko\nlaughing and talking through open visi-plates.\nHodak, against a bulkhead, held a maintenance\nmanual, slowly flipping pages, apparently reading.\nBrad and Drummer moved short distances along\nthe corridor, seemingly in thoughtful conversation.\nThe scene reflected routine.\n\nThe traffic thinned momentarily. Brad looked\nquickly along the corridor and motioned. They\nconverged toward the companionway leading to\nthe flight deck.\n\nBrad entered first, followed by Hodak, Adari,\nDrummer and Kumiko. Inside, Kumiko swung the\nhatch shut and dogged it.\n\nMyra, pressed into a corner against the far\nbulkhead by the Chief of the Flight Deck, smiled\nup at him, eyes wide. Big and chunky, he talked\nfast, trying to convince her of something that\nhe obviously believed was good for both of them.\n\nSeeing Brad appear at the head of the companionway,\nMyra pushed the hulk away with one hand and drew\nher weapon with the other. Before he knew what was\nhappening, the fleshy man with the high hopes was\nflat on the deck, out of it.\n\nStooping and pointing, Myra circled toward Brad.\n\n\"Two, there, rifles.\" In another direction. \"One,\non the catwalk, rifle.\" Over her shoulder. \"Two in\nthe control room, sidearms, but they may have\nrifles stashed close by. Fighters on the cats,\nready to go but still on control room switches.\"\n\nBrad snapped out orders.\n\n\"Hodak and Kumiko, control room. Switch the\nfighters to self-launch. Adari, the guy on the\ncatwalk. Myra and Drummer, suit up and into\nthe first ship.\"\n\nHodak and Kumiko charged into the control room\nbefore Brad finished speaking. Red and orange\nflashes and a clatter erupted through the doorway,\nfollowed by silence. Hodak and Kumiko tore out,\nbent low, splitting to right and left. They carried\nrifles raised into firing position.\n\nAdari, eyes and gun elevated, skirted the fighters.\n\n\"What the hell's goin' on down there?\" The shout\ncame from a guard on a balcony above. \"Who're\nyou guys?\"\n\nThat's all it took. Shots followed each other\nclosely. The guard fell slowly in the ship's light\npseudo-gravity.\n\nHodak ran to join Brad. Kumiko headed for the\nfighters to switch the catapults' activators to\ninternal controls, arm and charge the guns, and\ninsert into each ship's computer the capsules\nAdari had passed to her.\n\nA guard darted by Brad and took cover behind\na line of massive consoles. A succession of rifle\nblasts cracked through the air close above Brad.\nCrouching, he raised his weapon and fired. The\nguards would be difficult to get at.\n\n\"Down, Brad, flat.\"\n\nHodak's hoarse whisper carried from two meters\nbehind Brad. As he ducked a soft swishing sound\nsliced above his head. Glints of light sparkled\nfrom a curved, shiny object. Seconds later, the\nboomerang returned, wetly red.\n\n\"Go, Brad.\"\n\nHodak wiped and collapsed the boomerang and slipped\nit into a sheath along the thigh of his space suit.\n\nMotioning Hodak forward to climb into the nearest\nfighter, Brad followed. The others, already in\nplace, were racing through their checklists.\n\nBrad began his preflight as he switched his comm\nto 'on'.\n\n\"Myra, Drummer, do you read?\"\n\n\"Loud and clear.\"\n\n\"Adari-Kumiko?\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"Kumiko, did you fix our inter-ship comm the way\nZolan told you to?\"\n\n\"Fixed. They'll have to search and analyze dozens\nof scramble channels to find and fix on ours. We\nhave a private and moving channel.\"\n\n\"OK. Check suits. Batten down and seal up. Now\nhear this.\"\n\nBrad stroked control panel keys, switches and\nlevers as he talked.\n\n\"Call signs: Hodak and I are One; Adari and Kumiko,\nyou're Two, and Myra and Drummer, Three. The job is\nto keep 'em confused and stumbling over each other\nfor as long as we can, and hope for the best. The\ncapsule Adari slipped into your computer has the\ncoordinates and formation we hope they've assumed.\nBy now they're well into the faked redeployment.\nWe're dealing in seconds, minutes if we're lucky.\n\n\"The deployment we triggered concentrates them in\nthree sectors: Alpha, Beta, Gamma. Hodak and I will\ntake Alpha, Adari and Kumiko, you've got Beta; Myra\nand Drummer to Gamma. Your sector coordinates are\nin the capsule; use standard locks to interface the\ncoordinates with your ship's flight controls. Go for\ncommand decks, weapons control centers, thrusters\nor other vitals where disabling is money. Try for\nbattle cruisers, but don't ignore other targets of\nopportunity. Keep your explosive decompressors\nand laser-quads at max. Talk as you work so we all\nknow what's happening. Go.\"\n\nThe signals from Brad's control panel had their\neffect. The rushing sound of escaping air told them\nthe huge portal was opening. Within seconds the\nbattlefield stretched before them.\n\nBrad hit the catapult release. The ship lunged\nforward. As it cleared the flight deck, Brad maxed\nthe thrusters. Hodak glanced back over his shoulder.\n\n\"Two and Three are clear,\" he announced.\n\nThe three fighters skewed sharply toward their\nassigned sectors.\n\n\"Two talking. Battle Cruiser Intruder coming up.\nRange: 2500 K. Destroyer screen not tight enough.\nEx-decomp at max. Range: 2000 -- 1000 -- 400. Three\nsecond burst. On target, but about 50 meters aft the\nbridge. Gotta go around for another try, dammit.\n\n\"Back at 900 -- 500. Incoming laser-quads. 300.\nTwo second burst and breaking port. What do you\nsee, Adari?\"\n\n\"Made it this time, kiddo. Bridge collapsed. But\nmove this baby's tail. I can almost feel their\nheat.\"\n\n\"Three to One. Skip to Channel C for a sec and\nyou'll hear Scarf. They must have cleared the\nDragon's bridge. He's giving orders to the P-fleet\nto line up for a hit at the Terminals. Looks like\nhe wants a kind word from his boss. I'm heading\nback to the Dragon.\n\n\"Dragon coming up. Range: 1700 K. Spotted us.\nHave incoming. You didn't down all their guns, Kumiko.\nLousy shooters, though. At 1400 -- 700 -- 300.\nDecomp on sustained -- Five second burst. Passing\nover. What's the word, Myra?\"\n\n\"Their stern sucked a lemon. Totaled. Hold\nit. Fighter catapulted off the flight deck. It's\nclosing with a Dragon screen destroyer. Get back\nto 'Channel C', it may be Scarf talking.\"\n\nHe was.\n\n\"Major Scarf to Destroyer Viper. I'm coming aboard\nand taking command of the Planet Pluto Assault\nForce. Notify all Plutonian units to be ready to\nattack the Terminals and inflict maximum damage.\nThose orders come directly from President Narval.\nI'll lay out the attack formation as soon as I'm\naboard.\"\n\n\"Two to One. Hear that? The fighter has matched\nup and I see Scarf in transfer.\"\n\nA momentary silence.\n\n\"Comin' round the bend and linin' up. They see\nus and know we ain't their lovers. Destroyer had\nto stabilize to bring Scarf aboard; now they're\nhustlin'. I'll give 'em the nose decomps, as we\nslip under. 500 kay -- 350 -- decomps on -- goin'\nunder.\"\n\n\"Blowout -- they're gone. Hey, Hodak, takes care\nof your buddy.\"\n\n\"He was no buddy of mine. OK, Two. Move it, Brad.\"\n\nBrad searched for the Windstorm, Yargoul's battle\ncruiser, now the combined fleet's flagship. Two\nand Three had scored hits in the tight field,\nsignificantly diminishing the fleet's capabilities.\nIf the Windstorm could be taken out, or even\ndamaged, the enemy fleet's command-and-control\nwould be seriously degraded.\n\nTwo destroyers converged on Brad from 11 and 1\no'clock. Brad switched to their channel.\n\nBrad reacted instinctively. His feet slammed\nfootpads as his arms and hands yanked and\ntwisted the other controls. The sensitive fighter\ncorkscrewed and hurtled away just as laser-quad\nbeams from both destroyers crossed where he\nhad been a fraction of a second before. Jiggling\nreversers and thrusters, he space-skidded into a\ntight half circle and dived under the closest ship.\nKiller beams tracked him but the arc couldn't\ncatch up.\n\nPassing under, Hodak cut loose with his\nlaser-quads, raking laterally across the\ndestroyer's underside. At the close range the\ndamage was devastating. The destroyer split\napart along the shock line with a silent, flaming\nexplosion.\n\nBrad spun the ship about and fired the bow\nexplosive decompressor at the other destroyer. The\ndestroyer crumpled into a twisted mass of metal.\n\nVeering off, Brad searched his instruments for\nsigns of battle cruisers. Hoping for a lead, he\nflipped the switch to Channel C and caught the tail\nend of a transmission: \"...enemy formation is now\nchanging course to close with us. They are centered\non coordinates H010 and V210. Distance: 5 point\n2 million kilometers, closing fast. Tracking, and\nwill report. This is Lieutenant Asto, Commander\nof Titan Patroller Group. Out.\"\n\nBrad felt a surge of elation. Drummer reached\nacross the intervening space and pounded his\nshoulder. Was it possible? The next voice on\nChannel C dispelled his doubts.\n\n\"This is Fleet Commander Yargoul to all Commanders\nof the INOR Combined Fleet. UIPS battle fleet has\njust emerged from behind a comm screen sunside\nof Planet Pluto. The screen was erected to keep\nthe Logistics Depot and the Slingshot work site from\ncommunicating with their government during this\noperation. Unfortunately, it also kept us from\nmessages dispatched by our own headquarters.\nThe UIPS fleet is still out of range, but closing\nfast. All INOR ships accelerate transition into battle\nformations and stations. Point for convergence is\ncoordinate H010-V210. Attention: Commander of\nPlutonian Destroyer Group Two. Have one of your\nsquadrons remain in this sector and to take out the\ninterceptors that have been harassing our fleet and\nthen catch up with us. Out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter FORTY-THREE\n\n\n\"One to Two and Three.\"\n\nBrad quickly briefed the Sentinels on the\ntransmissions. It brought a grunt from Hodak, a\nsigh of relief from Myra, a squeal of delight from\nKumiko, and a sarcastic \"Well, it's about time,\"\nfrom Adari.\n\n\"Brad.\" It was Drummer's voice.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"This conversation confirms feelings I've had since\nwe joined forces against Narval, but I'd like to ask\nthe question nevertheless.\"\n\n\"No need to, Drummer. I was going to tell you at\nthe first opportunity after you made your appeal\nto the ships' Commanders. Your feelings were right:\nwe're all members of a UIPS team sent to Planet\nPluto to keep Narval, and anyone else, from\ninterfering with Slingshot. Our job is far from\nfinished.\"\n\nDrummer lapsed into silence.\n\n\"Shouldn't we give our side a rundown on what's\nhappening?\" Myra asked.\n\n\"To do that we'd have to use unsecured channels,\"\nBrad replied.\n\n\"As soon as we do that we're in the open. Yargoul\nwill get a fix on us, and pick us off with their\nlong-range particle beamers. Right now we're\nspecks in a crowded and still disorganized field,\nand that's our only protection. These fighters are\nPlutonian, and that's part of our cover.\"\n\n\"Well, look,\" Adari sounded frustrated. \"We've been\ncarrying the ball for quite a spell. Our folks are\nhere and ready to take over. We know where\nthey're at; let's give 'em our report in person.\nThen, maybe, I can wash my hair. I feel a mess.\"\n\n\"This fleet still has a helluva lot of firepower\nleft.\" Hodak's voice was grim and brusque. \"We're\nright among 'em. We're 'point' for our side.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" Brad said. \"Our job has changed:\nwe're eyes and ears for our people, even while\nwe're running interference. It's not over for us\nuntil the fleets are within range of each other,\nand then we'd damn well better be out of the way.\"\n\nHe paused to scan the arena, and added: \"I'll break\ninto 'clear' in two minutes to give our people a\nsitrep. Don't waste time on the INOR squadron\nthey're leaving behind to get us off their back.\nHead for the UIPS fleet in two minutes. Hold\noutside of their perimeter until I find out what\nthey need from us. If you run into Yargoul's fleet\nalong the way, shoot first.\"\n\n\"Three to One. Comin' up on a cruiser. The\nprotective screen on this one is tightenin' up\nand it'll be a hard nut to crack. Got me a tail-end\ncharlie minesweeper. I'll give it a try. At 1300\nkay -- 800 -- 400. Two seconds burst right up\nthe thrusters. Gone. They've marked us. We got\nlaser-quads incoming. Into e-e-e-v-a-a-sive. Man,\nthis baby's got speed. Out of it. OK, One and\nThree. They're organized again and sure as hell\nknow we're jabbin' at 'em. Ain't gonna be easy to\nget outta here.\"\n\n\"Two here. I hear you, Three. Got a couple of\ndestroyers off my starboard bow. Coming around\nfor a nose job. We're marked. Got incoming, lots\nof it. At 1200 -- 800 -- 300. Two sec...\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"One to Two. Come in.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nA guttural howl of anguish tore through Brad's\nearphone. Myra.\n\n\"I'm heading over, Brad,\" she screamed, her voice\nhoarse and breaking.\n\nBrad didn't stop her, nor did he want to.\n\nThe battle cruiser Windstorm, surrounded by its\ndestroyer screen, was in sight. Brad weighed his\nchances on getting close enough for an effective\nshot.\n\nStudying the scene, Brad did not, at first, see the\ngray sphere separate from the Windstorm and plunge\nahead. Hodak did, paled, and pointed wordlessly.\nBrad stared at the sphere. His heart pounded.\n\nThe Windstorm had launched a guided fusion warhead.\nThe target was obvious.\n\nBrad knew the warhead's capabilities from the\nNeptune briefings. The Windstorm carried a K12,\na fifteen meter-diameter warhead capable of\ndestroying a natural minor satellite or a large\npopulated colony. The bomb's mass was such that\na heavy cruiser could carry no more than one. One\nwas all that would be needed to decide the battle.\nThe fireball had a two thousand-kay radius, and the\npiggybacked neutronic dispenser, once the cloud was\nreleased by the detonation, would inflict radiation\ndeath throughout tens of thousands of kay in all\ndirections.\n\nThe UIPS fleet faced annihilation, as did Slingshot.\n\nBrad reacted instinctively. He jerked his ship\naround and pumped max thrust after the speeding\nwarhead.\n\nA second later his mind snapped back from its\nmomentary panic.\n\n\"One to Three.\" He recounted the facts. \"If Two has\nsurvivors get them on board, or lash them to the\nsides, or whatever makes sense. Then catch up with\nus at max and give us a hand.\n\n\"These warheads are coated against detection in the\nold stealth style. I've got to warn our fleet what's\ncoming so they can go evasive as much as they\ncan. Our fleet's break from course or formation will\nmess up any tactics they have in mind. They won't\nhave time to form up even if they do escape the\nblast and radiation zones. Firing at the warhead\nwon't help, even at close range. It's wrapped in\nso many layers of armor even particle-beamers\ncan't penetrate, so I don't know what our explosive\ndecompressors and laser-quads can do. But we've\ngot to try.\"\n\n ##\n\nTwo was a twisted, gray mass in a slow tumble when\nThree drew close. Myra reduced power in her ship's\nmagnetic beams and directed them at the wreck\nuntil it stabilized. She maneuvered until the ships\ntouched. The beams held.\n\nMyra pushed the canopy clear, climbed out, and\ncrawled forward. She grasped a jagged projection on\nthe wreck, swung aboard, and stared into what had\nbeen the control pit. She turned away and returned\nto her ship without looking at Drummer. Laser quads\nleft little organic residue.\n\n ##\n\nBrad switched to standard communications channels\nand keyed in his identity. In a moment they were\nswitched to a channel closed to outsiders.\n\n\"Sentinel One to UIPS Fleet Comm Center.\nAcknowledge.\"\n\nThe reply was swift.\n\n\"UIPS Comm to Sentinel One. We read.\"\n\n\"Sentinel One. Flash Immediate. Must talk to Fleet\nCommander. Fleet in extreme and immediate danger.\nNow, partner, now.\"\n\n\"Selvin here.\"\n\n\"Sentinel One. Enemy Battle Cruiser Windstorm has\nlaunched a K12 fusion warhead. I do not question\nthe warhead's vector; expect that its mass\nattractors and proximity fuses are set to your\nfleet's coordinates.\n\n\"I am overtaking the warhead and will try to\nneutralize. Forcing a change in warhead direction\nwith my ship is not possible; the warhead's mass\nand guidance system exceeds by far any pressure\nmy fighter can exert. Suggest you consider\nevasive action; will advise further if neutralization\naccomplished.\"\n\nThe warning had been given. There was no time for\ntalk. The warhead was less than a hundred meters\nahead, and closing.\n\nDrummer tapped Brad on the shoulder and pointed.\nTwo was coming up.\n\nCold sweat drenched Brad's forehead and drained\ninto his eyes. He blinked, shook his head to clear\nhis vision, and increased airflow in his suit.\n\n\"Brad,\" Myra's voice, fast. \"Can we detonate it\nwith our guns from here? At this extremely close\nrange the concentrations of laser-quads and\nexplosive decompress energy by both of us at\na single point might disable some part of the\nwarhead or set it off.\"\n\n\"It would take too much time to cut through. I've\ngot another idea. If it doesn't work, we won't have\nenough time to try anything else. Hodak, take the\ncontrols and get the ship as close to the bomb\nas you can, go for less than a meter from the\nwarhead's surface. Hold and orbit slowly, nose\nclose to the warhead so that I can scope the\nsurface. I'll tell you when to stop. Myra, keep\nclose above in my line-of-sight. Hodak, strap\non your tool kit.\"\n\nHodak maneuvered the ship close and set a pattern\nthat covered the sphere methodically. Brad opened\nthe canopy, and directed the ship's beacon at the\nbland, gray surface. Seconds passed; the bomb's\ngray coating was unbroken. Or was it?\n\n\"Stop,\" Brad ordered.\n\nHe pointed to a barely visible circular crack half\na meter across.\n\n\"Myra. Get closer. Use your attractors to stabilize\nand hold position. Give me a hand, Hodak.\"\n\nBrad climbed over the side. The light\ngravity-enhancer soles of his space boots provided\nbarely enough adherence to the warhead's surface.\nSliding, he made his way to the finely marked\ncircle, Hodak close behind.\n\n\"Access to the calibration cavity,\" Brad said as\nhe stooped, shed his outer glove, and felt around\nthe mating edge. \"The bomb has to have a place to\ninsert fuse and trajectory data and fine tune the\ninitial settings. The well is closed with a plug as\nthick as the armor, and it's rotated into place. The\nplug's outer coating is the same composition as on\nthe rest of the casing. Cut a radial slot along the\nedge of the cover. We'll push to rotate the cover\ncounter-clockwise; it'll take both of us to work it\nloose.\"\n\n\"Why not cut out the entire plug?\"\n\n\"Too much time. The shell is too thick.\"\n\nHodak grunted, withdrew a cutting tool from his\nkit and after much effort formed a shallow, slanted\ngroove in the well cover. A heavy metal pry bar\ncame next. Squatting, he forced the flat end into\nthe notch and pushed. The energy to push forced\nhis body in the opposite direction.\n\n\"Closer, Myra.\"\n\nAt arm's length, and the ship immobilized by its\nmags, Hodak braced his back against the fuselage\nand tried again. He felt the bar bottom in the\nnotch.\n\nBrad squatted beside Hodak and, using the fighter's\nmass to steady themselves, they pushed. The pressure\nscraped the plug's surface, but remain fast. They\nmade a fresh cut, braced themselves, and pushed,\nsweat pouring from their faces. Very slowly, the\nplug gave way, eventually the surface rose slightly\nabove the warhead's surface. More cuts, and a finger\nhold. The plug rose a bit more. It seemed minutes\nbefore their hands could grasp it firmly.\n\nThey unscrewed the plug. It drifted away.\n\n\"When Ram had our skulls crammed with all that\nraw data I thought this was garbage we'd never\nhave to use,\" Brad said. \"I think a lot differently\nnow. Myra, hold the mags tight and be ready to\nbreak away as soon as I give you the word.\"\n\nLying on his side directly above the opening he\ninserted his arm and shoulder into the well as far\nas he could. Inside the cavity he located knobs\nand keypads by touch. At random, Brad twirled the\nknobs, pressed the keys, and opened and closed\nswitches. After a brief wait, he tore several wire\nconnections loose.\n\n\"Working in the dark like this has disadvantages,\"\nhe grunted.\n\nWithdrawing his arm he slipped his outer glove back\non. Hastily they climbed back aboard their fighter.\n\n\"Go! Myra. Go!\"\n\nBoth craft whirled away.\n\n\"The warhead's computer assessed and integrated\nmy random inputs,\" Brad said. \"The solution should\nchange its flight path or, for all we know, reset\nthe switches for the proximity fuses so that\nour ships' mass and proximity sets the bomb off.\nLet's get as far away as we can before it all comes\ntogether and whatever's going to happen happens.\"\n\nThe two fighters headed toward the UIPS fleet.\nBarely beyond the fatal radiation zone the now\ndistant warhead detonated. The fireball looked\nas huge as the Sun from Venus.\n\nBrad opened the communications channel.\n\n\"Sentinel One to UIPS Fleet Comm Center. We're\napproaching in two Plutonian fighters from the\ndirection of the blast. Be ready to receive; we're\ncoming in. Acknowledge.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter FORTY-FOUR\n\n\nThe opposing fleets maneuvered warily. It was\ntoo late for either side to safely fire long-range\nthermonuclear warheads. The battlefield would\nbe a tight arena.\n\nBrad and Hodak matched up to Admiral Selvin's\nflagship Ruthless. Without altering formation the\nRuthless extended a mag-beam and drew the fighters\nquickly to the flight deck one following the other.\n\nWasting no time on boarding formalities, Brad\nmotioned his colleagues to follow as an escort led\nthem at a run to the command deck. Selvin was\nwaiting impatiently. A debriefing officer took\nHodak in tow, and an another escorted Drummer\nto the VIP lounge.\n\nAt a sign from Brad, Myra trailed after him.\n\nThe fleet command center was fifteen meters across\nand ten deep. View tanks, consoles and displays\nalong the bulkheads glowed and portrayed the\nmultidimensional battle zone, updates on readiness\nof the fleet and whatever had been considered\nrelevant in defeating the enemy. Specialists and\nback-up technicians studied displays, recapped real\ntime data, checked results and sent them on in an\nongoing process. The place hummed with muted voices\nand the almost silent clicks of an organized combat\nops center.\n\nSelvin waved Brad to join him at a plotting table.\nA globe-shaped view tank, suspended close overhead\ndisplayed the three-dimensional battle zone. The\ncommand center's communicator hovered close\nto Selvin, his head encased in a helmet linked\nto all ships in the UIPS fleet, fleet headquarters\non Earth, and the conference site. A hard-copy\ndispatch remote on a shoulder harness extended\nforward waist-high.\n\nSelvin hastily exchanged handshakes with Brad\nand Myra. Brad talked fast pointing to the capsule\nMyra held in her hand. Listening, Selvin's Executive\nsignaled the communicator to open the secure link\nto Commanders on all ships in the fleet. A nod from\nthe grizzled Fleet Commander and Myra inserted\nthe capsule into a slot on the view tank's base.\nThe Exec motioned the battle staff to observe\nand listen. Taking turns, Brad and Myra reeled off\ndetails on the enemy fleet's new Order of Battle.\n\nBrad pointed to locations in the view tank,\nsuggesting potential UIPS tactical options to\nexploit the enemy's vulnerabilities. He added how\nCaptain Yargoul might respond, and how the UIPS\nfleet might use them to advantage.\n\nAs Brad spoke, a microphone picked up his words\nand fed them into the computer to bring current\nthe fleet's, now by-passed database. Selvin and his\nstaff, even as they listened to Brad, observed the\neffects on the plotting screen. A superseding fleet\ntactical formation spread before them.\n\nThere was no time for discussion; the opposing\nfleets were too close. Selvin, eyes on the tank and\nplot, took over and spun out orders to his ships'\nCommanders.\n\n\"Your view tank has a copy of what I have\nhere,\" he said. \"The enemy fleet is down to\nfour battle cruisers, sixteen destroyers, three\nfighter-bombers, seventeen fighters, four gunboats,\nand three attack transports with troops aboard,\nplus a tagalong pack of armed support ships.\n\n\"Consider the destroyers are in their best\nscreening positions. We are totally committed.\nLaunch fighters as soon as the INOR fleet is in\noptimum range. Target priorities are cruisers,\ndestroyers and gunships. Take the offense\nimmediately against all enemy ships that\npenetrate our outer defenses.\n\n\"Avoid contact with transports or support ships.\nIf an enemy vessel is disabled, engage in rescue\nif your situation permits; especially should they\nretire from the arena and present no hazard to the\nSlingshot construction site. In such circumstances,\ndo not pursue. If they do begin to approach the\nTerminals, pursue at max and take them out. Keep\nthe construction site command center informed\nso that they can take defensive actions.\n\n\"Engage the enemy. Attack. Attack. Attack.\"\n\n ##\n\nThe INOR Commanders facing Captain Yargoul on his\nview screen appeared apprehensive. They had not\nclosed with the enemy fleet yet lost two cruisers,\nthree destroyers and a dozen fighters. The\nthermonuclear warhead launched at the enemy\nfleet had been faulty or sabotaged into premature\ndetonation. They had taken savage blows.\n\nCaptain Yargoul rallied his forces.\n\n\"The battle has just begun,\" he exhorted his\nlisteners. \"Our surveillance of the enemy fleet\nshows we are in a strong position. Form up for\npenetrating the enemy fleet. Destroyers tighten\nscreens. As soon as the enemy gets within range\nlaunch fighter-bombers and fighters. Gunships and\nattack patrollers take the point. Attack. Now.\"\n\nOptimum range was closing for particle beamers.\nFighter-bombers, gunships and patroller-fighters\nfrom each side sped and dodged toward firing points.\n\nA Jovian fighter-bomber plunged through a gap in\nthe UIPS shield and came at the bridge of the UIPS\ncruiser Implacable. Arrayed to fire for effect the\nImplacable cut loose with successive volleys of\nits forward laser-quads. From a turret above the\ncruiser's upper structures a molecular disrupter\nflashed a cascade of energy that coalesced\ninto twisting, jagged bolts. The fighter-bomber\ndissolved as its guns fired a short burst.\nFragments caroomed off its target's hull.\n\nTwo thousands kilometers distant, a Titanian\ngunboat evaded the UIPS defensive screen and\nslashed in at Selvin's Ruthless. The flagship's\nguns set up a withering fire, but couldn't match\nthe lightning speed of the closing gunboat. A\nraking laser-doubles knifed through the Ruthless\namidships, opening ten meters of hull. The vacuum\nof space sucked at storage bays, shops and\nwardrooms; dozens of bodies floated through the\nrupture. The gunboat, caught in a crossfire of\nlaser-quads, exploded silently.\n\nThe Ruthless' internal safety doors had slammed\nshut immediately, isolating the damaged bays and\ncompartments.\n\nSuddenly, the main bodies of the two fleets were\nwithin range of each other's heavy weapons. A\ntangled circus of cruisers, destroyers, gunships\nand fighters careened through space, sweeping\nthe battle arena with their guns. Battle craft, from\nboth sides, blossomed into clouds of wreckage,\nshards and debris in the first minutes of combat.\n\nMore heavily armed, the INOR forces were\nnevertheless at a disadvantage. The fleet had not\ncompletely recovered from the disruptive effects of\nthe haphazard redeployment that Adari had contrived.\nDrummer and Brad had deserted them; Hyk and the\nDragon were gone. The INOR forces lacked cohesion.\nCaptain Yargoul had barely assumed command of the\ncombined fleet and needed to assess the situation.\nThere was no time for that. They were face to face\nwith a powerful adversary who had appeared without\nwarning. An easy victory had become a struggle for\nsurvival.\n\nTwo UIPS destroyers made a run at the Jovian\ncruiser Boulder. Four explosive-decompressors cut\nloose simultaneously at the cruiser, striking her\namidships. A succession of explosions wracked\nthe ship, hurling debris and bodies in all directions.\nThe ship rolled and yawed wildly out of control.\nThe UIPS destroyers cut away.\n\nThe Ruthless' damage assessments flashed to the\nbridge and the ship's Commander informed the fleet\ncommand deck.\n\n\"We've still got full power and most of our guns\nare operative,\" Selvin announced to his staff after\na brief study of the report. \"With another of their\ncruisers gone the big ships have evened out, but\nthey've still got the edge in destroyers. We've...\"\n\n\"Fighter-bomber locked on to enemy cruiser\nEncounter.\" The communicator's voice cut in over\nthe loudspeaker.\n\n\"Put him on,\" Selvin ordered.\n\nThe pilot's voice filled the room, low and tense.\n\n\"...3000 kay starboard. Destroyer screen at 2000,\nkinda loose. Going in. Have incoming, lots of it.\nIn evasive. I'm hit, but I'm through. 700. More\nincoming. Bridge in sights. Three seconds burst --\na hit. I'm out of control. Encounter dead ahead...\ngonna...\"\n\nSilence.\n\nSelvin turned away to hide the pain in his eyes\nat still another death.\n\n\"Cruisers three to two, in our favor.\" An officer\ncalled out from his position at the battle monitor.\n\"New ball game.\"\n\nBrad pointed, drawing Selvin's eyes to the\nconstantly changing plotting table and view tank.\n\nThe displays showed the struggle had become a\nseries of separate skirmishes spread across a\nmillion kay in all directions. Fighter-bombers and\nfighters without a mother ship, and destroyers\nthat had lost their cruisers ranged the battlefield\nsingly and in pairs, searching out and attacking\nthe enemy.\n\nNot visible to the naked eye through the swarm of\nspace debris around them, the view tank's sensors\ndiscriminated against displaying the lacework\nof crossing beams from laser-quads, explosive\ndecompressors, molecular disrupters, and here\nand there, a cruiser's particle beamer.\n\nAdmiral Selvin stared at the tank.\n\n\"Does he realize what he's doing?\" He whispered.\n\nThe Jovian heavy cruiser Windstorm and its\nscreen of destroyers had changed direction about\ntwenty-five thousand kay distant and headed\nstraight at the UIPS fleet; the Jovian light\ncruiser Assault and its escorts lined up behind.\nThe UIPS cruisers Ruthless, Avenger and Implacable\nwere broadside to the oncoming enemy line. Most of\nthe gun ports for the Windstorm's and the Assault's\nmost powerful long range weapons were along\ntheir broadsides and out of position for returning\nfire at the UIPS battle fleet. Jovian vessels of all\ntypes that came within range of UIPS weapons would\nbe overwhelmed by UIPS concentrated broadsides.\nThe Windstorm's escorts would not have the range\nuntil the two fleets were closer.\n\n\"They've inadvertently maneuvered themselves\ninto an ancient sea battle formation,\" Selvin said.\n\"It was once known as 'crossing the T'. They intended\nto cut straight through our defenses to optimize\ntheir broadsides but instead they opened themselves\nto ours. That's how the game is played. I have no\nchoice, but I have to act quickly.\"\n\nSelvin's battle computer counted down the enemy's\ndistance and flashed estimates on when the enemy\nline would be optimally exposed to particle beam\nvolleys.\n\n\"Cruisers: ready your particle beamers,\" Selvin\ncommanded, \"sustained fire as soon as you have\nthe range.\"\n\nMoments after he spoke, the Admiral's order\ntransformed into action. Abruptly, the gun circuits\nsnapped shut. Lights dimmed and the Ruthless\nthrobbed as the beamers sucked up massive amounts\nof energy. The Avenger and the Implacable joined in.\n\nIndicators swung wildly. The technicians watched\nthe dials and verified that a stream of highly\ncharged, invisible particles had erupted from the\nbeamer tubes. The lights returned to normal, and\nthe throbbing tapered off.\n\nThe bolts struck the leading INOR warship full\nlength from bow to stern, and moved on the second\nin line as soon as it came into range. The INOR\nbattle cruisers shuddered, smitten as by a\ngiant hammer. Their hulls collapsed and the\nships exploded into enormous, silent fireballs.\nDestroyers and support ships in close screens\nwere caught in the blasts and shattered.\n\nThe INOR fleet's will to continue the battle was\ngone; they had disintegrated as a fighting force.\n\nThe battle ground to a halt. What was left of the\nINOR armada withdrew beyond the reach of the UIPS\nfleet's long-range weapons, careful to demonstrate\nthat their retreat was in a direction away from\nthe Slingshot Terminals. It was just as well, lines\nof UIPS destroyers and gunships had formed up as\na shield between the work sites and any potential\nattacker from the residue of the INOR Combined\nFleet.\n\nThe arena quieted. UIPS search, rescue and medical\ncraft searched the area, marking wrecks of both\nsides with electronic signals, collecting the dead\nand treating the wounded.\n\nCommunications lines opened between the fleets.\nAdmiral Selvin requested the INOR commanders to\norder a stand down from all weapons. All Plutonian\nAssault Force vessels were ordered to form up and\nprepare for boarders.\n\nBrad and Selvin stood in a corner of the command\ndeck, heads close. Brad drew an object from\na pocket as he spoke: the control for the\ncommunications barrier Zolan had erected.\nSelvin, hand to chin, stared at the device,\nlistening. He pointed to it, and then in the\ndirection of the companionway.\n\n\"Notify Camari,\" he said. \"Now.\"\n\nBrad nodded and raced away.\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter FORTY-FIVE\n\n\nCamari's impassive gaze roamed the faces of the\nSolar System's leaders at the conference table. The\ndiscussions had quickly degenerated into an open\nclash of wills between Camari and Narval. The other\nINOR Chiefs of State sat back to enjoy the contest,\nposing occasional questions to Camari or Narval,\nor to both. All knew they were in a waiting game.\n\nCamari went along, drawing Narval out. Each was\neager for a message from the Planet Pluto Special\nZone that would present a new reality and the\ndefining course for the conference.\n\nNarval realized that he was being goaded by his\nINOR allies to exacerbate the confrontation between\nthe Regions. Noting the time, he decided to drop\nthe first bombshell.\n\n\"We have been called together to prepare a course\nfor the future,\" he rumbled, looking about with\nscorn. \"Yet we of INOR sit here and quibble among\nourselves, lacking a unified will to confront the\nUIPS directly and compel them to respect our\ndemands. The circumstances of the times call for\nthe raw strength of an iron fist, not for a press\nof beggars with outstretched, pleading palms.\"\n\n\"I take exception,\" President Straber of Titan\nleaned forward and waggled his finger at Narval.\n\"We are a confederation of nation-states. Are you\nsuggesting that we abdicate our sovereignty to a\nsingle authority? If we were to do that we face the\nsame chaos that preceded the separation of the\nRegions. We of Titan would find that intolerable.\"\n\nNarval seized the moment to pave the way for\nthe supreme power he felt would soon be his.\nThe message from Drummer would surely come\nwithin minutes.\n\n\"The old United Planetary System from which we\nbroke away,\" he countered, \"was based on so-called\ndemocratic principles and due process. The United\nPlanetary System fell apart. The fragmented,\ninternational order that replaced it, this\ngrotesque arrangement of nation-states, is equally\nineffective and therefore obsolete. Our system\nof authority and governance must be raised above\nthe antiquated, interminable rules of the desperate\nbickering we now witness here at play among us.\nI will personally impose such changes.\"\n\n\"Through tyranny?\" Camari's words were dry as the\ndesert winds of Mars.\n\nNarval's eyes narrowed to slits of hatred as he glared\nat Camari. Damn, where was Drummer's message?\n\nCamari continued in the same tone, confronting\nNarval directly, \"I voice the profound hopes of the\npeoples of our diverse cultures, and yet, of our\ncommon species, that your threat is nothing but\nidle chatter.\"\n\nHe turned his head to right and left, taking in the\nothers at the table.\n\n\"What say you, leaders of INOR, to this threat from\na criminal let loose among us from Callisto? Will\nyou yield to Narval your constitutional rights and\nauthority so that he personally assumes the power\nto dictate to your nation and to your people?\n\n\"I, for one, reject his proposal with contempt and\ndeclare, here and now, that the UIPS will fight to\nthe death any attempt by Narval to impose his will\non the United Inner Planetary System or, for that\nmatter, on any nation in the Solar System.\"\n\nAround the table, and in the seats beyond, a\nshocked silence fell. They were indeed cynical and\nself-seeking politicians, and devious ploys were\ntheir stock in trade for getting and holding power.\nNarval's past was well known to them all. His words\nwere a direct challenge to their positions, their\nregimes, and their lives. Faces clouded, they\nappeared overcome by the realization that Narval's\ncapture of the Terminals was merely one part of a\nfar greater conspiracy to destroy their sovereignty.\n\nAdvisors leaned forward to whisper to their\nMasters. Suspicious glances were cast at Narval\nwho responded with a look of mocking amusement.\n\n\"This is all without significance,\" he thought, \"by\nnow INOR military forces are committed to me.\"\n\nCamari sat quietly, letting it all happen. The dice\nhad been cast elsewhere.\n\n ##\n\nRam entered and strode swiftly around the\nconference table toward Camari. Something in the\nway Ram's elongated frame stooped and flexed\nas he walked created an impression of suppressed\nexcitement. Camari tensed with apprehension. Ram\ncaught Camari's eye as the UIPS leader leaned back\nin his chair.\n\nRam bent and whispered into Camari's ear. His\nurgent manner and Camari's close attention stirred\nthe conferees. Several at the table and in the\nseats beyond glanced at each other, eyebrows\nraised; others eyed Narval. This was to have been\nhis show.\n\nNarval sat motionless, eyes hooded, his normally\nruddy face visibly graying.\n\nCamari held up his hand for attention. It was an\nunnecessary gesture; all eyes had been on him and\nRam from the moment Ram entered.\n\n\"I understand an unusual spunnel communication has\narrived from the Planet Pluto Special Zone.\" Camari\nannounced. \"It is addressed to all Heads of State\nattending this convocation. The message calls for\nan audio-visual presentation in the view tank. Any\nobjections?\"\n\nWithout waiting for a response, he nodded over his\nshoulder. Ram murmured into the tiny transmitter\nin his hand.\n\nThe view tank, centered above the conference\ntable, lost its soft neutral glow, blinked, and the\nPlanet Pluto sector appeared. The tank displayed\nthe debris of a space battle: ruptured ships,\nunrecognizable masses and fragments, and bloated\nhuman bodies. In the background were the Slingshot\nTerminals, intact.\n\nFrom around the table came sounds of breath\ndrawn sharply, gasps and muttered curses.\n\nThe view narrowed and zoomed in on a broad sheet\nof drifting metal. It bore the emblem of the Jovian\nCombined Strike Team. Large letters emblazoned\nabove the emblem spelled out the partial word\n\"Windst...\"\n\nAll eyes in the room were spellbound, fixed on the\ntank. All, except for President Pazzim of Callisto.\nAt the sight of a drifting scrap that had once been\nthe pride of his fleet, he groaned loudly, hunched\nhis shoulders and lowered his head. He did not look\nup again.\n\nThe hull of a battle cruiser formed along the\ntank's outer edge and tumbled slowly end over end\ntoward center. Bow collapsed, the ship drifted into\nand out of view. Experts from the back seats leaned\nforward and whispered. The lifeless hulk had been\nthe Plutonian Battle Cruiser Dragon.\n\nCamari shifted his eyes to Narval, half up from\nhis seat, face putty-white, lips quivering, eyes\ntransfixed on the view tank. Tearing his eyes\naway, he pointed at Camari and screeched.\n\n\"It's a trap.\" His voice trembled in panic and\nbecame a wail. \"This is another stratagem\nconcocted by Camari to frighten us.\"\n\nHe gestured wildly and his mouth dribbled. \"I know\nyour ways, Camari. You're trying to divide and pit\nus against each other so that you can move in and\ntake over. It won't work. Since you cannot shake\nour unity and resolve with empty appeals for\nSlingshot, you now invent battles that never took\nplace. They just couldn't have happened. We're\non to you. You're a fraud and a cheat. I move this\nconvocation be terminated immediately. I, for one,\nhave no intention to remain and be subjected to\nfurther lies.\"\n\nEven as Narval squealed and pounded the table, the\nscene in the tank faded into a broader view of a\nphalanx of disabled warships, several bow-to-stern,\nand others in a disorganized cluster. Again, the\nsecure Terminals were the backdrop.\n\nThe scene cut to the command deck of a warship.\nA face, contorted in anger and despair, appeared\nand addressed them.\n\n\"I am Captain Klars Abou, Commander of the\nSaturnian Combined Strike Team, now acting\nas Commander of the INOR Combined Fleet, or\nwhat's left of it. I make this statement of my own\nfree will. The original mission given to me by my\nPresident was to join with other military forces\nof INOR to take and hold the Slingshot Terminals\nhostage as insurance for an outcome in negotiations\nthat would be favorable to INOR.\n\n\"The mission to take the Terminals has failed. We\nwere attacked and defeated by the military forces\nof the United Inner Planetary System. We were\nbetrayed by the Plutonians. The Commander of\nthe UIPS Military Space Force has ordered all our\nwarships, except those of Planet Pluto, to return\nto their home stations. The INOR military forces,\nat the outset, had neither strategic nor tactical\nplans for the confrontation that we have\nexperienced. Our forces are in utter disarray; we\nhave no choice but to comply with the orders of the\nUIPS Fleet Commander. I have therefore directed\nthe dissolution of the INOR Combined Fleet and\nordered the vessels to return home. The UIPS fleet\ncommander has granted us leave to use the spunnel\nsystem for this purpose.\"\n\nCaptain Abou's features faded. An ominous quiet\ndescended on the conference room. Narval, stricken\nand silent, remained half-standing, looking from\nthe tank to Camari, and at the faces of his\nco-conspirators. Camari returned Narval's gape\nimpassively.\n\nThere was more. Drummer's features replaced\nthose of Captain Abou. His features were stern\nand his head shook slightly with tension and anger.\nHowever, his voice was grave and measured in tone,\ndeep and vibrant.\n\n\"Leaders of Solar Governments. To those who do\nnot recognize me, I am Deke Drummer, formerly\nan advisor to Reen Narval and, also formerly the\nCommander of the INOR Combined Fleet. I confirm\nCaptain Abou's words. The mission against Slingshot\nfailed. The reasons are many, but failure is the\nfact. You now have the task, at your convocation,\nto seek solutions to our common problems through\nother means.\n\n\"All military forces and government administrators\nof Planet Pluto are under my command. I proclaim\nthe Government of Reen Narval is fallen. I have\nestablished myself as Regent over Planet Pluto\nuntil a lawful President is chosen by the will of\nour people. I hereby declare Reen Narval persona\nnon grata on Planet Pluto, and have instructed my\nwarships to attack and destroy his vessel should\nhe enter Plutonian jurisdiction. I remind you all that\nNarval came to Planet Pluto as a criminal outcast\nfrom Callisto. I suggest to the President of\nCallisto that he take custody of Narval and deal\nwith him on the basis of the crimes he committed\nwithin Callistonian jurisdictions.\n\n\"To President Camari, I herewith declare that\nthe original understandings on cooperation and\ncollaboration with the Government of Planet\nPluto until Slingshot is launched remain in\neffect. Planet Pluto is an independent nation,\nnevertheless, I request that, in this singular\nsituation, that you personally represent our\ninterests at the Conference. I look forward to an\nearly exchange of Ambassadors and consultations\nto review our mutual interests and objectives.\nI have in mind three people whom I hope you will\nconsider for high position in your representation\nto my Government. I shall communicate with you\nseparately on that matter.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Chapter FORTY-SIX\n\n\n SOLAR LEADERS REACH ACCORD\n TRANS-SOLAR NEWS SERVICE\n FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n FLASH: SYSTEM-WIDE\n Filed at Solar Conference Site\n\nThe meeting of the Solar System's Heads of State\nis a success. President Camari of the UIPS opened\nthe proceedings with a brief speech. Ignoring past\ndifferences, he emphasized common interests,\ninterdependence of peoples and nations, and\nbenefits through collective efforts to meet the\nneeds of the dispersed communities of humankind.\n\n\"The singular authority of the old United Planetary\nSystem,\" Camari said, \"had no need for means\nto resolve issues among separate nation-states.\nThat is no longer true. We must provide for\ninterregional and international deliberations and\ndecision-making. Furthermore, our diminished\nreserves of metals, minerals and other essential\nsubstances, on the one hand, and the benefits of\nan operational Slingshot, on the other, creates new\nchallenges of common concern and more options in\nthe search for solutions. Unless we accelerate our\ncollaboration to resolve the resources crisis our\ncivilizations may well erupt once more toward\npotential disasters such as the one we are here\ntrying to escape.\"\n\nFollowing President Camari's opening remarks, the\nconference was addressed by INOR Chiefs of State.\nEach expressed the aspirations of his or her people\nand their capabilities toward attainment. All agreed\nthat their meeting was timely, that the problems\nwere mutual, and that the agenda be addressed\nwithout delay.\n\nThe exchanges were intense as the conferees sought\na balance between inalienable rights and solemn\nobligations. Many issues were extremely complex:\nWhat are an inhabited planet's or satellite's\njurisdictional limits within territorial and\ncontiguous space? What are the rights and\nobligations of one Region's military and commercial\nvessels and citizens when inside the lawful\nboundaries of another? What is the definition\nof \"innocent passage\" in the context of a\nmulti-national Solar Community? How are our\ndynamic and constantly changing interplanetary\nand interregional space lanes to be maintained? Who\nwill pay for such services? Questions posed in one\ncontext were injected into others or phrased to\nhighlight a wide range of diverse interests and\nnuances.\n\nDiscussions among the primary conferees were, at\ntimes, suspended for caucuses of Heads of States\norbiting a central planet with their advisors. Ad\nhoc committees were set up to explore options\nin depth, or at minimum, to provide clarity and\ncontext to the issue. The meeting rooms along\nthe periphery of the assembly hall filled with\nspecialists who argued loudly, in whispers, and at\nlength.\n\nOften, additional data was needed from Seats of\nGovernment. The spunnel communications channels\nwere loaded with traffic, and archives throughout\nthe system opened, many for the first time in\nmillennia. The Conference Disk's computers absorbed\nfacts and expert opinions and spewed distillations\nof new conclusions.\n\nSlowly, positions clarified and consensus took form.\n\nA draft Declaration of Principles emerged from\nthe back rooms. It dealt with only a few of many\nproblems that needed immediate attention, leaving\na broad array of issues open for further review.\n\nAfter hours of debate the Draft Declaration of\nPrinciples was approved by the Leaders of the Solar\nCommunity. (See Appendix.)\n\nAll agreed that the First UIPS-INOR Conference\naugured well for the future of humankind.\n\n\n\n\n\n Epilogue\n\n\nThe networks of mass attractors that tethered\nthe Extractor to Planet Pluto disengaged nine\nEarth centuries after construction began. Pluto\ncontributed its orbital momentum to the launch.\nIn time the integrated drives of the most advanced\npropulsion thrusters took on the full load, and the\ndream of humankind was on its way to the Alpha\nCentauri star system, on schedule.\n\nScientists and technicians on The Solar System's\nSlingshot Control Center maintained constant\nreal-time oversight of the Extractor's subsystems\nand structures through spunnel monitors. A\nconvoy of robot deflectors and screens cleared\nthe Extractor fleet's path of meteoroids, sand and\nrock swarms and space debris. Hundreds of logistics\nrobots crammed the station's cavernous bays,\nself-sustaining and programmed to activate\nsub-systems on schedule, deploy robotic specialists\nand service the machine during its voyage, and in\nperpetuity thereafter.\n\nMaximum acceleration for almost two Earth decades\nincreased the fleet's velocity to five percent\nspeed-of-light, which it maintained for more than\na Solar System Standard Century. Deceleration and\nvector adjustments took another three decades.\nAlignment to major concentrations of potential\nsources, selection of a 'first phase' work site,\ncalibration of instrumentation and activating its\nspunnel channels and monitors required still more.\n\nBack along the Solar rim, the Collector remained\nlinked to Planet Pluto for two decades following\nthe Extractor's departure. Its schedule along\nPluto's orbit provided sufficient time for the\nCollector's transit to its permanent station\nalong the rim, to track the Extractor's position\nvia spunnel to refine details for integrated\noperations, and for positioning and calibrating the\nthousands of networks that coordinate the solar\nand interstellar arrays.\n\nThe citizens of the Solar community tuned in to\nwitness the release of the Interstellar Spunnel\nSignal from the hand of the President of the newly\nformed United Nations of the Solar System. It would\nbe the final signal to synchronize and activate the\ncollective controls of the Extractor and Collector.\n\nThe President keyed the Signal.\n\n ##\n\nRemote spunnel nodes and boosters along the route\nfrom the Solar System to Alpha Centauri monitored\nthe Signal and the response. Rings of laser arrays\nalong the edge of the Extractor's hopper flashed\nalive and focused their beams on a large, slowly\ntumbling planetoid hundreds of kilometers across\nits minor dimension.\n\nSensors, analyzers, siphons and beam-guides\nparalleled the lasers' signals along an\nincandescent column of plasma from the dissolving\nplanetoid into the Extractor's processes and, when\nready, into the hopper. The truncated apex of the\nExtractor's teleport gate cone glowed red, then\nviolet, and thirty meters of its length disappeared\ninto its new hyperspace home.\n\nThe invisible nozzle hurled a concentration of\nelemental substance across hyperspace to its\nsister station four and a half light-years distant.\n\nThe first sign of incoming was a churning,\nexpanding mass of violet bubbles around the apex\nof the Collector. Shifting colors as it cooled and\nsolidified, the mass transformed into a huge brown\nglobe. The globe separated from the nozzle and\ndrifted off, replaced by another mushrooming\nbubbling mass at the nozzle's tip.\n\nA fleet of robot tugs clamped mag-beams on the\nfree-floating globes and hauled them off. Another\nfleet of giant space tugs moved into position for\nthe next gift of crude but treasured substance\nteleported across interstellar space from a\ndistant star.\n\nThe cornucopia was in flow and humankind's first\noutbound and inbound highways to the greater\nuniverse were complete and working.\n\n\n\n\n\n Afterwords\n\n\nAn overview of the times prepared by Level 2\nstudents, Luna Middle School, based on records\nand commentaries in the official archives of\nThe Interstellar Mining and Teleport System.\n(Reference: Index, Capsule V67 The Interstellar\nHistorian, Third Millennium, Interstellar Era.)\n\nIn the centuries that followed humankind's giant\nleap to Luna, scientists, engineers and scholars in\nalmost all of Planet Earth's disciplines probed ever\ndeeper into space. Explorers studied and charted the\nsurfaces, depths and atmospheres of each of the\nSolar System's bodies, and scrutinized the dynamics\nand constituents of space matter out to the Kuiper\nBelt and Oort Cloud. They ventured into the void\nbeyond Pluto's aphelion for hundreds of millions\nof kilometers -- although not yet the stars.\n\nThe first landing on Luna in Year 1969 of the then\nCommon Era was judged to be among humankind's\ngrandest achievements. At the Luna landing's\nTercentenary a universal calendar was ordained to\ncommemorate the Event as New Year's Day, Year 0,\nformally beginning humankind's Interplanetary Era.\n\nBy then, populated Moon and Mars bases were well\nestablished. Construction cadres had ventured\ninto and beyond the Asteroids. Their experiences,\nsurface and strata tests and studies influenced\nthe selection of sites for mining operations and\nstrategic outposts along the space frontiers.\nAdvance construction battalions built basic habitat\nand, having attained 'shirt sleeve' environments,\nconceptualized, planned, gathered local materials,\nand designed and built infrastructure and\nindustries that, in time, blossomed into enormous\nencapsulated cities, social orders, cultural\nadjustments and civilizations.\n\nExplorers became teachers and mentors. Initially\nin Earth orbit, later in lunar space and on Luna\nitself, they guided settlers in developing new\nlifestyles and colonizing skills, and showed them\nhow to wrest and refine usable elements and\nminerals from nearby sources. They devised and\ntested methodologies to convert crude space\nmatter into forms with which to create and\nintegrate structures, and manufacture and operate\nmachines and networks that would sustain surface\nand contiguous space and inter-satellite and\ninterplanetary navigation and logistics systems.\n\nThe emigrants procreated and populated their\ncities in the void. Their disparate ancestries blended\nthrough a natural vitality that accelerated human\nevolution so as to survive in a radically new\nenvironment. In so doing, they turned away from\ntraditional conventions still deeply ingrained in\ntheir common species. Adjusting over time to the\nnovel experience of space, they conceived new ways\nor adapted their ancient qualities and prospered\nin wholly enclosed artificial worlds. Organ\nmodifications, genetic engineering and cloning\ngave impetus to human transformation.\n\nInstinctively, humankind-in-space prepared for an\neventual voyage to the stars.\n\nAt the close of the first interplanetary millennium\nthat shaped and launched The Great Migration to\nSpace the original emigrants' progeny had become\nan indigenous population. Five centuries into the\nInterplanetary Era's second millennium the Solar\nSystem included more than five hundred populated\ncolonies and outposts, and twice that number\nof robot stations for interplanetary and\ninter-satellite navigation, communication relay,\nand space rescue. Populated by humans and their\nrobots, colonies extended from the voids above\nMercury and Venus through the Asteroids, the\nsatellites of the gas planets, to Planet Pluto.\n\nAs colonies multiplied and spread across the\nvast interplanetary realm the solar community\nbecame impatient with time consumed in normal\npoint-to-point space communications and transport.\nThe excessive transmission and portage time was\nespecially irritating in communications, shipment\nof priority cargo, and human travel across\ndistances from bodies orbiting along on opposite\nsides of the Sun. Hyperspace technology solved\nthe problem.\n\n\"Spunnels\" in the public's jargon, came into being,\nthe term compressed from the phrase \"hyperspace\ntunnels,\" a universal phenomenon once suspected\nand eventually confirmed. In the centuries preceding\nThe Great Migration the phenomenon had been\ngenerally referred to as a wormhole, an archaic and\nirrelevant expression, even in those ancient times.\n\nSpunnel networks reduced transmission time between\nthe most widely separated points in the system from\nhours to real-time. Successful in communications,\nscientists and engineers concentrated on the\ntechnological leap from spunnel communications\nto spunnel teleportation, a capability urgently and\nclearly essential to move humans, machines, and\nraw materials across interplanetary distances.\n\nThe flood of emigrants to space colonies and\noutposts exceeded tens of thousands each\nyear over several centuries, leaving behind a\nstill over-crowded Earth that had long since\ncried 'enough'. Among the migrants were artisans\nand technicians, minimally to highly-skilled\nadministrators, sociologists, teachers, scientists\nand engineers and, scattered among them,\ncontemporary philosophers who preached the\nmetaphysical. Together, they represented all\nof Earth's peoples and a cross-section of their\ncultures.\n\nTechnology, however, imposed constraints. The\ninsatiable appetite for metals, minerals, rare\nearths and other nonrenewable substances increased\ninexorably. They remained the foundation for the\nSolar System's industries, driven by the constant\nclamor of indulgent lifestyles. Fully aware that\nvital minerals and other substances were beyond\nreplenishment from within the Solar System, the\nsolar community nevertheless squandered its\nrapidly diminishing resources.\n\nIn time, reserves of nonrenewable resources\ndropped from residue to gleanings. Recycling, salvage,\never-deeper mine shafts and tunnels, repeated\nsweeps of the Earth's sea beds and planetary\nand satellites' crusts, trenches, beds and craters\noffered insufficient returns. Scouring the Asteroid\nBelt, sifting the Kuiper-Oort regions, and intense\ncompetitions for substitutes provided inadequate\nand merely temporary relief. The solar community's\npopulation, on Earth and in space, had exploded to\nmore than fourteen billion people. The search for\nsubstances to support humankind's needs ranged\nthroughout; there were no more sources, nor were\nthere sanctuaries.\n\nCertainly, there would not be enough for voyages\nto the stars.\n\n ##\n\nAt long last, humankind confronted its reality. Net\nyields from nonrenewable reserves, residues and\nsubstitutes had dwindled until exhaustion was\ncertain and a timeline predictable. The choice\namong grim options could no longer be postponed.\nIn the end, there were two:\n\n-- Remain in place, ration, recycle and\nredistribute minerals, metals, ores and other\nusable substances and substitutes with Draconian\ndiscipline, and take the consequences, or\n\n-- Chance the most awesome venture in humankind's\nlong history: reach out to a distant star and tear\nfrom it the raw matter that would preserve and\nperpetuate the grandeur of the human experience.\n\nThe second option would be the ultimate gamble:\nwinning would bring the cornucopia sought\nthroughout the ages. Failure, even at an early\nstage, would dissipate what little reserves\nremained. Vitality drained, humankind would slip\nback into the pits and the mud from which it had\nso laboriously climbed.\n\nThe decision was to reach for the stars.\n\n ##\n\n The Interstellar Mining and Teleport Program\n\nThe Objective: To draw from Alpha Centauri, the\nnearest star system, 4.35 light-years distant, its\nminerals, metals, elements and whatever useful\nsubstances could be moved across space, and store\nthem nearby in the Solar System, accessible to all\nhumankind.\n\nThe Task: Increase the Solar System's spunnel\nrange, capability and capacity to teleport matter\nacross interstellar space in a continuous flow and\nin sufficient quantities to satisfy the purpose of\nthe Objective;\n\nConstruct and dispatch an advance fleet of drone\nscouts to the Alpha Centauri star system at\nthe earliest possible time to survey, analyze and\nreport via spunnel on the availability, locations\nand accessibility of resources specified generally\nin the Objective;\n\nConcurrently, design, construct and position an\ninterstellar spunnel portage system consisting\nof two terminals, each of which would include\nan integral, fully self-sufficient facility for\ncommand-and-control, self-service and repair,\nlogistical and other operations essential to its\nunique mission. Designate the terminal at 'star'\ndestination the Extractor and the terminal that\nremains on the solar rim, the Collector.\n\n-- The Extractor selects and draws usable\nnon-organics from the Alpha Centauri star\nsystem, and collects, converts and channels\nthe product into its teleport shipping facility for\npoint-to-point spunnel transfer to the Collector.\n\n-- The Collector receives the product, converts\nit to its original form, and classifies, identifies\nand ejects the substance for storage along the\nsolar rim or at a point Authority determines to\nbe more appropriate.\n\nConstruct the terminals four million kilometers\nbeyond Pluto. During construction, secure the\nterminals to each other and separately, to Pluto,\nemploying mass attractors and position stabilizers,\nas required.\n\nDisengage the Extractor from Pluto at launch\nemploying Pluto's outbound orbital momentum\nin a manner that the combined fleet retains its\nintegrity in perpetuity.\n\nDeploy the Extractor to Alpha Centauri and position\nit in orbit above a point commensurate with data\nprovided by the drone scouts. Maintain constant\nsurveillance and exercise control over operations\nand maintenance via spunnel analyses of the\nExtractor's functions, structures and equipment.\n\nPosition the Collector along the solar rim and\norient it consistent with the Extractor's position\nand operations in the Alpha Centauri system.\n\n\n Stages\n\nThe Extractor, in position at destination,\nanalyzes, selects and draws substance from\nproximate asteroids, comets, satellites,\nplanetoids, swarms, star surface and other\naccessible bodies and strata, reduces the substance\nto spunnel-teleportable constituents, loads the mass\ninto the spunnel facility and dispatches the product.\n\nThe Collector, positioned in the Solar System\noriented to the Extractor, receives and converts\nthe Extractor's transmissions, processes substance\ninto its original or a refined state, classifies\nand ejects the mass for positioning in the storage\nzone.\n\n\n Resources and Schedule\n\nThe Task requires six Earth centuries to design,\nconstruct, equip, test, deploy and activate. The\nmillennia of delay in initiating the Task imposes\ninescapable hardships on the Solar Community.\n\nAccordingly, when justified as essential to the\nObjective, solar governments divert work forces,\nsystems, and material resources from throughout\ntheir jurisdiction to the Task. The consequences\nof these diversions are expected to significantly\ncurtail construction, activities, lifestyles\nof Earth and space colony populations, the\ndistribution of the solar system's residual\nresources and, possibly, the independence of\ngovernments, organizations, and individuals\nthroughout the solar realm.\n\nCritical to the program's success is timing the\nExtractor's launch. Piggy-backed to Pluto during\nconstruction, the Extractor exploits the planet's\norbital momentum for launch. The window is\nprecise and short-lived along Pluto's outbound orbit;\nthere will be only one launch opportunity for the\nExtractor. Disengaged from Pluto, the Extractor\nfleet will accelerate along its course to optimum\nvelocity through integrated thrust of multiple\nthermonuclear burst-propulsion systems or other,\nmore advanced propulsion systems, that are or\nbecome available for the Task.\n\n ##\n\nThe Interplanetary Era's second millennium was\ntumultuous. The harsh austerity imposed by the\nincreased deficits in metals, minerals and other\nindustrial materials and their substitutes created\none set of problems; human cloning augmented with\ngenetic engineering and their societal and cultural\neffects, especially beyond the Asteroids, created\nothers. Human survival in scores of widely\nscattered and unaffiliated space colonies,\nloosely called \"tank towns,\" encouraged scientific\nand social experiments that altered traditional\ncultures as well as human physiological and\npsychological characteristics.\n\nCumulative genetic and accelerated evolutionary\nalterations to the human body along with the\neffects of unique, often hostile, environments\nplus sheer distance from the familiar transformed\nhumans-in-space into something else. The unifying\nforces that had survived the Great Migration\nwithered. In time, the once shared interests of\npeoples, and allegiances to a home planet, sundered.\n\nVaried and increased rates of change opened\ndoors to pretenders among a colony's populace.\nOpportunists promoted a multitude of causes,\nusually self-serving. Anticipating advantages to\nthemselves, they combined forces and became\ninfluential advocates for disengagement from\npolitical, cultural and judicial dominance by the\ntotally foreign open sky government of Earth,\nbillions of kilometers distant.\n\nDisengagement, the opportunists agitated, was\nlong overdue; Earth inhabitants would never really\nunderstand what life in deep space was about.\n\nThe crisis came in the middle centuries.\nBureaucrats representing the central government\non Earth were isolated from the affairs of the\ncolonies they administered. The indigenous populace\nignored their authority, their credentials were\nchallenged, and they were invited to return to\ntheir home planet -- with no options.\n\nThe central government on Earth, weakened by\nshortages and distracted by agitators at home\nand in space, was neither vigilant nor prepared.\n\nEarly in the second millennium of the\nInterplanetary Era, several colonies in the Outer\nRegion declared their independence of the original\nUnited Planetary System and of each other. Other\ncolonies and outposts joined and within a decade,\nall had proclaimed themselves as newly constituted\nnation-states. Each reserved exclusive rights to\nnegotiate with other nation-states of the Region.\nNew agreements were implemented on matters\nof common interest, such as credits, industry, a\njudicial system, trade and commerce, science and\ntechnology, space traffic control, education and\ncultural exchange, and creation and management\nof infrastructure and management of life-support\nresources within their territories and jurisdictions.\n\nThe Outer Region's proclamations panicked the\ncentral government.\n\nOn the one hand, Earth ethicists argued, were the\nrights of the inhabitants of the space colonies. As\nmembers of distant societies they had modified\ntheir bodies, their environment and their cultures,\ntherefore, they had a right to seek their own\ndestiny unfettered by well-intentioned, but\nobviously impotent laws that originated on Earth.\nThe advocates of this philosophy emphasized\nthe Outer Region's right to their own physical,\ntechnological and cultural development. As unique\ncivilizations, evolving at an unprecedented rapid\npace, they were already radically different from\nthe humankind that had remained on distant Earth.\n\nOn the other hand, claimed others, the system-wide\nscarcity of natural sources vital to the survival\nof the species was a shared crisis. The crisis\ncould be solved, if at all, only through the most\nconcerted application of humankind's intellectual\nand collective genius. In one context, they were\nindeed unique civilizations: robust, sophisticated\nand divergent, nevertheless, instinctively taking\nnourishment from a common fealty to humankind's\nultimate destiny among the stars. Humankind\nwould be far stronger and effective together,\nthey argued, than it would be, divided within a\ncommon species.\n\nThe debate raged across the System. The separatists\nwon.\n\nEarth's General Assembly acceded to the demands\nfor self-determination. The new status of the outer\nand inner regions was confirmed in The Treaties on\nthe Separation of Jurisdictions for the Planets and\nSatellites of the Inner Region and the Independent\nNations of the Outer Region.\n\nThe outer periphery of the Asteroid Belt became the\nboundary. The United Planetary System was dissolved\nand reconstituted as the United Inner Planetary\nSystem (UIPS). The natural and artificial colonies\nthat orbited the planets and satellites of the\nOuter Region, or the central sun, retained their\noriginal identities (Ganymede, Titan, Callisto,\netc.), and Pluto added \"Planet\" to its name to\ndistinguish itself from planetary satellites. The\nformer colonies beyond the Belt formed a loose\nfederation: Independent Nations of the Outer Region\n(INOR).\n\nThe United Inner Planetary System insisted that\nPlanet Pluto and its contiguous space remain within\nthe UIPS Slingshot Special Zone of Operations until\nthe Extractor and the Collector were both safely\naway from Pluto's jurisdiction, as judged by the\nUIPS. The Plutonian government refused. The other\nINOR nations, immersed in their own problems,\nwere indifferent. The issue was left to the UIPS\nand Planet Pluto to resolve.\n\nThe UIPS continued, without prior consultation with\nINOR and Planet Pluto, to construct and operate\nSlingshot logistics sites and facilities on Pluto's\nsurface, in contiguous space, and within and along\nthe Planet Pluto orbit. The UIPS, interpreting\ntraditions and treaties that had evolved from\nEarth's ancient Laws of the Seas and Space,\nexercised and defended free and unencumbered\ntravel and passage by its citizens and vessels in\ndeep space and throughout the INOR jurisdictions.\n\nThe UIPS took steps to ensure the security of\nSlingshot construction and logistics support sites\nand space-ways.\n\n ##\n\nThe Slingshot Advance Cadre arrived in the\nNeptune-Pluto orbit-crossing sectors toward the end\nof the Interplanetary Era, before the breakup of the\nold United Planetary System. Colonizing Pluto and\nconstructing space kits that would be transformed\ninto surface habitat and supply depots began\ncenturies earlier when Planet Pluto was barely past\naphelion but within economical range of deep space\ntransports. The cadre's vessels carried and towed\ncommunications gear, specialized construction rigs,\nplatforms and infrastructure kits which had been\nfabricated or assembled in the industrial tank\ntowns above Luna, Venus and Mars, and by\ncooperating governments of satellites in the\nouter region.\n\nThe Cadre's primary mission was to establish a\nbase of operations on Pluto. The program called\nfor the planet to support a colony of fifty thousand\nspecialists and construction workers -- and their\nfamilies -- for the assembly, construction and\ntesting phases, plus ten thousand transients and\ntemporary residents. The latter would comprise\n'rest and relaxation' visitors, liaison and special\nmissions staff from a nearby logistics depot and\nthe construction sites, and agricultural and food\nprocessing workers from Planet Pluto's moon\nCharon. Also expected were cargo handlers and ship's\npersonnel from transports entering and departing\nPluto from-and-to points throughout the system.\n\nAbout eighty percent of Pluto's permanent adult\npopulation would work on the two terminals.\nThe specialized professions for the initial phase\nranged from scientists and engineers to artisans,\nskilled and semi-skilled workers in all of the\ndisciplines and industrial skills required to\nconstruct and operate a complex station in space\nand service and maintain a permanent habitat and\npopulation on Pluto's surface.\n\nChildren would be born on Pluto, natural or cloned.\nThey, as well as the general population, would\nbe cared for and supported by a host of\nadministrative, health care, educational,\nrecreational, life support and community services.\n\nThe Cadre's mission was in phases. The first\ntask of the initial phase was to land on Pluto's\nsurface, seek out stable surfaces or create them\nby fusing subsurface strata to sufficient depth\nfor support of massive structures.\n\nGravity enhancement surface panels and their\nenergy sources would be installed wherever enclosed\ncommunities or special purpose structures were to\nbe constructed. A detachment of the Cadre would\nland on Charon, Planet Pluto's moonlet, and fuse\nand seal sections of the moonlet's surface and\nsubsurface same as on Pluto.\n\nOn the solidified, stabilized surfaces of Pluto and\nCharon the Cadre would erect a tank town dome. The\ndome would have a ten-kilometer radius on Planet\nPluto and a one-kilometer radius on Charon.\n\nConstruction would proceed concurrently on surface\nand subsurface utility and life support facilities\nessential to human habitation. When enclosed areas\nwere shirtsleeve ready for occupancy, the Cadre\nwould erect essential life support, residential and\nrecreational facilities. These would be followed by\ntechnical, communications and transport networks\nfor Slingshot scientists, industrial technicians,\nand staff, followed by enclosed living areas for\nthe remainder of the general populace that would\ntrain and do the work during the subsequent phases.\n\nThe tanktown on Planet Pluto would be named\nColdfield; its counterpart on Charon would be\nLamplight.\n\nAn On-site Project Management Team (OPMT) directed\nthe Advance Cadre. The OPMT formed the nucleus of\nupper level managers, scientists and engineers, and\nother experts charged with organizing and guiding\nthe functional task groups. The functional staffs\nwould bring into being the on-site technical and\nadministrative support facilities, install and\noperate its equipment, and govern the communities\nwithin which the populace worked and resided.\n\nThe OPMT was organized into three groups: Group\nOne: Planet Pluto; Group Two: Charon, and Group\nThree: Logistics Depot. Each Group had its mission:\n\n\n Group One (Planet Pluto) Mission\n\nFive kilometers from Coldfield, construct and\noperate a simplified fusion-based energy generating\nand power transmission system to provide sufficient\noutput to support all anticipated power and network\nrequirements of the planet;\n\nBeneath and adjacent the Coldfield dome, construct,\norganize and operate encapsulated surface and\nsubsurface laboratories, manufacturing and overhaul\nplants, space and surface transport and traffic\nroutes and controls, surface roadways, utility\nand communications systems, landing and mooring\nfacilities, energy hubs for gravity enhancement\ngrids, and other essential utilities and facilities;\n\nEstablish and administer institutions for law\nenforcement, public health, education and other\ncommunity affairs.\n\n\n Group Two (Charon) Mission\n\nConvert Lamplight into a food-growing and\nprocessing plant capable of feeding the entire\nPlutonian permanent and transit populations, and\non-site personnel at the Logistics Depot and the\nTerminals Construction Site. Encapsulate Lamplight\nin an impermeable radiation-resistant plastic\nmembrane and introduce and maintain constant\ntemperature and air-moisture and other\nagriculture-supportive atmosphere and environment\nthat meets prevailing deep space colony or equal\nstandards;\n\nConstructively use Charon's and Pluto's water ice\nand substances generated as waste and by-products\nof human habitation throughout the Pluto and near\nspace sectors. Conduct research and develop drip,\nhydroponics and other agricultural systems, protein\nsynthesis and manufacture, and ship to Coldfield,\nthe Slingshot work site and the Logistics Depot\nhigh-quality foodstuffs suitable for storage and\nconsumption. Charon operations are to be fully\nautomated and robotically maintained.\n\nIn support of the Charon agricultural mission,\nPlanet Pluto, the Slingshot Logistics Depot, the\nTerminals' construction site, and ships moored\nor in transit within the Special Zone constitute\nan integrated ecological entity. All organics and all\nmineral and chemical plant growth stimulants, such\nas discarded or excess food and fluids, bio-waste,\nusable industrial and community waste, and cadavers\nare committed to processing as fertilizers or\nfor specialized application to the creation of\nfoodstuffs. Organic waste and cadaver parts\nunsuitable for constructive purposes (fertilizer)\non Charon will be fully sterilized and reduced as\nclose as practicable to zero residue.\n\n\n Group Three (Logistics Depot) Mission\n\nConstruct a space station to specification above\nColdfield and designate it 'Slingshot Logistics\nDepot'. Arrange for the depot to serve for central\nreceiving, warehousing and shipping center for\nmateriel committed to the Slingshot Terminals,\nand for processing materiel through all active\nPlanet Pluto surface and sub-surface technical\nand servicing facilities;\n\nProvide the Depot with facilities and train its\npersonnel for emergency backup in manufacturing\nand servicing capabilities redundant to those on\nthe planet;\n\nCreate a highest level technical capability to\nsynthesize materials, and manufacture, fabricate,\ntest and calibrate those precision parts, tools and\naccessories which are best made in the micro-gravity\nand pollution-free conditions of deep space and/or\nsafely distant from Pluto's and Charon's surfaces\nand their gravitational influences;\n\nAugment the Depot's security with a gated force\nfield that fully encapsulates and protects the\nDepot and all vessels engaged in loading and\noff-loading personnel and materiel; patrols\ncontiguous space and keeps the Logistics Depot\nand UIPS citizens and property self-sufficient and\nsafe from disease, harassment and harm;\n\nInstall on the Logistics Depot and at the Terminals\nConstruction Sites independent communications,\ncargo, living organism teleport centers, each\ncapable of receiving and dispatching authorized\ncargoes, passengers, dispatches and communications\nvia conventional, spunnel, and specified\nnon-conventional channels.\n\n ##\n\nThe Terminals Construction Site is the focal point\nof UIPS operations. The Construction Site's mission\nis to research, design, fabricate, test, assemble\nand, ultimately, launch, position at destinations\nand operate, monitor and maintain the Slingshot\nExtractor and Collector terminals en route and\nat their destinations.\n\n ##\n\nThe planning did not anticipate the dissolution\nof the United Planetary System, the creation of\nindependent and estranged Regions in their place,\nand a hostile government on Pluto.\n\nMilitary forces had been non-existent for more than\nfifteen hundred years when the colonies of the Outer\nRegion seceded from the United Planetary System.\nWeapons of mass destruction had had no purpose\nsince the birth of the first World Federation in\nthe fourth century of the Interplanetary Era.\n\nIn place of an organized military, the succeeding\nWorld Federation had created an Interplanetary\nConstabulary to protect lives and property,\ninvestigate crimes, control traffic, and maintain\ngeneral order. Their charter extended to all\nplanets, satellites, colonies, outposts, stations,\nand all places throughout the void into which\nhumankind had ventured.\n\nThe mission of the Constabulary remained unchanged\nduring political reorganizations within the first\nWorld Federation and its successors. Its agents\nranged the Solar System, and performed their duties\nquietly and efficiently. Few dared challenge their\nauthority. When challenges did occur, they were\nnot for long.\n\nWar, and the effects of war on people and things\nwere forgotten.\n\nIt was inconceivable, in those times, that the\nregion beyond the Asteroids would become\npolitically and culturally alienated from the\nunified community that humankind had created to\nguide them into the future. History, the citizens\nof the world concluded, had demonstrated the\nimpotence of the ancient, long-discarded array\nof adversarial nation-states and come-by-chance\nleaders to govern an intellectually advanced\nspecies.\n\nNo one expected a return to the old, long-discarded\nways.\n\nWhen separation of the Inner and Outer Regions\nbecame inevitable, scholars in both Regions\nexplored the possible and the probable\nrelationships that might develop under the new\norder. The studies predicted that politically\nindependent nation-states would create multilateral\nalignments and conflicting societies, lifestyles and\nphilosophies.\n\nThey took into account evolving technological\nand industrial capabilities, prevailing energy and\ndeclining reserves of industrial metals, minerals,\nand other usable substances and related them to the\nSolar System's demographic trends and resources\npredictions. When the United Planetary System\ndissolved, the successor UIPS felt it had no choice\nbut to continue the Slingshot program.\n\nThe conclusions of humankind's most distinguished\nscientists and philosophers suggested that two\nindependent orders in space would bring with them\na heightened likelihood of social and technological\ndislocations and disruptions. There would be\ninterregional and, within INOR, international\ncompetition that would increase the rate of\ndepletion in resources. There would be a multitude\nof disputes, often intentionally misinterpreted,\nto resolve territorial and jurisdictional differences\nthat were already caught up in and molded by the\ndynamics of orbiting planets, and their satellites\nand connecting space-ways.\n\nThe effects on Slingshot could be catastrophic.\nIts security was paramount. Immediately following\nseparation of the two Regions the President of\nthe new UIPS directed the creation of a powerful\nMilitary Space Force.\n\nThe UIPS searched the ancient archives of Earth's\nmilitary history and designed weapons of defense\nand offense. Ships of war and their supporting\nsystems were brought back into being, and spunnel\ngateways expanded to accommodate them. A militant\nphoenix rose from its ancient ashes.\n\nThe Military Space Force was charged\nwith patrolling the space-ways beyond the\nAsteroids to protect UIPS vital interests. Their\nresponsibilities included protecting the lives of\nUIPS citizens and private and government property\nthroughout INOR wherever they happened to be, in\nspace or on the surfaces of planets and satellites.\n\nThe role and intent of the UIPS military was\nexplained to all INOR governments. \"The Military\nSpace Force,\" proclaimed the President of the UIPS,\n\"would remain until INOR's member Nations were\nsufficiently stabilized to participate in ensuring\npeaceful coexistence and passage along space-ways\nand at moorings throughout the Outer Region, and\nseparately and collectively agree to participate in\nand support the Slingshot Program.\"\n\nINOR, as a Federation, interpreted the formation of\nthe UIPS Military Space Force and the President's\nproclamation on its role as contemptuous of their\nsocial and political maturity. The outcome was\npredictable.\n\nLocal INOR Defense Forces were hastily organized\nand equipped. Dozens of ships of war were built and\nmany space transports were converted into armed\nvessels. Each INOR government, using self-defense\nas justification, established controlled corridors\nextending hundreds of thousands of kilometers\ninto its contiguous space, often far beyond their\nlegitimate jurisdictions. Passengers and crews of\nforeign space transports, passenger liners, and\nutility and pleasure craft, whatever their points\nof foreign origin or destination, required visas,\nlocal pilots, and armed escorts upon arrivals and\ndepartures. Suspicions festered on all sides.\n\nIt was an era of international and interregional\npolitical tensions and harassment, and military,\ntechnological and industrial sabotage and\nespionage. The history of Earth's ancients had\nreturned to haunt the solar community.\n\nThe rate of depletion in the Solar Community's\nreserves of vital but nonrenewable substances\nrose rapidly.\n\n\n\n\n\n Appendix\n\n\n Principles of Governance Among Nations in Space\n\nAn article by the Associate General Counsel for the\nSmithsonian Institution reported in THE FUTURIST,\npage 60, May-June 1990 (Common Era) that the\nSmithsonian Institution's National Air and Space\nMuseum had speculated on a Declaration of First\nPrinciples for the Governance of Outer Space\nSocieties. The project's participants represented\na broad array of disciplines and interests,\nincluding engineering, biomedicine, law, economics,\npsychology, bioethics, and philosophy. Rather than\nattempting to frame an actual constitution for\nspace societies, which normally would be reserved\nfor sovereign governments. The document would\nbe a reference for interested government entities\nresponsible for space policy, and to define the\nfundamental rights and freedoms of those who\nmight some day migrate to space.\n\nI wrote to the article's author, told him I was\nworking on this story and included a draft of\n'core principles' I had drafted. I asked for more\ninformation on the Smithsonian's study. The\nauthor's reply included a copy of the Declaration\nand permission to quote from it. It follows:\n\n\n Astrolaw: Carrying Human Rights into Outer Space\n\nOn the occasion of the Bicentennial of the\nConstitution of the United States of America and\nin commemoration and furtherance of its values,\nwe the undersigned petitioners,\n\nBearing witness to the exploration and inevitable\nsettlement of outer space;\n\nRecognizing the universal longing for life,\nliberty, equality, peace and security;\n\nExpressing our unshakable belief in the dignity\nof the individual;\n\nPlacing our trust in societies that guarantee their\nmembers full protection of the law, due process\nand equal protection under the law;\n\nReaffirm our faith in fundamental freedoms;\n\nMindful, as were our nation's founders, of the\nself-evident truth that we are endowed by our\nCreator with certain inalienable rights;\n\nRecognizing the responsibility of a government\nto protect the rights of the governed to exist\nand evolve;\n\nDo assert and declare in this petition the\nintrinsic value of a set of First Principles for\nthe Governance of Outer Space Societies and,\nat the beginning of this third century of nationhood\nunder our Constitution, resolutely urge all people\nof the United Sates of America to acknowledge,\naccept and apply such First Principles as hereinafter\nset forth.\n\n\n ARTICLE I\n\nThe rule of law and the fundamental values embodied\nin the United States Constitution shall apply to\nall individuals living in outer space societies under\nUnited States jurisdiction.\n\nAppropriate constraints upon and limitations of\nauthority shall be defined so as to protect the\npersonal freedom of each individual, such as\nthe right to reasonable privacy, freedom from\nself-incrimination, freedom from unreasonable\nintrusion, search and seizure, and freedom from\ncruel and unusual punishment.\n\nToward this end, the imperatives of community\nsafety and individual survival within the unique\nenvironment of outer space shall be guaranteed\nin harmony with the exercise of such fundamental\nindividual rights of speech, religion, association,\nassembly, contract, travel to, in and from outer\nspace, media and communications, as well as the\nrights of petition, informed consent and private\nownership of property.\n\nThe principles set forth here should not be\nconstrued to exclude any other such rights\npossessed by individuals.\n\n\n ARTICLE II\n\nAuthority in outer space societies, exercised under\nprinciples of representative government appropriate\nto the circumstances and degree of community\ndevelopment, shall reflect the will of the people\nof those societies.\n\nAll petitions to the United States Government from\nouter space societies under its jurisdiction shall\nbe accepted and receive prompt consideration.\n\nThe United States shall provide for an orderly and\npeaceful transition to self-governance by outer\nspace societies under its jurisdiction at such\ntimes as their inhabitants shall manifest clearly\na belief that such transition is both necessary\nand appropriate.\n\nIn response to aggression, threats of aggression\nor hostile actions, outer space societies may provide\nfor their common defense and for the maintenance\nof essential public order.\n\nOuter space societies shall assume all rights and\nobligations set forth in treaties and international\nagreements, relevant to the activities of such\nsocieties, to which the United States is a party\nand which further freedom, peace and security.\n\nThe advancement of science and technology shall be\nencouraged in outer space societies for the benefit\nof all humanity.\n\nOuter space societies shall protect from abuse the\nenvironment and natural resources of Earth and\nspace.\n\nEnd quote.\n\n ##\n\nCore Principles drafted at the First Solar\nConference on the Relationships between the United\nInner Planetary System (UIPS) and the Independent\nNations of the Outer Region (INOR)\n\n Preamble\n\nIn order to:\n\nCreate and foster political, societal, economic,\nand cultural environments throughout the Solar\nSystem which will preclude or minimize acts\nof international and inter-regional aggression,\neconomic warfare, cultural disruption, and other\nforms of active hostility between the United\nInner Planetary System (UIPS) and, separately\nand collectively, Independent Nations of the Outer\nRegion (INOR);\n\nEstablish the framework for peaceful coexistence\nwithin which all Nations respect the sovereignty,\nterritorial integrity, and political independence\nof each other;\n\nRecognize the mutuality of interests among all\npeoples and Governments of the Solar System in\nsharing the benefits of The Interstellar Mining and\nTeleport System; and\n\nPrepare for and extend the human experience\ninto interstellar space and toward the coming\nInterstellar Era.\n\nWe agree to the following:\n\n\n ARTICLE ONE\n\nWe reject and renounce economic, cultural and\nmilitary warfare, and the threat of warfare to\nattain national and regional objectives. We will\nsettle all disagreements and disputes through\npeaceful means.\n\n\n ARTICLE TWO\n\nWe affirm that the peoples of all nations, states,\ncolonies, settlements, communities, howsoever they\nmay be designated now and in the future throughout\nthe Solar System and, eventually throughout the\nInterstellar Realm, have ecological unity. Their\nharmony is such that none are truly independent\nof the others.\n\n\n ARTICLE THREE\n\nWe affirm that the Solar System is the common\nheritage of humankind, and all the resources of the\nSolar System, now and in perpetuity, are part of\nthat common heritage. We agree that each Government\nrepresenting the people of a planet, satellite,\nindependent space entity or a legally constituted\npart and collective thereof, is entitled to its\nfair share of the natural resources originating\nwithin the Solar System or acquired from other\nstar systems. Such resources will be available,\nproportionately, from the Common Reserve in\nconformance with a nation's or government's\nverified needs and technological capabilities to\nutilize the resources for peaceful and beneficial\npurposes.\n\n\n ARTICLE FOUR\n\nIn furtherance of ARTICLE ONE, we most solemnly\ndeclare that continuance of organized military\nforces by any Government of the Solar System can\nserve no useful purpose. We manifestly recognize\nthat the existence of military mass destruction\nweapons and their supporting agencies and\nfacilities increase the likelihood of their\nutilization to resolve differences or\njurisdictional disputes, with consequent harm\nto human life, properties, and civilizations. We,\nindependently and collectively, agree, without\nreservations except for the EXCLUSION stated\nin this ARTICLE, to the phased reduction of all\nmilitary spacecraft, weapons, facilities, personnel\ntraining and other support systems and technologies\nto the point of their complete elimination not more\nthan five Solar Standard Years from the date affixed\nto this Declaration of Principles.\n\n\n EXCLUSION\n\nWe exclude from this ARTICLE specified accords\nwhich are, or will be, required by a legally\nconstituted Government to exercise normal internal\nconstabulary powers and authority on, and in space\ncontiguous to, their planet, satellite, independent\ncommunity or zone, and between and among\nGovernments, as mutually agreed to among the\nParties concerned. The UIPS and INOR will be kept\ninformed of such constabulary agreements prior\nto implementation and their views considered.\n\n\n ARTICLE FIVE\n\nWe recognize that precise delineation's of\nspatial jurisdictions are essential for the\norderly processes of government. We agree that\njurisdictions to be defined and delineated include:\n\na. the outer limits of any one nation's spatial\ncontrol and administration. Such delineation\nshall take into account the irrevocable right\nand obligation of any Government which\nexercises legitimate influence or control over\na non-hazardous natural or artificial planet,\nsatellite, planetoid, space station, outpost,\nspunnel node, link, net or booster; transiting\ncomet, asteroid, meteor swarm, planetary or\nsatellite ring, or other astrophysical body to\nensure absence of human interference to that body's\nor phenomenon's free and unencumbered passage\nthrough that Government's spatial jurisdiction.\n\nb. control and operation of space communications\nbooster, relay, and terminal stations and their\nsupporting research, development, manufacturing,\nand logistics systems and technologies. The\nintent of this delineation is standardized and\neconomically operated and serviced conventional\nand hyperspace communications systems throughout\nthe Solar System and in interstellar space.\n\nc. traffic control, flight safety, and management\nof UIPS and INOR approved inter-regional,\ninterplanetary, inter-satellite and other\nspace-ways. Acceptance of responsibilities shall\nnot exceed the Party's existing technologies,\nresources and capabilities.\n\n\n ARTICLE SIX\n\nWe commit our Governments to accept financial,\nfiduciary, material and technological assessments\nfor our utilization of the common space-ways. We\nagree that these assessments are for the purpose\nof defraying the expenditures of any one Government\ntoward maintaining and upgrading those common\nspace and traffic management systems that fall\nwithin their borders, or other mutually agreed upon\njurisdictions, and for performing such services for\nthe common good as:\n\na. removal of hazards to innocent passage;\n\nb. traffic control;\n\nc. search and rescue;\n\nd. acquisition, deployment, operation and servicing\nof communications and navigational aids;\n\ne. construction, operation and maintenance of space\nand surface ports of entry and departure for the\ncommon use of all spacecraft;\n\nf. trained, equipped and ready investigation teams\nto assist Governments of Primary Concern in\ndetermining the facts of \"incidents-in-space\"\nwhich occur in proximate international areas, and\n\ng. emergency logistical support capabilities for\nperforming urgent essential repairs to damaged\nspacecraft of other Nations in peaceful transit.\nSuch repairs shall be to internationally accepted\nstandards that will permit the craft to continue\nits flight to a location designated by the\nGovernment having legal ownership, or authority\nto repair or dispose of the spacecraft.\n\nh. We agree that spacecraft, spacecraft parts,\notherwise man-made artificial bodies and parts\nthereof, wreckage, and human-generated excess\nmaterials and human waste, will NOT be discarded or\nabandoned in space. Derelicts and unattached parts\nthereof, rubbish, waste matter, and all man-made\nobjects in space are considered to be hazards\nto traffic or are pollutants. They will be collected\nor tagged with an active signal and towed or\ntransported to where they will not be a hazard\nto traffic or pollute the space environment. The\nGovernment of the nearest surface or colony habitat\nwill be notified immediately and institute actions\nfor the objects' reduction to harmless residue\nor its temporary or permanent removal to a safe\nlocation.\n\n\n ARTICLE SEVEN\n\nWe announce the formation of an international\napparatus, with representation from all\nGovernments, to assemble within three Solar\nStandard months from the date affixed hereto. The\nprimary purpose of this Assembly is to facilitate\nimplementation of this Declaration. They shall also\ncreate and ensure support for an interplanetary\ncitizen's volunteer group to review and resolve\ncomplaints and suggestions from the populace that\nmay lead to recommendations toward improvements\nto this Declaration that will:\n\na. promote the free and unencumbered passage of\nvessels, people and commerce between and among\nthe Nations of the Solar System;\n\nb. encourage cultural, economic, and scientific\nresearch, and exchanges of scholars, students,\nand information for the benefit and betterment\nof humankind;\n\nc. enhance the understanding of all peoples\nregarding the positive values which have evolved\nover the millennia since the beginning of the Great\nMigration from Planet Earth, and,\n\nd. organize and begin the planning for humankind's\nexploration and migration into the Interstellar\nRealm.\n\n\n ARTICLE EIGHT\n\nWe declare and affirm we act in concert with the\nspirit and letter of this Declaration of Principles\nin the interests of international cooperation,\ninterplanetary peace and security, mutual\nunderstanding among our far-flung peoples,\nand the survival of our species.\n\n\n ARTICLE NINE\n\nWe encourage all Parties to expand on these accords\nthrough their initiatives and agreements for mutual\nbenefits to themselves and to all Governments and\npeoples in the peaceful use of space.\n\n\n\n\n\n The References\n\n\nASTROLAW.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
