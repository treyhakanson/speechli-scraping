For Glory!\n              And for Heaven's sake, let us out of here!\n\n\nOnce my name was Ameet Ruxt, my skin was light blue, and I was a\nmoderately low-ranking member of the Haldorian Empire. Or should\nI say I was a member of the lower income group? No, definitely\n\"low-ranking,\" because in a warrior society, even one with as high a\ntechnological level as a statistician sits low on the totem pole. He\nis handed the wrong end of the stick--call it what you will; he's\nthe one who doesn't acquire even one wife for years and he hasn't a\ncourtesy title. He's the man they draft into their Invasion Forces--the\nHaldorians are always invading someone--and turn him into a Fighter\nBasic in a third of a year.\n\n\"Look,\" I'd complained to the burly two-striper in the Receiving\nCenter, \"I'm a trained statistician with a degree and....\"\n\n\"Say Sir, when you address me.\"\n\nI started over again. \"I know, Sir, that they use statisticians in the\nservice. So if Haldor needs me in the service it's only sensible that I\nshould work in statistics.\"\n\nThe Hweetoral looked bored, but I've found out since that all\ntwo-stripers looked bored; it's because so many of them have attained,\nat that rank, their life's ambition. \"Sure, sure. But we just got a\ndirective down on all you paper-pushers. Every one of you from now on\nout is headed for Fighter Basic Course. You know, I envy you, Ruxt.\nHaldor, what I wouldn't give to be out there with real men again!\nJetting down on some new planet--raying down the mongrels till they\nyelled for mercy--and grabbing a new chunk of sky for the Empire.\nHaldor! That's the life!\" He glanced modestly down at his medalled\nchest.\n\n\"Yes, Sir,\" I said, \"it sure is. But look at my examination records you\nhave right there. Physically I'm only a 3 and you have to have a 5 to\ngo to Basic Fighter. And besides,\" I threw in the clincher, though I\nwas a bit ashamed of it, \"my fighting aptitude only measures a 2!\"\n\nThe Hweetoral sneered unsubtly and grabbed a scriber with heavy\nfingers. A couple of slashes, a couple of new entries, and lo, I was\nnow a 5 in both departments. I was qualified in every respect.\n\n\"See,\" he said, \"that's your first lesson in the Service, Ruxt.\nFigures don't mean a thing, because they can always be changed. That's\nsomething a figure pusher like you has to learn. So--\" he shoved\nout that ponderous hand and crushed mine before I could protect\nmyself--\"good luck, Ruxt. I know you'll get through that course--alive,\nI mean.\" He chuckled heartily. \"And I know men!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was right. I got through alive. But then, 76.5 per cent of draftees\ndo get through the Basic Fighter Course, alive. But for me it took a\ndrastic rearrangement of philosophy.\n\nMe, all I'd ever wanted was a good life. An adequate income, art and\nmusic, congenial friends, an understanding wife--just one wife was all\nI'd ever hoped for. As you can see, I was an untypical Haldorian on\nevery point.\n\nAfter my first day in Basic Fighter Course I just wanted to stay alive.\n\n\"There's two kinds of men we turn out here,\" our Haldor told us as\nwe lined up awkwardly for the first time (that scene so loved by\nvision-makers). We new draftees called our Trontar our Haldor because\nhe actually had the power over our bodies that the chaplains assured us\nthe Heavenly Haldor had over our liberated spirits. Our Trontar looked\nus over with his fatherly stare, flexing his powerful arm muscles so\nthat his three tattooed stripes rippled and danced. \"Yeah,\" he went\non, \"two kinds of men: Fighting men and dead men!\" The Trontar grinned\nthat fighting Haldorian grin you see all your lives on the Prop Sheets.\n\"And I'll tell you something, men. When you leave here--all Fighters\nBasic--I'm going to envy you. Yeah, I'll really envy you gutsy killers\nwhen you go out in that big Out-There and grab yourselves a new chunk\nof sky.\" He paused and studied our faces. \"Now we're gonna run, and I\ndo mean run, two full decades. The last four men in get to do it over\nagain, and pull kitchen duty tonight too.\"\n\nI tried, as others have tried, to slip quietly out of Basic Fighter. I\ntried being sick, but following sick report one found oneself doing a\nfull day's training--after the understanding medics had shoved some pep\npills into you. I demanded a physical examination. They weren't going\nto push me around.\n\nAfter a couple of days in solitary, I asked in a nice way for physical\nevaluation.\n\nWell, I asked. I wasn't very smart in those days.\n\nThey weren't interested in my story of how my records had been\nfalsified or in my fighting aptitude.\n\n\"Look, draftee,\" the psycho-man said after I finally got to him, \"the\nfact that you've got to see me shows you have enough of a fighting\naptitude. Your Trontar didn't encourage you to request evaluation, did\nhe? And he isn't going to like you very much when you report back to\nyour platoon, is he?\"\n\nI shuddered. \"Not exactly.\"\n\n\"Call me Sir.\"\n\n\"No, Sir. But I was desperate, Sir. I don't think I can stand....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Draftee, you know that some unfortunate men break down in training and\nthat we have to take them out. Maybe you've already lost some that way.\nSuppose you were brought in here, gibbering, yowling, and drooling--I\nguess we'd have to cure you and send you back home as non-fighter\nmaterial, eh?\"\n\nSomeone up here liked me! Here was a tip on how to escape back to the\nold quiet life. I nodded agreeably.\n\n\"But you know, don't you,\" he said softly, \"that first we run a\nthorough test on our drooling draftee? Say it's you....\"\n\nI nodded again.\n\n\"We most always detect fakers. And you know there's a death penalty\nfor any Haldorian attempting to escape his duty.\" He smiled sadly, and\nreminiscently.\n\nI nodded. Maybe someone up here didn't like me.\n\n\"So we'd shoot you dead with one of those primitive projectile\nweapons, as an object lesson for both you and the draftees we had\nremaining.\"\n\nI nodded and tried to show by my countenance how much I approved of\npeople being shot dead with primitive weapons.\n\n\"But suppose,\" he went on, \"that you'd really cracked up or that you'd\nfaked successfully?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir?\" Hope returned, hesitantly and on tip-toes, ready to flee.\n\n\"Then we'd cure you,\" he said. \"But the cure unfortunately involves\nthe destruction of your higher mental faculties. And so there'd be\nnothing for it but to ship you off to one of the mining planets. That's\nstandard procedure, if you didn't know. But I think you'll be all right\nnow, don't you?\"\n\nHope fled. I assured him that I'd be just fine and reported back, on\nthe double, to my training platoon.\n\n\"Just in time, Ruxt,\" my Trontar greeted me. \"Back for full duty, I\ntake it? That's the Haldorian spirit!\" He turned to the platoon which\nwas lined up like three rows of sweaty statues. \"Men, remember what\nI told you about taking cover when you're under fire--and staying\nunder cover? Just suppose we suddenly came under fire--flat trajectory\nstuff--out here on this flat exercise ground with no cover except in\nthat latrine pit over there. Would any of you hesitate to dive into\nthat latrine pit? And once in there, safe and sound, would any of you\nnot stay there until I gave the word to come out?\"\n\nA perceptible shudder passed like a wave over the platoon. We knew the\nTrontar did not ask pointless questions.\n\n\"Of course you wouldn't,\" he assured us, \"and you'd even stay in there\nall day under this hot sun if you had to. Ruxt! You're rested and\nrefreshed from visiting the hospital. You demonstrate how it's done.\"\n\nIt was a long day, even though my Trontar kindly sent some sandwiches\nover to me at high noon. I didn't eat much. But I did do a lot of\nthinking.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was one last hope. I wrote a letter to a remote clan relative who\nwas supposed to have a small amount of influence.\n\nIt was a moving letter. I told how my test results had been falsified,\nwhat beasts our trainers were, how the medics refused to retest\nme--very much the standard letter that new Haldorian trainees write.\nAs I went out to mail this plea, one evening, I met two of my fellow\ntrainees starting out on a night march in full field equipment.\n\n\"How come?\" I asked, instantly fearful that I'd missed some notice on\nthe bulletin board.\n\n\"We wrote letters,\" one of them said simply.\n\n\"The Trontar censors all our mail,\" said the other. \"Didn't you know?\nOh, well, neither did we.\"\n\nAs they marched off, I made a small bonfire out of my letter after\nfirst, almost, just throwing it away--before I remembered that the\nHweetorals checked our waste cans. What a man has to do to hold two\nmeasly stripes!\n\nAcceptance of the inevitable is the beginning of wisdom, says the\nancient Haldorian sage. I put in an application for transfer to the\nStatistical Services to be effective upon _completion_ of Basic Fighter\nCourse.\n\n\"Statistical Services?\" the Company Clerk asked. \"What's that? Anyhow,\nyou're going to be a Fighter Basic, if you get through this training,\"\nhe said darkly. The Company Clerk was a sad victim of our Haldorian\npassion for realistic training; he had lacked one day of completing\nFighter Basic when he'd let his leg dangle a bit too long after he'd\nscaled a wall, and the training gentlemen had unemotionally shot it\noff. As it turned out, our efficient surgeon/replacers had been unable,\nfor some technical reason, to grow back enough leg for full duty. So\nthere was nothing for it but to use the man as could be best done.\nThey'd made him a clerk--mainly because that was the specialty they\nwere shortest of at the time.\n\n\"Who says you can put in for Statistical Services?\" the Company Clerk\ndemanded.\n\n\"Reg 39-47A.\" I was learning my way around. The night before I was on\norderly duty in the office. I had tracked down the chapter and verse\nwhich, theoretically, allowed a man to change his destiny.\n\n\"Know the Regs, do you? Starting to be a trouble-maker, huh? Yeah,\nRuxt, I'll put in your application.\"\n\nI turned away with some feeling of relief. This might possibly work.\n\nThe Company Clerk called me back. \"You know the Regs so good, Ruxt,\" he\nsaid. \"How come you didn't ask me for permission to leave? I'm cadre,\nyou know.\" He leaned back in his chair and grinned at me. \"Just to\nhelp you remember the correct Haldorian deportment I'm putting you on\nkitchen duty for the next three nights. That way,\" he grinned again,\n\"you can divide up your five hours of sleep over three nights instead\nof crowding them all into one.\"\n\nPoor deluded Company Clerk! I actually averaged three hours of sleep\nevery one of those three nights--after I found out that the mess\nTrontar would accept my smoking ration.\n\nI felt that I was beginning to understand the system, a little and at\nlong last, particularly after I saw my co-workers in the kitchen doing\nwhat should have been my work.\n\n\nII\n\nThen we started combat training, and then we started losing our normal\n23.5 per cent.\n\nIt wasn't too bad as long as they stuck to the primitive stuff. I mean,\nyou can see arrows and spears coming at you, and even if you have\nhad only the five hours of sleep you can either duck the projectiles\nor catch them on your shield. And with the medics on the alert, the\nwounds are painful but seldom fatal. You just end up with a week's\nhospitalization and slip back to the next training group. But when they\ngo up to the explosively-propelled solids, when the Trontar smirks and\nsays: \"Men, this is called a boomer, or a banger, or maybe sometimes a\nfirestick, depending on what planet you're fighting on,\" and when he\nholds up a contraption of wood and metal with a hole at one end and a\nhandle on the other--then, Draftee, look out!\n\nIt takes time to learn. It isn't till you associate a bang in the\ndistance with a perforated man beside you that you do learn. And when\nyou finally come under fire from our regular production weapons like\nrays--well!\n\nYou might wonder why they run us through the entire history of weapons\nstarting with the sling and ending with the slithers--the name\nservicemen give to those Zeta Rays that diverge from line of sight to\ndrop in on a dug-in enemy. The usual explanation is that Haldorians\nare still invading places where the natives still use such things as\nbows and arrows. But I think, myself, that it's something the Mil Prop\nguys figured out. The idea is, as I see it, to run you right through\nthe whole course of our fighting, invading Haldorian history, and in\nthat way to make a better fighter out of you. And you do get rid of\nthe death-prones before there's much time or work invested in them--or\nbefore their inevitable early death means the failure of a mission.\nHaldoria--most practical of Empires!\n\nBut they didn't make a fighter of me. All they did was to reinforce\nmy natural survival instinct considerably, acquaint me with the\ntortuous ways of the service, and give me a great urge for a peaceful\nexistence. But to all appearances, as I stood in the orderly room after\ngraduation, I was the ideal poster-picture of a Haldorian, completely\nuniformed with polished power boots and rayer, a crawler to the\nhigher-ups and a stomper on the lower-downs, a Fighter Basic with no\ncompassion but with a certified aptitude for advancement to at least\nthe rank of Trontar.\n\n\"Fighter Basic Ruxt,\" the Dispositions Hweetoral announced.\n\n\"Here, Sir!\"\n\n\"Your application for transfer to Statistical Services has been\ndisapproved.\" The two-striper's expression showed what he, as a\nfighting man, thought of the Statistical Services. \"But we've got a\nreal assignment for you, Ruxt! The 27th Invasion Force is all set\nto drop on a new system. You're lucky, Ruxt, that you put in that\napplication. We had to hold you till it bounced. Your buddies got\nshipped to those rear-echelon guard outfits, but you're going to a\nreal fighting one. It should be a good invasion--this new system's got\natomic fission, I hear. And I'd like to tell you something, Ruxt....\"\n\n\"I know what, Sir,\" I said. \"You envy me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe 27th was a real fighting unit all right: they had their own\nneckerchief, their own war cry, and a general who was on his way up.\nNow they had me.\n\nAnd they were going to get another system for the Haldorian Empire.\n\nYou see, those intelligent worms, or maybe they are slugs--I'm a bit\nvague on universe geography--over on the next Galaxy but one, give\nus Haldorians all sorts of difficulties. They insist on freedom,\nself-determination, and all that sort of thing. That's all very well,\nbut they insist on them for themselves. Our high-level planners\ndecided that another solar system would make a better offensive set-up\nfor Haldoria. The planners, I understand, have all sorts of esoteric\ntheories about the ideal shape and size of an offensive unit. They ring\nin time and something related to time which makes Galaxy distances\ndiffer according to which direction you are travelling. As I say,\nesoteric.\n\nThe only thing that mattered to me was that some technicians had fed\nsome data into a computer and it had hiccupped and said: \"You'll\nneed such-and-such a planet to control such-and-such a solar system,\nand that will give you a better offensive set-up.\" Then the computer\nhiccupped again and said: \"You'll need to draft and train Ameet Ruxt\nto help on this little job of taking over this planet called Terra, or\nEarth.\"\n\nThat's what it amounted to, anyhow. Consequently I joined the 27th\nInvasion Force.\n\n\"So you've got an application in for transfer to the Statistical\nServices, huh?\" Trontar Hytd, my new platoon three-striper, asked when\nI reported in for duty with the 27th.\n\n\"Yes, Sir.\" I'd learned, along the line, that one should never give up\nwhen applying for a transfer--just keep one in the mill.\n\n\"Huh, Borr, this new guy likes to work with figures,\" Trontar Hytd\ngrowled at Hweetoral Borr, my new squad leader. \"Thinks he doesn't\nwant to be a Fighter.\" Trontar Hytd looked at me questioningly.\n\nI didn't say anything. I'd learned a lot in Basic Fighter Course.\n\n\"Figures?\" asked Hweetoral Borr. I could see a train of thought had\nbeen started in the Hweetoral's mind.\n\n\"Yeah, figures,\" snapped Trontar Hytd. \"He likes to count things, Borr.\nGet it?\"\n\n\"Guess we need all our ray charges counted, for one thing,\" suggested\nHweetoral Borr. \"I get all mixed up with them figures.\"\n\n\"After training hours, of course,\" Trontar Hytd said.\n\n\"Of course, Trontar. And someone's gotta jawbone some kind of report on\nammo expenditures every training day. Maybe after the rest of us have\nsacked in, for instance?\"\n\n\"Of course. Okay, Hweetoral, I guess you got the idea.\"\n\nInvasion was almost a relief after that brief bit of refresher training\nthe 27th was going through.\n\nOur General-on-the-way-up had outlined his plan of attack: \"Drop'm,\nhit'm, lift'm and drop'm again.\" So I dropped, hit the defenders, was\nlifted to a new center of resistance, and dropped again. I understand\nit was a standard type of invasion, there's only one way to do simple\nthings.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce in a while, these days, I remember those sadistic and\nbattle-hardened comrades of mine. Hard, gutsy Trontar Hytd stayed\non his feet to direct his platoon underground after our Kansas\nforce collapsed, and one of those little fission weapons separated\nhis body parts too widely for even our unsentimentally competent\nsurgeon/replacer to reassemble him. Well, they had a go at the job, but\nthey had to ray down what they created--some primitive regression had\nset in and the creature was hungry.\n\nAnd rough and tough Hweetoral Borr incautiously scratched his hairy\near just when one of those rude projectile weapons was firing at\nhim. The slug slipped through that opening the Hweetoral had made in\nhis body armor. With the brain gone--or such brain as Hweetoral Borr\npossessed--our kindly old surgeon/replacer was foxed again.\n\nThen there were the new germs....\n\nBut these things are as nothing to the creative military mind. A swarm\nof regulations, manuals and directives issue forth from headquarters,\nand force fields cease to collapse, and fighters keep their body armor\non and adjusted. When something like the influenza germ wipes out half\na platoon, the wheels turn, a new vaccine is devised, and no more\nHaldorians die from that particular germ. All the individual has to do\nis to live from one injection to the next (any civilized enemy always\ndreams up new diseases), move from one enemy strong point to the next,\nand dream of the day when he can return to his old life. For me it was\na dream of returning to that quiet tiny room with its walls lined with\nthe best of Haldorian art--just cheap reproductions, of course--and\nnever again to handle a rayer or to wear armor. Real life, meanwhile,\nwent on.\n\n\"Fighter First-Class Ruxt! Take these men and blast that strong\npoint!\" That would be the order somewhere in Missouri, or maybe in\nMississippi--I never was much good on micro-geography. \"Hweetoral Ruxt!\nTake your squad and clean out that city. New Orleans they call it. Get\ntheir formal surrender and make damn sure there are no guerrillas left\nwhen the colonel comes through to inspect.\"\n\nBy the time I was Trontar Ruxt the invasion was practically over. As I\nsay, it was the standard thing with one or two countries holding out\nafter all hope was gone--England never did formally surrender, not that\nit mattered--and our successful General was made a Sub-Marshal of the\nHaldorian Empire.\n\nA real promotion and a great honor. Much good it did him when he\nventured his battle fleet too far into the Slug lines a year later.\n\nWith the fighting over--the real fighting, I mean--the ever-efficient\nHaldorians started moving their troops off Earth to get ready for a new\nand bigger invasion that the computers had decreed. Only a few troops\nwere to be left behind for occupation and guard stuff.\n\nI had a talk with a fat Assignments Trontar in his plush office.\n\n\"You know, Trontar,\" I said, \"I was hoping to see more of this world\nhere, and the rumor is that all of us excess combat types are being\nshipped to a training world to be shaped into new invasion forces.\"\n\n\"Tough,\" he said. He should know. He'd requisitioned a mansion complete\nwith servants and everything. He even had a native trained to drive one\nof their luxuriously inefficient ground vehicles. What a deal! That\nTrontar had no worries, _his_ anti-grav ray was working.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I heard that a man doesn't even need any money if he's stationed down\nat our headquarters,\" I said, and I hauled out a handful of Haldorian\nnotes from my pocket. \"Guess I wouldn't need this stuff if I was\ntransferred down to our headquarters.\"\n\n\"Who needs money?\" he asked. \"Guys all the time trying to bribe me,\nTrontar. You'd be surprised. Sure glad you aren't, though, because I\ndo hate to turn anyone in.\"\n\nI put the money back in my pocket. \"Speaking of turning in people,\"\nI said casually, \"you ever have any trouble with the undercover boys\nabout all this loot you've picked up?\" This, I thought, would shake\nhim--and at the same time I marvelled at how I'd changed from a simple,\nnaive statistician to a tough and conniving combat NCO.\n\nHe yawned all over his fat face and swung his swivel chair so that\nhe could better admire the picture beside his desk. I recognized the\npicture as a moderately good reproduction of a Huxtner, a minor painter\nof our XXVth. \"No,\" the Assignments Trontar said, \"it turns out that\none of my sept brothers runs the local watch birds. He often drops in\nhere to visit with me. But anything I can do for you, Trontar?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, and I fired at the only possible loophole left, \"I'll\njust leave quietly so you can admire your Huxtner.\"\n\nHe swung back to me with a start. \"You recognize a Huxtner? You're the\nfirst man I've ever met in the service who ever heard of Huxtner, let\nalone recognizing one of his masterpieces! Hey, did you know I brought\nthis all the way from home in my hammock roll? And just look at the\ncoloring of that figure there!\"\n\nThe loophole had been blasted wide open. \"You're lucky,\" I said,\nand I went on to lie about how I'd lost my own Huxtner prints in the\ninvasion. \"No one,\" I continued, \"ever got quite that flesh tint of\nHuxtner's, did they?\"\n\nHuxtner, by the way, is notorious for using a yellow undercoat for his\nblue flesh colors, unlike every realistic painter before or after who\nhave all used green undercoats--what else? Imagine a chrome-yellow\nunderlaying a blue skin color. All Huxtner's figures look like two-week\ncorpses--but Huxtner enthusiasts are unique.\n\nThe Assignments Trontar and I had a nice long chat about Huxtner, at\nthe conclusion of which he insisted on scratching my name from the\nlist of combat-bound men and putting me on a much smaller list of men\nscheduled for our guard outfit, stationed at the old Terran capital of\nWashington.\n\nI had an un-Haldorian feeling of having arranged my own life after that\nincident. That feeling persisted even after I took over one of the\nguard platoons and discovered that life in a guard outfit is rather\nsimilar to Basic Fighter Course.\n\n\"Trontar Ruxt! Two men of your platoon have tarnished armor. Get them\nworking on it, and maybe you'd better stay and see that they do it\nproperly.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir.\"\n\nOne lives and learns. I turned the job of supervising the armor\ncleaning to the Hweetorals of the squads and then I went home to my\nnative woman. Yes, this guard's outfit life was like Fighter Basic\nCourse.\n\nBut only for the lower ranks.\n\n\nIII\n\nLife wasn't too unendurable in those days. The duties were incredibly\ndull, of course, but the danger of sudden death had receded, since only\na few fanatics still tried to pick off us occupation troops. And this\nnew world of Haldoria's was rich in the things a sensitive and artistic\nman appreciates: painting, sculpture, music. Then there was this new\nand pleasing thing of living with a woman....\n\nBut it wouldn't last long.\n\nSoon there'd be another planet to invade and maybe a space battle with\nthe great enemy. More years of cramped living and lurking danger, for\nin the Empire one was drafted for the duration, and this duration was\nnow some four hundred years old. The most Trontar Ruxt could expect,\nthe very most, was to somehow keep alive for another fifty years and\nthen to retire on a small pension to one of the lesser worlds of the\nEmpire.\n\n\"Trontar Ruxt! Your records show that you're a statistician.\" My\ncommanding officer stared at me suspiciously, for a fighting man, even\none on guard duty, distrusts office personnel. And as everyone knows,\n\"Once a fighting man, always a fighting man.\" I think my C.O.'s last\naction had been thirty years ago.\n\n\"I was a statistician before I got in the service, Sir.\"\n\n\"Well, they're screaming over at headquarters for qualified office\npersonnel, and we have to send them any trained men we have--of any\nrank.\"\n\n\"It's for Haldor, Sir,\" I said. By now I knew the correct answer was\nmost often the noncommittal one.\n\nI reported to the Headquarters, 27th Invasion Force. The rumor was\nthat Phase II, Reduction of Inhabitants to Slavery with Shipment to\nHaldorian Colonies, was about to start. And also, our Planners were\nsupposed to be well into Phase III, Terraforming, already. Terraforming\nwas necessary, of course, to bring the average temperature of earth\ndown to something like the sub-arctic so that we Haldorians could live\nhere in comfort. We lost quite a few fighters during invasion when\ntheir cooling systems broke down. Rumor, as always, was dead right; and\nthe Headquarters was a mad rat-race.\n\nThe Senior Trontar of the office was delighted to get another body.\n\n\"Took your time getting here, Ruxt! You guard louts don't know the\nmeaning of time, do you?\"\n\nI remained at attention.\n\n\"So you're a statistician, are you? Well, we don't need any\nstatisticians now. We just got in a whole squad of them. Can you use a\nwriter, maybe?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Yes, Sir,\" I did not remind the Senior Trontar that using a writer was\na clerk's job, not a Trontar's, not a combat three-striper's, because\nthe chances were that he knew it, for one thing. And he could easily\nmake me a clerk, for another thing.\n\n\"Okay. Now that we understand each other,\" the Senior Trontar grinned,\n\"or that you understand me, which is all that matters, here's your\njob.\" He handed me a stack of scribbled notes, some rolls of speech\ntape and a couple of cans of visual stuff. \"Make up a report in\nstandard format like this example. Consolidate all this stuff into it.\nThis report has to be ready in two days, and it has to be perfect. No\nmisspellings, no erasures, no nothing. Got that?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir,\" he mimicked. \"Haldor only knows why they couldn't send me a\nfew clerks instead of a squad of statisticians and one guard Trontar.\nDo you know what this stuff is that you're going to work up? It's the\nfinal report on our invasion here!\"\n\nI looked impressed. Strange how you learn, after a while, even the\nfacial expression you are supposed to wear.\n\n\"Do you know why this report has to be perfect in format and\nappearance?\" I wouldn't say the Senior Trontar's manner was bullying,\nquite. Perhaps one could call it hectoring. \"Because the Accountant\nis out in this sector somewhere and we have to be ready for him if he\ndrops in.\"\n\nThis time I didn't have to try to look impressed. The Accountant is the\nman who passes judgment on the conduct of all military matters--though\nof course he's not one man, but maybe a dozen of them. Armed with\nthe invaluable weapon of hindsight, he drops in after an invasion\nis completed. He determines whether the affair has gone according\nto regulations, or whether there has been carelessness, slackness\nor wasting of Haldorian resources of men or material. Additionally\nhe monitors civil administration of colonies and federated worlds.\nThere are stories of Generals becoming Fighter Basics and Chief\nAdministrators becoming sub-clerks after an Accountant's visit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI got the report done, but it took the full two days--mainly because\nfighting men make such incomplete and erroneous reports while action\nis going on. I got to understand the exasperated concern of office\npersonnel who have to consolidate varied fragments into a coherent\nwhole. And adding to the natural difficulties of the task was the\ncontinual presence of the Senior Trontar, and his barbed comments and\nlurid promises as to what would follow my failure at the work.\n\nBut the report was done and sent in to the Adjutant.\n\nIt came back covered with scribbled changes, additions, and\ndeletions--and it came back carried by a much disturbed Senior Trontar.\n\n\"Who in Haldor do they think I am?\" he moaned. \"I just handed on to you\nthe figures that they gave me. Me! And threatening me with duty on a\nspace freighter ... and one into the Slug area at that!\"\n\nI thought, as I looked at my ruined script, that guard duty wasn't so\nbad, and that even combat wasn't rough _all_ the time.\n\n\"See, Trontar,\" the four-striper said, calling me by my proper rank for\nthe first time, \"you did a good job, the Adjutant himself said so. But\nthese figures....\" he shuddered. \"If the Accountant should see these\nwe'd all be for it. Space-freighter duty would be getting off light.\"\nThe Senior Trontar seemed almost human to me right then.\n\n\"I just put down what you gave me,\" I said.\n\n\"Yeah, sure, Ruxt. But I didn't realize, nobody realized, how bad the\nfigures were till they were all together and written up. Look, this\nreport shows that we shouldn't Terraform this planet--that we can't\nmake a nudnick on the slavery proposition--and that maybe we shouldn't\nhave even invaded this inferno at all.\"\n\n\"So what do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what you're going to do....\" The Senior Trontar had\nregained his normal nasty disposition. \"You're going to re-do this\nreport. You're going to re-do it starting now, you're going to work on\nit all night, and you're going to have it on my desk and in perfect\nshape when I come in in the morning, or, by Haldor, the next thing you\nwrite will be your transfer to the space freighter run nearest the Slug\nGalaxy.\" The Senior Trontar ran momentarily out of breath. \"And,\" he\ncame back strongly, \"you won't be going as no Trontar, neither!\"\n\n\"It'll be on your desk in the morning, Sir,\" I said.\n\nDeck hands on the space freighter run were, I'd heard, particularly\nexpendable.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy the middle of the third watch I had completed a perfect copy of the\nreport complete with attachments, appendices, and supplements. And also\nby this time I knew from the differences between the original report\nand this jawboned version that someone had goofed badly in undertaking\nthis invasion, and then had goofed worse in not calling the thing off.\nNow there was to be considerable covering-up of tracks. The thought\nsuddenly came to me that a guard's trontar named Ruxt knew rather a\nlot of what had gone on. Following that mildly worrying thought came a\nnotion that perhaps a guard's trontar named Ruxt might be considered\nby some as just another set of tracks to be covered up. That far-off\nretirement on a small but steady income became even more unlikely, and\nthe possibilities began to appear of a quick end in the Slug-shattered\nhulk of a space freighter.\n\nHad the Senior Trontar changed in his attitude towards me, towards\nthe end of the day, perhaps acted as though I were a condemned man?\nPossibly. And had some of the officers been whispering about me late in\nthe afternoon? Could have been.\n\nShaken, I wandered down to the mess hall and joined a group of\nthird-watch guards, who were goofing off while their Trontar was\nchecking more distant guard posts.\n\n\"It's easy,\" one of them was telling the others. \"All you got to do is\nto slip some surgeon/replacer a few big notes and he gives you this\noperation which makes you look like a native. And then you just settle\ndown on Astarte for the rest of your life with the women just begging\nyou to let them support you.\"\n\n\"You mean you'd rather live on some lousy federated world than be a\nHaldorian in the Invasion Forces?\" There was a strong sardonic note in\nthe questioner's voice.\n\n\"Man, you ever been on Astarte?\" the first man asked incredulously.\n\n\"Yeah, but how are you going to be sure that the surgeon/replacer\ndoesn't turn you in?\" objected one of the others. \"He could take your\nmoney, do the operation, and have you picked up. That way he'd have the\nmoney and get a medal too.\"\n\n\"I'd get around that,\" the talky guy said, \"I'd just....\"\n\nAt this point he was jabbed in the arm by one of his buddies who had\nnoticed my eavesdropping. The man shut up. All four of them drifted off\nto their posts.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI went reluctantly back to the office. From then till dawn I dreamed\nup and rehearsed all manner of wild schemes to take me out of this\ndangerous situation. Or was it all perhaps just imagination? A\nHaldorian Trontar should never be guilty of an excess of that quality.\nBut I made sure when the Senior Trontar sneaked in a bit before the\nregular opening time, that I was just, apparently, completing the last\npage of the report. The impression I hoped to convey was that I had\nspent the entire night in working and worrying.\n\n\"It's okay,\" the Senior Trontar growled after he had studied the\ncompleted report. \"Guess you can take a couple of days off, Ruxt. I\nbelieve in taking care of my men. Say,\" he asked casually, \"I suppose\nyou didn't understand those figures you were working up, did you?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"I didn't pay any attention to them, they were just\nsomething to copy, that's all.\" I felt confident that I could out-fence\nthe Senior Trontar any time at this little game, but what had he and\nthe Adjutant been whispering about before they had come in?\n\n\"But you used to be a statistician, didn't you?\" He looked at the far\ncorner of the room and smiled slightly. \"But you take a couple days\noff, Ruxt. Maybe we'll find something good for you when you come back.\"\nHe smiled again. \"Don't forget to check out with the Locator before you\ngo, though. We don't want to lose you.\"\n\nI stumbled home, not even noticing the hate-filled glances my armor and\nblue skin drew from the natives along the streets. The glances were\nstandard, but this feeling of being doomed was new.\n\nThey were going to get me. I felt sure of that, even though my Sike\nTest Scores had always been as low as any normal's. But how could a\nHaldorian disappear on this planet? Aside from skin color, there was\nthe need to keep body temperatures at a livable level. The body armor\nunit was good only for about a week. Find a surgeon/replacer and bribe\nhim to change me to an Earthman? I saw now how ridiculous such an idea\nwas. But was there nothing but to wait passively while the Senior\nTrontar and the Adjutant, and whoever else did the dirty work, all got\ntogether and railroaded me off?\n\nHaldorians, though, never surrender--or so the Mil Prop lad would have\nus believe. Right from the time you are four years old and you start\nseeing the legendary founders of Haldoria--Bordt and Smordt--fighting\noff the fierce six-legged carnivores, you are told never to give up.\n\"Where there's Haldor, there's Hope!\" \"There's always another stone for\nthe wolves, if you but look.\" I must confess I'd snickered (way deep\ninside, naturally) at these exhortations ever since I'd reached the age\nof thinking, but now all these childhood admonitions came rushing back\nto give me strength, quite as they were intended to do. I found that I\ncould but go down like any Haldorian, fighting to the last.\n\n\nIV\n\nSo I put on my dress uniform the next day, and made sure that nothing\ncould be deader than the dulled bits, or brighter than the polished\nones. A bit of this effort was wasted since I arrived at Headquarters\nlooking something less than sharp. The cooling unit in my armor was\nacting up a bit; and, also, three Terran city guerillas had tried to\nambush me on the way. You take quite a jolt from a land mine, even with\narmor set on maximum. Some of those people never knew when they were\nlicked. No wonder their Spanglt Resistance Quotient was close to the\nhighest on record.\n\nI got through the three lines of guards and protective force fields\nall right, checking my rayer here, my armor there--the usual dull\nprocedure. By the time I reached the Admissions Officer I was down to\nuniform and medals.\n\n\"You want to see the Accountant?\" the Admissions Officer asked\nincredulously. \"You mean one of his staff! Well, where's your request\nslip, Trontar?\"\n\n\"I've come on my own, Sir,\" I said, \"not from my office, so I haven't\na request slip.\"\n\n\"Come on your own? What's your unit? Give me your ID card!\"\n\nLet's see, I thought, I've abstracted classified material from the\nfiles and carried it outside the office, I've broken the chain of\ncommand and communication, and, worst of all, I'd tried to see a senior\nofficer without a request slip. Yeah, maybe I'd be lucky to end up as a\n_live_ deckhand on a space freighter.\n\nA bored young Zankor with the rarely-seen balance insignia of the\nAccountant's Office rose from behind the Admissions Officer.\n\n\"I'll take responsibility for this man,\" he said casually to the A.O.\n\"Follow me, Trontar. I was wondering when you'd turn up.\"\n\n\"Me?\"\n\n\"Well, someone like you. Though usually it's scared sub-clerks that we\ndrag up. And that reminds me.\" He turned to another young and equally\nbored Zankor standing nearby. \"Take over, Smit, will you? They're\nbringing in that sub-clerk who's been writing those anonymous letters.\nI've reserved the Inquisition Room for a couple of hours for him.\"\n\nI followed the Zankor as he strode away, wondering as I did if they had\nmore than one Inquisition Room.\n\nHe led me into a small room just off the corridor and motioned me to a\nchair. \"Before you see the Accountant, Trontar,\" he said, \"I'll have\nto screen what you have. It may be that we won't have to bother the\nAccountant at all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe smooth way the Zankor talked and his friendly manner almost\nconvinced me that we should both put the interests of the Accountant\nfirst. But then it occurred to me that a man with the gold knot of a\nZankor on his collar wasn't often friendly with a mere Trontar. That\nthought snapped me out of it and I knew I should only give the minimums.\n\n\"I've got documents,\" I said--\"document\" is such a lovely strong word,\n\"which prove that the official report on the invasion and occupation of\nthis planet is false.\" That, I thought, was as minimum as one could get.\n\n\"Ah, and have you?\" The Zankor still looked bored. \"Well, let's see\nthem, Trontar,\" he said briskly.\n\nThe Zankor had that sincere look the upper class always uses when they\nare about to do you dirt. They blush that heavy shade of blue, almost\npurple, and they look you straight in the eye, and they quiver a bit as\nto voice ... and the next thing you know, you're shafted.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Sir,\" I said, \"but what I have is so important that I can\ngive it to the Accountant only.\"\n\nHe stared at me for rather a long moment, pondering, no doubt, the\npleasures of witnessing a full-dress military flogging. Then he\nshrugged and picked up the speaker beside him. He didn't call the\nTrontar of the Guard to come and take my documents by force. I could\ntell that even though he spoke in High Haldorian, that harsh language\nthe upper class are so proud of preserving as a relic from the days\nof the early conquerors. No, he was speaking to a superior--there's\nnever any doubt as to who is on top when people are speaking High\nHaldorian--and then I caught the emphatic negative connected with\nthe present-day Haldorian phrases meaning Phase II and Phase III,\nTerraforming. So even though I don't know High Haldorian, and would\nnever be so incautious as to admit it if I did, I knew roughly what had\nbeen said.\n\nAnd I was frantically revising my plans.\n\n\"Follow me,\" the Zankor said, after completing the call. \"We'll see the\nAccountant now, and--\" he looked at me sincerely--\"you'd better have\nsomething very good indeed. You really had, Trontar.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Accountant turned out to be a tall and thin Full Marshal, the\nfirst I'd seen. He was dressed in a uniform subtly different from\nthe regulation, and he wore only one tiny ribbon, which I didn't\nrecognize. He had the slightly deeper-blue skin you often see on the\nupper classes, though this impression may have been due to the green\nfurnishings of the room. It was, in fact, called the Green Room, when\nthe Terrans had used it as one of their regional capitals.\n\nI saluted the Accountant with my best salute, the kind you lift like it\nwas sugar and drop as if it were the other. The Accountant responded\nwith one of those negligent waves that tell you the saluter was a\nsurvivor of the best and bloodiest private military school in existence.\n\n\"Proceed, Trontar,\" the Accountant said, leaning back and relaxing as\nif he didn't have a care in the universe.\n\nI launched into my speech, the one I'd been mentally rehearsing. I\ntold him I knew I was breaking the chain of communication, but that I\nwas doing it for the service and for Haldoria, etc. Any old serviceman\nknows the routine. I was, as I ran through this speech, just as\nsincere and just as earnestly interested in the good of Haldoria as\nany Haldorian combat Trontar could be. But, deep inside me, the old\nAmeet Ruxt was both marveling at the change in himself and cynically\nappreciating the performance.\n\nThe Accountant interrupted the performance about halfway through. \"Yes,\nyes, Trontar,\" he said brusquely, \"I think we can assume your action is\nfor the good of Haldoria, may the Empire increase and the Emperor live\nforever. Yes. But you say you have material dealing with the overall\nreport on our invasion and occupation of this planet. You further say\nthis material shows discrepancies in the official report--which you\nimply you have seen.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir,\" I said, and I handed over the several sheets of paper which\ncomprised the old report and the changes of the new. Meanwhile, behind\nme, the Zankor was invisible but I had not a doubt but that he was\nthere, keeping the regulation distance from me.\n\nThese people knew their business.\n\nThe Accountant took the collection of papers and compared them with\nsome others he had on his desk. I continued to stand at Full Brace.\nOnce you've been chewed out for slipping into an Ease position without\nbeing so ordered, you never forget.\n\nThe Accountant laid down the papers, scanned my face, got up and\nwalked to the far end of the room. In front of a mirror he stopped\nand fingered that one small ribbon, quite, I thought, as if he were\nmatching it with another one.\n\nHe came back quickly and sat down again. \"Zankor,\" he said, \"set up\na meeting with the top brass for this afternoon. I'll talk with the\nTrontar privately.\"\n\nThe Zankor saluted and was on his way out the door when the Accountant\nspoke again. \"And Zankor....\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir?\"\n\n\"I should be very unhappy if the top brass here--the _present_ top\nbrass--found out about this material the Trontar brought.\"\n\nThe Zankor swallowed hard and assured the Accountant that he\nunderstood ... \"Sir.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen we were alone and the Accountant was suddenly a kindly old man who\ninvited me to sit down and relax. I did. I really let go and stretched\nout, I forgot everything I'd ever been taught as a child or had learned\non my climb to the status of Trontar. I relaxed and he had me.\n\nI had been caught on the standard Haldorian Soft/Hard Tactic.\n\n\"Disabuse your mind, Trontar,\" the Accountant snapped, and he was no\nlonger a kindly old man but a thin-lipped Haldorian snapper, \"of any\nidea that you have saved the Empire--or any such nonsense!\" Having\ncracked his verbal whip about my shoulders he just crouched there,\nglaring at me, his mouth entirely vanished and his eyes--well, I'd just\nas soon not think about some things.\n\nYes, and then he gave me the Shout/Silence treatment, the whole thing\nso masterfully timed that at the end he could have signed me on as\na permanent latrine keeper on a spy satellite in the Slug Galaxy.\nA genius, that man was. The sort of man who could--and probably\ndid--control forty wives without a weapon.\n\n\"Your information, as it happens,\" he said after I had regained my\nsenses, \"checks with other data I've received. It might be, of course,\nthat the whole thing is a fabrication of my enemies. In that case,\nTrontar--\" he looked at me earnestly--\"you can be assured you'll not be\naround to rejoice at or to profit from my downfall.\"\n\n\"Of course, Sir,\" I said, quite as earnestly as he.\n\n\"But we both know that you are only a genuine patriot,\" he said with a\nhearty chuckle, a chuckle exactly like that of a Father Goodness--that\nkindly old godfather who brings such nice presents to every Haldorian\nchild until they are six, and who on that last exciting visit brings,\nand enthusiastically uses, a bundle of large and heavy whips to\ndemonstrate that no one can be trusted. Efficient teachers, the\nHaldorians.\n\n\"Just a genuine patriot,\" the Accountant repeated, \"who has rendered\na considerable service to the Empire. Trontar,\" he said, all friendly\nand intimate, \"the Empire likes to reward well its faithful sons. What\nwould you most like to have or to do?\"\n\n\"To serve Haldoria, Sir!\" I was back on my mental feet at last.\n\nHe dropped his act then. He was, I think, just practicing anyway. We\nhad a short talk then, the kind in which one person is quickly and\nefficiently pumped of everything he knows. After about ten minutes of\nquestion and answers, the Accountant leaned back and studied my face\ncarefully.\n\n\"Have you considered Officers' Selection Course, Trontar? I might be\nable to help you a little in getting in.\"\n\nOfficers' Selection Course was, I knew, Fighter Basic Course multiplied\nin length and casualties. Less than 20 per cent graduate ... or escape.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"No, Sir,\" I said. \"I wondered if I mightn't be of more value to\nHaldoria in some way other than being in the combat services.\" So now\nI'd said it and there was nothing to do but to go on. \"Perhaps,\" I\nventured, \"I might be of some help in the administrative services.\"\n\nThe Accountant said nothing, his face was immobile, his hands still.\nHe'd learned his lessons well, once.\n\n\"In fact,\" I said, deciding to go for broke, \"with my knowledge of the\nlanguage and the customs here, I might be of most service to Haldoria\nright here on this planet.\"\n\n\"Had you guessed, by any chance, Trontar,\" the Accountant's voice was\nneutrally soft, \"that we won't be terraforming this world? And that we\nmay not even exploit the slavery proposition?\"\n\n\"I thought both those possibilities likely,\" I admitted.\n\n\"But you know that in such a case we would have no administrative\nservices on this world? Thus you are, in fact, asking for a position\nthat wouldn't exist.\" The Accountant, without a change of position or\nexpression, somehow gave the impression of looming over me.\n\n\"I thought,\" I said, trying to pick exactly the right words, and at the\nsame time all too conscious of a twitching muscle in my left eyelid,\n\"that there might be an analogous position, even so.\"\n\nThe Accountant loomed higher.\n\n\"If only,\" he said, \"you hadn't come to us, Trontar. I mean that you,\nin effect, sold your associates out to me. And I hold that once a\nseller, always a seller. If I could be certain that you are and will be\nperfectly loyal to the Haldorian Way....\"\n\nI managed to quiet the twitching eyelid and to look perfectly loyal to\nthe Haldorian Way.\n\n\"Yes, Trontar,\" the Accountant said decisively, \"I'll buy it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe results of my conference with the Accountant were not long in\nappearing.\n\nThe Haldorian troops were called in, along with the military governors\nand the whole administrative body, and they all shipped out, somewhere\ninto the Big Out-There they all love so much. A surprised Earth was\ninformed that she was now a full-fledged and self-governing member of\nthe Haldorian Empire. The Terrans were not informed of the economic\nfactors behind this decision, though it might have been cheering for\nthem to know that their Spanglt Resistance Quotient indicated they\nwould make unsatisfactory slaves. Nor did the high cost of terraforming\nthe planet get mentioned. We Haldorians prefer the gratitude of others\ntowards us to be unalloyed with baser, or calculating, emotions.\n\nNot all the Haldorian personnel went out to fight or to administer. I\nunderstand the space-freighter run to the battle fleet in the Slug\nGalaxy gained many new deck-hands, among them one whose uniform showed\nthe marks where Trontar's stripes had perched.\n\nAs for myself?\n\nWell, a relatively minor operation changed me into a black-skinned\nTerran, though the surgeon/replacers could do nothing, ironically\nenough in view of my new color, to increase my resistance to heat. I\nremember those stirring days of combat sometimes, usually when I am\nmaking my semi-annual flight between Churchill, Manitoba, and Tierra\nDel Fuego. In fact, during those flights when I am practically alone\nis the only time I have to reflect or remember, because on both of my\nestates there is nothing but noise, children, and wives.\n\nBut it's a good life when the snow is driving down out of a low gray\novercast, just like it does back on Haldor. It's a good life being\nResident Trader on Terra, especially when one is, on the side, a\ntrusted agent of the Accountant. It would be a perfect life--if the\nAccountant hadn't been right about people being unable to stop selling\nout.\n\nRight now I'm up to my neck in this Terran conspiracy to revolt against\nthe very light bonds Haldoria left on this planet. But how could I\nresist the tempting offer the Terrans made me? The long sought-for good\nlife, it now occurs to me, isn't so much in escaping from something,\nbut in knowing when to stop. But that I know. I'm drawing the line\nright now. I'll just tell that agent of the Slug Galaxy that I have no\nintention of selling out both this solar system _and_ Haldoria!\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Success Story, by Earl Goodale\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SUCCESS STORY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51805.txt or 51805.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/8/0/51805/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
