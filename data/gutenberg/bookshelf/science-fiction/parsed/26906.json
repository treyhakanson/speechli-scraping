JONES\n\n    _The mammoths of the ancient world have been wonderfully preserved\n    in the ice of Siberia. The cold, only a few miles out in space, will\n    be far more intense than in the polar regions and its power of\n    preserving the dead body would most probably be correspondingly\n    increased. When the hero-scientist of this story knew he must die,\n    he conceived a brilliant idea for the preservation of his body, the\n    result of which even exceeded his expectations. What, how, and why\n    are cleverly told here._\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n_The Rocket Satellite_\n\n\nIn the depths of space, some twenty thousand miles from the earth, the\nbody of Professor Jameson within its rocket container cruised upon an\nendless journey, circling the gigantic sphere. The rocket was a\nsatellite of the huge, revolving world around which it held to its\norbit. In the year 1958, Professor Jameson had sought for a plan whereby\nhe might preserve his body indefinitely after his death. He had worked\nlong and hard upon the subject.\n\nSince the time of the Pharaohs, the human race had looked for a means by\nwhich the dead might be preserved against the ravages of time. Great had\nbeen the art of the Egyptians in the embalming of their deceased, a\npractice which was later lost to humanity of the ensuing mechanical age,\nnever to be rediscovered. But even the embalming of the Egyptians--so\nProfessor Jameson had argued--would be futile in the face of millions of\nyears, the dissolution of the corpses being just as eventual as\nimmediate cremation following death.\n\nThe professor had looked for a means by which the body could be\npreserved perfectly forever. But eventually he had come to the\nconclusion that nothing on earth is unchangeable beyond a certain limit\nof time. Just as long as he sought an earthly means of preservation, he\nwas doomed to disappointment. All earthly elements are composed of atoms\nwhich are forever breaking down and building up, but never destroying\nthemselves. A match may be burned, but the atoms are still unchanged,\nhaving resolved themselves into smoke, carbon dioxide, ashes, and\ncertain basic elements. It was clear to the professor that he could\nnever accomplish his purpose if he were to employ one system of atomic\nstructure, such as embalming fluid or other concoction, to preserve\nanother system of atomic structure, such as the human body, when all\natomic structure is subject to universal change, no matter how slow.\n\n[Illustration: It glowed in a haze of light, the interior clearly\nrevealed.]\n\nHe had then soliloquized upon the possibility of preserving the human\nbody in its state of death until the end of all earthly time--to that\nday when the earth would return to the sun from which it had sprung.\nQuite suddenly one day he had conceived the answer to the puzzling\nproblem which obsessed his mind, leaving him awed with its wild, uncanny\npotentialities.\n\nHe would have his body shot into space enclosed in a rocket to become a\nsatellite of the earth as long as the earth continued to exist. He\nreasoned logically. Any material substance, whether of organic or\ninorganic origin, cast into the depths of space would exist\nindefinitely. He had visualized his dead body enclosed in a rocket\nflying off into the illimitable maw of space. He would remain in perfect\npreservation, while on earth millions of generations of mankind would\nlive and die, their bodies to molder into the dust of the forgotten\npast. He would exist in this unchanged manner until that day when\nmankind, beneath a cooling sun, should fade out forever in the chill,\nthin atmosphere of a dying world. And still his body would remain intact\nand as perfect in its rocket container as on that day of the far-gone\npast when it had left the earth to be hurled out on its career. What a\nmagnificent idea!\n\nAt first he had been assailed with doubts. Suppose his funeral rocket\nlanded upon some other planet or, drawn by the pull of the great sun,\nwere thrown into the flaming folds of the incandescent sphere? Then the\nrocket might continue on out of the solar system, plunging through the\nendless seas of space for millions of years, to finally enter the solar\nsystem of some far-off star, as meteors often enter ours. Suppose his\nrocket crashed upon a planet, or the star itself, or became a captive\nsatellite of some celestial body?\n\nIt had been at this juncture that the idea of his rocket becoming the\nsatellite of the earth had presented itself, and he had immediately\nincorporated it into his scheme. The professor had figured out the\namount of radium necessary to carry the rocket far enough away from the\nearth so that it would not turn around and crash, and still be not so\nfar away but what the earth's gravitational attraction would keep it\nfrom leaving the vicinity of the earth and the solar system. Like the\nmoon, it would forever revolve around the earth.\n\nHe had chosen an orbit sixty-five thousand miles from the earth for his\nrocket to follow. The only fears he had entertained concerned the huge\nmeteors which careened through space at tremendous rates of speed. He\nhad overcome this obstacle, however, and had eliminated the\npossibilities of a collision with these stellar juggernauts. In the\nrocket were installed radium repulsion rays which swerved all\napproaching meteors from the path of the rocket as they entered the\nvicinity of the space wanderer.\n\nThe aged professor had prepared for every contingency, and had set down\nto rest from his labors, reveling in the stupendous, unparalleled\nresults he would obtain. Never would his body undergo decay; and never\nwould his bones bleach to return to the dust of the earth from which all\nmen originally came and to which they must return. His body would remain\nmillions of years in a perfectly preserved state, untouched by the hoary\npalm of such time as only geologists and astronomers can conceive.\n\nHis efforts would surpass even the wildest dreams of H. Rider Haggard,\nwho depicted the wondrous, embalming practices of the ancient nation of\nKor in his immortal novel, \"She,\" wherein Holly, under the escort of the\nincomparable Ayesha, looked upon the magnificent, lifelike masterpieces\nof embalming by the long-gone peoples of Kor.\n\nWith the able assistance of a nephew, who carried out his instructions\nand wishes following his death, Professor Jameson was sent upon his\npilgrimage into space within the rocket he himself had built. The nephew\nand heir kept the secret forever locked in his heart.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGeneration after generation had passed upon its way. Gradually humanity\nhad come to die out, finally disappearing from the earth altogether.\nMankind was later replaced by various other forms of life which\ndominated the globe for their allotted spaces of time before they too\nbecame extinct. The years piled up on one another, running into\nmillions, and still the Jameson Satellite kept its lonely vigil around\nthe earth, gradually closing the distance between satellite and planet,\nyielding reluctantly to the latter's powerful attraction.\n\nForty million years later, its orbit ranged some twenty thousand miles\nfrom the earth while the dead world edged ever nearer the cooling sun\nwhose dull, red ball covered a large expanse of the sky. Surrounding\nthe flaming sphere, many of the stars could be perceived through the\nearth's thin, rarefied atmosphere. As the earth cut in slowly and\ngradually toward the solar luminary, so was the moon revolving ever\nnearer the earth, appearing like a great gem glowing in the twilight\nsky.\n\nThe rocket containing the remains of Professor Jameson continued its\nendless travel around the great ball of the earth whose rotation had now\nceased entirely--one side forever facing the dying sun. There it pursued\nits lonely way, a cosmic coffin, accompanied by its funeral cortege of\nscintillating stars amid the deep silence of the eternal space which\nenshrouded it. Solitary it remained, except for the occasional passing\nof a meteor flitting by at a remarkable speed on its aimless journey\nthrough the vacuum between the far-flung worlds.\n\nWould the satellite follow its orbit to the world's end, or would its\nsupply of radium soon exhaust itself after so many eons of time,\nconverting the rocket into the prey of the first large meteor which\nchanced that way? Would it some day return to the earth as its nearer\napproach portended, and increase its acceleration in a long arc to crash\nupon the surface of the dead planet? And when the rocket terminated its\ncareer, would the body of Professor Jameson be found perfectly preserved\nor merely a crumbled mound of dust?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n_40,000,000 Years After_\n\n\nEntering within the boundaries of the solar system, a long, dark,\npointed craft sped across the realms of space towards the tiny point of\nlight which marked the dull red ball of the dying sun which would some\nday lie cold and dark forever. Like a huge meteor it flashed into the\nsolar system from another chain of planets far out in the illimitable\nUniverse of stars and worlds, heading towards the great red sun at an\ninconceivable speed.\n\nWithin the interior of the space traveler, queer creatures of metal\nlabored at the controls of the space flyer which juggernauted on its way\ntowards the far-off solar luminary. Rapidly it crossed the orbits of\nNeptune and Uranus and headed sunward. The bodies of these queer\ncreatures were square blocks of a metal closely resembling steel, while\nfor appendages, the metal cube was upheld by four jointed legs capable\nof movement. A set of six tentacles, all metal, like the rest of the\nbody, curved outward from the upper half of the cubic body. Surmounting\nit was a queer-shaped head rising to a peak in the center and equipped\nwith a circle of eyes all the way around the head. The creatures, with\ntheir mechanical eyes equipped with metal shutters, could see in all\ndirections. A single eye pointed directly upward, being situated in the\nspace of the peaked head, resting in a slight depression of the cranium.\n\nThese were the Zoromes of the planet Zor which rotated on its way around\na star millions of light years distant from our solar system. The\nZoromes, several hundred thousand years before, had reached a stage in\nscience, where they searched for immortality and eternal relief from\nbodily ills and various deficiencies of flesh and blood anatomy. They\nhad sought freedom from death, and had found it, but at the same time\nthey had destroyed the propensities for birth. And for several hundred\nthousand years there had been no births and few deaths in the history of\nthe Zoromes.\n\nThis strange race of people had built their own mechanical bodies, and\nby operation upon one another had removed their brains to the metal\nheads from which they directed the functions and movements of their\ninorganic anatomies. There had been no deaths due to worn-out bodies.\nWhen one part of the mechanical men wore out, it was replaced by a new\npart, and so the Zoromes continued living their immortal lives which saw\nfew casualties. It was true that, since the innovation of the machines,\nthere had been a few accidents which had seen the destruction of the\nmetal heads with their brains. These were irreparable. Such cases had\nbeen few, however, and the population of Zor had decreased but little.\nThe machine men of Zor had no use for atmosphere, and had it not been\nfor the terrible coldness of space, could have just as well existed in\nthe ether void as upon some planet. Their metal bodies, especially their\nmetal-encased brains, did require a certain amount of heat even though\nthey were able to exist comfortably in temperatures which would\ninstantly have frozen to death a flesh-and-blood creature.\n\nThe most popular pastime among the machine men of Zor was the\nexploration of the Universe. This afforded them a never ending source of\ninterest in the discovery of the variegated inhabitants and conditions\nof the various planets on which they came to rest. Hundreds of space\nships were sent out in all directions, many of them being upon their\nexpeditions for hundreds of years before they returned once more to the\nhome planet of far-off Zor.\n\nThis particular space craft of the Zoromes had entered the solar system\nwhose planets were gradually circling in closer to the dull red ball of\nthe declining sun. Several of the machine men of the space craft's crew,\nwhich numbered some fifty individuals, were examining the various\nplanets of this particular planetary system carefully through telescopes\npossessing immense power.\n\nThese machine men had no names and were indexed according to letters and\nnumbers. They conversed by means of thought impulses, and were neither\ncapable of making a sound vocally nor of hearing one uttered.\n\n\"Where shall we go?\" queried one of the men at the controls questioning\nanother who stood by his side examining a chart on the wall.\n\n\"They all appear to be dead worlds, 4R-3579,\" replied the one addressed,\n\"but the second planet from the sun appears to have an atmosphere which\nmight sustain a few living creatures, and the third planet may also\nprove interesting for it has a satellite. We shall examine the inner\nplanets first of all, and explore the outer ones later if we decide it\nis worth the time.\"\n\n\"Too much trouble for nothing,\" ventured 9G-721. \"This system of planets\noffers us little but what we have seen many times before in our travels.\nThe sun is so cooled that it cannot sustain the more common life on its\nplanets, the type of life forms we usually find in our travels. We\nshould have visited a planetary system with a brighter sun.\"\n\n\"You speak of common life,\" remarked 25X-987. \"What of the uncommon\nlife? Have we not found life existent on cold, dead planets with no\nsunlight and atmosphere at all?\"\n\n\"Yes, we have,\" admitted 9G-721, \"but such occasions are exceedingly\nrare.\"\n\n\"The possibility exists, however, even in this case,\" reminded 4R-3579,\n\"and what if we do spend a bit of unprofitable time in this one\nplanetary system--haven't we all an endless lifetime before us? Eternity\nis ours.\"\n\n\"We shall visit the second planet first of all,\" directed 25X-987, who\nwas in charge of this particular expedition of the Zoromes, \"and on the\nway there we shall cruise along near the third planet to see what we can\nof the surface. We may be able to tell whether or not it holds anything\nof interest to us. If it does, after visiting the second planet, we\nshall then return to the third. The first world is not worth bothering\nwith.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe space ship from Zor raced on in a direction which would take it\nseveral thousand miles above the earth and then on to the planet which\nwe know as Venus. As the space ship rapidly neared the earth, it\nslackened its speed, so that the Zoromes might examine it closely with\ntheir glasses as the ship passed the third planet.\n\nSuddenly, one of the machine men ran excitedly into the room where\n25X-987 stood watching the topography of the world beneath him.\n\n\"We have found something!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Another space ship!\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"But a short distance ahead of us on our course. Come into the foreport\nof the ship and you can pick it up with the glass.\"\n\n\"Which is the way it's going?\" asked 25X-987.\n\n\"It is behaving queerly,\" replied the machine man of Zor. \"It appears to\nbe in the act of circling the planet.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose that there really is life on that dead\nworld--intelligent beings like ourselves, and that this is one of their\nspace craft?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is another exploration craft like our own from some other\nworld,\" was the suggestion.\n\n\"But not of ours,\" said 25X-987.\n\nTogether, the two Zoromes now hastened into the observation room of the\nspace ship where more of the machine men were excitedly examining the\nmysterious space craft, their thought impulses flying thick and fast\nlike bodiless bullets.\n\n\"It is very small!\"\n\n\"Its speed is slow!\"\n\n\"The craft can hold but few men,\" observed one.\n\n\"We do not yet know of what size the creatures are,\" reminded another.\n\"Perhaps there are thousands of them in that space craft out there. They\nmay be of such a small size that it will be necessary to look twice\nbefore finding one of them. Such beings are not unknown.\"\n\n\"We shall soon overtake it and see.\"\n\n\"I wonder if they have seen us?\"\n\n\"Where do you suppose it came from?\"\n\n\"From the world beneath us,\" was the suggestion.\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n_The Mysterious Space Craft_\n\n\nThe machine men made way for their leader, 25X-987, who regarded the\nspace craft ahead of them critically.\n\n\"Have you tried communicating with it yet?\" he asked.\n\n\"There is no reply to any of our signals,\" came the answer.\n\n\"Come alongside of it then,\" ordered their commander. \"It is small\nenough to be brought inside our carrying compartment, and we can see\nwith our penetration rays just what manner of creatures it holds. They\nare intelligent, that is certain, for their space ship does imply as\nmuch.\"\n\nThe space flyer of the Zoromes slowed up as it approached the mysterious\nwanderer of the cosmic void which hovered in the vicinity of the dying\nworld.\n\n\"What a queer shape it has,\" remarked 25X-987. \"It is even smaller than\nI had previously calculated.\"\n\nA rare occurrence had taken place among the machine men of Zor. They\nwere overcome by a great curiosity which they could not allow to remain\nunsatiated. Accustomed as they were to witnessing strange sights and\nstill stranger creatures, meeting up with weird adventures in various\ncorners of the Universe, they had now become hardened to the usual run\nof experiences which they were in the habit of encountering. It took a\ngreat deal to arouse their unperturbed attitudes. Something new,\nhowever, about this queer space craft had gripped their imaginations,\nand perhaps a subconscious influence asserted to their minds that here\nthey have come across an adventure radically unusual.\n\n\"Come alongside it,\" repeated 25X-987 to the operator as he returned to\nthe control room and gazed through the side of the space ship in the\ndirection of the smaller cosmic wanderer.\n\n\"I'm trying to,\" replied the machine man, \"but it seems to jump away a\nbit every time I get within a certain distance of it. Our ship seems to\njump backward a bit too.\"\n\n\"Are they trying to elude us?\"\n\n\"I don't know. They should pick up more speed if that is their object.\"\n\n\"Perhaps they are now progressing at their maximum speed and cannot\nincrease their acceleration any more.\"\n\n\"Look!\" exclaimed the operator. \"Did you just see that? The thing has\njumped away from us again!\"\n\n\"Our ship moved also,\" said 25X-987. \"I saw a flash of light shoot from\nthe side of the other craft as it jumped.\"\n\nAnother machine man now entered and spoke to the commander of the Zorome\nexpedition.\n\n\"They are using radium repellent rays to keep us from approaching,\" he\ninformed.\n\n\"Counteract it,\" instructed 25X-987.\n\nThe man left, and now the machine man at the controls of the craft tried\nagain to close with the mysterious wanderer of the space between\nplanets. The effort was successful, and this time there was no glow of\nrepulsion rays from the side of the long metal cylinder.\n\nThey now entered the compartment where various objects were transferred\nfrom out the depths of space to the interplanetary craft. Then patiently\nthey waited for the rest of the machine men to open the side of their\nspace ship and bring in the queer, elongated cylinder.\n\n\"Put it under the penetration ray!\" ordered 25X-987. \"Then we shall see\nwhat it contains!\"\n\nThe entire group of Zoromes were assembled about the long cylinder,\nwhose low nickel-plated sides shone brilliantly. With interest they\nregarded the fifteen-foot object which tapered a bit towards its base.\nThe nose was pointed like a bullet. Eight cylindrical protuberances were\naffixed to the base while the four sides were equipped with fins such as\nare seen on aerial bombs to guide them in a direct, unswerving line\nthrough the atmosphere. At the base of the strange craft there projected\na lever, while in one side was a door which, apparently opened outward.\nOne of the machine men reached forward to open it but was halted by the\nadmonition of the commander.\n\n\"Do not open it up yet!\" he warned. \"We are not aware of what it\ncontains!\"\n\nGuided by the hand of one of the machine men, a series of lights shone\ndown upon the cylinder. It became enveloped in a haze of light which\nrendered the metal sides of the mysterious space craft dim and\nindistinct while the interior of the cylinder was as clearly revealed as\nif there had been no covering. The machine men, expecting to see at\nleast several, perhaps many, strange creatures moving about within the\nmetal cylinder, stared aghast at the sight they beheld. There was but\none creature, and he was lying perfectly still, either in a state of\nsuspended animation or else of death. He was about twice the height of\nthe mechanical men of Zor. For a long time they gazed at him in a\nsilence of thought, and then their leader instructed them.\n\n\"Take him out of the container.\"\n\nThe penetration rays were turned off, and two of the machine men stepped\neagerly forward and opened the door. One of them peered within at the\nrecumbent body of the weird-looking individual with the four appendages.\nThe creature lay up against a luxuriously upholstered interior, a strap\naffixed to his chin while four more straps held both the upper and lower\nappendages securely to the insides of the cylinder. The machine man\nreleased these, and with the help of his comrade removed the body of the\ncreature from the cosmic coffin in which they had found it.\n\n\"He is dead!\" pronounced one of the machine men after a long and careful\nexamination of the corpse. \"He has been like this for a long time.\"\n\n\"There are strange thought impressions left upon his mind,\" remarked\nanother.\n\nOne of the machine men, whose metal body was of a different shade than\nthat of his companions, stepped forward, his cubic body bent over that\nof the strange, cold creature who was garbed in fantastic accoutrements.\nHe examined the dead organism a moment, and then he turned to his\ncompanions.\n\n\"Would you like to hear his story?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes!\" came the concerted reply.\n\n\"You shall, then,\" was the ultimatum. \"Bring him into my laboratory. I\nshall remove his brain and stimulate the cells into activity once more.\nWe shall give him life again, transplanting his brain into the head of\none of our machines.\"\n\nWith these words he directed two of the Zoromes to carry the corpse into\nthe laboratory.\n\nAs the space ship cruised about in the vicinity of this third planet\nwhich 25X-987 had decided to visit on finding the metal cylinder with\nits queer inhabitant, 8B-52, the experimenter, worked unceasingly in his\nlaboratory to revive the long-dead brain cells to action once more.\nFinally, after consummating his desires and having his efforts crowned\nwith success, he placed the brain within the head of a machine. The\nbrain was brought to consciousness. The creature's body was discarded\nafter the all-important brain had been removed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n_Recalled to Life_\n\n\nAs Professor Jameson came to, he became aware of a strange feeling. He\nwas sick. The doctors had not expected him to live; they had frankly\ntold him so--but he had cared little in view of the long, happy years\nstretched out behind him. Perhaps he was not to die yet. He wondered how\nlong he had slept. How strange he felt--as if he had no body. Why\ncouldn't he open his eyes? He tried very hard. A mist swam before him.\nHis eyes had been open all the time but he had not seen before. That was\nqueer, he ruminated. All was silent about his bedside. Had all the\ndoctors and nurses left him to sleep--or to die?\n\nDevil take that mist which now swam before him, obscuring everything in\nline of vision. He would call his nephew. Vainly he attempted to shout\nthe word \"Douglas,\" but to no avail. Where was his mouth? It seemed as\nif he had none. Was it all delirium? The strange silence--perhaps he had\nlost his sense of hearing along with his ability to speak--and he could\nsee nothing distinctly. The mist had transferred itself into a confused\njumble of indistinct objects, some of which moved about before him.\n\nHe was now conscious of some impulse in his mind which kept questioning\nhim as to how he felt. He was conscious of other strange ideas which\nseemed to be impressed upon his brain, but this one thought concerning\nhis indisposition clamored insistently over the lesser ideas. It even\nseemed just as if someone was addressing him, and impulsively he\nattempted to utter a sound and tell them how queer he felt. It seemed as\nif speech had been taken from him. He could not talk, no matter how hard\nhe tried. It was no use. Strange to say, however, the impulse within his\nmind appeared to be satisfied with the effort, and it now put another\nquestion to him. Where was he from? What a strange question--when he was\nat home. He told them as much. Had he always lived there? Why, yes, of\ncourse.\n\nThe aged professor was now becoming more astute as to his condition. At\nfirst it was only a mild, passive wonderment at his helplessness and the\nstrange thoughts which raced through his mind. Now he attempted to\narouse himself from the lethargy.\n\nQuite suddenly his sight cleared, and what a surprise! He could see all\nthe way around him without moving his head! And he could look at the\nceiling of his room! His room? Was it his room! No-- It just couldn't\nbe. Where was he? What were those queer machines before him? They moved\non four legs. Six tentacles curled outward from their cubical bodies.\nOne of the machines stood close before him. A tentacle shot out from the\nobject and rubbed his head. How strange it felt upon his brow.\nInstinctively he obeyed the impulse to shove the contraption of metal\nfrom him with his hands.\n\nHis arms did not rise, instead six tentacles projected upward to force\nback the machine. Professor Jameson gasped mentally in surprise as he\ngazed at the result of his urge to push the strange, unearthly looking\nmachine-caricature from him. With trepidation he looked down at his own\nbody to see where the tentacles had come from, and his surprise turned\nto sheer fright and amazement. His body was like the moving machine\nwhich stood before him! Where was he? What ever had happened to him so\nsuddenly? Only a few moments ago he had been in his bed, with the\ndoctors and his nephew bending over him, expecting him to die. The last\nwords he had remembered hearing was the cryptic announcement of one of\nthe doctors.\n\n\"He is going now.\"\n\nBut he hadn't died after all, apparently. A horrible thought struck him!\nWas this the life after death? Or was it an illusion of the mind? He\nbecame aware that the machine in front of him was attempting to\ncommunicate something to him. How could it, thought the professor, when\nhe had no mouth. The desire to communicate an idea to him became more\ninsistent. The suggestion of the machine man's question was in his mind.\nTelepathy, thought he.\n\nThe creature was asking about the place whence he had come. He didn't\nknow; his mind was in such a turmoil of thoughts and conflicting ideas.\nHe allowed himself to be led to a window where the machine with waving\ntentacle pointed towards an object outside. It was a queer sensation to\nbe walking on the four metal legs. He looked from the window and he saw\nthat which caused him to nearly drop over, so astounded was he.\n\nThe professor found himself gazing out from the boundless depths of\nspace across the cosmic void to where a huge planet lay quiet. Now he\nwas sure it was an illusion which made his mind and sight behave so\nqueerly. He was troubled by a very strange dream. Carefully he examined\nthe topography of the gigantic globe which rested off in the distance.\nAt the same time he could see back of him the concourse of mechanical\ncreatures crowding up behind him, and he was aware of a telepathic\nconversation which was being carried on behind him--or just before him.\nWhich was it now? Eyes extended all the way around his head, while there\nexisted no difference on any of the four sides of his cubed body. His\nmechanical legs were capable of moving in any of four given directions\nwith perfect ease, he discovered.\n\nThe planet was not the earth--of that he was sure. None of the familiar\ncontinents lay before his eyes. And then he saw the great dull red ball\nof the dying sun. That was not the sun of his earth. It had been a great\ndeal more brilliant.\n\n\"Did you come from that planet?\" came the thought impulse from the\nmechanism by his side.\n\n\"No,\" he returned.\n\nHe then allowed the machine men--for he assumed that they were machine\nmen, and he reasoned that, somehow or other they had by some marvelous\ntransformation made him over just as they were--to lead him through the\ncraft of which he now took notice for the first time. It was an\ninterplanetary flyer, or space ship, he firmly believed.\n\n25X-987 now took him to the compartment which they had removed him to\nfrom the strange container they had found wandering in the vicinity of\nthe nearby world. There they showed him the long cylinder.\n\n\"It's my rocket satellite!\" exclaimed Professor Jameson to himself,\nthough in reality every one of the machine men received his thoughts\nplainly. \"What is it doing here?\"\n\n\"We found your dead body within it,\" answered 25X-987. \"Your brain was\nremoved to the machine after having been stimulated into activity once\nmore. Your carcass was thrown away.\"\n\nProfessor Jameson just stood dumfounded by the words of the machine man.\n\n\"So I did die!\" exclaimed the professor. \"And my body was placed within\nthe rocket to remain in everlasting preservation until the end of all\nearthly time! Success! I have now attained unrivaled success!\"\n\nHe then turned to the machine man.\n\n\"How long have I been that way?\" he asked excitedly.\n\n\"How should we know?\" replied the Zorome. \"We picked up your rocket only\na short time ago, which, according to your computation, would be less\nthan a day. This is our first visit to your planetary system and we\nchanced upon your rocket. So it is a satellite? We didn't watch it long\nenough to discover whether or not it was a satellite. At first we\nthought it to be another traveling space craft, but when it refused to\nanswer our signals we investigated.\"\n\n\"And so that was the earth at which I looked,\" mused the professor. \"No\nwonder I didn't recognize it. The topography has changed so much. How\ndifferent the sun appears--it must have been over a million years ago\nwhen I died!\"\n\n\"Many millions,\" corrected 25X-987. \"Suns of such size as this one do\nnot cool in so short a time as you suggest.\"\n\nProfessor Jameson, in spite of all his amazing computations before his\ndeath, was staggered by the reality.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he suddenly asked.\n\n\"We are the Zoromes from Zor, a planet of a sun far across the\nUniverse.\"\n\n25X-987 then went on to tell Professor Jameson something about how the\nZoromes had attained their high stage of development and had instantly\nput a stop to all birth, evolution and death of their people, by\nbecoming machine men.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n_The Dying World_\n\n\n\"And now tell us of yourself,\" said 25X-987, \"and about your world.\"\n\nProfessor Jameson, noted in college as a lecturer of no mean ability and\nperfectly capable of relating intelligently to them the story of the\nearth's history, evolution and march of events following the birth of\ncivilization up until the time when he died, began his story. The mental\nspeech hampered him for a time, but he soon became accustomed to it so\nas to use it easily, and he found it preferable to vocal speech after a\nwhile. The Zoromes listened interestedly to the long account until\nProfessor Jameson had finished.\n\n\"My nephew,\" concluded the professor, \"evidently obeyed my instructions\nand placed my body in the rocket I had built, shooting it out into space\nwhere I became the satellite of the earth for these many millions of\nyears.\"\n\n\"Do you really want to know how long you were dead before we found you?\"\nasked 25X-987. \"It would be interesting to find out.\"\n\n\"Yes, I should like very much to know,\" replied the professor.\n\n\"Our greatest mathematician, 459C-79, will tell it to you.\" The\nmathematician stepped forward. Upon one side of his cube were many\nbuttons arranged in long columns and squares.\n\n\"What is your unit of measuring?\" he asked.\n\n\"A mile.\"\n\n\"How many times more is a mile than is the length of your rocket\nsatellite?\"\n\n\"My rocket is fifteen feet long. A mile is five thousand two hundred and\neighty feet.\"\n\nThe mathematician depressed a few buttons.\n\n\"How far, or how many miles from the sun was your planet at that time?\"\n\n\"Ninety-three million miles,\" was the reply.\n\n\"And your world's satellite--which you call moon from your\nplanet--earth?\"\n\n\"Two hundred and forty thousand miles.\"\n\n\"And your rocket?\"\n\n\"I figured it to go about sixty-five thousand miles from the earth.\"\n\n\"It was only twenty thousand miles from the earth when we picked it up,\"\nsaid the mathematician, depressing a few more buttons. \"The moon and\nsun are also much nearer your planet now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nProfessor Jameson gave way to a mental ejaculation of amazement.\n\n\"Do you know how long you have cruised around the planet in your own\nsatellite?\" said the mathematician. \"Since you began that journey, the\nplanet which you call the earth has revolved around the sun over forty\nmillion times.\"\n\n\"Forty--million--years!\" exclaimed Professor Jameson haltingly.\n\"Humanity must then have all perished from the earth long ago! I'm the\nlast man on earth!\"\n\n\"It is a dead world now,\" interjected 25X-987.\n\n\"Of course,\" elucidated the mathematician, \"those last few million years\nare much shorter than the ones in which you lived. The earth's orbit is\nof less diameter and its speed of revolution is greatly increased, due\nto its proximity to the cooling sun. I should say that your year was\nsome four times as long as the time in which it now takes your old\nplanet to circumnavigate the sun.\n\n\"How many days were there in your year?\"\n\n\"Three hundred and sixty-five.\"\n\n\"The planet has now ceased rotating entirely.\"\n\n\"Seems queer that your rocket satellite should avoid the meteors so\nlong,\" observed 459C-79, the mathematician.\n\n\"Automatic radium repulsion rays,\" explained the professor.\n\n\"The very rays which kept us from approaching your rocket,\" stated\n25X-987, \"until we neutralized them.\"\n\n\"You died and were shot out into space long before any life occurred on\nZor,\" soliloquized one of the machine men. \"Our people had not yet even\nbeen born when yours had probably disappeared entirely from the face of\nthe earth.\"\n\n\"Hearken to 72N-4783,\" said 25X-987, \"he is our philosopher, and he just\nloves to dwell on the past life of Zor when we were flesh and blood\ncreatures with the threat of death hanging always over our heads. At\nthat time, like the life you knew, we were born, we lived and died, all\nwithin a very short time, comparatively.\"\n\n\"Of course, time has come to mean nothing to us, especially when we are\nout in space,\" observed 72N-4783. \"We never keep track of it on our\nexpeditions, though back in Zor such accounts are accurately kept. By\nthe way, do you know how long we stood here while you recounted to us\nthe history of your planet? Our machine bodies never get tired, you\nknow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well,\" ruminated Professor Jameson, giving a generous allowance of\ntime. \"I should say about a half a day, although it seemed scarcely as\nlong as that.\"\n\n\"We listened to you for four days,\" replied 72N-4783.\n\nProfessor Jameson was really aghast.\n\n\"Really, I hadn't meant to be such a bore,\" he apologized.\n\n\"That is nothing,\" replied the other. \"Your story was interesting, and\nif it had been twice as long, it would not have mattered, nor would it\nhave seemed any longer. Time is merely relative, and in space actual\ntime does not exist at all, any more than your forty million years'\ncessation of life seemed more than a few moments to you. We saw that it\nwas so when your first thought impressions reached us following your\nrevival.\"\n\n\"Let us continue on to your planet earth,\" then said 25X-987. \"Perhaps\nwe shall find more startling disclosures there.\"\n\nAs the space ship of the Zoromes approached the sphere from which\nProfessor Jameson had been hurled in his rocket forty million years\nbefore, the professor was wondering how the earth would appear, and what\nradical changes he would find. Already he knew that the geographical\nconditions of the various continents were changed. He had seen as much\nfrom the space ship.\n\nA short time later the earth was reached. The space travelers from Zor,\nas well as Professor Jameson, emerged from the cosmic flyer to walk upon\nthe surface of the planet. The earth had ceased rotating, leaving\none-half its surface always toward the sun. This side of the earth was\nheated to a considerable degree, while its antipodes, turned always away\nfrom the solar luminary, was a cold, frigid, desolate waste. The space\ntravelers from Zor did not dare to advance very far into either\nhemisphere, but landed on the narrow, thousand-mile strip of territory\nseparating the earth's frozen half from its sun-baked antipodes.\n\nAs Professor Jameson emerged from the space ship with 25X-987, he stared\nin awe at the great transformation four hundred thousand centuries had\nwrought. The earth's surface, its sky and the sun were all so changed\nand unearthly appearing. Off to the east the blood red ball of the\nslowly cooling sun rested upon the horizon, lighting up the eternal day.\nThe earth's rotation had ceased entirely, and it hung motionless in the\nsky as it revolved around its solar parent, its orbit slowly but surely\ncutting in toward the great body of the sun. The two inner planets,\nMercury and Venus, were now very close to the blood red orb whose\nscintillating, dazzling brilliance had been lost in its cooling process.\nSoon, the two nearer planets would succumb to the great pull of the\nsolar luminary and return to the flaming folds, from which they had been\nhurled out as gaseous bodies in the dim, age-old past, when their\ncareers had just begun.\n\nThe atmosphere was nearly gone, so rarefied had it become, and through\nit Professor Jameson could view with amazing clarity without discomfort\nto his eyes the bloated body of the dying sun. It appeared many times\nthe size he had seen it at the time of his death, on account of its\nrelative nearness. The earth had advanced a great deal closer to the\ngreat star around which it swung.\n\nThe sky towards the west was pitch black except for the iridescent\ntwinkle of the fiery stars which studded that section of the heavens. As\nhe watched, a faint glow suffused the western sky, gradually growing\nbrighter, the full moon majestically lifted itself above the horizon,\ncasting its pale, ethereal radiance upon the dying world beneath. It was\nincreased to many times the size Professor Jameson had ever seen it\nduring his natural lifetime. The earth's greater attraction was drawing\nupon the moon just as the sun was pulling the earth ever nearer itself.\n\nThis cheerless landscape confronting the professor represented the state\nof existence to which the earth had come. It was a magnificent spread of\nloneliness which bore no witness to the fact that it had seen the\nteeming of life in better ages long ago. The weird, yet beautiful scene,\nspread in a melancholy panorama before his eyes, drove his thoughts into\ngloomy abstraction with its dismal, depressing influence. Its funereal,\noppressive aspect smote him suddenly with the chill of a terrible\nloneliness.\n\n25X-987 aroused Professor Jameson from his lethargic reverie. \"Let us\nwalk around and see what we can find. I can understand how you feel in\nregard to the past. It is quite a shock--but it must happen to all\nworlds sooner or later--even to Zor. When that time comes, the Zoromes\nwill find a new planet on which to live. If you travel with us, you will\nbecome accustomed to the sight of seeing dead, lifeless worlds as well\nas new and beautiful ones pulsating with life and energy. Of course,\nthis world being your own, holds a peculiar sentimental value to you,\nbut it is really one planet among billions.\"\n\nProfessor Jameson was silent.\n\n\"I wonder whether or not there are any ruins here to be found?\" queried\n25X-987.\n\n\"I don't believe so,\" replied the professor. \"I remember hearing an\neminent scientist of my day state that, given fifty thousand years,\nevery structure and other creation of man would be obliterated entirely\nfrom off the earth's surface.\"\n\n\"And he was right,\" endorsed the machine man of Zor. \"Time is a great\neffacer.\"\n\nFor a long time the machine men wandered over the dreary surface of the\nearth, and then 25X-987 suggested a change of territory to explore. In\nthe space ship, they moved around the earth to the other side, still\nkeeping to the belt of shadowland which completely encircled the globe\nlike some gigantic ring. Where they now landed arose a series of cones\nwith hollow peaks.\n\n\"Volcanoes!\" exclaimed the professor.\n\n\"Extinct ones,\" added the machine man.\n\nLeaving the space ship, the fifty or more machine men, including also\nProfessor Jameson, were soon exploring the curiously shaped peaks. The\nprofessor, in his wanderings had strayed away from the rest, and now\nadvanced into one of the cup-like depressions of the peak, out of sight\nof his companions, the Zoromes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n_Eternity or Death_\n\n\nHe was well in the center of the cavity when the soft ground beneath him\ngave way suddenly and he catapulted below into the darkness. Through the\nStygian gloom he fell in what seemed to be an endless drop. He finally\ncrashed upon something hard. The thin crust of the volcano's mouth had\nbroken through, precipitating him into the deep, hollow interior.\n\nIt must have been a long ways to fall--or so it had seemed. Why was he\nnot knocked senseless or killed? Then he felt himself over with three\ntentacles. His metal legs were four broken, twisted masses of metal,\nwhile the lower half of his cubic body was jammed out of shape and\nsplit. He could not move, and half of his six tentacles were paralyzed.\n\nHow would he ever get out of there? he wondered. The machine men of Zor\nmight never find him. What would happen to him, then? He would remain in\nthis deathless, monotonous state forever in the black hole of the\nvolcano's interior unable to move. What a horrible thought! He could not\nstarve to death; eating was unknown among the Zoromes, the machines\nrequiring no food. He could not even commit suicide. The only way for\nhim to die would be to smash the strong metal head, and in his present\nimmovable condition, this was impossible.\n\nIt suddenly occurred to him to radiate thoughts for help. Would the\nZoromes receive his messages? He wondered how far the telepathic\nmessages would carry. He concentrated the powers of his mind upon the\ncall for help, and repeatedly stated his position and plight. He then\nleft his mind clear to receive the thought answers of the Zoromes. He\nreceived none. Again he tried. Still he received no welcoming answer.\nProfessor Jameson became dejected.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was hopeless. The telepathic messages had not reached the machine men\nof Zor. They were too far away, just as one person may be out of earshot\nof another's voice. He was doomed to a terrible fate of existence! It\nwere better that his rocket had never been found. He wished that the\nZoromes had destroyed him instead of bringing him back to life--back to\nthis!\n\nHis thoughts were suddenly broken in upon.\n\n\"We're coming!\"\n\n\"Don't give up hope!\"\n\nIf the professor's machine body had been equipped with a heart, it would\nhave sung for joy at these welcome thought impressions. A short time\nlater there appeared in the ragged break of the volcano's mouth, where\nhe had fallen through, the metal head of one of the machine men.\n\n\"We shall have you out of there soon,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe professor never knew how they managed it for he lost consciousness\nunder some strange ray of light they projected down upon him in his\nprison. When he came to consciousness once more, it was to find himself\ninside the space ship.\n\n\"If you had fallen and had smashed your head, it would have been all\nover with you,\" were the first thought impulses which greeted him. \"As\nit is, however, we can fix you up first rate.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you answer the first time I called to you?\" asked the\nprofessor. \"Didn't you hear me?\"\n\n\"We heard you, and we answered, but you didn't hear us. You see, your\nbrain is different than ours, and though you can send thought waves as\nfar as we can you cannot receive them from such a great distance.\"\n\n\"I'm wrecked,\" said the professor, gazing at his twisted limbs,\nparalyzed tentacles and jammed body.\n\n\"We shall repair you,\" came the reply. \"It is your good fortune that\nyour head was not crushed.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do with me?\" queried the professor. \"Will you\nremove my brains to another machine?\"\n\n\"No, it isn't necessary. We shall merely remove your head and place it\nupon another machine body.\"\n\nThe Zoromes immediately set to work upon the task, and soon had\nProfessor Jameson's metal head removed from the machine which he had\nwrecked in his fall down the crater. All during the painless operation,\nthe professor kept up a series of thought exchanges in conversation with\nthe Zoromes, and it seemed but a short time before his head surmounted a\nnew machine and he was ready for further exploration. In the course of\nhis operation, the space ship had moved to a new position, and now as\nthey emerged 25X-987 kept company with Professor Jameson.\n\n\"I must keep an eye on you,\" he said. \"You will be getting into more\ntrouble before you get accustomed to the metal bodies.\"\n\nBut Professor Jameson was doing a great deal of thinking. Doubtlessly,\nthese strange machine men who had picked up his rocket in the depths of\nspace and had brought him back to life, were expecting him to travel\nwith them and become adopted into the ranks of the Zoromes. Did he want\nto go with them? He couldn't decide. He had forgotten that the machine\nmen could read his innermost thoughts.\n\n\"You wish to remain here alone upon the earth?\" asked 25X-987. \"It is\nyour privilege if you really want it so.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Professor Jameson truthfully.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe gazed at the dust around his feet. It had probably been the\ncomposition of men, and had changed from time to time into various other\natomic structures--of other queer forms of life which had succeeded\nmankind. It was the law of the atom which never died. And now he had\nwithin his power perpetual existence. He could be immortal if he wished!\nIt would be an immortality of never-ending adventures in the vast,\nendless Universe among the galaxy of stars and planets.\n\nA great loneliness seized him. Would he be happy among these machine men\nof another far-off world--among these Zoromes? They were kindly and\nsolicitous of his welfare. What better fate could he expect? Still, a\nlonging for his own kind arose in him--the call of humanity. It was\nirresistible. What could he do? Was it not in vain? Humanity had long\nsince disappeared from the earth--millions of years ago. He wondered\nwhat lay beyond the pales of death--the real death, where the body\ndecomposed and wasted away to return to the dust of the earth and assume\nnew atomic structures.\n\nHe had begun to wonder whether or not he had been dead all these forty\nmillions of years--suppose he had been merely in a state of suspended\nanimation. He had remembered a scientist of his day, who had claimed\nthat the body does not die at the point of official death. According to\nthe claims of this man, the cells of the body did not die at the moment\nat which respiration, heart beats and the blood circulation ceased, but\nit existed in the semblance of life for several days afterward,\nespecially in the cells of the bones, which died last of all.\n\nPerhaps when he had been sent out into space in his rocket right after\nhis death, the action of the cosmic void was to halt his slow death of\nthe cells in his body, and hold him in suspended animation during the\nensuing millions of years. Suppose he should really die--destroying his\nown brain? What lay beyond real death? Would it be a better plane of\nexistence than the Zoromes could offer him? Would he rediscover\nhumanity, or had they long since arisen to higher planes of existence or\nreincarnation? Did time exist beyond the mysterious portals of death? If\nnot, then it was possible for him to join the souls of the human race.\nHad he really been dead all this time? If so, he knew what to expect in\ncase he really destroyed his own brain. Oblivion!\n\nAgain the intense feeling of loneliness surged over him and held him\nwithin its melancholy grasp. Desperately, he decided to find the nearest\ncliff and jump from it--head-first! Humanity called; no man lived to\ncompanion him. His four metal limbs carried him swiftly to the summit of\na nearby precipice. Why not gamble on the hereafter? 25X-987,\nunderstanding his trend of thought, did not attempt to restrain him.\nInstead, the machine man of Zor waited patiently.\n\nAs Professor Jameson stood there meditating upon the jump which would\nhurl him now into a new plane of existence--or into oblivion, the\nthought transference of 25X-987 reached him. It was laden with the\nwisdom born of many planets and thousands of centuries' experience.\n\n\"Why jump?\" asked the machine man. \"The dying world holds your\nimagination within a morbid clutch. It is all a matter of mental\ncondition. Free your mind of this fascinating influence and come with us\nto visit other worlds, many of them are both beautiful and new. You will\nthen feel a great difference.\n\n\"Will you come?\"\n\nThe professor considered for a moment as he resisted the impulse to dive\noff the declivity to the enticing rocks far below. An inspiration seized\nhim. Backing away from the edge of the cliff, he joined 25X-987 once\nmore.\n\n\"I shall come,\" he stated.\n\nHe would become an immortal after all and join the Zoromes in their\nnever-ending adventures from world to world. They hastened to the space\nship to escape the depressing, dreary influence of the dying world,\nwhich had nearly driven Professor Jameson to take the fatal leap to\noblivion.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ April 1956 and was\n    first published in _Amazing Stories_ July 1931.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
