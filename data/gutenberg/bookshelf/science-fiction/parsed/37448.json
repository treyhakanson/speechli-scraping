GALLUN\n\n\nOutside Tycho Station on the Moon, Jess Brinker showed Arne Copeland the\nodd footprints made in the dust by explorers from Mars, fifty million\nyears ago. A man-made cover of clear plastic now kept them from being\ntrampled.\n\n\"Who hasn't heard about such prints?\" Copeland growled laconically.\n\"There's no air or weather here to rub them out--even in eternity.\nThanks for showing a fresh-arrived greenhorn around...\"\n\nCopeland was nineteen, tough, willing to learn, but wary. His wide mouth\nwas usually sullen, his grey eyes a little narrowed in a face that\ndidn't have to be so grim. Back in Iowa he had a girl. Frances. But love\nhad to wait, for he needed the Moon the way Peary had once needed the\nNorth Pole.\n\nEarth needed it, too--for minerals; as an easier, jump-off point to the\nplanets because of its weak gravity; as a place for astronomical\nobservatories, unhampered by the murk of an atmosphere; as sites for\nlabs experimenting in forces too dangerous to be conducted on a\nheavily-populated world, and for a dozen other purposes.\n\nYoung Copeland was ready for blood, sweat, and tears in his impulse to\nhelp conquer the lunar wastes. He sized up big, swaggering Jess Brinker,\nand admitted to himself that this man, who was at least ten years his\nsenior, could easily be a phony, stalking suckers. Yet, Copeland\nreserved judgment. Like any tenderfoot anywhere, he needed an\nexperienced man to show him the ropes.\n\nHe already knew the Moon intimately from books: A hell of silence, some\nof it beautiful: Huge ringwalls. Blazing sunlight, inky shadow. Grey\nplains, black sky. Blazing stars, with the great blurry bluish globe of\nEarth among them. You could yearn to be on the Moon, but you could go\nbats and die there, too--or turn sour, because the place was too rough\nfor your guts.\n\nAfield, you wore a spacesuit, and conversed by helmet radiophone.\nOtherwise you lived in rooms and holes dug underground, and sealed up.\nThe scant water you dared use was roasted out of gypsum rock. The oxygen\nyou breathed was extracted from lunar oxides by a chemical process. Then\nair-rejuvenator apparatus reseparated it from the carbon-dioxide you\nexhaled, so that you could use it over and over.\n\nCopeland had read the tales: With that kind of frugality as the price of\nsurvival, lunar prospectors could turn selfish to the point of\nqueerness. Afraid somebody might follow them to their mineral claims,\nthey'd take more pains to leave as little spoor as possible than a fox\nbeing tracked by dogs.\n\n\"Speaking of how footprints last around here,\" Copeland remarked for the\nsake of conversation, \"I understand you've got to be careful--stick to\nhigh ridges, and to parts of the flat _maria_ where there's no old\nvolcanic ash or dust of thermal erosion.\"\n\n\"Guys who do that are misers and old women, kid,\" Brinker scoffed.\n\"Hell--it sure ain't because they're modest that they're so cautious!\nMe--I do things right.\"\n\nHe lifted a foot from the dust beside the path, revealing the mark of\nthe specially etched steel sole of his spaceboot. A name was stamped\nacross the print: BRINKER.\n\n\"I'm proud of where I've been and where I'm going--like a true\nexplorer,\" the big man said. \"Get some soles like mine made for\nyourself, fella, and come along with me.\"\n\nCopeland was intrigued. \"Let me think about it a little.\"\n\n             *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the next few hours he heard quite a lot.\n\nA big, blonde nurse--one of the two women in the sealed warrens of Tycho\nStation, said: \"Young man, I _love_ Jess Brinker. But keep away from\nhim, or you'll wind up in the prison pits, or worse.\"\n\nAnd Copeland heard about Tom Brinker, Jess' dad--the kind of swindler\nalways found in rough new territory, anywhere. He had promoted the idea\nof a real city on Lunar. Yeah--one with trees and flowers. What\nsentimental bait that was for home-starved, desolation-sick wanderers!\nNo wonder somebody had murdered him recently.\n\nBy common opinion, twenty-odd years was the only difference between Jess\nand his father. \"Stay clear,\" was the warning; the name of Brinker was\nmud and poison.\n\nArne Copeland was a cagey youngster; nobody influenced him when he made\nup his mind. He was no cow-eyed hero-worshipper; yet, on his own, he\nkind of liked the large, battered, egotist. Copeland knew that he\nwas an egotist himself. He also knew that merely to be on the\nsketchily-explored Moon was to take chances.\n\nSo he said \"Okay,\" to Brinker, and got some metal boot-soles made, with\nhis name etched into them in reverse, as in a rubber stamp.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder packs that no coolie could ever have lifted against Earth gravity,\nthey left Tycho Station and moved toward the fringe of that lunar\nhemisphere which is never seen from Terra--though it is no different\nfrom the visible half in general character.\n\nWherever their feet found a medium that would take an impression, they\nleft their trademark behind them. Copeland could brush a name out with a\nglove; otherwise those names were about as permanent as if carved from\ngranite, for there was no wind to blow the dust, and no rain to wash it\naway. Passing tractor-caravans would never blot out all of the\nfootprints. Not in ages of time.\n\n\"At least we got us a monument, Jess,\" Copeland said once, feeling\nsomewhat thrilled. \"That's what guys out exploring and prospecting need.\nA legend. A reputation.\"\n\nJess Brinker's eyes narrowed, making him look sinister. \"Yeah, Cope,\" he\ndrawled. \"But in my case it's a _counter_-reputation, with a little of\nRobin Hood thrown in, to help blow the stink of my Old Man off me. I\nwant some friends and backing, so I can do what Dad really wanted to\ndo--though he was as much of a rogue as a saint. You listening, Cope?\"\n\nCopeland kept his face stony. \"Tell me what you want to, and then stop,\"\nhe said softly.\n\n\"Thanks,\" Brinker answered. \"It doesn't matter too much that I can guess\nwho killed Pop, and would like to square things. Yeah, a hatchet-faced\nex-partner who turned pious and legal on the outside, after he got the\nbreaks. How old is that story, I wonder?... It doesn't even rile me\nterribly, knowing that Dad wasn't all crook, knowing he _believed_ his\nidea was good for everybody, and was trying to get funds to put it\nacross.\"\n\nBrinker sighed and went on: \"The idea is the _important_ thing, Cope. A\nplace with trees and flowers, a city, maybe--an antidote for the Moon's\ndesolation. Anyone here feels the need in his bones and nerves. But it\nwould take more air and water than could ever be imported, or drawn from\nthe lunar crust. You wouldn't know it on the dead surface, but two\nhundred miles deep in the Moon there's still molten lava, plentiful\nwater in the form of steam, volcanic carbon-dioxide gas--the makings of\noxygen. There's nitrogen, too.\n\n\"How to reach that stuff is the question. Drills break under the\npressure of depth at a tenth of the distance. Pop's idea involved\nBrulow's Comet, which will be coming back sunward from far space in\nthree years. Imagine--a comet! It could be dangerous, too; nobody could\never get permission for an attempt.\"\n\nBrinker paused again. Copeland and he were plodding through a jagged\nvalley. The stars were merciless pinpoints, the silence brittle and\ngrating.\n\n\"But there must be a way of blasting down to those life-giving\nraw-materials, Cope,\" Brinker continued. \"Maybe with atomic explosive.\nExperiments call for funds and backing. So I save my money, and wish I\nhad a head for making it faster. And I look for weak spots in the lunar\ncrust with radar. And I try to get people to know I'm around, and to\nlike me....\"\n\nCopeland realized that what he had just heard could be a line of malarky\nmeant to kid a yokel, or a bid to get him involved in something. But he\nfound himself kind of falling for the yarn. More than ever he suspected\nthat folks were wrong about Jess Brinker; his warning instincts were\nbeing lulled to sleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMonth-long lunar days passed, while the two men ranged over a segment of\nthe hidden hemisphere. They trod plains and crater-walls unsullied by\nhuman feet before; they took photographs to be sold to the Lunar\nTopographical Commission; they located deposits of radioactive metals,\nwhich could be registered for investigation by an assaying party, and\nfor possible royalties. Periodically they visited scattered supply\nstations, and then set out once more.\n\nSuch a life had its poisons even for Brinker and Copeland, who were\nbraced for meeting the unknown and the strange.\n\nLiving in space suits for weeks at a time; smelling their own unwashed\nbodies; slipping an arm out of a heavy sleeve to draw food through a\nlittle airlock in their armor's chestplate; knowing, in spite of\neffective insulation, that the heat of day exceeded the boiling point of\nwater, and that the cold of the protracted night, when usually they\ncontinued their explorations with the aid of ato-lamps, hovered at the\nbrink of absolute zero--all those things had a harsh effect on\nnervous-systems.\n\nThey found two human corpses. One had been crushed in a long fall, his\nspacesuit ripped open; he was a blackened mummy. The other was a\nfreckled youth, coffined in his armor. Failure of its air-rejuvenator\nunit had caused asphyxia. What you did for guys like this was collect\ntheir credentials for shipment home.\n\nCopeland also found a Martian--inside its transparent version of a\nspacesuit, for the ancient Moon had been much the same as now. The being\nwas dead, of course. Its brain-case had been a sac; its tentacles were\nlike a snarl of age-hardened leather thongs.\n\nLying near it was an even greater rarity--the remains of a different\nsort of monster from the planet that had been literally exploded\nin a war with Mars, to form the countless fragments that were the\nasteroids. That much of remote history was already known from the\nresearch-expeditions that had gone out to the Red Planet, and beyond.\n\nThe queer, advanced equipment of these two beings from two small,\nswift-cooling worlds--which had borne life early, and whose cultures had\nrivalled briefly for dominance of the solar system until they had wiped\neach other out those fifty million years ago--lay scattered near them.\nIt was still as bright and new as yesterday, preserved by the Moon's\nvacuum: Cameras, weapons, instruments--rich loot, now, to be sold to\nlabs that sought to add the technology of other minds to human\nknowledge.\n\nFor a year, things went well. The names, BRINKER and COPELAND,\nfootprinted into the lunar dust, helped build the new reputation that\nBrinker wanted. Copeland and he were a hard-working team; they covered\nmore ground than any other Moon explorers.\n\nThe fights that Brinker got into with other toughs at the various supply\nstations, and never lost, added to the legend--that old Tom's son was\nsavage and dangerous, but with a gentler side. For instance he once\ncarried a crazed Moon-tramp, whom Copeland was too slight to have\nhandled for a minute, fifty miles on his back to a station. Oh,\nsure--the stunt could be pure ballyhoo, not charity. But Copeland knew\nthat more and more people had begun to admire his buddy.\n\nBrinker never found a weak spot in the lunar crust. \"It's always about\ntwo hundred miles deep, Cope,\" he said. \"Lots thicker than Earth's\nshell, because the Moon, being smaller, cooled more. But don't worry;\nnothing is impossible. Soon I'll have enough money to make minor tests.\nAnd maybe enough friends for serious support.\"\n\nYeah--maybe it was all just a brain-bubble. But Copeland had seen enough\nof desolation to grind the spirit of the Brinker idea into his\nbones--even if he didn't think it was quite practical.\n\n\"I'll throw my dough in with yours, Jess,\" he said.\n\nTheir named bootprints helped build their fame as explorers; but there\nwas a flaw and an invitation here which they both must have\nrealized--and still faced as a calculated risk.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA lunar day later, they were plodding through the Fenwick mountains on\nthe far hemisphere, when streams of bullets made lava chips fly.\n\nAs they flopped prone in the dust, a scratchy voice chuckled: \"Hello,\nBrinker. Maybe you and your pal want my bunch to escort you back to\nTycho Station. We might as well have the reward. Robbery of a minerals\ncaravan and three killings, they say. It's terrible how you scatter your\ntracks around....\"\n\nBrinker grasped Copeland's wrist to form a sound-channel, so that they\ncould converse without using their radiophones. \"That was Krell\ntalking,\" he said. \"Dad's old partner.\"\n\nLuckily, it was not many hours to sunset. The mountain ridges, slanting\nup to the peaks, cast inky shadows that could hide anything. Brinker was\ncanny; while more bullets spurted, he led a dash back to a ridge-shadow\nthat went clear to the range-crest. Even with bulky packs, climbing was\na lot faster than on Earth, where things weigh six times as much.\n\nSo they got away, over the mountains. The black night of the far side of\nthe Moon, where Earth never shines, hid them.\n\n\"Making boot-soles with our names on them,\" Brinker growled bitterly,\nusing the radiophone at reduced range. \"The crudest kind of frameup.\"\n\n\"Your Krell is quite a man,\" Copeland stated.\n\n\"He _could_ have arranged all of it--sure,\" Brinker answered. \"He knows\nI suspect that he finished Pop, so I'm dangerous to him. He might hate\nme, too, as part of my Old Man--sort of ... Whatever it was he got sore\nabout, originally--money or principle, no doubt ... Besides, I don't\nthink he wants the Moon to be a little more livable. It would encourage\ntoo many colonists to come, increase metals production, spoil prices,\ncheapen his claims. He's a corny man, with all the corny reasons ...\n\n\"He, and some of his guys, could have robbed and killed and left\nfootprints like ours. But any other lugs, seeking someone else to blame\nfor their crimes, could have done all that. If that is so, Krell has got\nme even _legally_--without blame to himself.\"\n\n\"Footprints!\" Copeland snapped. \"They're so obviously a frame that it's\nsilly; anyone could see that! Another thing--maybe Krell was kidding,\nscaring us by saying that we are wanted. Tell you what, Jess: In any\ncase I won't seem as guilty as you; I'll go back alone to Tycho Station,\nand clear us both.\"\n\n\"You're an optimist, ain't you?\" Brinker laughed. \"Krell wasn't kidding;\nand in a rough place like the Moon, justice jumps to conclusions and\ngets mean, fast. Sure, the purpose of the footprints is obvious. But\nI've been fighting uphill against my Old Man's reputation for a long\ntime. Who's gonna say I haven't backslid? What I want to accomplish is\ntough enough with everything in my favor.\"\n\nBrinker's voice was now a sinister rumble with a quiver in it. Arne\nCopeland turned wary again; he had never lost entirely the deepseated\nnotion that Brinker might cause him misfortune.\n\n\"So now what?\" he demanded softly, flashing his ato-light beam against\nBrinker's face-window, so that he could see his expression. Copeland\nmeant to forestall danger aggressively.\n\nBut as the darkness between them was swept aside, he also saw the muzzle\nof Brinker's pistol levelled at him. The bigger man's grin was lopsided.\n\"I'd give you my neck, Cope,\" he rumbled. \"But I'd give both our necks\nfor you-know-what. Now, because that's all there's left, I'm gonna try\nit Pop's crazy way. You're gonna help. If you and I can last through a\ncouple of years of _real_ silence and solitude, it might have a chance.\nI got a ship hidden. Give me your gun. Easy! If you think I wouldn't\nshoot, you're a fool. Now I'll wire one of your wrists to mine; we've\ngot a long march ahead.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome march it was! Copeland was fiercely independent. The warnings about\nBrinker had gone to waste; so had his own wariness. Bitterness made him\nsavage. The harshness of the Moon still ached in his guts--he wanted the\nsteam and gases of its interior tapped and used, yes--but by some\nreasonable means. Jess Brinker must be truly Moon-balmy, now.\nDesolation-nuts. Wild for the sight of growing things. Else how could he\nthink seriously of using Brulow's Comet? Was it hard to guess how?\nCopeland knew that he and Brinker had courage, and willingness to work\nfor a sound purpose. But to trade long effort and hardship in a\nproposition that courted suicide, even in its probable failure--and wide\ndestruction if it managed to be successful--was worse than folly.\n\nSo, when these meanings became clear in his mind, he wrestled Brinker at\nevery turn. Twice he almost won. He argued and cursed, getting nowhere.\nHe defied Brinker to shoot him. The big man didn't do that. But at last\nBrinker jabbed a hypodermic needle--part of the regulation medical\nkit--through the flexible rubberized fabric of the elbow-joint of\nCopeland's spacesuit, and into his arm.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMany hours later, and many miles farther into the mountainous country,\nCopeland awoke in a cavern with glassy walls, illuminated by Brinker's\nato-light. Brinker stood near where he lay. He seemed just grimly\ngood-humored.\n\n\"This is an old Martian supply depot, Cope,\" he offered. \"I found it\nbefore I knew you, and I kept it in reserve for possible trouble, like\nnow. I knew I could convert its contents to considerable money at any\ntime. So it was like a bank-account, and a last resort, too. There's\neven a small Martian spaceship; only three others have ever been found,\nintact. I also cached some Earthly instruments here. You can bet I\ndidn't leave _any_ tracks for miles around.\"\n\nCopeland's gaze caught the errie gleam of the strange little craft. He\nsaw the stacks of oddly-made boxes and bales. His hackles rose as he\nthought of a senseless plunge into unplumbed distance.\n\n\"Unwire my hands, Jess!\" he coaxed again, trying to control fury. \"Get\nwise! Damn you--you're more dangerous as an altruist than any crook\ncould be!\"\n\nBrinker's laugh was sharp, but his eyes held real apology. \"Want to help\nme ready and load the ship?\" he said almost mildly. \"No--I guess not;\nyou aren't quite in a cooperative frame of mind, yet. I'll need you\nlater. Sorry, but you're the only guy around, Cope.\"\n\nBrinker blasted queer bulkheads out of the ship, in order to make it\nhabitable for humans. The exit of the cavern had been masked with\ndebris, but now he cleared it. He tossed Copeland aboard and took off\ninto the lunar night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe vast journey lasted for months. Once Brinker said to his sullen, and\nagain partially-drugged, captive: \"Maybe in two years, if we're very\nlucky, we'll be back.\"\n\nHurtling outward, they passed the orbits of Mars, the asteroids,\nJupiter, and Saturn. There, with Earth-made instruments, Brinker located\nwhat he sought: Brulow's Comet.\n\nSo far from the sun, where the fluorescence-inducing radiations were\nthinned almost to nothing, it glowed hardly at all. And it had almost no\ntail; it was only a gigantic, tenuous ghost, with a core of stone and\nmagnetic iron fragments.\n\nStill dazed, Copeland thought about comets. Wanderers, following\nelongated orbits that loop tight around the sun at one end and plumb the\ndepths of space at the other. Of all large forms moving through the\nvoid, they were the least dense. In coma and tail, they were only\nintensely rarefied and electrified gas. The great enigma about them was\nthat things so deficient in mass and gravity could hold onto even that\nmuch atmosphere for long. Perhaps new gases were baked out of the\nmeteoric core, each time a comet was close to the sun; maybe some of\nthem even renewed their atmosphere periodically, by capturing a little\nof the tenuous substance of the solar corona, during their very near\napproaches to it.\n\nBrulow's Comet was on the sunward swing, now, gaining speed under solar\ngravitation; but it still had a long ways to go. Brinker guided the ship\ndown through its coma and toward its lazily-rotating nucleus, where\nthousands of fragments of iron and rock swirled around their common\ncenter of gravity.\n\nThe chunks clattered against the craft's metal hull, but did no damage\nat their low speed. Brinker brought the ship to rest at the center of\nthe nucleus, where there was one solid mass of material a hundred yards\nin diameter.\n\n\"Well, we're here, Cope,\" Brinker said grimly. \"We don't have to work\nright away--if you don't want to. We've got too much time.\"\n\nThose two years looming ahead were the worst. If the Moon had been\nharsh, it was nothing to this eerie place. The heart of this small comet\nwas illumined by faint, shifting phosphorescence, ranging from blue and\ntarnished silver to delicate if poisonous pink. Perhaps the cause was\nthe same as that of the terrestrial aurora. The silence here was that of\nspace; but the swirling motion of the nucleus suggested a continuous\nmaddening rustle to Copeland.\n\nHe had to yield to Brinker's wishes. Toil might divert him some, keep\nhim from feeling the tension of time and strangeness so much.\n\n\"Okay, Brinker,\" he said. \"You win. Brulow's Comet is headed for a close\napproach to the Earth-Moon system. So you want to be spectacular, and\nshift it a little from its orbit--so that it will hit the Moon and maybe\nbreak its crust. Was that so hard to figure? That sounds pretty big,\ndoesn't it? But I'll humor you. Let's see how far we get ... Since we're\nhere.\" His sarcasm was tired.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs a preliminary, they cut a cavern in the central mass of the nucleus\nwith Martian blasters, and fitted it with a crude airlock. The cavern\nwould be better to live in than the interior of a ship meant for alien\nbeings. They moved Martian apparatus and supplies into it:\nAir-rejuvenators, moisture-reclaimers, cylinders of oxygen and water,\nand containers of nourishment--all millions of years old.\n\nTheir remaining supply of Earthly food in their packs was now very\nshort. It was weird--eating what had been preserved so long ago, on\nanother world, for beings just barely close enough to human for their\nfood to be edible. Gelatins, sectional fragments of vegetation, and what\nmight have been muscle-tissue. Copeland and Brinker both gagged often.\nIt wasn't the bland, oily taste so much, but the idea....\n\nSome of it, Copeland decided, was not native Martian. It was more like\nterrestrial fish. And slabs of coarse meat might have been flesh of the\nlast dinosaurs! Martians surely must have visited Earth briefly, though\nevidence there had long since weathered away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile the still-distant sun sent thin light into the comet, Brinker and\nCopeland removed the propulsion-tubes from the ship and welded them to\nthe central chunk of the nucleus. They had a number of other spare\njet-tubes. These they fastened to lesser masses.\n\nWhenever, in the slow swirling of the nucleus, tubes pointed in the\ncalculated proper direction at right angles to the comet's course, they\nwere fired in long bursts. Thus, slowly, like a perfectly-balanced bank\nvault door moved by a finger, the mass of the comet--slight by volume,\nbut still measuring many thousands of tons--was deflected in the\nopposite direction. Astrogation-instruments showed the shift. Copeland\nhad expected such coarse deflection to be possible; still, it startled\nhim--this was the moving of a celestial body!\n\n\"Just a little--for now, Cope,\" Brinker said. \"We'll leave the fine\naiming for later. Meanwhile we've got to pass the time, stay as well as\nwe can, and keep our heads on straight.\"\n\nSure--straight! If Brinker hadn't turned foolish before they had come,\nthey wouldn't be out here at all. In a month they were already thinning\ndown from malnutrition and strain. At first, thinking coldly, Copeland\nwas sure they'd wilt and die long before they got near the Moon.\n\nThen, as they managed to steady themselves some by the diversions of\nplaying cards, and studying the intricacies of Martian equipment, he\nbegan to fear once more that Brinker might succeed in his efforts--but\nfail terribly in result.\n\nMany times Copeland went over the same arguments, struggling to speak\ncalmly, and without anger: \"I wonder if you realize it, Brinker--with\nenough velocity one large meteor carries more energy than a fission\nbomb. A whole comet would affect thousands of square miles of the lunar\nsurface, at least. Smash equipment, kill men. And if the comet happened\nto miss the Moon and hit Earth--\"\n\nSometimes Brinker's expression became almost fearful, as at an enormity.\nBut then he'd turn stubborn and grin. \"There's plenty of room to avoid\nhitting the Earth,\" he'd say. \"On the Moon, astronomers will warn of the\nshifted orbit of Brulow's Comet in plenty of time for everybody to get\nout of danger. Most of what we've got to worry about now, is our lives,\nor jail ...\"\n\nA moment later, as like as not, they'd be slamming at each other with\nfists. Copeland found it hard to contain his fury for the man who had\nbrought him such trouble, and--without intent--was so determined to\nextend it to many others.\n\nBrinker kept winning the scraps. But Copeland's ten-year age-advantage\nmeant something when it came to enduring hardship and partial-starvation\nover a long period. They didn't weaken equally.\n\nThis levelling of forces was one thing that Copeland waited for. Another\nwas that when Brulow's Comet was found to be off course, a ship might be\nsent to investigate. He never mentioned it, certainly; but once Brinker\nsaid: \"I'm ready for what you're thinking, Cope. I've got weapons.\"\n\nBy then they spent much of their time in torpid sleep.\n\nAnother difficulty was that it was getting harder to keep one's mind\nconsistently on the same track. Space, tribulation, and the months, were\nhaving their blurring effect.\n\nOften, Copeland spent many hours in wistful reverie about his girl,\nFrances, in Iowa. Sometimes he hated all people--on Earth, Moon, and\neveryhere, and didn't care what happened to them. On other occasions\nBrinker's basic desire to lessen the desolation of the lunar scene\nlooked supremely good to him--as of course it always had, in principle.\nThen, briefly and perhaps madly, he was Brinker's pal, instead of\nyearning to beat him to a pulp.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomehow, twenty months crept by, and the first spaceship hove\ninquisitively close to Brulow's Comet. A shadow of his former self,\nBrinker crept out of the cavern to man his weapons. But like a famished\nbeast seeking prey, Copeland followed him.\n\nHis victory, now, was almost easy. Then all he had to do was wait to be\npicked up; the ship was coming nearer. Through the now much-brightened\nglow of the comet, it had ceased to be a planetlike speck reflecting\nsunlight; and showed its actual form.\n\nConfusion whirled in Copeland's head; hunger gnawed in him. Yet he\nlooked down at Brinker--poor Brinker, beaten unconscious inside his\nspacesuit. Brinker had tried to fight lifeless dreariness. Copeland,\nweak of body and fogged of mind, was now close to maudlin tears.\nDreariness was the enemy--here as elsewhere. He tried to think; his\nstubborn nature mixed itself with splinters of reason, and seemed to\nmake sense.\n\nHis twenty months of suffering out here had to be used--mean\nsomething--didn't it? It couldn't be just a futile blank. You had to\nfollow a thing started through to the end, didn't you? Brinker wanted to\nimprove the Moon, which certainly needed that. Okay--finish the job that\nhad gone so far. Damn desolation everywhere! Fight it! Smash it! Sudden\nrage made Copeland's thin blood pound. Dimly he realized that he was\ndriven by the same dreariness-disease that motivated Brinker. So what?\nWho cared about smashed lunar equipment, after all. And beside\nexperience, prison would be paradise.\n\nCopeland fired a Martian rocket-launcher, aiming behind the ship. He saw\nthe blaze of atomic fission. Jets flaming, the craft fled.\n\nIn his phones he heard a voice that he remembered: \"That you, Brinker?\nTrying your father's trick, eh? Idiot! You'll kill yourself, or be\nexecuted. And now you even shoot!\"\n\nFury at Krell clinched Copeland's decision. He did not answer him. But\nwhen Brinker woke up he said savagely, without friendship or\nforgiveness, yet with cooperation: \"We're on the same side, now. Let's\naim Brulow's Comet.\"\n\nConcentrating was hard, but they had their instruments and calculators.\nVelocity, position, and course of both comet and Moon had to be\ncoordinated to make them arrive in the same place at the same moment. It\nwas a problem in astrogation, but a comet was not as easily directed as\na space ship. Copeland had once thought that the necessary fine guiding\ncouldn't be done. The jet-system they had rigged in that inconveniently\nwhirling nucleus was crude.\n\nBut one thing was in their favor; they had ample time. They could adjust\ntheir course with the jets, check with instruments, and re-adjust--again\nand again. Copeland found himself doing the vital part of the job; he\nwas better at math than Brinker.\n\nThey still had plenty of Martian food left--for what it was worth to\nhuman insides. Perhaps unified purpose and action brightened their\noutlook a little, helping their bodies. They could never work very\nlong--even in the almost total absence of gravity. But--at least--their\nweakness wasn't increasing now.\n\nDuring those last four months they drove several ships away. Earth and\nMoon swelled to spheres, ahead. Brulow's Comet lengthened its tail under\nincreased solar light-pressure. Intensified radiation made its shifting\ncolors glorious.\n\nBrinker and Copeland lined their gigantic missile up on its target as\nperfectly as they could. Fifty hours before the crash was due, they\nsmashed most of the jets. The remaining ones they tried, feebly, to\nrefit into their ship, meaning thus to escape.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree Space Patrol craft showed up, and they had to man their weapons.\nCopeland hated to be an outlaw; but now he could not see effort brought\nto nothing. Brinker and he had survived so far, accomplishing much--far\nbetter results than he had expected; it made him surer that their\npurpose was generally sound.\n\nMore missiles were fired carefully--not to do damage, but to discourage\nthe intruders; the latter were held at bay for another twelve hours.\nCopeland and Brinker left radio commands and threats unanswered, so it\nwas hard for their opponents to get a fix on their position in the\nwhirling nucleus.\n\nExplosions blazed around them, but never very close. Masses of iron and\nstone were shattered and half vaporized, cooling subsequently to fine\ndust. The nucleus of Brulow's Comet expanded a bit under the battering\nthat went on within it.\n\nAt an opportune moment, Copeland and Brinker clung to one of their\njet-tubes and, gunning it very lightly, rode it from the central\ncore-mass of the nucleus to a lesser meteor, and hid in a cleft. A\ndust-poll had concealed their change of position. And now, with so many\nother large meteors around them, they would be almost impossible to\nfind.\n\nThey glimpsed the Patrol craft invading the heart of the comet. Men\npoured forth, struggling to set up jets in the hope of still deflecting\nthis juggernaut from the Moon. But the comet was already much too close;\nbefore the setting-up was half completed it had to be abandoned. Still,\nthe ships remained almost to the last.\n\nCopeland wondered tensely if they'd ever go. His withered palms\nperspired.\n\n\"We could still yell for help--have them take us off,\" Brinker suggested\nwhen they had left. He spoke by sound-channel contact.\n\nThe Moon loomed huge and ugly ahead. Copeland gave it a scared glance,\nand then laughed grimly. \"Ironic, that would be,\" he snapped, \"No--we've\ngot this jet to ride, and we're still at liberty.\"\n\nFrom space, lashed to the flaming propulsion tube, they saw the crash\nhappen. It was a terrific spectacle. Copeland's hopes now had jagged\ncracks of worry. The comet seemed to move slowly, its coma flattening\nover the Moon's spaceward hemisphere. There were blinding flashes as the\nchunks of its nucleus bit into the lunar crust, their energy of velocity\nconverting largely to heat. Then dust masked the region of impact. The\ncomet's tail collapsed over the Moon like a crumbling tower.\n\nCopeland gulped. He saw that Brinker had gone limp--fainted. Weakness\nwas enough to cause that; but the fact of a plan carried out had a shock\nin it, too.\n\nCopeland worked the jury-rigged controls of the jet, continuing to\ndecelerate. At spotty intervals, under the terrible thrust of reducing\nspeed, he was unconscious, too.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no such thing as picking a landing-spot. Checking velocity\nsoon enough, so close to the Moon, took all of the propulsion tube's\npower--so he just followed the comet down. Almost at a stand-still at\nlast, balanced on a streamer of flame, he toppled into hot dust Feebly\nhe worked to unlash himself from the tube. Brinker, jolted back to\nsemi-consciousness, managed to do the same.\n\nWeakened and spent, they could not even lift themselves against the\nslight lunar gravity for a while.\n\nThe darkness around them was Stygian. But as more dust settled, the sky\ncleared, and the normal stars of the lunar night blazed out. Their\nattention was drawn in one direction inevitably.\n\nRed-hot lava glowed there, in scattered areas over what was clearly an\nextensive expanse of territory. White vaporous plumes spurted high above\nthe ground, and against the sides of new-formed meteor-craters, a white\nlayer was collecting.\n\nCopeland staggered erect. \"Frost and snow!\" he stammered. \"From volcanic\nsteam! The first frost and snow on the Moon in a billion years! We've\ndone it, Brinker! Brulow's Comet really did crack the thick lunar\ncrust....\"\n\nHe heard Brinker's grunt of premature enthusiasm.\n\nThe Patrol picked them up hours later, wandering dazedly. They were\nemaciated ghosts of men--almost skeletons in armor. They gave their\nnames, but didn't really come to their senses until the prison doctor in\nTycho Station treated them, and they had slept for a long time.\n\n\"Don't worry, fellas. Relax,\" he said--with fury in his eyes.\n\nOther faces were grim.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the speedy trial in Tycho Station, sharp-featured Krell was among\nmany who flung accusations.\n\n\"In the impact-zone itself--an area a hundred miles across--mining\ninstallations and machinery of tremendous value were utterly destroyed,\"\nhe said. \"But lesser damage extends to a far wider circle. Thousands of\nclaims have been buried in dust, till much of the far lunar hemisphere\nwill have to be resurveyed. Luckily, miners and explorers were warned in\ntime, and sought safety. But the charge of wholesale vandalism--terrible\nenough--does not stand alone. These men are to be remembered as accused\nrobbers and murderers.\"\n\nIn rebuttal, Brinker's defiance was a little uncertain, as if under so\nmuch blame, he had lost his assurance.\n\n\"Men who know the Moon know that its barrenness is poison, and not right\nfor people!\" he growled. \"I tried to change it with Brulow's Comet--when\nI had no success by other means. Anyway, Copeland is blameless. I forced\nhim to help me.\"\n\nEmbitted, there was no warmth in Copeland for his older codefendant and\njinx. Still, even without Brinker's attempt to shield him, he would have\nbeen loyal.\n\n\"During all important parts of mine and Jess Brinker's joint project,\"\nhe told the court, \"I was in full agreement with his purpose.\"\n\nTheir attorney accomplished one considerable victory before these angry\npeople. The charge of previous murders and robbery was barred; it was\nadmitted that footprints were easy to duplicate, and that the presence\nof some bearing the names of the guilty was unlikely.\n\nBrinker got fifty years in the mine-pits, and Copeland thirty.\n\n\"You always figured I might get you in a jam, didn't you, Cope?\" Brinker\nsaid. \"I'll keep trying to fix that.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCopeland found nothing to grin about, in a thirty-year sentence. It was\ngoodbye wandering, goodbye girls, goodbye everything. He'd get out\nmiddle-aged, finished, and marked. He might as well stay another twenty\nwith Brinker--complete a sour association with him.\n\nCopeland had another recent jolt to brood over. A bunch of old letters\nfrom his Frances had been delivered to him. His inability to receive or\nanswer any of them had brought the worst result. She had married another\nguy, and who could blame her?\n\nArne Copeland wanted to kill Brinker. Getting desolation-goofy, and\ndragging him into this mess.\n\nBut from Brinker's infuriating grin, Copeland caught a hot spark of\nhope, backed by reasoning.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater, sweating in the penal mine-pits near Tycho Station, Brinker and\nCopeland still heard scraps of news.\n\nExplorers moved back into the region where the comet had split the lunar\ncrust. The rising columns of steam and gas were perhaps unspectacular\nphenomena in themselves. But there they were, ready to fill a tremendous\nneed. The sleepy internal fires of the Moon were unlikely to be violent.\nYet they would push vapors up to the surface here perhaps for centuries.\n\nIn balancing benefit against transient damage, was it necessary even to\nmention that deeper and richer mineral deposits had been laid bare for\neasy mining by the blast effect of the comet's downfall? All free\nmen--good or bad, and of large or small holdings--were set to gain,\nKrell included. But better mines were a side-issue.\n\nThe prisoners soon heard how roofs of transparent, flexible plastic,\nbrought in bundles like fabric, were being reared over that smashed-up\nregion, to trap escaping volcanic vapors. One tentlike structure. Then\nanother and another.\n\nHere was ample water from volcanic steam, and vast quantities of\ncarbon-dioxide from which ordinary air-rejuvenators could release\nbreathable oxygen. Men who had lived so long in the lunar silence and\nbarrenness, soon saw that these raw materials of life need not only be\nused locally, but could be piped anywhere.\n\n\"Folks have caught on, Cope,\" Brinker said. \"They were a little\ndesolation-balmy, too--hence on our side all the time. Now they'll feel\nbetter about my Old Man. There'll be more than one city, I'll\nbet--clusters of big, plastic air-bubbles, self-sealing against\nmeteor-punctures, warmed inside at night by volcanic heat. It won't\nhappen all at once, but it'll come. Seeds'll be planted, and houses\nbuilt. Parts of the Moon won't look the same.\"\n\nKrell's death was part of the turning tide. He was found in Tycho\nStation, head smashed by a boot-sole of metal; it was good that Brinker\nwas in prison, because his name was printed into Krell's skull.\n\nWho did it? Neither Brinker nor Copeland cared very much. Some wronged\nstooge of Krell's, no doubt. Let the forces of law figure out the\ndetails.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThings got really good for Copeland and Brinker after popular demand\nforced their vindication. They were feted, honored, praised, rewarded.\nAll Earth knew of them, and feminine colonists arriving as part of a new\nphase of the Moon's development, shined up to them as heroes.\n\nIt is not to be said that they didn't enjoy the advantages of fame.\nBrinker said more than once: \"Forget your Frances, Cope. Problems are\neasy, these days.\"\n\nThe time came when Copeland growled in answer: \"Sure--too easy. Having a\nlot of pals after the need is gone. No--I'm not criticizing. Most folks\nare swell. But I'd like to make friends and maybe find love a little\nmore naturally. I thought I'd stay on the Moon; now I think I'll shove\noff for Mars. People are going there; whole towns are being built, I\nunderstand. And there's plenty of room for a lunar tramp, with a\nprison-record, to get lost ...\"\n\nCopeland chuckled at the end. His vagabond blood was singing. He was\nalso pitching a come-on at Brinker, for he'd seen him with some letters\nwhile they were prisoners. Copeland had glimpsed the name and address of\nthe writer: Dorothy Wells, the big nurse that Brinker had known at Tycho\nStation. She was in Marsport now.\n\n\"By gosh--I guess I'll go too, Cope!\" Brinker rumbled.\n\nLooking back, Brinker thought it sort of funny that they were pals. He\nlaughed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n  Transcriber Notes:\n\n  This etext was produced by Science Fiction Stories 1953.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
