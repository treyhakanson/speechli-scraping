F. BONE\n\n Illustrated by FINLAY\n\n\n _I smelled the trouble the moment I stepped on\n the lift and took the long ride up the side of\n the \"Lachesis.\" There was something wrong. I\n couldn't put my finger on it but_\n\nfive years in the Navy gives a man a feeling for these things. From the\noutside the ship was beautiful, a gleaming shaft of duralloy, polished\nuntil she shone. Her paint and brightwork glistened. The antiradiation\nshields on the gun turrets and launchers were folded back exactly\naccording to regulations. The shore uniform of the liftman was spotless\nand he stood at his station precisely as he should. As the lift moved\nslowly up past no-man's country to the life section, I noted a work\nparty hanging precariously from a scaffolding smoothing out meteorite\npits in the gleaming hull, while on the catwalk of the gantry standing\nbeside the main cargo hatch a steady stream of supplies disappeared into\nthe ship's belly.\n\nI returned the crisp salutes of the white-gloved sideboys, saluted the\ncolors, and shook hands with an immaculate ensign with an O.D. badge on\nhis tunic.\n\n\"Glad to have you aboard, sir,\" the ensign said.\n\n\"I'm Marsden,\" I said. \"Lieutenant Thomas Marsden. I have orders posting\nme to this ship as Executive.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. We have been expecting you. I'm Ensign Halloran.\"\n\n\"Glad to meet you, Halloran.\"\n\n\"Skipper's orders, sir. You are to report to him as soon as you come\naboard.\"\n\nThen I got it. Everything was SOP. The ship wasn't taut, she was tight!\nAnd she wasn't happy. There was none of the devil-may-care spirit that\nmarks crews in the Scouting Force and separates them from the stodgy\nmass of the Line. Every face I saw on my trip to the skipper's cabin was\nblank, hard-eyed, and unsmiling. There was none of the human noise that\nnormally echoes through a ship, no laughter, no clatter of equipment, no\ndeviations from the order and precision so dear to admirals' hearts.\nThis crew was G.I. right down to the last seam tab on their uniforms.\nWhoever the skipper was, he was either bucking for another cluster or a\ncold-feeling automaton to whom the Navy Code was father, mother, and\nBible.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe O.D. stopped before the closed door, executed a mechanical right\nface, knocked the prescribed three times and opened the door smartly on\nthe heels of the word \"Come\" that erupted from the inside. I stepped in\nfollowed by the O.D.\n\n\"Commander Chase,\" the O.D. said. \"Lieutenant Marsden.\"\n\nChase! Not Cautious Charley Chase! I could hardly look at the man behind\nthe command desk. But look I did--and my heart did a ninety degree dive\nstraight to the thick soles of my space boots. No wonder this ship was\nsour. What else could happen with Lieutenant Commander Charles Augustus\nChase in command! He was three classes up on me, but even though he was\na First Classman at the time I crawled out of Beast Barracks, I knew\nhim well. Every Midshipman in the Academy knew him--Rule-Book\nCharley--By-The-Numbers Chase--his nicknames were legion and not one of\nthem was friendly. \"Lieutenant Thomas Marsden reporting for duty,\" I\nsaid.\n\nHe looked at the O.D. \"That'll be all, Mr. Halloran,\" he said.\n\n\"Aye, sir,\" Halloran said woodenly. He stepped backward, saluted,\nexecuted a precise about face and closed the hatch softly behind him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Sit down, Marsden,\" Chase said. \"Have a cigarette.\"\n\nHe didn't say, \"Glad to have you aboard.\" But other than that he was\nNavy right down to the last parenthesis. His voice was the same dry\nschoolmaster's voice I remembered from the Academy. And his face was the\nsame dry gray with the same fishy blue eyes and rat trap jaw. His hair\nwas thinner, but other than that he hadn't changed. Neither the war nor\nthe responsibilities of command appeared to have left their mark upon\nhim. He was still the same lean, undersized square-shouldered blob of\nnastiness.\n\nI took the cigarette, sat down, puffed it into a glow, and looked around\nthe drab 6 x 8 foot cubicle called the Captain's cabin by ship designers\nwho must have laughed as they laid out the plans. It had about the room\nof a good-sized coffin. A copy of the Navy Code was lying on the desk.\nChase had obviously been reading his bible.\n\n\"You are three minutes late, Marsden,\" Chase said. \"Your orders direct\nyou to report at 0900. Do you have any explanation?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" I said.\n\n\"Don't let it happen again. On this ship we are prompt.\"\n\n\"Aye, sir,\" I muttered.\n\nHe smiled, a thin quirk of thin lips. \"Now let me outline your duties,\nMarsden. You are posted to my ship as Executive Officer. An Executive\nOfficer is the Captain's right hand.\"\n\n\"So I have heard,\" I said drily.\n\n\"Belay that, Mr. Marsden. I do not appreciate humor during duty hours.\"\n\nYou wouldn't, I thought.\n\n\"As I was saying, Marsden, Executive Officer, you will be responsible\nfor--\" He went on and on, covering the Code--chapter, book and verse on\nthe duties of an Executive Officer. It made no difference that I had\nbeen Exec under Andy Royce, the skipper of the \"Clotho,\" the ship with\nthe biggest confirmed kill in the entire Fleet Scouting Force. I was\nstill a new Exec, and the book said I must be briefed on my duties. So\n\"briefed\" I was--for a solid hour.\n\nFeeling angry and tired, I finally managed to get away from Rule Book\nCharley and find my quarters which I shared with the Engineer. I knew\nhim casually, a glum reservist named Allyn. I had wondered why he always\nseemed to have a chip on his shoulder. Now I knew.\n\nHe was lying in his shock-couch as I came in. \"Welcome, sucker,\" he\ngreeted me. \"Glad to have you aboard.\"\n\n\"The feeling's not mutual,\" I snapped.\n\n\"What's the matter? Has the Lieutenant Commander been rolling you out on\nthe red carpet?\"\n\n\"You could call it that,\" I said. \"I've just been told the duties of an\nExec. Funny--no?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Not funny. I feel for you. He told me how to be an\nengineer six months ago.\" Allyn's thin face looked glummer than usual.\n\n\"Did I ever tell you about our skip--captain?\" Allyn went on. \"Or do I\nhave to tell you? I see you're wearing an Academy ring.\"\n\n\"You can't tell me much I haven't already heard,\" I said coldly. I don't\nlike wardroom gossips as a matter of policy. A few disgruntled men on a\nship can shoot morale to hell, and on a ship this size the Exec is the\nmorale officer. But I was torn between two desires. I wanted Allyn to go\non, but I didn't want to hear what Allyn had to say. I was like the\nproverbial hungry mule standing halfway between two haystacks of equal\nsize and attractiveness. And like the mule I would stand there turning\nmy head one way and the other until I starved to death.\n\nBut Allyn solved my problem for me. \"You haven't heard _this_,\" he said\nbitterly. \"The whole crew applied for transfer when we came back to base\nafter our last cruise. Of course, they didn't get it, but you get the\nidea. Us reservists and draftees get about the same consideration as the\nAdmiral's dog--No! dammit!--Less than the dog. They wouldn't let a mangy\ncur ship out with Gutless Gus.\"\n\nGutless Gus! that was a new one. I wondered how Chase had managed to\nacquire that sobriquet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It was on our last patrol,\" Allyn went on, answering my question before\nI asked it. \"We were out at maximum radius when the detectors showed a\ndisturbance in normal space. Chase ordered us down from Cth for a quick\nlook--and so help me, God, we broke out right in the middle of a Rebel\nsupply convoy--big, fat, sitting ducks all around us. We got off about\ntwenty Mark VII torpedoes before Chase passed the word to change over.\nWe scooted back into Cth so fast we hardly knew we were gone. And then\nhe raises hell with Detector section for not identifying every class of\nship in that convoy!\n\n\"And when Bancroft, that's the Exec whom you've relieved, asked for a\nquick check to confirm our kills, Chase sat on him like a ton of brick.\n'I'm not interested in how many poor devils we blew apart back there,'\nour Captain says. 'Our mission is to scout, to obtain information about\nenemy movements and get that information back to Base. We cannot\ntransmit information from a vaporized ship, and that convoy had a naval\nescort. Our mission cannot be jeopardized merely to satisfy morbid\ncuriosity. Request denied. And, Mr. Bancroft, have Communications\ncontact Fleet. This information should be in as soon as possible.' And\nthen he turned away leaving Bancroft biting his fingernails. He wouldn't\neven push out a probe--scooted right back into the blue where we'd be\nsafe!\n\n\"You know, we haven't had one confirmed kill posted on the list since\nwe've been in space. It's getting so we don't want to come in any more.\nLike the time--the 'Atropos' came in just after we touched down. She was\nbattered--looked like she'd been through a meat grinder, but she had ten\nconfirmed and six probable, and four of them were escorts! Hell! Our\nboys couldn't hold their heads up. The 'Lachesis' didn't have a mark on\nher and all we had was a few possible hits. You know how it\ngoes--someone asks where you're from. You say the 'Lachesis' and they\nsay 'Oh, yes, the cruise ship.' And that's that. It's so true you don't\neven feel like resenting it.\"\n\nI didn't like the bitter note in Allyn's voice. He was a reservist,\nwhich made it all the worse. Reservists have ten times the outside\ncontacts we regulars do. In general when a regular and reservist tangle,\nthe Academy men close ranks like musk-oxen and meet the challenge with\nan unbroken ring of horns. But somehow I didn't feel like ringing up.\n\nI kept hoping there was another side to the story. I'd check around and\nfind out as soon as I got settled. And if there was another side, I was\ngoing to take Allyn apart as a malicious trouble-maker. I felt sick to\nmy stomach.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe spent the next three days taking on stores and munitions, and I was\ntoo busy supervising the stowage and checking manifests to bother about\nrunning down Allyn's story. I met the other officers--Lt. Pollard the\ngunnery officer, Ensign Esterhazy the astrogator, and Ensign Blakiston.\nNice enough guys, but all wearing that cowed, frustrated look that\nseemed to be a \"Lachesis\" trademark. Chase, meanwhile, was up in Flag\nOfficer's Country picking up the dope on our next mission. I hoped that\nAllyn was wrong but the evidence all seemed to be in his favor. Even\nmore than the officers, the crew was a mess underneath their clean\nuniforms. From Communications Chief CPO Haskins to Spaceman Zelinski\nthere was about as much spirit in them as you'd find in a punishment\ndetail polishing brightwork in Base Headquarters. I'm a cheerful soul,\nand usually I find no trouble getting along with a new command, but this\none was different. They were efficient enough, but one could see that\ntheir hearts weren't in their work. Most crews preparing to go out are\nnervous and high tempered. There was none of that here. The men went\nthrough the motions with a mechanical indifference that was frightening.\nI had the feeling that they didn't give a damn whether they went or\nnot--or came back or not. The indifference was so thick you could cut it\nwith a knife. Yet there was nothing you could put your hand on. You\ncan't touch people who don't care.\n\nFour hours after Chase came back, we lifted gravs from Earth. Chase was\nsitting in the control chair, and to give him credit, we lifted as\nsmooth as a silk scarf slipping through the fingers of a pretty woman.\nWe hypered at eight miles and swept up through the monochromes of Cth\nuntil we hit middle blue, when Chase slipped off the helmet, unfastened\nhis webbing, and stood up.\n\n\"Take over, Mr. Marsden,\" he said. \"Lay a course for Parth.\"\n\n\"Aye, sir,\" I replied, slipping into the chair and fastening the web. I\nslipped the helmet on my head and instantly I was a part of the ship.\nIt's a strange feeling, this synthesis of man and metal that makes a\nfighting ship the metallic extension of the Commander's will. I was\nconscious of every man on duty. What they saw I saw, what they heard I\nheard, through the magic of modern electronics. The only thing missing\nwas that I couldn't feel what they felt, which perhaps was a mercy\nconsidering the condition of the crew. Using the sensor circuits in the\ncommand helmet, I let my perception roam through the ship, checking the\nengines, the gun crews, the navigation board, the galley--all the\nmanifold stations of a fighting ship. Everything was secure, the ship\nwas clean and trimmed, the generators were producing their megawatts of\npower without a hitch, and the converters were humming contentedly,\nkeeping us in the blue as our speed built to fantastic levels.\n\nI checked the course, noted it was true, set the controls on standby and\nrelaxed, half dozing in the chair as Lume after Lume dropped astern with\nmonotonous regularity.\n\nAn hour passed and Halloran came up to relieve me. With a sigh of relief\nI surrendered the chair and headset. The unconscious strain of being in\nrapport with ship and crew didn't hit me until I was out of the chair.\nBut when it did, I felt like something was crushing me flat. Not that I\ndidn't expect it, but the \"Lachesis\" was worse than the \"Clotho\" had\never been.\n\nI had barely hit my couch when General Quarters sounded. I smothered a\ncurse as I pounded up the companionway to my station at the bridge.\nChase was there, stopwatch in hand, counting the seconds.\n\n\"Set!\" Halloran barked.\n\n\"Fourteen seconds,\" Chase said. \"Not bad. Tell the crew well done.\" He\nput the watch in his pocket and walked away.\n\nI picked up the annunciator mike and pushed the button. \"Skipper says\nwell done,\" I said.\n\n\"He got ten seconds out of us once last trip,\" Halloran said. \"And he's\nbeen trying to repeat that fluke ever since. Bet you a munit to an 'F'\nration that he'll be down with the section chief trying to shave off\nanother second or two. Hey!--what's that--oh ...\" He looked at me.\n\"Disturbance in Cth yellow, straight down--shall we go?\"\n\n\"Stop ship,\" I ordered. \"Sound general quarters.\" There was no\ndeceleration. We merely swapped ends as the alarm sounded, applied full\npower and stopped. That was the advantage of Cth--no inertia. We\nbacktracked for three seconds and held in middle blue.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What's going on?\" Chase demanded as he came up from below. His eyes\nraked the instruments. \"Why are we stopped?\"\n\n\"Disturbance in Cth yellow, sir,\" I said. \"We're positioned above it.\"\n\n\"Very good, Mr. Marsden.\" He took the spare helmet from the Exec's\nchair, clapped it on, fiddled with the controls for a moment, nodded,\nand took the helmet off. \"Secure and resume course,\" he said. \"That's\nthe 'Amphitrite'--fleet supply and maintenance. One of our people.\"\n\n\"You sure, sir?\" I asked, and then looked at the smug grin on Halloran's\nface and wished I hadn't asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" Chase said. \"She's a three converter job running at full\noutput. Since the Rebels have no three converter ships, she has to be\none of ours. And since she's running at full output and only in Cth\nyellow, it means she's big, heavy, and awkward--which means a\nmaintenance or an ammunition supply ship. There's an off phase beat in\nher number two converter that gives a twenty cycle pulse to her pattern.\nAnd the only heavy ship in the fleet with this pattern is 'Amphitrite.'\nYou see?\"\n\nI saw--with respect. \"You know all the heavies like that, sir?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not all of them--but I'd like to. It's as much a part of a scoutship\ncommander's work to know our own ships as those of the enemy.\"\n\n\"Could that trace be a Rebel ruse?\"\n\n\"Not likely--travelling in the yellow. A ship would be cold meat this\nfar inside our perimeter. And besides, there's no Rebel alive who can\ntune a converter like a Navy mechanic.\"\n\n\"You sure?\" I persisted.\n\n\"I'm sure. But take her down if you wish.\"\n\nI did. And it was the \"Amphitrite.\"\n\n\"I served on her for six months,\" Chase said drily as we went back\nthrough the components. I understood his certainty now. A man has a\nfeeling for ships if he's a good officer. But it was a trait I'd never\nexpected in Chase. I gave the orders and we resumed our band and speed.\nChase looked at me.\n\n\"You acted correctly, Mr. Marsden,\" he said. \"Something I would hardly\nexpect, but something I was glad to see.\"\n\n\"I served under Andy Royce,\" I reminded him.\n\n\"I know,\" Chase replied. \"That's why I'm surprised.\" He turned away\nbefore I could think of an answer that would combine insolence and\nrespect for his rank. \"Keep her on course, Mr. Halloran,\" he tossed over\nhis shoulder as he went out.\n\nWe kept on course--high and hard despite a couple of disturbances that\nlumbered by underneath us. Once I made a motion to stop ship and check,\nbut Halloran shook his head.\n\n\"Don't do it, sir,\" he warned.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"You heard the Captain's orders. He's a heller for having them obeyed.\nBesides, they might be Rebs--and we might get hurt shooting at them.\nWe'll just report their position and approximate course--and keep on\ntravelling. Haskins is on the Dirac right now.\" Halloran's voice was\nsarcastic.\n\nI didn't like the sound of it, and said so.\n\n\"Well, sir--we won't lose them entirely,\" Halloran said comfortingly.\n\"Some cruiser will investigate them. Chances are they're ours\nanyway--and if they aren't there's no sense in us risking our nice shiny\nskin stopping them--even though we could take them like Lundy took\nKoromaja. Since the book doesn't say we have to investigate, we won't.\"\nHis voice was bitter again.\n\nAt 0840 hours on the fourth day out, my annunciator buzzed. \"Sir,\" the\ntalker's voice came over the intercom, \"Lieutenants Marsden and Allyn\nare wanted in the Captain's quarters.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChase was there--toying with the seals of a thin, brown envelope. \"I\nhave to open this in the presence of at least two officers,\" he said\nnodding at Allyn who came in behind me. \"You two are senior on the ship\nand have the first right to know.\" He slid a finger through the flap.\n\n\"Effective 12, Eightmonth, GY2964,\" he read, \"USN 'Lachesis' will\nproceed on offensive mission against enemy vessels as part of advance\ncovering screen Fleet Four for major effort against enemy via sectors YD\n274, YD 275, and YD 276. Entire Scouting Force IV quadrant will be\ngrouped as Fleet Four Screen Unit under command Rear Admiral SIMMS.\nInitial station 'Lachesis' coordinates X 06042 Y 1327 Betelgeuse-Rigel\nbaseline. ETA Rendezvous point 0830 plus or minus 30, 13/8/64.\n\n\"A. Evars, Fleet Admiral USN Commanding.\"\n\nThere it was! I could see Allyn stiffen as a peculiar sick look crossed\nChase's dry face. And suddenly I heard all the ugly little\nnicknames--Subspace Chase, Gutless Gus, Cautious Charley--and the dozen\nothers. For Chase was afraid. It was so obvious that not even the gray\nmask of his face could cover it.\n\nYet his voice when he spoke was the same dry, pedantic voice of old.\n\"You have the rendezvous point, Mr. Marsden. Have Mr. Esterhazy set the\ncourse and speed to arrive on time.\" He dismissed us with the\ntraditional \"That's all, gentlemen,\" and we went out separate ways. I\ndidn't want to look at the triumphant smile on Allyn's face.\n\nWe hit rendezvous at 0850, picked up a message from the Admiral at 0853,\nand at 0855 were on our way. We were part of a broad hemispherical\nscreen surrounding the Cruiser Force which englobed the Line and supply\ntrain--the heavies that are the backbone of any fleet. We were headed\nroughly in the direction of the Rebel's fourth sector, the one top-heavy\nwith metals industries. Our exact course was known only to the brass and\nthe computers that planned our interlock. But where we were headed\nwasn't important. The \"Lachesis\" was finally going to war! I could feel\nthe change in the crew, the nervousness, the anticipation, the adrenal\nresponses of fear and excitement. After a year in the doldrums, Fleet\nwas going to try to smash the Rebels again. We hadn't done so well last\ntime, getting ambushed in the Fifty Suns group and damn near losing our\nshirts before we managed to get out. The Rebs weren't as good as we\nwere, but they were trickier, and they could fight. After all, why\nshouldn't they be able to? They were human, just as we were, and any one\nof a dozen extinct intelligent races could testify to our fighting\nability, as could others not-quite-extinct. Man ruled this section of\nthe galaxy, and someday if he didn't kill himself off in the process\nhe'd rule all of it. He wasn't the smartest race but he was the\nhungriest, the fiercest, the most adaptable, and the most unrelenting.\nQualities which, by the way, were exactly the ones needed to conquer a\nhostile universe.\n\nBut mankind was slow to learn the greatest lesson, that they _had_ to\ncooperate if they were to go further. We were already living on borrowed\ntime. Before the War, ten of eleven exploration ships sent into the\ngalactic center had disappeared without a trace. Somewhere, buried deep\nin the billions of stars that formed the galactic hub, was a race that\nwas as tough and tricky as we were--maybe even tougher. This was common\nknowledge, for the eleventh ship had returned with the news of the\naliens, a story of hairbreadth escape from destruction, and a pattern of\ntheir culture which was enough like ours to frighten any thinking man.\nThe worlds near the center of humanity's sphere realized the situation\nat once and quickly traded their independence for a Federal Union to\npool their strength against the threat that might come any day.\n\nBut as the Union Space Navy began to take shape on the dockyards of\nEarth and a hundred other worlds, the independent worlds of the\nperiphery began to eye the Union with suspicion. They had never believed\nthe exploration report and didn't want to unite with the worlds of the\ncenter. They thought that the Union was a trick to deprive them of their\nfiercely cherished independence, and when the Union sent embassies to\ninvite them into the common effort, they rejected them. And when we\nsuggested that in the interests of racial safety they abandon their\nhaphazard colonization efforts that resulted in an uncontrolled series\nof jumps into the dark, punctuated by minor wars and clashes when\ncolonists from separate origins landed, more or less simultaneously, on\na promising planet, they were certain we were up to no good.\n\nAlthough we explained and showed them copies of the exploration ship's\nreport, they were not convinced. Demagogues among them screamed about\nmanifest destiny, independence, interference in internal affairs, and a\nthousand other things that made the diplomatic climate between Center\nand Periphery unbearably hot. And their colonists kept moving outward.\n\nOf course the Union was not about to cooperate in this potential race\nsuicide. We simply couldn't allow them to give that other race knowledge\nof our whereabouts until we were ready for them. So we informed each of\nthe outer worlds that we would consider any further efforts at\ncolonizing an unfriendly act, and would take steps to discourage it.\n\nThat did it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe halted a few colonizing ships and sent them home under guard. We\nuprooted a few advance groups and returned them to their homeworlds. We\nestablished a series of observation posts to check further\nexpansion--and six months later we were at war.\n\nThe outer worlds formed what they called a defensive league and with\ncharacteristic human rationality promptly attacked us. Naturally, they\ndidn't get far. We had a bigger and better fleet and we were organized\nwhile they were not. And so they were utterly defeated at the Battle of\nOphiuchus.\n\nIt was then that we had two choices. We could either move in and take\nover their defenseless worlds, or we could let them rebuild and get\nstrong, and with their strength acquire a knowledge of cooperation--and\ntake the chance that they would ultimately beat us. Knowing this, we\nwisely chose the second course and set about teaching our fellow men a\nlesson that was now fifteen years along and not ended yet.\n\nBy applying pressure at the right places we turned their attention\ninward to us rather than to the outside, and by making carefully timed\nsorties here and there about the periphery we forced them through sheer\nmilitary necessity to gradually tighten their loosely organized League\ninto tightly centralized authority, with the power to demand and\nobtain--to meet our force with counterforce. By desperate measures and\nstraining of all their youthful resources they managed to hold us off.\nAnd with every strain they were welded more tightly together. And\nslowly they were learning through war what we could not teach through\npeace.\n\nCuriously enough, they wouldn't believe our aims even when captured\ncrews told them. They thought it was some sort of tricky mental\nconditioning designed to frustrate their lie detectors. Even while they\ntightened their organization and built new fleets, they would not\nbelieve that we were forcing them into the paths they must travel to\navoid future annihilation.\n\nIt was one of the ironies of this war that it was fought and would be\nfought with the best of intentions. For it was obvious now that we could\nnever win--nor could they. The Rebels, as we called them, were every\nwhit as strong as we, and while we enjoyed the advantages of superior\nposition and technology they had the advantage of superior numbers. It\nwas stalemate,--the longest, fiercest stalemate in man's bloody history.\nBut it was stalemate with a purpose. It was a crazy war--a period of\nconstant hostilities mingled with sporadic offensive actions like the\none we were now engaged in--but to us, at least, it was war with a\npurpose--the best and noblest of human purposes--the preservation of the\nrace.\n\nThe day was coming, not too many years away, when the first of the\naliens would strike the Outer worlds. Then we would unite--on the\nLeague's terms if need be--to crush the invaders and establish mankind\nas the supreme race in the galaxy.\n\nBut this wasn't important right now. Right now I was the Executive\nOfficer of a scout ship commanded by a man I didn't trust. He smelled\ntoo much like a stinking coward. I shook my head. Having Chase running\nthe ship was like putting a moron in a jet car on one of the\nsuperhighways--and then sabotaging the automatics. Just one fearful\nmistake and a whole squadron could be loused up. But Chase was the\ncommander--the ultimate authority on this ship. All I could do was pray\nthat things were going to come out all right.\n\nWe moved out in the lower red. Battles weren't fought in Cth. There was\nno way to locate a unit at firing range in that monochromatic madness.\nNormal physical laws simply didn't apply. A ship had to come out into\nthreespace to do any damage. All Cth was was a convenient road to the\nbattlefront.\n\nWith one exception.\n\nBy hanging in the infra band, on the ragged edge of threespace, a scout\nship could remain concealed until a critical moment, breakout into\nthreespace--discharge her weapons--and flick back into Cth before an\nenemy could get a fix on her. Scouts, with their high capacity\nconverters, could perform this maneuver, but the ponderous battlewagons\nand cruisers with their tremendous weight of armor, screens, and\nmunitions couldn't maneuver like this. They simply didn't have the\nagility. Yet only they had the ability to penetrate defensive screens\nand kill the Rebel heavies. So space battle was conducted on the classic\npattern--the Lines slugging it out at medium range while the screen of\nscouts buzzed around and through the battle trying to add their weight\nof metal against some overstrained enemy and ensure his destruction. A\nmajor battle could go on for days--and it often did. In the Fifty Suns\naction the battle had lasted nearly two weeks subjective before we\nwithdrew to lick our wounds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor nearly a day we ran into nothing, and such are the distances that\nseparate units of a fleet, we had the impression that we were alone. We\nmoved quietly, detectors out, scanning the area for a light-day around\nas we moved forward at less than one Lume through Cth. More would have\nbeen fatal for had we been forced to resort to a quick breakout to avoid\nenemy action, and if we were travelling above one Lume when we hit\nthreespace, we'd simply disappear, leaving a small spatial vortex in our\nwake.\n\nOn the \"morning\" of the third day the ships at the apex of Quadrant One\nran into a flight of Rebel scouts. There was a brief flurry of action,\nthe Rebels were englobed, a couple of cruisers drove in, latched onto\nthe helplessly straining Rebel scouts and dragged them into threespace.\nThe Rebs kept broadcasting right up to the end--after which they\nsurrendered before the cruisers could annihilate them. Smart boys.\n\nBut the Rebels were warned. We couldn't catch all their scouts and the\ndisturbance our Line was making in Cth would register on any detector\nwithin twenty parsecs. So they would be waiting to meet us. But that was\nto be expected. There is no such thing as surprise in a major action.\n\nWe went on until we began to run into major opposition. Half a dozen\nscouts were caught in englobements at half a dozen different places\nalong the periphery as they came in contact with the Rebels' covering\nforces. And that was that. The advance halted waiting for the Line to\ncome up, and a host of small actions took place as the forward screening\nforces collided. Chase was in the control chair, hanging in the\nblackness of the infra band on the edge of normal space. But we weren't\nflicking in and out of threespace like some of the others. We had a\nprobe out and the main buffeting was taken by the duralloy tube with its\ntiny converter at its bulbous tip. With consummate pilotage Chase was\nholding us in infra. It was a queasy sensation, hanging halfway between\nnormalcy and chaos, and I had to admire his skill. The infra band was\nblack as ink and hot as the hinges of hell--and since the edges of\nthreespace and Cth are not as knife sharp as they are further up in the\nCth components, we bucked and shuddered on the border, but avoided the\nbone-crushing slams and gut-wrenching twists that less skillful skippers\nwere giving their ships as they flicked back and forth between\nthreespace and Cth. Our scouting line must have been a peculiar sight to\na threespace observer with the thousand or so scouts flickering in and\nout of sight across a huge hemisphere of space.\n\nAnd then we saw them. Our probe picked up the flicker of enemy scouts.\n\n\"Action imminent,\" Chase said drily. \"Stand by.\"\n\nI clapped the other control helmet over my head and dropped into the\nExec's chair. A quick check showed the crew at their stations, the\ntorpedo hatches clear, the antiradiation shields up and the ship in\nfighting trim. I stole a quick glance at Chase. Sweat stood out on his\ngray forehead. His lips were drawn back into a thin line, showing his\nteeth. His face was tense, but whether with fear or excitement I didn't\nknow.\n\n\"Stand by,\" he said, and then we hit threespace, just as the enormous\ncone of the Rebel Line flicked into sight. The enemy line had taken the\nfield, and under the comparatively slow speeds of threespace was rushing\nforward to meet our Line which had emerged a few minutes ago. Our\nlaunchers flamed as we sent a salvo of torpedoes whistling toward the\nRebel fleet marking perhaps the opening shots of the main battle. We\ntwisted back into Cth as one of the scanner men doubled over with agony,\nheaving his guts out into a disposal cone. I felt sorry for him. The\ntension, the racking agony of our motion, and the fact that he was\nprobably in his first major battle had all combined to take him for the\ncount. He grinned greenly at me and turned back to his dials and\ninstruments. Good man!\n\n\"Target--range one eight zero four, azimuth two four oh, elevation one\noh seven,\" the rangefinder reported. \"Mass four.\" Mass four:--a cruiser.\n\n\"Stand by,\" Chase said. \"All turrets prepare to fire.\" And he took us\ndown. We slammed into threespace and our turrets flamed. To our left\nrear and above hung the mass of an enemy cruiser, her screens glowing on\nstandby as she drove forward to her place in the line. We had caught her\nby surprise, a thousand to one shot, and our torpedoes were on their way\nbefore her detectors spotted us. We didn't stay to see what happened,\nbut the probe showed an enormous fireball which blazed briefly in the\nblackness, shooting out globs of scintillating molten metal that cooled\nand disappeared as we watched.\n\n\"Scratch one cruiser,\" someone in fire control yelped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe effect on morale was electric. In that instant all doubts of Chase's\nability disappeared. All except mine. One lucky shot isn't a battle, and\nI guess Chase figured the same way because his hands were shaking as he\njockeyed us along on the edge of Cth. He looked like he wanted to vomit.\n\n\"Take it easy, skipper,\" I said.\n\n\"Mind your own business, Marsden--and I'll mind mine,\" Chase snapped.\n\"Stand by,\" he ordered, and we dove into threespace again--loosed\nanother salvo at another Reb, and flicked out of sight. And that was the\nway it went for hour after hour until we pulled out, our last torpedo\nfired and the crew on the ragged edge of exhaustion. Somehow, by some\nmiracle compounded of luck and good pilotage, we were unmarked. And\nChase, despite his twitching face and shaking hands, was one hell of a\ncombat skipper! I didn't wonder about him any more. He had the guts all\nright. But it was a different sort of courage from the icy contempt for\ndanger that marked Andy Royce. Even so, I couldn't help thinking that I\nwas glad to be riding with Chase. We drove to the rear, heading for the\nsupply train, our ammunition expended, while behind us the battlewagons\nand cruisers were hammering each other to metal pulp.\n\nIn the quiet of the rear area it was hardly believable that a major\nbattle was going on ahead of us. We raised the \"Amphitrite,\" identified\nourselves, and put in a request for supply.\n\n\"Lay aboard,\" \"Amphitrite\" signalled back. \"How's the war going?\"\n\n\"Don't know. We've been too busy,\" our signalman replied.\n\n\"I'll bet--you're 'Lachesis,' aren't you?\"\n\n\"Affirmative.\"\n\n\"How'd you lose your ammo? Jettison it?\"\n\n\"Stow that, you unprintable obscenity,\" Haskins replied. \"We're a\nfighting ship.\"\n\n\"Amphitrite\" chuckled nastily. \"That I'll believe when I see it!\"\n\n\"Communications,\" Chase snapped. \"This isn't a social call. Get our\nheading and approach instructions.\" He sounded as schoolmasterish as\never, but there was a sickly smile on his face, and the gray-green look\nwas gone.\n\n\"Morale seems a little better, doesn't it, Marsden?\" he said to me as\nthe \"Amphitrite\" flicked out into threespace and we followed.\n\nI nodded. \"Yes, sir,\" I agreed. \"Quite a little.\"\n\nOur cargo hatches snapped open and we cuddled up against \"Amphitrite's\"\nbulging belly while our crew and the supply echelon worked like demons\nto transfer ammunition. We had fifty torpedoes aboard when the I.F.F.\ndetector shrilled alarm.\n\nThree hundred feet above us the \"Amphitrite's\" main battery let loose a\nsalvo at three Rebel scouts that had flickered into being less than\nfifty miles away. Their launchers flared with a glow that lighted the\nblackness of space.\n\n\"Stand by!\" Chase yelled as he threw the converter on.\n\n\"Hatches!\" I screamed as we shimmered and vanished.\n\nSomehow we got most of them closed, losing only the crew on number two\nport turret which was still buttoning up as we slipped over into the\ninfra band. I ordered the turret sealed. Cth had already ruined the\nunshielded sighting mechanisms and I had already seen what happened to\nmen caught in Cth unprotected. I had no desire to see it again--or let\nour crew see it if it could be avoided. A human body turned inside out\nisn't the most wholesome of sights.\n\n\"How did _they_ get through?\" Chase muttered as we put out our probe.\n\n\"I don't know--maybe someone wasn't looking.\"\n\n\"What's it like down there?\" Chase asked. \"See anything?\"\n\n\"'Amphitrite's' still there,\" I said.\n\n\"She's _what_?\"\n\n\"Still there,\" I repeated. \"And she's in trouble.\"\n\n\"She's big. She can take it--but--\"\n\n\"Here, you look,\" I said, flipping the probe switch.\n\n\"My God!\" Chase muttered--as he took one look at the supply ship lying\ndead in space, her protective batteries flaming. She had gotten one of\nthe Rebel scouts but the other two had her bracketed and were pouring\nfire against her dim screens.\n\n\"She can't keep this up,\" I said. \"She's been hulled--and it looks like\nher power's taken it.\"\n\n\"Action imminent,\" Chase ordered, and the rangefinder took up his\nchant.\n\nWe came storming out of Cth right on top of one of the Rebel scouts. A\nviolent shock raced through the ship, slamming me against my web. The\nrebound sent us a good two miles away before our starboard battery\nflamed. The enemy scout, disabled by the shock, stunned and unable to\nmaneuver took the entire salvo amidships and disappeared in a puff of\nflame.\n\nThe second Rebel disappeared and we did too. She was back in Cth looking\nfor a better chance at the \"Amphitrite.\" The big ship was wallowing like\na wounded whale, half of one section torn away, her armor dented, and\nher tubes firing erratically.\n\nWe took one long look and jumped back into Cth. But not before Haskins\nbeamed a message to the supply ship. \"Now you've seen it, you damned\nstorekeeper,\" he gloated. \"What do you think?\" \"Amphitrite\" didn't\nanswer.\n\n\"Probe out,\" Chase ordered, neglecting, I noticed, to comment on the\nsignalman's act.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI pushed the proper buttons but nothing happened. I pushed again and\nthen turned on the scanners. The one aft of the probe was half covered\nwith a twisted mass of metal tubing that had once been our probe. We\nmust have smashed it when we rammed. Quickly I shifted to the auxiliary\nprobe, but the crumpled mass had jammed the hatch. It wouldn't open.\n\n\"No probes, sir,\" I announced.\n\n\"Damn,\" Chase said. \"Well, we'll have to do without them. Hold tight,\nwe're going down.\"\n\nWe flicked into threespace just in time to see a volcano of fire erupt\nfrom \"Amphitrite's\" side and the metallic flick of the Rebel scout\nslipping back into Cth.\n\n\"What's your situation, 'Amphitrite'?\" our signal asked.\n\n\"Not good,\" the faint answer came back. \"They've got us in the power\nroom and our accumulators aren't going to stand this load very long.\nThat last salvo went through our screens, but our armor stopped it. But\nif the screens go down--\"\n\nOur batteries flared at the Rebel as he again came into sight. He didn't\nwait, but flicked right back into Cth without firing a shot. Pollard was\non the ball.\n\n\"Brave lad, that Reb,\" Chase said. There was a sneer in his voice.\n\nFor the moment it was stalemate. The Reb wasn't going to come into close\nrange with a warship of equal power to his own adding her metal to the\n\"Amphitrite's,\" but he could play cat and mouse with us, drawing our\nfire until we had used up our torpedoes, and then come in to finish\nthe supply ship. Or he could harass us with long range fire. Or he could\ngo away.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIt was certain he wouldn't do the last, and he'd be a fool if he did the\nsecond. \"Amphitrite\" could set up a mine screen that would take care of\nany long range stuff,--and we could dodge it. His probe was still\nworking and he had undoubtedly seen ours crushed against our hull. If he\nhadn't he was blind--and that wasn't a Rebel characteristic. We could\nhyper, of course, but we were blind up there in Cth. His best was to\nkeep needling us, and take the chance that we'd run out of torps.\n\n\"What's our munition?\" Chase asked almost as an echo to my thought. I\nswitched over to Pollard.\n\n\"Thirty mark sevens,\" Pollard said, \"and a little small arms.\"\n\n\"One good salvo,\" Chase said, thoughtfully.\n\nThe Rebel flashed in and out again, and we let go a burst.\n\n\"Twenty, now,\" I said.\n\nChase didn't hear me. He was busy talking to Allyn on damage control.\n\"You can't cut it, hey?--All right--disengage the converter on the\nauxiliary probe and break out that roll of duralloy cable in the\nstores--Pollard! don't fire over one torp at a time when that lad shows\nup. Load the other launchers with blanks. Make him think we're shooting.\nWe have to keep him hopping. Now listen to me--Yes, Allyn, I mean you.\nFasten that converter onto the cable and stand by. We're going to make a\nprobe.\" Chase turned to me.\n\n\"You were Exec with Royce,\" he said. \"You should know how to fight a\nship.\"\n\n\"What are you planning to do?\" I asked.\n\n\"We can't hold that Rebel off. Maybe with ammunition we could, but\nthere's less than a salvo aboard and he has the advantage of position.\nWe can't be sure he won't try to take us in spite of 'Amphitrite's'\nsupport and if he does finish us, 'Amphitrite's' a dead duck.\" The\n\"Lachesis\" quivered as the port turrets belched flame. \"That leaves\nnineteen torpedoes,\" he said. \"In Cth we're safe enough but we're\nhelpless without a probe. Yet we can only get into attack position from\nCth. That leaves us only one thing to do--improvise a probe.\"\n\n\"And how do you do that?\" I asked.\n\n\"Put a man out on a line--with the converter from the auxiliary. Give\nhim a command helmet and have him talk the ship in.\"\n\n\"But that's suicide!\"\n\n\"No, Marsden, not suicide--just something necessary. A necessary\nsacrifice, like this whole damned war! I don't believe in killing men.\nIt makes me sick. But I kill if I have to, and sacrifice if I must.\" His\nface twisted and the gray-green look came back. \"There are over a\nthousand men on the 'Amphitrite,' and a vital cargo of munitions. One\nlife, I think, is fair trade for a thousand, just as a few hundred\nthousand is fair trade for a race.\" The words were schoolmasterish and\nwould have been dead wrong coming from anyone except Chase. But he gave\nthem an air of reasonable inevitability. And for a moment I forgot that\nhe was cold-bloodedly planning someone's death. For a moment I felt the\nspirit of sacrifice that made heroes out of ordinary people.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Look, skipper,\" I said. \"How about letting me do it?\" I could have\nkicked myself a moment later, but the words were out before I could stop\nthem. He had me acting noble, and that trait isn't one of my strong\nsuits.\n\nHe smiled. \"You know, Marsden,\" he said, \"I was expecting that.\" His\nvoice was oddly soft. \"Thanks.\" Then it became dry and impersonal.\n\"Request denied,\" he said. \"This is my party.\"\n\nI shivered inside. While I'm no coward, I didn't relish the thought of\nslamming around at the end of a duralloy cable stretching into a nowhere\nwhere there was no inertia. A hair too heavy a hand on the throttle in\nCth would crush the man on the end to a pulp. But he shouldn't go\neither. It was his responsibility to command the ship.\n\n\"Who else is qualified?\" Chase said answering the look on my face. \"I\nknow more about maneuver than any man aboard, and I'll be controlling\nthe ship until the last moment. Once I order the attack I'll cut free,\nand you can pick me up later.\"\n\n\"You won't have time,\" I protested.\n\n\"Just in case I don't make it,\" Chase continued, making the\nunderstatement of the war with a perfectly straight face, \"take care of\nthe crew. They're a good bunch--just a bit too eager for the _real_\nNavy--but good. I've tried to make them into spacemen and they've\nresented me for it. I've tried to protect them and they've hated me--\"\n\n\"They won't now--\" I interrupted.\n\n\"I've tried to make them a unit.\" He went on as though I hadn't said a\nthing. \"Maybe I've tried too hard, but I'm responsible for every life\naboard this ship.\" He picked up his helmet. \"Take command of the ship,\nMr. Marsden,\" he said, and strode out of the room. The \"Lachesis\"\nshuddered to the recoil from the port turrets. Eighteen torpedoes left,\nI thought.\n\nWe lowered Chase a full hundred feet on the thin strand of duralloy. He\ndangled under the ship, using his converter to keep the line taut.\n\n\"You hear me, skipper?\" I asked.\n\n\"Clearly--and you?\"\n\n\"Four-four. Hang on now--we're going up.\" I eased the \"Lachesis\" into\nCth and hung like glue to the border. \"How's it going, skipper?\"\n\n\"A bit rough but otherwise all right. Now steer right--easy now--aagh!\"\n\n\"Skipper!\"\n\n\"Okay, Marsden. You nearly pulled me in half--that's all. You did fine.\nWe're in good position in relation to 'Amphitrite.' Now let's get our\nsignals straight. Front is the way we're going now--base all my\ndirections on that--got it?\"\n\n\"Aye, sir.\"\n\n\"Good, Marsden, throttle back and hang on your converters.\"\n\nI did as I was told.\n\n\"Ah--there she is--bear left a little. Hmm--she's looking for us--looks\nsuspicious. Now she's turning toward 'Amphitrite.' Guess she figures we\nare gone. She's in position preparing to fire. _Now!_ Drop out and\nfire--elevation zero, azimuth three sixty--_Move!_\"\n\nI moved. The \"Lachesis\" dropped like a stone. Chase was dead now.\nNothing made of flesh could survive that punishment but we--we came out\nright on top of them, just like Chase had done to the other--except that\nwe fired before we collided. And as with the other Rebel we gained\ncomplete surprise. Our eighteen torpedoes crashed home, her magazines\nexploded, and into that hell of molten and vaporized metal that had once\nbeen a Rebel scout we crashed a split second later. Two thousand miles\nper second relative is too fast for even an explosion to hurt much if\nthere isn't any solid material in the way, and we passed through only\nthe outer edges of the blast, but even so, the vaporized metal scoured\nour starboard plating down to the insulation. It was like a giant emery\nwheel had passed across our flank. The shock slammed us out of control\nand we went tumbling in crazy gyrations across space for several minutes\nbefore I could flip the \"Lachesis\" into Cth, check the speed and motion,\nand get back into threespace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChase was gone--and \"Lachesis\" was done. A week in drydock and she'd be\nas good as new, but she was no longer a fighting ship. She was a wreck.\nFor us the battle was over--but somehow it didn't make me happy. The\n\"Amphitrite\" hung off our port bow, a tiny silver dot in the distance,\nand as I watched two more silver dots winked into being beside her.\nHaskins reported the I.F.F. readings.\n\n\"They're ours,\" he said. \"A couple of cruisers.\"\n\n\"They should have been here ten minutes ago,\" I replied bitterly. I\ncouldn't see very well. You can't when emotion clogs your tubes.\nChase--coward?--not him. He was man clear through--a better one than I'd\never be even if I lived out my two hundred years. I wondered if the crew\nknew what sort of man their skipper was. I turned up the command helmet.\n\"Men--\" I began, but I didn't finish.\n\n\"We know,\" the blended thoughts and voices came back at me. Sure they\nknew! Chase had been on command circuit too. It was enough to make you\ncry--the mixture of pride, sadness and shame that rang through the\nhelmet. It seemed to echo and reecho for a long time before I shut it\noff.\n\nI sat there, thinking. I wasn't mad at the Rebels. I wasn't anything.\nAll I could think was that we were paying a pretty grim price for\nsurvival. Those aliens had better show up pretty soon--and they'd better\nbe as nasty as their reputation. There was a score--a big score--and I\nwanted to be there when it was added up and settled.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ December 1960.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
