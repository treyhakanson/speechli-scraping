He had learned to make\nhis tall, bony body seem all loose-jointed relaxation, no matter what he\nfelt. But the oversized hands in his pockets were clenched so tightly\nthat the nails were cutting into his palms.\n\nEvery tick of the old-fashioned clock sent a throb racing through his\nbrain. Every rustle of the pages seemed to release a fresh shot of\nadrenalin into his blood stream. _This time_, his mind was pleading. _It\nhas to be right this time...._\n\nJordan finished his reading and shoved the folder back. He reached for\nhis pipe, sighed, and then nodded slowly. \"A nice job of researching,\nPhillips. And it might make a good feature for the Sunday section, at\nthat.\"\n\nIt took a second to realize that the words meant acceptance, for\nPhillips had prepared himself too thoroughly against another failure.\nNow he felt the tautened muscles release, so quickly that he would have\nfallen if he hadn't been braced against the seat.\n\nHe groped in his mind, hunting for words, and finding none. There was\nonly the hot, sudden flame of unbelieving hope. And then an almost\nblinding exultation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJordan didn't seem to notice his silence. The editor made a neat pile of\nthe notes, nodding again. \"Sure. I like it. We've been short of shock\nstuff lately and the readers go for it when we can get a fresh angle.\nBut naturally you'd have to leave out all that nonsense on Blanding.\nHell, the man's just buried, and his relatives and friends--\"\n\n\"But that's the proof!\" Phillips stared at the editor, trying to\npenetrate through the haze of hope that had somehow grown chilled and\nunreal. His thoughts were abruptly disorganized and out of his control.\nOnly the urgency remained. \"It's the key evidence. And we've got to move\nfast! I don't know how long it takes, but even one more day may be too\nlate!\"\n\nJordan nearly dropped the pipe from his lips as he jerked upright to\npeer sharply at the younger man. \"Are you crazy? Do you seriously expect\nme to get an order to exhume him now? What would it get us, other than\nlawsuits? Even if we could get the order without cause--which we can't!\"\n\nThen the pipe did fall as he gaped open-mouthed. \"My God, you believe\nall that stuff. You expected us to publish it _straight_!\"\n\n\"No,\" Dane said thickly. The hope was gone now, as if it had never\nexisted, leaving a numb emptiness where nothing mattered. \"No, I guess I\ndidn't really expect anything. But I believe the facts. Why shouldn't\nI?\"\n\nHe reached for the papers with hands he could hardly control and began\nstuffing them back into the folder. All the careful documentation, the\nfingerprints--smudged, perhaps, in some cases, but still evidence enough\nfor anyone but a fool--\n\n\"Phillips?\" Jordan said questioningly to himself, and then his voice was\ntaking on a new edge. \"Phillips! Wait a minute, I've got it now! _Dane_\nPhillips, not _Arthur_! Two years on the _Trib._ Then you turned up on\nthe _Register_ in Seattle? Phillip Dean, or some such name there.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Dane agreed. There was no use in denying anything now. \"Yeah,\nDane Arthur Phillips. So I suppose I'm through here?\"\n\nJordan nodded again and there was a faint look of fear in his\nexpression. \"You can pick up your pay on the way out. And make it\nquick, before I change my mind and call the boys in white!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt could have been worse. It had been worse before. And there was enough\nin the pay envelope to buy what he needed--a flash camera, a little\nfolding shovel from one of the surplus houses, and a bottle of good\nscotch. It would be dark enough for him to taxi out to Oakhaven\nCemetery, where Blanding had been buried.\n\nIt wouldn't change the minds of the fools, of course. Even if he could\ndrag back what he might find, without the change being completed, they\nwouldn't accept the evidence. He'd been crazy to think anything could\nchange their minds. And they called _him_ a fanatic! If the facts he'd\ndug up in ten years of hunting wouldn't convince them, nothing would.\nAnd yet he had to see for himself, before it was too late!\n\nHe picked a cheap hotel at random and checked in under an assumed name.\nHe couldn't go back to his room while there was a chance that Jordan\nstill might try to turn him in. There wouldn't be time for Sylvia's\ndetectives to bother him, probably, but there was the ever-present\ndanger that one of the aliens might intercept the message.\n\nHe shivered. He'd been risking that for ten years, yet the likelihood\nwas still a horror to him. The uncertainty made it harder to take than\nany human-devised torture could be. There was no way of guessing what an\nalien might do to anyone who discovered that all men were not\nhuman--that some were ... zombies.\n\nThere was the classic syllogism: _All men are mortal; I am a man;\ntherefore, I am mortal._ But not Blanding--or Corporal Harding.\n\nIt was Harding's \"death\" that had started it all during the fighting on\nGuadalcanal. A grenade had come flying into the foxhole where Dane and\nHarding had felt reasonably safe. The concussion had knocked Dane out,\npossibly saving his life when the enemy thought he was dead. He'd come\nto in the daylight to see Harding lying there, mangled and twisted, with\nhis throat torn. There was blood on Dane's uniform, obviously spattered\nfrom the dead man. It hadn't been a mistake or delusion; Harding had\nbeen dead.\n\nIt had taken Dane two days of crawling and hiding to get back to his\ngroup, too exhausted to report Harding's death. He'd slept for twenty\nhours. And when he awoke, Harding had been standing beside him, with a\nwhole throat and a fresh uniform, grinning and kidding him for running\noff and leaving a stunned friend behind.\n\nIt was no ringer, but Harding himself, complete to the smallest personal\nmemories and personality traits.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe pressures of war probably saved Dane's sanity while he learned to\nface the facts. All men are mortal; Harding is not mortal; therefore,\nHarding is not a man! Nor was Harding alone--Dane found enough evidence\nto know there were others.\n\nThe _Tribune_ morgue yielded even more data. A man had faced seven\nfiring squads and walked away. Another survived over a dozen attacks by\nprofessional killers. Fingerprints turned up mysteriously \"copied\" from\nthose of men long dead. Some of the aliens seemed to heal almost\ninstantly; others took days. Some operated completely alone; some seemed\nto have joined with others. But they were legion.\n\nLack of a clearer pattern of attack made him consider the possibility of\nhuman mutation, but such tissue was too wildly different, and the\ninvasion had begun long before atomics or X-rays. He gave up trying to\nunderstand their alien motivations. It was enough that they existed in\nsecret, slowly growing in numbers while mankind was unaware of them.\n\nWhen his proof was complete and irrefutable, he took it to his\neditor--to be fired, politely but coldly. Other editors were less\npolite. But he went on doggedly trying and failing. What else could he\ndo? Somehow, he had to find the few people who could recognize facts and\nwarn them. The aliens would get him, of course, when the story broke,\nbut a warned humanity could cope with them. _Ye shall know the truth,\nand the truth shall make you free._\n\nThen he met Sylvia by accident after losing his fifth job--a girl who\nhad inherited a fortune big enough to spread his message in paid ads\nacross the country. They were married before he found she was\nhard-headed about her money. She demanded a full explanation for every\ncent beyond his allowance. In the end, she got the explanation. And\nwhile he was trying to cash the check she gave him, she visited Dr.\nBuehl, to come back with a squad of quiet, refined strong-arm boys who\nmade sure Dane reached Buehl's \"rest home\" safely.\n\nHydrotherapy ... Buehl as the kindly firm father image ... analysis ...\nhypnosis that stripped every secret from him, including his worst\nchildhood nightmare.\n\nHis father had committed a violent, bloody suicide after one of the many\nquarrels with Dane's mother. Dane had found the body.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTwo nights after the funeral, he had dreamed of his father's face,\nhorror-filled, at the window. He knew now that it was a normal\nnightmare, caused by being forced to look at the face in the coffin, but\nthe shock had lasted for years. It had bothered him again, after his\ndiscovery of the aliens, until a thorough check had proved without doubt\nthat his father had been fully human, with a human, if tempestuous,\nchildhood behind him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDr. Buehl was delighted. \"You see, Dane? You _know_ it was a nightmare,\nbut you don't really believe it even now. Your father was an alien\nmonster to you--no adult is quite human to a child. And that\nliteral-minded self, your subconscious, saw him after he died. So there\nare alien monsters who return from death. Then you come to from a\nconcussion. Harding is sprawled out unconscious, covered with\nblood--probably your blood, since you say he wasn't wounded, later.\n\n\"But after seeing your father, you can't associate blood with\nyourself--you see it as a horrible wound on Harding. When he turns out\nto be alive, you're still in partial shock, with your subconscious\ndominant. And that has the answer already. There are monsters who come\nback from the dead! An exaggerated reaction, but nothing really\nabnormal. We'll have you out of here in no time.\"\n\nNo non-directive psychiatry for Buehl. The man beamed paternally,\nchuckling as he added what he must have considered the clincher.\n\"Anyhow, even zombies can't stand fire, Dane, so you can stop worrying\nabout Harding. I checked up on him. He was burned to a crisp in a hotel\nfire two months ago.\"\n\nIt was logical enough to shake Dane's faith, until he came across Milo\nBlanding's picture in a magazine article on society in St. Louis.\nAccording to the item, Milo was a cousin of _the_ Blandings, whose\nfather had vanished in Chile as a young man, and who had just rejoined\nthe family. The picture was of Harding!\n\nAn alien could have gotten away by simply committing suicide and being\ncarried from the rest home, but Dane had to do it the hard way, watching\nhis chance and using commando tactics on a guard who had come to accept\nhim as a harmless nut.\n\nIn St. Louis, he'd used the \"Purloined Letter\" technique to hide--going\nback to newspaper work and using almost his real name. It had seemed to\nwork, too. But he'd been less lucky about Harding-Blanding. The man had\nbeen in Europe on some kind of a tour until his return only this last\nweek.\n\nDane had seen him just once then--but long enough to be sure it was\nHarding--before he died again.\n\nThis time, it was in a drunken auto accident that seemed to be none of\nhis fault, but left his body a mangled wreck.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was almost dark when Dane dismissed the taxi at the false address, a\nmile from the entrance to the cemetery. He watched it turn back down the\nroad, then picked up the valise with his camera and folding shovel. He\nshivered as he moved reluctantly ahead. War had proved that he would\nnever be a brave man and the old fears of darkness and graveyards were\nstill strong in him. But he had to know what the coffin contained now,\nif it wasn't already too late.\n\nIt represented the missing link in his picture of the aliens. What\nhappened to them during the period of regrowth? Did they revert to their\nnatural form? Were they at all conscious while the body reshaped itself\ninto wholeness? Dane had puzzled over it night after night, with no\nanswer.\n\nNor could he figure how they could escape from the grave. Perhaps a man\ncould force his way out of some of the coffins he had inspected. The\nsoil would still be soft and loose in the grave and a lot of the coffins\nand the boxes around them were strong in appearance only. A determined\ncreature that could exist without much air for long enough might make\nit. But there were other caskets that couldn't be cracked, at least\nwithout the aid of outside help.\n\nWhat happened when a creature that could survive even the poison of\nembalming fluids and the draining of all the blood woke up in such a\ncoffin? Dane's mind skittered from it, as always, and then came back to\nit reluctantly.\n\nThere were still accounts of corpses turned up with the nails and hair\ngrown long in the grave. Could normal tissues stand the current tricks\nof the morticians to have life enough for such growth? The possibility\nwas absurd. Those cases had to be aliens--ones who hadn't escaped. Even\nthey must die eventually in such a case--after weeks and months! It took\ntime for hair to grow.\n\nAnd there were stories of corpses that had apparently fought and twisted\nin their coffins still. What was it like for an alien then, going slowly\nmad while it waited for true death? How long did madness take?\n\nHe shivered again, but went steadily on while the cemetery fence\nappeared in the distance. He'd seen Blanding's coffin--and the big,\nsolid metal casket around it that couldn't be cracked by any amount of\neffort and strength. He was sure the creature was still there, unless it\nhad a confederate. But that wouldn't matter. An empty coffin would also\nbe proof.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDane avoided the main gate, unsure about whether there would be a\nwatchman or not. A hundred feet away, there was a tree near the\nornamental spikes of the iron fence. He threw his bag over and began\nshinnying up. It was difficult, but he made it finally, dropping onto\nthe soft grass beyond. There was the trace of the Moon at times through\nthe clouds, but it hadn't betrayed him, and there had been no alarm wire\nalong the top of the fence.\n\nHe moved from shadow to shadow, his hair prickling along the base of his\nneck. Locating the right grave in the darkness was harder than he had\nexpected, even with an occasional brief use of the small flashlight. But\nat last he found the marker that was serving until the regular monument\ncould arrive.\n\nHis hands were sweating so much that it was hard to use the small\nshovel, but the digging of foxholes had given him experience and the\nground was still soft from the gravediggers' work. He stopped once, as\nthe Moon came out briefly. Again, a sound in the darkness above left him\nhovering and sick in the hole. But it must have been only some animal.\n\nHe uncovered the top of the casket with hands already blistering.\n\nThen he cursed as he realized the catches were near the bottom, making\nhis work even harder.\n\nHe reached them at last, fumbling them open. The metal top of the casket\nseemed to be a dome of solid lead, and he had no room to maneuver, but\nit began swinging up reluctantly, until he could feel the polished wood\nof the coffin.\n\nDane reached for the lid with hands he could barely control. Fear was\nthick in his throat now. What could an alien do to a man who discovered\nit? Would it be Harding there--or some monstrous thing still changing?\nHow long did it take a revived monster to go mad when it found no way to\nescape?\n\nHe gripped the shovel in one hand, working at the lid with the other.\nNow, abruptly, his nerves steadied, as they had done whenever he was in\nreal battle. He swung the lid up and began groping for the camera.\n\nHis hand went into the silk-lined interior and found nothing! He was too\nlate. Either Harding had gotten out somehow before the final ceremony or\na confederate had already been here. The coffin was empty.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were no warning sounds this time--only hands that slipped under\nhis arms and across his mouth, lifting him easily from the grave. A\nmatch flared briefly and he was looking into the face of Buehl's chief\nstrong-arm man.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Phillips. Promise to be quiet and we'll release you. Okay?\"\nAt Dane's sickened nod, he gestured to the others. \"Let him go. And,\nTom, better get that filled in. We don't want any trouble from this.\"\n\nSurprise came from the grave a moment later. \"Hey, Burke, there's no\ncorpse here!\"\n\nBurke's words killed any hopes Dane had at once. \"So what? Ever hear of\ncremation? Lots of people use a regular coffin for the ashes.\"\n\n\"He wasn't cremated,\" Dane told him. \"You can check up on that.\" But he\nknew it was useless.\n\n\"Sure, Mr. Phillips. We'll do that.\" The tone was one reserved for\nhumoring madmen. Burke turned, gesturing. \"Better come along, Mr.\nPhillips. Your wife and Dr. Buehl are waiting at the hotel.\"\n\nThe gate was open now, but there was no sign of a watchman; if one\nworked here, Sylvia's money would have taken care of that, of course.\nDane went along quietly, sitting in the rubble of his hopes while the\nbig car purred through the morning and on down Lindell Boulevard toward\nthe hotel. Once he shivered, and Burke dug out hot brandied coffee. They\nhad thought of everything, including a coat to cover his dirt-soiled\nclothes as they took him up the elevator to where Buehl and Sylvia were\nwaiting for him.\n\nShe had been crying, obviously, but there were no tears or\nrecriminations when she came over to kiss him. Funny, she must still\nlove him--as he'd learned to his surprise he loved her. Under different\ncircumstances ...\n\n\"So you found me?\" he asked needlessly of Buehl. He was operating on\npurely automatic habits now, the reaction from the night and his failure\nnumbing him emotionally. \"Jordan got in touch with you?\"\n\nBuehl smiled back at him. \"We knew where you were all along, Dane. But\nas long as you acted normal, we hoped it might be better than the home.\nToo bad we couldn't stop you before you got all mixed up in this.\"\n\n\"So I suppose I'm committed to your booby-hatch again?\"\n\nBuehl nodded, refusing to resent the term. \"I'm afraid so, Dane--for a\nwhile, anyhow. You'll find your clothes in that room. Why don't you\nclean up a little? Take a hot bath, maybe. You'll feel better.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDane went in, surprised when no guards followed him. But they had\nthought of everything. What looked like a screen on the window had been\nrecently installed and it was strong enough to prevent his escape.\nBlessed are the poor, for they shall be poorly guarded!\n\nHe was turning on the shower when he heard the sound of voices coming\nthrough the door. He left the water running and came back to listen.\nSylvia was speaking.\n\n\"--seems so logical, so completely rational.\"\n\n\"It makes him a dangerous person,\" Buehl answered, and there was no\nfalse warmth in his voice now. \"Sylvia, you've got to admit it to\nyourself. All the reason and analysis in the world won't convince him\nhe's wrong. This time we'll have to use shock treatment. Burn over those\nmemories, fade them out. It's the only possible course.\"\n\nThere was a pause and then a sigh. \"I suppose you're right.\"\n\nDane didn't wait to hear more. He drew back, while his mind fought to\naccept the hideous reality. Shock treatment! The works, if what he knew\nof psychiatry was correct. Enough of it to erase his memories--a part of\nhimself. It wasn't therapy Buehl was considering; it couldn't be.\n\nIt was the answer of an alien that had a human in its hands--one who\nknew too much!\n\nHe might have guessed. What better place for an alien than in the guise\nof a psychiatrist? Where else was there the chance for all the refined,\nmodern torture needed to burn out a man's mind? Dane had spent ten years\nin fear of being discovered by them--and now Buehl had him.\n\nSylvia? He couldn't be sure. Probably she was human. It wouldn't make\nany difference. There was nothing he could do through her. Either she\nwas part of the game or she really thought him mad.\n\nDane tried the window again, but it was hopeless. There would be no\nescape this time. Buehl couldn't risk it. The shock treatment--or\nwhatever Buehl would use under the name of shock treatment--would begin\nat once. It would be easy to slip, to use an overdose of something, to\nmake sure Dane was killed. Or there were ways of making sure it didn't\nmatter. They could leave him alive, but take his mind away.\n\nIn alien hands, human psychiatry could do worse than all the medieval\ntorture chambers!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sickness grew in his stomach as he considered the worst that could\nhappen. Death he could accept, if he had to. He could even face the\nchance of torture by itself, as he had accepted the danger while trying\nto have his facts published. But to have his mind taken from him, a step\nat a time--to watch his personality, his ego, rotted away under him--and\nto know that he would wind up as a drooling idiot....\n\nHe made his decision, almost as quickly as he had come to realize what\nBuehl must be.\n\nThere was a razor in the medicine chest. It was a safety razor, of\ncourse, but the blade was sharp and it would be big enough. There was no\ntime for careful planning. One of the guards might come in at any moment\nif they thought he was taking too long.\n\nSome fear came back as he leaned over the wash basin, staring at his\nthroat, fingering the suddenly murderous blade. But the pain wouldn't\nlast long--a lot less than there would be under shock treatment, and\nless pain. He'd read enough to feel sure of that.\n\nTwice he braced himself and failed at the last second. His mind flashed\nout in wild schemes, fighting against what it knew had to be done.\n\nThe world still had to be warned! If he could escape, somehow ... if he\ncould still find a way.... He couldn't quit, no matter how impossible\nthings looked.\n\nBut he knew better. There was nothing one man could do against the\naliens in this world they had taken over. He'd never had a chance. Man\nhad been chained already by carefully developed ridicule against\nsuperstition, by carefully indoctrinated gobbledegook about insanity,\npersecution complexes, and all the rest.\n\nFor a second, Dane even considered the possibility that he was insane.\nBut he knew it was only a blind effort to cling to life. There had been\nno insanity in him when he'd groped for evidence in the coffin and found\nit empty!\n\nHe leaned over the wash basin, his eyes focused on his throat, and his\nhand came down and around, carrying the razor blade through a lethal\nsemicircle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDane Phillips watched fear give place to sickness on his face as the\npain lanced through him and the blood spurted.\n\nHe watched horror creep up to replace the sickness while the bleeding\nstopped and the gash began closing.\n\nBy the time he recognized his expression as the same one he'd seen on\nhis father's face at the window so long ago, the wound was completely\nhealed.\n\n                                                      --LESTER DEL REY\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Galaxy Science Fiction_ November 1956.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
