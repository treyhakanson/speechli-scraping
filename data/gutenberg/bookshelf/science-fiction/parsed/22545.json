Neither\n                do we, but that doesn't necessarily mean\n                that there can be no other way for Earth\n                to get its last...._\n\n\n WARNING\n FROM THE STARS\n\n By RON COCKING\n\n ILLUSTRATOR SUMMERS\n\n\nIt was a beautifully machined container, shaped like a two pound\nchocolate candy box, the color and texture of lead. The cover fitted so\naccurately that it was difficult to see where it met the lip on the\nbase.\n\nYet when Forster lifted the container from the desk in the security\nguards' office, he almost hit himself in the face with it, so light was\nit.\n\nHe read the words clumsily etched by hand into the top surface with some\nsharp instrument:\n\n    TO BE OPENED ONLY BY:\n    Dr. Richard Forster,\n    Assistant Director,\n    Air Force Special Research Center,\n    Petersport, Md.\n\n    CAUTION: Open not later than\n    24 hours after receipt.\n\n    DO NOT OPEN in atmosphere less\n    than equivalent of 65,000 feet\n    above M.S.L.\n\nHe turned the container over and over. It bore no other markings--no\nexpress label or stamps, no file or reference number, no return address.\n\nIt was superbly machined, he saw.\n\nTentatively he pulled at the container cover, it was as firm as if it\nhad been welded on. But then, if the cover had been closed in the thin\natmosphere of 65,000 feet, it would be held on by the terrific pressure\nof a column of air twelve miles high.\n\nForster looked up at the burly guard.\n\n\"Who left this here?\"\n\n\"Your guess is as good as mine, sir.\" The man's voice was as close to\ninsolence as the difference in status would allow, and Forster\nbristled.\n\n\"I just clocked in an hour ago. There was a thick fog came on all of a\nsudden, and there was a bit of confusion when we were changing over.\nThey didn't say anything about the box when I relieved.\"\n\n\"Fog?\" Forster queried. \"How could fog form on a warm morning like\nthis?\"\n\n\"You're the scientist, sir. You tell me. Went as fast as it came.\"\n\n\"Well--it looks like very sloppy security. The contents of this thing\nmust almost certainly be classified. Give me the book and I'll sign for\nit. I'll phone you the file number when I find the covering\ninstructions.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nForster was a nervous, over-conscientious little man, and his day was\nalready ruined, because any departure from strict administrative routine\nworried and upset him. Only in his field of aviation medicine did he\nfeel competent, secure.\n\nHe knew that around the center they contemptuously called him\n\"Lilliput.\" The younger researchers were constantly trying to think up\nnew ways to play jokes on him, and annoy him.\n\nCrawley Preston, the research center's director and his chief, had been\nsummoned to Washington the night before. Forster wished fervently that\nhe was around to deal with this matter. Now that relations between East\nand West had reached the snapping point, the slightest deviation from\nsecurity regulations usually meant a full-scale inquiry.\n\nHe signed for the container, and carried it out to the car, still\nseething impotently over the guard's insolence.\n\nHe placed it beside him on the front seat of his car and drove up to the\nbuilding which housed part of the labs and also his office.\n\nHe climbed out, then as he slammed the door he happened to glance into\nthe car again.\n\nThe seat covers were made of plastic in a maroon and blue plaid pattern.\nBut where the box had rested there was a dirty grey rectangular patch\nthat hadn't been there before.\n\nForster stared, then opened the door again. He rubbed his fingers over\nthe discolored spot; it felt no different than the rest of the fabric.\nThen he placed the box over the area--it fitted perfectly.\n\nHe flopped down on the seat, his legs dangling out of the car, fighting\ndown a sudden irrational wave of panic. He pushed the container to the\nother end of the seat.\n\n_After all_, he rationalized, _plastics are notoriously unstable under\ncertain conditions. This is probably a new alloy Washington wants tested\nfor behavior under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure.\nWhat's gotten into you?_\n\nHe took a deep breath, picked up the box again. Where it had rested\nthere was another discolored patch on the car seat covers.\n\nHolding it away from him, Forster hurried into the office, then dumped\nthe box into a metal wastebasket. Then he went to a cabinet and pulled\nout a Geiger counter, carried it over to the wastebasket. As he pointed\nthe probe at the box the familiar slow clicking reassured him, and\nfeeling a little foolish he put the instrument back on its shelf.\n\n[Illustration: In his pressurized chamber, Forster read the startling\nmessage.]\n\nHurriedly, he went through his mail; there was nothing in it referring\nto the package. Then he called the classified filing section; nobody\nthere knew anything about it either.\n\nFor some reason he couldn't explain to himself, he wasn't even\nsurprised.\n\nHe stared into the wastebasket. The clumsily etched instructions glinted\nup at him: \"_To be opened as soon as possible...._\"\n\nHe picked up the phone and called the decompression chamber building.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no valid reason why he should have been self-conscious as he\ntalked to the lab attendant in charge of the decompression tank. He used\nit a dozen times a month for tests and experiments, yet when he gave his\ninstructions his voice was labored and strained.\n\n\"Some genius in Washington sent this thing down without any covering\ninstructions, but it has to be opened in a hurry in a thin atmosphere.\nEr--I'd like you to stay on the intercom for a while in case it blows up\nin my face or something.\" He tried to laugh, but all that came out was a\ncroak.\n\nThe attendant nodded indifferently, then helped Forster into the helmet\nof his pressure suit. He climbed up the steps into the chamber, pulling\nthe airtight door shut behind him. He placed the box on the desk in\nfront of the instrument panel, then turned back to push the door clamps\ninto place.\n\nFor the first time in the hundreds of hours he'd spent in the tank, he\nknew the meaning of claustrophobia.\n\nMechanically, he plugged in his intercom and air lines, went through the\nother routine checks before ascent, tested communications with the lab\nattendant, then flicked the exhaust motor switch.\n\nNow there was little to do except wait. He stared at the box; in the\nartificial light it seemed full of hidden menace, a knowing aliveness of\nits own....\n\nForster shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as though to throw off the\nvague blanket of uneasiness that was settling around him. So somebody\nhad forgotten to send a covering message with the container, or else it\nhad been mislaid--that could happen, although with security routine as\nstrict as it was, the possibility was remote. All the same, it could\nhappen. After all, what other explanation was there? What was it he was\nafraid of? There was something about it--\n\nHe glanced at the altimeter. The needle showed only 10,000 feet, and\nseemed to be crawling around the dial. He resolved not to look at it\nfor three minutes by the clock on the panel.\n\nWhen he checked the altimeter again, it registered just over 30,000\nfeet. Not even half way yet.\n\nAs the pressure in the tank decreased, he began to be conscious of the\nneed for \"reverse breathing\"--and he concentrated on using his tongue to\ncheck the flow of air into his lungs, then using the thoracic muscles to\nexhale against the higher pressure inside the suit.\n\nTime seemed to be passing in micro-seconds ... 25,000 feet ... 30,000\n... 40,000 ... 50,000.\n\nAt 62,500 feet he gently tested the cover of the container again; it\nlifted.\n\nAs the altimeter needle flickered on the 65,000-foot mark, he cut the\nexhaust motor and picked up the box. The cover slipped off easily.\n\nHis feeling of anticlimax was almost ludicrous. As he looked in, all the\nbox contained was a flattened roll of some greyish material.\n\nHe took it out; despite its comparative bulk, it was feather-light. It\nhad the appearance of metal, but was as porous and pliable as a good\ngrade of bond paper. He could not feel its texture through his heavy\ngloves. He took a good look.\n\nIt was new all right--no doubt Washington wanted some tests run on it,\nalthough without covering instructions and data this trip was wasted.\nBut some heads would roll when he reported back on the way the container\nhad been shipped in.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe started to unroll the material to get a better look at it, then he\nsaw that it was covered with cramped, closely spaced handwriting in a\npurplish ink--handwriting that was elusively familiar.\n\nThen he read the words written in neat capitals at the top, the name of\nthe man with the familiar handwriting, and fear came back, clamped cold\nfingers around his throat:\n\n_James Rawdon Bentley_\n\nDear Dick, the writing went on, Take a large economy-size grip on\nyourself. I know this is going to sound like a voice from the dead, but\nI'm very much alive and kicking--in the best of health in fact....\n\nThe writing blurred, and instinctively Forster put his fist up to rub\nhis eyes, only to meet the hard plastic of his helmet visor. James\nRawdon Bentley....\n\nIt was January 18, 1951, three years ago, and the jagged line of the\nAustralian coast stretched like a small-scale map to the black curve of\nthe horizon.\n\nFrom the converted bomber that was his flying lab, Forster could see the\nother American observation plane cruising on a parallel course, about\nhalf a mile away, and beyond it downwind the fringe of the billowing\ncloud dome of the super-secret British thermonuclear shot.\n\nThen suddenly Bentley's voice from the other plane was crackling over\nthe earphones, sharp and urgent:\n\n\"Our Geigers and scintillometers are going crazy! We're getting out of\nhere! There's something coming inside ... a light....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSilence. Forster had watched in helpless horror as the other ship dipped\na silver wing, then nosed down ever so slowly, it seemed ... down ...\ndown ... in a dive that seemed to take hours as Forster's plane tracked\nit, ending in a tiny splash like a pebble being thrown into a pond; then\nthe grimly beautiful iridescence of oil and gasoline spreading across\nthe glassy waters of the Timor Sea.\n\nNo parachutes had opened on the long journey down. An Australian air sea\nrescue launch and helicopter were at the scene of the crash in minutes,\nbut neither bodies nor survivors had been found, then or later....\n\n\"Everything okay, Doctor Forster?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said hoarsely. \"Yes ... everything's okay ... just routine.\"\n\nForster focussed his eyes on the writing again. There was no doubt at\nall that it was Bentley's. They had roomed and studied together for four\nyears at MIT, and then there had been a couple of years' post-graduate\nwork after that. During all that time they had used each other's notes\nconstantly.\n\nBut Bentley was dead.\n\nForster read on, stunned:\n\nFirst, you'll want to know what happened over the Timor Sea after the\nshot. Put very simply, I, the rest of the technicians, and the crew of\nthe B-29 were transhipped to another vehicle--without any damage to\nourselves. How, I'm not allowed to explain at this stage. Actually, they\nonly wanted me, but it wasn't feasible to collect me and leave the rest\nbehind, so they're all here, safe and well.\n\nWho are \"they,\" and where am I? The second question I can't answer--not\nallowed to. \"They,\" roughly translated, are \"The Shining Ones,\" which\ndoesn't tell you anything, of course. Briefly, they're a couple of\nlight-years ahead of Earth in evolution--mentally, morally, and\nphysically, although I use the last word loosely. Too bad that English\nis a commercial language, it's so hard to discuss really abstract ideas.\n\nWhy am I here? The whole reason for this message is wrapped up in the\nanswer to that.\n\nAs you probably know, Project Longfall, which I was heading up was\ndelayed about a year due to my removal. That was the sole purpose,\nalthough I and the rest of us are getting special instruction to keep us\noccupied.\n\nAbout the same time, they also took several other key people from\nBritain, Russia, and the United States. Others were already here.\n\nThe idea then was _delay_--to delay more test shots of atomic weapons,\nin the hope that East and West would come to some agreement. Now,\nbecause of the growing volume of tests, and the critical tension which\nprevails, delay will no longer suffice, and far more drastic steps are\nto be taken.\n\nI wish you could be here for only a few minutes to see what happens\nafter a multi-megaton thermonuclear test shot is set off on Earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI can't describe it in terms which would have any relation to your\npresent knowledge of physics. All I can say is that life here is\nintimately bound up with the higher laws of electro-magnetism which at\npresent are only being guessed at on your level. It's not the\nradioactivity which you know as such which causes the trouble--there are\nneutralizing devices throughout the planetary system to take care of\nthat. The damage is caused by an ultra-ultra-short wave radiation which\nnot even the most sensitive scintillometer you have can pick up, a very\nsubtle by-product of every chain reaction.\n\nIt doesn't have too much immediate effect on the lower forms of\nlife--including human beings, if you'll pardon the expression. But here,\nit causes a ghastly carnage, so ghastly it sickens me even to think\nabout it for a second.\n\nThe incredible thing is that the people here could stop Earth from\nfiring another shot if they wished to, and at 24 hours' notice, but\ntheir philosophy is totally opposed to force, even when it means their\nown destruction. That will give you an idea of the kind of people they\nare.\n\n(Here they say that Einstein was on the fringe of discovering the theory\ninvolved when he died, but was having trouble with the mathematics.\nRemember how Einstein always complained that he was really a poor\nmathematician?)\n\nBut with atomic warfare threatening to break out on Earth at any minute,\nthey have got to do something.\n\nThis is what they plan to do--this is what they _are going to do_.\n\nStarting within a few hours after you receive this message, a mass\nremoval of key scientists will begin. They will take 20, 30, or\n40--roughly equal numbers from both sides--every few hours as technical\nconditions allow. That will go on until East and West agree to drop this\nwhole mad weapons race. It will be done quietly, peacefully. Nobody will\nbe hurt except by a fluke. But if needs be, they will lift every major\nscientific brain off the face of Earth to stop the present drift to\ndisaster for everybody. There are no weapons, no devices that you have\nat present, which can stop this plan going into effect. There it\nis--it's as simple as that.\n\nIf you knew what you were really headed for, it would need no steps\nfrom here to make both sides on Earth stop this horrible foolishness in\na moment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lesson of Mars is part of the orientation course here. (I'm _not_ on\nMars). I'm using up space, so I'll go into note form for a bit. Martians\nhad an atomic war--forgot they had to breathe ... destroyed 60 per cent\nof their atmosphere ... canals on Mars aren't ... they're closely-spaced\nline of shafts leading to underground cities ... view from Earth\ntelescopes, shaft mouths appear as dots which run together into lines\ndue to eye-fatigue ... British Royal Astronomical Society figured that\nout 30 years ago at least ... see papers on their proceedings ...\nphotographs here show monsters created by wholesale mutations ... lasted\nabout four generations before reproduction failed ... now only\nvegetation on Mars ... saw pictures of last survivors ... horrible ... I\nwas ill for days after ... imagine having to take 40 separate breaths\nafter making a single step!\n\nGetting back to the others here ... a regular U. N. Remember O'Connor\nand Walters in our class? They're here. Check, you'll find that O'Connor\nis \"detached\" from Oak Ridge and Walters from Aiken for \"special duty.\"\nThat's Central Intelligence's story for their disappearance.\n\nRemember those top German boys the Russians were supposed to have gotten\nto before the Allies could reach them after the Nazi collapse? _They're\nhere too!_ And Kamalnikov, and Pretchkin of the Russian Academy.\n\nBelieve me (the style and the writing was a little less urgent again\nnow), I've had all the intellectual stuffing knocked out of me here.\n\nWe all have had, for that matter. We're supposed to be the cream of the\ncrop, but imagine sitting down to instruction from people whose I.Q.s\nstart where yours leaves off!\n\nBut what has really made most of us here feel pretty humble is the way\nthey have demolished Earth's so-called \"scientific method\"--and used the\nmethod itself to prove that it doesn't stand up!\n\nYou know how we've always been taught to observe, collect data, then\nerect a theory to fit the data, a theory which has to be modified when\nother data came along which don't fit into it.\n\nHere they work the opposite way--they say: \"Know the fundamental\nprinciples governing the operation of the universe and then all the\npieces fit together inside this final Truth.\"\n\nI understand now why so many of the Oak Ridge boys turned to religion\nafter they had been exposed to the electron microscope for a while--they\nrealized they had gone as far as their \"scientific\" training would ever\ntake them.\n\nTime and space are running out. I know all this must sound confused and\nincredible, Dick; I'm still confused myself. But I want you to think\nabout what I've written, then take the action you think best. I know it\nwon't be easy for you.\n\nIf you think this is some maniac's idea of a joke, you'll have proof\nvery soon that it isn't, because _one of the people at your Center is\ndue to leave for here any time now_.\n\nYou're wondering why I used this weird and wonderful means of\ncommunication. The problem was to find a writing material which would\nstand up in Earth's atmosphere--oddly enough, it's not the oxygen which\ncauses the trouble, but the so-called \"inert\" nitrogen. The container\nwill probably not disintegrate for a couple of days at sea level\natmospheric pressure, but this material I'm writing on would not last\nmore than a few seconds. That's one reason they picked you--most people\njust don't have a spare decompression chamber up in the attic! The other\nreason was that with your photographic memory, you'll know this is my\nhandwriting, beyond the shadow of a doubt, I hope.\n\nI'm sure you've sat in that pressure suit long enough. But remember, if\nyou want to take another look at this, you'll have to put it back in the\ncontainer before you go \"down.\"\n\nWishing you all you would wish for yourself,\n\n                                                  Jim.\n\nForster examined the signature. That was the way Bentley made the\ncapital J--it looked almost like a T, with just a faint hook on the\nbottom of the down-stroke. Then the way it joined the--\n\n\"Hey, Doc--are you going to tie up the tank all day? I've got work to\ndo.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nForster recognized the voice on the intercom as Tom Summerford's.\nSummerford was one of the crop of recent graduates to join the\nCenter--brash, noisy, irresponsible like the rest of them. He knew\nForster hated being called \"Doc,\" so he never lost an opportunity to use\nthe word. True, he was gifted and well-trained, but he was a ringleader\nin playing the practical jokes on Forster which might have been funny in\ncollege, but which only wasted a research team's time in these critical\ndays.\n\nPractical joke.\n\nAnger flooded over him.\n\nYes, this was all a macabre game cooked up by Summerford, with the help\nof some of his pals. Probably they were all out there now, snickering\namong themselves, waiting to see his face when he came out of the\ndecompression chamber ... waiting to gloat....\n\n\"Hey Doc! You still with us?\"\n\n\"I'll be out very shortly,\" Forster said grimly. \"Just wait right\nthere.\"\n\nHe spun the air inlet controls; impatiently, he watched as the\naltimeter needle began its anti-clockwise movement.\n\nHe'd call a staff meeting right away, find the culprits and suspend them\nfrom duty. Preston would have to back him up. If Summerford proved to be\nthe ringleader, he would insist on his dismissal, Forster decided. And\nhe would see to it that the young punk had trouble getting another post.\n\nThe fantastic waste of time involved in such an elaborate forgery ...\nForster trembled with indignation. And using the name of a dead man,\nabove all a scientist who had died in the interests of research, leaving\nbehind him a mystery which still troubled the Atomic Energy Commission,\nbecause nobody had ever been able to explain that sudden dive in a plane\nwhich was apparently functioning perfectly, and flown by a veteran\ncrew....\n\nHe glanced down at the roll.\n\nWas it his imagination, or had the purplish ink begun to fade? He ran a\nlength of it through his fingers, and then he saw that in places there\nwere gaps where the writing had disappeared altogether. He glanced up at\nthe altimeter needle, which was sliding by the 24,000-foot mark.\n\nHe looked back at his hands again, just in time to see the roll part in\ntwo places, leaving only the narrow strip he held between his gloved\nfingers.\n\nHe put the strip on the desk, and bent clumsily in his suit to retrieve\nthe other pieces from the floor. But wherever he grabbed it, it fell\napart. Now it seemed to be melting before his eyes. In a few seconds\nthere was nothing.\n\nHe straightened up. The strip he had left on the desk had disappeared,\ntoo. No ash, no residue. Nothing.\n\nHis thought processes seemed to freeze. He glanced mechanically at the\naltimeter. It read 2,500 feet.\n\nHe grabbed at the two pieces of the container. They still felt as rigid\nas ever. He fitted them together carefully, gaining a crumb of security\nfrom the act.\n\nHe realized vaguely that the altimeter needle was resting on zero, but\nhe had no idea how long he had been sitting there, trying to find a\nthread of logic in the confused welter of thoughts, when he heard the\nscrape of metal on metal as somebody wrestled with the door clamps from\nthe outside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was certain of only one thing. His memory told him that the signature\nthat was no longer a signature had been written by Jim Rawdon, who\ncouldn't possibly have survived that crash into the Timor Sea....\n\nFrom behind, somebody was fumbling with his helmet connections, then\nfresh air and familiar sounds rushed in on him as the helmet was taken\naway.\n\nSummerford's thin, intelligent face was opposite his.\n\n\"Doc! Are you all right?\" he was asking sharply. For once, there was no\nsuperciliousness in his voice.\n\n\"I'm fine,\" Forster said heavily. \"I--I've got a headache. Stayed in\nhere too long, I suppose.\"\n\n\"What's in the box?\" Summerford asked.\n\nThe way he asked told Forster at once that the youngster knew nothing\nabout it.\n\n\"Er--just some half-baked idea out of the Pentagon. Some colonel trying\nto justify his existence.\" He clutched the box to him as though\nSummerford might try to take it away. \"The tank's all yours.\"\n\nHe turned and clambered out of the chamber. He put the box down on the\nconcrete floor, and climbed out of the pressure suit, watching the box\nall the time. It seemed to gleam up at him, as though it had eyes, full\nof silent menace.\n\nHe realized vaguely that Summerford was standing in front of him again,\nlooking anxious.\n\n\"Are you quite sure you're okay?\"\n\n\"I'm fine,\" Forster said, hardly recognizing his own voice.\n\nHe picked up the box and stumbled out, heading for his office.\n\nWhen he walked in, his secretary was answering the line fitted with a\nscrambler, which connected directly with the Pentagon.\n\n\"General Morganson,\" she said, handing him the receiver.\n\nForster took the receiver, sat down at his desk and took a deep breath,\nfighting hard to regain his self control.\n\n\"Forster,\" he said into the mouthpiece when the office door closed\nbehind the girl.\n\n\"Forster! What the dickens has happened to Preston? My driver met the\ntrain here this morning, but there was no sign of him. But the Pullman\nporter checked him in last night, and we found all his gear and papers\nin his compartment!\"\n\n\"He left here in plenty of time to catch the train, General,\" Forster\nheard himself say. \"He took the train to get a night's rest.\" He\nrealized how irrelevant the last statement was only after he had made\nit.\n\nThe General was talking again ... important meeting with the Joint\nChiefs ... whole briefing team was being held up ... he'd reported it to\nthe C.I.A. as a precautionary measure....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nForster could see the words on the roll, the roll that wasn't, as though\nthey were engraved on his eye-retinas: _As a beginning, and to prove\nthis isn't just a bit of hocus-pocus, one of the people at your Center\nis due to leave for here any time now._\n\n\"General,\" Forster broke in hoarsely. \"I've got some very important\ninformation which you must have. I'll leave by heliplane right away.\"\n\nHe replaced the phone receiver in its cradle, wondering how convincing\nhe would be able to make his story. At least, even if he didn't have\nBentley's letter, he had the container. That should help.\n\nBut when he looked across the desk, he saw that it too had disappeared,\nwithout a trace.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGeneral Morganson was the newest product of the Atomic Age, half\nsoldier, half scientist--shrewd and perceptive, an intellectual giant.\n\nHe listened carefully, without comment or change of expression, as\nForster doggedly went through his story in chronological order.\n\nHalf way through, he held up his hand and started pushing buttons on the\nconsole built into his desk. Within a few moments men began filing into\nthe room, and sat down around Forster.\n\nThen the general motioned to the clerk seated in the corner by a tape\nrecorder.\n\n\"Gentlemen, listen to this playback and then I'll have Dr. Forster here\ngo on from there.\"\n\nWhat was left of Forster's confidence leaked away as he heard his own\ndiffident voice filling the room again. It was like being awake in the\nmiddle of a weird dream.\n\nBut when the tape recorder hissed into silence, he went on, staring\nstraight ahead of him in quiet desperation.\n\nWhen he ended his story, there was silence for a moment. Everyone sat\nmotionless.\n\nThen Morganson looked up and around.\n\n\"Well gentlemen? Mr. Bates, C.I.A. first.\"\n\nThis was no longer a story told by one man; it had become a problem, a\nsituation to be evaluated objectively.\n\n\"Well, sir ... the only part of the thing I can comment on at this point\nis the stuff about O'Connor and Walters. That checks. They both\ndisappeared without a trace. It was treated as a maximum security\nsituation, and we did give out the story they had been assigned to\nspecial duty.\" He glanced briefly at Forster. \"Up until now, we assumed\nthat only the directors at Aiken and Oak Ridge knew the real\nsituation--outside of the Atomic Energy Commission and C.I.A., of\ncourse. This represents a very serious leak--or....\" His voice trailed\naway.\n\n\"Colonel Barfield, Intelligence?\"\n\nThe young colonel tried to sound flippant, unsuccessfully.\n\n\"General, acting on the assumption the story is true, it would answer\nabout two hundred question marks in our files. Maybe more, with further\nstudy.\"\n\nThe C.I.A. man cleared his throat and raised a finger.\n\n\"For everybody's information,\" he said, \"a preliminary field check shows\nthat Dr. Preston's train was stopped for ten minutes by fog last night.\nThe train's radar installation failed simultaneously. There wouldn't be\nanything odd about that except the temperature at the time was about 65\ndegrees, and the humidity was only 55 per cent. Consider that,\ngentlemen.\n\n\"Theoretically, fog can't form under such conditions. Similar local fog\noccurred on the occasions when O'Connor and Walters were reported\nmissing. The Met. people couldn't explain that, either. That's all.\"\n\nMorganson sat up straight, as though he had suddenly made a decision.\n\n\"I don't think there's any value in further discussion at this point.\nYou will all have transcripts of Dr. Forster's statement within a few\nminutes. According to that statement, we are due to lose a number of key\nmen in the next few hours. I'll have Code One emergency precautions\ninstituted at all research establishments, and I think the chairman of\nthe Joint Chiefs should hear from me right away. Colonel Barfield, I'd\nlike you to ask Colonel Malinowski, the Russian military attach\u00e9 to see\nme here not later than an hour from now. We'll have a full dress\nconference here at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning, with written evaluation\nreports in detail from all branches. Dr. Forster, consider yourself\nassigned to Pentagon duty as of now, and until further notice.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nForster sat, dazed, until he realized that the others had left, and the\ngeneral was standing in front of him.\n\n\"Go get some rest, Forster,\" the other man said with surprising\ngentleness. \"You've had a tough day.\"\n\nAs Forster slept that early summer night, weathermen across the world\nwere marking their weather maps with thousands of observations--feathery\nwind arrows, temperatures, barometric pressures and relative humidities.\n\nThen, as they drew their isobars, the pattern for the northern\nhemisphere emerged. A giant high pressure system with its center in\nnorthern Oklahoma promised warm fair weather across America. Another,\ncentered east of the Ural Mountains, forecast clear weather for most of\nEurope and northern Asia.\n\nA low pressure trough between was dropping light warm rain on the green\nfields of England, but from Seattle to Washington, D. C, from Stettin to\nVladivostock the sun was rising or setting in clear skies.\n\nThen about 9 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, a thickening mist descended\nover warm and drowsy southwest South Carolina. It was a fog that was not\na fog, observers said afterwards, because there was no damp, no\ncoldness--just a steady loss of visibility until a man couldn't see his\nhand held up in front of his face, even though a bright moon was\nshining. Most of the reporting night shift at the Aiken hydrogen bomb\nplant never reached the tightly-guarded gates. Those who did were not\nallowed in.\n\nAt the same hour, across the world at the newly-built underground heavy\nwater factory of Rossilovskigorsk, west of the southern tip of Lake\nBaikal, the late morning sun cast deep shadows into the gaping holes in\nthe hillside which marked the plant entrances and exits. Deep below,\nmiles of filtration chambers hissed quietly as they prepared their\ndeadly concentrate.\n\nThen, without warning, the sun grew watery and paled, and within a few\nminutes a haze began to form at ground level. It grew thicker and\nthicker; the sun became a dim orange sphere, then was blotted out. Total\ndarkness enveloped the area.\n\nAnd at the same hour, the watchers manning the lonely circle of probing\nradar domes, facing each other across the frozen wastes of the Arctic,\ncursed softly in Russian and English as their scopes sweeping the upper\nair first went blank and then dark.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were shaken men at the meeting in General Morganson's office the\nnext morning.\n\n\"Over 30 key men gone from Aiken,\" Morganson was saying. \"In terms of\ngoals, it means that our 1960 program now cannot possibly be fulfilled\nuntil 1965. If the situation develops as forecast in Dr. Forster's\nstatement, our entire nuclear weapons program will grind to a halt\nwithin two weeks. If we drain men from civilian research, it will cause\na total breakdown in the civilian atomic power production program. As\nyou all know, the nation's entire economic expansion program is based on\nthe availability of that power. Without it, industry will be forced into\na deep freeze. That in turn means we might as well run up a white flag\non the White House lawn.\"\n\nHe smiled thinly. \"I would be a lot more worried than I am except we\nhave the first indications that the other side is in the same boat. I\nbroke every regulation in the book last night when I talked to\nMalinowski. I took the liberty of warning him, on the basis that there\nwas nothing to lose. His reaction then was that it was all a Wall\nStreet-capitalist plot--'psychological warfare,' he called it.\n\n\"He phoned me an hour ago. Sounded as though he'd just seen a ghost. He\nsaid the Russian ambassador had asked for an appointment with the\nSecretary of State this morning....\"\n\nForster, bewildered and out of his depth in these global problems, let\nthe flood of words pour over him.\n\nThen he realized that Morganson was staring at him over the telephone\nreceiver at his ear, and that the room was very quiet.\n\nThen Morganson said respectfully: \"Very well, Mr. President. We'll have\nDoctor Forster there.\"\n\nForster was relegated to the sidelines after his interview with the\ngrave-faced man in the White House. Events were moving swiftly--events\nwhich Forster could read behind the blurred black headlines of the\nnewspapers.\n\nThe Russian ambassador was closeted with the Secretary of State for a\nrecord six-hour talk. Then the Soviet Foreign Minister took off for\nWashington at 30 minutes' notice, and another record was made when he\nspent all day with the President. The Washington columnists began to\nhint of lessening tension in the cold war, and the wire services carried\nreports of Russian radio broadcasts talking of a new era of cooperation\nbetween East and West.\n\nOnly fragments of the broadcasts could be monitored, because radio\nreception had suddenly deteriorated right across the world. The reports\ncould not be confirmed because Russia had cut all phone communication\nwith the outside world. There was no possible mode of contact.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeanwhile, in the United States, television reception was blacking out\nfor hours at a time, with no explanation available. The Civil\nAeronautics Administration and the Air Force banned all plane movements\nunder instrument flight conditions, because radar navigational equipment\nhad become so unreliable as to be useless.\n\nNewspapers across the nation were reporting sudden fogs of short\nduration which baffled local weathermen. The U. S. Weather Bureau in\nWashington refused to comment.\n\nFor the first time in the history of an East-West conference, there was\nno haggling, no propaganda speeches. Hour after hour, even as the talks\nwent on, the cream of the world's scientific brains quietly continued to\ndisappear, it was revealed later.\n\nIn three days, the major powers accomplished what they had failed to do\nin the previous 15 years. Just 4 days and 21 hours after Forster had\nfirst talked to General Morganson at the Pentagon, a treaty was signed\nending the world atomic weapons race.\n\nAnd it had all happened, was over and done, before the people of the\nglobe could realize what was happening, before they could rise in mass\npanic in the face of the incredible unknown.\n\nAlmost immediately after the announcement, radio and radar\ncommunications suddenly returned to normal, and reports of the\nmysterious fogs ceased.\n\nBack at the Center, as he walked down the floodlit ramp of the heliport\ntowards his car, Forster found himself thinking of the experimental work\non the dream state which he had performed as a graduate student. He knew\nthat a dream which might take half an hour to recount took only a\nfraction of a second to occur in the sub-conscious of the sleeper as he\nawoke.\n\nIt was the same way with the events of the last five days; already\ndetails were becoming fuzzy and blurred as though they had happened\nfive years ago.\n\nHe opened the car door, and the soft glow of the dome light filled the\ninterior.\n\nThen he saw again the neat rectangular discoloration on the seat covers,\nand the jolt back to reality was almost a physical thing. Relief,\noverwhelming, flooded over him.\n\nHe looked up into the indigo-velvet sky. Above him was the enormous\ntriangle formed by Deneb, Vega, and Altair. Framed within it were a\nthousand other dimmer stars, but all, he knew, far, far bigger than the\nspeck of solidified gases called Earth.\n\nSomewhere out there, living, thinking, breathing was Bentley.\n\n\"Good night,\" Forster said out loud.\n\nAnd somehow, he was sure he wasn't talking into thin air.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note\n\nThis etext was produced from _Amazing Science Fiction Stories_ April\n1959.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
