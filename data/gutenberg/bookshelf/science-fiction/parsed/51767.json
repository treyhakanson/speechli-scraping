He'd had five hours of inactivity on\nthe plane, but the peremptory manner with which he had been routed out\nof his California apartment and conveyed to Washington, D. C, had so\nfilled his mind with unanswered questions that he still found rest to\nbe impossible. He had been told simply that the government needed him;\nand when federal wheels started turning, there wasn't much a private\ncitizen could do to stop them.\n\nHe watched the tall, lean, dark-haired man, who had been introduced as\nDr. Jackson Wilmer, nuclear physicist, disappear through a door.\n\nFlinn looked around.\n\nThe room in which he sat--comparatively small, one of hundreds in the\nvastness of the Pentagon--seemed to be a sort of minor office. At least\nthere were several desks and filing cabinets. Besides himself, there\nwere now only two other men in the room.\n\nOne, a complete stranger, sat at a desk across the room with his back\nturned toward Flinn.\n\nThe other leaned against the wall near the door. All Flinn knew about\nhim, despite the fact that they had been as close as boy and dog for\nthe past seven hours, was that his name was Hayes and that he was a\nspecial agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There was a\nmuscular hardness about this young man that betrayed an athletic\nbackground. He was about thirty, had a craggy face beneath short brown\nhair, hard gray eyes, and his nose had been broken at least once. There\nwas a light trace of beard beginning to show on the agent's face, but\nhis brown summer suit still looked neat, and the man himself seemed\nsomething less than tired.\n\nLooking at him, Flinn felt a sense of his own shabbiness. He needed a\nshave as badly as his slacks and sports jacket needed pressing.\n\nAt forty-two, Flinn was somewhat taller than average and slightly\nunderweight from overwork and the irregularities of a bachelor\nexistence. His black hair, beginning to recede a little, was peppered\nwith silver, and his normally relaxed face was now tight, and the\nwhites of his hazel eyes were bloodshot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe door beside Hayes opened and Wilmer entered, carrying a brown\nfolder. He was in his shirtsleeves, his necktie pulled down and his\ncollar open, and, as he approached, Flinn noted that the deeply tanned\nface of the physicist was as stubbled and tired-looking as his own\nfelt. He was about the same age as Flinn.\n\nWilmer tossed the folder on the desk in front of Flinn and then perched\non one corner of the desk. He gazed at the parapsychologist for a long\nfew seconds, his eyes startingly ice-blue in his dark face.\n\n\"Well,\" he said presently, \"I guess you're wondering what this is all\nabout.\"\n\n\"Yes, I guess I am,\" Flinn said wryly. \"This bird dog--\" he indicated\nHayes with a nod of his head, and the agent retaliated with a flash\nof teeth--\"hauls me away from an important experiment, loads me on an\nAir Force jet, and, after a high-altitude flight at God only knows\nwhat kind of fantastic speeds, I find myself in the holiest of holies,\nsurrounded by MPs and--yes, you might say I'm wondering what this is\nall about.\"\n\nWilmer nodded patiently and rubbed one hand across his eyes.\n\n\"When you find out, you'll understand the reason for the secrecy.\" He\nfaced Hayes. \"How long have we been on this thing now, Fred? It seems\nlike weeks.\"\n\n\"Ten days,\" the FBI man answered.\n\nWilmer shook his head slowly, then reached for the folder, opened\nit, and took out several scientific journals that Flinn recognized\ninstantly. The physicist opened one of them.\n\n\"'Advanced Experiments in TP, by Patrick Flinn,'\" he read. He laid\nthe publication aside and picked up another. \"'A Monograph on the\nProbabilities of TH,' same author.\"\n\nHe quoted at random from the introductory page: \"'It is therefore\nmy belief, based upon recent preliminary experimentation, that not\nonly can one mind be used to scan the thoughts of another, but that\nideas and suggestions may be implanted upon another's mind without\nthe knowledge of the receptor. This is not to be confused with simple\ntelepathic 'sending,' where the receptor is completely aware of the\nother's transmission. This to which I refer may, at least in one\nphase, be described as hypnotic in effect. The possibilities of such\ninfluence over the mind-matter of another are more than somewhat\nconsiderable....'\"\n\nHe paused, lowered the journal and gazed speculatively at Patrick\nFlinn. \"Telepathy, telehypnosis,\" he said, rolling out the words as if\nthey left a strange taste in his mouth. \"Very interesting. Just how\nmuch truth is there in all this stuff? I mean, how far along are you,\nreally?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFlinn considered the question for a few seconds. It was one he had\nheard often, especially from his colleagues at the small California\ncollege where he held an assistantship in psychology. But after\ntwenty years of skepticism--he had first discovered his rudimentary\ntelepathic abilities just after graduating from college, and had been\nexperimenting and advancing ever since--he had become immune to\ncriticism.\n\n\"Very few people bother to read my articles,\" Flinn said evenly, \"and\nstill fewer understand them, and the _fewest_ believe. But I can tell\nyou I'm far enough along in my research to know that the human mind\nhas latent powers that are, to quote my article, more than somewhat\nconsiderable.\"\n\nWilmer and Hayes exchanged glances.\n\n\"That's fine,\" Wilmer said, \"but abstruse, wouldn't you say? What I'm\ngetting at is, I want to see a practical demonstration.\"\n\n\"Put up or shut up, eh?\" Flinn said.\n\n\"I'd rather call it an examining of credentials,\" the physicist\ncountered.\n\n\"All right. I don't see any connection between my work and nuclear\nphysics, but what do you want me to do? First, though, I'd better\nexplain that I might fail. I'm really just on the threshold.\"\n\n\"Granted. So I'll make it easy. Suppose--\" He looked over his shoulder,\nfaced Flinn again, and continued in a low voice: \"Suppose you tell me\nwhat the man at the far desk is thinking.\"\n\nFlinn glanced past the physicist at the stranger across the room. The\nman seemed completely unaware of the others. He was poring over some\npapers that were spread out upon the desk.\n\nFlinn focused his eyes upon the man's head. His mind was really too\nsteeped in fatigue for this sort of thing, but it was a chance not\nto be missed, a chance to demonstrate his talents in the presence\nof a responsible scientist, so he willed himself into a gradually\ndeepening concentration. His eyes seemed to go myopic, out of focus. A\ngray, ethereal haze came into his consciousness, like swirling smoke.\n_Easy?_ But presently a picture began to form, blurred at first, then\nfragmentary, then coming into identifiable clarity.\n\nFlinn held it for a moment, before snapping back into objective\nconsciousness. He was grinning slightly as his eyes refocused and came\nto rest on Wilmer.\n\n\"Well?\" the physicist asked.\n\n\"What's his name?\" Flinn said.\n\n\"Barnes. Robert Barnes.\"\n\n\"Say, Bob!\" Flinn called out. The smallish, partially bald man at the\nfar desk looked up and swiveled around to face him. \"Tell me something,\nBob,\" Flinn went on. \"Do you act that way with all women, or just\nblondes?\"\n\nBarnes' placid face suddenly underwent a marvelous transformation.\nFirst he blushed furiously. Then his jaw dropped open and the high\ncolor began to drain away. He stared across the room, his face pallid.\n\n\"My God!\" he managed to blurt in a stricken voice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was dead silence in the room as Wilmer and Hayes looked from\nBarnes' shocked face to Flinn's smiling one.\n\n\"I think it's obvious--\" Hayes started to say.\n\n\"Me, too,\" Wilmer agreed. He looked sharply at Flinn. \"Can you tell\nwhat I'm thinking at this moment?\"\n\nFlinn shrugged. \"Not without a special effort, and I'm not going to\nmake that effort unless I have to.\"\n\nThe physicist sighed and his tanned face relaxed a little. He looked at\nFlinn with a new respect. \"I guess I'd better put you in the picture.\"\nHe reopened the folder and extracted several newspaper clippings. \"What\nI'm about to divulge is so unbelievable that--well, I'd best break it\nto you gradually. You know my job. That fact and this tan--\" he pointed\nto his face--\"should give you an inkling of what I've been up to the\nlast few weeks.\"\n\nFlinn thought, and nodded. \"I'm to assume that you've been out in the\nPacific, is that right?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Wilmer said. \"Eniwetok. Have you been following our progress in\nthe papers?\"\n\n\"Not really. I've been a little too busy, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"No matter.\" The physicist handed the clippings to Flinn. \"Read these.\"\n\nFlinn scanned the first clipping. It bore a recent date.\n\n\"'... Reliable sources,'\" he read aloud, \"'report that a civilian,\nbelieved to be a scientist, is being held incommunicado in the\nPentagon. All efforts on the part of newsmen to gain additional\ninformation have been met with polite but firm rebuffs. Spokesmen\nfrom the AEC have refused to confirm or deny theories that the man's\ndetention is in some way connected with the recent fiasco at Eniwetok\nAtoll ...'\"\n\nHe read the second. It was date-lined Honolulu, a week before the other.\n\n\"'Beyond the terse comment that there were \"no casualties,\" all\nofficial sources are silent today concerning the news leak of the\nfailure of a nuclear device in our Pacific Test Area. It has been\nunderstood that this device, the third in a series of thermonuclear\ntest shots, failed to detonate. Since this test was scheduled to have\nbeen a \"tower shot,\" under rigid instrumental control, much speculation\nhas arisen ...'\"\n\nFlinn looked up hopelessly. \"I don't understand. Does this concern you?\nI mean--\"\n\n\"It concerns _all_ of us,\" Wilmer said grimly. \"But I know what you're\ngetting at. No, I'm not the man they mention. I was in charge of that\nparticular test.\"\n\nHayes cleared his throat abruptly and Wilmer nodded.\n\n\"I want you to understand, Mr. Flinn, before we go any further, that\neverything you hear and see, and have heard and seen from the time Fred\nfirst contacted you, is to be held in the strictest confidence. Is that\nclear?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"All right. How much do you know about atomic physics?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFlinn spread his hands. \"I'm somewhat past the Democritus stage, but I\ndon't claim to be an expert.\"\n\n\"Well, basically, in a thermonuclear explosive device, hydrogen is\ntransformed into helium,\" said Hayes. \"In the process there is a loss\nof mass. This loss results in a tremendous and sudden release of\nenergy. Are you familiar with the energy-mass relationship, E = MC^2?\"\n\nFlinn nodded.\n\n\"Okay. In other words, the nuclei of hydrogen atoms are fused under the\ninfluence of great heat, resulting in a different element, less mass, a\nrelease of energy, and an explosion.\"\n\n\"I'm with you so far,\" Flinn said.\n\n\"Then you realize that once this fusion process commences, nothing in\nGod's great universe can stop it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And that after certain things are done, fusion _must_ result?\"\n\n\"Surely.\"\n\n\"Well, so all of us believed, too. But we were wrong about it.\"\n\n\"I don't understand. You just said--\"\n\n\"So I _said_. But let me try to describe to you the situation as it\nhappened.\" He paused, not for dramatic effect, but to take a moment\nto force himself to recall what Flinn could see must have been a very\npainful experience.\n\n\"We are on the command ship,\" Wilmer continued, \"at a safe distance\nfrom the atoll. Everything is in readiness, checked and double-checked\nby me, personally. The automatic firing process is in progress. The\nlast countdown has commenced. Five, four, three, two, one, zero.\n_Nothing happens._\n\n\"I'll simplify the subsequent chain of events. After a reasonable\ninterval, a volunteer pilot and myself and one other man fly by\nhelicopter to the atoll. We climb the tower. I'm sweating and so are\nthe others. We're standing beside a _live hydrogen bomb_. I disconnect\nthe power sources and do various things to render the device safe.\nThen we check. Everything--_everything_--is in working order. There is\nabsolutely no reason why the thing failed to detonate. Yet it did fail.\n\n\"We fly back to the command ship. We hold an emergency conference.\nWe're sitting there staring at each other. Then this--this man, Dobbs,\nstarts to laugh. We think it is hysterics, due to the tremendous\nstrain that everyone has been under. But apparently it isn't. He laughs\nand laughs and laughs. Finally he manages to say: 'You can't figure\nit out, can you? Well, I know. Old Dobbsie knows. _It didn't explode\nbecause I willed it not to!_'\"\n\nFlinn's mind was almost too tired to accept what he had heard. \"Are you\ntrying to tell me--\"\n\n\"Figure it out for yourself,\" Wilmer said flatly. \"It's your field.\nTelepathy, telehypnosis, and what's left?\"\n\n\"_Psychokinesis_,\" Flinn said in a stifled voice.\n\n\"Right. Psychokinesis. Mind over matter.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOrdinarily, Patrick Flinn would have used the morning ride over\nWashington's broad avenues to good advantage--this was his first visit\nto the nation's capital--but his mind was too filled with the preceding\nday's revelations to permit anything save minimal sightseeing.\n\n\"I hate to keep repeating myself,\" Wilmer was saying, \"but I must be\ncertain you understand what's at stake here.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Flinn answered with some impatience. \"I'm not to reveal,\nunder any circumstances, the fact that I have telepathic powers.\"\n\n\"Correct.\" The physicist sat in the seat beside Flinn, and Hayes was in\nfront beside the driver. \"Your job is to find out just how much this\nman can do. We'd like to know the _way_ he does it, too, but that's\nsecondary.\"\n\n\"It strikes me,\" Flinn mused, \"that anyone who can influence a fusion\nbomb can do anything.\"\n\n\"That's what we're afraid of.\" Wilmer looked soberly at the\nparapsychologist. \"I think I can understand what's going on in your\nmind. This is your special love and you're finding it difficult to\ndivorce yourself from pure clinical investigation. You want, really,\nto talk to Dobbs as one scientist to another. But I must warn you that\nthis is impossible. If he gets the least inkling that you're a special\nmind, something disastrous may result. As long as he gets what he\nwants, fine, but rub him the wrong way and--\"\n\n\"And yet you have him a virtual prisoner and he doesn't object?\"\n\n\"Well, at least not strenuously,\" Wilmer said. \"I don't profess to\nunderstand a warped mind, but apparently Dobbs realizes that his\nconfinement is mostly protective custody. It's to his own advantage.\nAfter all, he doesn't have to stand up at a public forum and shout\nthreats. All he has to do is contact the few to reach the many. And if\nhe has the powers he says he has, full use of them would result in his\nown destruction. And he doesn't want that. He's too interested, right\nnow, in satisfying his own animal appetites. But faced with losing\neverything--\"\n\n\"Our biggest immediate worry,\" Hayes said from the front seat, \"is\nkeeping all this from the public. That's why we put Dobbs out of sight\nin a hurry. There have been some leaks already, but so far most people\nconsider the papers' theories as just so much wild speculation. And\nthank God for that. You can understand why all recognizable public\nfigures are keeping as far away from Dobbs as possible.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFlinn nodded; it was self-evident. There were other phases of the\nproblem that bothered him more. He was still vaguely and, as it seemed,\nillogically worried about the several questions he had raised the day\nbefore.\n\nThe fact that Dobbs might have read his articles and hence might put\ntwo and two together, despite a cover identity, was the least of\nthem. Flinn had never lectured in public, his efforts had received no\npublicity except in specialized psychological circles, and his latest\nmonograph on TH had been published when Dobbs was working at the atoll.\n\nWilmer, Hayes, and others had managed to assuage reasonable fears on\nthe other point. Flinn had always assumed that psychokinesis would be\nthe logical result of advanced telepathy, that they were links in\nthe same chain. Now it seemed that a person could be one without the\nother. Either you possessed a latent ability to scan mind-matter, or an\naffinity for material substance, but not necessarily both.\n\nEarlier, Wilmer and Hayes had devised a test to check the possibility\nthat Dobbs was an advanced telepath. They had mentally vilified him\nbeyond the ability of even an accomplished actor to resist, over\nprolonged periods of time, and yet Dobbs had shown not the least\nindication that he had intercepted their thoughts. But there was one\nadditional point.\n\n\"You used the expression 'warped mind' in describing Dobbs,\" Flinn said\nto Wilmer. \"Is it your opinion then that he is definitely psychopathic?\nThe reason I ask is that scanning a confused mind may prove to be more\nthan I can handle.\"\n\n\"I used that expression for want of a better,\" Wilmer answered\ncautiously. \"Put it this way--suppose you suddenly found you were able\nto control, even in a minor way, the stuff of the universe; would you\nuse those powers for the benefit of mankind, or would you leap over the\ntraces and reach for all the things that had been denied you over the\nyears for moral, or legal, or whatever reasons?\"\n\n\"You paint a lurid picture,\" Flinn said.\n\nThey turned down a side street in a residential district and drew up in\nfront of what appeared to be a large two-story private home.\n\nFlinn took a deep breath. He was rested now, but still uncertain\nwhether he was up to what lay ahead.\n\nAfter the preliminary discussion with Wilmer, Hayes, and Barnes--the\nlatter had proved to be a military intelligence man--the previous\nafternoon, Flinn had been closeted immediately with a number of\ngenerals, admirals, and high-ranking civilians from both houses of\nCongress, the Defense Department, the Department of State, and various\nsecurity agencies.\n\nThere had been the usual skepticism until he had performed some simple\nbut histrionic \"mind-reading\" feats, and then there had been much talk\nabout the responsibilities that had now become incumbent upon him and\nhow perhaps even the fate of the nation was in his hands. It had left\nhim wandering in a jungle of doubts and fears. Yet he had managed to\nsleep.\n\n\"The wonderful ability of the human mind to reject unpleasantness,\" he\nhad told himself.\n\nAs a matter of fact, he had fallen into deep, untroubled\nunconsciousness within an hour of the time his head had first touched\nthe pillow in the comfortable hotel room the government had provided.\nHayes had been with him. \"Security,\" Hayes had said.\n\nAnd now, clean-shaven, his clothes neatly pressed, the substantial\nbreakfast still warm in his stomach, and fatigue no longer in his\nmuscles and nerves, Flinn told himself that he was as ready as he would\never be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey got out of the conservative, unmarked sedan and approached the\nhouse. There was a man mowing the lawn, another clipping hedges, and\nstill another polishing a car that was parked in the driveway just\noutside the spacious garage.\n\n\"How's it going?\" Hayes said to the hedge trimmer.\n\n\"All quiet,\" the man answered without looking up.\n\nThey went around the house and entered unchallenged through a side\ndoor. It was all very casual, yet Flinn did not have to be told that\nthey were under constant scrutiny.\n\nThe room in which he found himself was just off the kitchen. Three men\nin working clothes sat around a table, drinking coffee. They looked\nup and nodded. They seemed to be cut from much the same cloth as Fred\nHayes, even to the expression.\n\n\"Well, well,\" one of them said, \"the brain trust.\" He surveyed Flinn\nwith frank interest, then faced Hayes. \"Say, buddy, how does a man get\na transfer out of this outfit?\"\n\nHayes grinned his wolfish grin. \"All in good time, partner.\" He pointed\nwith his chin upstairs and raised his eyebrows.\n\nThe man who had spoken, a large, broad-shouldered youngster with an\naffably homely face, got up, stepped back from the table, and went into\na vaudevillian travesty of a bow. \"The great man has been prepared and\nawaits your presence.\" Then his expression changed. \"What a party! I\nnever saw so much liquor in my life! It's a lucky thing the rumpus room\nis soundproof.\"\n\n\"And girls!\" one of the seated men said. \"Man, oh, man!\"\n\nFlinn looked at Wilmer, and Wilmer shrugged as if to say, \"That's the\nway it is.\"\n\n\"Just don't forget what you're here for,\" Hayes said harshly.\n\n\"Don't fret,\" the big man said. \"None of us touched a drop.\"\n\n\"Neither did Dobbs,\" one of the seated men interjected. \"I guess that's\nthe only reason he's alive today.\" He guffawed loudly and suggestively.\n\nHayes leading, they entered a hallway and turned toward a flight of\nstairs.\n\n\"Your boys seemed very off-hand about all this,\" Flinn said to the\ngovernment agent.\n\n\"Don't kid yourself,\" Hayes replied. \"They're as nervous as cats.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Come in, gentlemen,\" Dobbs called amiably from the rear of the\nspacious bedroom. There was an unobtrusive man in a dark suit with him,\nbut he left immediately.\n\nNow that he was face to face with the enigmatic Mr. Dobbs, Flinn felt a\nmomentary sense of disappointment.\n\nMalcolm Dobbs sat in a straight-backed chair beside the large bed.\nNext to him was a table laden with empty breakfast dishes. Dobbs was\ndressed in an ordinary bathrobe. He appeared to be in his mid-forties\nand had a full head of dark hair, slightly gray at the temples. His\nmild, undistinguished face was only slightly less tanned than Wilmer's,\nand he was of average size and weight. His dark eyes were the only\nthings that belied the man's composed exterior; they were intelligent,\ninterested, and intently watchful. A tiny smile lingered upon Dobbs'\nlips, as if he were sharing only with himself some form of immensely\nfunny but eminently private joke.\n\nFlinn's total impression of the man was that he was not the sort one\nwould look at twice in a crowded room--under different circumstances.\n\n\"Another delegation?\" Dobbs asked. \"Hello, Jack, Hayes.\"\n\n\"Mal this is Mr. Dugan,\" Wilmer said, indicating Flinn. \"He's from the\ngovernment.\"\n\nEven as he acknowledged the introduction, Flinn paused momentarily\nover the casual familiarity between the physicist and the apparent\npsychokinetic, until he was reminded that they were both nuclear\nphysicists and had been together for weeks at the atoll. Flinn found\nhimself wondering how close they had been and what thoughts must\nbe going through Wilmer's mind at the moment. But he squelched his\ncuriosity. He was here to scan Dobbs' mind, nobody else's.\n\n\"Be unobtrusive,\" he had been warned. \"Stay in the background as much\nas possible and let Wilmer and Hayes carry the ball. And do the job\nquickly.\"\n\nDobbs looked Flinn over carefully, then seemed to dismiss him from his\nmind, as if he had decided Flinn was of no particular importance--or no\nimmediate threat.\n\n\"You boys should have been here last night,\" Dobbs smiled. \"We had\nquite a party.\" His smile faded and he added petulantly: \"The only\nthing--some of the girls weren't as cooperative as I had hoped.\"\n\n\"We'll be more selective next time,\" Hayes promised quickly.\n\n\"See to it,\" Dobbs said.\n\nThey seated themselves, Hayes and Wilmer close to Dobbs, and Flinn just\nfar enough away to seem deferential without raising suspicion.\n\n\"Now, what can I do for you?\" Dobbs queried. \"Another demonstration, I\nassume?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Wilmer said. \"How about that disappearance thing again?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDobbs sighed. \"You boys just can't get it through your skulls that what\nI do isn't some sort of trick, can you? Even faced with the evidence of\nthe bomb.\"\n\nWilmer raised his hands. \"It's not that so much, although what you can\ndo, you'll have to admit, is rather unbelievable. It's the fact that\nMr. Dugan here has never seen any evidence of your powers, and the\nreport he will deliver to his superiors may cause even more commotion\nin high places--to your advantage.\"\n\nFlinn was amazed that such a flimsy appeal to the appetites and ego of\na man as intelligent as Malcolm Dobbs could be successful. Yet it not\nonly could, it was.\n\nDobbs looked again at Flinn, the strange smile playing upon his lips;\nthen he reached across the table, picked up an opaque glass water\ncarafe, poured out its remaining liquid into an empty cereal bowl, and\nreplaced it on the table.\n\n\"We don't want water spilled over everything, do we?\" he said.\n\nWilmer slipped one arm behind the back of his chair and signaled\nurgently to Flinn.\n\nSince entering the room, Flinn had been gathering all his resources\nfor a quick and powerful effort, and, at the sight of Wilmer's waving\nfingers, he began.\n\nHe was startled that, despite the interaction and interference of\nthe other thought patterns in the room, he was able to make so quick\na contact. Just before reaching Dobbs' mind, the thought impressed\nitself upon Flinn that the reason was the immense mental power that was\nbuilding within, and generating from, Dobbs. It was the simplest piece\nof telepathic scanning with which Flinn had ever been involved.\n\nFor a matter of seconds, nothing happened. Then the water carafe\nabruptly disappeared, its passage into apparent nothingness coincident\nwith a faint \"pop\" as the air of the room rushed in to fill the vacuum.\n\nDobbs turned triumphantly and saw Flinn still in the trancelike stupor\nof the telepath-in-contact. Hayes stood up to screen him, but Flinn\nshook his head and managed to clear his mind quickly.\n\n\"Your friend seems somewhat astounded,\" Dobbs chuckled.\n\n\"My God!\" was all Flinn could say.\n\nWilmer and Hayes looked at him questioningly, and Hayes muttered: \"I\nthink he's seen enough. Let's get out of here.\"\n\n\"Come back anytime, gentlemen,\" Dobbs said.\n\nHis laughter followed them as they retreated through the door and down\nthe hall to the stairs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well?\" Wilmer said.\n\nThey sat around the table in the room just off the kitchen, steaming\ncups of coffee in front of them. The three security agents who had been\nin the room were gone now to their respective duties.\n\nFlinn gazed down into the dark depths of the coffee, trying to organize\nhis thoughts; trying to interpret and evaluate what he had seen.\n\nWilmer and Hayes sipped their coffee, waiting with forced patience for\nthe parapsychologist to speak.\n\nPresently, Flinn shivered and looked up at them. \"If he says he can\ncontrol a critical mass, or erase Washington, D. C., or destroy the\nnation, you'd better believe him.\"\n\n\"He's telling the truth then,\" Hayes said grimly.\n\n\"Yes,\" Flinn answered. \"Here are my findings. Somehow Dobbs has\nestablished rapport with the atom. Any atom. Probably any number\nof atoms. I doubt if he can move one single mass in the ordinary\nconception of psychokinesis. That is, I doubt if he can cause a pebble,\nsay, to shift one millimeter. What he _can_ control are the forces that\nbind atoms into molecular structures, or that hold nuclei together. Do\nyou understand what I mean? For example, what he did up there just\nnow was to get rid of the space between atoms in the molecules of that\nwater carafe. I saw it clearly; there's no mistake. The space ceased to\nexist, the atoms crashed in upon each other, and the carafe seemed to\ndisappear. The mass is the same. It's simply in a different form.\"\n\nHe paused and scanned the numb faces of the government agent and the\nnuclear physicist beside him.\n\n\"Let's get down to specifics,\" he continued. \"What's his trump card?\nWhat is it he's holding over our heads?\"\n\n\"The atmosphere,\" Wilmer said painfully.\n\n\"Oxygen,\" Flinn mused. \"Suppose Dobbs concentrated upon the oxygen\natoms all around us and caused their nuclei suddenly to fuse. What\nwould happen?\"\n\n\"Nobody on the face of the Earth would know what hit him,\" Wilmer said.\n\"The Moon would probably be blasted out of its orbit. And if there is\nany intelligent life on Mars, they'd be treated to a sight they'd never\nforget--if they survived it.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" Flinn said, \"we've done what we came here to do. What's\nthe answer?\"\n\nHayes' face set into a hard mask. \"There'll be a meeting of the brass,\nof course. But I can tell you what the result will be. I'll be assigned\nto kill him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA buzz of excited conversation filled the Pentagon conference room.\nFlinn sat in one of the several dozen chairs between Wilmer and Hayes\nand looked at a glass ashtray that lay on the part of the long table\njust in front of him. One day perhaps he, too, might be able to\ninfluence the molecular structure of such an object. Or, more likely,\none of his descendants, because he would never be able to discover the\nshort-cuts now.\n\nPlanned murder. All the resources and brains of the government, the\nchampion of the rights and dignity of the individual, gathered together\nto plot the deliberate destruction of one man.\n\nIt filled Flinn with sadness. It was inevitable. It had to be done. No\none had the right to put himself above the rules of social conduct and\nthe welfare of several billion innocent souls. And yet--\n\nHe found himself wondering what the Founding Fathers would think of\nsuch a move. \"... all men are endowed by their Creator with certain\nunalienable rights ... Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"\nExecutions of criminals were the result of lengthy legal processes,\nduring which all the rights of the individual were scrupulously\nobserved. But this--was he also one of the judges? Let the punishment\nfit the crime. What about the judging?\n\n\"Isn't there some other way?\" Wilmer broke into his thoughts. \"That's\nwhat you're thinking, correct?\"\n\nFlinn managed a faint smile. \"And I'm supposed to be the telepath.\"\n\n\"Let's be entirely rational about it,\" Wilmer said. \"Dobbs is a\nbrilliant man, granted. But he is also a lecher and a coward.\"\n\n\"There's some of the pig and the wolf in every man,\" Flinn said.\n\n\"Depends on the extent,\" Wilmer went on. \"Dobbs is way overboard.\nAnd he's a craven. I know it's hard to picture a man who voluntarily\ncrosses a bridge into the unknown as anything but brave. I suppose\nthere is a sort of bravado in it. But when he turns that bridge into a\nclub to threaten the rest of mankind--is this courage?\" He turned to\nthe FBI man. \"What do you think about it, Fred?\"\n\nHayes pulled himself out of the shell of disciplined impassivity\ninto which he had retreated shortly after passing his own unofficial\ndeath sentence upon Dobbs. He looked at the physicist and the\nparapsychologist.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Hayes said bluntly. \"Absolutely nothing. I'm just one of the\nexpendables.\"\n\n\"Aren't we all?\" Wilmer said. He shrugged at Flinn. \"That's why we were\nchosen originally. Me because I was there at the atoll when all this\nstarted, and was acquainted with Dobbs, and capable of understanding\nthe implications of his acts. Hayes because--\"\n\n\"Because I've a good enough record to be above suspicion, and because\nI'm young enough not to be missed,\" the agent said.\n\n\"And you, Pat,\" the physicist said to Flinn, \"because of your unique\ntalents. But now we're all under the gun.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a lapse in the background noise, and the three turned to see\nthe President's representative rise and signal for order. He was a\ntall, graying man, beautifully dressed, and, as he spoke, there was a\nnote of sad resignation in his voice.\n\n\"So, gentlemen, since reasoning with Dobbs has proven to be useless, we\nfind ourselves in agreement. All that remains is to select the time and\nthe method. And, by the way, Mr. Hilliard--\" he nodded at the Director\nof the FBI--\"has assured me there is no need to deviate from our\noriginal plan, at least so far as the human element is concerned. Agent\nHayes will remain our--messenger. He seems to be ideally suited for the\njob.\"\n\nThere was a visible stir down the length of the table as the top men\nfrom the government tried not to look at Fred Hayes. None of them\nsucceeded. Under their brief, self-conscious but probing scrutiny,\nHayes' hard face betrayed not a flicker of emotion.\n\n\"And now the time and the method.\" The Presidential assistant cleared\nhis throat and scanned the faces of the men before him. \"I should think\nas soon as possible.\" A murmur of assent swept the room. \"There remains\nthe problem of method. Dr. Wilmer cautions that it must be done very\nefficiently. If Dobbs even suspects that his life is to be forfeit at\na predictable time--well, I hardly need tell you the danger. Director\nHilliard suggests that we leave it up to Agent Hayes, since he knows\nhis own capabilities better than anyone else. Mr. Hayes?\"\n\nThe tall, athletic agent rose, reached under his coat to his right hip\nand produced a short-barreled revolver. He held it up. \"With this,\" he\nsaid laconically. \"In the head. Death will be instantaneous.\"\n\nThere were sudden protests from the military representatives.\n\nHayes holstered the revolver and looked at his chief. Hilliard nodded,\nand Hayes walked to the end of the room. From a carton, he lifted a\nsmall bullet trap and placed it against the wall. The safe area inside\nthe trap was about the size of an opened magazine. Then he moved to the\nconference table, picked up one of the ashtrays, returned to the trap,\nand propped the tray against it.\n\nAppropriately, the tray was about the width of a man's head.\n\nAgent Hayes stood up, buttoned his coat and began walking leisurely\naway from the trap. At twenty paces, he whirled. It was almost too fast\nfor the eye to follow, but the individual actions were these:\n\nWith his left hand, Hayes unbuttoned his coat. With his right, he swept\nopen the coat, turned in a crouch, simultaneously drew the revolver,\nand fired. The ashtray assumed a new identity--a scattered pile of\nbroken glass.\n\nIt all happened in measurably less than a second.\n\nThere was a collective expiration of breath from the men around the\ntable.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore breakfast the next morning, there wasn't a single one of the\nsmall group of men intimately involved with the top-priority problem\nwho did not know that Hayes had failed.\n\nThis was shocking enough in itself, but what made it even more so was\nthe fact that Hayes was still alive to tell it--and that anyone else\nwas there to hear him.\n\n\"I came as close as hell to swearing,\" Hayes said dully to Wilmer and\nFlinn.\n\nNeither of them needed any special powers of observation to see that\nthe young agent was shaken. The three sat in the small Pentagon\noffice. Coffee had been served, and they were waiting now for a quorum\nof the governmental officials to gather.\n\n\"I had it lined,\" Hayes continued. \"I'd waited half the night for\neverything to be just right. I was in a good position, close and to one\nside. Dobbs was as relaxed as I've ever seen him. I was just telling\nmyself '_Now_' when Dobbs looked directly at me and grinned. 'If you're\nplanning on doing anything rash, my friend, don't. You can't possibly\nkill me swiftly enough to keep from destroying yourself, every person\nin this room, every man, woman, and child in this city, and every\nliving thing on the face of this Earth.' _What could I do?_\"\n\n\"Thank God you didn't figure it was just a bluff!\" Wilmer exclaimed.\n\"Pulling that trigger would have been the greatest blunder in history.\"\n\n\"Move and countermove,\" Flinn mused. \"It was our gambit and we were\nchecked before we started.\"\n\n\"So I got on the open line and told the boys to fetch Flinn as quickly\nas possible,\" Hayes went on. \"But I still don't understand. I'd swear\nthat man read my mind.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Flinn said. \"I've had two mental contacts with\nDobbs, and neither time did I get the least suggestion that he was\ntelepathic.\"\n\n\"No need for him to be,\" Wilmer said. \"It doesn't take a smart man to\nput two and two together and arrive at four. And this man is more than\nmerely smart.\"\n\n\"I suppose you're right,\" Hayes said, \"but it sure knocked the props\nout from under me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were all in attendance, most of them looking rumpled and gritty\nfrom lack of sleep and the realization that they had been beaten.\n\n\"I just don't know,\" a senator said wearily. \"First a man who can\ninfluence matter, then one who reads minds, and now the latter tells us\nthe former is inviolable. It's too much for me.\"\n\n\"I refuse to accept defeat!\" a fleet admiral thundered, bringing his\nfist down upon the table explosively. He was an erect, bristling man\nwith an aggressive combat record in two wars. \"We've lost the first\nround--so what? There will be others.\"\n\n\"I quite agree,\" the Presidential assistant said. \"This man _must_ be\ndestroyed. Already he's beginning to make impossible demands.\"\n\n\"But how do we go about it?\" a congressman said. \"Personally, I think\nwe're licked. As far as I can see, the best thing to do is let him have\nhis head and hope for the best.\"\n\n\"_Hope for the best?_\" a man from a security agency echoed\nincredulously. \"It's power Dobbs wants--recognized power. He wants to\nbe feared and worshipped. Sooner or later he'll let everyone know. His\negotism will force it. Can you conceive of what that would mean? For\nmyself, I'd rather see the entire human race disappear in one flash of\nfire without ever knowing what hit it than live under the thumb of the\nfear of destruction!\"\n\n\"Gentlemen!\" The Presidential assistant rapped for order. \"Let's\nexamine the situation rationally and seek out the flaws. There must be\nsome somewhere. Nothing in the mind of man is perfect.\"\n\n\"Well, this comes as close as anything,\" Wilmer interjected. \"You ask\nwhat's wrong with the direct approach--why not shoot him while he\nsleeps? Well, I'll answer with some questions. Have any of you died as\nthe result of a bullet in the brain? Have you ever questioned anyone\nwho has been killed in that manner? Then how do we know there isn't\na microsecond of awareness before life is extinguished? And even--or\nespecially--on the subconscious level, isn't this enough time for a\npreset signal? What's the time-lag between countdown zero and the\nexplosion of a thermonuclear bomb?\"\n\n\"Apparently he has us blocked in every way,\" Flinn picked up Wilmer's\nargument. \"Asleep or awake. Conscious or unconscious. It's all the\nsame. Think of it as a special circuit in his mind. Destroy Dobbs, the\ncircuit shorts, and this preset signal to the oxygen atoms is sent,\ntheir nuclei fuse, and that's the end of everything.\"\n\nHe scanned the faces of the men around the conference table. \"Or think\nof it as a hypnotic suggestion. Under hypnosis, an individual is given\na certain order that he is to carry out whenever a certain set of\ncircumstances or stimuli occurs. No matter when this happens, no matter\nwhat he is doing or thinking when the moment arrives, the subject\nreacts according to the order buried in his subconscious.\"\n\n\"But for every move there is a countermove,\" the admiral argued. \"This\nis a situation. A fantastic one, but a situation. There has to be an\nanswer.\"\n\n\"I think there is,\" Flinn said carefully, \"but it could be very risky.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was up to the committee now. The decision rested squarely in the lap\nof the United States Government. Flinn had stated his ideas, presented\nhis plan, and tried to give the odds--although in his heart he knew\nthat was impossible--so it was now out of his hands.\n\nOr was it?\n\nThe parapsychologist lay on the bed in his hotel room, trying to\nrelax, trying to store up energy for the ordeal that might be imminent.\nHayes and Wilmer were in the room, too, awaiting word from the heavily\nguarded conference chamber in the Pentagon.\n\nThe thin physicist paced up and down, his tanned face a study in\nstrain. Wilmer had been with this as long as anyone, except Dobbs, and\nFlinn found himself wondering what deep inner resources the man had\ntapped to retain his sanity.\n\nThe big federal agent slouched in a chair, looking at nothing. He had\nlapsed again into the welcome protection of training and discipline.\n\nSeveral times during the past thirty hours, since presenting his\nplan, Flinn had had to restrain himself from probing the minds of\nhis two associates. At a time like this, no one had the right to\ninvade another's privacy. And curiosity had to give way for another\nreason--just one look into either of their minds might be enough to\nweaken or shatter his own resolve.\n\nThe classic dilemma. Do nothing and face a living hell. Act and court\ndestruction. The very simplicity of the alternatives made the problem\nintolerable.\n\nTelehypnosis--the untried hypothesis.\n\n_Good Lord!_ Flinn told himself. _I'm not even proficient as a\ntelepath yet!_\n\nOutside, he could hear the murmur of the city--the traffic, the people,\nmoving along their separate paths to their own destinations in the\nhumid afternoon heat.\n\nWell, anyway, once the complete curtain of security had fallen, there\nhad been no more leaks. Proving that if a secret was big enough, it\ncould be kept.\n\nAnother classic problem. Do the people have the right to be informed?\nDoes forewarned really mean forearmed? And how about the other nations\nof the world?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour after the dinner dishes had been cleared away by the government\nagent dubbing as a room-service waiter, the telephone rang with an\nawful insistency.\n\nWilmer was the closest, but Hayes beat him to it by a full stride.\n\nAfter identifying himself, Hayes listened in silence. Then he said,\n\"All right,\" and replaced the receiver.\n\nHe nodded at Wilmer and Flinn.\n\n\"It's go ahead.\" He paused and his face seemed to change--to relent\nsomehow. \"And they wanted me to relay this message: The President says,\n'May God be with you.'\"\n\nFlinn felt very alone and very close to something terrible.\n\nIn the gloom of the darkened bedroom that adjoined Dobbs', he could\nsee Wilmer silhouetted against the meager light that came through the\ncurtained window from the street lamp outside and Hayes was out in the\nhall. But the knowledge of the proximity of the two men did nothing\nto lessen Flinn's loneliness. The committee had even couched it as an\norder, trying to relieve him of that small burden, but if he failed,\nwho would remain to accept the blame?\n\nA few times in his forty-two years had Flinn wondered how it would feel\nto have the fate of the world riding upon his shoulders. Now he knew\nand wished he didn't.\n\nThe door opened silently and Hayes eased in.\n\n\"He's asleep,\" the agent breathed in a barely audible voice. \"You can\nstart anytime now.\"\n\nThe plan was simple, deceptively so.\n\nSince Dobbs' block was a kind of self-hypnotic thing, why not\ncountermand it with a deeper hypnotic suggestion introduced by\ntelepathy? If it could be done and was strong enough, the second would\ncounteract the first. At least for a short time.\n\nThere were terrifying flaws--the first one obvious, the second not so\neasily seen.\n\nSuppose Dobbs' block had inherent within it an anti-disturbance\nfeature that might react to any interference, including hypnotism\nin any form? Then the result would be an immediate \"short-circuit\"\nand--disaster.\n\nTrembling with the responsibility that was upon him, Flinn forced\nhimself into a deep concentration, an almost cataleptic trance. All\ndetails of the room faded from his consciousness. There was the\nfamiliar gray, swirling mist, and, for what seemed an intolerably long\ntime, he fought to make contact with the sleeping man's mind. He almost\nsobbed aloud from the effort.\n\nThen at last he found it, entered, and gradually pushed down through\nthe subconscious.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was seeking now, probing for the deep-seated level of the block that\nhe had discovered the second time he had investigated Dobbs' mind.\n\nIt was very difficult with the sleeping man and, before he found\nit, more than once he felt himself standing on the precipice of the\nunknown, close to slipping away into a fright-filled nothingness.\n\nFinally, he had it, clear and cold. The strange, unhuman, inscrutable\narea that was in diabolical rapport with the basic stuff of one element\nof the atmosphere. Flinn lingered there for a while, wondering again\nwhy he could not read it completely, then forced himself on and on,\ndeeper and deeper, until at last he felt the limit had been reached.\n\nHis own warning thought intruded, telling him that this was the place.\nAnd the time for the first test was at hand. He could not afford the\nluxury of another pause. His resolve might crack....\n\nThe thought arced like a high-voltage spark, the preamble of the\ncounter-suggestion: _You are to do nothing. No matter what happens, no\nmatter what is done to you, you are to take no action whatsoever. You\nare not to react. You are to do nothing. You are to disregard every\nthought but this._\n\nThe battle had been joined. The interference had bridged the gap--yet\nthe block remained dormant!\n\nThe first hurdle had been cleared.\n\nFor the better part of three hours, Flinn continued to transmit the\ncounter-suggestion. Although he was not aware of it, sweat rolled from\nevery pore of his body and his nerves spasmed in unfelt agony.\n\nSomething happened.\n\nFlinn lost contact as a shrill of warnings welled through Dobbs' mind.\n\nA second later, the door opened and Hayes' voice hissed: \"He's awake!\"\n\nFlinn returned to awareness slowly. First he was conscious only of how\ntired he was, and then he knew that a voice was trying to reach him,\nand he felt a handkerchief swabbing at his face.\n\nWilmer bent over him in the gloom.\n\nHayes said in Flinn's ear: \"Dobbs is awake. He knows something's wrong.\nHe's moving around in there.\"\n\n\"Then go ahead,\" Flinn heard his voice say. \"There won't be a better\ntime.\"\n\n\"Maybe we should wait,\" Wilmer cautioned.\n\n\"No! Do it now. Hurry!\"\n\nThe agent stiffened, stepped back, and disappeared.\n\nThey heard the door to Dobbs' room open and close and the sound of\nvoices.\n\nThere was an exclamation, then Dobb's voice shouting: \"What are you\ndoing? Are you crazy? I warn you, _I'll take every one of you with\nme_!\" Then a sudden explosion, muffled, but still shockingly loud, and\nthe thump of a heavy object falling.\n\nFlinn could not bring himself to move a muscle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe silence seemed absolute. It was as if even the house itself were\nlistening, straining, preparing itself for the inevitable.\n\nOne second passed.\n\nTwo.\n\nFive.\n\nTen.\n\n_Nothing happened._\n\nAbruptly, Wilmer shouted: \"It's all over!\"\n\nFlinn heard footfalls upon the stairs and the sound of excited voices.\n\nHayes burst into the room and turned on the light, the .357 magnum\nstill in his hand. His face was pale; his mouth worked, but no sound\nemerged.\n\nFlinn found that his muscles would obey him now, and he stood up and\nheaded for the door. He felt numb, drained. He stepped out into the\nhall. Every special agent and security man on the premises was crowded\nthere.\n\nFlinn turned back to Hayes.\n\n\"I never thought to ask before,\" Flinn said. \"Dobbs--did he have any\nclose living relatives? A wife? Children?\"\n\nHayes shook his head.\n\n\"Thank God for that!\" Flinn said.\n\nHe started down the hall toward the stairs. The men there grew silent\nas he approached and moved soundlessly out of his way.\n\nHe went down the stairs, through the room off the kitchen, and outside\nto the driveway. He looked up at the dark sky.\n\n_It's over_, he told himself. _And now I'm a murderer. All of us are. A\nguilt shared by the few to save the many. But the few are the product\nof the many, just as each individual is, so where are we to place the\nblame?_\n\nTwenty years of research, and where had it led?\n\nSomewhere he had failed as society had failed, and, even in success,\nFlinn could feel no flush of victory.\n\nThe Earth was safe, but every human upon it had died a little without\neven knowing it.\n\n_Yes, it's over_, Flinn thought finally. _For now. Until the next time._\n\nHe could see no stars. In a while it would be dawn.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Death's Wisher, by Jim Wannamaker\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DEATH'S WISHER ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51767.txt or 51767.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/7/6/51767/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
