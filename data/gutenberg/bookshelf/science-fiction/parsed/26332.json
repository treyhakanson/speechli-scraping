FOR EDIE\n\nBy J. F. BONE\n\nIllustrated by Schoenherr\n\n[Illustration]\n\n    _The Committee had, unquestionably, made a mistake. There\n    was no doubt that Edie had achieved the long-sought cancer\n    cure ... but awarding the Nobel Prize was, nonetheless, a\n    mistake ..._\n\n\nThe letter from America arrived too late. The Committee had regarded\nacceptance as a foregone conclusion, for no one since Boris Pasternak\nhad turned down a Nobel Prize. So when Professor Doctor Nels Christianson\nopened the letter, there was not the slightest fear on his part, or on that\nof his fellow committeemen, Dr. Eric Carlstrom and Dr. Sven Eklund, that\nthe letter would be anything other than the usual routine acceptance.\n\n\"At last we learn the identity of this great research worker,\" Christianson\nmurmured as he scanned the closely typed sheets. Carlstrom and Eklund\nwaited impatiently, wondering at the peculiar expression that fixed itself\non Christianson's face. Fine beads of sweat appeared on the professor's\nhigh narrow forehead as he laid the letter down. \"Well,\" he said heavily,\n\"now we know.\"\n\n\"Know what?\" Eklund demanded. \"What does it say? Does she accept?\"\n\n\"She accepts,\" Christianson said in a peculiar half-strangled tone as he\npassed the letter to Eklund. \"See for yourself.\"\n\nEklund's reaction was different. His face was a mottled reddish white as\nhe finished the letter and handed it across the table to Carlstrom. \"Why,\"\nhe demanded of no one in particular, \"did this have to happen to us?\"\n\n\"It was bound to happen sometime,\" Carlstrom said. \"It's just our\nmisfortune that it happened to us.\" He chuckled as he passed the letter\nback to Christianson. \"At least this year the presentation should be an\nevent worth remembering.\"\n\n\"It seems that we have a little problem,\" Christianson said, making what\nwould probably be the understatement of the century. Possibly there would\nbe greater understatements in the remaining ninety-nine years of the\nTwenty-first Century, but Carlstrom doubted it. \"We certainly have our\nnecks out,\" he agreed.\n\n\"We can't do it!\" Eklund exploded. \"We simply can't award the Nobel Prize\nin medicine and physiology to that ... that _C. Edie_!\" He sputtered into\nsilence.\n\n\"We can hardly do anything else,\" Christianson said. \"There's no\nquestion as to the identity of the winner. Dr. Hanson's letter makes\nthat unmistakably clear. And there's no question that the award is\ndeserved.\"\n\n\"We still could award it to someone else,\" Eklund said.\n\n\"Not a chance. We've already said too much to the press. It's known all\nover the world that the medical award is going to the discoverer of the\nbasic cause of cancer, to the founder of modern neoplastic therapy.\"\nChristianson grimaced. \"If we changed our decision now, there'd be all\nsorts of embarrassing questions from the press.\"\n\n\"I can see it now,\" Carlstrom said, \"the banquet, the table, the flowers,\nand Professor Doctor Nels Christianson in formal dress with the Order\nof St. Olaf gleaming across his white shirtfront, standing before that\ndistinguished audience and announcing: 'The Nobel Prize in Medicine and\nPhysiology is awarded to--' and then that deadly hush when the audience\nsees the winner.\"\n\n\"You needn't rub it in,\" Christianson said unhappily. \"I can see it, too.\"\n\n\"These Americans!\" Eklund said bitterly. He wiped his damp forehead. The\npicture Carlstrom had drawn was accurate but hardly appealing. \"One simply\ncan't trust them. Publishing a report as important as that as a laboratory\nrelease. They should have given proper credit.\"\n\n\"They did,\" Carlstrom said. \"They did--precisely. But the world, including\nus, was too stupid to see it. We have only ourselves to blame.\"\n\n\"If it weren't for the fact that the work was inspired and effective,\"\nChristianson muttered, \"we might have a chance of salvaging this situation.\nBut through its application ninety-five per cent of cancers are now\ncurable. It is obviously the outstanding contribution to medicine in the\npast five decades.\"\n\n\"But we must consider the source,\" Eklund protested. \"This award will make\nthe prize for medicine a laughingstock. No doctor will ever accept another.\nIf we go through with this, we might as well forget about the medical award\nfrom now on. This will be its swan song. It hits too close to home. Too\nmany people have been saying similar things about our profession and its\ntrend toward specialization. And to have the Nobel Prize confirm them\nwould alienate every doctor in the world. We simply can't do it.\"\n\n\"Yet who else has made a comparable discovery? Or one that is even half as\nimportant?\" Christianson asked.\n\n\"That's a good question,\" Carlstrom said, \"and a good answer to it\nisn't going to be easy to find. For my part, I can only wish that Alphax\nLaboratories had displayed an interest in literature rather than medicine.\nThen our colleagues at the Academy could have had the painful decision.\"\n\n\"Their task would be easier than ours,\" Christianson said wearily. \"After\nall, the criteria of art are more flexible. Medicine, unfortunately, is\nbased upon facts.\"\n\n\"That's the hell of it,\" Carlstrom said.\n\n\"There must be some way to solve this problem,\" Eklund said. \"After all\nit was a perfectly natural mistake. We never suspected that Alphax was a\nphysical rather than a biological sciences laboratory. Perhaps that might\noffer grounds--\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Carlstrom interrupted. \"The means in this case aren't\nas important as the results, and we can't deny that the cancer problem is\nvirtually solved.\"\n\n\"Even though men have been saying for the past two generations that the\nanswer was probably in the literature and all that was needed was someone\nwith the intelligence and the time to put the facts together, the fact\nremains that it was C. Edie who did the job. And it required quite a bit\nmore than merely collecting facts. Intelligence and original thinking of\na high order was involved.\" Christianson sighed.\n\n\"Some_one_,\" Eklund said bitterly. \"Some _thing_ you mean. _C.\nEdie_--C.E.D.--Computer, Extrapolating, Discriminatory. Manufactured\nby Alphax Laboratories, Trenton, New Jersey, U.S.A. _C. Edie!_\nAmericans!!--always naming things. A machine wins the Nobel Prize.\nIt's fantastic!\"\n\nChristianson shook his head. \"It's not fantastic, unfortunately. And I\nsee no way out. We can't even award the prize to the team of engineers who\ndesigned and built Edie. Dr. Hanson is right when he says the discovery was\nEdie's and not the engineers'. It would be like giving the prize to Albert\nEinstein's parents because they created him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Is there any way we can keep the presentation secret?\" Eklund asked.\n\n\"I'm afraid not. The presentations are public. We've done too good a job\npublicizing the Nobel Prize. As a telecast item, it's almost the equal of\nthe motion picture Academy Award.\"\n\n\"I can imagine the reaction when our candidate is revealed in all her\nmetallic glory. A two-meter cube of steel filled with microminiaturized\ncircuits, complete with flashing lights and cogwheels,\" Carlstrom chuckled.\n\"And where are you going to hang the medal?\"\n\nChristianson shivered. \"I wish you wouldn't give that metal nightmare a\npersonality,\" he said. \"It unnerves me. Personally, I wish that Dr. Hanson,\nAlphax Laboratories, and Edie were all at the bottom of the ocean--in some\nnice deep spot like the Mariannas Trench.\" He shrugged. \"Of course, we\nwon't have that sort of luck, so we'll have to make the best of it.\"\n\n\"It just goes to show that you can't trust Americans,\" Eklund said. \"I've\nalways thought we should keep our awards on this side of the Atlantic where\npeople are sane and civilized. Making a personality out of a computer--ugh!\nI suppose it's their idea of a joke.\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" Christianson said. \"They just like to name things--preferably\nwith female names. It's a form of insecurity, the mother fixation. But\nthat's not important. I'm afraid, gentlemen, that we shall have to make\nthe award as we have planned. I can see no way out. After all, there's no\nreason why the machine cannot receive the prize. The conditions merely\nstate that it is to be presented to the one, regardless of nationality,\nwho makes the greatest contribution to medicine or physiology.\"\n\n\"I wonder how His Majesty will take it,\" Carlstrom said.\n\n\"The king! I'd forgotten that!\" Eklund gasped.\n\n\"I expect he'll have to take it,\" Christianson said. \"He might even\nappreciate the humor in the situation.\"\n\n\"Gustaf Adolf is a good king, but there are limits,\" Eklund observed.\n\n\"There are other considerations,\" Christianson replied. \"After all, Edie is\nthe reason the Crown Prince is still alive, and Gustaf is fond of his son.\"\n\n\"After all these years?\"\n\nChristianson smiled. Swedish royalty _was_ long-lived. It was something\nof a standing joke that King Gustaf would probably outlast the pyramids,\nproviding the pyramids lived in Sweden. \"I'm sure His Majesty will\ncooperate. He has a strong sense of duty and since the real problem is\nhis, not ours, I doubt if he will shirk it.\"\n\n\"How do you figure that?\" Eklund asked.\n\n\"We merely select the candidates according to the rules, and according\nto the nature of their contribution. Edie is obviously the outstanding\ncandidate in medicine for this year. It deserves the prize. We would\nbe compromising with principle if we did not award it fairly.\"\n\n\"I suppose you're right,\" Eklund said gloomily. \"I can't think of any\nreasonable excuse to deny the award.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" Carlstrom said. \"But what did you mean by that remark about\nthis being the king's problem?\"\n\n\"You forget,\" Christianson said mildly. \"Of all of us, the king has the\nmost difficult part. As you know, the Nobel Prize is formally presented\nat a State banquet.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"His Majesty is the host,\" Christianson said. \"And just how does one eat\ndinner with an electronic computer?\"\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTES\n\n\nThis etext was produced from Analog Science Fact and Science Fiction\nApril 1961.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
