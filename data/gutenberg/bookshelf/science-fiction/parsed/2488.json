What creatures inhabit, or could inhabit,\nthose regions twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water?\nIt's almost beyond conjecture.\"\n\nJules Verne (1828-1905) published the French equivalents of these words\nin 1869, and little has changed since.  126 years later, a Time\ncover story on deep-sea exploration made much the same admission:\n\"We know more about Mars than we know about the oceans.\"\nThis reality begins to explain the dark power and otherworldly\nfascination of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas.\n\nBorn in the French river town of Nantes, Verne had a lifelong\npassion for the sea.  First as a Paris stockbroker, later as a\ncelebrated author and yachtsman, he went on frequent voyages--\nto Britain, America, the Mediterranean.  But the specific stimulus\nfor this novel was an 1865 fan letter from a fellow writer,\nMadame George Sand.  She praised Verne's two early novels Five Weeks\nin a Balloon (1863) and Journey to the Center of the Earth\n(1864), then added:  \"Soon I hope you'll take us into the ocean depths,\nyour characters traveling in diving equipment perfected by your\nscience and your imagination.\"  Thus inspired, Verne created one\nof literature's great rebels, a freedom fighter who plunged beneath\nthe waves to wage a unique form of guerilla warfare.\n\nInitially, Verne's narrative was influenced by the 1863 uprising of\nPoland against Tsarist Russia.  The Poles were quashed with a violence\nthat appalled not only Verne but all Europe.  As originally conceived,\nVerne's Captain Nemo was a Polish nobleman whose entire family\nhad been slaughtered by Russian troops.  Nemo builds a fabulous\nfuturistic submarine, the Nautilus, then conducts an underwater\ncampaign of vengeance against his imperialist oppressor.\n\nBut in the 1860s France had to treat the Tsar as an ally,\nand Verne's publisher Pierre Hetzel pronounced the book unprintable.\nVerne reworked its political content, devising new nationalities for\nNemo and his great enemy--information revealed only in a later novel,\nThe Mysterious Island (1875); in the present work Nemo's background\nremains a dark secret.  In all, the novel had a difficult gestation.\nVerne and Hetzel were in constant conflict and the book went\nthrough multiple drafts, struggles reflected in its several\nworking titles over the period 1865-69: early on, it was variously\ncalled Voyage Under the Waters, Twenty-five Thousand Leagues Under\nthe Waters, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Waters,\nand A Thousand Leagues Under the Oceans.\n\nVerne is often dubbed, in Isaac Asimov's phrase, \"the world's\nfirst science-fiction writer.\"  And it's true, many of his\nsixty-odd books do anticipate future events and technologies:\nFrom the Earth to the Moon (1865) and Hector Servadac (1877) deal\nin space travel, while Journey to the Center\n\nof the Earth features travel to the earth's core.  But with Verne\nthe operative word is \"travel,\" and some of his best-known titles\ndon't really qualify as sci-fi: Around the World in Eighty Days\n(1872) and Michael Strogoff (1876) are closer to \"travelogs\"--\nadventure yarns in far-away places.\n\nThese observations partly apply here.  The subtitle of the present\nbook is An Underwater Tour of the World, so in good travelog style,\nthe Nautilus's exploits supply an episodic story line.\nShark attacks, giant squid, cannibals, hurricanes, whale hunts,\nand other rip-roaring adventures erupt almost at random.  Yet this loose\nstructure gives the novel an air of documentary realism.  What's more,\nVerne adds backbone to the action by developing three recurring motifs:\nthe deepening mystery of Nemo's past life and future intentions,\nthe mounting tension between Nemo and hot-tempered harpooner Ned Land,\nand Ned's ongoing schemes to escape from the Nautilus.  These unifying\nthreads tighten the narrative and accelerate its momentum.\n\nOther subtleties occur inside each episode, the textures sparkling\nwith wit, information, and insight.  Verne regards the sea from\nmany angles:  in the domain of marine biology, he gives us thumbnail\nsketches of fish, seashells, coral, sometimes in great catalogs\nthat swirl past like musical cascades; in the realm of geology,\nhe studies volcanoes literally inside and out; in the world of commerce,\nhe celebrates the high-energy entrepreneurs who lay the Atlantic Cable\nor dig the Suez Canal.  And Verne's marine engineering proves\nespecially authoritative.  His specifications for an open-sea submarine\nand a self-contained diving suit were decades before their time,\nyet modern technology bears them out triumphantly.\n\nTrue, today's scientists know a few things he didn't: the South Pole\nisn't at the water's edge but far inland; sharks don't flip\nover before attacking; giant squid sport ten tentacles not eight;\nsperm whales don't prey on their whalebone cousins.  This notwithstanding,\nVerne furnishes the most evocative portrayal of the ocean depths\nbefore the arrival of Jacques Cousteau and technicolor film.\n\nLastly the book has stature as a novel of character.  Even the\nsupporting cast is shrewdly drawn:  Professor Aronnax, the career\nscientist caught in an ethical conflict; Conseil, the compulsive\nclassifier who supplies humorous tag lines for Verne's fast facts;\nthe harpooner Ned Land, a creature of constant appetites,\nman as heroic animal.\n\nBut much of the novel's brooding power comes from Captain Nemo.\nInventor, musician, Renaissance genius, he's a trail-blazing creation,\nthe prototype not only for countless renegade scientists in\npopular fiction, but even for such varied figures as Sherlock Holmes\nor Wolf Larsen.  However, Verne gives his hero's brilliance\nand benevolence a dark underside--the man's obsessive hate for his\nold enemy.  This compulsion leads Nemo into ugly contradictions:\nhe's a fighter for freedom, yet all who board his ship are imprisoned\nthere for good; he works to save lives, both human and animal,\nyet he himself creates a holocaust; he detests imperialism,\nyet he lays personal claim to the South Pole.  And in this last action\nhe falls into the classic sin of Pride.  He's swiftly punished.\nThe Nautilus nearly perishes in the Antarctic and Nemo sinks into\na growing depression.\n\nLike Shakespeare's King Lear he courts death and madness in a great storm,\nthen commits mass murder, collapses in catatonic paralysis,\nand suicidally runs his ship into the ocean's most dangerous whirlpool.\nHate swallows him whole.\n\nFor many, then, this book has been a source of fascination,\nsurely one of the most influential novels ever written, an inspiration\nfor such scientists and discoverers as engineer Simon Lake,\noceanographer William Beebe, polar traveler Sir Ernest Shackleton.\nLikewise Dr. Robert D. Ballard, finder of the sunken Titanic,\nconfesses that this was his favorite book as a teenager,\nand Cousteau himself, most renowned of marine explorers, called it\nhis shipboard bible.\n\nThe present translation is a faithful yet communicative rendering\nof the original French texts published in Paris by J. Hetzel et Cie.--\nthe hardcover first edition issued in the autumn of 1871,\ncollated with the softcover editions of the First and Second Parts\nissued separately in the autumn of 1869 and the summer of 1870.\nAlthough prior English versions have often been heavily abridged,\nthis new translation is complete to the smallest substantive detail.\n\nBecause, as that Time cover story suggests, we still haven't caught\nup with Verne.  Even in our era of satellite dishes and video games,\nthe seas keep their secrets.  We've seen progress in sonar, torpedoes,\nand other belligerent machinery, but sailors and scientists--\nto say nothing of tourists--have yet to voyage in a submarine\nwith the luxury and efficiency of the Nautilus.\n\nF.

If it was a cetacean, it exceeded in bulk any whale\npreviously classified by science.  No naturalist, neither Cuvier nor\nLac\u00e9p\u010dde, neither Professor Dumeril nor Professor de Quatrefages,\nwould have accepted the existence of such a monster sight unseen--\nspecifically, unseen by their own scientific eyes.\n\nStriking an average of observations taken at different times--\nrejecting those timid estimates that gave the object a length\nof 200 feet, and ignoring those exaggerated views that saw it\nas a mile wide and three long--you could still assert that this\nphenomenal creature greatly exceeded the dimensions of anything\nthen known to ichthyologists, if it existed at all.\n\nNow then, it did exist, this was an undeniable fact; and since\nthe human mind dotes on objects of wonder, you can understand\nthe worldwide excitement caused by this unearthly apparition.\nAs for relegating it to the realm of fiction, that charge had\nto be dropped.\n\nIn essence, on July 20, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson,\nfrom the Calcutta & Burnach Steam Navigation Co., encountered this\nmoving mass five miles off the eastern shores of Australia.\n\nCaptain Baker at first thought he was in the presence of an unknown reef;\nhe was even about to fix its exact position when two waterspouts\nshot out of this inexplicable object and sprang hissing into the air\nsome 150 feet.  So, unless this reef was subject to the intermittent\neruptions of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had fair and honest\ndealings with some aquatic mammal, until then unknown, that could\nspurt from its blowholes waterspouts mixed with air and steam.\n\nSimilar events were likewise observed in Pacific seas, on July 23\nof the same year, by the Christopher Columbus from the West India\n& Pacific Steam Navigation Co.  Consequently, this extraordinary\ncetacean could transfer itself from one locality to another with\nstartling swiftness, since within an interval of just three days,\nthe Governor Higginson and the Christopher Columbus had observed\nit at two positions on the charts separated by a distance of more\nthan 700 nautical leagues.\n\nFifteen days later and 2,000 leagues farther, the Helvetia from\nthe Compagnie Nationale and the Shannon from the Royal Mail line,\nrunning on opposite tacks in that part of the Atlantic lying\nbetween the United States and Europe, respectively signaled each\nother that the monster had been sighted in latitude 42 degrees 15'\nnorth and longitude 60 degrees 35' west of the meridian\nof Greenwich.  From their simultaneous observations, they were able\nto estimate the mammal's minimum length at more than 350 English\nfeet;* this was because both the Shannon and the Helvetia were of\nsmaller dimensions, although each measured 100 meters stem to stern.\nNow then, the biggest whales, those rorqual whales that frequent\nthe waterways of the Aleutian Islands, have never exceeded a length\nof 56 meters--if they reach even that.\n\n*Author's Note:  About 106 meters.  An English foot is\nonly 30.4 centimeters.\n\nOne after another, reports arrived that would profoundly affect\npublic opinion:  new observations taken by the transatlantic\nliner Pereire, the Inman line's Etna running afoul of the monster,\nan official report drawn up by officers on the French frigate Normandy,\ndead-earnest reckonings obtained by the general staff of\nCommodore Fitz-James aboard the Lord Clyde.  In lighthearted countries,\npeople joked about this phenomenon, but such serious, practical countries\nas England, America, and Germany were deeply concerned.\n\nIn every big city the monster was the latest rage; they sang\nabout it in the coffee houses, they ridiculed it in the newspapers,\nthey dramatized it in the theaters.  The tabloids found it a fine\nopportunity for hatching all sorts of hoaxes.  In those newspapers\nshort of copy, you saw the reappearance of every gigantic\nimaginary creature, from \"Moby Dick,\" that dreadful white whale from\nthe High Arctic regions, to the stupendous kraken whose tentacles\ncould entwine a 500-ton craft and drag it into the ocean depths.\nThey even reprinted reports from ancient times:  the views\nof Aristotle and Pliny accepting the existence of such monsters,\nthen the Norwegian stories of Bishop Pontoppidan, the narratives\nof Paul Egede, and finally the reports of Captain Harrington--\nwhose good faith is above suspicion--in which he claims he saw,\nwhile aboard the Castilian in 1857, one of those enormous\nserpents that, until then, had frequented only the seas of France's\nold extremist newspaper, The Constitutionalist.\n\nAn interminable debate then broke out between believers and\nskeptics in the scholarly societies and scientific journals.\nThe \"monster question\" inflamed all minds.  During this\nmemorable campaign, journalists making a profession of science\nbattled with those making a profession of wit, spilling waves of ink\nand some of them even two or three drops of blood, since they went\nfrom sea serpents to the most offensive personal remarks.\n\nFor six months the war seesawed.  With inexhaustible zest,\nthe popular press took potshots at feature articles from\nthe Geographic Institute of Brazil, the Royal Academy of Science\nin Berlin, the British Association, the Smithsonian Institution\nin Washington, D.C., at discussions in The Indian Archipelago,\nin Cosmos published by Father Moigno, in Petermann's Mittheilungen,*\nand at scientific chronicles in the great French and foreign newspapers.\nWhen the monster's detractors cited a saying by the botanist Linnaeus\nthat \"nature doesn't make leaps,\" witty writers in the popular\nperiodicals parodied it, maintaining in essence that \"nature doesn't\nmake lunatics,\" and ordering their contemporaries never to give\nthe lie to nature by believing in krakens, sea serpents, \"Moby Dicks,\"\nand other all-out efforts from drunken seamen.  Finally, in a much-feared\nsatirical journal, an article by its most popular columnist finished\noff the monster for good, spurning it in the style of Hippolytus\nrepulsing the amorous advances of his stepmother Phaedra, and giving\nthe creature its quietus amid a universal burst of laughter.\nWit had defeated science.\n\n*German: \"Bulletin.\"  Ed.\n\nDuring the first months of the year 1867, the question seemed to\nbe buried, and it didn't seem due for resurrection, when new facts\nwere brought to the public's attention.  But now it was no longer\nan issue of a scientific problem to be solved, but a quite real and\nserious danger to be avoided.  The question took an entirely new turn.\nThe monster again became an islet, rock, or reef, but a runaway reef,\nunfixed and elusive.\n\nOn March 5, 1867, the Moravian from the Montreal Ocean Co., lying\nduring the night in latitude 27 degrees 30' and longitude 72\ndegrees 15', ran its starboard quarter afoul of a rock marked on no\ncharts of these waterways.  Under the combined efforts of wind and\n400-horsepower steam, it was traveling at a speed of thirteen knots.\nWithout the high quality of its hull, the Moravian would surely have\nsplit open from this collision and gone down together with those 237\npassengers it was bringing back from Canada.\n\nThis accident happened around five o'clock in the morning, just as day was\nbeginning to break.  The officers on watch rushed to the craft's stern.\nThey examined the ocean with the most scrupulous care.\nThey saw nothing except a strong eddy breaking three cable\nlengths out, as if those sheets of water had been violently churned.\nThe site's exact bearings were taken, and the Moravian continued on\ncourse apparently undamaged.  Had it run afoul of an underwater rock\nor the wreckage of some enormous derelict ship?  They were unable to say.\nBut when they examined its undersides in the service yard,\nthey discovered that part of its keel had been smashed.\n\nThis occurrence, extremely serious in itself, might perhaps have\nbeen forgotten like so many others, if three weeks later it hadn't\nbeen reenacted under identical conditions.  Only, thanks to the\nnationality of the ship victimized by this new ramming, and thanks\nto the reputation of the company to which this ship belonged,\nthe event caused an immense uproar.\n\nNo one is unaware of the name of that famous English shipowner,\nCunard.  In 1840 this shrewd industrialist founded a postal service\nbetween Liverpool and Halifax, featuring three wooden ships with\n400-horsepower paddle wheels and a burden of 1,162 metric tons.\nEight years later, the company's assets were increased by four\n650-horsepower ships at 1,820 metric tons, and in two more years,\nby two other vessels of still greater power and tonnage.\nIn 1853 the Cunard Co., whose mail-carrying charter had just been renewed,\nsuccessively added to its assets the Arabia, the Persia, the China,\nthe Scotia, the Java, and the Russia, all ships of top speed and,\nafter the Great Eastern, the biggest ever to plow the seas.\nSo in 1867 this company owned twelve ships, eight with paddle wheels\nand four with propellers.\n\nIf I give these highly condensed details, it is so everyone can fully\nunderstand the importance of this maritime transportation company,\nknown the world over for its shrewd management.  No transoceanic\nnavigational undertaking has been conducted with more ability,\nno business dealings have been crowned with greater success.\nIn twenty-six years Cunard ships have made 2,000 Atlantic crossings\nwithout so much as a voyage canceled, a delay recorded, a man, a craft,\nor even a letter lost.  Accordingly, despite strong competition\nfrom France, passengers still choose the Cunard line in preference\nto all others, as can be seen in a recent survey of official documents.\nGiven this, no one will be astonished at the uproar provoked by this\naccident involving one of its finest steamers.\n\nOn April 13, 1867, with a smooth sea and a moderate breeze,\nthe Scotia lay in longitude 15 degrees 12' and latitude 45 degrees\n37'. It was traveling at a speed of 13.43 knots under the thrust\nof its 1,000-horsepower engines.  Its paddle wheels were churning\nthe sea with perfect steadiness.  It was then drawing 6.7 meters\nof water and displacing 6,624 cubic meters.\n\nAt 4:17 in the afternoon, during a high tea for passengers gathered\nin the main lounge, a collision occurred, scarcely noticeable\non the whole, affecting the Scotia's hull in that quarter a little\nastern of its port paddle wheel.\n\nThe Scotia hadn't run afoul of something, it had been fouled,\nand by a cutting or perforating instrument rather than a blunt one.\nThis encounter seemed so minor that nobody on board would have been\ndisturbed by it, had it not been for the shouts of crewmen in the hold,\nwho climbed on deck yelling:\n\n\"We're sinking!  We're sinking!\"\n\nAt first the passengers were quite frightened, but Captain Anderson\nhastened to reassure them.  In fact, there could be no immediate danger.\nDivided into seven compartments by watertight bulkheads, the Scotia\ncould brave any leak with impunity.\n\nCaptain Anderson immediately made his way into the hold.\nHe discovered that the fifth compartment had been invaded by the sea,\nand the speed of this invasion proved that the leak was considerable.\nFortunately this compartment didn't contain the boilers,\nbecause their furnaces would have been abruptly extinguished.\n\nCaptain Anderson called an immediate halt, and one of his sailors\ndived down to assess the damage.  Within moments they had\nlocated a hole two meters in width on the steamer's underside.\nSuch a leak could not be patched, and with its paddle wheels\nhalf swamped, the Scotia had no choice but to continue its voyage.\nBy then it lay 300 miles from Cape Clear, and after three days\nof delay that filled Liverpool with acute anxiety, it entered\nthe company docks.\n\nThe engineers then proceeded to inspect the Scotia, which had\nbeen put in dry dock.  They couldn't believe their eyes.\nTwo and a half meters below its waterline, there gaped\na symmetrical gash in the shape of an isosceles triangle.\nThis breach in the sheet iron was so perfectly formed, no punch\ncould have done a cleaner job of it.  Consequently, it must\nhave been produced by a perforating tool of uncommon toughness--\nplus, after being launched with prodigious power and then piercing\nfour centimeters of sheet iron, this tool had needed to withdraw\nitself by a backward motion truly inexplicable.\n\nThis was the last straw, and it resulted in arousing public passions\nall over again.  Indeed, from this moment on, any maritime casualty\nwithout an established cause was charged to the monster's account.\nThis outrageous animal had to shoulder responsibility for all\nderelict vessels, whose numbers are unfortunately considerable,\nsince out of those 3,000 ships whose losses are recorded annually\nat the marine insurance bureau, the figure for steam or sailing\nships supposedly lost with all hands, in the absence of any news,\namounts to at least 200!\n\nNow then, justly or unjustly, it was the \"monster\" who stood accused\nof their disappearance; and since, thanks to it, travel between\nthe various continents had become more and more dangerous,\nthe public spoke up and demanded straight out that, at all cost,\nthe seas be purged of this fearsome cetacean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\n\nThe Pros and Cons\n\n\n\nDURING THE PERIOD in which these developments were occurring,\nI had returned from a scientific undertaking organized to explore\nthe Nebraska badlands in the United States.  In my capacity as\nAssistant Professor at the Paris Museum of Natural History, I had\nbeen attached to this expedition by the French government.\nAfter spending six months in Nebraska, I arrived in New York laden\nwith valuable collections near the end of March.  My departure\nfor France was set for early May.  In the meantime, then, I was busy\nclassifying my mineralogical, botanical, and zoological treasures\nwhen that incident took place with the Scotia.\n\nI was perfectly abreast of this question, which was the big news\nof the day, and how could I not have been?  I had read and reread every\nAmerican and European newspaper without being any farther along.\nThis mystery puzzled me.  Finding it impossible to form any views,\nI drifted from one extreme to the other.  Something was out there,\nthat much was certain, and any doubting Thomas was invited to place\nhis finger on the Scotia's wound.\n\nWhen I arrived in New York, the question was at the boiling point.\nThe hypothesis of a drifting islet or an elusive reef, put forward\nby people not quite in their right minds, was completely eliminated.\nAnd indeed, unless this reef had an engine in its belly, how could\nit move about with such prodigious speed?\n\nAlso discredited was the idea of a floating hull or some other\nenormous wreckage, and again because of this speed of movement.\n\nSo only two possible solutions to the question were left,\ncreating two very distinct groups of supporters:  on one side,\nthose favoring a monster of colossal strength; on the other,\nthose favoring an \"underwater boat\" of tremendous motor power.\n\nNow then, although the latter hypothesis was completely admissible,\nit couldn't stand up to inquiries conducted in both the New World\nand the Old.  That a private individual had such a mechanism at his\ndisposal was less than probable.  Where and when had he built it,\nand how could he have built it in secret?\n\nOnly some government could own such an engine of destruction,\nand in these disaster-filled times, when men tax their ingenuity to\nbuild increasingly powerful aggressive weapons, it was possible that,\nunknown to the rest of the world, some nation could have been testing\nsuch a fearsome machine.  The Chassepot rifle led to the torpedo,\nand the torpedo has led to this underwater battering ram,\nwhich in turn will lead to the world putting its foot down.\nAt least I hope it will.\n\nBut this hypothesis of a war machine collapsed in the face of formal\ndenials from the various governments.  Since the public interest\nwas at stake and transoceanic travel was suffering, the sincerity\nof these governments could not be doubted.  Besides, how could\nthe assembly of this underwater boat have escaped public notice?\nKeeping a secret under such circumstances would be difficult enough\nfor an individual, and certainly impossible for a nation whose\nevery move is under constant surveillance by rival powers.\n\nSo, after inquiries conducted in England, France, Russia, Prussia,\nSpain, Italy, America, and even Turkey, the hypothesis of an underwater\nMonitor was ultimately rejected.\n\nAnd so the monster surfaced again, despite the endless witticisms\nheaped on it by the popular press, and the human imagination soon\ngot caught up in the most ridiculous ichthyological fantasies.\n\nAfter I arrived in New York, several people did me the honor\nof consulting me on the phenomenon in question.  In France I had\npublished a two-volume work, in quarto, entitled The Mysteries\nof the Great Ocean Depths.  Well received in scholarly circles,\nthis book had established me as a specialist in this pretty obscure field\nof natural history.  My views were in demand.  As long as I could deny\nthe reality of the business, I confined myself to a flat \"no comment.\"\nBut soon, pinned to the wall, I had to explain myself straight out.\nAnd in this vein, \"the honorable Pierre Aronnax, Professor at\nthe Paris Museum,\" was summoned by The New York Herald to formulate\nhis views no matter what.\n\nI complied.  Since I could no longer hold my tongue, I let it wag.\nI discussed the question in its every aspect, both political\nand scientific, and this is an excerpt from the well-padded article\nI published in the issue of April 30.\n\n\"Therefore,\" I wrote, \"after examining these different hypotheses one\nby one, we are forced, every other supposition having been refuted,\nto accept the existence of an extremely powerful marine animal.\n\n\"The deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us.\nNo soundings have been able to reach them.  What goes on in\nthose distant depths?  What creatures inhabit, or could inhabit,\nthose regions twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface\nof the water?  What is the constitution of these animals?\nIt's almost beyond conjecture.\n\n\"However, the solution to this problem submitted to me can take\nthe form of a choice between two alternatives.\n\n\"Either we know every variety of creature populating our planet,\nor we do not.\n\n\"If we do not know every one of them, if nature still keeps\nichthyological secrets from us, nothing is more admissible than to accept\nthe existence of fish or cetaceans of new species or even new genera,\nanimals with a basically 'cast-iron' constitution that inhabit\nstrata beyond the reach of our soundings, and which some development\nor other, an urge or a whim if you prefer, can bring to the upper\nlevel of the ocean for long intervals.\n\n\"If, on the other hand, we do know every living species, we must\nlook for the animal in question among those marine creatures\nalready cataloged, and in this event I would be inclined to accept\nthe existence of a giant narwhale.\n\n\"The common narwhale, or sea unicorn, often reaches a length of\nsixty feet.  Increase its dimensions fivefold or even tenfold, then give\nthis cetacean a strength in proportion to its size while enlarging\nits offensive weapons, and you have the animal we're looking for.\nIt would have the proportions determined by the officers of the Shannon,\nthe instrument needed to perforate the Scotia, and the power\nto pierce a steamer's hull.\n\n\"In essence, the narwhale is armed with a sort of ivory sword,\nor lance, as certain naturalists have expressed it.\nIt's a king-sized tooth as hard as steel.  Some of these teeth have\nbeen found buried in the bodies of baleen whales, which the narwhale\nattacks with invariable success.  Others have been wrenched,\nnot without difficulty, from the undersides of vessels that narwhales\nhave pierced clean through, as a gimlet pierces a wine barrel.\nThe museum at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris owns one of these\ntusks with a length of 2.25 meters and a width at its base\nof forty-eight centimeters!\n\n\"All right then!  Imagine this weapon to be ten times stronger and\nthe animal ten times more powerful, launch it at a speed of twenty\nmiles per hour, multiply its mass times its velocity, and you get\njust the collision we need to cause the specified catastrophe.\n\n\"So, until information becomes more abundant, I plump for a sea\nunicorn of colossal dimensions, no longer armed with a mere lance\nbut with an actual spur, like ironclad frigates or those warships called\n'rams,' whose mass and motor power it would possess simultaneously.\n\n\"This inexplicable phenomenon is thus explained away--unless it's\nsomething else entirely, which, despite everything that has\nbeen sighted, studied, explored and experienced, is still possible!\"\n\nThese last words were cowardly of me; but as far as I could,\nI wanted to protect my professorial dignity and not lay myself open\nto laughter from the Americans, who when they do laugh, laugh raucously.\nI had left myself a loophole.  Yet deep down, I had accepted\nthe existence of \"the monster.\"\n\nMy article was hotly debated, causing a fine old uproar.\nIt rallied a number of supporters.  Moreover, the solution\nit proposed allowed for free play of the imagination.\nThe human mind enjoys impressive visions of unearthly creatures.\nNow then, the sea is precisely their best medium, the only setting\nsuitable for the breeding and growing of such giants--next to which\nsuch land animals as elephants or rhinoceroses are mere dwarves.\nThe liquid masses support the largest known species of mammals and perhaps\nconceal mollusks of incomparable size or crustaceans too frightful\nto contemplate, such as 100-meter lobsters or crabs weighing 200\nmetric tons!  Why not?  Formerly, in prehistoric days, land animals\n(quadrupeds, apes, reptiles, birds) were built on a gigantic scale.\nOur Creator cast them using a colossal mold that time has gradually\nmade smaller.  With its untold depths, couldn't the sea keep alive\nsuch huge specimens of life from another age, this sea that never\nchanges while the land masses undergo almost continuous alteration?\nCouldn't the heart of the ocean hide the last-remaining\nvarieties of these titanic species, for whom years are centuries\nand centuries millennia?\n\nBut I mustn't let these fantasies run away with me!  Enough of these\nfairy tales that time has changed for me into harsh realities.\nI repeat:  opinion had crystallized as to the nature of this phenomenon,\nand the public accepted without argument the existence of a prodigious\ncreature that had nothing in common with the fabled sea serpent.\n\nYet if some saw it purely as a scientific problem to be solved,\nmore practical people, especially in America and England,\nwere determined to purge the ocean of this daunting monster, to insure\nthe safety of transoceanic travel.  The industrial and commercial\nnewspapers dealt with the question chiefly from this viewpoint.\nThe Shipping & Mercantile Gazette, the Lloyd's List, France's Packetboat\nand Maritime & Colonial Review, all the rags devoted to\ninsurance companies--who threatened to raise their premium rates--\nwere unanimous on this point.\n\nPublic opinion being pronounced, the States of the Union were\nthe first in the field.  In New York preparations were under way for\nan expedition designed to chase this narwhale.  A high-speed frigate,\nthe Abraham Lincoln, was fitted out for putting to sea as soon\nas possible.  The naval arsenals were unlocked for Commander Farragut,\nwho pressed energetically forward with the arming of his frigate.\n\nBut, as it always happens, just when a decision had been made to chase\nthe monster, the monster put in no further appearances.  For two months\nnobody heard a word about it.  Not a single ship encountered it.\nApparently the unicorn had gotten wise to these plots being woven\naround it.  People were constantly babbling about the creature,\neven via the Atlantic Cable!  Accordingly, the wags claimed that this\nslippery rascal had waylaid some passing telegram and was making\nthe most of it.\n\nSo the frigate was equipped for a far-off voyage and armed\nwith fearsome fishing gear, but nobody knew where to steer it.\nAnd impatience grew until, on June 2, word came that the Tampico,\na steamer on the San Francisco line sailing from California to Shanghai,\nhad sighted the animal again, three weeks before in the northerly\nseas of the Pacific.\n\nThis news caused intense excitement.  Not even a 24-hour breather was\ngranted to Commander Farragut.  His provisions were loaded on board.\nHis coal bunkers were overflowing.  Not a crewman was missing\nfrom his post.  To cast off, he needed only to fire and stoke\nhis furnaces!  Half a day's delay would have been unforgivable!\nBut Commander Farragut wanted nothing more than to go forth.\n\nI received a letter three hours before the Abraham Lincoln left\nits Brooklyn pier;* the letter read as follows:\n\n*Author's Note:  A pier is a type of wharf expressly set aside\nfor an individual vessel.\n\nPierre Aronnax\n\nProfessor at the Paris Museum\n\nFifth Avenue Hotel\n\nNew York\n\nSir:\n\nIf you would like to join the expedition on the Abraham Lincoln,\nthe government of the Union will be pleased to regard you as France's\nrepresentative in this undertaking.  Commander Farragut has a cabin\nat your disposal.\n\nVery cordially yours,\n\nJ. B. HOBSON,\n\nSecretary of the Navy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\n\nAs Master Wishes\n\n\n\nTHREE SECONDS before the arrival of J. B. Hobson's letter,\nI no more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for\nthe Northwest Passage.  Three seconds after reading this letter\nfrom the honorable Secretary of the Navy, I understood at last that\nmy true vocation, my sole purpose in life, was to hunt down this\ndisturbing monster and rid the world of it.\n\nEven so, I had just returned from an arduous journey, exhausted and badly\nneeding a rest.  I wanted nothing more than to see my country again,\nmy friends, my modest quarters by the Botanical Gardens,\nmy dearly beloved collections!  But now nothing could hold me back.\nI forgot everything else, and without another thought of exhaustion,\nfriends, or collections, I accepted the American government's offer.\n\n\"Besides,\" I mused, \"all roads lead home to Europe, and our unicorn\nmay be gracious enough to take me toward the coast of France!  That fine\nanimal may even let itself be captured in European seas--as a personal\nfavor to me--and I'll bring back to the Museum of Natural History\nat least half a meter of its ivory lance!\"\n\nBut in the meantime I would have to look for this narwhale in\nthe northern Pacific Ocean; which meant returning to France by way\nof the Antipodes.\n\n\"Conseil!\"  I called in an impatient voice.\n\nConseil was my manservant.  A devoted lad who went with me on all\nmy journeys; a gallant Flemish boy whom I genuinely liked and who\nreturned the compliment; a born stoic, punctilious on principle,\nhabitually hardworking, rarely startled by life's surprises,\nvery skillful with his hands, efficient in his every duty, and despite\nhis having a name that means \"counsel,\" never giving advice--\nnot even the unsolicited kind!\n\nFrom rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe\nby the Botanical Gardens, the boy had come to know a thing or two.\nIn Conseil I had a seasoned specialist in biological classification,\nan enthusiast who could run with acrobatic agility up and down\nthe whole ladder of branches, groups, classes, subclasses,\norders, families, genera, subgenera, species, and varieties.\nBut there his science came to a halt.  Classifying was everything\nto him, so he knew nothing else.  Well versed in the theory\nof classification, he was poorly versed in its practical application,\nand I doubt that he could tell a sperm whale from a baleen whale!\nAnd yet, what a fine, gallant lad!\n\nFor the past ten years, Conseil had gone with me wherever\nscience beckoned.  Not once did he comment on the length or the hardships\nof a journey.  Never did he object to buckling up his suitcase for any\ncountry whatever, China or the Congo, no matter how far off it was.\nHe went here, there, and everywhere in perfect contentment.\nMoreover, he enjoyed excellent health that defied all ailments,\nowned solid muscles, but hadn't a nerve in him, not a sign of nerves--\nthe mental type, I mean.\n\nThe lad was thirty years old, and his age to that of his employer\nwas as fifteen is to twenty.  Please forgive me for this underhanded\nway of admitting I had turned forty.\n\nBut Conseil had one flaw.  He was a fanatic on formality,\nand he only addressed me in the third person--to the point where\nit got tiresome.\n\n\"Conseil!\"  I repeated, while feverishly beginning my preparations\nfor departure.\n\nTo be sure, I had confidence in this devoted lad.  Ordinarily, I never\nasked whether or not it suited him to go with me on my journeys;\nbut this time an expedition was at issue that could drag on indefinitely,\na hazardous undertaking whose purpose was to hunt an animal that could\nsink a frigate as easily as a walnut shell!  There was good reason\nto stop and think, even for the world's most emotionless man.\nWhat would Conseil say?\n\n\"Conseil!\"  I called a third time.\n\nConseil appeared.\n\n\"Did master summon me?\" he said, entering.\n\n\"Yes, my boy.  Get my things ready, get yours ready.\nWe're departing in two hours.\"\n\n\"As master wishes,\" Conseil replied serenely.\n\n\"We haven't a moment to lose.  Pack as much into my trunk as you can,\nmy traveling kit, my suits, shirts, and socks, don't bother counting,\njust squeeze it all in--and hurry!\"\n\n\"What about master's collections?\"  Conseil ventured to observe.\n\n\"We'll deal with them later.\"\n\n\"What!  The archaeotherium, hyracotherium, oreodonts, cheiropotamus,\nand master's other fossil skeletons?\"\n\n\"The hotel will keep them for us.\"\n\n\"What about master's live babirusa?\"\n\n\"They'll feed it during our absence.  Anyhow, we'll leave instructions\nto ship the whole menagerie to France.\"\n\n\"Then we aren't returning to Paris?\"  Conseil asked.\n\n\"Yes, we are . . . certainly . . . ,\" I replied evasively,\n\"but after we make a detour.\"\n\n\"Whatever detour master wishes.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing really!  A route slightly less direct, that's all.\nWe're leaving on the Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\"As master thinks best,\" Conseil replied placidly.\n\n\"You see, my friend, it's an issue of the monster,\nthe notorious narwhale.  We're going to rid the seas of it!\nThe author of a two-volume work, in quarto, on The Mysteries\nof the Great Ocean Depths has no excuse for not setting sail\nwith Commander Farragut.  It's a glorious mission but also a\ndangerous one!  We don't know where it will take us!  These beasts\ncan be quite unpredictable!  But we're going just the same!\nWe have a commander who's game for anything!\"\n\n\"What master does, I'll do,\" Conseil replied.\n\n\"But think it over, because I don't want to hide anything from you.\nThis is one of those voyages from which people don't always come back!\"\n\n\"As master wishes.\"\n\nA quarter of an hour later, our trunks were ready.  Conseil did\nthem in a flash, and I was sure the lad hadn't missed a thing,\nbecause he classified shirts and suits as expertly as birds and mammals.\n\nThe hotel elevator dropped us off in the main vestibule on the mezzanine.\nI went down a short stair leading to the ground floor.\nI settled my bill at that huge counter that was always under siege\nby a considerable crowd.  I left instructions for shipping my containers\nof stuffed animals and dried plants to Paris, France.  I opened a line\nof credit sufficient to cover the babirusa and, Conseil at my heels,\nI jumped into a carriage.\n\nFor a fare of twenty francs, the vehicle went down Broadway\nto Union Square, took Fourth Ave. to its junction with Bowery St.,\nturned into Katrin St. and halted at Pier 34.  There the Katrin ferry\ntransferred men, horses, and carriage to Brooklyn, that great New York\nannex located on the left bank of the East River, and in a few\nminutes we arrived at the wharf next to which the Abraham Lincoln\nwas vomiting torrents of black smoke from its two funnels.\n\nOur baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate.\nI rushed aboard.  I asked for Commander Farragut.  One of the sailors led\nme to the afterdeck, where I stood in the presence of a smart-looking\nofficer who extended his hand to me.\n\n\"Professor Pierre Aronnax?\" he said to me.\n\n\"The same,\" I replied.  \"Commander Farragut?\"\n\n\"In person.  Welcome aboard, professor.  Your cabin is waiting for you.\"\n\nI bowed, and letting the commander attend to getting under way,\nI was taken to the cabin that had been set aside for me.\n\nThe Abraham Lincoln had been perfectly chosen and fitted out\nfor its new assignment.  It was a high-speed frigate furnished\nwith superheating equipment that allowed the tension of its steam\nto build to seven atmospheres.  Under this pressure the Abraham Lincoln\nreached an average speed of 18.3 miles per hour, a considerable\nspeed but still not enough to cope with our gigantic cetacean.\n\nThe frigate's interior accommodations complemented its nautical virtues.\nI was well satisfied with my cabin, which was located in the stern\nand opened into the officers' mess.\n\n\"We'll be quite comfortable here,\" I told Conseil.\n\n\"With all due respect to master,\" Conseil replied, \"as comfortable\nas a hermit crab inside the shell of a whelk.\"\n\nI left Conseil to the proper stowing of our luggage and climbed\non deck to watch the preparations for getting under way.\n\nJust then Commander Farragut was giving orders to cast off the last\nmoorings holding the Abraham Lincoln to its Brooklyn pier.\nAnd so if I'd been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less,\nthe frigate would have gone without me, and I would have missed\nout on this unearthly, extraordinary, and inconceivable expedition,\nwhose true story might well meet with some skepticism.\n\nBut Commander Farragut didn't want to waste a single day,\nor even a single hour, in making for those seas where the animal\nhad just been sighted.  He summoned his engineer.\n\n\"Are we up to pressure?\" he asked the man.\n\n\"Aye, sir,\" the engineer replied.\n\n\"Go ahead, then!\"  Commander Farragut called.\n\nAt this order, which was relayed to the engine by means of a\ncompressed-air device, the mechanics activated the start-up wheel.\nSteam rushed whistling into the gaping valves.  Long horizontal\npistons groaned and pushed the tie rods of the drive shaft.\nThe blades of the propeller churned the waves with increasing speed,\nand the Abraham Lincoln moved out majestically amid a spectator-laden\nescort of some 100 ferries and tenders.*\n\n*Author's Note:  Tenders are small steamboats that assist\nthe big liners.\n\nThe wharves of Brooklyn, and every part of New York bordering\nthe East River, were crowded with curiosity seekers.\nDeparting from 500,000 throats, three cheers burst forth in succession.\nThousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses,\nhailing the Abraham\n\nLincoln until it reached the waters of the Hudson River, at the tip\nof the long peninsula that forms New York City.\n\nThe frigate then went along the New Jersey coast--the wonderful\nright bank of this river, all loaded down with country homes--\nand passed by the forts to salutes from their biggest cannons.\nThe Abraham Lincoln replied by three times lowering and hoisting\nthe American flag, whose thirty-nine stars gleamed from the gaff of\nthe mizzen sail; then, changing speed to take the buoy-marked channel\nthat curved into the inner bay formed by the spit of Sandy Hook,\nit hugged this sand-covered strip of land where thousands of spectators\nacclaimed us one more time.\n\nThe escort of boats and tenders still followed the frigate and only\nleft us when we came abreast of the lightship, whose two signal\nlights mark the entrance of the narrows to Upper New York Bay.\n\nThree o'clock then sounded.  The harbor pilot went down into his\ndinghy and rejoined a little schooner waiting for him to leeward.\nThe furnaces were stoked; the propeller churned the waves more swiftly;\nthe frigate skirted the flat, yellow coast of Long Island;\nand at eight o'clock in the evening, after the lights of Fire Island\nhad vanished into the northwest, we ran at full steam onto the dark\nwaters of the Atlantic.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\n\nNed Land\n\n\n\nCOMMANDER FARRAGUT was a good seaman, worthy of the frigate\nhe commanded.  His ship and he were one.  He was its very soul.\nOn the cetacean question no doubts arose in his mind, and he didn't\nallow the animal's existence to be disputed aboard his vessel.\nHe believed in it as certain pious women believe in the leviathan\nfrom the Book of Job--out of faith, not reason.  The monster existed,\nand he had vowed to rid the seas of it.  The man was a sort of\nKnight of Rhodes, a latter-day Sir Dieudonn\u00e9 of Gozo, on his way\nto fight an encounter with the dragon devastating the island.\nEither Commander Farragut would slay the narwhale, or the narwhale\nwould slay Commander Farragut.  No middle of the road for these two.\n\nThe ship's officers shared the views of their leader.  They could\nbe heard chatting, discussing, arguing, calculating the different\nchances of an encounter, and observing the vast expanse of the ocean.\nVoluntary watches from the crosstrees of the topgallant sail\nwere self-imposed by more than one who would have cursed such toil\nunder any other circumstances.  As often as the sun swept over\nits daily arc, the masts were populated with sailors whose feet\nitched and couldn't hold still on the planking of the deck below!\nAnd the Abraham Lincoln's stempost hadn't even cut the suspected\nwaters of the Pacific.\n\nAs for the crew, they only wanted to encounter the unicorn,\nharpoon it, haul it on board, and carve it up.  They surveyed the sea\nwith scrupulous care.  Besides, Commander Farragut had mentioned\nthat a certain sum of $2,000.00 was waiting for the man who first\nsighted the animal, be he cabin boy or sailor, mate or officer.\nI'll let the reader decide whether eyes got proper exercise aboard\nthe Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAs for me, I didn't lag behind the others and I yielded to no\none my share in these daily observations.  Our frigate would\nhave had fivescore good reasons for renaming itself the Argus,\nafter that mythological beast with 100 eyes!  The lone rebel among\nus was Conseil, who seemed utterly uninterested in the question\nexciting us and was out of step with the general enthusiasm on board.\n\nAs I said, Commander Farragut had carefully equipped his ship\nwith all the gear needed to fish for a gigantic cetacean.\nNo whaling vessel could have been better armed.  We had every\nknown mechanism, from the hand-hurled harpoon, to the blunderbuss\nfiring barbed arrows, to the duck gun with exploding bullets.\nOn the forecastle was mounted the latest model breech-loading cannon,\nvery heavy of barrel and narrow of bore, a weapon that would figure\nin the Universal Exhibition of 1867.  Made in America, this valuable\ninstrument could fire a four-kilogram conical projectile an average\ndistance of sixteen kilometers without the least bother.\n\nSo the Abraham Lincoln wasn't lacking in means of destruction.\nBut it had better still.  It had Ned Land, the King of Harpooners.\n\nGifted with uncommon manual ability, Ned Land was a Canadian who had\nno equal in his dangerous trade.  Dexterity, coolness, bravery,\nand cunning were virtues he possessed to a high degree, and it took\na truly crafty baleen whale or an exceptionally astute sperm whale\nto elude the thrusts of his harpoon.\n\nNed Land was about forty years old.  A man of great height--over six\nEnglish feet--he was powerfully built, serious in manner, not very\nsociable, sometimes headstrong, and quite ill-tempered when crossed.\nHis looks caught the attention, and above all the strength of his gaze,\nwhich gave a unique emphasis to his facial appearance.\n\nCommander Farragut, to my thinking, had made a wise move in hiring\non this man.  With his eye and his throwing arm, he was worth\nthe whole crew all by himself.  I can do no better than to compare\nhim with a powerful telescope that could double as a cannon always\nready to fire.\n\nTo say Canadian is to say French, and as unsociable as\nNed Land was, I must admit he took a definite liking to me.\nNo doubt it was my nationality that attracted him.\nIt was an opportunity for him to speak, and for me to hear,\nthat old Rabelaisian dialect still used in some Canadian provinces.\nThe harpooner's family originated in Quebec, and they were already\na line of bold fishermen back in the days when this town still\nbelonged to France.\n\nLittle by little Ned developed a taste for chatting, and I loved\nhearing the tales of his adventures in the polar seas.  He described\nhis fishing trips and his battles with great natural lyricism.\nHis tales took on the form of an epic poem, and I felt I was hearing\nsome Canadian Homer reciting his Iliad of the High Arctic regions.\n\nI'm writing of this bold companion as I currently know him.\nBecause we've become old friends, united in that permanent\ncomradeship born and cemented during only the most frightful crises!\nAh, my gallant Ned!  I ask only to live 100 years more, the longer\nto remember you!\n\nAnd now, what were Ned Land's views on this question of a marine monster?\nI must admit that he flatly didn't believe in the unicorn,\nand alone on board, he didn't share the general conviction.\nHe avoided even dealing with the subject, for which one day I felt\ncompelled to take him to task.\n\nDuring the magnificent evening of June 25--in other words, three weeks\nafter our departure--the frigate lay abreast of Cabo Blanco,\nthirty miles to leeward of the coast of Patagonia.  We had crossed\nthe Tropic of Capricorn, and the Strait of Magellan opened\nless than 700 miles to the south.  Before eight days were out,\nthe Abraham Lincoln would plow the waves of the Pacific.\n\nSeated on the afterdeck, Ned Land and I chatted about one thing\nand another, staring at that mysterious sea whose depths to this\nday are beyond the reach of human eyes.  Quite naturally,\nI led our conversation around to the giant unicorn, and I weighed\nour expedition's various chances for success or failure.\nThen, seeing that Ned just let me talk without saying much himself,\nI pressed him more closely.\n\n\"Ned,\" I asked him, \"how can you still doubt the reality of this\ncetacean we're after?  Do you have any particular reasons for\nbeing so skeptical?\"\n\nThe harpooner stared at me awhile before replying, slapped his\nbroad forehead in one of his standard gestures, closed his eyes\nas if to collect himself, and finally said:\n\n\"Just maybe, Professor Aronnax.\"\n\n\"But Ned, you're a professional whaler, a man familiar with all\nthe great marine mammals--your mind should easily accept this\nhypothesis of an enormous cetacean, and you ought to be the last\none to doubt it under these circumstances!\"\n\n\"That's just where you're mistaken, professor,\" Ned replied.\n\"The common man may still believe in fabulous comets crossing\nouter space, or in prehistoric monsters living at the earth's core,\nbut astronomers and geologists don't swallow such fairy tales.\nIt's the same with whalers.  I've chased plenty of cetaceans,\nI've harpooned a good number, I've killed several.  But no matter\nhow powerful and well armed they were, neither their tails or their\ntusks could puncture the sheet-iron plates of a steamer.\"\n\n\"Even so, Ned, people mention vessels that narwhale tusks have\nrun clean through.\"\n\n\"Wooden ships maybe,\" the Canadian replied.  \"But I've never seen\nthe like.  So till I have proof to the contrary, I'll deny that\nbaleen whales, sperm whales, or unicorns can do any such thing.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Ned--\"\n\n\"No, no, professor.  I'll go along with anything you want except that.\nSome gigantic devilfish maybe . . . ?\"\n\n\"Even less likely, Ned.  The devilfish is merely a mollusk, and even this\nname hints at its semiliquid flesh, because it's Latin meaning soft one.\nThe devilfish doesn't belong to the vertebrate branch, and even if it\nwere 500 feet long, it would still be utterly harmless to ships\nlike the Scotia or the Abraham Lincoln.  Consequently, the feats\nof krakens or other monsters of that ilk must be relegated to\nthe realm of fiction.\"\n\n\"So, Mr. Naturalist,\" Ned Land continued in a bantering tone,\n\"you'll just keep on believing in the existence of some\nenormous cetacean . . . ?\"\n\n\"Yes, Ned, I repeat it with a conviction backed by factual logic.\nI believe in the existence of a mammal with a powerful constitution,\nbelonging to the vertebrate branch like baleen whales, sperm whales,\nor dolphins, and armed with a tusk made of horn that has\ntremendous penetrating power.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" the harpooner put in, shaking his head with the attitude\nof a man who doesn't want to be convinced.\n\n\"Note well, my fine Canadian,\" I went on, \"if such an animal exists,\nif it lives deep in the ocean, if it frequents the liquid strata\nlocated miles beneath the surface of the water, it needs to have\na constitution so solid, it defies all comparison.\"\n\n\"And why this powerful constitution?\"  Ned asked.\n\n\"Because it takes incalculable strength just to live in those deep\nstrata and withstand their pressure.\"\n\n\"Oh really?\"  Ned said, tipping me a wink.\n\n\"Oh really, and I can prove it to you with a few simple figures.\"\n\n\"Bosh!\"  Ned replied.  \"You can make figures do anything you want!\"\n\n\"In business, Ned, but not in mathematics.  Listen to me.\nLet's accept that the pressure of one atmosphere is represented\nby the pressure of a column of water thirty-two feet high.\nIn reality, such a column of water wouldn't be quite so high because\nhere we're dealing with salt water, which is denser than fresh water.\nWell then, when you dive under the waves, Ned, for every thirty-two\nfeet of water above you, your body is tolerating the pressure\nof one more atmosphere, in other words, one more kilogram per\neach square centimeter on your body's surface.  So it follows\nthat at 320 feet down, this pressure is equal to ten atmospheres,\nto 100 atmospheres at 3,200 feet, and to 1,000 atmospheres at\n32,000 feet, that is, at about two and a half vertical leagues down.\nWhich is tantamount to saying that if you could reach such a depth\nin the ocean, each square centimeter on your body's surface would\nbe experiencing 1,000 kilograms of pressure.  Now, my gallant Ned,\ndo you know how many square centimeters you have on your bodily surface?\"\n\n\"I haven't the foggiest notion, Professor Aronnax.\"\n\n\"About 17,000.\"\n\n\"As many as that?\"\n\n\"Yes, and since the atmosphere's pressure actually weighs slightly\nmore than one kilogram per square centimeter, your 17,000 square\ncentimeters are tolerating 17,568 kilograms at this very moment.\"\n\n\"Without my noticing it?\"\n\n\"Without your noticing it.  And if you aren't crushed by so much pressure,\nit's because the air penetrates the interior of your body with\nequal pressure.  When the inside and outside pressures are in\nperfect balance, they neutralize each other and allow you to tolerate\nthem without discomfort.  But in the water it's another story.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see,\" Ned replied, growing more interested.\n\"Because the water surrounds me but doesn't penetrate me.\"\n\n\"Precisely, Ned.  So at thirty-two feet beneath the surface of the sea,\nyou'll undergo a pressure of 17,568 kilograms; at 320 feet, or ten times\ngreater pressure, it's 175,680 kilograms; at 3,200 feet, or 100 times\ngreater pressure, it's 1,756,800 kilograms; finally, at 32,000 feet,\nor 1,000 times greater pressure, it's 17,568,000 kilograms;\nin other words, you'd be squashed as flat as if you'd just been\nyanked from between the plates of a hydraulic press!\"\n\n\"Fire and brimstone!\"  Ned put in.\n\n\"All right then, my fine harpooner, if vertebrates several hundred\nmeters long and proportionate in bulk live at such depths,\ntheir surface areas make up millions of square centimeters,\nand the pressure they undergo must be assessed in billions of kilograms.\nCalculate, then, how much resistance of bone structure and strength\nof constitution they'd need in order to withstand such pressures!\"\n\n\"They'd need to be manufactured,\" Ned Land replied, \"from sheet-iron\nplates eight inches thick, like ironclad frigates.\"\n\n\"Right, Ned, and then picture the damage such a mass could inflict\nif it were launched with the speed of an express train against\na ship's hull.\"\n\n\"Yes . . . indeed . . . maybe,\" the Canadian replied, staggered by\nthese figures but still not willing to give in.\n\n\"Well, have I convinced you?\"\n\n\"You've convinced me of one thing, Mr. Naturalist.  That deep\nin the sea, such animals would need to be just as strong as you say--\nif they exist.\"\n\n\"But if they don't exist, my stubborn harpooner, how do you explain\nthe accident that happened to the Scotia?\"\n\n\"It's maybe . . . ,\" Ned said, hesitating.\n\n\"Go on!\"\n\n\"Because . . . it just couldn't be true!\" the Canadian replied,\nunconsciously echoing a famous catchphrase of the scientist Arago.\n\nBut this reply proved nothing, other than how bullheaded the harpooner\ncould be.  That day I pressed him no further.  The Scotia's accident\nwas undeniable.  Its hole was real enough that it had to be plugged up,\nand I don't think a hole's existence can be more emphatically proven.\nNow then, this hole didn't make itself, and since it hadn't resulted\nfrom underwater rocks or underwater machines, it must have been\ncaused by the perforating tool of some animal.\n\nNow, for all the reasons put forward to this point, I believed that\nthis animal was a member of the branch Vertebrata, class Mammalia,\ngroup Pisciforma, and finally, order Cetacea.  As for the family\nin which it would be placed (baleen whale, sperm whale, or dolphin),\nthe genus to which it belonged, and the species in which it would\nfind its proper home, these questions had to be left for later.\nTo answer them called for dissecting this unknown monster; to dissect\nit called for catching it; to catch it called for harpooning it--\nwhich was Ned Land's business; to harpoon it called for sighting it--\nwhich was the crew's business; and to sight it called for encountering it--\nwhich was a chancy business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\n\nAt Random!\n\n\n\nFOR SOME WHILE the voyage of the Abraham Lincoln was marked by\nno incident.  But one circumstance arose that displayed Ned Land's\nmarvelous skills and showed just how much confidence we could\nplace in him.\n\nOff the Falkland Islands on June 30, the frigate came in contact\nwith a fleet of American whalers, and we learned that they hadn't\nseen the narwhale.  But one of them, the captain of the Monroe,\nknew that Ned Land had shipped aboard the Abraham Lincoln\nand asked his help in hunting a baleen whale that was in sight.\nAnxious to see Ned Land at work, Commander Farragut authorized him\nto make his way aboard the Monroe.  And the Canadian had such good luck\nthat with a right-and-left shot, he harpooned not one whale but two,\nstriking the first straight to the heart and catching the other\nafter a few minutes' chase!\n\nAssuredly, if the monster ever had to deal with Ned Land's harpoon,\nI wouldn't bet on the monster.\n\nThe frigate sailed along the east coast of South America with\nprodigious speed.  By July 3 we were at the entrance to the Strait\nof Magellan, abreast of Cabo de las Virgenes.  But Commander Farragut\nwas unwilling to attempt this tortuous passageway and maneuvered\ninstead to double Cape Horn.\n\nThe crew sided with him unanimously.  Indeed, were we\nlikely to encounter the narwhale in such a cramped strait?\nMany of our sailors swore that the monster couldn't negotiate this\npassageway simply because \"he's too big for it!\"\n\nNear three o'clock in the afternoon on July 6, fifteen miles south\nof shore, the Abraham Lincoln doubled that solitary islet at the tip\nof the South American continent, that stray rock Dutch seamen had\nnamed Cape Horn after their hometown of Hoorn.  Our course was set\nfor the northwest, and the next day our frigate's propeller finally\nchurned the waters of the Pacific.\n\n\"Open your eyes!  Open your eyes!\" repeated the sailors of\nthe Abraham Lincoln.\n\nAnd they opened amazingly wide.  Eyes and spyglasses (a bit dazzled,\nit is true, by the vista of $2,000.00) didn't remain at rest for\nan instant.  Day and night we observed the surface of the ocean,\nand those with nyctalopic eyes, whose ability to see in the dark\nincreased their chances by fifty percent, had an excellent shot\nat winning the prize.\n\nAs for me, I was hardly drawn by the lure of money and yet was far from\nthe least attentive on board.  Snatching only a few minutes for meals\nand a few hours for sleep, come rain or come shine, I no longer left\nthe ship's deck.  Sometimes bending over the forecastle railings,\nsometimes leaning against the sternrail, I eagerly scoured that\ncotton-colored wake that whitened the ocean as far as the eye could see!\nAnd how many times I shared the excitement of general staff and crew\nwhen some unpredictable whale lifted its blackish back above the waves.\nIn an instant the frigate's deck would become densely populated.\nThe cowls over the companionways would vomit a torrent of sailors\nand officers.  With panting chests and anxious eyes, we each would\nobserve the cetacean's movements.  I stared; I stared until I nearly\nwent blind from a worn-out retina, while Conseil, as stoic as ever,\nkept repeating to me in a calm tone:\n\n\"If master's eyes would kindly stop bulging, master will see farther!\"\n\nBut what a waste of energy!  The Abraham Lincoln would change\ncourse and race after the animal sighted, only to find an ordinary\nbaleen whale or a common sperm whale that soon disappeared amid\na chorus of curses!\n\nHowever, the weather held good.  Our voyage was proceeding under\nthe most favorable conditions.  By then it was the bad season\nin these southernmost regions, because July in this zone corresponds\nto our January in Europe; but the sea remained smooth and easily\nvisible over a vast perimeter.\n\nNed Land still kept up the most tenacious skepticism; beyond his\nspells on watch, he pretended that he never even looked at\nthe surface of the waves, at least while no whales were in sight.\nAnd yet the marvelous power of his vision could have performed\nyeoman service.  But this stubborn Canadian spent eight\nhours out of every twelve reading or sleeping in his cabin.\nA hundred times I chided him for his unconcern.\n\n\"Bah!\" he replied.  \"Nothing's out there, Professor Aronnax,\nand if there is some animal, what chance would we have of spotting it?\nCan't you see we're just wandering around at random?  People say\nthey've sighted this slippery beast again in the Pacific high seas--\nI'm truly willing to believe it, but two months have already gone\nby since then, and judging by your narwhale's personality, it hates\ngrowing moldy from hanging out too long in the same waterways!\nIt's blessed with a terrific gift for getting around.\nNow, professor, you know even better than I that nature doesn't\nviolate good sense, and she wouldn't give some naturally slow animal\nthe ability to move swiftly if it hadn't a need to use that talent.\nSo if the beast does exist, it's already long gone!\"\n\nI had no reply to this.  Obviously we were just groping blindly.\nBut how else could we go about it?  All the same, our chances were\nautomatically pretty limited.  Yet everyone still felt confident\nof success, and not a sailor on board would have bet against\nthe narwhale appearing, and soon.\n\nOn July 20 we cut the Tropic of Capricorn at longitude 105\ndegrees, and by the 27th of the same month, we had cleared\nthe equator on the 110th meridian.  These bearings determined,\nthe frigate took a more decisive westward heading and tackled\nthe seas of the central Pacific.  Commander Farragut felt,\nand with good reason, that it was best to stay in deep waters and\nkeep his distance from continents or islands, whose neighborhoods\nthe animal always seemed to avoid--\"No doubt,\" our bosun said,\n\"because there isn't enough water for him!\"  So the frigate kept\nwell out when passing the Tuamotu, Marquesas, and Hawaiian Islands,\nthen cut the Tropic of Cancer at longitude 132 degrees and headed\nfor the seas of China.\n\nWe were finally in the area of the monster's latest antics!\nAnd in all honesty, shipboard conditions became life-threatening.\nHearts were pounding hideously, gearing up for futures full\nof incurable aneurysms.  The entire crew suffered from a nervous\nexcitement that it's beyond me to describe.  Nobody ate, nobody slept.\nTwenty times a day some error in perception, or the optical\nillusions of some sailor perched in the crosstrees, would cause\nintolerable anguish, and this emotion, repeated twenty times over,\nkept us in a state of irritability so intense that a reaction was\nbound to follow.\n\nAnd this reaction wasn't long in coming.  For three months,\nduring which each day seemed like a century, the Abraham Lincoln plowed\nall the northerly seas of the Pacific, racing after whales sighted,\nabruptly veering off course, swerving sharply from one tack to another,\nstopping suddenly, putting on steam and reversing engines in quick\nsuccession, at the risk of stripping its gears, and it didn't leave\na single point unexplored from the beaches of Japan to the coasts\nof America.  And we found nothing!  Nothing except an immenseness\nof deserted waves!  Nothing remotely resembling a gigantic narwhale,\nor an underwater islet, or a derelict shipwreck, or a runaway reef,\nor anything the least bit unearthly!\n\nSo the reaction set in.  At first, discouragement took hold of\npeople's minds, opening the door to disbelief.  A new feeling appeared\non board, made up of three-tenths shame and seven-tenths fury.\nThe crew called themselves \"out-and-out fools\" for being\nhoodwinked by a fairy tale, then grew steadily more furious!\nThe mountains of arguments amassed over a year collapsed all at once,\nand each man now wanted only to catch up on his eating and sleeping,\nto make up for the time he had so stupidly sacrificed.\n\nWith typical human fickleness, they jumped from one extreme\nto the other.  Inevitably, the most enthusiastic supporters\nof the undertaking became its most energetic opponents.\nThis reaction mounted upward from the bowels of the ship, from the\nquarters of the bunker hands to the messroom of the general staff;\nand for certain, if it hadn't been for Commander Farragut's\ncharacteristic stubbornness, the frigate would ultimately have put\nback to that cape in the south.\n\nBut this futile search couldn't drag on much longer.\nThe Abraham Lincoln had done everything it could to succeed and\nhad no reason to blame itself.  Never had the crew of an American\nnaval craft shown more patience and zeal; they weren't responsible\nfor this failure; there was nothing to do but go home.\n\nA request to this effect was presented to the commander.\nThe commander stood his ground.  His sailors couldn't hide\ntheir discontent, and their work suffered because of it.\nI'm unwilling to say that there was mutiny on board, but after\na reasonable period of intransigence, Commander Farragut,\nlike Christopher Columbus before him, asked for a grace period\nof just three days more.  After this three-day delay, if the monster\nhadn't appeared, our helmsman would give three turns of the wheel,\nand the Abraham Lincoln would chart a course toward European seas.\n\nThis promise was given on November 2.  It had the immediate effect\nof reviving the crew's failing spirits.  The ocean was observed\nwith renewed care.  Each man wanted one last look with which to sum\nup his experience.  Spyglasses functioned with feverish energy.\nA supreme challenge had been issued to the giant narwhale, and the latter\nhad no acceptable excuse for ignoring this Summons to Appear!\n\nTwo days passed.  The Abraham Lincoln stayed at half steam.\nOn the offchance that the animal might be found in these waterways,\na thousand methods were used to spark its interest or rouse it\nfrom its apathy.  Enormous sides of bacon were trailed in our wake,\nto the great satisfaction, I must say, of assorted sharks.\nWhile the Abraham Lincoln heaved to, its longboats radiated\nin every direction around it and didn't leave a single point\nof the sea unexplored.  But the evening of November 4 arrived\nwith this underwater mystery still unsolved.\n\nAt noon the next day, November 5, the agreed-upon delay expired.\nAfter a position fix, true to his promise, Commander Farragut would\nhave to set his course for the southeast and leave the northerly\nregions of the Pacific decisively behind.\n\nBy then the frigate lay in latitude 31 degrees 15' north and longitude\n136 degrees 42' east.  The shores of Japan were less than 200 miles\nto our leeward.  Night was coming on.  Eight o'clock had just struck.\nHuge clouds covered the moon's disk, then in its first quarter.\nThe sea undulated placidly beneath the frigate's stempost.\n\nJust then I was in the bow, leaning over the starboard rail.\nConseil, stationed beside me, stared straight ahead.\nRoosting in the shrouds, the crew examined the horizon, which shrank\nand darkened little by little.  Officers were probing the increasing\ngloom with their night glasses.  Sometimes the murky ocean sparkled\nbeneath moonbeams that darted between the fringes of two clouds.\nThen all traces of light vanished into the darkness.\n\nObserving Conseil, I discovered that, just barely, the gallant lad\nhad fallen under the general influence.  At least so I thought.\nPerhaps his nerves were twitching with curiosity for the first\ntime in history.\n\n\"Come on, Conseil!\"  I told him.  \"Here's your last chance to\npocket that $2,000.00!\"\n\n\"If master will permit my saying so,\" Conseil replied, \"I never\nexpected to win that prize, and the Union government could have\npromised $100,000.00 and been none the poorer.\"\n\n\"You're right, Conseil, it turned out to be a foolish business\nafter all, and we jumped into it too hastily.  What a waste of time,\nwhat a futile expense of emotion!  Six months ago we could have been\nback in France--\"\n\n\"In master's little apartment,\" Conseil answered.  \"In master's museum!\nAnd by now I would have classified master's fossils.\nAnd master's babirusa would be ensconced in its cage at the zoo\nin the Botanical Gardens, and it would have attracted every curiosity\nseeker in town!\"\n\n\"Quite so, Conseil, and what's more, I imagine that people will soon\nbe poking fun at us!\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" Conseil replied serenely, \"I do think they'll have fun\nat master's expense.  And must it be said . . . ?\"\n\n\"It must be said, Conseil.\"\n\n\"Well then, it will serve master right!\"\n\n\"How true!\"\n\n\"When one has the honor of being an expert as master is, one mustn't\nlay himself open to--\"\n\nConseil didn't have time to complete the compliment.\nIn the midst of the general silence, a voice became audible.\nIt was Ned Land's voice, and it shouted:\n\n\"Ahoy!  There's the thing in question, abreast of us to leeward!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\n\nAt Full Steam\n\n\n\nAT THIS SHOUT the entire crew rushed toward the harpooner--\ncommander, officers, mates,\n\nsailors, cabin boys, down to engineers leaving their machinery\nand stokers neglecting their furnaces.  The order was given to stop,\nand the frigate merely coasted.\n\nBy then the darkness was profound, and as good as the Canadian's\neyes were, I still wondered how he could see--and what he had seen.\nMy heart was pounding fit to burst.\n\nBut Ned Land was not mistaken, and we all spotted the object his\nhand was indicating.\n\nTwo cable lengths off the Abraham Lincoln's starboard quarter,\nthe sea seemed to be lit up from underneath.  This was no\nmere phosphorescent phenomenon, that much was unmistakable.\nSubmerged some fathoms below the surface of the water, the monster\ngave off that very intense but inexplicable glow that several\ncaptains had mentioned in their reports.  This magnificent radiance\nhad to come from some force with a great illuminating capacity.\nThe edge of its light swept over the sea in an immense,\nhighly elongated oval, condensing at the center into a blazing core\nwhose unbearable glow diminished by degrees outward.\n\n\"It's only a cluster of phosphorescent particles!\" exclaimed one\nof the officers.\n\n\"No, sir,\" I answered with conviction.  \"Not even angel-wing\nclams or salps have ever given off such a powerful light.\nThat glow is basically electric in nature.  Besides . . . look, look!\nIt's shifting!  It's moving back and forth!  It's darting at us!\"\n\nA universal shout went up from the frigate.\n\n\"Quiet!\"  Commander Farragut said.  \"Helm hard to leeward!\nReverse engines!\"\n\nSailors rushed to the helm, engineers to their machinery.\nUnder reverse steam immediately, the Abraham Lincoln beat to port,\nsweeping in a semicircle.\n\n\"Right your helm!  Engines forward!\"  Commander Farragut called.\n\nThese orders were executed, and the frigate swiftly retreated\nfrom this core of light.\n\nMy mistake.  It wanted to retreat, but the unearthly animal came\nat us with a speed double our own.\n\nWe gasped.  More stunned than afraid, we stood mute and motionless.\nThe animal caught up with us, played with us.  It made a full\ncircle around the frigate--then doing fourteen knots--and wrapped\nus in sheets of electricity that were like luminous dust.\nThen it retreated two or three miles, leaving a phosphorescent\ntrail comparable to those swirls of steam that shoot behind\nthe locomotive of an express train.  Suddenly, all the way from\nthe dark horizon where it had gone to gather momentum, the monster\nabruptly dashed toward the Abraham Lincoln with frightening speed,\nstopped sharply twenty feet from our side plates, and died out--\nnot by diving under the water, since its glow did not recede gradually--\nbut all at once, as if the source of this brilliant emanation had\nsuddenly dried up.  Then it reappeared on the other side of the ship,\neither by circling around us or by gliding under our hull.\nAt any instant a collision could have occurred that would have been\nfatal to us.\n\nMeanwhile I was astonished at the frigate's maneuvers.  It was fleeing,\nnot fighting.  Built to pursue, it was being pursued, and I commented\non this to Commander Farragut.  His face, ordinarily so emotionless,\nwas stamped with indescribable astonishment.\n\n\"Professor Aronnax,\" he answered me, \"I don't know what kind of\nfearsome creature I'm up against, and I don't want my frigate running\nfoolish risks in all this darkness.  Besides, how should we attack\nthis unknown creature, how should we defend ourselves against it?\nLet's wait for daylight, and then we'll play a different role.\"\n\n\"You've no further doubts, commander, as to the nature of this animal?\"\n\n\"No, sir, it's apparently a gigantic narwhale, and an electric\none to boot.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" I added, \"it's no more approachable than an electric eel\nor an electric ray!\"\n\n\"Right,\" the commander replied.  \"And if it has their power\nto electrocute, it's surely the most dreadful animal ever conceived\nby our Creator.  That's why I'll keep on my guard, sir.\"\n\nThe whole crew stayed on their feet all night long.  No one even\nthought of sleeping.  Unable to compete with the monster's speed,\nthe Abraham Lincoln slowed down and stayed at half steam.\nFor its part, the narwhale mimicked the frigate, simply rode with\nthe waves, and seemed determined not to forsake the field of battle.\n\nHowever, near midnight it disappeared, or to use a more appropriate\nexpression, \"it went out,\" like a huge glowworm.  Had it fled from us?\nWe were duty bound to fear so rather than hope so.  But at 12:53\nin the morning, a deafening hiss became audible, resembling the sound\nmade by a waterspout expelled with tremendous intensity.\n\nBy then Commander Farragut, Ned Land, and I were on the afterdeck,\npeering eagerly into the profound gloom.\n\n\"Ned Land,\" the commander asked, \"you've often heard whales bellowing?\"\n\n\"Often, sir, but never a whale like this, whose sighting\nearned me $2,000.00.\"\n\n\"Correct, the prize is rightfully yours.  But tell me, isn't that\nthe noise cetaceans make when they spurt water from their blowholes?\"\n\n\"The very noise, sir, but this one's way louder.  So there can\nbe no mistake.  There's definitely a whale lurking in our waters.\nWith your permission, sir,\" the harpooner added, \"tomorrow at daybreak\nwe'll have words with it.\"\n\n\"If it's in a mood to listen to you, Mr. Land,\" I replied in a tone\nfar from convinced.\n\n\"Let me get within four harpoon lengths of it,\" the Canadian shot back,\n\"and it had better listen!\"\n\n\"But to get near it,\" the commander went on, \"I'd have to put\na whaleboat at your disposal?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir.\"\n\n\"That would be gambling with the lives of my men.\"\n\n\"And with my own!\" the harpooner replied simply.\n\nNear two o'clock in the morning, the core of light reappeared,\nno less intense, five miles to windward of the Abraham Lincoln.\nDespite the distance, despite the noise of wind and sea, we could\ndistinctly hear the fearsome thrashings of the animal's tail,\nand even its panting breath.  Seemingly, the moment this enormous\nnarwhale came up to breathe at the surface of the ocean,\nair was sucked into its lungs like steam into the huge cylinders\nof a 2,000-horsepower engine.\n\n\"Hmm!\"  I said to myself.  \"A cetacean as powerful as a whole\ncavalry regiment--now that's a whale of a whale!\"\n\nWe stayed on the alert until daylight, getting ready for action.\nWhaling gear was set up along the railings.  Our chief officer loaded\nthe blunderbusses, which can launch harpoons as far as a mile,\nand long duck guns with exploding bullets that can mortally wound\neven the most powerful animals.  Ned Land was content to sharpen\nhis harpoon, a dreadful weapon in his hands.\n\nAt six o'clock day began to break, and with the dawn's early light,\nthe narwhale's electric glow disappeared.  At seven o'clock the day\nwas well along, but a very dense morning mist shrank the horizon,\nand our best spyglasses were unable to pierce it.  The outcome:\ndisappointment and anger.\n\nI hoisted myself up to the crosstrees of the mizzen sail.\nSome officers were already perched on the mastheads.\n\nAt eight o'clock the mist rolled ponderously over the waves,\nand its huge curls were lifting little by little.  The horizon grew\nwider and clearer all at once.\n\nSuddenly, just as on the previous evening, Ned Land's voice was audible.\n\n\"There's the thing in question, astern to port!\" the harpooner shouted.\n\nEvery eye looked toward the point indicated.\n\nThere, a mile and a half from the frigate, a long blackish body\nemerged a meter above the waves.  Quivering violently, its tail was\ncreating a considerable eddy.  Never had caudal equipment thrashed\nthe sea with such power.  An immense wake of glowing whiteness\nmarked the animal's track, sweeping in a long curve.\n\nOur frigate drew nearer to the cetacean.  I examined it with a completely\nopen mind.  Those reports from the Shannon and the Helvetia had slightly\nexaggerated its dimensions, and I put its length at only 250 feet.\nIts girth was more difficult to judge, but all in all, the animal\nseemed to be wonderfully proportioned in all three dimensions.\n\nWhile I was observing this phenomenal creature, two jets of steam\nand water sprang from its blowholes and rose to an altitude\nof forty meters, which settled for me its mode of breathing.\nFrom this I finally concluded that it belonged to the branch Vertebrata,\nclass Mammalia, subclass Monodelphia, group Pisciforma,\norder Cetacea, family . . . but here I couldn't make up my mind.\nThe order Cetacea consists of three families, baleen whales,\nsperm whales, dolphins, and it's in this last group that narwhales\nare placed.  Each of these families is divided into several genera,\neach genus into species, each species into varieties.\nSo I was still missing variety, species, genus, and family,\nbut no doubt I would complete my classifying with the aid of Heaven\nand Commander Farragut.\n\nThe crew were waiting impatiently for orders from their leader.\nThe latter, after carefully observing the animal, called for\nhis engineer.  The engineer raced over.\n\n\"Sir,\" the commander said, \"are you up to pressure?\"\n\n\"Aye, sir,\" the engineer replied.\n\n\"Fine.  Stoke your furnaces and clap on full steam!\"\n\nThree cheers greeted this order.  The hour of battle had sounded.\nA few moments later, the frigate's two funnels vomited torrents\nof black smoke, and its deck quaked from the trembling of its boilers.\n\nDriven forward by its powerful propeller, the Abraham Lincoln headed\nstraight for the animal.  Unconcerned, the latter let us come\nwithin half a cable length; then, not bothering to dive, it got up\na little speed, retreated, and was content to keep its distance.\n\nThis chase dragged on for about three-quarters of an hour without\nthe frigate gaining two fathoms on the cetacean.  At this rate,\nit was obvious that we would never catch up with it.\n\nInfuriated, Commander Farragut kept twisting the thick tuft of hair\nthat flourished below his chin.\n\n\"Ned Land!\" he called.\n\nThe Canadian reported at once.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Land,\" the commander asked, \"do you still advise putting\nmy longboats to sea?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" Ned Land replied, \"because that beast won't be caught\nagainst its will.\"\n\n\"Then what should we do?\"\n\n\"Stoke up more steam, sir, if you can.  As for me, with your\npermission I'll go perch on the bobstays under the bowsprit,\nand if we can get within a harpoon length, I'll harpoon the brute.\"\n\n\"Go to it, Ned,\" Commander Farragut replied.  \"Engineer,\" he called,\n\"keep the pressure mounting!\"\n\nNed Land made his way to his post.  The furnaces were urged\ninto greater activity; our propeller did forty-three revolutions\nper minute, and steam shot from the valves.  Heaving the log,\nwe verified that the Abraham Lincoln was going at the rate of 18.5\nmiles per hour.\n\nBut that damned animal also did a speed of 18.5.\n\nFor the next hour our frigate kept up this pace without gaining a fathom!\nThis was humiliating for one of the fastest racers in the American navy.\nThe crew were working up into a blind rage.  Sailor after sailor heaved\ninsults at the monster, which couldn't be bothered with answering back.\nCommander Farragut was no longer content simply to twist his goatee;\nhe chewed on it.\n\nThe engineer was summoned once again.\n\n\"You're up to maximum pressure?\" the commander asked him.\n\n\"Aye, sir,\" the engineer replied.\n\n\"And your valves are charged to . . . ?\"\n\n\"To six and a half atmospheres.\"\n\n\"Charge them to ten atmospheres.\"\n\nA typical American order if I ever heard one.  It would have\nsounded just fine during some Mississippi paddle-wheeler race,\nto \"outstrip the competition!\"\n\n\"Conseil,\" I said to my gallant servant, now at my side, \"you realize\nthat we'll probably blow ourselves skyhigh?\"\n\n\"As master wishes!\"  Conseil replied.\n\nAll right, I admit it:  I did wish to run this risk!\n\nThe valves were charged.  More coal was swallowed by the furnaces.\nVentilators shot torrents of air over the braziers.\nThe Abraham Lincoln's speed increased.  Its masts trembled down\nto their blocks, and swirls of smoke could barely squeeze through\nthe narrow funnels.\n\nWe heaved the log a second time.\n\n\"Well, helmsman?\"  Commander Farragut asked.\n\n\"19.3 miles per hour, sir.\"\n\n\"Keep stoking the furnaces.\"\n\nThe engineer did so.  The pressure gauge marked ten atmospheres.\nBut no doubt the cetacean itself had \"warmed up,\" because without\nthe least trouble, it also did 19.3.\n\nWhat a chase!  No, I can't describe the excitement that shook\nmy very being.  Ned Land stayed at his post, harpoon in hand.\nSeveral times the animal let us approach.\n\n\"We're overhauling it!\" the Canadian would shout.\n\nThen, just as he was about to strike, the cetacean would steal off\nwith a swiftness I could estimate at no less than thirty miles per hour.\nAnd even at our maximum speed, it took the liberty of thumbing\nits nose at the frigate by running a full circle around us!\nA howl of fury burst from every throat!\n\nBy noon we were no farther along than at eight o'clock in the morning.\n\nCommander Farragut then decided to use more direct methods.\n\n\"Bah!\" he said.  \"So that animal is faster than the Abraham Lincoln.\nAll right, we'll see if it can outrun our conical shells!\nMate, man the gun in the bow!\"\n\nOur forecastle cannon was immediately loaded and leveled.\nThe cannoneer fired a shot, but his shell passed some feet above\nthe cetacean, which stayed half a mile off.\n\n\"Over to somebody with better aim!\" the commander shouted.\n\"And $500.00 to the man who can pierce that infernal beast!\"\n\n\n\n\nCalm of eye, cool of feature, an old gray-bearded gunner--\nI can see him to this day--approached the cannon, put it in position,\nand took aim for a good while.  There was a mighty explosion,\nmingled with cheers from the crew.\n\nThe shell reached its target; it hit the animal, but not in the\nusual fashion--it bounced off that rounded surface and vanished\ninto the sea two miles out.\n\n\"Oh drat!\" said the old gunner in his anger.  \"That rascal must\nbe covered with six-inch armor plate!\"\n\n\"Curse the beast!\"  Commander Farragut shouted.\n\nThe hunt was on again, and Commander Farragut leaned over to me, saying:\n\n\"I'll chase that animal till my frigate explodes!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"and nobody would blame you!\"\n\nWe could still hope that the animal would tire out and not be as\ninsensitive to exhaustion as our steam engines.  But no such luck.\nHour after hour went by without it showing the least sign of weariness.\n\nHowever, to the Abraham Lincoln's credit, it must be said that we\nstruggled on with tireless persistence.  I estimate that we covered\na distance of at least 500 kilometers during this ill-fated day\nof November 6.  But night fell and wrapped the surging ocean\nin its shadows.\n\nBy then I thought our expedition had come to an end, that we would\nnever see this fantastic animal again.  I was mistaken.\n\nAt 10:50 in the evening, that electric light reappeared three\nmiles to windward of the frigate, just as clear and intense\nas the night before.\n\nThe narwhale seemed motionless.  Was it asleep perhaps, weary from\nits workday, just riding with the waves?  This was our chance,\nand Commander Farragut was determined to take full advantage of it.\n\nHe gave his orders.  The Abraham Lincoln stayed at half steam,\nadvancing cautiously so as not to awaken its adversary.\nIn midocean it's not unusual to encounter whales so sound asleep\nthey can successfully be attacked, and Ned Land had harpooned\nmore than one in its slumber.  The Canadian went to resume his post\non the bobstays under the bowsprit.\n\nThe frigate approached without making a sound, stopped two cable\nlengths from the animal and coasted.  Not a soul breathed on board.\nA profound silence reigned over the deck.  We were not 100 feet\nfrom the blazing core of light, whose glow grew stronger and\ndazzled the eyes.\n\nJust then, leaning over the forecastle railing, I saw Ned Land\nbelow me, one hand grasping the martingale, the other brandishing\nhis dreadful harpoon.  Barely twenty feet separated him from\nthe motionless animal.\n\nAll at once his arm shot forward and the harpoon was launched.\nI heard the weapon collide resonantly, as if it had hit\nsome hard substance.\n\n\n\n\nThe electric light suddenly went out, and two enormous waterspouts\ncrashed onto the deck of the frigate, racing like a torrent from\nstem to stern, toppling crewmen, breaking spare masts and yardarms\nfrom their lashings.\n\nA hideous collision occurred, and thrown over the rail with no time\nto catch hold of it, I was hurled into the sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\n\nA Whale of Unknown Species\n\n\n\nALTHOUGH I WAS startled by this unexpected descent, I at least\nhave a very clear recollection of my sensations during it.\n\nAt first I was dragged about twenty feet under.  I'm a good swimmer,\nwithout claiming to equal such other authors as Byron and Edgar Allan Poe,\nwho were master divers, and I didn't lose my head on the way down.\nWith two vigorous kicks of the heel, I came back to the surface\nof the sea.\n\nMy first concern was to look for the frigate.  Had the crew\nseen me go overboard?  Was the Abraham Lincoln tacking about?\nWould Commander Farragut put a longboat to sea?  Could I hope\nto be rescued?\n\nThe gloom was profound.  I glimpsed a black mass disappearing eastward,\nwhere its running lights were fading out in the distance.\nIt was the frigate.  I felt I was done for.\n\n\"Help!  Help!\"  I shouted, swimming desperately toward the Abraham Lincoln.\n\nMy clothes were weighing me down.  The water glued them to\nmy body, they were paralyzing my movements.  I was sinking!\nI was suffocating . . . !\n\n\"Help!\"\n\nThis was the last shout I gave.  My mouth was filling with water.\nI struggled against being dragged into the depths. . . .\n\nSuddenly my clothes were seized by energetic hands, I felt myself\npulled abruptly back to the surface of the sea, and yes, I heard\nthese words pronounced in my ear:\n\n\"If master would oblige me by leaning on my shoulder, master will\nswim with much greater ease.\"\n\nWith one hand I seized the arm of my loyal Conseil.\n\n\"You!\"  I said.  \"You!\"\n\n\"Myself,\" Conseil replied, \"and at master's command.\"\n\n\"That collision threw you overboard along with me?\"\n\n\"Not at all.  But being in master's employ, I followed master.\"\n\nThe fine lad thought this only natural!\n\n\"What about the frigate?\"  I asked.\n\n\"The frigate?\"  Conseil replied, rolling over on his back.\n\"I think master had best not depend on it to any great extent!\"\n\n\"What are you saying?\"\n\n\"I'm saying that just as I jumped overboard, I heard the men at\nthe helm shout, 'Our propeller and rudder are smashed!' \"\n\n\"Smashed?\"\n\n\"Yes, smashed by the monster's tusk!  I believe it's the sole injury\nthe Abraham Lincoln has sustained.  But most inconveniently for us,\nthe ship can no longer steer.\"\n\n\"Then we're done for!\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Conseil replied serenely.  \"However, we still have a few\nhours before us, and in a few hours one can do a great many things!\"\n\nConseil's unflappable composure cheered me up.  I swam more vigorously,\nbut hampered by clothes that were as restricting as a cloak made\nof lead, I was managing with only the greatest difficulty.\nConseil noticed as much.\n\n\"Master will allow me to make an incision,\" he said.\n\nAnd he slipped an open clasp knife under my clothes, slitting them\nfrom top to bottom with one swift stroke.  Then he briskly undressed\nme while I swam for us both.\n\nI then did Conseil the same favor, and we continued to \"navigate\"\nside by side.\n\nBut our circumstances were no less dreadful.  Perhaps they\nhadn't seen us go overboard; and even if they had, the frigate--\nbeing undone by its rudder--couldn't return to leeward after us.\nSo we could count only on its longboats.\n\nConseil had coolly reasoned out this hypothesis and laid his\nplans accordingly.  An amazing character, this boy; in midocean,\nthis stoic lad seemed right at home!\n\nSo, having concluded that our sole chance for salvation\nlay in being picked up by the Abraham Lincoln's longboats,\nwe had to take steps to wait for them as long as possible.\nConsequently, I decided to divide our energies so we wouldn't\nboth be worn out at the same time, and this was the arrangement:\nwhile one of us lay on his back, staying motionless with arms crossed and\nlegs outstretched, the other would swim and propel his partner forward.\nThis towing role was to last no longer than ten minutes, and by\nrelieving each other in this way, we could stay afloat for hours,\nperhaps even until daybreak.\n\nSlim chance, but hope springs eternal in the human breast!\nBesides, there were two of us.  Lastly, I can vouch--as improbable\nas it seems--that even if I had wanted to destroy all my illusions,\neven if I had been willing to \"give in to despair,\" I could not\nhave done so!\n\nThe cetacean had rammed our frigate at about eleven o'clock\nin the evening.  I therefore calculated on eight hours of swimming\nuntil sunrise.  A strenuous task, but feasible, thanks to our\nrelieving each other.  The sea was pretty smooth and barely tired us.\nSometimes I tried to peer through the dense gloom, which was broken\nonly by the phosphorescent flickers coming from our movements.\nI stared at the luminous ripples breaking over my hands,\nshimmering sheets spattered with blotches of bluish gray.\nIt seemed as if we'd plunged into a pool of quicksilver.\n\nNear one o'clock in the morning, I was overcome with\ntremendous exhaustion.  My limbs stiffened in the grip of intense cramps.\nConseil had to keep me going, and attending to our self-preservation\nbecame his sole responsibility.  I soon heard the poor lad gasping;\nhis breathing became shallow and quick.  I didn't think he could\nstand such exertions for much longer.\n\n\"Go on!  Go on!\"  I told him.\n\n\"Leave master behind?\" he replied.  \"Never!  I'll drown before he does!\"\n\nJust then, past the fringes of a large cloud that the wind was\ndriving eastward, the moon appeared.  The surface of the sea\nglistened under its rays.  That kindly light rekindled our strength.\nI held up my head again.  My eyes darted to every point of the horizon.\nI spotted the frigate.  It was five miles from us and formed no\nmore than a dark, barely perceptible mass.  But as for longboats,\nnot a one in sight!\n\nI tried to call out.  What was the use at such a distance!\nMy swollen lips wouldn't let a single sound through.  Conseil could\nstill articulate a few words, and I heard him repeat at intervals:\n\n\"Help!  Help!\"\n\nCeasing all movement for an instant, we listened.  And it may have\nbeen a ringing in my ear, from this organ filling with impeded blood,\nbut it seemed to me that Conseil's shout had received an answer back.\n\n\"Did you hear that?\"  I muttered.\n\n\"Yes, yes!\"\n\nAnd Conseil hurled another desperate plea into space.\n\nThis time there could be no mistake!  A human voice had answered us!\nWas it the voice of some poor devil left behind in midocean,\nsome other victim of that collision suffered by our ship?\nOr was it one of the frigate's longboats, hailing us out of the gloom?\n\nConseil made one final effort, and bracing his hands on my shoulders,\nwhile I offered resistance with one supreme exertion, he raised\nhimself half out of the water, then fell back exhausted.\n\n\"What did you see?\"\n\n\"I saw . . . ,\" he muttered, \"I saw . . . but we mustn't talk . . .\nsave our strength . . . !\"\n\nWhat had he seen?  Then, lord knows why, the thought of the monster came\ninto my head for the first time . . . !  But even so, that voice . . . ?\nGone are the days when Jonahs took refuge in the bellies of whales!\n\nNevertheless, Conseil kept towing me.  Sometimes he looked up,\nstared straight ahead, and shouted a request for directions,\nwhich was answered by a voice that was getting closer and closer.\nI could barely hear it.  I was at the end of my strength; my fingers\ngave out; my hands were no help to me; my mouth opened convulsively,\nfilling with brine; its coldness ran through me; I raised my head\none last time, then I collapsed. . . .\n\nJust then something hard banged against me.  I clung to it.\nThen I felt myself being pulled upward, back to the surface of the water;\nmy chest caved in, and I fainted. . . .\n\nFor certain, I came to quickly, because someone was massaging me\nso vigorously it left furrows in my flesh.  I half opened my eyes. . . .\n\n\"Conseil!\"  I muttered.\n\n\"Did master ring for me?\"  Conseil replied.\n\nJust then, in the last light of a moon settling on the horizon,\nI spotted a face that wasn't Conseil's but which I recognized at once.\n\n\"Ned!\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"In person, sir, and still after his prize!\" the Canadian replied.\n\n\"You were thrown overboard after the frigate's collision?\"\n\n\"Yes, professor, but I was luckier than you, and right away I was\nable to set foot on this floating islet.\"\n\n\"Islet?\"\n\n\"Or in other words, on our gigantic narwhale.\"\n\n\"Explain yourself, Ned.\"\n\n\"It's just that I soon realized why my harpoon got blunted and couldn't\npuncture its hide.\"\n\n\"Why, Ned, why?\"\n\n\"Because, professor, this beast is made of boilerplate steel!\"\n\nAt this point in my story, I need to get a grip on myself,\nreconstruct exactly what I experienced, and make doubly sure\nof everything I write.\n\nThe Canadian's last words caused a sudden upheaval in my brain.\nI swiftly hoisted myself to the summit of this half-submerged creature\nor object that was serving as our refuge.  I tested it with my foot.\nObviously it was some hard, impenetrable substance, not the soft\nmatter that makes up the bodies of our big marine mammals.\n\nBut this hard substance could have been a bony carapace, like those\nthat covered some prehistoric animals, and I might have left it\nat that and classified this monster among such amphibious reptiles\nas turtles or alligators.\n\nWell, no.  The blackish back supporting me was smooth and polished\nwith no overlapping scales.  On impact, it gave off a metallic sonority,\nand as incredible as this sounds, it seemed, I swear, to be made\nof riveted plates.\n\nNo doubts were possible!  This animal, this monster, this natural\nphenomenon that had puzzled the whole scientific world, that had\nmuddled and misled the minds of seamen in both hemispheres, was,\nthere could be no escaping it, an even more astonishing phenomenon--\na phenomenon made by the hand of man.\n\nEven if I had discovered that some fabulous, mythological creature\nreally existed, it wouldn't have given me such a terrific mental jolt.\nIt's easy enough to accept that prodigious things can come from\nour Creator.  But to find, all at once, right before your eyes,\nthat the impossible had been mysteriously achieved by man himself:\nthis staggers the mind!\n\nBut there was no question now.  We were stretched out on the back\nof some kind of underwater boat that, as far as I could judge,\nboasted the shape of an immense steel fish.  Ned Land had clear\nviews on the issue.  Conseil and I could only line up behind him.\n\n\"But then,\" I said, \"does this contraption contain some sort\nof locomotive mechanism, and a crew to run it?\"\n\n\"Apparently,\" the harpooner replied.  \"And yet for the three hours\nI've lived on this floating island, it hasn't shown a sign of life.\"\n\n\"This boat hasn't moved at all?\"\n\n\"No, Professor Aronnax.  It just rides with the waves, but otherwise\nit hasn't stirred.\"\n\n\"But we know that it's certainly gifted with great speed.\nNow then, since an engine is needed to generate that speed,\nand a mechanic to run that engine, I conclude:  we're saved.\"\n\n\"Humph!\"  Ned Land put in, his tone denoting reservations.\n\nJust then, as if to take my side in the argument, a bubbling began\nastern of this strange submersible--whose drive mechanism was obviously\na propeller--and the boat started to move.  We barely had time to hang\non to its topside, which emerged about eighty centimeters above water.\nFortunately its speed was not excessive.\n\n\"So long as it navigates horizontally,\" Ned Land muttered,\n\"I've no complaints.  But if it gets the urge to dive, I wouldn't\ngive $2.00 for my hide!\"\n\nThe Canadian might have quoted a much lower price.\nSo it was imperative to make contact with whatever beings were\nconfined inside the plating of this machine.  I searched its surface\nfor an opening or a hatch, a \"manhole,\" to use the official term;\nbut the lines of rivets had been firmly driven into the sheet-iron\njoins and were straight and uniform.\n\nMoreover, the moon then disappeared and left us in profound darkness.\nWe had to wait for daylight to find some way of getting inside\nthis underwater boat.\n\nSo our salvation lay totally in the hands of the mysterious helmsmen\nsteering this submersible, and if it made a dive, we were done for!\nBut aside from this occurring, I didn't doubt the possibility\nof our making contact with them.  In fact, if they didn't produce\ntheir own air, they inevitably had to make periodic visits\nto the surface of the ocean to replenish their oxygen supply.\nHence the need for some opening that put the boat's interior\nin contact with the atmosphere.\n\nAs for any hope of being rescued by Commander Farragut, that had to be\nrenounced completely.  We were being swept westward, and I estimate\nthat our comparatively moderate speed reached twelve miles per hour.\nThe propeller churned the waves with mathematical regularity,\nsometimes emerging above the surface and throwing phosphorescent\nspray to great heights.\n\nNear four o'clock in the morning, the submersible picked up speed.\nWe could barely cope with this dizzying rush, and the waves battered\nus at close range.  Fortunately Ned's hands came across a big\nmooring ring fastened to the topside of this sheet-iron back,\nand we all held on for dear life.\n\nFinally this long night was over.  My imperfect memories won't let me\nrecall my every impression of it.  A single detail comes back to me.\nSeveral times, during various lulls of wind and sea, I thought I\nheard indistinct sounds, a sort of elusive harmony produced by\ndistant musical chords.  What was the secret behind this underwater\nnavigating, whose explanation the whole world had sought in vain?\nWhat beings lived inside this strange boat?  What mechanical force\nallowed it to move about with such prodigious speed?\n\nDaylight appeared.  The morning mists surrounded us, but they\nsoon broke up.  I was about to proceed with a careful examination\nof the hull, whose topside formed a sort of horizontal platform,\nwhen I felt it sinking little by little.\n\n\"Oh, damnation!\"  Ned Land shouted, stamping his foot on the resonant\nsheet iron.  \"Open up there, you antisocial navigators!\"\n\nBut it was difficult to make yourself heard above the deafening beats\nof the propeller.  Fortunately this submerging movement stopped.\n\nFrom inside the boat, there suddenly came noises of iron fastenings\npushed roughly aside.  One of the steel plates flew up, a man appeared,\ngave a bizarre yell, and instantly disappeared.\n\nA few moments later, eight strapping fellows appeared silently,\ntheir faces like masks, and dragged us down into their fearsome machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\n\n\"Mobilis in Mobili\"\n\n\n\nTHIS BRUTALLY EXECUTED capture was carried out with lightning speed.\nMy companions and I had no time to collect ourselves.  I don't\nknow how they felt about being shoved inside this aquatic prison,\nbut as for me, I was shivering all over.  With whom were we dealing?\nSurely with some new breed of pirates, exploiting the sea after\ntheir own fashion.\n\nThe narrow hatch had barely closed over me when I was surrounded by\nprofound darkness.  Saturated with the outside light, my eyes couldn't\nmake out a thing.  I felt my naked feet clinging to the steps of an\niron ladder.  Forcibly seized, Ned Land and Conseil were behind me.\nAt the foot of the ladder, a door opened and instantly closed behind\nus with a loud clang.\n\nWe were alone.  Where?  I couldn't say, could barely even imagine.\nAll was darkness, but such utter darkness that after several minutes,\nmy eyes were still unable to catch a single one of those hazy gleams\nthat drift through even the blackest nights.\n\nMeanwhile, furious at these goings on, Ned Land gave free rein\nto his indignation.\n\n\"Damnation!\" he exclaimed.  \"These people are about as hospitable\nas the savages of New Caledonia!  All that's lacking is for them\nto be cannibals!  I wouldn't be surprised if they were, but believe\nyou me, they won't eat me without my kicking up a protest!\"\n\n\"Calm yourself, Ned my friend,\" Conseil replied serenely.\n\"Don't flare up so quickly!  We aren't in a kettle yet!\"\n\n\"In a kettle, no,\" the Canadian shot back, \"but in an oven for sure.\nIt's dark enough for one.  Luckily my Bowie knife hasn't left me,\nand I can still see well enough to put it to use.* The first one\nof these bandits who lays a hand on me--\"\n\n*Author's Note:  A Bowie knife is a wide-bladed dagger that Americans\nare forever carrying around.\n\n\"Don't be so irritable, Ned,\" I then told the harpooner,\n\"and don't ruin things for us with pointless violence.\nWho knows whether they might be listening to us?  Instead, let's try\nto find out where we are!\"\n\nI started moving, groping my way.  After five steps I encountered\nan iron wall made of riveted boilerplate.  Then, turning around,\nI bumped into a wooden table next to which several stools had been set.\nThe floor of this prison lay hidden beneath thick, hempen matting\nthat deadened the sound of footsteps.  Its naked walls didn't reveal\nany trace of a door or window.  Going around the opposite way,\nConseil met up with me, and we returned to the middle of this cabin,\nwhich had to be twenty feet long by ten wide.  As for its height,\nnot even Ned Land, with his great stature, was able to determine it.\n\nHalf an hour had already gone by without our situation changing,\nwhen our eyes were suddenly spirited from utter darkness into\nblinding light.  Our prison lit up all at once; in other words,\nit filled with luminescent matter so intense that at first I\ncouldn't stand the brightness of it.  From its glare and whiteness,\nI recognized the electric glow that had played around this\nunderwater boat like some magnificent phosphorescent phenomenon.\nAfter involuntarily closing my eyes, I reopened them and saw\nthat this luminous force came from a frosted half globe curving\nout of the cabin's ceiling.\n\n\"Finally!  It's light enough to see!\"  Ned Land exclaimed, knife in hand,\nstaying on the defensive.\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, then ventured the opposite view.  \"But as for\nour situation, we're still in the dark.\"\n\n\n\n\n\"Master must learn patience,\" said the emotionless Conseil.\n\nThis sudden illumination of our cabin enabled me to examine its\ntiniest details.  It contained only a table and five stools.\nIts invisible door must have been hermetically sealed.\nNot a sound reached our ears.  Everything seemed dead inside this boat.\nWas it in motion, or stationary on the surface of the ocean,\nor sinking into the depths?  I couldn't tell.\n\nBut this luminous globe hadn't been turned on without good reason.\nConsequently, I hoped that some crewmen would soon make an appearance.\nIf you want to consign people to oblivion, you don't light\nup their dungeons.\n\nI was not mistaken.  Unlocking noises became audible, a door opened,\nand two men appeared.\n\nOne was short and stocky, powerfully muscled, broad shouldered,\nrobust of limbs, the head squat, the hair black and luxuriant,\nthe mustache heavy, the eyes bright and penetrating, and his\nwhole personality stamped with that southern-blooded zest that,\nin France, typifies the people of Provence.  The philosopher\nDiderot has very aptly claimed that a man's bearing is the clue\nto his character, and this stocky little man was certainly\na living proof of this claim.  You could sense that his everyday\nconversation must have been packed with such vivid figures of\nspeech as personification, symbolism, and misplaced modifiers.\nBut I was never in a position to verify this because, around me,\nhe used only an odd and utterly incomprehensible dialect.\n\nThe second stranger deserves a more detailed description.\nA disciple of such character-judging anatomists as Gratiolet\nor Engel could have read this man's features like an open book.\nWithout hesitation, I identified his dominant qualities--\nself-confidence, since his head reared like a nobleman's above the arc\nformed by the lines of his shoulders, and his black eyes gazed\nwith icy assurance; calmness, since his skin, pale rather than ruddy,\nindicated tranquility of blood; energy, shown by the swiftly knitting\nmuscles of his brow; and finally courage, since his deep breathing\ndenoted tremendous reserves of vitality.\n\nI might add that this was a man of great pride, that his calm,\nfirm gaze seemed to reflect thinking on an elevated plane,\nand that the harmony of his facial expressions and bodily\nmovements resulted in an overall effect of unquestionable candor--\naccording to the findings of physiognomists, those analysts\nof facial character.\n\nI felt \"involuntarily reassured\" in his presence, and this boded\nwell for our interview.\n\nWhether this individual was thirty-five or fifty years of age,\nI could not precisely state.  He was tall, his forehead broad,\nhis nose straight, his mouth clearly etched, his teeth magnificent,\nhis hands refined, tapered, and to use a word from palmistry,\nhighly \"psychic,\" in other words, worthy of serving a lofty\nand passionate spirit.  This man was certainly the most wonderful\nphysical specimen I had ever encountered.  One unusual detail:\nhis eyes were spaced a little far from each other and could\ninstantly take in nearly a quarter of the horizon.  This ability--\nas I later verified--was strengthened by a range of vision even greater\nthan Ned Land's. When this stranger focused his gaze on an object,\nhis eyebrow lines gathered into a frown, his heavy eyelids closed\naround his pupils to contract his huge field of vision, and he looked!\nWhat a look--as if he could magnify objects shrinking into the distance;\nas if he could probe your very soul; as if he could pierce those sheets\nof water so opaque to our eyes and scan the deepest seas . . . !\n\nWearing caps made of sea-otter fur, and shod in sealskin fishing boots,\nthese two strangers were dressed in clothing made from some unique\nfabric that flattered the figure and allowed great freedom of movement.\n\nThe taller of the two--apparently the leader on board--examined us\nwith the greatest care but without pronouncing a word.  Then, turning to\nhis companion, he conversed with him in a language I didn't recognize.\nIt was a sonorous, harmonious, flexible dialect whose vowels seemed\nto undergo a highly varied accentuation.\n\nThe other replied with a shake of the head and added two or three\nutterly incomprehensible words.  Then he seemed to question me\ndirectly with a long stare.\n\nI replied in clear French that I wasn't familiar with his language;\nbut he didn't seem to understand me, and the situation\ngrew rather baffling.\n\n\"Still, master should tell our story,\" Conseil said to me.\n\"Perhaps these gentlemen will grasp a few words of it!\"\n\nI tried again, telling the tale of our adventures, clearly articulating\nmy every syllable, and not leaving out a single detail.  I stated\nour names and titles; then, in order, I introduced Professor Aronnax,\nhis manservant Conseil, and Mr. Ned Land, harpooner.\n\nThe man with calm, gentle eyes listened to me serenely,\neven courteously, and paid remarkable attention.  But nothing\nin his facial expression indicated that he understood my story.\nWhen I finished, he didn't pronounce a single word.\n\nOne resource still left was to speak English.  Perhaps they would\nbe familiar with this nearly universal language.  But I only knew it,\nas I did the German language, well enough to read it fluently,\nnot well enough to speak it correctly.  Here, however, our overriding\nneed was to make ourselves understood.\n\n\"Come on, it's your turn,\" I told the harpooner.  \"Over to you,\nMr. Land.  Pull out of your bag of tricks the best English ever spoken\nby an Anglo-Saxon, and try for a more favorable result than mine.\"\n\nNed needed no persuading and started our story all over again,\nmost of which I could follow.  Its content was the same,\nbut the form differed.  Carried away by his volatile temperament,\nthe Canadian put great animation into it.  He complained\nvehemently about being imprisoned in defiance of his civil rights,\nasked by virtue of which law he was hereby detained, invoked writs\nof habeas corpus, threatened to press charges against anyone holding\nhim in illegal custody, ranted, gesticulated, shouted, and finally\nconveyed by an expressive gesture that we were dying of hunger.\n\nThis was perfectly true, but we had nearly forgotten the fact.\n\nMuch to his amazement, the harpooner seemed no more intelligible\nthan I had been.  Our visitors didn't bat an eye.  Apparently they\nwere engineers who understood the languages of neither the French\nphysicist Arago nor the English physicist Faraday.\n\nThoroughly baffled after vainly exhausting our philological resources,\nI no longer knew what tactic to pursue, when Conseil told me:\n\n\"If master will authorize me, I'll tell the whole business in German.\"\n\n\"What!  You know German?\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"Like most Flemish people, with all due respect to master.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, my respect is due you.  Go to it, my boy.\"\n\nAnd Conseil, in his serene voice, described for the third time\nthe various vicissitudes of our story.  But despite our narrator's\nfine accent and stylish turns of phrase, the German language met\nwith no success.\n\nFinally, as a last resort, I hauled out everything I could\nremember from my early schooldays, and I tried to narrate our\nadventures in Latin.  Cicero would have plugged his ears and sent\nme to the scullery, but somehow I managed to pull through.\nWith the same negative result.\n\nThis last attempt ultimately misfiring, the two strangers exchanged\na few words in their incomprehensible language and withdrew,\nnot even favoring us with one of those encouraging gestures that are\nused in every country in the world.  The door closed again.\n\n\"This is outrageous!\"  Ned Land shouted, exploding for the\ntwentieth time.  \"I ask you!  We speak French, English, German,\nand Latin to these rogues, and neither of them has the decency\nto even answer back!\"\n\n\"Calm down, Ned,\" I told the seething harpooner.  \"Anger won't\nget us anywhere.\"\n\n\"But professor,\" our irascible companion went on, \"can't you see\nthat we could die of hunger in this iron cage?\"\n\n\"Bah!\"  Conseil put in philosophically.  \"We can hold out a\ngood while yet!\"\n\n\"My friends,\" I said, \"we mustn't despair.  We've gotten out of\ntighter spots.  So please do me the favor of waiting a bit before\nyou form your views on the commander and crew of this boat.\"\n\n\"My views are fully formed,\" Ned Land shot back.  \"They're rogues!\"\n\n\"Oh good!  And from what country?\"\n\n\"Roguedom!\"\n\n\"My gallant Ned, as yet that country isn't clearly marked on maps of\nthe world, but I admit that the nationality of these two strangers is hard\nto make out!  Neither English, French, nor German, that's all we can say.\nBut I'm tempted to think that the commander and his chief officer\nwere born in the low latitudes.  There must be southern blood in them.\nBut as to whether they're Spaniards, Turks, Arabs, or East Indians,\ntheir physical characteristics don't give me enough to go on.\nAnd as for their speech, it's utterly incomprehensible.\"\n\n\"That's the nuisance in not knowing every language,\" Conseil replied,\n\"or the drawback in not having one universal language!\"\n\n\"Which would all go out the window!\"  Ned Land replied.\n\"Don't you see, these people have a language all to themselves,\na language they've invented just to cause despair in decent people\nwho ask for a little dinner!  Why, in every country on earth,\nwhen you open your mouth, snap your jaws, smack your lips and teeth,\nisn't that the world's most understandable message?  From Quebec\nto the Tuamotu Islands, from Paris to the Antipodes, doesn't it mean:\nI'm hungry, give me a bite to eat!\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Conseil put in, \"there are some people so unintelligent\nby nature . . .\"\n\nAs he was saying these words, the door opened.  A steward\nentered.* He brought us some clothes, jackets and sailor's pants,\nmade out of a fabric whose nature I didn't recognize.\nI hurried to change into them, and my companions followed suit.\n\n*Author's Note:  A steward is a waiter on board a steamer.\n\nMeanwhile our silent steward, perhaps a deaf-mute, set the table\nand laid three place settings.\n\n\"There's something serious afoot,\" Conseil said, \"and it bodes well.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" replied the rancorous harpooner.  \"What the devil do you suppose\nthey eat around here?  Turtle livers, loin of shark, dogfish steaks?\"\n\n\"We'll soon find out!\"  Conseil said.\n\nOverlaid with silver dish covers, various platters had been\nneatly positioned on the table cloth, and we sat down to eat.\nAssuredly, we were dealing with civilized people, and if it hadn't\nbeen for this electric light flooding over us, I would have thought\nwe were in the dining room of the Hotel Adelphi in Liverpool,\nor the Grand Hotel in Paris.  However, I feel compelled to mention\nthat bread and wine were totally absent.  The water was fresh and clear,\nbut it was still water--which wasn't what Ned Land had in mind.\nAmong the foods we were served, I was able to identify various\ndaintily dressed fish; but I couldn't make up my mind about certain\notherwise excellent dishes, and I couldn't even tell whether\ntheir contents belonged to the vegetable or the animal kingdom.\nAs for the tableware, it was elegant and in perfect taste.\nEach utensil, spoon, fork, knife, and plate, bore on its reverse\na letter encircled by a Latin motto, and here is its exact duplicate:\n\n\n\nMOBILIS IN MOBILI\n\nN\n\n\n\nMoving within the moving element!  It was a highly appropriate\nmotto for this underwater machine, so long as the preposition\nin is translated as within and not upon.  The letter N was no doubt\nthe initial of the name of that mystifying individual in command\nbeneath the seas!\n\nNed and Conseil had no time for such musings.  They were wolfing\ndown their food, and without further ado I did the same.\nBy now I felt reassured about our fate, and it seemed obvious\nthat our hosts didn't intend to let us die of starvation.\n\nBut all earthly things come to an end, all things must pass,\neven the hunger of people who haven't eaten for fifteen hours.\nOur appetites appeased, we felt an urgent need for sleep.\nA natural reaction after that interminable night of fighting\nfor our lives.\n\n\"Ye gods, I'll sleep soundly,\" Conseil said.\n\n\"Me, I'm out like a light!\"  Ned Land replied.\n\nMy two companions lay down on the cabin's carpeting and were soon\ndeep in slumber.\n\nAs for me, I gave in less readily to this intense need for sleep.\nToo many thoughts had piled up in my mind, too many insoluble\nquestions had arisen, too many images were keeping my eyelids open!\nWhere were we?  What strange power was carrying us along?\nI felt--or at least I thought I did--the submersible sinking\ntoward the sea's lower strata.  Intense nightmares besieged me.\nIn these mysterious marine sanctuaries, I envisioned hosts\nof unknown animals, and this underwater boat seemed to be a blood\nrelation of theirs:  living, breathing, just as fearsome . . . !\nThen my mind grew calmer, my imagination melted into hazy drowsiness,\nand I soon fell into an uneasy slumber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\n\nThe Tantrums of Ned Land\n\n\n\nI HAVE NO IDEA how long this slumber lasted; but it must have been\na good while, since we were\n\ncompletely over our exhaustion.  I was the first one to wake up.\nMy companions weren't yet stirring and still lay in their corners\nlike inanimate objects.\n\nI had barely gotten up from my passably hard mattress when I felt\nmy mind clear, my brain go on the alert.  So I began a careful\nreexamination of our cell.\n\nNothing had changed in its interior arrangements.\nThe prison was still a prison and its prisoners still prisoners.\nBut, taking advantage of our slumber, the steward had cleared the table.\nConsequently, nothing indicated any forthcoming improvement in\nour situation, and I seriously wondered if we were doomed to spend\nthe rest of our lives in this cage.\n\nThis prospect seemed increasingly painful to me because, even though\nmy brain was clear of its obsessions from the night before,\nI was feeling an odd short-windedness in my chest.  It was becoming\nhard for me to breathe.  The heavy air was no longer sufficient\nfor the full play of my lungs.  Although our cell was large,\nwe obviously had used up most of the oxygen it contained.\nIn essence, over an hour's time a single human being consumes\nall the oxygen found in 100 liters of air, at which point that air\nhas become charged with a nearly equal amount of carbon dioxide\nand is no longer fit for breathing.\n\nSo it was now urgent to renew the air in our prison, and no doubt\nthe air in this whole underwater boat as well.\n\nHere a question popped into my head.  How did the commander of this\naquatic residence go about it?  Did he obtain air using chemical methods,\nreleasing the oxygen contained in potassium chlorate by heating it,\nmeanwhile absorbing the carbon dioxide with potassium hydroxide?\nIf so, he would have to keep up some kind of relationship with\nthe shore, to come by the materials needed for such an operation.\nDid he simply limit himself to storing the air in high-pressure\ntanks and then dispense it according to his crew's needs?\nPerhaps.  Or, proceeding in a more convenient, more economical,\nand consequently more probable fashion, was he satisfied with merely\nreturning to breathe at the surface of the water like a cetacean,\nrenewing his oxygen supply every twenty-four hours?  In any event,\nwhatever his method was, it seemed prudent to me that he use this\nmethod without delay.\n\nIn fact, I had already resorted to speeding up my inhalations in order\nto extract from the cell what little oxygen it contained, when suddenly\nI was refreshed by a current of clean air, scented with a salty aroma.\nIt had to be a sea breeze, life-giving and charged with iodine!\nI opened my mouth wide, and my lungs glutted themselves\non the fresh particles.  At the same time, I felt a swaying,\na rolling of moderate magnitude but definitely noticeable.\nThis boat, this sheet-iron monster, had obviously just risen to\nthe surface of the ocean, there to breathe in good whale fashion.\nSo the ship's mode of ventilation was finally established.\n\nWhen I had absorbed a chestful of this clean air, I looked\nfor the conduit--the \"air carrier,\" if you prefer--that allowed\nthis beneficial influx to reach us, and I soon found it.\nAbove the door opened an air vent that let in a fresh current of oxygen,\nrenewing the thin air in our cell.\n\nI had gotten to this point in my observations when Ned and Conseil\nwoke up almost simultaneously, under the influence of this reviving\nair purification.  They rubbed their eyes, stretched their arms,\nand sprang to their feet.\n\n\"Did master sleep well?\"  Conseil asked me with his perennial\ngood manners.\n\n\"Extremely well, my gallant lad,\" I replied.  \"And how about you,\nMr. Ned Land?\"\n\n\"Like a log, professor.  But I must be imagining things, because it\nseems like I'm breathing a sea breeze!\"\n\nA seaman couldn't be wrong on this topic, and I told the Canadian\nwhat had gone on while he slept.\n\n\"Good!\" he said.  \"That explains perfectly all that bellowing we heard,\nwhen our so-called narwhale lay in sight of the Abraham Lincoln.\"\n\n\"Perfectly, Mr. Land.  It was catching its breath!\"\n\n\"Only I've no idea what time it is, Professor Aronnax,\nunless maybe it's dinnertime?\"\n\n\"Dinnertime, my fine harpooner?  I'd say at least breakfast time,\nbecause we've certainly woken up to a new day.\"\n\n\"Which indicates,\" Conseil replied, \"that we've spent twenty-four\nhours in slumber.\"\n\n\"That's my assessment,\" I replied.\n\n\"I won't argue with you,\" Ned Land answered.  \"But dinner or breakfast,\nthat steward will be plenty welcome whether he brings the one\nor the other.\"\n\n\"The one and the other,\" Conseil said.\n\n\"Well put,\" the Canadian replied.  \"We deserve two meals,\nand speaking for myself, I'll do justice to them both.\"\n\n\"All right, Ned, let's wait and see!\"  I replied.  \"It's clear\nthat these strangers don't intend to let us die of hunger,\notherwise last evening's dinner wouldn't make any sense.\"\n\n\"Unless they're fattening us up!\"  Ned shot back.\n\n\"I object,\" I replied.  \"We have not fallen into the hands of cannibals.\"\n\n\"Just because they don't make a habit of it,\" the Canadian replied\nin all seriousness, \"doesn't mean they don't indulge from time to time.\nWho knows?  Maybe these people have gone without fresh meat for a\nlong while, and in that case three healthy, well-built specimens\nlike the professor, his manservant, and me ---\"\n\n\"Get rid of those ideas, Mr. Land,\" I answered the harpooner.\n\"And above all, don't let them lead you to flare up against our hosts,\nwhich would only make our situation worse.\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" the harpooner said, \"I'm as hungry as all Hades,\nand dinner or breakfast, not one puny meal has arrived!\"\n\n\"Mr. Land,\" I answered, \"we have to adapt to the schedule on board,\nand I imagine our stomachs are running ahead of the chief\ncook's dinner bell.\"\n\n\"Well then, we'll adjust our stomachs to the chef's timetable!\"\nConseil replied serenely.\n\n\"There you go again, Conseil my friend!\" the impatient Canadian\nshot back.  \"You never allow yourself any displays of bile or attacks\nof nerves!  You're everlastingly calm!  You'd say your after-meal\ngrace even if you didn't get any food for your before-meal blessing--\nand you'd starve to death rather than complain!\"\n\n\"What good would it do?\"  Conseil asked.\n\n\"Complaining doesn't have to do good, it just feels good!\nAnd if these pirates--I say pirates out of consideration for the\nprofessor's feelings, since he doesn't want us to call them cannibals--\nif these pirates think they're going to smother me in this cage\nwithout hearing what cusswords spice up my outbursts, they've got\nanother think coming!  Look here, Professor Aronnax, speak frankly.\nHow long do you figure they'll keep us in this iron box?\"\n\n\"To tell the truth, friend Land, I know little more about it\nthan you do.\"\n\n\"But in a nutshell, what do you suppose is going on?\"\n\n\"My supposition is that sheer chance has made us privy to an\nimportant secret.  Now then, if the crew of this underwater\nboat have a personal interest in keeping that secret,\nand if their personal interest is more important than the lives\nof three men, I believe that our very existence is in jeopardy.\nIf such is not the case, then at the first available opportunity,\nthis monster that has swallowed us will return us to the world\ninhabited by our own kind.\"\n\n\"Unless they recruit us to serve on the crew,\" Conseil said,\n\"and keep us here--\"\n\n\"Till the moment,\" Ned Land answered, \"when some frigate that's faster\nor smarter than the Abraham Lincoln captures this den of buccaneers,\nthen hangs all of us by the neck from the tip of a mainmast yardarm!\"\n\n\"Well thought out, Mr. Land,\" I replied.  \"But as yet, I don't believe\nwe've been tendered any enlistment offers.  Consequently, it's pointless\nto argue about what tactics we should pursue in such a case.\nI repeat:  let's wait, let's be guided by events, and let's do nothing,\nsince right now there's nothing we can do.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, professor,\" the harpooner replied, not wanting\nto give in.  \"There is something we can do.\"\n\n\"Oh?  And what, Mr. Land?\"\n\n\"Break out of here!\"\n\n\"Breaking out of a prison on shore is difficult enough, but with\nan underwater prison, it strikes me as completely unworkable.\"\n\n\"Come now, Ned my friend,\" Conseil asked, \"how would you answer\nmaster's objection?  I refuse to believe that an American is at\nthe end of his tether.\"\n\nVisibly baffled, the harpooner said nothing.  Under the conditions\nin which fate had left us, it was absolutely impossible to escape.\nBut a Canadian's wit is half French, and Mr. Ned Land made this\nclear in his reply.\n\n\"So, Professor Aronnax,\" he went on after thinking for a few moments,\n\"you haven't figured out what people do when they can't escape\nfrom their prison?\"\n\n\"No, my friend.\"\n\n\"Easy.  They fix things so they stay there.\"\n\n\"Of course!\"  Conseil put in.  \"Since we're deep in the ocean,\nbeing inside this boat is vastly preferable to being above it\nor below it!\"\n\n\"But we fix things by kicking out all the jailers, guards, and wardens,\"\nNed Land added.\n\n\"What's this, Ned?\"  I asked.  \"You'd seriously consider taking\nover this craft?\"\n\n\"Very seriously,\" the Canadian replied.\n\n\"It's impossible.\"\n\n\"And why is that, sir?  Some promising opportunity might come up,\nand I don't see what could stop us from taking advantage of it.\nIf there are only about twenty men on board this machine, I don't\nthink they can stave off two Frenchmen and a Canadian!\"\n\nIt seemed wiser to accept the harpooner's proposition than to debate it.\nAccordingly, I was content to reply:\n\n\"Let such circumstances come, Mr. Land, and we'll see.  But until then,\nI beg you to control your impatience.  We need to act shrewdly,\nand your flare-ups won't give rise to any promising opportunities.\nSo swear to me that you'll accept our situation without throwing\na tantrum over it.\"\n\n\"I give you my word, professor,\" Ned Land replied in an\nunenthusiastic tone.  \"No vehement phrases will leave my mouth,\nno vicious gestures will give my feelings away, not even when they\ndon't feed us on time.\"\n\n\"I have your word, Ned,\" I answered the Canadian.\n\nThen our conversation petered out, and each of us withdrew\ninto his own thoughts.  For my part, despite the harpooner's\nconfident talk, I admit that I entertained no illusions.\nI had no faith in those promising opportunities that Ned Land mentioned.\nTo operate with such efficiency, this underwater boat had to have\na sizeable crew, so if it came to a physical contest, we would\nbe facing an overwhelming opponent.  Besides, before we could\ndo anything, we had to be free, and that we definitely were not.\nI didn't see any way out of this sheet-iron, hermetically sealed cell.\nAnd if the strange commander of this boat did have a secret to keep--\nwhich seemed rather likely--he would never give us freedom of movement\naboard his vessel.  Now then, would he resort to violence in order\nto be rid of us, or would he drop us off one day on some remote coast?\nThere lay the unknown.  All these hypotheses seemed extremely\nplausible to me, and to hope for freedom through use of force,\nyou had to be a harpooner.\n\nI realized, moreover, that Ned Land's brooding was getting\nhim madder by the minute.  Little by little, I heard those\naforesaid cusswords welling up in the depths of his gullet,\nand I saw his movements turn threatening again.  He stood up,\npacing in circles like a wild beast in a cage, striking the walls\nwith his foot and fist.  Meanwhile the hours passed, our hunger\nnagged unmercifully, and this time the steward did not appear.\nWhich amounted to forgetting our castaway status for much too long,\nif they really had good intentions toward us.\n\nTortured by the growling of his well-built stomach, Ned Land\nwas getting more and more riled, and despite his word of honor,\nI was in real dread of an explosion when he stood in the presence\nof one of the men on board.\n\nFor two more hours Ned Land's rage increased.  The Canadian shouted\nand pleaded, but to no avail.  The sheet-iron walls were deaf.\nI didn't hear a single sound inside this dead-seeming boat.\nThe vessel hadn't stirred, because I obviously would have felt its hull\nvibrating under the influence of the propeller.  It had undoubtedly\nsunk into the watery deep and no longer belonged to the outside world.\nAll this dismal silence was terrifying.\n\nAs for our neglect, our isolation in the depths of this cell,\nI was afraid to guess at how long it might last.  Little by little,\nhopes I had entertained after our interview with the ship's commander\nwere fading away.  The gentleness of the man's gaze, the generosity\nexpressed in his facial features, the nobility of his bearing,\nall vanished from my memory.  I saw this mystifying individual\nanew for what he inevitably must be:  cruel and merciless.\nI viewed him as outside humanity, beyond all feelings of compassion,\nthe implacable foe of his fellow man, toward whom he must have sworn\nan undying hate!\n\nBut even so, was the man going to let us die of starvation,\nlocked up in this cramped prison, exposed to those horrible\ntemptations to which people are driven by extreme hunger?\nThis grim possibility took on a dreadful intensity in my mind,\nand fired by my imagination, I felt an unreasoning terror run through me.\nConseil stayed calm.  Ned Land bellowed.\n\nJust then a noise was audible outside.  Footsteps rang on\nthe metal tiling.  The locks were turned, the door opened,\nthe steward appeared.\n\nBefore I could make a single movement to prevent him, the Canadian\nrushed at the poor man, threw him down, held him by the throat.\nThe steward was choking in the grip of those powerful hands.\n\nConseil was already trying to loosen the harpooner's hands from his\nhalf-suffocated victim, and I had gone to join in the rescue, when I\nwas abruptly nailed to the spot by these words pronounced in French:\n\n\"Calm down, Mr. Land!  And you, professor, kindly listen to me!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\n\nThe Man of the Waters\n\n\n\nIT WAS THE ship's commander who had just spoken.\n\nAt these words Ned Land stood up quickly.  Nearly strangled,\nthe steward staggered out at a signal from his superior;\nbut such was the commander's authority aboard his vessel,\nnot one gesture gave away the resentment that this man must have\nfelt toward the Canadian.  In silence we waited for the outcome\nof this scene; Conseil, in spite of himself, seemed almost fascinated,\nI was stunned.\n\nArms crossed, leaning against a corner of the table, the commander\nstudied us with great care.  Was he reluctant to speak further?\nDid he regret those words he had just pronounced in French?  You would\nhave thought so.\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, which none of us would have\ndreamed of interrupting:\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said in a calm, penetrating voice,\n\"I speak French, English, German, and Latin with equal fluency.\nHence I could have answered you as early as our initial interview,\nbut first I wanted to make your acquaintance and then think things over.\nYour four versions of the same narrative, perfectly consistent by\nand large, established your personal identities for me.  I now know\nthat sheer chance has placed in my presence Professor Pierre Aronnax,\nspecialist in natural history at the Paris Museum and entrusted with\na scientific mission abroad, his manservant Conseil, and Ned Land,\na harpooner of Canadian origin aboard the Abraham Lincoln,\na frigate in the national navy of the United States of America.\"\n\nI bowed in agreement.  The commander hadn't put a question to me.\nSo no answer was called for.  This man expressed himself with perfect\nease and without a trace of an accent.  His phrasing was clear,\nhis words well chosen, his facility in elocution remarkable.\nAnd yet, to me, he didn't have \"the feel\" of a fellow countryman.\n\nHe went on with the conversation as follows:\n\n\"No doubt, sir, you've felt that I waited rather too long before\npaying you this second visit.  After discovering your identities,\nI wanted to weigh carefully what policy to pursue toward you.\nI had great difficulty deciding.  Some extremely inconvenient\ncircumstances have brought you into the presence of a man who\nhas cut himself off from humanity.  Your coming has disrupted\nmy whole existence.\"\n\n\"Unintentionally,\" I said.\n\n\"Unintentionally?\" the stranger replied, raising his voice a little.\n\"Was it unintentionally that the Abraham Lincoln hunted me on every sea?\nWas it unintentionally that you traveled aboard that frigate?\nWas it unintentionally that your shells bounced off my ship's hull?\nWas it unintentionally that Mr. Ned Land hit me with his harpoon?\"\n\nI detected a controlled irritation in these words.  But there was\na perfectly natural reply to these charges, and I made it.\n\n\"Sir,\" I said, \"you're surely unaware of the discussions that have\ntaken place in Europe and America with yourself as the subject.\nYou don't realize that various accidents, caused by collisions with your\nunderwater machine, have aroused public passions on those two continents.\nI'll spare you the innumerable hypotheses with which we've tried\nto explain this inexplicable phenomenon, whose secret is yours alone.\nBut please understand that the Abraham Lincoln chased you over\nthe Pacific high seas in the belief it was hunting some powerful\nmarine monster, which had to be purged from the ocean at all cost.\"\n\nA half smile curled the commander's lips; then, in a calmer tone:\n\n\"Professor Aronnax,\" he replied, \"do you dare claim that your frigate\nwouldn't have chased and cannonaded an underwater boat as readily\nas a monster?\"\n\nThis question baffled me, since Commander Farragut would certainly\nhave shown no such hesitation.  He would have seen it as his sworn\nduty to destroy a contrivance of this kind just as promptly\nas a gigantic narwhale.\n\n\"So you understand, sir,\" the stranger went on, \"that I have a right\nto treat you as my enemy.\"\n\nI kept quiet, with good reason.  What was the use of debating such\na proposition, when superior force can wipe out the best arguments?\n\n\"It took me a good while to decide,\" the commander went on.\n\"Nothing obliged me to grant you hospitality.  If I were to part company\nwith you, I'd have no personal interest in ever seeing you again.\nI could put you back on the platform of this ship that has served\nas your refuge.  I could sink under the sea, and I could forget\nyou ever existed.  Wouldn't that be my right?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it would be the right of a savage,\" I replied.\n\"But not that of a civilized man.\"\n\n\"Professor,\" the commander replied swiftly, \"I'm not what you\nterm a civilized man!  I've severed all ties with society,\nfor reasons that I alone have the right to appreciate.\nTherefore I obey none of its regulations, and I insist that you\nnever invoke them in front of me!\"\n\nThis was plain speaking.  A flash of anger and scorn lit up the\nstranger's eyes, and I glimpsed a fearsome past in this man's life.\nNot only had he placed himself beyond human laws, he had rendered\nhimself independent, out of all reach, free in the strictest sense\nof the word!  For who would dare chase him to the depths of the sea\nwhen he thwarted all attacks on the surface?  What ship could\nwithstand a collision with his underwater Monitor?  What armor plate,\nno matter how heavy, could bear the thrusts of his spur?\nNo man among men could call him to account for his actions.\nGod, if he believed in Him, his conscience if he had one--\nthese were the only judges to whom he was answerable.\n\nThese thoughts swiftly crossed my mind while this strange individual\nfell silent, like someone completely self-absorbed. I regarded him\nwith a mixture of fear and fascination, in the same way, no doubt,\nthat Oedipus regarded the Sphinx.\n\nAfter a fairly long silence, the commander went on with our conversation.\n\n\"So I had difficulty deciding,\" he said.  \"But I concluded\nthat my personal interests could be reconciled with that\nnatural compassion to which every human being has a right.\nSince fate has brought you here, you'll stay aboard my vessel.\nYou'll be free here, and in exchange for that freedom,\nmoreover totally related to it, I'll lay on you just one condition.\nYour word that you'll submit to it will be sufficient.\"\n\n\"Go on, sir,\" I replied.  \"I assume this condition is one an honest\nman can accept?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  Just this.  It's possible that certain unforeseen events\nmay force me to confine you to your cabins for some hours, or even for\nsome days as the case may be.  Since I prefer never to use violence,\nI expect from you in such a case, even more than in any other,\nyour unquestioning obedience.  By acting in this way, I shield you\nfrom complicity, I absolve you of all responsibility, since I myself\nmake it impossible for you to see what you aren't meant to see.\nDo you accept this condition?\"\n\nSo things happened on board that were quite odd to say the least,\nthings never to be seen by people not placing themselves beyond\nsociety's laws!  Among all the surprises the future had in store\nfor me, this would not be the mildest.\n\n\"We accept,\" I replied.  \"Only, I'll ask your permission, sir,\nto address a question to you, just one.\"\n\n\"Go ahead, sir.\"\n\n\"You said we'd be free aboard your vessel?\"\n\n\"Completely.\"\n\n\"Then I would ask what you mean by this freedom.\"\n\n\"Why, the freedom to come, go, see, and even closely observe\neverything happening here--except under certain rare circumstances--\nin short, the freedom we ourselves enjoy, my companions and I.\"\n\nIt was obvious that we did not understand each other.\n\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" I went on, \"but that's merely the freedom\nthat every prisoner has, the freedom to pace his cell!\nThat's not enough for us.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, it will have to do!\"\n\n\"What!  We must give up seeing our homeland, friends, and relatives\never again?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  But giving up that intolerable earthly yoke that some\nmen call freedom is perhaps less painful than you think!\"\n\n\"By thunder!\"  Ned Land shouted.  \"I'll never promise I won't try\ngetting out of here!\"\n\n\"I didn't ask for such a promise, Mr. Land,\" the commander replied coldly.\n\n\"Sir,\" I replied, flaring up in spite of myself, \"you're taking\nunfair advantage of us!  This is sheer cruelty!\"\n\n\"No, sir, it's an act of mercy!  You're my prisoners of war!\nI've cared for you when, with a single word, I could plunge you back\ninto the ocean depths!  You attacked me!  You've just stumbled on\na secret no living man must probe, the secret of my entire existence!\nDo you think I'll send you back to a world that must know nothing\nmore of me?  Never!  By keeping you on board, it isn't you whom I\ncare for, it's me!\"\n\nThese words indicated that the commander pursued a policy\nimpervious to arguments.\n\n\"Then, sir,\" I went on, \"you give us, quite simply, a choice between\nlife and death?\"\n\n\"Quite simply.\"\n\n\"My friends,\" I said, \"to a question couched in these terms,\nour answer can be taken for granted.  But no solemn promises bind\nus to the commander of this vessel.\"\n\n\"None, sir,\" the stranger replied.\n\nThen, in a gentler voice, he went on:\n\n\"Now, allow me to finish what I have to tell you.  I've heard of you,\nProfessor Aronnax.  You, if not your companions, won't perhaps complain\ntoo much about the stroke of fate that has brought us together.\nAmong the books that make up my favorite reading, you'll find the work\nyou've published on the great ocean depths.  I've pored over it.\nYou've taken your studies as far as terrestrial science can go.\nBut you don't know everything because you haven't seen everything.\nLet me tell you, professor, you won't regret the time you spend\naboard my vessel.  You're going to voyage through a land of wonders.\nStunned amazement will probably be your habitual state of mind.\nIt will be a long while before you tire of the sights constantly before\nyour eyes.  I'm going to make another underwater tour of the world--\nperhaps my last, who knows?--and I'll review everything I've studied\nin the depths of these seas that I've crossed so often, and you\ncan be my fellow student.  Starting this very day, you'll enter\na new element, you'll see what no human being has ever seen before--\nsince my men and I no longer count--and thanks to me, you're going\nto learn the ultimate secrets of our planet.\"\n\nI can't deny it; the commander's words had a tremendous effect on me.\nHe had caught me on my weak side, and I momentarily forgot that not\neven this sublime experience was worth the loss of my freedom.\nBesides, I counted on the future to resolve this important question.\nSo I was content to reply:\n\n\"Sir, even though you've cut yourself off from humanity, I can\nsee that you haven't disowned all human feeling.  We're castaways\nwhom you've charitably taken aboard, we'll never forget that.\nSpeaking for myself, I don't rule out that the interests of science\ncould override even the need for freedom, which promises me that,\nin exchange, our encounter will provide great rewards.\"\n\nI thought the commander would offer me his hand, to seal our agreement.\nHe did nothing of the sort.  I regretted that.\n\n\"One last question,\" I said, just as this inexplicable being seemed\nready to withdraw.\n\n\"Ask it, professor.\"\n\n\"By what name am I to call you?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" the commander replied, \"to you, I'm simply Captain Nemo;* to me,\nyou and your companions are simply passengers on the Nautilus.\"\n\n*Latin: nemo means \"no one.\"  Ed.\n\nCaptain Nemo called out.  A steward appeared.  The captain gave\nhim his orders in that strange language I couldn't even identify.\nThen, turning to the Canadian and Conseil:\n\n\"A meal is waiting for you in your cabin,\" he told them.\n\"Kindly follow this man.\"\n\n\"That's an offer I can't refuse!\" the harpooner replied.\n\nAfter being confined for over thirty hours, he and Conseil were\nfinally out of this cell.\n\n\"And now, Professor Aronnax, our own breakfast is ready.\nAllow me to lead the way.\"\n\n\"Yours to command, captain.\"\n\nI followed Captain Nemo, and as soon as I passed through the doorway,\nI went down a kind of electrically lit passageway that resembled\na gangway on a ship.  After a stretch of some ten meters, a second\ndoor opened before me.\n\nI then entered a dining room, decorated and furnished in austere\ngood taste.  Inlaid with ebony trim, tall oaken sideboards stood at\nboth ends of this room, and sparkling on their shelves were staggered\nrows of earthenware, porcelain, and glass of incalculable value.\nThere silver-plated dinnerware gleamed under rays pouring from light\nfixtures in the ceiling, whose glare was softened and tempered\nby delicately painted designs.\n\nIn the center of this room stood a table, richly spread.\nCaptain Nemo indicated the place I was to occupy.\n\n\"Be seated,\" he told me, \"and eat like the famished man you must be.\"\n\nOur breakfast consisted of several dishes whose contents\nwere all supplied by the sea, and some foods whose nature\nand derivation were unknown to me.  They were good, I admit,\nbut with a peculiar flavor to which I would soon grow accustomed.\nThese various food items seemed to be rich in phosphorous, and I\nthought that they, too, must have been of marine origin.\n\nCaptain Nemo stared at me.  I had asked him nothing, but he read\nmy thoughts, and on his own he answered the questions I was itching\nto address him.\n\n\"Most of these dishes are new to you,\" he told me.  \"But you can\nconsume them without fear.  They're healthy and nourishing.\nI renounced terrestrial foods long ago, and I'm none the worse for it.\nMy crew are strong and full of energy, and they eat what I eat.\"\n\n\"So,\" I said, \"all these foods are products of the sea?\"\n\n\"Yes, professor, the sea supplies all my needs.  Sometimes I cast my nets\nin our wake, and I pull them up ready to burst.  Sometimes I go hunting\nright in the midst of this element that has long seemed so far out of\nman's reach, and I corner the game that dwells in my underwater forests.\nLike the flocks of old Proteus, King Neptune's shepherd,\nmy herds graze without fear on the ocean's immense prairies.\nThere I own vast properties that I harvest myself, and which are\nforever sown by the hand of the Creator of All Things.\"\n\nI stared at Captain Nemo in definite astonishment, and I answered him:\n\n\"Sir, I understand perfectly how your nets can furnish excellent\nfish for your table; I understand less how you can chase aquatic\ngame in your underwater forests; but how a piece of red meat,\nno matter how small, can figure in your menu, that I don't\nunderstand at all.\"\n\n\"Nor I, sir,\" Captain Nemo answered me.  \"I never touch the flesh\nof land animals.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, this . . . ,\" I went on, pointing to a dish where\nsome slices of loin were still left.\n\n\"What you believe to be red meat, professor, is nothing other than loin\nof sea turtle.  Similarly, here are some dolphin livers you might mistake\nfor stewed pork.  My chef is a skillful food processor who excels\nat pickling and preserving these various exhibits from the ocean.\nFeel free to sample all of these foods.  Here are some preserves\nof sea cucumber that a Malaysian would declare to be unrivaled\nin the entire world, here's cream from milk furnished by the udders\nof cetaceans, and sugar from the huge fucus plants in the North Sea;\nand finally, allow me to offer you some marmalade of sea anemone,\nequal to that from the tastiest fruits.\"\n\nSo I sampled away, more as a curiosity seeker than an epicure,\nwhile Captain Nemo delighted me with his incredible anecdotes.\n\n\"But this sea, Professor Aronnax,\" he told me, \"this prodigious,\ninexhaustible wet nurse of a sea not only feeds me, she dresses\nme as well.  That fabric covering you was woven from the masses\nof filaments that anchor certain seashells; as the ancients\nwere wont to do, it was dyed with purple ink from the murex snail\nand shaded with violet tints that I extract from a marine slug,\nthe Mediterranean sea hare.  The perfumes you'll find on the washstand\nin your cabin were produced from the oozings of marine plants.\nYour mattress was made from the ocean's softest eelgrass.\nYour quill pen will be whalebone, your ink a juice secreted\nby cuttlefish or squid.  Everything comes to me from the sea,\njust as someday everything will return to it!\"\n\n\"You love the sea, captain.\"\n\n\"Yes, I love it!  The sea is the be all and end all!  It covers\nseven-tenths of the planet earth.  Its breath is clean and healthy.\nIt's an immense wilderness where a man is never lonely, because he\nfeels life astir on every side.  The sea is simply the vehicle\nfor a prodigious, unearthly mode of existence; it's simply movement\nand love; it's living infinity, as one of your poets put it.\nAnd in essence, professor, nature is here made manifest\nby all three of her kingdoms, mineral, vegetable, and animal.\nThe last of these is amply represented by the four zoophyte groups,\nthree classes of articulates, five classes of mollusks, and three\nvertebrate classes:  mammals, reptiles, and those countless\nlegions of fish, an infinite order of animals totaling more than\n13,000 species, of which only one-tenth belong to fresh water.\nThe sea is a vast pool of nature.  Our globe began with the sea,\nso to speak, and who can say we won't end with it!\nHere lies supreme tranquility.  The sea doesn't belong to tyrants.\nOn its surface they can still exercise their iniquitous claims,\nbattle each other, devour each other, haul every earthly horror.\nBut thirty feet below sea level, their dominion ceases,\ntheir influence fades, their power vanishes!  Ah, sir, live!\nLive in the heart of the seas!  Here alone lies independence!\nHere I recognize no superiors!  Here I'm free!\"\n\nCaptain Nemo suddenly fell silent in the midst of this\nenthusiastic outpouring.  Had he let himself get carried away,\npast the bounds of his habitual reserve?  Had he said too much?\nFor a few moments he strolled up and down, all aquiver.\nThen his nerves grew calmer, his facial features recovered their\nusual icy composure, and turning to me:\n\n\"Now, professor,\" he said, \"if you'd like to inspect the Nautilus, I'm\nyours to command.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\n\nThe Nautilus\n\n\n\nCAPTAIN NEMO stood up.  I followed him.  Contrived at the rear\nof the dining room, a double door opened, and I entered a room\nwhose dimensions equaled the one I had just left.\n\nIt was a library.  Tall, black-rosewood bookcases, inlaid with copperwork,\nheld on their wide shelves a large number of uniformly bound books.\nThese furnishings followed the contours of the room, their lower\nparts leading to huge couches upholstered in maroon leather\nand curved for maximum comfort.  Light, movable reading stands,\nwhich could be pushed away or pulled near as desired,\nallowed books to be positioned on them for easy study.\nIn the center stood a huge table covered with pamphlets,\namong which some newspapers, long out of date, were visible.\nElectric light flooded this whole harmonious totality, falling from\nfour frosted half globes set in the scrollwork of the ceiling.\nI stared in genuine wonderment at this room so ingeniously laid out,\nand I couldn't believe my eyes.\n\n\"Captain Nemo,\" I told my host, who had just stretched out on\na couch, \"this is a library that would do credit to more than one\ncontinental palace, and I truly marvel to think it can go with you\ninto the deepest seas.\"\n\n\"Where could one find greater silence or solitude, professor?\"\nCaptain Nemo replied.  \"Did your study at the museum afford you\nsuch a perfect retreat?\"\n\n\"No, sir, and I might add that it's quite a humble one next to yours.\nYou own 6,000 or 7,000 volumes here . . .\"\n\n\"12,000, Professor Aronnax.  They're my sole remaining ties\nwith dry land.  But I was done with the shore the day my Nautilus\nsubmerged for the first time under the waters.  That day I purchased\nmy last volumes, my last pamphlets, my last newspapers, and ever\nsince I've chosen to believe that humanity no longer thinks or writes.\nIn any event, professor, these books are at your disposal, and you\nmay use them freely.\"\n\nI thanked Captain Nemo and approached the shelves of this library.\nWritten in every language, books on science, ethics, and literature\nwere there in abundance, but I didn't see a single work on economics--\nthey seemed to be strictly banned on board.  One odd detail:\nall these books were shelved indiscriminately without regard\nto the language in which they were written, and this jumble proved\nthat the Nautilus's captain could read fluently whatever volumes\nhe chanced to pick up.\n\nAmong these books I noted masterpieces by the greats of ancient\nand modern times, in other words, all of humanity's finest\nachievements in history, poetry, fiction, and science,\nfrom Homer to Victor Hugo, from Xenophon to Michelet,\nfrom Rabelais to Madame George Sand.  But science, in particular,\nrepresented the major investment of this library:  books on mechanics,\nballistics, hydrography, meteorology, geography, geology, etc., held\na place there no less important than works on natural history,\nand I realized that they made up the captain's chief reading.\nThere I saw the complete works of Humboldt, the complete Arago,\nas well as works by Foucault, Henri Sainte-Claire Deville, Chasles,\nMilne-Edwards, Quatrefages, John Tyndall, Faraday, Berthelot,\nFather Secchi, Petermann, Commander Maury, Louis Agassiz,\netc., plus the transactions of France's Academy of Sciences,\nbulletins from the various geographical societies, etc., and in\na prime location, those two volumes on the great ocean depths\nthat had perhaps earned me this comparatively charitable welcome\nfrom Captain Nemo.  Among the works of Joseph Bertrand, his book\nentitled The Founders of Astronomy even gave me a definite date;\nand since I knew it had appeared in the course of 1865, I concluded\nthat the fitting out of the Nautilus hadn't taken place before then.\nAccordingly, three years ago at the most, Captain Nemo had begun\nhis underwater existence.  Moreover, I hoped some books even\nmore recent would permit me to pinpoint the date precisely;\nbut I had plenty of time to look for them, and I didn't want to put\noff any longer our stroll through the wonders of the Nautilus.\n\n\"Sir,\" I told the captain, \"thank you for placing this library\nat my disposal.  There are scientific treasures here, and I'll take\nadvantage of them.\"\n\n\"This room isn't only a library,\" Captain Nemo said, \"it's also\na smoking room.\"\n\n\"A smoking room?\"  I exclaimed.  \"Then one may smoke on board?\"\n\n\"Surely.\"\n\n\"In that case, sir, I'm forced to believe that you've kept up\nrelations with Havana.\"\n\n\"None whatever,\" the captain replied.  \"Try this cigar,\nProfessor Aronnax, and even though it doesn't come from Havana,\nit will satisfy you if you're a connoisseur.\"\n\nI took the cigar offered me, whose shape recalled those from Cuba;\nbut it seemed to be made of gold leaf.  I lit it at a small brazier\nsupported by an elegant bronze stand, and I inhaled my first whiffs\nwith the relish of a smoker who hasn't had a puff in days.\n\n\"It's excellent,\" I said, \"but it's not from the tobacco plant.\"\n\n\"Right,\" the captain replied, \"this tobacco comes from neither\nHavana nor the Orient.  It's a kind of nicotine-rich seaweed\nthat the ocean supplies me, albeit sparingly.  Do you still miss\nyour Cubans, sir?\"\n\n\"Captain, I scorn them from this day forward.\"\n\n\"Then smoke these cigars whenever you like, without debating\ntheir origin.  They bear no government seal of approval, but I\nimagine they're none the worse for it.\"\n\n\"On the contrary.\"\n\nJust then Captain Nemo opened a door facing the one by which I had entered\nthe library, and I passed into an immense, splendidly lit lounge.\n\nIt was a huge quadrilateral with canted corners, ten meters long,\nsix wide, five high.  A luminous ceiling, decorated with\ndelicate arabesques, distributed a soft, clear daylight over all\nthe wonders gathered in this museum.  For a museum it truly was,\nin which clever hands had spared no expense to amass every natural\nand artistic treasure, displaying them with the helter-skelter\npicturesqueness that distinguishes a painter's studio.\n\nSome thirty pictures by the masters, uniformly framed and separated\nby gleaming panoplies of arms, adorned walls on which were stretched\ntapestries of austere design.  There I saw canvases of the highest value,\nthe likes of which I had marveled at in private European collections\nand art exhibitions.  The various schools of the old masters\nwere represented by a Raphael Madonna, a Virgin by Leonardo\nda Vinci, a nymph by Correggio, a woman by Titian, an adoration\nof the Magi by Veronese, an assumption of the Virgin by Murillo,\na Holbein portrait, a monk by Velazquez, a martyr by Ribera,\na village fair by Rubens, two Flemish landscapes by Teniers,\nthree little genre paintings by Gerard Dow, Metsu, and Paul Potter,\ntwo canvases by Gericault and Prud'hon, plus seascapes by Backhuysen\nand Vernet.  Among the works of modern art were pictures signed\nby Delacroix, Ingres, Decamps, Troyon, Meissonier, Daubigny,\netc., and some wonderful miniature statues in marble or bronze,\nmodeled after antiquity's finest originals, stood on their pedestals\nin the corners of this magnificent museum.  As the Nautilus's\ncommander had predicted, my mind was already starting to fall\ninto that promised state of stunned amazement.\n\n\"Professor,\" this strange man then said, \"you must excuse\nthe informality with which I receive you, and the disorder reigning\nin this lounge.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" I replied, \"without prying into who you are, might I venture\nto identify you as an artist?\"\n\n\"A collector, sir, nothing more.  Formerly I loved acquiring\nthese beautiful works created by the hand of man.\nI sought them greedily, ferreted them out tirelessly,\nand I've been able to gather some objects of great value.\nThey're my last mementos of those shores that are now dead for me.\nIn my eyes, your modern artists are already as old as the ancients.\nThey've existed for 2,000 or 3,000 years, and I mix them up in my mind.\nThe masters are ageless.\"\n\n\"What about these composers?\"  I said, pointing to sheet music\nby Weber, Rossini, Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, Meyerbeer, H\u00e9rold, Wagner,\nAuber, Gounod, Victor Mass\u00e9, and a number of others scattered\nover a full size piano-organ, which occupied one of the wall panels\nin this lounge.\n\n\"These composers,\" Captain Nemo answered me, \"are the contemporaries\nof Orpheus, because in the annals of the dead, all chronological\ndifferences fade; and I'm dead, professor, quite as dead as those\nfriends of yours sleeping six feet under!\"\n\nCaptain Nemo fell silent and seemed lost in reverie.  I regarded him with\nintense excitement, silently analyzing his strange facial expression.\nLeaning his elbow on the corner of a valuable mosaic table,\nhe no longer saw me, he had forgotten my very presence.\n\nI didn't disturb his meditations but continued to pass in review\nthe curiosities that enriched this lounge.\n\nAfter the works of art, natural rarities predominated.\nThey consisted chiefly of plants, shells, and other exhibits from\nthe ocean that must have been Captain Nemo's own personal finds.\nIn the middle of the lounge, a jet of water, electrically lit,\nfell back into a basin made from a single giant clam.  The delicately\nfestooned rim of this shell, supplied by the biggest mollusk\nin the class Acephala, measured about six meters in circumference;\nso it was even bigger than those fine giant clams given to King Fran\u00e7ois I\nby the Republic of Venice, and which the Church of Saint-Sulpice\nin Paris has made into two gigantic holy-water fonts.\n\nAround this basin, inside elegant glass cases fastened with\ncopper bands, there were classified and labeled the most valuable\nmarine exhibits ever put before the eyes of a naturalist.\nMy professorial glee may easily be imagined.\n\nThe zoophyte branch offered some very unusual specimens from its\ntwo groups, the polyps and the echinoderms.  In the first group:\norgan-pipe coral, gorgonian coral arranged into fan shapes,\nsoft sponges from Syria, isis coral from the Molucca Islands,\nsea-pen coral, wonderful coral of the genus Virgularia from\nthe waters of Norway, various coral of the genus Umbellularia,\nalcyonarian coral, then a whole series of those madrepores that my mentor\nProfessor Milne-Edwards has so shrewdly classified into divisions\nand among which I noted the wonderful genus Flabellina as well as\nthe genus Oculina from R\u00e9union Island, plus a \"Neptune's chariot\"\nfrom the Caribbean Sea--every superb variety of coral, and in short,\nevery species of these unusual polyparies that congregate\nto form entire islands that will one day turn into continents.\nAmong the echinoderms, notable for being covered with spines:\nstarfish, feather stars, sea lilies, free-swimming crinoids,\nbrittle stars, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, etc., represented\na complete collection of the individuals in this group.\n\nAn excitable conchologist would surely have fainted dead away\nbefore other, more numerous glass cases in which were classified\nspecimens from the mollusk branch.  There I saw a collection\nof incalculable value that I haven't time to describe completely.\nAmong these exhibits I'll mention, just for the record:\nan elegant royal hammer shell from the Indian Ocean, whose evenly\nspaced white spots stood out sharply against a base of red and brown;\nan imperial spiny oyster, brightly colored, bristling with thorns,\na specimen rare to European museums, whose value I estimated at\n20,000 francs; a common hammer shell from the seas near Queensland,\nvery hard to come by; exotic cockles from Senegal, fragile white\nbivalve shells that a single breath could pop like a soap bubble;\nseveral varieties of watering-pot shell from Java, a sort of limestone\ntube fringed with leafy folds and much fought over by collectors;\na whole series of top-shell snails--greenish yellow ones fished up\nfrom American seas, others colored reddish brown that patronize\nthe waters off Queensland, the former coming from the Gulf\nof Mexico and notable for their overlapping shells, the latter\nsome sun-carrier shells found in the southernmost seas, finally and\nrarest of all, the magnificent spurred-star shell from New Zealand;\nthen some wonderful peppery-furrow shells; several valuable species\nof cythera clams and venus clams; the trellis wentletrap snail from\nTranquebar on India's eastern shore; a marbled turban snail gleaming\nwith mother-of-pearl; green parrot shells from the seas of China;\nthe virtually unknown cone snail from the genus Coenodullus;\nevery variety of cowry used as money in India and Africa;\na \"glory-of-the-seas,\" the most valuable shell in the East Indies;\nfinally, common periwinkles, delphinula snails, turret snails,\nviolet snails, European cowries, volute snails, olive shells,\nmiter shells, helmet shells, murex snails, whelks, harp shells,\nspiky periwinkles, triton snails, horn shells, spindle shells,\nconch shells, spider conchs, limpets, glass snails, sea butterflies--\nevery kind of delicate, fragile seashell that science has baptized\nwith its most delightful names.\n\nAside and in special compartments, strings of supremely beautiful\npearls were spread out, the electric light flecking them with\nlittle fiery sparks:  pink pearls pulled from saltwater fan\nshells in the Red Sea; green pearls from the rainbow abalone;\nyellow, blue, and black pearls, the unusual handiwork of various\nmollusks from every ocean and of certain mussels from rivers up north;\nin short, several specimens of incalculable worth that had been\noozed by the rarest of shellfish.  Some of these pearls were\nbigger than a pigeon egg; they more than equaled the one that\nthe explorer Tavernier sold the Shah of Persia for 3,000,000 francs,\nand they surpassed that other pearl owned by the Imam of Muscat,\nwhich I had believed to be unrivaled in the entire world.\n\nConsequently, to calculate the value of this collection was,\nI should say, impossible.  Captain Nemo must have spent millions\nin acquiring these different specimens, and I was wondering what\nfinancial resources he tapped to satisfy his collector's fancies,\nwhen these words interrupted me:\n\n\"You're examining my shells, professor?  They're indeed able\nto fascinate a naturalist; but for me they have an added charm,\nsince I've collected every one of them with my own two hands,\nand not a sea on the globe has escaped my investigations.\"\n\n\"I understand, captain, I understand your delight at strolling\nin the midst of this wealth.  You're a man who gathers his\ntreasure in person.  No museum in Europe owns such a collection\nof exhibits from the ocean.  But if I exhaust all my wonderment\non them, I'll have nothing left for the ship that carries them!\nI have absolutely no wish to probe those secrets of yours!\nBut I confess that my curiosity is aroused to the limit by this Nautilus,\nthe motor power it contains, the equipment enabling it to operate,\nthe ultra powerful force that brings it to life.  I see some instruments\nhanging on the walls of this lounge whose purposes are unknown to me.\nMay I learn--\"\n\n\"Professor Aronnax,\" Captain Nemo answered me, \"I've said you'd be free\naboard my vessel, so no part of the Nautilus is off-limits to you.\nYou may inspect it in detail, and I'll be delighted to act\nas your guide.\"\n\n\"I don't know how to thank you, sir, but I won't abuse your good nature.\nI would only ask you about the uses intended for these instruments\nof physical measure--\"\n\n\"Professor, these same instruments are found in my stateroom,\nwhere I'll have the pleasure of explaining their functions to you.\nBut beforehand, come inspect the cabin set aside for you.\nYou need to learn how you'll be lodged aboard the Nautilus.\"\n\nI followed Captain Nemo, who, via one of the doors cut into\nthe lounge's canted corners, led me back down the ship's gangways.\nHe took me to the bow, and there I found not just a cabin but an elegant\nstateroom with a bed, a washstand, and various other furnishings.\n\nI could only thank my host.\n\n\"Your stateroom adjoins mine,\" he told me, opening a door,\n\"and mine leads into that lounge we've just left.\"\n\nI entered the captain's stateroom.  It had an austere,\nalmost monastic appearance.  An iron bedstead, a worktable,\nsome washstand fixtures.  Subdued lighting.  No luxuries.\nJust the bare necessities.\n\nCaptain Nemo showed me to a bench.\n\n\"Kindly be seated,\" he told me.\n\nI sat, and he began speaking as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\n\nEverything through Electricity\n\n\n\n\"SIR,\" CAPTAIN NEMO SAID, showing me the instruments hanging on\nthe walls of his stateroom,\n\n\"these are the devices needed to navigate the Nautilus.  Here, as in\nthe lounge, I always have them before my eyes, and they indicate\nmy position and exact heading in the midst of the ocean.\nYou're familiar with some of them, such as the thermometer,\nwhich gives the temperature inside the Nautilus; the barometer,\nwhich measures the heaviness of the outside air and forecasts changes\nin the weather; the humidistat, which indicates the degree of dryness\nin the atmosphere; the storm glass, whose mixture decomposes to\nforetell the arrival of tempests; the compass, which steers my course;\nthe sextant, which takes the sun's altitude and tells me my latitude;\nchronometers, which allow me to calculate my longitude; and finally,\nspyglasses for both day and night, enabling me to scrutinize every\npoint of the horizon once the Nautilus has risen to the surface\nof the waves.\"\n\n\"These are the normal navigational instruments,\" I replied,\n\"and I'm familiar with their uses.  But no doubt these others answer\npressing needs unique to the Nautilus.  That dial I see there,\nwith the needle moving across it--isn't it a pressure gauge?\"\n\n\"It is indeed a pressure gauge.  It's placed in contact with the water,\nand it indicates the outside pressure on our hull, which in turn\ngives me the depth at which my submersible is sitting.\"\n\n\"And these are some new breed of sounding line?\"\n\n\"They're thermometric sounding lines that report water temperatures\nin the different strata.\"\n\n\"And these other instruments, whose functions I can't even guess?\"\n\n\"Here, professor, I need to give you some background information,\"\nCaptain Nemo said.  \"So kindly hear me out.\"\n\nHe fell silent for some moments, then he said:\n\n\"There's a powerful, obedient, swift, and effortless force that can\nbe bent to any use and which reigns supreme aboard my vessel.\nIt does everything.  It lights me, it warms me, it's the soul\nof my mechanical equipment.  This force is electricity.\"\n\n\"Electricity!\"  I exclaimed in some surprise.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"But, captain, you have a tremendous speed of movement that doesn't\nsquare with the strength of electricity.  Until now, its dynamic\npotential has remained quite limited, capable of producing only small\namounts of power!\"\n\n\"Professor,\" Captain Nemo replied, \"my electricity isn't\nthe run-of-the-mill variety, and with your permission, I'll leave\nit at that.\"\n\n\"I won't insist, sir, and I'll rest content with simply being\nflabbergasted at your results.  I would ask one question, however,\nwhich you needn't answer if it's indiscreet.  The electric cells you\nuse to generate this marvelous force must be depleted very quickly.\nTheir zinc component, for example:  how do you replace it,\nsince you no longer stay in contact with the shore?\"\n\n\"That question deserves an answer,\" Captain Nemo replied.\n\"First off, I'll mention that at the bottom of the sea there exist veins\nof zinc, iron, silver, and gold whose mining would quite certainly\nbe feasible.  But I've tapped none of these land-based metals,\nand I wanted to make demands only on the sea itself for the sources\nof my electricity.\"\n\n\"The sea itself?\"\n\n\"Yes, professor, and there was no shortage of such sources.\nIn fact, by establishing a circuit between two wires immersed\nto different depths, I'd be able to obtain electricity through\nthe diverging temperatures they experience; but I preferred to use\na more practical procedure.\"\n\n\"And that is?\"\n\n\"You're familiar with the composition of salt water.  In 1,000 grams\none finds 96.5% water and about 2.66% sodium chloride; then small\nquantities of magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium bromide,\nsulfate of magnesia, calcium sulfate, and calcium carbonate.\nHence you observe that sodium chloride is encountered there in\nsignificant proportions.  Now then, it's this sodium that I extract\nfrom salt water and with which I compose my electric cells.\"\n\n\"Sodium?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.  Mixed with mercury, it forms an amalgam that takes\nthe place of zinc in Bunsen cells.  The mercury is never depleted.\nOnly the sodium is consumed, and the sea itself gives me that.\nBeyond this, I'll mention that sodium batteries have been found\nto generate the greater energy, and their electro-motor strength\nis twice that of zinc batteries.\"\n\n\"Captain, I fully understand the excellence of sodium under the conditions\nin which you're placed.  The sea contains it.  Fine.  But it still has\nto be produced, in short, extracted.  And how do you accomplish this?\nObviously your batteries could do the extracting; but if I'm\nnot mistaken, the consumption of sodium needed by your electric\nequipment would be greater than the quantity you'd extract.\nIt would come about, then, that in the process of producing your sodium,\nyou'd use up more than you'd make!\"\n\n\"Accordingly, professor, I don't extract it with batteries;\nquite simply, I utilize the heat of coal from the earth.\"\n\n\"From the earth?\"  I said, my voice going up on the word.\n\n\"We'll say coal from the seafloor, if you prefer,\" Captain Nemo replied.\n\n\"And you can mine these veins of underwater coal?\"\n\n\"You'll watch me work them, Professor Aronnax.  I ask only a little\npatience of you, since you'll have ample time to be patient.\nJust remember one thing:  I owe everything to the ocean;\nit generates electricity, and electricity gives the Nautilus heat,\nlight, motion, and, in a word, life itself.\"\n\n\"But not the air you breathe?\"\n\n\"Oh, I could produce the air needed on board, but it would be pointless,\nsince I can rise to the surface of the sea whenever I like.\nHowever, even though electricity doesn't supply me with breathable air,\nit at least operates the powerful pumps that store it under pressure\nin special tanks; which, if need be, allows me to extend my stay\nin the lower strata for as long as I want.\"\n\n\"Captain,\" I replied, \"I'll rest content with marveling.\nYou've obviously found what all mankind will surely find one day,\nthe true dynamic power of electricity.\"\n\n\"I'm not so certain they'll find it,\" Captain Nemo replied icily.\n\"But be that as it may, you're already familiar with the first use I've\nfound for this valuable force.  It lights us, and with a uniformity\nand continuity not even possessed by sunlight.  Now, look at that clock:\nit's electric, it runs with an accuracy rivaling the finest chronometers.\nI've had it divided into twenty-four hours like Italian clocks,\nsince neither day nor night, sun nor moon, exist for me, but only\nthis artificial light that I import into the depths of the seas!\nSee, right now it's ten o'clock in the morning.\"\n\n\"That's perfect.\"\n\n\"Another use for electricity:  that dial hanging before our eyes\nindicates how fast the Nautilus is going.  An electric wire puts\nit in contact with the patent log; this needle shows me the actual\nspeed of my submersible.  And . . . hold on . . . just now we're\nproceeding at the moderate pace of fifteen miles per hour.\"\n\n\"It's marvelous,\" I replied, \"and I truly see, captain, how right\nyou are to use this force; it's sure to take the place of wind,\nwater, and steam.\"\n\n\"But that's not all, Professor Aronnax,\" Captain Nemo said, standing up.\n\"And if you'd care to follow me, we'll inspect the Nautilus's stern.\"\n\nIn essence, I was already familiar with the whole forward part\nof this underwater boat, and here are its exact subdivisions going\nfrom amidships to its spur:  the dining room, 5 meters long and\nseparated from the library by a watertight bulkhead, in other words,\nit couldn't be penetrated by the sea; the library, 5 meters long;\nthe main lounge, 10 meters long, separated from the captain's\nstateroom by a second watertight bulkhead; the aforesaid stateroom,\n5 meters long; mine, 2.5 meters long; and finally, air tanks 7.5 meters\nlong and extending to the stempost.  Total:  a length of 35 meters.\nDoors were cut into the watertight bulkheads and were shut hermetically\nby means of india-rubber seals, which insured complete safety aboard\nthe Nautilus in the event of a leak in any one section.\n\nI followed Captain Nemo down gangways located for easy transit,\nand I arrived amidships.  There I found a sort of shaft heading upward\nbetween two watertight bulkheads.  An iron ladder, clamped to the wall,\nled to the shaft's upper end.  I asked the captain what this\nladder was for.\n\n\"It goes to the skiff,\" he replied.\n\n\"What!  You have a skiff?\"  I replied in some astonishment.\n\n\"Surely.  An excellent longboat, light and unsinkable, which is used\nfor excursions and fishing trips.\"\n\n\"But when you want to set out, don't you have to return to the surface\nof the sea?\"\n\n\"By no means.  The skiff is attached to the topside of the Nautilus's hull\nand is set in a cavity expressly designed to receive it.  It's completely\ndecked over, absolutely watertight, and held solidly in place by bolts.\nThis ladder leads to a manhole cut into the Nautilus's hull and\ncorresponding to a comparable hole cut into the side of the skiff.\nI insert myself through this double opening into the longboat.\nMy crew close up the hole belonging to the Nautilus; I close up\nthe one belonging to the skiff, simply by screwing it into place.\nI undo the bolts holding the skiff to the submersible, and the\nlongboat rises with prodigious speed to the surface of the sea.\nI then open the deck paneling, carefully closed until that point;\nI up mast and hoist sail--or I take out my oars--and I go for a spin.\"\n\n\"But how do you return to the ship?\"\n\n\"I don't, Professor Aronnax; the Nautilus returns to me.\"\n\n\"At your command?\"\n\n\"At my command.  An electric wire connects me to the ship.\nI fire off a telegram, and that's that.\"\n\n\"Right,\" I said, tipsy from all these wonders, \"nothing to it!\"\n\nAfter passing the well of the companionway that led to the platform,\nI saw a cabin 2 meters long in which Conseil and Ned Land,\nenraptured with their meal, were busy devouring it to the last crumb.\nThen a door opened into the galley, 3 meters long and located\nbetween the vessel's huge storage lockers.\n\nThere, even more powerful and obedient than gas, electricity did\nmost of the cooking.  Arriving under the stoves, wires transmitted\nto platinum griddles a heat that was distributed and sustained\nwith perfect consistency.  It also heated a distilling\nmechanism that, via evaporation, supplied excellent drinking water.\nNext to this galley was a bathroom, conveniently laid out,\nwith faucets supplying hot or cold water at will.\n\nAfter the galley came the crew's quarters, 5 meters long.\nBut the door was closed and I couldn't see its accommodations, which might\nhave told me the number of men it took to operate the Nautilus.\n\nAt the far end stood a fourth watertight bulkhead, separating the crew's\nquarters from the engine room.  A door opened, and I stood in the\ncompartment where Captain Nemo, indisputably a world-class engineer,\nhad set up his locomotive equipment.\n\nBrightly lit, the engine room measured at least 20 meters in length.\nIt was divided, by function, into two parts:  the first contained\nthe cells for generating electricity, the second that mechanism\ntransmitting movement to the propeller.\n\nRight off, I detected an odor permeating the compartment that was\nsui generis.* Captain Nemo noticed the negative impression it\nmade on me.\n\n*Latin: \"in a class by itself.\"  Ed.\n\n\"That,\" he told me, \"is a gaseous discharge caused by our use of sodium,\nbut it's only a mild inconvenience.  In any event, every morning\nwe sanitize the ship by ventilating it in the open air.\"\n\nMeanwhile I examined the Nautilus's engine with a fascination\neasy to imagine.\n\n\"You observe,\" Captain Nemo told me, \"that I use Bunsen cells,\nnot Ruhmkorff cells.  The latter would be ineffectual.  One uses fewer\nBunsen cells, but they're big and strong, and experience has proven\ntheir superiority.  The electricity generated here makes its way to\nthe stern, where electromagnets of huge size activate a special system\nof levers and gears that transmit movement to the propeller's shaft.\nThe latter has a diameter of 6 meters, a pitch of 7.5 meters,\nand can do up to 120 revolutions per minute.\"\n\n\"And that gives you?\"\n\n\"A speed of fifty miles per hour.\"\n\nThere lay a mystery, but I didn't insist on exploring it.\nHow could electricity work with such power?  Where did this\nnearly unlimited energy originate?  Was it in the extraordinary\nvoltage obtained from some new kind of induction coil?\nCould its transmission have been immeasurably increased by some\nunknown system of levers?** This was the point I couldn't grasp.\n\n**Author's Note:  And sure enough, there's now talk of such a discovery,\nin which a new set of levers generates considerable power.\nDid its inventor meet up with Captain Nemo?\n\n\"Captain Nemo,\" I said, \"I'll vouch for the results and not try\nto explain them.  I've seen the Nautilus at work out in front\nof the Abraham Lincoln, and I know where I stand on its speed.\nBut it isn't enough just to move, we have to see where we're going!\nWe must be able to steer right or left, up or down!\nHow do you reach the lower depths, where you meet an increasing\nresistance that's assessed in hundreds of atmospheres?\nHow do you rise back to the surface of the ocean?\nFinally, how do you keep your ship at whatever level suits you?\nAm I indiscreet in asking you all these things?\"\n\n\"Not at all, professor,\" the captain answered me after a\nslight hesitation, \"since you'll never leave this underwater boat.\nCome into the lounge.  It's actually our work room, and there you'll\nlearn the full story about the Nautilus!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\n\nSome Figures\n\n\n\nA MOMENT LATER we were seated on a couch in the lounge, cigars between\nour lips.  The\n\ncaptain placed before my eyes a working drawing that gave the ground plan,\ncross section, and side view of the Nautilus.  Then he began his\ndescription as follows:\n\n\"Here, Professor Aronnax, are the different dimensions of this boat\nnow transporting you.  It's a very long cylinder with conical ends.\nIt noticeably takes the shape of a cigar, a shape already\nadopted in London for several projects of the same kind.\nThe length of this cylinder from end to end is exactly seventy meters,\nand its maximum breadth of beam is eight meters.  So it isn't\nquite built on the ten-to-one ratio of your high-speed steamers;\nbut its lines are sufficiently long, and their tapering gradual enough,\nso that the displaced water easily slips past and poses no obstacle\nto the ship's movements.\n\n\"These two dimensions allow you to obtain, via a simple calculation,\nthe surface area and volume of the Nautilus.  Its surface area\ntotals 1,011.45 square meters, its volume 1,507.2 cubic meters--\nwhich is tantamount to saying that when it's completely submerged,\nit displaces 1,500 cubic meters of water, or weighs 1,500 metric tons.\n\n\"In drawing up plans for a ship meant to navigate underwater,\nI wanted it, when floating on the waves, to lie nine-tenths below\nthe surface and to emerge only one-tenth. Consequently, under these\nconditions it needed to displace only nine-tenths of its volume,\nhence 1,356.48 cubic meters; in other words, it was to weigh only\nthat same number of metric tons.  So I was obliged not to exceed\nthis weight while building it to the aforesaid dimensions.\n\n\"The Nautilus is made up of two hulls, one inside the other;\nbetween them, joining them together, are iron T-bars that give this ship\nthe utmost rigidity.  In fact, thanks to this cellular arrangement,\nit has the resistance of a stone block, as if it were completely solid.\nIts plating can't give way; it's self-adhering and not dependent\non the tightness of its rivets; and due to the perfect union\nof its materials, the solidarity of its construction allows it\nto defy the most violent seas.\n\n\"The two hulls are manufactured from boilerplate steel, whose relative\ndensity is 7.8 times that of water.  The first hull has a thickness\nof no less than five centimeters and weighs 394.96 metric tons.\nMy second hull, the outer cover, includes a keel fifty centimeters high\nby twenty-five wide, which by itself weighs 62 metric tons; this hull,\nthe engine, the ballast, the various accessories and accommodations,\nplus the bulkheads and interior braces, have a combined weight\nof 961.52 metric tons, which when added to 394.96 metric tons,\ngives us the desired total of 1,356.48 metric tons.  Clear?\"\n\n\"Clear,\" I replied.\n\n\"So,\" the captain went on, \"when the Nautilus lies on the waves\nunder these conditions, one-tenth of it does emerge above water.\nNow then, if I provide some ballast tanks equal in capacity\nto that one-tenth, hence able to hold 150.72 metric tons, and if I\nfill them with water, the boat then displaces 1,507.2 metric tons--\nor it weighs that much--and it would be completely submerged.\nThat's what comes about, professor.  These ballast tanks exist\nwithin easy access in the lower reaches of the Nautilus.  I open\nsome stopcocks, the tanks fill, the boat sinks, and it's exactly\nflush with the surface of the water.\"\n\n\"Fine, captain, but now we come to a genuine difficulty.  You're able\nto lie flush with the surface of the ocean, that I understand.\nBut lower down, while diving beneath that surface, isn't your\nsubmersible going to encounter a pressure, and consequently\nundergo an upward thrust, that must be assessed at one atmosphere\nper every thirty feet of water, hence at about one kilogram per\neach square centimeter?\"\n\n\"Precisely, sir.\"\n\n\"Then unless you fill up the whole Nautilus, I don't see how you\ncan force it down into the heart of these liquid masses.\"\n\n\"Professor,\" Captain Nemo replied, \"static objects mustn't be\nconfused with dynamic ones, or we'll be open to serious error.\nComparatively little effort is spent in reaching the ocean's\nlower regions, because all objects have a tendency to become 'sinkers.'\nFollow my logic here.\"\n\n\"I'm all ears, captain.\"\n\n\"When I wanted to determine what increase in weight the Nautilus\nneeded to be given in order to submerge, I had only to take note\nof the proportionate reduction in volume that salt water experiences\nin deeper and deeper strata.\"\n\n\"That's obvious,\" I replied.\n\n\"Now then, if water isn't absolutely incompressible, at least\nit compresses very little.  In fact, according to the most\nrecent calculations, this reduction is only .0000436 per atmosphere,\nor per every thirty feet of depth.  For instance, to go 1,000\nmeters down, I must take into account the reduction in volume\nthat occurs under a pressure equivalent to that from a 1,000-meter\ncolumn of water, in other words, under a pressure of 100 atmospheres.\nIn this instance the reduction would be .00436. Consequently, I'd have\nto increase my weight from 1,507.2 metric tons to 1,513.77. So\nthe added weight would only be 6.57 metric tons.\"\n\n\"That's all?\"\n\n\"That's all, Professor Aronnax, and the calculation is easy to check.\nNow then, I have supplementary ballast tanks capable of shipping 100\nmetric tons of water.  So I can descend to considerable depths.\nWhen I want to rise again and lie flush with the surface, all I\nhave to do is expel that water; and if I desire that the Nautilus\nemerge above the waves to one-tenth of its total capacity, I empty\nall the ballast tanks completely.\"\n\nThis logic, backed up by figures, left me without a single objection.\n\n\"I accept your calculations, captain,\" I replied, \"and I'd be ill-mannered\nto dispute them, since your daily experience bears them out.\nBut at this juncture, I have a hunch that we're still left with\none real difficulty.\"\n\n\"What's that, sir?\"\n\n\"When you're at a depth of 1,000 meters, the Nautilus's plating\nbears a pressure of 100 atmospheres.  If at this point you want\nto empty the supplementary ballast tanks in order to lighten your\nboat and rise to the surface, your pumps must overcome that pressure\nof 100 atmospheres, which is 100 kilograms per each square centimeter.\nThis demands a strength--\"\n\n\"That electricity alone can give me,\" Captain Nemo said swiftly.\n\"Sir, I repeat:  the dynamic power of my engines is nearly infinite.\nThe Nautilus's pumps have prodigious strength, as you must\nhave noticed when their waterspouts swept like a torrent over\nthe Abraham Lincoln.  Besides, I use my supplementary ballast\ntanks only to reach an average depth of 1,500 to 2,000 meters,\nand that with a view to conserving my machinery.  Accordingly, when I\nhave a mind to visit the ocean depths two or three vertical leagues\nbeneath the surface, I use maneuvers that are more time-consuming\nbut no less infallible.\"\n\n\"What are they, captain?\"  I asked.\n\n\"Here I'm naturally led into telling you how the Nautilus is maneuvered.\"\n\n\"I can't wait to find out.\"\n\n\"In order to steer this boat to port or starboard, in short, to make\nturns on a horizontal plane, I use an ordinary, wide-bladed rudder\nthat's fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel\nand tackle.  But I can also move the Nautilus upward and downward\non a vertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins,\nwhich are attached to its sides at its center of flotation;\nthese fins are flexible, able to assume any position, and can be\noperated from inside by means of powerful levers.  If these fins\nstay parallel with the boat, the latter moves horizontally.\nIf they slant, the Nautilus follows the angle of that slant and,\nunder its propeller's thrust, either sinks on a diagonal as steep\nas it suits me, or rises on that diagonal.  And similarly, if I want\nto return more swiftly to the surface, I throw the propeller in gear,\nand the water's pressure makes the Nautilus rise vertically, as an air\nballoon inflated with hydrogen lifts swiftly into the skies.\"\n\n\"Bravo, captain!\"  I exclaimed.  \"But in the midst of the waters,\nhow can your helmsman follow the course you've given him?\"\n\n\"My helmsman is stationed behind the windows of a pilothouse,\nwhich protrudes from the topside of the Nautilus's hull and is fitted\nwith biconvex glass.\"\n\n\"Is glass capable of resisting such pressures?\"\n\n\"Perfectly capable.  Though fragile on impact, crystal can still\noffer considerable resistance.  In 1864, during experiments on\nfishing by electric light in the middle of the North Sea, glass panes\nless than seven millimeters thick were seen to resist a pressure\nof sixteen atmospheres, all the while letting through strong,\nheat-generating rays whose warmth was unevenly distributed.\nNow then, I use glass windows measuring no less than twenty-one\ncentimeters at their centers; in other words, they've thirty\ntimes the thickness.\"\n\n\"Fair enough, captain, but if we're going to see, we need light\nto drive away the dark, and in the midst of the murky waters,\nI wonder how your helmsman can--\"\n\n\"Set astern of the pilothouse is a powerful electric reflector\nwhose rays light up the sea for a distance of half a mile.\"\n\n\"Oh, bravo!  Bravo three times over, captain!  That explains\nthe phosphorescent glow from this so-called narwhale that so puzzled\nus scientists!  Pertinent to this, I'll ask you if the Nautilus's\nrunning afoul of the Scotia, which caused such a great uproar,\nwas the result of an accidental encounter?\"\n\n\"Entirely accidental, sir.  I was navigating two meters beneath\nthe surface of the water when the collision occurred.  However, I could\nsee that it had no dire consequences.\"\n\n\"None, sir.  But as for your encounter with the Abraham Lincoln . . . ?\"\n\n\"Professor, that troubled me, because it's one of the best ships in the\ngallant American navy, but they attacked me and I had to defend myself!\nAll the same, I was content simply to put the frigate in a condition\nwhere it could do me no harm; it won't have any difficulty getting\nrepairs at the nearest port.\"\n\n\"Ah, commander,\" I exclaimed with conviction, \"your Nautilus is truly\na marvelous boat!\"\n\n\"Yes, professor,\" Captain Nemo replied with genuine excitement,\n\"and I love it as if it were my own flesh and blood!  Aboard a\nconventional ship, facing the ocean's perils, danger lurks everywhere;\non the surface of the sea, your chief sensation is the constant feeling\nof an underlying chasm, as the Dutchman Jansen so aptly put it;\nbut below the waves aboard the Nautilus, your heart never fails you!\nThere are no structural deformities to worry about,\nbecause the double hull of this boat has the rigidity of iron;\nno rigging to be worn out by rolling and pitching on the waves;\nno sails for the wind to carry off; no boilers for steam to burst open;\nno fires to fear, because this submersible is made of sheet iron not wood;\nno coal to run out of, since electricity is its mechanical force;\nno collisions to fear, because it navigates the watery deep all by itself;\nno storms to brave, because just a few meters beneath the waves,\nit finds absolute tranquility!  There, sir.  There's the ideal ship!\nAnd if it's true that the engineer has more confidence in a craft\nthan the builder, and the builder more than the captain himself,\nyou can understand the utter abandon with which I place my trust\nin this Nautilus, since I'm its captain, builder, and engineer\nall in one!\"\n\nCaptain Nemo spoke with winning eloquence.  The fire in his eyes\nand the passion in his gestures transfigured him.  Yes, he loved\nhis ship the same way a father loves his child!\n\nBut one question, perhaps indiscreet, naturally popped up, and I\ncouldn't resist asking it.\n\n\"You're an engineer, then, Captain Nemo?\"\n\n\"Yes, professor,\" he answered me.  \"I studied in London, Paris,\nand New York back in the days when I was a resident of\nthe earth's continents.\"\n\n\"But how were you able to build this wonderful Nautilus in secret?\"\n\n\"Each part of it, Professor Aronnax, came from a different spot\non the globe and reached me at a cover address.  Its keel was forged\nby Creusot in France, its propeller shaft by Pen & Co.  in London,\nthe sheet-iron plates for its hull by Laird's in Liverpool, its propeller\nby Scott's in Glasgow.  Its tanks were manufactured by Cail & Co.\nin Paris, its engine by Krupp in Prussia, its spur by the Motala\nworkshops in Sweden, its precision instruments by Hart Bros.\nin New York, etc.; and each of these suppliers received my\nspecifications under a different name.\"\n\n\"But,\" I went on, \"once these parts were manufactured, didn't they\nhave to be mounted and adjusted?\"\n\n\"Professor, I set up my workshops on a deserted islet in midocean.\nThere our Nautilus was completed by me and my workmen, in other words,\nby my gallant companions whom I've molded and educated.\nThen, when the operation was over, we burned every trace of our stay\non that islet, which if I could have, I'd have blown up.\"\n\n\"From all this, may I assume that such a boat costs a fortune?\"\n\n\"An iron ship, Professor Aronnax, runs 1,125 francs per metric ton.\nNow then, the Nautilus has a burden of 1,500 metric tons.\nConsequently, it cost 1,687,000 francs, hence 2,000,000 francs\nincluding its accommodations, and 4,000,000 or 5,000,000 with all\nthe collections and works of art it contains.\"\n\n\"One last question, Captain Nemo.\"\n\n\"Ask, professor.\"\n\n\"You're rich, then?\"\n\n\"Infinitely rich, sir, and without any trouble, I could pay off\nthe ten-billion-franc French national debt!\"\n\nI gaped at the bizarre individual who had just spoken these words.\nWas he playing on my credulity?  Time would tell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\n\nThe Black Current\n\n\n\nTHE PART OF THE planet earth that the seas occupy has been assessed at\n3,832,558 square myriameters, hence more than 38,000,000,000 hectares.\nThis liquid mass totals 2,250,000,000 cubic miles and could form\na sphere with a diameter of sixty leagues, whose weight would\nbe three quintillion metric tons.  To appreciate such a number,\nwe should remember that a quintillion is to a billion what a billion\nis to one, in other words, there are as many billions in a quintillion\nas ones in a billion!  Now then, this liquid mass nearly equals\nthe total amount of water that has poured through all the earth's\nrivers for the past 40,000 years!\n\nDuring prehistoric times, an era of fire was followed by an era of water.\nAt first there was ocean everywhere.  Then, during the Silurian period,\nthe tops of mountains gradually appeared above the waves,\nislands emerged, disappeared beneath temporary floods, rose again,\nwere fused to form continents, and finally the earth's geography\nsettled into what we have today.  Solid matter had wrested from liquid\nmatter some 37,657,000 square miles, hence 12,916,000,000 hectares.\n\nThe outlines of the continents allow the seas to be divided\ninto five major parts:  the frozen Arctic and Antarctic oceans,\nthe Indian Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe Pacific Ocean extends north to south between the two polar circles\nand east to west between America and Asia over an expanse of 145\ndegrees of longitude.  It's the most tranquil of the seas; its currents\nare wide and slow-moving, its tides moderate, its rainfall abundant.\nAnd this was the ocean that I was first destined to cross under\nthese strangest of auspices.\n\n\"If you don't mind, professor,\" Captain Nemo told me, \"we'll determine\nour exact position and fix the starting point of our voyage.\nIt's fifteen minutes before noon.  I'm going to rise to the surface\nof the water.\"\n\nThe captain pressed an electric bell three times.  The pumps began\nto expel water from the ballast tanks; on the pressure gauge,\na needle marked the decreasing pressures that indicated the Nautilus's\nupward progress; then the needle stopped.\n\n\"Here we are,\" the captain said.\n\nI made my way to the central companionway, which led to the platform.\nI climbed its metal steps, passed through the open hatches,\nand arrived topside on the Nautilus.\n\nThe platform emerged only eighty centimeters above the waves.\nThe Nautilus's bow and stern boasted that spindle-shaped outline\nthat had caused the ship to be compared appropriately to a long cigar.\nI noted the slight overlap of its sheet-iron plates, which resembled\nthe scales covering the bodies of our big land reptiles.  So I had\na perfectly natural explanation for why, despite the best spyglasses,\nthis boat had always been mistaken for a marine animal.\n\nNear the middle of the platform, the skiff was half set in the\nship's hull, making a slight bulge.  Fore and aft stood two cupolas\nof moderate height, their sides slanting and partly inset with heavy\nbiconvex glass, one reserved for the helmsman steering the Nautilus,\nthe other for the brilliance of the powerful electric beacon\nlighting his way.\n\nThe sea was magnificent, the skies clear.  This long aquatic\nvehicle could barely feel the broad undulations of the ocean.\nA mild breeze out of the east rippled the surface of the water.\nFree of all mist, the horizon was ideal for taking sights.\n\nThere was nothing to be seen.  Not a reef, not an islet.\nNo more Abraham Lincoln.  A deserted immenseness.\n\nRaising his sextant, Captain Nemo took the altitude of the sun,\nwhich would give him his latitude.  He waited for a few minutes\nuntil the orb touched the rim of the horizon.  While he was taking\nhis sights, he didn't move a muscle, and the instrument couldn't\nhave been steadier in hands made out of marble.\n\n\"Noon,\" he said.  \"Professor, whenever you're ready. . . .\"\n\nI took one last look at the sea, a little yellowish near the landing\nplaces of Japan, and I went below again to the main lounge.\n\nThere the captain fixed his position and used a chronometer\nto calculate his longitude, which he double-checked against his\nprevious observations of hour angles.  Then he told me:\n\n\"Professor Aronnax, we're in longitude 137 degrees 15' west--\"\n\n\"West of which meridian?\"  I asked quickly, hoping the captain's\nreply might give me a clue to his nationality.\n\n\"Sir,\" he answered me, \"I have chronometers variously set to the\nmeridians of Paris, Greenwich, and Washington, D.C. But in your honor,\nI'll use the one for Paris.\"\n\nThis reply told me nothing.  I bowed, and the commander went on:\n\n\"We're in longitude 137 degrees 15' west of the meridian of Paris,\nand latitude 30 degrees 7' north, in other words, about 300 miles\nfrom the shores of Japan.  At noon on this day of November 8,\nwe hereby begin our voyage of exploration under the waters.\"\n\n\"May God be with us!\"  I replied.\n\n\"And now, professor,\" the captain added, \"I'll leave you to your\nintellectual pursuits.  I've set our course east-northeast at a depth\nof fifty meters.  Here are some large-scale charts on which you'll\nbe able to follow that course.  The lounge is at your disposal,\nand with your permission, I'll take my leave.\"\n\nCaptain Nemo bowed.  I was left to myself, lost in my thoughts.\nThey all centered on the Nautilus's commander.  Would I ever learn\nthe nationality of this eccentric man who had boasted of having none?\nHis sworn hate for humanity, a hate that perhaps was bent\non some dreadful revenge--what had provoked it?  Was he one of\nthose unappreciated scholars, one of those geniuses \"embittered\nby the world,\" as Conseil expressed it, a latter-day Galileo,\nor maybe one of those men of science, like America's Commander Maury,\nwhose careers were ruined by political revolutions?  I couldn't say yet.\nAs for me, whom fate had just brought aboard his vessel,\nwhose life he had held in the balance:  he had received me coolly\nbut hospitably.  Only, he never took the hand I extended to him.\nHe never extended his own.\n\nFor an entire hour I was deep in these musings, trying to probe this\nmystery that fascinated me so.  Then my eyes focused on a huge world\nmap displayed on the table, and I put my finger on the very spot\nwhere our just-determined longitude and latitude intersected.\n\nLike the continents, the sea has its rivers.  These are exclusive\ncurrents that can be identified by their temperature and color,\nthe most remarkable being the one called the Gulf Stream.\nScience has defined the global paths of five chief currents:\none in the north Atlantic, a second in the south Atlantic,\na third in the north Pacific, a fourth in the south Pacific,\nand a fifth in the southern Indian Ocean.  Also it's likely\nthat a sixth current used to exist in the northern Indian Ocean,\nwhen the Caspian and Aral Seas joined up with certain large Asian\nlakes to form a single uniform expanse of water.\n\nNow then, at the spot indicated on the world map, one of these seagoing\nrivers was rolling by, the Kuroshio of the Japanese, the Black Current:\nheated by perpendicular rays from the tropical sun, it leaves the Bay\nof Bengal, crosses the Strait of Malacca, goes up the shores of Asia,\nand curves into the north Pacific as far as the Aleutian Islands,\ncarrying along trunks of camphor trees and other local items, the pure\nindigo of its warm waters sharply contrasting with the ocean's waves.\nIt was this current the Nautilus was about to cross.\nI watched it on the map with my eyes, I saw it lose itself in the\nimmenseness of the Pacific, and I felt myself swept along with it,\nwhen Ned Land and Conseil appeared in the lounge doorway.\n\nMy two gallant companions stood petrified at the sight of the\nwonders on display.\n\n\"Where are we?\" the Canadian exclaimed.  \"In the Quebec Museum?\"\n\n\"Begging master's pardon,\" Conseil answered, \"but this seems more\nlike the Sommerard artifacts exhibition!\"\n\n\"My friends,\" I replied, signaling them to enter, \"you're in neither\nCanada nor France, but securely aboard the Nautilus, fifty meters\nbelow sea level.\"\n\n\"If master says so, then so be it,\" Conseil answered.\n\"But in all honesty, this lounge is enough to astonish even someone\nFlemish like myself.\"\n\n\"Indulge your astonishment, my friend, and have a look, because there's\nplenty of work here for a classifier of your talents.\"\n\nConseil needed no encouraging.  Bending over the glass cases,\nthe gallant lad was already muttering choice words from the\nnaturalist's vocabulary:  class Gastropoda, family Buccinoidea,\ngenus cowry, species Cypraea madagascariensis, etc.\n\nMeanwhile Ned Land, less dedicated to conchology, questioned me\nabout my interview with Captain Nemo.  Had I discovered who he was,\nwhere he came from, where he was heading, how deep he was taking us?\nIn short, a thousand questions I had no time to answer.\n\nI told him everything I knew--or, rather, everything I didn't know--\nand I asked him what he had seen or heard on his part.\n\n\"Haven't seen or heard a thing!\" the Canadian replied.\n\"I haven't even spotted the crew of this boat.  By any chance,\ncould they be electric too?\"\n\n\"Electric?\"\n\n\"Oh ye gods, I'm half tempted to believe it!  But back to you,\nProfessor Aronnax,\" Ned Land said, still hanging on to his ideas.\n\"Can't you tell me how many men are on board?  Ten, twenty,\nfifty, a hundred?\"\n\n\"I'm unable to answer you, Mr. Land.  And trust me on this:\nfor the time being, get rid of these notions of taking over\nthe Nautilus or escaping from it.  This boat is a masterpiece\nof modern technology, and I'd be sorry to have missed it!\nMany people would welcome the circumstances that have been handed us,\njust to walk in the midst of these wonders.  So keep calm,\nand let's see what's happening around us.\"\n\n\"See!\" the harpooner exclaimed.  \"There's nothing to see,\nnothing we'll ever see from this sheet-iron prison!  We're simply\nrunning around blindfolded--\"\n\nNed Land was just pronouncing these last words when we were\nsuddenly plunged into darkness, utter darkness.  The ceiling lights\nwent out so quickly, my eyes literally ached, just as if we had\nexperienced the opposite sensation of going from the deepest gloom\nto the brightest sunlight.\n\nWe stood stock-still, not knowing what surprise was waiting for us,\nwhether pleasant or unpleasant.  But a sliding sound became audible.\nYou could tell that some panels were shifting over the Nautilus's sides.\n\n\"It's the beginning of the end!\"  Ned Land said.\n\n\". . . order Hydromedusa,\" Conseil muttered.\n\nSuddenly, through two oblong openings, daylight appeared on both\nsides of the lounge.  The liquid masses came into view, brightly lit\nby the ship's electric outpourings.  We were separated from the sea\nby two panes of glass.  Initially I shuddered at the thought\nthat these fragile partitions could break; but strong copper bands\nsecured them, giving them nearly infinite resistance.\n\nThe sea was clearly visible for a one-mile radius around\nthe Nautilus.  What a sight!  What pen could describe it?\nWho could portray the effects of this light through these translucent\nsheets of water, the subtlety of its progressive shadings into\nthe ocean's upper and lower strata?\n\nThe transparency of salt water has long been recognized.\nIts clarity is believed to exceed that of spring water.\nThe mineral and organic substances it holds in suspension actually\nincrease its translucency.  In certain parts of the Caribbean Sea,\nyou can see the sandy bottom with startling distinctness as deep\nas 145 meters down, and the penetrating power of the sun's\nrays seems to give out only at a depth of 300 meters.\nBut in this fluid setting traveled by the Nautilus, our electric\nglow was being generated in the very heart of the waves.\nIt was no longer illuminated water, it was liquid light.\n\nIf we accept the hypotheses of the microbiologist Ehrenberg--\nwho believes that these underwater depths are lit up by\nphosphorescent organisms--nature has certainly saved one of her\nmost prodigious sights for residents of the sea, and I could\njudge for myself from the thousandfold play of the light.\nOn both sides I had windows opening over these unexplored depths.\nThe darkness in the lounge enhanced the brightness outside, and we\nstared as if this clear glass were the window of an immense aquarium.\n\nThe Nautilus seemed to be standing still.  This was due to the lack\nof landmarks.  But streaks of water, parted by the ship's spur,\nsometimes threaded before our eyes with extraordinary speed.\n\nIn wonderment, we leaned on our elbows before these show windows,\nand our stunned silence remained unbroken until Conseil said:\n\n\"You wanted to see something, Ned my friend; well, now you have\nsomething to see!\"\n\n\"How unusual!\" the Canadian put in, setting aside his tantrums\nand getaway schemes while submitting to this irresistible allure.\n\"A man would go an even greater distance just to stare at such a sight!\"\n\n\"Ah!\"  I exclaimed.  \"I see our captain's way of life!\nHe's found himself a separate world that saves its most astonishing\nwonders just for him!\"\n\n\"But where are the fish?\" the Canadian ventured to observe.\n\"I don't see any fish!\"\n\n\"Why would you care, Ned my friend?\"  Conseil replied.\n\"Since you have no knowledge of them.\"\n\n\"Me?  A fisherman!\"  Ned Land exclaimed.\n\nAnd on this subject a dispute arose between the two friends, since both\nwere knowledgeable about fish, but from totally different standpoints.\n\nEveryone knows that fish make up the fourth and last class in\nthe vertebrate branch.  They have been quite aptly defined as:\n\"cold-blooded vertebrates with a double circulatory system,\nbreathing through gills, and designed to live in water.\"\nThey consist of two distinct series:  the series of bony fish,\nin other words, those whose spines have vertebrae made of bone;\nand cartilaginous fish, in other words, those whose spines have\nvertebrae made of cartilage.\n\nPossibly the Canadian was familiar with this distinction, but Conseil\nknew far more about it; and since he and Ned were now fast friends,\nhe just had to show off.  So he told the harpooner:\n\n\"Ned my friend, you're a slayer of fish, a highly skilled fisherman.\nYou've caught a large number of these fascinating animals.\nBut I'll bet you don't know how they're classified.\"\n\n\"Sure I do,\" the harpooner replied in all seriousness.\n\"They're classified into fish we eat and fish we don't eat!\"\n\n\"Spoken like a true glutton,\" Conseil replied.  \"But tell me,\nare you familiar with the differences between bony fish\nand cartilaginous fish?\"\n\n\"Just maybe, Conseil.\"\n\n\"And how about the subdivisions of these two large classes?\"\n\n\"I haven't the foggiest notion,\" the Canadian replied.\n\n\"All right, listen and learn, Ned my friend!  Bony fish are subdivided\ninto six orders.  Primo, the acanthopterygians, whose upper jaw is fully\nformed and free-moving, and whose gills take the shape of a comb.\nThis order consists of fifteen families, in other words,\nthree-quarters of all known fish.  Example:  the common perch.\"\n\n\"Pretty fair eating,\" Ned Land replied.\n\n\"Secundo,\" Conseil went on, \"the abdominals, whose pelvic fins hang\nunder the abdomen to the rear of the pectorals but aren't attached to\nthe shoulder bone, an order that's divided into five families and makes\nup the great majority of freshwater fish.  Examples:  carp, pike.\"\n\n\"Ugh!\" the Canadian put in with distinct scorn.  \"You can keep\nthe freshwater fish!\"\n\n\"Tertio,\" Conseil said, \"the subbrachians, whose pelvic fins are\nattached under the pectorals and hang directly from the shoulder bone.\nThis order contains four families.  Examples:  flatfish such\nas sole, turbot, dab, plaice, brill, etc.\"\n\n\"Excellent, really excellent!\" the harpooner exclaimed, interested in\nfish only from an edible viewpoint.\n\n\"Quarto,\" Conseil went on, unabashed, \"the apods, with long bodies\nthat lack pelvic fins and are covered by a heavy, often glutinous skin,\nan order consisting of only one family.  Examples:  common eels\nand electric eels.\"\n\n\"So-so, just so-so!\" Ned Land replied.\n\n\"Quinto,\" Conseil said, \"the lophobranchians, which have fully formed,\nfree-moving jaws but whose gills consist of little tufts arranged\nin pairs along their gill arches.  This order includes only\none family.  Examples:  seahorses and dragonfish.\"\n\n\"Bad, very bad!\" the harpooner replied.\n\n\"Sexto and last,\" Conseil said, \"the plectognaths, whose maxillary\nbone is firmly attached to the side of the intermaxillary that forms\nthe jaw, and whose palate arch is locked to the skull by sutures\nthat render the jaw immovable, an order lacking true pelvic fins\nand which consists of two families.  Examples:  puffers and moonfish.\"\n\n\"They're an insult to a frying pan!\" the Canadian exclaimed.\n\n\"Are you grasping all this, Ned my friend?\" asked the scholarly Conseil.\n\n\"Not a lick of it, Conseil my friend,\" the harpooner replied.\n\"But keep going, because you fill me with fascination.\"\n\n\"As for cartilaginous fish,\" Conseil went on unflappably,\n\"they consist of only three orders.\"\n\n\"Good news,\" Ned put in.\n\n\"Primo, the cyclostomes, whose jaws are fused into a flexible\nring and whose gill openings are simply a large number of holes,\nan order consisting of only one family.  Example:  the lamprey.\"\n\n\"An acquired taste,\" Ned Land replied.\n\n\"Secundo, the selacians, with gills resembling those of the cyclostomes\nbut whose lower jaw is free-moving. This order, which is the most\nimportant in the class, consists of two families.  Examples:  the ray\nand the shark.\"\n\n\"What!\"  Ned Land exclaimed.  \"Rays and man-eaters in the same order?\nWell, Conseil my friend, on behalf of the rays, I wouldn't advise\nyou to put them in the same fish tank!\"\n\n\"Tertio,\" Conseil replied, \"The sturionians, whose gill opening is\nthe usual single slit adorned with a gill cover, an order consisting\nof four genera.  Example:  the sturgeon.\"\n\n\"Ah, Conseil my friend, you saved the best for last, in my\nopinion anyhow!  And that's all of 'em?\"\n\n\"Yes, my gallant Ned,\" Conseil replied.  \"And note well, even when one\nhas grasped all this, one still knows next to nothing, because these\nfamilies are subdivided into genera, subgenera, species, varieties--\"\n\n\"All right, Conseil my friend,\" the harpooner said, leaning toward\nthe glass panel, \"here come a couple of your varieties now!\"\n\n\"Yes!  Fish!\"  Conseil exclaimed.  \"One would think he was in front\nof an aquarium!\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied, \"because an aquarium is nothing more than a cage,\nand these fish are as free as birds in the air!\"\n\n\"Well, Conseil my friend, identify them!  Start naming them!\"\nNed Land exclaimed.\n\n\"Me?\"  Conseil replied.  \"I'm unable to!  That's my employer's bailiwick!\"\n\nAnd in truth, although the fine lad was a classifying maniac, he was\nno naturalist, and I doubt that he could tell a bonito from a tuna.\nIn short, he was the exact opposite of the Canadian, who knew nothing\nabout classification but could instantly put a name to any fish.\n\n\"A triggerfish,\" I said.\n\n\"It's a Chinese triggerfish,\" Ned Land replied.\n\n\"Genus Balistes, family Scleroderma, order Plectognatha,\"\nConseil muttered.\n\nAssuredly, Ned and Conseil in combination added up to\none outstanding naturalist.\n\nThe Canadian was not mistaken.  Cavorting around the Nautilus\nwas a school of triggerfish with flat bodies, grainy skins,\narmed with stings on their dorsal fins, and with four prickly\nrows of quills quivering on both sides of their tails.\nNothing could have been more wonderful than the skin covering them:\nwhite underneath, gray above, with spots of gold sparkling in\nthe dark eddies of the waves.  Around them, rays were undulating\nlike sheets flapping in the wind, and among these I spotted,\nmuch to my glee, a Chinese ray, yellowish on its topside, a dainty\npink on its belly, and armed with three stings behind its eyes;\na rare species whose very existence was still doubted in Lac\u00e9p\u010dde's day,\nsince that pioneering classifier of fish had seen one only in a\nportfolio of Japanese drawings.\n\nFor two hours a whole aquatic army escorted the Nautilus.  In the midst\nof their leaping and cavorting, while they competed with each other\nin beauty, radiance, and speed, I could distinguish some green wrasse,\nbewhiskered mullet marked with pairs of black lines, white gobies from\nthe genus Eleotris with curved caudal fins and violet spots on the back,\nwonderful Japanese mackerel from the genus Scomber with blue bodies\nand silver heads, glittering azure goldfish whose name by itself\ngives their full description, several varieties of porgy or gilthead\n(some banded gilthead with fins variously blue and yellow,\nsome with horizontal heraldic bars and enhanced by a black strip\naround their caudal area, some with color zones and elegantly corseted\nin their six waistbands), trumpetfish with flutelike beaks that looked\nlike genuine seafaring woodcocks and were sometimes a meter long,\nJapanese salamanders, serpentine moray eels from the genus Echidna\nthat were six feet long with sharp little eyes and a huge mouth\nbristling with teeth; etc.\n\nOur wonderment stayed at an all-time fever pitch.\nOur exclamations were endless.  Ned identified the fish,\nConseil classified them, and as for me, I was in ecstasy over\nthe verve of their movements and the beauty of their forms.\nNever before had I been given the chance to glimpse these animals\nalive and at large in their native element.\n\nGiven such a complete collection from the seas of Japan and China, I\nwon't mention every variety that passed before our dazzled eyes.\nMore numerous than birds in the air, these fish raced right up to us,\nno doubt attracted by the brilliant glow of our electric beacon.\n\nSuddenly daylight appeared in the lounge.  The sheet-iron panels\nslid shut.  The magical vision disappeared.  But for a good\nwhile I kept dreaming away, until the moment my eyes focused on\nthe instruments hanging on the wall.  The compass still showed our\nheading as east-northeast, the pressure gauge indicated a pressure\nof five atmospheres (corresponding to a depth of fifty meters),\nand the electric log gave our speed as fifteen miles per hour.\n\nI waited for Captain Nemo.  But he didn't appear.  The clock marked\nthe hour of five.\n\nNed Land and Conseil returned to their cabin.  As for me,\nI repaired to my stateroom.  There I found dinner ready for me.\nIt consisted of turtle soup made from the daintiest hawksbill,\na red mullet with white, slightly flaky flesh, whose liver,\nwhen separately prepared, makes delicious eating, plus loin of\nimperial angelfish, whose flavor struck me as even better than salmon.\n\nI spent the evening in reading, writing, and thinking.\nThen drowsiness overtook me, I stretched out on my eelgrass mattress,\nand I fell into a deep slumber, while the Nautilus glided through\nthe swiftly flowing Black Current.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\n\nAn Invitation in Writing\n\n\n\nTHE NEXT DAY, November 9, I woke up only after a long,\ntwelve-hour slumber.  Conseil, a creature of habit, came to\nask \"how master's night went,\" and to offer his services.\nHe had left his Canadian friend sleeping like a man who had never\ndone anything else.\n\nI let the gallant lad babble as he pleased, without giving him\nmuch in the way of a reply.  I was concerned about Captain Nemo's\nabsence during our session the previous afternoon, and I hoped\nto see him again today.\n\nSoon I had put on my clothes, which were woven from strands of\nseashell tissue.  More than once their composition provoked comments\nfrom Conseil.  I informed him that they were made from the smooth,\nsilken filaments with which the fan mussel, a type of seashell quite\nabundant along Mediterranean beaches, attaches itself to rocks.\nIn olden times, fine fabrics, stockings, and gloves were made from\nsuch filaments, because they were both very soft and very warm.\nSo the Nautilus's crew could dress themselves at little cost,\nwithout needing a thing from cotton growers, sheep, or silkworms on shore.\n\nAs soon as I was dressed, I made my way to the main lounge.\nIt was deserted.\n\nI dove into studying the conchological treasures amassed inside\nthe glass cases.  I also investigated the huge plant albums that\nwere filled with the rarest marine herbs, which, although they\nwere pressed and dried, still kept their wonderful colors.\nAmong these valuable water plants, I noted various seaweed:\nsome Cladostephus verticillatus, peacock's tails, fig-leafed caulerpa,\ngrain-bearing beauty bushes, delicate rosetangle tinted scarlet,\nsea colander arranged into fan shapes, mermaid's cups that looked\nlike the caps of squat mushrooms and for years had been classified\namong the zoophytes; in short, a complete series of algae.\n\nThe entire day passed without my being honored by a visit\nfrom Captain Nemo.  The panels in the lounge didn't open.\nPerhaps they didn't want us to get tired of these beautiful things.\n\nThe Nautilus kept to an east-northeasterly heading, a speed of twelve\nmiles per hour, and a depth between fifty and sixty meters.\n\nNext day, November 10:  the same neglect, the same solitude.\nI didn't see a soul from the crew.  Ned and Conseil spent\nthe better part of the day with me.  They were astonished at\nthe captain's inexplicable absence.  Was this eccentric man ill?\nDid he want to change his plans concerning us?\n\nBut after all, as Conseil noted, we enjoyed complete freedom,\nwe were daintily and abundantly fed.  Our host had kept to the terms\nof his agreement.  We couldn't complain, and moreover the very\nuniqueness of our situation had such generous rewards in store for us,\nwe had no grounds for criticism.\n\nThat day I started my diary of these adventures, which has enabled me\nto narrate them with the most scrupulous accuracy; and one odd detail:\nI wrote it on paper manufactured from marine eelgrass.\n\nEarly in the morning on November 11, fresh air poured through\nthe Nautilus's interior, informing me that we had returned\nto the surface of the ocean to renew our oxygen supply.\nI headed for the central companionway and climbed onto the platform.\n\nIt was six o'clock. I found the weather overcast, the sea gray but calm.\nHardly a billow.  I hoped to encounter Captain Nemo there--would he come?\nI saw only the helmsman imprisoned in his glass-windowed pilothouse.\nSeated on the ledge furnished by the hull of the skiff, I inhaled\nthe sea's salty aroma with great pleasure.\n\nLittle by little, the mists were dispersed under the action\nof the sun's rays.  The radiant orb cleared the eastern horizon.\nUnder its gaze, the sea caught on fire like a trail of gunpowder.\nScattered on high, the clouds were colored in bright, wonderfully\nshaded hues, and numerous \"ladyfingers\" warned of daylong winds.*\n\n*Author's Note:  \"Ladyfingers\" are small, thin, white clouds\nwith ragged edges.\n\nBut what were mere winds to this Nautilus, which no storms\ncould intimidate!\n\nSo I was marveling at this delightful sunrise, so life-giving\nand cheerful, when I heard someone climbing onto the platform.\n\nI was prepared to greet Captain Nemo, but it was his chief\nofficer who appeared--whom I had already met during our first\nvisit with the captain.  He advanced over the platform,\nnot seeming to notice my presence.  A powerful spyglass to his eye,\nhe scrutinized every point of the horizon with the utmost care.\nThen, his examination over, he approached the hatch and pronounced\na phrase whose exact wording follows below.  I remember it because,\nevery morning, it was repeated under the same circumstances.\nIt ran like this:\n\n\"Nautron respoc lorni virch.\"\n\nWhat it meant I was unable to say.\n\nThese words pronounced, the chief officer went below again.\nI thought the Nautilus was about to resume its underwater navigating.\nSo I went down the hatch and back through the gangways to my stateroom.\n\nFive days passed in this way with no change in our situation.\nEvery morning I climbed onto the platform.  The same phrase was\npronounced by the same individual.  Captain Nemo did not appear.\n\nI was pursuing the policy that we had seen the last of him,\nwhen on November 16, while reentering my stateroom with Ned\nand Conseil, I found a note addressed to me on the table.\n\nI opened it impatiently.  It was written in a script that was clear\nand neat but a bit \"Old English\" in style, its characters reminding\nme of German calligraphy.\n\nThe note was worded as follows:\n\nProfessor Aronnax\n\nAboard the Nautilus\n\nNovember 16, 1867\n\n\n\nCaptain Nemo invites Professor Aronnax on a hunting trip that\nwill take place tomorrow morning in his Crespo Island forests.\nHe hopes nothing will prevent the professor from attending, and he looks\nforward with pleasure to the professor's companions joining him.\n\n\n\nCAPTAIN NEMO,\n\nCommander of the Nautilus.\n\n\n\n\"A hunting trip!\"  Ned exclaimed.\n\n\"And in his forests on Crespo Island!\"  Conseil added.\n\n\"But does this mean the old boy goes ashore?\"  Ned Land went on.\n\n\"That seems to be the gist of it,\" I said, rereading the letter.\n\n\"Well, we've got to accept!\" the Canadian answered.\n\"Once we're on solid ground, we'll figure out a course of action.\nBesides, it wouldn't pain me to eat a couple slices of fresh venison!\"\n\nWithout trying to reconcile the contradictions between Captain Nemo's\nprofessed horror of continents or islands and his invitation to go\nhunting in a forest, I was content to reply:\n\n\"First let's look into this Crespo Island.\"\n\nI consulted the world map; and in latitude 32 degrees 40'\nnorth and longitude 167 degrees 50' west, I found an islet that had\nbeen discovered in 1801 by Captain Crespo, which old Spanish charts\ncalled Rocca de la Plata, in other words, \"Silver Rock.\"  So we were\nabout 1,800 miles from our starting point, and by a slight change\nof heading, the Nautilus was bringing us back toward the southeast.\n\nI showed my companions this small, stray rock in the middle\nof the north Pacific.\n\n\"If Captain Nemo does sometimes go ashore,\" I told them, \"at least\nhe only picks desert islands!\"\n\nNed Land shook his head without replying; then he and Conseil left me.\nAfter supper was served me by the mute and emotionless steward,\nI fell asleep; but not without some anxieties.\n\nWhen I woke up the next day, November 17, I sensed that the Nautilus\nwas completely motionless.  I dressed hurriedly and entered\nthe main lounge.\n\nCaptain Nemo was there waiting for me.  He stood up, bowed, and asked\nif it suited me to come along.\n\nSince he made no allusion to his absence the past eight days,\nI also refrained from mentioning it, and I simply answered that my\ncompanions and I were ready to go with him.\n\n\"Only, sir,\" I added, \"I'll take the liberty of addressing\na question to you.\"\n\n\"Address away, Professor Aronnax, and if I'm able to answer, I will.\"\n\n\"Well then, captain, how is it that you've severed all ties with\nthe shore, yet you own forests on Crespo Island?\"\n\n\"Professor,\" the captain answered me, \"these forests of mine\ndon't bask in the heat and light of the sun.  They aren't\nfrequented by lions, tigers, panthers, or other quadrupeds.\nThey're known only to me.  They grow only for me.  These forests\naren't on land, they're actual underwater forests.\"\n\n\"Underwater forests!\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, professor.\"\n\n\"And you're offering to take me to them?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"On foot?\"\n\n\"Without getting your feet wet.\"\n\n\"While hunting?\"\n\n\"While hunting.\"\n\n\"Rifles in hand?\"\n\n\"Rifles in hand.\"\n\nI stared at the Nautilus's commander with an air anything but\nflattering to the man.\n\n\"Assuredly,\" I said to myself, \"he's contracted some mental illness.\nHe's had a fit that's lasted eight days and isn't over even yet.\nWhat a shame!  I liked him better eccentric than insane!\"\n\nThese thoughts were clearly readable on my face; but Captain Nemo\nremained content with inviting me to follow him, and I did so like\na man resigned to the worst.\n\nWe arrived at the dining room, where we found breakfast served.\n\n\"Professor Aronnax,\" the captain told me, \"I beg you to share\nmy breakfast without formality.  We can chat while we eat.\nBecause, although I promised you a stroll in my forests, I made\nno pledge to arrange for your encountering a restaurant there.\nAccordingly, eat your breakfast like a man who'll probably eat\ndinner only when it's extremely late.\"\n\nI did justice to this meal.  It was made up of various fish\nand some slices of sea cucumber, that praiseworthy zoophyte,\nall garnished with such highly appetizing seaweed as the Porphyra\nlaciniata and the Laurencia primafetida.  Our beverage consisted\nof clear water to which, following the captain's example, I added\nsome drops of a fermented liquor extracted by the Kamchatka process\nfrom the seaweed known by name as Rhodymenia palmata.\n\nAt first Captain Nemo ate without pronouncing a single word.\nThen he told me:\n\n\"Professor, when I proposed that you go hunting in my Crespo forests,\nyou thought I was contradicting myself.  When I informed you that it\nwas an issue of underwater forests, you thought I'd gone insane.\nProfessor, you must never make snap judgments about your fellow man.\"\n\n\"But, captain, believe me--\"\n\n\"Kindly listen to me, and you'll see if you have grounds for accusing\nme of insanity or self-contradiction.\"\n\n\"I'm all attention.\"\n\n\"Professor, you know as well as I do that a man can live underwater\nso long as he carries with him his own supply of breathable air.\nFor underwater work projects, the workman wears a waterproof suit\nwith his head imprisoned in a metal capsule, while he receives air\nfrom above by means of force pumps and flow regulators.\"\n\n\"That's the standard equipment for a diving suit,\" I said.\n\n\"Correct, but under such conditions the man has no freedom.\nHe's attached to a pump that sends him air through an india-rubber hose;\nit's an actual chain that fetters him to the shore, and if we were\nto be bound in this way to the Nautilus, we couldn't go far either.\"\n\n\"Then how do you break free?\"  I asked.\n\n\"We use the Rouquayrol-Denayrouze device, invented by two of your\nfellow countrymen but refined by me for my own special uses,\nthereby enabling you to risk these new physiological conditions\nwithout suffering any organic disorders.  It consists of a tank\nbuilt from heavy sheet iron in which I store air under a pressure\nof fifty atmospheres.  This tank is fastened to the back by means\nof straps, like a soldier's knapsack.  Its top part forms a box\nwhere the air is regulated by a bellows mechanism and can be\nreleased only at its proper tension.  In the Rouquayrol device\nthat has been in general use, two india-rubber hoses leave this\nbox and feed to a kind of tent that imprisons the operator's nose\nand mouth; one hose is for the entrance of air to be inhaled,\nthe other for the exit of air to be exhaled, and the tongue closes\noff the former or the latter depending on the breather's needs.\nBut in my case, since I face considerable pressures at the bottom\nof the sea, I needed to enclose my head in a copper sphere,\nlike those found on standard diving suits, and the two hoses\nfor inhalation and exhalation now feed to that sphere.\"\n\n\"That's perfect, Captain Nemo, but the air you carry must be\nquickly depleted; and once it contains no more than 15% oxygen,\nit becomes unfit for breathing.\"\n\n\"Surely, but as I told you, Professor Aronnax, the Nautilus's\npumps enable me to store air under considerable pressure,\nand given this circumstance, the tank on my diving equipment can\nsupply breathable air for nine or ten hours.\"\n\n\"I've no more objections to raise,\" I replied.  \"I'll only\nask you, captain:  how can you light your way at the bottom\nof the ocean?\"\n\n\"With the Ruhmkorff device, Professor Aronnax.  If the first\nis carried on the back, the second is fastened to the belt.\nIt consists of a Bunsen battery that I activate not with potassium\ndichromate but with sodium.  An induction coil gathers the electricity\ngenerated and directs it to a specially designed lantern.\nIn this lantern one finds a glass spiral that contains only\na residue of carbon dioxide gas.  When the device is operating,\nthis gas becomes luminous and gives off a continuous whitish light.\nThus provided for, I breathe and I see.\"\n\n\"Captain Nemo, to my every objection you give such crushing answers,\nI'm afraid to entertain a single doubt.  However, though I have no\nchoice but to accept both the Rouquayrol and Ruhmkorff devices,\nI'd like to register some reservations about the rifle with which\nyou'll equip me.\"\n\n\"But it isn't a rifle that uses gunpowder,\" the captain replied.\n\n\"Then it's an air gun?\"\n\n\"Surely.  How can I make gunpowder on my ship when I have no saltpeter,\nsulfur, or charcoal?\"\n\n\"Even so,\" I replied, \"to fire underwater in a medium that's 855 times\ndenser than air, you'd have to overcome considerable resistance.\"\n\n\"That doesn't necessarily follow.  There are certain Fulton-style\nguns perfected by the Englishmen Philippe-Coles and Burley,\nthe Frenchman Furcy, and the Italian Landi; they're equipped\nwith a special system of airtight fastenings and can fire\nin underwater conditions.  But I repeat:  having no gunpowder,\nI've replaced it with air at high pressure, which is abundantly\nsupplied me by the Nautilus's pumps.\"\n\n\"But this air must be swiftly depleted.\"\n\n\"Well, in a pinch can't my Rouquayrol tank supply me with more?  All I\nhave to do is draw it from an ad hoc spigot.* Besides, Professor Aronnax,\nyou'll see for yourself that during these underwater hunting trips,\nwe make no great expenditure of either air or bullets.\"\n\n*Latin: a spigot \"just for that purpose.\"  Ed.\n\n\"But it seems to me that in this semidarkness, amid this liquid\nthat's so dense in comparison to the atmosphere, a gunshot couldn't\ncarry far and would prove fatal only with difficulty!\"\n\n\"On the contrary, sir, with this rifle every shot is fatal;\nand as soon as the animal is hit, no matter how lightly, it falls\nas if struck by lightning.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because this rifle doesn't shoot ordinary bullets but little\nglass capsules invented by the Austrian chemist Leniebroek,\nand I have a considerable supply of them.  These glass capsules\nare covered with a strip of steel and weighted with a lead base;\nthey're genuine little Leyden jars charged with high-voltage electricity.\nThey go off at the slightest impact, and the animal, no matter\nhow strong, drops dead.  I might add that these capsules are no\nbigger than number 4 shot, and the chamber of any ordinary rifle\ncould hold ten of them.\"\n\n\"I'll quit debating,\" I replied, getting up from the table.\n\"And all that's left is for me to shoulder my rifle.\nSo where you go, I'll go.\"\n\nCaptain Nemo led me to the Nautilus's stern, and passing\nby Ned and Conseil's cabin, I summoned my two companions,\nwho instantly followed us.\n\nThen we arrived at a cell located within easy access of the engine room;\nin this cell we were to get dressed for our stroll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\n\nStrolling the Plains\n\n\n\nTHIS CELL, properly speaking, was the Nautilus's arsenal and wardrobe.\nHanging from its walls, a dozen diving outfits were waiting for\nanybody who wanted to take a stroll.\n\nAfter seeing these, Ned Land exhibited an obvious distaste for the idea\nof putting one on.\n\n\"But my gallant Ned,\" I told him, \"the forests of Crespo Island\nare simply underwater forests!\"\n\n\"Oh great!\" put in the disappointed harpooner, watching his dreams\nof fresh meat fade away.  \"And you, Professor Aronnax, are you\ngoing to stick yourself inside these clothes?\"\n\n\"It has to be, Mr. Ned.\"\n\n\"Have it your way, sir,\" the harpooner replied, shrugging his shoulders.\n\"But speaking for myself, I'll never get into those things unless\nthey force me!\"\n\n\"No one will force you, Mr. Land,\" Captain Nemo said.\n\n\"And is Conseil going to risk it?\"  Ned asked.\n\n\"Where master goes, I go,\" Conseil replied.\n\nAt the captain's summons, two crewmen came to help us put\non these heavy, waterproof clothes, made from seamless india\nrubber and expressly designed to bear considerable pressures.\nThey were like suits of armor that were both yielding and resistant,\nyou might say.  These clothes consisted of jacket and pants.\nThe pants ended in bulky footwear adorned with heavy lead soles.\nThe fabric of the jacket was reinforced with copper mail that shielded\nthe chest, protected it from the water's pressure, and allowed\nthe lungs to function freely; the sleeves ended in supple gloves\nthat didn't impede hand movements.\n\nThese perfected diving suits, it was easy to see, were a far cry from\nsuch misshapen costumes as the cork breastplates, leather jumpers,\nseagoing tunics, barrel helmets, etc., invented and acclaimed\nin the 18th century.\n\nConseil and I were soon dressed in these diving suits, as were\nCaptain Nemo and one of his companions--a herculean type who must\nhave been prodigiously strong.  All that remained was to encase one's\nhead in its metal sphere.  But before proceeding with this operation,\nI asked the captain for permission to examine the rifles set\naside for us.\n\nOne of the Nautilus's men presented me with a streamlined rifle\nwhose butt was boilerplate steel, hollow inside, and of fairly\nlarge dimensions.  This served as a tank for the compressed air,\nwhich a trigger-operated valve could release into the metal chamber.\nIn a groove where the butt was heaviest, a cartridge clip\nheld some twenty electric bullets that, by means of a spring,\nautomatically took their places in the barrel of the rifle.\nAs soon as one shot had been fired, another was ready to go off.\n\n\n\n\n\"Captain Nemo,\" I said, \"this is an ideal, easy-to-use weapon.\nI ask only to put it to the test.  But how will we reach the bottom\nof the sea?\"\n\n\"Right now, professor, the Nautilus is aground in ten meters of water,\nand we've only to depart.\"\n\n\"But how will we set out?\"\n\n\"You'll see.\"\n\nCaptain Nemo inserted his cranium into its spherical headgear.\nConseil and I did the same, but not without hearing the Canadian\ntoss us a sarcastic \"happy hunting.\"  On top, the suit ended in a\ncollar of threaded copper onto which the metal helmet was screwed.\nThree holes, protected by heavy glass, allowed us to see in any\ndirection with simply a turn of the head inside the sphere.\nPlaced on our backs, the Rouquayrol device went into operation as soon\nas it was in position, and for my part, I could breathe with ease.\n\nThe Ruhmkorff lamp hanging from my belt, my rifle in hand,\nI was ready to go forth.  But in all honesty, while imprisoned\nin these heavy clothes and nailed to the deck by my lead soles,\nit was impossible for me to take a single step.\n\nBut this circumstance had been foreseen, because I felt\nmyself propelled into a little room adjoining the wardrobe.\nTowed in the same way, my companions went with me.  I heard a door\nwith watertight seals close after us, and we were surrounded\nby profound darkness.\n\nAfter some minutes a sharp hissing reached my ears.\nI felt a distinct sensation of cold rising from my feet to my chest.\nApparently a stopcock inside the boat was letting in water\nfrom outside, which overran us and soon filled up the room.\nContrived in the Nautilus's side, a second door then opened.\nWe were lit by a subdued light.  An instant later our feet were\ntreading the bottom of the sea.\n\nAnd now, how can I convey the impressions left on me by this stroll\nunder the waters.  Words are powerless to describe such wonders!\nWhen even the painter's brush can't depict the effects unique to\nthe liquid element, how can the writer's pen hope to reproduce them?\n\nCaptain Nemo walked in front, and his companion followed us a few steps\nto the rear.  Conseil and I stayed next to each other, as if daydreaming\nthat through our metal carapaces, a little polite conversation\nmight still be possible!  Already I no longer felt the bulkiness\nof my clothes, footwear, and air tank, nor the weight of the heavy\nsphere inside which my head was rattling like an almond in its shell.\nOnce immersed in water, all these objects lost a part of their\nweight equal to the weight of the liquid they displaced, and thanks\nto this law of physics discovered by Archimedes, I did just fine.\nI was no longer an inert mass, and I had, comparatively speaking,\ngreat freedom of movement.\n\nLighting up the seafloor even thirty feet beneath the surface\nof the ocean, the sun astonished me with its power.  The solar rays\neasily crossed this aqueous mass and dispersed its dark colors.\nI could easily distinguish objects 100 meters away.  Farther on,\nthe bottom was tinted with fine shades of ultramarine; then, off in\nthe distance, it turned blue and faded in the midst of a hazy darkness.\nTruly, this water surrounding me was just a kind of air,\ndenser than the atmosphere on land but almost as transparent.\nAbove me I could see the calm surface of the ocean.\n\nWe were walking on sand that was fine-grained and smooth,\nnot wrinkled like beach sand, which preserves the impressions\nleft by the waves.  This dazzling carpet was a real mirror,\nthrowing back the sun's rays with startling intensity.  The outcome:\nan immense vista of reflections that penetrated every liquid molecule.\nWill anyone believe me if I assert that at this thirty-foot depth,\nI could see as if it was broad daylight?\n\nFor a quarter of an hour, I trod this blazing sand, which was\nstrewn with tiny crumbs of seashell.  Looming like a long reef,\nthe Nautilus's hull disappeared little by little, but when night fell\nin the midst of the waters, the ship's beacon would surely facilitate\nour return on board, since its rays carried with perfect distinctness.\nThis effect is difficult to understand for anyone who has never\nseen light beams so sharply defined on shore.  There the dust that\nsaturates the air gives such rays the appearance of a luminous fog;\nbut above water as well as underwater, shafts of electric light\nare transmitted with incomparable clarity.\n\nMeanwhile we went ever onward, and these vast plains of sand\nseemed endless.  My hands parted liquid curtains that closed again\nbehind me, and my footprints faded swiftly under the water's pressure.\n\nSoon, scarcely blurred by their distance from us, the forms of some\nobjects took shape before my eyes.  I recognized the lower slopes\nof some magnificent rocks carpeted by the finest zoophyte specimens,\nand right off, I was struck by an effect unique to this medium.\n\nBy then it was ten o'clock in the morning.  The sun's rays hit\nthe surface of the waves at a fairly oblique angle, decomposing by\nrefraction as though passing through a prism; and when this light came\nin contact with flowers, rocks, buds, seashells, and polyps, the edges\nof these objects were shaded with all seven hues of the solar spectrum.\nThis riot of rainbow tints was a wonder, a feast for the eyes:\na genuine kaleidoscope of red, green, yellow, orange, violet, indigo,\nand blue; in short, the whole palette of a color-happy painter!\nIf only I had been able to share with Conseil the intense sensations\nrising in my brain, competing with him in exclamations of wonderment!\nIf only I had known, like Captain Nemo and his companion,\nhow to exchange thoughts by means of prearranged signals!\nSo, for lack of anything better, I talked to myself:  I declaimed\ninside this copper box that topped my head, spending more air\non empty words than was perhaps advisable.\n\nConseil, like me, had stopped before this splendid sight.\nObviously, in the presence of these zoophyte and mollusk specimens,\nthe fine lad was classifying his head off.  Polyps and echinoderms\nabounded on the seafloor:  various isis coral, cornularian coral\nliving in isolation, tufts of virginal genus Oculina formerly\nknown by the name \"white coral,\" prickly fungus coral in the shape\nof mushrooms, sea anemone holding on by their muscular disks,\nproviding a literal flowerbed adorned by jellyfish from the genus\nPorpita wearing collars of azure tentacles, and starfish that spangled\nthe sand, including veinlike feather stars from the genus Asterophyton\nthat were like fine lace embroidered by the hands of water nymphs,\ntheir festoons swaying to the faint undulations caused by our walking.\nIt filled me with real chagrin to crush underfoot the gleaming\nmollusk samples that littered the seafloor by the thousands:\nconcentric comb shells, hammer shells, coquina (seashells that actually\nhop around), top-shell snails, red helmet shells, angel-wing conchs,\nsea hares, and so many other exhibits from this inexhaustible ocean.\nBut we had to keep walking, and we went forward while overhead there\nscudded schools of Portuguese men-of-war that let their ultramarine\ntentacles drift in their wakes, medusas whose milky white or dainty\npink parasols were festooned with azure tassels and shaded us from\nthe sun's rays, plus jellyfish of the species Pelagia panopyra that,\nin the dark, would have strewn our path with phosphorescent glimmers!\n\nAll these wonders I glimpsed in the space of a quarter of a mile,\nbarely pausing, following Captain Nemo whose gestures kept beckoning\nme onward.  Soon the nature of the seafloor changed.  The plains of sand\nwere followed by a bed of that viscous slime Americans call \"ooze,\"\nwhich is composed exclusively of seashells rich in limestone or silica.\nThen we crossed a prairie of algae, open-sea plants that the waters\nhadn't yet torn loose, whose vegetation grew in wild profusion.\nSoft to the foot, these densely textured lawns would have\nrivaled the most luxuriant carpets woven by the hand of man.\nBut while this greenery was sprawling under our steps, it didn't\nneglect us overhead.  The surface of the water was crisscrossed\nby a floating arbor of marine plants belonging to that superabundant\nalgae family that numbers more than 2,000 known species.\nI saw long ribbons of fucus drifting above me, some globular,\nothers tubular:  Laurencia, Cladostephus with the slenderest foliage,\nRhodymenia palmata resembling the fan shapes of cactus.\nI observed that green-colored plants kept closer to the surface\nof the sea, while reds occupied a medium depth, which left\nblacks and browns in charge of designing gardens and flowerbeds\nin the ocean's lower strata.\n\nThese algae are a genuine prodigy of creation, one of the wonders\nof world flora.  This family produces both the biggest and smallest\nvegetables in the world.  Because, just as 40,000 near-invisible\nbuds have been counted in one five-square-millimeter space, so also\nhave fucus plants been gathered that were over 500 meters long!\n\nWe had been gone from the Nautilus for about an hour and a half.\nIt was almost noon.  I spotted this fact in the perpendicularity\nof the sun's rays, which were no longer refracted.  The magic\nof these solar colors disappeared little by little, with emerald\nand sapphire shades vanishing from our surroundings altogether.\nWe walked with steady steps that rang on the seafloor with\nastonishing intensity.  The tiniest sounds were transmitted\nwith a speed to which the ear is unaccustomed on shore.\nIn fact, water is a better conductor of sound than air, and under\nthe waves noises carry four times as fast.\n\nJust then the seafloor began to slope sharply downward.\nThe light took on a uniform hue.  We reached a depth of 100 meters,\nby which point we were undergoing a pressure of ten atmospheres.\nBut my diving clothes were built along such lines that I never\nsuffered from this pressure.  I felt only a certain tightness in\nthe joints of my fingers, and even this discomfort soon disappeared.\nAs for the exhaustion bound to accompany a two-hour stroll\nin such unfamiliar trappings--it was nil.  Helped by the water,\nmy movements were executed with startling ease.\n\nArriving at this 300-foot depth, I still detected the sun's rays,\nbut just barely.  Their intense brilliance had been followed\nby a reddish twilight, a midpoint between day and night.\nBut we could see well enough to find our way, and it still wasn't\nnecessary to activate the Ruhmkorff device.\n\nJust then Captain Nemo stopped.  He waited until I joined him,\nthen he pointed a finger at some dark masses outlined in the shadows\na short distance away.\n\n\"It's the forest of Crespo Island,\" I thought; and I was not mistaken.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\n\nAn Underwater Forest\n\n\n\nWE HAD FINALLY arrived on the outskirts of this forest,\nsurely one of the finest in Captain Nemo's immense domains.\nHe regarded it as his own and had laid the same claim to it that,\nin the first days of the world, the first men had to their forests\non land.  Besides, who else could dispute his ownership of this\nunderwater property?  What other, bolder pioneer would come,\nax in hand, to clear away its dark underbrush?\n\nThis forest was made up of big treelike plants, and when we\nentered beneath their huge arches, my eyes were instantly struck\nby the unique arrangement of their branches--an arrangement that I\nhad never before encountered.\n\nNone of the weeds carpeting the seafloor, none of the branches bristling\nfrom the shrubbery, crept, or leaned, or stretched on a horizontal plane.\nThey all rose right up toward the surface of the ocean.\nEvery filament or ribbon, no matter how thin, stood ramrod straight.\nFucus plants and creepers were growing in stiff perpendicular lines,\ngoverned by the density of the element that generated them.\nAfter I parted them with my hands, these otherwise motionless\nplants would shoot right back to their original positions.\nIt was the regime of verticality.\n\nI soon grew accustomed to this bizarre arrangement, likewise to\nthe comparative darkness surrounding us.  The seafloor in this forest\nwas strewn with sharp chunks of stone that were hard to avoid.\nHere the range of underwater flora seemed pretty comprehensive to me,\nas well as more abundant than it might have been in the arctic\nor tropical zones, where such exhibits are less common.\nBut for a few minutes I kept accidentally confusing the two kingdoms,\nmistaking zoophytes for water plants, animals for vegetables.\nAnd who hasn't made the same blunder?  Flora and fauna are so closely\nassociated in the underwater world!\n\nI observed that all these exhibits from the vegetable kingdom\nwere attached to the seafloor by only the most makeshift methods.\nThey had no roots and didn't care which solid objects\nsecured them, sand, shells, husks, or pebbles; they didn't\nask their hosts for sustenance, just a point of purchase.\nThese plants are entirely self-propagating, and the principle of\ntheir existence lies in the water that sustains and nourishes them.\nIn place of leaves, most of them sprouted blades of unpredictable shape,\nwhich were confined to a narrow gamut of colors consisting only\nof pink, crimson, green, olive, tan, and brown.  There I saw again,\nbut not yet pressed and dried like the Nautilus's specimens,\nsome peacock's tails spread open like fans to stir up a cooling breeze,\nscarlet rosetangle, sea tangle stretching out their young and\nedible shoots, twisting strings of kelp from the genus Nereocystis\nthat bloomed to a height of fifteen meters, bouquets of mermaid's cups\nwhose stems grew wider at the top, and a number of other open-sea plants,\nall without flowers.  \"It's an odd anomaly in this bizarre element!\"\nas one witty naturalist puts it.  \"The animal kingdom blossoms,\nand the vegetable kingdom doesn't!\"\n\nThese various types of shrubbery were as big as trees in the\ntemperate zones; in the damp shade between them, there were clustered\nactual bushes of moving flowers, hedges of zoophytes in which there\ngrew stony coral striped with twisting furrows, yellowish sea anemone\nfrom the genus Caryophylia with translucent tentacles, plus anemone\nwith grassy tufts from the genus Zoantharia; and to complete the illusion,\nminnows flitted from branch to branch like a swarm of hummingbirds,\nwhile there rose underfoot, like a covey of snipe, yellow fish\nfrom the genus Lepisocanthus with bristling jaws and sharp scales,\nflying gurnards, and pinecone fish.\n\nNear one o'clock, Captain Nemo gave the signal to halt.\nSpeaking for myself, I was glad to oblige, and we stretched out\nbeneath an arbor of winged kelp, whose long thin tendrils stood\nup like arrows.\n\nThis short break was a delight.  It lacked only the charm\nof conversation.  But it was impossible to speak, impossible to reply.\nI simply nudged my big copper headpiece against Conseil's headpiece.\nI saw a happy gleam in the gallant lad's eyes, and to communicate\nhis pleasure, he jiggled around inside his carapace in the\nworld's silliest way.\n\nAfter four hours of strolling, I was quite astonished not\nto feel any intense hunger.  What kept my stomach in such a\ngood mood I'm unable to say.  But, in exchange, I experienced\nthat irresistible desire for sleep that comes over every diver.\nAccordingly, my eyes soon closed behind their heavy glass windows\nand I fell into an uncontrollable doze, which until then I had been\nable to fight off only through the movements of our walking.\nCaptain Nemo and his muscular companion were already stretched\nout in this clear crystal, setting us a fine naptime example.\n\nHow long I was sunk in this torpor I cannot estimate; but when I awoke,\nit seemed as if the sun were settling toward the horizon.\nCaptain Nemo was already up, and I had started to stretch my limbs,\nwhen an unexpected apparition brought me sharply to my feet.\n\nA few paces away, a monstrous, meter-high sea spider was\nstaring at me with beady eyes, poised to spring at me.\nAlthough my diving suit was heavy enough to protect me from this\nanimal's bites, I couldn't keep back a shudder of horror.\nJust then Conseil woke up, together with the Nautilus's sailor.\nCaptain Nemo alerted his companion to this hideous crustacean,\nwhich a swing of the rifle butt quickly brought down, and I watched\nthe monster's horrible legs writhing in dreadful convulsions.\n\nThis encounter reminded me that other, more daunting animals must\nbe lurking in these dark reaches, and my diving suit might not be\nadequate protection against their attacks.  Such thoughts hadn't\npreviously crossed my mind, and I was determined to keep on my guard.\nMeanwhile I had assumed this rest period would be the turning point\nin our stroll, but I was mistaken; and instead of heading back\nto the Nautilus, Captain Nemo continued his daring excursion.\n\nThe seafloor kept sinking, and its significantly steeper slope took\nus to greater depths.  It must have been nearly three o'clock when we\nreached a narrow valley gouged between high, vertical walls and\nlocated 150 meters down.  Thanks to the perfection of our equipment,\nwe had thus gone ninety meters below the limit that nature had,\nuntil then, set on man's underwater excursions.\n\nI say 150 meters, although I had no instruments for estimating\nthis distance.  But I knew that the sun's rays, even in\nthe clearest seas, could reach no deeper.  So at precisely\nthis point the darkness became profound.  Not a single object\nwas visible past ten paces.  Consequently, I had begun to grope\nmy way when suddenly I saw the glow of an intense white light.\nCaptain Nemo had just activated his electric device.\nHis companion did likewise.  Conseil and I followed suit.\nBy turning a switch, I established contact between the induction\ncoil and the glass spiral, and the sea, lit up by our four lanterns,\nwas illuminated for a radius of twenty-five meters.\n\nCaptain Nemo continued to plummet into the dark depths of this forest,\nwhose shrubbery grew ever more sparse.  I observed that vegetable\nlife was disappearing more quickly than animal life.  The open-sea\nplants had already left behind the increasingly arid seafloor,\nwhere a prodigious number of animals were still swarming:\nzoophytes, articulates, mollusks, and fish.\n\nWhile we were walking, I thought the lights of our Ruhmkorff devices\nwould automatically attract some inhabitants of these dark strata.\nBut if they did approach us, at least they kept at a distance regrettable\nfrom the hunter's standpoint.  Several times I saw Captain Nemo stop\nand take aim with his rifle; then, after sighting down its barrel\nfor a few seconds, he would straighten up and resume his walk.\n\nFinally, at around four o'clock, this marvelous excursion came to an end.\nA wall of superb rocks stood before us, imposing in its sheer mass:\na pile of gigantic stone blocks, an enormous granite cliffside pitted\nwith dark caves but not offering a single gradient we could climb up.\nThis was the underpinning of Crespo Island.  This was land.\n\nThe captain stopped suddenly.  A gesture from him brought us to a halt,\nand however much I wanted to clear this wall, I had to stop.\nHere ended the domains of Captain Nemo.  He had no desire to pass\nbeyond them.  Farther on lay a part of the globe he would no\nlonger tread underfoot.\n\nOur return journey began.  Captain Nemo resumed the lead\nin our little band, always heading forward without hesitation.\nI noted that we didn't follow the same path in returning to\nthe Nautilus.  This new route, very steep and hence very arduous,\nquickly took us close to the surface of the sea.  But this\nreturn to the upper strata wasn't so sudden that decompression\ntook place too quickly, which could have led to serious organic\ndisorders and given us those internal injuries so fatal to divers.\nWith great promptness, the light reappeared and grew stronger;\nand the refraction of the sun, already low on the horizon, again ringed\nthe edges of various objects with the entire color spectrum.\n\nAt a depth of ten meters, we walked amid a swarm of small fish from\nevery species, more numerous than birds in the air, more agile too;\nbut no aquatic game worthy of a gunshot had yet been offered\nto our eyes.\n\nJust then I saw the captain's weapon spring to his shoulder\nand track a moving object through the bushes.  A shot went off,\nI heard a faint hissing, and an animal dropped a few paces away,\nliterally struck by lightning.\n\nIt was a magnificent sea otter from the genus Enhydra, the only\nexclusively marine quadruped.  One and a half meters long, this otter\nhad to be worth a good high price.  Its coat, chestnut brown above and\nsilver below, would have made one of those wonderful fur pieces so much\nin demand in the Russian and Chinese markets; the fineness and luster\nof its pelt guaranteed that it would go for at least 2,000 francs.\nI was full of wonderment at this unusual mammal, with its circular\nhead adorned by short ears, its round eyes, its white whiskers\nlike those on a cat, its webbed and clawed feet, its bushy tail.\nHunted and trapped by fishermen, this valuable carnivore has become\nextremely rare, and it takes refuge chiefly in the northernmost\nparts of the Pacific, where in all likelihood its species will soon\nbe facing extinction.\n\nCaptain Nemo's companion picked up the animal, loaded it on his shoulder,\nand we took to the trail again.\n\nFor an hour plains of sand unrolled before our steps.\nOften the seafloor rose to within two meters of the surface of the water.\nI could then see our images clearly mirrored on the underside\nof the waves, but reflected upside down:  above us there appeared\nan identical band that duplicated our every movement and gesture;\nin short, a perfect likeness of the quartet near which it walked,\nbut with heads down and feet in the air.\n\nAnother unusual effect.  Heavy clouds passed above us, forming and\nfading swiftly.  But after thinking it over, I realized that these\nso-called clouds were caused simply by the changing densities of\nthe long ground swells, and I even spotted the foaming \"white caps\"\nthat their breaking crests were proliferating over the surface\nof the water.  Lastly, I couldn't help seeing the actual shadows\nof large birds passing over our heads, swiftly skimming the surface\nof the sea.\n\nOn this occasion I witnessed one of the finest gunshots ever to\nthrill the marrow of a hunter.  A large bird with a wide wingspan,\nquite clearly visible, approached and hovered over us.  When it was just a\nfew meters above the waves, Captain Nemo's companion took aim and fired.\nThe animal dropped, electrocuted, and its descent brought it within\nreach of our adroit hunter, who promptly took possession of it.\nIt was an albatross of the finest species, a wonderful specimen\nof these open-sea fowl.\n\nThis incident did not interrupt our walk.  For two hours we were\nsometimes led over plains of sand, sometimes over prairies of seaweed\nthat were quite arduous to cross.  In all honesty, I was dead tired\nby the time I spotted a hazy glow half a mile away, cutting through\nthe darkness of the waters.  It was the Nautilus's beacon.\nWithin twenty minutes we would be on board, and there I could\nbreathe easy again--because my tank's current air supply seemed\nto be quite low in oxygen.  But I was reckoning without an encounter\nthat slightly delayed our arrival.\n\nI was lagging behind some twenty paces when I saw Captain Nemo suddenly\ncome back toward me.  With his powerful hands he sent me buckling\nto the ground, while his companion did the same to Conseil.  At first I\ndidn't know what to make of this sudden assault, but I was reassured\nto observe the captain lying motionless beside me.\n\nI was stretched out on the seafloor directly beneath some bushes of algae,\nwhen I raised my head and spied two enormous masses hurtling by,\nthrowing off phosphorescent glimmers.\n\nMy blood turned cold in my veins!  I saw that we were under threat from\na fearsome pair of sharks.  They were blue sharks, dreadful man-eaters\nwith enormous tails, dull, glassy stares, and phosphorescent matter\noozing from holes around their snouts.  They were like monstrous\nfireflies that could thoroughly pulverize a man in their iron jaws!\nI don't know if Conseil was busy with their classification,\nbut as for me, I looked at their silver bellies, their fearsome\nmouths bristling with teeth, from a viewpoint less than scientific--\nmore as a victim than as a professor of natural history.\n\nLuckily these voracious animals have poor eyesight.  They went\nby without noticing us, grazing us with their brownish fins;\nand miraculously, we escaped a danger greater than encountering\na tiger deep in the jungle.\n\nHalf an hour later, guided by its electric trail, we reached\nthe Nautilus.  The outside door had been left open, and Captain Nemo\nclosed it after we reentered the first cell.  Then he pressed a button.\nI heard pumps operating within the ship, I felt the water lowering\naround me, and in a few moments the cell was completely empty.\nThe inside door opened, and we passed into the wardrobe.\n\nThere our diving suits were removed, not without difficulty;\nand utterly exhausted, faint from lack of food and rest, I repaired\nto my stateroom, full of wonder at this startling excursion on\nthe bottom of the sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\n\nFour Thousand Leagues Under the Pacific\n\n\n\nBY THE NEXT MORNING, November 18, I was fully recovered from my\nexhaustion of the day before, and I climbed onto the platform just\nas the Nautilus's chief officer was pronouncing his daily phrase.\nIt then occurred to me that these words either referred to the state\nof the sea, or that they meant:  \"There's nothing in sight.\"\n\nAnd in truth, the ocean was deserted.  Not a sail on the horizon.\nThe tips of Crespo Island had disappeared during the night.\nThe sea, absorbing every color of the prism except its blue rays,\nreflected the latter in every direction and sported a wonderful\nindigo tint.  The undulating waves regularly took on the appearance\nof watered silk with wide stripes.\n\nI was marveling at this magnificent ocean view when\nCaptain Nemo appeared.  He didn't seem to notice my presence and began\na series of astronomical observations.  Then, his operations finished,\nhe went and leaned his elbows on the beacon housing, his eyes\nstraying over the surface of the ocean.\n\nMeanwhile some twenty of the Nautilus's sailors--all energetic,\nwell-built fellows--climbed onto the platform.  They had come\nto pull up the nets left in our wake during the night.\nThese seamen obviously belonged to different nationalities, although\nindications of European physical traits could be seen in them all.\nIf I'm not mistaken, I recognized some Irishmen, some Frenchmen,\na few Slavs, and a native of either Greece or Crete.  Even so,\nthese men were frugal of speech and used among themselves\nonly that bizarre dialect whose origin I couldn't even guess.\nSo I had to give up any notions of questioning them.\n\nThe nets were hauled on board.  They were a breed of trawl resembling\nthose used off the Normandy coast, huge pouches held half open\nby a floating pole and a chain laced through the lower meshes.\nTrailing in this way from these iron glove makers, the resulting\nreceptacles scoured the ocean floor and collected every marine exhibit\nin their path.  That day they gathered up some unusual specimens\nfrom these fish-filled waterways:  anglerfish whose comical movements\nqualify them for the epithet \"clowns,\" black Commerson anglers equipped\nwith their antennas, undulating triggerfish encircled by little\nred bands, bloated puffers whose venom is extremely insidious,\nsome olive-hued lampreys, snipefish covered with silver scales,\ncutlass fish whose electrocuting power equals that of the electric eel\nand the electric ray, scaly featherbacks with brown crosswise bands,\ngreenish codfish, several varieties of goby, etc.; finally, some fish\nof larger proportions:  a one-meter jack with a prominent head,\nseveral fine bonito from the genus Scomber decked out in the colors\nblue and silver, and three magnificent tuna whose high speeds\ncouldn't save them from our trawl.\n\nI estimate that this cast of the net brought in more than 1,000\npounds of fish.  It was a fine catch but not surprising.\nIn essence, these nets stayed in our wake for several hours,\nincarcerating an entire aquatic world in prisons made of thread.\nSo we were never lacking in provisions of the highest quality,\nwhich the Nautilus's speed and the allure of its electric light\ncould continually replenish.\n\nThese various exhibits from the sea were immediately lowered\ndown the hatch in the direction of the storage lockers, some to be\neaten fresh, others to be preserved.\n\nAfter its fishing was finished and its air supply renewed,\nI thought the Nautilus would resume its underwater excursion,\nand I was getting ready to return to my stateroom, when Captain Nemo\nturned to me and said without further preamble:\n\n\"Look at this ocean, professor!  Doesn't it have the actual\ngift of life?  Doesn't it experience both anger and affection?\nLast evening it went to sleep just as we did, and there it is,\nwaking up after a peaceful night!\"\n\nNo hellos or good mornings for this gent!  You would have thought\nthis eccentric individual was simply continuing a conversation\nwe'd already started!\n\n\"See!\" he went on.  \"It's waking up under the sun's caresses!\nIt's going to relive its daily existence!  What a fascinating\nfield of study lies in watching the play of its organism.\nIt owns a pulse and arteries, it has spasms, and I side with the\nscholarly Commander Maury, who discovered that it has a circulation\nas real as the circulation of blood in animals.\"\n\nI'm sure that Captain Nemo expected no replies from me, and it\nseemed pointless to pitch in with \"Ah yes,\" \"Exactly,\" or \"How\nright you are!\"  Rather, he was simply talking to himself,\nwith long pauses between sentences.  He was meditating out loud.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"the ocean owns a genuine circulation,\nand to start it going, the Creator of All Things has only\nto increase its heat, salt, and microscopic animal life.\nIn essence, heat creates the different densities that lead\nto currents and countercurrents.  Evaporation, which is nil\nin the High Arctic regions and very active in equatorial zones,\nbrings about a constant interchange of tropical and polar waters.\nWhat's more, I've detected those falling and rising currents that make\nup the ocean's true breathing.  I've seen a molecule of salt water\nheat up at the surface, sink into the depths, reach maximum density\nat -2 degrees centigrade, then cool off, grow lighter, and rise again.\nAt the poles you'll see the consequences of this phenomenon,\nand through this law of farseeing nature, you'll understand why\nwater can freeze only at the surface!\"\n\nAs the captain was finishing his sentence, I said to myself:\n\"The pole!  Is this brazen individual claiming he'll take us even\nto that location?\"\n\nMeanwhile the captain fell silent and stared at the element he had\nstudied so thoroughly and unceasingly.  Then, going on:\n\n\"Salts,\" he said, \"fill the sea in considerable quantities, professor,\nand if you removed all its dissolved saline content, you'd create\na mass measuring 4,500,000 cubic leagues, which if it were spread\nall over the globe, would form a layer more than ten meters high.\nAnd don't think that the presence of these salts is due merely\nto some whim of nature.  No. They make ocean water less open to\nevaporation and prevent winds from carrying off excessive amounts\nof steam, which, when condensing, would submerge the temperate zones.\nSalts play a leading role, the role of stabilizer for the general\necology of the globe!\"\n\nCaptain Nemo stopped, straightened up, took a few steps along\nthe platform, and returned to me:\n\n\"As for those billions of tiny animals,\" he went on, \"those infusoria\nthat live by the millions in one droplet of water, 800,000 of which\nare needed to weigh one milligram, their role is no less important.\nThey absorb the marine salts, they assimilate the solid elements\nin the water, and since they create coral and madrepores,\nthey're the true builders of limestone continents!  And so,\nafter they've finished depriving our water drop of its mineral nutrients,\nthe droplet gets lighter, rises to the surface, there absorbs more\nsalts left behind through evaporation, gets heavier, sinks again,\nand brings those tiny animals new elements to absorb.  The outcome:\na double current, rising and falling, constant movement, constant life!\nMore intense than on land, more abundant, more infinite, such life\nblooms in every part of this ocean, an element fatal to man,\nthey say, but vital to myriads of animals--and to me!\"\n\nWhen Captain Nemo spoke in this way, he was transfigured,\nand he filled me with extraordinary excitement.\n\n\"There,\" he added, \"out there lies true existence!  And I can imagine\nthe founding of nautical towns, clusters of underwater households that,\nlike the Nautilus, would return to the surface of the sea to breathe\neach morning, free towns if ever there were, independent cities!\nThen again, who knows whether some tyrant . . .\"\n\nCaptain Nemo finished his sentence with a vehement gesture.\nThen, addressing me directly, as if to drive away an ugly thought:\n\n\"Professor Aronnax,\" he asked me, \"do you know the depth of\nthe ocean floor?\"\n\n\"At least, captain, I know what the major soundings tell us.\"\n\n\"Could you quote them to me, so I can double-check them as\nthe need arises?\"\n\n\"Here,\" I replied, \"are a few of them that stick in my memory.\nIf I'm not mistaken, an average depth of 8,200 meters was found in\nthe north Atlantic, and 2,500 meters in the Mediterranean.  The most\nremarkable soundings were taken in the south Atlantic near the 35th\nparallel, and they gave 12,000 meters, 14,091 meters, and 15,149 meters.\nAll in all, it's estimated that if the sea bottom were made level,\nits average depth would be about seven kilometers.\"\n\n\"Well, professor,\" Captain Nemo replied, \"we'll show you better\nthan that, I hope.  As for the average depth of this part of\nthe Pacific, I'll inform you that it's a mere 4,000 meters.\"\n\nThis said, Captain Nemo headed to the hatch and disappeared down\nthe ladder.  I followed him and went back to the main lounge.\nThe propeller was instantly set in motion, and the log gave our speed\nas twenty miles per hour.\n\nOver the ensuing days and weeks, Captain Nemo was very frugal\nwith his visits.  I saw him only at rare intervals.  His chief\nofficer regularly fixed the positions I found reported on the chart,\nand in such a way that I could exactly plot the Nautilus's course.\n\nConseil and Land spent the long hours with me.  Conseil had told\nhis friend about the wonders of our undersea stroll, and the Canadian\nwas sorry he hadn't gone along.  But I hoped an opportunity would\narise for a visit to the forests of Oceania.\n\nAlmost every day the panels in the lounge were open for some hours,\nand our eyes never tired of probing the mysteries of the underwater world.\n\nThe Nautilus's general heading was southeast, and it stayed at a depth\nbetween 100 and 150 meters.  However, from lord-knows-what whim,\none day it did a diagonal dive by means of its slanting fins,\nreaching strata located 2,000 meters underwater.  The thermometer\nindicated a temperature of 4.25 degrees centigrade, which at this\ndepth seemed to be a temperature common to all latitudes.\n\nOn November 26, at three o'clock in the morning, the Nautilus\ncleared the Tropic of Cancer at longitude 172 degrees.  On the 27th\nit passed in sight of the Hawaiian Islands, where the famous\nCaptain Cook met his death on February 14, 1779.  By then we\nhad fared 4,860 leagues from our starting point.  When I arrived\non the platform that morning, I saw the Island of Hawaii two miles\nto leeward, the largest of the seven islands making up this group.\nI could clearly distinguish the tilled soil on its outskirts,\nthe various mountain chains running parallel with its coastline,\nand its volcanoes, crowned by Mauna Kea, whose elevation is 5,000\nmeters above sea level.  Among other specimens from these waterways,\nour nets brought up some peacock-tailed flabellarian coral,\npolyps flattened into stylish shapes and unique to this part\nof the ocean.\n\nThe Nautilus kept to its southeasterly heading.  On December 1\nit cut the equator at longitude 142 degrees, and on the 4th\nof the same month, after a quick crossing marked by no incident,\nwe raised the Marquesas Islands.  Three miles off, in latitude 8\ndegrees 57' south and longitude 139 degrees 32' west, I spotted\nMartin Point on Nuku Hiva, chief member of this island group\nthat belongs to France.  I could make out only its wooded mountains\non the horizon, because Captain Nemo hated to hug shore.\nThere our nets brought up some fine fish samples:  dolphinfish with\nazure fins, gold tails, and flesh that's unrivaled in the entire world,\nwrasse from the genus Hologymnosus that were nearly denuded\nof scales but exquisite in flavor, knifejaws with bony beaks,\nyellowish albacore that were as tasty as bonito, all fish worth\nclassifying in the ship's pantry.\n\nAfter leaving these delightful islands to the protection of the French\nflag, the Nautilus covered about 2,000 miles from December 4 to the 11th.\nIts navigating was marked by an encounter with an immense school\nof squid, unusual mollusks that are near neighbors of the cuttlefish.\nFrench fishermen give them the name \"cuckoldfish,\" and they\nbelong to the class Cephalopoda, family Dibranchiata,\nconsisting of themselves together with cuttlefish and argonauts.\nThe naturalists of antiquity made a special study of them,\nand these animals furnished many ribald figures of speech for soapbox\norators in the Greek marketplace, as well as excellent dishes\nfor the tables of rich citizens, if we're to believe Athenaeus,\na Greek physician predating Galen.\n\nIt was during the night of December 9-10 that the Nautilus encountered\nthis army of distinctly nocturnal mollusks.  They numbered in\nthe millions.  They were migrating from the temperate zones toward\nzones still warmer, following the itineraries of herring and sardines.\nWe stared at them through our thick glass windows:  they swam backward\nwith tremendous speed, moving by means of their locomotive tubes,\nchasing fish and mollusks, eating the little ones, eaten by the big ones,\nand tossing in indescribable confusion the ten feet that nature\nhas rooted in their heads like a hairpiece of pneumatic snakes.\nDespite its speed, the Nautilus navigated for several hours\nin the midst of this school of animals, and its nets brought up\nan incalculable number, among which I recognized all nine species\nthat Professor Orbigny has classified as native to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nDuring this crossing, the sea continually lavished us\nwith the most marvelous sights.  Its variety was infinite.\nIt changed its setting and decor for the mere pleasure of our eyes,\nand we were called upon not simply to contemplate the works of our\nCreator in the midst of the liquid element, but also to probe\nthe ocean's most daunting mysteries.\n\nDuring the day of December 11, I was busy reading in the main lounge.\nNed Land and Conseil were observing the luminous waters\nthrough the gaping panels.  The Nautilus was motionless.\nIts ballast tanks full, it was sitting at a depth of 1,000 meters\nin a comparatively unpopulated region of the ocean where only larger\nfish put in occasional appearances.\n\nJust then I was studying a delightful book by Jean Mac\u00e9, The Servants\nof the Stomach, and savoring its ingenious teachings, when Conseil\ninterrupted my reading.\n\n\"Would master kindly come here for an instant?\" he said to me\nin an odd voice.\n\n\"What is it, Conseil?\"\n\n\"It's something that master should see.\"\n\nI stood up, went, leaned on my elbows before the window, and I saw it.\n\nIn the broad electric daylight, an enormous black mass, quite motionless,\nhung suspended in the midst of the waters.  I observed it carefully,\ntrying to find out the nature of this gigantic cetacean.\nThen a sudden thought crossed my mind.\n\n\"A ship!\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes,\" the Canadian replied, \"a disabled craft that's\nsinking straight down!\"\n\nNed Land was not mistaken.  We were in the presence of a ship whose\nsevered shrouds still hung from their clasps.  Its hull looked in\ngood condition, and it must have gone under only a few hours before.\nThe stumps of three masts, chopped off two feet above the deck,\nindicated a flooding ship that had been forced to sacrifice its masting.\nBut it had heeled sideways, filling completely, and it was listing\nto port even yet.  A sorry sight, this carcass lost under the waves,\nbut sorrier still was the sight on its deck, where, lashed with ropes\nto prevent their being washed overboard, some human corpses still lay!\nI counted four of them--four men, one still standing at the helm--\nthen a woman, halfway out of a skylight on the afterdeck,\nholding a child in her arms.  This woman was young.\nUnder the brilliant lighting of the Nautilus's rays, I could\nmake out her features, which the water hadn't yet decomposed.\nWith a supreme effort, she had lifted her child above her head,\nand the poor little creature's arms were still twined around its\nmother's neck!  The postures of the four seamen seemed ghastly to me,\ntwisted from convulsive movements, as if making a last effort\nto break loose from the ropes that bound them to their ship.\nAnd the helmsman, standing alone, calmer, his face smooth and serious,\nhis grizzled hair plastered to his brow, his hands clutching the wheel,\nseemed even yet to be guiding his wrecked three-master through\nthe ocean depths!\n\nWhat a scene!  We stood dumbstruck, hearts pounding, before this\nshipwreck caught in the act, as if it had been photographed in its\nfinal moments, so to speak!  And already I could see enormous sharks\nmoving in, eyes ablaze, drawn by the lure of human flesh!\n\nMeanwhile, turning, the Nautilus made a circle around the sinking ship,\nand for an instant I could read the board on its stern:\n\n\n\nThe Florida\n\nSunderland, England\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\n\n\nVanikoro\n\n\n\nTHIS DREADFUL SIGHT was the first of a whole series of maritime\ncatastrophes that the Nautilus would encounter on its run.\nWhen it plied more heavily traveled seas, we often saw wrecked hulls\nrotting in midwater, and farther down, cannons, shells, anchors, chains,\nand a thousand other iron objects rusting away.\n\nMeanwhile, continuously swept along by the Nautilus, where we lived\nin near isolation, we raised the Tuamotu Islands on December 11,\nthat old \"dangerous group\" associated with the French global\nnavigator Commander Bougainville; it stretches from Ducie Island\nto Lazareff Island over an area of 500 leagues from the east-southeast\nto the west-northwest, between latitude 13 degrees 30'\nand 23 degrees 50' south, and between longitude 125 degrees 30'\nand 151 degrees 30' west.  This island group covers a surface area\nof 370 square leagues, and it's made up of some sixty subgroups,\namong which we noted the Gambier group, which is a French protectorate.\nThese islands are coral formations.  Thanks to the work of polyps, a slow\nbut steady upheaval will someday connect these islands to each other.\nLater on, this new island will be fused to its neighboring island groups,\nand a fifth continent will stretch from New Zealand and New Caledonia\nas far as the Marquesas Islands.\n\nThe day I expounded this theory to Captain Nemo, he answered me coldly:\n\n\"The earth doesn't need new continents, but new men!\"\n\nSailors' luck led the Nautilus straight to Reao Island, one of the most\nunusual in this group, which was discovered in 1822 by Captain Bell\naboard the Minerva.  So I was able to study the madreporic process\nthat has created the islands in this ocean.\n\nMadrepores, which one must guard against confusing with precious coral,\nclothe their tissue in a limestone crust, and their variations in\nstructure have led my famous mentor Professor Milne-Edwards to classify\nthem into five divisions.  The tiny microscopic animals that secrete\nthis polypary live by the billions in the depths of their cells.\nTheir limestone deposits build up into rocks, reefs, islets, islands.\nIn some places, they form atolls, a circular ring surrounding\na lagoon or small inner lake that gaps place in contact with\nthe sea.  Elsewhere, they take the shape of barrier reefs,\nsuch as those that exist along the coasts of New Caledonia\nand several of the Tuamotu Islands.  In still other localities,\nsuch as R\u00e9union Island and the island of Mauritius, they build\nfringing reefs, high, straight walls next to which the ocean's\ndepth is considerable.\n\nWhile cruising along only a few cable lengths from the underpinning\nof Reao Island, I marveled at the gigantic piece of work accomplished\nby these microscopic laborers.  These walls were the express\nachievements of madrepores known by the names fire coral,\nfinger coral, star coral, and stony coral.  These polyps grow\nexclusively in the agitated strata at the surface of the sea,\nand so it's in the upper reaches that they begin these substructures,\nwhich sink little by little together with the secreted rubble\nbinding them.  This, at least, is the theory of Mr. Charles Darwin,\nwho thus explains the formation of atolls--a theory superior,\nin my view, to the one that says these madreporic edifices sit\non the summits of mountains or volcanoes submerged a few feet\nbelow sea level.\n\nI could observe these strange walls quite closely:  our sounding lines\nindicated that they dropped perpendicularly for more than 300 meters,\nand our electric beams made the bright limestone positively sparkle.\n\nIn reply to a question Conseil asked me about the growth rate\nof these colossal barriers, I thoroughly amazed him by saying\nthat scientists put it at an eighth of an inch per biennium.\n\n\"Therefore,\" he said to me, \"to build these walls, it took . . . ?\"\n\n\"192,000 years, my gallant Conseil, which significantly extends\nthe biblical Days of Creation.  What's more, the formation of coal--\nin other words, the petrification of forests swallowed by floods--\nand the cooling of basaltic rocks likewise call for a much longer\nperiod of time.  I might add that those 'days' in the Bible\nmust represent whole epochs and not literally the lapse of time\nbetween two sunrises, because according to the Bible itself,\nthe sun doesn't date from the first day of Creation.\"\n\nWhen the Nautilus returned to the surface of the ocean, I could take\nin Reao Island over its whole flat, wooded expanse.  Obviously its\nmadreporic rocks had been made fertile by tornadoes and thunderstorms.\nOne day, carried off by a hurricane from neighboring shores,\nsome seed fell onto these limestone beds, mixing with decomposed\nparticles of fish and marine plants to form vegetable humus.\nPropelled by the waves, a coconut arrived on this new coast.\nIts germ took root.  Its tree grew tall, catching steam off the water.\nA brook was born.  Little by little, vegetation spread.\nTiny animals--worms, insects--rode ashore on tree trunks snatched\nfrom islands to windward.  Turtles came to lay their eggs.\nBirds nested in the young trees.  In this way animal life developed,\nand drawn by the greenery and fertile soil, man appeared.\nAnd that's how these islands were formed, the immense achievement\nof microscopic animals.\n\nNear evening Reao Island melted into the distance, and the Nautilus\nnoticeably changed course.  After touching the Tropic of Capricorn\nat longitude 135 degrees, it headed west-northwest, going back up\nthe whole intertropical zone.  Although the summer sun lavished\nits rays on us, we never suffered from the heat, because thirty\nor forty meters underwater, the temperature didn't go over 10\ndegrees to 12 degrees centigrade.\n\nBy December 15 we had left the alluring Society Islands in the west,\nlikewise elegant Tahiti, queen of the Pacific.  In the morning\nI spotted this island's lofty summits a few miles to leeward.\nIts waters supplied excellent fish for the tables on board:\nmackerel, bonito, albacore, and a few varieties of that sea serpent\nnamed the moray eel.\n\nThe Nautilus had cleared 8,100 miles.  We logged 9,720 miles\nwhen we passed between the Tonga Islands, where crews from\nthe Argo, Port-au-Prince, and Duke of Portland had perished,\nand the island group of Samoa, scene of the slaying of Captain\nde Langle, friend of that long-lost navigator, the Count de\nLa P\u00e9rouse. Then we raised the Fiji Islands, where savages\nslaughtered sailors from the Union, as well as Captain Bureau,\ncommander of the Darling Josephine out of Nantes, France.\n\nExtending over an expanse of 100 leagues north to south, and over 90\nleagues east to west, this island group lies between latitude 2\ndegrees and 6 degrees south, and between longitude 174 degrees and 179\ndegrees west.  It consists of a number of islands, islets, and reefs,\namong which we noted the islands of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, and Kadavu.\n\nIt was the Dutch navigator Tasman who discovered this group in 1643,\nthe same year the Italian physicist Torricelli invented the barometer\nand King Louis XIV ascended the French throne.  I'll let the reader\ndecide which of these deeds was more beneficial to humanity.\nComing later, Captain Cook in 1774, Rear Admiral d'Entrecasteaux in 1793,\nand finally Captain Dumont d'Urville in 1827, untangled the whole\nchaotic geography of this island group.  The Nautilus drew near\nWailea Bay, an unlucky place for England's Captain Dillon, who was\nthe first to shed light on the longstanding mystery surrounding\nthe disappearance of ships under the Count de La P\u00e9rouse.\n\nThis bay, repeatedly dredged, furnished a huge supply of\nexcellent oysters.  As the Roman playwright Seneca recommended,\nwe opened them right at our table, then stuffed ourselves.\nThese mollusks belonged to the species known by name as Ostrea lamellosa,\nwhose members are quite common off Corsica.  This Wailea oysterbank\nmust have been extensive, and for certain, if they hadn't been\ncontrolled by numerous natural checks, these clusters of shellfish\nwould have ended up jam-packing the bay, since as many as 2,000,000\neggs have been counted in a single individual.\n\nAnd if Mr. Ned Land did not repent of his gluttony at our oyster fest,\nit's because oysters are the only dish that never causes indigestion.\nIn fact, it takes no less than sixteen dozen of these headless\nmollusks to supply the 315 grams that satisfy one man's minimum\ndaily requirement for nitrogen.\n\nOn December 25 the Nautilus navigated amid the island group\nof the New Hebrides, which the Portuguese seafarer Queir\u00f3s\ndiscovered in 1606, which Commander Bougainville explored in 1768,\nand to which Captain Cook gave its current name in 1773.\nThis group is chiefly made up of nine large islands and forms a\n120-league strip from the north-northwest to the south-southeast, lying\nbetween latitude 2 degrees and 15 degrees south, and between longitude\n164 degrees and 168 degrees. At the moment of our noon sights,\nwe passed fairly close to the island of Aurou, which looked to me\nlike a mass of green woods crowned by a peak of great height.\n\nThat day it was yuletide, and it struck me that Ned Land badly\nmissed celebrating \"Christmas,\" that genuine family holiday where\nProtestants are such zealots.\n\nI hadn't seen Captain Nemo for over a week, when, on the morning\nof the 27th, he entered the main lounge, as usual acting as if he'd\nbeen gone for just five minutes.  I was busy tracing the Nautilus's\ncourse on the world map.  The captain approached, placed a finger\nover a position on the chart, and pronounced just one word:\n\n\"Vanikoro.\"\n\nThis name was magic!  It was the name of those islets\nwhere vessels under the Count de La P\u00e9rouse had miscarried.\nI straightened suddenly.\n\n\"The Nautilus is bringing us to Vanikoro?\"  I asked.\n\n\"Yes, professor,\" the captain replied.\n\n\"And I'll be able to visit those famous islands where the Compass\nand the Astrolabe came to grief?\"\n\n\"If you like, professor.\"\n\n\"When will we reach Vanikoro?\"\n\n\"We already have, professor.\"\n\nFollowed by Captain Nemo, I climbed onto the platform, and from there\nmy eyes eagerly scanned the horizon.\n\nIn the northeast there emerged two volcanic islands of unequal size,\nsurrounded by a coral reef whose circuit measured forty miles.\nWe were facing the island of Vanikoro proper, to which\nCaptain Dumont d'Urville had given the name \"Island of the Search\";\nwe lay right in front of the little harbor of Vana, located in latitude\n16 degrees 4' south and longitude 164 degrees 32' east.  Its shores\nseemed covered with greenery from its beaches to its summits inland,\ncrowned by Mt.  Kapogo, which is 476 fathoms high.\n\nAfter clearing the outer belt of rocks via a narrow passageway,\nthe Nautilus lay inside the breakers where the sea had a depth of thirty\nto forty fathoms.  Under the green shade of some tropical evergreens,\nI spotted a few savages who looked extremely startled at our approach.\nIn this long, blackish object advancing flush with the water,\ndidn't they see some fearsome cetacean that they were obliged\nto view with distrust?\n\nJust then Captain Nemo asked me what I knew about the shipwreck\nof the Count de La P\u00e9rouse.\n\n\"What everybody knows, captain,\" I answered him.\n\n\"And could you kindly tell me what everybody knows?\" he asked me\nin a gently ironic tone.\n\n\"Very easily.\"\n\nI related to him what the final deeds of Captain Dumont d'Urville\nhad brought to light, deeds described here in this heavily condensed\nsummary of the whole matter.\n\nIn 1785 the Count de La P\u00e9rouse and his subordinate, Captain de Langle,\nwere sent by King Louis XVI of France on a voyage to circumnavigate\nthe globe.  They boarded two sloops of war, the Compass and the Astrolabe,\nwhich were never seen again.\n\nIn 1791, justly concerned about the fate of these two sloops\nof war, the French government fitted out two large cargo boats,\nthe Search and the Hope, which left Brest on September 28 under\norders from Rear Admiral Bruni d'Entrecasteaux. Two months later,\ntestimony from a certain Commander Bowen, aboard the Albemarle,\nalleged that rubble from shipwrecked vessels had been seen\non the coast of New Georgia.  But d'Entrecasteaux was unaware\nof this news--which seemed a bit dubious anyhow--and headed toward\nthe Admiralty Islands, which had been named in a report by one\nCaptain Hunter as the site of the Count de La P\u00e9rouse's shipwreck.\n\nThey looked in vain.  The Hope and the Search passed right\nby Vanikoro without stopping there; and overall, this voyage\nwas plagued by misfortune, ultimately costing the lives of\nRear Admiral d'Entrecasteaux, two of his subordinate officers,\nand several seamen from his crew.\n\nIt was an old hand at the Pacific, the English adventurer\nCaptain Peter Dillon, who was the first to pick up the trail left\nby castaways from the wrecked vessels.  On May 15, 1824, his ship,\nthe St. Patrick, passed by Tikopia Island, one of the New Hebrides.\nThere a native boatman pulled alongside in a dugout canoe and sold\nDillon a silver sword hilt bearing the imprint of characters engraved\nwith a cutting tool known as a burin.  Furthermore, this native\nboatman claimed that during a stay in Vanikoro six years earlier,\nhe had seen two Europeans belonging to ships that had run aground\non the island's reefs many years before.\n\n\n\n\nDillon guessed that the ships at issue were those under the Count de\nLa P\u00e9rouse, ships whose disappearance had shaken the entire world.\nHe tried to reach Vanikoro, where, according to the native boatman,\na good deal of rubble from the shipwreck could still be found,\nbut winds and currents prevented his doing so.\n\nDillon returned to Calcutta.  There he was able to interest\nthe Asiatic Society and the East India Company in his discovery.\nA ship named after the Search was placed at his disposal,\nand he departed on January 23, 1827, accompanied by a French deputy.\n\nThis new Search, after putting in at several stops over the Pacific,\ndropped anchor before Vanikoro on July 7, 1827, in the same harbor\nof Vana where the Nautilus was currently floating.\n\nThere Dillon collected many relics of the shipwreck:\niron utensils, anchors, eyelets from pulleys, swivel guns,\nan eighteen-pound shell, the remains of some astronomical instruments,\na piece of sternrail, and a bronze bell bearing the inscription\n\"Made by Bazin,\" the foundry mark at Brest Arsenal around 1785.\nThere could no longer be any doubt.\n\nFinishing his investigations, Dillon stayed at the site of\nthe casualty until the month of October.  Then he left Vanikoro,\nheaded toward New Zealand, dropped anchor at Calcutta on April 7,\n1828, and returned to France, where he received a very cordial\nwelcome from King Charles X.\n\nBut just then the renowned French explorer Captain Dumont d'Urville,\nunaware of Dillon's activities, had already set sail to search\nelsewhere for the site of the shipwreck.  In essence, a whaling\nvessel had reported that some medals and a Cross of St. Louis\nhad been found in the hands of savages in the Louisiade Islands\nand New Caledonia.\n\nSo Captain Dumont d'Urville had put to sea in command of a vessel\nnamed after the Astrolabe, and just two months after Dillon had\nleft Vanikoro, Dumont d'Urville dropped anchor before Hobart.  There he\nheard about Dillon's findings, and he further learned that a\ncertain James Hobbs, chief officer on the Union out of Calcutta,\nhad put to shore on an island located in latitude 8 degrees 18'\nsouth and longitude 156 degrees 30' east, and had noted the natives\nof those waterways making use of iron bars and red fabrics.\n\nPretty perplexed, Dumont d'Urville didn't know if he should give\ncredence to these reports, which had been carried in some of\nthe less reliable newspapers; nevertheless, he decided to start\non Dillon's trail.\n\nOn February 10, 1828, the new Astrolabe hove before Tikopia Island,\ntook on a guide and interpreter in the person of a deserter who had\nsettled there, plied a course toward Vanikoro, raised it on February 12,\nsailed along its reefs until the 14th, and only on the 20th dropped\nanchor inside its barrier in the harbor of Vana.\n\nOn the 23rd, several officers circled the island and brought back some\nrubble of little importance.  The natives, adopting a system of denial\nand evasion, refused to guide them to the site of the casualty.\nThis rather shady conduct aroused the suspicion that the natives\nhad mistreated the castaways; and in truth, the natives seemed afraid\nthat Dumont d'Urville had come to avenge the Count de La P\u00e9rouse\nand his unfortunate companions.\n\nBut on the 26th, appeased with gifts and seeing that they didn't\nneed to fear any reprisals, the natives led the chief officer,\nMr. Jacquinot, to the site of the shipwreck.\n\nAt this location, in three or four fathoms of water between the Paeu\nand Vana reefs, there lay some anchors, cannons, and ingots\nof iron and lead, all caked with limestone concretions.  A launch\nand whaleboat from the new Astrolabe were steered to this locality,\nand after going to exhausting lengths, their crews managed to dredge\nup an anchor weighing 1,800 pounds, a cast-iron eight-pounder cannon,\na lead ingot, and two copper swivel guns.\n\nQuestioning the natives, Captain Dumont d'Urville also learned that\nafter La P\u00e9rouse's two ships had miscarried on the island's reefs,\nthe count had built a smaller craft, only to go off and miscarry\na second time.  Where?  Nobody knew.\n\nThe commander of the new Astrolabe then had a monument erected under a\ntuft of mangrove, in memory of the famous navigator and his companions.\nIt was a simple quadrangular pyramid, set on a coral base,\nwith no ironwork to tempt the natives' avarice.\n\nThen Dumont d'Urville tried to depart; but his crews were run down from\nthe fevers raging on these unsanitary shores, and quite ill himself,\nhe was unable to weigh anchor until March 17.\n\nMeanwhile, fearing that Dumont d'Urville wasn't abreast of\nDillon's activities, the French government sent a sloop of war\nto Vanikoro, the Bayonnaise under Commander Legoarant de Tromelin,\nwho had been stationed on the American west coast.  Dropping anchor\nbefore Vanikoro a few months after the new Astrolabe's departure,\nthe Bayonnaise didn't find any additional evidence but verified\nthat the savages hadn't disturbed the memorial honoring the Count\nde La P\u00e9rouse.\n\nThis is the substance of the account I gave Captain Nemo.\n\n\"So,\" he said to me, \"the castaways built a third ship on Vanikoro Island,\nand to this day, nobody knows where it went and perished?\"\n\n\"Nobody knows.\"\n\nCaptain Nemo didn't reply but signaled me to follow him to the\nmain lounge.  The Nautilus sank a few meters beneath the waves,\nand the panels opened.\n\nI rushed to the window and saw crusts of coral:  fungus coral,\nsiphonula coral, alcyon coral, sea anemone from the genus Caryophylia,\nplus myriads of charming fish including greenfish, damselfish,\nsweepers, snappers, and squirrelfish; underneath this coral covering\nI detected some rubble the old dredges hadn't been able to tear free--\niron stirrups, anchors, cannons, shells, tackle from a capstan,\na stempost, all objects hailing from the wrecked ships and now\ncarpeted in moving flowers.\n\nAnd as I stared at this desolate wreckage, Captain Nemo told me\nin a solemn voice:\n\n\"Commander La P\u00e9rouse set out on December 7, 1785, with his ships,\nthe Compass and the Astrolabe.  He dropped anchor first at Botany Bay,\nvisited the Tonga Islands and New Caledonia, headed toward\nthe Santa Cruz Islands, and put in at Nomuka, one of the islands\nin the Ha'apai group.  Then his ships arrived at the unknown reefs\nof Vanikoro.  Traveling in the lead, the Compass ran afoul of breakers\non the southerly coast.  The Astrolabe went to its rescue and also\nran aground.  The first ship was destroyed almost immediately.\nThe second, stranded to leeward, held up for some days.\nThe natives gave the castaways a fair enough welcome.\nThe latter took up residence on the island and built a smaller\ncraft with rubble from the two large ones.  A few seamen stayed\nvoluntarily in Vanikoro.  The others, weak and ailing, set sail\nwith the Count de La P\u00e9rouse. They headed to the Solomon Islands,\nand they perished with all hands on the westerly coast of the chief\nisland in that group, between Cape Deception and Cape Satisfaction!\"\n\n\"And how do you know all this?\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"Here's what I found at the very site of that final shipwreck!\"\n\nCaptain Nemo showed me a tin box, stamped with the coat of arms\nof France and all corroded by salt water.  He opened it and I saw\na bundle of papers, yellowed but still legible.\n\nThey were the actual military orders given by France's Minister\nof the Navy to Commander La P\u00e9rouse, with notes along the margin\nin the handwriting of King Louis XVI!\n\n\"Ah, what a splendid death for a seaman!\"  Captain Nemo then said.\n\"A coral grave is a tranquil grave, and may Heaven grant that my\ncompanions and I rest in no other!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\n\n\nThe Torres Strait\n\n\n\nDURING THE NIGHT of December 27-28, the Nautilus left\nthe waterways of Vanikoro behind with extraordinary speed.\nIts heading was southwesterly, and in three days it had cleared the 750\nleagues that separated La P\u00e9rouse's islands from the southeastern\ntip of Papua.\n\nOn January 1, 1868, bright and early, Conseil joined me on the platform.\n\n\"Will master,\" the gallant lad said to me, \"allow me to wish him\na happy new year?\"\n\n\"Good heavens, Conseil, it's just like old times in my office\nat the Botanical Gardens in Paris!  I accept your kind wishes\nand I thank you for them.  Only, I'd like to know what you mean\nby a 'happy year' under the circumstances in which we're placed.\nIs it a year that will bring our imprisonment to an end, or a year\nthat will see this strange voyage continue?\"\n\n\"Ye gods,\" Conseil replied, \"I hardly know what to tell master.\nWe're certainly seeing some unusual things, and for two months\nwe've had no time for boredom.  The latest wonder is always\nthe most astonishing, and if this progression keeps up, I can't\nimagine what its climax will be.  In my opinion, we'll never again\nhave such an opportunity.\"\n\n\"Never, Conseil.\"\n\n\"Besides, Mr. Nemo really lives up to his Latin name, since he couldn't\nbe less in the way if he didn't exist.\"\n\n\"True enough, Conseil.\"\n\n\"Therefore, with all due respect to master, I think a 'happy year'\nwould be a year that lets us see everything--\"\n\n\"Everything, Conseil?  No year could be that long.  But what does\nNed Land think about all this?\"\n\n\"Ned Land's thoughts are exactly the opposite of mine,\"\nConseil replied.  \"He has a practical mind and a demanding stomach.\nHe's tired of staring at fish and eating them day in and day out.\nThis shortage of wine, bread, and meat isn't suitable for an upstanding\nAnglo-Saxon, a man accustomed to beefsteak and unfazed by regular\ndoses of brandy or gin!\"\n\n\"For my part, Conseil, that doesn't bother me in the least,\nand I've adjusted very nicely to the diet on board.\"\n\n\"So have I,\" Conseil replied.  \"Accordingly, I think as much about\nstaying as Mr. Land about making his escape.  Thus, if this new year\nisn't a happy one for me, it will be for him, and vice versa.\nNo matter what happens, one of us will be pleased.  So, in conclusion,\nI wish master to have whatever his heart desires.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Conseil.  Only I must ask you to postpone the question of new\nyear's gifts, and temporarily accept a hearty handshake in their place.\nThat's all I have on me.\"\n\n\"Master has never been more generous,\" Conseil replied.\n\nAnd with that, the gallant lad went away.\n\nBy January 2 we had fared 11,340 miles, hence 5,250 leagues,\nfrom our starting point in the seas of Japan.  Before the Nautilus's\nspur there stretched the dangerous waterways of the Coral Sea,\noff the northeast coast of Australia.  Our boat cruised along a few\nmiles away from that daunting shoal where Captain Cook's ships\nwellnigh miscarried on June 10, 1770.  The craft that Cook was aboard\ncharged into some coral rock, and if his vessel didn't go down,\nit was thanks to the circumstance that a piece of coral broke off\nin the collision and plugged the very hole it had made in the hull.\n\nI would have been deeply interested in visiting this long,\n360-league reef, against which the ever-surging sea broke\nwith the fearsome intensity of thunderclaps.  But just then\nthe Nautilus's slanting fins took us to great depths, and I could\nsee nothing of those high coral walls.  I had to rest content\nwith the various specimens of fish brought up by our nets.\nAmong others I noted some long-finned albacore, a species in the\ngenus Scomber, as big as tuna, bluish on the flanks, and streaked\nwith crosswise stripes that disappear when the animal dies.\nThese fish followed us in schools and supplied our table with very\ndainty flesh.  We also caught a large number of yellow-green gilthead,\nhalf a decimeter long and tasting like dorado, plus some\nflying gurnards, authentic underwater swallows that, on dark nights,\nalternately streak air and water with their phosphorescent glimmers.\nAmong mollusks and zoophytes, I found in our trawl's meshes\nvarious species of alcyonarian coral, sea urchins, hammer shells,\nspurred-star shells, wentletrap snails, horn shells, glass snails.\nThe local flora was represented by fine floating algae:\nsea tangle, and kelp from the genus Macrocystis, saturated with\nthe mucilage their pores perspire, from which I selected a wonderful\nNemastoma geliniaroidea, classifying it with the natural curiosities\nin the museum.\n\nOn January 4, two days after crossing the Coral Sea, we raised the coast\nof Papua.  On this occasion Captain Nemo told me that he intended\nto reach the Indian Ocean via the Torres Strait.  This was the extent\nof his remarks.  Ned saw with pleasure that this course would bring us,\nonce again, closer to European seas.\n\nThe Torres Strait is regarded as no less dangerous for its\nbristling reefs than for the savage inhabitants of its coasts.\nIt separates Queensland from the huge island of Papua,\nalso called New Guinea.\n\nPapua is 400 leagues long by 130 leagues wide, with a surface area of\n40,000 geographic leagues.  It's located between latitude 0 degrees 19'\nand 10 degrees 2' south, and between longitude 128 degrees 23'\nand 146 degrees 15'. At noon, while the chief officer was taking\nthe sun's altitude, I spotted the summits of the Arfak Mountains,\nrising in terraces and ending in sharp peaks.\n\nDiscovered in 1511 by the Portuguese Francisco Serrano, these shores\nwere successively visited by Don Jorge de Meneses in 1526, by Juan\nde Grijalva in 1527, by the Spanish general Alvaro de Saavedra\nin 1528, by Inigo Ortiz in 1545, by the Dutchman Schouten in 1616,\nby Nicolas Sruick in 1753, by Tasman, Dampier, Fumel, Carteret,\nEdwards, Bougainville, Cook, McClure, and Thomas Forrest,\nby Rear Admiral d'Entrecasteaux in 1792, by Louis-Isidore Duperrey\nin 1823, and by Captain Dumont d'Urville in 1827.  \"It's the heartland\nof the blacks who occupy all Malaysia,\" Mr. de Rienzi has said;\nand I hadn't the foggiest inkling that sailors' luck was about\nto bring me face to face with these daunting Andaman aborigines.\n\nSo the Nautilus hove before the entrance to the world's\nmost dangerous strait, a passageway that even the boldest\nnavigators hesitated to clear:  the strait that Luis Vaez de\nTorres faced on returning from the South Seas in Melanesia,\nthe strait in which sloops of war under Captain Dumont d'Urville\nran aground in 1840 and nearly miscarried with all hands.\nAnd even the Nautilus, rising superior to every danger in the sea,\nwas about to become intimate with its coral reefs.\n\nThe Torres Strait is about thirty-four leagues wide, but it's obstructed\nby an incalculable number of islands, islets, breakers, and rocks\nthat make it nearly impossible to navigate.  Consequently, Captain Nemo\ntook every desired precaution in crossing it.  Floating flush\nwith the water, the Nautilus moved ahead at a moderate pace.\nLike a cetacean's tail, its propeller churned the waves slowly.\n\nTaking advantage of this situation, my two companions and I found seats\non the ever-deserted platform.  In front of us stood the pilothouse,\nand unless I'm extremely mistaken, Captain Nemo must have been inside,\nsteering his Nautilus himself.\n\nUnder my eyes I had the excellent charts of the Torres Strait\nthat had been surveyed and drawn up by the hydrographic engineer\nVincendon Dumoulin and Sublieutenant (now Admiral) Coupvent-Desbois, who\nwere part of Dumont d'Urville's general staff during his final\nvoyage to circumnavigate the globe.  These, along with the efforts\nof Captain King, are the best charts for untangling the snarl of this\nnarrow passageway, and I consulted them with scrupulous care.\n\nAround the Nautilus the sea was boiling furiously.  A stream of waves,\nbearing from southeast to northwest at a speed of two and a half\nmiles per hour, broke over heads of coral emerging here and there.\n\n\"That's one rough sea!\"  Ned Land told me.\n\n\"Abominable indeed,\" I replied, \"and hardly suitable for a craft\nlike the Nautilus.\"\n\n\"That damned captain,\" the Canadian went on, \"must really be sure\nof his course, because if these clumps of coral so much as brush us,\nthey'll rip our hull into a thousand pieces!\"\n\nThe situation was indeed dangerous, but as if by magic, the Nautilus\nseemed to glide right down the middle of these rampaging reefs.\nIt didn't follow the exact course of the Zealous and the new Astrolabe,\nwhich had proved so ill-fated for Captain Dumont d'Urville. It went\nmore to the north, hugged the Murray Islands, and returned to the\nsouthwest near Cumberland Passage.  I thought it was about to charge\nwholeheartedly into this opening, but it went up to the northwest,\nthrough a large number of little-known islands and islets,\nand steered toward Tound Island and the Bad Channel.\n\nI was already wondering if Captain Nemo, rash to the point\nof sheer insanity, wanted his ship to tackle the narrows\nwhere Dumont d'Urville's two sloops of war had gone aground,\nwhen he changed direction a second time and cut straight to the west,\nheading toward Gueboroa Island.\n\nBy then it was three o'clock in the afternoon.  The current was slacking\noff, it was almost full tide.  The Nautilus drew near this island,\nwhich I can see to this day with its remarkable fringe of screw pines.\nWe hugged it from less than two miles out.\n\nA sudden jolt threw me down.  The Nautilus had just struck a reef,\nand it remained motionless, listing slightly to port.\n\nWhen I stood up, I saw Captain Nemo and his chief officer on\nthe platform.  They were examining the ship's circumstances,\nexchanging a few words in their incomprehensible dialect.\n\nHere is what those circumstances entailed.  Two miles to starboard lay\nGueboroa Island, its coastline curving north to west like an immense arm.\nTo the south and east, heads of coral were already on display,\nleft uncovered by the ebbing waters.  We had run aground at full tide\nand in one of those seas whose tides are moderate, an inconvenient\nstate of affairs for floating the Nautilus off.  However, the ship\nhadn't suffered in any way, so solidly joined was its hull.\nBut although it could neither sink nor split open, it was in serious\ndanger of being permanently attached to these reefs, and that would\nhave been the finish of Captain Nemo's submersible.\n\nI was mulling this over when the captain approached, cool and calm,\nforever in control of himself, looking neither alarmed nor annoyed.\n\n\"An accident?\"  I said to him.\n\n\"No, an incident,\" he answered me.\n\n\"But an incident,\" I replied, \"that may oblige you to become\na resident again of these shores you avoid!\"\n\nCaptain Nemo gave me an odd look and gestured no.  Which told\nme pretty clearly that nothing would ever force him to set foot\non a land mass again.  Then he said:\n\n\"No, Professor Aronnax, the Nautilus isn't consigned to perdition.\nIt will still carry you through the midst of the ocean's wonders.\nOur voyage is just beginning, and I've no desire to deprive myself\nso soon of the pleasure of your company.\"\n\n\"Even so, Captain Nemo,\" I went on, ignoring his ironic turn of phrase,\n\"the Nautilus has run aground at a moment when the sea is full.\nNow then, the tides aren't strong in the Pacific, and if you can't\nunballast the Nautilus, which seems impossible to me, I don't see\nhow it will float off.\"\n\n\"You're right, professor, the Pacific tides aren't strong,\"\nCaptain Nemo replied.  \"But in the Torres Strait, one still finds\na meter-and-a-half difference in level between high and low seas.\nToday is January 4, and in five days the moon will be full.\nNow then, I'll be quite astonished if that good-natured satellite\ndoesn't sufficiently raise these masses of water and do me a favor\nfor which I'll be forever grateful.\"\n\nThis said, Captain Nemo went below again to the Nautilus's interior,\nfollowed by his chief officer.  As for our craft, it no longer stirred,\nstaying as motionless as if these coral polyps had already walled\nit in with their indestructible cement.\n\n\"Well, sir?\"  Ned Land said to me, coming up after\nthe captain's departure.\n\n\"Well, Ned my friend, we'll serenely wait for the tide on the 9th,\nbecause it seems the moon will have the good nature to float us away!\"\n\n\"As simple as that?\"\n\n\"As simple as that.\"\n\n\"So our captain isn't going to drop his anchors, put his engines\non the chains, and do anything to haul us off?\"\n\n\"Since the tide will be sufficient,\" Conseil replied simply.\n\nThe Canadian stared at Conseil, then he shrugged his shoulders.\nThe seaman in him was talking now.\n\n\"Sir,\" he answered, \"you can trust me when I say this hunk\nof iron will never navigate again, on the seas or under them.\nIt's only fit to be sold for its weight.  So I think it's time\nwe gave Captain Nemo the slip.\"\n\n\"Ned my friend,\" I replied, \"unlike you, I haven't given up on\nour valiant Nautilus, and in four days we'll know where we stand\non these Pacific tides.  Besides, an escape attempt might be\ntimely if we were in sight of the coasts of England or Provence,\nbut in the waterways of Papua it's another story.  And we'll always\nhave that as a last resort if the Nautilus doesn't right itself,\nwhich I'd regard as a real calamity.\"\n\n\"But couldn't we at least get the lay of the land?\"  Ned went on.\n\"Here's an island.  On this island there are trees.\nUnder those trees land animals loaded with cutlets and roast beef,\nwhich I'd be happy to sink my teeth into.\"\n\n\"In this instance our friend Ned is right,\" Conseil said, \"and I side\nwith his views.  Couldn't master persuade his friend Captain Nemo\nto send the three of us ashore, if only so our feet don't lose\nthe knack of treading on the solid parts of our planet?\"\n\n\"I can ask him,\" I replied, \"but he'll refuse.\"\n\n\"Let master take the risk,\" Conseil said, \"and we'll know where we\nstand on the captain's affability.\"\n\nMuch to my surprise, Captain Nemo gave me the permission I asked for,\nand he did so with grace and alacrity, not even exacting my promise\nto return on board.  But fleeing across the New Guinea territories would\nbe extremely dangerous, and I wouldn't have advised Ned Land to try it.\nBetter to be prisoners aboard the Nautilus than to fall into the hands\nof Papuan natives.\n\nThe skiff was put at our disposal for the next morning.\nI hardly needed to ask whether Captain Nemo would be coming along.\nI likewise assumed that no crewmen would be assigned to us,\nthat Ned Land would be in sole charge of piloting the longboat.\nBesides, the shore lay no more than two miles off, and it would\nbe child's play for the Canadian to guide that nimble skiff through\nthose rows of reefs so ill-fated for big ships.\n\nThe next day, January 5, after its deck paneling was opened,\nthe skiff was wrenched from its socket and launched to sea from\nthe top of the platform.  Two men were sufficient for this operation.\nThe oars were inside the longboat and we had only to take our seats.\n\nAt eight o'clock, armed with rifles and axes, we pulled clear\nof the Nautilus.  The sea was fairly calm.  A mild breeze blew\nfrom shore.  In place by the oars, Conseil and I rowed vigorously,\nand Ned steered us into the narrow lanes between the breakers.\nThe skiff handled easily and sped swiftly.\n\nNed Land couldn't conceal his glee.  He was a prisoner escaping\nfrom prison and never dreaming he would need to reenter it.\n\n\"Meat!\" he kept repeating.  \"Now we'll eat red meat!  Actual game!\nA real mess call, by thunder!  I'm not saying fish aren't good for you,\nbut we mustn't overdo 'em, and a slice of fresh venison grilled\nover live coals will be a nice change from our standard fare.\"\n\n\"You glutton,\" Conseil replied, \"you're making my mouth water!\"\n\n\n\n\n\"It remains to be seen,\" I said, \"whether these forests do contain game,\nand if the types of game aren't of such size that they can\nhunt the hunter.\"\n\n\"Fine, Professor Aronnax!\" replied the Canadian, whose teeth seemed\nto be as honed as the edge of an ax.  \"But if there's no other\nquadruped on this island, I'll eat tiger--tiger sirloin.\"\n\n\"Our friend Ned grows disturbing,\" Conseil replied.\n\n\"Whatever it is,\" Ned Land went on, \"any animal having four feet\nwithout feathers, or two feet with feathers, will be greeted by my\nvery own one-gun salute.\"\n\n\"Oh good!\"  I replied.  \"The reckless Mr. Land is at it again!\"\n\n\"Don't worry, Professor Aronnax, just keep rowing!\" the Canadian replied.\n\"I only need twenty-five minutes to serve you one of my\nown special creations.\"\n\nBy 8:30 the Nautilus's skiff had just run gently aground on\na sandy strand, after successfully clearing the ring of coral\nthat surrounds Gueboroa Island.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\n\n\nSome Days Ashore\n\n\n\nSTEPPING ASHORE had an exhilarating effect on me.  Ned Land\ntested the soil with his foot, as if he were laying claim to it.\nYet it had been only two months since we had become, as Captain Nemo\nexpressed it, \"passengers on the Nautilus,\" in other words,\nthe literal prisoners of its commander.\n\nIn a few minutes we were a gunshot away from the coast.  The soil was\nalmost entirely madreporic, but certain dry stream beds were strewn\nwith granite rubble, proving that this island was of primordial origin.\nThe entire horizon was hidden behind a curtain of wonderful forests.\nEnormous trees, sometimes as high as 200 feet, were linked to each\nother by garlands of tropical creepers, genuine natural hammocks\nthat swayed in a mild breeze.  There were mimosas, banyan trees,\nbeefwood, teakwood, hibiscus, screw pines, palm trees, all mingling\nin wild profusion; and beneath the shade of their green canopies,\nat the feet of their gigantic trunks, there grew orchids,\nleguminous plants, and ferns.\n\nMeanwhile, ignoring all these fine specimens of Papuan flora,\nthe Canadian passed up the decorative in favor of the functional.\nHe spotted a coconut palm, beat down some of its fruit, broke them open,\nand we drank their milk and ate their meat with a pleasure that was\na protest against our standard fare on the Nautilus.\n\n\"Excellent!\"  Ned Land said.\n\n\n\n\n\"Exquisite!\"  Conseil replied.\n\n\"And I don't think,\" the Canadian said, \"that your Nemo would object\nto us stashing a cargo of coconuts aboard his vessel?\"\n\n\"I imagine not,\" I replied, \"but he won't want to sample them.\"\n\n\"Too bad for him!\"  Conseil said.\n\n\"And plenty good for us!\"  Ned Land shot back.  \"There'll be\nmore left over!\"\n\n\"A word of caution, Mr. Land,\" I told the harpooner, who was about\nto ravage another coconut palm.  \"Coconuts are admirable things,\nbut before we stuff the skiff with them, it would be wise to find\nout whether this island offers other substances just as useful.\nSome fresh vegetables would be well received in the Nautilus's pantry.\"\n\n\"Master is right,\" Conseil replied, \"and I propose that we set aside\nthree places in our longboat:  one for fruit, another for vegetables,\nand a third for venison, of which I still haven't glimpsed\nthe tiniest specimen.\"\n\n\"Don't give up so easily, Conseil,\" the Canadian replied.\n\n\"So let's continue our excursion,\" I went on, \"but keep a sharp lookout.\nThis island seems uninhabited, but it still might harbor certain\nindividuals who aren't so finicky about the sort of game they eat!\"\n\n\"Hee hee!\"  Ned put in, with a meaningful movement of his jaws.\n\n\"Ned!  Oh horrors!\"  Conseil exclaimed.\n\n\"Ye gods,\" the Canadian shot back, \"I'm starting to appreciate\nthe charms of cannibalism!\"\n\n\"Ned, Ned!  Don't say that!\"  Conseil answered.  \"You a cannibal?\nWhy, I'll no longer be safe next to you, I who share your cabin!\nDoes this mean I'll wake up half devoured one fine day?\"\n\n\"I'm awfully fond of you, Conseil my friend, but not enough to eat\nyou when there's better food around.\"\n\n\"Then I daren't delay,\" Conseil replied.  \"The hunt is on!\nWe absolutely must bag some game to placate this man-eater, or one\nof these mornings master won't find enough pieces of his manservant\nto serve him.\"\n\nWhile exchanging this chitchat, we entered beneath the dark canopies\nof the forest, and for two hours we explored it in every direction.\n\nWe couldn't have been luckier in our search for edible vegetation,\nand some of the most useful produce in the tropical zones supplied\nus with a valuable foodstuff missing on board.\n\nI mean the breadfruit tree, which is quite abundant on Gueboroa Island,\nand there I chiefly noted the seedless variety that in Malaysia\nis called \"rima.\"\n\nThis tree is distinguished from other trees by a straight trunk forty\nfeet high.  To the naturalist's eye, its gracefully rounded crown,\nformed of big multilobed leaves, was enough to denote the artocarpus\nthat has been so successfully transplanted to the Mascarene Islands east of\n\nMadagascar.  From its mass of greenery, huge globular fruit stood out,\na decimeter wide and furnished on the outside with creases that\nassumed a hexangular pattern.  It's a handy plant that nature gives\nto regions lacking in wheat; without needing to be cultivated,\nit bears fruit eight months out of the year.\n\nNed Land was on familiar terms with this fruit.  He had already eaten\nit on his many voyages and knew how to cook its edible substance.\nSo the very sight of it aroused his appetite, and he couldn't\ncontrol himself.\n\n\"Sir,\" he told me, \"I'll die if I don't sample a little breadfruit pasta!\"\n\n\"Sample some, Ned my friend, sample all you like.  We're here\nto conduct experiments, let's conduct them.\"\n\n\"It won't take a minute,\" the Canadian replied.\n\nEquipped with a magnifying glass, he lit a fire of deadwood\nthat was soon crackling merrily.  Meanwhile Conseil and I selected\nthe finest artocarpus fruit.  Some still weren't ripe enough,\nand their thick skins covered white, slightly fibrous pulps.\nBut a great many others were yellowish and gelatinous, just begging\nto be picked.\n\nThis fruit contained no pits.  Conseil brought a dozen of them\nto Ned Land, who cut them into thick slices and placed them over\na fire of live coals, all the while repeating:\n\n\"You'll see, sir, how tasty this bread is!\"\n\n\"Especially since we've gone without baked goods for so long,\"\nConseil said.\n\n\"It's more than just bread,\" the Canadian added.  \"It's a dainty pastry.\nYou've never eaten any, sir?\"\n\n\"No, Ned.\"\n\n\"All right, get ready for something downright delectable!\nIf you don't come back for seconds, I'm no longer the King of Harpooners!\"\n\nAfter a few minutes, the parts of the fruit exposed to the fire were\ncompletely toasted.  On the inside there appeared some white pasta,\na sort of soft bread center whose flavor reminded me of artichoke.\n\nThis bread was excellent, I must admit, and I ate it with great pleasure.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" I said, \"this pasta won't stay fresh, so it seems\npointless to make a supply for on board.\"\n\n\"By thunder, sir!\"  Ned Land exclaimed.  \"There you go,\ntalking like a naturalist, but meantime I'll be acting like a baker!\nConseil, harvest some of this fruit to take with us when we go back.\"\n\n\"And how will you prepare it?\"  I asked the Canadian.\n\n\"I'll make a fermented batter from its pulp that'll keep\nindefinitely without spoiling.  When I want some, I'll just cook\nit in the galley on board--it'll have a slightly tart flavor,\nbut you'll find it excellent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\"So, Mr. Ned, I see that this bread is all we need--\"\n\n\"Not quite, professor,\" the Canadian replied.  \"We need some fruit\nto go with it, or at least some vegetables.\"\n\n\"Then let's look for fruit and vegetables.\"\n\nWhen our breadfruit harvesting was done, we took to the trail\nto complete this \"dry-land dinner.\"\n\nWe didn't search in vain, and near noontime we had an ample supply\nof bananas.  This delicious produce from the Torrid Zones ripens\nall year round, and Malaysians, who give them the name \"pisang,\"\neat them without bothering to cook them.  In addition to bananas,\nwe gathered some enormous jackfruit with a very tangy flavor,\nsome tasty mangoes, and some pineapples of unbelievable size.\nBut this foraging took up a good deal of our time, which, even so,\nwe had no cause to regret.\n\nConseil kept Ned under observation.  The harpooner walked in the lead,\nand during his stroll through this forest, he gathered with sure hands\nsome excellent fruit that should have completed his provisions.\n\n\"So,\" Conseil asked, \"you have everything you need, Ned my friend?\"\n\n\"Humph!\" the Canadian put in.\n\n\"What!  You're complaining?\"\n\n\"All this vegetation doesn't make a meal,\" Ned replied.\n\"Just side dishes, dessert.  But where's the soup course?\nWhere's the roast?\"\n\n\"Right,\" I said.  \"Ned promised us cutlets, which seems highly\nquestionable to me.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" the Canadian replied, \"our hunting not only isn't over,\nit hasn't even started.  Patience!  We're sure to end up bumping\ninto some animal with either feathers or fur, if not in this locality,\nthen in another.\"\n\n\"And if not today, then tomorrow, because we mustn't wander too far off,\"\nConseil added.  \"That's why I propose that we return to the skiff.\"\n\n\"What!  Already!\"  Ned exclaimed.\n\n\"We ought to be back before nightfall,\" I said.\n\n\"But what hour is it, then?\" the Canadian asked.\n\n\"Two o'clock at least,\" Conseil replied.\n\n\"How time flies on solid ground!\" exclaimed Mr. Ned Land with a\nsigh of regret.\n\n\"Off we go!\"  Conseil replied.\n\nSo we returned through the forest, and we completed our harvest\nby making a clean sweep of some palm cabbages that had to be picked\nfrom the crowns of their trees, some small beans that I recognized\nas the \"abrou\" of the Malaysians, and some high-quality yams.\n\nWe were overloaded when we arrived at the skiff.  However, Ned Land\nstill found these provisions inadequate.  But fortune smiled on him.\nJust as we were boarding, he spotted several trees twenty-five\nto thirty feet high, belonging to the palm species.\nAs valuable as the artocarpus, these trees are justly ranked among\nthe most useful produce in Malaysia.\n\nThey were sago palms, vegetation that grows without being cultivated;\nlike mulberry trees, they reproduce by means of shoots and seeds.\n\nNed Land knew how to handle these trees.  Taking his ax and wielding\nit with great vigor, he soon stretched out on the ground two or\nthree sago palms, whose maturity was revealed by the white dust\nsprinkled over their palm fronds.\n\nI watched him more as a naturalist than as a man in hunger.\nHe began by removing from each trunk an inch-thick strip of bark that\ncovered a network of long, hopelessly tangled fibers that were puttied\nwith a sort of gummy flour.  This flour was the starch-like sago,\nan edible substance chiefly consumed by the Melanesian peoples.\n\nFor the time being, Ned Land was content to chop these trunks into pieces,\nas if he were making firewood; later he would extract the flour\nby sifting it through cloth to separate it from its fibrous ligaments,\nlet it dry out in the sun, and leave it to harden inside molds.\n\nFinally, at five o'clock in the afternoon, laden with all our treasures,\nwe left the island beach and half an hour later pulled alongside\nthe Nautilus.  Nobody appeared on our arrival.  The enormous\nsheet-iron cylinder seemed deserted.  Our provisions loaded on board,\nI went below to my stateroom.  There I found my supper ready.\nI ate and then fell asleep.\n\nThe next day, January 6:  nothing new on board.  Not a sound inside,\nnot a sign of life.  The skiff stayed alongside in the same place\nwe had left it.  We decided to return to Gueboroa Island.  Ned Land\nhoped for better luck in his hunting than on the day before,\nand he wanted to visit a different part of the forest.\n\nBy sunrise we were off.  Carried by an inbound current, the longboat\nreached the island in a matter of moments.\n\nWe disembarked, and thinking it best to abide by the Canadian's instincts,\nwe followed Ned Land, whose long legs threatened to outpace us.\n\nNed Land went westward up the coast; then, fording some stream beds,\nhe reached open plains that were bordered by wonderful forests.\nSome kingfishers lurked along the watercourses, but they didn't\nlet us approach.  Their cautious behavior proved to me that these\nwinged creatures knew where they stood on bipeds of our species,\nand I concluded that if this island wasn't inhabited, at least\nhuman beings paid it frequent visits.\n\nAfter crossing a pretty lush prairie, we arrived on the outskirts\nof a small wood, enlivened by the singing and soaring of a large\nnumber of birds.\n\n\"Still, they're merely birds,\" Conseil said.\n\n\"But some are edible,\" the harpooner replied.\n\n\"Wrong, Ned my friend,\" Conseil answered, \"because I see only\nordinary parrots here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\"Conseil my friend,\" Ned replied in all seriousness, \"parrots are\nlike pheasant to people with nothing else on their plates.\"\n\n\"And I might add,\" I said, \"that when these birds are properly cooked,\nthey're at least worth a stab of the fork.\"\n\nIndeed, under the dense foliage of this wood, a whole host of parrots\nfluttered from branch to branch, needing only the proper upbringing\nto speak human dialects.  At present they were cackling in chorus\nwith parakeets of every color, with solemn cockatoos that seemed to be\npondering some philosophical problem, while bright red lories passed\nby like pieces of bunting borne on the breeze, in the midst of kalao\nparrots raucously on the wing, Papuan lories painted the subtlest\nshades of azure, and a whole variety of delightful winged creatures,\nnone terribly edible.\n\nHowever, one bird unique to these shores, which never passes\nbeyond the boundaries of the Aru and Papuan Islands, was missing\nfrom this collection.  But I was given a chance to marvel at\nit soon enough.\n\nAfter crossing through a moderately dense thicket, we again found\nsome plains obstructed by bushes.  There I saw some magnificent birds\nsoaring aloft, the arrangement of their long feathers causing them to head\ninto the wind.  Their undulating flight, the grace of their aerial curves,\nand the play of their colors allured and delighted the eye.\nI had no trouble identifying them.\n\n\"Birds of paradise!\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"Order Passeriforma, division Clystomora,\" Conseil replied.\n\n\"Partridge family?\"  Ned Land asked.\n\n\"I doubt it, Mr. Land.  Nevertheless, I'm counting on your dexterity\nto catch me one of these delightful representatives of tropical nature!\"\n\n\"I'll give it a try, professor, though I'm handier with a harpoon\nthan a rifle.\"\n\nMalaysians, who do a booming business in these birds with the Chinese,\nhave various methods for catching them that we couldn't use.\nSometimes they set snares on the tops of the tall trees that\nthe bird of paradise prefers to inhabit.  At other times they\ncapture it with a tenacious glue that paralyzes its movements.\nThey will even go so far as to poison the springs where these fowl\nhabitually drink.  But in our case, all we could do was fire\nat them on the wing, which left us little chance of getting one.\nAnd in truth, we used up a good part of our ammunition in vain.\n\nNear eleven o'clock in the morning, we cleared the lower\nslopes of the mountains that form the island's center,\nand we still hadn't bagged a thing.  Hunger spurred us on.\nThe hunters had counted on consuming the proceeds of their hunting,\nand they had miscalculated.  Luckily, and much to his surprise,\nConseil pulled off a right-and-left shot and insured our breakfast.\nHe brought down a white pigeon and a ringdove, which were briskly plucked,\nhung from a spit, and roasted over a blazing fire of deadwood.\nWhile these fascinating animals were cooking, Ned prepared some bread\nfrom the artocarpus.  Then the pigeon and ringdove were devoured\nto the bones and declared excellent.  Nutmeg, on which these birds\nhabitually gorge themselves, sweetens their flesh and makes\nit delicious eating.\n\n\"They taste like chicken stuffed with truffles,\" Conseil said.\n\n\"All right, Ned,\" I asked the Canadian, \"now what do you need?\"\n\n\"Game with four paws, Professor Aronnax,\" Ned Land replied.\n\"All these pigeons are only appetizers, snacks.  So till I've bagged\nan animal with cutlets, I won't be happy!\"\n\n\"Nor I, Ned, until I've caught a bird of paradise.\"\n\n\"Then let's keep hunting,\" Conseil replied, \"but while heading back\nto the sea.  We've arrived at the foothills of these mountains,\nand I think we'll do better if we return to the forest regions.\"\n\nIt was good advice and we took it.  After an hour's walk we reached\na genuine sago palm forest.  A few harmless snakes fled underfoot.\nBirds of paradise stole off at our approach, and I was in real\ndespair of catching one when Conseil, walking in the lead,\nstooped suddenly, gave a triumphant shout, and came back to me,\ncarrying a magnificent bird of paradise.\n\n\"Oh bravo, Conseil!\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"Master is too kind,\" Conseil replied.\n\n\"Not at all, my boy.  That was a stroke of genius, catching one\nof these live birds with your bare hands!\"\n\n\"If master will examine it closely, he'll see that I deserve\nno great praise.\"\n\n\"And why not, Conseil?\"\n\n\"Because this bird is as drunk as a lord.\"\n\n\"Drunk?\"\n\n\"Yes, master, drunk from the nutmegs it was devouring under that nutmeg\ntree where I caught it.  See, Ned my friend, see the monstrous\nresults of intemperance!\"\n\n\"Damnation!\" the Canadian shot back.  \"Considering the amount of gin\nI've had these past two months, you've got nothing to complain about!\"\n\nMeanwhile I was examining this unusual bird.  Conseil was not mistaken.\nTipsy from that potent juice, our bird of paradise had been reduced\nto helplessness.  It was unable to fly.  It was barely able to walk.\nBut this didn't alarm me, and I just let it sleep off its nutmeg.\n\nThis bird belonged to the finest of the eight species credited\nto Papua and its neighboring islands.  It was a \"great emerald,\"\none of the rarest birds of paradise.  It measured three decimeters long.\nIts head was comparatively small, and its eyes, placed near the opening of\nits beak, were also small.  But it offered a wonderful mixture of hues:\na yellow beak, brown feet and claws, hazel wings with purple tips,\npale yellow head and scruff of the neck, emerald throat, the belly\nand chest maroon to brown.  Two strands, made of a horn substance\ncovered with down, rose over its tail, which was lengthened by long,\nvery light feathers of wonderful fineness, and they completed\nthe costume of this marvelous bird that the islanders have poetically\nnamed \"the sun bird.\"\n\n\n\n\nHow I wished I could take this superb bird of paradise back to Paris,\nto make a gift of it to the zoo at the Botanical Gardens,\nwhich doesn't own a single live specimen.\n\n\"So it must be a rarity or something?\" the Canadian asked,\nin the tone of a hunter who, from the viewpoint of his art,\ngives the game a pretty low rating.\n\n\"A great rarity, my gallant comrade, and above all very hard to\ncapture alive.  And even after they're dead, there's still a major\nmarket for these birds.  So the natives have figured out how to create\nfake ones, like people create fake pearls or diamonds.\"\n\n\"What!\"  Conseil exclaimed.  \"They make counterfeit birds of paradise?\"\n\n\"Yes, Conseil.\"\n\n\"And is master familiar with how the islanders go about it?\"\n\n\"Perfectly familiar.  During the easterly monsoon season,\nbirds of paradise lose the magnificent feathers around their tails\nthat naturalists call 'below-the-wing' feathers.  These feathers\nare gathered by the fowl forgers and skillfully fitted onto some poor\npreviously mutilated parakeet.  Then they paint over the suture,\nvarnish the bird, and ship the fruits of their unique labors\nto museums and collectors in Europe.\"\n\n\"Good enough!\"  Ned Land put in.  \"If it isn't the right bird,\nit's still the right feathers, and so long as the merchandise isn't\nmeant to be eaten, I see no great harm!\"\n\nBut if my desires were fulfilled by the capture of this bird of paradise,\nthose of our Canadian huntsman remained unsatisfied.  Luckily, near two\no'clock Ned Land brought down a magnificent wild pig of the type\nthe natives call \"bari-outang.\" This animal came in the nick of time\nfor us to bag some real quadruped meat, and it was warmly welcomed.\nNed Land proved himself quite gloriously with his gunshot.\nHit by an electric bullet, the pig dropped dead on the spot.\n\nThe Canadian properly skinned and cleaned it, after removing half\na dozen cutlets destined to serve as the grilled meat course of our\nevening meal.  Then the hunt was on again, and once more would\nbe marked by the exploits of Ned and Conseil.\n\nIn essence, beating the bushes, the two friends flushed a herd\nof kangaroos that fled by bounding away on their elastic paws.\nBut these animals didn't flee so swiftly that our electric capsules\ncouldn't catch up with them.\n\n\"Oh, professor!\" shouted Ned Land, whose hunting fever had gone\nto his brain.  \"What excellent game, especially in a stew!\nWhat a supply for the Nautilus!  Two, three, five down!\nAnd just think how we'll devour all this meat ourselves,\nwhile those numbskulls on board won't get a shred!\"\n\nIn his uncontrollable glee, I think the Canadian might have\nslaughtered the whole horde, if he hadn't been so busy talking!\nBut he was content with a dozen of these fascinating marsupials,\nwhich make up the first order of aplacental mammals, as Conseil\njust had to tell us.\n\nThese animals were small in stature.  They were a species of those\n\"rabbit kangaroos\" that usually dwell in the hollows of trees\nand are tremendously fast; but although of moderate dimensions,\nthey at least furnish a meat that's highly prized.\n\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with the results of our hunting.\nA gleeful Ned proposed that we return the next day to this magic island,\nwhich he planned to depopulate of its every edible quadruped.\nBut he was reckoning without events.\n\nBy six o'clock in the evening, we were back on the beach.\nThe skiff was aground in its usual place.  The Nautilus, looking like\na long reef, emerged from the waves two miles offshore.\n\nWithout further ado, Ned Land got down to the important business\nof dinner.  He came wonderfully to terms with its entire cooking.\nGrilling over the coals, those cutlets from the \"bari-outang\" soon\ngave off a succulent aroma that perfumed the air.\n\nBut I catch myself following in the Canadian's footsteps.\nLook at me--in ecstasy over freshly grilled pork!\nPlease grant me a pardon as I've already granted one to Mr. Land,\nand on the same grounds!\n\nIn short, dinner was excellent.  Two ringdoves rounded out this\nextraordinary menu.  Sago pasta, bread from the artocarpus, mangoes,\nhalf a dozen pineapples, and the fermented liquor from certain\ncoconuts heightened our glee.  I suspect that my two fine companions\nweren't quite as clearheaded as one could wish.\n\n\"What if we don't return to the Nautilus this evening?\"  Conseil said.\n\n\"What if we never return to it?\"  Ned Land added.\n\nJust then a stone whizzed toward us, landed at our feet, and cut\nshort the harpooner's proposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\n\n\nThe Lightning Bolts of Captain Nemo\n\n\n\nWITHOUT STANDING UP, we stared in the direction of the forest, my hand\nstopping halfway to my mouth, Ned Land's completing its assignment.\n\n\"Stones don't fall from the sky,\" Conseil said, \"or else they\ndeserve to be called meteorites.\"\n\nA second well-polished stone removed a tasty ringdove leg from\nConseil's hand, giving still greater relevance to his observation.\n\nWe all three stood up, rifles to our shoulders, ready to\nanswer any attack.\n\n\"Apes maybe?\"  Ned Land exclaimed.\n\n\"Nearly,\" Conseil replied.  \"Savages.\"\n\n\"Head for the skiff!\"  I said, moving toward the sea.\n\nIndeed, it was essential to beat a retreat because some twenty natives,\narmed with bows and slings, appeared barely a hundred paces off,\non the outskirts of a thicket that masked the horizon to our right.\n\nThe skiff was aground ten fathoms away from us.\n\nThe savages approached without running, but they favored us with a\nshow of the greatest hostility.  It was raining stones and arrows.\n\nNed Land was unwilling to leave his provisions behind, and despite\nthe impending danger, he clutched his pig on one side, his kangaroos\non the other, and scampered off with respectable speed.\n\nIn two minutes we were on the strand.  Loading provisions and weapons\ninto the skiff, pushing it to sea, and positioning its two oars\nwere the work of an instant.  We hadn't gone two cable lengths\nwhen a hundred savages, howling and gesticulating, entered the water\nup to their waists.  I looked to see if their appearance might\ndraw some of the Nautilus's men onto the platform.  But no.\nLying well out, that enormous machine still seemed completely deserted.\n\nTwenty minutes later we boarded ship.  The hatches were open.\nAfter mooring the skiff, we reentered the Nautilus's interior.\n\nI went below to the lounge, from which some chords were wafting.\nCaptain Nemo was there, leaning over the organ, deep in a musical trance.\n\n\"Captain!\"  I said to him.\n\nHe didn't hear me.\n\n\"Captain!\"  I went on, touching him with my hand.\n\nHe trembled, and turning around:\n\n\"Ah, it's you, professor!\" he said to me.  \"Well, did you have\na happy hunt?  Was your herb gathering a success?\"\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" I replied, \"but unfortunately we've brought back\na horde of bipeds whose proximity worries me.\"\n\n\"What sort of bipeds?\"\n\n\"Savages.\"\n\n\"Savages!\"  Captain Nemo replied in an ironic tone.  \"You set\nfoot on one of the shores of this globe, professor, and you're\nsurprised to find savages there?  Where aren't there savages?\nAnd besides, are they any worse than men elsewhere, these people\nyou call savages?\"\n\n\"But captain--\"\n\n\"Speaking for myself, sir, I've encountered them everywhere.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" I replied, \"if you don't want to welcome them aboard\nthe Nautilus, you'd better take some precautions!\"\n\n\"Easy, professor, no cause for alarm.\"\n\n\"But there are a large number of these natives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\"What's your count?\"\n\n\"At least a hundred.\"\n\n\"Professor Aronnax,\" replied Captain Nemo, whose fingers took\ntheir places again on the organ keys, \"if every islander in Papua\nwere to gather on that beach, the Nautilus would still have nothing\nto fear from their attacks!\"\n\nThe captain's fingers then ran over the instrument's keyboard,\nand I noticed that he touched only its black keys, which gave\nhis melodies a basically Scottish color.  Soon he had forgotten my\npresence and was lost in a reverie that I no longer tried to dispel.\n\nI climbed onto the platform.  Night had already fallen, because in\nthis low latitude the sun sets quickly, without any twilight.\nI could see Gueboroa Island only dimly.  But numerous fires had been\nkindled on the beach, attesting that the natives had no thoughts\nof leaving it.\n\nFor several hours I was left to myself, sometimes musing on the islanders--\nbut no longer fearing them because the captain's unflappable confidence\nhad won me over--and sometimes forgetting them to marvel at the splendors\nof this tropical night.  My memories took wing toward France, in the wake\nof those zodiacal stars due to twinkle over it in a few hours.\nThe moon shone in the midst of the constellations at their zenith.\nI then remembered that this loyal, good-natured satellite\nwould return to this same place the day after tomorrow,\nto raise the tide and tear the Nautilus from its coral bed.\nNear midnight, seeing that all was quiet over the darkened waves\nas well as under the waterside trees, I repaired to my cabin and fell\ninto a peaceful sleep.\n\nThe night passed without mishap.  No doubt the Papuans had been\nfrightened off by the mere sight of this monster aground in\nthe bay, because our hatches stayed open, offering easy access\nto the Nautilus's interior.\n\nAt six o'clock in the morning, January 8, I climbed onto the platform.\nThe morning shadows were lifting.  The island was soon on view\nthrough the dissolving mists, first its beaches, then its summits.\n\nThe islanders were still there, in greater numbers than on the day before,\nperhaps 500 or 600 of them.  Taking advantage of the low tide,\nsome of them had moved forward over the heads of coral to within\ntwo cable lengths of the Nautilus.  I could easily distinguish them.\nThey obviously were true Papuans, men of fine stock, athletic in build,\nforehead high and broad, nose large but not flat, teeth white.\nTheir woolly, red-tinted hair was in sharp contrast to their bodies, which\nwere black and glistening like those of Nubians.  Beneath their pierced,\ndistended earlobes there dangled strings of beads made from bone.\nGenerally these savages were naked.  I noted some women among them,\ndressed from hip to knee in grass skirts held up by belts made\nof vegetation.  Some of the chieftains adorned their necks with\ncrescents and with necklaces made from beads of red and white glass.\nArmed with bows, arrows, and shields, nearly all of them carried\nfrom their shoulders a sort of net, which held those polished stones\ntheir slings hurl with such dexterity.\n\n\n\n\nOne of these chieftains came fairly close to the Nautilus,\nexamining it with care.  He must have been a \"mado\" of high rank,\nbecause he paraded in a mat of banana leaves that had ragged edges\nand was accented with bright colors.\n\nI could easily have picked off this islander, he stood at such close\nrange; but I thought it best to wait for an actual show of hostility.\nBetween Europeans and savages, it's acceptable for Europeans to shoot\nback but not to attack first.\n\nDuring this whole time of low tide, the islanders lurked near\nthe Nautilus, but they weren't boisterous.  I often heard them repeat\nthe word \"assai,\" and from their gestures I understood they were\ninviting me to go ashore, an invitation I felt obliged to decline.\n\nSo the skiff didn't leave shipside that day, much to the\ndispleasure of Mr. Land who couldn't complete his provisions.\nThe adroit Canadian spent his time preparing the meat and flour\nproducts he had brought from Gueboroa Island.  As for the savages,\nthey went back to shore near eleven o'clock in the morning, when the heads\nof coral began to disappear under the waves of the rising tide.\nBut I saw their numbers swell considerably on the beach.\nIt was likely that they had come from neighboring islands\nor from the mainland of Papua proper.  However, I didn't see one\nlocal dugout canoe.\n\nHaving nothing better to do, I decided to dredge these beautiful,\nclear waters, which exhibited a profusion of shells, zoophytes,\nand open-sea plants.  Besides, it was the last day the Nautilus\nwould spend in these waterways, if, tomorrow, it still floated off\nto the open sea as Captain Nemo had promised.\n\nSo I summoned Conseil, who brought me a small, light dragnet similar\nto those used in oyster fishing.\n\n\"What about these savages?\"  Conseil asked me.  \"With all due\nrespect to master, they don't strike me as very wicked!\"\n\n\"They're cannibals even so, my boy.\"\n\n\"A person can be both a cannibal and a decent man,\" Conseil replied,\n\"just as a person can be both gluttonous and honorable.\nThe one doesn't exclude the other.\"\n\n\"Fine, Conseil!  And I agree that there are honorable cannibals who\ndecently devour their prisoners.  However, I'm opposed to being devoured,\neven in all decency, so I'll keep on my guard, especially since\nthe Nautilus's commander seems to be taking no precautions.\nAnd now let's get to work!\"\n\nFor two hours our fishing proceeded energetically but without\nbringing up any rarities.  Our dragnet was filled with Midas abalone,\nharp shells, obelisk snails, and especially the finest hammer shells\nI had seen to that day.  We also gathered in a few sea cucumbers,\nsome pearl oysters, and a dozen small turtles that we saved for\nthe ship's pantry.\n\nBut just when I least expected it, I laid my hands on a wonder, a natural\ndeformity I'd have to call it, something very seldom encountered.\nConseil had just made a cast of the dragnet, and his gear had\ncome back up loaded with a variety of fairly ordinary seashells,\nwhen suddenly he saw me plunge my arms swiftly into the net, pull out\na shelled animal, and give a conchological yell, in other words,\nthe most piercing yell a human throat can produce.\n\n\"Eh?  What happened to master?\"  Conseil asked, very startled.\n\"Did master get bitten?\"\n\n\"No, my boy, but I'd gladly have sacrificed a finger for such a find!\"\n\n\"What find?\"\n\n\"This shell,\" I said, displaying the subject of my triumph.\n\n\"But that's simply an olive shell of the 'tent olive' species,\ngenus Oliva, order Pectinibranchia, class Gastropoda, branch Mollusca--\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Conseil!  But instead of coiling from right to left,\nthis olive shell rolls from left to right!\"\n\n\"It can't be!\"  Conseil exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, my boy, it's a left-handed shell!\"\n\n\"A left-handed shell!\"  Conseil repeated, his heart pounding.\n\n\"Look at its spiral!\"\n\n\"Oh, master can trust me on this,\" Conseil said, taking the valuable\nshell in trembling hands, \"but never have I felt such excitement!\"\n\nAnd there was good reason to be excited!  In fact, as naturalists\nhave ventured to observe, \"dextrality\" is a well-known law of nature.\nIn their rotational and orbital movements, stars and their satellites go\nfrom right to left.  Man uses his right hand more often than his left,\nand consequently his various instruments and equipment (staircases, locks,\nwatch springs, etc.) are designed to be used in a right-to-left manner.\nNow then, nature has generally obeyed this law in coiling her shells.\nThey're right-handed with only rare exceptions, and when by chance\na shell's spiral is left-handed, collectors will pay its weight\nin gold for it.\n\nSo Conseil and I were deep in the contemplation of our treasure,\nand I was solemnly promising myself to enrich the Paris Museum\nwith it, when an ill-timed stone, hurled by one of the islanders,\nwhizzed over and shattered the valuable object in Conseil's hands.\n\nI gave a yell of despair!  Conseil pounced on his rifle and aimed\nat a savage swinging a sling just ten meters away from him.\nI tried to stop him, but his shot went off and shattered a bracelet\nof amulets dangling from the islander's arm.\n\n\"Conseil!\"  I shouted.  \"Conseil!\"\n\n\"Eh?  What?  Didn't master see that this man-eater initiated the attack?\"\n\n\"A shell isn't worth a human life!\"  I told him.\n\n\"Oh, the rascal!\"  Conseil exclaimed.  \"I'd rather he cracked\nmy shoulder!\"\n\nConseil was in dead earnest, but I didn't subscribe to his views.\nHowever, the situation had changed in only a short time and we\nhadn't noticed.  Now some twenty dugout canoes were surrounding\nthe Nautilus.  Hollowed from tree trunks, these dugouts were long,\nnarrow, and well designed for speed, keeping their balance by means\nof two bamboo poles that floated on the surface of the water.\nThey were maneuvered by skillful, half-naked paddlers, and I viewed\ntheir advance with definite alarm.\n\nIt was obvious these Papuans had already entered into relations with\nEuropeans and knew their ships.  But this long, iron cylinder lying\nin the bay, with no masts or funnels--what were they to make of it?\nNothing good, because at first they kept it at a respectful distance.\nHowever, seeing that it stayed motionless, they regained confidence\nlittle by little and tried to become more familiar with it.\nNow then, it was precisely this familiarity that we needed to prevent.\nSince our weapons made no sound when they went off, they would\nhave only a moderate effect on these islanders, who reputedly\nrespect nothing but noisy mechanisms.  Without thunderclaps,\nlightning bolts would be much less frightening, although the danger\nlies in the flash, not the noise.\n\nJust then the dugout canoes drew nearer to the Nautilus, and a cloud\nof arrows burst over us.\n\n\"Fire and brimstone, it's hailing!\"  Conseil said.\n\"And poisoned hail perhaps!\"\n\n\"We've got to alert Captain Nemo,\" I said, reentering the hatch.\n\nI went below to the lounge.  I found no one there.  I ventured\na knock at the door opening into the captain's stateroom.\n\nThe word \"Enter!\" answered me.  I did so and found Captain Nemo\nbusy with calculations in which there was no shortage of X and\nother algebraic signs.\n\n\"Am I disturbing you?\"  I said out of politeness.\n\n\"Correct, Professor Aronnax,\" the captain answered me.\n\"But I imagine you have pressing reasons for looking me up?\"\n\n\"Very pressing.  Native dugout canoes are surrounding us, and in a few\nminutes we're sure to be assaulted by several hundred savages.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"  Captain Nemo put in serenely.  \"They've come in their dugouts?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, closing the hatches should do the trick.\"\n\n\"Precisely, and that's what I came to tell you--\"\n\n\"Nothing easier,\" Captain Nemo said.\n\nAnd he pressed an electric button, transmitting an order to\nthe crew's quarters.\n\n\"There, sir, all under control!\" he told me after a few moments.\n\"The skiff is in place and the hatches are closed.  I don't imagine\nyou're worried that these gentlemen will stave in walls that shells\nfrom your frigate couldn't breach?\"\n\n\"No, captain, but one danger still remains.\"\n\n\"What's that, sir?\"\n\n\n\n\n\"Tomorrow at about this time, we'll need to reopen the hatches\nto renew the Nautilus's air.\"\n\n\"No argument, sir, since our craft breathes in the manner\nfavored by cetaceans.\"\n\n\"But if these Papuans are occupying the platform at that moment,\nI don't see how you can prevent them from entering.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, you assume they'll board the ship?\"\n\n\"I'm certain of it.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, let them come aboard.  I see no reason to prevent them.\nDeep down they're just poor devils, these Papuans, and I don't\nwant my visit to Gueboroa Island to cost the life of a single one\nof these unfortunate people!\"\n\nOn this note I was about to withdraw; but Captain Nemo detained\nme and invited me to take a seat next to him.  He questioned me\nwith interest on our excursions ashore and on our hunting, but seemed\nnot to understand the Canadian's passionate craving for red meat.\nThen our conversation skimmed various subjects, and without being\nmore forthcoming, Captain Nemo proved more affable.\n\nAmong other things, we came to talk of the Nautilus's circumstances,\naground in the same strait where Captain Dumont d'Urville had\nnearly miscarried.  Then, pertinent to this:\n\n\"He was one of your great seamen,\" the captain told me,\n\"one of your shrewdest navigators, that d'Urville! He was\nthe Frenchman's Captain Cook.  A man wise but unlucky!\nBraving the ice banks of the South Pole, the coral of Oceania,\nthe cannibals of the Pacific, only to perish wretchedly in a train wreck!\nIf that energetic man was able to think about his life in its\nlast seconds, imagine what his final thoughts must have been!\"\n\nAs he spoke, Captain Nemo seemed deeply moved, an emotion I felt\nwas to his credit.\n\nThen, chart in hand, we returned to the deeds of the French navigator:\nhis voyages to circumnavigate the globe, his double attempt at\nthe South Pole, which led to his discovery of the Ad\u00e9lie Coast\nand the Louis-Philippe Peninsula, finally his hydrographic surveys\nof the chief islands in Oceania.\n\n\"What your d'Urville did on the surface of the sea,\" Captain Nemo\ntold me, \"I've done in the ocean's interior, but more easily,\nmore completely than he.  Constantly tossed about by hurricanes,\nthe Zealous and the new Astrolabe couldn't compare with the Nautilus,\na quiet work room truly at rest in the midst of the waters!\"\n\n\"Even so, captain,\" I said, \"there is one major similarity between\nDumont d'Urville's sloops of war and the Nautilus.\"\n\n\"What's that, sir?\"\n\n\"Like them, the Nautilus has run aground!\"\n\n\"The Nautilus is not aground, sir,\" Captain Nemo replied icily.\n\"The Nautilus was built to rest on the ocean floor, and I don't\nneed to undertake the arduous labors, the maneuvers d'Urville\nhad to attempt in order to float off his sloops of war.\nThe Zealous and the new Astrolabe wellnigh perished, but my Nautilus\nis in no danger.  Tomorrow, on the day stated and at the hour stated,\nthe tide will peacefully lift it off, and it will resume its navigating\nthrough the seas.\"\n\n\"Captain,\" I said, \"I don't doubt--\"\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" Captain Nemo added, standing up, \"tomorrow at\n2:40 in the afternoon, the Nautilus will float off and exit\nthe Torres Strait undamaged.\"\n\nPronouncing these words in an extremely sharp tone, Captain Nemo gave\nme a curt bow.  This was my dismissal, and I reentered my stateroom.\n\nThere I found Conseil, who wanted to know the upshot of my interview\nwith the captain.\n\n\"My boy,\" I replied, \"when I expressed the belief that these Papuan\nnatives were a threat to his Nautilus, the captain answered\nme with great irony.  So I've just one thing to say to you:\nhave faith in him and sleep in peace.\"\n\n\"Master has no need for my services?\"\n\n\"No, my friend.  What's Ned Land up to?\"\n\n\"Begging master's indulgence,\" Conseil replied, \"but our friend Ned\nis concocting a kangaroo pie that will be the eighth wonder!\"\n\nI was left to myself; I went to bed but slept pretty poorly.\nI kept hearing noises from the savages, who were stamping on\nthe platform and letting out deafening yells.  The night passed\nin this way, without the crew ever emerging from their usual inertia.\nThey were no more disturbed by the presence of these man-eaters\nthan soldiers in an armored fortress are troubled by ants running\nover the armor plate.\n\nI got up at six o'clock in the morning.  The hatches weren't open.\nSo the air inside hadn't been renewed; but the air tanks were kept\nfull for any eventuality and would function appropriately to shoot\na few cubic meters of oxygen into the Nautilus's thin atmosphere.\n\nI worked in my stateroom until noon without seeing Captain Nemo\neven for an instant.  Nobody on board seemed to be making any\npreparations for departure.\n\nI still waited for a while, then I made my way to the main lounge.\nIts timepiece marked 2:30. In ten minutes the tide would reach its\nmaximum elevation, and if Captain Nemo hadn't made a rash promise,\nthe Nautilus would immediately break free.  If not, many months\nmight pass before it could leave its coral bed.\n\nBut some preliminary vibrations could soon be felt over the boat's hull.\nI heard its plating grind against the limestone roughness of\nthat coral base.\n\nAt 2:35 Captain Nemo appeared in the lounge.\n\n\"We're about to depart,\" he said.\n\n\"Ah!\"  I put in.\n\n\"I've given orders to open the hatches.\"\n\n\n\n\n\"What about the Papuans?\"\n\n\"What about them?\"  Captain Nemo replied, with a light shrug\nof his shoulders.\n\n\"Won't they come inside the Nautilus?\"\n\n\"How will they manage that?\"\n\n\"By jumping down the hatches you're about to open.\"\n\n\"Professor Aronnax,\" Captain Nemo replied serenely, \"the Nautilus's\nhatches aren't to be entered in that fashion even when they're open.\"\n\nI gaped at the captain.\n\n\"You don't understand?\" he said to me.\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"Well, come along and you'll see!\"\n\nI headed to the central companionway.  There, very puzzled,\nNed Land and Conseil watched the crewmen opening the hatches,\nwhile a frightful clamor and furious shouts resounded outside.\n\nThe hatch lids fell back onto the outer plating.\nTwenty horrible faces appeared.  But when the first islander laid\nhands on the companionway railing, he was flung backward by some\ninvisible power, lord knows what!  He ran off, howling in terror\nand wildly prancing around.\n\nTen of his companions followed him.  All ten met the same fate.\n\nConseil was in ecstasy.  Carried away by his violent instincts,\nNed Land leaped up the companionway.  But as soon as his hands\nseized the railing, he was thrown backward in his turn.\n\n\"Damnation!\" he exclaimed.  \"I've been struck by a lightning bolt!\"\n\nThese words explained everything to me.  It wasn't just a railing\nthat led to the platform, it was a metal cable fully charged with\nthe ship's electricity.  Anyone who touched it got a fearsome shock--\nand such a shock would have been fatal if Captain Nemo had thrown\nthe full current from his equipment into this conducting cable!\nIt could honestly be said that he had stretched between himself and his\nassailants a network of electricity no one could clear with impunity.\n\nMeanwhile, crazed with terror, the unhinged Papuans beat a retreat.\nAs for us, half laughing, we massaged and comforted poor Ned Land,\nwho was swearing like one possessed.\n\nBut just then, lifted off by the tide's final undulations, the Nautilus\nleft its coral bed at exactly that fortieth minute pinpointed\nby the captain.  Its propeller churned the waves with lazy majesty.\nGathering speed little by little, the ship navigated on the surface\nof the ocean, and safe and sound, it left behind the dangerous\nnarrows of the Torres Strait.\n\n\nCHAPTER 23\n\n\"Aegri Somnia\"*\n\n*Latin: \"troubled dreams.\"  Ed.\n\n\nTHE FOLLOWING DAY, January 10, the Nautilus resumed its travels\nin midwater but at a remarkable speed that I estimated to be at\nleast thirty-five miles per hour.  The propeller was going so fast\nI could neither follow nor count its revolutions.\n\nI thought about how this marvelous electric force not only\ngave motion, heat, and light to the Nautilus but even protected it\nagainst outside attack, transforming it into a sacred ark no profane\nhand could touch without being blasted; my wonderment was boundless,\nand it went from the submersible itself to the engineer who\nhad created it.\n\nWe were traveling due west and on January 11 we doubled Cape Wessel,\nlocated in longitude 135 degrees and latitude 10 degrees north,\nthe western tip of the Gulf of Carpentaria.  Reefs were still\nnumerous but more widely scattered and were fixed on the chart\nwith the greatest accuracy.  The Nautilus easily avoided\nthe Money breakers to port and the Victoria reefs to starboard,\npositioned at longitude 130 degrees on the tenth parallel,\nwhich we went along rigorously.\n\nOn January 13, arriving in the Timor Sea, Captain Nemo raised\nthe island of that name at longitude 122 degrees.  This island,\nwhose surface area measures 1,625 square leagues, is governed by rajahs.\nThese aristocrats deem themselves the sons of crocodiles, in other words,\ndescendants with the most exalted origins to which a human\nbeing can lay claim.  Accordingly, their scaly ancestors infest\nthe island's rivers and are the subjects of special veneration.\nThey are sheltered, nurtured, flattered, pampered, and offered\na ritual diet of nubile maidens; and woe to the foreigner who lifts\na finger against these sacred saurians.\n\nBut the Nautilus wanted nothing to do with these nasty animals.\nTimor Island was visible for barely an instant at noon while the chief\nofficer determined his position.  I also caught only a glimpse\nof little Roti Island, part of this same group, whose women have a\nwell-established reputation for beauty in the Malaysian marketplace.\n\nAfter our position fix, the Nautilus's latitude bearings were modulated\nto the southwest.  Our prow pointed to the Indian Ocean.  Where would\nCaptain Nemo's fancies take us?  Would he head up to the shores\nof Asia?  Would he pull nearer to the beaches of Europe?  Unlikely choices\nfor a man who avoided populated areas!  So would he go down south?\nWould he double the Cape of Good Hope, then Cape Horn, and push\non to the Antarctic pole?  Finally, would he return to the seas\nof the Pacific, where his Nautilus could navigate freely and easily?\nTime would tell.\n\nAfter cruising along the Cartier, Hibernia, Seringapatam, and Scott reefs,\nthe solid element's last exertions against the liquid element,\nwe were beyond all sight of shore by January 14.  The Nautilus\nslowed down in an odd manner, and very unpredictable in its ways,\nit sometimes swam in the midst of the waters, sometimes drifted\non their surface.\n\nDuring this phase of our voyage, Captain Nemo conducted interesting\nexperiments on the different temperatures in various strata of the sea.\nUnder ordinary conditions, such readings are obtained using\nsome pretty complicated instruments whose findings are dubious\nto say the least, whether they're thermometric sounding lines,\nwhose glass often shatters under the water's pressure, or those devices\nbased on the varying resistance of metals to electric currents.\nThe results so obtained can't be adequately double-checked. By contrast,\nCaptain Nemo would seek the sea's temperature by going himself\ninto its depths, and when he placed his thermometer in contact\nwith the various layers of liquid, he found the sought-for degree\nimmediately and with certainty.\n\nAnd so, by loading up its ballast tanks, or by sinking obliquely\nwith its slanting fins, the Nautilus successively reached\ndepths of 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 7,000, 9,000, and 10,000 meters,\nand the ultimate conclusion from these experiments was that,\nin all latitudes, the sea had a permanent temperature of 4.5 degrees\ncentigrade at a depth of 1,000 meters.\n\nI watched these experiments with the most intense fascination.\nCaptain Nemo brought a real passion to them.  I often wondered\nwhy he took these observations.  Were they for the benefit\nof his fellow man?  It was unlikely, because sooner or later\nhis work would perish with him in some unknown sea!\nUnless he intended the results of his experiments for me.\nBut that meant this strange voyage of mine would come to an end,\nand no such end was in sight.\n\nBe that as it may, Captain Nemo also introduced me to the different\ndata he had obtained on the relative densities of the water\nin our globe's chief seas.  From this news I derived some personal\nenlightenment having nothing to do with science.\n\nIt happened the morning of January 15.  The captain, with whom I\nwas strolling on the platform, asked me if I knew how salt water\ndiffers in density from sea to sea.  I said no, adding that there\nwas a lack of rigorous scientific observations on this subject.\n\n\"I've taken such observations,\" he told me, \"and I can vouch\nfor their reliability.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" I replied, \"but the Nautilus lives in a separate world,\nand the secrets of its scientists don't make their way ashore.\"\n\n\"You're right, professor,\" he told me after a few moments of silence.\n\"This is a separate world.  It's as alien to the earth as the planets\naccompanying our globe around the sun, and we'll never become\nfamiliar with the work of scientists on Saturn or Jupiter.  But since\nfate has linked our two lives, I can reveal the results of my\nobservations to you.\"\n\n\"I'm all attention, captain.\"\n\n\"You're aware, professor, that salt water is denser than fresh water,\nbut this density isn't uniform.  In essence, if I represent\nthe density of fresh water by 1.000, then I find 1.028 for\nthe waters of the Atlantic, 1.026 for the waters of the Pacific,\n1.030 for the waters of the Mediterranean--\"\n\nAha, I thought, so he ventures into the Mediterranean?\n\n\"--1.018 for the waters of the Ionian Sea, and 1.029 for the waters\nof the Adriatic.\"\n\nAssuredly, the Nautilus didn't avoid the heavily traveled seas\nof Europe, and from this insight I concluded that the ship would\ntake us back--perhaps very soon--to more civilized shores.\nI expected Ned Land to greet this news with unfeigned satisfaction.\n\nFor several days our work hours were spent in all sorts of experiments,\non the degree of salinity in waters of different depths,\nor on their electric properties, coloration, and transparency,\nand in every instance Captain Nemo displayed an ingenuity equaled\nonly by his graciousness toward me.  Then I saw no more of him\nfor some days and again lived on board in seclusion.\n\nOn January 16 the Nautilus seemed to have fallen asleep just a few meters\nbeneath the surface of the water.  Its electric equipment had been\nturned off, and the motionless propeller let it ride with the waves.\nI assumed that the crew were busy with interior repairs,\nrequired by the engine's strenuous mechanical action.\n\nMy companions and I then witnessed an unusual sight.\nThe panels in the lounge were open, and since the Nautilus's beacon\nwas off, a hazy darkness reigned in the midst of the waters.\nCovered with heavy clouds, the stormy sky gave only the faintest\nlight to the ocean's upper strata.\n\nI was observing the state of the sea under these conditions,\nand even the largest fish were nothing more than ill-defined shadows,\nwhen the Nautilus was suddenly transferred into broad daylight.\nAt first I thought the beacon had gone back on and was casting\nits electric light into the liquid mass.  I was mistaken,\nand after a hasty examination I discovered my error.\n\nThe Nautilus had drifted into the midst of some phosphorescent\nstrata, which, in this darkness, came off as positively dazzling.\nThis effect was caused by myriads of tiny, luminous animals\nwhose brightness increased when they glided over the metal hull\nof our submersible.  In the midst of these luminous sheets of water,\nI then glimpsed flashes of light, like those seen inside a blazing\nfurnace from streams of molten lead or from masses of metal\nbrought to a white heat--flashes so intense that certain areas\nof the light became shadows by comparison, in a fiery setting\nfrom which every shadow should seemingly have been banished.\nNo, this was no longer the calm emission of our usual lighting!\nThis light throbbed with unprecedented vigor and activity!\nYou sensed that it was alive!\n\nIn essence, it was a cluster of countless open-sea infusoria,\nof noctiluca an eighth of an inch wide, actual globules of\ntransparent jelly equipped with a threadlike tentacle, up to 25,000\nof which have been counted in thirty cubic centimeters of water.\nAnd the power of their light was increased by those glimmers\nunique to medusas, starfish, common jellyfish, angel-wing clams,\nand other phosphorescent zoophytes, which were saturated with grease\nfrom organic matter decomposed by the sea, and perhaps with mucus\nsecreted by fish.\n\nFor several hours the Nautilus drifted in this brilliant tide,\nand our wonderment grew when we saw huge marine animals\ncavorting in it, like the fire-dwelling salamanders of myth.\nIn the midst of these flames that didn't burn, I could see swift,\nelegant porpoises, the tireless pranksters of the seas,\nand sailfish three meters long, those shrewd heralds of hurricanes,\nwhose fearsome broadswords sometimes banged against the lounge window.\nThen smaller fish appeared:  miscellaneous triggerfish,\nleather jacks, unicornfish, and a hundred others that left stripes\non this luminous atmosphere in their course.\n\nSome magic lay behind this dazzling sight!  Perhaps some\natmospheric condition had intensified this phenomenon?\nPerhaps a storm had been unleashed on the surface of the waves?\nBut only a few meters down, the Nautilus felt no tempest's fury,\nand the ship rocked peacefully in the midst of the calm waters.\n\nAnd so it went, some new wonder constantly delighting us.\nConseil observed and classified his zoophytes, articulates, mollusks,\nand fish.  The days passed quickly, and I no longer kept track of them.\nNed, as usual, kept looking for changes of pace from our standard fare.\nLike actual snails, we were at home in our shell, and I can vouch\nthat it's easy to turn into a full-fledged snail.\n\nSo this way of living began to seem simple and natural to us,\nand we no longer envisioned a different lifestyle on the surface\nof the planet earth, when something happened to remind us of\nour strange circumstances.\n\nOn January 18 the Nautilus lay in longitude 105 degrees and latitude 15\ndegrees south.  The weather was threatening, the sea rough and billowy.\nThe wind was blowing a strong gust from the east.  The barometer,\nwhich had been falling for some days, forecast an approaching\nstruggle of the elements.\n\nI had climbed onto the platform just as the chief officer was taking\nhis readings of hour angles.  Out of habit I waited for him to pronounce\nhis daily phrase.  But that day it was replaced by a different phrase,\njust as incomprehensible.  Almost at once I saw Captain Nemo appear,\nlift his spyglass, and inspect the horizon.\n\nFor some minutes the captain stood motionless, rooted to the spot\ncontained within the field of his lens.  Then he lowered his\nspyglass and exchanged about ten words with his chief officer.\nThe latter seemed to be in the grip of an excitement he tried in vain\nto control.  More in command of himself, Captain Nemo remained cool.\nFurthermore, he seemed to be raising certain objections that his\nchief officer kept answering with flat assurances.  At least that's\nwhat I gathered from their differences in tone and gesture.\n\nAs for me, I stared industriously in the direction under observation\nbut without spotting a thing.  Sky and water merged into a perfectly\nclean horizon line.\n\nMeanwhile Captain Nemo strolled from one end of the platform\nto the other, not glancing at me, perhaps not even seeing me.\nHis step was firm but less regular than usual.  Sometimes he\nwould stop, cross his arms over his chest, and observe the sea.\nWhat could he be looking for over that immense expanse?\nBy then the Nautilus lay hundreds of miles from the nearest coast!\n\nThe chief officer kept lifting his spyglass and stubbornly\nexamining the horizon, walking up and down, stamping his foot,\nin his nervous agitation a sharp contrast to his superior.\n\nBut this mystery would inevitably be cleared up, and soon,\nbecause Captain Nemo gave orders to increase speed; at once the engine\nstepped up its drive power, setting the propeller in swifter rotation.\n\nJust then the chief officer drew the captain's attention anew.\nThe latter interrupted his strolling and aimed his spyglass\nat the point indicated.  He observed it a good while.\nAs for me, deeply puzzled, I went below to the lounge and brought\nback an excellent long-range telescope I habitually used.\nLeaning my elbows on the beacon housing, which jutted from the stern\nof the platform, I got set to scour that whole stretch of sky and sea.\n\nBut no sooner had I peered into the eyepiece than the instrument\nwas snatched from my hands.\n\nI spun around.  Captain Nemo was standing before me, but I almost\ndidn't recognize him.  His facial features were transfigured.\nGleaming with dark fire, his eyes had shrunk beneath his frowning brow.\nHis teeth were half bared.  His rigid body, clenched fists,\nand head drawn between his shoulders, all attested to a fierce\nhate breathing from every pore.  He didn't move.  My spyglass fell\nfrom his hand and rolled at his feet.\n\nHad I accidentally caused these symptoms of anger?  Did this\nincomprehensible individual think I had detected some secret\nforbidden to guests on the Nautilus?\n\nNo!  I wasn't the subject of his hate because he wasn't even looking\nat me; his eyes stayed stubbornly focused on that inscrutable point\nof the horizon.\n\nFinally Captain Nemo regained his self-control. His facial appearance,\nso profoundly changed, now resumed its usual calm.  He addressed\na few words to his chief officer in their strange language,\nthen he turned to me:\n\n\"Professor Aronnax,\" he told me in a tone of some urgency, \"I ask\nthat you now honor one of the binding agreements between us.\"\n\n\"Which one, captain?\"\n\n\"You and your companions must be placed in confinement until I see\nfit to set you free.\"\n\n\"You're in command,\" I answered, gaping at him.  \"But may I address\na question to you?\"\n\n\"You may not, sir.\"\n\nAfter that, I stopped objecting and started obeying,\nsince resistance was useless.\n\nI went below to the cabin occupied by Ned Land and Conseil,\nand I informed them of the captain's decision.  I'll let the reader\ndecide how this news was received by the Canadian.  In any case,\nthere was no time for explanations.  Four crewmen were waiting\nat the door, and they led us to the cell where we had spent our\nfirst night aboard the Nautilus.\n\nNed Land tried to lodge a complaint, but the only answer he got\nwas a door shut in his face.\n\n\"Will master tell me what this means?\"  Conseil asked me.\n\nI told my companions what had happened.  They were as astonished\nas I was, but no wiser.\n\nThen I sank into deep speculation, and Captain Nemo's strange facial\nseizure kept haunting me.  I was incapable of connecting two ideas\nin logical order, and I had strayed into the most absurd hypotheses,\nwhen I was snapped out of my mental struggles by these words\nfrom Ned Land:\n\n\"Well, look here!  Lunch is served!\"\n\nIndeed, the table had been laid.  Apparently Captain Nemo had given\nthis order at the same time he commanded the Nautilus to pick up speed.\n\n\"Will master allow me to make him a recommendation?\"\nConseil asked me.\n\n\"Yes, my boy,\" I replied.\n\n\"Well, master needs to eat his lunch!  It's prudent, because we\nhave no idea what the future holds.\"\n\n\"You're right, Conseil.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" Ned Land said, \"they've only given us the standard menu.\"\n\n\"Ned my friend,\" Conseil answered, \"what would you say if they'd\ngiven us no lunch at all?\"\n\nThis dose of sanity cut the harpooner's complaints clean off.\n\nWe sat down at the table.  Our meal proceeded pretty much in silence.\nI ate very little.  Conseil, everlastingly prudent, \"force-fed\" himself;\nand despite the menu, Ned Land didn't waste a bite.  Then, lunch over,\neach of us propped himself in a corner.\n\nJust then the luminous globe lighting our cell went out,\nleaving us in profound darkness.  Ned Land soon dozed off,\nand to my astonishment, Conseil also fell into a heavy slumber.\nI was wondering what could have caused this urgent need\nfor sleep, when I felt a dense torpor saturate my brain.\nI tried to keep my eyes open, but they closed in spite of me.\nI was in the grip of anguished hallucinations.  Obviously some\nsleep-inducing substance had been laced into the food we'd just eaten!\nSo imprisonment wasn't enough to conceal Captain Nemo's plans from us--\nsleep was needed as well!\n\nThen I heard the hatches close.  The sea's undulations,\nwhich had been creating a gentle rocking motion, now ceased.\nHad the Nautilus left the surface of the ocean?  Was it reentering\nthe motionless strata deep in the sea?\n\nI tried to fight off this drowsiness.  It was impossible.\nMy breathing grew weaker.  I felt a mortal chill freeze\nmy dull, nearly paralyzed limbs.  Like little domes of lead,\nmy lids fell over my eyes.  I couldn't raise them.\nA morbid sleep, full of hallucinations, seized my whole being.\nThen the visions disappeared and left me in utter oblivion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24\n\n\n\nThe Coral Realm\n\n\n\nTHE NEXT DAY I woke up with my head unusually clear.  Much to\nmy surprise, I was in my stateroom.  No doubt my companions had been\nput back in their cabin without noticing it any more than I had.\nLike me, they would have no idea what took place during the night, and to\nunravel this mystery I could count only on some future happenstance.\n\nI then considered leaving my stateroom.  Was I free or still a prisoner?\nPerfectly free.  I opened my door, headed down the gangways,\nand climbed the central companionway.  Hatches that had been closed\nthe day before were now open.  I arrived on the platform.\n\nNed Land and Conseil were there waiting for me.  I questioned them.\nThey knew nothing.  Lost in a heavy sleep of which they had no memory,\nthey were quite startled to be back in their cabin.\n\nAs for the Nautilus, it seemed as tranquil and mysterious as ever.\nIt was cruising on the surface of the waves at a moderate speed.\nNothing seemed to have changed on board.\n\nNed Land observed the sea with his penetrating eyes.  It was deserted.\nThe Canadian sighted nothing new on the horizon, neither sail nor shore.\nA breeze was blowing noisily from the west, and disheveled by the wind,\nlong billows made the submersible roll very noticeably.\n\nAfter renewing its air, the Nautilus stayed at an average depth\nof fifteen meters, enabling it to return quickly to the surface\nof the waves.  And, contrary to custom, it executed such a maneuver\nseveral times during that day of January 19.  The chief officer\nwould then climb onto the platform, and his usual phrase would ring\nthrough the ship's interior.\n\nAs for Captain Nemo, he didn't appear.  Of the other men on board,\nI saw only my emotionless steward, who served me with his\nusual mute efficiency.\n\nNear two o'clock I was busy organizing my notes in the lounge,\nwhen the captain opened the door and appeared.  I bowed to him.\nHe gave me an almost imperceptible bow in return, without saying a word\nto me.  I resumed my work, hoping he might give me some explanation\nof the previous afternoon's events.  He did nothing of the sort.\nI stared at him.  His face looked exhausted; his reddened eyes\nhadn't been refreshed by sleep; his facial features expressed\nprofound sadness, real chagrin.  He walked up and down,\nsat and stood, picked up a book at random, discarded it immediately,\nconsulted his instruments without taking his customary notes,\nand seemed unable to rest easy for an instant.\n\nFinally he came over to me and said:\n\n\"Are you a physician, Professor Aronnax?\"\n\nThis inquiry was so unexpected that I stared at him a good\nwhile without replying.\n\n\"Are you a physician?\" he repeated.  \"Several of your\nscientific colleagues took their degrees in medicine,\nsuch as Gratiolet, Moquin-Tandon, and others.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" I said, \"I am a doctor, I used to be on call\nat the hospitals.  I was in practice for several years before\njoining the museum.\"\n\n\"Excellent, sir.\"\n\nMy reply obviously pleased Captain Nemo.  But not knowing what\nhe was driving at, I waited for further questions, ready to reply\nas circumstances dictated.\n\n\"Professor Aronnax,\" the captain said to me, \"would you consent\nto give your medical attentions to one of my men?\"\n\n\"Someone is sick?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I'm ready to go with you.\"\n\n\"Come.\"\n\nI admit that my heart was pounding.  Lord knows why, but I saw a definite\nconnection between this sick crewman and yesterday's happenings,\nand the mystery of those events concerned me at least as much\nas the man's sickness.\n\nCaptain Nemo led me to the Nautilus's stern and invited me into\na cabin located next to the sailors' quarters.\n\nOn a bed there lay a man some forty years old, with strongly\nmolded features, the very image of an Anglo-Saxon.\n\nI bent over him.  Not only was he sick, he was wounded.\nSwathed in blood-soaked linen, his head was resting on a folded pillow.\nI undid the linen bandages, while the wounded man gazed with great\nstaring eyes and let me proceed without making a single complaint.\n\nIt was a horrible wound.  The cranium had been smashed open\nby some blunt instrument, leaving the naked brains exposed,\nand the cerebral matter had suffered deep abrasions.  Blood clots had\nformed in this dissolving mass, taking on the color of wine dregs.\nBoth contusion and concussion of the brain had occurred.  The sick\nman's breathing was labored, and muscle spasms quivered in his face.\nCerebral inflammation was complete and had brought on a paralysis\nof movement and sensation.\n\nI took the wounded man's pulse.  It was intermittent.\nThe body's extremities were already growing cold, and I saw that death\nwas approaching without any possibility of my holding it in check.\nAfter dressing the poor man's wound, I redid the linen bandages\naround his head, and I turned to Captain Nemo.\n\n\"How did he get this wound?\"  I asked him.\n\n\"That's not important,\" the captain replied evasively.\n\"The Nautilus suffered a collision that cracked one of the engine levers,\nand it struck this man.  My chief officer was standing beside him.\nThis man leaped forward to intercept the blow.  A brother lays down his\nlife for his brother, a friend for his friend, what could be simpler?\nThat's the law for everyone on board the Nautilus.  But what's\nyour diagnosis of his condition?\"\n\nI hesitated to speak my mind.\n\n\"You may talk freely,\" the captain told me.  \"This man\ndoesn't understand French.\"\n\nI took a last look at the wounded man, then I replied:\n\n\"This man will be dead in two hours.\"\n\n\"Nothing can save him?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nCaptain Nemo clenched his fists, and tears slid from his eyes,\nwhich I had thought incapable of weeping.\n\nFor a few moments more I observed the dying man, whose life was\nebbing little by little.  He grew still more pale under the electric\nlight that bathed his deathbed.  I looked at his intelligent head,\nfurrowed with premature wrinkles that misfortune, perhaps misery,\nhad etched long before.  I was hoping to detect the secret of his\nlife in the last words that might escape from his lips!\n\n\"You may go, Professor Aronnax,\" Captain Nemo told me.\n\nI left the captain in the dying man's cabin and I repaired\nto my stateroom, very moved by this scene.  All day long I was\naquiver with gruesome forebodings.  That night I slept poorly,\nand between my fitful dreams, I thought I heard a distant moaning,\nlike a funeral dirge.  Was it a prayer for the dead, murmured in\nthat language I couldn't understand?\n\nThe next morning I climbed on deck.  Captain Nemo was already there.\nAs soon as he saw me, he came over.\n\n\"Professor,\" he said to me, \"would it be convenient for you to make\nan underwater excursion today?\"\n\n\"With my companions?\"  I asked.\n\n\"If they're agreeable.\"\n\n\"We're yours to command, captain.\"\n\n\"Then kindly put on your diving suits.\"\n\nAs for the dead or dying man, he hadn't come into the picture.  I rejoined\nNed Land and Conseil.  I informed them of Captain Nemo's proposition.\nConseil was eager to accept, and this time the Canadian proved\nperfectly amenable to going with us.\n\nIt was eight o'clock in the morning.  By 8:30 we were suited up for this\nnew stroll and equipped with our two devices for lighting and breathing.\nThe double door opened, and accompanied by Captain Nemo with a dozen\ncrewmen following, we set foot on the firm seafloor where the Nautilus\nwas resting, ten meters down.\n\nA gentle slope gravitated to an uneven bottom whose depth was\nabout fifteen fathoms.  This bottom was completely different\nfrom the one I had visited during my first excursion under\nthe waters of the Pacific Ocean.  Here I saw no fine-grained sand,\nno underwater prairies, not one open-sea forest.  I immediately recognized\nthe wondrous region in which Captain Nemo did the honors that day.\nIt was the coral realm.\n\nIn the zoophyte branch, class Alcyonaria, one finds the order Gorgonaria,\nwhich contains three groups:  sea fans, isidian polyps, and coral polyps.\nIt's in this last that precious coral belongs, an unusual substance that,\nat different times, has been classified in the mineral, vegetable,\nand animal kingdoms.  Medicine to the ancients, jewelry to the moderns,\nit wasn't decisively placed in the animal kingdom until 1694,\nby Peysonnel of Marseilles.\n\nA coral is a unit of tiny animals assembled over a polypary\nthat's brittle and stony in nature.  These polyps have a unique\ngenerating mechanism that reproduces them via the budding process,\nand they have an individual existence while also participating\nin a communal life.  Hence they embody a sort of natural socialism.\nI was familiar with the latest research on this bizarre zoophyte--\nwhich turns to stone while taking on a tree form, as some naturalists\nhave very aptly observed--and nothing could have been more fascinating\nto me than to visit one of these petrified forests that nature has\nplanted on the bottom of the sea.\n\nWe turned on our Ruhmkorff devices and went along a coral shoal\nin the process of forming, which, given time, will someday close\noff this whole part of the Indian Ocean.  Our path was bordered\nby hopelessly tangled bushes, formed from snarls of shrubs\nall covered with little star-shaped, white-streaked flowers.\nOnly, contrary to plants on shore, these tree forms become attached\nto rocks on the seafloor by heading from top to bottom.\n\nOur lights produced a thousand delightful effects while playing over\nthese brightly colored boughs.  I fancied I saw these cylindrical,\nmembrane-filled tubes trembling beneath the water's undulations.\nI was tempted to gather their fresh petals, which were adorned with\ndelicate tentacles, some newly in bloom, others barely opened, while\nnimble fish with fluttering fins brushed past them like flocks of birds.\nBut if my hands came near the moving flowers of these sensitive,\nlively creatures, an alarm would instantly sound throughout the colony.\nThe white petals retracted into their red sheaths, the flowers vanished\nbefore my eyes, and the bush changed into a chunk of stony nipples.\n\nSheer chance had placed me in the presence of the most valuable\nspecimens of this zoophyte.  This coral was the equal of those fished\nup from the Mediterranean off the Barbary Coast or the shores\nof France and Italy.  With its bright colors, it lived up to those\npoetic names of blood flower and blood foam that the industry\nconfers on its finest exhibits.  Coral sells for as much as 500\nfrancs per kilogram, and in this locality the liquid strata hid\nenough to make the fortunes of a whole host of coral fishermen.\nThis valuable substance often merges with other polyparies,\nforming compact, hopelessly tangled units known as \"macciota,\"\nand I noted some wonderful pink samples of this coral.\n\nBut as the bushes shrank, the tree forms magnified.\nActual petrified thickets and long alcoves from some fantastic\nschool of architecture kept opening up before our steps.\nCaptain Nemo entered beneath a dark gallery whose gentle slope\ntook us to a depth of 100 meters.  The light from our glass coils\nproduced magical effects at times, lingering on the wrinkled roughness\nof some natural arch, or some overhang suspended like a chandelier,\nwhich our lamps flecked with fiery sparks.  Amid these shrubs\nof precious coral, I observed other polyps no less unusual:\nmelita coral, rainbow coral with jointed outgrowths, then a few\ntufts of genus Corallina, some green and others red, actually a type\nof seaweed encrusted with limestone salts, which, after long disputes,\nnaturalists have finally placed in the vegetable kingdom.\nBut as one intellectual has remarked, \"Here, perhaps, is the actual\npoint where life rises humbly out of slumbering stone, but without\nbreaking away from its crude starting point.\"\n\nFinally, after two hours of walking, we reached a depth of about\n300 meters, in other words, the lowermost limit at which coral\ncan begin to form.  But here it was no longer some isolated bush\nor a modest grove of low timber.  It was an immense forest,\nhuge mineral vegetation, enormous petrified trees linked by garlands\nof elegant hydras from the genus Plumularia, those tropical\ncreepers of the sea, all decked out in shades and gleams.\nWe passed freely under their lofty boughs, lost up in the shadows\nof the waves, while at our feet organ-pipe coral, stony coral,\nstar coral, fungus coral, and sea anemone from the genus Caryophylia\nformed a carpet of flowers all strewn with dazzling gems.\n\nWhat an indescribable sight!  Oh, if only we could share our feelings!\nWhy were we imprisoned behind these masks of metal and glass!\nWhy were we forbidden to talk with each other!  At least let us\nlead the lives of the fish that populate this liquid element,\nor better yet, the lives of amphibians, which can spend long hours\neither at sea or on shore, traveling through their double domain\nas their whims dictate!\n\nMeanwhile Captain Nemo had called a halt.  My companions and I\nstopped walking, and turning around, I saw the crewmen form\na semicircle around their leader.  Looking with greater care,\nI observed that four of them were carrying on their shoulders\nan object that was oblong in shape.\n\nAt this locality we stood in the center of a huge clearing\nsurrounded by the tall tree forms of this underwater forest.\nOur lamps cast a sort of brilliant twilight over the area,\nmaking inordinately long shadows on the seafloor.  Past the boundaries\nof the clearing, the darkness deepened again, relieved only by little\nsparkles given off by the sharp crests of coral.\n\nNed Land and Conseil stood next to me.  We stared, and it\ndawned on me that I was about to witness a strange scene.\nObserving the seafloor, I saw that it swelled at certain points from\nlow bulges that were encrusted with limestone deposits and arranged\nwith a symmetry that betrayed the hand of man.\n\nIn the middle of the clearing, on a pedestal of roughly piled rocks,\nthere stood a cross of coral, extending long arms you would have\nthought were made of petrified blood.\n\nAt a signal from Captain Nemo, one of his men stepped forward and,\na few feet from this cross, detached a mattock from his belt\nand began to dig a hole.\n\nI finally understood!  This clearing was a cemetery, this hole a grave,\nthat oblong object the body of the man who must have died during\nthe night!  Captain Nemo and his men had come to bury their companion\nin this communal resting place on the inaccessible ocean floor!\n\nNo!  My mind was reeling as never before!  Never had ideas of such impact\nraced through my brain!  I didn't want to see what my eyes saw!\n\nMeanwhile the grave digging went slowly.  Fish fled here and\nthere as their retreat was disturbed.  I heard the pick ringing\non the limestone soil, its iron tip sometimes giving off sparks\nwhen it hit a stray piece of flint on the sea bottom.  The hole\ngrew longer, wider, and soon was deep enough to receive the body.\n\nThen the pallbearers approached.  Wrapped in white fabric made from\nfilaments of the fan mussel, the body was lowered into its watery grave.\nCaptain Nemo, arms crossed over his chest, knelt in a posture\nof prayer, as did all the friends of him who had loved them. . . .\nMy two companions and I bowed reverently.\n\nThe grave was then covered over with the rubble dug from the seafloor,\nand it formed a low mound.\n\nWhen this was done, Captain Nemo and his men stood up; then they\nall approached the grave, sank again on bended knee, and extended\ntheir hands in a sign of final farewell. . . .\n\nThen the funeral party went back up the path to the Nautilus,\nreturning beneath the arches of the forest, through the thickets,\nalong the coral bushes, going steadily higher.\n\nFinally the ship's rays appeared.  Their luminous trail guided us\nto the Nautilus.  By one o'clock we had returned.\n\nAfter changing clothes, I climbed onto the platform, and in the grip\nof dreadfully obsessive thoughts, I sat next to the beacon.\n\nCaptain Nemo rejoined me.  I stood up and said to him:\n\n\"So, as I predicted, that man died during the night?\"\n\n\"Yes, Professor Aronnax,\" Captain Nemo replied.\n\n\"And now he rests beside his companions in that coral cemetery?\"\n\n\"Yes, forgotten by the world but not by us!  We dig the graves,\nthen entrust the polyps with sealing away our dead for eternity!\"\n\nAnd with a sudden gesture, the captain hid his face in his clenched fists,\nvainly trying to hold back a sob.  Then he added:\n\n\"There lies our peaceful cemetery, hundreds of feet beneath\nthe surface of the waves!\"\n\n\"At least, captain, your dead can sleep serenely there, out of\nthe reach of sharks!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Captain Nemo replied solemnly, \"of sharks and men!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEND OF THE FIRST PART\n\n\n\n\n     *Author's Note:  About 106 meters.

And so Captain Nemo\nwould live out his life entirely in the heart of this immense sea,\nand even his grave lay ready in its impenetrable depths.\nThere the last sleep of the Nautilus's occupants, friends bound together\nin death as in life, would be disturbed by no monster of the deep!\n\"No man either!\" the captain had added.\n\nAlways that same fierce, implacable defiance of human society!\n\nAs for me, I was no longer content with the hypotheses\nthat satisfied Conseil.  That fine lad persisted in seeing\nthe Nautilus's commander as merely one of those unappreciated\nscientists who repay humanity's indifference with contempt.\nFor Conseil, the captain was still a misunderstood genius who,\ntired of the world's deceptions, had been driven to take refuge in this\ninaccessible environment where he was free to follow his instincts.\nBut to my mind, this hypothesis explained only one side of Captain Nemo.\n\nIn fact, the mystery of that last afternoon when we were locked in\nprison and put to sleep, the captain's violent precaution of snatching\nfrom my grasp a spyglass poised to scour the horizon, and the fatal\nwound given that man during some unexplained collision suffered\nby the Nautilus, all led me down a plain trail.  No!  Captain Nemo\nwasn't content simply to avoid humanity!  His fearsome submersible\nserved not only his quest for freedom, but also, perhaps, it was\nused in lord-knows-what schemes of dreadful revenge.\n\nRight now, nothing is clear to me, I still glimpse only glimmers\nin the dark, and I must limit my pen, as it were, to taking\ndictation from events.\n\nBut nothing binds us to Captain Nemo.  He believes that escaping from\nthe Nautilus is impossible.  We are not even constrained by our word\nof honor.  No promises fetter us.  We're simply captives, prisoners\nmasquerading under the name \"guests\" for the sake of everyday courtesy.\nEven so, Ned Land hasn't given up all hope of recovering his freedom.\nHe's sure to take advantage of the first chance that comes his way.\nNo doubt I will do likewise.  And yet I will feel some regret at making\noff with the Nautilus's secrets, so generously unveiled for us by\nCaptain Nemo!  Because, ultimately, should we detest or admire this man?\nIs he the persecutor or the persecuted?  And in all honesty,\nbefore I leave him forever, I want to finish this underwater\ntour of the world, whose first stages have been so magnificent.\nI want to observe the full series of these wonders gathered under\nthe seas of our globe.  I want to see what no man has seen yet,\neven if I must pay for this insatiable curiosity with my life!\nWhat are my discoveries to date?  Nothing, relatively speaking--\nsince so far we've covered only 6,000 leagues across the Pacific!\n\nNevertheless, I'm well aware that the Nautilus is drawing near\nto populated shores, and if some chance for salvation becomes\navailable to us, it would be sheer cruelty to sacrifice my\ncompanions to my passion for the unknown.  I must go with them,\nperhaps even guide them.  But will this opportunity ever arise?\nThe human being, robbed of his free will, craves such an opportunity;\nbut the scientist, forever inquisitive, dreads it.\n\nThat day, January 21, 1868, the chief officer went at noon to take\nthe sun's altitude.  I climbed onto the platform, lit a cigar,\nand watched him at work.  It seemed obvious to me that this man didn't\nunderstand French, because I made several remarks in a loud voice\nthat were bound to provoke him to some involuntary show of interest\nhad he understood them; but he remained mute and emotionless.\n\nWhile he took his sights with his sextant, one of the Nautilus's sailors--\nthat muscular man who had gone with us to Crespo Island during our first\nunderwater excursion--came up to clean the glass panes of the beacon.\nI then examined the fittings of this mechanism, whose power was\nincreased a hundredfold by biconvex lenses that were designed\nlike those in a lighthouse and kept its rays productively focused.\nThis electric lamp was so constructed as to yield its maximum\nilluminating power.  In essence, its light was generated in a vacuum,\ninsuring both its steadiness and intensity.  Such a vacuum also reduced\nwear on the graphite points between which the luminous arc expanded.\nThis was an important savings for Captain Nemo, who couldn't\neasily renew them.  But under these conditions, wear and tear\nwere almost nonexistent.\n\nWhen the Nautilus was ready to resume its underwater travels,\nI went below again to the lounge.  The hatches closed once more,\nand our course was set due west.\n\nWe then plowed the waves of the Indian Ocean, vast liquid plains\nwith an area of 550,000,000 hectares, whose waters are so transparent\nit makes you dizzy to lean over their surface.  There the Nautilus\ngenerally drifted at a depth between 100 and 200 meters.\nIt behaved in this way for some days.  To anyone without my grand\npassion for the sea, these hours would surely have seemed long\nand monotonous; but my daily strolls on the platform where I was\nrevived by the life-giving ocean air, the sights in the rich waters\nbeyond the lounge windows, the books to be read in the library,\nand the composition of my memoirs, took up all my time and left me\nwithout a moment of weariness or boredom.\n\nAll in all, we enjoyed a highly satisfactory state of health.\nThe diet on board agreed with us perfectly, and for my part,\nI could easily have gone without those changes of pace that Ned Land,\nin a spirit of protest, kept taxing his ingenuity to supply us.\nWhat's more, in this constant temperature we didn't even have to\nworry about catching colds.  Besides, the ship had a good stock of\nthe madrepore Dendrophylia, known in Provence by the name sea fennel,\nand a poultice made from the dissolved flesh of its polyps will\nfurnish an excellent cough medicine.\n\nFor some days we saw a large number of aquatic birds with webbed feet,\nknown as gulls or sea mews.  Some were skillfully slain, and when cooked\nin a certain fashion, they make a very acceptable platter of water game.\nAmong the great wind riders--carried over long distances from every\nshore and resting on the waves from their exhausting flights--\nI spotted some magnificent albatross, birds belonging to the Longipennes\n(long-winged) family, whose discordant calls sound like the braying\nof an ass.  The Totipalmes (fully webbed) family was represented\nby swift frigate birds, nimbly catching fish at the surface,\nand by numerous tropic birds of the genus Phaeton, among others\nthe red-tailed tropic bird, the size of a pigeon, its white plumage\nshaded with pink tints that contrasted with its dark-hued wings.\n\nThe Nautilus's nets hauled up several types of sea turtle from\nthe hawksbill genus with arching backs whose scales are highly prized.\nDiving easily, these reptiles can remain a good while underwater\nby closing the fleshy valves located at the external openings of their\nnasal passages.  When they were captured, some hawksbills were still\nasleep inside their carapaces, a refuge from other marine animals.\nThe flesh of these turtles was nothing memorable, but their eggs\nmade an excellent feast.\n\nAs for fish, they always filled us with wonderment when, staring through\nthe open panels, we could unveil the secrets of their aquatic lives.\nI noted several species I hadn't previously been able to observe.\n\nI'll mention chiefly some trunkfish unique to the Red Sea, the sea\nof the East Indies, and that part of the ocean washing the coasts\nof equinoctial America.  Like turtles, armadillos, sea urchins,\nand crustaceans, these fish are protected by armor plate that's\nneither chalky nor stony but actual bone.  Sometimes this armor takes\nthe shape of a solid triangle, sometimes that of a solid quadrangle.\nAmong the triangular type, I noticed some half a decimeter long,\nwith brown tails, yellow fins, and wholesome, exquisitely tasty flesh;\nI even recommend that they be acclimatized to fresh water, a change,\nincidentally, that a number of saltwater fish can make with ease.\nI'll also mention some quadrangular trunkfish topped by four large\nprotuberances along the back; trunkfish sprinkled with white spots on\nthe underside of the body, which make good house pets like certain birds;\nboxfish armed with stings formed by extensions of their bony crusts,\nand whose odd grunting has earned them the nickname \"sea pigs\";\nthen some trunkfish known as dromedaries, with tough, leathery flesh\nand big conical humps.\n\nFrom the daily notes kept by Mr. Conseil, I also retrieve\ncertain fish from the genus Tetradon unique to these seas:\nsouthern puffers with red backs and white chests distinguished by\nthree lengthwise rows of filaments, and jugfish, seven inches long,\ndecked out in the brightest colors.  Then, as specimens of other genera,\nblowfish resembling a dark brown egg, furrowed with white bands,\nand lacking tails; globefish, genuine porcupines of the sea,\narmed with stings and able to inflate themselves until they look\nlike a pin cushion bristling with needles; seahorses common to\nevery ocean; flying dragonfish with long snouts and highly distended\npectoral fins shaped like wings, which enable them, if not to fly,\nat least to spring into the air; spatula-shaped paddlefish whose\ntails are covered with many scaly rings; snipefish with long jaws,\nexcellent animals twenty-five centimeters long and gleaming with\nthe most cheerful colors; bluish gray dragonets with wrinkled heads;\nmyriads of leaping blennies with black stripes and long pectoral fins,\ngliding over the surface of the water with prodigious speed;\ndelicious sailfish that can hoist their fins in a favorable current\nlike so many unfurled sails; splendid nurseryfish on which nature\nhas lavished yellow, azure, silver, and gold; yellow mackerel\nwith wings made of filaments; bullheads forever spattered with mud,\nwhich make distinct hissing sounds; sea robins whose livers are thought\nto be poisonous; ladyfish that can flutter their eyelids; finally,\narcherfish with long, tubular snouts, real oceangoing flycatchers,\narmed with a rifle unforeseen by either Remington or Chassepot:\nit slays insects by shooting them with a simple drop of water.\n\nFrom the eighty-ninth fish genus in Lac\u00e9p\u010dde's system of classification,\nbelonging to his second subclass of bony fish (characterized by gill\ncovers and a bronchial membrane), I noted some scorpionfish whose\nheads are adorned with stings and which have only one dorsal fin;\nthese animals are covered with small scales, or have none at all,\ndepending on the subgenus to which they belong.  The second subgenus\ngave us some Didactylus specimens three to four decimeters long,\nstreaked with yellow, their heads having a phantasmagoric appearance.\nAs for the first subgenus, it furnished several specimens of that\nbizarre fish aptly nicknamed \"toadfish,\" whose big head is sometimes\ngouged with deep cavities, sometimes swollen with protuberances;\nbristling with stings and strewn with nodules, it sports hideously\nirregular horns; its body and tail are adorned with callosities;\nits stings can inflict dangerous injuries; it's repulsive and horrible.\n\nFrom January 21 to the 23rd, the Nautilus traveled at the rate of 250\nleagues in twenty-four hours, hence 540 miles at twenty-two miles\nper hour.  If, during our trip, we were able to identify these different\nvarieties of fish, it's because they were attracted by our electric\nlight and tried to follow alongside; but most of them were outdistanced\nby our speed and soon fell behind; temporarily, however, a few\nmanaged to keep pace in the Nautilus's waters.\n\nOn the morning of the 24th, in latitude 12 degrees 5'\nsouth and longitude 94 degrees 33', we raised Keeling Island,\na madreporic upheaving planted with magnificent coconut trees,\nwhich had been visited by Mr. Darwin and Captain Fitzroy.  The Nautilus\ncruised along a short distance off the shore of this desert island.\nOur dragnets brought up many specimens of polyps and echinoderms\nplus some unusual shells from the branch Mollusca.  Captain Nemo's\ntreasures were enhanced by some valuable exhibits from the delphinula\nsnail species, to which I joined some pointed star coral, a sort\nof parasitic polypary that often attaches itself to seashells.\n\nSoon Keeling Island disappeared below the horizon, and our course\nwas set to the northwest, toward the tip of the Indian peninsula.\n\n\"Civilization!\"  Ned Land told me that day.  \"Much better than\nthose Papuan Islands where we ran into more savages than venison!\nOn this Indian shore, professor, there are roads and railways,\nEnglish, French, and Hindu villages.  We wouldn't go five miles\nwithout bumping into a fellow countryman.  Come on now, isn't it\ntime for our sudden departure from Captain Nemo?\"\n\n\"No, no, Ned,\" I replied in a very firm tone.  \"Let's ride it out,\nas you seafaring fellows say.  The Nautilus is approaching\npopulated areas.  It's going back toward Europe, let it take us there.\nAfter we arrive in home waters, we can do as we see fit.\nBesides, I don't imagine Captain Nemo will let us go hunting\non the coasts of Malabar or Coromandel as he did in the forests\nof New Guinea.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, can't we manage without his permission?\"\n\nI didn't answer the Canadian.  I wanted no arguments.  Deep down,\nI was determined to fully exploit the good fortune that had put me\non board the Nautilus.\n\nAfter leaving Keeling Island, our pace got generally slower.\nIt also got more unpredictable, often taking us to great depths.\nSeveral times we used our slanting fins, which internal levers could\nset at an oblique angle to our waterline.  Thus we went as deep\nas two or three kilometers down but without ever verifying the lowest\ndepths of this sea near India, which soundings of 13,000 meters have\nbeen unable to reach.  As for the temperature in these lower strata,\nthe thermometer always and invariably indicated 4 degrees centigrade.\nI merely observed that in the upper layers, the water was always\ncolder over shallows than in the open sea.\n\nOn January 25, the ocean being completely deserted, the Nautilus spent\nthe day on the surface, churning the waves with its powerful propeller\nand making them spurt to great heights.  Under these conditions,\nwho wouldn't have mistaken it for a gigantic cetacean?  I spent\nthree-quarters of the day on the platform.  I stared at the sea.\nNothing on the horizon, except near four o'clock in the afternoon\na long steamer to the west, running on our opposite tack.\nIts masting was visible for an instant, but it couldn't have\nseen the Nautilus because we were lying too low in the water.\nI imagine that steamboat belonged to the Peninsular & Oriental line,\nwhich provides service from the island of Ceylon to Sidney,\nalso calling at King George Sound and Melbourne.\n\nAt five o'clock in the afternoon, just before that brief twilight\nthat links day with night in tropical zones, Conseil and I marveled\nat an unusual sight.\n\nIt was a delightful animal whose discovery, according to the ancients,\nis a sign of good luck.  Aristotle, Athenaeus, Pliny, and Oppian\nstudied its habits and lavished on its behalf all the scientific poetry\nof Greece and Italy.  They called it \"nautilus\" and \"pompilius.\"\nBut modern science has not endorsed these designations, and this\nmollusk is now known by the name argonaut.\n\nAnyone consulting Conseil would soon learn from the gallant lad\nthat the branch Mollusca is divided into five classes; that the first\nclass features the Cephalopoda (whose members are sometimes naked,\nsometimes covered with a shell), which consists of two families,\nthe Dibranchiata and the Tetrabranchiata, which are distinguished\nby their number of gills; that the family Dibranchiata includes\nthree genera, the argonaut, the squid, and the cuttlefish, and that\nthe family Tetrabranchiata contains only one genus, the nautilus.\nAfter this catalog, if some recalcitrant listener confuses\nthe argonaut, which is acetabuliferous (in other words, a bearer\nof suction tubes), with the nautilus, which is tentaculiferous\n(a bearer of tentacles), it will be simply unforgivable.\n\nNow, it was a school of argonauts then voyaging on the surface\nof the ocean.  We could count several hundred of them.\nThey belonged to that species of argonaut covered with protuberances\nand exclusive to the seas near India.\n\nThese graceful mollusks were swimming backward by means of their\nlocomotive tubes, sucking water into these tubes and then expelling it.\nSix of their eight tentacles were long, thin, and floated\non the water, while the other two were rounded into palms\nand spread to the wind like light sails.  I could see perfectly\ntheir undulating, spiral-shaped shells, which Cuvier aptly\ncompared to an elegant cockleboat.  It's an actual boat indeed.\nIt transports the animal that secretes it without the animal\nsticking to it.\n\n\"The argonaut is free to leave its shell,\" I told Conseil,\n\"but it never does.\"\n\n\"Not unlike Captain Nemo,\" Conseil replied sagely.  \"Which is why\nhe should have christened his ship the Argonaut.\"\n\nFor about an hour the Nautilus cruised in the midst of this school\nof mollusks.  Then, lord knows why, they were gripped with a sudden fear.\nAs if at a signal, every sail was abruptly lowered; arms folded,\nbodies contracted, shells turned over by changing their center\nof gravity, and the whole flotilla disappeared under the waves.\nIt was instantaneous, and no squadron of ships ever maneuvered\nwith greater togetherness.\n\nJust then night fell suddenly, and the waves barely surged in the breeze,\nspreading placidly around the Nautilus's side plates.\n\nThe next day, January 26, we cut the equator on the 82nd meridian\nand we reentered the northern hemisphere.\n\nDuring that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an escort.\nDreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them\nextremely dangerous.  There were Port Jackson sharks with a brown back,\na whitish belly, and eleven rows of teeth, bigeye sharks with necks\nmarked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye,\nand Isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark speckles.\nOften these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window with a\nviolence less than comforting.  By this point Ned Land had lost\nall self-control. He wanted to rise to the surface of the waves\nand harpoon the monsters, especially certain smooth-hound sharks whose\nmouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic, and some big\nfive-meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him.\nBut the Nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern\nthe fastest of these man-eaters.\n\nOn January 27, at the entrance to the huge Bay of Bengal,\nwe repeatedly encountered a gruesome sight:  human corpses floating\non the surface of the waves!  Carried by the Ganges to the high seas,\nthese were deceased Indian villagers who hadn't been fully devoured\nby vultures, the only morticians in these parts.  But there was no\nshortage of sharks to assist them with their undertaking chores.\n\nNear seven o'clock in the evening, the Nautilus lay\nhalf submerged, navigating in the midst of milky white waves.\nAs far as the eye could see, the ocean seemed lactified.\nWas it an effect of the moon's rays?  No, because the new moon was barely\ntwo days old and was still lost below the horizon in the sun's rays.\nThe entire sky, although lit up by stellar radiation, seemed pitch-black\nin comparison with the whiteness of these waters.\n\nConseil couldn't believe his eyes, and he questioned me about\nthe causes of this odd phenomenon.  Luckily I was in a position\nto answer him.\n\n\"That's called a milk sea,\" I told him, \"a vast expanse of white waves\noften seen along the coasts of Amboina and in these waterways.\"\n\n\"But,\" Conseil asked, \"could master tell me the cause of this effect,\nbecause I presume this water hasn't really changed into milk!\"\n\n\"No, my boy, and this whiteness that amazes you is merely due\nto the presence of myriads of tiny creatures called infusoria,\na sort of diminutive glowworm that's colorless and gelatinous\nin appearance, as thick as a strand of hair, and no longer than\none-fifth of a millimeter.  Some of these tiny creatures stick\ntogether over an area of several leagues.\"\n\n\"Several leagues!\"  Conseil exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, my boy, and don't even try to compute the number of\nthese infusoria.  You won't pull it off, because if I'm not mistaken,\ncertain navigators have cruised through milk seas for more\nthan forty miles.\"\n\nI'm not sure that Conseil heeded my recommendation, because he seemed\nto be deep in thought, no doubt trying to calculate how many\none-fifths of a millimeter are found in forty square miles.\nAs for me, I continued to observe this phenomenon.  For several\nhours the Nautilus's spur sliced through these whitish waves,\nand I watched it glide noiselessly over this soapy water, as if it\nwere cruising through those foaming eddies that a bay's currents\nand countercurrents sometimes leave between each other.\n\nNear midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual hue, but behind us\nall the way to the horizon, the skies kept mirroring the whiteness\nof those waves and for a good while seemed imbued with the hazy\nglow of an aurora borealis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nA New Proposition from Captain Nemo\n\nON JANUARY 28, in latitude 9 degrees 4' north, when the Nautilus returned\nat noon to the surface of the sea, it lay in sight of land some eight\nmiles to the west.  Right off, I observed a cluster of mountains\nabout 2,000 feet high, whose shapes were very whimsically sculpted.\nAfter our position fix, I reentered the lounge, and when our bearings\nwere reported on the chart, I saw that we were off the island of Ceylon,\nthat pearl dangling from the lower lobe of the Indian peninsula.\n\nI went looking in the library for a book about this island, one of\nthe most fertile in the world.  Sure enough, I found a volume entitled\nCeylon and the Singhalese by H. C. Sirr, Esq. Reentering the lounge,\nI first noted the bearings of Ceylon, on which antiquity lavished\nso many different names.  It was located between latitude 5 degrees 55'\nand 9 degrees 49' north, and between longitude 79 degrees 42'\nand 82 degrees 4' east of the meridian of Greenwich; its length\nis 275 miles; its maximum width, 150 miles; its circumference,\n900 miles; its surface area, 24,448 square miles, in other words,\na little smaller than that of Ireland.\n\nJust then Captain Nemo and his chief officer appeared.\n\nThe captain glanced at the chart.  Then, turning to me:\n\n\"The island of Ceylon,\" he said, \"is famous for its pearl fisheries.\nWould you be interested, Professor Aronnax, in visiting one\nof those fisheries?\"\n\n\"Certainly, captain.\"\n\n\"Fine.  It's easily done.  Only, when we see the fisheries,\nwe'll see no fishermen.  The annual harvest hasn't yet begun.\nNo matter.  I'll give orders to make for the Gulf of Mannar,\nand we'll arrive there late tonight.\"\n\nThe captain said a few words to his chief officer who went\nout immediately.  Soon the Nautilus reentered its liquid element,\nand the pressure gauge indicated that it was staying at a depth\nof thirty feet.\n\nWith the chart under my eyes, I looked for the Gulf of Mannar.  I found\nit by the 9th parallel off the northwestern shores of Ceylon.  It was\nformed by the long curve of little Mannar Island.  To reach it we\nhad to go all the way up Ceylon's west coast.\n\n\"Professor,\" Captain Nemo then told me, \"there are pearl fisheries\nin the Bay of Bengal, the seas of the East Indies, the seas\nof China and Japan, plus those seas south of the United States,\nthe Gulf of Panama and the Gulf of California; but it's off Ceylon\nthat such fishing reaps its richest rewards.  No doubt we'll be\narriving a little early.  Fishermen gather in the Gulf of Mannar\nonly during the month of March, and for thirty days some 300 boats\nconcentrate on the lucrative harvest of these treasures from the sea.\nEach boat is manned by ten oarsmen and ten fishermen.\nThe latter divide into two groups, dive in rotation, and descend\nto a depth of twelve meters with the help of a heavy stone clutched\nbetween their feet and attached by a rope to their boat.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" I said, \"that such primitive methods are still all\nthat they use?\"\n\n\"All,\" Captain Nemo answered me, \"although these fisheries belong\nto the most industrialized people in the world, the English,\nto whom the Treaty of Amiens granted them in 1802.\"\n\n\"Yet it strikes me that diving suits like yours could perform yeoman\nservice in such work.\"\n\n\"Yes, since those poor fishermen can't stay long underwater.\nOn his voyage to Ceylon, the Englishman Percival made much of a Kaffir\nwho stayed under five minutes without coming up to the surface,\nbut I find that hard to believe.  I know that some divers can last up\nto fifty-seven seconds, and highly skillful ones to eighty-seven;\nbut such men are rare, and when the poor fellows climb back on board,\nthe water coming out of their noses and ears is tinted with blood.\nI believe the average time underwater that these fishermen can\ntolerate is thirty seconds, during which they hastily stuff\ntheir little nets with all the pearl oysters they can tear loose.\nBut these fishermen generally don't live to advanced age:\ntheir vision weakens, ulcers break out on their eyes, sores form\non their bodies, and some are even stricken with apoplexy on\nthe ocean floor.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"it's a sad occupation, and one that exists only\nto gratify the whims of fashion.  But tell me, captain, how many\noysters can a boat fish up in a workday?\"\n\n\"About 40,000 to 50,000. It's even said that in 1814, when the English\ngovernment went fishing on its own behalf, its divers worked just\ntwenty days and brought up 76,000,000 oysters.\"\n\n\"At least,\" I asked, \"the fishermen are well paid, aren't they?\"\n\n\"Hardly, professor.  In Panama they make just $1.00 per week.\nIn most places they earn only a penny for each oyster that has a pearl,\nand they bring up so many that have none!\"\n\n\"Only one penny to those poor people who make their employers rich!\nThat's atrocious!\"\n\n\"On that note, professor,\" Captain Nemo told me, \"you and your\ncompanions will visit the Mannar oysterbank, and if by chance some\neager fisherman arrives early, well, we can watch him at work.\"\n\n\"That suits me, captain.\"\n\n\"By the way, Professor Aronnax, you aren't afraid of sharks, are you?\"\n\n\"Sharks?\"  I exclaimed.\n\nThis struck me as a pretty needless question, to say the least.\n\n\"Well?\"  Captain Nemo went on.\n\n\"I admit, captain, I'm not yet on very familiar terms with that\ngenus of fish.\"\n\n\"We're used to them, the rest of us,\" Captain Nemo answered.\n\"And in time you will be too.  Anyhow, we'll be armed, and on our\nway we might hunt a man-eater or two.  It's a fascinating sport.\nSo, professor, I'll see you tomorrow, bright and early.\"\n\nThis said in a carefree tone, Captain Nemo left the lounge.\n\nIf you're invited to hunt bears in the Swiss mountains, you might say:\n\"Oh good, I get to go bear hunting tomorrow!\"  If you're invited\nto hunt lions on the Atlas plains or tigers in the jungles of India,\nyou might say:  \"Ha!  Now's my chance to hunt lions and tigers!\"\nBut if you're invited to hunt sharks in their native element,\nyou might want to think it over before accepting.\n\nAs for me, I passed a hand over my brow, where beads of cold sweat\nwere busy forming.\n\n\"Let's think this over,\" I said to myself, \"and let's take our time.\nHunting otters in underwater forests, as we did in the forests\nof Crespo Island, is an acceptable activity.  But to roam\nthe bottom of the sea when you're almost certain to meet man-eaters\nin the neighborhood, that's another story!  I know that in\ncertain countries, particularly the Andaman Islands, Negroes don't\nhesitate to attack sharks, dagger in one hand and noose in the other;\nbut I also know that many who face those fearsome animals don't come\nback alive.  Besides, I'm not a Negro, and even if I were a Negro,\nin this instance I don't think a little hesitation on my part would\nbe out of place.\"\n\nAnd there I was, fantasizing about sharks, envisioning huge jaws armed\nwith multiple rows of teeth and capable of cutting a man in half.\nI could already feel a definite pain around my pelvic girdle.\nAnd how I resented the offhand manner in which the captain had\nextended his deplorable invitation!  You would have thought it\nwas an issue of going into the woods on some harmless fox hunt!\n\n\"Thank heavens!\"  I said to myself.  \"Conseil will never want to\ncome along, and that'll be my excuse for not going with the captain.\"\n\nAs for Ned Land, I admit I felt less confident of his wisdom.\nDanger, however great, held a perennial attraction for\nhis aggressive nature.\n\nI went back to reading Sirr's book, but I leafed through it mechanically.\nBetween the lines I kept seeing fearsome, wide-open jaws.\n\nJust then Conseil and the Canadian entered with a calm, even gleeful air.\nLittle did they know what was waiting for them.\n\n\"Ye gods, sir!\"  Ned Land told me.  \"Your Captain Nemo--the devil\ntake him--has just made us a very pleasant proposition!\"\n\n\"Oh!\"  I said \"You know about--\"\n\n\"With all due respect to master,\" Conseil replied, \"the Nautilus's\ncommander has invited us, together with master, for a visit tomorrow\nto Ceylon's magnificent pearl fisheries.  He did so in the most\ncordial terms and conducted himself like a true gentleman.\"\n\n\"He didn't tell you anything else?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir,\" the Canadian replied.  \"He said you'd already\ndiscussed this little stroll.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" I said.  \"But didn't he give you any details on--\"\n\n\"Not a one, Mr. Naturalist.  You will be going with us, right?\"\n\n\"Me?  Why yes, certainly, of course!  I can see that you like\nthe idea, Mr. Land.\"\n\n\"Yes!  It will be a really unusual experience!\"\n\n\"And possibly dangerous!\"  I added in an insinuating tone.\n\n\"Dangerous?\"  Ned Land replied.  \"A simple trip to an oysterbank?\"\n\nAssuredly, Captain Nemo hadn't seen fit to plant the idea of sharks\nin the minds of my companions.  For my part, I stared at them\nwith anxious eyes, as if they were already missing a limb or two.\nShould I alert them?  Yes, surely, but I hardly knew how to go about it.\n\n\"Would master,\" Conseil said to me, \"give us some background\non pearl fishing?\"\n\n\"On the fishing itself?\"  I asked.  \"Or on the occupational hazards that--\"\n\n\"On the fishing,\" the Canadian replied.  \"Before we tackle the terrain,\nit helps to be familiar with it.\"\n\n\"All right, sit down, my friends, and I'll teach you everything I\nmyself have just been taught by the Englishman H. C. Sirr!\"\n\nNed and Conseil took seats on a couch, and right off the Canadian\nsaid to me:\n\n\"Sir, just what is a pearl exactly?\"\n\n\"My gallant Ned,\" I replied, \"for poets a pearl is a tear from the sea;\nfor Orientals it's a drop of solidified dew; for the ladies it's\na jewel they can wear on their fingers, necks, and ears that's\noblong in shape, glassy in luster, and formed from mother-of-pearl;\nfor chemists it's a mixture of calcium phosphate and calcium\ncarbonate with a little gelatin protein; and finally, for naturalists\nit's a simple festering secretion from the organ that produces\nmother-of-pearl in certain bivalves.\"\n\n\"Branch Mollusca,\" Conseil said, \"class Acephala, order Testacea.\"\n\n\"Correct, my scholarly Conseil.  Now then, those Testacea capable\nof producing pearls include rainbow abalone, turbo snails,\ngiant clams, and saltwater scallops--briefly, all those that secrete\nmother-of-pearl, in other words, that blue, azure, violet, or white\nsubstance lining the insides of their valves.\"\n\n\"Are mussels included too?\" the Canadian asked.\n\n\"Yes!  The mussels of certain streams in Scotland, Wales, Ireland,\nSaxony, Bohemia, and France.\"\n\n\"Good!\" the Canadian replied.  \"From now on we'll pay closer\nattention to 'em.\"\n\n\"But,\" I went on, \"for secreting pearls, the ideal mollusk is the pearl\noyster Meleagrina margaritifera, that valuable shellfish.  Pearls result\nsimply from mother-of-pearl solidifying into a globular shape.\nEither they stick to the oyster's shell, or they become embedded\nin the creature's folds.  On the valves a pearl sticks fast;\non the flesh it lies loose.  But its nucleus is always some small,\nhard object, say a sterile egg or a grain of sand, around which\nthe mother-of-pearl is deposited in thin, concentric layers over\nseveral years in succession.\"\n\n\"Can one find several pearls in the same oyster?\"  Conseil asked.\n\n\"Yes, my boy.  There are some shellfish that turn into real\njewel coffers.  They even mention one oyster, about which I\nremain dubious, that supposedly contained at least 150 sharks.\"\n\n\"150 sharks!\"  Ned Land yelped.\n\n\"Did I say sharks?\"  I exclaimed hastily.  \"I meant 150 pearls.\nSharks wouldn't make sense.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Conseil said.  \"But will master now tell us how one goes\nabout extracting these pearls?\"\n\n\"One proceeds in several ways, and often when pearls stick\nto the valves, fishermen even pull them loose with pliers.\nBut usually the shellfish are spread out on mats made from the esparto\ngrass that covers the beaches.  Thus they die in the open air,\nand by the end of ten days they've rotted sufficiently.  Next they're\nimmersed in huge tanks of salt water, then they're opened up and washed.\nAt this point the sorters begin their twofold task.  First they\nremove the layers of mother-of-pearl, which are known in the industry\nby the names legitimate silver, bastard white, or bastard black,\nand these are shipped out in cases weighing 125 to 150 kilograms.\nThen they remove the oyster's meaty tissue, boil it, and finally\nstrain it, in order to extract even the smallest pearls.\"\n\n\"Do the prices of these pearls differ depending on their size?\"\nConseil asked.\n\n\"Not only on their size,\" I replied, \"but also according to their shape,\ntheir water--in other words, their color--and their orient--\nin other words, that dappled, shimmering glow that makes them so\ndelightful to the eye.  The finest pearls are called virgin pearls,\nor paragons; they form in isolation within the mollusk's tissue.\nThey're white, often opaque but sometimes of opalescent transparency,\nand usually spherical or pear-shaped. The spherical ones\nare made into bracelets; the pear-shaped ones into earrings,\nand since they're the most valuable, they're priced individually.\nThe other pearls that stick to the oyster's shell are more erratically\nshaped and are priced by weight.  Finally, classed in the lowest order,\nthe smallest pearls are known by the name seed pearls; they're priced\nby the measuring cup and are used mainly in the creation of embroidery\nfor church vestments.\"\n\n\"But it must be a long, hard job, sorting out these pearls by size,\"\nthe Canadian said.\n\n\"No, my friend.  That task is performed with eleven strainers,\nor sieves, that are pierced with different numbers of holes.\nThose pearls staying in the strainers with twenty to eighty holes\nare in the first order.  Those not slipping through the sieves pierced\nwith 100 to 800 holes are in the second order.  Finally, those pearls\nfor which one uses strainers pierced with 900 to 1,000 holes make\nup the seed pearls.\"\n\n\"How ingenious,\" Conseil said, \"to reduce dividing and classifying\npearls to a mechanical operation.  And could master tell us the profits\nbrought in by harvesting these banks of pearl oysters?\"\n\n\"According to Sirr's book,\" I replied, \"these Ceylon fisheries\nare farmed annually for a total profit of 3,000,000 man-eaters.\"\n\n\"Francs!\"  Conseil rebuked.\n\n\"Yes, francs! 3,000,000 francs!\"  I went on.  \"But I don't\nthink these fisheries bring in the returns they once did.\nSimilarly, the Central American fisheries used to make an annual\nprofit of 4,000,000 francs during the reign of King Charles V,\nbut now they bring in only two-thirds of that amount.  All in all,\nit's estimated that 9,000,000 francs is the current yearly return\nfor the whole pearl-harvesting industry.\"\n\n\"But,\" Conseil asked, \"haven't certain famous pearls been quoted\nat extremely high prices?\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy.  They say Julius Caesar gave Servilia a pearl worth\n120,000 francs in our currency.\"\n\n\"I've even heard stories,\" the Canadian said, \"about some lady\nin ancient times who drank pearls in vinegar.\"\n\n\"Cleopatra,\" Conseil shot back.\n\n\"It must have tasted pretty bad,\" Ned Land added.\n\n\"Abominable, Ned my friend,\" Conseil replied.  \"But when a little\nglass of vinegar is worth 1,500,000 francs, its taste is a small\nprice to pay.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry I didn't marry the gal,\" the Canadian said, throwing up\nhis hands with an air of discouragement.\n\n\"Ned Land married to Cleopatra?\"  Conseil exclaimed.\n\n\"But I was all set to tie the knot, Conseil,\" the Canadian replied in\nall seriousness, \"and it wasn't my fault the whole business fell through.\nI even bought a pearl necklace for my fianc\u00e9e, Kate Tender,\nbut she married somebody else instead.  Well, that necklace cost\nme only $1.50, but you can absolutely trust me on this, professor,\nits pearls were so big, they wouldn't have gone through that strainer\nwith twenty holes.\"\n\n\"My gallant Ned,\" I replied, laughing, \"those were artificial pearls,\nordinary glass beads whose insides were coated with Essence of Orient.\"\n\n\"Wow!\" the Canadian replied.  \"That Essence of Orient must sell\nfor quite a large sum.\"\n\n\"As little as zero!  It comes from the scales of a European carp,\nit's nothing more than a silver substance that collects in the water\nand is preserved in ammonia.  It's worthless.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's why Kate Tender married somebody else,\"\nreplied Mr. Land philosophically.\n\n\"But,\" I said, \"getting back to pearls of great value, I don't\nthink any sovereign ever possessed one superior to the pearl owned\nby Captain Nemo.\"\n\n\"This one?\"  Conseil said, pointing to a magnificent jewel in\nits glass case.\n\n\"Exactly.  And I'm certainly not far off when I estimate its value\nat 2,000,000 . . . uh . . .\"\n\n\"Francs!\"  Conseil said quickly.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"2,000,000 francs, and no doubt all it cost our\ncaptain was the effort to pick it up.\"\n\n\"Ha!\"  Ned Land exclaimed.  \"During our stroll tomorrow, who says\nwe won't run into one just like it?\"\n\n\"Bah!\"  Conseil put in.\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"What good would a pearl worth millions do us here on the Nautilus?\"\n\n\"Here, no,\" Ned Land said.  \"But elsewhere. . . .\"\n\n\"Oh!  Elsewhere!\"  Conseil put in, shaking his head.\n\n\"In fact,\" I said, \"Mr. Land is right.  And if we ever brought back\nto Europe or America a pearl worth millions, it would make the story\nof our adventures more authentic--and much more rewarding.\"\n\n\"That's how I see it,\" the Canadian said.\n\n\"But,\" said Conseil, who perpetually returned to the didactic side\nof things, \"is this pearl fishing ever dangerous?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied quickly, \"especially if one takes certain precautions.\"\n\n\"What risks would you run in a job like that?\"  Ned Land said.\n\"Swallowing a few gulps of salt water?\"\n\n\"Whatever you say, Ned.\"  Then, trying to imitate Captain Nemo's\ncarefree tone, I asked, \"By the way, gallant Ned, are you\nafraid of sharks?\"\n\n\"Me?\" the Canadian replied.  \"I'm a professional harpooner!\nIt's my job to make a mockery of them!\"\n\n\"It isn't an issue,\" I said, \"of fishing for them with a swivel hook,\nhoisting them onto the deck of a ship, chopping off the tail\nwith a sweep of the ax, opening the belly, ripping out the heart,\nand tossing it into the sea.\"\n\n\"So it's an issue of . . . ?\"\n\n\"Yes, precisely.\"\n\n\"In the water?\"\n\n\"In the water.\"\n\n\"Ye gods, just give me a good harpoon!  You see, sir, these sharks\nare badly designed.  They have to roll their bellies over to snap\nyou up, and in the meantime . . .\"\n\nNed Land had a way of pronouncing the word \"snap\" that sent chills\ndown the spine.\n\n\"Well, how about you, Conseil?  What are your feelings\nabout these man-eaters?\"\n\n\"Me?\"  Conseil said.  \"I'm afraid I must be frank with master.\"\n\nGood for you, I thought.\n\n\"If master faces these sharks,\" Conseil said, \"I think his loyal\nmanservant should face them with him!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nA Pearl Worth Ten Million\n\n\n\nNIGHT FELL.  I went to bed.  I slept pretty poorly.  Man-eaters played\na major role in my dreams.  And I found it more or less appropriate\nthat the French word for shark, requin, has its linguistic roots\nin the word requiem.\n\nThe next day at four o'clock in the morning, I was awakened by\nthe steward whom Captain Nemo had placed expressly at my service.\nI got up quickly, dressed, and went into the lounge.\n\nCaptain Nemo was waiting for me.\n\n\"Professor Aronnax,\" he said to me, \"are you ready to start?\"\n\n\"I'm ready.\"\n\n\"Kindly follow me.\"\n\n\"What about my companions, captain?\"\n\n\"They've been alerted and are waiting for us.\"\n\n\"Aren't we going to put on our diving suits?\"  I asked.\n\n\"Not yet.  I haven't let the Nautilus pull too near the coast,\nand we're fairly well out from the Mannar oysterbank.\nBut I have the skiff ready, and it will take us to the exact spot\nwhere we'll disembark, which will save us a pretty long trek.\nIt's carrying our diving equipment, and we'll suit up just before we\nbegin our underwater exploring.\"\n\nCaptain Nemo took me to the central companionway whose steps led\nto the platform.  Ned and Conseil were there, enraptured with\nthe \"pleasure trip\" getting under way.  Oars in position,\nfive of the Nautilus's sailors were waiting for us aboard the skiff,\nwhich was moored alongside.  The night was still dark.\nLayers of clouds cloaked the sky and left only a few stars in view.\nMy eyes flew to the side where land lay, but I saw only a blurred line\ncovering three-quarters of the horizon from southwest to northwest.\nGoing up Ceylon's west coast during the night, the Nautilus lay\nwest of the bay, or rather that gulf formed by the mainland\nand Mannar Island.  Under these dark waters there stretched\nthe bank of shellfish, an inexhaustible field of pearls more than\ntwenty miles long.\n\nCaptain Nemo, Conseil, Ned Land, and I found seats in the stern\nof the skiff.  The longboat's coxswain took the tiller; his four\ncompanions leaned into their oars; the moorings were cast off\nand we pulled clear.\n\nThe skiff headed southward.  The oarsmen took their time.\nI watched their strokes vigorously catch the water, and they\nalways waited ten seconds before rowing again, following the\npractice used in most navies.  While the longboat coasted,\ndrops of liquid flicked from the oars and hit the dark troughs\nof the waves, pitter-pattering like splashes of molten lead.\nComing from well out, a mild swell made the skiff roll gently,\nand a few cresting billows lapped at its bow.\n\nWe were silent.  What was Captain Nemo thinking?  Perhaps that\nthis approaching shore was too close for comfort, contrary to\nthe Canadian's views in which it still seemed too far away.\nAs for Conseil, he had come along out of simple curiosity.\n\nNear 5:30 the first glimmers of light on the horizon defined\nthe upper lines of the coast with greater distinctness.\nFairly flat to the east, it swelled a little toward the south.\nFive miles still separated it from us, and its beach merged with\nthe misty waters.  Between us and the shore, the sea was deserted.\nNot a boat, not a diver.  Profound solitude reigned over this\ngathering place of pearl fishermen.  As Captain Nemo had commented,\nwe were arriving in these waterways a month too soon.\n\nAt six o'clock the day broke suddenly, with that speed unique\nto tropical regions, which experience no real dawn or dusk.\nThe sun's rays pierced the cloud curtain gathered on the easterly horizon,\nand the radiant orb rose swiftly.\n\nI could clearly see the shore, which featured a few sparse trees\nhere and there.\n\nThe skiff advanced toward Mannar Island, which curved to the south.\nCaptain Nemo stood up from his thwart and studied the sea.\n\nAt his signal the anchor was lowered, but its chain barely ran\nbecause the bottom lay no more than a meter down, and this locality\nwas one of the shallowest spots near the bank of shellfish.\nInstantly the skiff wheeled around under the ebb tide's outbound thrust.\n\n\"Here we are, Professor Aronnax,\" Captain Nemo then said.\n\"You observe this confined bay?  A month from now in this very place,\nthe numerous fishing boats of the harvesters will gather,\nand these are the waters their divers will ransack so daringly.\nThis bay is felicitously laid out for their type of fishing.\nIt's sheltered from the strongest winds, and the sea is never\nvery turbulent here, highly favorable conditions for diving work.\nNow let's put on our underwater suits, and we'll begin our stroll.\"\n\nI didn't reply, and while staring at these suspicious waves, I began\nto put on my heavy aquatic clothes, helped by the longboat's sailors.\nCaptain Nemo and my two companions suited up as well.\nNone of the Nautilus's men were to go with us on this new excursion.\n\nSoon we were imprisoned up to the neck in india-rubber clothing,\nand straps fastened the air devices onto our backs.\nAs for the Ruhmkorff device, it didn't seem to be in the picture.\nBefore inserting my head into its copper capsule, I commented\non this to the captain.\n\n\"Our lighting equipment would be useless to us,\" the captain answered me.\n\"We won't be going very deep, and the sun's rays will be sufficient\nto light our way.  Besides, it's unwise to carry electric lanterns\nunder these waves.  Their brightness might unexpectedly attract\ncertain dangerous occupants of these waterways.\"\n\nAs Captain Nemo pronounced these words, I turned to Conseil and\nNed Land.  But my two friends had already encased their craniums\nin their metal headgear, and they could neither hear nor reply.\n\nI had one question left to address to Captain Nemo.\n\n\"What about our weapons?\"  I asked him.  \"Our rifles?\"\n\n\"Rifles!  What for?  Don't your mountaineers attack bears dagger in hand?\nAnd isn't steel surer than lead?  Here's a sturdy blade.\nSlip it under your belt and let's be off.\"\n\nI stared at my companions.  They were armed in the same fashion,\nand Ned Land was also brandishing an enormous harpoon he had stowed\nin the skiff before leaving the Nautilus.\n\nThen, following the captain's example, I let myself be crowned with my\nheavy copper sphere, and our air tanks immediately went into action.\n\nAn instant later, the longboat's sailors helped us overboard one after\nthe other, and we set foot on level sand in a meter and a half of water.\nCaptain Nemo gave us a hand signal.  We followed him down a gentle\nslope and disappeared under the waves.\n\nThere the obsessive fears in my brain left me.  I became surprisingly\ncalm again.  The ease with which I could move increased my confidence,\nand the many strange sights captivated my imagination.\n\nThe sun was already sending sufficient light under these waves.\nThe tiniest objects remained visible.  After ten minutes of walking,\nwe were in five meters of water, and the terrain had become almost flat.\n\nLike a covey of snipe over a marsh, there rose underfoot schools\nof unusual fish from the genus Monopterus, whose members have no fin\nbut their tail.  I recognized the Javanese eel, a genuine eight-decimeter\nserpent with a bluish gray belly, which, without the gold lines\nover its flanks, could easily be confused with the conger eel.\nFrom the butterfish genus, whose oval bodies are very flat,\nI observed several adorned in brilliant colors and sporting a dorsal\nfin like a sickle, edible fish that, when dried and marinated, make an\nexcellent dish known by the name \"karawade\"; then some sea poachers,\nfish belonging to the genus Aspidophoroides, whose bodies are covered\nwith scaly armor divided into eight lengthwise sections.\n\nMeanwhile, as the sun got progressively higher, it lit up the watery\nmass more and more.  The seafloor changed little by little.\nIts fine-grained sand was followed by a genuine causeway\nof smooth crags covered by a carpet of mollusks and zoophytes.\nAmong other specimens in these two branches, I noted some windowpane\noysters with thin valves of unequal size, a type of ostracod unique\nto the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, then orange-hued lucina with\ncircular shells, awl-shaped auger shells, some of those Persian\nmurex snails that supply the Nautilus with such wonderful dye,\nspiky periwinkles fifteen centimeters long that rose under the waves\nlike hands ready to grab you, turban snails with shells made of horn\nand bristling all over with spines, lamp shells, edible duck clams\nthat feed the Hindu marketplace, subtly luminous jellyfish of the species\nPelagia panopyra, and finally some wonderful Oculina flabelliforma,\nmagnificent sea fans that fashion one of the most luxuriant tree\nforms in this ocean.\n\nIn the midst of this moving vegetation, under arbors of water plants,\nthere raced legions of clumsy articulates, in particular some fanged\nfrog crabs whose carapaces form a slightly rounded triangle,\nrobber crabs exclusive to these waterways, and horrible\nparthenope crabs whose appearance was repulsive to the eye.\nOne animal no less hideous, which I encountered several times,\nwas the enormous crab that Mr. Darwin observed, to which nature\nhas given the instinct and requisite strength to eat coconuts;\nit scrambles up trees on the beach and sends the coconuts tumbling;\nthey fracture in their fall and are opened by its powerful pincers.\nHere, under these clear waves, this crab raced around with\nmatchless agility, while green turtles from the species frequenting\nthe Malabar coast moved sluggishly among the crumbling rocks.\n\nNear seven o'clock we finally surveyed the bank of shellfish,\nwhere pearl oysters reproduce by the millions.  These valuable\nmollusks stick to rocks, where they're strongly attached\nby a mass of brown filaments that forbids their moving about.\nIn this respect oysters are inferior even to mussels, to whom nature\nhas not denied all talent for locomotion.\n\nThe shellfish Meleagrina, that womb for pearls whose valves are\nnearly equal in size, has the shape of a round shell with thick\nwalls and a very rough exterior.  Some of these shells were furrowed\nwith flaky, greenish bands that radiated down from the top.\nThese were the young oysters.  The others had rugged black surfaces,\nmeasured up to fifteen centimeters in width, and were ten or\nmore years old.\n\nCaptain Nemo pointed to this prodigious heap of shellfish, and I\nsaw that these mines were genuinely inexhaustible, since nature's\ncreative powers are greater than man's destructive instincts.\nTrue to those instincts, Ned Land greedily stuffed the finest\nof these mollusks into a net he carried at his side.\n\nBut we couldn't stop.  We had to follow the captain,\nwho headed down trails seemingly known only to himself.\nThe seafloor rose noticeably, and when I lifted my arms,\nsometimes they would pass above the surface of the sea.\nThen the level of the oysterbank would lower unpredictably.\nOften we went around tall, pointed rocks rising like pyramids.\nIn their dark crevices huge crustaceans, aiming their long legs\nlike heavy artillery, watched us with unblinking eyes, while underfoot\nthere crept millipedes, bloodworms, aricia worms, and annelid worms,\nwhose antennas and tubular tentacles were incredibly long.\n\nJust then a huge cave opened up in our path, hollowed from a\npicturesque pile of rocks whose smooth heights were completely\nhung with underwater flora.  At first this cave looked pitch-black\nto me.  Inside, the sun's rays seemed to diminish by degrees.\nTheir hazy transparency was nothing more than drowned light.\n\nCaptain Nemo went in.  We followed him.  My eyes soon grew accustomed\nto this comparative gloom.  I distinguished the unpredictably contoured\nspringings of a vault, supported by natural pillars firmly based on\na granite foundation, like the weighty columns of Tuscan architecture.\nWhy had our incomprehensible guide taken us into the depths of this\nunderwater crypt?  I would soon find out.\n\nAfter going down a fairly steep slope, our feet trod the floor\nof a sort of circular pit.  There Captain Nemo stopped, and his hand\nindicated an object that I hadn't yet noticed.\n\nIt was an oyster of extraordinary dimensions, a titanic giant clam,\na holy-water font that could have held a whole lake, a basin\nmore than two meters wide, hence even bigger than the one adorning\nthe Nautilus's lounge.\n\nI approached this phenomenal mollusk.  Its mass of filaments attached\nit to a table of granite, and there it grew by itself in the midst\nof the cave's calm waters.  I estimated the weight of this giant clam\nat 300 kilograms.  Hence such an oyster held fifteen kilos of meat,\nand you'd need the stomach of King Gargantua to eat a couple dozen.\n\nCaptain Nemo was obviously familiar with this bivalve's existence.\nThis wasn't the first time he'd paid it a visit, and I thought\nhis sole reason for leading us to this locality was to show\nus a natural curiosity.  I was mistaken.  Captain Nemo had an\nexplicit personal interest in checking on the current condition\nof this giant clam.\n\nThe mollusk's two valves were partly open.  The captain approached\nand stuck his dagger vertically between the shells to discourage\nany ideas about closing; then with his hands he raised the fringed,\nmembrane-filled tunic that made up the animal's mantle.\n\nThere, between its leaflike folds, I saw a loose pearl as big as\na coconut.  Its globular shape, perfect clarity, and wonderful orient\nmade it a jewel of incalculable value.  Carried away by curiosity,\nI stretched out my hand to take it, weigh it, fondle it!\nBut the captain stopped me, signaled no, removed his dagger in one\nswift motion, and let the two valves snap shut.\n\nI then understood Captain Nemo's intent.  By leaving the pearl buried\nbeneath the giant clam's mantle, he allowed it to grow imperceptibly.\nWith each passing year the mollusk's secretions added new\nconcentric layers.  The captain alone was familiar with the cave\nwhere this wonderful fruit of nature was \"ripening\"; he alone\nreared it, so to speak, in order to transfer it one day to his\ndearly beloved museum.  Perhaps, following the examples of oyster\nfarmers in China and India, he had even predetermined the creation\nof this pearl by sticking under the mollusk's folds some piece\nof glass or metal that was gradually covered with mother-of-pearl.\nIn any case, comparing this pearl to others I already knew about,\nand to those shimmering in the captain's collection, I estimated\nthat it was worth at least 10,000,000 francs.  It was a superb\nnatural curiosity rather than a luxurious piece of jewelry,\nbecause I don't know of any female ear that could handle it.\n\nOur visit to this opulent giant clam came to an end.\nCaptain Nemo left the cave, and we climbed back up the bank\nof shellfish in the midst of these clear waters not yet disturbed\nby divers at work.\n\nWe walked by ourselves, genuine loiterers stopping or straying\nas our fancies dictated.  For my part, I was no longer worried\nabout those dangers my imagination had so ridiculously exaggerated.\nThe shallows drew noticeably closer to the surface of the sea,\nand soon, walking in only a meter of water, my head passed well above\nthe level of the ocean.  Conseil rejoined me, and gluing his huge\ncopper capsule to mine, his eyes gave me a friendly greeting.\nBut this lofty plateau measured only a few fathoms, and soon we\nreentered Our Element.  I think I've now earned the right to\ndub it that.\n\nTen minutes later, Captain Nemo stopped suddenly.  I thought he'd\ncalled a halt so that we could turn and start back.  No. With a gesture\nhe ordered us to crouch beside him at the foot of a wide crevice.\nHis hand motioned toward a spot within the liquid mass,\nand I looked carefully.\n\nFive meters away a shadow appeared and dropped to the seafloor.\nThe alarming idea of sharks crossed my mind.  But I was mistaken,\nand once again we didn't have to deal with monsters of the deep.\n\nIt was a man, a living man, a black Indian fisherman, a poor devil\nwho no doubt had come to gather what he could before harvest time.\nI saw the bottom of his dinghy, moored a few feet above his head.\nHe would dive and go back up in quick succession.  A stone cut\nin the shape of a sugar loaf, which he gripped between his feet\nwhile a rope connected it to his boat, served to lower him more\nquickly to the ocean floor.  This was the extent of his equipment.\nArriving on the seafloor at a depth of about five meters, he fell\nto his knees and stuffed his sack with shellfish gathered at random.\nThen he went back up, emptied his sack, pulled up his stone, and started\nall over again, the whole process lasting only thirty seconds.\n\nThis diver didn't see us.  A shadow cast by our crag hid us from\nhis view.  And besides, how could this poor Indian ever have guessed\nthat human beings, creatures like himself, were near him under\nthe waters, eavesdropping on his movements, not missing a single\ndetail of his fishing!\n\nSo he went up and down several times.  He gathered only about\nten shellfish per dive, because he had to tear them from\nthe banks where each clung with its tough mass of filaments.\nAnd how many of these oysters for which he risked his life would\nhave no pearl in them!\n\nI observed him with great care.  His movements were systematically\nexecuted, and for half an hour no danger seemed to threaten him.\nSo I had gotten used to the sight of this fascinating fishing\nwhen all at once, just as the Indian was kneeling on the seafloor,\nI saw him make a frightened gesture, stand, and gather himself\nto spring back to the surface of the waves.\n\nI understood his fear.  A gigantic shadow appeared above the poor diver.\nIt was a shark of huge size, moving in diagonally, eyes ablaze,\njaws wide open!\n\nI was speechless with horror, unable to make a single movement.\n\nWith one vigorous stroke of its fins, the voracious animal shot\ntoward the Indian, who jumped aside and avoided the shark's bite\nbut not the thrashing of its tail, because that tail struck him\nacross the chest and stretched him out on the seafloor.\n\nThis scene lasted barely a few seconds.  The shark returned,\nrolled over on its back, and was getting ready to cut the Indian in half,\nwhen Captain Nemo, who was stationed beside me, suddenly stood up.\nThen he strode right toward the monster, dagger in hand, ready to\nfight it at close quarters.\n\nJust as it was about to snap up the poor fisherman, the man-eater\nsaw its new adversary, repositioned itself on its belly, and headed\nswiftly toward him.\n\nI can see Captain Nemo's bearing to this day.  Bracing himself,\nhe waited for the fearsome man-eater with wonderful composure,\nand when the latter rushed at him, the captain leaped aside\nwith prodigious quickness, avoided a collision, and sank his\ndagger into its belly.  But that wasn't the end of the story.\nA dreadful battle was joined.\n\nThe shark bellowed, so to speak.  Blood was pouring into the waves\nfrom its wounds.  The sea was dyed red, and through this opaque\nliquid I could see nothing else.\n\nNothing else until the moment when, through a rift in the clouds,\nI saw the daring captain clinging to one of the animal's fins,\nfighting the monster at close quarters, belaboring his\nenemy's belly with stabs of the dagger yet unable to deliver\nthe deciding thrust, in other words, a direct hit to the heart.\nIn its struggles the man-eater churned the watery mass so furiously,\nits eddies threatened to knock me over.\n\nI wanted to run to the captain's rescue.  But I was transfixed\nwith horror, unable to move.\n\nI stared, wild-eyed. I saw the fight enter a new phase.\nThe captain fell to the seafloor, toppled by the enormous mass\nweighing him down.  Then the shark's jaws opened astoundingly wide,\nlike a pair of industrial shears, and that would have been\nthe finish of Captain Nemo had not Ned Land, quick as thought,\nrushed forward with his harpoon and driven its dreadful point\ninto the shark's underside.\n\nThe waves were saturated with masses of blood.  The waters\nshook with the movements of the man-eater, which thrashed about\nwith indescribable fury.  Ned Land hadn't missed his target.\nThis was the monster's death rattle.  Pierced to the heart,\nit was struggling with dreadful spasms whose aftershocks knocked\nConseil off his feet.\n\nMeanwhile Ned Land pulled the captain clear.  Uninjured, the latter\nstood up, went right to the Indian, quickly cut the rope binding\nthe man to his stone, took the fellow in his arms, and with a vigorous\nkick of the heel, rose to the surface of the sea.\n\nThe three of us followed him, and a few moments later, miraculously safe,\nwe reached the fisherman's longboat.\n\nCaptain Nemo's first concern was to revive this unfortunate man.\nI wasn't sure he would succeed.  I hoped so, since the poor devil\nhadn't been under very long.  But that stroke from the shark's tail\ncould have been his deathblow.\n\nFortunately, after vigorous massaging by Conseil and the captain,\nI saw the nearly drowned man regain consciousness little by little.\nHe opened his eyes.  How startled he must have felt, how frightened even,\nat seeing four huge, copper craniums leaning over him!\n\nAnd above all, what must he have thought when Captain Nemo pulled\na bag of pearls from a pocket in his diving suit and placed it\nin the fisherman's hands?  This magnificent benefaction from\nthe Man of the Waters to the poor Indian from Ceylon was accepted\nby the latter with trembling hands.  His bewildered eyes indicated\nthat he didn't know to what superhuman creatures he owed both his\nlife and his fortune.\n\nAt the captain's signal we returned to the bank of shellfish,\nand retracing our steps, we walked for half an hour until we encountered\nthe anchor connecting the seafloor with the Nautilus's skiff.\n\nBack on board, the sailors helped divest us of our heavy copper carapaces.\n\nCaptain Nemo's first words were spoken to the Canadian.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Land,\" he told him.\n\n\"Tit for tat, captain,\" Ned Land replied.  \"I owed it to you.\"\n\nThe ghost of a smile glided across the captain's lips, and that was all.\n\n\"To the Nautilus,\" he said.\n\nThe longboat flew over the waves.  A few minutes later we encountered\nthe shark's corpse again, floating.\n\nFrom the black markings on the tips of its fins, I recognized\nthe dreadful Squalus melanopterus from the seas of the East Indies,\na variety in the species of sharks proper.  It was more than twenty-five\nfeet long; its enormous mouth occupied a third of its body.\nIt was an adult, as could be seen from the six rows of teeth forming\nan isosceles triangle in its upper jaw.\n\nConseil looked at it with purely scientific fascination,\nand I'm sure he placed it, not without good reason, in the class\nof cartilaginous fish, order Chondropterygia with fixed gills,\nfamily Selacia, genus Squalus.\n\nWhile I was contemplating this inert mass, suddenly a dozen of these\nvoracious melanoptera appeared around our longboat; but, paying no\nattention to us, they pounced on the corpse and quarreled over every\nscrap of it.\n\nBy 8:30 we were back on board the Nautilus.\n\nThere I fell to thinking about the incidents that marked our excursion\nover the Mannar oysterbank.  Two impressions inevitably stood out.\nOne concerned Captain Nemo's matchless bravery, the other his devotion\nto a human being, a representative of that race from which he had\nfled beneath the seas.  In spite of everything, this strange man\nhadn't yet succeeded in completely stifling his heart.\n\nWhen I shared these impressions with him, he answered me in a tone\ntouched with emotion:\n\n\"That Indian, professor, lives in the land of the oppressed,\nand I am to this day, and will be until my last breath, a native\nof that same land!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nThe Red Sea\n\n\nDURING THE DAY of January 29, the island of Ceylon disappeared\nbelow the horizon, and at a speed of twenty miles per hour,\nthe Nautilus glided into the labyrinthine channels that separate\nthe Maldive and Laccadive Islands.  It likewise hugged Kiltan Island,\na shore of madreporic origin discovered by Vasco da Gama in 1499 and\none of nineteen chief islands in the island group of the Laccadives,\nlocated between latitude 10 degrees and 14 degrees 30' north, and between\nlongitude 50 degrees 72' and 69 degrees east.\n\nBy then we had fared 16,220 miles, or 7,500 leagues, from our starting\npoint in the seas of Japan.\n\nThe next day, January 30, when the Nautilus rose to the surface\nof the ocean, there was no more land in sight.  Setting its course\nto the north-northwest, the ship headed toward the Gulf of Oman,\ncarved out between Arabia and the Indian peninsula and providing\naccess to the Persian Gulf.\n\nThis was obviously a blind alley with no possible outlet.\nSo where was Captain Nemo taking us?  I was unable to say.\nWhich didn't satisfy the Canadian, who that day asked me where\nwe were going.\n\n\"We're going, Mr. Ned, where the captain's fancy takes us.\"\n\n\"His fancy,\" the Canadian replied, \"won't take us very far.\nThe Persian Gulf has no outlet, and if we enter those waters,\nit won't be long before we return in our tracks.\"\n\n\"All right, we'll return, Mr. Land, and after the Persian Gulf,\nif the Nautilus wants to visit the Red Sea, the Strait of Bab el\nMandeb is still there to let us in!\"\n\n\"I don't have to tell you, sir,\" Ned Land replied, \"that the Red Sea\nis just as landlocked as the gulf, since the Isthmus of Suez hasn't\nbeen cut all the way through yet; and even if it was, a boat\nas secretive as ours wouldn't risk a canal intersected with locks.\nSo the Red Sea won't be our way back to Europe either.\"\n\n\"But I didn't say we'd return to Europe.\"\n\n\"What do you figure, then?\"\n\n\"I figure that after visiting these unusual waterways of Arabia\nand Egypt, the Nautilus will go back down to the Indian Ocean,\nperhaps through Mozambique Channel, perhaps off the Mascarene Islands,\nand then make for the Cape of Good Hope.\"\n\n\"And once we're at the Cape of Good Hope?\" the Canadian asked\nwith typical persistence.\n\n\"Well then, we'll enter that Atlantic Ocean with which we\naren't yet familiar.  What's wrong, Ned my friend?\nAre you tired of this voyage under the seas?  Are you bored\nwith the constantly changing sight of these underwater wonders?\nSpeaking for myself, I'll be extremely distressed to see the end\nof a voyage so few men will ever have a chance to make.\"\n\n\"But don't you realize, Professor Aronnax,\" the Canadian replied,\n\"that soon we'll have been imprisoned for three whole months\naboard this Nautilus?\"\n\n\"No, Ned, I didn't realize it, I don't want to realize it, and I\ndon't keep track of every day and every hour.\"\n\n\"But when will it be over?\"\n\n\"In its appointed time.  Meanwhile there's nothing we can do about it,\nand our discussions are futile.  My gallant Ned, if you come and tell me,\n'A chance to escape is available to us,' then I'll discuss it with you.\nBut that isn't the case, and in all honesty, I don't think Captain Nemo\never ventures into European seas.\"\n\nThis short dialogue reveals that in my mania for the Nautilus, I was\nturning into the spitting image of its commander.\n\nAs for Ned Land, he ended our talk in his best speechifying style:\n\"That's all fine and dandy.  But in my humble opinion, a life\nin jail is a life without joy.\"\n\nFor four days until February 3, the Nautilus inspected the Gulf of Oman\nat various speeds and depths.  It seemed to be traveling at random,\nas if hesitating over which course to follow, but it never crossed\nthe Tropic of Cancer.\n\nAfter leaving this gulf we raised Muscat for an instant,\nthe most important town in the country of Oman.  I marveled at its\nstrange appearance in the midst of the black rocks surrounding it,\nagainst which the white of its houses and forts stood out sharply.\nI spotted the rounded domes of its mosques, the elegant tips\nof its minarets, and its fresh, leafy terraces.  But it was only\na fleeting vision, and the Nautilus soon sank beneath the dark\nwaves of these waterways.\n\nThen our ship went along at a distance of six miles from the Arabic\ncoasts of Mahra and Hadhramaut, their undulating lines of mountains\nrelieved by a few ancient ruins.  On February 5 we finally put\ninto the Gulf of Aden, a genuine funnel stuck into the neck of Bab\nel Mandeb and bottling these Indian waters in the Red Sea.\n\nOn February 6 the Nautilus cruised in sight of the city of Aden,\nperched on a promontory connected to the continent by a narrow isthmus,\na sort of inaccessible Gibraltar whose fortifications the English\nrebuilt after capturing it in 1839.  I glimpsed the octagonal\nminarets of this town, which used to be one of the wealthiest,\nbusiest commercial centers along this coast, as the Arab historian\nIdrisi tells it.\n\nI was convinced that when Captain Nemo reached this point,\nhe would back out again; but I was mistaken, and much to my surprise,\nhe did nothing of the sort.\n\nThe next day, February 7, we entered the Strait of Bab el Mandeb,\nwhose name means \"Gate of Tears\" in the Arabic language.\nTwenty miles wide, it's only fifty-two kilometers long,\nand with the Nautilus launched at full speed, clearing it was\nthe work of barely an hour.  But I didn't see a thing, not even\nPerim Island where the British government built fortifications\nto strengthen Aden's position.  There were many English and French\nsteamers plowing this narrow passageway, liners going from Suez\nto Bombay, Calcutta, Melbourne, R\u00e9union Island, and Mauritius; far too\nmuch traffic for the Nautilus to make an appearance on the surface.\nSo it wisely stayed in midwater.\n\nFinally, at noon, we were plowing the waves of the Red Sea.\n\nThe Red Sea:  that great lake so famous in biblical traditions,\nseldom replenished by rains, fed by no important rivers,\ncontinually drained by a high rate of evaporation, its water level\ndropping a meter and a half every year!  If it were fully landlocked\nlike a lake, this odd gulf might dry up completely; on this score\nit's inferior to its neighbors, the Caspian Sea and the Dead Sea,\nwhose levels lower only to the point where their evaporation exactly\nequals the amounts of water they take to their hearts.\n\nThis Red Sea is 2,600 kilometers long with an average width of 240.\nIn the days of the\n\nPtolemies and the Roman emperors, it was a great commercial\nartery for the world, and when its isthmus has been cut through,\nit will completely regain that bygone importance that the Suez\nrailways have already brought back in part.\n\nI would not even attempt to understand the whim that induced\nCaptain Nemo to take us into this gulf.  But I wholeheartedly\napproved of the Nautilus's entering it.  It adopted a medium pace,\nsometimes staying on the surface, sometimes diving to avoid some ship,\nand so I could observe both the inside and topside of this\nhighly unusual sea.\n\nOn February 8, as early as the first hours of daylight,\nMocha appeared before us:  a town now in ruins, whose walls\nwould collapse at the mere sound of a cannon, and which shelters\na few leafy date trees here and there.  This once-important city\nused to contain six public marketplaces plus twenty-six mosques,\nand its walls, protected by fourteen forts, fashioned a three-kilometer\ngirdle around it.\n\nThen the Nautilus drew near the beaches of Africa, where the sea is\nconsiderably deeper.  There, through the open panels and in a midwater\nof crystal clarity, our ship enabled us to study wonderful bushes\nof shining coral and huge chunks of rock wrapped in splendid green\nfurs of algae and fucus.  What an indescribable sight, and what\na variety of settings and scenery where these reefs and volcanic\nislands leveled off by the Libyan coast!  But soon the Nautilus hugged\nthe eastern shore where these tree forms appeared in all their glory.\nThis was off the coast of Tihama, and there such zoophyte displays\nnot only flourished below sea level but they also fashioned\npicturesque networks that unreeled as high as ten fathoms above it;\nthe latter were more whimsical but less colorful than the former,\nwhich kept their bloom thanks to the moist vitality of the waters.\n\nHow many delightful hours I spent in this way at the lounge window!\nHow many new specimens of underwater flora and fauna I\nmarveled at beneath the light of our electric beacon!\nMushroom-shaped fungus coral, some slate-colored sea anemone including\nthe species Thalassianthus aster among others, organ-pipe coral\narranged like flutes and just begging for a puff from the god Pan,\nshells unique to this sea that dwell in madreporic cavities\nand whose bases are twisted into squat spirals, and finally\na thousand samples of a polypary I hadn't observed until then:\nthe common sponge.\n\nFirst division in the polyp group, the class Spongiaria has been\ncreated by scientists precisely for this unusual exhibit whose\nusefulness is beyond dispute.  The sponge is definitely not a plant,\nas some naturalists still believe, but an animal of the lowest order,\na polypary inferior even to coral.  Its animal nature isn't in doubt,\nand we can't accept even the views of the ancients, who regarded\nit as halfway between plant and animal.  But I must say that\nnaturalists are not in agreement on the structural mode of sponges.\nFor some it's a polypary, and for others, such as Professor Milne-Edwards,\nit's a single, solitary individual.\n\nThe class Spongiaria contains about 300 species that are encountered\nin a large number of seas and even in certain streams, where they've\nbeen given the name freshwater sponges.  But their waters of choice are\nthe Red Sea and the Mediterranean near the Greek Islands or the coast\nof Syria.  These waters witness the reproduction and growth of soft,\ndelicate bath sponges whose prices run as high as 150 francs apiece:\nthe yellow sponge from Syria, the horn sponge from Barbary, etc.\nBut since I had no hope of studying these zoophytes in the seaports\nof the Levant, from which we were separated by the insuperable Isthmus\nof Suez, I had to be content with observing them in the waters\nof the Red Sea.\n\nSo I called Conseil to my side, while at an average depth of eight\nto nine meters, the Nautilus slowly skimmed every beautiful rock\non the easterly coast.\n\nThere sponges grew in every shape, globular, stalklike,\nleaflike, fingerlike.  With reasonable accuracy, they lived up to\ntheir nicknames of basket sponges, chalice sponges, distaff sponges,\nelkhorn sponges, lion's paws, peacock's tails, and Neptune's gloves--\ndesignations bestowed on them by fishermen, more poetically inclined\nthan scientists.  A gelatinous, semifluid substance coated the fibrous\ntissue of these sponges, and from this tissue there escaped a steady\ntrickle of water that, after carrying sustenance to each cell,\nwas being expelled by a contracting movement.  This jellylike substance\ndisappears when the polyp dies, emitting ammonia as it rots.\nFinally nothing remains but the fibers, either gelatinous or made\nof horn, that constitute your household sponge, which takes on\na russet hue and is used for various tasks depending on its degree\nof elasticity, permeability, or resistance to saturation.\n\nThese polyparies were sticking to rocks, shells of mollusks, and even\nthe stalks of water plants.  They adorned the smallest crevices,\nsome sprawling, others standing or hanging like coral outgrowths.\nI told Conseil that sponges are fished up in two ways, either by dragnet\nor by hand.  The latter method calls for the services of a diver,\nbut it's preferable because it spares the polypary's tissue,\nleaving it with a much higher market value.\n\nOther zoophytes swarming near the sponges consisted chiefly of a very\nelegant species of jellyfish; mollusks were represented by varieties\nof squid that, according to Professor Orbigny, are unique to the Red Sea;\nand reptiles by virgata turtles belonging to the genus Chelonia,\nwhich furnished our table with a dainty but wholesome dish.\n\nAs for fish, they were numerous and often remarkable.  Here are\nthe ones that the Nautilus's nets most frequently hauled on board:\nrays, including spotted rays that were oval in shape and brick\nred in color, their bodies strewn with erratic blue speckles and\nidentifiable by their jagged double stings, silver-backed skates,\ncommon stingrays with stippled tails, butterfly rays that looked\nlike huge two-meter cloaks flapping at middepth, toothless guitarfish\nthat were a type of cartilaginous fish closer to the shark,\ntrunkfish known as dromedaries that were one and a half feet long\nand had humps ending in backward-curving stings, serpentine moray\neels with silver tails and bluish backs plus brown pectorals trimmed\nin gray piping, a species of butterfish called the fiatola decked\nout in thin gold stripes and the three colors of the French flag,\nMontague blennies four decimeters long, superb jacks handsomely\nembellished by seven black crosswise streaks with blue and yellow\nfins plus gold and silver scales, snooks, standard mullet with\nyellow heads, parrotfish, wrasse, triggerfish, gobies, etc., plus\na thousand other fish common to the oceans we had already crossed.\n\nOn February 9 the Nautilus cruised in the widest part of the Red Sea,\nmeasuring 190 miles straight across from Suakin on the west coast\nto Qunfidha on the east coast.\n\nAt noon that day after our position fix, Captain Nemo climbed onto\nthe platform, where I happened to be.  I vowed not to let him go\nbelow again without at least sounding him out on his future plans.\nAs soon as he saw me, he came over, graciously offered me a cigar,\nand said to me:\n\n\"Well, professor, are you pleased with this Red Sea?  Have you seen\nenough of its hidden wonders, its fish and zoophytes, its gardens\nof sponges and forests of coral?  Have you glimpsed the towns built\non its shores?\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain Nemo,\" I replied, \"and the Nautilus is wonderfully\nsuited to this whole survey.  Ah, it's a clever boat!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, clever, daring, and invulnerable!  It fears neither\nthe Red Sea's dreadful storms nor its currents and reefs.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" I said, \"this sea is mentioned as one of the worst,\nand in the days of the ancients, if I'm not mistaken, it had\nan abominable reputation.\"\n\n\"Thoroughly abominable, Professor Aronnax.  The Greek and Latin\nhistorians can find nothing to say in its favor, and the Greek\ngeographer Strabo adds that it's especially rough during\nthe rainy season and the period of summer prevailing winds.\nThe Arab Idrisi, referring to it by the name Gulf of Colzoum,\nrelates that ships perished in large numbers on its sandbanks\nand that no one risked navigating it by night.  This, he claims,\nis a sea subject to fearful hurricanes, strewn with inhospitable islands,\nand 'with nothing good to offer,' either on its surface or in\nits depths.  As a matter of fact, the same views can also be found\nin Arrian, Agatharchides, and Artemidorus.\"\n\n\"One can easily see,\" I answered, \"that those historians didn't\nnavigate aboard the Nautilus.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" the captain replied with a smile, \"and in this respect,\nthe moderns aren't much farther along than the ancients.\nIt took many centuries to discover the mechanical power of steam!\nWho knows whether we'll see a second Nautilus within the next 100 years!\nProgress is slow, Professor Aronnax.\"\n\n\"It's true,\" I replied.  \"Your ship is a century ahead of its time,\nperhaps several centuries.  It would be most unfortunate if such\na secret were to die with its inventor!\"\n\nCaptain Nemo did not reply.  After some minutes of silence:\n\n\"We were discussing,\" he said, \"the views of ancient historians\non the dangers of navigating this Red Sea?\"\n\n\"True,\" I replied.  \"But weren't their fears exaggerated?\"\n\n\"Yes and no, Professor Aronnax,\" answered Captain Nemo,\nwho seemed to know \"his Red Sea\" by heart.  \"To a modern ship,\nwell rigged, solidly constructed, and in control of its course\nthanks to obedient steam, some conditions are no longer hazardous\nthat offered all sorts of dangers to the vessels of the ancients.\nPicture those early navigators venturing forth in sailboats\nbuilt from planks lashed together with palm-tree ropes,\ncaulked with powdered resin, and coated with dogfish grease.\nThey didn't even have instruments for taking their bearings,\nthey went by guesswork in the midst of currents they barely knew.\nUnder such conditions, shipwrecks had to be numerous.\nBut nowadays steamers providing service between Suez and the South Seas\nhave nothing to fear from the fury of this gulf, despite the contrary\nwinds of its monsoons.  Their captains and passengers no longer\nprepare for departure with sacrifices to placate the gods,\nand after returning, they don't traipse in wreaths and gold ribbons\nto say thanks at the local temple.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" I said.  \"And steam seems to have killed off all gratitude\nin seamen's hearts.  But since you seem to have made a special study\nof this sea, captain, can you tell me how it got its name?\"\n\n\"Many explanations exist on the subject, Professor Aronnax.  Would you\nlike to hear the views of one chronicler in the 14th century?\"\n\n\"Gladly.\"\n\n\"This fanciful fellow claims the sea was given its name after\nthe crossing of the Israelites, when the Pharaoh perished in those\nwaves that came together again at Moses' command:\n\nTo mark that miraculous sequel, the sea turned a red without equal.\n\nThus no other course would do but to name it for its hue.\"\n\n\"An artistic explanation, Captain Nemo,\" I replied, \"but I'm unable\nto rest content with it.  So I'll ask you for your own personal views.\"\n\n\"Here they come.  To my thinking, Professor Aronnax, this 'Red Sea'\ndesignation must be regarded as a translation of the Hebrew word\n'Edrom,' and if the ancients gave it that name, it was because of\nthe unique color of its waters.\"\n\n\"Until now, however, I've seen only clear waves, without any unique hue.\"\n\n\"Surely, but as we move ahead to the far end of this gulf,\nyou'll note its odd appearance.  I recall seeing the bay of El Tur\ncompletely red, like a lake of blood.\"\n\n\"And you attribute this color to the presence of microscopic algae?\"\n\n\"Yes.  It's a purplish, mucilaginous substance produced by those tiny\nbuds known by the name trichodesmia, 40,000 of which are needed\nto occupy the space of one square millimeter.  Perhaps you'll\nencounter them when we reach El Tur.\"\n\n\"Hence, Captain Nemo, this isn't the first time you've gone through\nthe Red Sea aboard the Nautilus?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Then, since you've already mentioned the crossing of the Israelites\nand the catastrophe that befell the Egyptians, I would ask if you've ever\ndiscovered any traces under the waters of that great historic event?\"\n\n\"No, professor, and for an excellent reason.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"It's because that same locality where Moses crossed with all his people\nis now so clogged with sand, camels can barely get their legs wet.\nYou can understand that my Nautilus wouldn't have enough\nwater for itself.\"\n\n\"And that locality is . . . ?\"  I asked.\n\n\"That locality lies a little above Suez in a sound that used to form\na deep estuary when the Red Sea stretched as far as the Bitter Lakes.\nNow, whether or not their crossing was literally miraculous,\nthe Israelites did cross there in returning to the Promised Land,\nand the Pharaoh's army did perish at precisely that locality.\nSo I think that excavating those sands would bring to light a great\nmany weapons and tools of Egyptian origin.\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" I replied.  \"And for the sake of archaeology, let's hope\nthat sooner or later such excavations do take place, once new towns\nare settled on the isthmus after the Suez Canal has been cut through--\na canal, by the way, of little use to a ship such as the Nautilus!\"\n\n\"Surely, but of great use to the world at large,\" Captain Nemo said.\n\"The ancients well understood the usefulness to commerce of connecting\nthe Red Sea with the Mediterranean, but they never dreamed of cutting\na canal between the two, and instead they picked the Nile as their link.\nIf we can trust tradition, it was probably Egypt's King Sesostris\nwho started digging the canal needed to join the Nile with\nthe Red Sea.  What's certain is that in 615 B.C. King Necho II\nwas hard at work on a canal that was fed by Nile water and ran\nthrough the Egyptian plains opposite Arabia.  This canal could\nbe traveled in four days, and it was so wide, two triple-tiered\ngalleys could pass through it abreast.  Its construction was\ncontinued by Darius the Great, son of Hystaspes, and probably\ncompleted by King Ptolemy II.  Strabo saw it used for shipping;\nbut the weakness of its slope between its starting point, near Bubastis,\nand the Red Sea left it navigable only a few months out of the year.\nThis canal served commerce until the century of Rome's Antonine emperors;\nit was then abandoned and covered with sand, subsequently reinstated\nby Arabia's Caliph Omar I, and finally filled in for good in 761\nor 762 A.D. by Caliph Al-Mansur, in an effort to prevent supplies\nfrom reaching Mohammed ibn Abdullah, who had rebelled against him.\nDuring his Egyptian campaign, your General Napoleon Bonaparte\ndiscovered traces of this old canal in the Suez desert, and when\nthe tide caught him by surprise, he wellnigh perished just a few\nhours before rejoining his regiment at Hadjaroth, the very place\nwhere Moses had pitched camp 3,300 years before him.\"\n\n\"Well, captain, what the ancients hesitated to undertake, Mr. de\nLesseps is now finishing up; his joining of these two seas will\nshorten the route from Cadiz to the East Indies by 9,000 kilometers,\nand he'll soon change Africa into an immense island.\"\n\n\"Yes, Professor Aronnax, and you have every right to be proud of your\nfellow countryman.  Such a man brings a nation more honor than the\ngreatest commanders!  Like so many others, he began with difficulties\nand setbacks, but he triumphed because he has the volunteer spirit.\nAnd it's sad to think that this deed, which should have been an\ninternational deed, which would have insured that any administration\nwent down in history, will succeed only through the efforts of one man.\nSo all hail to Mr. de Lesseps!\"\n\n\"Yes, all hail to that great French citizen,\" I replied,\nquite startled by how emphatically Captain Nemo had just spoken.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" he went on, \"I can't take you through that Suez Canal,\nbut the day after tomorrow, you'll be able to see the long jetties\nof Port Said when we're in the Mediterranean.\"\n\n\"In the Mediterranean!\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, professor.  Does that amaze you?\"\n\n\"What amazes me is thinking we'll be there the day after tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Oh really?\"\n\n\"Yes, captain, although since I've been aboard your vessel,\nI should have formed the habit of not being amazed by anything!\"\n\n\"But what is it that startles you?\"\n\n\"The thought of how hideously fast the Nautilus will need to go,\nif it's to double the Cape of Good Hope, circle around Africa,\nand lie in the open Mediterranean by the day after tomorrow.\"\n\n\"And who says it will circle Africa, professor?  What's this talk\nabout doubling the Cape of Good Hope?\"\n\n\"But unless the Nautilus navigates on dry land and crosses\nover the isthmus--\"\n\n\"Or under it, Professor Aronnax.\"\n\n\"Under it?\"\n\n\"Surely,\" Captain Nemo replied serenely.  \"Under that tongue of land,\nnature long ago made what man today is making on its surface.\"\n\n\"What!  There's a passageway?\"\n\n\"Yes, an underground passageway that I've named the Arabian Tunnel.\nIt starts below Suez and leads to the Bay of Pelusium.\"\n\n\"But isn't that isthmus only composed of quicksand?\"\n\n\"To a certain depth.  But at merely fifty meters, one encounters\na firm foundation of rock.\"\n\n\"And it's by luck that you discovered this passageway?\"\nI asked, more and more startled.\n\n\"Luck plus logic, professor, and logic even more than luck.\"\n\n\"Captain, I hear you, but I can't believe my ears.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir!  The old saying still holds good:  Aures habent et non\naudient!* Not only does this passageway exist, but I've taken\nadvantage of it on several occasions.  Without it, I wouldn't\nhave ventured today into such a blind alley as the Red Sea.\"\n\n*Latin: \"They have ears but hear not.\"  Ed.\n\n\"Is it indiscreet to ask how you discovered this tunnel?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" the captain answered me, \"there can be no secrets between men\nwho will never leave each other.\"\n\nI ignored this innuendo and waited for Captain Nemo's explanation.\n\n\"Professor,\" he told me, \"the simple logic of the naturalist led\nme to discover this passageway, and I alone am familiar with it.\nI'd noted that in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean there exist\na number of absolutely identical species of fish:  eels, butterfish,\ngreenfish, bass, jewelfish, flying fish.  Certain of this fact,\nI wondered if there weren't a connection between the two seas.\nIf there were, its underground current had to go from the Red Sea\nto the Mediterranean simply because of their difference in level.\nSo I caught a large number of fish in the vicinity of Suez.  I slipped\ncopper rings around their tails and tossed them back into the sea.\nA few months later off the coast of Syria, I recaptured a few\nspecimens of my fish, adorned with their telltale rings.\nSo this proved to me that some connection existed between the two seas.\nI searched for it with my Nautilus, I discovered it, I ventured into it;\nand soon, professor, you also will have cleared my Arabic tunnel!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nArabian Tunnel\n\n\nTHE SAME DAY, I reported to Conseil and Ned Land that part of\nthe foregoing conversation directly concerning them.  When I told\nthem we would be lying in Mediterranean waters within two days,\nConseil clapped his hands, but the Canadian shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"An underwater tunnel!\" he exclaimed.  \"A connection between two seas!\nWho ever heard of such malarkey!\"\n\n\"Ned my friend,\" Conseil replied, \"had you ever heard of\nthe Nautilus?  No, yet here it is!  So don't shrug your shoulders\nso blithely, and don't discount something with the feeble excuse\nthat you've never heard of it.\"\n\n\"We'll soon see!\"  Ned Land shot back, shaking his head.\n\"After all, I'd like nothing better than to believe in your captain's\nlittle passageway, and may Heaven grant it really does take us\nto the Mediterranean.\"\n\nThe same evening, at latitude 21 degrees 30' north, the Nautilus was\nafloat on the surface of the sea and drawing nearer to the Arab coast.\nI spotted Jidda, an important financial center for Egypt, Syria, Turkey,\nand the East Indies.  I could distinguish with reasonable clarity\nthe overall effect of its buildings, the ships made fast along\nits wharves, and those bigger vessels whose draft of water\nrequired them to drop anchor at the port's offshore mooring.\nThe sun, fairly low on the horizon, struck full force on the houses\nin this town, accenting their whiteness.  Outside the city limits,\nsome wood or reed huts indicated the quarter where the bedouins lived.\n\nSoon Jidda faded into the shadows of evening, and the Nautilus went\nback beneath the mildly phosphorescent waters.\n\nThe next day, February 10, several ships appeared, running on our\nopposite tack.  The Nautilus resumed its underwater navigating;\nbut at the moment of our noon sights, the sea was deserted and the ship\nrose again to its waterline.\n\nWith Ned and Conseil, I went to sit on the platform.  The coast\nto the east looked like a slightly blurred mass in a damp fog.\n\nLeaning against the sides of the skiff, we were chatting of one\nthing and another, when Ned Land stretched his hand toward a point\nin the water, saying to me:\n\n\"See anything out there, professor?\"\n\n\"No, Ned,\" I replied, \"but you know I don't have your eyes.\"\n\n\"Take a good look,\" Ned went on.  \"There, ahead to starboard,\nalmost level with the beacon!  Don't you see a mass that seems\nto be moving around?\"\n\n\"Right,\" I said after observing carefully, \"I can make out something\nlike a long, blackish object on the surface of the water.\"\n\n\"A second Nautilus?\"  Conseil said.\n\n\"No,\" the Canadian replied, \"unless I'm badly mistaken,\nthat's some marine animal.\"\n\n\"Are there whales in the Red Sea?\"  Conseil asked.\n\n\"Yes, my boy,\" I replied, \"they're sometimes found here.\"\n\n\"That's no whale,\" continued Ned Land, whose eyes never strayed\nfrom the object they had sighted.  \"We're old chums, whales and I,\nand I couldn't mistake their little ways.\"\n\n\"Let's wait and see,\" Conseil said.  \"The Nautilus is heading\nthat direction, and we'll soon know what we're in for.\"\n\nIn fact, that blackish object was soon only a mile away from us.\nIt looked like a huge reef stranded in midocean.  What was it?\nI still couldn't make up my mind.\n\n\"Oh, it's moving off!  It's diving!\"  Ned Land exclaimed.\n\"Damnation!  What can that animal be?  It doesn't have a forked\ntail like baleen whales or sperm whales, and its fins look\nlike sawed-off limbs.\"\n\n\"But in that case--\" I put in.\n\n\"Good lord,\" the Canadian went on, \"it's rolled over on its back,\nand it's raising its breasts in the air!\"\n\n\"It's a siren!\"  Conseil exclaimed.  \"With all due respect to master,\nit's an actual mermaid!\"\n\nThat word \"siren\" put me back on track, and I realized that the animal\nbelonged to the order Sirenia:  marine creatures that legends\nhave turned into mermaids, half woman, half fish.\n\n\"No,\" I told Conseil, \"that's no mermaid, it's an unusual creature\nof which only a few specimens are left in the Red Sea.  That's a dugong.\"\n\n\"Order Sirenia, group Pisciforma, subclass Monodelphia, class Mammalia,\nbranch Vertebrata,\" Conseil replied.\n\nAnd when Conseil has spoken, there's nothing else to be said.\n\nMeanwhile Ned Land kept staring.  His eyes were gleaming with desire\nat the sight of that animal.  His hands were ready to hurl a harpoon.\nYou would have thought he was waiting for the right moment to jump\noverboard and attack the creature in its own element.\n\n\"Oh, sir,\" he told me in a voice trembling with excitement,\n\"I've never killed anything like that!\"\n\nHis whole being was concentrated in this last word.\n\nJust then Captain Nemo appeared on the platform.  He spotted the dugong.\nHe understood the Canadian's frame of mind and addressed him directly:\n\n\"If you held a harpoon, Mr. Land, wouldn't your hands be itching\nto put it to work?\"\n\n\"Positively, sir.\"\n\n\"And just for one day, would it displease you to return to your\nfisherman's trade and add this cetacean to the list of those you've\nalready hunted down?\"\n\n\"It wouldn't displease me one bit.\"\n\n\"All right, you can try your luck!\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Ned Land replied, his eyes ablaze.\n\n\"Only,\" the captain went on, \"I urge you to aim carefully at this animal,\nin your own personal interest.\"\n\n\"Is the dugong dangerous to attack?\"  I asked, despite the Canadian's\nshrug of the shoulders.\n\n\"Yes, sometimes,\" the captain replied.  \"These animals have been\nknown to turn on their assailants and capsize their longboats.\nBut with Mr. Land that danger isn't to be feared.  His eye is sharp,\nhis arm is sure.  If I recommend that he aim carefully at this dugong,\nit's because the animal is justly regarded as fine game, and I know\nMr. Land doesn't despise a choice morsel.\"\n\n\"Aha!\" the Canadian put in.  \"This beast offers the added luxury\nof being good to eat?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Land.  Its flesh is actual red meat, highly prized,\nand set aside throughout Malaysia for the tables of aristocrats.\nAccordingly, this excellent animal has been hunted so bloodthirstily that,\nlike its manatee relatives, it has become more and more scarce.\"\n\n\"In that case, captain,\" Conseil said in all seriousness,\n\"on the offchance that this creature might be the last of its line,\nwouldn't it be advisable to spare its life, in the interests of science?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" the Canadian answered, \"it would be better to hunt it down,\nin the interests of mealtime.\"\n\n\"Then proceed, Mr. Land,\" Captain Nemo replied.\n\nJust then, as mute and emotionless as ever, seven crewmen climbed\nonto the platform.  One carried a harpoon and line similar\nto those used in whale fishing.  Its deck paneling opened,\nthe skiff was wrenched from its socket and launched to sea.\nSix rowers sat on the thwarts, and the coxswain took the tiller.\nNed, Conseil, and I found seats in the stern.\n\n\"Aren't you coming, captain?\"  I asked.\n\n\"No, sir, but I wish you happy hunting.\"\n\nThe skiff pulled clear, and carried off by its six oars, it headed\nswiftly toward the dugong, which by then was floating two miles\nfrom the Nautilus.\n\nArriving within a few cable lengths of the cetacean, our longboat\nslowed down, and the sculls dipped noiselessly into the tranquil waters.\nHarpoon in hand, Ned Land went to take his stand in the skiff's bow.\nHarpoons used for hunting whales are usually attached to a very long\nrope that pays out quickly when the wounded animal drags it with him.\nBut this rope measured no more than about ten fathoms, and its end\nhad simply been fastened to a small barrel that, while floating,\nwould indicate the dugong's movements beneath the waters.\n\nI stood up and could clearly observe the Canadian's adversary.\nThis dugong--which also boasts the name halicore--closely resembled\na manatee.  Its oblong body ended in a very long caudal fin and\nits lateral fins in actual fingers.  It differs from the manatee\nin that its upper jaw is armed with two long, pointed teeth that form\ndiverging tusks on either side.\n\nThis dugong that Ned Land was preparing to attack was of\ncolossal dimensions, easily exceeding seven meters in length.\nIt didn't stir and seemed to be sleeping on the surface of the waves,\na circumstance that should have made it easier to capture.\n\nThe skiff approached cautiously to within three fathoms of the animal.\nThe oars hung suspended above their rowlocks.  I was crouching.\nHis body leaning slightly back, Ned Land brandished his harpoon\nwith expert hands.\n\nSuddenly a hissing sound was audible, and the dugong disappeared.\nAlthough the harpoon had been forcefully hurled, it apparently\nhad hit only water.\n\n\"Damnation!\" exclaimed the furious Canadian.  \"I missed it!\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"the animal's wounded, there's its blood; but your\nweapon didn't stick in its body.\"\n\n\"My harpoon!  Get my harpoon!\"  Ned Land exclaimed.\n\nThe sailors went back to their sculling, and the coxswain steered\nthe longboat toward the floating barrel.  We fished up the harpoon,\nand the skiff started off in pursuit of the animal.\n\nThe latter returned from time to time to breathe at the surface\nof the sea.  Its wound hadn't weakened it because it went with\ntremendous speed.  Driven by energetic arms, the longboat flew\non its trail.  Several times we got within a few fathoms of it,\nand the Canadian hovered in readiness to strike; but then the dugong\nwould steal away with a sudden dive, and it proved impossible\nto overtake the beast.\n\nI'll let you assess the degree of anger consuming our impatient\nNed Land.  He hurled at the hapless animal the most potent swearwords\nin the English language.  For my part, I was simply distressed\nto see this dugong outwit our every scheme.\n\nWe chased it unflaggingly for a full hour, and I'd begun to think it would\nprove too difficult to capture, when the animal got the untimely idea\nof taking revenge on us, a notion it would soon have cause to regret.\nIt wheeled on the skiff, to assault us in its turn.\n\nThis maneuver did not escape the Canadian.\n\n\"Watch out!\" he said.\n\nThe coxswain pronounced a few words in his bizarre language,\nand no doubt he alerted his men to keep on their guard.\n\nArriving within twenty feet of the skiff, the dugong stopped,\nsharply sniffing the air with its huge nostrils, pierced not at\nthe tip of its muzzle but on its topside.  Then it gathered itself\nand sprang at us.\n\nThe skiff couldn't avoid the collision.  Half overturned,\nit shipped a ton or two of water that we had to bail out.\nBut thanks to our skillful coxswain, we were fouled on the bias rather\nthan broadside, so we didn't capsize.  Clinging to the stempost,\nNed Land thrust his harpoon again and again into the gigantic animal,\nwhich imbedded its teeth in our gunwale and lifted the longboat\nout of the water as a lion would lift a deer.  We were thrown on\ntop of each other, and I have no idea how the venture would have\nended had not the Canadian, still thirsting for the beast's blood,\nfinally pierced it to the heart.\n\nI heard its teeth grind on sheet iron, and the dugong disappeared,\ntaking our harpoon along with it.  But the barrel soon popped up\non the surface, and a few moments later the animal's body appeared\nand rolled over on its back.  Our skiff rejoined it, took it in tow,\nand headed to the Nautilus.\n\nIt took pulleys of great strength to hoist this dugong onto the platform.\nThe beast weighed 5,000 kilograms.  It was carved up in sight of\nthe Canadian, who remained to watch every detail of the operation.\nAt dinner the same day, my steward served me some slices of this flesh,\nskillfully dressed by the ship's cook.  I found it excellent,\neven better than veal if not beef.\n\nThe next morning, February 11, the Nautilus's pantry was\nenriched by more dainty game.  A covey of terns alighted on\nthe Nautilus.  They were a species of Sterna nilotica unique to Egypt:\nbeak black, head gray and stippled, eyes surrounded by white dots,\nback, wings, and tail grayish, belly and throat white, feet red.\nAlso caught were a couple dozen Nile duck, superior-tasting wildfowl\nwhose neck and crown of the head are white speckled with black.\n\nBy then the Nautilus had reduced speed.  It moved ahead at a saunter,\nso to speak.  I observed that the Red Sea's water was becoming less\nsalty the closer we got to Suez.\n\nNear five o'clock in the afternoon, we sighted Cape Ras Mohammed\nto the north.  This cape forms the tip of Arabia Petraea, which lies\nbetween the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Aqaba.\n\nThe Nautilus entered the Strait of Jubal, which leads to the Gulf\nof Suez.  I could clearly make out a high mountain crowning Ras Mohammed\nbetween the two gulfs.  It was Mt.  Horeb, that biblical Mt.  Sinai on\nwhose summit Moses met God face to face, that summit the mind's\neye always pictures as wreathed in lightning.\n\nAt six o'clock, sometimes afloat and sometimes submerged, the Nautilus\npassed well out from El Tur, which sat at the far end of a bay whose\nwaters seemed to be dyed red, as Captain Nemo had already mentioned.\nThen night fell in the midst of a heavy silence occasionally broken\nby the calls of pelicans and nocturnal birds, by the sound of surf\nchafing against rocks, or by the distant moan of a steamer churning\nthe waves of the gulf with noisy blades.\n\nFrom eight to nine o'clock, the Nautilus stayed a few meters\nbeneath the waters.  According to my calculations, we had\nto be quite close to Suez.  Through the panels in the lounge,\nI spotted rocky bottoms brightly lit by our electric rays.\nIt seemed to me that the strait was getting narrower and narrower.\n\nAt 9:15 when our boat returned to the surface, I climbed onto\nthe platform.  I was quite impatient to clear Captain Nemo's tunnel,\ncouldn't sit still, and wanted to breathe the fresh night air.\n\nSoon, in the shadows, I spotted a pale signal light glimmering\na mile away, half discolored by mist.\n\n\"A floating lighthouse,\" said someone next to me.\n\nI turned and discovered the captain.\n\n\"That's the floating signal light of Suez,\" he went on.\n\"It won't be long before we reach the entrance to the tunnel.\"\n\n\"It can't be very easy to enter it.\"\n\n\"No, sir.  Accordingly, I'm in the habit of staying in the pilothouse\nand directing maneuvers myself.  And now if you'll kindly go below,\nProfessor Aronnax, the Nautilus is about to sink beneath the waves,\nand it will only return to the surface after we've cleared\nthe Arabian Tunnel.\"\n\nI followed Captain Nemo.  The hatch closed, the ballast tanks filled\nwith water, and the submersible sank some ten meters down.\n\nJust as I was about to repair to my stateroom, the captain stopped me.\n\n\"Professor,\" he said to me, \"would you like to go with me\nto the wheelhouse?\"\n\n\"I was afraid to ask,\" I replied.\n\n\"Come along, then.  This way, you'll learn the full story about this\ncombination underwater and underground navigating.\"\n\nCaptain Nemo led me to the central companionway.  In midstair\nhe opened a door, went along the upper gangways, and arrived at\nthe wheelhouse, which, as you know, stands at one end of the platform.\n\nIt was a cabin measuring six feet square and closely resembling\nthose occupied by the helmsmen of steamboats on the Mississippi\nor Hudson rivers.  In the center stood an upright wheel\ngeared to rudder cables running to the Nautilus's stern.\nSet in the cabin's walls were four deadlights, windows of biconvex\nglass that enabled the man at the helm to see in every direction.\n\nThe cabin was dark; but my eyes soon grew accustomed to its darkness\nand I saw the pilot, a muscular man whose hands rested on the pegs\nof the wheel.  Outside, the sea was brightly lit by the beacon\nshining behind the cabin at the other end of the platform.\n\n\"Now,\" Captain Nemo said, \"let's look for our passageway.\"\n\nElectric wires linked the pilothouse with the engine room,\nand from this cabin the captain could simultaneously signal heading\nand speed to his Nautilus.  He pressed a metal button and at once\nthe propeller slowed down significantly.\n\nI stared in silence at the high, sheer wall we were skirting just then,\nthe firm base of the sandy mountains on the coast.  For an hour we\nwent along it in this fashion, staying only a few meters away.\nCaptain Nemo never took his eyes off the two concentric circles\nof the compass hanging in the cabin.  At a mere gesture from him,\nthe helmsman would instantly change the Nautilus's heading.\n\nStanding by the port deadlight, I spotted magnificent coral substructures,\nzoophytes, algae, and crustaceans with enormous quivering claws\nthat stretched forth from crevices in the rock.\n\nAt 10:15 Captain Nemo himself took the helm.  Dark and deep, a wide\ngallery opened ahead of us.  The Nautilus was brazenly swallowed up.\nStrange rumblings were audible along our sides.  It was the water\nof the Red Sea, hurled toward the Mediterranean by the tunnel's slope.\nOur engines tried to offer resistance by churning the waves\nwith propeller in reverse, but the Nautilus went with the torrent,\nas swift as an arrow.\n\nAlong the narrow walls of this passageway, I saw only brilliant streaks,\nhard lines, fiery furrows, all scrawled by our speeding electric light.\nWith my hand I tried to curb the pounding of my heart.\n\nAt 10:35 Captain Nemo left the steering wheel and turned to me:\n\n\"The Mediterranean,\" he told me.\n\nIn less than twenty minutes, swept along by the torrent, the Nautilus\nhad just cleared the Isthmus of Suez.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nThe Greek Islands\n\n\nAT SUNRISE the next morning, February 12, the Nautilus rose\nto the surface of the waves.\n\nI rushed onto the platform.  The hazy silhouette of Pelusium was\noutlined three miles to the south.  A torrent had carried us from\none sea to the other.  But although that tunnel was easy to descend,\ngoing back up must have been impossible.\n\nNear seven o'clock Ned and Conseil joined me.  Those two inseparable\ncompanions had slept serenely, utterly unaware of the Nautilus's feat.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Naturalist,\" the Canadian asked in a gently mocking tone,\n\"and how about that Mediterranean?\"\n\n\"We're floating on its surface, Ned my friend.\"\n\n\"What!\"  Conseil put in.  \"Last night . . . ?\"\n\n\"Yes, last night, in a matter of minutes, we cleared\nthat insuperable isthmus.\"\n\n\"I don't believe a word of it,\" the Canadian replied.\n\n\"And you're in the wrong, Mr. Land,\" I went on.  \"That flat coastline\ncurving southward is the coast of Egypt.\"\n\n\"Tell it to the marines, sir,\" answered the stubborn Canadian.\n\n\"But if master says so,\" Conseil told him, \"then so be it.\"\n\n\"What's more, Ned,\" I said, \"Captain Nemo himself did the honors\nin his tunnel, and I stood beside him in the pilothouse while\nhe steered the Nautilus through that narrow passageway.\"\n\n\"You hear, Ned?\"  Conseil said.\n\n\"And you, Ned, who have such good eyes,\" I added, \"you can spot\nthe jetties of Port Said stretching out to sea.\"\n\nThe Canadian looked carefully.\n\n\"Correct,\" he said.  \"You're right, professor, and your captain's\na superman.  We're in the Mediterranean.  Fine.  So now let's have\na chat about our little doings, if you please, but in such a way\nthat nobody overhears.\"\n\nI could easily see what the Canadian was driving at.  In any event,\nI thought it best to let him have his chat, and we all three went\nto sit next to the beacon, where we were less exposed to the damp\nspray from the billows.\n\n\"Now, Ned, we're all ears,\" I said.  \"What have you to tell us?\"\n\n\"What I've got to tell you is very simple,\" the Canadian replied.\n\"We're in Europe, and before Captain Nemo's whims take us deep into\nthe polar seas or back to Oceania, I say we should leave this Nautilus.\"\n\nI confess that such discussions with the Canadian always baffled me.\nI didn't want to restrict my companions' freedom in any way,\nand yet I had no desire to leave Captain Nemo.  Thanks to him\nand his submersible, I was finishing my undersea research by\nthe day, and I was rewriting my book on the great ocean depths\nin the midst of its very element.  Would I ever again have such\nan opportunity to observe the ocean's wonders?  Absolutely not!\nSo I couldn't entertain this idea of leaving the Nautilus before\ncompleting our course of inquiry.\n\n\"Ned my friend,\" I said, \"answer me honestly.  Are you bored\nwith this ship?  Are you sorry that fate has cast you into\nCaptain Nemo's hands?\"\n\nThe Canadian paused for a short while before replying.\nThen, crossing his arms:\n\n\"Honestly,\" he said, \"I'm not sorry about this voyage under the seas.\nI'll be glad to have done it, but in order to have done it,\nit has to finish.  That's my feeling.\"\n\n\"It will finish, Ned.\"\n\n\"Where and when?\"\n\n\"Where?  I don't know.  When?  I can't say.  Or, rather, I suppose\nit will be over when these seas have nothing more to teach us.\nEverything that begins in this world must inevitably come to an end.\"\n\n\"I think as master does,\" Conseil replied, \"and it's extremely\npossible that after crossing every sea on the globe, Captain Nemo\nwill bid the three of us a fond farewell.\"\n\n\"Bid us a fond farewell?\" the Canadian exclaimed.  \"You mean beat\nus to a fare-thee-well!\"\n\n\"Let's not exaggerate, Mr. Land,\" I went on.  \"We have nothing\nto fear from the captain, but neither do I share Conseil's views.\nWe're privy to the Nautilus's secrets, and I don't expect that\nits commander, just to set us free, will meekly stand by while we\nspread those secrets all over the world.\"\n\n\"But in that case what do you expect?\" the Canadian asked.\n\n\"That we'll encounter advantageous conditions for escaping just\nas readily in six months as now.\"\n\n\"Great Scott!\"  Ned Land put in.  \"And where, if you please,\nwill we be in six months, Mr. Naturalist?\"\n\n\"Perhaps here, perhaps in China.  You know how quickly the\nNautilus moves.  It crosses oceans like swallows cross the air or\nexpress trains continents.  It doesn't fear heavily traveled seas.\nWho can say it won't hug the coasts of France, England, or America,\nwhere an escape attempt could be carried out just as effectively as here.\"\n\n\"Professor Aronnax,\" the Canadian replied, \"your arguments\nare rotten to the core.  You talk way off in the future:\n'We'll be here, we'll be there!'  Me, I'm talking about right now:\nwe are here, and we must take advantage of it!\"\n\nI was hard pressed by Ned Land's common sense, and I felt myself\nlosing ground.  I no longer knew what arguments to put forward\non my behalf.\n\n\"Sir,\" Ned went on, \"let's suppose that by some impossibility,\nCaptain Nemo offered your freedom to you this very day.\nWould you accept?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I replied.\n\n\"And suppose he adds that this offer he's making you today won't\never be repeated, then would you accept?\"\n\nI did not reply.\n\n\"And what thinks our friend Conseil?\"  Ned Land asked.\n\n\"Your friend Conseil,\" the fine lad replied serenely, \"has nothing to say\nfor himself.  He's a completely disinterested party on this question.\nLike his master, like his comrade Ned, he's a bachelor.\nNeither wife, parents, nor children are waiting for him back home.\nHe's in master's employ, he thinks like master, he speaks like master,\nand much to his regret, he can't be counted on to form a majority.\nOnly two persons face each other here:  master on one side,\nNed Land on the other.  That said, your friend Conseil is listening,\nand he's ready to keep score.\"\n\nI couldn't help smiling as Conseil wiped himself out of existence.\nDeep down, the Canadian must have been overjoyed at not having\nto contend with him.\n\n\"Then, sir,\" Ned Land said, \"since Conseil is no more, we'll have this\ndiscussion between just the two of us.  I've talked, you've listened.\nWhat's your reply?\"\n\nIt was obvious that the matter had to be settled, and evasions\nwere distasteful to me.\n\n\"Ned my friend,\" I said, \"here's my reply.  You have right\non your side and my arguments can't stand up to yours.\nIt will never do to count on Captain Nemo's benevolence.\nThe most ordinary good sense would forbid him to set us free.\nOn the other hand, good sense decrees that we take advantage of our\nfirst opportunity to leave the Nautilus.\"\n\n\"Fine, Professor Aronnax, that's wisely said.\"\n\n\"But one proviso,\" I said, \"just one.  The opportunity must\nbe the real thing.  Our first attempt to escape must succeed,\nbecause if it misfires, we won't get a second chance, and Captain Nemo\nwill never forgive us.\"\n\n\"That's also well put,\" the Canadian replied.  \"But your proviso applies\nto any escape attempt, whether it happens in two years or two days.\nSo this is still the question:  if a promising opportunity comes up,\nwe have to grab it.\"\n\n\"Agreed.  And now, Ned, will you tell me what you mean by\na promising opportunity?\"\n\n\"One that leads the Nautilus on a cloudy night within a short\ndistance of some European coast.\"\n\n\"And you'll try to get away by swimming?\"\n\n\"Yes, if we're close enough to shore and the ship's afloat on\nthe surface.  No, if we're well out and the ship's navigating\nunder the waters.\"\n\n\"And in that event?\"\n\n\"In that event I'll try to get hold of the skiff.  I know how to\nhandle it.  We'll stick ourselves inside, undo the bolts, and rise\nto the surface, without the helmsman in the bow seeing a thing.\"\n\n\"Fine, Ned.  Stay on the lookout for such an opportunity,\nbut don't forget, one slipup will finish us.\"\n\n\"I won't forget, sir.\"\n\n\"And now, Ned, would you like to know my overall thinking on your plan?\"\n\n\"Gladly, Professor Aronnax.\"\n\n\"Well then, I think--and I don't mean 'I hope'--that your promising\nopportunity won't ever arise.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because Captain Nemo recognizes that we haven't given up all\nhope of recovering our freedom, and he'll keep on his guard,\nabove all in seas within sight of the coasts of Europe.\"\n\n\"I'm of master's opinion,\" Conseil said.\n\n\"We'll soon see,\" Ned Land replied, shaking his head with\na determined expression.\n\n\"And now, Ned Land,\" I added, \"let's leave it at that.  Not another word\non any of this.  The day you're ready, alert us and we're with you.\nI turn it all over to you.\"\n\nThat's how we ended this conversation, which later was to have\nsuch serious consequences.  At first, I must say, events seemed\nto confirm my forecasts, much to the Canadian's despair.\nDid Captain Nemo view us with distrust in these heavily traveled seas,\nor did he simply want to hide from the sight of those ships\nof every nation that plowed the Mediterranean?  I have no idea,\nbut usually he stayed in midwater and well out from any coast.\nEither the Nautilus surfaced only enough to let its pilothouse emerge,\nor it slipped away to the lower depths, although, between the\nGreek Islands and Asia Minor, we didn't find bottom even at\n2,000 meters down.\n\nAccordingly, I became aware of the isle of Karpathos, one of\nthe Sporades Islands, only when Captain Nemo placed his finger\nover a spot on the world map and quoted me this verse from Virgil:\n\nEst in Carpathio Neptuni gurgite vates\n\nCaeruleus Proteus . . .*\n\n*Latin: \"There in King Neptune's domain by Karpathos, his spokesman\n/ is azure-hued Proteus . . . \" Ed.\n\nIt was indeed that bygone abode of Proteus, the old shepherd of\nKing Neptune's flocks:  an island located between Rhodes and Crete,\nwhich Greeks now call Karpathos, Italians Scarpanto.  Through the lounge\nwindow I could see only its granite bedrock.\n\nThe next day, February 14, I decided to spend a few hours studying\nthe fish of this island group; but for whatever reason, the panels\nremained hermetically sealed.  After determining the Nautilus's heading,\nI noted that it was proceeding toward the ancient island of Crete,\nalso called Candia.  At the time I had shipped aboard the Abraham Lincoln,\nthis whole island was in rebellion against its tyrannical rulers,\nthe Ottoman Empire of Turkey.  But since then I had absolutely no idea\nwhat happened to this revolution, and Captain Nemo, deprived of all\ncontact with the shore, was hardly the man to keep me informed.\n\nSo I didn't allude to this event when, that evening, I chanced to be\nalone with the captain in the lounge.  Besides, he seemed silent\nand preoccupied.  Then, contrary to custom, he ordered that both\npanels in the lounge be opened, and going from the one to the other,\nhe carefully observed the watery mass.  For what purpose?\nI hadn't a guess, and for my part, I spent my time studying the fish\nthat passed before my eyes.\n\nAmong others I noted that sand goby mentioned by Aristotle and commonly\nknown by the name sea loach, which is encountered exclusively in the salty\nwaters next to the Nile Delta.  Near them some semiphosphorescent red\nporgy rolled by, a variety of gilthead that the Egyptians ranked among\ntheir sacred animals, lauding them in religious ceremonies when their\narrival in the river's waters announced the fertile flood season.\nI also noticed some wrasse known as the tapiro, three decimeters long,\nbony fish with transparent scales whose bluish gray color is mixed\nwith red spots; they're enthusiastic eaters of marine vegetables,\nwhich gives them an exquisite flavor; hence these tapiro were much\nin demand by the epicures of ancient Rome, and their entrails\nwere dressed with brains of peacock, tongue of flamingo,\nand testes of moray to make that divine platter that so enraptured\nthe Roman emperor Vitellius.\n\nAnother resident of these seas caught my attention and revived\nall my memories of antiquity.  This was the remora, which travels\nattached to the bellies of sharks; as the ancients tell it,\nwhen these little fish cling to the undersides of a ship, they can\nbring it to a halt, and by so impeding\n\nMark Antony's vessel during the Battle of Actium, one of them facilitated\nthe victory of Augustus Caesar.  From such slender threads hang\nthe destinies of nations!  I also observed some wonderful snappers\nbelonging to the order Lutianida, sacred fish for the Greeks, who claimed\nthey could drive off sea monsters from the waters they frequent;\ntheir Greek name anthias means \"flower,\" and they live up to it\nin the play of their colors and in those fleeting reflections that\nturn their dorsal fins into watered silk; their hues are confined\nto a gamut of reds, from the pallor of pink to the glow of ruby.\nI couldn't take my eyes off these marine wonders, when I was suddenly\njolted by an unexpected apparition.\n\nIn the midst of the waters, a man appeared, a diver carrying a little\nleather bag at his belt.  It was no corpse lost in the waves.\nIt was a living man, swimming vigorously, sometimes disappearing\nto breathe at the surface, then instantly diving again.\n\nI turned to Captain Nemo, and in an agitated voice:\n\n\"A man!  A castaway!\"  I exclaimed.  \"We must rescue him at all cost!\"\n\nThe captain didn't reply but went to lean against the window.\n\nThe man drew near, and gluing his face to the panel, he stared at us.\n\nTo my deep astonishment, Captain Nemo gave him a signal.\nThe diver answered with his hand, immediately swam up to the surface\nof the sea, and didn't reappear.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed,\" the captain told me.  \"That's Nicolas from\nCape Matapan, nicknamed 'Il Pesce.'* He's well known throughout\nthe Cyclades Islands.  A bold diver!  Water is his true element,\nand he lives in the sea more than on shore, going constantly from\none island to another, even to Crete.\"\n\n*Italian: \"The Fish.\"  Ed.\n\n\"You know him, captain?\"\n\n\"Why not, Professor Aronnax?\"\n\nThis said, Captain Nemo went to a cabinet standing near the lounge's\nleft panel.  Next to this cabinet I saw a chest bound with hoops\nof iron, its lid bearing a copper plaque that displayed the Nautilus's\nmonogram with its motto Mobilis in Mobili.\n\nJust then, ignoring my presence, the captain opened this cabinet,\na sort of safe that contained a large number of ingots.\n\nThey were gold ingots.  And they represented an enormous sum of money.\nWhere had this precious metal come from?  How had the captain\namassed this gold, and what was he about to do with it?\n\nI didn't pronounce a word.  I gaped.  Captain Nemo took out the ingots\none by one and arranged them methodically inside the chest, filling it\nto the top.  At which point I estimate that it held more than 1,000\nkilograms of gold, in other words, close to 5,000,000 francs.\n\nAfter securely fastening the chest, Captain Nemo wrote an address\non its lid in characters that must have been modern Greek.\n\nThis done, the captain pressed a button whose wiring was in\ncommunication with the crew's quarters.  Four men appeared and,\nnot without difficulty, pushed the chest out of the lounge.\nThen I heard them hoist it up the iron companionway by means of pulleys.\n\nJust then Captain Nemo turned to me:\n\n\"You were saying, professor?\" he asked me.\n\n\"I wasn't saying a thing, captain.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, with your permission, I'll bid you good evening.\"\n\nAnd with that, Captain Nemo left the lounge.\n\nI reentered my stateroom, very puzzled, as you can imagine.\nI tried in vain to fall asleep.  I kept searching for a relationship\nbetween the appearance of the diver and that chest filled with gold.\nSoon, from certain rolling and pitching movements, I sensed that\nthe Nautilus had left the lower strata and was back on the surface\nof the water.\n\nThen I heard the sound of footsteps on the platform.\nI realized that the skiff was being detached and launched to sea.\nFor an instant it bumped the Nautilus's side, then all sounds ceased.\n\nTwo hours later, the same noises, the same comings and goings,\nwere repeated.  Hoisted on board, the longboat was readjusted into\nits socket, and the Nautilus plunged back beneath the waves.\n\nSo those millions had been delivered to their address.  At what spot\non the continent?  Who was the recipient of Captain Nemo's gold?\n\nThe next day I related the night's events to Conseil and the Canadian,\nevents that had aroused my curiosity to a fever pitch.\nMy companions were as startled as I was.\n\n\"But where does he get those millions?\"  Ned Land asked.\n\nTo this no reply was possible.  After breakfast I made my way\nto the lounge and went about my work.  I wrote up my notes until\nfive o'clock in the afternoon.  Just then--was it due to some\npersonal indisposition?--I felt extremely hot and had to take off\nmy jacket made of fan mussel fabric.  A perplexing circumstance\nbecause we weren't in the low latitudes, and besides, once the Nautilus\nwas submerged, it shouldn't be subject to any rise in temperature.\nI looked at the pressure gauge.  It marked a depth of sixty feet,\na depth beyond the reach of atmospheric heat.\n\nI kept on working, but the temperature rose to the point\nof becoming unbearable.\n\n\"Could there be a fire on board?\"  I wondered.\n\nI was about to leave the lounge when Captain Nemo entered.\nHe approached the thermometer, consulted it, and turned to me:\n\n\"42 degrees centigrade,\" he said.\n\n\"I've detected as much, captain,\" I replied, \"and if it gets even\nslightly hotter, we won't be able to stand it.\"\n\n\"Oh, professor, it won't get any hotter unless we want it to!\"\n\n\"You mean you can control this heat?\"\n\n\"No, but I can back away from the fireplace producing it.\"\n\n\"So it's outside?\"\n\n\"Surely.  We're cruising in a current of boiling water.\"\n\n\"It can't be!\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"Look.\"\n\nThe panels had opened, and I could see a completely white\nsea around the Nautilus.  Steaming sulfurous fumes uncoiled\nin the midst of waves bubbling like water in a boiler.\nI leaned my hand against one of the windows, but the heat was so great,\nI had to snatch it back.\n\n\"Where are we?\"  I asked.\n\n\"Near the island of Santorini, professor,\" the captain answered me,\n\"and right in the channel that separates the volcanic islets\nof Nea Kameni and Palea Kameni.  I wanted to offer you the unusual\nsight of an underwater eruption.\"\n\n\"I thought,\" I said, \"that the formation of such new islands had\ncome to an end.\"\n\n\"Nothing ever comes to an end in these volcanic waterways,\"\nCaptain Nemo replied, \"and thanks to its underground fires,\nour globe is continuously under construction in these regions.\nAccording to the Latin historians Cassiodorus and Pliny, by the year\n19 of the Christian era, a new island, the divine Thera, had already\nappeared in the very place these islets have more recently formed.\nThen Thera sank under the waves, only to rise and sink once more\nin the year 69 A.D. From that day to this, such plutonic construction\nwork has been in abeyance.  But on February 3, 1866, a new islet\nnamed George Island emerged in the midst of sulfurous steam near\nNea Kameni and was fused to it on the 6th of the same month.\nSeven days later, on February 13, the islet of Aphroessa appeared,\nleaving a ten-meter channel between itself and Nea Kameni.  I was\nin these seas when that phenomenon occurred and I was able to observe\nits every phase.  The islet of Aphroessa was circular in shape,\nmeasuring 300 feet in diameter and thirty feet in height.\nIt was made of black, glassy lava mixed with bits of feldspar.\nFinally, on March 10, a smaller islet called Reka appeared next to\nNea Kameni, and since then, these three islets have fused to form\none single, selfsame island.\"\n\n\"What about this channel we're in right now?\"  I asked.\n\n\"Here it is,\" Captain Nemo replied, showing me a chart of the\nGreek Islands.  \"You observe that I've entered the new islets\nin their place.\"\n\n\"But will this channel fill up one day?\"\n\n\"Very likely, Professor Aronnax, because since 1866 eight little\nlava islets have surged up in front of the port of St. Nicolas\non Palea Kameni.  So it's obvious that Nea and Palea will join\nin days to come.  In the middle of the Pacific, tiny infusoria\nbuild continents, but here they're built by volcanic phenomena.\nLook, sir!  Look at the construction work going on under these waves.\"\n\nI returned to the window.  The Nautilus was no longer moving.\nThe heat had become unbearable.  From the white it had recently been,\nthe sea was turning red, a coloration caused by the presence\nof iron salts.  Although the lounge was hermetically sealed, it was\nfilling with an intolerable stink of sulfur, and I could see scarlet\nflames of such brightness, they overpowered our electric light.\n\nI was swimming in perspiration, I was stifling, I was about to be cooked.\nYes, I felt myself cooking in actual fact!\n\n\"We can't stay any longer in this boiling water,\" I told the captain.\n\n\"No, it wouldn't be advisable,\" replied Nemo the Emotionless.\n\nHe gave an order.  The Nautilus tacked about and retreated from this\nfurnace it couldn't brave with impunity.  A quarter of an hour later,\nwe were breathing fresh air on the surface of the waves.\n\nIt then occurred to me that if Ned had chosen these waterways\nfor our escape attempt, we wouldn't have come out alive from this\nsea of fire.\n\nThe next day, February 16, we left this basin, which tallies depths\nof 3,000 meters between Rhodes and Alexandria, and passing well out\nfrom Cerigo Island after doubling Cape Matapan, the Nautilus left\nthe Greek Islands behind.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nThe Mediterranean in Forty-Eight Hours\n\n\nTHE MEDITERRANEAN, your ideal blue sea:  to Greeks simply \"the sea,\"\nto Hebrews \"the great sea,\" to Romans mare nostrum.* Bordered\nby orange trees, aloes, cactus, and maritime pine trees,\nperfumed with the scent of myrtle, framed by rugged mountains,\nsaturated with clean, transparent air but continuously under\nconstruction by fires in the earth, this sea is a genuine battlefield\nwhere Neptune and Pluto still struggle for world domination.\nHere on these beaches and waters, says the French historian Michelet,\na man is revived by one of the most invigorating climates in the world.\n\n*Latin: \"our sea.\"  Ed.\n\nBut as beautiful as it was, I could get only a quick look at this\nbasin whose surface area comprises 2,000,000 square kilometers.\nEven Captain Nemo's personal insights were denied me,\nbecause that mystifying individual didn't appear one single time\nduring our high-speed crossing.  I estimate that the Nautilus\ncovered a track of some 600 leagues under the waves of this sea,\nand this voyage was accomplished in just twenty-four hours times two.\nDeparting from the waterways of Greece on the morning of February 16,\nwe cleared the Strait of Gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th.\n\nIt was obvious to me that this Mediterranean, pinned in the middle\nof those shores he wanted to avoid, gave Captain Nemo no pleasure.\nIts waves and breezes brought back too many memories, if not too\nmany regrets.  Here he no longer had the ease of movement and freedom\nof maneuver that the oceans allowed him, and his Nautilus felt\ncramped so close to the coasts of both Africa and Europe.\n\nAccordingly, our speed was twenty-five miles (that is,\ntwelve four-kilometer leagues) per hour.  Needless to say,\nNed Land had to give up his escape plans, much to his distress.\nSwept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second,\nhe could hardly make use of the skiff.  Leaving the Nautilus\nunder these conditions would have been like jumping off a train\nracing at this speed, a rash move if there ever was one.\nMoreover, to renew our air supply, the submersible rose to the surface\nof the waves only at night, and relying solely on compass and log,\nit steered by dead reckoning.\n\nInside the Mediterranean, then, I could catch no more of\nits fast-passing scenery than a traveler might see from an\nexpress train; in other words, I could view only the distant\nhorizons because the foregrounds flashed by like lightning.\nBut Conseil and I were able to observe those Mediterranean fish\nwhose powerful fins kept pace for a while in the Nautilus's waters.\nWe stayed on watch before the lounge windows, and our notes enable\nme to reconstruct, in a few words, the ichthyology of this sea.\n\nAmong the various fish inhabiting it, some I viewed, others I glimpsed,\nand the rest I missed completely because of the Nautilus's speed.\nKindly allow me to sort them out using this whimsical system\nof classification.  It will at least convey the quickness\nof my observations.\n\nIn the midst of the watery mass, brightly lit by our electric beams,\nthere snaked past those one-meter lampreys that are common\nto nearly every clime.  A type of ray from the genus Oxyrhynchus,\nfive feet wide, had a white belly with a spotted, ash-gray back\nand was carried along by the currents like a huge, wide-open shawl.\nOther rays passed by so quickly I couldn't tell if they deserved that\nname \"eagle ray\" coined by the ancient Greeks, or those designations\nof \"rat ray,\" \"bat ray,\" and \"toad ray\" that modern fishermen\nhave inflicted on them.  Dogfish known as topes, twelve feet long\nand especially feared by divers, were racing with each other.\nLooking like big bluish shadows, thresher sharks went by,\neight feet long and gifted with an extremely acute sense of smell.\nDorados from the genus Sparus, some measuring up to thirteen\ndecimeters, appeared in silver and azure costumes encircled\nwith ribbons, which contrasted with the dark color of their fins;\nfish sacred to the goddess Venus, their eyes set in brows of gold;\na valuable species that patronizes all waters fresh or salt,\nequally at home in rivers, lakes, and oceans, living in every clime,\ntolerating any temperature, their line dating back to prehistoric times\non this earth yet preserving all its beauty from those far-off days.\nMagnificent sturgeons, nine to ten meters long and extremely fast,\nbanged their powerful tails against the glass of our panels,\nshowing bluish backs with small brown spots; they resemble sharks,\nwithout equaling their strength, and are encountered in every sea;\nin the spring they delight in swimming up the great rivers,\nfighting the currents of the Volga, Danube, Po, Rhine, Loire, and Oder,\nwhile feeding on herring, mackerel, salmon, and codfish; although they\nbelong to the class of cartilaginous fish, they rate as a delicacy;\nthey're eaten fresh, dried, marinated, or salt-preserved,\nand in olden times they were borne in triumph to the table of\nthe Roman epicure Lucullus.\n\nBut whenever the Nautilus drew near the surface, those denizens\nof the Mediterranean I could observe most productively belonged\nto the sixty-third genus of bony fish.  These were tuna from\nthe genus Scomber, blue-black on top, silver on the belly armor,\ntheir dorsal stripes giving off a golden gleam.  They are said to\nfollow ships in search of refreshing shade from the hot tropical sun,\nand they did just that with the Nautilus, as they had once done\nwith the vessels of the Count de La P\u00e9rouse. For long hours they\ncompeted in speed with our submersible.  I couldn't stop marveling\nat these animals so perfectly cut out for racing, their heads small,\ntheir bodies sleek, spindle-shaped, and in some cases over three\nmeters long, their pectoral fins gifted with remarkable strength,\ntheir caudal fins forked.  Like certain flocks of birds, whose speed\nthey equal, these tuna swim in triangle formation, which prompted\nthe ancients to say they'd boned up on geometry and military strategy.\nAnd yet they can't escape the Proven\u00e7al fishermen, who prize them\nas highly as did the ancient inhabitants of Turkey and Italy;\nand these valuable animals, as oblivious as if they were deaf\nand blind, leap right into the Marseilles tuna nets and perish\nby the thousands.\n\nJust for the record, I'll mention those Mediterranean fish\nthat Conseil and I barely glimpsed.  There were whitish eels\nof the species Gymnotus fasciatus that passed like elusive wisps\nof steam, conger eels three to four meters long that were tricked\nout in green, blue, and yellow, three-foot hake with a liver\nthat makes a dainty morsel, wormfish drifting like thin seaweed,\nsea robins that poets call lyrefish and seamen pipers and whose snouts\nhave two jagged triangular plates shaped like old Homer's lyre,\nswallowfish swimming as fast as the bird they're named after,\nredheaded groupers whose dorsal fins are trimmed with filaments,\nsome shad (spotted with black, gray, brown, blue, yellow, and green)\nthat actually respond to tinkling handbells, splendid diamond-shaped\nturbot that were like aquatic pheasants with yellowish fins stippled\nin brown and the left topside mostly marbled in brown and yellow,\nfinally schools of wonderful red mullet, real oceanic birds of paradise\nthat ancient Romans bought for as much as 10,000 sesterces apiece,\nand which they killed at the table, so they could heartlessly watch it\nchange color from cinnabar red when alive to pallid white when dead.\n\nAnd as for other fish common to the Atlantic and Mediterranean, I was\nunable to observe miralets, triggerfish, puffers, seahorses,\njewelfish, trumpetfish, blennies, gray mullet, wrasse, smelt,\nflying fish, anchovies, sea bream, porgies, garfish, or any of\nthe chief representatives of the order Pleuronecta, such as sole,\nflounder, plaice, dab, and brill, simply because of the dizzying\nspeed with which the Nautilus hustled through these opulent waters.\n\nAs for marine mammals, on passing by the mouth of the Adriatic Sea, I\nthought I recognized two or three sperm whales equipped with the single\ndorsal fin denoting the genus Physeter, some pilot whales from\nthe genus Globicephalus exclusive to the Mediterranean, the forepart\nof the head striped with small distinct lines, and also a dozen\nseals with white bellies and black coats, known by the name monk\nseals and just as solemn as if they were three-meter Dominicans.\n\nFor his part, Conseil thought he spotted a turtle six feet wide\nand adorned with three protruding ridges that ran lengthwise.\nI was sorry to miss this reptile, because from Conseil's description,\nI believe I recognized the leatherback turtle, a pretty rare species.\nFor my part, I noted only some loggerhead turtles with long carapaces.\n\nAs for zoophytes, for a few moments I was able to marvel at a wonderful,\norange-hued hydra from the genus Galeolaria that clung to the glass\nof our port panel; it consisted of a long, lean filament that spread\nout into countless branches and ended in the most delicate lace\never spun by the followers of Arachne.  Unfortunately I couldn't\nfish up this wonderful specimen, and surely no other Mediterranean\nzoophytes would have been offered to my gaze, if, on the evening\nof the 16th, the Nautilus hadn't slowed down in an odd fashion.\nThis was the situation.\n\nBy then we were passing between Sicily and the coast\nof Tunisia.  In the cramped space between Cape Bon and the\nStrait of Messina, the sea bottom rises almost all at once.\nIt forms an actual ridge with only seventeen meters of water\nremaining above it, while the depth on either side is 170 meters.\nConsequently, the Nautilus had to maneuver with caution so as not\nto bump into this underwater barrier.\n\nI showed Conseil the position of this long reef on our chart\nof the Mediterranean.\n\n\"But with all due respect to master,\" Conseil ventured to observe,\n\"it's like an actual isthmus connecting Europe to Africa.\"\n\n\"Yes, my boy,\" I replied, \"it cuts across the whole Strait of Sicily,\nand Smith's soundings prove that in the past, these two continents\nwere genuinely connected between Cape Boeo and Cape Farina.\"\n\n\"I can easily believe it,\" Conseil said.\n\n\"I might add,\" I went on, \"that there's a similar barrier between\nGibraltar and Ceuta, and in prehistoric times it closed off\nthe Mediterranean completely.\"\n\n\"Gracious!\"  Conseil put in.  \"Suppose one day some volcanic upheaval\nraises these two barriers back above the waves!\"\n\n\"That's most unlikely, Conseil.\"\n\n\"If master will allow me to finish, I mean that if this phenomenon occurs,\nit might prove distressing to Mr. de Lesseps, who has gone to such\npains to cut through his isthmus!\"\n\n\"Agreed, but I repeat, Conseil:  such a phenomenon won't occur.\nThe intensity of these underground forces continues to diminish.\nVolcanoes were quite numerous in the world's early days, but they're\ngoing extinct one by one; the heat inside the earth is growing weaker,\nthe temperature in the globe's lower strata is cooling appreciably\nevery century, and to our globe's detriment, because its heat\nis its life.\"\n\n\"But the sun--\"\n\n\"The sun isn't enough, Conseil.  Can it restore heat to a corpse?\"\n\n\"Not that I've heard.\"\n\n\"Well, my friend, someday the earth will be just such a cold corpse.\nLike the moon, which long ago lost its vital heat, our globe will\nbecome lifeless and unlivable.\"\n\n\"In how many centuries?\"  Conseil asked.\n\n\"In hundreds of thousands of years, my boy.\"\n\n\"Then we have ample time to finish our voyage,\" Conseil replied,\n\"if Ned Land doesn't mess things up!\"\n\nThus reassured, Conseil went back to studying the shallows that\nthe Nautilus was skimming at moderate speed.\n\nOn the rocky, volcanic seafloor, there bloomed quite a collection\nof moving flora:  sponges, sea cucumbers, jellyfish called sea\ngooseberries that were adorned with reddish tendrils and gave off\na subtle phosphorescence, members of the genus Beroe that are commonly\nknown by the name melon jellyfish and are bathed in the shimmer\nof the whole solar spectrum, free-swimming crinoids one meter wide\nthat reddened the waters with their crimson hue, treelike basket\nstars of the greatest beauty, sea fans from the genus Pavonacea\nwith long stems, numerous edible sea urchins of various species,\nplus green sea anemones with a grayish trunk and a brown disk lost\nbeneath the olive-colored tresses of their tentacles.\n\nConseil kept especially busy observing mollusks and articulates,\nand although his catalog is a little dry, I wouldn't want to wrong\nthe gallant lad by leaving out his personal observations.\n\nFrom the branch Mollusca, he mentions numerous comb-shaped scallops,\nhooflike spiny oysters piled on top of each other, triangular coquina,\nthree-pronged glass snails with yellow fins and transparent shells,\norange snails from the genus Pleurobranchus that looked like eggs spotted\nor speckled with greenish dots, members of the genus Aplysia also known\nby the name sea hares, other sea hares from the genus Dolabella,\nplump paper-bubble shells, umbrella shells exclusive to the Mediterranean,\nabalone whose shell produces a mother-of-pearl much in demand,\npilgrim scallops, saddle shells that diners in the French\nprovince of Languedoc are said to like better than oysters,\nsome of those cockleshells so dear to the citizens of Marseilles,\nfat white venus shells that are among the clams so abundant off\nthe coasts of North America and eaten in such quantities by New Yorkers,\nvariously colored comb shells with gill covers, burrowing date\nmussels with a peppery flavor I relish, furrowed heart cockles whose\nshells have riblike ridges on their arching summits, triton shells\npocked with scarlet bumps, carniaira snails with backward-curving\ntips that make them resemble flimsy gondolas, crowned ferola snails,\natlanta snails with spiral shells, gray nudibranchs from the genus\nTethys that were spotted with white and covered by fringed mantles,\nnudibranchs from the suborder Eolidea that looked like small slugs,\nsea butterflies crawling on their backs, seashells from the genus Auricula\nincluding the oval-shaped Auricula myosotis, tan wentletrap snails,\ncommon periwinkles, violet snails, cineraira snails, rock borers,\near shells, cabochon snails, pandora shells, etc.\n\nAs for the articulates, in his notes Conseil has very appropriately\ndivided them into six classes, three of which belong to the marine world.\nThese classes are the Crustacea, Cirripedia, and Annelida.\n\nCrustaceans are subdivided into nine orders, and the first of\nthese consists of the decapods, in other words, animals whose head\nand thorax are usually fused, whose cheek-and-mouth mechanism is\nmade up of several pairs of appendages, and whose thorax has four,\nfive, or six pairs of walking legs.  Conseil used the methods\nof our mentor Professor Milne-Edwards, who puts the decapods\nin three divisions:  Brachyura, Macrura, and Anomura.  These names\nmay look a tad fierce, but they're accurate and appropriate.\nAmong the Brachyura, Conseil mentions some amanthia crabs whose fronts\nwere armed with two big diverging tips, those inachus scorpions that--\nlord knows why--symbolized wisdom to the ancient Greeks, spider crabs\nof the massena and spinimane varieties that had probably gone astray\nin these shallows because they usually live in the lower depths,\nxanthid crabs, pilumna crabs, rhomboid crabs, granular box crabs\n(easy on the digestion, as Conseil ventured to observe), toothless\nmasked crabs, ebalia crabs, cymopolia crabs, woolly-handed crabs, etc.\nAmong the Macrura (which are subdivided into five families:\nhardshells, burrowers, crayfish, prawns, and ghost crabs)\nConseil mentions some common spiny lobsters whose females supply a meat\nhighly prized, slipper lobsters or common shrimp, waterside gebia shrimp,\nand all sorts of edible species, but he says nothing of the crayfish\nsubdivision that includes the true lobster, because spiny lobsters\nare the only type in the Mediterranean.  Finally, among the Anomura,\nhe saw common drocina crabs dwelling inside whatever abandoned\nseashells they could take over, homola crabs with spiny fronts,\nhermit crabs, hairy porcelain crabs, etc.\n\nThere Conseil's work came to a halt.  He didn't have time to finish\noff the class Crustacea through an examination of its stomatopods,\namphipods, homopods, isopods, trilobites, branchiopods, ostracods,\nand entomostraceans.  And in order to complete his study of\nmarine articulates, he needed to mention the class Cirripedia,\nwhich contains water fleas and carp lice, plus the class Annelida,\nwhich he would have divided without fail into tubifex worms and\ndorsibranchian worms.  But having gone past the shallows of the Strait\nof Sicily, the Nautilus resumed its usual deep-water speed.\nFrom then on, no more mollusks, no more zoophytes, no more articulates.\nJust a few large fish sweeping by like shadows.\n\nDuring the night of February 16-17, we entered the second\nMediterranean basin, whose maximum depth we found at 3,000 meters.\nThe Nautilus, driven downward by its propeller and slanting fins,\ndescended to the lowest strata of this sea.\n\nThere, in place of natural wonders, the watery mass offered\nsome thrilling and dreadful scenes to my eyes.  In essence,\nwe were then crossing that part of the whole Mediterranean so fertile\nin casualties.  From the coast of Algiers to the beaches of Provence,\nhow many ships have wrecked, how many vessels have vanished!\nCompared to the vast liquid plains of the Pacific, the Mediterranean\nis a mere lake, but it's an unpredictable lake with fickle waves,\ntoday kindly and affectionate to those frail single-masters drifting\nbetween a double ultramarine of sky and water, tomorrow bad-tempered\nand turbulent, agitated by the winds, demolishing the strongest\nships beneath sudden waves that smash down with a headlong wallop.\n\nSo, in our swift cruise through these deep strata, how many vessels I\nsaw lying on the seafloor, some already caked with coral, others clad\nonly in a layer of rust, plus anchors, cannons, shells, iron fittings,\npropeller blades, parts of engines, cracked cylinders, staved-in boilers,\nthen hulls floating in midwater, here upright, there overturned.\n\nSome of these wrecked ships had perished in collisions, others from\nhitting granite reefs.  I saw a few that had sunk straight down,\ntheir masting still upright, their rigging stiffened by the water.\nThey looked like they were at anchor by some immense, open,\noffshore mooring where they were waiting for their departure time.\nWhen the Nautilus passed between them, covering them with sheets\nof electricity, they seemed ready to salute us with their colors\nand send us their serial numbers!  But no, nothing but silence\nand death filled this field of catastrophes!\n\nI observed that these Mediterranean depths became more and more\ncluttered with such gruesome wreckage as the Nautilus drew nearer\nto the Strait of Gibraltar.  By then the shores of Africa and Europe\nwere converging, and in this narrow space collisions were commonplace.\nThere I saw numerous iron undersides, the phantasmagoric ruins\nof steamers, some lying down, others rearing up like fearsome animals.\nOne of these boats made a dreadful first impression:\nsides torn open, funnel bent, paddle wheels stripped to the mountings,\nrudder separated from the sternpost and still hanging from an\niron chain, the board on its stern eaten away by marine salts!\nHow many lives were dashed in this shipwreck!  How many victims\nwere swept under the waves!  Had some sailor on board lived\nto tell the story of this dreadful disaster, or do the waves still\nkeep this casualty a secret?  It occurred to me, lord knows why,\nthat this boat buried under the sea might have been the Atlas,\nlost with all hands some twenty years ago and never heard from again!\nOh, what a gruesome tale these Mediterranean depths could tell,\nthis huge boneyard where so much wealth has been lost, where so many\nvictims have met their deaths!\n\nMeanwhile, briskly unconcerned, the Nautilus ran at full propeller\nthrough the midst of these ruins.  On February 18, near three o'clock\nin the morning, it hove before the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar.\n\nThere are two currents here:  an upper current, long known to exist,\nthat carries the ocean's waters into the Mediterranean basin;\nthen a lower countercurrent, the only present-day proof of its existence\nbeing logic.  In essence, the Mediterranean receives a continual influx\nof water not only from the Atlantic but from rivers emptying into it;\nsince local evaporation isn't enough to restore the balance, the total\namount of added water should make this sea's level higher every year.\nYet this isn't the case, and we're naturally forced to believe in\nthe existence of some lower current that carries the Mediterranean's\nsurplus through the Strait of Gibraltar and into the Atlantic basin.\n\nAnd so it turned out.  The Nautilus took full advantage of\nthis countercurrent.  It advanced swiftly through this narrow passageway.\nFor an instant I could glimpse the wonderful ruins of the Temple\nof Hercules, buried undersea, as Pliny and Avianus have mentioned,\ntogether with the flat island they stand on; and a few minutes later,\nwe were floating on the waves of the Atlantic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nThe Bay of Vigo\n\n\nTHE ATLANTIC!  A vast expanse of water whose surface area is 25,000,000\nsquare miles, with a length of 9,000 miles and an average width\nof 2,700. A major sea nearly unknown to the ancients, except perhaps\nthe Carthaginians, those Dutchmen of antiquity who went along\nthe west coasts of Europe and Africa on their commercial junkets!\nAn ocean whose parallel winding shores form an immense perimeter\nfed by the world's greatest rivers:  the St. Lawrence, Mississippi,\nAmazon, Plata, Orinoco, Niger, Senegal, Elbe, Loire, and Rhine,\nwhich bring it waters from the most civilized countries as well\nas the most undeveloped areas!  A magnificent plain of waves plowed\ncontinuously by ships of every nation, shaded by every flag in the world,\nand ending in those two dreadful headlands so feared by navigators,\nCape Horn and the Cape of Tempests!\n\nThe Nautilus broke these waters with the edge of its spur after\ndoing nearly 10,000 leagues in three and a half months, a track\nlonger than a great circle of the earth.  Where were we heading now,\nand what did the future have in store for us?\n\nEmerging from the Strait of Gibraltar, the Nautilus took to the\nhigh seas.  It returned to the surface of the waves, so our daily\nstrolls on the platform were restored to us.\n\nI climbed onto it instantly, Ned Land and Conseil along with me.\nTwelve miles away, Cape St. Vincent was hazily visible, the southwestern\ntip of the Hispanic peninsula.  The wind was blowing a pretty\nstrong gust from the south.  The sea was swelling and surging.\nIts waves made the Nautilus roll and jerk violently.\nIt was nearly impossible to stand up on the platform,\nwhich was continuously buffeted by this enormously heavy sea.\nAfter inhaling a few breaths of air, we went below once more.\n\nI repaired to my stateroom.  Conseil returned to his cabin;\nbut the Canadian, looking rather worried, followed me.  Our quick\ntrip through the Mediterranean hadn't allowed him to put his plans\ninto execution, and he could barely conceal his disappointment.\n\nAfter the door to my stateroom was closed, he sat and stared\nat me silently.\n\n\"Ned my friend,\" I told him, \"I know how you feel, but you mustn't\nblame yourself.  Given the way the Nautilus was navigating,\nit would have been sheer insanity to think of escaping!\"\n\nNed Land didn't reply.  His pursed lips and frowning brow indicated\nthat he was in the grip of his monomania.\n\n\"Look here,\" I went on, \"as yet there's no cause for despair.\nWe're going up the coast of Portugal.  France and England aren't\nfar off, and there we'll easily find refuge.  Oh, I grant you,\nif the Nautilus had emerged from the Strait of Gibraltar and made\nfor that cape in the south, if it were taking us toward those\nregions that have no continents, then I'd share your alarm.\nBut we now know that Captain Nemo doesn't avoid the seas of civilization,\nand in a few days I think we can safely take action.\"\n\nNed Land stared at me still more intently and finally unpursed his lips:\n\n\"We'll do it this evening,\" he said.\n\nI straightened suddenly.  I admit that I was less than ready\nfor this announcement.  I wanted to reply to the Canadian,\nbut words failed me.\n\n\"We agreed to wait for the right circumstances,\" Ned Land went on.\n\"Now we've got those circumstances.  This evening we'll be just\na few miles off the coast of Spain.  It'll be cloudy tonight.\nThe wind's blowing toward shore.  You gave me your promise,\nProfessor Aronnax, and I'm counting on you.\"\n\nSince I didn't say anything, the Canadian stood up and approached me:\n\n\"We'll do it this evening at nine o'clock,\" he said.\n\"I've alerted Conseil.  By that time Captain Nemo will be locked in his\nroom and probably in bed.  Neither the mechanics or the crewmen will be\nable to see us.  Conseil and I will go to the central companionway.\nAs for you, Professor Aronnax, you'll stay in the library two\nsteps away and wait for my signal.  The oars, mast, and sail are\nin the skiff.  I've even managed to stow some provisions inside.\nI've gotten hold of a monkey wrench to unscrew the nuts bolting\nthe skiff to the Nautilus's hull.  So everything's ready.\nI'll see you this evening.\"\n\n\"The sea is rough,\" I said.\n\n\"Admitted,\" the Canadian replied, \"but we've got to risk it.\nFreedom is worth paying for.  Besides, the longboat's solidly built,\nand a few miles with the wind behind us is no big deal.\nBy tomorrow, who knows if this ship won't be 100 leagues out to sea?\nIf circumstances are in our favor, between ten and eleven this evening\nwe'll be landing on some piece of solid ground, or we'll be dead.\nSo we're in God's hands, and I'll see you this evening!\"\n\nThis said, the Canadian withdrew, leaving me close to dumbfounded.\nI had imagined that if it came to this, I would have time to think\nabout it, to talk it over.  My stubborn companion hadn't granted\nme this courtesy.  But after all, what would I have said to him?\nNed Land was right a hundred times over.  These were near-ideal\ncircumstances, and he was taking full advantage of them.\nIn my selfish personal interests, could I go back on my word\nand be responsible for ruining the future lives of my companions?\nTomorrow, might not Captain Nemo take us far away from any shore?\n\nJust then a fairly loud hissing told me that the ballast tanks\nwere filling, and the Nautilus sank beneath the waves of the Atlantic.\n\nI stayed in my stateroom.  I wanted to avoid the captain, to hide from\nhis eyes the agitation overwhelming me.  What an agonizing day I spent,\ntorn between my desire to regain my free will and my regret at abandoning\nthis marvelous Nautilus, leaving my underwater research incomplete!\nHow could I relinquish this ocean--\"my own Atlantic,\" as I liked\nto call it--without observing its lower strata, without wresting\nfrom it the kinds of secrets that had been revealed to me by the seas\nof the East Indies and the Pacific!  I was putting down my novel\nhalf read, I was waking up as my dream neared its climax!\nHow painfully the hours passed, as I sometimes envisioned myself\nsafe on shore with my companions, or, despite my better judgment,\nas I sometimes wished that some unforeseen circumstances would\nprevent Ned Land from carrying out his plans.\n\nTwice I went to the lounge.  I wanted to consult the compass.\nI wanted to see if the Nautilus's heading was actually taking\nus closer to the coast or spiriting us farther away.  But no.\nThe Nautilus was still in Portuguese waters.  Heading north,\nit was cruising along the ocean's beaches.\n\nSo I had to resign myself to my fate and get ready to escape.\nMy baggage wasn't heavy.  My notes, nothing more.\n\nAs for Captain Nemo, I wondered what he would make of our escaping,\nwhat concern or perhaps what distress it might cause him, and what\nhe would do in the twofold event of our attempt either failing or being\nfound out!  Certainly I had no complaints to register with him,\non the contrary.  Never was hospitality more wholehearted than his.\nYet in leaving him I couldn't be accused of ingratitude.\nNo solemn promises bound us to him.  In order to keep us captive,\nhe had counted only on the force of circumstances and not on our\nword of honor.  But his avowed intention to imprison us forever\non his ship justified our every effort.\n\nI hadn't seen the captain since our visit to the island of Santorini.\nWould fate bring me into his presence before our departure?\nI both desired and dreaded it.  I listened for footsteps\nin the stateroom adjoining mine.  Not a sound reached my ear.\nHis stateroom had to be deserted.\n\nThen I began to wonder if this eccentric individual was even on board.\nSince that night when the skiff had left the Nautilus on some\nmysterious mission, my ideas about him had subtly changed.\nIn spite of everything, I thought that Captain Nemo must\nhave kept up some type of relationship with the shore.\nDid he himself never leave the Nautilus?  Whole weeks had often gone\nby without my encountering him.  What was he doing all the while?\nDuring all those times I'd thought he was convalescing in the grip\nof some misanthropic fit, was he instead far away from the ship,\ninvolved in some secret activity whose nature still eluded me?\n\nAll these ideas and a thousand others assaulted me at the same time.\nIn these strange circumstances the scope for conjecture was unlimited.\nI felt an unbearable queasiness.  This day of waiting seemed endless.\nThe hours struck too slowly to keep up with my impatience.\n\nAs usual, dinner was served me in my stateroom.  Full of anxiety,\nI ate little.  I left the table at seven o'clock. 120 minutes--\nI was keeping track of them--still separated me from the\nmoment I was to rejoin Ned Land.  My agitation increased.\nMy pulse was throbbing violently.  I couldn't stand still.\nI walked up and down, hoping to calm my troubled mind with movement.\nThe possibility of perishing in our reckless undertaking was the least\nof my worries; my heart was pounding at the thought that our plans\nmight be discovered before we had left the Nautilus, at the thought\nof being hauled in front of Captain Nemo and finding him angered,\nor worse, saddened by my deserting him.\n\nI wanted to see the lounge one last time.  I went down the gangways\nand arrived at the museum where I had spent so many pleasant and\nproductive hours.  I stared at all its wealth, all its treasures, like a\nman on the eve of his eternal exile, a man departing to return no more.\nFor so many days now, these natural wonders and artistic masterworks had\nbeen central to my life, and I was about to leave them behind forever.\nI wanted to plunge my eyes through the lounge window and into\nthese Atlantic waters; but the panels were hermetically sealed,\nand a mantle of sheet iron separated me from this ocean with which I\nwas still unfamiliar.\n\nCrossing through the lounge, I arrived at the door, contrived in one\nof the canted corners, that opened into the captain's stateroom.\nMuch to my astonishment, this door was ajar.  I instinctively recoiled.\nIf Captain Nemo was in his stateroom, he might see me.\nBut, not hearing any sounds, I approached.  The stateroom was deserted.\nI pushed the door open.  I took a few steps inside.\nStill the same austere, monastic appearance.\n\nJust then my eye was caught by some etchings hanging on the wall,\nwhich I hadn't noticed during my first visit.  They were portraits\nof great men of history who had spent their lives in perpetual\ndevotion to a great human ideal:  Thaddeus Kosciusko, the hero\nwhose dying words had been Finis Poloniae;* Markos Botzaris,\nfor modern Greece the reincarnation of Sparta's King Leonidas;\nDaniel O'Connell, Ireland's defender; George Washington,\nfounder of the American Union; Daniele Manin, the Italian patriot;\nAbraham Lincoln, dead from the bullet of a believer in slavery;\nand finally, that martyr for the redemption of the black race,\nJohn Brown, hanging from his gallows as Victor Hugo's pencil has\nso terrifyingly depicted.\n\n*Latin: \"Save Poland's borders.\"  Ed.\n\nWhat was the bond between these heroic souls and the soul\nof Captain Nemo?  From this collection of portraits could I\nfinally unravel the mystery of his existence?  Was he a fighter\nfor oppressed peoples, a liberator of enslaved races?  Had he figured\nin the recent political or social upheavals of this century?\nWas he a hero of that dreadful civil war in America, a war lamentable\nyet forever glorious . . . ?\n\nSuddenly the clock struck eight.  The first stroke of its hammer\non the chime snapped me out of my musings.  I shuddered as if some\ninvisible eye had plunged into my innermost thoughts, and I rushed\noutside the stateroom.\n\nThere my eyes fell on the compass.  Our heading was still northerly.\nThe log indicated a moderate speed, the pressure gauge a depth of about\nsixty feet.  So circumstances were in favor of the Canadian's plans.\n\nI stayed in my stateroom.  I dressed warmly:  fishing boots, otter cap,\ncoat of fan-mussel fabric lined with sealskin.  I was ready.\nI was waiting.  Only the propeller's vibrations disturbed the deep\nsilence reigning on board.  I cocked an ear and listened.\nWould a sudden outburst of voices tell me that Ned Land's escape plans\nhad just been detected?  A ghastly uneasiness stole through me.\nI tried in vain to recover my composure.\n\nA few minutes before nine o'clock, I glued my ear to the captain's door.\nNot a sound.  I left my stateroom and returned to the lounge,\nwhich was deserted and plunged in near darkness.\n\nI opened the door leading to the library.  The same inadequate light,\nthe same solitude.  I went to man my post near the door opening into\nthe well of the central companionway.  I waited for Ned Land's signal.\n\nAt this point the propeller's vibrations slowed down appreciably,\nthen they died out altogether.  Why was the Nautilus stopping?\nWhether this layover would help or hinder Ned Land's schemes I\ncouldn't have said.\n\nThe silence was further disturbed only by the pounding of my heart.\n\nSuddenly I felt a mild jolt.  I realized the Nautilus had come\nto rest on the ocean floor.  My alarm increased.  The Canadian's\nsignal hadn't reached me.  I longed to rejoin Ned Land and urge him\nto postpone his attempt.  I sensed that we were no longer navigating\nunder normal conditions.\n\nJust then the door to the main lounge opened and Captain Nemo appeared.\nHe saw me, and without further preamble:\n\n\"Ah, professor,\" he said in an affable tone, \"I've been looking for you.\nDo you know your Spanish history?\"\n\nEven if he knew it by heart, a man in my disturbed, befuddled condition\ncouldn't have quoted a syllable of his own country's history.\n\n\"Well?\"  Captain Nemo went on.  \"Did you hear my question?\nDo you know the history of Spain?\"\n\n\"Very little of it,\" I replied.\n\n\"The most learned men,\" the captain said, \"still have much to learn.\nHave a seat,\" he added, \"and I'll tell you about an unusual episode\nin this body of history.\"\n\nThe captain stretched out on a couch, and I mechanically took a seat\nnear him, but half in the shadows.\n\n\"Professor,\" he said, \"listen carefully.  This piece of history\nconcerns you in one definite respect, because it will answer\na question you've no doubt been unable to resolve.\"\n\n\"I'm listening, captain,\" I said, not knowing what my partner\nin this dialogue was driving at, and wondering if this incident\nrelated to our escape plans.\n\n\"Professor,\" Captain Nemo went on, \"if you're amenable, we'll go\nback in time to 1702.  You're aware of the fact that in those days\nyour King Louis XIV thought an imperial gesture would suffice\nto humble the Pyrenees in the dust, so he inflicted his grandson,\nthe Duke of Anjou, on the Spaniards.  Reigning more or less\npoorly under the name King Philip V, this aristocrat had to deal\nwith mighty opponents abroad.\n\n\"In essence, the year before, the royal houses of Holland, Austria,\nand England had signed a treaty of alliance at The Hague, aiming to\nwrest the Spanish crown from King Philip V and to place it on the head\nof an archduke whom they prematurely dubbed King Charles III.\n\n\"Spain had to withstand these allies.  But the country had practically no\narmy or navy.  Yet it wasn't short of money, provided that its galleons,\nladen with gold and silver from America, could enter its ports.\nNow then, late in 1702 Spain was expecting a rich convoy,\nwhich France ventured to escort with a fleet of twenty-three vessels\nunder the command of Admiral de Chateau-Renault, because by that time\nthe allied navies were roving the Atlantic.\n\n\"This convoy was supposed to put into Cadiz, but after learning\nthat the English fleet lay across those waterways, the admiral\ndecided to make for a French port.\n\n\"The Spanish commanders in the convoy objected to this decision.\nThey wanted to be taken to a Spanish port, if not to Cadiz,\nthen to the Bay of Vigo, located on Spain's northwest coast\nand not blockaded.\n\n\"Admiral de Chateau-Renault was so indecisive as to obey this directive,\nand the galleons entered the Bay of Vigo.\n\n\"Unfortunately this bay forms an open, offshore mooring that's\nimpossible to defend.  So it was essential to hurry and empty\nthe galleons before the allied fleets arrived, and there would\nhave been ample time for this unloading, if a wretched question\nof trade agreements hadn't suddenly come up.\n\n\"Are you clear on the chain of events?\"  Captain Nemo asked me.\n\n\"Perfectly clear,\" I said, not yet knowing why I was being given\nthis history lesson.\n\n\"Then I'll continue.  Here's what came to pass.  The tradesmen\nof Cadiz had negotiated a charter whereby they were to receive all\nmerchandise coming from the West Indies.  Now then, unloading the\ningots from those galleons at the port of Vigo would have been\na violation of their rights.  So they lodged a complaint in Madrid,\nand they obtained an order from the indecisive King Philip V:\nwithout unloading, the convoy would stay in custody at the offshore\nmooring of Vigo until the enemy fleets had retreated.\n\n\"Now then, just as this decision was being handed down, English vessels\narrived in the Bay of Vigo on October 22, 1702.  Despite his\ninferior forces, Admiral de Chateau-Renault fought courageously.\nBut when he saw that the convoy's wealth was about to fall into\nenemy hands, he burned and scuttled the galleons, which went\nto the bottom with their immense treasures.\"\n\nCaptain Nemo stopped.  I admit it:  I still couldn't see how this\npiece of history concerned me.\n\n\"Well?\"  I asked him.\n\n\"Well, Professor Aronnax,\" Captain Nemo answered me, \"we're actually\nin that Bay of Vigo, and all that's left is for you to probe\nthe mysteries of the place.\"\n\nThe captain stood up and invited me to follow him.  I'd had time\nto collect myself.  I did so.  The lounge was dark, but the sea's\nwaves sparkled through the transparent windows.  I stared.\n\nAround the Nautilus for a half-mile radius, the waters seemed saturated\nwith electric light.  The sandy bottom was clear and bright.\nDressed in diving suits, crewmen were busy clearing away half-rotted\nbarrels and disemboweled trunks in the midst of the dingy hulks of ships.\nOut of these trunks and kegs spilled ingots of gold and silver,\ncascades of jewels, pieces of eight.  The sand was heaped with them.\nThen, laden with these valuable spoils, the men returned to the Nautilus,\ndropped off their burdens inside, and went to resume this inexhaustible\nfishing for silver and gold.\n\nI understood.  This was the setting of that battle on October\n22, 1702.  Here, in this very place, those galleons carrying\ntreasure to the Spanish government had gone to the bottom.\nHere, whenever he needed, Captain Nemo came to withdraw these\nmillions to ballast his Nautilus.  It was for him, for him alone,\nthat America had yielded up its precious metals.  He was the direct,\nsole heir to these treasures wrested from the Incas and those peoples\nconquered by Hernando Cortez!\n\n\"Did you know, professor,\" he asked me with a smile, \"that the sea\ncontained such wealth?\"\n\n\"I know it's estimated,\" I replied, \"that there are 2,000,000 metric\ntons of silver held in suspension in seawater.\"\n\n\"Surely, but in extracting that silver, your expenses would\noutweigh your profits.  Here, by contrast, I have only to pick up\nwhat other men have lost, and not only in this Bay of Vigo but at\na thousand other sites where ships have gone down, whose positions\nare marked on my underwater chart.  Do you understand now that I'm\nrich to the tune of billions?\"\n\n\"I understand, captain.  Nevertheless, allow me to inform you\nthat by harvesting this very Bay of Vigo, you're simply forestalling\nthe efforts of a rival organization.\"\n\n\"What organization?\"\n\n\"A company chartered by the Spanish government to search for these\nsunken galleons.  The company's investors were lured by the bait\nof enormous gains, because this scuttled treasure is estimated\nto be worth 500,000,000 francs.\"\n\n\"It was 500,000,000 francs,\" Captain Nemo replied, \"but no more!\"\n\n\"Right,\" I said.  \"Hence a timely warning to those investors would\nbe an act of charity.  Yet who knows if it would be well received?\nUsually what gamblers regret the most isn't the loss of their money\nso much as the loss of their insane hopes.  But ultimately I feel\nless sorry for them than for the thousands of unfortunate people\nwho would have benefited from a fair distribution of this wealth,\nwhereas now it will be of no help to them!\"\n\nNo sooner had I voiced this regret than I felt it must have\nwounded Captain Nemo.\n\n\"No help!\" he replied with growing animation.  \"Sir, what makes you\nassume this wealth goes to waste when I'm the one amassing it?\nDo you think I toil to gather this treasure out of selfishness?\nWho says I don't put it to good use?  Do you think I'm unaware\nof the suffering beings and oppressed races living on this earth,\npoor people to comfort, victims to avenge?  Don't you understand . . . ?\"\n\nCaptain Nemo stopped on these last words, perhaps sorry that he had said\ntoo much.  But I had guessed.  Whatever motives had driven him to seek\nindependence under the seas, he remained a human being before all else!\nHis heart still throbbed for suffering humanity, and his immense\nphilanthropy went out both to downtrodden races and to individuals!\n\nAnd now I knew where Captain Nemo had delivered those millions,\nwhen the Nautilus navigated the waters where Crete was in rebellion\nagainst the Ottoman Empire!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nA Lost Continent\n\n\nTHE NEXT MORNING, February 19, I beheld the Canadian entering\nmy stateroom.  I was expecting this visit.  He wore an expression\nof great disappointment.\n\n\"Well, sir?\" he said to me.\n\n\"Well, Ned, the fates were against us yesterday.\"\n\n\"Yes!  That damned captain had to call a halt just as we were going\nto escape from his boat.\"\n\n\"Yes, Ned, he had business with his bankers.\"\n\n\"His bankers?\"\n\n\"Or rather his bank vaults.  By which I mean this ocean, where his\nwealth is safer than in any national treasury.\"\n\nI then related the evening's incidents to the Canadian, secretly hoping\nhe would come around to the idea of not deserting the captain;\nbut my narrative had no result other than Ned's voicing deep regret\nthat he hadn't strolled across the Vigo battlefield on his own behalf.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" he said, \"it's not over yet!  My first harpoon missed,\nthat's all!  We'll succeed the next time, and as soon as this evening,\nif need be . . .\"\n\n\"What's the Nautilus's heading?\"  I asked.\n\n\"I've no idea,\" Ned replied.\n\n\"All right, at noon we'll find out what our position is!\"\n\nThe Canadian returned to Conseil's side.  As soon as I was dressed,\nI went into the lounge.  The compass wasn't encouraging.\nThe Nautilus's course was south-southwest. We were turning our\nbacks on Europe.\n\nI could hardly wait until our position was reported on the chart.\nNear 11:30 the ballast tanks emptied, and the submersible rose\nto the surface of the ocean.  I leaped onto the platform.\nNed Land was already there.\n\nNo more shore in sight.  Nothing but the immenseness of the sea.\nA few sails were on the horizon, no doubt ships going as far\nas Cape S\u0103o Roque to find favorable winds for doubling the Cape\nof Good Hope.  The sky was overcast.  A squall was on the way.\n\nFurious, Ned tried to see through the mists on the horizon.\nHe still hoped that behind all that fog there lay those shores\nhe longed for.\n\nAt noon the sun made a momentary appearance.  Taking advantage of this\nrift in the clouds, the chief officer took the orb's altitude.\nThen the sea grew turbulent, we went below again, and the hatch\nclosed once more.\n\nWhen I consulted the chart an hour later, I saw that the Nautilus's\nposition was marked at longitude 16 degrees 17' and latitude\n33 degrees 22', a good 150 leagues from the nearest coast.\nIt wouldn't do to even dream of escaping, and I'll let the reader\ndecide how promptly the Canadian threw a tantrum when I ventured\nto tell him our situation.\n\nAs for me, I wasn't exactly grief-stricken. I felt as if a heavy\nweight had been lifted from me, and I was able to resume my regular\ntasks in a state of comparative calm.\n\nNear eleven o'clock in the evening, I received a most unexpected\nvisit from Captain Nemo.  He asked me very graciously if I felt\nexhausted from our vigil the night before.  I said no.\n\n\"Then, Professor Aronnax, I propose an unusual excursion.\"\n\n\"Propose away, captain.\"\n\n\"So far you've visited the ocean depths only by day and under sunlight.\nWould you like to see these depths on a dark night?\"\n\n\"Very much.\"\n\n\"I warn you, this will be an exhausting stroll.  We'll need to walk\nlong hours and scale a mountain.  The roads aren't terribly\nwell kept up.\"\n\n\"Everything you say, captain, just increases my curiosity.\nI'm ready to go with you.\"\n\n\"Then come along, professor, and we'll go put on our diving suits.\"\n\nArriving at the wardrobe, I saw that neither my companions\nnor any crewmen would be coming with us on this excursion.\nCaptain Nemo hadn't even suggested my fetching Ned or Conseil.\n\nIn a few moments we had put on our equipment.  Air tanks,\nabundantly charged, were placed on our backs, but the electric lamps\nwere not in readiness.  I commented on this to the captain.\n\n\"They'll be useless to us,\" he replied.\n\nI thought I hadn't heard him right, but I couldn't repeat\nmy comment because the captain's head had already disappeared\ninto its metal covering.  I finished harnessing myself, I felt\nan alpenstock being placed in my hand, and a few minutes later,\nafter the usual procedures, we set foot on the floor of the Atlantic,\n300 meters down.\n\nMidnight was approaching.  The waters were profoundly dark,\nbut Captain Nemo pointed to a reddish spot in the distance, a sort\nof wide glow shimmering about two miles from the Nautilus.  What this\nfire was, what substances fed it, how and why it kept burning\nin the liquid mass, I couldn't say.  Anyhow it lit our way,\nalthough hazily, but I soon grew accustomed to this unique gloom,\nand in these circumstances I understood the uselessness of\nthe Ruhmkorff device.\n\nSide by side, Captain Nemo and I walked directly toward this\nconspicuous flame.  The level seafloor rose imperceptibly.\nWe took long strides, helped by our alpenstocks; but in general\nour progress was slow, because our feet kept sinking into a kind\nof slimy mud mixed with seaweed and assorted flat stones.\n\nAs we moved forward, I heard a kind of pitter-patter above my head.\nSometimes this noise increased and became a continuous crackle.\nI soon realized the cause.  It was a heavy rainfall rattling\non the surface of the waves.  Instinctively I worried that I\nmight get soaked!  By water in the midst of water!  I couldn't\nhelp smiling at this outlandish notion.  But to tell the truth,\nwearing these heavy diving suits, you no longer feel the liquid element,\nyou simply think you're in the midst of air a little denser than air\non land, that's all.\n\nAfter half an hour of walking, the seafloor grew rocky.\nJellyfish, microscopic crustaceans, and sea-pen coral lit it faintly\nwith their phosphorescent glimmers.  I glimpsed piles of stones\ncovered by a couple million zoophytes and tangles of algae.\nMy feet often slipped on this viscous seaweed carpet,\nand without my alpenstock I would have fallen more than once.\nWhen I turned around, I could still see the Nautilus's whitish beacon,\nwhich was starting to grow pale in the distance.\n\nThose piles of stones just mentioned were laid out on the ocean floor\nwith a distinct but inexplicable symmetry.  I spotted gigantic furrows\ntrailing off into the distant darkness, their length incalculable.\nThere also were other peculiarities I couldn't make sense of.\nIt seemed to me that my heavy lead soles were crushing a litter\nof bones that made a dry crackling noise.  So what were these vast\nplains we were now crossing?  I wanted to ask the captain, but I still\ndidn't grasp that sign language that allowed him to chat with his\ncompanions when they went with him on his underwater excursions.\n\nMeanwhile the reddish light guiding us had expanded and inflamed\nthe horizon.  The presence of this furnace under the waters had me\nextremely puzzled.  Was it some sort of electrical discharge?\nWas I approaching some natural phenomenon still unknown\nto scientists on shore?  Or, rather (and this thought did\ncross my mind), had the hand of man intervened in that blaze?\nHad human beings fanned those flames?  In these deep strata would\nI meet up with more of Captain Nemo's companions, friends he was\nabout to visit who led lives as strange as his own?  Would I find\na whole colony of exiles down here, men tired of the world's woes,\nmen who had sought and found independence in the ocean's lower depths?\nAll these insane, inadmissible ideas dogged me, and in this frame\nof mind, continually excited by the series of wonders passing\nbefore my eyes, I wouldn't have been surprised to find on this sea\nbottom one of those underwater towns Captain Nemo dreamed about!\n\nOur path was getting brighter and brighter.  The red glow had turned\nwhite and was radiating from a mountain peak about 800 feet high.\nBut what I saw was simply a reflection produced by the crystal\nwaters of these strata.  The furnace that was the source of this\ninexplicable light occupied the far side of the mountain.\n\nIn the midst of the stone mazes furrowing this Atlantic seafloor,\nCaptain Nemo moved forward without hesitation.  He knew this dark path.\nNo doubt he had often traveled it and was incapable of losing his way.\nI followed him with unshakeable confidence.  He seemed like some\nSpirit of the Sea, and as he walked ahead of me, I marveled at his\ntall figure, which stood out in black against the glowing background\nof the horizon.\n\nIt was one o'clock in the morning.  We arrived at the mountain's\nlower gradients.  But in grappling with them, we had to venture up\ndifficult trails through a huge thicket.\n\nYes, a thicket of dead trees!  Trees without leaves, without sap,\nturned to stone by the action of the waters, and crowned here\nand there by gigantic pines.  It was like a still-erect coalfield,\nits roots clutching broken soil, its boughs clearly outlined\nagainst the ceiling of the waters like thin, black, paper cutouts.\nPicture a forest clinging to the sides of a peak in the Harz Mountains,\nbut a submerged forest.  The trails were cluttered with algae\nand fucus plants, hosts of crustaceans swarming among them.\nI plunged on, scaling rocks, straddling fallen tree trunks,\nsnapping marine creepers that swayed from one tree to another,\nstartling the fish that flitted from branch to branch.\nCarried away, I didn't feel exhausted any more.  I followed a guide\nwho was immune to exhaustion.\n\nWhat a sight!  How can I describe it!  How can I portray these\nwoods and rocks in this liquid setting, their lower parts dark\nand sullen, their upper parts tinted red in this light whose\nintensity was doubled by the reflecting power of the waters!\nWe scaled rocks that crumbled behind us, collapsing in enormous\nsections with the hollow rumble of an avalanche.  To our right and left\nthere were carved gloomy galleries where the eye lost its way.\nHuge glades opened up, seemingly cleared by the hand of man,\nand I sometimes wondered whether some residents of these underwater\nregions would suddenly appear before me.\n\nBut Captain Nemo kept climbing.  I didn't want to fall behind.\nI followed him boldly.  My alpenstock was a great help.\nOne wrong step would have been disastrous on the narrow paths cut\ninto the sides of these chasms, but I walked along with a firm\ntread and without the slightest feeling of dizziness.  Sometimes I\nleaped over a crevasse whose depth would have made me recoil had I\nbeen in the midst of glaciers on shore; sometimes I ventured out on\na wobbling tree trunk fallen across a gorge, without looking down,\nhaving eyes only for marveling at the wild scenery of this region.\nThere, leaning on erratically cut foundations, monumental rocks\nseemed to defy the laws of balance.  From between their stony knees,\ntrees sprang up like jets under fearsome pressure, supporting other\ntrees that supported them in turn.  Next, natural towers with wide,\nsteeply carved battlements leaned at angles that, on dry land,\nthe laws of gravity would never have authorized.\n\nAnd I too could feel the difference created by the water's\npowerful density--despite my heavy clothing, copper headpiece,\nand metal soles, I climbed the most impossibly steep gradients with all\nthe nimbleness, I swear it, of a chamois or a Pyrenees mountain goat!\n\nAs for my account of this excursion under the waters, I'm well aware\nthat it sounds incredible!  I'm the chronicler of deeds seemingly\nimpossible and yet incontestably real.  This was no fantasy.\nThis was what I saw and felt!\n\nTwo hours after leaving the Nautilus, we had cleared the timberline,\nand 100 feet above our heads stood the mountain peak, forming a dark\nsilhouette against the brilliant glare that came from its far slope.\nPetrified shrubs rambled here and there in sprawling zigzags.  Fish rose\nin a body at our feet like birds startled in tall grass.  The rocky mass\nwas gouged with impenetrable crevices, deep caves, unfathomable holes\nat whose far ends I could hear fearsome things moving around.\nMy blood would curdle as I watched some enormous antenna bar my path,\nor saw some frightful pincer snap shut in the shadow of some cavity!\nA thousand specks of light glittered in the midst of the gloom.\nThey were the eyes of gigantic crustaceans crouching in their lairs,\ngiant lobsters rearing up like spear carriers and moving their claws\nwith a scrap-iron clanking, titanic crabs aiming their bodies\nlike cannons on their carriages, and hideous devilfish intertwining\ntheir tentacles like bushes of writhing snakes.\n\nWhat was this astounding world that I didn't yet know?\nIn what order did these articulates belong, these creatures\nfor which the rocks provided a second carapace?  Where had nature\nlearned the secret of their vegetating existence, and for how many\ncenturies had they lived in the ocean's lower strata?\n\nBut I couldn't linger.  Captain Nemo, on familiar terms with\nthese dreadful animals, no longer minded them.  We arrived at a\npreliminary plateau where still other surprises were waiting for me.\nThere picturesque ruins took shape, betraying the hand of man,\nnot our Creator.  They were huge stacks of stones in which you\ncould distinguish the indistinct forms of palaces and temples,\nnow arrayed in hosts of blossoming zoophytes, and over it all,\nnot ivy but a heavy mantle of algae and fucus plants.\n\nBut what part of the globe could this be, this land swallowed\nby cataclysms?  Who had set up these rocks and stones like the dolmens\nof prehistoric times?  Where was I, where had Captain Nemo's\nfancies taken me?\n\nI wanted to ask him.  Unable to, I stopped him.  I seized his arm.\nBut he shook his head, pointed to the mountain's topmost peak,\nand seemed to tell me:\n\n\"Come on!  Come with me!  Come higher!\"\n\nI followed him with one last burst of energy, and in a few\nminutes I had scaled the peak, which crowned the whole rocky mass\nby some ten meters.\n\nI looked back down the side we had just cleared.  There the mountain rose\nonly 700 to 800 feet above the plains; but on its far slope it crowned\nthe receding bottom of this part of the Atlantic by a height twice that.\nMy eyes scanned the distance and took in a vast area lit by intense\nflashes of light.  In essence, this mountain was a volcano.\nFifty feet below its peak, amid a shower of stones and slag,\na wide crater vomited torrents of lava that were dispersed in\nfiery cascades into the heart of the liquid mass.  So situated,\nthis volcano was an immense torch that lit up the lower plains\nall the way to the horizon.\n\nAs I said, this underwater crater spewed lava, but not flames.\nFlames need oxygen from the air and are unable to spread underwater;\nbut a lava flow, which contains in itself the principle of its\nincandescence, can rise to a white heat, overpower the liquid element,\nand turn it into steam on contact.  Swift currents swept away all this\ndiffuse gas, and torrents of lava slid to the foot of the mountain,\nlike the disgorgings of a Mt.  Vesuvius over the city limits\nof a second Torre del Greco.\n\nIn fact, there beneath my eyes was a town in ruins, demolished,\noverwhelmed, laid low, its roofs caved in, its temples pulled down,\nits arches dislocated, its columns stretching over the earth;\nin these ruins you could still detect the solid proportions\nof a sort of Tuscan architecture; farther off, the remains of a\ngigantic aqueduct; here, the caked heights of an acropolis along\nwith the fluid forms of a Parthenon; there, the remnants of a wharf,\nas if some bygone port had long ago harbored merchant vessels\nand triple-tiered war galleys on the shores of some lost ocean;\nstill farther off, long rows of collapsing walls, deserted thoroughfares,\na whole Pompeii buried under the waters, which Captain Nemo had\nresurrected before my eyes!\n\nWhere was I?  Where was I?  I had to find out at all cost, I wanted\nto speak, I wanted to rip off the copper sphere imprisoning my head.\n\nBut Captain Nemo came over and stopped me with a gesture.\nThen, picking up a piece of chalky stone, he advanced to a black\nbasaltic rock and scrawled this one word:\n\nATLANTIS\n\nWhat lightning flashed through my mind!  Atlantis, that ancient land\nof Meropis mentioned by the historian Theopompus; Plato's Atlantis;\nthe continent whose very existence has been denied by such philosophers\nand scientists as Origen, Porphyry, Iamblichus, d'Anville, Malte-Brun,\nand Humboldt, who entered its disappearance in the ledger of myths\nand folk tales; the country whose reality has nevertheless been accepted\nby such other thinkers as Posidonius, Pliny, Ammianus Marcellinus,\nTertullian, Engel, Scherer, Tournefort, Buffon, and d'Avezac; I had\nthis land right under my eyes, furnishing its own unimpeachable\nevidence of the catastrophe that had overtaken it!  So this was\nthe submerged region that had existed outside Europe, Asia, and Libya,\nbeyond the Pillars of Hercules, home of those powerful Atlantean\npeople against whom ancient Greece had waged its earliest wars!\n\nThe writer whose narratives record the lofty deeds of those heroic\ntimes is Plato himself.  His dialogues Timaeus and Critias were\ndrafted with the poet and legislator Solon as their inspiration,\nas it were.\n\nOne day Solon was conversing with some elderly wise men in the Egyptian\ncapital of Sais, a town already 8,000 years of age, as documented\nby the annals engraved on the sacred walls of its temples.  One of these\nelders related the history of another town 1,000 years older still.\nThis original city of Athens, ninety centuries old, had been invaded\nand partly destroyed by the Atlanteans.  These Atlanteans, he said,\nresided on an immense continent greater than Africa and\n\nAsia combined, taking in an area that lay between latitude 12 degrees\nand 40 degrees north.  Their dominion extended even to Egypt.  They tried\nto enforce their rule as far as Greece, but they had to retreat before\nthe indomitable resistance of the Hellenic people.  Centuries passed.\nA cataclysm occurred--floods, earthquakes.  A single night and day\nwere enough to obliterate this Atlantis, whose highest peaks\n(Madeira, the Azores, the Canaries, the Cape Verde Islands)\nstill emerge above the waves.\n\nThese were the historical memories that Captain Nemo's scrawl sent\nrushing through my mind.  Thus, led by the strangest of fates,\nI was treading underfoot one of the mountains of that continent!\nMy hands were touching ruins many thousands of years old,\ncontemporary with prehistoric times!  I was walking in the very place\nwhere contemporaries of early man had walked!  My heavy soles\nwere crushing the skeletons of animals from the age of fable,\nanimals that used to take cover in the shade of these trees now\nturned to stone!\n\nOh, why was I so short of time!  I would have gone down the steep\nslopes of this mountain, crossed this entire immense continent,\nwhich surely connects Africa with America, and visited its great\nprehistoric cities.  Under my eyes there perhaps lay the warlike\ntown of Makhimos or the pious village of Eusebes, whose gigantic\ninhabitants lived for whole centuries and had the strength to raise\nblocks of stone that still withstood the action of the waters.\nOne day perhaps, some volcanic phenomenon will bring these sunken\nruins back to the surface of the waves!  Numerous underwater volcanoes\nhave been sighted in this part of the ocean, and many ships have\nfelt terrific tremors when passing over these turbulent depths.\nA few have heard hollow noises that announced some struggle of\nthe elements far below, others have hauled in volcanic ash hurled\nabove the waves.  As far as the equator this whole seafloor is still\nunder construction by plutonic forces.  And in some remote epoch,\nbuilt up by volcanic disgorgings and successive layers of lava,\nwho knows whether the peaks of these fire-belching mountains may\nreappear above the surface of the Atlantic!\n\nAs I mused in this way, trying to establish in my memory every\ndetail of this impressive landscape, Captain Nemo was leaning\nhis elbows on a moss-covered monument, motionless as if petrified\nin some mute trance.  Was he dreaming of those lost generations,\nasking them for the secret of human destiny?  Was it here that this\nstrange man came to revive himself, basking in historical memories,\nreliving that bygone life, he who had no desire for our modern one?\nI would have given anything to know his thoughts, to share them,\nunderstand them!\n\nWe stayed in this place an entire hour, contemplating its vast plains\nin the lava's glow, which sometimes took on a startling intensity.\nInner boilings sent quick shivers running through the mountain's crust.\nNoises from deep underneath, clearly transmitted by the liquid medium,\nreverberated with majestic amplitude.\n\nJust then the moon appeared for an instant through the watery mass,\ncasting a few pale rays over this submerged continent.\nIt was only a fleeting glimmer, but its effect was indescribable.\nThe captain stood up and took one last look at these immense plains;\nthen his hand signaled me to follow him.\n\nWe went swiftly down the mountain.  Once past the petrified forest,\nI could see the Nautilus's beacon twinkling like a star.\nThe captain walked straight toward it, and we were back on board\njust as the first glimmers of dawn were whitening the surface\nof the ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nThe Underwater Coalfields\n\n\nTHE NEXT DAY, February 20, I overslept.  I was so exhausted\nfrom the night before, I didn't get up until eleven o'clock. I\ndressed quickly.  I hurried to find out the Nautilus's heading.\nThe instruments indicated that it was running southward at a speed\nof twenty miles per hour and a depth of 100 meters.\n\nConseil entered.  I described our nocturnal excursion to him,\nand since the panels were open, he could still catch a glimpse\nof this submerged continent.\n\nIn fact, the Nautilus was skimming only ten meters over the soil of\nthese Atlantis plains.  The ship scudded along like an air balloon borne\nby the wind over some prairie on land; but it would be more accurate\nto say that we sat in the lounge as if we were riding in a coach\non an express train.  As for the foregrounds passing before our eyes,\nthey were fantastically carved rocks, forests of trees that had\ncrossed over from the vegetable kingdom into the mineral kingdom,\ntheir motionless silhouettes sprawling beneath the waves.\nThere also were stony masses buried beneath carpets of axidia\nand sea anemone, bristling with long, vertical water plants,\nthen strangely contoured blocks of lava that testified to all the fury\nof those plutonic developments.\n\nWhile this bizarre scenery was glittering under our electric beams,\nI told Conseil the story of the Atlanteans, who had inspired\nthe old French scientist Jean Bailly to write so many entertaining--\nalbeit utterly fictitious--pages.* I told the lad about the wars\nof these heroic people.  I discussed the question of Atlantis\nwith the fervor of a man who no longer had any doubts.  But Conseil\nwas so distracted he barely heard me, and his lack of interest\nin any commentary on this historical topic was soon explained.\n\n*Bailly believed that Atlantis was located at the North Pole!  Ed.\n\nIn essence, numerous fish had caught his eye, and when fish pass by,\nConseil vanishes into his world of classifying and leaves real\nlife behind.  In which case I could only tag along and resume\nour ichthyological research.\n\nEven so, these Atlantic fish were not noticeably different from those we\nhad observed earlier.  There were rays of gigantic size, five meters\nlong and with muscles so powerful they could leap above the waves,\nsharks of various species including a fifteen-foot glaucous shark\nwith sharp triangular teeth and so transparent it was almost invisible\namid the waters, brown lantern sharks, prism-shaped humantin sharks\narmored with protuberant hides, sturgeons resembling their relatives\nin the Mediterranean, trumpet-snouted pipefish a foot and a half long,\nyellowish brown with small gray fins and no teeth or tongue,\nunreeling like slim, supple snakes.\n\nAmong bony fish, Conseil noticed some blackish marlin three\nmeters long with a sharp sword jutting from the upper jaw,\nbright-colored weevers known in Aristotle's day as sea dragons\nand whose dorsal stingers make them quite dangerous to pick up,\nthen dolphinfish with brown backs striped in blue and edged in gold,\nhandsome dorados, moonlike opahs that look like azure disks but which\nthe sun's rays turn into spots of silver, finally eight-meter swordfish\nfrom the genus Xiphias, swimming in schools, sporting yellowish\nsickle-shaped fins and six-foot broadswords, stalwart animals,\nplant eaters rather than fish eaters, obeying the tiniest signals\nfrom their females like henpecked husbands.\n\nBut while observing these different specimens of marine fauna,\nI didn't stop examining the long plains of Atlantis.  Sometimes an\nunpredictable irregularity in the seafloor would force the Nautilus\nto slow down, and then it would glide into the narrow channels\nbetween the hills with a cetacean's dexterity.  If the labyrinth\nbecame hopelessly tangled, the submersible would rise above it\nlike an airship, and after clearing the obstacle, it would resume\nits speedy course just a few meters above the ocean floor.\nIt was an enjoyable and impressive way of navigating that did indeed\nrecall the maneuvers of an airship ride, with the major difference\nthat the Nautilus faithfully obeyed the hands of its helmsman.\n\nThe terrain consisted mostly of thick slime mixed with petrified branches,\nbut it changed little by little near four o'clock in the afternoon;\nit grew rockier and seemed to be strewn with pudding stones and a basaltic\ngravel called \"tuff,\" together with bits of lava and sulfurous obsidian.\nI expected these long plains to change into mountain regions,\nand in fact, as the Nautilus was executing certain turns,\nI noticed that the southerly horizon was blocked by a high wall\nthat seemed to close off every exit.  Its summit obviously\npoked above the level of the ocean.  It had to be a continent\nor at least an island, either one of the Canaries or one of the\nCape Verde Islands.  Our bearings hadn't been marked on the chart--\nperhaps deliberately--and I had no idea what our position was.\nIn any case this wall seemed to signal the end of Atlantis, of which,\nall in all, we had crossed only a small part.\n\nNightfall didn't interrupt my observations.  I was left to myself.\nConseil had repaired to his cabin.  The Nautilus slowed down,\nhovering above the muddled masses on the seafloor, sometimes grazing\nthem as if wanting to come to rest, sometimes rising unpredictably\nto the surface of the waves.  Then I glimpsed a few bright\nconstellations through the crystal waters, specifically five or six\nof those zodiacal stars trailing from the tail end of Orion.\n\nI would have stayed longer at my window, marveling at these beauties\nof sea and sky, but the panels closed.  Just then the Nautilus had\narrived at the perpendicular face of that high wall.  How the ship\nwould maneuver I hadn't a guess.  I repaired to my stateroom.\nThe Nautilus did not stir.  I fell asleep with the firm intention\nof waking up in just a few hours.\n\nBut it was eight o'clock the next day when I returned to the lounge.\nI stared at the pressure gauge.  It told me that the Nautilus was\nafloat on the surface of the ocean.  Furthermore, I heard the sound\nof footsteps on the platform.  Yet there were no rolling movements\nto indicate the presence of waves undulating above me.\n\nI climbed as far as the hatch.  It was open.  But instead of\nthe broad daylight I was expecting, I found that I was surrounded\nby total darkness.  Where were we?  Had I been mistaken?\nWas it still night?  No!  Not one star was twinkling, and nighttime\nis never so utterly black.\n\nI wasn't sure what to think, when a voice said to me:\n\n\"Is that you, professor?\"\n\n\"Ah, Captain Nemo!\"  I replied.  \"Where are we?\"\n\n\"Underground, professor.\"\n\n\"Underground!\"  I exclaimed.  \"And the Nautilus is still floating?\"\n\n\"It always floats.\"\n\n\"But I don't understand!\"\n\n\"Wait a little while.  Our beacon is about to go on, and if you\nwant some light on the subject, you'll be satisfied.\"\n\nI set foot on the platform and waited.  The darkness was so profound\nI couldn't see even Captain Nemo.  However, looking at the zenith\ndirectly overhead, I thought I caught sight of a feeble glimmer,\na sort of twilight filtering through a circular hole.\nJust then the beacon suddenly went on, and its intense brightness\nmade that hazy light vanish.\n\nThis stream of electricity dazzled my eyes, and after momentarily\nshutting them, I looked around.  The Nautilus was stationary.\nIt was floating next to an embankment shaped like a wharf.\nAs for the water now buoying the ship, it was a lake completely encircled\nby an inner wall about two miles in diameter, hence six miles around.\nIts level--as indicated by the pressure gauge--would be the same\nas the outside level, because some connection had to exist\nbetween this lake and the sea.  Slanting inward over their base,\nthese high walls converged to form a vault shaped like an immense\nupside-down funnel that measured 500 or 600 meters in height.\nAt its summit there gaped the circular opening through which I\nhad detected that faint glimmer, obviously daylight.\n\nBefore more carefully examining the interior features of this\nenormous cavern, and before deciding if it was the work of nature\nor humankind, I went over to Captain Nemo.\n\n\"Where are we?\"  I said.\n\n\"In the very heart of an extinct volcano,\" the captain answered me,\n\"a volcano whose interior was invaded by the sea after some convulsion\nin the earth.  While you were sleeping, professor, the Nautilus\nentered this lagoon through a natural channel that opens ten meters\nbelow the surface of the ocean.  This is our home port, secure,\nconvenient, secret, and sheltered against winds from any direction!\nAlong the coasts of your continents or islands, show me any\noffshore mooring that can equal this safe refuge for withstanding\nthe fury of hurricanes.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" I replied, \"here you're in perfect safety,\nCaptain Nemo.  Who could reach you in the heart of a volcano?\nBut don't I see an opening at its summit?\"\n\n\"Yes, its crater, a crater formerly filled with lava, steam, and flames,\nbut which now lets in this life-giving air we're breathing.\"\n\n\"But which volcanic mountain is this?\"  I asked.\n\n\"It's one of the many islets with which this sea is strewn.\nFor ships a mere reef, for us an immense cavern.  I discovered it\nby chance, and chance served me well.\"\n\n\"But couldn't someone enter through the mouth of its crater?\"\n\n\"No more than I could exit through it.  You can climb about 100 feet\nup the inner base of this mountain, but then the walls overhang,\nthey lean too far in to be scaled.\"\n\n\"I can see, captain, that nature is your obedient servant,\nany time or any place.  You're safe on this lake, and nobody else\ncan visit its waters.  But what's the purpose of this refuge?\nThe Nautilus doesn't need a harbor.\"\n\n\"No, professor, but it needs electricity to run, batteries to\ngenerate its electricity, sodium to feed its batteries, coal to\nmake its sodium, and coalfields from which to dig its coal.\nNow then, right at this spot the sea covers entire forests that\nsank underwater in prehistoric times; today, turned to stone,\ntransformed into carbon fuel, they offer me inexhaustible coal mines.\"\n\n\"So, captain, your men practice the trade of miners here?\"\n\n\"Precisely.  These mines extend under the waves like the coalfields\nat Newcastle.  Here, dressed in diving suits, pick and mattock in hand,\nmy men go out and dig this carbon fuel for which I don't need a single\nmine on land.  When I burn this combustible to produce sodium,\nthe smoke escaping from the mountain's crater gives it the appearance\nof a still-active volcano.\"\n\n\"And will we see your companions at work?\"\n\n\"No, at least not this time, because I'm eager to continue our\nunderwater tour of the world.  Accordingly, I'll rest content\nwith drawing on my reserve stock of sodium.  We'll stay here long\nenough to load it on board, in other words, a single workday,\nthen we'll resume our voyage.  So, Professor Aronnax, if you'd\nlike to explore this cavern and circle its lagoon, seize the day.\"\n\nI thanked the captain and went to look for my two companions,\nwho hadn't yet left their cabin.  I invited them to follow me,\nnot telling them where we were.\n\nThey climbed onto the platform.  Conseil, whom nothing could startle,\nsaw it as a perfectly natural thing to fall asleep under the waves\nand wake up under a mountain.  But Ned Land had no idea in his head\nother than to see if this cavern offered some way out.\n\nAfter breakfast near ten o'clock, we went down onto the embankment.\n\n\"So here we are, back on shore,\" Conseil said.\n\n\"I'd hardly call this shore,\" the Canadian replied.  \"And besides,\nwe aren't on it but under it.\"\n\nA sandy beach unfolded before us, measuring 500 feet at its widest point\nbetween the waters of the lake and the foot of the mountain's walls.\nVia this strand you could easily circle the lake.  But the base\nof these high walls consisted of broken soil over which there lay\npicturesque piles of volcanic blocks and enormous pumice stones.\nAll these crumbling masses were covered with an enamel polished by\nthe action of underground fires, and they glistened under the stream\nof electric light from our beacon.  Stirred up by our footsteps,\nthe mica-rich dust on this beach flew into the air like a\ncloud of sparks.\n\nThe ground rose appreciably as it moved away from the sand flats\nby the waves, and we soon arrived at some long, winding gradients,\ngenuinely steep paths that allowed us to climb little by little;\nbut we had to tread cautiously in the midst of pudding stones that weren't\ncemented together, and our feet kept skidding on glassy trachyte,\nmade of feldspar and quartz crystals.\n\nThe volcanic nature of this enormous pit was apparent all around us.\nI ventured to comment on it to my companions.\n\n\"Can you picture,\" I asked them, \"what this funnel must have\nbeen like when it was filled with boiling lava, and the level\nof that incandescent liquid rose right to the mountain's mouth,\nlike cast iron up the insides of a furnace?\"\n\n\"I can picture it perfectly,\" Conseil replied.  \"But will master\ntell me why this huge smelter suspended operations, and how it\nis that an oven was replaced by the tranquil waters of a lake?\"\n\n\"In all likelihood, Conseil, because some convulsion created an opening\nbelow the surface of the ocean, the opening that serves as a passageway\nfor the Nautilus.  Then the waters of the Atlantic rushed inside\nthe mountain.  There ensued a dreadful struggle between the elements\nof fire and water, a struggle ending in King Neptune's favor.\nBut many centuries have passed since then, and this submerged\nvolcano has changed into a peaceful cavern.\"\n\n\"That's fine,\" Ned Land answered.  \"I accept the explanation,\nbut in our personal interests, I'm sorry this opening the professor\nmentions wasn't made above sea level.\"\n\n\"But Ned my friend,\" Conseil answered, \"if it weren't an underwater\npassageway, the Nautilus couldn't enter it!\"\n\n\"And I might add, Mr. Land,\" I said, \"that the waters wouldn't have\nrushed under the mountain, and the volcano would still be a volcano.\nSo you have nothing to be sorry about.\"\n\nOur climb continued.  The gradients got steeper and narrower.\nSometimes they were cut across by deep pits that had to be cleared.\nMasses of overhanging rock had to be gotten around.  You slid on\nyour knees, you crept on your belly.  But helped by the Canadian's\nstrength and Conseil's dexterity, we overcame every obstacle.\n\nAt an elevation of about thirty meters, the nature of the terrain\nchanged without becoming any easier.  Pudding stones and trachyte\ngave way to black basaltic rock:  here, lying in slabs all swollen\nwith blisters; there, shaped like actual prisms and arranged into a\nseries of columns that supported the springings of this immense vault,\na wonderful sample of natural architecture.  Then, among this\nbasaltic rock, there snaked long, hardened lava flows inlaid with veins\nof bituminous coal and in places covered by wide carpets of sulfur.\nThe sunshine coming through the crater had grown stronger,\nshedding a hazy light over all the volcanic waste forever buried\nin the heart of this extinct mountain.\n\nBut when we had ascended to an elevation of about 250 feet,\nwe were stopped by insurmountable obstacles.  The converging inside\nwalls changed into overhangs, and our climb into a circular stroll.\nAt this topmost level the vegetable kingdom began to challenge\nthe mineral kingdom.  Shrubs, and even a few trees, emerged from crevices\nin the walls.  I recognized some spurges that let their caustic,\npurgative sap trickle out.  There were heliotropes, very remiss\nat living up to their sun-worshipping reputations since no sunlight\never reached them; their clusters of flowers drooped sadly,\ntheir colors and scents were faded.  Here and there chrysanthemums\nsprouted timidly at the feet of aloes with long, sad, sickly leaves.\nBut between these lava flows I spotted little violets that still gave\noff a subtle fragrance, and I confess that I inhaled it with delight.\nThe soul of a flower is its scent, and those splendid water plants,\nflowers of the sea, have no souls!\n\nWe had arrived at the foot of a sturdy clump of dragon trees,\nwhich were splitting the rocks with exertions of their muscular roots,\nwhen Ned Land exclaimed:\n\n\"Oh, sir, a hive!\"\n\n\"A hive?\"  I answered, with a gesture of utter disbelief.\n\n\"Yes, a hive,\" the Canadian repeated, \"with bees buzzing around!\"\n\nI went closer and was forced to recognize the obvious.  At the mouth\nof a hole cut in the trunk of a dragon tree, there swarmed thousands\nof these ingenious insects so common to all the Canary Islands,\nwhere their output is especially prized.\n\nNaturally enough, the Canadian wanted to lay in a supply of honey,\nand it would have been ill-mannered of me to say no.  He mixed sulfur\nwith some dry leaves, set them on fire with a spark from his tinderbox,\nand proceeded to smoke the bees out.  Little by little the buzzing died\ndown and the disemboweled hive yielded several pounds of sweet honey.\nNed Land stuffed his haversack with it.\n\n\"When I've mixed this honey with our breadfruit batter,\" he told us,\n\"I'll be ready to serve you a delectable piece of cake.\"\n\n\"But of course,\" Conseil put in, \"it will be gingerbread!\"\n\n\"I'm all for gingerbread,\" I said, \"but let's resume\nthis fascinating stroll.\"\n\nAt certain turns in the trail we were going along, the lake\nappeared in its full expanse.  The ship's beacon lit up that whole\nplacid surface, which experienced neither ripples nor undulations.\nThe Nautilus lay perfectly still.  On its platform and on the embankment,\ncrewmen were bustling around, black shadows that stood out clearly\nin the midst of the luminous air.\n\nJust then we went around the highest ridge of these rocky\nfoothills that supported the vault.  Then I saw that bees weren't\nthe animal kingdom's only representatives inside this volcano.\nHere and in the shadows, birds of prey soared and whirled,\nflying away from nests perched on tips of rock.  There were\nsparrow hawks with white bellies, and screeching kestrels.\nWith all the speed their stiltlike legs could muster, fine fat bustards\nscampered over the slopes.  I'll let the reader decide whether\nthe Canadian's appetite was aroused by the sight of this tasty game,\nand whether he regretted having no rifle in his hands.  He tried\nto make stones do the work of bullets, and after several fruitless\nattempts, he managed to wound one of these magnificent bustards.\nTo say he risked his life twenty times in order to capture this\nbird is simply the unadulterated truth; but he fared so well,\nthe animal went into his sack to join the honeycombs.\n\nBy then we were forced to go back down to the beach because the ridge\nhad become impossible.  Above us, the yawning crater looked like\nthe wide mouth of a well.  From where we stood, the sky was pretty easy\nto see, and I watched clouds race by, disheveled by the west wind,\nletting tatters of mist trail over the mountain's summit.\nProof positive that those clouds kept at a moderate altitude,\nbecause this volcano didn't rise more than 1,800 feet above the level\nof the ocean.\n\nHalf an hour after the Canadian's latest exploits, we were back\non the inner beach.  There the local flora was represented by a wide\ncarpet of samphire, a small umbelliferous plant that keeps quite nicely,\nwhich also boasts the names glasswort, saxifrage, and sea fennel.\nConseil picked a couple bunches.  As for the local fauna,\nit included thousands of crustaceans of every type:\nlobsters, hermit crabs, prawns, mysid shrimps, daddy longlegs,\nrock crabs, and a prodigious number of seashells, such as cowries,\nmurex snails, and limpets.\n\nIn this locality there gaped the mouth of a magnificent cave.\nMy companions and I took great pleasure in stretching out on its\nfine-grained sand.  Fire had polished the sparkling enamel of its\ninner walls, sprinkled all over with mica-rich dust.  Ned Land tapped\nthese walls and tried to probe their thickness.  I couldn't help smiling.\nOur conversation then turned to his everlasting escape plans,\nand without going too far, I felt I could offer him this hope:\nCaptain Nemo had gone down south only to replenish his sodium supplies.\nSo I hoped he would now hug the coasts of Europe and America,\nwhich would allow the Canadian to try again with a greater\nchance of success.\n\nWe were stretched out in this delightful cave for an hour.\nOur conversation, lively at the outset, then languished.\nA definite drowsiness overcame us.  Since I saw no good reason\nto resist the call of sleep, I fell into a heavy doze.\nI dreamed--one doesn't choose his dreams--that my life had been\nreduced to the vegetating existence of a simple mollusk.\nIt seemed to me that this cave made up my double-valved shell. . . .\n\nSuddenly Conseil's voice startled me awake.\n\n\"Get up!  Get up!\" shouted the fine lad.\n\n\"What is it?\"  I asked, in a sitting position.\n\n\"The water's coming up to us!\"\n\nI got back on my feet.  Like a torrent the sea was rushing\ninto our retreat, and since we definitely were not mollusks,\nwe had to clear out.\n\nIn a few seconds we were safe on top of the cave.\n\n\"What happened?\"  Conseil asked.  \"Some new phenomenon?\"\n\n\"Not quite, my friends!\"  I replied.  \"It was the tide,\nmerely the tide, which wellnigh caught us by surprise just as it\ndid Sir Walter Scott's hero!  The ocean outside is rising,\nand by a perfectly natural law of balance, the level of this\nlake is also rising.  We've gotten off with a mild dunking.\nLet's go change clothes on the Nautilus.\"\n\nThree-quarters of an hour later, we had completed our circular stroll\nand were back on board.  Just then the crewmen finished loading\nthe sodium supplies, and the Nautilus could have departed immediately.\n\nBut Captain Nemo gave no orders.  Would he wait for nightfall\nand exit through his underwater passageway in secrecy?  Perhaps.\n\nBe that as it may, by the next day the Nautilus had left its home\nport and was navigating well out from any shore, a few meters\nbeneath the waves of the Atlantic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nThe Sargasso Sea\n\n\nTHE NAUTILUS didn't change direction.  For the time being, then,\nwe had to set aside any hope of returning to European seas.\nCaptain Nemo kept his prow pointing south.  Where was he taking us?\nI was afraid to guess.\n\nThat day the Nautilus crossed an odd part of the Atlantic Ocean.  No one\nis unaware of the existence of that great warm-water current known\nby name as the Gulf Stream.  After emerging from channels off Florida,\nit heads toward Spitzbergen.  But before entering the Gulf of Mexico\nnear latitude 44 degrees north, this current divides into two arms;\nits chief arm makes for the shores of Ireland and Norway\nwhile the second flexes southward at the level of the Azores;\nthen it hits the coast of Africa, sweeps in a long oval, and returns\nto the Caribbean Sea.\n\nNow then, this second arm--more accurately, a collar--forms a ring\nof warm water around a section of cool, tranquil, motionless ocean\ncalled the Sargasso Sea.  This is an actual lake in the open Atlantic,\nand the great current's waters take at least three years to circle it.\n\nProperly speaking, the Sargasso Sea covers every submerged part\nof Atlantis.  Certain authors have even held that the many weeds\nstrewn over this sea were torn loose from the prairies of that\nancient continent.  But it's more likely that these grasses, algae,\nand fucus plants were carried off from the beaches of Europe and America,\nthen taken as far as this zone by the Gulf Stream.  This is one\nof the reasons why Christopher Columbus assumed the existence\nof a New World.  When the ships of that bold investigator arrived\nin the Sargasso Sea, they had great difficulty navigating in the midst\nof these weeds, which, much to their crews' dismay, slowed them down\nto a halt; and they wasted three long weeks crossing this sector.\n\nSuch was the region our Nautilus was visiting just then:\na genuine prairie, a tightly woven carpet of algae, gulfweed,\nand bladder wrack so dense and compact a craft's stempost couldn't\ntear through it without difficulty.  Accordingly, not wanting\nto entangle his propeller in this weed-choked mass, Captain Nemo\nstayed at a depth some meters below the surface of the waves.\n\nThe name Sargasso comes from the Spanish word \"sargazo,\"\nmeaning gulfweed.  This gulfweed, the swimming gulfweed or\nberry carrier, is the chief substance making up this immense shoal.\nAnd here's why these water plants collect in this placid Atlantic basin,\naccording to the expert on the subject, Commander Maury, author of\nThe Physical Geography of the Sea.\n\nThe explanation he gives seems to entail a set of conditions that\neverybody knows:  \"Now,\" Maury says, \"if bits of cork or chaff,\nor any floating substance, be put into a basin, and a circular motion\nbe given to the water, all the light substances will be found crowding\ntogether near the center of the pool, where there is the least motion.\nJust such a basin is the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf Stream,\nand the Sargasso Sea is the center of the whirl.\"\n\nI share Maury's view, and I was able to study the phenomenon in this\nexclusive setting where ships rarely go.  Above us, huddled among\nthe brown weeds, there floated objects originating from all over:\ntree trunks ripped from the Rocky Mountains or the Andes and sent\nfloating down the Amazon or the Mississippi, numerous pieces\nof wreckage, remnants of keels or undersides, bulwarks staved\nin and so weighed down with seashells and barnacles, they couldn't\nrise to the surface of the ocean.  And the passing years will someday\nbear out Maury's other view that by collecting in this way over\nthe centuries, these substances will be turned to stone by the action\nof the waters and will then form inexhaustible coalfields.\nValuable reserves prepared by farseeing nature for that time when man\nwill have exhausted his mines on the continents.\n\nIn the midst of this hopelessly tangled fabric of weeds and fucus plants,\nI noted some delightful pink-colored, star-shaped alcyon coral,\nsea anemone trailing the long tresses of their tentacles,\nsome green, red, and blue jellyfish, and especially those big\nrhizostome jellyfish that Cuvier described, whose bluish parasols\nare trimmed with violet festoons.\n\nWe spent the whole day of February 22 in the Sargasso Sea, where fish\nthat dote on marine plants and crustaceans find plenty to eat.\nThe next day the ocean resumed its usual appearance.\n\nFrom this moment on, for nineteen days from February 23 to March 12,\nthe Nautilus stayed in the middle of the Atlantic, hustling us\nalong at a constant speed of 100 leagues every twenty-four hours.\nIt was obvious that Captain Nemo wanted to carry out his underwater\nprogram, and I had no doubt that he intended, after doubling Cape Horn,\nto return to the Pacific South Seas.\n\nSo Ned Land had good reason to worry.  In these wide seas empty\nof islands, it was no longer feasible to jump ship.  Nor did we\nhave any way to counter Captain Nemo's whims.  We had no choice\nbut to acquiesce; but if we couldn't attain our end through force\nor cunning, I liked to think we might achieve it through persuasion.\nOnce this voyage was over, might not Captain Nemo consent to set\nus free in return for our promise never to reveal his existence?\nOur word of honor, which we sincerely would have kept.\nHowever, this delicate question would have to be negotiated with\nthe captain.  But how would he receive our demands for freedom?\nAt the very outset and in no uncertain terms, hadn't he declared\nthat the secret of his life required that we be permanently imprisoned\non board the Nautilus?  Wouldn't he see my four-month silence\nas a tacit acceptance of this situation?  Would my returning to this\nsubject arouse suspicions that could jeopardize our escape plans,\nif we had promising circumstances for trying again later on?\nI weighed all these considerations, turned them over in my mind,\nsubmitted them to Conseil, but he was as baffled as I was.\nIn short, although I'm not easily discouraged, I realized that my\nchances of ever seeing my fellow men again were shrinking by the day,\nespecially at a time when Captain Nemo was recklessly racing toward\nthe south Atlantic!\n\nDuring those nineteen days just mentioned, no unique incidents\ndistinguished our voyage.  I saw little of the captain.\nHe was at work.  In the library I often found books he had left open,\nespecially books on natural history.  He had thumbed through my work\non the great ocean depths, and the margins were covered with his notes,\nwhich sometimes contradicted my theories and formulations.\nBut the captain remained content with this method of refining my work,\nand he rarely discussed it with me.  Sometimes I heard melancholy\nsounds reverberating from the organ, which he played very expressively,\nbut only at night in the midst of the most secretive darkness,\nwhile the Nautilus slumbered in the wilderness of the ocean.\n\nDuring this part of our voyage, we navigated on the surface of the waves\nfor entire days.  The sea was nearly deserted.  A few sailing ships,\nladen for the East Indies, were heading toward the Cape of\nGood Hope.  One day we were chased by the longboats of a whaling vessel,\nwhich undoubtedly viewed us as some enormous baleen whale of great value.\nBut Captain Nemo didn't want these gallant gentlemen wasting their\ntime and energy, so he ended the hunt by diving beneath the waters.\nThis incident seemed to fascinate Ned Land intensely.\nI'm sure the Canadian was sorry that these fishermen couldn't\nharpoon our sheet-iron cetacean and mortally wound it.\n\nDuring this period the fish Conseil and I observed differed little\nfrom those we had already studied in other latitudes.  Chief among\nthem were specimens of that dreadful cartilaginous genus that's\ndivided into three subgenera numbering at least thirty-two species:\nstriped sharks five meters long, the head squat and wider than\nthe body, the caudal fin curved, the back with seven big, black,\nparallel lines running lengthwise; then perlon sharks, ash gray,\npierced with seven gill openings, furnished with a single dorsal\nfin placed almost exactly in the middle of the body.\n\nSome big dogfish also passed by, a voracious species of shark if there\never was one.  With some justice, fishermen's yarns aren't to be trusted,\nbut here's what a few of them relate.  Inside the corpse of one\nof these animals there were found a buffalo head and a whole calf;\nin another, two tuna and a sailor in uniform; in yet another,\na soldier with his saber; in another, finally, a horse with its rider.\nIn candor, none of these sounds like divinely inspired truth.\nBut the fact remains that not a single dogfish let itself get caught\nin the Nautilus's nets, so I can't vouch for their voracity.\n\nSchools of elegant, playful dolphin swam alongside for entire days.\nThey went in groups of five or six, hunting in packs like wolves\nover the countryside; moreover, they're just as voracious as dogfish,\nif I can believe a certain Copenhagen professor who says that from one\ndolphin's stomach, he removed thirteen porpoises and fifteen seals.\nTrue, it was a killer whale, belonging to the biggest known species,\nwhose length sometimes exceeds twenty-four feet.  The family\nDelphinia numbers ten genera, and the dolphins I saw were akin\nto the genus Delphinorhynchus, remarkable for an extremely narrow\nmuzzle four times as long as the cranium.  Measuring three meters,\ntheir bodies were black on top, underneath a pinkish white strewn\nwith small, very scattered spots.\n\nFrom these seas I'll also mention some unusual specimens of croakers,\nfish from the order Acanthopterygia, family Scienidea.  Some authors--\nmore artistic than scientific--claim that these fish are\nmelodious singers, that their voices in unison put on concerts\nunmatched by human choristers.  I don't say nay, but to my regret\nthese croakers didn't serenade us as we passed.\n\nFinally, to conclude, Conseil classified a large number\nof flying fish.  Nothing could have made a more unusual sight\nthan the marvelous timing with which dolphins hunt these fish.\nWhatever the range of its flight, however evasive its trajectory\n(even up and over the Nautilus), the hapless flying fish always found\na dolphin to welcome it with open mouth.  These were either flying\ngurnards or kitelike sea robins, whose lips glowed in the dark,\nat night scrawling fiery streaks in the air before plunging into\nthe murky waters like so many shooting stars.\n\nOur navigating continued under these conditions until March 13.\nThat day the Nautilus was put to work in some depth-sounding\nexperiments that fascinated me deeply.\n\nBy then we had fared nearly 13,000 leagues from our starting point\nin the Pacific high seas.  Our position fix placed us in latitude\n45 degrees 37' south and longitude 37 degrees 53' west.  These were\nthe same waterways where Captain Denham, aboard the Herald,\npayed out 14,000 meters of sounding line without finding bottom.\nIt was here too that Lieutenant Parker, aboard the American\nfrigate Congress, was unable to reach the underwater soil\nat 15,149 meters.\n\nCaptain Nemo decided to take his Nautilus down to the lowest\ndepths in order to double-check these different soundings.\nI got ready to record the results of this experiment.\nThe panels in the lounge opened, and maneuvers began for reaching\nthose strata so prodigiously far removed.\n\nIt was apparently considered out of the question to dive by filling\nthe ballast tanks.  Perhaps they wouldn't sufficiently increase\nthe Nautilus's specific gravity.  Moreover, in order to come back up,\nit would be necessary to expel the excess water, and our pumps\nmight not have been strong enough to overcome the outside pressure.\n\nCaptain Nemo decided to make for the ocean floor by submerging on\nan appropriately gradual diagonal with the help of his side fins,\nwhich were set at a 45 degrees angle to the Nautilus's waterline.\nThen the propeller was brought to its maximum speed, and its four\nblades churned the waves with indescribable violence.\n\nUnder this powerful thrust the Nautilus's hull quivered like a\nresonating chord, and the ship sank steadily under the waters.\nStationed in the lounge, the captain and I watched the needle\nswerving swiftly over the pressure gauge.  Soon we had gone below\nthe livable zone where most fish reside.  Some of these animals\ncan thrive only at the surface of seas or rivers, but a minority\ncan dwell at fairly great depths.  Among the latter I observed\na species of dogfish called the cow shark that's equipped with six\nrespiratory slits, the telescope fish with its enormous eyes,\nthe armored gurnard with gray thoracic fins plus black pectoral\nfins and a breastplate protected by pale red slabs of bone,\nthen finally the grenadier, living at a depth of 1,200 meters,\nby that point tolerating a pressure of 120 atmospheres.\n\nI asked Captain Nemo if he had observed any fish at\nmore considerable depths.\n\n\"Fish?  Rarely!\" he answered me.  \"But given the current state\nof marine science, who are we to presume, what do we really know\nof these depths?\"\n\n\"Just this, captain.  In going toward the ocean's lower strata,\nwe know that vegetable life disappears more quickly than animal life.\nWe know that moving creatures can still be encountered where water\nplants no longer grow.  We know that oysters and pilgrim scallops live\nin 2,000 meters of water, and that Admiral McClintock, England's hero of\nthe polar seas, pulled in a live sea star from a depth of 2,500 meters.\nWe know that the crew of the Royal Navy's Bulldog fished up a starfish\nfrom 2,620 fathoms, hence from a depth of more than one vertical league.\nWould you still say, Captain Nemo, that we really know nothing?\"\n\n\"No, professor,\" the captain replied, \"I wouldn't be so discourteous.\nYet I'll ask you to explain how these creatures can live at such depths?\"\n\n\"I explain it on two grounds,\" I replied.  \"In the first place,\nbecause vertical currents, which are caused by differences in the\nwater's salinity and density, can produce enough motion to sustain\nthe rudimentary lifestyles of sea lilies and starfish.\"\n\n\"True,\" the captain put in.\n\n\"In the second place, because oxygen is the basis of life, and we\nknow that the amount of oxygen dissolved in salt water increases\nrather than decreases with depth, that the pressure in these lower\nstrata helps to concentrate their oxygen content.\"\n\n\"Oho!  We know that, do we?\"  Captain Nemo replied in a tone\nof mild surprise.  \"Well, professor, we have good reason to know\nit because it's the truth.  I might add, in fact, that the air\nbladders of fish contain more nitrogen than oxygen when these animals\nare caught at the surface of the water, and conversely, more oxygen\nthan nitrogen when they're pulled up from the lower depths.\nWhich bears out your formulation.  But let's continue our observations.\"\n\nMy eyes flew back to the pressure gauge.  The instrument indicated\na depth of 6,000 meters.  Our submergence had been going on for an hour.\nThe Nautilus slid downward on its slanting fins, still sinking.\nThese deserted waters were wonderfully clear, with a transparency\nimpossible to convey.  An hour later we were at 13,000 meters--\nabout three and a quarter vertical leagues--and the ocean floor\nwas nowhere in sight.\n\nHowever, at 14,000 meters I saw blackish peaks rising in the midst\nof the waters.  But these summits could have belonged to mountains\nas high or even higher than the Himalayas or Mt.  Blanc, and the extent\nof these depths remained incalculable.\n\nDespite the powerful pressures it was undergoing, the Nautilus sank\nstill deeper.  I could feel its sheet-iron plates trembling down to\ntheir riveted joins; metal bars arched; bulkheads groaned; the lounge\nwindows seemed to be warping inward under the water's pressure.\nAnd this whole sturdy mechanism would surely have given way, if, as its\ncaptain had said, it weren't capable of resisting like a solid block.\n\nWhile grazing these rocky slopes lost under the waters, I still\nspotted some seashells, tube worms, lively annelid worms from\nthe genus Spirorbis, and certain starfish specimens.\n\nBut soon these last representatives of animal life vanished,\nand three vertical leagues down, the Nautilus passed below the limits\nof underwater existence just as an air balloon rises above the\nbreathable zones in the sky.  We reached a depth of 16,000 meters--\nfour vertical leagues--and by then the Nautilus's plating was\ntolerating a pressure of 1,600 atmospheres, in other words,\n1,600 kilograms per each square centimeter on its surface!\n\n\"What an experience!\"  I exclaimed.  \"Traveling these deep\nregions where no man has ever ventured before!  Look, captain!\nLook at these magnificent rocks, these uninhabited caves,\nthese last global haunts where life is no longer possible!\nWhat unheard-of scenery, and why are we reduced to preserving it\nonly as a memory?\"\n\n\"Would you like,\" Captain Nemo asked me, \"to bring back more than\njust a memory?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that nothing could be easier than taking a photograph\nof this underwater region!\"\n\nBefore I had time to express the surprise this new proposition caused me,\na camera was carried into the lounge at Captain Nemo's request.\nThe liquid setting, electrically lit, unfolded with perfect\nclarity through the wide-open panels.  No shadows, no blurs,\nthanks to our artificial light.  Not even sunshine could have\nbeen better for our purposes.  With the thrust of its propeller\ncurbed by the slant of its fins, the Nautilus stood still.\nThe camera was aimed at the scenery on the ocean floor, and in a few\nseconds we had a perfect negative.\n\nI attach a print of the positive.  In it you can view these primordial\nrocks that have never seen the light of day, this nether granite\nthat forms the powerful foundation of our globe, the deep caves\ncut into the stony mass, the outlines of incomparable distinctness\nwhose far edges stand out in black as if from the brush of certain\nFlemish painters.  In the distance is a mountainous horizon, a wondrously\nundulating line that makes up the background of this landscape.\nThe general effect of these smooth rocks is indescribable:\nblack, polished, without moss or other blemish, carved into\nstrange shapes, sitting firmly on a carpet of sand that sparkled\nbeneath our streams of electric light.\n\nMeanwhile, his photographic operations over, Captain Nemo told me:\n\n\"Let's go back up, professor.  We mustn't push our luck and expose\nthe Nautilus too long to these pressures.\"\n\n\"Let's go back up!\"  I replied.\n\n\"Hold on tight.\"\n\nBefore I had time to realize why the captain made this recommendation,\nI was hurled to the carpet.\n\nIts fins set vertically, its propeller thrown in gear at\nthe captain's signal, the Nautilus rose with lightning speed,\nshooting upward like an air balloon into the sky.  Vibrating resonantly,\nit knifed through the watery mass.  Not a single detail was visible.\nIn four minutes it had cleared the four vertical leagues separating it\nfrom the surface of the ocean, and after emerging like a flying fish,\nit fell back into the sea, making the waves leap to prodigious heights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\nSperm Whales and Baleen Whales\n\n\nDURING THE NIGHT of March 13-14, the Nautilus resumed its\nsouthward heading.  Once it was abreast of Cape Horn, I thought it\nwould strike west of the cape, make for Pacific seas, and complete\nits tour of the world.  It did nothing of the sort and kept moving\ntoward the southernmost regions.  So where was it bound?  The pole?\nThat was insanity.  I was beginning to think that the captain's\nrecklessness more than justified Ned Land's worst fears.\n\nFor a good while the Canadian had said nothing more to me about\nhis escape plans.  He had become less sociable, almost sullen.\nI could see how heavily this protracted imprisonment was weighing on him.\nI could feel the anger building in him.  Whenever he encountered\nthe captain, his eyes would flicker with dark fire, and I was\nin constant dread that his natural vehemence would cause him\nto do something rash.\n\nThat day, March 14, he and Conseil managed to find me in my stateroom.\nI asked them the purpose of their visit.\n\n\"To put a simple question to you, sir,\" the Canadian answered me.\n\n\"Go on, Ned.\"\n\n\"How many men do you think are on board the Nautilus?\"\n\n\"I'm unable to say, my friend.\"\n\n\"It seems to me,\" Ned Land went on, \"that it wouldn't take much\nof a crew to run a ship like this one.\"\n\n\"Correct,\" I replied.  \"Under existing conditions some ten men\nat the most should be enough to operate it.\"\n\n\"All right,\" the Canadian said, \"then why should there be any\nmore than that?\"\n\n\"Why?\"  I answered.\n\nI stared at Ned Land, whose motives were easy to guess.\n\n\"Because,\" I said, \"if I can trust my hunches, if I truly understand\nthe captain's way of life, his Nautilus isn't simply a ship.\nIt's meant to be a refuge for people like its commander, people who\nhave severed all ties with the shore.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Conseil said, \"but in a nutshell, the Nautilus can hold only\na certain number of men, so couldn't master estimate their maximum?\"\n\n\"How, Conseil?\"\n\n\"By calculating it.  Master is familiar with the ship's capacity,\nhence the amount of air it contains; on the other hand,\nmaster knows how much air each man consumes in the act of breathing,\nand he can compare this data with the fact that the Nautilus must\nrise to the surface every twenty-four hours . . .\"\n\nConseil didn't finish his sentence, but I could easily see what\nhe was driving at.\n\n\"I follow you,\" I said.  \"But while they're simple to do,\nsuch calculations can give only a very uncertain figure.\"\n\n\"No problem,\" the Canadian went on insistently.\n\n\"Then here's how to calculate it,\" I replied.  \"In one hour\neach man consumes the oxygen contained in 100 liters of air,\nhence during twenty-four hours the oxygen contained in 2,400 liters.\nTherefore, we must look for the multiple of 2,400 liters of air\nthat gives us the amount found in the Nautilus.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" Conseil said.\n\n\"Now then,\" I went on, \"the Nautilus's capacity is 1,500 metric tons,\nand that of a ton is 1,000 liters, so the Nautilus holds 1,500,000\nliters of air, which, divided by 2,400 . . .\"\n\nI did a quick pencil calculation.\n\n\". . . gives us the quotient of 625.  Which is tantamount to saying\nthat the air contained in the Nautilus would be exactly enough\nfor 625 men over twenty-four hours.\"\n\n\"625!\"  Ned repeated.\n\n\"But rest assured,\" I added, \"that between passengers, seamen,\nor officers, we don't total one-tenth of that figure.\"\n\n\"Which is still too many for three men!\"  Conseil muttered.\n\n\"So, my poor Ned, I can only counsel patience.\"\n\n\"And,\" Conseil replied, \"even more than patience, resignation.\"\n\nConseil had said the true word.\n\n\"Even so,\" he went on, \"Captain Nemo can't go south forever!\nHe'll surely have to stop, if only at the Ice Bank, and he'll\nreturn to the seas of civilization!  Then it will be time to resume\nNed Land's plans.\"\n\nThe Canadian shook his head, passed his hand over his brow,\nmade no reply, and left us.\n\n\"With master's permission, I'll make an observation to him,\"\nConseil then told me.  \"Our poor Ned broods about all\nthe things he can't have.  He's haunted by his former life.\nHe seems to miss everything that's denied us.  He's obsessed by his\nold memories and it's breaking his heart.  We must understand him.\nWhat does he have to occupy him here?  Nothing.  He isn't a scientist\nlike master, and he doesn't share our enthusiasm for the sea's wonders.\nHe would risk anything just to enter a tavern in his own country!\"\n\nTo be sure, the monotony of life on board must have seemed unbearable\nto the Canadian, who was accustomed to freedom and activity.\nIt was a rare event that could excite him.  That day, however,\na development occurred that reminded him of his happy years\nas a harpooner.\n\nNear eleven o'clock in the morning, while on the surface of\nthe ocean, the Nautilus fell in with a herd of baleen whales.\nThis encounter didn't surprise me, because I knew these animals\nwere being hunted so relentlessly that they took refuge in the ocean\nbasins of the high latitudes.\n\nIn the maritime world and in the realm of geographic exploration,\nwhales have played a major role.  This is the animal that first\ndragged the Basques in its wake, then Asturian Spaniards, Englishmen,\nand Dutchmen, emboldening them against the ocean's perils,\nand leading them to the ends of the earth.  Baleen whales like\nto frequent the southernmost and northernmost seas.  Old legends\neven claim that these cetaceans led fishermen to within a mere\nseven leagues of the North Pole.  Although this feat is fictitious,\nit will someday come true, because it's likely that by hunting\nwhales in the Arctic or Antarctic regions, man will finally reach\nthis unknown spot on the globe.\n\nWe were seated on the platform next to a tranquil sea.  The month\nof March, since it's the equivalent of October in these latitudes,\nwas giving us some fine autumn days.  It was the Canadian--\non this topic he was never mistaken--who sighted a baleen whale\non the eastern horizon.  If you looked carefully, you could see\nits blackish back alternately rise and fall above the waves,\nfive miles from the Nautilus.\n\n\"Wow!\"  Ned Land exclaimed.  \"If I were on board a whaler,\nthere's an encounter that would be great fun!  That's one big animal!\nLook how high its blowholes are spouting all that air and steam!\nDamnation!  Why am I chained to this hunk of sheet iron!\"\n\n\"Why, Ned!\"  I replied.  \"You still aren't over your old fishing urges?\"\n\n\"How could a whale fisherman forget his old trade, sir?  Who could\never get tired of such exciting hunting?\"\n\n\"You've never fished these seas, Ned?\"\n\n\"Never, sir.  Just the northernmost seas, equally in the Bering Strait\nand the Davis Strait.\"\n\n\"So the southern right whale is still unknown to you.\nUntil now it's the bowhead whale you've hunted, and it won't risk\ngoing past the warm waters of the equator.\"\n\n\"Oh, professor, what are you feeding me?\" the Canadian answered\nin a tolerably skeptical tone.\n\n\"I'm feeding you the facts.\"\n\n\"By thunder!  In '65, just two and a half years ago, I to whom you speak,\nI myself stepped onto the carcass of a whale near Greenland,\nand its flank still carried the marked harpoon of a whaling ship\nfrom the Bering Sea.  Now I ask you, after it had been wounded\nwest of America, how could this animal be killed in the east,\nunless it had cleared the equator and doubled Cape Horn or the Cape\nof Good Hope?\"\n\n\"I agree with our friend Ned,\" Conseil said, \"and I'm waiting\nto hear how master will reply to him.\"\n\n\"Master will reply, my friends, that baleen whales are localized,\naccording to species, within certain seas that they never leave.\nAnd if one of these animals went from the Bering Strait\nto the Davis Strait, it's quite simply because there's some\npassageway from the one sea to the other, either along the coasts\nof Canada or Siberia.\"\n\n\"You expect us to fall for that?\" the Canadian asked, tipping me a wink.\n\n\"If master says so,\" Conseil replied.\n\n\"Which means,\" the Canadian went on, \"since I've never fished\nthese waterways, I don't know the whales that frequent them?\"\n\n\"That's what I've been telling you, Ned.\"\n\n\"All the more reason to get to know them,\" Conseil answered.\n\n\"Look!  Look!\" the Canadian exclaimed, his voice full of excitement.\n\"It's approaching!  It's coming toward us!  It's thumbing its nose at me!\nIt knows I can't do a blessed thing to it!\"\n\nNed stamped his foot.  Brandishing an imaginary harpoon,\nhis hands positively trembled.\n\n\"These cetaceans,\" he asked, \"are they as big as the ones in\nthe northernmost seas?\"\n\n\"Pretty nearly, Ned.\"\n\n\"Because I've seen big baleen whales, sir, whales measuring up\nto 100 feet long!  I've even heard that those rorqual whales off\nthe Aleutian Islands sometimes get over 150 feet.\"\n\n\"That strikes me as exaggerated,\" I replied.  \"Those animals are\nonly members of the genus Balaenoptera furnished with dorsal fins,\nand like sperm whales, they're generally smaller than the bowhead whale.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed the Canadian, whose eyes hadn't left the ocean.\n\"It's getting closer, it's coming into the Nautilus's waters!\"\n\nThen, going on with his conversation:\n\n\"You talk about sperm whales,\" he said, \"as if they were\nlittle beasts!  But there are stories of gigantic sperm whales.\nThey're shrewd cetaceans.  I hear that some will cover themselves\nwith algae and fucus plants.  People mistake them for islets.\nThey pitch camp on top, make themselves at home, light a fire--\"\n\n\"Build houses,\" Conseil said.\n\n\"Yes, funny man,\" Ned Land replied.  \"Then one fine day the animal\ndives and drags all its occupants down into the depths.\"\n\n\"Like in the voyages of Sinbad the Sailor,\" I answered, laughing.\n\"Oh, Mr. Land, you're addicted to tall tales!  What sperm whales\nyou're handing us!  I hope you don't really believe in them!\"\n\n\"Mr. Naturalist,\" the Canadian replied in all seriousness, \"when it\ncomes to whales, you can believe anything!  (Look at that one move!\nLook at it stealing away!) People claim these animals can circle\naround the world in just fifteen days.\"\n\n\"I don't say nay.\"\n\n\"But what you undoubtedly don't know, Professor Aronnax, is that at\nthe beginning of the world, whales traveled even quicker.\"\n\n\"Oh really, Ned!  And why so?\"\n\n\"Because in those days their tails moved side to side,\nlike those on fish, in other words, their tails were straight up,\nthrashing the water from left to right, right to left.\nBut spotting that they swam too fast, our Creator twisted their tails,\nand ever since they've been thrashing the waves up and down,\nat the expense of their speed.\"\n\n\"Fine, Ned,\" I said, then resurrected one of the Canadian's expressions.\n\"You expect us to fall for that?\"\n\n\"Not too terribly,\" Ned Land replied, \"and no more than if I told you\nthere are whales that are 300 feet long and weigh 1,000,000 pounds.\"\n\n\"That's indeed considerable,\" I said.  \"But you must admit that\ncertain cetaceans do grow to significant size, since they're said\nto supply as much as 120 metric tons of oil.\"\n\n\"That I've seen,\" the Canadian said.\n\n\"I can easily believe it, Ned, just as I can believe that certain\nbaleen whales equal 100 elephants in bulk.  Imagine the impact\nof such a mass if it were launched at full speed!\"\n\n\"Is it true,\" Conseil asked, \"that they can sink ships?\"\n\n\"Ships?  I doubt it,\" I replied.  \"However, they say that in 1820,\nright in these southern seas, a baleen whale rushed at the Essex\nand pushed it backward at a speed of four meters per second.\nIts stern was flooded, and the Essex went down fast.\"\n\nNed looked at me with a bantering expression.\n\n\"Speaking for myself,\" he said, \"I once got walloped by a whale's tail--\nin my longboat, needless to say.  My companions and I were launched\nto an altitude of six meters.  But next to the professor's whale,\nmine was just a baby.\"\n\n\"Do these animals live a long time?\"  Conseil asked.\n\n\"A thousand years,\" the Canadian replied without hesitation.\n\n\"And how, Ned,\" I asked, \"do you know that's so?\"\n\n\"Because people say so.\"\n\n\"And why do people say so?\"\n\n\"Because people know so.\"\n\n\"No, Ned!  People don't know so, they suppose so, and here's the logic\nwith which they back up their beliefs.  When fishermen first hunted whales\n400 years ago, these animals grew to bigger sizes than they do today.\nReasonably enough, it's assumed that today's whales are smaller\nbecause they haven't had time to reach their full growth.\nThat's why the Count de Buffon's encyclopedia says that cetaceans\ncan live, and even must live, for a thousand years.  You understand?\"\n\nNed Land didn't understand.  He no longer even heard me.\nThat baleen whale kept coming closer.  His eyes devoured it.\n\n\"Oh!\" he exclaimed.  \"It's not just one whale, it's ten, twenty,\na whole gam!  And I can't do a thing!  I'm tied hand and foot!\"\n\n\"But Ned my friend,\" Conseil said, \"why not ask Captain Nemo\nfor permission to hunt--\"\n\nBefore Conseil could finish his sentence, Ned Land scooted down\nthe hatch and ran to look for the captain.  A few moments later,\nthe two of them reappeared on the platform.\n\nCaptain Nemo observed the herd of cetaceans cavorting on the waters\na mile from the Nautilus.\n\n\"They're southern right whales,\" he said.  \"There goes the fortune\nof a whole whaling fleet.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" the Canadian asked, \"couldn't I hunt them, just so I\ndon't forget my old harpooning trade?\"\n\n\"Hunt them?  What for?\"  Captain Nemo replied.  \"Simply to destroy them?\nWe have no use for whale oil on this ship.\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" the Canadian went on, \"in the Red Sea you authorized\nus to chase a dugong!\"\n\n\"There it was an issue of obtaining fresh meat for my crew.\nHere it would be killing for the sake of killing.  I'm well aware\nthat's a privilege reserved for mankind, but I don't allow such\nmurderous pastimes.  When your peers, Mr. Land, destroy decent,\nharmless creatures like the southern right whale or the bowhead whale,\nthey commit a reprehensible offense.  Thus they've already depopulated\nall of Baffin Bay, and they'll wipe out a whole class of useful animals.\nSo leave these poor cetaceans alone.  They have quite enough\nnatural enemies, such as sperm whales, swordfish, and sawfish,\nwithout you meddling with them.\"\n\nI'll let the reader decide what faces the Canadian made during this\nlecture on hunting ethics.  Furnishing such arguments to a professional\nharpooner was a waste of words.  Ned Land stared at Captain Nemo\nand obviously missed his meaning.  But the captain was right.\nThanks to the mindless, barbaric bloodthirstiness of fishermen,\nthe last baleen whale will someday disappear from the ocean.\n\nNed Land whistled \"Yankee Doodle\" between his teeth, stuffed his\nhands in his pockets, and turned his back on us.\n\nMeanwhile Captain Nemo studied the herd of cetaceans, then addressed me:\n\n\"I was right to claim that baleen whales have enough natural enemies\nwithout counting man.  These specimens will soon have to deal\nwith mighty opponents.  Eight miles to leeward, Professor Aronnax,\ncan you see those blackish specks moving about?\"\n\n\"Yes, captain,\" I replied.\n\n\"Those are sperm whales, dreadful animals that I've sometimes\nencountered in herds of 200 or 300!  As for them, they're cruel,\ndestructive beasts, and they deserve to be exterminated.\"\n\nThe Canadian turned swiftly at these last words.\n\n\"Well, captain,\" I said, \"on behalf of the baleen whales,\nthere's still time--\"\n\n\"It's pointless to run any risks, professor.  The Nautilus will\nsuffice to disperse these sperm whales.  It's armed with a steel\nspur quite equal to Mr. Land's harpoon, I imagine.\"\n\nThe Canadian didn't even bother shrugging his shoulders.\nAttacking cetaceans with thrusts from a spur!  Who ever heard\nof such malarkey!\n\n\"Wait and see, Professor Aronnax,\" Captain Nemo said.\n\"We'll show you a style of hunting with which you aren't yet familiar.\nWe'll take no pity on these ferocious cetaceans.  They're merely\nmouth and teeth!\"\n\nMouth and teeth!  There's no better way to describe the long-skulled\nsperm whale, whose length sometimes exceeds twenty-five meters.\nThe enormous head of this cetacean occupies about a third of its body.\nBetter armed than a baleen whale, whose upper jaw is adorned solely\nwith whalebone, the sperm whale is equipped with twenty-five\nhuge teeth that are twenty centimeters high, have cylindrical,\nconical summits, and weigh two pounds each.  In the top part of this\nenormous head, inside big cavities separated by cartilage, you'll find\n300 to 400 kilograms of that valuable oil called \"spermaceti.\"\nThe sperm whale is an awkward animal, more tadpole than fish,\nas Professor Fr\u00e9dol has noted.  It's poorly constructed,\nbeing \"defective,\" so to speak, over the whole left side of its frame,\nwith good eyesight only in its right eye.\n\nMeanwhile that monstrous herd kept coming closer.\nIt had seen the baleen whales and was preparing to attack.\nYou could tell in advance that the sperm whales would be victorious,\nnot only because they were better built for fighting than their\nharmless adversaries, but also because they could stay longer\nunderwater before returning to breathe at the surface.\n\nThere was just time to run to the rescue of the baleen whales.\nThe Nautilus proceeded to midwater.  Conseil, Ned, and I sat in front\nof the lounge windows.  Captain Nemo made his way to the helmsman's\nside to operate his submersible as an engine of destruction.\nSoon I felt the beats of our propeller getting faster, and we\npicked up speed.\n\nThe battle between sperm whales and baleen whales had already begun\nwhen the Nautilus arrived.  It maneuvered to cut into the herd\nof long-skulled predators.  At first the latter showed little\nconcern at the sight of this new monster meddling in the battle.\nBut they soon had to sidestep its thrusts.\n\nWhat a struggle!  Ned Land quickly grew enthusiastic and even ended\nup applauding.  Brandished in its captain's hands, the Nautilus was\nsimply a fearsome harpoon.  He hurled it at those fleshy masses and ran\nthem clean through, leaving behind two squirming animal halves.\nAs for those daunting strokes of the tail hitting our sides,\nthe ship never felt them.  No more than the collisions it caused.\nOne sperm whale exterminated, it ran at another, tacked on the spot\nso as not to miss its prey, went ahead or astern, obeyed its rudder,\ndived when the cetacean sank to deeper strata, rose with it\nwhen it returned to the surface, struck it head-on or slantwise,\nhacked at it or tore it, and from every direction and at any speed,\nskewered it with its dreadful spur.\n\nWhat bloodshed!  What a hubbub on the surface of the waves!\nWhat sharp hisses and snorts unique to these frightened animals!\nTheir tails churned the normally peaceful strata into actual billows.\n\nThis Homeric slaughter dragged on for an hour, and the long-skulled\npredators couldn't get away.  Several times ten or twelve of them\nteamed up, trying to crush the Nautilus with their sheer mass.\nThrough the windows you could see their enormous mouths paved\nwith teeth, their fearsome eyes.  Losing all self-control, Ned Land\nhurled threats and insults at them.  You could feel them clinging\nto the submersible like hounds atop a wild boar in the underbrush.\nBut by forcing the pace of its propeller, the Nautilus carried them off,\ndragged them under, or brought them back to the upper level of the waters,\nuntroubled by their enormous weight or their powerful grip.\n\nFinally this mass of sperm whales thinned out.  The waves grew\ntranquil again.  I felt us rising to the surface of the ocean.\nThe hatch opened and we rushed onto the platform.\n\nThe sea was covered with mutilated corpses.  A fearsome explosion\ncouldn't have slashed, torn, or shredded these fleshy masses with\ngreater violence.  We were floating in the midst of gigantic bodies,\nbluish on the back, whitish on the belly, and all deformed\nby enormous protuberances.  A few frightened sperm whales were\nfleeing toward the horizon.  The waves were dyed red over an area\nof several miles, and the Nautilus was floating in the middle\nof a sea of blood.\n\nCaptain Nemo rejoined us.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Land?\" he said.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" replied the Canadian, whose enthusiasm had subsided,\n\"it's a dreadful sight for sure.  But I'm a hunter not a butcher,\nand this is plain butchery.\"\n\n\"It was a slaughter of destructive animals,\" the captain replied,\n\"and the Nautilus is no butcher knife.\"\n\n\"I prefer my harpoon,\" the Canadian answered.\n\n\"To each his own,\" the captain replied, staring intently at Ned Land.\n\nI was in dread the latter would give way to some violent outburst\nthat might have had deplorable consequences.  But his anger was\ndiverted by the sight of a baleen whale that the Nautilus had pulled\nalongside of just then.\n\nThis animal had been unable to escape the teeth of those sperm whales.\nI recognized the southern right whale, its head squat, its body dark\nall over.  Anatomically, it's distinguished from the white whale and\nthe black right whale by the fusion of its seven cervical vertebrae,\nand it numbers two more ribs than its relatives.  Floating on its side,\nits belly riddled with bites, the poor cetacean was dead.\nStill hanging from the tip of its mutilated fin was a little baby\nwhale that it had been unable to rescue from the slaughter.\nIts open mouth let water flow through its whalebone like a murmuring surf.\n\nCaptain Nemo guided the Nautilus next to the animal's corpse.\nTwo of his men climbed onto the whale's flank, and to my astonishment,\nI saw them draw from its udders all the milk they held, in other words,\nenough to fill two or three casks.\n\nThe captain offered me a cup of this still-warm milk.\nI couldn't help showing my distaste for such a beverage.\nHe assured me that this milk was excellent, no different from cow's milk.\n\nI sampled it and agreed.  So this milk was a worthwhile reserve\nration for us, because in the form of salt butter or cheese,\nit would provide a pleasant change of pace from our standard fare.\n\nFrom that day on, I noted with some uneasiness that Ned Land's\nattitudes toward Captain Nemo grew worse and worse, and I decided\nto keep a close watch on the Canadian's movements and activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\nThe Ice Bank\n\n\nTHE NAUTILUS resumed its unruffled southbound heading.\nIt went along the 50th meridian with considerable speed.\nWould it go to the pole?  I didn't think so, because every previous\nattempt to reach this spot on the globe had failed.  Besides, the season\nwas already quite advanced, since March 13 on Antarctic shores\ncorresponds with September 13 in the northernmost regions,\nwhich marks the beginning of the equinoctial period.\n\nOn March 14 at latitude 55 degrees, I spotted floating ice,\nplain pale bits of rubble twenty to twenty-five feet long,\nwhich formed reefs over which the sea burst into foam.  The Nautilus\nstayed on the surface of the ocean.  Having fished in the Arctic seas,\nNed Land was already familiar with the sight of icebergs.\nConseil and I were marveling at them for the first time.\n\nIn the sky toward the southern horizon, there stretched a dazzling\nwhite band.  English whalers have given this the name \"ice blink.\"\nNo matter how heavy the clouds may be, they can't obscure\nthis phenomenon.  It announces the presence of a pack, or shoal, of ice.\n\nIndeed, larger blocks of ice soon appeared, their brilliance varying\nat the whim of the mists.  Some of these masses displayed green veins,\nas if scrawled with undulating lines of copper sulfate.  Others looked\nlike enormous amethysts, letting the light penetrate their insides.\nThe latter reflected the sun's rays from the thousand facets of\ntheir crystals.  The former, tinted with a bright limestone sheen,\nwould have supplied enough building material to make a whole marble town.\n\nThe farther down south we went, the more these floating islands grew\nin numbers and prominence.  Polar birds nested on them by the thousands.\nThese were petrels, cape pigeons, or puffins, and their calls\nwere deafening.  Mistaking the Nautilus for the corpse of a whale,\nsome of them alighted on it and prodded its resonant sheet iron\nwith pecks of their beaks.\n\nDuring this navigating in the midst of the ice, Captain Nemo\noften stayed on the platform.  He observed these deserted\nwaterways carefully.  I saw his calm eyes sometimes perk up.\nIn these polar seas forbidden to man, did he feel right at home,\nthe lord of these unreachable regions?  Perhaps.  But he didn't say.\nHe stood still, reviving only when his pilot's instincts took over.\nThen, steering his Nautilus with consummate dexterity, he skillfully\ndodged the masses of ice, some of which measured several miles\nin length, their heights varying from seventy to eighty meters.\nOften the horizon seemed completely closed off.  Abreast of latitude\n60 degrees, every passageway had disappeared.  Searching with care,\nCaptain Nemo soon found a narrow opening into which he brazenly slipped,\nwell aware, however, that it would close behind him.\n\nGuided by his skillful hands, the Nautilus passed by all these different\nmasses of ice, which are classified by size and shape with a precision\nthat enraptured Conseil:  \"icebergs,\" or mountains; \"ice fields,\"\nor smooth, limitless tracts; \"drift ice,\" or floating floes;\n\"packs,\" or broken tracts, called \"patches\" when they're circular\nand \"streams\" when they form long strips.\n\nThe temperature was fairly low.  Exposed to the outside air,\nthe thermometer marked -2 degrees to\n\n-3 degrees centigrade.  But we were warmly dressed in furs,\nfor which seals and aquatic bears had paid the price.  Evenly heated\nby all its electric equipment, the Nautilus's interior defied\nthe most intense cold.  Moreover, to find a bearable temperature,\nthe ship had only to sink just a few meters beneath the waves.\n\nTwo months earlier we would have enjoyed perpetual daylight in\nthis latitude; but night already fell for three or four hours, and later\nit would cast six months of shadow over these circumpolar regions.\n\nOn March 15 we passed beyond the latitude of the South Shetland and\nSouth Orkney Islands.  The captain told me that many tribes of seals\nused to inhabit these shores; but English and American whalers,\nin a frenzy of destruction, slaughtered all the adults,\nincluding pregnant females, and where life and activity once existed,\nthose fishermen left behind only silence and death.\n\nGoing along the 55th meridian, the Nautilus cut the Antarctic Circle\non March 16 near eight o'clock in the morning.  Ice completely\nsurrounded us and closed off the horizon.  Nevertheless, Captain Nemo\nwent from passageway to passageway, always proceeding south.\n\n\"But where's he going?\"  I asked.\n\n\"Straight ahead,\" Conseil replied.  \"Ultimately, when he can't go\nany farther, he'll stop.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't bet on it!\"  I replied.\n\nAnd in all honesty, I confess that this venturesome excursion\nwas far from displeasing to me.  I can't express the intensity\nof my amazement at the beauties of these new regions.\nThe ice struck superb poses.  Here, its general effect suggested\nan oriental town with countless minarets and mosques.  There, a city\nin ruins, flung to the ground by convulsions in the earth.\nThese views were varied continuously by the sun's oblique rays,\nor were completely swallowed up by gray mists in the middle of blizzards.\nThen explosions, cave-ins, and great iceberg somersaults would occur\nall around us, altering the scenery like the changing landscape\nin a diorama.\n\nIf the Nautilus was submerged during these losses of balance, we heard\nthe resulting noises spread under the waters with frightful intensity,\nand the collapse of these masses created daunting eddies down\nto the ocean's lower strata.  The Nautilus then rolled and pitched\nlike a ship left to the fury of the elements.\n\nOften, no longer seeing any way out, I thought we were imprisoned\nfor good, but Captain Nemo, guided by his instincts, discovered new\npassageways from the tiniest indications.  He was never wrong\nwhen he observed slender threads of bluish water streaking through\nthese ice fields.  Accordingly, I was sure that he had already\nrisked his Nautilus in the midst of the Antarctic seas.\n\nHowever, during the day of March 16, these tracts of ice completely\nbarred our path.  It wasn't the Ice Bank as yet, just huge ice\nfields cemented together by the cold.  This obstacle couldn't stop\nCaptain Nemo, and he launched his ship against the ice fields\nwith hideous violence.  The Nautilus went into these brittle\nmasses like a wedge, splitting them with dreadful cracklings.\nIt was an old-fashioned battering ram propelled with infinite power.\nHurled aloft, ice rubble fell back around us like hail.\nThrough brute force alone, the submersible carved out a channel\nfor itself.  Carried away by its momentum, the ship sometimes mounted\non top of these tracts of ice and crushed them with its weight,\nor at other times, when cooped up beneath the ice fields, it split\nthem with simple pitching movements, creating wide punctures.\n\nViolent squalls assaulted us during the daytime.  Thanks to certain\nheavy mists, we couldn't see from one end of the platform to the other.\nThe wind shifted abruptly to every point on the compass.\nThe snow was piling up in such packed layers, it had to be chipped\nloose with blows from picks.  Even in a temperature of merely -5\ndegrees centigrade, every outside part of the Nautilus was covered\nwith ice.  A ship's rigging would have been unusable, because all\nits tackle would have jammed in the grooves of the pulleys.\nOnly a craft without sails, driven by an electric motor that needed\nno coal, could face such high latitudes.\n\nUnder these conditions the barometer generally stayed quite low.\nIt fell as far as 73.5 centimeters.  Our compass indications\nno longer offered any guarantees.  The deranged needles would\nmark contradictory directions as we approached the southern\nmagnetic pole, which doesn't coincide with the South Pole proper.\nIn fact, according to the astronomer Hansteen, this magnetic pole is\nlocated fairly close to latitude 70 degrees and longitude 130 degrees,\nor abiding by the observations of Louis-Isidore Duperrey, in longitude\n135 degrees and latitude 70 degrees 30'. Hence we had to transport\ncompasses to different parts of the ship, take many readings,\nand strike an average.  Often we could chart our course only by guesswork,\na less than satisfactory method in the midst of these winding\npassageways whose landmarks change continuously.\n\nAt last on March 18, after twenty futile assaults, the Nautilus\nwas decisively held in check.  No longer was it an ice stream,\npatch, or field--it was an endless, immovable barrier formed by ice\nmountains fused to each other.\n\n\"The Ice Bank!\" the Canadian told me.\n\nFor Ned Land, as well as for every navigator before us, I knew\nthat this was the great insurmountable obstacle.  When the sun\nappeared for an instant near noon, Captain Nemo took a reasonably\naccurate sight that gave our position as longitude 51 degrees 30'\nand latitude 67 degrees 39' south.  This was a position already\nwell along in these Antarctic regions.\n\nAs for the liquid surface of the sea, there was no longer\nany semblance of it before our eyes.  Before the Nautilus's\nspur there lay vast broken plains, a tangle of confused chunks\nwith all the helter-skelter unpredictability typical of a river's\nsurface a short while before its ice breakup; but in this case\nthe proportions were gigantic.  Here and there stood sharp peaks,\nlean spires that rose as high as 200 feet; farther off, a succession\nof steeply cut cliffs sporting a grayish tint, huge mirrors\nthat reflected the sparse rays of a sun half drowned in mist.\nBeyond, a stark silence reigned in this desolate natural setting,\na silence barely broken by the flapping wings of petrels or puffins.\nBy this point everything was frozen, even sound.\n\nSo the Nautilus had to halt in its venturesome course among these\ntracts of ice.\n\n\"Sir,\" Ned Land told me that day, \"if your captain goes any farther . . .\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"He'll be a superman.\"\n\n\"How so, Ned?\"\n\n\"Because nobody can clear the Ice Bank.  Your captain's a\npowerful man, but damnation, he isn't more powerful than nature.\nIf she draws a boundary line, there you stop, like it or not!\"\n\n\"Correct, Ned Land, but I still want to know what's behind this\nIce Bank!  Behold my greatest source of irritation--a wall!\"\n\n\"Master is right,\" Conseil said.  \"Walls were invented simply\nto frustrate scientists.  All walls should be banned.\"\n\n\"Fine!\" the Canadian put in.  \"But we already know what's behind\nthis Ice Bank.\"\n\n\"What?\"  I asked.\n\n\"Ice, ice, and more ice.\"\n\n\"You may be sure of that, Ned,\" I answered, \"but I'm not.\nThat's why I want to see for myself.\"\n\n\"Well, professor,\" the Canadian replied, \"you can just drop that idea!\nYou've made it to the Ice Bank, which is already far enough,\nbut you won't get any farther, neither your Captain Nemo or\nhis Nautilus.  And whether he wants to or not, we'll head north again,\nin other words, to the land of sensible people.\"\n\nI had to agree that Ned Land was right, and until ships are built\nto navigate over tracts of ice, they'll have to stop at the Ice Bank.\n\nIndeed, despite its efforts, despite the powerful methods it\nused to split this ice, the Nautilus was reduced to immobility.\nOrdinarily, when someone can't go any farther, he still has\nthe option of returning in his tracks.  But here it was just\nas impossible to turn back as to go forward, because every\npassageway had closed behind us, and if our submersible remained\neven slightly stationary, it would be frozen in without delay.\nWhich is exactly what happened near two o'clock in the afternoon,\nand fresh ice kept forming over the ship's sides with astonishing speed.\nI had to admit that Captain Nemo's leadership had been most injudicious.\n\nJust then I was on the platform.  Observing the situation for some while,\nthe captain said to me:\n\n\"Well, professor!  What think you?\"\n\n\"I think we're trapped, captain.\"\n\n\"Trapped!  What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean we can't go forward, backward, or sideways.\nI think that's the standard definition of 'trapped,' at least\nin the civilized world.\"\n\n\"So, Professor Aronnax, you think the Nautilus won't be able\nto float clear?\"\n\n\"Only with the greatest difficulty, captain, since the season\nis already too advanced for you to depend on an ice breakup.\"\n\n\"Oh, professor,\" Captain Nemo replied in an ironic tone,\n\"you never change!  You see only impediments and obstacles!\nI promise you, not only will the Nautilus float clear, it will\ngo farther still!\"\n\n\"Farther south?\"  I asked, gaping at the captain.\n\n\"Yes, sir, it will go to the pole.\"\n\n\"To the pole!\"  I exclaimed, unable to keep back a movement of disbelief.\n\n\"Yes,\" the captain replied coolly, \"the Antarctic pole,\nthat unknown spot crossed by every meridian on the globe.\nAs you know, I do whatever I like with my Nautilus.\"\n\nYes, I did know that!  I knew this man was daring to the point\nof being foolhardy.  But to overcome all the obstacles around\nthe South Pole--even more unattainable than the North Pole,\nwhich still hadn't been reached by the boldest navigators--\nwasn't this an absolutely insane undertaking, one that could occur\nonly in the brain of a madman?\n\nIt then dawned on me to ask Captain Nemo if he had already discovered\nthis pole, which no human being had ever trod underfoot.\n\n\"No, sir,\" he answered me, \"but we'll discover it together.\nWhere others have failed, I'll succeed.  Never before has my\nNautilus cruised so far into these southernmost seas, but I repeat:\nit will go farther still.\"\n\n\"I'd like to believe you, captain,\" I went on in a tone of some sarcasm.\n\"Oh I do believe you!  Let's forge ahead!  There are no obstacles for us!\nLet's shatter this Ice Bank!  Let's blow it up, and if it still resists,\nlet's put wings on the Nautilus and fly over it!\"\n\n\"Over it, professor?\"  Captain Nemo replied serenely.\n\"No, not over it, but under it.\"\n\n\"Under it!\"  I exclaimed.\n\nA sudden insight into Captain Nemo's plans had just flashed through\nmy mind.  I understood.  The marvelous talents of his Nautilus\nwould be put to work once again in this superhuman undertaking!\n\n\"I can see we're starting to understand each other, professor,\"\nCaptain Nemo told me with a half smile.  \"You already glimpse\nthe potential--myself, I'd say the success--of this attempt.\nManeuvers that aren't feasible for an ordinary ship are easy for\nthe Nautilus.  If a continent emerges at the pole, we'll stop at\nthat continent.  But on the other hand, if open sea washes the pole,\nwe'll go to that very place!\"\n\n\"Right,\" I said, carried away by the captain's logic.\n\"Even though the surface of the sea has solidified into ice,\nits lower strata are still open, thanks to that divine justice that puts\nthe maximum density of salt water one degree above its freezing point.\nAnd if I'm not mistaken, the submerged part of this Ice Bank is\nin a four-to-one ratio to its emerging part.\"\n\n\"Very nearly, professor.  For each foot of iceberg above the sea,\nthere are three more below.  Now then, since these ice mountains don't\nexceed a height of 100 meters, they sink only to a depth of 300 meters.\nAnd what are 300 meters to the Nautilus?\"\n\n\"A mere nothing, sir.\"\n\n\"We could even go to greater depths and find that temperature layer\ncommon to all ocean water, and there we'd brave with impunity\nthe -30 degrees or -40 degrees cold on the surface.\"\n\n\"True, sir, very true,\" I replied with growing excitement.\n\n\"Our sole difficulty,\" Captain Nemo went on, \"lies in our staying\nsubmerged for several days without renewing our air supply.\"\n\n\"That's all?\"  I answered.  \"The Nautilus has huge air tanks;\nwe'll fill them up and they'll supply all the oxygen we need.\"\n\n\"Good thinking, Professor Aronnax,\" the captain replied with a smile.\n\"But since I don't want to be accused of foolhardiness, I'm giving\nyou all my objections in advance.\"\n\n\"You have more?\"\n\n\"Just one.  If a sea exists at the South Pole, it's possible\nthis sea may be completely frozen over, so we couldn't come up\nto the surface!\"\n\n\"My dear sir, have you forgotten that the Nautilus is armed\nwith a fearsome spur?  Couldn't it be launched diagonally against\nthose tracts of ice, which would break open from the impact?\"\n\n\"Ah, professor, you're full of ideas today!\"\n\n\"Besides, captain,\" I added with still greater enthusiasm,\n\"why wouldn't we find open sea at the South Pole just as at\nthe North Pole?  The cold-temperature poles and the geographical\npoles don't coincide in either the northern or southern hemispheres,\nand until proof to the contrary, we can assume these two spots\non the earth feature either a continent or an ice-free ocean.\"\n\n\"I think as you do, Professor Aronnax,\" Captain Nemo replied.\n\"I'll only point out that after raising so many objections against\nmy plan, you're now crushing me under arguments in its favor.\"\n\nCaptain Nemo was right.  I was outdoing him in daring!\nIt was I who was sweeping him to the pole.  I was leading\nthe way, I was out in front . . . but no, you silly fool!\nCaptain Nemo already knew the pros and cons of this question,\nand it amused him to see you flying off into impossible fantasies!\n\nNevertheless, he didn't waste an instant.  At his signal,\nthe chief officer appeared.  The two men held a quick exchange\nin their incomprehensible language, and either the chief officer\nhad been alerted previously or he found the plan feasible,\nbecause he showed no surprise.\n\nBut as unemotional as he was, he couldn't have been more impeccably\nemotionless than Conseil when I told the fine lad our intention\nof pushing on to the South Pole.  He greeted my announcement with\nthe usual \"As master wishes,\" and I had to be content with that.\nAs for Ned Land, no human shoulders ever executed a higher shrug\nthan the pair belonging to our Canadian.\n\n\"Honestly, sir,\" he told me.  \"You and your Captain Nemo, I\npity you both!\"\n\n\"But we will go to the pole, Mr. Land.\"\n\n\"Maybe, but you won't come back!\"\n\nAnd Ned Land reentered his cabin, \"to keep from doing\nsomething desperate,\" he said as he left me.\n\nMeanwhile preparations for this daring attempt were getting under way.\nThe Nautilus's powerful pumps forced air down into the tanks\nand stored it under high pressure.  Near four o'clock Captain Nemo\ninformed me that the platform hatches were about to be closed.\nI took a last look at the dense Ice Bank we were going to conquer.\nThe weather was fair, the skies reasonably clear, the cold quite brisk,\nnamely -12 degrees centigrade; but after the wind had lulled,\nthis temperature didn't seem too unbearable.\n\nEquipped with picks, some ten men climbed onto the Nautilus's\nsides and cracked loose the ice around the ship's lower plating,\nwhich was soon set free.  This operation was swiftly executed\nbecause the fresh ice was still thin.  We all reentered the interior.\nThe main ballast tanks were filled with the water that hadn't yet\ncongealed at our line of flotation.  The Nautilus submerged without delay.\n\nI took a seat in the lounge with Conseil.  Through the open\nwindow we stared at the lower strata of this southernmost ocean.\nThe thermometer rose again.  The needle on the pressure gauge\nswerved over its dial.\n\nAbout 300 meters down, just as Captain Nemo had predicted,\nwe cruised beneath the undulating surface of the Ice Bank.  But the\nNautilus sank deeper still.  It reached a depth of 800 meters.\nAt the surface this water gave a temperature of -12 degrees centigrade,\nbut now it gave no more than -10 degrees.  Two degrees had already\nbeen gained.  Thanks to its heating equipment, the Nautilus's\ntemperature, needless to say, stayed at a much higher degree.\nEvery maneuver was accomplished with extraordinary precision.\n\n\"With all due respect to master,\" Conseil told me, \"we'll pass it by.\"\n\n\"I fully expect to!\"  I replied in a tone of deep conviction.\n\nNow in open water, the Nautilus took a direct course to the pole\nwithout veering from the 52nd meridian.  From 67 degrees 30'\nto 90 degrees, twenty-two and a half degrees of latitude were\nleft to cross, in other words, slightly more than 500 leagues.\nThe Nautilus adopted an average speed of twenty-six miles per hour,\nthe speed of an express train.  If it kept up this pace, forty hours\nwould do it for reaching the pole.\n\nFor part of the night, the novelty of our circumstances kept Conseil\nand me at the lounge window.  The sea was lit by our beacon's\nelectric rays.  But the depths were deserted.  Fish didn't linger\nin these imprisoned waters.  Here they found merely a passageway\nfor going from the Antarctic Ocean to open sea at the pole.\nOur progress was swift.  You could feel it in the vibrations\nof the long steel hull.\n\nNear two o'clock in the morning, I went to snatch a few hours of sleep.\nConseil did likewise.  I didn't encounter Captain Nemo while going\ndown the gangways.  I assumed that he was keeping to the pilothouse.\n\nThe next day, March 19, at five o'clock in the morning, I was back\nat my post in the lounge.  The electric log indicated that the\nNautilus had reduced speed.  By then it was rising to the surface,\nbut cautiously, while slowly emptying its ballast tanks.\n\nMy heart was pounding.  Would we emerge into the open and find\nthe polar air again?\n\nNo. A jolt told me that the Nautilus had bumped the underbelly\nof the Ice Bank, still quite thick to judge from the hollowness\nof the accompanying noise.  Indeed, we had \"struck bottom,\"\nto use nautical terminology, but in the opposite direction\nand at a depth of 3,000 feet.  That gave us 4,000 feet\nof ice overhead, of which 1,000 feet emerged above water.\nSo the Ice Bank was higher here than we had found it on the outskirts.\nA circumstance less than encouraging.\n\nSeveral times that day, the Nautilus repeated the same experiment and\nalways it bumped against this surface that formed a ceiling above it.\nAt certain moments the ship encountered ice at a depth of 900 meters,\ndenoting a thickness of 1,200 meters, of which 300 meters rose above\nthe level of the ocean.  This height had tripled since the moment\nthe Nautilus had dived beneath the waves.\n\nI meticulously noted these different depths, obtaining the underwater\nprofile of this upside-down mountain chain that stretched\nbeneath the sea.\n\nBy evening there was still no improvement in our situation.\nThe ice stayed between 400 and 500 meters deep.  It was obviously\nshrinking, but what a barrier still lay between us and the surface\nof the ocean!\n\nBy then it was eight o'clock. The air inside the Nautilus should have\nbeen renewed four hours earlier, following daily practice on board.\nBut I didn't suffer very much, although Captain Nemo hadn't yet\nmade demands on the supplementary oxygen in his air tanks.\n\nThat night my sleep was fitful.  Hope and fear besieged me by turns.\nI got up several times.  The Nautilus continued groping.\nNear three o'clock in the morning, I observed that we encountered\nthe Ice Bank's underbelly at a depth of only fifty meters.\nSo only 150 feet separated us from the surface of the water.\nLittle by little the Ice Bank was turning into an ice field again.\nThe mountains were changing back into plains.\n\nMy eyes didn't leave the pressure gauge.  We kept rising on a diagonal,\ngoing along this shiny surface that sparkled beneath our electric rays.\nAbove and below, the Ice Bank was subsiding in long gradients.\nMile after mile it was growing thinner.\n\nFinally, at six o'clock in the morning on that memorable day of March 19,\nthe lounge door opened.  Captain Nemo appeared.\n\n\"Open sea!\" he told me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\nThe South Pole\n\n\nI RUSHED UP onto the platform.  Yes, open sea!  Barely a few\nsparse floes, some moving\n\nicebergs; a sea stretching into the distance; hosts of birds\nin the air and myriads of fish under the waters, which varied\nfrom intense blue to olive green depending on the depth.\nThe thermometer marked 3 degrees centigrade.  It was as if a\ncomparative springtime had been locked up behind that Ice Bank,\nwhose distant masses were outlined on the northern horizon.\n\n\"Are we at the pole?\"  I asked the captain, my heart pounding.\n\n\"I've no idea,\" he answered me.  \"At noon we'll fix our position.\"\n\n\"But will the sun show through this mist?\"  I said, staring at\nthe grayish sky.\n\n\"No matter how faintly it shines, it will be enough for me,\"\nthe captain replied.\n\nTo the south, ten miles from the Nautilus, a solitary islet rose\nto a height of 200 meters.  We proceeded toward it, but cautiously,\nbecause this sea could have been strewn with reefs.\n\nIn an hour we had reached the islet.  Two hours later we had completed a\nfull circle around it.  It measured four to five miles in circumference.\nA narrow channel separated it from a considerable shore,\nperhaps a continent whose limits we couldn't see.  The existence\nof this shore seemed to bear out Commander Maury's hypotheses.\nIn essence, this ingenious American has noted that between\nthe South Pole and the 60th parallel, the sea is covered\nwith floating ice of dimensions much greater than any found\nin the north Atlantic.  From this fact he drew the conclusion\nthat the Antarctic Circle must contain considerable shores,\nsince icebergs can't form on the high seas but only along coastlines.\nAccording to his calculations, this frozen mass enclosing the southernmost\npole forms a vast ice cap whose width must reach 4,000 kilometers.\n\nMeanwhile, to avoid running aground, the Nautilus halted three\ncable lengths from a strand crowned by superb piles of rocks.\nThe skiff was launched to sea.  Two crewmen carrying instruments,\nthe captain, Conseil, and I were on board.  It was ten o'clock\nin the morning.  I hadn't seen Ned Land.  No doubt, in the presence\nof the South Pole, the Canadian hated having to eat his words.\n\nA few strokes of the oar brought the skiff to the sand,\nwhere it ran aground.  Just as Conseil was about to jump ashore,\nI held him back.\n\n\"Sir,\" I told Captain Nemo, \"to you belongs the honor of first\nsetting foot on this shore.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the captain replied, \"and if I have no hesitation\nin treading this polar soil, it's because no human being until\nnow has left a footprint here.\"\n\nSo saying, he leaped lightly onto the sand.  His heart must\nhave been throbbing with intense excitement.  He scaled an\noverhanging rock that ended in a small promontory and there,\nmute and motionless, with crossed arms and blazing eyes,\nhe seemed to be laying claim to these southernmost regions.\nAfter spending five minutes in this trance, he turned to us.\n\n\"Whenever you're ready, sir,\" he called to me.\n\nI got out, Conseil at my heels, leaving the two men in the skiff.\n\nOver an extensive area, the soil consisted of that igneous gravel\ncalled \"tuff,\" reddish in color as if made from crushed bricks.\nThe ground was covered with slag, lava flows, and pumice stones.\nIts volcanic origin was unmistakable.  In certain localities thin smoke\nholes gave off a sulfurous odor, showing that the inner fires still kept\ntheir wide-ranging power.  Nevertheless, when I scaled a high escarpment,\nI could see no volcanoes within a radius of several miles.\nIn these Antarctic districts, as is well known, Sir James Clark Ross\nhad found the craters of Mt.  Erebus and Mt.  Terror in fully active\ncondition on the 167th meridian at latitude 77 degrees 32'.\n\nThe vegetation on this desolate continent struck me as quite limited.\nA few lichens of the species Usnea melanoxanthra sprawled over\nthe black rocks.  The whole meager flora of this region consisted\nof certain microscopic buds, rudimentary diatoms made up of a type\nof cell positioned between two quartz-rich shells, plus long purple\nand crimson fucus plants, buoyed by small air bladders and washed\nup on the coast by the surf.\n\nThe beach was strewn with mollusks:  small mussels, limpets, smooth\nheart-shaped cockles, and especially some sea butterflies with oblong,\nmembrane-filled bodies whose heads are formed from two rounded lobes.\nI also saw myriads of those northernmost sea butterflies three\ncentimeters long, which a baleen whale can swallow by the thousands\nin one gulp.  The open waters at the shoreline were alive with\nthese delightful pteropods, true butterflies of the sea.\n\nAmong other zoophytes present in these shallows, there were\na few coral tree forms that, according to Sir James Clark Ross,\nlive in these Antarctic seas at depths as great as 1,000 meters;\nthen small alcyon coral belonging to the species Procellaria pelagica,\nalso a large number of starfish unique to these climes, plus some\nfeather stars spangling the sand.\n\nBut it was in the air that life was superabundant.\nThere various species of birds flew and fluttered by the thousands,\ndeafening us with their calls.  Crowding the rocks, other fowl watched\nwithout fear as we passed and pressed familiarly against our feet.\nThese were auks, as agile and supple in water, where they are sometimes\nmistaken for fast bonito, as they are clumsy and heavy on land.\nThey uttered outlandish calls and participated in numerous public\nassemblies that featured much noise but little action.\n\nAmong other fowl I noted some sheathbills from the wading-bird family,\nthe size of pigeons, white in color, the beak short and conical, the eyes\nframed by red circles.  Conseil laid in a supply of them, because when\nthey're properly cooked, these winged creatures make a pleasant dish.\nIn the air there passed sooty albatross with four-meter wingspans,\nbirds aptly dubbed \"vultures of the ocean,\" also gigantic petrels\nincluding several with arching wings, enthusiastic eaters of seal\nthat are known as quebrantahuesos,* and cape pigeons, a sort\nof small duck, the tops of their bodies black and white--in short,\na whole series of petrels, some whitish with wings trimmed in brown,\nothers blue and exclusive to these Antarctic seas, the former \"so oily,\"\nI told Conseil, \"that inhabitants of the Faroe Islands simply fit\nthe bird with a wick, then light it up.\"\n\n*Spanish: \"ospreys.\"  Ed.\n\n\"With that minor addition,\" Conseil replied, \"these fowl would make\nperfect lamps!  After this, we should insist that nature equip them\nwith wicks in advance!\"\n\nHalf a mile farther on, the ground was completely riddled with\npenguin nests, egg-laying burrows from which numerous birds emerged.\nLater Captain Nemo had hundreds of them hunted because their\nblack flesh is highly edible.  They brayed like donkeys.\nThe size of a goose with slate-colored bodies, white undersides,\nand lemon-colored neck bands, these animals let themselves be stoned\nto death without making any effort to get away.\n\nMeanwhile the mists didn't clear, and by eleven o'clock the sun\nstill hadn't made an appearance.  Its absence disturbed me.\nWithout it, no sights were possible.  Then how could we tell whether\nwe had reached the pole?\n\nWhen I rejoined Captain Nemo, I found him leaning silently against\na piece of rock and staring at the sky.  He seemed impatient, baffled.\nBut what could we do?  This daring and powerful man couldn't control\nthe sun as he did the sea.\n\nNoon arrived without the orb of day appearing for a single instant.\nYou couldn't even find its hiding place behind the curtain of mist.\nAnd soon this mist began to condense into snow.\n\n\"Until tomorrow,\" the captain said simply; and we went back\nto the Nautilus, amid flurries in the air.\n\nDuring our absence the nets had been spread, and I observed with\nfascination the fish just hauled on board.  The Antarctic seas\nserve as a refuge for an extremely large number of migratory fish\nthat flee from storms in the subpolar zones, in truth only to slide\ndown the gullets of porpoises and seals.  I noted some one-decimeter\nsouthern bullhead, a species of whitish cartilaginous fish overrun\nwith bluish gray stripes and armed with stings, then some Antarctic\nrabbitfish three feet long, the body very slender, the skin a smooth\nsilver white, the head rounded, the topside furnished with three fins,\nthe snout ending in a trunk that curved back toward the mouth.\nI sampled its flesh but found it tasteless, despite Conseil's views,\nwhich were largely approving.\n\nThe blizzard lasted until the next day.  It was impossible to stay\non the platform.  From the lounge, where I was writing up the incidents\nof this excursion to the polar continent, I could hear the calls\nof petrel and albatross cavorting in the midst of the turmoil.\nThe Nautilus didn't stay idle, and cruising along the coast,\nit advanced some ten miles farther south amid the half light left\nby the sun as it skimmed the edge of the horizon.\n\nThe next day, March 20, it stopped snowing.  The cold was a little\nmore brisk.  The thermometer marked -2 degrees centigrade.\nThe mist had cleared, and on that day I hoped our noon sights\ncould be accomplished.\n\nSince Captain Nemo hadn't yet appeared, only Conseil and I\nwere taken ashore by the skiff.  The soil's nature was still\nthe same:  volcanic.  Traces of lava, slag, and basaltic rock\nwere everywhere, but I couldn't find the crater that had vomited\nthem up.  There as yonder, myriads of birds enlivened this part\nof the polar continent.  But they had to share their dominion with\nhuge herds of marine mammals that looked at us with gentle eyes.\nThese were seals of various species, some stretched out on the ground,\nothers lying on drifting ice floes, several leaving or reentering\nthe sea.  Having never dealt with man, they didn't run off at\nour approach, and I counted enough of them thereabouts to provision\na couple hundred ships.\n\n\"Ye gods,\" Conseil said, \"it's fortunate that Ned Land didn't\ncome with us!\"\n\n\"Why so, Conseil?\"\n\n\"Because that madcap hunter would kill every animal here.\"\n\n\"Every animal may be overstating it, but in truth I doubt we could keep\nour Canadian friend from harpooning some of these magnificent cetaceans.\nWhich would be an affront to Captain Nemo, since he hates to slay\nharmless beasts needlessly.\"\n\n\"He's right.\"\n\n\"Certainly, Conseil.  But tell me, haven't you finished classifying\nthese superb specimens of marine fauna?\"\n\n\"Master is well aware,\" Conseil replied, \"that I'm not seasoned in\npractical application.  When master has told me these animals' names . . .\"\n\n\"They're seals and walruses.\"\n\n\"Two genera,\" our scholarly Conseil hastened to say, \"that belong\nto the family Pinnipedia, order Carnivora, group Unguiculata,\nsubclass Monodelphia, class Mammalia, branch Vertebrata.\"\n\n\"Very nice, Conseil,\" I replied, \"but these two genera of seals\nand walruses are each divided into species, and if I'm not mistaken,\nwe now have a chance to actually look at them.  Let's.\"\n\nIt was eight o'clock in the morning.  We had four hours\nto ourselves before the sun could be productively observed.\nI guided our steps toward a huge bay that made a crescent-shaped\nincision in the granite cliffs along the beach.\n\nThere, all about us, I swear that the shores and ice floes\nwere crowded with marine mammals as far as the eye could see,\nand I involuntarily looked around for old Proteus, that mythological\nshepherd who guarded King Neptune's immense flocks.  To be specific,\nthese were seals.  They formed distinct male-and-female groups,\nthe father watching over his family, the mother suckling her\nlittle ones, the stronger youngsters emancipated a few paces away.\nWhen these mammals wanted to relocate, they moved in little jumps made\nby contracting their bodies, clumsily helped by their imperfectly\ndeveloped flippers, which, as with their manatee relatives,\nform actual forearms.  In the water, their ideal element, I must say\nthese animals swim wonderfully thanks to their flexible backbones,\nnarrow pelvises, close-cropped hair, and webbed feet.\nResting on shore, they assumed extremely graceful positions.\nConsequently, their gentle features, their sensitive expressions\nequal to those of the loveliest women, their soft, limpid eyes,\ntheir charming poses, led the ancients to glorify them by metamorphosing\nthe males into sea gods and the females into mermaids.\n\nI drew Conseil's attention to the considerable growth\nof the cerebral lobes found in these intelligent cetaceans.\nNo mammal except man has more abundant cerebral matter.\nAccordingly, seals are quite capable of being educated;\nthey make good pets, and together with certain other naturalists,\nI think these animals can be properly trained to perform yeoman\nservice as hunting dogs for fishermen.\n\nMost of these seals were sleeping on the rocks or the sand.\nAmong those properly termed seals--which have no external ears,\nunlike sea lions whose ears protrude--I observed several varieties\nof the species stenorhynchus, three meters long, with white hair,\nbulldog heads, and armed with ten teeth in each jaw:  four incisors\nin both the upper and lower, plus two big canines shaped like the\nfleur-de-lis. Among them slithered some sea elephants, a type of seal\nwith a short, flexible trunk; these are the giants of the species,\nwith a circumference of twenty feet and a length of ten meters.\nThey didn't move as we approached.\n\n\"Are these animals dangerous?\"  Conseil asked me.\n\n\"Only if they're attacked,\" I replied.  \"But when these giant seals\ndefend their little ones, their fury is dreadful, and it isn't rare\nfor them to smash a fisherman's longboat to bits.\"\n\n\"They're within their rights,\" Conseil answered.\n\n\"I don't say nay.\"\n\nTwo miles farther on, we were stopped by a promontory that screened\nthe bay from southerly winds.  It dropped straight down to the sea,\nand surf foamed against it.  From beyond this ridge there came\nfearsome bellows, such as a herd of cattle might produce.\n\n\"Gracious,\" Conseil put in, \"a choir of bulls?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"a choir of walruses.\"\n\n\"Are they fighting with each other?\"\n\n\"Either fighting or playing.\"\n\n\"With all due respect to master, this we must see.\"\n\n\"Then see it we must, Conseil.\"\n\nAnd there we were, climbing these blackish rocks amid sudden landslides\nand over stones slippery with ice.  More than once I took a tumble\nat the expense of my backside.  Conseil, more cautious or more stable,\nbarely faltered and would help me up, saying:\n\n\"If master's legs would kindly adopt a wider stance, master will\nkeep his balance.\"\n\nArriving at the topmost ridge of this promontory, I could see vast\nwhite plains covered with walruses.  These animals were playing\namong themselves.  They were howling not in anger but in glee.\n\nWalruses resemble seals in the shape of their bodies and the arrangement\nof their limbs.  But their lower jaws lack canines and incisors, and as\nfor their upper canines, they consist of two tusks eighty centimeters\nlong with a circumference of thirty-three centimeters at the socket.\nMade of solid ivory, without striations, harder than elephant tusks,\nand less prone to yellowing, these teeth are in great demand.\nAccordingly, walruses are the victims of a mindless hunting that\nsoon will destroy them all, since their hunters indiscriminately\nslaughter pregnant females and youngsters, and over 4,000 individuals\nare destroyed annually.\n\nPassing near these unusual animals, I could examine them at my\nleisure since they didn't stir.  Their hides were rough and heavy,\na tan color leaning toward a reddish brown; their coats were\nshort and less than abundant.  Some were four meters long.\nMore tranquil and less fearful than their northern relatives,\nthey posted no sentinels on guard duty at the approaches\nto their campsite.\n\nAfter examining this community of walruses, I decided to return in\nmy tracks.  It was eleven o'clock, and if Captain Nemo found conditions\nfavorable for taking his sights, I wanted to be present at the operation.\nBut I held no hopes that the sun would make an appearance that day.\nIt was hidden from our eyes by clouds squeezed together on the horizon.\nApparently the jealous orb didn't want to reveal this inaccessible\nspot on the globe to any human being.\n\nYet I decided to return to the Nautilus.  We went along a steep,\nnarrow path that ran over the cliff's summit.  By 11:30 we had arrived\nat our landing place.  The beached skiff had brought the captain ashore.\nI spotted him standing on a chunk of basalt.  His instruments\nwere beside him.  His eyes were focused on the northern horizon,\nalong which the sun was sweeping in its extended arc.\n\nI found a place near him and waited without speaking.  Noon arrived,\nand just as on the day before, the sun didn't put in an appearance.\n\nIt was sheer bad luck.  Our noon sights were still lacking.\nIf we couldn't obtain them tomorrow, we would finally have to give\nup any hope of fixing our position.\n\nIn essence, it was precisely March 20.  Tomorrow, the 21st,\nwas the day of the equinox; the sun would disappear below the horizon\nfor six months not counting refraction, and after its disappearance\nthe long polar night would begin.  Following the September equinox,\nthe sun had emerged above the northerly horizon, rising in long\nspirals until December 21.  At that time, the summer solstice\nof these southernmost districts, the sun had started back down,\nand tomorrow it would cast its last rays.\n\nI shared my thoughts and fears with Captain Nemo.\n\n\"You're right, Professor Aronnax,\" he told me.  \"If I can't take the sun's\naltitude tomorrow, I won't be able to try again for another six months.\nBut precisely because sailors' luck has led me into these seas\non March 21, it will be easy to get our bearings if the noonday\nsun does appear before our eyes.\"\n\n\"Why easy, captain?\"\n\n\"Because when the orb of day sweeps in such long spirals,\nit's difficult to measure its exact altitude above the horizon,\nand our instruments are open to committing serious errors.\"\n\n\"Then what can you do?\"\n\n\"I use only my chronometer,\" Captain Nemo answered me.\n\"At noon tomorrow, March 21, if, after accounting for refraction,\nthe sun's disk is cut exactly in half by the northern horizon,\nthat will mean I'm at the South Pole.\"\n\n\"Right,\" I said.  \"Nevertheless, it isn't mathematically exact proof,\nbecause the equinox needn't fall precisely at noon.\"\n\n\"No doubt, sir, but the error will be under 100 meters, and that's\nclose enough for us.  Until tomorrow then.\"\n\nCaptain Nemo went back on board.  Conseil and I stayed behind\nuntil five o'clock, surveying the beach, observing and studying.\nThe only unusual object I picked up was an auk's egg of remarkable size,\nfor which a collector would have paid more than 1,000 francs.\nIts cream-colored tint, plus the streaks and markings that\ndecorated it like so many hieroglyphics, made it a rare trinket.\nI placed it in Conseil's hands, and holding it like precious\nporcelain from China, that cautious, sure-footed lad got it back\nto the Nautilus in one piece.\n\nThere I put this rare egg inside one of the glass cases in the museum.\nI ate supper, feasting with appetite on an excellent piece of seal\nliver whose flavor reminded me of pork.  Then I went to bed;\nbut not without praying, like a good Hindu, for the favors of\nthe radiant orb.\n\nThe next day, March 21, bright and early at five o'clock in the morning,\nI climbed onto the platform.  I found Captain Nemo there.\n\n\"The weather is clearing a bit,\" he told me.  \"I have high hopes.\nAfter breakfast we'll make our way ashore and choose an observation post.\"\n\nThis issue settled, I went to find Ned Land.  I wanted to take him\nwith me.  The obstinate Canadian refused, and I could clearly see\nthat his tight-lipped mood and his bad temper were growing by the day.\nUnder the circumstances I ultimately wasn't sorry that he refused.\nIn truth, there were too many seals ashore, and it would never do\nto expose this impulsive fisherman to such temptations.\n\nBreakfast over, I made my way ashore.  The Nautilus had gone a few\nmore miles during the night.  It lay well out, a good league from\nthe coast, which was crowned by a sharp peak 400 to 500 meters high.\nIn addition to me, the skiff carried Captain Nemo, two crewmen,\nand the instruments--in other words, a chronometer, a spyglass,\nand a barometer.\n\nDuring our crossing I saw numerous baleen whales belonging to the\nthree species unique to these southernmost seas:  the bowhead whale\n(or \"right whale,\" according to the English), which has no dorsal fin;\nthe humpback whale from the genus Balaenoptera (in other words,\n\"winged whales\"), beasts with wrinkled bellies and huge whitish\nfins that, genus name regardless, do not yet form wings;\nand the finback whale, yellowish brown, the swiftest of all cetaceans.\nThis powerful animal is audible from far away when it sends up\ntowering spouts of air and steam that resemble swirls of smoke.\nHerds of these different mammals were playing about in the\ntranquil waters, and I could easily see that this Antarctic polar\nbasin now served as a refuge for those cetaceans too relentlessly\npursued by hunters.\n\nI also noted long, whitish strings of salps, a type of mollusk\nfound in clusters, and some jellyfish of large size that swayed\nin the eddies of the billows.\n\nBy nine o'clock we had pulled up to shore.  The sky was growing brighter.\nClouds were fleeing to the south.  Mists were rising from\nthe cold surface of the water.  Captain Nemo headed toward\nthe peak, which he no doubt planned to make his observatory.\nIt was an arduous climb over sharp lava and pumice stones in the midst\nof air often reeking with sulfurous fumes from the smoke holes.\nFor a man out of practice at treading land, the captain scaled\nthe steepest slopes with a supple agility I couldn't equal,\nand which would have been envied by hunters of Pyrenees mountain goats.\n\nIt took us two hours to reach the summit of this half-crystal,\nhalf-basalt peak.  From there our eyes scanned a vast sea, which scrawled\nits boundary line firmly against the background of the northern sky.\nAt our feet:  dazzling tracts of white.  Over our heads:\na pale azure, clear of mists.  North of us:  the sun's disk,\nlike a ball of fire already cut into by the edge of the horizon.\nFrom the heart of the waters:  jets of liquid rising like hundreds\nof magnificent bouquets.  Far off, like a sleeping cetacean:\nthe Nautilus.  Behind us to the south and east:  an immense shore,\na chaotic heap of rocks and ice whose limits we couldn't see.\n\nArriving at the summit of this peak, Captain Nemo carefully determined\nits elevation by means of his barometer, since he had to take this\nfactor into account in his noon sights.\n\nAt 11:45 the sun, by then seen only by refraction, looked like a\ngolden disk, dispersing its last rays over this deserted continent\nand down to these seas not yet plowed by the ships of man.\n\nCaptain Nemo had brought a spyglass with a reticular eyepiece,\nwhich corrected the sun's refraction by means of a mirror,\nand he used it to observe the orb sinking little by little\nalong a very extended diagonal that reached below the horizon.\nI held the chronometer.  My heart was pounding mightily.\nIf the lower half of the sun's disk disappeared just as the chronometer\nsaid noon, we were right at the pole.\n\n\"Noon!\"  I called.\n\n\"The South Pole!\"  Captain Nemo replied in a solemn voice,\nhanding me the spyglass, which showed the orb of day cut into two\nexactly equal parts by the horizon.\n\nI stared at the last rays wreathing this peak, while shadows were\ngradually climbing its gradients.\n\nJust then, resting his hand on my shoulder, Captain Nemo said to me:\n\n\"In 1600, sir, the Dutchman Gheritk was swept by storms\nand currents, reaching latitude 64 degrees south and discovering\nthe South Shetland Islands.  On January 17, 1773, the famous Captain Cook\nwent along the 38th meridian, arriving at latitude 67 degrees 30';\nand on January 30, 1774, along the 109th meridian, he reached\nlatitude 71 degrees 15'. In 1819 the Russian Bellinghausen lay on\nthe 69th parallel, and in 1821 on the 66th at longitude 111 degrees west.\nIn 1820 the Englishman Bransfield stopped at 65 degrees.\nThat same year the American Morrel, whose reports are dubious,\nwent along the 42nd meridian, finding open sea at latitude 70 degrees\n14'. In 1825 the Englishman Powell was unable to get beyond 62 degrees.\nThat same year a humble seal fisherman, the Englishman Weddell,\nwent as far as latitude 72 degrees 14' on the 35th meridian, and as\nfar as 74 degrees 15' on the 36th.  In 1829 the Englishman Forster,\ncommander of the Chanticleer, laid claim to the Antarctic continent\nin latitude 63 degrees 26' and longitude 66 degrees 26'. On February 1,\n1831, the Englishman Biscoe discovered Enderby Land at latitude 68\ndegrees 50', Adelaide Land at latitude 67 degrees on February 5,\n1832, and Graham Land at latitude 64 degrees 45' on February 21.\nIn 1838 the Frenchman Dumont d'Urville stopped at the Ice Bank\nin latitude 62 degrees 57', sighting the Louis-Philippe Peninsula;\non January 21 two years later, at a new southerly position of 66\ndegrees 30', he named the Ad\u00e9lie Coast and eight days later,\nthe Clarie Coast at 64 degrees 40'. In 1838 the American Wilkes\nadvanced as far as the 69th parallel on the 100th meridian.\nIn 1839 the Englishman Balleny discovered the Sabrina Coast at the edge\nof the polar circle.  Lastly, on January 12, 1842, with his ships,\nthe Erebus and the Terror, the Englishman Sir James Clark Ross found\nVictoria Land in latitude 70 degrees 56' and longitude 171 degrees 7'\neast; on the 23rd of that same month, he reached the 74th parallel,\na position denoting the Farthest South attained until then;\non the 27th he lay at 76 degrees 8'; on the 28th at 77 degrees 32';\non February 2 at 78 degrees 4'; and late in 1842 he returned to 71\ndegrees but couldn't get beyond it.  Well now!  In 1868, on this 21st\nday of March, I myself, Captain Nemo, have reached the South Pole\nat 90 degrees, and I hereby claim this entire part of the globe,\nequal to one-sixth of the known continents.\"\n\n\"In the name of which sovereign, captain?\"\n\n\"In my own name, sir!\"\n\nSo saying, Captain Nemo unfurled a black flag bearing a gold \"N\"\non its quartered bunting.  Then, turning toward the orb of day,\nwhose last rays were licking at the sea's horizon:\n\n\"Farewell, O sun!\" he called.  \"Disappear, O radiant orb!\nRetire beneath this open sea, and let six months of night spread\ntheir shadows over my new domains!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\nAccident or Incident?\n\n\nTHE NEXT DAY, March 22, at six o'clock in the morning, preparations for\ndeparture began.  The last gleams of twilight were melting into night.\nThe cold was brisk.  The constellations were glittering with\nstartling intensity.  The wonderful Southern Cross, polar star\nof the Antarctic regions, twinkled at its zenith.\n\nThe thermometer marked -12 degrees centigrade, and a fresh breeze\nleft a sharp nip in the air.  Ice floes were increasing over\nthe open water.  The sea was starting to congeal everywhere.\nNumerous blackish patches were spreading over its surface,\nannouncing the imminent formation of fresh ice.  Obviously this\nsouthernmost basin froze over during its six-month winter and became\nutterly inaccessible.  What happened to the whales during this period?\nNo doubt they went beneath the Ice Bank to find more feasible seas.\nAs for seals and walruses, they were accustomed to living\nin the harshest climates and stayed on in these icy waterways.\nThese animals know by instinct how to gouge holes in the ice fields\nand keep them continually open; they go to these holes to breathe.\nOnce the birds have migrated northward to escape the cold,\nthese marine mammals remain as sole lords of the polar continent.\n\nMeanwhile the ballast tanks filled with water and the Nautilus\nsank slowly.  At a depth of 1,000 feet, it stopped.  Its propeller churned\nthe waves and it headed due north at a speed of fifteen miles per hour.\nNear the afternoon it was already cruising under the immense frozen\ncarapace of the Ice Bank.\n\nAs a precaution, the panels in the lounge stayed closed,\nbecause the Nautilus's hull could run afoul of some submerged block\nof ice.  So I spent the day putting my notes into final form.\nMy mind was completely wrapped up in my memories of the pole.\nWe had reached that inaccessible spot without facing exhaustion\nor danger, as if our seagoing passenger carriage had glided there on\nrailroad tracks.  And now we had actually started our return journey.\nDid it still have comparable surprises in store for me?  I felt sure\nit did, so inexhaustible is this series of underwater wonders!\nAs it was, in the five and a half months since fate had brought us\non board, we had cleared 14,000 leagues, and over this track longer\nthan the earth's equator, so many fascinating or frightening incidents\nhad beguiled our voyage:  that hunting trip in the Crespo forests,\nour running aground in the Torres Strait, the coral cemetery,\nthe pearl fisheries of Ceylon, the Arabic tunnel, the fires of Santorini,\nthose millions in the Bay of Vigo, Atlantis, the South Pole!  During the\nnight all these memories crossed over from one dream to the next,\nnot giving my brain a moment's rest.\n\nAt three o'clock in the morning, I was awakened by a violent collision.\nI sat up in bed, listening in the darkness, and then was suddenly\nhurled into the middle of my stateroom.  Apparently the Nautilus\nhad gone aground, then heeled over sharply.\n\nLeaning against the walls, I dragged myself down the gangways\nto the lounge, whose ceiling lights were on.  The furniture had been\nknocked over.  Fortunately the glass cases were solidly secured\nat the base and had stood fast.  Since we were no longer vertical,\nthe starboard pictures were glued to the tapestries, while those\nto port had their lower edges hanging a foot away from the wall.\nSo the Nautilus was lying on its starboard side, completely\nstationary to boot.\n\nIn its interior I heard the sound of footsteps and muffled voices.\nBut Captain Nemo didn't appear.  Just as I was about to leave\nthe lounge, Ned Land and Conseil entered.\n\n\"What happened?\"  I instantly said to them.\n\n\"I came to ask master that,\" Conseil replied.\n\n\"Damnation!\" the Canadian exclaimed.  \"I know full well what happened!\nThe Nautilus has gone aground, and judging from the way it's listing,\nI don't think it'll pull through like that first time in\nthe Torres Strait.\"\n\n\"But,\" I asked, \"are we at least back on the surface of the sea?\"\n\n\"We have no idea,\" Conseil replied.\n\n\"It's easy to find out,\" I answered.\n\nI consulted the pressure gauge.  Much to my surprise, it indicated\na depth of 360 meters.\n\n\"What's the meaning of this?\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"We must confer with Captain Nemo,\" Conseil said.\n\n\"But where do we find him?\"  Ned Land asked.\n\n\"Follow me,\" I told my two companions.\n\nWe left the lounge.  Nobody in the library.  Nobody by the central\ncompanionway or the crew's quarters.  I assumed that Captain Nemo\nwas stationed in the pilothouse.  Best to wait.  The three of us\nreturned to the lounge.\n\nI'll skip over the Canadian's complaints.  He had good grounds\nfor an outburst.  I didn't answer him back, letting him blow off\nall the steam he wanted.\n\nWe had been left to ourselves for twenty minutes, trying to detect\nthe tiniest noises inside the Nautilus, when Captain Nemo entered.\nHe didn't seem to see us.  His facial features, usually so emotionless,\nrevealed a certain uneasiness.  He studied the compass and pressure\ngauge in silence, then went and put his finger on the world map\nat a spot in the sector depicting the southernmost seas.\n\nI hesitated to interrupt him.  But some moments later, when he turned\nto me, I threw back at him a phrase he had used in the Torres Strait:\n\n\"An incident, captain?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" he replied, \"this time an accident.\"\n\n\"Serious?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"Is there any immediate danger?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"The Nautilus has run aground?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And this accident came about . . . ?\"\n\n\"Through nature's unpredictability not man's incapacity.\nNo errors were committed in our maneuvers.  Nevertheless, we can't\nprevent a loss of balance from taking its toll.  One may defy\nhuman laws, but no one can withstand the laws of nature.\"\n\nCaptain Nemo had picked an odd time to philosophize.  All in all,\nthis reply told me nothing.\n\n\"May I learn, sir,\" I asked him, \"what caused this accident?\"\n\n\"An enormous block of ice, an entire mountain, has toppled over,\"\nhe answered me.  \"When an iceberg is eroded at the base by warmer\nwaters or by repeated collisions, its center of gravity rises.\nThen it somersaults, it turns completely upside down.\nThat's what happened here.  When it overturned, one of these\nblocks hit the Nautilus as it was cruising under the waters.\nSliding under our hull, this block then raised us with irresistible power,\nlifting us into less congested strata where we now lie on our side.\"\n\n\"But can't we float the Nautilus clear by emptying its ballast tanks,\nto regain our balance?\"\n\n\"That, sir, is being done right now.  You can hear the pumps working.\nLook at the needle on the pressure gauge.  It indicates that the Nautilus\nis rising, but this block of ice is rising with us, and until some\nobstacle halts its upward movement, our position won't change.\"\n\nIndeed, the Nautilus kept the same heel to starboard.\nNo doubt it would straighten up once the block came to a halt.\nBut before that happened, who knew if we might not hit the underbelly\nof the Ice Bank and be hideously squeezed between two frozen surfaces?\n\nI mused on all the consequences of this situation.  Captain Nemo\ndidn't stop studying the pressure gauge.  Since the toppling\nof this iceberg, the Nautilus had risen about 150 feet, but it\nstill stayed at the same angle to the perpendicular.\n\nSuddenly a slight movement could be felt over the hull.\nObviously the Nautilus was straightening a bit.  Objects hanging\nin the lounge were visibly returning to their normal positions.\nThe walls were approaching the vertical.  Nobody said a word.\nHearts pounding, we could see and feel the ship righting itself.\nThe floor was becoming horizontal beneath our feet.\nTen minutes went by.\n\n\"Finally, we're upright!\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes,\" Captain Nemo said, heading to the lounge door.\n\n\"But will we float off?\"  I asked him.\n\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, \"since the ballast tanks aren't yet empty,\nand when they are, the Nautilus must rise to the surface of the sea.\"\n\nThe captain went out, and soon I saw that at his orders, the Nautilus\nhad halted its upward movement.  In fact, it soon would have hit\nthe underbelly of the Ice Bank, but it had stopped in time and was\nfloating in midwater.\n\n\"That was a close call!\"  Conseil then said.\n\n\"Yes.  We could have been crushed between these masses of ice,\nor at least imprisoned between them.  And then, with no way to renew\nour air supply. . . . Yes, that was a close call!\"\n\n\"If it's over with!\"  Ned Land muttered.\n\nI was unwilling to get into a pointless argument with the Canadian\nand didn't reply.  Moreover, the panels opened just then,\nand the outside light burst through the uncovered windows.\n\nWe were fully afloat, as I have said; but on both sides of the Nautilus,\nabout ten meters away, there rose dazzling walls of ice.\nThere also were walls above and below.  Above, because the\nIce Bank's underbelly spread over us like an immense ceiling.\nBelow, because the somersaulting block, shifting little by little,\nhad found points of purchase on both side walls and had gotten\njammed between them.  The Nautilus was imprisoned in a genuine\ntunnel of ice about twenty meters wide and filled with quiet water.\nSo the ship could easily exit by going either ahead or astern,\nsinking a few hundred meters deeper, and then taking an open\npassageway beneath the Ice Bank.\n\nThe ceiling lights were off, yet the lounge was still brightly lit.\nThis was due to the reflecting power of the walls of ice,\nwhich threw the beams of our beacon right back at us.  Words cannot\ndescribe the effects produced by our galvanic rays on these huge,\nwhimsically sculpted blocks, whose every angle, ridge, and facet gave\noff a different glow depending on the nature of the veins running\ninside the ice.  It was a dazzling mine of gems, in particular\nsapphires and emeralds, whose jets of blue and green crisscrossed.\nHere and there, opaline hues of infinite subtlety raced among sparks\nof light that were like so many fiery diamonds, their brilliance\nmore than any eye could stand.  The power of our beacon was increased\na hundredfold, like a lamp shining through the biconvex lenses\nof a world-class lighthouse.\n\n\"How beautiful!\"  Conseil exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"it's a wonderful sight!  Isn't it, Ned?\"\n\n\"Oh damnation, yes!\"  Ned Land shot back.  \"It's superb!\nI'm furious that I have to admit it.  Nobody has ever seen the like.\nBut this sight could cost us dearly.  And in all honesty, I think\nwe're looking at things God never intended for human eyes.\"\n\nNed was right.  It was too beautiful.  All at once a yell from\nConseil made me turn around.\n\n\"What is it?\"  I asked.\n\n\"Master must close his eyes!  Master mustn't look!\"\n\nWith that, Conseil clapped his hands over his eyes.\n\n\"But what's wrong, my boy?\"\n\n\"I've been dazzled, struck blind!\"\n\nInvoluntarily my eyes flew to the window, but I couldn't stand\nthe fire devouring it.\n\nI realized what had happened.  The Nautilus had just started off\nat great speed.  All the tranquil glimmers of the ice walls had then\nchanged into blazing streaks.  The sparkles from these myriads of\ndiamonds were merging with each other.  Swept along by its propeller,\nthe Nautilus was traveling through a sheath of flashing light.\n\nThen the panels in the lounge closed.  We kept our hands over our eyes,\nwhich were utterly saturated with those concentric gleams that\nswirl before the retina when sunlight strikes it too intensely.\nIt took some time to calm our troubled vision.\n\nFinally we lowered our hands.\n\n\"Ye gods, I never would have believed it,\" Conseil said.\n\n\"And I still don't believe it!\" the Canadian shot back.\n\n\"When we return to shore, jaded from all these natural wonders,\"\nConseil added, \"think how we'll look down on those pitiful land masses,\nthose puny works of man!  No, the civilized world won't be good\nenough for us!\"\n\nSuch words from the lips of this emotionless Flemish boy showed\nthat our enthusiasm was near the boiling point.  But the Canadian\ndidn't fail to throw his dram of cold water over us.\n\n\"The civilized world!\" he said, shaking his head.  \"Don't worry,\nConseil my friend, we're never going back to that world!\"\n\nBy this point it was five o'clock in the morning.\nJust then there was a collision in the Nautilus's bow.\nI realized that its spur had just bumped a block of ice.\nIt must have been a faulty maneuver because this underwater tunnel\nwas obstructed by such blocks and didn't make for easy navigating.\nSo I had assumed that Captain Nemo, in adjusting his course, would go\naround each obstacle or would hug the walls and follow the windings\nof the tunnel.  In either case our forward motion wouldn't receive\nan absolute check.  Nevertheless, contrary to my expectations,\nthe Nautilus definitely began to move backward.\n\n\"We're going astern?\"  Conseil said.\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied.  \"Apparently the tunnel has no way out at this end.\"\n\n\"And so . . . ?\"\n\n\"So,\" I said, \"our maneuvers are quite simple.  We'll return in our\ntracks and go out the southern opening.  That's all.\"\n\nAs I spoke, I tried to sound more confident than I really felt.\nMeanwhile the Nautilus accelerated its backward movement, and running\nwith propeller in reverse, it swept us along at great speed.\n\n\"This'll mean a delay,\" Ned said.\n\n\"What are a few hours more or less, so long as we get out.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Ned Land repeated, \"so long as we get out!\"\n\nI strolled for a little while from the lounge into the library.\nMy companions kept their seats and didn't move.  Soon I threw myself\ndown on a couch and picked up a book, which my eyes skimmed mechanically.\n\nA quarter of an hour later, Conseil approached me, saying:\n\n\"Is it deeply fascinating, this volume master is reading?\"\n\n\"Tremendously fascinating,\" I replied.\n\n\"I believe it.  Master is reading his own book!\"\n\n\"My own book?\"\n\nIndeed, my hands were holding my own work on the great ocean depths.\nI hadn't even suspected.  I closed the book and resumed my strolling.\nNed and Conseil stood up to leave.\n\n\"Stay here, my friends,\" I said, stopping them.  \"Let's stay together\nuntil we're out of this blind alley.\"\n\n\"As master wishes,\" Conseil replied.\n\nThe hours passed.  I often studied the instruments hanging on\nthe lounge wall.  The pressure gauge indicated that the Nautilus\nstayed at a constant depth of 300 meters, the compass that it kept\nheading south, the log that it was traveling at a speed of twenty\nmiles per hour, an excessive speed in such a cramped area.\nBut Captain Nemo knew that by this point there was no such thing\nas too fast, since minutes were now worth centuries.\n\nAt 8:25 a second collision took place.  This time astern.\nI grew pale.  My companions came over.  I clutched Conseil's hand.\nOur eyes questioned each other, and more directly than if our thoughts\nhad been translated into words.\n\nJust then the captain entered the lounge.  I went to him.\n\n\"Our path is barred to the south?\"  I asked him.\n\n\"Yes, sir.  When it overturned, that iceberg closed off every exit.\"\n\n\"We're boxed in?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\nShortage of Air\n\n\nCONSEQUENTLY, above, below, and around the Nautilus, there were\nimpenetrable frozen walls.  We were the Ice Bank's prisoners!\nThe Canadian banged a table with his fearsome fist.  Conseil kept still.\nI stared at the captain.  His face had resumed its usual emotionlessness.\nHe crossed his arms.  He pondered.  The Nautilus did not stir.\n\nThe captain then broke into speech:\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said in a calm voice, \"there are two ways of dying\nunder the conditions in which we're placed.\"\n\nThis inexplicable individual acted like a mathematics professor\nworking out a problem for his pupils.\n\n\"The first way,\" he went on, \"is death by crushing.  The second\nis death by asphyxiation.  I don't mention the possibility of death\nby starvation because the Nautilus's provisions will certainly last\nlonger than we will.  Therefore, let's concentrate on our chances\nof being crushed or asphyxiated.\"\n\n\"As for asphyxiation, captain,\" I replied, \"that isn't a cause\nfor alarm, because the air tanks are full.\"\n\n\"True,\" Captain Nemo went on, \"but they'll supply air for only two days.\nNow then, we've been buried beneath the waters for thirty-six hours,\nand the Nautilus's heavy atmosphere already needs renewing.\nIn another forty-eight hours, our reserve air will be used up.\"\n\n\"Well then, captain, let's free ourselves within forty-eight hours!\"\n\n\"We'll try to at least, by cutting through one of these\nwalls surrounding us.\"\n\n\"Which one?\"  I asked.\n\n\"Borings will tell us that.  I'm going to ground the Nautilus\non the lower shelf, then my men will put on their diving suits\nand attack the thinnest of these ice walls.\"\n\n\"Can the panels in the lounge be left open?\"\n\n\"Without ill effect.  We're no longer in motion.\"\n\nCaptain Nemo went out.  Hissing sounds soon told me that water\nwas being admitted into the ballast tanks.  The Nautilus slowly\nsettled and rested on the icy bottom at a depth of 350 meters,\nthe depth at which the lower shelf of ice lay submerged.\n\n\"My friends,\" I said, \"we're in a serious predicament, but I'm\ncounting on your courage and energy.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" the Canadian replied, \"this is no time to bore you with\nmy complaints.  I'm ready to do anything I can for the common good.\"\n\n\"Excellent, Ned,\" I said, extending my hand to the Canadian.\n\n\"I might add,\" he went on, \"that I'm as handy with a pick as a harpoon.\nIf I can be helpful to the captain, he can use me any way he wants.\"\n\n\"He won't turn down your assistance.  Come along, Ned.\"\n\nI led the Canadian to the room where the Nautilus's men were putting\non their diving suits.  I informed the captain of Ned's proposition,\nwhich was promptly accepted.  The Canadian got into his\nunderwater costume and was ready as soon as his fellow workers.\nEach of them carried on his back a Rouquayrol device that the air\ntanks had supplied with a generous allowance of fresh oxygen.\nA considerable but necessary drain on the Nautilus's reserves.\nAs for the Ruhmkorff lamps, they were unnecessary in the midst\nof these brilliant waters saturated with our electric rays.\n\nAfter Ned was dressed, I reentered the lounge, whose windows had\nbeen uncovered; stationed next to Conseil, I examined the strata\nsurrounding and supporting the Nautilus.\n\nSome moments later, we saw a dozen crewmen set foot on the shelf\nof ice, among them Ned Land, easily recognized by his tall figure.\nCaptain Nemo was with them.\n\nBefore digging into the ice, the captain had to obtain borings,\nto insure working in the best direction.  Long bores were driven into\nthe side walls; but after fifteen meters, the instruments were still\nimpeded by the thickness of those walls.  It was futile to attack\nthe ceiling since that surface was the Ice Bank itself, more than\n400 meters high.  Captain Nemo then bored into the lower surface.\nThere we were separated from the sea by a ten-meter barrier.\nThat's how thick the iceberg was.  From this point on, it was an issue\nof cutting out a piece equal in surface area to the Nautilus's waterline.\nThis meant detaching about 6,500 cubic meters, to dig a hole through\nwhich the ship could descend below this tract of ice.\n\nWork began immediately and was carried on with tireless tenacity.\nInstead of digging all around the Nautilus, which would have\nentailed even greater difficulties, Captain Nemo had an immense\ntrench outlined on the ice, eight meters from our port quarter.\nThen his men simultaneously staked it off at several points around\nits circumference.  Soon their picks were vigorously attacking\nthis compact matter, and huge chunks were loosened from its mass.\nThese chunks weighed less than the water, and by an unusual\neffect of specific gravity, each chunk took wing, as it were,\nto the roof of the tunnel, which thickened above by as much as it\ndiminished below.  But this hardly mattered so long as the lower\nsurface kept growing thinner.\n\nAfter two hours of energetic work, Ned Land reentered, exhausted.\nHe and his companions were replaced by new workmen, including Conseil\nand me.  The Nautilus's chief officer supervised us.\n\nThe water struck me as unusually cold, but I warmed up promptly\nwhile wielding my pick.  My movements were quite free, although they\nwere executed under a pressure of thirty atmospheres.\n\nAfter two hours of work, reentering to snatch some food and rest,\nI found a noticeable difference between the clean elastic fluid\nsupplied me by the Rouquayrol device and the Nautilus's atmosphere,\nwhich was already charged with carbon dioxide.  The air hadn't\nbeen renewed in forty-eight hours, and its life-giving qualities\nwere considerably weakened.  Meanwhile, after twelve hours had\ngone by, we had removed from the outlined surface area a slice\nof ice only one meter thick, hence about 600 cubic meters.\nAssuming the same work would be accomplished every twelve hours,\nit would still take five nights and four days to see the undertaking\nthrough to completion.\n\n\"Five nights and four days!\"  I told my companions.  \"And we have\noxygen in the air tanks for only two days.\"\n\n\"Without taking into account,\" Ned answered, \"that once we're out\nof this damned prison, we'll still be cooped up beneath the Ice Bank,\nwithout any possible contact with the open air!\"\n\nAn apt remark.  For who could predict the minimum time we would need\nto free ourselves?  Before the Nautilus could return to the surface\nof the waves, couldn't we all die of asphyxiation?  Were this\nship and everyone on board doomed to perish in this tomb of ice?\nIt was a dreadful state of affairs.  But we faced it head-on,\neach one of us determined to do his duty to the end.\n\nDuring the night, in line with my forecasts, a new one-meter\nslice was removed from this immense socket.  But in the morning,\nwearing my diving suit, I was crossing through the liquid mass\nin a temperature of -6 degrees to -7 degrees centigrade, when I noted\nthat little by little the side walls were closing in on each other.\nThe liquid strata farthest from the trench, not warmed by the movements\nof workmen and tools, were showing a tendency to solidify.\nIn the face of this imminent new danger, what would happen to our\nchances for salvation, and how could we prevent this liquid medium\nfrom solidifying, then cracking the Nautilus's hull like glass?\n\nI didn't tell my two companions about this new danger.\nThere was no point in dampening the energy they were putting\ninto our arduous rescue work.  But when I returned on board,\nI mentioned this serious complication to Captain Nemo.\n\n\"I know,\" he told me in that calm tone the most dreadful outlook\ncouldn't change.  \"It's one more danger, but I don't know any way\nof warding it off.  Our sole chance for salvation is to work faster\nthan the water solidifies.  We've got to get there first, that's all.\"\n\nGet there first!  By then I should have been used to this type of talk!\n\nFor several hours that day, I wielded my pick doggedly.\nThe work kept me going.  Besides, working meant leaving the Nautilus,\nwhich meant breathing the clean oxygen drawn from the air tanks\nand supplied by our equipment, which meant leaving the thin,\nfoul air behind.\n\nNear evening one more meter had been dug from the trench.\nWhen I returned on board, I was wellnigh asphyxiated by the carbon\ndioxide saturating the air.  Oh, if only we had the chemical\nmethods that would enable us to drive out this noxious gas!\nThere was no lack of oxygen.  All this water contained a considerable\namount, and after it was decomposed by our powerful batteries,\nthis life-giving elastic fluid could have been restored to us.\nI had thought it all out, but to no avail because the carbon dioxide\nproduced by our breathing permeated every part of the ship.\nTo absorb it, we would need to fill containers with potassium\nhydroxide and shake them continually.  But this substance was missing\non board and nothing else could replace it.\n\nThat evening Captain Nemo was forced to open the spigots of his air tanks\nand shoot a few spouts of fresh oxygen through the Nautilus's interior.\nWithout this precaution we wouldn't have awakened the following morning.\n\nThe next day, March 26, I returned to my miner's trade, working to\nremove the fifth meter.  The Ice Bank's side walls and underbelly\nhad visibly thickened.  Obviously they would come together before\nthe Nautilus could break free.  For an instant I was gripped by despair.\nMy pick nearly slipped from my hands.  What was the point of this\ndigging if I was to die smothered and crushed by this water turning\nto stone, a torture undreamed of by even the wildest savages!\nI felt like I was lying in the jaws of a fearsome monster,\njaws irresistibly closing.\n\nSupervising our work, working himself, Captain Nemo passed near me\njust then.  I touched him with my hand and pointed to the walls\nof our prison.  The starboard wall had moved forward to a point\nless than four meters from the Nautilus's hull.\n\nThe captain understood and gave me a signal to follow him.\nWe returned on board.  My diving suit removed, I went with him\nto the lounge.\n\n\"Professor Aronnax,\" he told me, \"this calls for heroic measures,\nor we'll be sealed up in this solidified water as if it were cement.\"\n\n\"Yes!\"  I said.  \"But what can we do?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" he exclaimed, \"if only my Nautilus were strong enough to stand\nthat much pressure without being crushed!\"\n\n\"Well?\"  I asked, not catching the captain's meaning.\n\n\"Don't you understand,\" he went on, \"that the congealing of this\nwater could come to our rescue?  Don't you see that by solidifying,\nit could burst these tracts of ice imprisoning us, just as its freezing\ncan burst the hardest stones?  Aren't you aware that this force could\nbe the instrument of our salvation rather than our destruction?\"\n\n\"Yes, captain, maybe so.  But whatever resistance to crushing\nthe Nautilus may have, it still couldn't stand such dreadful pressures,\nand it would be squashed as flat as a piece of sheet iron.\"\n\n\"I know it, sir.  So we can't rely on nature to rescue us,\nonly our own efforts.  We must counteract this solidification.\nWe must hold it in check.  Not only are the side walls closing in,\nbut there aren't ten feet of water ahead or astern of the Nautilus.\nAll around us, this freeze is gaining fast.\"\n\n\"How long,\" I asked, \"will the oxygen in the air tanks enable us\nto breathe on board?\"\n\nThe captain looked me straight in the eye.\n\n\"After tomorrow,\" he said, \"the air tanks will be empty!\"\n\nI broke out in a cold sweat.  But why should I have been\nstartled by this reply?  On March 22 the Nautilus had dived\nunder the open waters at the pole.  It was now the 26th.\nWe had lived off the ship's stores for five days!\nAnd all remaining breathable air had to be saved for the workmen.\nEven today as I write these lines, my sensations are so intense\nthat an involuntary terror sweeps over me, and my lungs still seem\nshort of air!\n\nMeanwhile, motionless and silent, Captain Nemo stood lost in thought.\nAn idea visibly crossed his mind.  But he seemed to brush it aside.\nHe told himself no.  At last these words escaped his lips:\n\n\"Boiling water!\" he muttered.\n\n\"Boiling water?\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, sir.  We're shut up in a relatively confined area.\nIf the Nautilus's pumps continually injected streams of boiling\nwater into this space, wouldn't that raise its temperature and\ndelay its freezing?\"\n\n\"It's worth trying!\"  I said resolutely.\n\n\"So let's try it, professor.\"\n\nBy then the thermometer gave -7 degrees centigrade outside.\nCaptain Nemo led me to the galley where a huge distilling\nmechanism was at work, supplying drinking water via evaporation.\nThe mechanism was loaded with water, and the full electric\nheat of our batteries was thrown into coils awash in liquid.\nIn a few minutes the water reached 100 degrees centigrade.\nIt was sent to the pumps while new water replaced it in the process.\nThe heat generated by our batteries was so intense that after simply\ngoing through the mechanism, water drawn cold from the sea arrived\nboiling hot at the body of the pump.\n\nThe steaming water was injected into the icy water outside,\nand after three hours had passed, the thermometer gave the exterior\ntemperature as -6 degrees centigrade.  That was one degree gained.\nTwo hours later the thermometer gave only -4 degrees.\n\nAfter I monitored the operation's progress, double-checking it\nwith many inspections, I told the captain, \"It's working.\"\n\n\"I think so,\" he answered me.  \"We've escaped being crushed.\nNow we have only asphyxiation to fear.\"\n\nDuring the night the water temperature rose to -1 degrees centigrade.\nThe injections couldn't get it to go a single degree higher.\nBut since salt water freezes only at -2 degrees, I was finally\nassured that there was no danger of it solidifying.\n\nBy the next day, March 27, six meters of ice had been torn\nfrom the socket.  Only four meters were left to be removed.\nThat still meant forty-eight hours of work.  The air couldn't\nbe renewed in the Nautilus's interior.  Accordingly, that day it\nkept getting worse.\n\nAn unbearable heaviness weighed me down.  Near three o'clock in\nthe afternoon, this agonizing sensation affected me to an intense degree.\nYawns dislocated my jaws.  My lungs were gasping in their quest\nfor that enkindling elastic fluid required for breathing,\nnow growing scarcer and scarcer.  My mind was in a daze.\nI lay outstretched, strength gone, nearly unconscious.\nMy gallant Conseil felt the same symptoms, suffered the same sufferings,\nyet never left my side.  He held my hand, he kept encouraging me,\nand I even heard him mutter:\n\n\"Oh, if only I didn't have to breathe, to leave more air for master!\"\n\nIt brought tears to my eyes to hear him say these words.\n\nSince conditions inside were universally unbearable, how eagerly,\nhow happily, we put on our diving suits to take our turns working!\nPicks rang out on that bed of ice.  Arms grew weary, hands were\nrubbed raw, but who cared about exhaustion, what difference were wounds?\nLife-sustaining air reached our lungs!  We could breathe!\nWe could breathe!\n\nAnd yet nobody prolonged his underwater work beyond the time\nallotted him.  His shift over, each man surrendered to a gasping\ncompanion the air tank that would revive him.  Captain Nemo set\nthe example and was foremost in submitting to this strict discipline.\nWhen his time was up, he yielded his equipment to another and reentered\nthe foul air on board, always calm, unflinching, and uncomplaining.\n\nThat day the usual work was accomplished with even greater energy.\nOver the whole surface area, only two meters were left to be removed.\nOnly two meters separated us from the open sea.  But the ship's air\ntanks were nearly empty.  The little air that remained had to be\nsaved for the workmen.  Not an atom for the Nautilus!\n\nWhen I returned on board, I felt half suffocated.  What a night!\nI'm unable to depict it.  Such sufferings are indescribable.\nThe next day I was short-winded. Headaches and staggering fits of\ndizziness made me reel like a drunk.  My companions were experiencing\nthe same symptoms.  Some crewmen were at their last gasp.\n\nThat day, the sixth of our imprisonment, Captain Nemo concluded\nthat picks and mattocks were too slow to deal with the ice layer still\nseparating us from open water--and he decided to crush this layer.\nThe man had kept his energy and composure.  He had subdued physical\npain with moral strength.  He could still think, plan, and act.\n\nAt his orders the craft was eased off, in other words, it was\nraised from its icy bed by a change in its specific gravity.\nWhen it was afloat, the crew towed it, leading it right above\nthe immense trench outlined to match the ship's waterline.\nNext the ballast tanks filled with water, the boat sank, and was\nfitted into its socket.\n\nJust then the whole crew returned on board, and the double outside\ndoor was closed.  By this point the Nautilus was resting on a bed\nof ice only one meter thick and drilled by bores in a thousand places.\n\nThe stopcocks of the ballast tanks were then opened wide, and 100\ncubic meters of water rushed in, increasing the Nautilus's weight\nby 100,000 kilograms.\n\nWe waited, we listened, we forgot our sufferings, we hoped once more.\nWe had staked our salvation on this one last gamble.\n\nDespite the buzzing in my head, I soon could hear vibrations under the\nNautilus's hull.  We tilted.  The ice cracked with an odd ripping sound,\nlike paper tearing, and the Nautilus began settling downward.\n\n\"We're going through!\"  Conseil muttered in my ear.\n\nI couldn't answer him.  I clutched his hand.  I squeezed it\nin an involuntary convulsion.\n\nAll at once, carried away by its frightful excess load,\nthe Nautilus sank into the waters like a cannonball, in other words,\ndropping as if in a vacuum!\n\nOur full electric power was then put on the pumps,\nwhich instantly began to expel water from the ballast tanks.\nAfter a few minutes we had checked our fall.  The pressure gauge\nsoon indicated an ascending movement.  Brought to full speed,\nthe propeller made the sheet-iron hull tremble down to its rivets,\nand we sped northward.\n\nBut how long would it take to navigate under the Ice Bank to\nthe open sea?  Another day?  I would be dead first!\n\nHalf lying on a couch in the library, I was suffocating.\nMy face was purple, my lips blue, my faculties in abeyance.\nI could no longer see or hear.  I had lost all sense of time.\nMy muscles had no power to contract.\n\nI'm unable to estimate the hours that passed in this way.\nBut I was aware that my death throes had begun.  I realized that I\nwas about to die . . .\n\nSuddenly I regained consciousness.  A few whiffs of air had\nentered my lungs.  Had we risen to the surface of the waves?\nHad we cleared the Ice Bank?\n\nNo!  Ned and Conseil, my two gallant friends, were sacrificing themselves\nto save me.  A few atoms of air were still left in the depths\nof one Rouquayrol device.  Instead of breathing it themselves,\nthey had saved it for me, and while they were suffocating, they poured\nlife into me drop by drop!  I tried to push the device away.\nThey held my hands, and for a few moments I could breathe luxuriously.\n\nMy eyes flew toward the clock.  It was eleven in the morning.\nIt had to be March 28.  The Nautilus was traveling at the frightful\nspeed of forty miles per hour.  It was writhing in the waters.\n\nWhere was Captain Nemo?  Had he perished?  Had his companions\ndied with him?\n\nJust then the pressure gauge indicated we were no more than twenty\nfeet from the surface.  Separating us from the open air was a mere\ntract of ice.  Could we break through it?\n\nPerhaps!  In any event the Nautilus was going to try.  In fact,\nI could feel it assuming an oblique position, lowering its stern\nand raising its spur.  The admission of additional water was enough\nto shift its balance.  Then, driven by its powerful propeller,\nit attacked this ice field from below like a fearsome battering ram.\nIt split the barrier little by little, backing up, then putting\non full speed against the punctured tract of ice; and finally,\ncarried away by its supreme momentum, it lunged through and onto\nthis frozen surface, crushing the ice beneath its weight.\n\nThe hatches were opened--or torn off, if you prefer--and waves\nof clean air were admitted into every part of the Nautilus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\nFrom Cape Horn to the Amazon\n\n\nHOW I GOT ONTO the platform I'm unable to say.\nPerhaps the Canadian transferred me there.  But I could breathe,\nI could inhale the life-giving sea air.  Next to me my two\ncompanions were getting tipsy on the fresh oxygen particles.\nPoor souls who have suffered from long starvation mustn't pounce\nheedlessly on the first food given them.  We, on the other hand,\ndidn't have to practice such moderation:  we could suck the atoms\nfrom the air by the lungful, and it was the breeze, the breeze itself,\nthat poured into us this luxurious intoxication!\n\n\"Ahhh!\"  Conseil was putting in.  \"What fine oxygen!  Let master\nhave no fears about breathing.  There's enough for everyone.\"\n\nAs for Ned Land, he didn't say a word, but his wide-open jaws\nwould have scared off a shark.  And what powerful inhalations!\nThe Canadian \"drew\" like a furnace going full blast.\n\nOur strength returned promptly, and when I looked around,\nI saw that we were alone on the platform.  No crewmen.\nNot even Captain Nemo.  Those strange seamen on the Nautilus\nwere content with the oxygen circulating inside.  Not one of them\nhad come up to enjoy the open air.\n\nThe first words I pronounced were words of appreciation\nand gratitude to my two companions.  Ned and Conseil had kept\nme alive during the final hours of our long death throes.\nBut no expression of thanks could repay them fully for such devotion.\n\n\"Good lord, professor,\" Ned Land answered me, \"don't mention it!\nWhat did we do that's so praiseworthy?  Not a thing.  It was a\nquestion of simple arithmetic.  Your life is worth more than ours.\nSo we had to save it.\"\n\n\"No, Ned,\" I replied, \"it isn't worth more.  Nobody could be better\nthan a kind and generous man like yourself!\"\n\n\"All right, all right!\" the Canadian repeated in embarrassment.\n\n\"And you, my gallant Conseil, you suffered a great deal.\"\n\n\"Not too much, to be candid with master.  I was lacking a few\nthroatfuls of air, but I would have gotten by.  Besides, when I saw\nmaster fainting, it left me without the slightest desire to breathe.\nIt took my breath away, in a manner of . . .\"\n\nConfounded by this lapse into banality, Conseil left his sentence hanging.\n\n\"My friends,\" I replied, very moved, \"we're bound to each other forever,\nand I'm deeply indebted to you--\"\n\n\"Which I'll take advantage of,\" the Canadian shot back.\n\n\"Eh?\"  Conseil put in.\n\n\"Yes,\" Ned Land went on.  \"You can repay your debt by coming with me\nwhen I leave this infernal Nautilus.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" Conseil said, \"are we going in a favorable direction?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"because we're going in the direction of the sun,\nand here the sun is due north.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Ned Land went on, \"but it remains to be seen whether we'll\nmake for the Atlantic or the Pacific, in other words, whether we'll\nend up in well-traveled or deserted seas.\"\n\nI had no reply to this, and I feared that Captain Nemo wouldn't\ntake us homeward but rather into that huge ocean washing the shores\nof both Asia and America.  In this way he would complete his underwater\ntour of the world, going back to those seas where the Nautilus\nenjoyed the greatest freedom.  But if we returned to the Pacific,\nfar from every populated shore, what would happen to Ned Land's plans?\n\nWe would soon settle this important point.  The Nautilus\ntraveled swiftly.  Soon we had cleared the Antarctic Circle\nplus the promontory of Cape Horn.  We were abreast of the tip\nof South America by March 31 at seven o'clock in the evening.\n\nBy then all our past sufferings were forgotten.  The memory\nof that imprisonment under the ice faded from our minds.\nWe had thoughts only of the future.  Captain Nemo no longer appeared,\nneither in the lounge nor on the platform.  The positions reported\neach day on the world map were put there by the chief officer,\nand they enabled me to determine the Nautilus's exact heading.\nNow then, that evening it became obvious, much to my satisfaction,\nthat we were returning north by the Atlantic route.\n\nI shared the results of my observations with the Canadian and Conseil.\n\n\"That's good news,\" the Canadian replied, \"but where's\nthe Nautilus going?\"\n\n\"I'm unable to say, Ned.\"\n\n\"After the South Pole, does our captain want to tackle the North Pole,\nthen go back to the Pacific by the notorious Northwest Passage?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't double dare him,\" Conseil replied.\n\n\"Oh well,\" the Canadian said, \"we'll give him the slip long before then.\"\n\n\"In any event,\" Conseil added, \"he's a superman, that Captain Nemo,\nand we'll never regret having known him.\"\n\n\"Especially once we've left him,\" Ned Land shot back.\n\nThe next day, April 1, when the Nautilus rose to the surface of\nthe waves a few minutes before noon, we raised land to the west.\nIt was Tierra del Fuego, the Land of Fire, a name given it\nby early navigators after they saw numerous curls of smoke rising\nfrom the natives' huts.  This Land of Fire forms a huge cluster\nof islands over thirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide,\nextending between latitude 53 degrees and 56 degrees south,\nand between longitude 67 degrees 50' and 77 degrees 15' west.\nIts coastline looked flat, but high mountains rose in the distance.\nI even thought I glimpsed Mt.  Sarmiento, whose elevation is 2,070\nmeters above sea level:  a pyramid-shaped block of shale with a\nvery sharp summit, which, depending on whether it's clear or veiled\nin vapor, \"predicts fair weather or foul,\" as Ned Land told me.\n\n\"A first-class barometer, my friend.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, a natural barometer that didn't let me down when I\nnavigated the narrows of the Strait of Magellan.\"\n\nJust then its peak appeared before us, standing out distinctly\nagainst the background of the skies.  This forecast fair weather.\nAnd so it proved.\n\nGoing back under the waters, the Nautilus drew near the coast,\ncruising along it for only a few miles.  Through the lounge\nwindows I could see long creepers and gigantic fucus plants,\nbulb-bearing seaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed\na few specimens; with their smooth, viscous filaments, they measured\nas much as 300 meters long; genuine cables more than an inch thick\nand very tough, they're often used as mooring lines for ships.\nAnother weed, known by the name velp and boasting four-foot leaves,\nwas crammed into the coral concretions and carpeted the ocean floor.\nIt served as both nest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans\nand mollusks, for crabs and cuttlefish.  Here seals and otters could\nindulge in a sumptuous meal, mixing meat from fish with vegetables\nfrom the sea, like the English with their Irish stews.\n\nThe Nautilus passed over these lush, luxuriant depths with\ntremendous speed.  Near evening it approached the Falkland Islands,\nwhose rugged summits I recognized the next day.  The sea was of\nmoderate depth.  So not without good reason, I assumed that these\ntwo islands, plus the many islets surrounding them, used to be part\nof the Magellan coastline.  The Falkland Islands were probably\ndiscovered by the famous navigator John Davis, who gave them the name\nDavis Southern Islands.  Later Sir Richard Hawkins called them\nthe Maidenland, after the Blessed Virgin.  Subsequently, at the beginning\nof the 18th century, they were named the Malouines by fishermen\nfrom Saint-Malo in Brittany, then finally dubbed the Falklands\nby the English, to whom they belong today.\n\nIn these waterways our nets brought up fine samples of algae,\nin particular certain fucus plants whose roots were laden with\nthe world's best mussels.  Geese and duck alighted by the dozens\non the platform and soon took their places in the ship's pantry.\nAs for fish, I specifically observed some bony fish belonging\nto the goby genus, especially some gudgeon two decimeters long,\nsprinkled with whitish and yellow spots.\n\nI likewise marveled at the numerous medusas, including the most beautiful\nof their breed, the compass jellyfish, unique to the Falkland seas.\nSome of these jellyfish were shaped like very smooth,\nsemispheric parasols with russet stripes and fringes of twelve\nneat festoons.  Others looked like upside-down baskets from\nwhich wide leaves and long red twigs were gracefully trailing.\nThey swam with quiverings of their four leaflike arms,\nletting the opulent tresses of their tentacles dangle in the drift.\nI wanted to preserve a few specimens of these delicate zoophytes,\nbut they were merely clouds, shadows, illusions, melting and evaporating\noutside their native element.\n\nWhen the last tips of the Falkland Islands had disappeared below\nthe horizon, the Nautilus submerged to a depth between twenty\nand twenty-five meters and went along the South American coast.\nCaptain Nemo didn't put in an appearance.\n\nWe didn't leave these Patagonian waterways until April 3,\nsometimes cruising under the ocean, sometimes on its surface.\nThe Nautilus passed the wide estuary formed by the mouth of the Rio\nde la Plata, and on April 4 we lay abreast of Uruguay, albeit fifty\nmiles out.  Keeping to its northerly heading, it followed the long\nwindings of South America.  By then we had fared 16,000 leagues\nsince coming on board in the seas of Japan.\n\nNear eleven o'clock in the morning, we cut the Tropic of Capricorn\non the 37th meridian, passing well out from Cape Frio.  Much to\nNed Land's displeasure, Captain Nemo had no liking for the neighborhood\nof Brazil's populous shores, because he shot by with dizzying speed.\nNot even the swiftest fish or birds could keep up with us, and the\nnatural curiosities in these seas completely eluded our observation.\n\nThis speed was maintained for several days, and on the evening\nof April 9, we raised South America's easternmost tip,\nCape S\u0103o Roque.  But then the Nautilus veered away again and went\nlooking for the lowest depths of an underwater valley gouged between\nthis cape and Sierra Leone on the coast of Africa.  Abreast of\nthe West Indies, this valley forks into two arms, and to\nthe north it ends in an enormous depression 9,000 meters deep.\nFrom this locality to the Lesser Antilles, the ocean's geologic\nprofile features a steeply cut cliff six kilometers high, and abreast\nof the Cape Verde Islands, there's another wall just as imposing;\ntogether these two barricades confine the whole submerged continent\nof Atlantis.  The floor of this immense valley is made picturesque\nby mountains that furnish these underwater depths with scenic views.\nThis description is based mostly on certain hand-drawn charts kept\nin the Nautilus's library, charts obviously rendered by Captain Nemo\nhimself from his own personal observations.\n\nFor two days we visited these deep and deserted waters by means\nof our slanting fins.  The Nautilus would do long, diagonal dives\nthat took us to every level.  But on April 11 it rose suddenly,\nand the shore reappeared at the mouth of the Amazon River,\na huge estuary whose outflow is so considerable, it desalts the sea\nover an area of several leagues.\n\nWe cut the Equator.  Twenty miles to the west lay Guiana, French\nterritory where we could easily have taken refuge.\nBut the wind was blowing a strong gust, and the furious\nbillows would not allow us to face them in a mere skiff.\nNo doubt Ned Land understood this because he said nothing to me.\nFor my part, I made no allusion to his escape plans because I didn't\nwant to push him into an attempt that was certain to misfire.\n\nI was readily compensated for this delay by fascinating research.\nDuring those two days of April 11-12, the Nautilus didn't leave\nthe surface of the sea, and its trawl brought up a simply miraculous\ncatch of zoophytes, fish, and reptiles.\n\nSome zoophytes were dredged up by the chain of our trawl.  Most were\nlovely sea anemone belonging to the family Actinidia, including among\nother species, the Phyctalis protexta, native to this part of the ocean:\na small cylindrical trunk adorned with vertical lines, mottled with\nred spots, and crowned by a wondrous blossoming of tentacles.\nAs for mollusks, they consisted of exhibits I had already observed:\nturret snails, olive shells of the \"tent olive\" species with neatly\nintersecting lines and russet spots standing out sharply against\na flesh-colored background, fanciful spider conchs that looked\nlike petrified scorpions, transparent glass snails, argonauts,\nsome highly edible cuttlefish, and certain species of squid\nthat the naturalists of antiquity classified with the flying fish,\nwhich are used chiefly as bait for catching cod.\n\nAs for the fish in these waterways, I noted various species that I\nhadn't yet had the opportunity to study.  Among cartilaginous fish:\nsome brook lamprey, a type of eel fifteen inches long, head greenish,\nfins violet, back bluish gray, belly a silvery brown strewn with\nbright spots, iris of the eye encircled in gold, unusual animals\nthat the Amazon's current must have swept out to sea because their\nnatural habitat is fresh water; sting rays, the snout pointed,\nthe tail long, slender, and armed with an extensive jagged sting;\nsmall one-meter sharks with gray and whitish hides, their teeth\narranged in several backward-curving rows, fish commonly known\nby the name carpet shark; batfish, a sort of reddish isosceles\ntriangle half a meter long, whose pectoral fins are attached\nby fleshy extensions that make these fish look like bats,\nalthough an appendage made of horn, located near the nostrils,\nearns them the nickname of sea unicorns; lastly, a couple species\nof triggerfish, the cucuyo whose stippled flanks glitter with a\nsparkling gold color, and the bright purple leatherjacket whose\nhues glisten like a pigeon's throat.\n\nI'll finish up this catalog, a little dry but quite accurate,\nwith the series of bony fish I observed:  eels belonging to the genus\nApteronotus whose snow-white snout is very blunt, the body painted\na handsome black and armed with a very long, slender, fleshy whip;\nlong sardines from the genus Odontognathus, like three-decimeter pike,\nshining with a bright silver glow; Guaranian mackerel furnished with two\nanal fins; black-tinted rudderfish that you catch by using torches,\nfish measuring two meters and boasting white, firm, plump meat that,\nwhen fresh, tastes like eel, when dried, like smoked salmon;\nsemired wrasse sporting scales only at the bases of their dorsal\nand anal fins; grunts on which gold and silver mingle their luster\nwith that of ruby and topaz; yellow-tailed gilthead whose flesh\nis extremely dainty and whose phosphorescent properties give\nthem away in the midst of the waters; porgies tinted orange,\nwith slender tongues; croakers with gold caudal fins; black surgeonfish;\nfour-eyed fish from Surinam, etc.\n\nThis \"et cetera\" won't keep me from mentioning one more fish\nthat Conseil, with good reason, will long remember.\n\nOne of our nets had hauled up a type of very flat ray that weighed\nsome twenty kilograms; with its tail cut off, it would have formed\na perfect disk.  It was white underneath and reddish on top, with big\nround spots of deep blue encircled in black, its hide quite smooth\nand ending in a double-lobed fin.  Laid out on the platform, it kept\nstruggling with convulsive movements, trying to turn over, making such\nefforts that its final lunge was about to flip it into the sea.\nBut Conseil, being very possessive of his fish, rushed at it,\nand before I could stop him, he seized it with both hands.\n\nInstantly there he was, thrown on his back, legs in the air,\nhis body half paralyzed, and yelling:\n\n\"Oh, sir, sir!  Will you help me!\"\n\nFor once in his life, the poor lad didn't address me \"in\nthe third person.\"\n\nThe Canadian and I sat him up; we massaged his contracted arms,\nand when he regained his five senses, that eternal classifier\nmumbled in a broken voice:\n\n\"Class of cartilaginous fish, order Chondropterygia with fixed gills,\nsuborder Selacia, family Rajiiforma, genus electric ray.\"\n\n\"Yes, my friend,\" I answered, \"it was an electric ray that put you\nin this deplorable state.\"\n\n\"Oh, master can trust me on this,\" Conseil shot back.\n\"I'll be revenged on that animal!\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I'll eat it.\"\n\nWhich he did that same evening, but strictly as retaliation.\nBecause, frankly, it tasted like leather.\n\nPoor Conseil had assaulted an electric ray of the most dangerous species,\nthe cumana.  Living in a conducting medium such as water, this bizarre\nanimal can electrocute other fish from several meters away,\nso great is the power of its electric organ, an organ whose two chief\nsurfaces measure at least twenty-seven square feet.\n\nDuring the course of the next day, April 12, the Nautilus drew near the\ncoast of Dutch Guiana, by the mouth of the Maroni River.  There several\ngroups of sea cows were living in family units.  These were manatees,\nwhich belong to the order Sirenia, like the dugong and Steller's sea cow.\nHarmless and unaggressive, these fine animals were six to seven\nmeters long and must have weighed at least 4,000 kilograms each.\nI told Ned Land and Conseil that farseeing nature had given these\nmammals a major role to play.  In essence, manatees, like seals,\nare designed to graze the underwater prairies, destroying the clusters\nof weeds that obstruct the mouths of tropical rivers.\n\n\"And do you know,\" I added, \"what happened since man has\nalmost completely wiped out these beneficial races?\nRotting weeds have poisoned the air, and this poisoned air causes\nthe yellow fever that devastates these wonderful countries.\nThis toxic vegetation has increased beneath the seas of the Torrid Zone,\nso the disease spreads unchecked from the mouth of the Rio de la\nPlata to Florida!\"\n\nAnd if Professor Toussenel is correct, this plague is nothing\ncompared to the scourge that will strike our descendants\nonce the seas are depopulated of whales and seals.  By then,\ncrowded with jellyfish, squid, and other devilfish, the oceans\nwill have become huge centers of infection, because their waves\nwill no longer possess \"these huge stomachs that God has entrusted\nwith scouring the surface of the sea.\"\n\nMeanwhile, without scorning these theories, the Nautilus's crew captured\nhalf a dozen manatees.  In essence, it was an issue of stocking\nthe larder with excellent red meat, even better than beef or veal.\nTheir hunting was not a fascinating sport.  The manatees let\nthemselves be struck down without offering any resistance.\nSeveral thousand kilos of meat were hauled below, to be dried and stored.\n\nThe same day an odd fishing practice further increased\nthe Nautilus's stores, so full of game were these seas.\nOur trawl brought up in its meshes a number of fish whose heads were\ntopped by little oval slabs with fleshy edges.  These were suckerfish\nfrom the third family of the subbrachian Malacopterygia.  These flat\ndisks on their heads consist of crosswise plates of movable cartilage,\nbetween which the animals can create a vacuum, enabling them to stick\nto objects like suction cups.\n\nThe remoras I had observed in the Mediterranean were related to\nthis species.  But the creature at issue here was an Echeneis osteochara,\nunique to this sea.  Right after catching them, our seamen dropped\nthem in buckets of water.\n\nIts fishing finished, the Nautilus drew nearer to the coast.\nIn this locality a number of sea turtles were sleeping on the surface\nof the waves.  It would have been difficult to capture these\nvaluable reptiles, because they wake up at the slightest sound,\nand their solid carapaces are harpoon-proof. But our suckerfish would\neffect their capture with extraordinary certainty and precision.\nIn truth, this animal is a living fishhook, promising wealth\nand happiness to the greenest fisherman in the business.\n\nThe Nautilus's men attached to each fish's tail a ring that was big\nenough not to hamper its movements, and to this ring a long rope\nwhose other end was moored on board.\n\nThrown into the sea, the suckerfish immediately began to play their roles,\ngoing and fastening themselves onto the breastplates of the turtles.\nTheir tenacity was so great, they would rip apart rather than let go.\nThey were hauled in, still sticking to the turtles that came\naboard with them.\n\nIn this way we caught several loggerheads, reptiles a meter\nwide and weighing 200 kilos.  They're extremely valuable\nbecause of their carapaces, which are covered with big slabs\nof horn, thin, brown, transparent, with white and yellow markings.\nBesides, they were excellent from an edible viewpoint, with an\nexquisite flavor comparable to the green turtle.\n\nThis fishing ended our stay in the waterways of the Amazon,\nand that evening the Nautilus took to the high seas once more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\nThe Devilfish\n\n\nFOR SOME DAYS the Nautilus kept veering away from the American coast.\nIt obviously didn't want to frequent the waves of the Gulf of Mexico\nor the Caribbean Sea.  Yet there was no shortage of water under\nits keel, since the average depth of these seas is 1,800 meters;\nbut these waterways, strewn with islands and plowed by steamers,\nprobably didn't agree with Captain Nemo.\n\nOn April 16 we raised Martinique and Guadalupe from a distance of\nabout thirty miles.  For one instant I could see their lofty peaks.\n\nThe Canadian was quite disheartened, having counted on putting\nhis plans into execution in the gulf, either by reaching shore\nor by pulling alongside one of the many boats plying a coastal trade\nfrom one island to another.  An escape attempt would have been\nquite feasible, assuming Ned Land managed to seize the skiff without\nthe captain's knowledge.  But in midocean it was unthinkable.\n\nThe Canadian, Conseil, and I had a pretty long conversation on\nthis subject.  For six months we had been prisoners aboard the Nautilus.\nWe had fared 17,000 leagues, and as Ned Land put it, there was no\nend in sight.  So he made me a proposition I hadn't anticipated.\nWe were to ask Captain Nemo this question straight out:\ndid the captain mean to keep us on board his vessel permanently?\n\nThis measure was distasteful to me.  To my mind it would lead nowhere.\nWe could hope for nothing from the Nautilus's commander\nbut could depend only on ourselves.  Besides, for some time\nnow the man had been gloomier, more withdrawn, less sociable.\nHe seemed to be avoiding me.  I encountered him only at rare intervals.\nHe used to take pleasure in explaining the underwater wonders to me;\nnow he left me to my research and no longer entered the lounge.\n\nWhat changes had come over him?  From what cause?  I had no reason\nto blame myself.  Was our presence on board perhaps a burden to him?\nEven so, I cherished no hopes that the man would set us free.\n\nSo I begged Ned to let me think about it before taking action.  If this\nmeasure proved fruitless, it could arouse the captain's suspicions, make\nour circumstances even more arduous, and jeopardize the Canadian's plans.\nI might add that I could hardly use our state of health as an argument.\nExcept for that grueling ordeal under the Ice Bank at the South Pole,\nwe had never felt better, neither Ned, Conseil, nor I. The\nnutritious food, life-giving air, regular routine, and uniform\ntemperature kept illness at bay; and for a man who didn't miss his\npast existence on land, for a Captain Nemo who was at home here,\nwho went where he wished, who took paths mysterious to others if not\nhimself in attaining his ends, I could understand such a life.\nBut we ourselves hadn't severed all ties with humanity.  For my part,\nI didn't want my new and unusual research to be buried with my bones.\nI had now earned the right to pen the definitive book on the sea,\nand sooner or later I wanted that book to see the light of day.\n\nThere once more, through the panels opening into these Caribbean\nwaters ten meters below the surface of the waves, I found\nso many fascinating exhibits to describe in my daily notes!\nAmong other zoophytes there were Portuguese men-of-war known by the name\nPhysalia pelagica, like big, oblong bladders with a pearly sheen,\nspreading their membranes to the wind, letting their blue tentacles\ndrift like silken threads; to the eye delightful jellyfish,\nto the touch actual nettles that ooze a corrosive liquid.\nAmong the articulates there were annelid worms one and a half\nmeters long, furnished with a pink proboscis, equipped with 1,700\norgans of locomotion, snaking through the waters, and as they went,\nthrowing off every gleam in the solar spectrum.  From the fish\nbranch there were manta rays, enormous cartilaginous fish ten\nfeet long and weighing 600 pounds, their pectoral fin triangular,\ntheir midback slightly arched, their eyes attached to the edges\nof the face at the front of the head; they floated like wreckage from\na ship, sometimes fastening onto our windows like opaque shutters.\nThere were American triggerfish for which nature has ground only black\nand white pigments, feather-shaped gobies that were long and plump\nwith yellow fins and jutting jaws, sixteen-decimeter mackerel\nwith short, sharp teeth, covered with small scales, and related\nto the albacore species.  Next came swarms of red mullet corseted\nin gold stripes from head to tail, their shining fins all aquiver,\ngenuine masterpieces of jewelry, formerly sacred to the goddess Diana,\nmuch in demand by rich Romans, and about which the old saying goes:\n\"He who catches them doesn't eat them!\"  Finally, adorned with\nemerald ribbons and dressed in velvet and silk, golden angelfish\npassed before our eyes like courtiers in the paintings of Veronese;\nspurred gilthead stole by with their swift thoracic fins; thread herring\nfifteen inches long were wrapped in their phosphorescent glimmers;\ngray mullet thrashed the sea with their big fleshy tails;\nred salmon seemed to mow the waves with their slicing pectorals;\nand silver moonfish, worthy of their name, rose on the horizon\nof the waters like the whitish reflections of many moons.\n\nHow many other marvelous new specimens I still could have observed if,\nlittle by little, the Nautilus hadn't settled to the lower strata!\nIts slanting fins drew it to depths of 2,000 and 3,500 meters.\nThere animal life was represented by nothing more than sea lilies,\nstarfish, delightful crinoids with bell-shaped heads like little\nchalices on straight stems, top-shell snails, blood-red tooth shells,\nand fissurella snails, a large species of coastal mollusk.\n\nBy April 20 we had risen to an average level of 1,500 meters.\nThe nearest land was the island group of the Bahamas, scattered\nlike a batch of cobblestones over the surface of the water.\nThere high underwater cliffs reared up, straight walls made of craggy\nchunks arranged like big stone foundations, among which there\ngaped black caves so deep our electric rays couldn't light them\nto the far ends.\n\nThese rocks were hung with huge weeds, immense sea tangle, gigantic fucus--\na genuine trellis of water plants fit for a world of giants.\n\nIn discussing these colossal plants, Conseil, Ned, and I were naturally\nled into mentioning the sea's gigantic animals.  The former were\nobviously meant to feed the latter.  However, through the windows\nof our almost motionless Nautilus, I could see nothing among these long\nfilaments other than the chief articulates of the division Brachyura:\nlong-legged spider crabs, violet crabs, and sponge crabs unique\nto the waters of the Caribbean.\n\nIt was about eleven o'clock when Ned Land drew my attention to a\nfearsome commotion out in this huge seaweed.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"these are real devilfish caverns, and I wouldn't\nbe surprised to see some of those monsters hereabouts.\"\n\n\"What!\"  Conseil put in.  \"Squid, ordinary squid from\nthe class Cephalopoda?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"devilfish of large dimensions.  But friend Land\nis no doubt mistaken, because I don't see a thing.\"\n\n\"That's regrettable,\" Conseil answered.  \"I'd like to come face\nto face with one of those devilfish I've heard so much about,\nwhich can drag ships down into the depths.  Those beasts go\nby the name of krake--\"\n\n\"Fake is more like it,\" the Canadian replied sarcastically.\n\n\"Krakens!\"  Conseil shot back, finishing his word without wincing\nat his companion's witticism.\n\n\"Nobody will ever make me believe,\" Ned Land said, \"that\nsuch animals exist.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"  Conseil replied.  \"We sincerely believed\nin master's narwhale.\"\n\n\"We were wrong, Conseil.\"\n\n\"No doubt, but there are others with no doubts who believe\nto this day!\"\n\n\"Probably, Conseil.  But as for me, I'm bound and determined not\nto accept the existence of any such monster till I've dissected it\nwith my own two hands.\"\n\n\"Yet,\" Conseil asked me, \"doesn't master believe in gigantic devilfish?\"\n\n\"Yikes!  Who in Hades ever believed in them?\" the Canadian exclaimed.\n\n\"Many people, Ned my friend,\" I said.\n\n\"No fishermen.  Scientists maybe!\"\n\n\"Pardon me, Ned.  Fishermen and scientists!\"\n\n\"Why, I to whom you speak,\" Conseil said with the world's\nstraightest face, \"I recall perfectly seeing a large boat dragged\nunder the waves by the arms of a cephalopod.\"\n\n\"You saw that?\" the Canadian asked.\n\n\"Yes, Ned.\"\n\n\"With your own two eyes?\"\n\n\"With my own two eyes.\"\n\n\"Where, may I ask?\"\n\n\"In Saint-Malo,\" Conseil returned unflappably.\n\n\"In the harbor?\"  Ned Land said sarcastically.\n\n\"No, in a church,\" Conseil replied.\n\n\"In a church!\" the Canadian exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, Ned my friend.  It had a picture that portrayed the\ndevilfish in question.\"\n\n\"Oh good!\"  Ned Land exclaimed with a burst of laughter.\n\"Mr. Conseil put one over on me!\"\n\n\"Actually he's right,\" I said.  \"I've heard about that picture.\nBut the subject it portrays is taken from a legend, and you know\nhow to rate legends in matters of natural history!  Besides, when it's\nan issue of monsters, the human imagination always tends to run wild.\nPeople not only claimed these devilfish could drag ships under,\nbut a certain Olaus Magnus tells of a cephalopod a mile long that looked\nmore like an island than an animal.  There's also the story of how\nthe Bishop of Trondheim set up an altar one day on an immense rock.\nAfter he finished saying mass, this rock started moving and went\nback into the sea.  The rock was a devilfish.\"\n\n\"And that's everything we know?\" the Canadian asked.\n\n\"No,\" I replied, \"another bishop, Pontoppidan of Bergen,\nalso tells of a devilfish so large a whole cavalry regiment could\nmaneuver on it.\"\n\n\"They sure did go on, those oldtime bishops!\"  Ned Land said.\n\n\"Finally, the naturalists of antiquity mention some monsters\nwith mouths as big as a gulf, which were too huge to get through\nthe Strait of Gibraltar.\"\n\n\"Good work, men!\" the Canadian put in.\n\n\"But in all these stories, is there any truth?\"  Conseil asked.\n\n\"None at all, my friends, at least in those that go beyond the bounds\nof credibility and fly off into fable or legend.  Yet for the imaginings\nof these storytellers there had to be, if not a cause, at least\nan excuse.  It can't be denied that some species of squid and other\ndevilfish are quite large, though still smaller than cetaceans.\nAristotle put the dimensions of one squid at five cubits, or 3.1 meters.\nOur fishermen frequently see specimens over 1.8 meters long.\nThe museums in Trieste and Montpellier have preserved some devilfish\ncarcasses measuring two meters.  Besides, according to the calculations\nof naturalists, one of these animals only six feet long would\nhave tentacles as long as twenty-seven. Which is enough to make\na fearsome monster.\"\n\n\"Does anybody fish for 'em nowadays?\" the Canadian asked.\n\n\"If they don't fish for them, sailors at least sight them.\nA friend of mine, Captain Paul Bos of Le Havre, has often sworn\nto me that he encountered one of these monsters of colossal size\nin the seas of the East Indies.  But the most astonishing event,\nwhich proves that these gigantic animals undeniably exist,\ntook place a few years ago in 1861.\"\n\n\"What event was that?\"  Ned Land asked.\n\n\"Just this.  In 1861, to the northeast of Tenerife and fairly\nnear the latitude where we are right now, the crew of the gunboat\nAlecto spotted a monstrous squid swimming in their waters.\nCommander Bouguer approached the animal and attacked it with blows\nfrom harpoons and blasts from rifles, but without much success\nbecause bullets and harpoons crossed its soft flesh as if it\nwere semiliquid jelly.  After several fruitless attempts,\nthe crew managed to slip a noose around the mollusk's body.\nThis noose slid as far as the caudal fins and came to a halt.\nThen they tried to haul the monster on board, but its weight\nwas so considerable that when they tugged on the rope, the animal\nparted company with its tail; and deprived of this adornment,\nit disappeared beneath the waters.\"\n\n\"Finally, an actual event,\" Ned Land said.\n\n\"An indisputable event, my gallant Ned.  Accordingly, people have\nproposed naming this devilfish Bouguer's Squid.\"\n\n\"And how long was it?\" the Canadian asked.\n\n\"Didn't it measure about six meters?\" said Conseil, who was stationed\nat the window and examining anew the crevices in the cliff.\n\n\"Precisely,\" I replied.\n\n\"Wasn't its head,\" Conseil went on, \"crowned by eight tentacles\nthat quivered in the water like a nest of snakes?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"Weren't its eyes prominently placed and considerably enlarged?\"\n\n\"Yes, Conseil.\"\n\n\"And wasn't its mouth a real parrot's beak but of fearsome size?\"\n\n\"Correct, Conseil.\"\n\n\"Well, with all due respect to master,\" Conseil replied serenely,\n\"if this isn't Bouguer's Squid, it's at least one of his close relatives!\"\n\nI stared at Conseil.  Ned Land rushed to the window.\n\n\"What an awful animal!\" he exclaimed.\n\nI stared in my turn and couldn't keep back a movement of revulsion.\nBefore my eyes there quivered a horrible monster worthy of a place\namong the most farfetched teratological legends.\n\nIt was a squid of colossal dimensions, fully eight meters long.\nIt was traveling backward with tremendous speed in the same direction\nas the Nautilus.  It gazed with enormous, staring eyes that were tinted\nsea green.  Its eight arms (or more accurately, feet) were rooted\nin its head, which has earned these animals the name cephalopod;\nits arms stretched a distance twice the length of its body and\nwere writhing like the serpentine hair of the Furies.  You could\nplainly see its 250 suckers, arranged over the inner sides\nof its tentacles and shaped like semispheric capsules.\nSometimes these suckers fastened onto the lounge window by creating\nvacuums against it.  The monster's mouth--a beak made of horn\nand shaped like that of a parrot--opened and closed vertically.\nIts tongue, also of horn substance and armed with several rows\nof sharp teeth, would flicker out from between these genuine shears.\nWhat a freak of nature!  A bird's beak on a mollusk!\nIts body was spindle-shaped and swollen in the middle,\na fleshy mass that must have weighed 20,000 to 25,000 kilograms.\nIts unstable color would change with tremendous speed as the animal\ngrew irritated, passing successively from bluish gray to reddish brown.\n\nWhat was irritating this mollusk?  No doubt the presence\nof the Nautilus, even more fearsome than itself, and which it\ncouldn't grip with its mandibles or the suckers on its arms.\nAnd yet what monsters these devilfish are, what vitality our Creator\nhas given them, what vigor in their movements, thanks to their owning\na triple heart!\n\nSheer chance had placed us in the presence of this squid, and I\ndidn't want to lose this opportunity to meticulously study such\na cephalopod specimen.  I overcame the horror that its appearance\ninspired in me, picked up a pencil, and began to sketch it.\n\n\"Perhaps this is the same as the Alecto's,\" Conseil said.\n\n\"Can't be,\" the Canadian replied, \"because this one's complete\nwhile the other one lost its tail!\"\n\n\"That doesn't necessarily follow,\" I said.  \"The arms and tails\nof these animals grow back through regeneration, and in seven years\nthe tail on Bouguer's Squid has surely had time to sprout again.\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" Ned shot back, \"if it isn't this fellow, maybe it's\none of those!\"\n\nIndeed, other devilfish had appeared at the starboard window.\nI counted seven of them.  They provided the Nautilus with an escort,\nand I could hear their beaks gnashing on the sheet-iron hull.\nWe couldn't have asked for a more devoted following.\n\nI continued sketching.  These monsters kept pace in our waters\nwith such precision, they seemed to be standing still, and I\ncould have traced their outlines in miniature on the window.\nBut we were moving at a moderate speed.\n\nAll at once the Nautilus stopped.  A jolt made it tremble through\nits entire framework.\n\n\"Did we strike bottom?\"  I asked.\n\n\"In any event we're already clear,\" the Canadian replied,\n\"because we're afloat.\"\n\nThe Nautilus was certainly afloat, but it was no longer in motion.\nThe blades of its propeller weren't churning the waves.  A minute passed.\nFollowed by his chief officer, Captain Nemo entered the lounge.\n\nI hadn't seen him for a good while.  He looked gloomy to me.\nWithout speaking to us, without even seeing us perhaps, he went\nto the panel, stared at the devilfish, and said a few words\nto his chief officer.\n\nThe latter went out.  Soon the panels closed.  The ceiling lit up.\n\nI went over to the captain.\n\n\"An unusual assortment of devilfish,\" I told him, as carefree\nas a collector in front of an aquarium.\n\n\"Correct, Mr. Naturalist,\" he answered me, \"and we're going to fight\nthem at close quarters.\"\n\nI gaped at the captain.  I thought my hearing had gone bad.\n\n\"At close quarters?\"  I repeated.\n\n\"Yes, sir.  Our propeller is jammed.  I think the horn-covered\nmandibles of one of these squid are entangled in the blades.\nThat's why we aren't moving.\"\n\n\"And what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Rise to the surface and slaughter the vermin.\"\n\n\"A difficult undertaking.\"\n\n\"Correct.  Our electric bullets are ineffective against such\nsoft flesh, where they don't meet enough resistance to go off.\nBut we'll attack the beasts with axes.\"\n\n\"And harpoons, sir,\" the Canadian said, \"if you don't turn\ndown my help.\"\n\n\"I accept it, Mr. Land.\"\n\n\"We'll go with you,\" I said.  And we followed Captain Nemo,\nheading to the central companionway.\n\nThere some ten men were standing by for the assault,\narmed with boarding axes.  Conseil and I picked up two more axes.\nNed Land seized a harpoon.\n\nBy then the Nautilus had returned to the surface of the waves.\nStationed on the top steps, one of the seamen undid the bolts\nof the hatch.  But he had scarcely unscrewed the nuts when the hatch\nflew up with tremendous violence, obviously pulled open by the suckers\non a devilfish's arm.\n\nInstantly one of those long arms glided like a snake into the opening,\nand twenty others were quivering above.  With a sweep of the ax,\nCaptain Nemo chopped off this fearsome tentacle, which slid writhing\ndown the steps.\n\nJust as we were crowding each other to reach the platform, two more arms\nlashed the air, swooped on the seaman stationed in front of Captain Nemo,\nand carried the fellow away with irresistible violence.\n\nCaptain Nemo gave a shout and leaped outside.  We rushed after him.\n\nWhat a scene!  Seized by the tentacle and glued to its suckers,\nthe unfortunate man was swinging in the air at the mercy\nof this enormous appendage.  He gasped, he choked, he yelled:\n\"Help!  Help!\"  These words, pronounced in French, left me deeply stunned!\nSo I had a fellow countryman on board, perhaps several!\nI'll hear his harrowing plea the rest of my life!\n\nThe poor fellow was done for.  Who could tear him from such\na powerful grip?  Even so, Captain Nemo rushed at the devilfish\nand with a sweep of the ax hewed one more of its arms.\nHis chief officer struggled furiously with other monsters crawling\nup the Nautilus's sides.  The crew battled with flailing axes.\nThe Canadian, Conseil, and I sank our weapons into these fleshy masses.\nAn intense, musky odor filled the air.  It was horrible.\n\nFor an instant I thought the poor man entwined by the devilfish\nmight be torn loose from its powerful suction.  Seven arms out of\neight had been chopped off.  Brandishing its victim like a feather,\none lone tentacle was writhing in the air.  But just as Captain Nemo\nand his chief officer rushed at it, the animal shot off a spout\nof blackish liquid, secreted by a pouch located in its abdomen.\nIt blinded us.  When this cloud had dispersed, the squid was gone,\nand so was my poor fellow countryman!\n\nWhat rage then drove us against these monsters!  We lost all self-control.\nTen or twelve devilfish had overrun the Nautilus's platform and sides.\nWe piled helter-skelter into the thick of these sawed-off snakes,\nwhich darted over the platform amid waves of blood and sepia ink.\nIt seemed as if these viscous tentacles grew back like the many heads\nof Hydra.  At every thrust Ned Land's harpoon would plunge into\na squid's sea-green eye and burst it.  But my daring companion was\nsuddenly toppled by the tentacles of a monster he could not avoid.\n\nOh, my heart nearly exploded with excitement and horror!\nThe squid's fearsome beak was wide open over Ned Land.  The poor\nman was about to be cut in half.  I ran to his rescue.\nBut Captain Nemo got there first.  His ax disappeared between the two\nenormous mandibles, and the Canadian, miraculously saved, stood and\nplunged his harpoon all the way into the devilfish's triple heart.\n\n\"Tit for tat,\" Captain Nemo told the Canadian.  \"I owed it to myself!\"\n\nNed bowed without answering him.\n\nThis struggle had lasted a quarter of an hour.  Defeated, mutilated,\nbattered to death, the monsters finally yielded to us and disappeared\nbeneath the waves.\n\nRed with blood, motionless by the beacon, Captain Nemo stared at\nthe sea that had swallowed one of his companions, and large tears\nstreamed from his eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\nThe Gulf Stream\n\n\nTHIS DREADFUL SCENE on April 20 none of us will ever be able to forget.\nI wrote it up in a state of intense excitement.  Later I reviewed\nmy narrative.  I read it to Conseil and the Canadian.  They found it\naccurate in detail but deficient in impact.  To convey such sights,\nit would take the pen of our most famous poet, Victor Hugo,\nauthor of The Toilers of the Sea.\n\nAs I said, Captain Nemo wept while staring at the waves.\nHis grief was immense.  This was the second companion he had\nlost since we had come aboard.  And what a way to die!\nSmashed, strangled, crushed by the fearsome arms of a devilfish,\nground between its iron mandibles, this friend would never rest\nwith his companions in the placid waters of their coral cemetery!\n\nAs for me, what had harrowed my heart in the thick of this\nstruggle was the despairing yell given by this unfortunate man.\nForgetting his regulation language, this poor Frenchman had reverted\nto speaking his own mother tongue to fling out one supreme plea!\nAmong the Nautilus's crew, allied body and soul with Captain Nemo and\nlikewise fleeing from human contact, I had found a fellow countryman!\nWas he the only representative of France in this mysterious alliance,\nobviously made up of individuals from different nationalities?\nThis was just one more of those insoluble problems that kept welling\nup in my mind!\n\nCaptain Nemo reentered his stateroom, and I saw no more of him\nfor a good while.  But how sad, despairing, and irresolute he must\nhave felt, to judge from this ship whose soul he was, which reflected\nhis every mood!  The Nautilus no longer kept to a fixed heading.\nIt drifted back and forth, riding with the waves like a corpse.\nIts propeller had been disentangled but was barely put to use.\nIt was navigating at random.  It couldn't tear itself away from\nthe setting of this last struggle, from this sea that had devoured\none of its own!\n\nTen days went by in this way.  It was only on May 1 that the Nautilus\nopenly resumed its northbound course, after raising the Bahamas at\nthe mouth of Old Bahama Channel.  We then went with the current of the\nsea's greatest river, which has its own banks, fish, and temperature.\nI mean the Gulf Stream.\n\nIt is indeed a river that runs independently through the middle\nof the Atlantic, its waters never mixing with the ocean's waters.\nIt's a salty river, saltier than the sea surrounding it.\nIts average depth is 3,000 feet, its average width sixty miles.\nIn certain localities its current moves at a speed of four kilometers\nper hour.  The unchanging volume of its waters is greater than\nthat of all the world's rivers combined.\n\nAs discovered by Commander Maury, the true source of the Gulf Stream,\nits starting point, if you prefer, is located in the Bay\nof Biscay.  There its waters, still weak in temperature and color,\nbegin to form.  It goes down south, skirts equatorial Africa,\nwarms its waves in the rays of the Torrid Zone, crosses the Atlantic,\nreaches Cape S\u0103o Roque on the coast of Brazil, and forks into\ntwo branches, one going to the Caribbean Sea for further saturation\nwith heat particles.  Then, entrusted with restoring the balance\nbetween hot and cold temperatures and with mixing tropical and\nnorthern waters, the Gulf Stream begins to play its stabilizing role.\nAttaining a white heat in the Gulf of Mexico, it heads north up\nthe American coast, advances as far as Newfoundland, swerves away\nunder the thrust of a cold current from the Davis Strait,\nand resumes its ocean course by going along a great circle\nof the earth on a rhumb line; it then divides into two arms near\nthe 43rd parallel; one, helped by the northeast trade winds,\nreturns to the Bay of Biscay and the Azores; the other washes the shores\nof Ireland and Norway with lukewarm water, goes beyond Spitzbergen,\nwhere its temperature falls to 4 degrees centigrade, and fashions\nthe open sea at the pole.\n\nIt was on this oceanic river that the Nautilus was then navigating.\nLeaving Old Bahama Channel, which is fourteen leagues wide by 350 meters\ndeep, the Gulf Stream moves at the rate of eight kilometers per hour.\nIts speed steadily decreases as it advances northward, and we must\npray that this steadiness continues, because, as experts agree,\nif its speed and direction were to change, the climates of Europe\nwould undergo disturbances whose consequences are incalculable.\n\nNear noon I was on the platform with Conseil.  I shared with him\nthe relevant details on the Gulf Stream.  When my explanation was over,\nI invited him to dip his hands into its current.\n\nConseil did so, and he was quite astonished to experience no sensation\nof either hot or cold.\n\n\"That comes,\" I told him, \"from the water temperature of the Gulf Stream,\nwhich, as it leaves the Gulf of Mexico, is barely different from\nyour blood temperature.  This Gulf Stream is a huge heat generator\nthat enables the coasts of Europe to be decked in eternal greenery.\nAnd if Commander Maury is correct, were one to harness the full\nwarmth of this current, it would supply enough heat to keep molten\na river of iron solder as big as the Amazon or the Missouri.\"\n\nJust then the Gulf Stream's speed was 2.25 meters per second.\nSo distinct is its current from the surrounding sea, its confined\nwaters stand out against the ocean and operate on a different level\nfrom the colder waters.  Murky as well, and very rich in saline material,\ntheir pure indigo contrasts with the green waves surrounding them.\nMoreover, their line of demarcation is so clear that abreast of\nthe Carolinas, the Nautilus's spur cut the waves of the Gulf Stream\nwhile its propeller was still churning those belonging to the ocean.\n\nThis current swept along with it a whole host of moving creatures.\nArgonauts, so common in the Mediterranean, voyaged here in schools\nof large numbers.  Among cartilaginous fish, the most remarkable were\nrays whose ultra slender tails made up nearly a third of the body,\nwhich was shaped like a huge diamond twenty-five feet long;\nthen little one-meter sharks, the head large, the snout short\nand rounded, the teeth sharp and arranged in several rows,\nthe body seemingly covered with scales.\n\nAmong bony fish, I noted grizzled wrasse unique to these seas,\ndeep-water gilthead whose iris has a fiery gleam, one-meter croakers\nwhose large mouths bristle with small teeth and which let out\nthin cries, black rudderfish like those I've already discussed,\nblue dorados accented with gold and silver, rainbow-hued parrotfish\nthat can rival the loveliest tropical birds in coloring,\nbanded blennies with triangular heads, bluish flounder without scales,\ntoadfish covered with a crosswise yellow band in the shape of a Greek t,\nswarms of little freckled gobies stippled with brown spots,\nlungfish with silver heads and yellow tails, various specimens\nof salmon, mullet with slim figures and a softly glowing radiance\nthat Lac\u00e9p\u010dde dedicated to the memory of his wife, and finally\nthe American cavalla, a handsome fish decorated by every honorary order,\nbedizened with their every ribbon, frequenting the shores of this\ngreat nation where ribbons and orders are held in such low esteem.\n\nI might add that during the night, the Gulf Stream's phosphorescent\nwaters rivaled the electric glow of our beacon, especially in\nthe stormy weather that frequently threatened us.\n\nOn May 8, while abreast of North Carolina, we were across from\nCape Hatteras once more.  There the Gulf Stream is seventy-five\nmiles wide and 210 meters deep.  The Nautilus continued to wander\nat random.  Seemingly, all supervision had been jettisoned.\nUnder these conditions I admit that we could easily have gotten away.\nIn fact, the populous shores offered ready refuge everywhere.\nThe sea was plowed continuously by the many steamers providing\nservice between the Gulf of Mexico and New York or Boston,\nand it was crossed night and day by little schooners engaged\nin coastal trade over various points on the American shore.\nWe could hope to be picked up.  So it was a promising opportunity,\ndespite the thirty miles that separated the Nautilus from\nthese Union coasts.\n\nBut one distressing circumstance totally thwarted the Canadian's plans.\nThe weather was thoroughly foul.  We were approaching waterways\nwhere storms are commonplace, the very homeland of tornadoes\nand cyclones specifically engendered by the Gulf Stream's current.\nTo face a frequently raging sea in a frail skiff was a race\nto certain disaster.  Ned Land conceded this himself.\nSo he champed at the bit, in the grip of an intense homesickness\nthat could be cured only by our escape.\n\n\"Sir,\" he told me that day, \"it's got to stop.  I want to get to\nthe bottom of this.  Your Nemo's veering away from shore and heading\nup north.  But believe you me, I had my fill at the South Pole\nand I'm not going with him to the North Pole.\"\n\n\"What can we do, Ned, since it isn't feasible to escape right now?\"\n\n\"I keep coming back to my idea.  We've got to talk to the captain.\nWhen we were in your own country's seas, you didn't say a word.\nNow that we're in mine, I intend to speak up.  Before a few days\nare out, I figure the Nautilus will lie abreast of Nova Scotia,\nand from there to Newfoundland is the mouth of a large gulf,\nand the St. Lawrence empties into that gulf, and the St. Lawrence\nis my own river, the river running by Quebec, my hometown--\nand when I think about all this, my gorge rises and my hair\nstands on end!  Honestly, sir, I'd rather jump overboard!\nI can't stay here any longer!  I'm suffocating!\"\n\nThe Canadian was obviously at the end of his patience.\nHis vigorous nature couldn't adapt to this protracted imprisonment.\nHis facial appearance was changing by the day.  His moods grew gloomier\nand gloomier.  I had a sense of what he was suffering because I also was\ngripped by homesickness.  Nearly seven months had gone by without our\nhaving any news from shore.  Moreover, Captain Nemo's reclusiveness,\nhis changed disposition, and especially his total silence since the battle\nwith the devilfish all made me see things in a different light.\nI no longer felt the enthusiasm of our first days on board.\nYou needed to be Flemish like Conseil to accept these circumstances,\nliving in a habitat designed for cetaceans and other denizens\nof the deep.  Truly, if that gallant lad had owned gills instead\nof lungs, I think he would have made an outstanding fish!\n\n\"Well, sir?\"  Ned Land went on, seeing that I hadn't replied.\n\n\"Well, Ned, you want me to ask Captain Nemo what he intends\nto do with us?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Even though he has already made that clear?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I want it settled once and for all.  Speak just for me,\nstrictly on my behalf, if you want.\"\n\n\"But I rarely encounter him.  He positively avoids me.\"\n\n\"All the more reason you should go look him up.\"\n\n\"I'll confer with him, Ned.\"\n\n\"When?\" the Canadian asked insistently.\n\n\"When I encounter him.\"\n\n\"Professor Aronnax, would you like me to go find him myself?\"\n\n\"No, let me do it.  Tomorrow--\"\n\n\"Today,\" Ned Land said.\n\n\"So be it.  I'll see him today,\" I answered the Canadian, who,\nif he took action himself, would certainly have ruined everything.\n\nI was left to myself.  His request granted, I decided to dispose\nof it immediately.  I like things over and done with.\n\nI reentered my stateroom.  From there I could hear movements\ninside Captain Nemo's quarters.  I couldn't pass up this chance\nfor an encounter.  I knocked on his door.  I received no reply.\nI knocked again, then tried the knob.  The door opened.\n\nI entered.  The captain was there.  He was bending over his worktable\nand hadn't heard me.  Determined not to leave without questioning him,\nI drew closer.  He looked up sharply, with a frowning brow,\nand said in a pretty stern tone:\n\n\"Oh, it's you!  What do you want?\"\n\n\"To speak with you, captain.\"\n\n\"But I'm busy, sir, I'm at work.  I give you the freedom to enjoy\nyour privacy, can't I have the same for myself?\"\n\nThis reception was less than encouraging.  But I was determined\nto give as good as I got.\n\n\"Sir,\" I said coolly, \"I need to speak with you on a matter that\nsimply can't wait.\"\n\n\"Whatever could that be, sir?\" he replied sarcastically.\n\"Have you made some discovery that has escaped me?  Has the sea\nyielded up some novel secret to you?\"\n\nWe were miles apart.  But before I could reply, he showed me\na manuscript open on the table and told me in a more serious tone:\n\n\"Here, Professor Aronnax, is a manuscript written in several languages.\nIt contains a summary of my research under the sea, and God willing, it\nwon't perish with me.  Signed with my name, complete with my life story,\nthis manuscript will be enclosed in a small, unsinkable contrivance.\nThe last surviving man on the Nautilus will throw this contrivance\ninto the sea, and it will go wherever the waves carry it.\"\n\nThe man's name!  His life story written by himself!\nSo the secret of his existence might someday be unveiled?\nBut just then I saw this announcement only as a lead-in to my topic.\n\n\"Captain,\" I replied, \"I'm all praise for this idea you're putting\ninto effect.  The fruits of your research must not be lost.\nBut the methods you're using strike me as primitive.  Who knows where\nthe winds will take that contrivance, into whose hands it may fall?\nCan't you find something better?  Can't you or one of your men--\"\n\n\"Never, sir,\" the captain said, swiftly interrupting me.\n\n\"But my companions and I would be willing to safeguard this manuscript,\nand if you give us back our freedom--\"\n\n\"Your freedom!\"  Captain Nemo put in, standing up.\n\n\"Yes, sir, and that's the subject on which I wanted to confer with you.\nFor seven months we've been aboard your vessel, and I ask you today,\nin the name of my companions as well as myself, if you intend\nto keep us here forever.\"\n\n\"Professor Aronnax,\" Captain Nemo said, \"I'll answer you today\njust as I did seven months ago:  whoever boards the Nautilus must\nnever leave it.\"\n\n\"What you're inflicting on us is outright slavery!\"\n\n\"Call it anything you like.\"\n\n\"But every slave has the right to recover his freedom!\nBy any worthwhile, available means!\"\n\n\"Who has denied you that right?\"  Captain Nemo replied.\n\"Did I ever try to bind you with your word of honor?\"\n\nThe captain stared at me, crossing his arms.\n\n\"Sir,\" I told him, \"to take up this subject a second time would\nbe distasteful to both of us.  So let's finish what we've started.\nI repeat:  it isn't just for myself that I raise this issue.\nTo me, research is a relief, a potent diversion, an enticement,\na passion that can make me forget everything else.  Like you, I'm a man\nneglected and unknown, living in the faint hope that someday I can pass\non to future generations the fruits of my labors--figuratively speaking,\nby means of some contrivance left to the luck of winds and waves.\nIn short, I can admire you and comfortably go with you while playing\na role I only partly understand; but I still catch glimpses\nof other aspects of your life that are surrounded by involvements\nand secrets that, alone on board, my companions and I can't share.\nAnd even when our hearts could beat with yours, moved by some of your\ngriefs or stirred by your deeds of courage and genius, we've had to stifle\neven the slightest token of that sympathy that arises at the sight\nof something fine and good, whether it comes from friend or enemy.\nAll right then!  It's this feeling of being alien to your deepest\nconcerns that makes our situation unacceptable, impossible,\neven impossible for me but especially for Ned Land.  Every man,\nby virtue of his very humanity, deserves fair treatment.\nHave you considered how a love of freedom and hatred of slavery could\nlead to plans of vengeance in a temperament like the Canadian's,\nwhat he might think, attempt, endeavor . . . ?\"\n\nI fell silent.  Captain Nemo stood up.\n\n\"Ned Land can think, attempt, or endeavor anything he wants,\nwhat difference is it to me?  I didn't go looking for him!\nI don't keep him on board for my pleasure!  As for you, Professor Aronnax,\nyou're a man able to understand anything, even silence.\nI have nothing more to say to you.  Let this first time you've come\nto discuss this subject also be the last, because a second time I\nwon't even listen.\"\n\nI withdrew.  From that day forward our position was very strained.\nI reported this conversation to my two companions.\n\n\"Now we know,\" Ned said, \"that we can't expect a thing from this man.\nThe Nautilus is nearing Long Island.  We'll escape, no matter\nwhat the weather.\"\n\nBut the skies became more and more threatening.  There were\nconspicuous signs of a hurricane on the way.  The atmosphere was\nturning white and milky.  Slender sheaves of cirrus clouds were\nfollowed on the horizon by layers of nimbocumulus.  Other low clouds\nfled swiftly.  The sea grew towering, inflated by long swells.\nEvery bird had disappeared except a few petrels, friends of the storms.\nThe barometer fell significantly, indicating a tremendous tension\nin the surrounding haze.  The mixture in our stormglass decomposed\nunder the influence of the electricity charging the air.\nA struggle of the elements was approaching.\n\nThe storm burst during the daytime of May 13, just as the Nautilus\nwas cruising abreast of Long Island, a few miles from the narrows\nto Upper New York Bay.  I'm able to describe this struggle of\nthe elements because Captain Nemo didn't flee into the ocean depths;\ninstead, from some inexplicable whim, he decided to brave it out\non the surface.\n\nThe wind was blowing from the southwest, initially a stiff breeze,\nin other words, with a speed of fifteen meters per second,\nwhich built to twenty-five meters near three o'clock in the afternoon.\nThis is the figure for major storms.\n\nUnshaken by these squalls, Captain Nemo stationed himself\non the platform.  He was lashed around the waist to withstand\nthe monstrous breakers foaming over the deck.  I hoisted and attached\nmyself to the same place, dividing my wonderment between the storm\nand this incomparable man who faced it head-on.\n\nThe raging sea was swept with huge tattered clouds drenched\nby the waves.  I saw no more of the small intervening billows\nthat form in the troughs of the big crests.  Just long,\nsoot-colored undulations with crests so compact they didn't foam.\nThey kept growing taller.  They were spurring each other on.\nThe Nautilus, sometimes lying on its side, sometimes standing on end\nlike a mast, rolled and pitched frightfully.\n\nNear five o'clock a torrential rain fell, but it lulled neither\nwind nor sea.  The hurricane was unleashed at a speed of forty-five\nmeters per second, hence almost forty leagues per hour.\nUnder these conditions houses topple, roof tiles puncture doors,\niron railings snap in two, and twenty-four-pounder cannons relocate.\nAnd yet in the midst of this turmoil, the Nautilus lived up to that saying\nof an expert engineer:  \"A well-constructed hull can defy any sea!\"\nThis submersible was no resisting rock that waves could demolish;\nit was a steel spindle, obediently in motion, without rigging\nor masting, and able to brave their fury with impunity.\n\nMeanwhile I was carefully examining these unleashed breakers.\nThey measured up to fifteen meters in height over a length\nof 150 to 175 meters, and the speed of their propagation\n(half that of the wind) was fifteen meters per second.\nTheir volume and power increased with the depth of the waters.\nI then understood the role played by these waves, which trap air\nin their flanks and release it in the depths of the sea where its\noxygen brings life.  Their utmost pressure--it has been calculated--\ncan build to 3,000 kilograms on every square foot of surface they strike.\nIt was such waves in the Hebrides that repositioned a stone block\nweighing 84,000 pounds.  It was their relatives in the tidal wave\non December 23, 1854, that toppled part of the Japanese city of Tokyo,\nthen went that same day at 700 kilometers per hour to break on\nthe beaches of America.\n\nAfter nightfall the storm grew in intensity.  As in the 1860 cyclone\non R\u00e9union Island, the barometer fell to 710 millimeters.  At the close\nof day, I saw a big ship passing on the horizon, struggling painfully.\nIt lay to at half steam in an effort to hold steady on the waves.\nIt must have been a steamer on one of those lines out of New York\nto Liverpool or Le Havre.  It soon vanished into the shadows.\n\nAt ten o'clock in the evening, the skies caught on fire.\nThe air was streaked with violent flashes of lightning.\nI couldn't stand this brightness, but Captain Nemo stared\nstraight at it, as if to inhale the spirit of the storm.\nA dreadful noise filled the air, a complicated noise made up of the roar\nof crashing breakers, the howl of the wind, claps of thunder.\nThe wind shifted to every point of the horizon, and the cyclone\nleft the east to return there after passing through north, west,\nand south, moving in the opposite direction of revolving storms\nin the southern hemisphere.\n\nOh, that Gulf Stream!  It truly lives up to its nickname,\nthe Lord of Storms!  All by itself it creates these fearsome\ncyclones through the difference in temperature between its currents\nand the superimposed layers of air.\n\nThe rain was followed by a downpour of fire.  Droplets of water\nchanged into exploding tufts.  You would have thought Captain Nemo was\ncourting a death worthy of himself, seeking to be struck by lightning.\nIn one hideous pitching movement, the Nautilus reared its steel\nspur into the air like a lightning rod, and I saw long sparks\nshoot down it.\n\nShattered, at the end of my strength, I slid flat on my belly\nto the hatch.  I opened it and went below to the lounge.\nBy then the storm had reached its maximum intensity.\nIt was impossible to stand upright inside the Nautilus.\n\nCaptain Nemo reentered near midnight.  I could hear the ballast\ntanks filling little by little, and the Nautilus sank gently beneath\nthe surface of the waves.\n\nThrough the lounge's open windows, I saw large, frightened fish\npassing like phantoms in the fiery waters.  Some were struck\nby lightning right before my eyes!\n\nThe Nautilus kept descending.  I thought it would find calm again at\nfifteen meters down.  No. The upper strata were too violently agitated.\nIt needed to sink to fifty meters, searching for a resting place\nin the bowels of the sea.\n\nBut once there, what tranquility we found, what silence, what peace\nall around us!  Who would have known that a dreadful hurricane\nwas then unleashed on the surface of this ocean?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\nIn Latitude 47 degrees 24' and Longitude 17 degrees 28'\n\n\nIN THE AFTERMATH of this storm, we were thrown back to the east.\nAway went any hope of\n\nescaping to the landing places of New York or the St. Lawrence.\nIn despair, poor Ned went into seclusion like Captain Nemo.  Conseil and\nI no longer left each other.\n\nAs I said, the Nautilus veered to the east.  To be more accurate,\nI should have said to the northeast.  Sometimes on the surface\nof the waves, sometimes beneath them, the ship wandered for days\namid these mists so feared by navigators.  These are caused\nchiefly by melting ice, which keeps the air extremely damp.\nHow many ships have perished in these waterways as they\ntried to get directions from the hazy lights on the coast!\nHow many casualties have been caused by these opaque mists!\nHow many collisions have occurred with these reefs,\nwhere the breaking surf is covered by the noise of the wind!\nHow many vessels have rammed each other, despite their running lights,\ndespite the warnings given by their bosun's pipes and alarm bells!\n\nSo the floor of this sea had the appearance of a battlefield where every\nship defeated by the ocean still lay, some already old and encrusted,\nothers newer and reflecting our beacon light on their ironwork\nand copper undersides.  Among these vessels, how many went down with\nall hands, with their crews and hosts of immigrants, at these trouble\nspots so prominent in the statistics:  Cape Race, St. Paul Island,\nthe Strait of Belle Isle, the St. Lawrence estuary!\nAnd in only a few years, how many victims have been furnished to\nthe obituary notices by the Royal Mail, Inman, and Montreal lines;\nby vessels named the Solway, the Isis, the Paramatta, the Hungarian,\nthe Canadian, the Anglo-Saxon, the Humboldt, and the United States,\nall run aground; by the Arctic and the Lyonnais, sunk in collisions;\nby the President, the Pacific, and the City of Glasgow,\nlost for reasons unknown; in the midst of their gloomy rubble,\nthe Nautilus navigated as if passing the dead in review!\n\nBy May 15 we were off the southern tip of the Grand Banks\nof Newfoundland.  These banks are the result of marine sedimentation,\nan extensive accumulation of organic waste brought either from\nthe equator by the Gulf Stream's current, or from the North Pole\nby the countercurrent of cold water that skirts the American coast.\nHere, too, erratically drifting chunks collect from the ice breakup.\nHere a huge boneyard forms from fish, mollusks, and zoophytes dying\nover it by the billions.\n\nThe sea is of no great depth at the Grand Banks.  A few hundred\nfathoms at best.  But to the south there is a deep, suddenly occurring\ndepression, a 3,000-meter pit.  Here the Gulf Stream widens.\nIts waters come to full bloom.  It loses its speed and temperature,\nbut it turns into a sea.\n\nAmong the fish that the Nautilus startled on its way, I'll mention\na one-meter lumpfish, blackish on top with orange on the belly\nand rare among its brethren in that it practices monogamy,\na good-sized eelpout, a type of emerald moray whose flavor is excellent,\nwolffish with big eyes in a head somewhat resembling a canine's,\nviviparous blennies whose eggs hatch inside their bodies like those\nof snakes, bloated gobio (or black gudgeon) measuring two decimeters,\ngrenadiers with long tails and gleaming with a silvery glow,\nspeedy fish venturing far from their High Arctic seas.\n\nOur nets also hauled in a bold, daring, vigorous, and muscular\nfish armed with prickles on its head and stings on its fins,\na real scorpion measuring two to three meters, the ruthless enemy\nof cod, blennies, and salmon; it was the bullhead of the northerly seas,\na fish with red fins and a brown body covered with nodules.\nThe Nautilus's fishermen had some trouble getting a grip on\nthis animal, which, thanks to the formation of its gill covers,\ncan protect its respiratory organs from any parching contact\nwith the air and can live out of water for a good while.\n\nAnd I'll mention--for the record--some little banded blennies that\nfollow ships into the northernmost seas, sharp-snouted carp exclusive\nto the north Atlantic, scorpionfish, and lastly the gadoid family,\nchiefly the cod species, which I detected in their waters of choice\nover these inexhaustible Grand Banks.\n\nBecause Newfoundland is simply an underwater peak, you could\ncall these cod mountain fish.  While the Nautilus was clearing\na path through their tight ranks, Conseil couldn't refrain from\nmaking this comment:\n\n\"Mercy, look at these cod!\" he said.  \"Why, I thought cod were flat,\nlike dab or sole!\"\n\n\"Innocent boy!\"  I exclaimed.  \"Cod are flat only at the\ngrocery store, where they're cut open and spread out on display.\nBut in the water they're like mullet, spindle-shaped and perfectly\nbuilt for speed.\"\n\n\"I can easily believe master,\" Conseil replied.  \"But what crowds\nof them!  What swarms!\"\n\n\"Bah!  My friend, there'd be many more without their enemies,\nscorpionfish and human beings!  Do you know how many eggs have been\ncounted in a single female?\"\n\n\"I'll go all out,\" Conseil replied.  \"500,000.\"\n\n\"11,000,000, my friend.\"\n\n\"11,000,000! I refuse to accept that until I count them myself.\"\n\n\"So count them, Conseil.  But it would be less work to believe me.\nBesides, Frenchmen, Englishmen, Americans, Danes, and Norwegians catch\nthese cod by the thousands.  They're eaten in prodigious quantities,\nand without the astonishing fertility of these fish, the seas\nwould soon be depopulated of them.  Accordingly, in England and\nAmerica alone, 5,000 ships manned by 75,000 seamen go after cod.\nEach ship brings back an average catch of 4,400 fish, making 22,000,000.\nOff the coast of Norway, the total is the same.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Conseil replied, \"I'll take master's word for it.\nI won't count them.\"\n\n\"Count what?\"\n\n\"Those 11,000,000 eggs.  But I'll make one comment.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"If all their eggs hatched, just four codfish could feed\nEngland, America, and Norway.\"\n\nAs we skimmed the depths of the Grand Banks, I could see perfectly\nthose long fishing lines, each armed with 200 hooks, that every\nboat dangled by the dozens.  The lower end of each line dragged\nthe bottom by means of a small grappling iron, and at the surface\nit was secured to the buoy-rope of a cork float.  The Nautilus had\nto maneuver shrewdly in the midst of this underwater spiderweb.\n\nBut the ship didn't stay long in these heavily traveled waterways.\nIt went up to about latitude 42 degrees.  This brought it\nabreast of St. John's in Newfoundland and Heart's Content,\nwhere the Atlantic Cable reaches its end point.\n\nInstead of continuing north, the Nautilus took an easterly heading,\nas if to go along this plateau on which the telegraph cable rests,\nwhere multiple soundings have given the contours of the terrain\nwith the utmost accuracy.\n\nIt was on May 17, about 500 miles from Heart's Content and 2,800\nmeters down, that I spotted this cable lying on the seafloor.\nConseil, whom I hadn't alerted, mistook it at first for a gigantic\nsea snake and was gearing up to classify it in his best manner.\nBut I enlightened the fine lad and let him down gently by giving\nhim various details on the laying of this cable.\n\nThe first cable was put down during the years 1857-1858;\nbut after transmitting about 400 telegrams, it went dead.\nIn 1863 engineers built a new cable that measured 3,400 kilometers,\nweighed 4,500 metric tons, and was shipped aboard the Great Eastern.\nThis attempt also failed.\n\nNow then, on May 25 while submerged to a depth of 3,836 meters,\nthe Nautilus lay in precisely the locality where this second\ncable suffered the rupture that ruined the undertaking.\nIt happened 638 miles from the coast of Ireland.  At around two\no'clock in the afternoon, all contact with Europe broke off.\nThe electricians on board decided to cut the cable before fishing it up,\nand by eleven o'clock that evening they had retrieved the damaged part.\nThey repaired the joint and its splice; then the cable was resubmerged.\nBut a few days later it snapped again and couldn't be recovered\nfrom the ocean depths.\n\nThese Americans refused to give up.  The daring Cyrus Field,\nwho had risked his whole fortune to promote this undertaking,\ncalled for a new bond issue.  It sold out immediately.  Another cable\nwas put down under better conditions.  Its sheaves of conducting wire\nwere insulated within a gutta-percha covering, which was protected\nby a padding of textile material enclosed in a metal sheath.\nThe Great Eastern put back to sea on July 13, 1866.\n\nThe operation proceeded apace.  Yet there was one hitch.\nAs they gradually unrolled this third cable, the electricians observed\non several occasions that someone had recently driven nails into it,\ntrying to damage its core.  Captain Anderson, his officers,\nand the engineers put their heads together, then posted a warning that if\nthe culprit were detected, he would be thrown overboard without a trial.\nAfter that, these villainous attempts were not repeated.\n\nBy July 23 the Great Eastern was lying no farther than 800\nkilometers from Newfoundland when it received telegraphed news from\nIreland of an armistice signed between Prussia and Austria after\nthe Battle of Sadova.  Through the mists on the 27th, it sighted\nthe port of Heart's Content.  The undertaking had ended happily,\nand in its first dispatch, young America addressed old Europe with\nthese wise words so rarely understood:  \"Glory to God in the highest,\nand peace on earth to men of good will.\"\n\nI didn't expect to find this electric cable in mint condition,\nas it looked on leaving its place of manufacture.  The long snake\nwas covered with seashell rubble and bristling with foraminifera;\na crust of caked gravel protected it from any mollusks that might\nbore into it.  It rested serenely, sheltered from the sea's motions,\nunder a pressure favorable to the transmission of that electric\nspark that goes from America to Europe in 32/100 of a second.\nThis cable will no doubt last indefinitely because, as observers note,\nits gutta-percha casing is improved by a stay in salt water.\n\nBesides, on this well-chosen plateau, the cable never lies at\ndepths that could cause a break.  The Nautilus followed it to its\nlowest reaches, located 4,431 meters down, and even there it rested\nwithout any stress or strain.  Then we returned to the locality\nwhere the 1863 accident had taken place.\n\nThere the ocean floor formed a valley 120 kilometers wide,\ninto which you could fit Mt.  Blanc without its summit poking above\nthe surface of the waves.  This valley is closed off to the east\nby a sheer wall 2,000 meters high.  We arrived there on May 28,\nand the Nautilus lay no farther than 150 kilometers from Ireland.\n\nWould Captain Nemo head up north and beach us on the British Isles?\nNo. Much to my surprise, he went back down south and returned\nto European seas.  As we swung around the Emerald Isle, I spotted\nCape Clear for an instant, plus the lighthouse on Fastnet Rock\nthat guides all those thousands of ships setting out from\nGlasgow or Liverpool.\n\nAn important question then popped into my head.  Would the Nautilus\ndare to tackle the English Channel?  Ned Land (who promptly\nreappeared after we hugged shore) never stopped questioning me.\nWhat could I answer him?  Captain Nemo remained invisible.\nAfter giving the Canadian a glimpse of American shores, was he about\nto show me the coast of France?\n\nBut the Nautilus kept gravitating southward.  On May 30, in sight\nof Land's End, it passed between the lowermost tip of England\nand the Scilly Islands, which it left behind to starboard.\n\nIf it was going to enter the English Channel, it clearly needed\nto head east.  It did not.\n\nAll day long on May 31, the Nautilus swept around the sea\nin a series of circles that had me deeply puzzled.  It seemed\nto be searching for a locality that it had some trouble finding.\nAt noon Captain Nemo himself came to take our bearings.\nHe didn't address a word to me.  He looked gloomier than ever.\nWhat was filling him with such sadness?  Was it our proximity to\nthese European shores?  Was he reliving his memories of that country\nhe had left behind?  If so, what did he feel?  Remorse or regret?\nFor a good while these thoughts occupied my mind, and I had a hunch\nthat fate would soon give away the captain's secrets.\n\nThe next day, June 1, the Nautilus kept to the same tack.\nIt was obviously trying to locate some precise spot in the ocean.\nJust as on the day before, Captain Nemo came to take the altitude\nof the sun.  The sea was smooth, the skies clear.  Eight miles\nto the east, a big steamship was visible on the horizon line.\nNo flag was flapping from the gaff of its fore-and-aft sail,\nand I couldn't tell its nationality.\n\nA few minutes before the sun passed its zenith, Captain Nemo\nraised his sextant and took his sights with the utmost precision.\nThe absolute calm of the waves facilitated this operation.\nThe Nautilus lay motionless, neither rolling nor pitching.\n\nI was on the platform just then.  After determining our position,\nthe captain pronounced only these words:\n\n\"It's right here!\"\n\nHe went down the hatch.  Had he seen that vessel change course\nand seemingly head toward us?  I'm unable to say.\n\nI returned to the lounge.  The hatch closed, and I heard water hissing\nin the ballast tanks.  The Nautilus began to sink on a vertical line,\nbecause its propeller was in check and no longer furnished\nany forward motion.\n\nSome minutes later it stopped at a depth of 833 meters and came\nto rest on the seafloor.\n\nThe ceiling lights in the lounge then went out, the panels opened,\nand through the windows I saw, for a half-mile radius, the sea\nbrightly lit by the beacon's rays.\n\nI looked to port and saw nothing but the immenseness of\nthese tranquil waters.\n\nTo starboard, a prominent bulge on the sea bottom caught my attention.\nYou would have thought it was some ruin enshrouded in a crust\nof whitened seashells, as if under a mantle of snow.\nCarefully examining this mass, I could identify the swollen outlines\nof a ship shorn of its masts, which must have sunk bow first.\nThis casualty certainly dated from some far-off time.\nTo be so caked with the limestone of these waters, this wreckage\nmust have spent many a year on the ocean floor.\n\nWhat ship was this?  Why had the Nautilus come to visit its grave?\nWas it something other than a maritime accident that had dragged\nthis craft under the waters?\n\nI wasn't sure what to think, but next to me I heard Captain Nemo's\nvoice slowly say:\n\n\"Originally this ship was christened the Marseillais.  It carried\nseventy-four cannons and was launched in 1762.  On August 13,\n1778, commanded by La Poype-Vertrieux, it fought valiantly\nagainst the Preston.  On July 4, 1779, as a member of the squadron\nunder Admiral d'Estaing, it assisted in the capture of the island\nof Grenada.  On September 5, 1781, under the Count de Grasse,\nit took part in the Battle of Chesapeake Bay.  In 1794 the new Republic\nof France changed the name of this ship.  On April 16 of that same year,\nit joined the squadron at Brest under Rear Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse,\nwho was entrusted with escorting a convoy of wheat coming from\nAmerica under the command of Admiral Van Stabel.  In this second\nyear of the French Revolutionary Calendar, on the 11th and 12th\ndays in the Month of Pasture, this squadron fought an encounter\nwith English vessels.  Sir, today is June 1, 1868, or the 13th\nday in the Month of Pasture.  Seventy-four years ago to the day,\nat this very spot in latitude 47 degrees 24' and longitude 17 degrees\n28', this ship sank after a heroic battle; its three masts gone,\nwater in its hold, a third of its crew out of action, it preferred\nto go to the bottom with its 356 seamen rather than surrender;\nand with its flag nailed up on the afterdeck, it disappeared beneath\nthe waves to shouts of 'Long live the Republic!'\"\n\n\"This is the Avenger!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes, sir!  The Avenger!  A splendid name!\"  Captain Nemo murmured,\ncrossing his arms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\nA Mass Execution\n\n\nTHE WAY HE SAID THIS, the unexpectedness of this scene, first the\nbiography of this patriotic ship, then the excitement with which this\neccentric individual pronounced these last words--the name Avenger\nwhose significance could not escape me--all this, taken together,\nhad a profound impact on my mind.  My eyes never left the captain.\nHands outstretched toward the sea, he contemplated the proud\nwreck with blazing eyes.  Perhaps I would never learn who he was,\nwhere he came from or where he was heading, but more and more I\ncould see a distinction between the man and the scientist.\nIt was no ordinary misanthropy that kept Captain Nemo and his companions\nsequestered inside the Nautilus's plating, but a hate so monstrous\nor so sublime that the passing years could never weaken it.\n\nDid this hate also hunger for vengeance?  Time would soon tell.\n\nMeanwhile the Nautilus rose slowly to the surface of the sea, and I\nwatched the Avenger's murky shape disappearing little by little.\nSoon a gentle rolling told me that we were afloat in the open air.\n\nJust then a hollow explosion was audible.  I looked at the captain.\nThe captain did not stir.\n\n\"Captain?\"  I said.\n\nHe didn't reply.\n\nI left him and climbed onto the platform.  Conseil and the Canadian\nwere already there.\n\n\"What caused that explosion?\"  I asked.\n\n\"A cannon going off,\" Ned Land replied.\n\nI stared in the direction of the ship I had spotted.  It was heading\ntoward the Nautilus, and you could tell it had put on steam.\nSix miles separated it from us.\n\n\"What sort of craft is it, Ned?\"\n\n\"From its rigging and its low masts,\" the Canadian replied,\n\"I bet it's a warship.  Here's hoping it pulls up and sinks this\ndamned Nautilus!\"\n\n\"Ned my friend,\" Conseil replied, \"what harm could it do\nthe Nautilus?  Will it attack us under the waves?  Will it cannonade\nus at the bottom of the sea?\"\n\n\"Tell me, Ned,\" I asked, \"can you make out the nationality\nof that craft?\"\n\nCreasing his brow, lowering his lids, and puckering the corners\nof his eyes, the Canadian focused the full power of his gaze on\nthe ship for a short while.\n\n\"No, sir,\" he replied.  \"I can't make out what nation it's from.\nIt's flying no flag.  But I'll swear it's a warship, because there's\na long pennant streaming from the peak of its mainmast.\"\n\nFor a quarter of an hour, we continued to watch the craft bearing\ndown on us.  But it was inconceivable to me that it had discovered\nthe Nautilus at such a distance, still less that it knew what this\nunderwater machine really was.\n\nSoon the Canadian announced that the craft was a big battleship,\na double-decker ironclad complete with ram.  Dark, dense smoke\nburst from its two funnels.  Its furled sails merged with the lines\nof its yardarms.  The gaff of its fore-and-aft sail flew no flag.\nIts distance still kept us from distinguishing the colors of its pennant,\nwhich was fluttering like a thin ribbon.\n\nIt was coming on fast.  If Captain Nemo let it approach, a chance\nfor salvation might be available to us.\n\n\"Sir,\" Ned Land told me, \"if that boat gets within a mile of us,\nI'm jumping overboard, and I suggest you follow suit.\"\n\nI didn't reply to the Canadian's proposition but kept watching\nthe ship, which was looming larger on the horizon.  Whether it\nwas English, French, American, or Russian, it would surely welcome\nus aboard if we could just get to it.\n\n\"Master may recall,\" Conseil then said, \"that we have some experience\nwith swimming.  He can rely on me to tow him to that vessel,\nif he's agreeable to going with our friend Ned.\"\n\nBefore I could reply, white smoke streamed from the battleship's bow.\nThen, a few seconds later, the waters splashed astern of the Nautilus,\ndisturbed by the fall of a heavy object.  Soon after, an explosion\nstruck my ears.\n\n\"What's this?  They're firing at us!\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"Good lads!\" the Canadian muttered.\n\n\"That means they don't see us as castaways clinging to some wreckage!\"\n\n\"With all due respect to master--gracious!\"  Conseil put in,\nshaking off the water that had sprayed over him from another shell.\n\"With all due respect to master, they've discovered the narwhale\nand they're cannonading the same.\"\n\n\"But it must be clear to them,\" I exclaimed, \"that they're dealing\nwith human beings.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's why!\"  Ned Land replied, staring hard at me.\n\nThe full truth dawned on me.  Undoubtedly people now knew\nwhere they stood on the existence of this so-called monster.\nUndoubtedly the latter's encounter with the Abraham Lincoln,\nwhen the Canadian hit it with his harpoon, had led Commander Farragut\nto recognize the narwhale as actually an underwater boat,\nmore dangerous than any unearthly cetacean!\n\nYes, this had to be the case, and undoubtedly they were now chasing\nthis dreadful engine of destruction on every sea!\n\nDreadful indeed, if, as we could assume, Captain Nemo\nhad been using the Nautilus in works of vengeance!\nThat night in the middle of the Indian Ocean, when he imprisoned\nus in the cell, hadn't he attacked some ship?  That man now buried\nin the coral cemetery, wasn't he the victim of some collision\ncaused by the Nautilus?  Yes, I repeat:  this had to be the case.\nOne part of Captain Nemo's secret life had been unveiled.\nAnd now, even though his identity was still unknown, at least\nthe nations allied against him knew they were no longer hunting\nsome fairy-tale monster, but a man who had sworn an implacable\nhate toward them!\n\nThis whole fearsome sequence of events appeared in my mind's eye.\nInstead of encountering friends on this approaching ship, we would\nfind only pitiless enemies.\n\nMeanwhile shells fell around us in increasing numbers.\nSome, meeting the liquid surface, would ricochet and vanish into the sea\nat considerable distances.  But none of them reached the Nautilus.\n\nBy then the ironclad was no more than three miles off.  Despite its\nviolent cannonade, Captain Nemo hadn't appeared on the platform.\nAnd yet if one of those conical shells had scored a routine hit\non the Nautilus's hull, it could have been fatal to him.\n\nThe Canadian then told me:\n\n\"Sir, we've got to do everything we can to get out of this jam!\nLet's signal them!  Damnation!  Maybe they'll realize\nwe're decent people!\"\n\nNed Land pulled out his handkerchief to wave it in the air.\nBut he had barely unfolded it when he was felled by an iron fist,\nand despite his great strength, he tumbled to the deck.\n\n\"Scum!\" the captain shouted.  \"Do you want to be nailed to the Nautilus's\nspur before it charges that ship?\"\n\nDreadful to hear, Captain Nemo was even more dreadful to see.\nHis face was pale from some spasm of his heart, which must have stopped\nbeating for an instant.  His pupils were hideously contracted.\nHis voice was no longer speaking, it was bellowing.  Bending from\nthe waist, he shook the Canadian by the shoulders.\n\nThen, dropping Ned and turning to the battleship, whose shells\nwere showering around him:\n\n\"O ship of an accursed nation, you know who I am!\" he shouted\nin his powerful voice.  \"And I don't need your colors to\nrecognize you!  Look!  I'll show you mine!\"\n\nAnd in the bow of the platform, Captain Nemo unfurled a black flag,\nlike the one he had left planted at the South Pole.\n\nJust then a shell hit the Nautilus's hull obliquely, failed to breach it,\nricocheted near the captain, and vanished into the sea.\n\nCaptain Nemo shrugged his shoulders.  Then, addressing me:\n\n\"Go below!\" he told me in a curt tone.  \"You and your companions,\ngo below!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" I exclaimed, \"are you going to attack this ship?\"\n\n\"Sir, I'm going to sink it.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't!\"\n\n\"I will,\" Captain Nemo replied icily.  \"You're ill-advised to pass\njudgment on me, sir.  Fate has shown you what you weren't meant\nto see.  The attack has come.  Our reply will be dreadful.\nGet back inside!\"\n\n\"From what country is that ship?\"\n\n\"You don't know?  Fine, so much the better!  At least its nationality\nwill remain a secret to you.  Go below!\"\n\nThe Canadian, Conseil, and I could only obey.  Some fifteen\nof the Nautilus's seamen surrounded their captain and stared with\na feeling of implacable hate at the ship bearing down on them.\nYou could feel the same spirit of vengeance enkindling their every soul.\n\nI went below just as another projectile scraped the Nautilus's hull,\nand I heard the captain exclaim:\n\n\"Shoot, you demented vessel!  Shower your futile shells!  You won't escape\nthe Nautilus's spur!  But this isn't the place where you'll perish!\nI don't want your wreckage mingling with that of the Avenger!\"\n\nI repaired to my stateroom.  The captain and his chief officer\nstayed on the platform.  The propeller was set in motion.\nThe Nautilus swiftly retreated, putting us outside the range\nof the vessel's shells.  But the chase continued, and Captain Nemo\nwas content to keep his distance.\n\nNear four o'clock in the afternoon, unable to control the impatience\nand uneasiness devouring me, I went back to the central companionway.\nThe hatch was open.  I ventured onto the platform.  The captain was\nstill strolling there, his steps agitated.  He stared at the ship,\nwhich stayed to his leeward five or six miles off.  He was circling it\nlike a wild beast, drawing it eastward, letting it chase after him.\nYet he didn't attack.  Was he, perhaps, still undecided?\n\nI tried to intervene one last time.  But I had barely queried\nCaptain Nemo when the latter silenced me:\n\n\"I'm the law, I'm the tribunal!  I'm the oppressed, and there\nare my oppressors!  Thanks to them, I've witnessed the destruction\nof everything I loved, cherished, and venerated--homeland, wife,\nchildren, father, and mother!  There lies everything I hate!\nNot another word out of you!\"\n\nI took a last look at the battleship, which was putting on steam.\nThen I rejoined Ned and Conseil.\n\n\"We'll escape!\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"Good,\" Ned put in.  \"Where's that ship from?\"\n\n\"I've no idea.  But wherever it's from, it will sink before nightfall.\nIn any event, it's better to perish with it than be accomplices\nin some act of revenge whose merits we can't gauge.\"\n\n\"That's my feeling,\" Ned Land replied coolly.  \"Let's wait for nightfall.\"\n\nNight fell.  A profound silence reigned on board.  The compass\nindicated that the Nautilus hadn't changed direction.  I could hear\nthe beat of its propeller, churning the waves with steady speed.\nStaying on the surface of the water, it rolled gently, sometimes to\none side, sometimes to the other.\n\nMy companions and I had decided to escape as soon as the vessel came\nclose enough for us to be heard--or seen, because the moon would wax\nfull in three days and was shining brightly.  Once we were aboard\nthat ship, if we couldn't ward off the blow that threatened it,\nat least we could do everything that circumstances permitted.\nSeveral times I thought the Nautilus was about to attack.\nBut it was content to let its adversary approach, and then it would\nquickly resume its retreating ways.\n\nPart of the night passed without incident.  We kept watch for an\nopportunity to take action.  We talked little, being too keyed up.\nNed Land was all for jumping overboard.  I forced him to wait.\nAs I saw it, the Nautilus would attack the double-decker on\nthe surface of the waves, and then it would be not only possible\nbut easy to escape.\n\nAt three o'clock in the morning, full of uneasiness,\nI climbed onto the platform.  Captain Nemo hadn't left it.\nHe stood in the bow next to his flag, which a mild breeze was\nunfurling above his head.  His eyes never left that vessel.\nThe extraordinary intensity of his gaze seemed to attract it,\nbeguile it, and draw it more surely than if he had it in tow!\n\nThe moon then passed its zenith.  Jupiter was rising in the east.\nIn the midst of this placid natural setting, sky and ocean competed\nwith each other in tranquility, and the sea offered the orb of night\nthe loveliest mirror ever to reflect its image.\n\nAnd when I compared this deep calm of the elements with all the fury\nseething inside the plating of this barely perceptible Nautilus, I\nshivered all over.\n\nThe vessel was two miles off.  It drew nearer, always moving toward\nthe phosphorescent glow that signaled the Nautilus's presence.\nI saw its green and red running lights, plus the white lantern hanging\nfrom the large stay of its foremast.  Hazy flickerings were reflected\non its rigging and indicated that its furnaces were pushed to the limit.\nShowers of sparks and cinders of flaming coal escaped from its funnels,\nspangling the air with stars.\n\nI stood there until six o'clock in the morning, Captain Nemo\nnever seeming to notice me.  The vessel lay a mile and a half off,\nand with the first glimmers of daylight, it resumed its cannonade.\nThe time couldn't be far away when the Nautilus would attack\nits adversary, and my companions and I would leave forever this\nman I dared not judge.\n\nI was about to go below to alert them, when the chief officer\nclimbed onto the platform.  Several seamen were with him.\nCaptain Nemo didn't see them, or didn't want to see them.\nThey carried out certain procedures that, on the Nautilus, you could\ncall \"clearing the decks for action.\"  They were quite simple.\nThe manropes that formed a handrail around the platform were lowered.\nLikewise the pilothouse and the beacon housing were withdrawn\ninto the hull until they lay exactly flush with it.  The surface\nof this long sheet-iron cigar no longer offered a single protrusion\nthat could hamper its maneuvers.\n\nI returned to the lounge.  The Nautilus still emerged above\nthe surface.  A few morning gleams infiltrated the liquid strata.\nBeneath the undulations of the billows, the windows were enlivened\nby the blushing of the rising sun.  That dreadful day of June\n2 had dawned.\n\nAt seven o'clock the log told me that the Nautilus had reduced speed.\nI realized that it was letting the warship approach.\nMoreover, the explosions grew more intensely audible.\nShells furrowed the water around us, drilling through it with an\nodd hissing sound.\n\n\"My friends,\" I said, \"it's time.  Let's shake hands, and may God\nbe with us!\"\n\nNed Land was determined, Conseil calm, I myself nervous and\nbarely in control.\n\nWe went into the library.  Just as I pushed open the door leading\nto the well of the central companionway, I heard the hatch\nclose sharply overhead.\n\nThe Canadian leaped up the steps, but I stopped him.  A well-known\nhissing told me that water was entering the ship's ballast tanks.\nIndeed, in a few moments the Nautilus had submerged some meters\nbelow the surface of the waves.\n\nI understood this maneuver.  It was too late to take action.\nThe Nautilus wasn't going to strike the double-decker where it\nwas clad in impenetrable iron armor, but below its waterline,\nwhere the metal carapace no longer protected its planking.\n\nWe were prisoners once more, unwilling spectators at the performance\nof this gruesome drama.  But we barely had time to think.  Taking refuge\nin my stateroom, we stared at each other without pronouncing a word.\nMy mind was in a total daze.  My mental processes came to a dead stop.\nI hovered in that painful state that predominates during\nthe period of anticipation before some frightful explosion.\nI waited, I listened, I lived only through my sense of hearing!\n\nMeanwhile the Nautilus's speed had increased appreciably.\nSo it was gathering momentum.  Its entire hull was vibrating.\n\nSuddenly I let out a yell.  There had been a collision, but it\nwas comparatively mild.  I could feel the penetrating force\nof the steel spur.  I could hear scratchings and scrapings.\nCarried away with its driving power, the Nautilus had passed through\nthe vessel's mass like a sailmaker's needle through canvas!\n\nI couldn't hold still.  Frantic, going insane, I leaped out of my\nstateroom and rushed into the lounge.\n\nCaptain Nemo was there.  Mute, gloomy, implacable, he was staring\nthrough the port panel.\n\nAn enormous mass was sinking beneath the waters, and the Nautilus,\nmissing none of its death throes, was descending into the depths with it.\nTen meters away, I could see its gaping hull, into which water was rushing\nwith a sound of thunder, then its double rows of cannons and railings.\nIts deck was covered with dark, quivering shadows.\n\nThe water was rising.  Those poor men leaped up into the shrouds,\nclung to the masts, writhed beneath the waters.  It was a human\nanthill that an invading sea had caught by surprise!\n\nParalyzed, rigid with anguish, my hair standing on end, my eyes popping\nout of my head, short of breath, suffocating, speechless, I stared--\nI too!  I was glued to the window by an irresistible allure!\n\nThe enormous vessel settled slowly.  Following it down, the Nautilus\nkept watch on its every movement.  Suddenly there was an eruption.\nThe air compressed inside the craft sent its decks flying,\nas if the powder stores had been ignited.  The thrust of the waters\nwas so great, the Nautilus swerved away.\n\nThe poor ship then sank more swiftly.  Its mastheads appeared,\nladen with victims, then its crosstrees bending under clusters of men,\nfinally the peak of its mainmast.  Then the dark mass disappeared,\nand with it a crew of corpses dragged under by fearsome eddies. . . .\n\nI turned to Captain Nemo.  This dreadful executioner, this true\narchangel of hate, was still staring.  When it was all over,\nCaptain Nemo headed to the door of his stateroom, opened it, and entered.\nI followed him with my eyes.\n\nOn the rear paneling, beneath the portraits of his heroes, I saw\nthe portrait of a still-youthful woman with two little children.\nCaptain Nemo stared at them for a few moments, stretched out his\narms to them, sank to his knees, and melted into sobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\nThe Last Words of Captain Nemo\n\n\nTHE PANELS CLOSED over this frightful view, but the lights didn't go\non in the lounge.  Inside the Nautilus all was gloom and silence.\nIt left this place of devastation with prodigious speed,\n100 feet beneath the waters.  Where was it going?  North or south?\nWhere would the man flee after this horrible act of revenge?\n\nI reentered my stateroom, where Ned and Conseil were waiting silently.\nCaptain Nemo filled me with insurmountable horror.\nWhatever he had once suffered at the hands of humanity,\nhe had no right to mete out such punishment.  He had made me,\nif not an accomplice, at least an eyewitness to his vengeance!\nEven this was intolerable.\n\nAt eleven o'clock the electric lights came back on.  I went into\nthe lounge.  It was deserted.  I consulted the various instruments.\nThe Nautilus was fleeing northward at a speed of twenty-five miles\nper hour, sometimes on the surface of the sea, sometimes thirty\nfeet beneath it.\n\nAfter our position had been marked on the chart, I saw that we\nwere passing into the mouth of the English Channel, that our heading\nwould take us to the northernmost seas with incomparable speed.\n\nI could barely glimpse the swift passing of longnose sharks,\nhammerhead sharks, spotted dogfish that frequent these waters,\nbig eagle rays, swarms of seahorse looking like knights on a chessboard,\neels quivering like fireworks serpents, armies of crab that fled\nobliquely by crossing their pincers over their carapaces,\nfinally schools of porpoise that held contests of speed with\nthe Nautilus.  But by this point observing, studying, and classifying\nwere out of the question.\n\nBy evening we had cleared 200 leagues up the Atlantic.  Shadows gathered\nand gloom overran the sea until the moon came up.\n\nI repaired to my stateroom.  I couldn't sleep.  I was assaulted\nby nightmares.  That horrible scene of destruction kept repeating\nin my mind's eye.\n\nFrom that day forward, who knows where the Nautilus took us\nin the north Atlantic basin?  Always at incalculable speed!\nAlways amid the High Arctic mists!  Did it call at the capes\nof Spitzbergen or the shores of Novaya Zemlya?  Did it visit such\nuncharted seas as the White Sea, the Kara Sea, the Gulf of Ob,\nthe Lyakhov Islands, or those unknown beaches on the Siberian coast?\nI'm unable to say.  I lost track of the passing hours.  Time was\nin abeyance on the ship's clocks.  As happens in the polar regions,\nit seemed that night and day no longer followed their normal sequence.\nI felt myself being drawn into that strange domain where\nthe overwrought imagination of Edgar Allan Poe was at home.\nLike his fabled Arthur Gordon Pym, I expected any moment to see\nthat \"shrouded human figure, very far larger in its proportions\nthan any dweller among men,\" thrown across the cataract that protects\nthe outskirts of the pole!\n\nI estimate--but perhaps I'm mistaken--that the Nautilus's haphazard\ncourse continued for fifteen or twenty days, and I'm not sure\nhow long this would have gone on without the catastrophe that ended\nour voyage.  As for Captain Nemo, he was no longer in the picture.\nAs for his chief officer, the same applied.  Not one crewman\nwas visible for a single instant.  The Nautilus cruised beneath\nthe waters almost continuously.  When it rose briefly to the surface\nto renew our air, the hatches opened and closed as if automated.\nNo more positions were reported on the world map.  I didn't know\nwhere we were.\n\nI'll also mention that the Canadian, at the end of his strength\nand patience, made no further appearances.  Conseil couldn't coax\na single word out of him and feared that, in a fit of delirium while\nunder the sway of a ghastly homesickness, Ned would kill himself.\nSo he kept a devoted watch on his friend every instant.\n\nYou can appreciate that under these conditions, our situation\nhad become untenable.\n\nOne morning--whose date I'm unable to specify--I was slumbering\nnear the first hours of daylight, a painful, sickly slumber.\nWaking up, I saw Ned Land leaning over me, and I heard him tell me\nin a low voice:\n\n\"We're going to escape!\"\n\nI sat up.\n\n\"When?\"  I asked.\n\n\"Tonight.  There doesn't seem to be any supervision left on\nthe Nautilus.  You'd think a total daze was reigning on board.\nWill you be ready, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Where are we?\"\n\n\"In sight of land.  I saw it through the mists just this morning,\ntwenty miles to the east.\"\n\n\"What land is it?\"\n\n\"I've no idea, but whatever it is, there we'll take refuge.\"\n\n\"Yes, Ned!  We'll escape tonight even if the sea swallows us up!\"\n\n\"The sea's rough, the wind's blowing hard, but a twenty-mile\nrun in the Nautilus's nimble longboat doesn't scare me.\nUnknown to the crew, I've stowed some food and flasks of water inside.\"\n\n\"I'm with you.\"\n\n\"What's more,\" the Canadian added, \"if they catch me, I'll defend myself,\nI'll fight to the death.\"\n\n\"Then we'll die together, Ned my friend.\"\n\nMy mind was made up.  The Canadian left me.  I went out on the platform,\nwhere I could barely stand upright against the jolts of the billows.\nThe skies were threatening, but land lay inside those dense mists,\nand we had to escape.  Not a single day, or even a single hour,\ncould we afford to lose.\n\nI returned to the lounge, dreading yet desiring an encounter\nwith Captain Nemo, wanting yet not wanting to see him.\nWhat would I say to him?  How could I hide the involuntary horror\nhe inspired in me?  No!  It was best not to meet him face to face!\nBest to try and forget him!  And yet . . . !\n\nHow long that day seemed, the last I would spend aboard\nthe Nautilus!  I was left to myself.  Ned Land and Conseil avoided\nspeaking to me, afraid they would give themselves away.\n\nAt six o'clock I ate supper, but I had no appetite.  Despite my revulsion,\nI forced it down, wanting to keep my strength up.\n\nAt 6:30 Ned Land entered my stateroom.  He told me:\n\n\"We won't see each other again before we go.  At ten o'clock\nthe moon won't be up yet.  We'll take advantage of the darkness.\nCome to the skiff.  Conseil and I will be inside waiting for you.\"\n\nThe Canadian left without giving me time to answer him.\n\nI wanted to verify the Nautilus's heading.  I made my way to the lounge.\nWe were racing north-northeast with frightful speed, fifty meters down.\n\nI took one last look at the natural wonders and artistic treasures\namassed in the museum, this unrivaled collection doomed to perish\nsomeday in the depths of the seas, together with its curator.\nI wanted to establish one supreme impression in my mind.\nI stayed there an hour, basking in the aura of the ceiling lights,\npassing in review the treasures shining in their glass cases.\nThen I returned to my stateroom.\n\nThere I dressed in sturdy seafaring clothes.  I gathered my notes and\npacked them tenderly about my person.  My heart was pounding mightily.\nI couldn't curb its pulsations.  My anxiety and agitation would\ncertainly have given me away if Captain Nemo had seen me.\n\nWhat was he doing just then?  I listened at the door to his stateroom.\nI heard the sound of footsteps.  Captain Nemo was inside.\nHe hadn't gone to bed.  With his every movement I imagined he would\nappear and ask me why I wanted to escape!  I felt in a perpetual\nstate of alarm.  My imagination magnified this sensation.\nThe feeling became so acute, I wondered whether it wouldn't be\nbetter to enter the captain's stateroom, dare him face to face,\nbrave it out with word and deed!\n\nIt was an insane idea.  Fortunately I controlled myself\nand stretched out on the bed to soothe my bodily agitation.\nMy nerves calmed a little, but with my brain so aroused,\nI did a swift review of my whole existence aboard the Nautilus,\nevery pleasant or unpleasant incident that had crossed my path since I\nwent overboard from the Abraham Lincoln:  the underwater hunting trip,\nthe Torres Strait, our running aground, the savages of Papua,\nthe coral cemetery, the Suez passageway, the island of Santorini,\nthe Cretan diver, the Bay of Vigo, Atlantis, the Ice Bank, the South Pole,\nour imprisonment in the ice, the battle with the devilfish,\nthe storm in the Gulf Stream, the Avenger, and that horrible scene\nof the vessel sinking with its crew . . . !  All these events passed\nbefore my eyes like backdrops unrolling upstage in a theater.\nIn this strange setting Captain Nemo then grew fantastically.\nHis features were accentuated, taking on superhuman proportions.\nHe was no longer my equal, he was the Man of the Waters, the Spirit\nof the Seas.\n\nBy then it was 9:30. I held my head in both hands to keep it\nfrom bursting.  I closed my eyes.  I no longer wanted to think.\nA half hour still to wait!  A half hour of nightmares that could\ndrive me insane!\n\nJust then I heard indistinct chords from the organ, melancholy harmonies\nfrom some undefinable hymn, actual pleadings from a soul trying\nto sever its earthly ties.  I listened with all my senses at once,\nbarely breathing, immersed like Captain Nemo in this musical trance\nthat was drawing him beyond the bounds of this world.\n\nThen a sudden thought terrified me.  Captain Nemo had left his stateroom.\nHe was in the same lounge I had to cross in order to escape.\nThere I would encounter him one last time.  He would see me,\nperhaps speak to me!  One gesture from him could obliterate me,\na single word shackle me to his vessel!\n\nEven so, ten o'clock was about to strike.  It was time to leave\nmy stateroom and rejoin my companions.\n\nI dared not hesitate, even if Captain Nemo stood before me.\nI opened the door cautiously, but as it swung on its hinges,\nit seemed to make a frightful noise.  This noise existed, perhaps,\nonly in my imagination!\n\nI crept forward through the Nautilus's dark gangways, pausing after\neach step to curb the pounding of my heart.\n\nI arrived at the corner door of the lounge.  I opened it gently.\nThe lounge was plunged in profound darkness.  Chords from the organ\nwere reverberating faintly.  Captain Nemo was there.  He didn't see me.\nEven in broad daylight I doubt that he would have noticed me,\nso completely was he immersed in his trance.\n\nI inched over the carpet, avoiding the tiniest bump whose noise\nmight give me away.  It took me five minutes to reach the door\nat the far end, which led into the library.\n\nI was about to open it when a gasp from Captain Nemo nailed\nme to the spot.  I realized that he was standing up.\nI even got a glimpse of him because some rays of light from\nthe library had filtered into the lounge.  He was coming toward me,\narms crossed, silent, not walking but gliding like a ghost.\nHis chest was heaving, swelling with sobs.  And I heard him murmur\nthese words, the last of his to reach my ears:\n\n\"O almighty God!  Enough!  Enough!\"\n\nWas it a vow of repentance that had just escaped from this\nman's conscience . . . ?\n\nFrantic, I rushed into the library.  I climbed the central companionway,\nand going along the upper gangway, I arrived at the skiff.\nI went through the opening that had already given access to\nmy two companions.\n\n\"Let's go, let's go!\"  I exclaimed.\n\n\"Right away!\" the Canadian replied.\n\nFirst, Ned Land closed and bolted the opening cut into the\nNautilus's sheet iron, using the monkey wrench he had with him.\nAfter likewise closing the opening in the skiff, the Canadian began\nto unscrew the nuts still bolting us to the underwater boat.\n\nSuddenly a noise from the ship's interior became audible.\nVoices were answering each other hurriedly.  What was it?\nHad they spotted our escape?  I felt Ned Land sliding a dagger\ninto my hand.\n\n\"Yes,\" I muttered, \"we know how to die!\"\n\nThe Canadian paused in his work.  But one word twenty times repeated,\none dreadful word, told me the reason for the agitation spreading\naboard the Nautilus.  We weren't the cause of the crew's concern.\n\n\"Maelstrom!  Maelstrom!\" they were shouting.\n\nThe Maelstrom!  Could a more frightening name have rung\nin our ears under more frightening circumstances?\nWere we lying in the dangerous waterways off the Norwegian coast?\nWas the Nautilus being dragged into this whirlpool just as the skiff\nwas about to detach from its plating?\n\nAs you know, at the turn of the tide, the waters confined between\nthe Faroe and Lofoten Islands rush out with irresistible violence.\nThey form a vortex from which no ship has ever been able to escape.\nMonstrous waves race together from every point of the horizon.\nThey form a whirlpool aptly called \"the ocean's navel,\"\nwhose attracting power extends a distance of fifteen kilometers.\nIt can suck down not only ships but whales, and even polar bears\nfrom the northernmost regions.\n\nThis was where the Nautilus had been sent accidentally--\nor perhaps deliberately--by its captain.  It was sweeping around\nin a spiral whose radius kept growing smaller and smaller.\nThe skiff, still attached to the ship's plating, was likewise\ncarried around at dizzying speed.  I could feel us whirling.\nI was experiencing that accompanying nausea that follows such\ncontinuous spinning motions.  We were in dread, in the last stages\nof sheer horror, our blood frozen in our veins, our nerves numb,\ndrenched in cold sweat as if from the throes of dying!\nAnd what a noise around our frail skiff!  What roars echoing from\nseveral miles away!  What crashes from the waters breaking against\nsharp rocks on the seafloor, where the hardest objects are smashed,\nwhere tree trunks are worn down and worked into \"a shaggy fur,\"\nas Norwegians express it!\n\nWhat a predicament!  We were rocking frightfully.  The Nautilus\ndefended itself like a human being.  Its steel muscles were cracking.\nSometimes it stood on end, the three of us along with it!\n\n\"We've got to hold on tight,\" Ned said, \"and screw the nuts down again!\nIf we can stay attached to the Nautilus, we can still make it . . . !\"\n\nHe hadn't finished speaking when a cracking sound occurred.\nThe nuts gave way, and ripped out of its socket, the skiff was hurled\nlike a stone from a sling into the midst of the vortex.\n\nMy head struck against an iron timber, and with this violent shock\nI lost consciousness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 23\n\nConclusion\n\n\nWE COME TO the conclusion of this voyage under the seas.\nWhat happened that night, how the skiff escaped from the Maelstrom's\nfearsome eddies, how Ned Land, Conseil, and I got out of that whirlpool,\nI'm unable to say.  But when I regained consciousness, I was lying\nin a fisherman's hut on one of the Lofoten Islands.  My two companions,\nsafe and sound, were at my bedside clasping my hands.\nWe embraced each other heartily.\n\nJust now we can't even dream of returning to France.  Travel between upper\nNorway and the south is limited.  So I have to wait for the arrival\nof a steamboat that provides bimonthly service from North Cape.\n\nSo it is here, among these gallant people who have taken us in,\nthat I'm reviewing my narrative of these adventures.  It is accurate.\nNot a fact has been omitted, not a detail has been exaggerated.\nIt's the faithful record of this inconceivable expedition into\nan element now beyond human reach, but where progress will someday\nmake great inroads.\n\nWill anyone believe me?  I don't know.  Ultimately it's unimportant.\nWhat I can now assert is that I've earned the right to speak\nof these seas, beneath which in less than ten months, I've cleared\n20,000 leagues in this underwater tour of the world that has\nshown me so many wonders across the Pacific, the Indian Ocean,\nthe Red Sea, the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, the southernmost\nand northernmost seas!\n\nBut what happened to the Nautilus?  Did it withstand\nthe Maelstrom's clutches?  Is Captain Nemo alive?\nIs he still under the ocean pursuing his frightful program\nof revenge, or did he stop after that latest mass execution?\nWill the waves someday deliver that manuscript that contains\nhis full life story?  Will I finally learn the man's name?\nWill the nationality of the stricken warship tell us the nationality\nof Captain Nemo?\n\nI hope so.  I likewise hope that his powerful submersible\nhas defeated the sea inside its most dreadful whirlpool,\nthat the Nautilus has survived where so many ships have perished!\nIf this is the case and Captain Nemo still inhabits the ocean--\nhis adopted country--may the hate be appeased in that fierce heart!\nMay the contemplation of so many wonders extinguish the spirit of\nvengeance in him!  May the executioner pass away, and the scientist\ncontinue his peaceful exploration of the seas!  If his destiny\nis strange, it's also sublime.  Haven't I encompassed it myself?\nDidn't I lead ten months of this otherworldly existence?\nThus to that question asked 6,000 years ago in the Book\nof Ecclesiastes--\"Who can fathom the soundless depths?\"--\ntwo men out of all humanity have now earned the right to reply.\nCaptain Nemo and I.\n\n\n\n\n\nEND OF THE SECOND PART\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg Etext of 20000 Leagues Under the Seas by\nJules Verne\n"}
