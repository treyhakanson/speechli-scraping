Pearly light sprang\nup on a square panel. Foster and I stared at it.\n\n\"What do you make of it?\" he said.\n\n\"I'm no expert on stone-age relics,\" I said. \"But if that's not a radar\nscreen, I'll eat it.\"\n\nI sat down in the single chair before the dusty control console, and\nwatched a red blip creep across the screen.\n\n\"That blip is either a mighty slow airplane--or it's at one hell of an\naltitude.\" I sat upright, eyes on the screen. \"Look at this, Foster,\"\nI snapped. A pattern of dots flashed across the screen, faded, flashed\nagain....\n\n\"I don't like that thing blinking at us,\" I said. \"It makes me feel\nconspicuous.\" I looked at the big red button beside the screen. \"Maybe\nif I pushed that....\" Without waiting to think it over, I jabbed at it.\n\n\"I'm not sure you should have done that,\" Foster said.\n\n\"There _is_ room for doubt,\" I said in a strained voice. \"It looks like\nI've launched a bomb from the ship overhead.\"\n\nA TRACE OF MEMORY\n\n\nLook for these other TOR books by Keith Laumer:\n\n\n    THE BREAKING EARTH\n    THE GLORY GAME\n    THE INFINITE CAGE\n    KNIGHT OF DELUSIONS\n    THE MONITORS\n    THE HOUSE IN NOVEMBER AND THE OTHER SKY\n    ONCE THERE WAS A GIANT\n    PLANET RUN\n    WORLDS OF THE IMPERIUM\n\n\n\n\nA TRACE OF MEMORY\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n\nHe awoke and lay for a moment looking up at a low ceiling, dimly\nvisible in a faint red glow, feeling the hard mat under his back. He\nturned his head, saw a wall and a panel on which a red indicator light\nglared.\n\nHe swung his legs over the side of the narrow couch and sat up. The\nroom was small, grey-painted, unadorned. Pain throbbed in his forearm.\nHe shook back the loose sleeve of the strange purple garment, saw a\npattern of tiny punctures in the skin. He recognized the mark of a\nfeeding Hunter.... Who would have dared?\n\nA dark shape on the floor caught his eye. He slid from the couch, knelt\nby the still body of a man in a purple tunic stained black with blood.\nGently he rolled the body onto its back.\n\nAmmaerln!\n\nHe seized the limp wrist. There was a faint pulse. He rose--and saw a\nsecond body and, near the door, two more. Quickly he went to each....\n\nAll three were dead, hideously slashed. Only Ammaerln still breathed,\nfaintly.\n\nHe went to the door, shouted into the darkness. The ranged shelves of\na library gave back a brief echo. He turned back to the grey-walled\nroom, noticed a recording monitor against a wall. He fitted the\nneurodes to the dying man's temples. But for this gesture of recording\nAmmaerln's life's memories, there was nothing he could do. He must get\nhim to a therapist--and quickly.\n\nHe crossed the library, found a great echoing hall beyond. This\nwas not the Sapphire Palace beside the Shallow Sea. The lines were\nunmistakeable: he was aboard a ship, a far-voyager. Why? How? He stood\nuncertain. The silence was absolute.\n\nHe crossed the Great Hall and entered the observation lounge. Here\nlay another dead man, by his uniform a member of the crew. He touched\na knob and the great screens glowed blue. A giant crescent swam into\nfocus, locked; soft blue against the black of space. Beyond it a\nsmaller companion hung, gray-blotched, airless. What worlds were these?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour later he had ranged the vast ship from end to end. In all,\nseven corpses, cruelly slashed, peopled the silent vessel. In the\ncontrol sector the communicator lights glowed, but to his call there\nwas no answer from the strange world below.\n\nHe turned to the recording room. Ammaerln still breathed weakly. The\nmemory recording had been completed; all that the dying man remembered\nof his long life was imprinted now in the silver cylinder. It remained\nonly to color-code the trace.\n\nHis eyes was caught by a small cylinder projecting from the aperture at\nthe side of the high couch where he had awakened his own memory-trace!\nSo he himself had undergone the Change. He took the color-banded\ncylinder, thrust it into a pocket--then whirled at a sound. A nest of\nHunters, swarming globes of pale light, clustered at the door. Then\nthey were on him. They pressed close, humming in their eagerness.\nWithout the proper weapon he was helpless.\n\nHe caught up the limp body of Ammaerln. With the Hunters trailing in a\nluminous stream he ran with his burden to the shuttle-boat bay.\n\nThree shuttles lay in their cradles. He groped to a switch, his head\nswimming with the sulphurous reek of the Hunters; light flooded the\nbay, driving them back. He entered the lifeboat, placed the dying man\non a cushioned couch.\n\nIt had been long since he had manned the controls of a ship, but he had\nnot forgotten.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAmmaerln was dead when the lifeboat reached the planetary surface. The\nvessel settled gently and the lock cycled. He looked out at a vista of\nragged forest.\n\nThis was no civilized world. Only the landing ring and the clearing\naround it showed the presence of man.\n\nThere was a hollow in the earth by a square marker block at the eastern\nperimeter of the clearing. He hoisted the body of Ammaerln to his back\nand moved heavily down the access ladder. Working bare-handed, he\ndeepened the hollow, placed the body in it, scraped earth over it. Then\nhe rose and turned back toward the shuttle boat.\n\nForty feet away, a dozen men, squat, bearded, wrapped in the shaggy\nhides of beasts, stood between him and the access ladder. The tallest\namong them shouted, raised a bronze sword threateningly. Behind these,\nothers clustered at the ladder. Motionless he watched as one scrambled\nup, reached the top, disappeared into the boat. In a moment the savage\nreappeared at the opening and hurled down handfuls of small bright\nobjects. Shouting, others clambered up to share the loot. The first man\nagain vanished within the boat. Before the foremost of the others had\ngained the entry, the port closed, shutting off a terrified cry from\nwithin.\n\nMen dropped from the ladder as it swung up. The boat rose slowly,\nangling toward the west, dwindling. The savages shrank back, awed.\n\nThe man watched until the tiny blue light was lost against the sky.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nThe ad read: _Soldier of fortune seeks companion in arms to share\nunusual adventure. Foster, Box 19, Mayport._\n\nI crumpled the newspaper and tossed it in the general direction of the\nwire basket beside the park bench, pushed back a slightly frayed cuff,\nand took a look at my bare wrist. It was just habit; the watch was in\na hock shop in Tupelo, Mississippi. It didn't matter. I didn't have to\nknow what time it was.\n\nAcross the park most of the store windows were dark along the side\nstreet. There were no people in sight; they were all home now, having\ndinner. As I watched, the lights blinked off in the drug store with the\nbottles of colored water in the window; the left the candy and cigar\nemporium at the end of the line. I fidgeted on the hard bench and felt\nfor a cigarette I didn't have. I wished the old boy back of the counter\nwould call it a day and go home. As soon as it was dark enough, I was\ngoing to rob his store.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI wasn't a full-time stick-up artist. Maybe that's why that nervous\nfeeling was playing around under my rib cage. There was really nothing\nto it. The wooden door with the hardware counter lock that would open\nalmost as easily without a key as with one; the sardine-can metal box\nwith the day's receipts in it. I'd be on my way to the depot with fare\nto Miami in my pocket ten minutes after I cracked the door. I'd learned\na lot harder tricks than petty larceny back when I had a big future\nahead with Army Intelligence. That was a long time ago, and I'd had a\nlot of breaks since then--none good.\n\nI got up and took another turn around the park. It was a warm evening,\nand the mosquitoes were out. I caught a whiff of frying hamburger from\nthe Elite Cafe down the street. It reminded me that I hadn't eaten\nlately. There were lights on at the Commercial Hotel and one in the\nticket office at the station. The local police force was still sitting\non a stool at the Rexall talking to the counter girl. I could see the\n.38 revolver hanging down in a worn leather holster at his hip. All of\na sudden, I was in a hurry to get it over with.\n\nI took another look at the lights. All the stores were dark now. There\nwas nothing to wait for. I crossed the street, sauntered past the cigar\nstore. There were dusty boxes of stogies in the window and piles of\nhomemade fudge stacked on plates with paper doilies under them. Behind\nthem, the interior of the store looked grim and dead. I looked around,\nthen turned down the side street toward the back door--\n\nA black sedan eased around the corner and pulled in to the curb. A face\nleaned over to look at me through lenses like the bottoms of tabasco\nbottles. The hot evening air stirred, and I felt my damp shirt cold\nagainst my back.\n\n\"Looking for anything in particular, Mister?\" the cop said.\n\nI just looked at him.\n\n\"Passing through town, are you?\" he asked.\n\nFor some reason I shook my head.\n\n\"I've got a job here,\" I said. \"I'm going to work--for Mr. Foster.\"\n\n\"What Mr. Foster?\" The cop's voice was wheezy, but relentless; a voice\nused to asking questions.\n\nI remembered the ad--something about an adventure; Foster, Box 19. The\ncop was still staring at me.\n\n\"Box nineteen,\" I said.\n\nHe looked me over some more, then reached across and opened the door.\n\"Better come on down to the station house with me, Mister,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt Police Headquarters, the cop motioned me to a chair, sat down behind\na desk, and pulled a phone to him. He dialed slowly, then swiveled his\nback to me to talk. Insects danced around the bare light bulb. There\nwas an odor of leather and unwashed bedding. I sat and listened to a\nradio in the distance wailing a sad song.\n\nIt was half an hour before I heard a car pull up outside. The man who\ncame through the door was wearing a light suit that was neither new\nnor freshly pressed, but had that look of perfect fit and taste that\nonly the most expensive tailoring can achieve. He moved in a relaxed\nway, but gave an impression of power held in reserve. At first glance I\nthought he was in his middle thirties, but when he looked my way I saw\nthe fine lines around the blue eyes. I got to my feet. He came over to\nme.\n\n\"I'm Foster,\" he said, and held out his hand. I shook it.\n\n\"My name is Legion,\" I said.\n\nThe desk sergeant spoke up. \"This fellow says he come here to Mayport\nto see you, Mr. Foster.\"\n\nFoster looked at me steadily. \"That's right, Sergeant. This gentleman\nis considering a proposition I've made.\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't know, Mr. Foster,\" the cop said.\n\n\"I quite understand, Sergeant,\" Foster said. \"We all feel better,\nknowing you're on the job.\"\n\n\"Well, you know,\" the cop said.\n\n\"We may as well be on our way then,\" Foster said. \"If you're ready, Mr.\nLegion.\"\n\n\"Sure, I'm ready,\" I said. Mr. Foster said goodnight to the cop and we\nwent out. On the pavement in front of the building I stopped.\n\n\"Thanks, Mr. Foster,\" I said. \"I'll comb myself out of your hair now.\"\n\nFoster had his hand on the door of a deceptively modest-looking\ncabriolet. I could smell the solid leather upholstery from where I\nstood.\n\n\"Why not come along to my place, Legion,\" he said. \"We might at least\ndiscuss my proposition.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"I'm not the man for the job, Mr. Foster,\" I said. \"If\nyou'd like to advance me a couple of bucks, I'll get myself a bite to\neat and fade right out of your life.\"\n\n\"What makes you so sure you're not interested?\"\n\n\"Your ad said something about adventure. I've had my adventures. Now\nI'm just looking for a hole to crawl into.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you, Legion.\" Foster smiled at me, a slow, calm smile.\n\"I think your adventures have hardly begun.\"\n\nI thought about it. If I went along, I'd at least get a meal--and maybe\neven a bed for the night. It was better than curling up under a tree.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"a remark like that demands time for an explanation.\" I\ngot into the car and sank back in a seat that seemed to fit me the way\nFoster's jacket fit him.\n\n\"I hope you won't mind if I drive fast,\" Foster said. \"I want to be\nhome before dark.\" We started up and wheeled away from the curb like a\ntorpedo sliding out of the launching tube.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI got out of the car in the drive at Foster's house, and looked around\nat the wide clipped lawn, the flower beds that were vivid even by\nmoonlight, the line of tall poplars and the big white house.\n\n\"I wish I hadn't come,\" I said. \"This kind of place reminds me of all\nthe things I haven't gotten out of life.\"\n\n\"Your life's still ahead of you,\" Foster said. He opened the slab of\nmahogany that was the front door, and I followed him inside. At the end\nof a short hall he flipped a switch that flooded the room before us\nwith soft light. I stared at an expanse of pale grey carpet about the\nsize of a tennis court, on which rested glowing Danish teak furniture\nupholstered in rich colors. The walls were a rough-textured grey; here\nand there were expensively framed abstractions. The air was cool with\nthe heavy coolness of air conditioning. Foster crossed to a bar that\nlooked modest in the setting, in spite of being bigger than those in\nmost of the places I'd seen lately.\n\n\"Would you care for a drink?\" he said.\n\nI looked down at my limp, stained suit and grimy cuffs.\n\n\"Look, Mr. Foster,\" I said. \"I just realized something. If you've got a\nstable, I'll go sleep in it--\"\n\nFoster laughed. \"Come on; I'll show you the bath.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI came downstairs, clean, showered, and wearing a set of Foster's\nclothes. I found him sitting, sipping a drink and listening to music.\n\n\"The _Liebestodt_,\" I said. \"A little gloomy, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I read something else into it,\" Foster said. \"Sit down and have a bite\nto eat and a drink.\"\n\nI sat in one of the big soft chairs and tried not to let my hand shake\nas I reached for one of the sandwiches piled on the coffee table.\n\n\"Tell me something, Mr. Legion,\" Foster said. \"Why did you come here,\nmention my name--if you didn't intend to see me?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"It just worked out that way.\"\n\n\"Tell me something about yourself,\" Foster said.\n\n\"It's not much of a story.\"\n\n\"Still, I'd like to hear it.\"\n\n\"Well, I was born, grew up, went to school----\"\n\n\"What school?\"\n\n\"University of Illinois.\"\n\n\"What was your major?\"\n\n\"Music.\"\n\nFoster looked at me, frowning slightly.\n\n\"It's the truth,\" I said. \"I wanted to be a conductor. The army\nhad other ideas. I was in my last year when the draft got me. They\ndiscovered I had what they considered an aptitude for intelligence\nwork. I didn't mind it. I had a pretty good time for a couple of years.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" Foster said. Well, I'd had a bath and a good meal. I owed him\nsomething. If he wanted to hear my troubles, why not tell him?\n\n\"I was putting on a demonstration. A defective timer set off a charge\nof H-E fifty seconds early on a one-minute setting. A student was\nkilled; I got off easy with a busted eardrum and a pound or two of\ngravel imbedded in my back. When I got out of the hospital, the army\nfelt real bad about letting me go--but they did. My terminal leave pay\ngave me a big weekend in San Francisco and set me up in business as a\nprivate investigator.\n\n\"I had enough left over after the bankruptcy proceedings a few months\nlater to get me to Las Vegas. I lost what was left and took a job with\na casino operator named Gonino.\n\n\"I stayed with Gonino for nearly a year. Then one night a visiting bank\nclerk lost his head and shot him eight times with a .22 target pistol.\nI left town the same night.\n\n\"After that I sold used cars for a couple of months in Memphis; then I\nmade like a life guard at Daytona; baited hooks on a thirty-foot tuna\nboat out of Key West; all the odd jobs with low pay and no future. I\nspent a couple of years in Cuba; all I got out of that was two bullet\nscars on the left leg, and a prominent position on a CIA blacklist.\n\n\"After that things got tough. A man in my trade can't really hope to\nsucceed in a big way without the little blue card in the plastic cover\nto back his play. I was headed south for the winter, and I picked\nMayport to run out of money.\"\n\nI stood up. \"I sure enjoyed the bath, Mr. Foster, and the meal,\ntoo--I'd like real well to get into that bed upstairs and have a\nnight's sleep just to make it complete; but I'm not interested in the\njob.\" I turned away and started across the room.\n\n\"Legion,\" Foster said. I turned. A beer bottle was hanging in the air\nin front of my face. I put a hand up fast and the bottle slapped my\npalm.\n\n\"Not bad set of reflexes for a man whose adventures are all behind\nhim,\" Foster said.\n\nI tossed the bottle aside. \"If I'd missed, that would have knocked my\nteeth out,\" I said angrily.\n\n\"You didn't miss--even though you're weaving a little from the beer.\nAnd a man who can feel a pint or so of beer isn't an alcoholic--so\nyou're clean on that score.\"\n\n\"I didn't say I was ready for the rummy ward,\" I said. \"I'm just not\ninterested in your proposition--whatever it is.\"\n\n\"Legion,\" Foster said, \"maybe you have the idea I put that ad in the\npaper last week on a whim. The fact is, I've been running it--in one\nform or another--for over eight years.\"\n\nI looked at him and waited.\n\n\"Not only locally--I've run it in the big-city papers, and in some of\nthe national weekly and monthly publications. All together, I've had\nperhaps fifty responses.\"\n\nFoster smiled wryly. \"About three quarters of them were from women who\nthought I wanted a playmate. Several more were from men with the same\nidea. The few others were hopelessly unsuitable.\"\n\n\"That's surprising,\" I said. \"I'd have thought you'd have brought half\nthe nuts in the country out of the woodwork by now.\"\n\nFoster looked at me, not smiling. I realized suddenly that behind the\nurbane fa\u00e7ade there was a hint of tension, a trace of worry in the\nlevel blue eyes.\n\n\"I'd like very much to interest you in what I have to say, Legion. I\nthink you lack only one thing--confidence in yourself.\"\n\nI laughed shortly. \"What are the qualifications you think I have? I'm a\njack of no trades----\"\n\n\"Legion, you're a man of considerable intelligence and more than a\nlittle culture; you've travelled widely and know how to handle yourself\nin difficult situations--or you wouldn't have survived. I'm sure your\ntraining includes techniques of entry and fact-gathering not known to\nthe average man; and perhaps most important, although you're an honest\nman, you're capable of breaking the law--when necessary.\"\n\n\"So that's it,\" I said.\n\n\"No, I'm not forming a mob, Legion. As I said in the ad--this is an\nunusual adventure. It may--probably will--involve infringing various\nstatutes and regulations of one sort or another. After you know the\nfull story I'll leave you to judge whether it's justifiable.\"\n\nIf Foster was trying to arouse my curiosity, he was succeeding. He was\ndead serious about whatever it was he was planning. It sounded like\nsomething no one with good sense would want to get involved in--but on\nthe other hand, Foster didn't look like the sort of man to do anything\nfoolish....\n\n\"Why don't you tell me what this is all about?\" I said. \"Why would a\nman with all this--\" I waved a hand at the luxurious room--\"want to\npick a hobo like me out of the gutter and talk him into taking a job?\"\n\n\"Your ego has taken a severe beating, Legion--that's obvious. I think\nyou're afraid that I'll expect too much of you--or that I'll be shocked\nby some disclosure you may make. Perhaps if you'd forget yourself and\nyour problems for the moment, we could reach an understanding----\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"Just forget my problems....\"\n\n\"Chiefly money problems, of course. Most of the problems of this\nsociety involve the abstraction of values that money represents.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said. \"I've got my problems, you've got yours. Let's leave it\nat that.\"\n\n\"You feel that because I have material comfort, my problems must of\nnecessity be trivial ones,\" Foster said. \"Tell me, Mr. Legion: have you\never known a man who suffered from amnesia?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFoster crossed the room to a small writing desk, took something from a\ndrawer, then looked at me.\n\n\"I'd like you to examine this,\" he said.\n\nI went over and took the object from his hand. It was a small book,\nwith a cover of drab-colored plastic, unornamented except for an\nembossed design of two concentric rings. I opened the cover. The pages\nwere as thin as tissue, but opaque, and covered with extremely fine\nwriting in strange foreign characters. The last dozen pages were in\nEnglish. I had to hold the book close to my eyes to read the minute\nscript:\n\n_January 19, 1710. Having come nigh to calamity with the near lofs[1]\nof the key, I will henceforth keep this journal in the English\ntongue...._\n\n[Footnote 1: Transcriber's Note: Sections of this text used \"long s\"\ntypeface. Text left as printed with the letter \"f\" substituted for the\n\"long s\".]\n\n\"If this is an explanation of something, it's too subtle for me,\" I\nsaid.\n\n\"Legion, how old would you say I am?\"\n\n\"That's a hard one,\" I said. \"When I first saw you I would have said\nthe late thirties, maybe. Now, frankly, you look closer to fifty.\"\n\n\"I can show you proof,\" Foster said, \"that I spent the better part of a\nyear in a military hospital in France. I awakened in a ward, bandaged\nto the eyes, and with no memories whatever of my life before that day.\nAccording to the records made at the time, I appeared to be about\nthirty years of age.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"amnesia's not so unusual among war casualties, and you\nseem to have done pretty well since.\"\n\nFoster shook his head impatiently. \"There's nothing difficult about\nacquiring material wealth in this society, though the effort kept me\nwell occupied for a number of years--and diverted my thoughts from\nthe question of my past life. The time came, however, when I had the\nleisure to pursue the matter. The clues I had were meagre enough; the\nnotebook I've shown you was found near me, and I had a ring on my\nfinger.\" Foster held out his hand. On the middle finger was a massive\nsignet, engraved with the same design of concentric circles I had seen\non the cover of the notebook.\n\n\"I was badly burned; my clothing was charred. Oddly enough, the\nnotebook was quite unharmed, though it was found among burned debris.\nIt's made of very tough stuff.\"\n\n\"What did you find out?\"\n\n\"In a word--nothing. No military unit claimed me. I spoke English, from\nwhich it was deduced that I was English or American----\"\n\n\"They couldn't tell which, from your accent?\"\n\n\"Apparently not; it appears I spoke a sort of hybrid dialect.\"\n\n\"Maybe you're lucky. I'd be happy to forget my first thirty years.\"\n\n\"I spent a considerable sum of money in my attempts to discover my\npast,\" Foster went on. \"And several years of time. In the end I gave it\nup. And it wasn't until then that I found the first faint inkling.\"\n\n\"So you did find something,\" I said.\n\n\"Nothing I hadn't had all along. The notebook.\"\n\n\"I'd have thought you would have read that before you did anything\nelse,\" I said. \"Don't tell me you put it in the bureau drawer and\nforgot it.\"\n\n\"I read it, of course--what I could read of it. Only a relatively small\nsection is in English. The rest is a cipher. And what I read seemed\nmeaningless--quite unrelated to me. You've glanced through it; it's no\nmore than a journal, irregularly kept, and so cryptic as to be little\nbetter than a code itself. And of course the dates; they range from the\nearly eighteenth century through the early twentieth.\"\n\n\"A sort of family record, maybe,\" I said. \"Carried on generation after\ngeneration. Didn't it mention any names, or places?\"\n\n\"Look at it again, Legion,\" Foster said. \"See if you notice anything\nodd--other than what we've already discussed.\"\n\nI thumbed through the book again. It was no more than an inch thick,\nbut it was heavy--surprisingly heavy. There were a lot of pages--I\nshuffled through hundreds of closely written sheets, and yet the book\nwas less than half used. I read bits here and there:\n\n_\"May 4, 1746. The Voyage was not a Succefs. I must forsake this avenue\nof Enquiry...._\"\n\n\"_October 23, 1790. Builded the weft Barrier a cubit higher. Now\nthe fires burn every night. Is there no limit to their infernal\nperfiftence?_\"\n\n\"_January 19, 1831. I have great hopes for the Philadelphia enterprise.\nMy greatest foe is impatience. All preparations for the Change are\nmade, yet I confefs I am uneasy...._\"\n\n\"There are plenty of oddities,\" I said. \"Aside from the entries\nthemselves. This is supposed to be old--but the quality of the paper\nand binding beats anything I've seen. And that handwriting is pretty\nfancy for a quill pen----\"\n\n\"There's a stylus clipped to the spine of the book,\" Foster said. \"It\nwas written with that.\"\n\nI looked, pulled out a slim pen, then looked at Foster. \"Speaking of\nodd,\" I said. \"A genuine antique early colonial ball-point pen doesn't\nturn up every day----\"\n\n\"Suspend your judgement until you've seen it all,\" Foster said.\n\n\"And two hundred years on one refill--that's not bad.\" I riffled\nthrough the pages, then I tossed the book onto the table. \"Who's\nkidding who, Foster?\" I said.\n\n\"The book was described in detail in the official record, of which I\nhave copies. They mention the paper and binding, the stylus, even quote\nsome of the entries. The authorities worked over it pretty closely,\ntrying to identify me. They reached the same conclusion as you--that it\nwas the work of a crackpot; but they saw the same book you're looking\nat now.\"\n\n\"So what? So it was faked up some time during the war--what does that\nprove? I'm ready to concede it's forty years old----\"\n\n\"You don't understand, Legion,\" Foster said. \"I told you I woke up in\na military hospital in France. But it was an AEF hospital and the year\nwas 1918.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nI glanced sideways at Foster. He didn't look like a nut....\n\n\"All I've got to say is,\" I said, \"you're a hell of a spry-looking\nninety.\"\n\n\"You find my appearance strangely youthful. What would be your reaction\nif I told you that I've aged greatly in the past few months? That\na year ago I could have passed as no older than thirty without the\nslightest difficulty----\"\n\n\"I don't think I'd believe you,\" I said. \"And I'm sorry, Mr. Foster;\nbut I don't believe the bit about the 1918 hospital either. How can I?\nIt's----\"\n\n\"I know. Fantastic. But let's go back a moment to the book itself. Look\nclosely at the paper; it's been examined by experts. They're baffled by\nit. Attempts to analyze it chemically failed--they were unable to take\na sample. It's impervious to solvents----\"\n\n\"They couldn't get a sample?\" I said. \"Why not just tear off the corner\nof one of the sheets?\"\n\n\"Try it,\" Foster said.\n\nI picked up the book and plucked at the edge of one of the blank\nsheets, then pinched harder and pulled. The paper held. I got a better\ngrip and pulled again. It was like fine, tough leather, except that it\ndidn't even stretch.\n\n\"It's tough, all right,\" I said. I took out my pocket knife and opened\nit and worked on the edge of the paper. Nothing. I went over to the\nbureau and put the paper flat against the top and sawed at it, putting\nmy weight on the knife. I raised the knife and brought it down hard. I\ndidn't so much as mark the sheet. I put the knife away.\n\n\"That's some paper, Mr. Foster,\" I said.\n\n\"Try to tear the binding,\" Foster said. \"Put a match to it. Shoot at\nit if you like. Nothing will make an impression on that material. Now,\nyou're a logical man, Legion. Is there something here outside ordinary\nexperience or is there not?\"\n\nI sat down, feeling for a cigarette. I still didn't have.\n\n\"What does it prove?\" I said.\n\n\"Only that the book is not a simple fraud. You're facing something\nwhich can't be dismissed as fancy. The book exists. That is our basic\npoint of departure.\"\n\n\"Where do we go from there?\"\n\n\"There is a second factor to be considered,\" Foster went on. \"At some\ntime in the past I seem to have made an enemy. Someone, or something,\nis systematically hunting me.\"\n\nI tried a laugh, but it felt out of place. \"Why not sit still and let\nit catch up with you? Maybe it could tell you what the whole thing is\nabout.\"\n\nFoster shook his head. \"It started almost thirty years ago,\" he said.\n\"I was driving south from Albany, New York, at night. It was a long\nstraight stretch of road, no houses. I noticed lights following me. Not\nheadlights--something that bobbed along, off in the fields along the\nroad. But they kept pace, gradually moving alongside. Then they closed\nin ahead, keeping out of range of my headlights. I stopped the car. I\nwasn't seriously alarmed, just curious. I wanted a better look, so I\nswitched on my spotlight and played it on the lights. They disappeared\nas the light touched them. After half a dozen were gone, the rest began\nclosing in. I kept picking them off. There was a sound, too, a sort of\nhigh-pitched humming. I caught a whiff of sulphur then, and suddenly\nI was afraid--deathly afraid. I caught the last one in the beam no\nmore than ten feet from the car. I can't describe the horror of the\nmoment----\"\n\n\"It sounds pretty weird,\" I said. \"But what was there to be afraid of?\nIt must have been some kind of heat lightning.\"\n\n\"There is always the pat explanation,\" Foster said. \"But no explanation\ncan rationalize the instinctive dread I felt. I started up the car\nand drove on--right through the night and the next day. I sensed that\nI must put distance between myself and whatever it was I had met. I\nbought a home in California and tried to put the incident out of my\nmind--with limited success. Then it happened again.\"\n\n\"The same thing? Lights?\"\n\n\"It was more sophisticated the next time. It started with\ninterference--static--on my radio. Then it affected the wiring in the\nhouse. All the lights began to glow weakly, even though they were\nswitched off. I could feel it--feel it in my bones--moving closer,\nhemming me in. I tried the car; it wouldn't start. Fortunately, I kept\na few horses at that time. I mounted and rode into town--and at a fair\ngallop, you may be sure. I saw the lights, but outdistanced them. I\ncaught a train and kept going.\"\n\n\"I don't see----\"\n\n\"It happened again; four times in all. I thought perhaps I had\nsucceeded in eluding it at last. I was mistaken. I have had definite\nindications that my time here is drawing to a close. I would have been\ngone before now, but there were certain arrangements to be made.\"\n\n\"Look,\" I said. \"This is all wrong. You need a psychiatrist, not an\nex-tough guy. Delusions of persecution----\"\n\n\"It seemed obvious that the explanation was to be found somewhere in my\npast life,\" Foster went on. \"I turned to the notebook, my only link.\nI copied it out, including the encrypted portion. I had photostatic\nenlargements made of the initial section--the part written in\nunfamiliar characters. None of the experts who have examined the script\nhave been able to identify it.\n\n\"I necessarily, therefore, concentrated my attention on the last\nsection--the only part written in English. I was immediately struck by\na curious fact I had ignored before. The writer made references to an\nEnemy, a mysterious 'they', against which defensive measures had to be\ntaken.\"\n\n\"Maybe that's where you got the idea,\" I said. \"When you first read the\nbook----\"\n\n\"The writer of the log,\" Foster said, \"was dogged by the same nemesis\nthat now follows me.\"\n\n\"It doesn't make any sense,\" I said.\n\n\"For the moment,\" Foster said, \"stop looking for logic in the\nsituation. Look for a pattern instead.\"\n\n\"There's a pattern, all right,\" I said.\n\n\"The next thing that struck me,\" Foster went on, \"was a reference to a\nloss of memory--a second point of some familiarity to me. The writer\nexpresses frustration at the inability to remember certain facts which\nwould have been useful to him in his pursuit.\"\n\n\"What kind of pursuit?\"\n\n\"Some sort of scientific project, as nearly as I can gather. The\njournal bristles with tantalizing references to matters that are never\nexplained.\"\n\n\"And you think the man that wrote it had amnesia?\"\n\n\"Not exactly amnesia, perhaps,\" Foster said. \"But there were things he\nwas unable to remember.\"\n\n\"If that's amnesia, we've all got it,\" I said. \"Nobody's got a perfect\nmemory.\"\n\n\"But these were matters of importance; not the kinds of thing that\nsimply slip one's mind.\"\n\n\"I can see how you'd want to believe the book had something to do with\nyour past, Mr. Foster,\" I said. \"It must be a hard thing, not knowing\nyour own life story. But you're on the wrong track. Maybe the book is a\nstory you started to write--in code, so nobody would accidentally read\nthe stuff and kid you about it.\"\n\n\"Legion, what was it you planned to do when you got to Miami?\"\n\nThe question caught me a little off-guard. \"Well, I don't know,\" I\nhedged. \"I wanted to get south, where it's warm. I used to know a few\npeople----\"\n\n\"In other words, nothing,\" Foster said. \"Legion, I'll pay you well to\nstay with me and see this thing through.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"Not me, Mr. Foster. The whole thing sounds--well,\nthe kindest word I can think of is 'nutty.'\"\n\n\"Legion,\" Foster said, \"do you really believe I'm insane?\"\n\n\"Let's just say this all seems a little screwy to me, Mr. Foster.\"\n\n\"I'm not asking you just to work for me,\" Foster said. \"I'm asking for\nyour help.\"\n\n\"You might as well look for your fortune in tea leaves,\" I said,\nirritated. \"There's nothing in what you've told me.\"\n\n\"There's more, Legion. Much more. I've recently made an important\ndiscovery. When I know you're with me, I'll tell you. You know enough\nnow to accept the fact that this isn't entirely a figment of my\nimagination.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything,\" I said. \"So far it's all talk.\"\n\n\"If you're concerned about payment----\"\n\n\"No, damn it,\" I barked. \"Where are the papers you keep talking about?\nI ought to have my head examined for sitting here humoring you. I've\ngot troubles enough----\" I stopped talking and rubbed my hands over my\nscalp. \"I'm sorry, Mr. Foster,\" I said. \"I guess what's really griping\nme is that you've got everything I think I want--and you're not content\nwith it. It bothers me to see you off chasing fairies. If a man with\nhis health and plenty of money can't enjoy life, what the hell is there\nfor anybody?\"\n\nFoster looked at me thoughtfully. \"Legion, if you could have anything\nin life you wanted, what would you ask for?\"\n\n\"Anything? I've wanted a lot of different things. Once I wanted to be\na hero. Later, I wanted to be smart, know all the answers. Then I had\nthe idea that a chance to do an honest job, one that needed doing, was\nthe big thing. I never found that job. I never got smart either, or\nfigured out how to tell a hero from a coward, without a program.\"\n\n\"In other words,\" Foster said, \"you were looking for an abstraction\nto believe in--in this case, Justice. But you won't find justice in\nnature. It's a thing that only man expects or acknowledges.\"\n\n\"There are some good things in life; I'd like to get a piece of them.\"\n\n\"Don't lose your capacity for dreaming, in the process.\"\n\n\"Dreams?\" I said. \"Oh, I've got those. I want an island somewhere in\nthe sun, where I can spend my time fishing and watching the sea.\"\n\n\"You're speaking cynically--but you're still attempting to concretize\nan abstraction,\" Foster said. \"But no matter--materialism is simply\nanother form of idealism.\"\n\nI looked at Foster. \"But I know I'll never have those things--or that\nJustice you were talking about, either. Once you really know you'll\nnever make it....\"\n\n\"Perhaps unattainability is an essential element of any dream,\" Foster\nsaid. \"But hold onto your dream, whatever it is--don't ever give it up.\"\n\n\"So much for philosophy,\" I said. \"Where is it getting us?\"\n\n\"You'd like to see the papers,\" Foster said. He fished a key ring from\nan inner pocket. \"If you don't mind going out to the car,\" he said,\n\"and perhaps getting your hands dirty, there's a strong-box welded\nto the frame. I keep photostats of everything there, along with my\npassport, emergency funds and so on. I've learned to be ready to\ntravel on very short notice. Lift the floorboards; you'll see the box.\"\n\n\"It's not all that urgent,\" I said. \"I'll take a look in the\nmorning--after I've caught up on some sleep. But don't get the wrong\nidea--it's just my knot-headed curiosity.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Foster said. He lay back, sighed. \"I'm tired, Legion,\" he\nsaid. \"My mind is tired.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said, \"so is mine--not to mention other portions of my\nanatomy.\"\n\n\"Get some sleep,\" Foster said. \"We'll talk again in the morning.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI pushed back the light blanket and slid out of bed. Underfoot, the rug\nwas as thick and soft as a working girl's mink. I went across to the\ncloset and pushed the button that made the door slide aside. My old\nclothes were still lying on the floor where I had left them, but I had\nthe clean ones Foster had lent me. He wouldn't mind if I borrowed them\nfor a while longer--it would be cheaper for him in the long run. Foster\nwas as looney as a six-day bike racer, but there was no point in my\nwaiting around to tell him so.\n\nThe borrowed outfit didn't include a coat. I thought of putting my\nold jacket on but it was warm outside and a grey pin-stripe with\ngrease spots wouldn't help the picture any. I transferred my personal\nbelongings from the grimy clothes on the floor, and eased the door open.\n\nDownstairs, the curtains were drawn in the living room. I could vaguely\nmake out the outline of the bar. It wouldn't hurt to take along a bite\nto eat. I groped my way behind the bar, felt along the shelves, found\na stack of small cans that rattled softly. Nuts, probably. I reached to\nput a can on the bar and it clattered against something I couldn't see.\nI swore silently, felt over the obstruction. It was bulky, with the\ncold smoothness of metal, and there were small projections with sharp\ncorners. It felt for all the world like----\n\nI leaned over it and squinted. With the faint gleam of moonlight from\na chink in the heavy curtains falling just so, I could almost make\nout the shape; I crouched a little lower, and caught the glint of\nlight along the perforated jacket of a .30 calibre machine gun. My eye\nfollowed the barrel, made out the darker square of the entrance hall,\nand the tiny reflection of light off the polished brass doorknob at the\nfar end.\n\nI stepped back, flattened against the wall, with a hollow feeling\ninside. If I had tried to walk through that door....\n\nFoster was crazy enough for two ordinary nuts. My eyes flicked around\nthe room. I had to get out quickly before he jumped out and said _Boo!_\nand I died of heart failure. The windows, maybe. I came around the end\nof the bar, got down and crawled under the barrel of the gun and over\nto the heavy drapes, pushing them aside. Pale light glowed beyond the\nglass. Not the soft light of the moon, but a milky, churning glow that\nreminded me of the phosphorescence of sea water....\n\nI dropped the curtain, ducked back under the gun into the hall, and\npushed through a swinging door into the kitchen. There was a faint\nglow from the luminous handle of the refrigerator. I yanked it open,\nspilling light on the floor, and looked around. Plenty of gleaming\nwhite fixtures--but no door out. There was a window, almost obscured\nby leaves. I eased it open and almost broke my fist on a wrought-iron\ntrellis.\n\nBack in the hall, I tried two more doors, both locked. A third opened,\nand I found myself looking down the cellar stairs. They were steep and\ndark as cellar stairs always seem to be, but they might be the way out.\nI felt for a light switch, flipped it on. A weak illumination showed me\na patch of damp-looking floor at the foot of the steps. It still wasn't\ninviting, but I went down.\n\nThere was an oil furnace in the center of the room, with dusty\nduct-work spidering out across the ceiling; some heavy packing cases\nof rough wood were stacked along one wall, and at the far side of the\nroom, there was a boarded-up coal bin--but no cellar door.\n\nI turned to go back up. Then I heard a sound and froze. Somewhere a\ncockroach scuttled briefly. Then I heard the sound again, a faint\ngrinding of stone against stone. I peered through the cob-webbed\nshadows, my mouth suddenly dry. There was nothing.\n\nThe thing for me to do was to get up the stairs fast, batter the iron\ntrellis out of the kitchen window, and run like hell. The trouble was,\nI had to move to do it, and the sound of my own steps was so loud it\nwas paralyzing. Compared to this, the shock of stumbling over the gun\nwas just a mild kick, like finding a whistle in your Cracker-jacks.\nOrdinarily I didn't believe in things that went bump in the night,\nbut this time I was hearing the bumps myself, and all I could think\nabout was Edgar Allen Poe and his cheery tales about people who got\nthemselves buried before they were thoroughly dead.\n\nThere was another sound, then a sharp snap, and I saw light spring up\nfrom a crack that opened across the floor in the shadowy corner. That\nwas enough for me. I jumped for the stairs, took them three at a time,\nand banged through the kitchen door. I grabbed up a chair, swung it\naround and slammed it against the trellis. It bounced back and cracked\nme across the mouth. I dropped it, tasting blood. Maybe that was what\nI needed. The panic faded before a stronger emotion--anger. I turned\nand barged along the dark hall to the living room--and lights suddenly\nwent on. I whirled and saw Foster standing in the hall doorway, fully\ndressed.\n\n\"OK, Foster!\" I yelled. \"Just show me the way out of here.\"\n\nFoster held my eyes, his face tense. \"Calm yourself, Mr. Legion,\" he\nsaid softly. \"What's happened here?\"\n\n\"Get over there to that gun,\" I snapped, nodding toward the .30 calibre\non the bar. \"Disarm it, and then get the front door open. I'm leaving.\"\n\nFoster's eyes flicked over the clothes I was wearing.\n\n\"So I see,\" he said. He looked me in the face again. \"What is it that's\nfrightened you, Legion?\"\n\n\"Don't act so innocent,\" I said. \"Or am I supposed to get the idea the\nbrownies set up that booby trap while you were asleep?\"\n\nHis eyes went to the gun and his expression tightened. \"It's mine,\" he\nsaid. \"It's an automatic arrangement. Something's activated it--and\nwithout sounding my alarm. You haven't been outside, have you?\"\n\n\"How could I----\"\n\n\"This is important, Legion,\" Foster rapped. \"It would take more than\nthe sight of a machine gun to panic you. What have you seen?\"\n\n\"I was looking for a back door,\" I said. \"I went down to the cellar. I\ndidn't like it down there so I came back up.\"\n\n\"What did you see in the cellar?\" Foster's face looked strained,\ncolorless.\n\n\"It looked like ...\" I hesitated. \"There was a crack in the floor,\nnoises, lights....\"\n\n\"The floor,\" Foster said. \"Certainly. That's the weak point.\" He seemed\nto be talking to himself.\n\nI jerked a thumb over my shoulder. \"Something funny going on outside\nyour windows, too.\"\n\nFoster looked toward the heavy hangings. \"Listen carefully, Legion,\"\nhe said. \"We are in grave danger--both of us. It's fortunate you arose\nwhen you did. This house, as you must have guessed by now, is something\nof a fortress. At this moment, it is under attack. The walls are\nprotected by some rather formidable defenses. I can't say as much for\nthe cellar floor; it's merely three feet of ferro-concrete. We'll have\nto go now--very swiftly, and very quietly.\"\n\n\"OK--show me,\" I said. Foster turned and went back along the hall to\none of the locked doors where he pressed something. The door opened and\nI followed him inside a small room. He crossed to a blank wall, pressed\nagainst it. A panel slid aside--and Foster jumped back.\n\n\"God's wounds!\" he gasped. He threw himself at the wall and the panel\nclosed. I stood stock still; from somewhere there was a smell like\nsulphur.\n\n\"What the hell goes on?\" I said. My voice cracked, as it always does\nwhen I'm scared.\n\n\"That odor,\" Foster said. \"Quickly--the other way!\"\n\nI stepped back and Foster pushed past me and ran along the hall, with\nme at his heels. I didn't look back to see what was at my own heels.\nFoster took the stairs three at a time, pulled up short on the landing.\nHe went to his knees, shoved back an Isfahan rug as supple as sable,\nand gripped a steel ring set in the floor. He looked at me, his face\nwhite.\n\n\"Invoke thy gods,\" he said hoarsely, and heaved at the ring. A section\nof floor swung up, showing the first step of a flight leading down into\na black hole. Foster didn't hesitate; he dropped his feet in, scrambled\ndown. I followed. The stairs went down about ten feet, ending on a\nstone floor. There was the sound of a latch turning, and we stepped out\ninto a larger room. I saw moonlight through a row of high windows, and\nsmelled the fragrance of fresh night air.\n\n\"We're in the garage,\" Foster whispered. \"Go around to the other side\nof the car and get in--quietly.\" I touched the smooth flank of the\nrakish cabriolet, felt my way around it, and eased the door open. I\nslipped into the seat and closed the door gently. Beside me, Foster\ntouched a button and a green light glowed on the dash.\n\n\"Ready?\" he said.\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\nThe starter whined half a turn and the engine caught. Without waiting,\nFoster gunned it, let in the clutch. The car leaped for the closed\ndoors, and I ducked, and then saw the doors snap aside as the low-slung\ncar roared out into the night. We took the first turn in the drive at\nforty, and rounded onto the highway at sixty, tires screaming. I took a\nlook back and caught a glimpse of the house, its stately fa\u00e7ade white\nin the moonlight--and then we were out of sight over a rise.\n\n\"What's it all about?\" I called over the rush of air. The needle\ntouched ninety, kept going.\n\n\"Later,\" Foster barked. I didn't feel like arguing. I watched in the\nmirror for a few minutes, wondering where all the cops were tonight.\nThen I settled down in the padded seat and watched the speedometer eat\nup the miles.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nIt was nearly four-thirty and a tentative grey streak showed through\nthe palm fronds to the east before I broke the silence.\n\n\"By the way,\" I said. \"What was the routine with the steel shutters,\nand the bullet-proof glass in the kitchen, and the handy home-model\nmachine gun covering the front door? Mice bad around the place, are\nthey?\"\n\n\"Those things were necessary--and more.\"\n\n\"Now that the short hairs along my spine have relaxed,\" I said, \"the\nwhole thing looks pretty silly. We've run far enough now to be able to\nstop and turn around and stick our tongues out.\"\n\n\"Not yet--not for a long while yet.\"\n\n\"Why don't we just go back home,\" I went on, \"and----\"\n\n\"No!\" Foster said sharply. \"I want your word on that, Legion. No matter\nwhat--don't ever go near that house again.\"\n\n\"It'll be daylight soon,\" I said. \"We'll feel pretty asinine about\nthis little trip after the sun comes up, but don't worry, I won't tell\nanybody----\"\n\n\"We've got to keep moving,\" Foster said. \"At the next town, I'll\ntelephone for seats on a flight out of Miami.\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" I said. \"You're raving. What about your house? We didn't\neven stick around long enough to make sure the TV was turned off. And\nwhat about passports, and money, and luggage? And what makes you think\nI'm going with you?\"\n\n\"I've kept myself in readiness for this emergency,\" Foster said. \"There\nare disposition instructions for the house on file with a legal firm\nin Jacksonville. There is nothing to connect me with my former life,\nonce I've changed my name and disappeared. As for the rest--we can buy\nluggage in the morning. My passport is in the car; perhaps we'd better\ngo first to Puerto Rico, until we can arrange for one for you.\"\n\n\"Look,\" I said. \"I got spooked in the dark, that's all. Why not just\nadmit we made fools of ourselves?\"\n\nFoster shook his head. \"The inherent inertia of the human mind,\" he\nsaid. \"How it fights to resist new ideas.\"\n\n\"The kind of new ideas you're talking about could get both of us locked\nup in the chuckle ward,\" I said.\n\n\"Legion,\" Foster said, \"I think you'd better write down what I'm going\nto tell you. It's important--vitally important. I won't waste time with\npreliminaries. The notebook I showed you--it's in my jacket. You must\nread the English portion of it. Afterwards, what I'm about to say may\nmake more sense.\"\n\n\"I hope you don't feel your last will and testament coming on, Mr.\nFoster,\" I said. \"Not before you tell me what that was we were both so\neager to get away from.\"\n\n\"I'll be frank with you,\" Foster said flatly. \"I don't know.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFoster wheeled into the dark drive of a silent service station, eased\nto a stop, set the brake and slumped back in the seat.\n\n\"Do you mind driving for a while, Legion?\" he said. \"I'm not feeling\nvery well.\"\n\n\"Sure I'll drive,\" I said. I opened the door and got out and went\naround to his side. Foster sat limply, eyes closed, his face drawn and\nstrained. He looked older than he had last night--years older. The\nnight's experiences hadn't taken anything off my age, either.\n\nFoster opened his eyes, looked at me blankly. He seemed to gather\nhimself with an effort. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I'm not myself.\"\n\nHe moved over and I got in the driver's seat. \"If you're sick,\" I said,\n\"we'd better find a doctor.\"\n\n\"No, it's all right,\" he said blurrily. \"Just keep going....\"\n\n\"We're a hundred and fifty miles from Mayport now,\" I said.\n\nFoster turned to me, started to say something--and slumped in a dead\nfaint. I grabbed for his pulse; it was strong and steady. I rolled up\nan eyelid and a dilated pupil stared sightlessly. He was all right--I\nhoped. But the thing to do was get him in bed and call a doctor. We\nwere at the edge of a small town. I let the brake off and drove slowly\ninto town, swung around a corner and pulled up in front of the sagging\nmarquee of a run-down hotel. Foster stirred as I cut the engine.\n\n\"Foster,\" I said. \"I'm going to get you into a bed. Can you walk?\" He\ngroaned softly and opened his eyes. They were glassy. I got out and got\nhim to the sidewalk. He was still half out. I walked him into the dingy\nlobby and over to a reception counter where a dim bulb burned. I dinged\nthe bell. It was a minute before an old man shuffled out from where\nhe'd been sleeping. He yawned, eyed me suspiciously, looked at Foster.\n\n\"We don't want no drunks here,\" he said. \"Respectable house.\"\n\n\"My friend is sick,\" I said. \"Give me a double with bath. And call a\ndoctor.\"\n\n\"What's he got?\" the old man said. \"Ain't contagious, is it?\"\n\n\"That's what I want a doctor to tell me.\"\n\n\"I can't get the doc 'fore in the morning. And we got no private\nbathrooms.\"\n\nI signed the register. We rode the open-cage elevator to the fourth\nfloor, went along a gloomy hall to a door painted a peeling brown. It\ndidn't look inviting; the room inside wasn't much better. There was\na lot of flowered wallpaper and an old-fashioned wash-stand and two\nwide beds. I stretched Foster out on one. He lay relaxed, a serene\nexpression on his face--the kind undertakers try for but never quite\nseem to manage. I sat down on the other bed and pulled off my shoes. It\nwas my turn to have a tired mind. I lay on the bed and let it sink down\nlike a grey stone into still water.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI awoke from a dream in which I had just discovered the answer to the\nriddle of life. I tried to hold onto it, but it slipped away; it always\ndoes.\n\nGrey daylight was filtering through the dusty windows. Foster lay\nslackly on the broad sagging bed, a ceiling lamp with a faded fringed\nshade casting a sickly yellow light over him. It didn't make things any\ncheerier; I flipped it off.\n\nFoster was lying on his back, arms spread wide, breathing heavily.\nMaybe it was only exhaustion, and he didn't need a doctor after all.\nHe'd probably wake up in a little while, raring to go.\n\nAs for me, I was feeling hungry again. I'd have to have a buck or so\nfor sandwiches. I went over to the bed and called Foster's name. He\ndidn't move. If he was sleeping that soundly, maybe I wouldn't bother\nhim....\n\nI eased his wallet out of his coat pocket, took it to the window and\nchecked it. It was fat. I took a ten, put the wallet on the table. I\nremembered Foster had said something about money in the car. I had the\nkeys in my pocket. I got my shoes on and let myself out quietly. Foster\nhadn't moved.\n\nDown on the street I waited for a couple of yokels who were looking\nover Foster's car to move on, then slid into the seat, leaned over, and\ngot the floor boards up. The strong-box was set into the channel of\nthe frame. I scraped the road dirt off the lock and opened it with a\nkey from Foster's key ring, took out the contents. There was a bundle\nof stiffish papers, a passport, some maps--marked up--and a wad of\ncurrency that made my mouth go dry. I riffled through it: fifty grand\nif it was a buck.\n\nI stuffed the papers, money, and passport back in the box and locked\nit, and climbed out onto the sidewalk. A few doors down the street\nthere was a dirty window lettered MAE'S EAT. I went in, ordered\nhamburgers and coffee to go, and sat at the counter with Foster's\nkeys in front of me, thinking about the car that went with them. The\npassport only needed a little work on the picture to get me wherever I\nwanted to go, and the money would buy me my choice of islands. Foster\nwould have a nice long nap, and then take a train home. With his dough,\nhe'd hardly miss what I took.\n\nThe counterman put a paper bag in front of me and I paid him and went\nout. I stood by the car, jingling the keys on my palm and thinking. I\ncould be in Miami in an hour, and I knew where to go for the passport\njob. Foster was a nice guy and I liked him--but I'd never have a break\nlike this again. I reached for the car door and a voice said, \"Paper,\nmister?\"\n\nI jumped and looked around. A dirty-faced kid was looking at me.\n\"Sure,\" I said. I gave him a single and took the paper, flipped it\nopen. A Mayport dateline caught my eye:\n\n                          POLICE RAID HIDEOUT\n\n    A surprise raid by local police led to the discovery here today of\n    a secret gangland fortress. Chief Chesters of the Mayport Police\n    stated that the raid came as an aftermath of the arrival in the\n    city yesterday of a notorious northern gang member. A number of\n    firearms, including army-type machine guns, were seized in the raid\n    on a house 9 miles from Mayport on the Fernandina road. The raid\n    was said by Chief Chesters to be the culmination of a lengthy\n    investigation.\n\n    C.R. Foster, 50, owner of the property, is missing and feared dead.\n    Police are seeking the ex-convict who visited the house last night.\n    It is feared that Foster may have been the victim of a gangland\n    murder.\n\nI banged through the door to the darkened room and stopped short. In\nthe gloom I could see Foster sitting on the edge of the bed, looking my\nway.\n\n\"Look at this,\" I yelped, flapping the paper in his face. \"Now the\ncops are dragging the state for me--and on a murder rap at that! Get\non the phone and get this thing straightened out--if you can. You and\nyour little green men! The cops think they've stumbled on Al Capone's\narsenal. You'll have fun explaining that one....\"\n\nFoster looked at me interestedly. He smiled.\n\n\"What's funny about it, Foster?\" I yelled. \"Your dough may buy you out,\nbut what about me?\"\n\n\"Forgive me for asking,\" Foster said pleasantly, \"But--who are you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere are times when I'm slow on the uptake, but this wasn't one of\nthem. The implications of what Foster had said hit me hard enough to\nmake my knees go weak.\n\n\"Oh, no, Mr. Foster,\" I said. \"You can't lose your memory again--not\nright now, not with the police looking for me. You're my alibi; you're\nthe one that has to explain all the business about the guns and the ad\nin the paper. I just came to see about a job, remember?\"\n\nMy voice was getting a little shrill. Foster sat looking at me, wearing\nan expression between a frown and a smile, like a credit manager\nturning down an application.\n\nHe shook his head slightly. \"My name is not Foster.\"\n\n\"Look,\" I said. \"Your name was Foster yesterday--that's all I care\nabout. You're the one that owns the house the cops are all upset about.\nAnd you're the corpse I'm supposed to have knocked off. You've got to\ngo to the cops with me--right now--and tell them I'm just an innocent\nbystander.\"\n\nI went to the window and raised the shades to let some light into the\nroom, turned back to Foster.\n\n\"I'll explain to the cops about you thinking the little men were after\nyou--\" I stopped talking and stared at Foster. For a wild moment I\nthought I'd made a mistake--that I'd wandered into the wrong room. I\nknew Foster's face, all right; the light was bright enough now to see\nclearly; but the man I was talking to couldn't have been a day over\ntwenty years old.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI went close to him, staring hard. There were the same cool blue eyes,\nbut the lines around them were gone. The black hair grew lower and\nthicker than I remembered it, and the skin was clear.\n\nI sat down hard on my bed. \"_Mama mia_,\" I said.\n\n\"_\u00bfQue es la dificultad?_\" Foster said.\n\n\"Shut up,\" I moaned. \"I'm confused enough in one language.\" I was\ntrying hard to think but I couldn't seem to get started. A few minutes\nearlier I'd had the world by the tail--just before it turned around and\nbit me. Cold sweat popped out on my forehead when I thought about how\nclose I had come to driving off in Foster's car; every cop in the state\nwould be looking for it by now--and if they found me in it, the jury\nwouldn't be out ten minutes reaching a verdict of guilty.\n\nThen another thought hit me--the kind that brings you bolt upright\nwith your teeth clenched and your heart hammering. It wouldn't be long\nbefore the local hick cops would notice the car out front. They'd come\nin after me, and I'd tell them it belonged to Foster. They'd take a\nlook at him and say, \"nuts, the bird we want is fifty years old, and\nwhere did you hide the body?\"\n\nI got up and started pacing. Foster had already told me there was\nnothing to connect him with his house in Mayport; the locals there had\nseen enough of him to know he was pushing middle age, at least. I could\nkick and scream and tell them this twenty-year-old kid was Foster, but\nI'd never make it stick. There was no way to prove my story; they'd\nfigure Foster was dead and that I'd killed him--and anybody who thinks\nyou need a _corpus_ to prove murder better read his Perry Mason again.\n\nI glanced out of the window and did a double take. Two cops were\nstanding by Foster's car. One of them went around to the back and got\nout a pad and took down the license number, then said something over\nhis shoulder and started across the street. The second cop planted\nhimself by the car, his eye on the front of the hotel.\n\nI whirled on Foster. \"Get your shoes on,\" I croked. \"Let's get the hell\nout of here.\"\n\nWe went down the stairs quietly and found a back door opening on an\nalley. Nobody saw us go.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour later, I sagged in a grimy coach seat and studied Foster,\nsitting across from me--a middle-aged nut with the face of a young kid\nand a mind like a blank slate. I had no choice but to drag him with me;\nmy only chance was to stick close and hope he got back enough of his\nmemory to get me off the hook.\n\nIt was time for me to be figuring my next move. I thought about the\nfifty thousand dollars I had left behind in the car, and groaned.\nFoster looked concerned.\n\n\"Are you in pain?\" he said.\n\n\"And how I'm in pain,\" I said. \"Before I met you I was a homeless bum,\nbroke and hungry. Now I can add a couple more items: the cops are after\nme, and I've got a mental case to nursemaid.\"\n\n\"What law have you broken?\" Foster said.\n\n\"None,\" I barked. \"As a crook, I'm a washout. I've planned three\nlarcenies in the last twelve hours, and flunked out on all of them. And\nnow I'm wanted for murder.\"\n\n\"Whom did you kill?\" Foster inquired courteously.\n\nI leaned across so I could snarl in his face: \"You!\" Then, \"Get this\nthrough your head, Foster. The only crime I'm guilty of is stupidity. I\nlistened to your crazy story; because of you I'm in a mess I'll never\nget straightened out.\" I leaned back. \"And then there's the question of\nold men that take a nap and wake up in their late teens; we'll go into\nthat later, after I've had my nervous breakdown.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry if I've been the cause of difficulty,\" Foster said. \"I wish\nthat I could recall the things you've spoken of. Is there anything I\ncan do to assist you now?\"\n\n\"And you were the one who wanted help,\" I said. \"There is one thing;\nlet me have the money you've got on you; we'll need it.\"\n\nFoster got out his wallet--after I told him where it was--and handed it\nto me. I looked through it; there was nothing in it with a photo or\nfingerprints. When Foster said he had arranged matters so that he could\ndisappear without a trace, he hadn't been kidding.\n\n\"We'll go to Miami,\" I said. \"I know a place in the Cuban section\nwhere we can lie low, cheap. Maybe if we wait a while, you'll start\nremembering things.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Foster said. \"That would be pleasant.\"\n\n\"You haven't forgotten how to talk, at least,\" I said. \"I wonder what\nelse you can do. Do you remember how you made all that money?\"\n\n\"I can remember nothing of your economic system,\" Foster said. He\nlooked around. \"This is a very primitive world, in many respects,\" he\nsaid. \"It should not be difficult to amass wealth here.\"\n\n\"I never had much luck at it,\" I said. \"I haven't even been able to\namass the price of a meal.\"\n\n\"Food is exchanged for money?\" Foster asked.\n\n\"Everything is exchanged for money,\" I said. \"Including most of the\nhuman virtues.\"\n\n\"This is a strange world,\" Foster said. \"It will take me a long while\nto become accustomed to it.\"\n\n\"Yeah, me, too,\" I said. \"Maybe things would be better on Mars.\"\n\nFoster nodded. \"Perhaps,\" he said. \"Perhaps we should go there.\"\n\nI groaned, then caught myself. \"No, I'm not in pain,\" I said. \"But\ndon't take me so literally, Foster.\"\n\nWe rode along in silence for a while.\n\n\"Say, Foster,\" I said. \"Have you still got that notebook of yours?\"\n\nFoster tried several pockets, came up with the book. He looked at it,\nturned it over, frowning.\n\n\"You remember it?\" I said, watching him.\n\nHe shook his head slowly, then ran his finger around the circles\nembossed on the cover.\n\n\"This pattern,\" he said. \"It signifies....\"\n\n\"Go on, Foster,\" I said. \"Signifies what?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I don't remember.\"\n\nI took the book and sat looking at it. I didn't really see it, though.\nI was seeing my future. When Foster didn't turn up, they'd naturally\nassume he was dead. I'd been with him just before his disappearance.\nIt wasn't hard to see why they'd want to talk to me--and my having\nvanished too wouldn't help any. My picture would blossom out in post\noffices all over the country; and even if they didn't catch me right\naway, the murder charge would always be there, hanging over me.\n\nIt wouldn't do any good to turn myself in and tell them the whole\nstory; they wouldn't believe me, and I wouldn't blame them. I didn't\nreally believe it myself, and I'd lived through it. But then, maybe\nI was just imagining that Foster looked younger. After all, a good\nnight's rest----\n\nI looked at Foster, and almost groaned again. Twenty was stretching it;\neighteen was more like it. I was willing to swear he'd never shaved in\nhis life.\n\n\"Foster,\" I said. \"It's got to be in this book; who you are, where you\ncame from----It's the only hope I've got.\"\n\n\"I suggest we read it, then,\" Foster said.\n\n\"A bright idea,\" I said. \"Why didn't I think of that?\" I thumbed\nthrough the book to the section in English and read for an hour.\nStarting with the entry dated January 19, 1710, the writer had\nscribbled a few lines every few months. He seemed to be some kind of\npioneer in the Virginia Colony. He complained about prices, and the\nIndians, and the ignorance of the other settlers and every now and then\nthrew in a remark about the Enemy. He often took long trips, and when\nhe got home, he complained about those, too.\n\n\"It's a funny thing, Foster,\" I said. \"This is supposed to have been\nwritten over a period of a couple of hundred years, but it's all in the\nsame hand. That's kind of odd, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Why should a man's handwriting change?\" Foster said.\n\n\"Well, it might get a little shaky there toward the last, don't you\nagree?\"\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\n\"I'll spell it out, Foster,\" I said. \"Most people don't live that long.\nA hundred years is stretching it, to say nothing of two.\"\n\n\"This must be a very violent world, then,\" Foster said.\n\n\"Skip it,\" I said. \"You talk like you're just visiting. By the way; do\nyou remember how to write?\"\n\nFoster looked thoughtful. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I can write.\"\n\nI handed him the book and the stylus. \"Try it,\" I said. Foster opened\nto a blank page, wrote, and handed the book back to me.\n\n\"Always and always and always,\" I read.\n\nI looked at Foster. \"What does that mean?\" I looked at the words again,\nthen quickly flipped to the pages written in English. I was no expert\non penmanship, but this came up and cracked me right in the eye.\n\nThe book was written in Foster's hand.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It doesn't make sense,\" I was saying for the fortieth time. Foster\nnodded sympathetic agreement.\n\n\"Why would you write out this junk yourself, and then spend all that\ntime and money trying to have it deciphered? You said experts worked\nover it and couldn't break it. But,\" I went on, \"you must have known\nyou wrote it; you knew your own handwriting. But on the other hand,\nyou had amnesia before; you had the idea you might have told something\nabout yourself in the book....\"\n\nI sighed, leaned back and tossed the book over to Foster. \"Here, you\nread a while,\" I said. \"I'm arguing with myself and I can't tell who's\nwinning.\"\n\nFoster looked the book over carefully.\n\n\"This is odd,\" he said.\n\n\"What's odd?\"\n\n\"The book is made of khaff. It is a permanent material--and yet it\nshows damage.\"\n\nI sat perfectly still and waited.\n\n\"Here on the back cover,\" Foster said. \"A scuffed area. Since this is\nkhaff, it cannot be an actual scar. It must have been placed there.\"\n\nI grabbed the book and looked. There was a faint mark across the\nback cover, as though the book had been scraped on something sharp.\nI remembered how much luck I had had with a knife. The mark had been\nput here, disguised as a casual nick in the finish. It had to mean\nsomething.\n\n\"How do you know what the material is?\" I asked.\n\nFoster looked surprised. \"In the same way that I know the window is of\nglass,\" he said. \"I simply know.\"\n\n\"Speaking of glass,\" I said. \"Wait till I get my hands on a microscope.\nThen maybe we'll begin to get some answers.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nThe two-hundred pound se\u00f1orita with the wart on her upper lip put a\npot of black Cuban coffee and a pitcher of salted milk down beside the\ntwo chipped cups, leered at me in a way that might have been appealing\nthirty years before, and waddled back to the kitchen. I poured a cup,\ngulped half of it, and shuddered. In the street outside the cafe a\nguitar cried _Estrellita_.\n\n\"Okay, Foster,\" I said. \"Here's what I've got: The first half of the\nbook is in pot-hooks--I can't read that. But this middle section: the\npart coded in regular letters--it's actually encrypted English. It's\na sort of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of what happened.\" I picked up the sheets of paper\non which I had transcribed my deciphering of the coded section of the\nbook, using the key that had been micro-engraved in the fake scratch on\nthe back cover.\n\nI read:\n\n    _For the first time, I am afraid. My attempt to construct the\n    communicator called down the Hunters upon me. I made such a shield\n    as I could contrive, and sought their nesting place._\n\n    _I came there and it was in that place that I knew of old, and it\n    was no hive, but a pit in the ground, built by men of the Two\n    Worlds. And I would have come into it, but the Hunters swarmed in\n    their multitudes. I fought them and killed many, but at last I fled\n    away. I came to the western shore, and there I hired bold sailors\n    and a poor craft, and set forth._\n\n    _In forty-nine days we came to shore in this wilderness, and there\n    were men as from the dawn of time, and I fought them, and when they\n    had learned fear, I lived among them in peace, and the Hunters have\n    not found this place. Now it may be that my saga ends here, but I\n    will do what I am able._\n\n    _The Change may soon come upon me; I must prepare for the stranger\n    who will come after me. All that he must know is in these pages.\n    And say I to him:_\n\n    _Have patience, for the time of this race draws close. Venture not\n    again on the Eastern continent, but wait, for soon the Northern\n    sailors must come in numbers into this wilderness. Seek out their\n    cleverest metal-workers, and when it may be, devise a shield, and\n    only then return to the pit of the Hunters. It lies in the plain,\n    50/10,000 parts of the girth of this(?) to the west of the Great\n    Chalk Face, and 1470 parts north from the median line, as I reckon.\n    The stones mark it well with the sign of the Two Worlds._\n\nI looked across at Foster. \"It goes on then with a blow-by-blow account\nof dealings with aborigines. He was trying to get them civilized in a\nhurry. They figured he was a god and he set them to work building roads\nand cutting stone and learning mathematics and so on. He was doing all\nhe could to set things up so this stranger who was to follow him would\nknow the score, and carry on the good work.\"\n\nFoster's eyes were on my face. \"What is the nature of the Change he\nspeaks of?\"\n\n\"He never says--but I suppose he's talking about death,\" I said. \"I\ndon't know where the stranger is supposed to come from.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Legion,\" Foster said. There was a hint of the old\nanxious look in his eyes. \"I think I know what the Change was. I think\nhe knew he would forget----\"\n\n\"You've got amnesia on the brain, old buddy,\" I said.\n\n\"----and the stranger is--himself. A man without a memory.\"\n\nI sat frowning at Foster. \"Yeah, maybe,\" I said. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"And he says that all that the stranger needs to know is there--in the\nbook.\"\n\n\"Not in the part I decoded,\" I said. \"He describes how they're coming\nalong with the road-building job, and how the new mine panned out--but\nthere's nothing about what the Hunters are, or what had gone on before\nhe tangled with them the first time.\"\n\n\"It must be there, Legion; but in the first section, the part written\nin alien symbols.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" I said. \"But why the hell didn't he give us a key to that\npart?\"\n\n\"I think he assumed that the stranger--himself--would remember the old\nwriting,\" Foster said. \"How could he know that it would be forgotten\nwith the rest?\"\n\n\"Your guess is as good as any,\" I said. \"Maybe better; you know how it\nfeels to lose your memory.\"\n\n\"But we've learned a few things,\" Foster said. \"The pit of the\nHunters--we have the location.\"\n\n\"If you call this 'ten thousand parts to the west of chalk face' a\nlocation,\" I said.\n\n\"We know more than that,\" Foster said. \"He mentions a plain; and it\nmust lie on a continent to the east----\"\n\n\"If you assume that he sailed from Europe to America, then the\ncontinent to the east would be Europe,\" I said. \"But maybe he went from\nAfrica to South America, or----\"\n\n\"The mention of Northern sailors--that suggests the Vikings----\"\n\n\"You seem to know a little history, Foster,\" I said. \"You've got a lot\nof odd facts tucked away.\"\n\n\"We need maps,\" Foster said. \"We'll look for a plain near the sea----\"\n\n\"Not necessarily.\"\n\n\"----and with a formation called a chalk face to the east.\"\n\n\"What's this 'median line' business?\" I said. \"And the bit about ten\nthousand parts of something?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But we must have maps.\"\n\n\"I bought some this afternoon,\" I said. \"I also got a dime-store globe.\nI figured we might need them. Let's get out of this and back to the\nroom, where we can spread out. I know it's a grim prospect, but....\" I\ngot to my feet, dropped some coins on the oilcloth-covered table, and\nled the way out.\n\nIt was a short half block to the flea trap we called home. We kept out\nof it as much as we could, holding our long daily conferences across\nthe street at the Novedades. The roaches scurried as we passed up the\ndark stairway to our not much brighter room. I crossed to the bureau\nand opened a drawer.\n\n\"The globe,\" Foster said, taking it in his hands. \"I wonder if perhaps\nhe meant a ten-thousandth part of the circumference of the earth?\"\n\n\"What would he know about----\"\n\n\"Disregard the anachronistic aspect of it,\" Foster said. \"The man\nwho wrote the book knew many things. We'll have to start with some\nassumptions. Let's make the obvious ones: that we're looking for a\nplain on the west coast of Europe, lying----\" He pulled a chair up to\nthe scabrous table and riffled through to one of my scribbled sheets:\n\"50/10,000s of the circumference of the earth--that would be about 125\nmiles--west of a chalk formation, and 3675 miles north of a median\nline....\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" I said, \"he means the Equator.\"\n\n\"Certainly. Why not? That would mean our plain lies on a line\nthrough----\" he studied the small globe \"----Warsaw, and south of\nAmsterdam.\"\n\n\"But this part about a rock outcropping,\" I said. \"How do we find out\nif there's any conspicuous chalk formation around there?\"\n\n\"We can consult a geology text. There may be a library in this\nneighborhood.\"\n\n\"The only chalk deposits I ever heard about,\" I said, \"are the White\ncliffs of Dover.\"\n\n\"White cliffs....\"\n\nWe both reached for the globe at once.\n\n\"One hundred twenty-five miles west of the chalk cliffs,\" said Foster.\nHe ran a finger over the globe. \"North of London, but south of\nBirmingham. That puts us reasonably near the sea----\"\n\n\"Where's the atlas?\" I said. I rummaged, came up with a cheap tourists'\nedition, flipped the pages.\n\n\"Here's England,\" I said. \"Now we look for a plain.\"\n\nFoster put a finger on the map. \"Here,\" he said. \"A large plain--called\nSalisbury.\"\n\n\"Large is right,\" I said. \"It would take years to find a stone cairn\non that. We're getting excited about nothing. We're looking for a hole\nin the ground, hundreds of years old--if this lousy notebook means\nanything--maybe marked with a few stones--in the middle of miles of\nplain. And it's all guesswork anyway....\" I took the atlas, turned the\npage.\n\n\"I don't know what I expected to get out of decoding those pages,\" I\nsaid. \"But I was hoping for more than this.\"\n\n\"I think we should try, Legion,\" Foster said. \"We can go there, search\nover the ground. It would be costly, but not impossible. We can start\nby gathering capital----\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, Foster,\" I said. I was staring at a larger-scale map\nshowing southern England. Suddenly my heart was thudding. I put a\nfinger on a tiny dot in the center of Salisbury Plain.\n\n\"Six, two and even,\" I said. \"There's your Pit of the Hunters....\"\n\nFoster leaned over, read the fine print.\n\n\"Stonehenge.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI read from the encyclopedia page:\n\n--_this great stone structure, lying on the Plain of Salisbury,\nWiltshire, England, is pre-eminent among megalithic monuments of the\nancient world. Within a circular ditch 300' in diameter, stones up to\n22' in height are arranged in concentric circles. The central altar\nstone, over 16' long, is approached from the northeast by a broad\nroadway called the Avenue_--\n\n\"It is not an altar,\" said Foster.\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Because----\" Foster frowned. \"I know, that's all.\"\n\n\"The journal said the stones were arranged in the sign of the Two\nWorlds,\" I said. \"That means the concentric circles, I suppose; the\nsame thing that's stamped on the cover of the notebook.\"\n\n\"And the ring,\" Foster said.\n\n\"Let me read the rest: _A great sarsen stone stands upright in the\nAvenue; the axis through the two stones, when erected, pointed directly\nto the rising of the sun on Midsummer Day. Calculations based on this\nobservation indicate a date of approximately 1600 B.C._\"\n\nFoster took the book and I sat on the window sill and looked out at\na big Florida moon over the ragged line of roofs with a skinny royal\npalm sticking up in silhouette. It didn't look much like the postcard\nviews of Miami. I lit a cigarette and thought about a man who long ago\nhad crossed the North Atlantic in a dragon boat to be a god among the\nIndians. I wondered where he came from, and what it was he was looking\nfor, and what kept him going in spite of the hell that showed in the\nspare lines of the journal he kept. If, I reminded myself, he had ever\nexisted....\n\nFoster was poring over the book. \"Look,\" I said. \"Let's get back to\nearth. We have things to think about, plans to make. The fairy tales\ncan wait until later.\"\n\n\"What do you suggest?\" Foster said. \"That we forget the things you've\ntold me, and the things we've read here, discard the journal, and\nabandon the attempt to find the answers?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"I'm no sorehead. Sure, there's some things here that\nsomebody ought to look into--some day. But right now what I want is the\ncops off my neck. And I've been thinking. I'll dictate a letter; you\nwrite it--your lawyers know your handwriting. Tell them you were on the\nthin edge of a nervous breakdown--that's why all the artillery around\nyour house--and you made up your mind suddenly to get away from it all.\nTell them you don't want to be bothered, that's why you're travelling\nincognito, and that the northern mobster that came to see you was just\nstupid, not a killer. That ought to at least cool off the cops----\"\n\nFoster looked thoughtful. \"That's an excellent suggestion,\" he said.\n\"Then we need merely to arrange for passage to England, and proceed\nwith the investigation.\"\n\n\"You don't get the idea,\" I said. \"You can arrange things by mail so we\nget our hands on that dough of yours----\"\n\n\"Any such attempt would merely bring the police down on us,\" Foster\nsaid. \"You've already pointed out the unwisdom of attempting to pass\nmyself off as--myself.\"\n\n\"There ought to be a way....\" I said.\n\n\"We have only one avenue of inquiry,\" Foster said. \"We have no choice\nbut to explore it. We'll take passage on a ship to England----\"\n\n\"What'll we use for money--and papers? It would cost hundreds.\nUnless----\" I added, \"----we worked our way. But that's no good. We'd\nstill need passports--plus union cards and seamen's tickets.\"\n\n\"Your friend,\" Foster said. \"The one who prepares passports. Can't he\nproduce the other papers as well?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I said. \"I guess so. But it will cost us.\"\n\n\"I'm sure we can find a way to pay,\" Foster said. \"Will you see\nhim--early in the morning?\"\n\nI looked around the blowsy room. Hot night air stirred a geranium\nwilting in a tin can on the window sill. An odor of bad cooking and\nworse plumbing floated up from the street.\n\n\"At least,\" I said, \"it would mean getting out of here.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nIt was almost sundown when Foster and I pushed through the door to the\nsaloon bar at the Ancient Sinner and found a corner table. I watched\nFoster spread out his maps and papers. Behind us there was a murmur of\nconversation and the thump of darts against a board.\n\n\"When are you going to give up and admit we're wasting our time?\" I\nsaid. \"Two weeks of tramping over the same ground, and we end up in the\nsame place.\"\n\n\"We've hardly begun our investigation,\" Foster said mildly.\n\n\"You keep saying that,\" I said. \"But if there ever was anything in that\nrock-pile, it's long gone. The archaeologists have been digging over\nthe site for years, and they haven't come up with anything.\"\n\n\"They don't know what to look for,\" Foster said. \"They were searching\nfor indications of religious significance, human sacrifice--that sort\nof thing.\"\n\n\"We don't know what we're looking for either,\" I said. \"Unless you\nthink maybe we'll meet the Hunters hiding under a loose stone.\"\n\n\"You say that sardonically,\" Foster said. \"But I don't consider it\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said. \"You've convinced yourself that the Hunters were\nafter us back at Mayport when we ran off like a pair of idiots.\"\n\n\"From what you've told me of the circumstances--\" Foster began.\n\n\"I know; you don't consider it impossible. That's the trouble with you;\nyou don't consider anything impossible. It would make life a lot easier\nfor me if you'd let me rule out a few items--like leprechauns who hang\nout at Stonehenge.\"\n\nFoster looked at me, half-smiling. It had only been a few weeks since\nhe woke up from a nap looking like a senior class president who hadn't\nmade up his mind whether to be a preacher or a movie star, but he had\nalready lost that mild, innocent air. He learned fast, and day by day I\nhad seen his old personality reemerge and--in spite of my attempts to\nhold onto the ascendency--dominate our partnership.\n\n\"It's a failing of your culture,\" Foster said, \"that hypothesis becomes\ndogma almost overnight. You're too close to your Neolithic, when the\nblind acceptance of tribal lore had survival value. Having learned\nto evoke the fire god from sticks, by rote, you tend to extend the\nprinciple to all 'established facts.'\"\n\n\"Here's an established fact for you,\" I said. \"We've got fifteen pounds\nleft--that's about forty dollars. It's time we figure out where to go\nfrom here, before somebody starts checking up on those phoney papers of\nours.\"\n\nFoster shook his head. \"I'm not satisfied that we've exhausted the\npossibilities here. I've been studying the geometric relationships\nbetween the various structures; I have some ideas I want to check. I\nthink it might be a good idea to go out at night, when we can work\nwithout the usual crowd of tourists observing every move.\"\n\nI groaned. \"My dogs are killing me,\" I said. \"Let's hope you'll come up\nwith something better--or at least different.\"\n\n\"We'll have a bite to eat here, and wait until dark to start out,\"\nFoster said.\n\nThe publican brought us plates of cold meat and potato salad. I worked\non a thin but durable slice of ham and thought about all the people,\nsomewhere, who were sitting down now to gracious meals in the glitter\nof crystal and silver. I'd had too many greasy French fries in too many\ncheap dives the last few years. I could feel them all now, burning in\nmy stomach. I was getting farther from my island all the time--And it\nwas nobody's fault but mine.\n\n\"The Ancient Sinner,\" I said. \"That's me.\"\n\nFoster looked up. \"Curious names these old pubs have,\" he said. \"I\nsuppose in some cases the origins are lost in antiquity.\"\n\n\"Why don't they think up something cheery,\" I said. \"Like 'The Paradise\nBar and Grill' or 'The Happy Hour Cafe'. Did you notice the sign\nhanging outside?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A picture of a skeleton. He's holding one hand up like a Yankee\nevangelist prophesying doom. You can see it through the window there.\"\n\nFoster turned and looked out at the weathered sign creaking in the\nevening wind. He looked at it for a long time. When he turned back,\nthere was a strange look around his eyes.\n\n\"What's the matter--?\" I started.\n\nFoster ignored me, waved to the proprietor, a short fat country man. He\ncame over to the table, wiping his hands on his apron.\n\n\"A very interesting old building,\" Foster said. \"We've been admiring\nit. When was it built?\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" the publican said, \"This here house is a many a hundred\nyear old. It were built by the monks, they say, from the monastery what\nused to stand nearby here. It were tore down by the King's men, Henry,\nthat was, what time he drove the papists out.\"\n\n\"That would be Henry the Eighth, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Aye, it would that. And this house is all that were spared, it being\nthe brewing-house, as the king said were a worthwhile institution, and\nhe laid on a tithe, that two kegs of stout was to be laid by for the\nking's use each brewing time.\"\n\n\"Very interesting,\" Foster said. \"Is the custom still continued?\"\n\nThe publican shook his head. \"It were ended in my granfer's time, it\nbeing that the Queen were a teetotaller.\"\n\n\"How did it acquire the curious name--'The Ancient Sinner?'\"\n\n\"The tale is,\" the publican said, \"that one day a lay brother of the\norder were digging about yonder on the plain by the great stones, in\nsearch of the Druid's treasure, albeit the Abbot had forbid him to go\nnigh the heathen ground, and he come on the bones of a man, and being\nof a kindly turn, he had the thought to give them Christian burial.\nNow, knowing the Abbott would nae permit it, he set to work to dig a\ngrave by moonlight in holy ground, under the monastery walls. But the\nAbbott, being wakeful, were abroad and come on the brother a-digging,\nand when he asked the why of it, the lay brother having visions of\npenances to burden him for many a day, he ups and tells the Abbott it\nwere a ale cellar he were about digging, and the Abbott, not being\nwithout wisdom, clapped him on the back, and went on his way. And so it\nwas the ale-house got built, and blessed by the Abbott, and with it the\nbones that was laid away under the floor beneath the ale-casks.\"\n\n\"So the ancient sinner is buried under the floor?\"\n\n\"Aye, so the tale goes, though I've not dug for him meself. But the\nhouse has been knowed by the name these four hundred years.\"\n\n\"Where was it you said the lay brother was digging?\"\n\n\"On the plain, yonder, by the Druid's stones, what they call\nStonehenge,\" the publican said. He picked up the empty glasses. \"What\nabout another, gentlemen?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Foster said. He sat quietly across from me, his features\ncomposed--but I could see there was tension under the surface calm.\n\n\"What's this all about?\" I asked softly. \"When did you get so\ninterested in local history?\"\n\n\"Later,\" Foster murmured. \"Keep looking bored.\"\n\n\"That'll be easy,\" I said. The publican came back and placed heavy\nglass mugs before us.\n\n\"You were telling us about the lay brother's finding the bones,\" Foster\nsaid. \"You say they were buried in Stonehenge?\"\n\nThe publican cleared his throat, glanced sideways at Foster.\n\n\"The gentlemen wouldna be from the University now, I suppose?\" he said.\n\n\"Let's just say,\" Foster said easily, smiling, \"that we have a great\ninterest in these bits of lore--an interest supported by modest funds,\nof course.\"\n\nThe publican made a show of wiping at the rings on the table top.\n\n\"A costly business, I wager,\" he said. \"Digging about in odd places and\nall. Now, knowing where to dig; that's important, I'll be bound.\"\n\n\"Very important,\" Foster said. \"Worth five pounds, easily.\"\n\n\"'Twere my granfer told me of the spot; took me out by moonlight, he\ndid, and showed me where his granfer had showed him. Told me it were\na fine great secret, the likes of which a simple man could well take\npride in.\"\n\n\"And an additional five pounds as a token of my personal esteem,\"\nFoster said.\n\nThe publican eyed me. \"Well, a secret as was handed down father to\nson....\"\n\n\"And, of course, my associate wishes to express his esteem, too,\"\nFoster said. \"Another five pounds worth.\"\n\n\"That's all the esteem the budget will bear, Mr. Foster,\" I said. I got\nout the fifteen pounds and passed the money across to him. \"I hope you\nhaven't forgotten those people back home who wanted to talk to us,\" I\nsaid. \"They'll be getting in touch with us any time now, I'll bet.\"\n\nFoster rolled up the bills and held them in his hand. \"That's true,\nMr. Legion,\" he said. \"Perhaps we shouldn't take the time....\"\n\n\"But being it's for the advancement of science,\" the publican said,\n\"I'm willing to make the sacrifice.\"\n\n\"We'll want to go out tonight,\" Foster said. \"We have a very tight\nschedule.\"\n\nThe landlord dickered with Foster for another five minutes before he\nagreed to guide us to the spot where the skeleton had been found.\n\nWhen he left, I began. \"Now tell me.\"\n\n\"Look at the signboard again,\" Foster said. I looked. The skull smiled,\nholding up a hand.\n\n\"I see it,\" I said. \"But it doesn't explain why you handed over our\nlast buck----\"\n\n\"Look at the hand. Look at the ring on the finger.\"\n\nI looked again. A heavy ring was painted on the bony index finger, with\na pattern of concentric circles.\n\nIt was a duplicate of the one on Foster's finger.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe publican pulled the battered Morris Minor to the side of the\nhighway and set the brake.\n\n\"This is as close as we best take the machine,\" he said. We got out,\nlooked across the rolling plain where the megaliths of Stonehenge\nloomed against the last glow of sunset.\n\nThe publican rummaged in the boot, produced a ragged blanket and two\nlong four-cell flashlights, gave one to Foster and the other to me. \"Do\nnae use the electric torches until I tell ye,\" he said, \"lest the whole\ncounty see there's folks abroad here.\" We watched as he draped the\nblanket over a barbed wire fence, clambered over, and started across\nthe barren field. Foster and I followed, not talking.\n\nThe plain was deserted. A few lonely lights showed on a distant slope.\nIt was a dark night with no moon. I could hardly see the ground ahead.\nA car moved along a distant road, its headlights bobbing.\n\nWe moved past the outer ring of stones, skirting fallen slabs twenty\nfeet long.\n\n\"We'll break our necks,\" I said. \"Let's have one of the flashlights.\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" Foster whispered.\n\nOur guide paused; we came up to him.\n\n\"It were a mortal long time since I were last hereabouts,\" he said. \"I\nbest take me bearings off the Friar's Heel....\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Yon great stone, standing alone in the Avenue.\" We squinted; it was\nbarely visible as a dark shape against the sky.\n\n\"The bones were buried there?\" Foster asked.\n\n\"Nay, all by theirself, they was. Now it were twenty paces, granfer\nsaid, him bein fifteen stone and long in the leg....\" The publican\nmuttered to himself, pacing off distances.\n\n\"What's to keep him from just pointing to a spot after a while,\" I said\nto Foster, \"and saying 'This is it'?\"\n\n\"We'll wait and see,\" Foster said.\n\n\"They were a hollow, as it were, in the earth,\" the publican said,\n\"with a bit of stone by it. I reckon it were fifty paces from here--\"\nhe pointed, \"--yonder.\"\n\n\"I don't see anything,\" I said.\n\n\"Let's take a closer look.\" Foster started off and I followed,\nthe publican trailing behind. I made out a dim shape, with a deep\ndepression in the earth before it.\n\n\"This could be the spot,\" Foster said. \"Old graves often sink--\"\nSuddenly he grabbed my arm. \"Look...!\"\n\nThe surface of the ground before us seemed to tremble, then heave.\nFoster snapped on his flashlight. The earth at the bottom of the hollow\nrose, cracked open. A boiling mass of luminescence churned, and a\nglobe of light separated itself, rose, bumbling along the face of the\nweathered stone.\n\n\"Saints preserve us,\" the publican said in a choked voice. Foster and\nI stood, rooted to the spot, watching. The lone globe rose higher--and\nabruptly shot straight toward us. Foster threw up an arm and ducked.\nThe ball of light veered, struck him a glancing blow, darted off a few\nyards, hovered. In an instant, the air was alive with the spheres,\nboiling up from the ground, and hurtling toward us, buzzing like a hive\nof yellow-jackets. Foster's flashlight lanced out toward the swarm.\n\n\"Use your light, Legion!\" he shouted hoarsely. I was still standing,\nfrozen. The globes rushed straight at Foster, ignoring me. Behind me, I\nheard the publican turn and run. I fumbled with the flashlight switch,\nsnapped it on, swung the beam of white light on Foster. The globe at\nhis head vanished as the light touched it. More globes swarmed to\nFoster--and popped like soap bubbles in the flashlight's glare--but\nmore swarmed to take their places. Foster reeled, fighting at them. He\nswung the light--and I heard it smash against the stone behind him. In\nthe instant darkness, the globes clustered thick around his head.\n\n\"Foster,\" I yelled, \"run!\"\n\nHe got no more than five yards before he staggered, went to his\nknees. \"Cover,\" he croaked. He fell on his face. I rushed the mass of\ndarting globes, took up a stance straddling his body. A sulphurous\nreek hung around me. I coughed, concentrated on beaming the lights\naround Foster's head. No more were rising from the crack in the earth\nnow. A suffocating cloud pressed around both of us, but it was Foster\nthey went for. I thought of the slab; if I could get my back to it,\nI might have a chance. I stooped, got a grip on Foster's coat, and\nstarted back, dragging him. The lights boiled around me. I swept the\nbeam of light and kept going until my back slammed against the stone. I\ncrouched against it. Now they could only come from the front.\n\nI glanced at the cleft the lights had come from. It looked big enough\nto get Foster into. That would give him some protection. I tumbled him\nover the edge, then flattened my back against the slab and settled down\nto fight in earnest.\n\nI worked in a pattern, sweeping vertically, then horizontally. The\nglobes ignored me, drove toward the cleft, fighting to get at Foster,\nand I swept them away as they came. The cloud around me was smaller\nnow, the attack less ravenous. I picked out individual globes, snuffed\nthem out. The hum became ragged, faltered. Then there were only a few\nglobes around me, milling wildly, disorganized. The last half dozen\nfled, bumbling away across the plain.\n\nI slumped against the rock, sweat running down into my eyes, my lungs\nburning with the sulphur.\n\n\"Foster,\" I gasped. \"Are you all right?\"\n\nHe didn't answer. I flashed the light onto the cleft. It showed me damp\nclay, a few pebbles.\n\nFoster was gone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nI scrambled to the edge of the pit and played the light around inside.\nIt shelved back at one side, and a dark mouth showed, sloping down into\nthe earth--the hiding place from which the globes had swarmed.\n\nFoster was wedged in the opening. I scrambled down beside him, tugged\nhim back to the level ground. He was still breathing; that was\nsomething.\n\nI wondered if the pub owner would come back, now that the lights were\ngone--or if he'd tell someone what had happened, bring out a search\nparty. Somehow, I doubted it. He didn't seem like the type to ask for\ntrouble with the ghosts of ancient sinners.\n\nFoster groaned and opened his eyes. \"Where are ... they?\" he muttered.\n\n\"Take it easy, Foster,\" I said. \"You're OK now.\"\n\n\"Legion,\" Foster said. He tried to sit up. \"The Hunters....\"\n\n\"OK, call 'em Hunters if you want to. I haven't got a better name for\nthem. I worked them over with the flashlights. They're gone.\"\n\n\"That means....\"\n\n\"Let's not worry about what it means. Let's just get out of here.\"\n\n\"The Hunters--they burst out of the ground--from a cleft in the earth.\"\n\n\"That's right. You were halfway into the hole. I guess that's where\nthey were hiding.\"\n\n\"The Pit of the Hunters,\" Foster said.\n\n\"If you say so,\" I said. \"Lucky you didn't go down it.\"\n\n\"Legion, give me the flashlight.\"\n\n\"I feel something coming on that I'm not going to like,\" I said. I\nhanded him the light and he flashed it into the tunnel mouth. I saw a\npolished roof of black glass arching four feet over the rubble-strewn\nbottom of the shaft. A stone, dislodged by my movement, clattered away\ndown the 30 slope.\n\n\"Hell, that tunnel's man-made,\" I said, peering into it. \"And I don't\nmean neolithic man.\"\n\n\"Legion, we'll have to see what's down there,\" Foster said.\n\n\"We could come back later, with ropes and big insurance policies,\" I\nsaid.\n\n\"But we won't,\" said Foster. \"We've found what we were looking for----\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said, \"and it serves us right. Are you sure you feel good\nenough to make like Alice and the White Rabbit?\"\n\n\"I'm sure. Let's go.\"\n\nFoster thrust his legs into the opening, slid over the edge and\ndisappeared. I followed him. I eased down a few feet, glanced back for\na last look at the night sky, then lost my grip and slid. I hit bottom\nhard enough to knock the wind out of me. I got to my hands and knees on\na level, gravel-strewn floor.\n\n\"What is this place?\" I dug the flashlight out of the rubble, flashed\nit around. We were in a low-ceilinged room ten yards square. I saw\nsmooth walls, the dark bulks of massive shapes that made me think of\nsarcophagi in Egyptian burial vaults--except that these threw back\nhighlights from dials and levers.\n\n\"For a couple of guys who get shy in the company of cops,\" I said,\n\"we've a talent for doing the wrong thing. This is some kind of Top\nSecret military installation.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" Foster replied. \"This couldn't be a modern structure, at\nthe bottom of a rubble-filled shaft----\"\n\n\"Let's get out of here fast,\" I said. \"We've probably set off an alarm\nalready.\"\n\nAs if in answer, a low chime cut across our talk. Pearly light sprang\nup on a square panel. I got to my feet, moved over to stare at it.\nFoster came to my side.\n\n\"What do you make of it?\" he said.\n\n\"I'm no expert on stone-age relics,\" I said. \"But if that's not a radar\nscreen, I'll eat it.\"\n\nI sat down in the single chair before the dusty control console, and\nwatched a red blip creep across the screen. Foster stood behind me.\n\n\"We owe a debt to that ancient sinner,\" he said. \"Who would have\ndreamed he'd lead us here?\"\n\n\"Ancient sinner?\" I said. \"This place is as modern as next year's juke\nbox.\"\n\n\"Look at the symbols on the machines,\" Foster said. \"They're identical\nwith those in the first section of the journal.\"\n\n\"All pot-hooks look alike to me,\" I said. \"It's this screen that's got\nme worried. If I've got it doped out correctly, that blip is either a\nmighty slow airplane--or it's at one hell of an altitude.\"\n\n\"Modern aircraft operate at great heights,\" Foster said.\n\n\"Not at this height,\" I said. \"Give me a few more minutes to study\nthese scales....\"\n\n\"There are a number of controls here,\" Foster said, \"obviously intended\nto activate mechanisms--\"\n\n\"Don't touch 'em,\" I said. \"Unless you want to start World War III.\"\n\n\"I hardly think the results would be so drastic,\" Foster replied.\n\"Surely this installation has a simple purpose--unconnected with modern\nwars--but very possibly connected with the mystery of the journal--and\nof my own past.\"\n\n\"The less we know about this, the better,\" I said. \"At least, if we\ndon't mess with anything, we can always claim we just stepped in here\nto get out of the rain----\"\n\n\"You're forgetting the Hunters,\" said Foster.\n\n\"Some new anti-personnel gimmick.\"\n\n\"They came out of this shaft, Legion. It was opened by the pressure of\nthe Hunters bursting out.\"\n\n\"Why did they pick that precise moment--just as we arrived?\" I asked.\n\n\"I think they were aroused,\" said Foster. \"I think they sensed the\npresence of their ancient foe.\"\n\nI swung around to look at him.\n\n\"I see the way your thoughts are running,\" I said. \"You're their\nAncient Foe, now, huh? Just let me get this straight: that means\nthat umpteen hundred years ago, you personally had a fight with the\nHunters--here at Stonehenge. You killed a batch of them and ran. You\nhired some kind of Viking ship and crossed the Atlantic. Later on, you\nlost your memory, and started being a guy named Foster. A few weeks ago\nyou lost it again. Is that the picture?\"\n\n\"More or less.\"\n\n\"And now we're a couple of hundred feet under Stonehenge--after a brush\nwith a crowd of luminous stinkbombs--and you're telling me you'll be\nnine hundred on your next birthday.\"\n\n\"Remember the entry in the journal, Legion? 'I came to the place of the\nHunters, and it was a place I knew of old, and there was no hive, but a\nPit built by men of the Two Worlds....'\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said. \"So you're pushing a thousand.\"\n\nI glanced at the screen, got out a scrap of paper, and scribbled a\nrapid calculation. \"Here's another big number for you. That object on\nthe screen is at an altitude--give or take a few percent--of thirty\nthousand miles.\"\n\nI tossed the pencil aside, swung around to frown at Foster. \"What are\nwe mixed up in, Foster? Not that I really want to know. I'm ready to go\nto a nice clean jail now, and pay my debt to society--\"\n\n\"Calm down, Legion,\" Foster said. \"You're raving.\"\n\n\"OK,\" I said, turning back to the screen. \"You're the boss. Do what you\nlike. It's just my reflexes wanting to run. I've got no place to run\nto. At least with you I've always got the wild hope that maybe you're\nnot completely nuts, and that somehow----\"\n\nI sat upright, eyes on the screen. \"Look at this, Foster,\" I snapped. A\npattern of dots flashed across the screen, faded, flashed again....\n\n\"Some kind of IFF,\" I said. \"A recognition signal. I wonder what we're\nsupposed to do now.\"\n\nFoster watched the screen, saying nothing.\n\n\"I don't like that thing blinking at us,\" I said. \"It makes me feel\nconspicuous.\" I looked at the big red button beside the screen. \"Maybe\nif I pushed that....\" Without waiting to think it over, I jabbed at it.\n\nA yellow light blinked on the control panel. On the screen, the pattern\nof dots vanished. The red blip separated, a smaller blip moving off at\nright angles to the main mass.\n\n\"I'm not sure you should have done that,\" Foster said.\n\n\"There _is_ room for doubt,\" I said in a strained voice. \"It looks like\nI've launched a bomb from the ship overhead.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe climb back up the tunnel took three hours, and every foot of the\nway I was listening to a refrain in my head: This may be it; this may\nbe it; this may be....\n\nI crawled out of the tunnel mouth and lay on my back, breathing hard.\nFoster groped his way out beside me.\n\n\"We'll have to get to the highway,\" I said, untying the ten-foot rope\nof ripped garments that had linked us during the climb. \"There's a\ntelephone at the pub; we'll notify the authorities....\" I glanced up.\n\n\"Hold it!\" I grabbed Foster's arm and pointed overhead. \"What's that?\"\n\nFoster looked up. A brilliant point of blue light, brighter than a\nstar, grew perceptibly as we watched.\n\n\"Maybe we won't get to notify anybody after all,\" I said. \"I think\nthat's our bomb--coming home to roost.\"\n\n\"That's illogical,\" Foster said. \"The installation would hardly be\narranged merely to destroy itself in so complex a manner.\"\n\n\"Let's get out of here,\" I yelled.\n\n\"It's approaching us very rapidly,\" Foster said. \"The distance we could\nrun in the next few minutes would be trivial by comparison with the\nkilling radius of a modern bomb. We'll be safer sheltered in the cleft\nthan on the open.\"\n\n\"We could slide down the tunnel,\" I said.\n\n\"And be buried?\"\n\n\"You're right; I'd rather fry on the surface.\"\n\nWe crouched, watching the blue glare directly overhead, growing larger,\nbrighter. I could see Foster's face by its light now.\n\n\"That's no bomb,\" Foster said. \"It's not falling; it's coming down\nslowly ... like a----\"\n\n\"Like a slowly falling bomb,\" I said. \"And it's coming right down on\ntop of us. Goodbye, Foster. I can't claim it's been fun knowing you,\nbut it's been different. We'll feel the heat at any second now. I hope\nit's fast.\"\n\nThe glaring disc was the size of the full moon now, unbearably bright.\nIt lit the plain like a pale blue sun. There was no sound. As it\ndropped lower, the disc foreshortened and I could see a dark shape\nabove it, dimly lit by the glare thrown back from the ground.\n\n\"The thing is the size of a ferry boat,\" I said.\n\n\"It's going to miss us,\" Foster said. \"It will come to ground several\nhundred feet to the east of us.\"\n\nWe watched the slender shape float down with dreamlike slowness, now\nfive hundred feet above, now three hundred, then hovering just above\nthe giant stones.\n\n\"It's coming down smack on top of Stonehenge,\" I yelled.\n\nWe watched as the vessel settled into place dead center on the ancient\nring of stones. For a moment they were vividly silhouetted against the\nflood of blue radiance; then abruptly, the glare faded and died.\n\n\"Foster,\" I said. \"Do you think it's barely possible----\"\n\nA slit of yellow light appeared on the side of the hull, then it\nwidened to a square. A ladder extended itself, dropping down to touch\nthe ground.\n\n\"If somebody with tentacles starts down that ladder,\" I said, in an\nunnaturally shrill voice, \"I'm getting out of here.\"\n\n\"No one will emerge,\" Foster said quietly. \"I think we'll find, Legion,\nthat this ship of space is at our disposal.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I'm not going aboard that thing,\" I said for the fifth time. \"I'm not\nsure of much in this world, but I'm sure of that.\"\n\n\"Legion,\" Foster said, \"This is no twentieth century military vessel.\nIt obviously homed on the transmitter in the underground station,\nwhich appears to be directly under the old monument--which is several\nthousand years old----\"\n\n\"And I'm supposed to believe the ship has been orbiting the earth\nfor the last few thousand years, waiting for someone to push the red\nbutton? You call that logical?\"\n\n\"Given permanent materials, such as those the notebook is made of,\nit's not impossible--or even difficult.\"\n\n\"We got out of the tunnel alive. Let's settle for that.\"\n\n\"We're on the verge of solving a mystery that goes back through the\ncenturies,\" said Foster, \"a mystery that I've pursued, if I understand\nthe journal, through many lifetimes----\"\n\n\"One thing about losing your memory: you don't have any fixed ideas to\nget in the way of your theories.\"\n\nFoster smiled grimly. \"The trail has brought us here. We must follow\nit--wherever it leads.\"\n\nI lay on the ground, staring up at the unbelievable shape across the\nfield, the beckoning square of light. \"This ship--or whatever it is,\" I\nsaid; \"it drops down out of nowhere and opens its doors. And you want\nto walk right into the cosy interior.\"\n\n\"Listen!\" Foster cut in.\n\nI heard a low rumbling then, a sound that rolled ominously, like\ndistant guns.\n\n\"More ships--\" I started.\n\n\"Jet aircraft,\" Foster said. \"From the bases in East Anglia probably.\nOf course, they'll have tracked our ship in--\"\n\n\"That's all for me,\" I yelled, getting to my feet. \"The secret's out--\"\n\n\"Get down, Legion,\" Foster shouted. The engines were a blanketing roar\nnow.\n\n\"What for? They--\"\n\nTwo long lines of fire traced themselves across the sky, curving down--\n\nI hit the dirt behind the stone in the same instant the rockets struck.\nThe shock wave slammed at the earth like a monster thunderclap, and I\nsaw the tunnel mouth collapse. I twisted, saw the red interior of the\njet tailpipe as the fighter hurtled past, rolling into a climbing turn.\n\n\"They're crazy,\" I yelled. \"Firing on----\"\n\nA second barrage blasted across my indignation. I hugged the muck\nand waited while nine salvoes shook the earth. Then the rumble died,\nreluctantly. The air reeked of high explosives.\n\n\"We'd have been dead now if we'd tried the tunnel,\" I gasped spitting\ndirt. \"It caved at the first rocket. And if the ship was what you\nthought, Foster, they've destroyed something----\"\n\nThe sentence died unnoticed. The dust was settling and through it the\nshape of the ship reared up, unchanged except that the square of light\nwas gone. As I watched, the door opened again and the ladder ran out\nonce more, invitingly.\n\n\"They'll try next time with nukes,\" I said. \"That may be too much for\nthe ship's defenses--and it will sure be too much for us--\"\n\n\"Listen,\" Foster cut in. A deeper rumble was building in the distance.\n\n\"To the ship!\" Foster called. He was up and running, and I hesitated\njust long enough to think about trying for the highway and being caught\nin the open--and then I was running, too. Ahead, Foster stumbled\ncrossing the ground that had been ripped up by the rocket bursts, made\nit to the ladder, and went up it fast. The growl of the approaching\nbombers grew, a snarl of deadly hatred. I leaped a still-smoking stone\nfragment, took the ladder in two jumps, plunged into the yellow-lit\ninterior. Behind me, the door smacked shut.\n\nI was standing in a luxuriously fitted circular room. There was a\npedestal in the center of the floor, from which a polished bar\nprojected. The bones of a man lay beside it. While I stared, Foster\nsprang forward, seized the bar, and pulled. It slid back easily. The\nlights flickered and I had a moment of vertigo. Nothing else happened.\n\n\"Try it the other way,\" I yelled. \"The bombs will fall any second--\" I\nwent for it, hand outstretched. Foster thrust in front of me. \"Look!\"\n\nI stared at the glowing panel he was pointing to--a duplicate of the\none in the underground chamber. It showed a curved white line, with a\nred point ascending from it.\n\n\"We're clear,\" Foster said. \"We've made a successful take-off.\"\n\n\"But we can't be moving--there's no acceleration. There must be\nsoundproofing--that's why we can't hear the bombers--\"\n\n\"No soundproofing would help if we were at ground zero,\" Foster said.\n\"This ship is the product of an advanced science. We've left the\nbombers far behind.\"\n\n\"Where are we going? Who's steering this thing?\"\n\n\"It steers itself, I would judge,\" Foster said. \"I don't know where\nwe're going, but we're well on the way.\"\n\nI looked at him in amazement. \"You like this, don't you, Foster? You're\nhaving the time of your life.\"\n\n\"I can't deny that I'm delighted at this turn of events,\" Foster said.\n\"Don't you see? This vessel is a launch, or lifeboat, under automatic\ncontrol. And it's taking us to the mother ship.\"\n\n\"Okay, Foster,\" I said. I looked at the skeleton on the floor behind\nhim. \"But I hope we have better luck than the last passenger.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nIt was two hours later, and Foster and I stood silent before a ten-foot\nscreen that had glowed into life when I touched a silver button beside\nit. It showed us a vast emptiness of bottomless black, set thick with\ncorruscating points of polychrome brilliance that hurt to look at. And\nagainst that backdrop: a ship, vast beyond imagining, blotting out half\nthe titanic vista with its bulk----\n\nBut dead.\n\nEven from the distance of miles, I could sense it. The great black\ntorpedo shape, dull moonlight glinting along the unbelievable length of\nits sleek flank, drifted: a derelict. I wondered for how many centuries\nit had waited here--and for what?\n\n\"I feel,\" said Foster, \"somehow--I'm coming home.\" I tried to say\nsomething, croaked, cleared my throat.\n\n\"If this is your jitney,\" I said, \"I hope they didn't leave the meter\nticking on you. We're broke.\"\n\n\"We're closing rapidly,\" said Foster. \"Another ten minutes, I'd\nguess....\"\n\n\"How do we go about heaving to, alongside? You didn't come across a\nbook of instructions, did you?\"\n\n\"I think I can predict that the approach will be automatic.\"\n\n\"This is your big moment, isn't it?\" I said. \"I've got to hand it to\nyou, pal; you've won out by pluck, just like the Rover Boys.\"\n\nThe ship appeared to move smoothly closer, looming over us, fine golden\nlines of decorative filigree work visible now against the black. A tiny\nsquare of pale light appeared, grew into a huge bay door that swallowed\nus.\n\nThe screen went dark, there was a gentle jar, then motionlessness. The\nport opened, silently.\n\n\"We've arrived,\" Foster said. \"Shall we step out and have a look?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't think of going back without one,\" I said. I followed him\nout and stopped dead, gaping. I had expected an empty hold, bare metal\nwalls. Instead, I found a vaulted cavern, shadowed, mysterious, rich\nwith a thousand colors. There was a hint of strange perfume in the air,\nand I heard low music that muttered among stalagmite-like buttresses.\nThere were pools, playing fountains, waterfalls, dim vistas stretching\naway, lit by slanting rays of muted sunlight.\n\n\"What kind of place is it?\" I asked. \"It's like a fairyland, or a\ndream.\"\n\n\"It's not an earthly scheme of decoration,\" Foster said, \"but I find it\nstrangely pleasing.\"\n\n\"Hey, look over there,\" I yelped suddenly, pointing. An empty-eyed\nskull stared past me from the shadows at the base of a column.\n\nFoster went over to the skull, stood looking down at it. \"There was a\ndisaster here,\" he said. \"That much is plain.\"\n\n\"It's creepy,\" I said. \"Let's go back; I forgot to get film for my\nBrownie.\"\n\n\"The long-dead pose no threat,\" said Foster. He was kneeling, looking\nat the white bones. He picked up something, stared at it. \"Look,\nLegion.\"\n\nI went over. Foster held up a ring.\n\n\"We're onto something hot, pal,\" I said. \"It's the twin to yours.\"\n\n\"I wonder ... who he was.\"\n\nI shook my head. \"If we knew that--and who killed him--or what--\"\n\n\"Let's go on. The answers must be here somewhere.\" Foster moved off\ntoward a corridor that reminded me of a sunny avenue lined with\nchestnut trees--though there were no trees, and no sun. I followed,\ngaping.\n\nFor hours we wandered, looking, touching, not saying much but saturated\nin wonder, like kids in a toy factory. We came across another skeleton,\nlying among towering engines. Finally we paused in a giant storeroom\nstacked high with supplies.\n\n\"Have you stopped to think, Foster,\" I said, fingering a length\nof rose-violet cloth as thin as woven spider webs. \"This boat's a\ntreasure-house of salable items. Talk about the wealth of the Indies--\"\n\n\"I seek only one thing here, my friend,\" Foster said; \"my past.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"But just in case you don't find it, you might consider\nthe business angle. We can set up a regular shuttle run, hauling stuff\ndown--\"\n\n\"You earthmen,\" sighed Foster. \"For you every new experience is\nimmediately assessed in terms of its merchandising possibilities. Well,\nI leave that to you.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay,\" I said. \"You go on ahead and scout around down that way,\nif you want--where the technical-looking stuff is. I want to browse\naround here for a while.\"\n\n\"As you wish.\"\n\n\"We'll meet at this end of the big hall we passed back there. Okay?\"\n\nFoster nodded and went on. I turned to a bin filled with what looked\nlike unset emeralds the size of walnuts. I picked up a handful, juggled\nthem lovingly.\n\n\"Anyone for marbles?\" I murmured to myself.\n\nHours later, I came along a corridor that was like a path through a\ngarden that was a forest, crossed a ballroom like a meadow floored\nin fine-grained rust-red wood and shaded by giant ferns, and went\nunder an arch into the hall where Foster sat at a long table cut from\nyellow marble. A light the color of sunrise gleamed through tall\npseudo-windows.\n\nI dumped an armfull of books on the table. \"Look at these,\" I said.\n\"All made from the same stuff as the journal. And the pictures....\"\n\nI flipped open one of the books, a heavy folio-sized volume, to a\ndouble-page spread in color showing a group of bearded Arabs in dingy\nwhite djellabas staring toward the camera, a flock of thin goats in the\nbackground. It looked like the kind of picture the National Geographic\nruns, except that the quality of the color and detail was equal to the\nbest color transparencies.\n\n\"I can't read the print,\" I said, \"but I'm a whiz at looking at\npictures. Most of the books showed scenes like I hope I never see in\nthe flesh, but I found a few that were made on earth--God knows how\nlong ago.\"\n\n\"Travel books, perhaps,\" Foster said.\n\n\"Travel books that you could sell to any university on earth for their\nnext year's budget,\" I said, shuffling pages. \"Take a look at this one.\"\n\nFoster looked across at the panoramic shot of a procession of\nshaven-headed men in white sarongs, carrying a miniature golden boat on\ntheir shoulders, descending a long flight of white stone steps leading\nfrom a colonnade of heroic human figures with folded arms and painted\nfaces. In the background, brick-red cliffs loomed up, baked in desert\nheat.\n\n\"That's the temple of Hat-Shepsut in its prime,\" I said. \"Which\nmakes this print close to four thousand years old. Here's another I\nrecognize.\" I turned to a smaller, aerial view, showing a gigantic\npyramid, its polished stone facing chipped in places and with a few\npanels missing from the lower levels, revealing the cruder structure of\nmassive blocks beneath.\n\n\"That's one of the major pyramids, maybe Khufu's,\" I said. \"It was\nalready a couple thousand years old, and falling into disrepair. And\nlook at this----\" I opened another volume, showed Foster a vivid\nphotograph of a great shaggy elephant with a pinkish trunk upraised\nbetween wide-curving yellow tusks.\n\n\"A mastodon,\" I said. \"And there's a woolly rhino, and an ugly-looking\ncritter that must be a sabre-tooth. This book is _old_....\"\n\n\"A lifetime of rummaging wouldn't exhaust the treasures aboard this\nship,\" said Foster.\n\n\"How about bones? Did you find any more?\"\n\nFoster nodded. \"There was a disaster of some sort. Perhaps disease.\nNone of the bones was broken.\"\n\n\"I can't figure the one in the lifeboat,\" I said. \"Why was he wearing\na necklace of bear's teeth?\" I sat down across from Foster. \"We've got\nplenty of mysteries to solve, all right, but there are some other items\nwe'd better talk about. For instance: where's the kitchen? I'm getting\nhungry.\"\n\nFoster handed me a black rod from among several that lay on the table.\n\"I think this may be important,\" he said.\n\n\"What is it, a chop stick?\"\n\n\"Touch it to your head, above the ear.\"\n\n\"What does it do--give you a massage?\"\n\nI pressed it to my temple....\n\n_I was in a grey-walled room, facing a towering surface of ribbed\nmetal. I reached out, placed my hands over the proper perforations.\nThe housings opened. For apparent malfunction in the quaternary field\namplifiers, I knew, auto-inspection circuit override was necessary\nbefore activation_----\n\nI blinked, looked around at the yellow table, and piled books, the rod\nin my hand.\n\n\"I was in some kind of powerhouse,\" I said. \"There was something wrong\nwith--with....\"\n\n\"The quaternary field amplifiers,\" Foster said.\n\n\"I seemed to be right there,\" I said. \"I understood exactly what it was\nall about.\"\n\n\"These are technical manuals,\" Foster said. \"They'll tell us everything\nwe need to know about the ship.\"\n\n\"I was thinking about what I was getting ready to do,\" I said, \"the\nway you do when you're starting into a job; I was trouble-shooting the\nquaternary whatzits--and I knew how...!\"\n\nFoster got to his feet and moved toward the doorway. \"We'll have to\nstart at one end of the library and work our way through,\" he said.\n\"It will take us a while, but we'll get the facts we need. Then we can\nplan.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFoster picked a handful of briefing rods from the racks in the\ncomfortably furnished library and started in. The first thing we needed\nwas a clue as to where to look for food and beds, or for operating\ninstructions for the ship itself. I hoped we might find the equivalent\nof a library card-catalog; then we could put our hands on what we\nwanted in a hurry.\n\nI went to the far end of the first rack and spotted a short row of\nred rods that stood out vividly among the black ones. I took one out,\nthought it over, decided it was unlikely that it was any more dangerous\nthan the others, and put it against my temple....\n\n_As the bells rang, I applied neuro-vascular tension, suppressed\ncortical areas upsilon-zeta and iota, and stood by for_----\n\nI jerked the rod from my head, my ears still ringing with the\nshrill alarm. The effect of the rods was like reality itself, but\nintensified, all attention focused single-mindedly on the experience\nat hand. I thought of the entertainment potentialities of the idea.\nYou could kill a tiger, ride an airplane down in flames, face the\nheavyweight champion----I wondered about the stronger sensations, like\npain and fear. Would they seem as real as the impulse to check the\nwhatchamacallits or tighten up your cortical thingamajigs?\n\nI tried another rod.\n\n_At the sound of the apex-tone, I racked instruments, walked, not ran,\nto the nearest transfer-channel_----\n\nAnother:\n\n_Having assumed duty as Alert Officer, I reported first to coordination\nControl via short-line, and confirmed rapport_--\n\nThese were routine SOP's covering simple situations aboard ship.

DO NOT BE ALARMED.\nSELECT A GENERAL BACKGROUND ORIENTATION ROD FROM THE NEAREST EMERGENCY\nRACK. ITS LOCATION IS....\n\n_I was moving along the stacks, to pause in front of a niche where a\nU-shaped plastic strip was clamped to the wall. I removed it, fitted it\nto my head--(Then:) I was moving along the stacks, to pause in front\nof a niche_--\n\nI was leaning against the wall, my head humming. The red stick lay on\nthe floor at my feet. That last bit had been potent: something about a\ngeneral background briefing--\n\n\"Hey, Foster!\" I called, \"I think I've got something....\" He appeared\nfrom the stacks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"As I see it,\" I said, \"this background briefing should tell us all\nwe need to know about the ship; then we can plan our next move more\nintelligently. We'll know what we're doing.\" I took the thing from the\nwall, just as I had seemed to do in the phantom scene the red rod had\nprojected for me.\n\n\"These things make me dizzy,\" I said, handing it to Foster. \"Anyway\nyou're the logical one to try it.\"\n\nHe took the plastic shape, went to the reclining seat at the near end\nof the library hall, and settled himself. \"I have an idea this one will\nhit harder than the others,\" he said.\n\nHe fitted the clamp to his head and ... instantly his eyes glazed; he\nslumped back, limp.\n\n\"Foster!\" I yelled. I jumped forward, started to pull the plastic piece\nfrom his head, then hesitated. Maybe Foster's abrupt reaction was\nstandard procedure--but I didn't like it much.\n\nI went on reasoning with myself. After all, this was what the red rod\nhad indicated as normal procedure in a given emergency. Foster was\nmerely having his faded personality touched up. And his full-blown,\nthree-dimensional personality was what we needed to give us the answers\nto a lot of the questions we'd been asking. Though the ship and\neverything in it had lain unused and silent for forgotten millenia,\nstill the library should be good. The librarian was gone from his post\nfor forgotten centuries, and Foster was lying unconscious, and I was\nthirty thousand miles from home--but I shouldn't let trifles like that\nworry me....\n\nI got up and prowled the room. There wasn't much to look at except\nstacks and more stacks. The knowledge stored here was fantastic, both\nin magnitude and character. If I ever get home with a load of these\nrods....\n\nI strolled through a door leading to another room. It was small,\nfunctional, dimly lit. The middle of the room was occupied by a large\nand elaborate divan with a cap-shaped fitting at one end. Other curious\naccoutrements were ranked along the walls. There wasn't much in them to\nthrill me. But bone-wise I had hit the jackpot.\n\nTwo skeletons lay near the door, in the final slump of death. Another\nlay beside the fancy couch. There was a long-bladed dagger beside it.\n\nI squatted beside the two near the door and examined them closely. As\nfar as I could tell, they were as human as I was. I wondered what kind\nof men they had been, what kind of world they had come from, that could\nbuild a ship like this and stock it as it was stocked.\n\nThe dagger that lay near the other bones was interesting: it seemed\nto be made of a transparent orange metal, and its hilt was stamped in\na repeated pattern of the Two Worlds motif. It was the first clue as\nto what had taken place among these men when they last lived: not a\ncomplete clue, but a start.\n\nI took a closer look at an apparatus like a dentist's chair parked\nagainst the wall. There were spidery-looking metal arms mounted\nabove it, and a series of colored glass lenses. A row of dull silver\ncylinders was racked against the wall. Another projected from a socket\nat the side of the machine. I took it out and looked at it. It was a\nplain pewter-colored plastic, heavy and smooth. I felt pretty sure it\nwas a close cousin to the chopsticks stored in the library. I wondered\nwhat brand of information was recorded in it as I dropped it in my\npocket.\n\nI lit a cigarette and went out to where Foster lay. He was still in the\nsame position as when I had left him. I sat down on the floor beside\nthe couch to wait.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was an hour before he stirred, heaved a sigh, and opened his eyes.\nHe reached up, pulled off the plastic headpiece, dropped it on the\nfloor.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" I said. \"Brother, I've been sweating....\"\n\nFoster looked at me, his eyes traveling up to my uncombed hair and down\nto my scuffed shoes. His eyes narrowed in a faint frown. Then he said\nsomething--in a language that seemed to be all Z's and Q's.\n\n\"Don't spring any surprises on me, Foster,\" I said hoarsely. \"Talk\nAmerican.\"\n\nA look of surprise crossed his face. He stared into my eyes again, then\nglanced around the room.\n\n\"This is a ship's library,\" he said.\n\nI heaved a sigh of relief. \"You gave me a scare, Foster. I thought for\na second your memory was wandering again.\"\n\nFoster was watching my face as I spoke. \"What was it all about?\" I\nsaid. \"What have you found out?\"\n\n\"I know you,\" said Foster slowly. \"Your name is Legion.\"\n\nI nodded. I could feel myself getting tense again. \"Sure, you know me.\nJust take it easy pal. This is no time to lose your marbles.\" I put a\nhand on his shoulder. \"You remember, we were--\"\n\nHe shook my hand off. \"That is not the custom in Vallon,\" he said\ncoldly.\n\n\"Vallon?\" I echoed. \"What kind of routine is this, Foster? We were\nfriends when we walked into this room an hour ago. We were hot on the\ntrail of something, and I'm human enough to want to know how it turned\nout.\"\n\n\"Where are the others?\"\n\n\"There's a couple of 'others' in the next room,\" I snapped. \"But\nthey've lost a lot of weight. I can find you several more, in the same\ncondition. Outside of them there's only me----\"\n\nFoster looked at me as if I wasn't there. \"I remember Vallon,\" he said.\nHe put a hand to his head. \"But I remember, too, a barbaric world,\nbrutal and primitive. You were there. We traveled in a crude rail-car,\nand then in a barge that wallowed in the sea. There were narrow, ugly\nrooms, evil odors, harsh noises.\"\n\n\"That's not a very flattering portrait of God's country,\" I said, \"but\nI'm afraid I recognize it.\"\n\n\"The people were the worst,\" Foster said. \"Misshapen, diseased, with\nswollen abdomens and wasted skin and withered limbs.\"\n\n\"Some of the boys don't get out enough,\" I said.\n\n\"The Hunters! We fled from them, Legion, you and I. And I remember a\nlanding-ring....\" He paused. \"Strange, it had lost its cap-stones and\nfallen into ruin.\"\n\n\"Us natives call it Stonehenge.\"\n\n\"The Hunters burst out of the earth. We fought them. But why should the\nHunters seek me?\"\n\n\"I was hoping you'd tell me,\" I said. \"Do you know where this ship came\nfrom? And why?\"\n\n\"This is a ship of the Two Worlds,\" he replied. \"But I know nothing of\nhow it came to be here.\"\n\n\"How about all that stuff in the journal? Maybe now you--\"\n\n\"The journal!\" Foster broke in. \"Where is it?\"\n\n\"In your coat pocket, I guess.\"\n\nFoster felt through his jacket awkwardly, brought out the journal. He\nopened it.\n\nI moved around to look over his shoulder. He had the book open to the\nfirst section, the part written in the curious alien characters that\nnobody had been able to decipher.\n\nAnd he was reading it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe sat at the library table of deep green, heavy, polished wood,\nthe journal open at its center. For hours I had waited while Foster\nread. Now at last he leaned back in his chair, ran a hand through the\nyouthful black hair, and sighed.\n\n\"My name,\" he said, \"was Qulqlan. And this,\" he laid his hand upon the\nbook, \"is my story. This is one part of the past I was seeking. And I\nremember none of it....\"\n\n\"Tell me what the journal says,\" I asked. \"Read it to me.\"\n\nFoster picked it up, riffled the pages. \"It seems that I awoke\nonce before, in a small room aboard this vessel. I was lying on a\nmemo-couch, by which circumstance I knew that I had suffered a Change--\"\n\n\"You mean you'd lost your memory?\"\n\n\"And regained it--on the couch. My memory-trace had been re-impressed\non my mind. I awoke knowing my identity, but not how I came to be\naboard this vessel. The journal says that my last memory was of a\nbuilding beside the Shallow Sea.\"\n\n\"Where's that?\"\n\n\"On a far world--called Vallon.\"\n\n\"Yeah? And what next?\"\n\n\"I looked around me and saw four men lying on the floor, slashed and\nbloody. One was alive. I gave him what emergency treatment I could,\nthen searched the ship. I found three more men, dead; none living. Then\nthe Hunters attacked, swarming to me--\"\n\n\"Our friends the fire-balls?\"\n\n\"Yes; they would have sucked the life from me--and I had no shield of\nlight. I fled to the lifeboat, carrying the wounded man. I descended\nto the planet below: your earth. The man died there. He had been my\nfriend, a man named Ammaerln. I buried him in a shallow depression in\nthe earth and marked the place with a stone.\"\n\n\"The ancient sinner,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes ... I suppose it was his bones the lay brother found.\"\n\n\"And we found out last night that the depression was the result of dirt\nsifting into the ventilator shaft. But I guess you didn't know anything\nabout the underground installation, way back then. Doesn't the journal\nsay anything...?\"\n\n\"No there is no mention made of it here.\" Foster shook his head. \"How\ncurious to read of the affairs of this stranger--and know he is myself.\"\n\n\"How about the Hunters? How did they get to earth?\"\n\n\"They are insubstantial creatures,\" said Foster, \"yet they can endure\nthe vacuum of space. I can only surmise that they followed the lifeboat\ndown.\"\n\n\"They were tailing you?\"\n\n\"Yes; but I have no idea why they pursued me. They're harmless\ncreatures in the natural state, used to seek out the rare fugitive\nfrom justice on Vallon. They can be attuned to the individual;\nthereafter, they follow him and mark him out for capture.\"\n\n\"Kind of like bloodhounds,\" I said. \"Say, what were you: a big-time\nracketeer on Vallon?\"\n\n\"The journal is frustratingly silent as to my Vallonian career,\" said\nFoster. \"But this whole matter of the unexplained inter-galactic voyage\nand the evidences of violence aboard the ship make me wonder whether I,\nand perhaps others of my companions, were being exiled for crimes done\nin the Two Worlds.\"\n\n\"Wow! So they sicced the Hunters on you!\" I said. \"But why did they\nhang around at Stonehenge all this time?\"\n\n\"There was a trickle of power feeding the screens,\" said Foster. \"They\nneed a source of electrical energy to live; until a hundred years ago\nit was the only one on the planet.\"\n\n\"How did they get down into the shaft without opening it up?\"\n\n\"Given time, they pass easily through porous substances. But, of\ncourse, last night, when I came on them after their long fast, they\nsimply burst through in their haste.\"\n\n\"Okay. What happened next--after you buried the man?\"\n\n\"The journal tells that I was set upon by natives, men who wore the\nhides of animals. One of their number entered the ship. He must have\nmoved the drive lever. It lifted, leaving me marooned.\"\n\n\"So those were his bones we found in the boat,\" I mused, \"the ones with\nthe bear's-tooth necklace. I wonder why he didn't come into the ship.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly he did. But remember the skeleton we found just inside the\nlanding port? That must have been a fairly fresh and rather gory corpse\nat the time the savage stepped aboard. It probably seemed to him all\ntoo clear an indication of what lay in store for himself if he ventured\nfurther. In his terror he must have retreated to the boat to wait, and\nthere starved to death.\n\n\"He was stranded in your world, and you were stranded in his.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Foster. \"And then, it seems, I lived among the brute-men\nand came to be their king. I waited there by the landing ring through\nmany years in the hope of rescue. Because I did not age as the natives\ndid, I was worshipped as a god. I would have built a signalling device,\nbut there were no pure metals, nothing I could use. I tried to teach\nthem, but it was a work of centuries.\"\n\n\"I should think you could have set up a school, trained the smartest\nones,\" I said.\n\n\"There was no lack of intelligent minds,\" Foster said. \"It is plain\nthat the savages were of the blood of the Two Worlds. This earth must\nhave been seeded long ago by some ancient castaways.\"\n\n\"But how could you go on living--for hundreds of years? Are your people\nsupermen that live forever?\"\n\n\"The natural span of a human life is very great. Among your people,\nthere is a wasting disease from which you all die young.\"\n\n\"That's no disease,\" I said. \"You just naturally get old and die.\"\n\n\"The human mind is a magnificent instrument,\" Foster said, \"not meant\nto wither quickly.\"\n\n\"I'll have to chew that one over,\" I said. \"Why didn't you catch this\ndisease?\"\n\n\"All Vallonians are innoculated against it.\"\n\n\"I'd like a shot of that,\" I said. \"But let's get back to you.\"\n\nFoster turned the pages of the journal. \"I ruled many peoples, under\nmany names,\" he said. \"I traveled in many lands, seeking for skilled\nmetal-workers, glass-blowers, wise men. But always I returned to the\nlanding-ring.\"\n\n\"It must have been tough,\" I said, \"exiled on a strange world, living\nout your life in a wilderness, century after century....\"\n\n\"My life was not without interest,\" Foster said. \"I watched my savage\npeople put aside their animal hides and learn the ways of civilization.\nI taught them how to build, and keep herds, and till the land. I built\na great city, and I tried--foolishly--to teach their noble caste the\ncode of chivalry of the Two Worlds. But although they sat at a round\ntable like the great Ring-board at Okk-Hamiloth, they never really\nunderstood. And then they grew too wise, and wondered at their king,\nwho never aged. I left them, and tried again to build a long-signaller.\nThe Hunters sensed it, and swarmed to me. I drove them off with fires,\nand then I grew curious, and followed them back to their nest----\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said. \"'----and it was a place you knew of old: no hive but\na Pit built by men.'\"\n\n\"They overwhelmed me; I barely escaped with my life. Starvation had\nmade the Hunters vicious. They would have drained my body of its\nlife-energy.\"\n\n\"And if you'd known the transmitter was there--but you didn't. So you\nput an ocean between you and them.\"\n\n\"They found me even there. Each time I destroyed many of them, and\nfled. But always a few lived to breed and seek me out again.\"\n\n\"But your signaller--didn't it work?\"\n\n\"No. It was a hopeless attempt. Only a highly developed technology\ncould supply the raw materials. I could only teach what I knew,\nencourage the development of the sciences, and wait. And then I began\nto forget.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"A mind grows weary,\" Foster said. \"It is the price of longevity. It\nmust renew itself. Shock and privation hasten the Change. I had held it\noff for many centuries. Now I felt it coming on me.\n\n\"At home, on Vallon, a man would record his memory at such a time,\nstore it electronically in a recording device, and, after the Change,\nuse the memory-trace to restore, in his renewed body, his old\nrecollections in toto. But, marooned as I was, my memories, once lost,\nwere gone forever.\n\n\"I did what I could; I prepared a safe place, and wrote messages that I\nwould find when I awoke----\"\n\n\"When you woke up in the hotel, you were young again, overnight. How\ncould it happen?\"\n\n\"When the mind renews itself, erasing the scars of the years, the body,\ntoo, regenerates. The skin forgets its wrinkles, and the muscles their\nfatigue. They become again as they once were.\"\n\n\"When I first met you,\" I said, \"you told me about waking up back in\n1918, with no memory.\"\n\n\"Yours is a harsh world, Legion. I must have forgotten many times.\nSomewhere, some time, I lost the vital link, forgot my quest. When the\nHunters came again, I fled, not understanding.\"\n\n\"You had a machine gun set up in the house at Mayport. What good was\nthat against the Hunters?\"\n\n\"None, I suppose,\" Foster replied. \"But I didn't know. I only knew that\nI was--pursued.\"\n\n\"And by then you could have made a signaller,\" I said. \"But you'd\nforgotten how--or even that you needed one.\"\n\n\"But in the end I found it--with your help, Legion. But still there is\na mystery: What came to pass aboard this ship all those centuries ago?\nWhy was I here? And what killed the others?\"\n\n\"Look,\" I said. \"Here's a theory: there was a mutiny, while you were\nin the machine having your memory fixed. You woke up and it was all\nover--and the crew was dead.\"\n\n\"That hypothesis will serve,\" said Foster. \"But one day I must learn\nthe truth of this matter.\"\n\n\"What I can't figure out is why somebody from Vallon didn't come after\nthis ship. It was right here in orbit.\"\n\n\"Consider the immensity of space, Legion. This is one tiny world, among\nthe stars.\"\n\n\"But there was a station here, fitted out for handling your ships.\nThat sounds like it was a regular port of call. And the books with\nthe pictures: they prove your people have been here off and on for\nthousands of years. Why would they stop coming?\"\n\n\"There are such beacons on a thousand worlds,\" said Foster. \"Think\nof it as a buoy marking a reef, a trailblaze in the wilderness. Ages\ncould pass before a wanderer chanced this way again. The fact that the\nventilator shaft at Stonehenge was choked with the debris of centuries\nwhen I first landed there shows how seldom this world was visited.\"\n\nI thought about it. Bit by bit Foster was putting together the jig-saw\npieces of his past. But he still had a long way to go before he had the\nbig picture, frame and all. I had an idea:\n\n\"Say, you said you were in the memory machine. You woke up there--and\nyou'd just had your memory restored. Why not do the same thing again,\nnow? That is, if your brain can take another pounding this soon.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. He stood up abruptly. \"There's just a chance. Come!\"\n\nI followed him out of the library into the room with the bones. He\nmoved over to look down at them curiously.\n\n\"Quite a fracas,\" I said. \"Three of 'em.\"\n\n\"This would be the room where I awakened,\" said Foster. \"These are the\nmen I saw dead.\"\n\n\"They're still dead,\" I said. \"But what about the machine?\"\n\nFoster walked across to the fancy couch, leaned down beside it, then\nshook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"Of course it wouldn't be here....\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"My memory-trace: the one that was used to restore my memory--that\nother time.\"\n\nSuddenly I recalled the cylinder I had pocketed hours before. With a\nsurprising flutter at my heart I held it up, like a kid in a classroom\nwho knows he's got the right answer. \"This it?\"\n\nFoster glanced at it briefly. \"No, that's an empty--like those you see\nfiled over there.\" He pointed to the rack of pewter-colored cylinders\non the opposite wall. \"They would be used for emergency recordings.\nRegular multi-life memory-traces would be key-coded with a pattern of\ncolored lines.\"\n\n\"It figures,\" I said. \"That would have been too easy. We have to do\neverything the hard way.\" I looked around. \"It's a big bureau to look\nfor a collar button under, but I guess we can try.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter, really. When I return to Vallon, I'll recover my\npast. There are vaults where every citizen's trace is stored.\"\n\n\"But you had yours here with you.\"\n\n\"It could only have been a copy. The master trace is never removed from\nOkk-Hamiloth.\"\n\n\"I guess you'll be eager to get back there,\" I said. \"That'll be quite\na moment for you, getting back home after all these years. Speaking of\nyears: were you able to figure out how long you were marooned down on\nearth?\"\n\n\"I lost all record of dates long ago,\" said Foster. \"I can only\nestimate the time.\"\n\n\"About how long?\" I persisted.\n\n\"Since I descended from this ship, Legion,\" he said, \"three thousand\nyears have passed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I hate to see the team split up,\" I said. \"You know, I was kind of\ngetting used to being an apprentice nut. I'm going to miss you, Foster.\"\n\n\"Come with me to Vallon, Legion,\" he said.\n\nWe were standing in the observation lounge, looking out at the\nbright-lit surface of the earth thirty thousand miles away. Beyond it,\nthe dead-white disk of the moon hung like a cardboard cutout.\n\n\"Thanks anyway, buddy,\" I said. \"I'd like to see those other worlds\nof yours but in the end I might regret it. It's no good giving an\nEskimo a television set. I'd just sit around on Vallon pining for home:\nbeat-up people, stinks, and all.\"\n\n\"You could return here some day.\"\n\n\"From what I understand about traveling in a ship like this,\" I said,\n\"a couple of hundred years would pass before I got back, even if it\nonly seemed like a few weeks en route. I want to live out my life\nhere--with the kind of people I know, in the world I grew up in. It has\nits faults, but it's home.\"\n\n\"Then there is nothing I can do, Legion,\" Foster said, \"to reward your\nloyalty and express my gratitude.\"\n\n\"Well, ah,\" I said. \"There is a little something. Let me take the\nlifeboat, and stock it with a few goodies from the library, and some\nof those marbles from the storeroom, and a couple of the smaller\nmechanical gadgets. I think I know how to merchandise them in a way\nthat'll leave the economy on an even keel--and incidentally set me up\nfor life. As you said, I'm a materialist.\"\n\n\"As you wish,\" Foster said. \"Take whatever you desire.\"\n\n\"One thing I'll have to do when I get back,\" I said, \"is open the\ntunnel at Stonehenge enough to sneak a thermite bomb down it--if they\nhaven't already found the beacon station.\"\n\n\"As I judge the temper of the local people,\" Foster said, \"the secret\nis safe for at least three generations.\"\n\n\"I'll bring the boat down in a blind spot where radar won't pick it\nup,\" I said. \"Our timing was good; in another few years, it wouldn't\nhave been possible.\"\n\n\"And this ship would soon have been discovered,\" Foster said. \"In\nspite of radar-negative screens.\"\n\nI looked at the great smooth sphere hanging, haloed, against utter\nblack. The Pacific Ocean threw back a brilliant image of the sun.\n\n\"I think I see an island down there that will fill the bill perfectly,\"\nI said. \"And if it doesn't, there are a million more to choose from.\"\n\n\"You've changed, Legion,\" Foster said. \"You sound like a man with a\nfair share of _joie de vivre_.\"\n\n\"I used to think I was a guy who never got the breaks,\" I said.\n\"There's something about standing here looking at the world that makes\nthat kind of thinking sound pretty dumb. There's everything down there\na man needs to make his own breaks--even without a stock of trade\ngoods.\"\n\n\"Every world has its rules of life,\" Foster said. \"Some more complex\nthan others. To face your own reality--that's the challenge.\"\n\n\"Me against the universe,\" I said. \"With those odds, even a loser can\nlook good.\" I turned to Foster. \"We're in a ten-hour orbit,\" I said.\n\"We'd better get moving. I want to put the boat down in southern South\nAmerica. I know a place there where I can off-load without answering\ntoo many questions.\"\n\n\"You have several hours before the most favorable launch time,\" Foster\nsaid. \"There's no hurry.\"\n\n\"Maybe not,\" I said. \"But I've got a lot to do--\" I took a last look\ntoward the majestic planet beyond the viewscreen, \"--and I'm eager to\nget started.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nI sat on the terrace watching the sun go down into the sea and thinking\nabout Foster, somewhere out there beyond the purple palaces on the far\nhorizon, in the ship that had waited for him for three thousand years,\nheading home at last. It was strange to reflect that for him, traveling\nnear the speed of light, only a few days had passed, while three years\nwent by for me--three fast years that I had made good use of.\n\nThe toughest part had been the first few months, after I put the\nlifeboat down in a ca\u00f1on in the desert country south of a little town\ncalled Itzenca, in Peru. I waited by the boat for a week, to be sure\nthe vigilantes weren't going to show up, full of helpful suggestions\nand embarassing questions; then I hiked to town, carrying a pack with\na few carefully selected items to start my new career. It took me two\nweeks to work, lie, barter, and plead my way to the seaport town of\nCallao and another week to line up passage home as a deck hand on a\nbanana scow. I disappeared over the side at Tampa, and made it to Miami\nwithout attracting attention. As far as I could tell, the cops had\nalready lost interest in me.\n\nMy old friend, the heavyweight se\u00f1orita, wasn't overjoyed to see me,\nbut she put me up, and I started in on my plan to turn my souvenirs\ninto money.\n\nThe items I had brought with me from the lifeboat were a pocketful\nof little gray dominoes that were actually movie film, and a small\nprojector to go with them. I didn't offer them for sale, direct. I\nmade arrangements with an old acquaintance in the business of making\npictures with low costume budgets for private showings; I set up the\napparatus and projected my films, and he copied them in 35 mm. I told\nhim that I'd smuggled them in from East Germany. He didn't think much\nof the Krauts, but he admitted you had to hand it to them technically;\nthe special effects were absolutely top-notch. His favorite was one I\ncalled the Mammoth Hunt.\n\nI had twelve pictures altogether; with a little judicious cutting and a\ndubbed-in commentary, they made up into fast-moving twenty-minute short\nsubjects. He got in touch with a friend in the distribution end in New\nYork, and after a little cagy fencing over contract terms, we agreed on\na deal that paid a hundred thousand for the twelve, with an option on\nanother dozen at the same price.\n\nWithin a week after the pictures hit the neighborhood theatres around\nBayonne, New Jersey, in a cautious tryout, I had offers up to half a\nmillion for my next consignment, no questions asked. I left my pal\nMickey to handle the details on a percentage basis, and headed back for\nItzenca.\n\nThe lifeboat was just as I'd left it; it would have been all right for\nanother fifty years, as far as the danger of anybody stumbling over it\nwas concerned. I explained to the crew I brought out with me that it\nwas a fake rocket ship, a prop I was using for a film I was making,\nI let them wander all over it and get their curiosity out of their\nsystems. The concensus was that it wouldn't fool anybody; no tail fins,\nno ray guns, and the instrument panel was a joke; but they figured that\nit was my money, so they went to work setting up a system of camouflage\nnets (part of the plot, I told them) and off-loading my cargo.\n\nA year after my homecoming, I had my island--a square mile of perfect\nclimate, fifteen miles off the Peruvian coast--and a house that was\ntailored to my every whim by a mind-reading architect who made a\nfortune on the job--and earned it. The uppermost floor--almost a\ntower--was a strong-room, and it was there that I had stored my stock\nin trade. I had sold off the best of the hundred or so films I had\npicked out before leaving Foster, but there were plenty of other items.\nThe projector itself was the big prize. The self-contained power unit\nconverted nuclear energy to light with 99 percent efficiency. It\nscanned the \"films\", one molecular layer at a time, and projected a\ncontinuous picture--no sixteen-frames-a-second flicker here. The color\nand sound were absolutely life-like--with the result that I'd had a\nfew complaints from my distributor that the Technicolor was kind of\nwashed-out.\n\nThe principles involved in the projector were new, and--in theory, at\nleast--way over the heads of our local physicists. But the practical\napplication was nothing much. I figured that, with the right contacts\nin scientific circles to help me introduce the system, I had a\nbillion-dollar industry up my sleeve. I had already fed a few little\ngimmicks into the market; a tough paper, suitable for shirts and\nunderwear; a chemical that bleached teeth white as the driven snow;\nan all-color pigment for artists. With the knowledge I had absorbed\nfrom all the briefing rods I had studied, I had the techniques of a\nhundred new industries at my fingertips--and I hadn't exhausted the\npossibilities yet.\n\nI spent most of a year roaming the world, discovering all the things\nthat a free hand with a dollar bill could do for a man. The next year I\nput in fixing up the island, buying paintings and rugs and silver for\nthe house, and a concert grand piano. After the first big thrill of\neconomic freedom had worn off, I still enjoyed my music.\n\nFor six months I had a full-time physical instructor giving me a\ntwenty-four-hour-a-day routine of diet, sleep, and all the precision\nbody-building my metabolism could stand. At the end of the course I was\ntwice the man I'd ever been, the instructor was a physical wreck, and I\nwas looking around for a new hobby.\n\nNow, after three years, it was beginning to get me: boredom, the\ndisease of the idle rich, that I had sworn would never touch me. But\nthinking about wealth and having it on your hands are two different\nthings, and I was beginning to remember almost with nostalgia the tough\nold times when every day was an adventure, full of cops and missed\nmeals and a thousand unappeased desires.\n\nNot that I was really suffering. I was relaxed in a comfortable chair,\nafter a day of surf fishing and a modest dinner of Chateaubriand. I\nwas smoking a skinny cigar rolled by an expert from the world's finest\nleaf, and listening to the best music a thousand-dollar hi-fi could\nproduce. And the view, though free, was worth a million dollars a\nminute. After a while I would stroll down to the boathouse, start up\nthe Rolls-powered launch, and tool over to the mainland, transfer to\nmy Caddie convertible, and drive into town where a tall brunette from\nStockholm was waiting for me to take her to the movies. My steady gal\nwas a hard-working secretary for an electronics firm.\n\nI finished up my stogie and leaned forward to drop it in a big silver\nashtray, when something caught my eye out across the red-painted water.\nI sat squinting at it, then went inside and came out with a pair of\n7x50 binoculars. I focused them and studied the dark speck that stood\nout clearly now against the gaudy sky. It was a heavy-looking power\nboat, heading dead toward my island.\n\nI watched it come closer, swing off toward the hundred-foot concrete\njetty I had built below the sea-wall, and ease alongside in a murmur\nof powerful engines. They died, and the boat sat in a sudden silence\ndwarfing the pier. I studied the bluish-grey hull, the inconspicuous\nflag aft. Two heavy deck guns were mounted on the foredeck, and there\nwere four torpedoes slung in launching cradles. The hardware didn't\nmake half as much impression on me as the ranks of helmeted men drawn\nup on deck.\n\nI sat and watched. The men shuffled off onto the pier, formed up into\ntwo squads. I counted; forty-eight men, and a couple of officers. There\nwas the faint sound of orders being barked, and the column stepped\noff, moving along the paved road that swung between the transplanted\nroyal palms and hibiscus, right up to the wide drive that curved off\nto the house. They halted, did a left face, and stood at parade rest.\nThe two officers, wearing class A's, and a tubby civilian with a brief\ncase came up the drive, trying to look as casual as possible under the\ncircumstances. They paused at the foot of the broad flight of Tennessee\nmarble steps leading up to my perch.\n\nThe leading officer, a brigadier general, no less, looked up at me.\n\n\"May we come up, sir?\" he said.\n\nI looked across at the silent ranks waiting at the foot of the drive.\n\n\"If the boys want a drink of water, Sarge,\" I said, \"tell 'em to come\non over.\"\n\n\"I am General Smale,\" the B.G. said. \"This is Colonel Sanchez of the\nPeruvian Army--\" he indicated the other military type \"--and Mr. Pruffy\nof the American Embassy at Lima.\"\n\n\"Howdy, Mr. Pruffy,\" I said. \"Howdy, Mr. Sanchez. Howdy--\"\n\n\"This ... ah ... call is official in nature, Mr. Legion,\" the general\nsaid. \"It's a matter of great importance, involving the security of\nyour country.\"\n\n\"OK, General,\" I said. \"Come on up. What's happened? You boys haven't\nstarted another war, have you?\"\n\nThey filed up onto the terrace, hesitated, then shook hands, and sat\ndown gingerly in the chairs. Pruffy held his briefcase in his lap.\n\n\"Put your sandwiches on the table, if you like, Mr. Pruffy,\" I said. He\nblinked, gripped the briefcase tighter. I offered my hand-tooled cigars\naround; Pruffy looked startled, Smale shook his head, and Sanchez took\nthree.\n\n\"I'm here,\" the general said, \"to ask you a few questions, Mr. Legion.\nMr. Pruffy represents the Department of State in the matter, and\nColonel Sanchez--\"\n\n\"Don't tell me,\" I said. \"He represents the Peruvian government, which\nis why I don't ask you what an armed American force is doing wandering\naround on Peruvian soil.\"\n\n\"Here,\" Pruffy put in. \"I hardly think--\"\n\n\"I believe you,\" I said. \"What's it all about, Smale?\"\n\n\"I'll come directly to the point,\" he said. \"For some time, the\ninvestigative and security agencies of the US government have been\nbuilding a file on what for lack of a better name has been called 'The\nMartians.'\" Smale coughed apologetically.\n\n\"A little over three years ago,\" he went on, \"an unidentified flying\nobject--\"\n\n\"You interested in flying saucers, General?\" I said.\n\n\"By no means,\" he snapped. \"The object appeared on a number of radar\nscreens, descending from extreme altitude. It came to earth at ...\" he\nhesitated.\n\n\"Don't tell me you came all the way out here to tell me you can't tell\nme,\" I said.\n\n\"--A site in England,\" Smale said. \"American aircraft were dispatched\nto investigate the object. Before they could make identification,\nit rose again, accelerated at tremendous speed, and was lost at an\naltitude of several hundred miles.\"\n\n\"I thought we had better radar than that,\" I said. \"The satellite\nprogram--\"\n\n\"No such specialized equipment was available,\" Smale said. \"An\nintensive investigation turned up the fact that two strangers--possibly\nAmericans--had visited the site only a few hours before\nthe--ah--visitation.\"\n\nI nodded. I was thinking about the close call I'd had when I went back\nto see about lobbing a bomb down the shaft to obliterate the beacon\nstation. There were plainclothes men all over the place, like old maids\nat a movie star's funeral. It was just as well; they never found it.\nThe rocket blasts had collapsed the tunnel, and apparently the whole\nunderground installation was made of non-metallic substances that\ndidn't show up in detecting equipment. I had an idea metal was pass\u00e9\nwhere Foster came from.\n\n\"Some months later,\" Smale went on, \"a series of rather curious\nshort films went on exhibition in the United States. They showed\nscenes representing conditions on other planets, as well as ancient\nand prehistoric incidents here on earth. They were prefaced with\nexplanations that they merely represented the opinions of science\nas to what was likely to be found on distant worlds. They attracted\nwide interest, and with few exceptions, scientists praised their\nverisimilitude.\"\n\n\"I admire a clever fake,\" I said. \"With a topical subject like space\ntravel----\"\n\n\"One item which was commented on as a surprising inaccuracy, in view of\nthe technical excellence of the other films,\" Smale said, \"was the view\nof our planet from space, showing the earth against the backdrop of\nstars. A study of the constellations by astronomers quickly indicated\na 'date' approximately 7000 B.C. for the scene. Oddly, the north polar\ncap was shown centered on Hudson's Bay. No south polar cap was in\nevidence. The continent of Antarctica appeared to be at a latitude of\nsome 30 degrees, entirely free of ice.\"\n\nI looked at him and waited.\n\n\"Now, studies made since that time indicate that nine thousand years\nago, the North Pole was indeed centered on Hudson's Bay,\" Smale said.\n\"And Antarctica was in fact ice-free.\"\n\n\"That idea's been around a long time,\" I said. \"There was a theory----\"\n\n\"Then there was the matter of the views of Mars,\" the general went on.\n\"The aerial shots of the 'canals' were regarded as very cleverly done.\"\nHe turned to Pruffy, who opened his briefcase and handed a couple of\nphotos across.\n\n\"This is a scene taken from the film,\" Smale said. It was an 8x10 color\nshot, showing a row of mounds drifted with pinkish dust, against a\nblue-black horizon.\n\nSmale placed another photo beside the first. \"This one,\" he said, \"was\ntaken by automatic cameras in the successful Mars probe of last year.\"\n\nI looked. The second shot was fuzzy, and the color was shifted badly\ntoward the blue, but there was no mistaking the scene. The mounds were\ndrifted a little deeper, and the angle was different, but they were the\nsame mounds.\n\n\"In the meantime,\" Smale bored on relentlessly, \"a number of novel\nproducts appeared on the market. Chemists and physicists alike were\ndumfounded at the theoretical base implied by the techniques involved.\nOne of the products--a type of pigment--embodied a completely new\nconcept in crystallography.\"\n\n\"Progress,\" I said. \"Why, when I was a boy----\"\n\n\"It was an extremely tortuous trail we followed,\" Smale said. \"But we\nfound that all these curious observations making up the 'Martians'\nfile had, in the end, only one factor in common. And that factor, Mr.\nLegion, was you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nIt was a few minutes after sunrise, and Smale and I were back on the\nterrace toying with the remains of ham steaks and honeydew.\n\n\"That's one advantage of being in jail in your own house--the food's\ngood,\" I commented.\n\n\"I can understand your feelings,\" Smale said. \"Frankly, I didn't relish\nthis assignment. But it's clear that there are matters here which\nrequire explanation. It was my hope that you'd see fit to cooperate\nvoluntarily.\"\n\n\"Take your army and sail off into the sunrise, General,\" I said. \"Then\nmaybe I'll be in a position to do something voluntary.\"\n\n\"Your patriotism alone----\"\n\n\"My patriotism keeps telling me that where I come from, a citizen has\ncertain legal rights,\" I said.\n\n\"This is a matter that transcends legal technicalities,\" Smale said.\n\"I'll tell you quite frankly, the presence of the task force here only\nreceived _ex post facto_ approval by the Peruvian government. They were\nfaced with the _fait accompli_. I mention this only to indicate just\nhow strongly the government feels in this matter.\"\n\n\"Seeing you hit the beach with a platoon of infantry was enough of\na hint for me,\" I said. \"You're lucky I didn't wipe you out with my\ndisintegrator rays.\"\n\nSmale choked on a bite of melon.\n\n\"Just kidding,\" I said. \"But I haven't given you any trouble. Why the\nreinforcements?\"\n\nSmall stared at me. \"What reinforcements?\"\n\nI pointed with a fork. He turned, gazed out to sea. A conning tower\nwas breaking the surface, leaving a white wake behind. It rose higher,\nwater streaming off the deck. A hatch popped open, and men poured out,\nlining up. Smale got to his feet, his napkin falling to the floor.\n\n\"Sergeant!\" he yelled. I sat, open-mouthed, as Smale jumped to the\nstair, went down it three steps at a time. I heard him bellowing, the\nshouts of men and the clatter of rifles being unstacked, feet pounding.\nI went to the marble banister and looked down. Pruffy was out on the\nlawn in purple pajamas, yelping questions. Colonel Sanchez was pulling\nat Smale's arm, also yelling. The Marines were forming up on the lawn.\n\n\"Let's watch those petunias, Sergeant,\" I yelled.\n\n\"Keep out of this, Legion,\" Smale shouted.\n\n\"Why should I be the only one not yelling,\" I yelled. \"After all, I own\nthe place.\"\n\nSmale bounded back up the stairs. \"You're my prime responsibility,\nLegion,\" he barked. \"I'm getting you to a point of maximum security.\nWhere's the cellar?\"\n\n\"I keep it downstairs,\" I said. \"What's this all about? Interservice\nrivalry? You afraid the sailors are going to steal the glory?\"\n\n\"That's a nuclear-powered sub,\" Smale barked. \"Gagarin class; it\nbelongs to the Soviet Navy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI stood there with my mouth open, looking at Smale without seeing him,\nand trying hard to think fast. I hadn't been too startled when the\nMarines showed up; I had gone over the legal aspects of my situation\nmonths before, with a platoon of high-priced legal talent; I knew that\nsooner or later somebody would come around to hit me for tax evasion,\ndraft dodging, or overtime parking; but I was in the clear. The\ngovernment might resent my knowing a lot of things it didn't, but no\none could ever prove I'd swiped them from Uncle Sam. In the end, they'd\nhave to let me go--and my account in a Swiss bank would last me, even\nif they managed to suppress any new developments from my fabulous lab.\nIn a way, I was glad the showdown had come.\n\nBut I'd forgotten about the Russians. Naturally, they'd be interested,\nand their spies were at least as good as the intrepid agents of the US\nSecret Service. I should have realized that sooner or later, they'd pay\na call--and the legal niceties wouldn't slow them down. They'd slap me\ninto a brain laundry, and sweat every last secret out of me as casually\nas I'd squeeze a lemon.\n\nThe sub was fully surfaced now, and I was looking down the barrels of\nhalf a dozen five-inch rifles, any one of which could blast Smale's\nnavy out of the water with one salvo. There were a couple of hundred\nmen, I estimated, putting landing boats over the side and spilling\ninto them. Down on the lawn, the sergeant was snapping orders, and the\nmen were double-timing off to positions that must have been spotted in\nadvance. It looked like the Russians weren't entirely unexpected. This\nwas a game the big boys were playing, and I was just a pawn, caught\nin the middle. My rosy picture of me confounding the bureaucrats was\nfading fast. My island was about to become a battlefield, and whichever\nway it turned out, I'd be the loser. I had one slim possibility; to get\nlost in the shuffle.\n\nSmale grabbed my arm. \"Don't stand there, man!\" he snapped. \"Which\nway--\"\n\n\"Sorry, General,\" I said, and slammed a hard right to his stomach. He\nfolded, but still managed to lunge for me. I gave him a left to the\njaw, and he dropped. I jumped over him, plunged through the French\ndoors, and took the spiral glass stairway four at a time, whirled, and\nslammed the strong-room door behind me. The armored walls would stand\nanything short of a direct hit with a good-sized artillery shell, and\nthe boys down below were unlikely to use any heavy stuff for fear of\ndamaging the goods they'd been sent out to collect. I was safe for a\nlittle while.\n\nNow I had to do some fast, accurate thinking. I couldn't carry much\nwith me--when and if I made it off the island. A few briefing rods,\nmaybe; what was left of the movies. But I had already audited most of\nthe rods; I knew them as well as I know my tax bracket. One listen to\na rod gave you a fast picture of the subject; two or three repeats\nengraved it on your brain. The only reason a man couldn't know\neverything was that too much, too fast, would overload the mind--and\namnesia wiped the slate clean.\n\nI didn't have time to use any more rods, and I couldn't carry anything.\nBut just to walk off and leave it all....\n\nI rummaged through odds and ends, stuffing small items into my pockets.\nI came across a dull silvery cylinder, three inches long, striped in\nblack and gold--a memory-trace. It reminded me of something....\n\nThat was an idea. I still had the U-shaped plastic headpiece that\nFoster had used to acquire a background knowledge of his old home. I\nhad tried it once--for a moment. It had given me a headache in two\nseconds flat, just pressed against my temple. It had been lying here\never since. But maybe now was the time to try it again. Half the items\nI had here in my strong-room were mysteries, like the silver cylinder\nin my hand, but I knew exactly what the plastic headband could give me.\nIt contained all anyone needed to know about Vallon and the Two Worlds,\nand all the marvels they possessed.\n\nI glanced out the armor-glass window. Smale's Marines were trotting\nacross the lawn; the Russians were fanning out along the water's edge.\nIt looked like business all right. Still, it would take them a while\nto get warmed up--and more time still to decide to blast me out of my\nfort. It had taken an hour or so for Foster to soak up the briefing;\nmaybe I wouldn't be much longer at it.\n\nI tossed the cylinder aside, tried a couple of drawers, found the\ninconspicuous strip of plastic that encompassed a whole civilization.\nI carried it across to a chair, settled myself, then hesitated. This\nthing had been designed for an alien brain, not mine. Suppose it burnt\nout my wiring, left me here gibbering, for Smale or the Ruskis to work\nover?\n\nBut the alternative was to leave my island virtually empty-handed,\nsettle for what I might in time manage to salvage from my account--if\nI could devise a way of withdrawing money without calling down the\nGestapo....\n\nNo, I wouldn't go back to poverty without a struggle. What I could\ncarry in my head would give me independence--even immunity from the\ngreed of nations. I could barter my knowledge for my freedom.\n\nThere were plenty of things wrong with this picture, but it was the\nbest I could do on short notice. Gingerly I fitted the U-shaped band to\nmy head. There was a feeling of pressure, then a sensation like warm\nwater rising about me. Panic tried to rise, faded. A voice seemed to\nreassure me. I was among friends, I was safe, all was well....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\n_I lay in the dark, the memory of towers and trumpets and fountains of\nfire in my mind. I put up my hand, felt a coarse garment. Had I but\ndreamed...? I stirred. Light blazed in a widening band above my face.\nThrough narrowed eyes I saw a room, a mean chamber, dusty, littered\nwith ill-assorted rubbish. In a wall there was a window. I went to it,\nstared out upon a green sward, a path that curved downward to a white\nstrand. It was a strange scene, and yet----_\n\n_A wave of vertigo swept over me, faded. I blinked, tried to remember._\n\n_I reached up, felt something clamped over my head. I pulled it off and\nit fell to the floor with a faint clatter: a broad-spectrum briefing\ndevice, of the type used to indoctrinate unidentified citizens who had\nundergone a Change unprepared...._\n\nSuddenly, like water pouring down a drain, the picture in my mind\nfaded, left me standing in my old familiar junk room, with a humming in\nmy head and a throb in my temples. I had been about to try the briefing\ngimmick, and had wondered if it would work. It had--with a vengeance.\nFor a minute there I had stumbled around the room like a stranger,\nyearning for dear old Vallon. I could remember the feeling--but it was\ngone now. I was just me, in trouble as usual.\n\nThere were a lot of tantalizing ideas floating around in my mind,\nright at the edge of consciousness. Later I'd have to sit down and go\nover them carefully. Right now, I had my hands full. Two armies had\nme cornered, and all the guns belonged to the opposition. That part\nwas okay; I didn't want to fight anybody. All I wanted out of this\nsituation was me.\n\nA rattle of gunfire outside brought me to the window in a jump. It\nwas the same view as a few moments before, but it made more sense\nnow. There was the still smoking wreckage of the PT boat, sunk in\nten feet of water a few yards from the end of the jetty. Somebody\nmust have tried to make a run for it. The Russian sub was nowhere in\nsight; probably it had landed the men and backed out of danger from\nany unexpected quarter. Two or three corpses lay in view, down by the\nwater's edge. From where I stood I couldn't say whether they were good\nguys or villains.\n\nThere were more shots, coming from somewhere off to the left. It looked\nlike the boys were fighting it out old style: hand to hand, with small\narms. It figured; after all, what they wanted was me and all my clever\nideas intact, not a smoking ruin.\n\nI don't know whether it was my romantic streak or my cynical one that\nhad made me drive the architect nuts putting secret passages in the\nwalls of my chateau and tunnels under the lawn, but I was glad now I\nhad them. There was a narrow door in the west wall of the strong-room\nthat gave onto a tight spiral stair. From there I could take my choice:\nthe boathouse, the edge of the woods behind the house, or the beach a\nhundred yards north of the jetty. All I had to do was----\n\nThe house trembled a split second ahead of a terrific blast that\nslammed me to the floor. I felt blood start from my nose. Head ringing,\nI scrambled to my feet, groped through the dust to my escape hatch.\nSomebody outside was getting impatient. It wouldn't do to have my fancy\ngetaway route fall in before I had used it. I felt another shell hit\nthe house: mortars, I guessed, or rockets. I must have slept through\nthe preliminaries and wakened just in time for the main bout.\n\nMy fingers were on the sensitive pressure areas that worked the\nconcealed door. I took a last glance around the room, where the\ndust was just settling from the last blast. My eyes fell on a plain\npewter-colored cylinder lying where I had tossed it an hour before--but\nnow I knew what it was. In one jump I was across the room and had\ngrabbed it up. I remembered finding it aboard the lifeboat when I\ntidied up; it had lain concealed among the bones of the man with\nthe bear-tooth necklace. He must have come across it, admired its\npretty colors, and tucked it away in his fur pants. And now I, with\nmy Vallonian memories banked in my mind, could appreciate just how\nprecious an object it was. It was Foster's memory. It would be only a\ncopy, undoubtedly; still, I couldn't leave it behind.\n\nA blast heavier than the last one rocked the house; a big chunk of\nplaster fell. It was way past time to go. Snorting and coughing from\nthe dust, I got back to the emergency door, went through it, and\nstarted down.\n\nAt the bottom I paused to think it over, and the earth jumped again.\nI fell back, saw the roof of the beach tunnel collapse. That left\nthe woods and the boathouse. I didn't have much time to decide; the\ntunnels might go any second. Apparently my architect had economized\non the tunnel shorings. But then, he hadn't figured on any major wars\nhappening in the front yard.\n\nThe fight was going on, as near as I could judge, to the south of the\nhouse and behind it. Probably the woods were full of skirmishers,\ntaking advantage of the cover. The best bet was the boathouse, direct.\nI'd have preferred to wait until dark, but the idea didn't seem\npractical under the circumstances. I took a deep breath and started\ninto the tunnel. With a little luck I'd find my boat intact. I would\nhave to pull out under the noses of the combatants, but maybe the\nelement of surprise would give me a few hundred yards' start. I had\nenough horses to beat anything afloat to the mainland--if I could make\na clean break.\n\nThe tunnel was dark but that didn't bother me. It ran dead straight\nto the boathouse. I came to the wooden slat door and stood for a\nmoment, listening; everything was quiet. I eased it open and stepped\non to the ramp inside the building. In the gloom polished mahogany and\nchrome-work threw back muted highlights. I circled, slipped the mooring\nrope, and was about to step into the cockpit when I heard the bolt of\na rifle smack home. I whirled, threw myself flat. The deafening _bam!_\nof a .30 calibre fired at close quarters laid a pattern of fine ripples\non the black water. I rolled, hit with a splash that drowned a second\nshot, and dove deep. Three strokes took me under the door, out into the\ngreen gloom of open water. I hugged the yellowish sand of the bottom,\nangled off to the right, and kept going.\n\nI had to get out of my jacket, and somehow I managed it, almost without\nlosing a stroke. And there went all the goodies I'd stashed away in\nthe pockets, down to the bottom of the drink. I still had Foster's\nmemory-trace; it was in my slacks and there wasn't time to get out of\nthem nor to kick off my tennis shoes. Ten strokes, fifteen, twenty. I\nknew my limit: twenty-five good strokes on a full load of air; but I\nhad dived in a hurry....\n\nTwenty-five ... and another ... and one more. And up above a man was\nwaiting, rifle aimed, for my head to break the surface.\n\nThirty strokes, and here I come, ready or not. I rolled on my back, got\nmy face above the surface. I got half a gulp of fresh air before the\nshot slapped spray into my face and echoed off across the water. I sank\nlike a stone, kicked off, and made another twenty-five yards before I\nhad to come up. The rifleman was faster this time. The bullet crossed\nmy shoulder like a hot iron, and I was under water again. My kick-work\nwas weak now; the strength was draining from my arms fast. I had to\nhave air--but I could almost feel the solid smack of a steel-jacketed\nbullet against my skull. I had to keep going. My chest was on fire and\nthere was a whirling blackness all around me. I felt consciousness\nfading, but maybe just one more stroke....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_As from a distance I observed the clumsy efforts of the swimmer,\nwatched the flounderings of the poor, untrained creature...._\n\n_It was apparent that an override of the autonomic system was required.\nWith dispatch I activated cortical area omicron, re-routed the blood\nsupply, drew an emergency oxygen source from stored fats, diverting the\nnecessary energy to break the molecular bonds._\n\n_Now, with the body drawing on internal sources, ample for six hundred\nseconds at maximum demand, I stimulated areas upsilon and mu. I\nchanneled full survival-level energy to the muscle complexes involved,\nincreased power output to full skeletal tolerance, eliminated waste\nmotion._\n\n_The body drove through the water with the fluid grace of a\nsea-denizen...._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI floated on my back, breathing in great surges of cool air and\nblinking at the crimson sky. I had been under water, a few yards from\nshore, drowning. Then there was an awareness, like a voice, telling me\nwhat to do. From out of the mass of Vallionan knowledge I had acquired,\nI had drawn what I needed. And now I was here, half a mile from the\nbeach, winded but intact. But there was no time now to wonder at\nmiracles....\n\nI raised my head and glanced toward the house. A column of smoke rose\nfrom a gaping cavity where the bedroom windows used to be. A man jumped\nup, darted across the lawn, fell. I heard a shot a few seconds later,\nfloating lazily across the still sunset water. There was no visible\nactivity at the water's edge; the rifleman was gone. He probably\nthought he'd finished me, especially if he had noticed blood in the\nwater.\n\nI thought about sharks. I hadn't heard of any in this neighborhood, but\na little blood was just the thing to bait them in. I twisted, got a\nlook at the throbbing burn across my left shoulder where the rifleman's\nbullet had grazed; it was nothing much, just a skin gouge. It didn't\nseem to be bleeding. If it had been, there wasn't much I could do about\nit. It was no time for worrying. I had to keep my mind on the problem\nof getting to the mainland. It was a fifteen-mile swim, but if the boys\non shore could keep each other occupied, I ought to be able to make\nit. I thought again about pulling off my pants and shoes but decided\nagainst it; I'd be in awkward shape without them--if I made it.\n\nI felt beat: as though I hadn't eaten all day--which wasn't too\nstrange, because I hadn't. Well, at least I wouldn't get stomach cramps\nwhile circling the island. From there I'd strike out for shore. And the\nfirst thing I would do when I got out of this would be to order the\nbiggest, rarest steak in South America.\n\nI took a last look toward the house. I could see fire inside it now. I\nguessed each side was rationalizing the destruction as denial to the\nenemy. It had been a nice place and I'd miss it. Some day somebody was\ngoing to pay for it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nI sat at the kitchen table in Margareta's Lima apartment and gnawed\nthe last few shreds off the stripped T-bone, while my girl poured me\nanother cup of coffee.\n\n\"Now tell me about it,\" she said. \"Why did they burn your house? And\nhow did you succeed in getting here?\"\n\n\"They got so interested in the fight, they lost their heads,\" I said.\n\"That's the only explanation I can think of. I thought I'd be as safe\nas a two-dollar watch at a pickpockets' convention: I figured they'd go\nto some pains to avoid damaging me. I guessed wrong.\"\n\n\"But your own people....\"\n\n\"Maybe they were right: they couldn't afford to let the Ruskis get\nme. Funny--if they'd just thought to write me a letter and ask for my\nco-operation....\"\n\n\"But how did you get covered with mud? And the blood stains on your\nback?\"\n\n\"I had a nice long swim: five hours' worth. Then another hour getting\nthrough a mangrove swamp. Lucky I had a moon. Then a three-hour\nhike ... and here I am.\"\n\n\"I hope you're feeling better now that you've had something to eat. You\nlooked terrible.\"\n\n\"Another block and I wouldn't have made it. I felt sucked dry. The\nscratch on my back is nothing, but maybe the shock ... I don't know.\"\n\n\"Lie down now and sleep,\" said Margareta. \"What do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Get me some clothes,\" I said. \"A grey suit, white shirt, black tie and\nshoes. And go to my bank and draw some money, save five thousand. Oh\nyeah, see if there's anything in the papers. If you see anybody hanging\naround the lobby when you come back, don't come up; give me a call and\nI'll meet you.\"\n\nShe stood up. \"This is really awful,\" she said. \"Can't your embassy----\"\n\n\"Didn't I mention it? A Mr. Pruffy, of the Embassy, came along to\nhold Smale's hand ... not to mention a Colonel Sanchez. I wouldn't be\nsurprised if the local cops weren't in the act by now ... unless they\nall think I'm dead. That impression won't last long after you show up\nwith a nice fresh check on my account and spend part of it on a man's\nsuit. I'll get some sleep and light out as soon as you get back.\"\n\n\"Where will you go?\"\n\n\"I'll get to the airport and play it by ear. I don't think they've\nalerted everybody. It was a hush-hush deal, until it went sour; now\nthey're still picking up the pieces.\"\n\n\"The bank won't be open for hours yet,\" said Margareta. \"Go to sleep\nand don't worry. I'll take care of everything.\"\n\nI made it to the bedroom and slid out on the big wide bed, and\nconsciousness slipped away like a silk curtain falling.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI knew I wasn't alone as soon as I opened my eyes. I hadn't heard\nanything, but I could feel someone in the room. I sat up slowly, looked\naround.\n\nHe was sitting in the embroidered chair by the window: an\nordinary-looking fellow in a tan tropical suit, with an unlighted\ncigarette in his mouth and no particular expression on his face.\n\n\"Go ahead, light up,\" I said. \"Don't mind me.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said, in a thin voice. He took a lighter from an inner\npocket, flipped it, held it to the cigarette.\n\nI stood up. There was a blur of motion from my visitor, and the lighter\nwas gone and a short-nosed revolver was in its place.\n\n\"You've got the wrong scoop, mister,\" I said. \"I don't bite.\"\n\n\"I'd rather you wouldn't move suddenly, Mr. Legion,\" he said. He\ncoughed, his eyes on mine. \"My nerves aren't what they used to be.\" The\ngun was still on me.\n\n\"Which side are you working for?\" I said. \"And can I put my shoes on,\nor are you afraid I'll pull a gat out of my sock?\"\n\nHe rested the pistol on his knee. \"Get completely dressed, Mr. Legion.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" I said. \"No can do. No clothes.\"\n\nHe frowned slightly. \"My jacket will be a little small for you,\" he\nsaid. \"But I think you can manage.\"\n\nI was sitting on the bed again. \"I'm going to get out a cigarette,\" I\nsaid. \"Try not to shoot me.\" I reached for a package on the table, lit\nup. His eyes stayed on mine.\n\n\"How come you didn't figure I was dead?\" I asked, blowing smoke at him.\n\n\"We checked the house,\" he said. \"No body.\"\n\n\"Why, you incompetent asses. You were supposed to think I drowned.\"\n\n\"That possibility was considered. But we made the routine checks\nanyway.\"\n\n\"Nice of you to let me sleep it out. How long have you been here?\"\n\n\"Only a few minutes,\" he said. He glanced at his watch. \"We'll have to\nbe going in another fifteen.\"\n\n\"What do you want with me?\" I said. \"You blew up everything you were\ninterested in.\"\n\n\"The Department wants to ask you a few questions.\"\n\n\"Look, I'm just a dumb guy,\" I whined. \"I don't know nothing about all\nthat stuff. I was just the guy that peddled it, see?\"\n\nHe took a drag on his cigarette, squinted at me through the smoke. \"You\nran up an A average in college,\" he said, \"including English.\"\n\n\"You boys really do your homework.\" I looked at the pistol. \"I wonder\nif you'd really shoot me,\" I mused.\n\n\"I'll try to make the position clear,\" he said. \"Just to avoid any\nunfortunate misunderstanding. My instructions are to bring you in,\nalive--if possible. If it appears that you may evade arrest ... or fall\ninto the wrong hands, I'll be forced to use the gun.\"\n\nI pulled my shoes on, thinking it over. My best chance to make a break\nwas now, while there was only one watchdog. But I had a feeling he was\ntelling the truth about shooting me. I had already seen the boys in\naction at the house.\n\nHe got up. \"Let's step into the living room, Mr. Legion.\" I moved past\nhim through the door. In the living room the clock on the mantel said\neleven. I'd been asleep for five or six hours. Margareta ought to be\ngetting back any minute....\n\n\"Put this on,\" he said. I took the light jacket, wedged myself into it,\nlooked at my reflection in the big rectangular mirror that occupied\nmost of a wall above the low divan.\n\n\"It's not the real me,\" I said. \"I usually--\"\n\nThe telephone rang.\n\nI looked at my watchdog. He shook his head. We stood and listened to it\nring. After a while it stopped.\n\n\"We'd better be going now,\" he said. \"Walk ahead of me, please. We'll\ntake the elevator to the basement and leave by the service entrance--\"\n\nHe stopped talking, eyes on the door. There was the rattle of a key.\nThe gun came up.\n\n\"Hold it,\" I snapped. \"It's the girl who owns the apartment.\" I moved\nto face him, my back to the door.\n\n\"That was foolish of you, Legion,\" he said. \"Don't move again.\"\n\nI watched the door in the big mirror on the opposite wall. The knob\nturned, the door swung in ... and a thin brown man in white shirt\nand white pants slipped into the room. As he pushed the door back he\ntransferred a small automatic to his left hand. My keeper threw a lever\non the revolver that was aimed at my belt buckle.\n\n\"Stand absolutely still, Legion,\" he said. \"If you have a chance,\nthat's it.\" He moved aside slightly, looked past me to the newcomer.\nI watched in the mirror as the man in white behind me swiveled to keep\nboth of us covered.\n\n\"This is a fail-safe weapon,\" said my first owner to the new man.\n\"I think you know about them. We leaked the information to you. I'm\nholding the trigger back; if my hand relaxes, it fires, so I'd be a\nlittle careful about shooting, if I were you.\"\n\nThe thin man swallowed, a black leather bow tie bobbing against his\nAdam's apple. He didn't say anything. He was having to make some tough\ndecisions. His instructions would be the same as my other friend's: to\nbring me in alive, if possible.\n\n\"Who does this bird represent?\" I asked my man. I noticed my voice was\npitched half an octave higher than usual.\n\n\"He's a Soviet agent.\"\n\nI looked in the mirror at the man again. \"Nuts,\" I said. \"He looks like\na waiter in a chili joint. He probably came up to take our order.\"\n\n\"You talk too much when you're nervous,\" said my keeper between his\nteeth. He held the gun on me steadily. I watched his trigger finger to\nsee if it looked like relaxing.\n\n\"I'd say it's a stalemate,\" I said. \"Let's take it once more from the\ntop. Both of you go out and--\"\n\n\"Shut up, Legion.\" My man licked his lips, glanced at my face. \"I'm\nsorry. It looks as though--\"\n\n\"You don't want to shoot me,\" I blurted out loudly. In the mirror I had\nseen the door, which was standing ajar, ease open an inch, two inches.\n\"You'll spoil this nice coat....\" I kept on talking: \"And anyway it\nwould be a big mistake, because everybody knows Russian agents are\nstubby men with wide cheekbones and tight hats--\"\n\nSilently Margareta slipped into the room, took two quick steps, and\nslammed a heavy handbag down on the slicked-back pompadour that went\nwith the Adam's apple. The man in white stumbled and fired a round into\nthe rug. The automatic dropped from his hand, and my pal in tan stepped\nto him and hit him hard on the back of the head with his pistol. He\nwhirled toward me, hissed \"Play it smart\" just loud enough for me to\nhear, then turned to Margareta. He slipped the gun into his pocket, but\nI knew he could get it out again in a hurry.\n\n\"Very nicely done, Miss,\" he said. \"I'll have this person removed from\nyour apartment. Mr. Legion and I were just going.\"\n\nMargareta looked at me. I thought over two or three remarks but none of\nthem seemed to fit. I didn't intend to see her get hurt--or involved.\nApparently my FBI type was willing to leave her out of it, if I went\nquietly. On the other hand, this was my last chance to get out of the\nnet before it closed for good. My keeper was watching, waiting for me\nto try something, tip Margareta off....\n\n\"It's okay, honey,\" I said. \"This is Mr. Smith ... of our Embassy.\nWe're old friends.\" I stepped past her, headed for the door. My hand\nwas on the knob when I heard a solid thunk behind me. I whirled in time\nto clip the FBI on the jaw as he fell forward. Margareta looked at me,\nwide-eyed.\n\n\"That handbag packs a wallop,\" I said. \"Nice work, Maggie.\" I knelt,\npulled off the fellow's belt, and cinched his hands behind his back\nwith it. Margareta got the idea, did the same for the other man, who\nwas beginning to groan now.\n\n\"Who are these men?\" she said. \"What----\"\n\n\"I'll tell you all about it later. Right now, I have to get to some\npeople I know, get this story on the wires, out in the open. State'll\nbe a little shy about gunning me down or locking me up without trial,\nif I give the show enough publicity.\"\n\nI reached in my pocket, handed her the black-and-gold-marked cylinder.\n\"Just to be on the safe side,\" I said, \"mail this to me: John Jones--at\nItzenca, general delivery.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Margareta. \"And I have your things.\" She stepped into\nthe hall, came back with a shopping bag and a suit carton. She took a\nwad of bills from her handbag and handed it to me.\n\nI went to her and put my arms around her. \"Listen, honey: as soon as\nI leave, go to the bank and draw fifty grand. Get out of the country.\nThey haven't got anything on you except that you beaned a couple of\nintruders in your apartment, but it'll be better if you disappear.\nLeave an address care of Poste Restante, Basel, Switzerland. I'll get\nin touch when I can.\"\n\nShe put up an argument but I made my point. Twenty minutes later I was\npushing through the big glass doors onto the sidewalk, clean-shaven,\ndressed to the teeth, with five grand on one hip and a .32 on the\nother. I'd had a good meal and a fair sleep, and against me the secret\nservices of two or three countries didn't have a chance.\n\nI got as far as the corner before they nailed me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\n\"You have a great deal to lose,\" General Smale was saying, \"and nothing\nto gain by your stubbornness. You're a young man, vigorous and, I'm\nsure, intelligent. You have a fortune of some million and a quarter\ndollars, which I assure you you'll be permitted to keep. As against\nthat prospect, so long as you refuse to cooperate, we must regard you\nas no better than a traitorous criminal--and deal with you accordingly.\"\n\n\"What have you been feeding me?\" I said. \"My mouth tastes like\nsomebody's old gym shoes and my arm's purple to the elbow. Don't you\nknow it's illegal to administer drugs without a license?\"\n\n\"The nation's security is at stake,\" snapped Smale.\n\n\"The funny thing is, it must not have worked, or you wouldn't be\nbegging me to tell all. I thought that scopolamine or whatever you're\nusing was the real goods.\"\n\n\"We've gotten nothing but gibberish,\" Smale said, \"most of it in an\nincomprehensible language. Who the devil are you, Legion? Where do you\ncome from?\"\n\n\"You know everything,\" I said. \"You told me yourself. I'm a guy named\nLegion, from Mount Sterling, Illinois, population one thousand eight\nhundred and ninety-two.\"\n\n\"I'm a humane man, Legion. But if necessary I'll beat it out of you.\"\n\n\"You?\" I smiled, curling a lip. \"You mean you'll call in a herd of\nplug-uglies: real crooks, to do the dirty work. My only crime is\nknowing something you politicians want, and you're willing to lie,\ncheat, steal, torture, and kill to get it. You know that and so do I;\nlet's not kid each other. I know your measure as a man, Mr. General.\"\n\nSmale had gone white. \"I'm in a position to inflict agonies on you,\nyou insolent rotter,\" he grated. \"I've refrained from doing so. You\nmight add that to your analysis of my character. I'm a soldier; I\nknow my duty. I'm prepared to give my life; if need be, my honor. I'm\neven prepared to forego your good opinion--so long as I obtain for my\ngovernment the information you're withholding.\"\n\n\"Turn me loose; then ask me in a nice way. As far as I know, I haven't\ngot anything of military significance to tell you, but if I were\ntreated as a free citizen I might be inclined to let you be the judge\nof that.\"\n\n\"Tell us now; then you'll go free.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"I invented a combination rocket ship and time machine.\nI traveled around the solar system and made a few short trips back into\nhistory. In my spare time I invented other gadgets. I'm planning to\ntake out patents, so naturally I don't intend to spill any secrets. Can\nI go now?\"\n\nSmale got to his feet. \"Until we can safely move you, you'll remain in\nthis room. You're on the sixty-third floor of the Yordano Building.\nThe windows are of unbreakable glass, in case you contemplate a\nparticularly untidy suicide. Your person has been stripped of all\npotentially dangerous items, though I suppose you could still swallow\nyour tongue and suffocate. The door is of heavy construction, and\nsecurely locked.\"\n\n\"I forgot to tell you,\" I said. \"I mailed a letter to a friend, telling\nhim all about you. The sheriff will be here with a posse any minute\nnow, to spring me----\"\n\n\"You mailed no letter,\" Smale said. \"Unfortunately, we don't feel it\nwould be advisable to allow any furniture to remain here which you\nmight be foolish enough to dismantle for use as a weapon. It's rather\na drab room to spend your future in, but until you decide to cooperate\nthis will be your world.\"\n\nI didn't say anything. I sat on the floor and watched him leave. I\ncaught a glimpse of two uniformed men outside the door. No doubt they'd\ntake turns looking through the peephole. I'd have solitude without\nprivacy. I wondered if Margareta had managed to mail the cylinder.\n\nI stretched out on the floor, which was padded with a nice thick rug,\npresumably so that I wouldn't beat my brains out against it just to\nspite them. I was way behind on my sleep: being interrogated while\nunconscious wasn't a very restful procedure. I wasn't too worried. In\nspite of what Smale said, they couldn't keep me here forever. Maybe\nMargareta had gotten clear and told the story to some newsmen; this\nkind of thing couldn't stay hidden forever. Or could it?\n\nI thought about what Smale had said about my talking gibberish under\nthe narcotics. That was an odd one....\n\nQuite suddenly I got it. By means of the drugs they must have tapped a\nlevel where the Vallonian background briefing was stored: they'd been\nfiring questions at a set of memories that didn't speak English. I\ngrinned, then laughed out loud. Luck was still in the saddle with me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe glass was in double panels, set in aluminum frames and sealed\nwith a plastic strip. The space between the two panels of glass was\nevacuated of air, creating an insulating barrier against the heat of\nthe sun. I ran a finger over the aluminum. It was dural: good tough\nstuff. If I had something to pry with, I might possibly lever the metal\naway from the glass far enough to take a crack at the edge, the weak\npoint of armor-glass ... if I had something to hit it with.\n\nSmale had done a good job of stripping the room--and me. I had my shirt\nand pants and shoes, but no tie or belt. I still had my wallet--empty,\na pack of cigarettes with two wilted weeds in it, and a box of matches.\nSmale had missed a bet: I might set fire to my hair and burn to the\nground. I might also stuff a sock down my throat and strangle, or hang\nmyself with a shoe lace--but I wasn't going to.\n\nI looked at the window some more. The door was too tough to tackle, and\nthe heavies outside were probably hoping for an excuse to work me over.\nThey wouldn't expect me to go after the glass; after all, I was still\nsixty-three stories up. What would I do if I did make it to the window\nsill? But we could worry about that later, after I had smelled the\nfresh air.\n\nMy forefinger found an irregularity in the smooth metal: a short\ngroove. I looked closer, saw a screw head set flush with the aluminum\nsurface. Maybe if the frame was bolted together----\n\nNo such luck; the screw I had found was the only one. What was it for?\nMaybe if I removed it I'd find out. But I'd wait until dark to try it.\nSmale hadn't left a light fixture in the room. After sundown I'd be\nable to work unobserved.\n\nA couple of hours went by and no one came to disturb my solitude, not\neven to feed me. Maybe they planned to starve me out; or maybe they\nweren't used to being jailers and had forgotten the animals had to be\nfed.\n\nI had a short scrap of metal I'd worked loose from my wallet. It was\nmild steel, flimsy stuff, only about an inch long, but I was hoping the\nscrew might not be set too tight. Aluminum threads strip pretty easily,\nso it probably wasn't cinched up too hard.\n\nThere was no point in theorizing. It was dark now; I'd give it a\ntry. I went to the window, fitted the edge of metal into the slotted\nscrew-head, and twisted. It turned, just like that. I backed it off ten\nturns, twenty; it was a thick bolt with fine threads. It came free and\nair whooshed into the hole. The screw apparently sealed the panel after\nthe air was evacuated.\n\nI thought it over. If I could fill the space between the panels with\nwater and let it freeze ... quite a trick in the tropics. I might as\nwell plan to fill it with gin and set it on fire.\n\nI was going in circles. Every idea I had started with 'if'. I needed\nsomething I could manage with the materials at hand: cloth, a box of\nmatches, a few bits of paper.\n\nI got out a cigarette, lit up, and while the match was burning examined\nthe hole from which I'd removed the plug. It was about three-sixteenths\nof an inch in diameter and an inch deep, and there was a hole near the\nbottom communicating with the air space between the glass panels. It\nwas an old-fashioned method of manufacture but it seemed to have worked\nall right: the air was pumped out and the hole sealed with the screw.\nIt had at any rate the advantage of being easy to service if the panel\nleaked. Now, with some way of pumping air _in_, I could blow out the\npanels....\n\nThere was no pump on the premises but I did have some chemicals: the\nmatch heads. They were old style too, like a lot of things in Peru: the\nstrike-once-and-throw-away kind.\n\nI sat on the floor and started to work, chipping the heads off the\nmatchsticks, collecting the dry, purplish material on a scrap of\npaper. Thirty-eight matches gave me a respectable sample. I packed it\ntogether, rolled it in the paper, and crimped the ends. Then I tucked\nthe makeshift firecracker into the hole the screw had come from.\n\nUsing the metal scrap I scraped at the threads of the screw, burring\nthem. Then I started it in the hole, half a dozen turns, until it came\nup against the match heads.\n\nThe shoes Margareta had bought me were the latest thing in Lima styles,\nwith thin soles, pointed toes, and built-up leather heels: Bad on the\nfeet, but just the thing to pound with. I thought about trying to work\nloose a piece of rug to shield my face, but decided against it. I'd\nhave to stand aside and take my chances.\n\nI took the shoe by the toe and hefted it: the flexible sole gave it a\ngood action, like a well-made sap. There were still a couple of 'if's'\nin the equation, but a healthy crack on the screw ought to drive it\nagainst the packed match-heads hard enough to detonate them, and the\nexpanding gasses from the explosion ought to exert enough pressure\nagainst the glass panels to break them. I'd know in a second.\n\nI flattened myself against the wall, brought the shoe up, and laid it\non the screw-head with everything I had....\n\nThere was a deafening boom, a blast of hot air, and a chemical stink,\nthen a gust of cool night wind--and I was on the sill, my back to the\nstreet six hundred feet below, my fingers groping for a hold on the\nledge above the window. I found a grip, pulled up, reached higher, got\nmy feet on the muntin strip, paused to rest for three seconds, reached\nagain....\n\nI pulled my feet above the window level and heard shouts in the room\nbelow:\n\n\"--fool killed himself!\"\n\n\"Get a light in here!\"\n\nI clung, breathing deep, and murmured thanks to the architect who had\nstressed a strong horizontal element in his fa\u00e7ade and arranged the\nstrip windows in bays set twelve inches from the face of the structure.\nNow, if the boys below would keep their eyes on the street long enough\nfor me to get on the roof--\n\nI looked up, to get an idea how far I'd have to go--and gripped the\nledge convulsively as the whole building leaned out, tilting me back....\n\nCold sweat ran into my eyes. I squeezed the stone until my knuckles\ncreaked, and held on. I laid my cheek against the rough plaster,\nlistening to my heart thump. Adrenalin and high hopes had gotten me\nthis far ... and now it had all drained out and left me, a frail\nground-loving animal, flattened against the cruel face of a tower, like\na fly on a ceiling, with nothing between me and the unyielding concrete\nbelow but the feeble grip of fingers and toes. I started to yell for\nhelp, and the words stuck in my dry throat. I breathed in shallow\ngasps, feeling my muscles tightening, until I hung, rigid as a board,\nafraid even to roll my eyeballs for fear of dislodging myself. I closed\nmy eyes, felt my hands going numb, and tried again to yell: only a thin\ncroak emerged.\n\nA minute earlier I had had only one worry: that they'd look up and see\nme. Now my worst fear was that they wouldn't.\n\nThis was the end. I'd been close before, but not like this. My fingers\ncould take the strain for maybe another minute, maybe even two; then\nI'd let go, and the wind would whip at me for a few timeless seconds,\nbefore I hit....\n\nI had had a lot of big ideas but in the cosmic scheme I was a gnat on\na windshield. I thought I'd learned something, was a jump ahead of\nmost guys, and could play the meaningless game with a certain flair.\nBut my fancy philosophies were words written in smoke when they came\nup against the raw power of blind instinct. My conscious mind had an\nI.Q. of 148, but the idiot subconscious that had frozen me here hadn't\nlearned anything since the first ape that had owned it rode out a storm\nin a tree-top and lived to be my ancestor.... I heard a sound and it\nwas me, whimpering. I was a poor weakling, out of his element, bleating\nfor mercy.\n\nDown inside of me something didn't like the picture. A small defiance\nflickered, found a foothold, burned brighter. I would die ... but that\nwould solve a lot of problems. And if I had to die, at least I could\ndie trying.\n\nMy mind moved in to take over from my body. It was the body that was\nwasting my last strength on a precarious illusion of safety, numbing\nmy senses, paralyzing me. It was a tyranny I wouldn't accept. I needed\na cool head and a steady hand and an unimpaired sense of balance;\nand if the imbecile body wouldn't cooperate the mind would take it by\nthe scruff of the neck and force it. I'd been feeding this hulk for\nthirty-odd years; now it would do what I told it. First: loosen the\ngrip--\n\nYes! If it killed me: bend those fingers! Sure, I might fall--all the\nway--and splatter when I hit, but did this lousy slab of meat expect to\nlive forever? I had news for it: time was short, any way you figured.\n\nI was standing a little looser now, my hands resting flat, my legs\ntaking the load. I had a good wide ledge to stand on: nearly a foot,\nand in a minute I was going to reach up and get a new hold and lift one\nfoot at a time ... and if I slipped, at least I'd have done it my way.\n\nI let go, and the building leaned out, and to hell with it....\n\nI felt for the next ledge, gripped it, pulled up, found a toe-hold.\n\nSure, I was dead. It was a long way to the top, and there was a fancy\ncornice I'd never get over, but when the moment came and I started the\nlong ride down I'd thumb my nose at the old hag, Instinct, who hadn't\nbeen as tough as she thought she was....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was under the cornice now, hanging on for a breather, and listening\nto the hooting and hollering from the window far below. A couple of\nheads had popped out and taken a look, but it was dark up where I was\nand all the attention was centered down where the crowd had gathered\nand lights were playing, looking for a mess. Pretty soon now they'd\nbegin to get the drift--so I'd better be going.\n\nI looked up at the overhang ... and felt the old urge to clutch and\nhang on. So I leaned outward a little further, just to show me who\nwas boss. It was a long reach, and I'd have to risk it all on one\nlunge because, if I missed, there wasn't any net, and my fingers knew\nit. I heard my nails rasp on the plaster. I grated my teeth together\nand unhooked one hand: it was like a claw carved from wood. I took\na half-breath, bent my knees slightly; they were as responsive as a\ncouple of bumper-jacks bolted on to the hip. Tough; but it was now or\nnever....\n\nI let go with both hands and stretched, leaning back....\n\nMy wooden hands bumped the edge, scrabbled, hooked on, as my legs\nswung free, and I was hanging like an old-time sailor strung up by\nthe thumbs. A wind off the roof whipped at my face and now I was a\ntissue-paper doll, fluttering in the breeze.\n\nI had to pull now, pull hard, heave myself up and over the edge, but I\nwas tired, too tired. My crepe paper arms with the wooden hands seemed\nto belong to someone else, someone who'd been dead a long time....\n\nBut the someone was me: death was an old story, one that I wrote\nmyself. This was something that had happened before, long ago, and the\npalindrome of life was finished where it started, and a dark curtain\nwas falling....\n\nThen from the darkness a voice was speaking in a strange language: a\nconfusion of strange thought symbols, but through them an ever more\ninsistent call:\n\n_... dilate the secondary vascular complex, shunt full conductivity to\nthe upsilon neuro-channel. Now, stripping oxygen ions from fatty cell\nmasses, pour in electro-chemical energy to the sinews...._\n\nWith a smooth surge of power I pulled myself up, fell forward, rolled\nonto my back, and lay on the flat roof, the beautiful flat roof, still\nwarm from the day's sun.\n\nI was here, looking at the stars, safe; and later on when I had more\ntime I'd stop to think about it. But now I had to move, before they\nhad time to organize themselves, cordon off the building, and start a\nfloor-by-floor search.\n\nStaggering from the exertion of the long climb I got to my feet, went\nto the shed housing the entry to the service stair. The door was\nlocked. I didn't waste any time kicking at it; I got a leg up and stood\non the doorknob. Two jumps and it snapped off. I pushed the stub of the\nshaft through and tickled the back edge of the locking tongue, eased it\nout. The door opened.\n\nA short flight of steps led down to a storeroom. There were dusty\nboards, dried-up paint cans, odd tools. I picked up a five-foot length\nof two-by-four and a hammer with one claw missing, and stepped out into\nthe hall. The street was a long way down and I didn't feel like wasting\ntime with stairs. I found the elevator, pushed the button, stood in\nfront of it whistling. A fat man in a drab suit came along, looked\nat me distastefully, thought about telling me that workmen used the\nfreight elevator, then changed his mind and said nothing.\n\nThe elevator arrived. I stepped in jauntily. The fat man followed me,\npushed the button for the foyer. I smiled and nodded, went on whistling.\n\nWe stopped and the doors opened. I waited for the fat man to leave,\nthen glanced out, tightening my grip on the hammer, and followed.\nI could see the lights in the street out front and in the distance\nthere was the wail of a siren, but nobody in the lobby looked my way.\nI headed across toward the side exit, dumped the board at the door,\ntucked the hammer in the waist band of my pants, and stepped out onto\nthe pavement. There were a lot of people hurrying past but this was\nLima: they didn't waste a glance on a barefooted carpenter.\n\nI moved off, not hurrying. There was a lot of rough country between\nme and Itzenca, the little town near which the life boat was hidden\nin a ca\u00f1on, but I aimed to cover it in a week. Some time between now\nand tomorrow I'd have to figure out a way to equip myself with a few\nnecessities, but I wasn't worried. A man who had successfully taken up\nhuman-fly work in middle life wouldn't have any trouble stealing a pair\nof boots.\n\nFoster had shoved off for home three years ago, local time, although to\nhim, aboard the ship, only a few weeks might have passed. My lifeboat\nwas a midge compared to the mother ship he rode, but it had plenty of\nspeed. Once aboard the lugger ... and maybe I could put a little space\nbetween me and the big boys I was up against now.\n\nI had used the best camouflage I knew of on the boat. The near-savage\nnative bearers who had done my unloading and carried my Vallonian\ntreasures across the desert to the nearest railhead were not the\ngossipy type. If General Smale's boys had heard about the boat, they\nhadn't mentioned it. And if they had: well, I'd solve that one when I\ngot to it. There were still quite a few 'if's' in the equation, but my\narithmetic was getting better all the time.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nI took the precaution of sneaking up on the lifeboat in the dead of\nnight, but I could have saved myself a crawl. Except for the fact that\nthe camouflage nets had rotted away to shreds, the ship was just as I\nhad left it, doors sealed. Why Smale's team hadn't found it, I didn't\nknow; I'd think that one over when I was well away from Earth.\n\nIt had been a long tough trip from Lima to the ca\u00f1on, but I had made\nit without interference. I had swapped my platinum finger ring for a\nbeat-up .38 pistol, but I hadn't had to use it. In a shabby bar in\none of the villages I passed through I had heard a battered radio\nsputtering news; there was no mention of the assault on the island, or\nof my escape. It seemed that all parties were willing to cover it up\nand pretend it hadn't happened.\n\nI went into the post office at Itzenca and picked up the parcel\nMargareta had mailed me with Foster's memory-trace in it. While I was\nchecking to see whether Uncle Sam's minions had intercepted the package\nand substituted a carrot, I felt something rubbing against my shin.\nI glanced down and saw a grey and white cat, reasonably clean and\nobviously hungry. I don't know whether I'd ploughed through a field of\nwild catnip the night before or if it was my way with a finger behind\nthe furry ears, but Kitty followed me out of Itzenca and right into the\nbush. She kept pace with me, leading most of the time, as far as the\nspace boat, and was the first one aboard.\n\nI didn't waste time with formalities. I had once audited a briefing\nrod on the boat's operation--not that I had ever expected to use the\ninformation for a take-off. Once aboard, I hit the controls and cut a\nswathe through the atmosphere that must have sent fingers jumping for\npanic buttons from Washington to Moscow.\n\nI didn't know how many weeks or months of unsullied leisure stretched\nahead of me now. There would be time and to spare for exploring the\nboat, working out a daily routine, chewing over the details of both my\nmemories, and laying plans for my arrival on Foster's world, Vallon.\nBut first I wanted to catch a show that was making a one-night stand\nfor me only: the awe-inspiring spectacle of the retreating earth.\n\nI dropped into a seat opposite the screen and flipped into view the big\nluminous ball of wool that was my home planet. I'd been hoping to get\na last look at my island, but I couldn't see it. The whole sphere was\nblanketed in cloud: a thin worn blanket in places but still intact.\nBut the moon was a sight! An undipped Edam cheese with the markings of\nRoquefort. For a quarter of an hour I watched it grow until it filled\nmy screen. It was too close for comfort. I dumped the tabby out of my\nlap and adjusted a dial. The dead world swept past, and I had a brief\nglimpse of burst bubbles of craters that became the eyes and mouth and\npock marks of a face on a head that swung away from me in disdain and\nthen the sibling planets dwindled and were gone forever.\n\nThe lifeboat was completely equipped, and I found comfortable quarters.\nAn ample food supply was available by the touch of a panel on the table\nin the screen-room. That was a trick my predecessor with the dental\njewelery hadn't discovered, I guessed. During the courses of my first\njourney earthward and on my visits to the boat for saleable playthings\nwhile she lay in dry-dock, I had discovered most of the available\namenities aboard. Now I luxuriated in a steaming bath of recycled\nwater, sponged down with disposable towels packed in scented alcohol,\nfed the cat and myself, and lay down to sleep for about two weeks.\n\nBy the third week I was reasonably refreshed and rested. The scars from\nmy recent brushes with what passed as the law were healed. I had gotten\nover regretting the toys I'd left behind on my island and the money in\nmy banks in Lima and Switzerland, and even Margareta. I was headed for\na new world; there was no point in dragging along old attachments.\n\nThe cat was a godsend, I began to realize. I named her Itzenca, after\nthe village where she adopted me, and I talked to her by the hour. I\nalways had felt that there was a subtle difference between talking to\nsomebody else and talking to yourself. The latter gets a little tedious\nafter the first few days but you can keep the other up indefinitely. So\nItz got talked to plenty as we rode to the stars.\n\n\"Say, Itz,\" said I, \"where would you like your sand box situated? Right\nthere in front of the TV screen? There's not much traffic there, since\nwe cleared the solar system. You'd have the place all to yourself.\"\n\nNo, said Itzenca by a flirt of her tail. And she walked over behind a\ncrate that had never been unloaded on earth.\n\nI pulled out a box of junk and slid the sand box in its place. Itzenca\npromptly lost interest and instead jumped up on the junk box which fell\noff the bench and scattered small objects of khaff and metal in all\ndirections.\n\n\"Come back here, blast you,\" I said, \"and help me pick up this stuff.\"\n\nItz bounded after a dull-gleaming silver object that was still rolling.\nI was there almost as quick as she was and grabbed up the cylinder.\nSuddenly the horsing around was over. This thing was somebody's memory.\n\nI dropped onto a bench to examine it, my Vallonian-inspired pulse\npounding. \"Where the heck did this come from, cat?\" I said.\n\nItz jumped up into my lap and nosed the cylinder. I was trying to hark\nback to those days three years before when I had loaded the lifeboat\nwith all the loot it would carry, for the trip back to earth.\n\n\"Listen, Itz, we've got to do some tall remembering. Let's see: there\nwas a whole rack of blanks in the memory-recharging section of the room\nwhere we found the three skeletons. Yeah, now I remember: I pulled this\none out of the recorder set, which means it had been used, but not yet\ncolor-coded. I showed it to Foster when he was hunting his own trace.\nHe didn't realize I'd pulled it out of the machine and he thought it\nwas an empty. But I'll bet you somebody had his mind taped, and then\nleft in a hurry, before the trace could be color-coded and filed.\n\n\"On the other hand, maybe it's a blank that had just been inserted\nwhen somebody broke up the play-house.... But wasn't there something\nFoster said ... about when he woke up, way back when, with a pile of\nfresh corpses around him? He gave somebody emergency treatment and to a\nVallonian that would include a complete memory-transcription.... Do you\nrealize what I've got here in my hand, Itz?\"\n\nShe looked up at me inquiringly.\n\n\"This is what's left of the guy that Foster buried: his pal, Ammaerln,\nI think he called him. What's inside this cylinder used to be tucked\naway in the skull of the ancient sinner. The guy's not so dead after\nall. I'll bet his family will pay plenty for this trace, and be\ngrateful besides. That'll be an ace in the hole in case I get too\nhungry on Vallon.\"\n\nI got up and crossed the apartment; Itz followed me out to my sleeping\ncouch. I dropped the trace in a drawer beside Foster's own memory.\n\n\"Wonder how Foster's making out without his past, Itz? He claimed\nthe one I've got here would only be a copy of the original stored\nat Okk-Hamiloth, but my briefing didn't say anything about copying\nmemories. He must be somebody pretty important to rate that service.\"\n\nSuddenly my eyes were riveted to the markings on Foster's trace lying\nin the drawer. \"'Sblood! The royal colors!\" I sat down on the bed with\na lurch. \"Itzenca, old gal, it looks like we'll be entering Vallonian\nsociety from the top. We've been consorting with a member of the\nVallonian nobility!\"\n\nDuring the days that followed, I tried again and again to raise Foster\non the communicator ... without result. I wondered how I'd find him\namong the millions on the planet. My best bet would be to get settled\ndown in the Vallonian environment, then start making a few inquiries.\n\nI would play it casually: act the part of a Vallonian who had merely\nbeen travelling for a few hundred years--which wasn't unheard of--and\nplay my cards close to my gravy stains until I learned what the score\nwas. With my Vallonian briefing I ought to be able to carry it off. The\nVallonians might not like illegal immigrants any better than they did\nback home, so I'd keep my interesting foreign background to myself.\n\nI would need a new name. I thought over several possibilities and\nselected \"Drgon\". It was as good a Vallonian jawbreaker as any.\n\nI canvassed the emergency wardrobe that was standard equipment\non Far-Voyager lifeboats. There was everything from fur-lined\nparka-type suits for outings on worlds like Pluto to sheer silk\none-man-air-conditioner balloon over-alls for stepping out on Venus. In\namongst them was a selection of dresses reminiscent of ancient Greece.\nThey had been the sharp style of Vallon when Foster left home. They\nlooked comfortable. I picked one in a sober color, then got busy with\nthe cutting and seaming unit to fit it to my frame. I didn't plan to\nattract unnecessary attention with ill-fitting garments when I crossed\nmy first Vallonians.\n\nItzenca watched with interest. \"What the heck am I going to do with you\non Vallon?\" I asked her. \"The only cat on the planet. You may have to\nput up with an iggrfn for a boy friend,\" I said searching my Vallonian\nmemory. \"They're about the nearest thing to you in size and shape ...\nbut they're kind of objectionable, personality wise.\"\n\nI finished off my new duds, then dug through the handicrafts gear and\npicked out a sheet of khaffite, a copper-like Vallonian alloy that\nwas supposed to have almost the durability of khaff without being so\nhard to work. There were appropriate tools in the little workshop for\nshaping it and adding decoration.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" I said to Itz. \"You won't go ashore shabbily clad\neither. You'll be a knockout in this item.\" I parked her on the\nworkbench and sat down to my tools. I clipped out an inch-wide strip\nof the khaffite, shaped it in a circle, and fitted it with a slip-out\ncatch. After a leisurely meal I spent what passed for an evening\netching \"ITZENCA\" on the new collar with plenty of curlicues.\nThen I fitted it on her; she didn't seem to mind a bit.\n\n\"There. All set to wow those Vallonians like they've never been wowed.\"\nItzenca purred.\n\nWe strolled into the observation lounge. Strange bright-hued star\nsystems glowed far away. \"We'll be stepping out with our memories any\nnight now,\" I said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe proximity alarms were ringing. I watched the screen with its image\nof a great green world rimmed on one edge with glaring white from the\ndistant giant sun, on the other flooded with a cool glow reflected\nfrom the blue outer planet. The trip was almost over and my confidence\nwas beginning to fray around the edges. In a few minutes I would be\nstepping into an unknown world, all set to find my old pal Foster and\nsee the sights. I didn't have a passport, but there was no reason to\nanticipate trouble. All I had to do was let my natural identity take\na back seat and allow my Vallonian background to do the talking. And\nyet....\n\nNow Vallon spread out below us, a misty grey-green landscape, bright\nunder the glow of the immense moonlike sister world, Cinte. I had set\nthe landing monitor for Okk-Hamiloth, the capital city of Vallon. That\nwas where Foster would have headed, I guessed. Maybe I could pick up\nthe trail there.\n\nThe city was directly below: a vast network of blue-lit avenues. I\nhadn't been contacted by Planetary Control. That was normal enough,\nhowever. A small vessel coming in on auto could handle itself.\n\nA little apprehensively I ran over my lines a last time: I was Drgon,\ncitizen of the Two Worlds, back from a longer-than-average season\nof far-voyaging and in need of briefing rods to bring me up to date\non developments at home. I also required assignment of quarters. My\ntailoring was impeccable, my command of the language a little rusty\nfrom long non-use, and the only souvenirs I had to declare were a\ntattered native costume from my last port of call, a quaint weapon from\nthe same, and a small animal I had taken a liking to.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe landing ring was visible on the screen now, coming slowly up to\nmeet us. There was a gentle shock and then absolute stillness. I\nwatched the port cycle open; I went to it and looked out at the pale\ncity stretching away to the hills. I took a breath of the fragrant\nnight air spiced with a long-forgotten perfume, and the part of me that\nwas now Vallonian ached with the inexpressible emotion of homecoming.\n\nI started to buckle on my pistol and gather up a few belongings, then\ndecided to wait until I'd met the welcoming committee. I whistled to\nItzenca and we stepped out and down. We crossed the clipped green,\nluminous in the glow from the lights over the high-arched gate marking\nthe path that curved up toward the bright-lit terraces above. There\nwas no one in sight. Bright Cintelight showed me the gardens and walks\nand, when I reached the terraces, the avenues beyond ... but no people.\nI stood by a low wall of polished marble and thought about it. It was\nabout midnight, and the nights on Vallon lasted twenty-eight hours,\nbut there should have been some activity here. This was a busy port:\nscheduled vessels, private yachts, official ships, all of them came and\nwent from Okk-Hamiloth. But not tonight.\n\nThe cat and I walked across the terrace, passed through the open arch\nto a refreshment lounge. The low tables and cushioned couches stood\nempty under the rosy light from the ceiling panels. My slippered feet\nwhispered on the polished floor.\n\nI stood and listened: dead silence. There wasn't even the hum of a\nmosquito; all such insect pests had been killed off long ago. The\nlights glowed, the tables waited invitingly. How long had they waited?\n\nI sat down at one of them and thought hard. I had made a lot of plans,\nbut I hadn't counted on a deserted spaceport. How was I going to ask\nquestions about Foster if there was no one to ask?\n\nI got up and moved on through the empty lounge, past a wide arcade,\nout onto a terraced lawn. A row of tall poplar-like trees made a\ndark wall beyond a still pool, and behind them distant towers loomed,\ncolored lights sparkled. A broad avenue swept in a wide curve between\nfountains, slanted away to the hills. A hundred yards from where I\nstood a small vehicle was parked at the curb; I headed for it.\n\nIt was an open two-seater, low-slung, cushioned, finished in violet\ninlays against bright chrome. I slid into the seat, looked over the\ncontrols, while Itzenca skipped to a place beside me. There was a\nsimple lever arrangement: a steering tiller. It looked easy. I tried a\nfew pulls and pushes; lights blinked on the panel, the car quivered,\nlifted a few inches, drifted slowly across the road. I moved the\ntiller, twiddled things; the car moved off toward the towers. I didn't\nlike the controls; a wheel and a couple of foot pedals would have\nsuited me better; but it beat walking.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo hours later we had cruised the city ... and found nothing. It\nhadn't changed from what my extra memory recalled--except that all the\npeople were gone. The parks and boulevards were trimmed, the fountains\nand pools sparkled, the lights glowed ... but nothing moved. The\nautomatic dust precipitators and air filters would run forever, keeping\nthings clean and neat; but there was no one there to appreciate it. I\npulled over, sat watching the play of colored lights on a waterfall,\nand considered. Maybe I'd find more of a clue inside one of the\nbuildings. I left the car and picked one at random: a tall slab of\npink crystal. Inside, I looked around at a great airy cavern full of\nrose-colored light and listened to the purring of the cat and my own\nbreathing. There was nothing else to hear.\n\nI picked a random corridor, went along it, passed through empty rooms.\nIt was all in the old Vallonian style: walls paneled in jade, brocades\nhangings in iridescent colors, rugs like pools of fire. In one chamber\nI picked up a cloak of semi-velvet and put it over my shoulders; I was\ngetting cold in my daytime street dress. Walking among the tangible\nghosts of the long past didn't warm me up any. We climbed a wide spiral\nstair, passed from vacant room to vacant room. I thought of the people\nwho had once used them. Where were they now?\n\nI found a clarinet-like musical instrument and blew a few notes on it.\nIt had a deep mellow tone that echoed along the deserted corridor. I\nthought it sounded a lot like I felt: sad and forgotten. I went out\nonto a lofty terrace overlooking gardens, leaned on a balustrade, and\nlooked up at the brilliant disc of Cinte. It loomed enormous, its\ndiameter four times that of the earthly moon.\n\n\"We've come a long way to find nothing,\" I said to Itzenca. She pushed\nher way along my leg and flexed her tail in a gesture meant to console.\nBut it didn't help. After the long wait, the tension of expectation, I\nfelt suddenly as empty as the silent halls of the building.\n\nI sat on the balustrade and leaned back against the polished pink\nwall, took out the clarinet and blew some blue notes. That which once\nhad been was no more; remembering it, I played the _Pavane for a\nDead Princess_, and felt a forlorn nostalgia for a glory I had never\nknown....\n\nI finished and looked up at a sound. Four tall men in grey cloaks and\na glitter of steel came toward me from the shadows.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had dropped the clarinet and was on my feet. I tried to back up but\nthe balustrade stopped me. The four spread out. The man in the lead\nfingered a wicked-looking short club and spoke to me--in gibberish. I\nblinked at him and tried to think of a snappy comeback.\n\nHe snapped his fingers and two of the others came up; they reached for\nmy arms. I started to square off, fist cocked, then relaxed; after all,\nI was just a tourist, Drgon by name. Unfortunately, before I could get\nmy fist back, the man with the club swung it and caught me across the\nforearm. I yelled, jumped back, found myself grappled by the others. My\narm felt dead to the shoulder. I tried a kick and regretted that too;\nthere was armor under the cloaks. The club wielder said something and\npointed at the cat....\n\nIt was time I wised up. I relaxed, tried to coax my _alter ego_ into\nthe foreground. I listened to the rhythm of the language: it was\nVallonian, badly warped by time, but I could understand it:\n\n\"----musician would be an Owner!\" one of them said.\n\nLaughter.\n\n\"Whose man are you, piper? What are your colors?\"\n\nI curled my tongue, tried to shape it around the sort of syllables\nI heard them uttering; it seemed to me a gross debasement of the\nVallonian I knew. Still I managed an answer:\n\n\"I ... am a ... citizen ... of Vallon.\"\n\n\"A dog of a masterless renegade?\" The man with the club hefted it,\nglowered at me. \"And what wretched dialect is that you speak?\"\n\n\"I have ... been long a-voyaging,\" I stuttered. \"I ask ... for briefing\nrods ... and for a ... dwelling place.\"\n\n\"A dwelling place you'll have,\" the man said. \"In the men's shed at\nRath-Gallion.\" He gestured, and handcuffs snapped on my wrists.\n\nHe turned and stalked away, and the others hustled me after him. Over\nmy shoulder I got a glimpse of a cat's tail disappearing over the\nbalustrade. Outside, a long grey air-car waited on the lawn. They\ndumped me in the back seat, climbed aboard. I got a last look at the\nspires of Okk-Hamiloth as we tilted, hurtled away across the low hills.\n\nSomewhere in the shuffle I had lost my new cloak. I shivered. I\nlistened to the talk, and what I heard didn't make me feel any better.\nThe chain between my wrists kept up a faint jingling. I gathered I'd\nbe hearing a lot of that kind of music from now on. I had had an\nidealistic notion of wanting to fit into this new world, find a place\nin its society. I'd found a place all right: a job with security.\n\nI was a slave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nIt was banquet night at Rath-Gallion, and I gulped my soup in the\nkitchen and ran over in my mind the latest batch of jingles I was\nexpected to perform. I had only been on the Estate a few weeks, but I\nwas already Owner Gope's favorite piper. If I kept on at this rate, I\nwould soon have a cell to myself in the slave pens.\n\nSime, the pastry cook, came over to me.\n\n\"Pipe us a merry tune, Drgon,\" he said, \"and I'll reward you with a\nfrosting pot.\"\n\n\"With pleasure, good Sime,\" I said. I finished off the soup and got out\nmy clarinet. I had tried out half a dozen strange instruments, but I\nstill liked this one best. \"What's your pleasure?\"\n\n\"One of the outland tunes you learned far-voyaging,\" called Cagu, the\nbodyguard.\n\nI complied with the _Beer Barrel Polka_. They pounded the table and\nhallooed when I finished, and I got my goody pan. Sime stood watching\nme scrape at it.\n\n\"Why don't you claim the Chief Piper's place, Drgon?\" Sime said. \"You\npipe rings around the lout. Then you'd have freeman status, and could\nsit among us in the kitchen almost as an equal.\"\n\nI went after the last of the chocilla frosting, licked my fingers, and\nlaid the pot aside.\n\n\"I'd gladly be the equal of such a pastry cook as yourself, good Sime,\"\nI said. \"But what can a slave-piper do?\"\n\nSime blinked at me. \"You can challenge the Chief Piper,\" he said.\n\"There's none can deny you're his master in all but name. Don't fear\nthe outcome of the Trial; you'll triumph sure.\" He glanced around at\nthe kitchen staff. \"Is it not so, goodmen?\"\n\n\"I'll warrant it,\" the soup-master said. \"If you lose, I'll take your\nstripes for you.\"\n\n\"You're going too fast for me, goodmen,\" I said. \"How can I claim\nanother's place?\"\n\nSime waved his arms. \"You have far-voyaged long indeed, Piper Drgon.\nKnow you naught of how the world wags these days? One would take you\nfor a Cintean heretic.\"\n\n\"As I've said, goodmen: in my youth all men were free; and the High\nKing ruled at Okk-Hamiloth----\"\n\n\"'Tis ill to speak of these things,\" said Sime in a low tone. \"Only\nOwners know their former lives ... though I've heard it said that long\nago no man was so mean but that he recorded his lives and kept them\nsafe. How you came by yours, I ask not; but do not speak of it. Owner\nGope is a jealous master. Though a most generous and worshipful lord,\"\nhe added hastily, looking around.\n\n\"I won't speak of it then, good Sime,\" I said. \"But I have been long\naway. Even the language has changed, so that I wrench my tongue in the\nspeaking of it. Advise me, if you will.\"\n\nSime puffed out his cheeks, frowning at me. \"I scarce know where\nto start,\" he said. \"All things belong to the Owners ... as is only\nright.\" He looked around for confirmation. The others nodded. \"Men of\nlow skill are likewise property; and 'tis well 'tis so; else would they\nstarve as masterless strays ... if the Greymen failed to find them\nfirst.\" He made a sign and spat. So did everybody else.\n\n\"Now men of good skill are freemen, each earning rewards as befits his\nability. I am Chief Pastry Cook to the Lord Gope, with the perquisites\nof that station, therefore that none other equals my talents.\" He\nlooked around truculently, saw no challengers. \"And thus it is with us\nall.\"\n\n\"And if some varlet claims the place of any man here,\" put in Cagu,\n\"then he gotta submit to the Trial.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Sime, pulling at his apron agitatedly, \"this upstart\npastry cook must cook against me; and all in the Hall will judge; and\nhe who prevails is the Chief Pastry Cook, and the other takes a dozen\nlashes for his impertinence.\"\n\n\"But fear not, Drgon,\" spoke Cagu. \"A Chief Piper ain't but a\nfive-stroke man. Only a tutor is lower down among freemen. And anyway,\nthe good Soup-master had promised to take the lash for you.\"\n\nThere was a bellow from the door, and I grabbed my clarinet and\nscrambled after the page. Owner Gope didn't like to wait around for\npiper-slaves. I saw him looming up at his place, as I darted through to\nmy assigned position within the huge circle of the viand-loaded table.\nThe Chief Piper had just squeezed his bagpipe-like instrument and\nreleased a windy blast of discordant sound. He was a lean, squint-eyed\ncreature, fond of ordering the slave-pipers about. He pranced in an\nintricate pattern, pumping away at his vari-colored bladders, until\nI winced at the screech of it. Owner Gope noticed him about the same\ntime. He picked up a heavy brass mug and half-rose to peg it at the\nChief Piper, who saw it just in time to duck. The mug hit a swollen\nair-bag; a yellow one with green tassels; it burst with a sour bleat.\n\n\"As sweet a note as has been played tonight,\" roared Owner Gope.\n\"Begone, lest you call up the hill devils----\"\n\nHis eye fell on me. \"Here's Dugon, or Digen,\" he cried. \"Now here's a\ntrue piper. Summon up a fair melody, Dgron, to clear the fumes of the\nlast performer from the air before the wine sours.\"\n\nI bowed low, wet my lips, and launched into the _One O' Clock Jump_.\nTo judge from the roar that went up when I finished, they liked it. I\nfollowed with _Little Brown Jug_ and _String of Pearls_. Gope pounded\nand the table quieted down.\n\n\"The rarest slave in all Rath-Gallion, I swear it,\" he bellowed. \"Were\nhe not a slave, I'd drink his health.\"\n\n\"By your leave, Owner?\" I said.\n\nGope stared, then nodded indulgently. \"Speak then, Dugong,\" he said.\n\n\"I claim the place of Chief Piper. I----\"\n\nYells rang out; Gope grinned widely.\n\n\"So be it,\" he said. \"Shall the vote be taken now, or must we submit\nto more of the vile bladderings ere we proclaim our good Dagron Chief\nPiper?\"\n\n\"Proclaim him!\" somebody shouted.\n\n\"There must be a Trial,\" another offered dubiously.\n\nGope slammed a huge hand against the table. \"Bring Lylk, the Chief\nPiper, before me,\" he yelled. \"He of the wretched air-skins.\"\n\nThe Piper reappeared, fingering his bladders nervously.\n\n\"The place of the Chief Piper is declared vacant,\" Gope said loudly.\nThe piper pinched a pink bladder, which emitted a thin squeak.\n\n\"----since the former Chief Piper has been advanced in degree to a new\noffice,\" continued Gope. A blue bladder moaned, lost amid yells and\ncheers.\n\n\"Let these air-bags be punctured,\" Gope cried. \"I banish their rancid\nsqueals forever from Rath-Gallion. Now, let all know: this former piper\nis now Chief Fool to this household. Let him wear the broken bladders\nas a sign of his office.\" There was a roar of laughter, glad cries,\nwhistles. Volunteers leaped to rip the colored air-bags; they died in\na final flurry of trills and flutters. A fool-slave tied the draggled\ninstrument to the ex-piper's head.\n\nI gave them _Mairzy Doats_ and the former piper capered gingerly. Owner\nGope roared with laughter. I followed with _The Dipsy Doodle_ and the\nnew fool, encouraged by success, leaped and grimaced, pirouetted,\nstrutted, bladders bobbing; the crowd laughed until the tears flowed.\n\n\"A great day for Rath-Gallion,\" Gope shouted. \"By the horns of the\nsea-god, I have gained a prince of pipers and a king of fools! I\nproclaim them to be ten-lash men, and both shall have places at table\nhenceforth!\"\n\nThe Fool and I followed up with three more numbers, then Gope let us\nsqueeze into a space on a hard bench at the far side of the table. A\ntable slave put loaded plates before us.\n\n\"Well done, good Drgon,\" he whispered. \"Do not forget us slaves in your\nnew honor.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" I said, sniffling the aroma of a big slab of roast beef.\n\"I'll be sneaking down for a snack every night about Cinte-rise.\"\n\nI looked around the barbarically decorated hall, seeing things in\na new way. There's nothing like a little slavery to make a man\nappreciate even a modest portion of freedom. Everything I had thought\nI knew about Vallon had been wrong: the centuries that had passed had\nchanged things--and not for the better. The old society that Foster\nknew was dead and buried. The old palaces and villas lay deserted,\nthe spaceports unused. And the old system of memory-recording that\nFoster described was lost and forgotten. I didn't know what kind of a\ncataclysm could have plunged the seat of a galactic empire back into\nfeudal darkness--but it had happened.\n\nSo far I hadn't found a trace of Foster. My questions had gotten me\nnothing but blank stares. Maybe Foster hadn't made it; there could have\nbeen an accident in space. Or perhaps he was somewhere on the opposite\nside of the world. Vallon was a big planet and communications were\npoor. Maybe Foster was dead. I could live out a long life here and\nnever find the answers.\n\nI remembered my own disappointment at the breakdown of my illusions\nthat night at Okk-Hamiloth. How much more heartbreaking must have been\nFoster's experience when and if he had arrived back here. And now we\nwere both in the same boat: with our memories of the old Vallon and the\ndreary spectacle of the new providing plenty of food for bitterness.\n\nAnd Foster's memory that I had been bringing him for a keepsake: what\na laugh that was! Far from being a superfluous duplicate of a master\ntrace to which he had expected easy access, my copy of the trace was\nnow, with the vaults at Okk-Hamiloth sealed and forbidden, of the\ngreatest possible importance to Foster--and there wasn't a machine left\non the planet to play it on.\n\nWell, I still meant to find Foster if it took me----\n\nOwner Gope was humming loudly and tunelessly to himself. I knew the\nsign. I got ready to play again. Being Chief Piper probably wasn't\ngoing to be just one big bowl of cherries, but at least I wasn't a\nslave now. I had a long way to go, but I was making progress.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOwner Gope and I got along well. He was a shrewd old duck and he\nliked having such an unusual piper on hand. He had heard from the\nGreymen, the free-lance police force, how I had landed at the deserted\nport. He warned me, in an oblique way, not to let word get out that\nI knew anything about old times in Vallon. The whole subject was\ntabu--especially the old capital city and the royal palaces themselves.\nSmall wonder that my trespassing there had brought the Greymen down on\nme in doublequick time.\n\nGope took me with him everywhere he went: by air-car, ground-car, or\nformal river barge. There were still a lot of vehicles around, though\nfew people seemed to know how to use them, simple as they were to\noperate. The air-cars were more useful, since they required no roads,\nbut Gope preferred the ground cars. I think he liked the sensation of\nspeed you got barrelling along a ninety or a hundred on one of the\nstill-perfect roads that had originally been intended merely as scenic\ndrives.\n\nOne afternoon several months after my promotion I dropped in at the\nkitchen. I was due to shove off with Owner Gope and his usual retinue\nfor a visit to Bar-Ponderone, a big estate a hundred miles north of\nRath-Gallion in the direction of Okk-Hamiloth. Sime and my other old\ncronies fixed me up with a healthy lunch, and warned me that it would\nbe a rough trip; the stretch of road we'd be using was a favorite\nhang-out of road pirates.\n\n\"What I don't understand,\" I said, \"is why Gope doesn't mount a couple\nof guns on the car and blast his way through the raiders. Every time he\ngoes off the Estate he's taking his life in his hands.\"\n\nThe boys were shocked. \"Even piratical renegades would never dream of\ntaking a man's life, good Drgon,\" Sime said. \"Every Owner, far and\nnear, would band together to hunt such miscreants down. And their own\nfellows would abet the hunters! Nay, none is so low as to steal all a\nman's lives.\"\n\n\"The corsairs themselves know full well that in their next life they\nmay be simple goodmen--even slaves,\" the Chief Wine-Pourer put in. \"For\nyou know, good Drgon, that when a member of a pirate band suffers the\nChange the others lead the newman to an Estate, that he may find his\nplace....\"\n\n\"How often do these Changes come along?\" I asked.\n\n\"It varies greatly. Some men, of great strength and moral power, have\nbeen known to go on unchanged for three or four hundred years. But\nthe ordinary man lives a life of eighty to one hundred years.\" Sime\npaused. \"Or it may be less. A life of travail and strife can age one\nsooner than one of peace and retirement. Or unusual vicissitudes can\nshorten a life remarkably. A cousin of mine, who was marooned on the\nGreat Stony Place in the southern half-world and who wandered for three\nweeks without more to eat or drink than a small bag of wine, underwent\nthe Change after only fourteen years. When he was found his face was\nlined and his hair had greyed, in the way that presages the Change. And\nit was not long before he fell in a fit, as one does, and slept for\na night and a day. When he awoke he was a newman: young and knowing\nnothing.\"\n\n\"Didn't you tell him who he was?\"\n\n\"Nay!\" Sime lowered his voice. \"You are much favored of Owner Gope,\ngood Drgon, and rightly. Still, there are matters a man talks not\nof----\"\n\n\"A newman takes a name and sets out to learn whatever trade he can,\"\nput in the Carver of Roasts. \"By his own skills he can rise ... as you\nhave risen, good Drgon.\"\n\n\"Don't you have memory machines--or briefing rods?\" I persisted.\n\"Little black sticks: you touch them to your head and----\"\n\nSime made a motion in the air. \"I have heard of these wands: a\nforbidden relic of the Black Arts----\"\n\n\"Nuts,\" I said. \"You don't believe in magic, do you, Sime? The rods are\nnothing but a scientific development by your own people. How you've\nmanaged to lose all knowledge of your own past----\"\n\nSime raised his hands in distress. \"Good Drgon, press us not in these\nmatters. Such things are forbidden.\"\n\n\"Okay, boys. I guess I'm just nosy.\"\n\nI went on out to the car and climbed in to wait for Owner Gope. Trying\nto learn anything about Vallon's history was about like questioning a\nvillage of Eskimos about the great trek over from Asia: they didn't\nknow anything.\n\nI had reached a few tentative conclusions on my own, however. My theory\nwas that some sudden social cataclysm had broken down the system\nof personality reinforcement and memory recording that had given\ncontinuity to the culture. Vallonian society, based as it was on the\ntechniques of memory preservation, had gradually disintegrated. Vallon\nwas plunged into a feudal state resembling its ancient social pattern\nof fifty thousand years earlier, prior to the development of memory\nrecording.\n\nThe people, huddled together on Estates for protection from real or\nimagined perils and shunning the old villas and cities as tabu--except\nfor those included in Estates--knew nothing of space travel and ancient\nhistory. Like Sime, they had no wish even to speak of such matters.\n\nI might have better luck with my detective work on a big Estate like\nBar-Ponderone. I was looking forward to today's trip. I was cramped on\nRath-Gallion. It was a small, poor Estate, covering only about twenty\nsquare miles, with half a dozen villages of farmers and craftsmen and\nthe big house of Owner Gope. I had seen all of it--and it was a dead\nend.\n\nGope appeared, with Cagu and two other bodyguards, four dancing girls,\nand an extra-large gift hamper. They took their places and the\ndriver started up and wheeled the heavy car out onto the highroad.\nI felt a pulse of excitement as we accelerated in the direction of\nBar-Ponderone. Maybe at the big Estate I'd get news of Foster.\n\nWe were doing about fifty down a winding mountain road. I was in the\nfront seat beside the driver, fiddling with my clarinet, and watching\nthe road from the corner of my eye. I was wishing the driver's knuckles\ndidn't show white on the speed control lever. He drove like a drunken\nspinster, fast but nervous. It wasn't entirely his fault: Gope insisted\non plenty of speed. I was grateful for the auto steer mechanism; at\nleast we couldn't drive over a cliff.\n\nWe rounded a curve, the wheels screeching from the driver's awkward,\ntoo-fast swing into the turn, and saw another car in the road a quarter\nof a mile ahead, not moving but parked--sideways. The driver hit the\nbrakes.\n\nBehind us Owner Gope yelled \"Pirates! Don't slacken your pace, driver.\"\n\n\"But, but, Owner Gope----\" the driver gasped.\n\n\"Ram the blackguards, if you must!\" Gope shouted. \"But don't stop!\"\n\nThe girls in the back yelped in alarm. The flunkies set up a wail. The\ndriver rolled his eyes, almost lost control, then gritted his teeth,\nreached out to switch off the anti-collision circuit and slam the speed\ncontrol lever against the dash. I watched for two long heartbeats\nas we roared straight for the blockading car, then I slid over and\ngrabbed for the controls. The driver held on, frozen. I reared back\nand clipped him on the jaw. He crumpled into his corner, mouth open\nand eyes screwed shut, as I hit the auto-steer override and worked the\ntiller. It was an awkward position for steering, but I preferred it to\nhammering in at ninety per.\n\nThe car ahead was still sitting tight, now a hundred yards away, now\nfifty. I cut hard to the right, toward the rising cliff face; the car\nbacked to block me. At the last instant I whipped to the left, barreled\npast with half an inch to spare, rocketed along the ragged edge with\nthe left wheel rolling on air, then whipped back into the center of the\nroad.\n\n\"Well done!\" yelled Cagu.\n\n\"But they'll give chase!\" Gope shouted. \"Assassins! Masterless swine!\"\n\nThe driver had his eyes open now. \"Crawl over me!\" I barked. He mumbled\nand clambered past me and I slid into his seat, still clinging to\nthe accelerator lever and putting up the speed. Another curve was\ncoming up. I grabbed a quick look in the rear-viewer: the pirates were\nswinging around to follow us.\n\n\"Press on!\" commanded Gope. \"We're close to Bar-Ponderone; it's no more\nthan five miles----\"\n\n\"What kind of speed have they got?\" I called back.\n\n\"They'll beat us easy,\" said Cagu cheerfully.\n\n\"What's the road like ahead?\"\n\n\"A fair road, straight and true, now that we've descended the\nmountain,\" answered Gope.\n\nWe squealed through the turn and hit a straightaway. A curving road\nbranched off ahead. \"What's that?\" I snapped.\n\n\"A winding trail,\" gasped the driver. \"It comes on Bar-Ponderone, but\nby a longer way.\"\n\nI gauged my speed, braked minutely, and cut hard. We howled up the\nsteep slope, into a turn between hills.\n\nGope shouted, \"What madness is this? Are you in league with the\nvillains...?\"\n\n\"We haven't got a chance on the straightaway,\" I called back. \"Not in a\nstraight speed contest.\" I whipped the tiller over, then back the other\nway, following the tight S-curves. We flashed past magnificent vistas\nof rugged peaks and rolling plains, but I didn't have time to admire\nthe view. There were squeals from the odalisques in the rear seats,\na gabble of excited talk. I caught a glimpse of our pursuers, just\nheading into the side road behind us.\n\n\"Any way they can head us off?\" I yelled.\n\n\"Not unless they have confederates stationed ahead,\" said Gope, \"but\nthese pariahs work alone.\"\n\nI worked the brake and speed levers, handled the tiller. We swung\nright, then left, higher and higher, then down a steep grade and up\nagain. The pirate car rounded a turn, only a few hundred yards behind\nnow. I scanned the road ahead, followed its winding course along the\nmountainside, through a tunnel, then out again to swing around the\nshoulder of the next peak.\n\n\"Pitch something out when we go through the tunnel!\" I yelled.\n\"Anything!\"\n\n\"My cloak,\" cried Gope. \"And the gift hamper.\"\n\nOne of the flunkies started to moan. The girls caught the fever, joined\nin with shrill lamentations.\n\n\"Silence!\" roared Gope. \"Lend a hand here, or by the sea-devil's beard\nyou'll be jettisoned with the rest!\"\n\nWe roared into the tunnel mouth. There was a blast of air as the rear\ndeck cover opened. Gope and Cagu hefted the heavy gift hamper, tumbled\nit out, followed it with a cloak, a wine jug, assorted sandals,\nbracelets, fruit. Then we were back in the sunlight and I was fighting\nthe curve. In the rear-viewer I saw the pirates burst from the tunnel\nmouth, Gope's black and yellow cloak spread over the canopy, smashed\nfruit spattered over it, the remains of the hamper dragging under the\nchassis. The car rocked and a corner of the cloak lifted, clearing the\ndriver's view barely in time.\n\n\"Tough luck,\" I said. \"We've got a long straight stretch ahead, and I'm\nfresh out of ideas....\"\n\nThe other car gained. I held the speed bar against the dash but we were\nup against a faster car; it was a hundred yards behind us, then fifty,\nthen pulling out to go alongside. I slowed imperceptibly, let him get\nhis front wheels past us, then cut sharply. There was a clash of wheel\nfairings, and I fought the tiller as we rebounded from the heavier car.\nHe crept forward, almost alongside again; shoulder to shoulder we raced\nat ninety-five down the steep grade....\n\nI hit the brakes and cut hard to the left, slapped his right rear\nwheel, slid back. He braked too; that was a mistake. The heavy car lost\ntraction, sliding. In slow motion, off-balanced in a skid, it rose on\nits nose, ploughing up a cloud of dust. The hamper whirled away, the\ncloak fluttered and was gone, then the pirate car seemed to float for\nan instant in air, before it dropped, wheels up, out of sight over the\nsheer cliff. We raced alone down the slope and out onto the wooded\nplain toward the towers of Bar-Ponderone.\n\nA shout went up; Owner Gope leaned forward to pound my back. \"By the\nnine eyes of the Hill Devil!\" he bellowed, \"masterfully executed!\nThe prince of Pipers is a prince of Drivers too! This night you'll\nsit by my side at the ring-board at Bar-Ponderone in the rank of a\nhundred-lash Chief Driver, I swear it!\"\n\n\"Compared with making a left turn off the Outer Drive at 5:15 on a\nFriday, that was nothing,\" I said. I held onto the tiller and tried\nbreathing again. I'd been a fool to try to flip a heavier car--but it\nhad worked. And now I'd gotten another promotion. I was doing okay.\n\n\"And let no man raise a charge of Assassination,\" Gope went on. \"I'll\nnot see so clever a Driver-Piper immured. I charge you all: say nothing\nof this! We'll consider that the rascals merely outdid themselves in\ntheir villainy.\"\n\nThat was the first I'd thought of that angle. To take a human life was\nstill the one unthinkable crime in this world of immortals--because you\ntook not just one, but all a man's lives. The punishment was walling\nup for life ... but just one life. In my case one would be enough; I\ndidn't have any spares. I had taken a bigger chance with Gope than I\nhad with the pirates.\n\nLife here was a series of gambles, but it looked like the chance-takers\ngot ahead fast. My best bet was to stay on the make and calculate the\nodds when it was over.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI spent the first day at Bar-Ponderone rubber-necking the tall\nbuildings and keeping an eye open for Foster, on the off chance that I\nmight pass him on the street. It was about as likely as running into an\nold high school chum from Perth Amboy among the body servants of the\nShah of Afghanistan, but I kept looking.\n\nBy sunset I was no wiser than before. Dressed in the latest in\nVallonian cape and ruffles, I was sitting with my buddy Cagu, Chief\nBodyguard to Owner Gope, at a small table on the first terrace at the\nPalace of Merrymaking, Bar-Ponderone's biggest community feasting hall.\nIt looked like a Hollywood producer's idea of a twenty-first century\nnight club, complete with nine dance floors on five levels, indoor\npools, fountains, two thousand tables, musicians, girls, noise, colored\nlights, and food fit for an Owner. It was open to all fifty-lash\ngoodmen of the Estate and to guests of equivalent rank. After the\nback-country life at Rath-Gallion it looked like the big time to me.\n\nCagu was a morose-looking old cuss, but good-hearted. His face was cut\nand scarred from a thousand encounters with other bodyguards and his\nnose had been broken so often that it was invisible in profile.\n\n\"Where do you manage to get in all the fights, Cagu?\" I asked him.\n\"I've known you for three months, and I haven't seen a blow struck in\nanger yet.\"\n\n\"Here.\" He grinned, showing me some broken front teeth. \"Swell places,\nthese big Estates, good Drgon; lotsa action.\"\n\n\"What do you do, get in street fights?\"\n\n\"Nah. The boys show up down here, tank up, cruise around, you know.\"\n\n\"They start fights here in the dining room?\"\n\n\"Sure. Good crowd here; lotsa laughs.\"\n\nI picked up my drink, raised it to Cagu--and got it in my lap as\nsomebody jostled my arm. I looked up. A battle-scarred thug stood over\nme.\n\n\"Who'sa punk, Cagu?\" he said in a hoarse whisper. He probed at a back\ntooth with a silver pick, rolled his eyes from me to my partner.\n\nCagu stood up, and threw a punch to the other plug-ugly's paunch. He\n_oof!_ed, clinched, eyed me resentfully over Cagu's shoulder. Cagu\npushed him away, held him at arm's length.\n\n\"Howsa boy, Mull?\" he said. \"Lay offa my sidekick; greatest little\npiper ina business, and a top driver too.\"\n\nMull rubbed his stomach, sat down beside me. \"Ya losin' your punch,\nCagu.\" He looked at me. \"Sorry about that. I thought you was one of the\nguys.\" He signaled a passing waiter-slave. \"Bring my friend a new suit.\nMake it snappy.\"\n\n\"Don't the customers kind of resent it when you birds stage a\nheavyweight bout in the aisle?\" I asked. \"A drink in the lap is\nroutine. It could happen in any joint in Manhattan. But a seven-course\nmeal would be overdoing it.\"\n\n\"Nah; we move down inta the Spot.\" He waved a thumb in the general\ndirection of somewhere else. He looked me over. \"Where ya been, Piper?\nYour first time ina Palace?\"\n\n\"Drgon's been travelling,\" said Cagu. \"He's okay. Lemme tell ya the\ntime these pirates pull one, see....\"\n\nCagu and Mull swapped lies while I worked on my drinking. Although I\nhadn't learned anything on my day's looking around at Bar-Ponderone,\nit was still a better spot for snooping than Rath-Gallion. There were\ntwo major cities on the Estate and scores of villages. Somewhere among\nthe population I might have better luck finding someone to talk history\nwith ... or someone who knew Foster.\n\n\"Hey!\" growled Mull. \"Look who's comin'.\"\n\nI followed his gaze. Three thick-set thugs swaggered up to the table.\nOne of them, a long-armed gorilla at least seven feet tall, reached\nout, took Cagu and Mull by the backs of their necks, and cracked their\nskulls together. I jumped up, ducked a hoof-like fist ... and saw a\nbeautiful burst of fireworks followed by soothing darkness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI fumbled in the dark with the lengths of cloth entangling my legs, sat\nup, cracked my head----\n\nI groaned, freed a leg from the chair rungs, groped my way out from\nunder the table. A Waiter-slave helped me up, dusted me off. The\nseven-foot lout lolling in a chair glanced my way, nodded.\n\n\"You shouldn't hang out with lugs like that Mull,\" he said. \"Cagu told\nme you was just a piper, but the way you come outa that chair--\" He\nshrugged, turned back to whatever he was watching.\n\nI checked a few elbow and knee joints, worked my jaw, tried my neck:\nall okay.\n\n\"You the one that slugged me?\" I asked.\n\n\"Huh? Yeah.\"\n\nI stepped over to his chair, picked a spot, and cleared my throat.\n\"Hey, you,\" I said. He turned, and I put everything I had behind a\nstraight right to the point of the jaw. He went over, feet in the air,\nflipped a rail, and crashed down between two tables below. I leaned\nover the rail. A party of indignant Tally-clerks stared up at me.\n\n\"Sorry, folks,\" I said. \"He slipped.\"\n\nA shout went up from the floor some distance away. I looked. In a\ncleared circle two levels below a pair of heavy-shouldered men were\nslugging it out. One of them was Cagu. I watched, saw his opponent\nfall. Another man stepped in to take his place. I turned and made my\nway down to the ring-side.\n\nCagu exchanged haymakers with two more opponents before he folded and\nwas hauled from the ring. I propped him up in a chair, fitted a drink\ninto his fist, and watched the boys pound each other. It was easy to\nsee why the scarred face was the sign of their craft; there was no\ndefensive fighting whatever. They stood toe-to-toe and hit as hard as\nthey could, until one collapsed. It wasn't fancy, but the fans loved\nit. Cagu came to after a while and filled me in on the fighters'\nbackgrounds.\n\n\"So they're all top boys,\" he said. \"But it ain't like in the old days\nwhen I was in my prime. I could've took any three of these bums. The\nonly one maybe I woulda had a little trouble with is Torbu.\"\n\n\"Which one is he?\"\n\n\"He ain't down there yet; he'll show to take on the last boys on their\nfeet.\"\n\nMore gladiators pushed their way to the Spot, pulled off\ngaily-patterned cloaks and weskits, and waded in. Others folded, were\ndragged clear, revived to down another and shot cheer on the fray.\n\nAfter an hour the waiting line had dwindled away to nothing. The two\nbattlers on the Spot slugged, clinched, breathed hard, swung and\nmissed; the crowd booed.\n\n\"Where's Torbu?\" Cagu wondered.\n\n\"Maybe he didn't come tonight,\" I said.\n\n\"Sure, you met him; he knocked you under the table.\"\n\n\"Oh, him?\"\n\n\"Where'd he go?\"\n\n\"The last I saw he was asleep on the floor,\" I said.\n\n\"Hozzat?\"\n\n\"I didn't much like him slugging me. I clobbered him one.\"\n\n\"Hey!\" yelped Cagu. His face lit up. He got to his feet.\n\n\"Hold it,\" I said. \"What's--?\"\n\nCagu pushed his way through to the Spot, took aim, and floored the\nclosest fighter, turned and laid out the other. He raised both hands\nabove his head.\n\n\"Rath-Gallion gotta Champion,\" he bellowed. \"Rath-Gallion takes on all\ncomers.\" He turned, waved to me. \"Our boy, Drgon, he--\"\n\nThere was a bellow behind me, even louder than Cagu's. I turned, saw\nTorbu, his hair mussed, his face purple, pushing through the crowd.\n\n\"Jussa crummy minute,\" he yelled. \"I'm the Champion around here--\" He\naimed a haymaker at Cagu; Cagu ducked.\n\n\"Our boy, Drgon, laid you out cold, right?\" he shouted. \"So now he's\nthe champion.\"\n\n\"I wasn't set,\" bawled Torbu. \"A lucky punch.\" He turned to the fans.\n\"I'm tying my shoelace, see? And this guy--\"\n\n\"Come on down, Drgon,\" Cagu called, waving to me again. \"We'll show--\"\nTorbu turned and slammed a roundhouse right to the side of Cagu's jaw;\nthe old fighter hit the floor hard, skidded, lay still. I got to my\nfeet. They pulled him to the nearest table, hoisted him into a chair.\nI made my way down to the little clearing in the crowd. A man bending\nover Cagu straightened, face white. I pushed him aside, grabbed the\nbodyguard's wrist. There was no pulse. Cagu was dead.\n\nTorbu stood in the center of the Spot, mouth open. \"What...?\" he\nstarted. I pushed between two fans, went for him. He saw me, crouched,\nswung.\n\nI ducked, uppercut him. He staggered back. I pressed him, threw lefts\nand rights to the body, ducked under his wild swings, then rocked his\nhead left and right. He stood, knees together, eyes glazed, hands down.\nI measured him, right-crossed his jaw; he dropped like a log.\n\nPanting, I looked across at Cagu. His scarred face, white as wax, was\nstrangely altered now; it looked peaceful. Somebody helped Torbu to his\nfeet, walked him to the ring-side. It had been a big evening. Now all I\nhad to do was take the body home....\n\nI went over to where Cagu was laid out on the floor. Shocked people\nstood staring. Torbu was beside the body. A tear ran down his nose,\ndripped on Cagu's face. Torbu wiped it away with a big scarred hand.\n\n\"I'm sorry, old friend,\" he said. \"I didn't mean it.\"\n\nI picked Cagu up and got him over my shoulder, and all the way to the\nfar exit it was so quiet in the Palace of Merrymaking that I could hear\nmy own heavy breathing and the tinkle of fountains and the squeak of my\nfancy yellow plastic shoes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the bodyguards' quarters I laid Cagu out on a bunk, then faced the\ndozen scowling bruisers who stared down at the still body.\n\n\"Cagu was a good man,\" I said. \"Now he's dead. He died like an\nanimal ... for nothing. That ended all his lives, didn't it, boys?\nHow do you like it?\"\n\nMull glowered at me. \"You talk like we was to blame,\" he said. \"Cagu\nwas my compeer too.\"\n\n\"Whose pal was he a thousand years ago?\" I snapped. \"What was\nhe--once? What were you? Vallon wasn't always like this. There was a\ntime when every man was his own Owner--\"\n\n\"Look, you ain't of the Brotherhood--\" one thug started.\n\n\"So that's what you call it? But it's just another name for an old\nracket. A big shot sets himself up as dictator--\"\n\n\"We got our Code,\" Mull said. \"Our job is to stick up for the Owner ...\nand that don't mean standing around listening to some japester callin'\nnames.\"\n\n\"I'm not calling names,\" I snapped. \"I'm talking rebellion. You boys\nhave all the muscle and most of the guts in this organization. Why\ndo you sit on your tails and let the boss live off the fat while you\nmurder each other for the amusement of the patrons? I say let's pay him\na call--right now. You had a birthright ... once. But it's up to you to\ncollect it ... before some more of you go the way Cagu did.\"\n\nThere was an angry mutter. Torbu came in, face swollen. I backed up to\na table, ready for trouble.\n\n\"Hold it, you birds,\" Torbu said. \"What's goin' on?\"\n\n\"This guy! He's talkin' revolt and treason,\" somebody said.\n\n\"He wants we should pull some rough stuff--on Owner Qohey hisself.\"\n\nTorbu came up to me. \"You're a stranger around Bar-Ponderone. Cagu said\nyou was okay. You worked me over pretty good ... and I got no hard\nfeelin's; that's the breaks. But don't try to start no trouble here. We\ngot our Code and our Brotherhood. We look out for each other; that's\ngood enough for us. Owner Qohey ain't no worse than any other\nOwner ... and by the Code, we'll stand by him!\"\n\n\"Listen to me,\" I said. \"I know the history of Vallon: I know what\nyou were once and what you could be again. All you have to do is take\nover the power. I can lead you to the ship I came here in. There are\nbriefing rods aboard, enough to show you--\"\n\n\"That's enough,\" Torbu broke in. He made a cabalistic sign in the air.\n\"We ain't gettin' mixed up in no tabu ghost-boats or takin' on no\nmagicians and demons--\"\n\n\"Hogwash! That tabu routine is just a gag to keep you away from the\ncities so you won't discover what you're missing--\"\n\n\"I don't wanna hafta take you to the Greymen, Drgon,\" Torbu growled.\n\"Leave it lay.\"\n\n\"These cities,\" I ploughed on. \"They're standing there, empty, as\nperfect as the day they were built. And you live in these flea-bitten\nquarters, jammed inside the town walls, so the Greymen and renegades\nwon't get you.\"\n\n\"You wanna run things here?\" Mull put in. \"Go see Qohey.\"\n\n\"Let's all go see Qohey!\" I said.\n\n\"That's something you'll have to do alone,\" said Torbu. \"You better\nmove on, Drgon. I ain't turnin' you in; I know how you felt about Cagu\ngettin' killed and all--but don't push it too far.\"\n\nI knew I was licked. They were as stubborn as a team of mules--and just\nabout as smart.\n\nTorbu motioned; I followed him outside.\n\n\"You wanna turn things upside-down, don't you? I know how it is; you\nain't the first guy to get ideas. We can't help you. Sure, things ain't\nlike they used to be here--and prob'ly they never were. But we got a\nlegend: someday the Rthr will come back ... and then the Good Time will\ncome back too.\"\n\n\"What's the Rthr?\" I said.\n\n\"Kinda like a big-shot Owner. There ain't no Rthr now. But a long time\nago, back when our first lives started, there was a Rthr that was Owner\nof all Vallon, and everybody lived high, and had all their lives....\"\nTorbu stopped, eyed me warily.\n\n\"Don't say nothing to nobody,\" he went on, \"about what I been tellin'\nyou. That's a secret of the Brotherhood. But it's kind of like a hope\nwe got--that's what we're waitin' for, through all our lives. We got to\ndo the best we can, and keep true to the Code and the Brotherhood ...\nand someday the Rthr will come back ... maybe.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said. \"Dream on, big boy. And while you're treasuring your\nrosy dreams you'll get your brains kicked out, like Cagu.\" I turned\naway.\n\n\"Listen, Drgon. It's no good buckin' the system: it's too big for one\nguy ... or even a bunch of guys ... but--\"\n\nI looked up. \"Yeah?\"\n\n\"... if you gotta stick your neck out--see Owner Gope.\" Abruptly Torbu\nturned and pushed back through the door.\n\nSee Owner Gope, huh? Okay, what did I have to lose? I headed back along\nthe corridor toward Owners' country.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI stood in the middle of the deep-pile carpet in Gope's suite, trying\nto keep my temper hot enough to supply the gall I needed to bust in on\nan Owner in the middle of the night. He sat in his ceremonial chair and\nstared at me impassively.\n\n\"With your help or without it,\" I said, \"I'm going to find the answers.\"\n\n\"Yes, good Drgon,\" he said, not bellowing for once. \"I understand. But\nthere are matters you know not of--\"\n\n\"Just get me back into the spaceport, noble Gope. I have enough\nbriefing rods aboard to prove my point--and a few other little items to\nboot.\"\n\n\"It's forbidden. Do you not understand--\"\n\n\"I understand too much,\" I snapped.\n\nHe straightened, eyed me with a touch of the old ferocity. \"Mind your\ntone, Drgon! I'm Owner--\"\n\nI broke in. \"Do you remember Cagu? Maybe you remember him as a newman,\nyoung, handsome, like a god out of some old legend. You've seen him\nlive his life. Was it a good life? Did the promise of youth ever get\npaid off?\"\n\nGope closed his eyes. \"Stop,\" he said. \"This is bad, bad....\"\n\n\"'And the deaths they died I have watched beside, and the lives they\nled were mine,'\" I quoted. \"Are you proud of them? And what about\nyourself? Don't you ever wonder what you might have been ... back in\nthe Good Time?\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked Gope, his eyes fixed on mine. \"You speak Old\nVallonian, you rake up the forbidden knowledge, and challenge the very\nPowers....\" He got to his feet. \"I could have you immured, Drgon. I\ncould hand you to the Greymen, for a fate I shudder to name.\" He turned\nand walked the length of the room restlessly, then turned back to me\nand stopped.\n\n\"Matters stand ill with this fair world,\" he said. \"Legend tells us\nthat once men lived as the High Gods on Vallon. There was a mighty\nOwner, Rthr of all Vallon. It is whispered that he will come again--\"\n\n\"Your legends are all true. You can take my word for that! But that\ndoesn't mean some supernatural sugar daddy is going to come along and\nbail you out. And don't get the idea I think I'm the fabled answer to\nprayers. All I mean is that once upon a time Vallon was a good place\nto live and it could be again. Right now, it's like a land under an\nenchantment--and you sleeping beauties need waking up. Your cities and\nroads and ships are still here, intact. But nobody knows how to run\nthem and you're all afraid to try. Who scared you off? Who started the\nrumors? What broke down the memory recording system? Why can't we all\ngo to Okk-Hamiloth and use the Archives to give everybody back what\nhe's lost--\"\n\n\"These are dread words,\" said Gope.\n\n\"There must be somebody behind it. Or there was once. Who is he?\"\n\nGope thought. \"There is one man pre-eminent among us: the Great Owner,\nOwner of Owners: Ommodurad by name. Where he dwells I know not. This is\na secret possessed only by his intimates.\"\n\n\"What does he look like? How do I get to see him?\"\n\nGope shook his head. \"I have seen him but once, closely cowled. He is\na tall man, and silent. 'Tis said--\" Gope lowered his voice, \"--by his\nblack arts he possesses all his lives. An aura of dread hangs about\nhim--\"\n\n\"Never mind that jazz,\" I said. \"He's a man, like other men. Stick a\nknife between his ribs and you put an end to him, aura and all.\"\n\n\"I do not like this talk of death. Let the doer of evil deeds be\nimmured; it is sufficient.\"\n\n\"First let's find him. How can I get close to him?\"\n\n\"There are those Owners who are his confidants,\" said Gope, \"his\ntrusted agents. It is through them that we small Owners learn of his\nwill.\"\n\n\"Can we enlist one of them?\"\n\n\"Never. They are bound to him by ties of darkness, spells and\nincantations.\"\n\n\"I'm a fast man with a pair of loaded dice myself. It's all done with\nmirrors. Let's stick to the point, noble Gope. How can I work into a\nspot with one of these big shots?\"\n\n\"Nothing easier. A Driver and Piper of such skills as your own can\nclaim what place he chooses.\"\n\n\"How about bodyguarding? Suppose I could take a heavy named Torbu;\nwould that set me in better with a new Owner?\"\n\n\"Such is no place for a man of your abilities, good Drgon,\" Gope\nexclaimed. \"True, 'tis a place most close to an Owner, but there is\nmuch danger in it. The challenge to a bodyguard involves the most\nbloody hand-to-hand combat, second only to the rigors of a challenge to\nan Owner himself.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" I snapped. \"Challenge an Owner?\"\n\n\"Be calm, good Drgon,\" said Gope, staring at me incredulously. \"No\ncommon man with his wits about him will challenge an Owner.\"\n\n\"But I could if I wanted to?\"\n\n\"In sooth ... if you have tired of life--of all your lives; 'tis as\ngood a way to end them as another. But you must know, good Drgon: an\nOwner is a warrior trained in the skills of battle. None less than\nanother such may hope to prevail.\"\n\nI smacked my fist into my palm. \"I should have thought of this sooner!\nThe cooks cook for their places, the pipers pipe ... and the best man\nwins. It figures that the Owners would use the same system. But what's\nthe procedure, noble Gope? How do you get your chance to prove who can\nown the best?\"\n\n\"It is a contest with naked steel. It is the measure and glory of an\nOwner that he alone stands ready to prove his quality against the peril\nof death itself.\" Gope drew himself up with pride.\n\n\"What about the bodyguards?\" I asked. \"They fight--\"\n\n\"With their hands, good Drgon. And they lack skill with those. A death\nsuch as you described tonight--that is a rare and sorry accident.\"\n\n\"It showed up this whole grubby farce in its true colors. A\ncivilization like that of Vallon--reduced to this.\"\n\n\"Still, it is sweet to live--by whatever rules----\"\n\n\"I don't believe that ... and neither do you. What Owner can I\nchallenge? How do I go about it?\"\n\n\"Give up this course, good Drgon--\"\n\n\"Where's the nearest buddy of the Big Owner?\"\n\nGope threw up his hands. \"Here, at Bar-Ponderone. Owner Qohey. But--\"\n\n\"And how do I call his bluff?\"\n\nGope put a hand on my shoulder. \"It is no bluff, good Drgon. It is long\nnow since last Owner Qohey stood to his blade to protect his place, but\nyou may be sure he has lost none of his skill. Thus it was he won his\nway to Bar-Ponderone, while lesser knights, such as myself, contented\nthemselves with meaner fiefs.\"\n\n\"I'm not bluffing either, noble Gope,\" I said, stretching a point. \"I\nwas no harness-maker in the Good Time.\"\n\n\"It is your death--\"\n\n\"Tell me how I offer the challenge ... or I'll twist his nose in the\nmain banqueting salon tomorrow night.\"\n\nGope sat down heavily, raised his hand, and let them fall. \"If I tell\nyou not, another will. But I will not soon find another Piper of your\nworth.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nGaudy hangings of purple cut the light of the sun to a rich gloom in\nthe enormous, high-vaulted Audience Hall. A rustling murmur was audible\nin the room as uneasy courtiers and supplicants fidgeted, waiting for\nthe appearance of the Owner.\n\nIt had been two months since Gope had explained to me how a formal\nchallenge to an Owner was conducted, and, as he pointed out, this was\nthe only kind of challenge that would help. If I waylaid the man and\ncut him down, even in a fair fight, his bodyguards would repay the\nfavor before I could establish the claim that I was their legitimate\nnew boss.\n\nI had spent three hours every day in the armory at Rath-Gallion,\ntrading buffets with Gope and a couple of the bodyguards. The\nthirty-pound slab of edged steel had felt right at home in my hand that\nfirst day--for about a minute. I had the borrowed knowledge to give\nme all the technique I needed, but the muscle power for putting the\nknowledge into practice was another matter. After five minutes I was\nslumped against the wall, gulping air, while Gope whistled his sticker\naround my head and talked.\n\n\"You laid on like no piper, good Drgon. Yet have you much to learn in\nthe matter of endurance.\"\n\n--And he was at me again. I spent the afternoon back-pedaling and\nmaking wild two-handed swings and finally fell down--pooped. I couldn't\nhave moved if Gope had had at me with a hot poker.\n\nGope and the others laughed til they cried, then hauled me away to my\nroom and let me sleep. They rolled me out the next morning to go at it\nagain.\n\nAs Gope said, there was no time to waste ... and after two months of it\nI felt ready for anything. Gope had warned me that Owner Qohey was a\nbig fellow, but that didn't bother me. The bigger they came, the bigger\nthe target....\n\nThere was a murmur in a different key in the Audience Hall and tall\ngilt doors opened at the far side of the room. A couple of liveried\nflunkies scampered into view, then a seven-foot man-eater stalked into\nthe hall, made his way to the dias, turned to face the crowd....\n\nHe was enormous: his neck was as thick as my thigh, his features\nchipped out of granite, the grey variety. He threw back his brilliant\npurple cloak from his shoulders and reached out an arm like an oak\nroot for the ceremonial sword one of the flunkies was struggling with.\nHe took the sword with its sheath, sat down, and stood it between his\nfeet, his arms folded on top.\n\n\"Who has a grievance?\" he spoke. The voice reverberated like the old\nWurlitzer at the Rialto back home.\n\nThis was my cue. There he was, just asking for it. All I had to do was\nspeak up. Owner Qohey would gladly oblige me. The fact that next to him\nPrimo Carnera would look dainty shouldn't slow me down.\n\nI cleared my throat with a thin squeak, and edged forward, not very far.\n\n\"I have one little item--\" I started.\n\nNobody was listening. Up front a big fellow in a black toga was pushing\nthrough the crowd. Everybody turned to stare at him: there was a\ncraning of necks. The crowd drew back from the dias leaving an opening.\nThe man in black stepped into the clear, flung back the flapping\ngarment from his right arm, and whipped out a long polished length of\nrazor-edged iron. It was beginning to look like somebody had beaten me\nto the punch.\n\nThe newcomer stood there in front of Qohey with the naked blade making\nall the threat that was needed. Qohey stared at him for a long moment,\nthen stood, gestured to a flunky. The flunky turned, cleared his throat.\n\n\"The place of Bar-Ponderone has been claimed!\" he recited in a shrill\nvoice. \"Let the issue be joined!\" He skittered out of the way and Qohey\nrose, threw aside his purple cloak and cowl, and stepped down. I pushed\nforward to get a better look.\n\nThe challenger in black tossed his loose garment aside, stood facing\nQohey in a skin-tight jerkin and hose; heavy moccasins of soft leather\nwere laced up the calf. He was magnificently muscled but Qohey towered\nover him like a tree, with a build that would have taken the Mr. Muscle\nBeach title any time he cared to try for it.\n\nI didn't know whether to be glad or sad that the initiative had been\ntaken out from under me. If the man in black won, I wondered would I\nthen be able to step in in turn and take him on? He was a lot smaller\nthan Qohey but there was always the chance....\n\nQohey unsheathed his fancy iron and whirled it like it was a lady's\nputter. I felt sorry for the smaller man, who was just standing,\nwatching him. He really didn't have a chance.\n\nI had got through to the fore rank by now. The challenger turned and I\nsaw his face. I stopped dead, while fire bells clanged in my head.\n\nThe man in black was Foster.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn dead silence Qohey and Foster squared off, touched their sword\npoints to the floor in some kind of salute ... and Qohey's slicer\nwhipped up in a vicious cut. Foster leaned aside, just far enough, then\ncountered with a flick that made Qohey jump back. I let out a long\nbreath and tried swallowing. Foster was like a terrier up against a\nbull, but it didn't seem to bother him--only me. I had come light years\nto find him, just in time to see him get his head lopped off.\n\nQohey's blade flashed, cutting at Foster's head. Foster hardly moved.\nAlmost effortlessly, it seemed, he interposed his heavy weapon between\nthe attacking steel and himself. _Clash, clang!_ Qohey hacked and\nchopped ... and Foster played with him. Then Foster's arm flashed out\nand there was blood on Qohey's wrist. A gasp went up from the crowd.\nNow Foster took a step forward, struck ... and faltered! In an instant\nQohey was on him and the two men were locked, chest to chest. For a\nmoment Foster held, then Qohey's weight told, and Foster reeled back.\nHe tried to bring up the sword, seemed to struggle, then Qohey lashed\nout again. Foster twisted, took the blow awkwardly just above the hand\nguard, stumbled ... and fell.\n\nQohey leaped to him, raised the sword--\n\nI hauled mine half way out of its sheath and pushed forward.\n\n\"Let the man be put away from my sight,\" rumbled Qohey. He lowered his\nimmense sword, turned, pushed aside a flunky who had bustled up with\na wad of bandages. As he strode from the room a swarm of bodyguards\nfanned out between the crowd and Foster. I could see him clumsily\nstruggling to rise, then I was shoved back, still craning for a\nglimpse. There was something wrong here; Foster had acted like a man\nsuddenly half-paralyzed. Had Qohey doped him in some way?\n\nThe cordon stopped pushing, turned their backs to the crowd. I tugged\nat the arm of the man beside me.\n\n\"Did you see anything strange there?\" I started.\n\nHe pulled free. \"Strange? Yea, the mercy of our Lord Qohey! Instead of\nmeting out death on the spot, our Owner was generous--\"\n\n\"I mean about the fight.\" I grabbed his arm again to keep him from\nmoving off.\n\n\"That the impudent rascal would dare to claim the place of Owner at\nBar-Ponderone: there's wonder enough for any man,\" he snapped. \"Unhand\nme, fellow!\"\n\nI unhanded him and tried to collect my wits. What now? I tapped a\nbodyguard on the shoulder. He whirled, club in hand.\n\n\"What's to be the fate of the man?\" I asked.\n\n\"Like the Boss said: they're gonna immure the bum for his pains.\"\n\n\"You mean wall him up?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Just a peep hole to pass chow in every day ... so's he don't\nstarve, see?\" The bodyguard chuckled.\n\n\"How long--?\"\n\n\"He'll last; don't worry. After the Change, Owner Qohey's got a\nnewman--\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" another bruiser said.\n\nThe crowd was slowly thinning. The bodyguards were relaxing, standing\nin pairs, talking. Two servants moved about where the fight had taken\nplace, making mystical motions in the air above the floor. I edged\nforward, watching them. They seemed to be plucking imaginary flowers.\nStrange....\n\nI moved even farther forward to take a closer look, then saw a tiny\nglint.... A servant hurried across, made gestures. I pushed him aside,\ngroped ... and my fingers encountered a delicate filament of wire.\nI pulled it in, swept up more. The servants had stopped and stood\nwatching me, muttering. The whole area of the combat was covered with\nthe invisible wires, looping up in coils two feet high.\n\nNo wonder Foster had stumbled, had trouble raising his sword. He had\nbeen netted, encased in a mesh of incredibly fine tough wire ... and\nin the dim light even the crowd twenty feet away hadn't seen it. Owner\nQohey was a good man with the chopper but he didn't rely on that alone\nto hold onto his job.\n\nI put my hand on my sword hilt, chewed my lower lip. I had found\nFoster ... but it wouldn't do me--or Vallon--much good. He was on\nhis way to the dungeons, to be walled up until the next Change. And\nit would be three months before I could legally make another try for\nQohey's place. After seeing him in action I was glad I hadn't tried\ntoday. He wouldn't have needed any net to handle me.\n\nI would have to spend the next three months working on my swordplay,\nand hope Foster could hold out. Maybe I could sneak a message--\n\nA heavy blow on the back sent me spinning. Four bodyguards moved to\nring me in, clubs in hand. They were strangers to me, but across the\nroom I saw Torbu looming, looking my way....\n\n\"I saw him; he started to pull that fancy sword,\" said one of the\nguards.\n\n\"He was asking me questions--\"\n\n\"Unbuckle it and drop it,\" another ordered me. \"Don't try anything!\"\n\n\"What's this all about?\" I said. \"I have a right to wear a Ceremonial\nSword at an Audience--\"\n\n\"Move in, boys!\" The four men stepped toward me, the clubs came up.\nI warded off a smashing blow with my left arm, took a blinding crack\nacross the face, felt myself going down--another blow, and another:\nkilling ones....\n\nThen I was aware of being dragged, endlessly, of voices barking sharp\nquestions, of pain.... After a long time it was dark, and silent, and I\nslept.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI groaned and the sound was dead, muffled. I put out a hand and touched\nstone on my right. My left elbow touched stone. I made an instinctive\nmove to sit up and smacked my head against more stone. My new room was\nconfining. Gingerly I felt my face ... and winced at the touch. The\nbridge of my nose felt different: it was lower than it used to be,\nin spite of the swelling. I lay back and traced the pattern of pain.\nThere was the nose--smashed flat--with secondary aches around the eyes.\nThey'd be beautiful shiners, if I could see them. Now the left arm: it\nwas curled close to my side and when I moved it I saw why: it wasn't\nbroken, but the shoulder wasn't right, and there was a deep bruise\nabove the elbow. My knees and shin, as far as I could reach, were caked\nwith dried blood. That figured: I remembered being dragged.\n\nI tried deep-breathing; my chest seemed to be okay. My hands worked. My\nteeth were in place. Maybe I wasn't as sick as I felt.\n\nBut where the hell was I? The floor was hard, cold. I needed a big soft\nbed and a little soft nurse and a hot meal and a cold drink....\n\nFoster! I cracked my head again and flopped back, groaned some more. It\nstill sounded pretty dead.\n\nI swallowed, licked my lips, felt a nice split that ran well into the\nbristles. I had attended the Audience clean-shaven. Quite a few hours\nmust have passed since then. They had taken Foster away to immure him,\nsomebody said. Then the guards had tapped me, worked me over....\n\nImmured! I got a third crack on the head. Suddenly it was hard to\nbreathe. I was walled up, sealed away from the light, buried under the\nfoundations of the giant towers of Bar-Ponderone. I felt their crushing\nweight....\n\nI forced myself to relax, breathe deep. Being immured wasn't the\nsame as being buried alive--not exactly. This was the method these\nlatter-day Vallonians had figured out to end a man's life\neffectively ... without ending all his lives. They figured to keep\nme neatly packaged here until my next Change, thus acquiring another\nhealthy newman for the kitchen or the stables. They didn't know the\nonly Change that would happen to me was death.\n\nThey'd have to feed me; that meant a hole. I ran my fingers along the\nrough stone, found an eight-inch square opening on the left wall, just\nunder the ceiling. I reached through it, felt nothing but the solidness\nof its thick sides. How thick the wall was I had no way of determining.\n\nI was feeling dizzy. I lay back and tried to think....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was awake again. There had been a sound. I moved, and felt something\nhit my chest.\n\nI groped for it; it was a small loaf of hard bread. I heard the sound\nagain and a second object thumped against me.\n\n\"Hey!\" I yelled, \"listen to me! I'll die in here. I'm not like the rest\nof you; I won't go through a Change. I'll rot here till I die...!\"\n\nI listened. The silence was absolute.\n\n\"Answer me!\" I screamed. \"You're making a mistake...!\"\n\nI gave up when my throat got raw. The people who dropped the bread\nthrough the little holes to the prisoners had heard a lot of yelling\nin their time. They didn't listen any more. I felt for the other item\nthat had been pushed in to me. It was a water bottle made of tough\nplastic. I fumbled the cap off, took a swallow. It wasn't good. I tried\nthe bread; it was tough, tasteless. I lay and chewed, and wondered what\nI was supposed to do about toilet facilities; it was an interesting\nproblem. I could see it was going to be a great life, while it lasted.\nI laughed: a weak snort of despair.\n\nAs a world-saver I was a bust. I hadn't even been able to get around\nto bailing out my pal Foster after Qohey had booby-trapped him. I\nwondered where he was now. Sealed up in the next cubby-hole probably.\nBut he hadn't answered my yells.\n\nYeah, mine had been a great idea, but it hadn't worked out. I had come\na long, long way and now I was going to die in this reeking hole. I had\na sudden vision of steaks uneaten, and life unlived. I would have been\ngood for another few decades anyway--\n\nAnd then I had another thought: if I never had them was it going to be\nbecause I hadn't tried? Abruptly I was planning. I would keep calm and\nuse my head. I wouldn't wear myself out with screams and struggles. I'd\nfigure the angles, use everything I had to make the best try I could.\n\nFirst, to explore the tomb-like cell. It hurt to move, but that\ndidn't matter. I felt over the walls, estimating size. My chamber was\nthree feet wide, two feet high, and seven feet long. The walls were\nrelatively smooth, except for a few mortar joints. The stones were big:\neighteen inches or so by a couple of feet. I scratched at the mortar;\nit was rock hard.\n\nI wondered how they'd gotten me in. Some of the stones must be newly\nplaced ... or else there was a door. I couldn't feel anything as far as\nmy hands would reach. Maybe at the other end....\n\nI tried to twist around: no go. The people who had built the cage knew\njust how to dimension it to keep the occupant oriented the way they\nwanted him. He was supposed to just lie quietly and wait for the bread\nand water to fall through the hole above his chest.\n\nThat was reason enough to change positions. If they wanted me to stay\nput I'd at least have the pleasure of defying the rules. And there\njust might be a reason why they didn't want me moving around.\n\nI turned on my side, pulled my legs up, hugged them to my chest, worked\nmy way down ... and jammed. My skinned knees and shins didn't help any.\nI inched them higher, wincing at the pain, then braced my hands against\nthe floor and roof and forced my torso toward my feet....\n\nStill no go. The rough stone was shredding my back. I moved my knees\napart; that eased the pressure a little. I made another inch.\n\nI rested, tried to get some air. It wasn't easy: my chest was crushed\nbetween my thighs and the stone wall at my back. I breathed shallowly,\nwondering whether I should go back or try to push on. I tried to move\nmy legs; they didn't like the idea. I might as well go on. It would\nbe no fun either way and if I waited I'd stiffen up, while inactivity\nand no food and loss of blood would weaken me further every moment. I\nwouldn't do better next time--not even as well. This was the time. Now.\n\nI set myself, pushed again. I didn't move. I pushed harder, scraping my\npalms raw against the stone. I was stuck--good. I went limp suddenly.\nThen I panicked, in the grip of claustrophobia. I snarled, rammed\nmy hands hard against the floor and wall, and heaved--and felt my\nlacerated back slip along the stone, sliding on a lubricating film of\nblood. I pushed again, my back curved, doubled; my knees were forced\nup beside my ears. I couldn't breathe at all now and my spine was\nbreaking. It didn't matter. I might as well break it, rip off all the\nhide, bleed to death; I had nothing to lose. I shoved again, felt the\nback of my head grate; my neck bent, creaking ... then I was through,\nstretching out to flop on my back, gasping, my head where my feet had\nbeen. Score one for our side.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt took a long time to get my breath back and sort out my various\nabrasions. My back was worst then my legs and hands. There was a messy\nspot on the back of my head and sharp pains shot down my spine, and I\nwas getting tired of breathing through my mouth instead of my smashed\nnose. Other than that I'd never felt better in my life. I had plenty of\nroom to relax in, I could breathe. All I had to do was rest, and after\na while they'd drop some more nice bread and water in to me....\n\nI shook myself awake. There was something about the absolute darkness\nand silence that made my mind want to curl up and sleep, but there was\nno time for that. If there had been a stone freshly set in mortar to\nseal the chamber after I had been stuffed inside, this was the time to\nfind it--before it set too hard. I ran my hands over the wall, found\nthe joints. The mortar was dry and hard in the first; in the next ...\nunder my fingernail soft mortar crumbled away. I traced the joint;\nit ran around a twelve-by-eighteen-inch stone. I raised myself on my\nelbows, settled down to scratching at it.\n\nHalf an hour later I had ten bloody tips and a half-inch groove dug\nout around the stone. It was slow work and I couldn't go much farther\nwithout a tool of some sort. I felt for the water bottle, took off the\ncap, tried to crush it. It wouldn't crush. There was nothing else in\nthe cell.\n\nMaybe the stone would move, mortar and all, if I shoved hard enough.\nI set my feet against the end wall, my hands against the block, and\nstrained until the blood roared in my ears. No use. It was planted as\nsolid as a mother-in-law in the spare bedroom.\n\nI was lying there, just thinking about it, when I became aware\nof something. It wasn't a noise, exactly. It was more like a\nfourth-dimensional sound heard inside the brain ... or the memory of\none.\n\nBut my next sensation was perfectly real. I felt four little feet\nwalking gravely up my belly toward my chin.\n\nIt was my cat, Itzenca.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nFor a while I toyed with the idea of just chalking it up as a miracle.\nThen I decided it would be a nice problem in probabilities. It had\nbeen seven months since we had parted company on the pink terrace at\nOkk-Hamiloth. Where would I have gone if I had been a cat? And how\ncould I have found me--my old pal from earth?\n\nItzenca exhaled a snuffle in my ear.\n\n\"Come to think of it, the stink is pretty strong, isn't it? I guess\nthere's nobody on Vallon with quite the same heady fragrance. And what\nwith the close quarters here, the concentration of sweat, blood, and\nyou-name-it must be pretty penetrating.\"\n\nItz didn't seem to care. She marched around my head and back again, now\nand then laid a tentative paw on my nose or chin, and kept up a steady\nrumbling purr. The feeling of affection I had for that cat right then\nwas close to being one of my life's grand passions. My hands roamed\nover her scrawny frame, fingered again the khaffite collar I had whiled\naway an hour in fashioning for her aboard the lifeboat--\n\nMy head hit the stone wall with a crack I didn't even notice. In\nten seconds I had released the collar clasp, pulled the collar from\nItzenca's neck, thumbed the stiff khaffite out into a blade about ten\ninches long, and was scraping at the mortar beyond my head at fever\nheat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey had fed me three times by the time the groove was nine inches\ndeep on all sides of the block; and the mortar had hardened. But I was\nnearly through, I figured. I took a rest, then made another try at\nloosening the block. I thrust the blade into the slot, levered gently\nat the stone. If it was only supported on one edge now, as it would be\nif it were a little less than a foot thick, it should be about ready to\ngo. I couldn't tell.\n\nI put down my scraper, got into position, and pushed. I wasn't as\nstrong as I had been; there wasn't much force in the push. Again I\nrested and again I tried. Maybe there was only a thin crust of mortar\nstill holding; maybe one more ounce of pressure would do it. I took a\ndeep breath, strained ... and felt the block shift minutely.\n\nNow! I heaved again, teeth gritted, drew back my feet, and thrust hard.\nThe stone slid out with a grating sound, dropped half an inch. I paused\nto listen: all quiet. I shoved again, and the stone dropped with a\nheavy thud to the floor outside. With no loss of time I pushed through\nbehind it, felt a breath of cooler air, got my shoulders free, pulled\nmy legs through ... and stood, for the first time in how many days....\n\nI had already figured my next move. As soon as Itzenca had stepped\nout I reached back in, groped for the water bottle, the dry crusts I\nhad been saving, and the wad of bread paste I had made up. I reached\na second time for a handful of the powdered mortar I had produced,\nthen lifted the stone. I settled it in place, using the hard bread\nas supports, then packed the open joint with gummy bread. I dusted it\nover with dry mortar, then carefully swept up the debris--as well as I\ncould in the total darkness. The bread-and-water man would have a light\nand he was due in half an hour or so--as closely as I had been able\nto estimate the time of his regular round. I didn't want him to see\nanything out of the ordinary. I was counting on finding Foster filed\naway somewhere in the stacks, and I'd need time to try to release him.\n\nI moved along the corridor, counting my steps, one hand full of\nbreadcrumbs and stone dust, the other feeling the wall. There were\nnarrow side branches every few feet: the access ways to the feeding\nholes. Forty-one paces from my slot I came to a wooden door. It wasn't\nlocked, but I didn't open it. I wasn't ready to use it yet.\n\nI went back, passed my hole, continued nine paces to a blank wall. Then\nI tried the side branches. They were all seven-foot stubs, dead ends;\neach had the eight-inch holes on either side. I called Foster's name\nsoftly at each hole ... but there was no answer. I heard no signs of\nlife, no yells or heavy breathing. Was I the only one here? That wasn't\nwhat I had figured on. Foster had to be in one of these delightful\nbedrooms. I had come across the universe to see him and I wasn't going\nto leave Bar-Ponderone without him.\n\nIt was time to get ready for the bread man. I had a choice of trying\nto get back into my hole and replacing the block, or of hiding in one\nof the side branches. I thought it over for a couple of microseconds\nand decided against getting back in my tomb. If there were as many\nvacancies here as I guessed, I'd be safe in any one of the side\npassages but my own.\n\nI groped my way into a convenient hidey-hole, Itzenca at my heels.\nWith half a year's experience at dodging humans behind her, she could\nbe trusted not to show at the crucial moment, I figured. I had just\njettisoned my handful of trash in the backmost corner of the passage\nwhen there was a soft grating sound from the door. I flattened myself\nagainst the wall. I'd know in a second or two how observant the keeper\nwas.\n\nA light splashed on the floor; it must have been dim but seemed to my\neyes like the blaze of noon. Soft footsteps sounded. I held my breath.\nA man in bodyguard's trappings, basket in hand, moved past the entry\nof the branch where I stood, went on. I breathed again. Now all I had\nto do was keep an eye on the feeder, watch where he stopped. I stepped\nto the corridor, risked a glance, saw him entering a branch far down\nthe corridor. As he disappeared I made it three branches farther along,\nducked out of sight.\n\nI heard him coming back. I flattened myself. He went by me, opened the\ndoor. It closed behind him and the darkness and silence settled down\nonce more. I stood where I was, feeling like a guy who's just showed up\nfor a party ... on the wrong day.\n\nThe bread man had stopped at one cell only--mine. Foster wasn't here.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a long wait for the next feeding but I put the time to use.\nFirst I had a good nap; I hadn't been getting my rest while I scratched\nmy way out of my nest. I woke up feeling better and started thinking\nabout the next move. The bodyguard who brought the food was the first\nitem: I had had to get a set of clothes somewhere and he'd be the\neasiest source to tap. If my mental clock was right it was about time--\n\nThe door creaked, and I did a fast fade down a side branch. The guard\nshuffled into view; now was the time. I moved out--quietly, I thought,\nand he whirled, dropped the load and bottle, and fumbled at his club\nhilt. I didn't have a club to slow me down. I went at him, threw a\nbeautiful right, square to the mouth. He went over backwards, with me\non top. I heard his head hit with a sound like a length of rubber hose\nslapping a grapefruit. He didn't move.\n\nI pulled the clothes off him, struggled into them. They didn't fit too\nwell and they probably smelled gamey to anybody who hadn't spent a week\nwhere I had, but details like those didn't count anymore. I tore his\nsash into strips and tied him. He wasn't dead--quite, but I had reason\nto know that any yelling he did was unlikely to attract much attention.\nI hoped he'd enjoy the rest and quiet until the next feeding time. By\nthen I expected to be long gone. I lifted the door open and stepped out\ninto a dimly-lit corridor.\n\nWith Itzenca abreast of me I moved along in absolute stillness, passed\na side corridor, came to a heavy door: locked. We retraced our steps,\nwent down the side hall, found a flight of worn steps, followed them up\ntwo flights, and emerged in a dark room. A line of light showed around\na door. I went to it, peered through the crack. Two men in stained\nkitchen-slave tunics fussed over a boiling cauldron. I pushed through\nthe door.\n\nThe two looked up, startled. I rounded a littered table, grabbed up a\nheavy soup ladle, and skulled the nearest cook just as he opened up to\nyell. The other one, a big fellow, went for a cleaver. I caught him in\ntwo jumps, laid him out cold beside his pal.\n\nI found an apron, ripped it up, and tied and gagged the two slaves,\nthen hauled them into a storeroom. I was stacking Vallonians away like\na squirrel storing nuts.\n\nI came back into the kitchen. It was silent now. The room reeked of\nsour soup. A stack of unpleasantly familiar loaves stood by the oven.\nI gave them a kick that collapsed the pile as I passed to pick up a\nknife. I hacked tough slices from a cold haunch of Vallonian mutton,\nthrew one to Itzenca across the table, and sat and gnawed the meat\nwhile I tried to think through my plans.\n\nOwner Qohey was a big man to tackle but he was the one with the\nanswers. If I could make my way to his apartment and if I wasn't\nstopped before I'd forced the truth out of him, then I might get to\nFoster and tell him that if he had the memory playback machine I had\nthe memory, if it hadn't been filched from the bottom of a knapsack\naboard a lifeboat parked at Okk-Hamiloth.\n\nFour 'if's' and a 'might'--but it was something to shoot at. My first\nmove would be to locate Qohey's quarters, somewhere here in the Palace,\nand get inside. My bodyguard's outfit was as good a disguise as any for\nthe attempt.\n\nI finished off my share of the meat and got to my feet. I'd have to\nfind a place to clean myself up, shave--\n\nThe rear door banged open and two bodyguards came through it, talking\nloudly, laughing.\n\n\"Hey, cook! Set out meat for--\"\n\nThe heavy in the lead stopped short, gaping at me. I gaped back. It was\nTorbu.\n\n\"Drgon! How did you...?\" He trailed off.\n\nThe other bodyguard came past him, looked me over. \"You're no Brother\nof the Guard--\" he started.\n\nI reached for the cleaver the kitchen-slave had left on the table,\nbacked against a tall wall cupboard. The bodyguard unlimbered his club.\n\n\"Hold it, Blon,\" said Torbu. \"Drgon's okay.\" He looked at me. \"I kind\nof figured you for done for, Drgon. The boys worked you over pretty\ngood.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I returned, \"and thanks for your help in stopping it.\"\n\n\"This is the miscreant we immured!\" Blon burst out. \"Take him!\"\n\nTorbu shifted. \"Hold it a minute,\" he said. He looked uncomfortable.\n\n\"Listen, you two!\" I said. \"You claim to believe in the system around\nhere. You think it's a great life, all fair play and no holds barred\nand plenty of goodies for the winner. I know, it was tough about Cagu,\nbut that's life, isn't it? But what about the business I saw in that\nAudience Hall? You guys try not to think about that angle, is that it?\"\n\n\"The noble Owner's gotta right--\" Blon started.\n\n\"I didn't like the caper with the wires, Blon,\" said Torbu. \"You didn't\neither; neither did most of the boys--\"\n\n\"And I don't remember getting much of a show myself,\" I said. \"There\nare a couple of your buddies I plan to look up when I have some free\ntime--\"\n\n\"I didn't lay a hand on you, Drgon,\" said Torbu. \"I didn't want no part\nof that.\"\n\n\"It was the Owner's orders,\" said Blon. \"What was I gonna go, tell\nhim----\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" I said. \"I'll tell him myself. That's all I want: just a\nshort interview with the Owner--minus the wire nets.\"\n\n\"Wow ...\" drawled Torbu, \"yeah, that'd be a bout.\" He turned to Blon.\n\"This guy's got a punch, Blon. He don't look so hot but he could swap\nbuffets with the Fire Drgon he's named after. If he's that good with a\nlong blade--\"\n\n\"Just lend me one,\" I said, \"and show me the way to his apartment.\"\n\n\"The noble Owner'll cut this clown to ribbons in two minutes flat,\"\nsaid Blon.\n\n\"Let's get the boys.\"\n\n\"How could we explain it afterwards to the noble Owner?\" said Blon. \"He\nain't gonna think much of guys he thought was immured nice and safe\nturnin' up in his bedchamber ... armed.\"\n\n\"We're Brothers of the Guard,\" said Torbu. \"We ain't got much but we\ngot our Code. It don't say nothing about wires. If we don't back up our\noath to the Brotherhood we ain't no better than slaves.\" He turned to\nme. \"Come on, Drgon. We'll take you to the Guardroom so you can clean\nup and put on a good blade. If you're gonna lose all your lives at\nonce, you wanna do it right.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTorbu watched as the boys belted and strapped me into a guardsman's\nfighting outfit. I had made him uneasy, maybe even started him\nthinking. If I could last--just those 'two minutes flat'--before Owner\nQohey killed me, then he'd collect his bet, I'd be out of his hair,\nand he could go back to being Torbu, a plain tough guy with a Code he\ncould still believe in. And if I won....\n\nI felt better in the clean trappings of tough leather and steel. Torbu\nled the way and fifteen bodyguards followed, like a herd of trolls.\nThere were few palace servants out at this hour; those who saw us gaped\nfrom a safe distance and went on about their business. We crossed the\nempty Audience Hall, climbed a wide staircase, went along a spacious\ncorridor hung with rich brocades and carpeted in deep-pile silk, with\nsoft lights glowing around ornate doors.\n\nWe stopped before a great double door. Two guards in dress purple\nsauntered over to see what it was all about. Torbu clued them in. They\nhesitated, looked us over....\n\n\"We're goin' in, rookie,\" said Torbu. \"Open up.\" They did.\n\nI pushed past Torbu into a room whose splendor made Gope's state\napartment look like a four-dollar motel. Bright Cintelight streamed\nthrough tall windows, showed me a wide bed and somebody in it. I went\nto it, grabbed the bedclothes, and hauled them off onto the floor.\nOwner Qohey sat up slowly--seven feet of muscle. He looked at me,\nglanced past me to the foremost of my escort....\n\nHe was out of the bed like a tiger, coming straight for me. There\nwas no time to fumble with the sword. I went to meet him, threw all\nmy weight into a right haymaker and felt it connect. I plunged past,\nwhirled.\n\nQohey was staggering ... but still on his feet. I had hit him with\neverything I had, nearly broken my fist ... and he was still standing.\nI couldn't let him rest. I was after him, slammed a hard punch to the\nkidneys, caught him across the jaw as he turned, drove a left and right\ninto his stomach----\n\nA girder fell from the top of the Golden Gate Bridge and shattered\nevery bone in my body. There was a booming like heavy surf, and I was\nfloating in it, dead. Then I was in Hell, being prodded by red-hot\ntridents.... I blinked my eyes. The roaring was fading now. I saw\nQohey, leaning against the foot of the bed, breathing heavily. I had to\nget him.\n\nI got my feet under me, stood up. My chest was caved in and my left\narm belonged to somebody else. Okay; I still had my right. I made it\nover to Qohey, maneuvered into position. He didn't look at me; he\nseemed to be having trouble breathing; those gut punches had gotten to\nhim. I picked a spot just behind the right ear, reared back, and threw\na trip-hammer punch with my shoulder and legs behind it. I felt the\njaw go. Qohey jumped the foot-board and piled onto the floor like a\nhundred-car freight hitting an open switch. I sat down on the edge of\nthe bed and sucked in air and tried to ignore the whirling lights that\nwere closing in.\n\nAfter awhile I noticed Torbu standing in front of me with the cat under\none arm. Both of them were grinning at me. \"Any orders, Owner Drgon?\"\n\nI found my voice. \"Wake him up and prop him in a chair. I want to talk\nto him.\"\n\nEx-Owner Qohey didn't much like the idea but after Torbu and a couple\nof other strong-arm lads had explained the situation to him in sign\nlanguage he decided to cooperate.\n\n\"Get off his head, Mull,\" Torbu said. \"And untwist that rope, Blon.\nOwner Drgon wants him in a conversational mood. You guys are gonna\nmake him feel self-conscious.\"\n\nI had been feeling over my ribs, trying to count how many were broken\nand how many just bent. Qohey's punch was a lot like the kick of a\ntwo-ton ostrich. He was looking at me now, eyes wild.\n\n\"Qohey, I want to ask you a few questions. If I don't like the answers,\nI'll see if I can't find quarters for you in the basement annex. I just\nleft a cozy room there myself. There's no view to speak of but it's\npeaceful.\"\n\nQohey grunted something. He was having trouble talking around his\nbroken jaw.\n\n\"The fellow in black,\" I said, \"the one who claimed your place as\nOwner. You netted him and had your bully boys haul him off somewhere. I\nwant to know where.\"\n\nQohey grunted again.\n\n\"Hit him, Torbu,\" I said. \"It will help his enunciation.\" Torbu kicked\nthe former Owner in the shin. Qohey jumped and glowered at him.\n\n\"Call off your dogs,\" he mumbled. \"You'll not find the upstart you seek\nhere.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I sent him away.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"To that place from which you and your turncoat crew will never fetch\nhim back.\"\n\n\"Be more specific.\"\n\nQohey spat.\n\n\"Torbu didn't much like that crack about turncoats,\" I said. \"He's\neager to show you how little. I advise you to talk fast and plain,\nbefore you lose a whole raft of lives.\"\n\n\"Even these swine would never dare--\" I took out the needle-pointed\nknife I was wearing as part of my get-up. I put the point against\nQohey's throat and pushed gently until a trickle of crimson ran down\nthe thick neck.\n\n\"Talk,\" I said quietly, \"or I'll cut your throat myself.\"\n\nQohey had shrunk back as far as he could in the heavy chair.\n\n\"Seek him then, assassin,\" he sneered. \"Seek him in the dungeons of the\nOwner of Owners.\"\n\n\"Keep talking,\" I prompted.\n\n\"The Great Owner commanded that the slave be brought to him ... at the\nPalace of Sapphires by the Shallow Sea.\"\n\n\"Has this Owners' Owner got a name? How'd he hear about him?\"\n\n\"Lord Ommodurad,\" Qohey's voice grated out. He was watching Torbu's\nfoot. \"There was that about the person of the stranger that led me to\ninform him.\"\n\n\"When did he go?\"\n\n\"Yesterday.\"\n\n\"You know this Sapphire Palace, Torbu?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" he answered. \"But the place is tabu; it's crawlin' with demons\nand warlocks. The word is, there's a curse on the--\"\n\n\"Then I'll go in alone,\" I said. I put the knife away. \"But first I've\ngot a call to make at the spaceport at Okk-Hamiloth.\"\n\n\"Sure, Owner Drgon. The port's easy. Some say it's kind of haunted too\nbut that's just a gag; the Greymen hang out there.\"\n\n\"We can take care of the Greymen,\" I said. \"Get fifty of your best men\ntogether and line up some air-cars. I want the outfit ready to move\nout in half an hour.\"\n\n\"What about this chiseler?\" asked Torbu.\n\n\"Seal him up until I get back. If I don't make it, I know he'll\nunderstand.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nIt was not quite dawn when my task force settled down on the smooth\nlanding pad beside the lifeboat that had brought me to Vallon. It stood\nas I had left it seven earth-months before: the port open, the access\nladder extended, the interior lights lit. There weren't any spooks\naboard but they had kept visitors away as effectively as if there had\nbeen. Even the Greymen didn't mess with ghost-boats. Somebody had done\na thorough job of indoctrination on Vallon.\n\n\"You ain't gonna go inside that accursed vessel, are you, Owner Drgon?\"\nasked Torbu, making his cabalistic sign in the air. \"It's manned by\ngobblins--\"\n\n\"That's just propaganda. Where my cat can go, I can go. Look.\"\n\nItzenca scampered up the ladder, and had disappeared inside the boat\nby the time I took the first rung. The guards gawked from below as I\nstepped into the softly lit lounge. The black-and-gold cylinder that\nwas Foster's memory lay in the bag I had packed and left behind, months\nbefore; with it was the other, plain one: Ammaerln's memory. Somewhere\nin Okk-Hamiloth must be the machine that would give these meaning.\nTogether Foster and I would find it.\n\nI found the .38 automatic lying where I had left it. I picked up the\nworn belt, strapped it around me. My Vallonian career to date suggested\nit would be a bright idea to bring it along. The Vallonians had never\ndeveloped any personal armament to equal it. In a society of immortals\nknives were considered lethal enough for all ordinary purposes.\n\n\"Come on, cat,\" I said. \"There's nothing more here we need.\"\n\nBack on the ramp I beckoned my platoon leaders over.\n\n\"I'm going to the Sapphire Palace,\" I said. \"Anybody that doesn't want\nto go can check out now. Pass the word.\"\n\nTorbu stood silent for a long moment, staring straight ahead.\n\n\"I don't like it much, Owner,\" he said. \"But I'll go. And so will the\nrest of 'em.\"\n\n\"There'll be no backing out, once we shove off,\" I said. \"And by the\nway--\" I jacked a round into the chamber of the pistol, raised it, and\nfired the shot into the air. They all jumped. \"If you ever hear that\nsound, come a-running.\"\n\nThe men nodded, turned to their cars. I picked up the cat and piled\ninto the lead vehicle next to Torbu.\n\n\"It's a half-hour run,\" he said. \"We might run into a little Greyman\naction on the way. We can handle 'em.\"\n\nWe lifted, swung to the east, barrelled along at low altitude.\n\n\"What do we do when we get there, boss?\" said Torbu.\n\n\"We play it by ear. Let's see how far we can get on pure gall before\nOmmodurad drops the hanky.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe palace lay below us, rearing blue towers to the twilit sky like\na royal residence in the Munchkin country. Beyond it, sunset colors\nreflected from the silky surface of the Shallow Sea. The timeless\nstones and still waters looked much as they had when Foster set out\nto lose his identity on earth, three thousand years before. But its\nmagnificence was lost on these people. The hulking crew around me\nnever paused to wonder about the marvels wrought by their immortal\nancestors--themselves. Stolidly, they lived their feudal lives in\ndismal contrast with the monuments all about them.\n\nI turned to my cohort of hoodlums. \"You boys claim it's the demons and\nwarlocks that keep the whole of Vallon at arm's length from this place.\nIn that case there's no protocol for a new Owner's reception at the\nBlue Palace. A guy with a little luck and even less of a memory than\nusual could skip the goblins and play it good-natured but dumb: show up\nat the Palace grounds, out of common politeness to the Top Dog, to pay\nhis respects. Anything wrong with that?\"\n\n\"What if they rush us first ... before we got time to go into the act?\"\nsaid somebody in the mob.\n\n\"That's where the luck comes in,\" I said. \"Anybody else?\"\n\nTorbu looked around at his henchmen. There was some shrugging of\nshoulders, a few grunts. He looked at me. \"You do the figurin', Owner,\"\nhe said. \"The boys will back your play.\"\n\nWe were dropping toward the wide lawns now and still no opposition\nshowed itself. Then the towering blue spires were looming over us, and\nwe saw men forming up behind the blue-stained steel gates of the Great\nPavilion.\n\n\"A reception committee,\" I said. \"Hold tight, fellas. Don't start\nanything. The further in we get peaceably, the less that leaves to do\nthe hard way.\"\n\nThe cars settled down gently, well-grouped, and Torbu and I climbed\nout. As quickly as the other boats disgorged their men, ranks were\nclosed, and we moved off toward the gates. Itzenca, as mascot, brought\nup the rear. Still no excitement, no rush by the Palace guards. Had too\nmany centuries of calm made them lackadaisical, or did Ommodurad use a\nbrand of visitor-repellent we couldn't see from here?\n\nWe made it to the gate ... and it opened.\n\n\"In we go,\" I said, \"but be ready....\"\n\nThe uniformed men inside the compound, obviously chosen for their beef\ncontent, kept their distance, looked at us questioningly. We pulled\nup on a broad blue-paved drive and waited for the next move. About\nnow somebody should stride up to us and offer the key to the city--or\nsomething. But there seemed to be a hitch. It was understandable. After\nall there hadn't been any callers dropping cards here for about 2900\nyears.\n\nIt was a long five minutes before a hard case in a beetle-backed\ncarapace of armor and a puffy pink cape bustled down the palace steps\nand came up to us.\n\n\"Who comes in force to the Sapphire Palace?\" he demanded, glancing past\nme at my team-mates.\n\n\"I'm Owner Drgon, fellow,\" I barked. \"These are my honor guard. What\nprovincial welcome is this, from the Great Owner to a loyal liege-man?\"\n\nThat punctured his pomposity a little. He apologized--in a half-hearted\nway--mumbled something about arrangements, and beckoned over a couple\nof side-men. One of them came over and spoke to Torbu, who looked my\nway, hand on dagger hilt.\n\n\"What's this?\" I said. \"Where I go, my men go.\"\n\n\"There is the matter of caste,\" said my pink-caped greeter. \"Packs\nof retainers are not ushered _en masse_ into the presence of Lord\nOmmodurad, Owner of Owners.\"\n\nI thought that one over and failed to come up with a plausible loophole.\n\n\"Okay, Torbu,\" I said. \"Keep the boys together and behave yourselves.\nI'll see you in an hour. Oh, and see that Itzenca gets made comfy.\"\n\nThe beetle man snapped a few orders, then waved me toward the palace\nwith the slightest bow I ever saw. A six-man guard kept me company up\nthe steps and into the Great Pavilion.\n\nI guess I expected the usual velvet-draped audience chamber or\nbarbarically splendid Hall, complete with pipers, fools, and ceremonial\nguards. What I got was an office, about sixteen by eighteen,\nblue-carpeted and tasteful ... but bare-looking. I stopped in front\nof a block of blue-veined grey marble with a couple of quill pens in\na crystal holder and, underneath, leg room for a behemoth, who was\nsitting behind the desk.\n\nHe got to his feet with all the ponderous mass of Nero Wolfe but a lot\nmore agility and grace. \"You wish?\" he rumbled.\n\n\"I'm Owner Drgon, ah ... Great Owner,\" I said. I'd planned to give my\nhost the friendly-but-dumb routine. I was going to find the second part\nof the act easy. There was something about Ommodurad that made me\nfeel like a mouse who'd just changed his mind about the cheese. Qohey\nhad been big, but this guy could crush skulls as most men pinch peanut\nhulls, and in his eyes was the kind of remote look that came of three\nmillenia of not even having to mention the power he asserted.\n\n\"You ignore superstition,\" observed the Big Owner. He didn't waste many\nwords, it seemed. Gope had said he was the silent type. It wasn't a bad\nlead; I decided to follow it.\n\n\"Don't believe in 'em,\" I said.\n\n\"To your business then,\" he continued. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Just been chosen Owner at Bar-Ponderone,\" I said. \"Felt it was only\nfitting that I come and do obeisance before Your Grace.\"\n\n\"That expression is not used.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" This fellow had a disconcerting way of not getting sucked in.\n\"Lord Ommodurad?\"\n\nHe nodded just perceptibly, then turned to the foremost of the herd who\nhad brought me in. \"Quarters for the guest and his retinue.\" His eyes\nhad already withdrawn, like the head of a Galapagos turtle into its\nenormous shell, in contemplation of eternal verities. I piped up again.\n\n\"Ah, pardon me....\" The piercing stare of Ommodurad's eyes was on\nme again. \"There was a friend of mine--,\" I gulped, \"swell guy, but\nimpulsive. It seems he challenged the former Owner of Bar-Ponderone....\"\n\nOmmodurad did no more than twitch an eye-brow but suddenly the air was\nelectric. His stare didn't waver by a millimeter but the lazy slouch\nof the six guards had altered to sprung steel. They hadn't moved but\nI felt them now all around me and not a foot away. I had a sinking\nfeeling that I'd gone too far.\n\n\"--so I thought maybe I'd crave Your Excellency's help, if possible,\nto locate my pal,\" I finished weakly. For an interminable minute the\nOwner of Owners bored into me with his eyes. Then he raised a finger a\nquarter of an inch. The guards relaxed.\n\n\"Quarters for the guest and his retinue,\" repeated Ommodurad. He\nwithdrew then ... without moving. I was dismissed.\n\nI went quietly, attended by my hulking escort.\n\nI tried hard not to let my expression show any excitement, but I was\nfeeling plenty.\n\nOmmodurad was close-mouthed for a reason. I was willing to bet that he\nhad his memories of the Good Time intact.\n\nInstead of the debased modern dialect that I'd heard everywhere since\nmy arrival, Ommodurad spoke flawless Old Vallonian.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was 27 o'clock and the Palace of Sapphires was silent. I was alone\nin the ornate bed chamber the Great Owner had assigned me. It was a\nnice room but I wouldn't learn anything staying in it. Nobody had said\nI was confined to quarters. I'd do a little scouting and see what I\ncould pick up, if anything. I slung on the holster and .38 and slid\nout of the darkened chamber into the scarcely lighter corridor beyond.\nI saw a guard at the far end; he ignored me. I headed in the opposite\ndirection.\n\nNone of the rooms was locked. There was no arsenal at the Palace and no\narchives that lesser folk than the Great Owner could use with profit.\nEverything was easy of access. I guessed that Ommodurad rightly counted\non indifference to keep snoopers away. Here and there guards eyed me\nas I passed along but they said nothing.\n\nI saw again by Cintelight the office where Ommodurad had received me,\nand near it an ostentatious hall with black onyx floor and ceiling,\ngold hangings, and ceremonial ring-board. But the center of attraction\nwas the familiar motif of the concentric circles of the Two Worlds,\nsketched in beaten gold across the broad wall of black marble behind\nthe throne. Here the idea had been elaborated on. Outward from both the\ninner and outer circles flamed the waving lines of a sunburst. At dead\ncenter, a boss, like a sword hilt in form, chased in black and gold,\nerupted a foot from the wall. It was the first time I'd seen the symbol\nsince I'd arrived on Vallon. I found it strangely exciting--like a\nfootprint in the sand.\n\nI went on, toured the laundry and inspected pantries large and small\nand caught a whiff of stables. The palace was asleep; few of its\noccupants noticed me, and those who did hung back, silent. It looked as\nif the Great Owner had given orders to let me roam freely. Somehow I\ndidn't find that comforting.\n\nThen I came into a purple-vaulted hall and saw a squad of guards, the\nsame six who'd kept me such close company earlier in the day. They were\ndrawn up at parade rest, three on each side of a massive ivory door.\nSomebody lived in safety and splendor on the other side.\n\nSix sets of hard eyes turned my way. It was too late to duck back out\nof sight. I trotted up to the first of the row of guards. \"Say, fella,\"\nI stage-whispered, \"where's the ah--you know.\"\n\n\"Every bed chamber is equipped,\" he said gruffly, raising his sword\nand fingering its tip lovingly.\n\n\"Yeah? I never noticed.\" I moved off, looking chastened. If they\nthought I was a kewpie, so much the better. I was a mouse in cat\ncountry here and I wasn't ready to fake a _meow_--not yet.\n\nOn the ground floor I found Torbu and his cohort quartered in a\nbarrack-room off the main entry hall.\n\n\"We're still in enemy territory,\" I reminded Torbu. \"I want every man\nready.\"\n\n\"No fear, boss,\" said Torbu. \"All my bullies got an eye on the door and\na hand on a knife-hilt.\"\n\n\"Have you seen or heard anything useful?\"\n\n\"Naw. These local dullards fall dumb at the first query.\"\n\n\"Keep your ears cocked. I want at least two men awake and on the alert\nall night.\"\n\n\"You bet, noble Drgon.\"\n\nI judged distances carefully as I went back up the two flights to my\nown room. Inside I dropped into a brocaded easy chair and tried to add\nup what I'd seen.\n\nFirst: Ommodurad's apartment, as nearly as I could judge, was directly\nover my own, two floors up. That was a break--or maybe I was where I\nwas for easier surveillance. I'd skip that angle, I decided. It tended\nto discourage me and I needed all the enthusiasm I could generate.\n\nSecond: I wasn't going to learn anything useful trotting around\ncorridors. Ommodurad wasn't the kind to leave traces of skullduggery\nlying around where the guests would see them.\n\nAnd third: I should have known better than to hit this fortress with\ntwo squads and a .38 in the first place. Foster was here; Qohey had\nsaid so and the Great Owner's reaction to my mention of him confirmed\nit. What was it about Foster, anyway, that made him so interesting to\nthese Top People? I'd have to ask him that one when I found him. But to\ndo that I'd have to leave the beaten track.\n\nI went to the wide double window and looked up. A cloud swept from\nthe great three-quarters face of Cinte, blue in the southern sky, and\nI could see an elaborately carved fa\u00e7ade ranging up past a row of\nwindows above my own to a railed balcony bathed in a pale light from\nthe apartment within. If my calculations were correct that would be\nOmmodurad's digs. The front door was guarded like an octogenarian's\nharem but the back way looked like a breeze.\n\nI pulled my head back in and thought about it. It was risky ... but\nit had that element of the unexpected that just might let me get away\nwith it. Tomorrow the Owner of Owners might have thought it through\nand switched me to another room ... or to a cell in the basement. Then\ntoo, wall-scaling didn't occur to these Vallonians as readily as it did\nto a short-timer from earth. They had too much to lose to risk it on a\nchancey climb.\n\nToo much thinking is never a good idea when your pulse is telling you\nit's time for action. I rolled a heavy armoire fairly soundlessly over\nthe deep-pile carpet and lodged it against the door. That might slow\ndown a casual caller. I slipped the magazine out of the automatic,\nfitted nine greasy brass cartridges into it, slammed it home, dropped\nthe pistol back in the holster. It had a comforting weight. I buttoned\nthe strap over it and went back to the window.\n\nThe clouds were back across Cinte's floodlight; that would help. I\nstepped out. The deep carving gave me easy handholds and I made it to\nthe next windowsill without even working up a light sweat. Compared\nwith my last climb, back in Lima, this was a cinch.\n\nI rested a moment, then clambered around the dark window--just in case\nthere was an insomniac on the other side of the glass--and went on up.\nI reached the balcony, had a hairy moment as I groped outward for a\nhold on the smooth floor-tiling above ... and then I was pulling up and\nover the ornamental iron work.\n\nThe balcony was narrow, about twenty feet long, giving on half a dozen\ntall glass doors. Three showed light behind heavy draperies, three\nwere dark. I moved close, tried to see something past the edge of the\ndraperies. No go. I put an ear to the glass, thought maybe I heard a\nsound, like a distant volcano. That would be Ommodurad's bass rumble.\nThe bear was in his cave.\n\nI went along to the dark doors and on impulse tried a handle. It\nturned and the door swung in soundlessly. I felt my pulse pick up\na double-time beat. I stood peering past the edge of the door into\nthe ink-black interior. It didn't look inviting. In fact it looked\nrepellent. Even a country boy like me could see that to step into the\ndragon's den without even a Zippo to spot the footstools with would be\nthe act of a nitwit.\n\nI swallowed hard, got a firm grip on my pistol, and went in.\n\nA soft fold of drapery brushed my face and I had the pistol out and\nmy back to the wall with a speed that would have made Earp faint with\nenvy. My adrenals gave a couple of wild jumps and my nervous system\nfollowed with a variety of sensations, none pleasant.\n\nIt took me a minute to get my Adam's apple swallowed again and remind\nmyself that I was a rough tough son-of-a-gun from the planet earth who\nhad parlayed one short life into more trouble than most Vallonians\nmanaged in half of eternity, and I was on my way to get my pal Foster\nout of a tight spot, hand him back his memory, and set the Two Worlds\nback on the rails they had fallen off of about six hundred years before\nAlexander started looking around for his first rumble.\n\nI stopped before I got so confident I charged into the next room and\nchallenged Ommodurad to wrestle, two falls out of three. I could hear\nhis voice better now, muttering beyond the partition. If I could make\nout what he was saying....\n\nI edged along the wall, found a heavy door, closed and locked. No help\nthere. I felt my way further, found another door. Delicately I tried\nthe handle, eased it open a crack.\n\nA closet, half filled with racked garments. But I could hear more\nclearly now. Maybe it was a double closet with communicating doors both\nto the room I was in and to the next one where the Great Owner was\nstill rambling on. Apparently something had overcome his aversion to\ntalking. There were pauses that must have been filled in by the replies\nof somebody else who didn't have the vocal timbre Ommodurad did.\n\nI felt my way through the hanging clothing, felt over the closet walls.\nI was out of luck: there was no other door. I put an ear to the wall. I\ncould catch an occasional word:\n\n\"... ring ... Okk-Hamiloth ... vaults....\"\n\nIt sounded like something I'd like to hear more about. How could I get\ncloser? On impulse I reached up, touched a low ceiling ... and felt a\nridge like the trim around an access panel to a crawl space.\n\nI crossed my fingers, stood on tip-toe to push at the panel. Nothing\nmoved. I felt around in the dark, encountered a low shelf covered with\nshoes. I investigated; it was movable. I eased it aside a foot or two,\npiled the shoes on the floor, and stepped up.\n\nThe panel was two feet long on a side, with no discernible hinges or\ncatch. I pushed some more, then gritted my teeth and heaved. There\nwas a startlingly loud _crack!_ and the panel lifted. I blinked away\nthe dust that settled in my eyes, reached to feel around within the\nopening, touched nothing but rough floor boards.\n\nThis would be an excellent time, I reflected, to back out of here, get\na few hours' sleep, and tomorrow bid Ommodurad a hearty farewell. Then\nin a few months, after I had had time to organize my new Estate and\nalign a few supporting Owners I could come back in force.\n\nI cocked my head, listening. Ommodurad had stopped talking and another\nvoice said something. Then there was a heavy thump, the clump of feet,\nand a metallic sound. After a moment the Great Owner's voice came\nagain ... and the other voice answered.\n\nI stretched, grabbed the edge of the opening, and pulled myself up. I\nleaned forward, got a leg up, and rolled silently onto the rough floor.\nFeeling my way, I crawled, felt a wall rising, followed it, turned a\ncorner.... The voices were louder, quite suddenly. I saw why: there was\na ventilating register ahead, gridded light gleaming through it. I\ncrept along to the opening, lay flat, peered through it and saw three\nmen.\n\nOmmodurad was standing with his back to me, a giant figure swathed to\nthe eyes in purple robes. Beside him a lean redhead with a leg that had\nbeen broken and badly set stood round-shouldered, teeth bared in an\neager grimace, clutching a rod of office. The third man was Foster.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFoster stood, legs braced apart as though to withstand an earthquake,\nhands manacled before him. He looked steadily at the redhead, like a\nman marking a tree for cutting.\n\n\"I know nothing of these crimes,\" he said.\n\nOmmodurad turned, swept out of sight. The redhead motioned. Foster\nturned away, moving stiffly, passed from my view. I heard a door\nopen and close. I lay where I was and tried to sort out half a dozen\nconflicting impulses that clamored for attention. A few were easy: it\nwouldn't help matters to yell \"Stop, thief!\" or to fall through the\nregister and chase after Foster with loud cries of joy. It wouldn't\nbe much better to scramble out, dash downstairs, and turn out my\nbodyguards to raid Ommodurad's apartment.\n\nWhat might do some good was to gather more information. It had been bad\nluck that I had arrived at my peephole a few minutes too late to hear\nwhat the interview had been all about. But I might still make use of my\nadvantage.\n\nI felt over the register, found fasteners at the corners. They lifted\neasily and the metal grating tilted back into my hands. I laid it\naside, poked my head out. The room was empty, as far as I could see.\nIt was time to take a few chances. I reversed my position, let my legs\nthrough the opening, and dropped softly to the floor. I reached back up\nand managed to prop the grating in position--just in case.\n\nIt was a fancy chamber, hung in purple and furnished for a king. I\npoked through the pigeonholes of a secretary, opened a few cupboards,\npeered under the bed. It looked like I wasn't going to find any useful\nclues lying around loose.\n\nI went to the glass doors to the balcony, unlocked one and left it\najar--in case I wanted to leave in a hurry. There was another door\nacross the room. I went over and tried it: locked.\n\nThat gave me something definite to look for: a key. I rummaged some\nmore in the secretary, then tried the drawer in a small table beside a\nbroad couch and came up with a nice little steel key that looked like\nmaybe....\n\nI tried it. It was. Luck was still coming my way. I pushed open the\ndoor, saw a dark room beyond. I felt for a light switch, flicked it on,\npushed the door shut behind me.\n\nThe room looked like the popular idea of a necromancer's study. The\nwindowless walls were lined with shelves packed closely with books. The\nhigh black-draped ceiling hung like a hovering bat above the ramparted\nfloor of bare, dark-polished wood. Narrow tables choked with books and\ninstruments stood along a side of the chamber and at the far end I saw\na deep-cushioned couch with a heavy dome-shaped apparatus like a beauty\nshop hair-dryer mounted at one end. I recognized it: it was a memory\nreinforcing machine, the first I had seen on Vallon.\n\nI crossed the room and examined it. The last one I had seen--on the\nFar-Voyager in the room near the library--had been a stark utility\nmodel. This was a deluxe job, with soft upholstery and bright metal\nfittings and more dials and idiot lights than a late model Detroit\nstatus symbol. This solved one of the problems that had been hovering\naround the edge of my mind. I had fetched Foster's memory back to him,\nbut without a machine to use it in it was just a tantalizing souvenir.\nNow all I had to do was sneak him away from Ommodurad, make it back\nhere....\n\nAll of a sudden I felt tired, vulnerable, helpless, and all alone. I\nhad been taking wild chances, setting my head more and more brazenly\ninto the kind of iron noose the Big Owner would arrange for his\nenemies ... and without the ghost of a plan, without even an idea of\nwhat was going on. What was Ommodurad's interest in Foster? Why did he\nhide away here, keeping the rest of Vallon away with rumors of magic\nand spells? What connection did he have with the disaster that had\nbefallen the Two Worlds--now reduced to One, and a poor one at that.\n\nAnd why was I, a plain Joe named Legion, mixed up in it right to the\neyebrows, when I could be sitting safe at home in a clean federal pen?\n\nThe answer to that last one wasn't too hard to recite: I had had a pal\nonce, a smooth character named Foster, who had pulled me back from\nthe ragged edge just when I was about to make a bigger mistake than\nusual. He had been a gentleman in the best sense of the word, and he\nhad treated me like one. Together we had shared a strange adventure\nthat had made me rich and had showed me that it was never too late to\nstraighten your back and take on whatever the Fates handed out.\n\nI had come running his way when trouble got too thick back home. And\nI'd found him in a worse spot that I was in. He had come back, after\nthe most agonizing exile a man had ever suffered, to find his world\nfallen back into savagery, and his memory still eluding him. Now he was\nin chains, without friends and without hope ... but still not broken,\nstill standing on his own two feet....\n\nBut he was wrong on one point: he had one little hope. Not much: just\na hard-luck guy with a penchant for bad decisions, but I was here and\nI was free. I had my pistol on my hip and a neat back way into the\nOwner's bedroom, and if I played it right and watched my timing and had\nmaybe just a little luck, say about the amount it took to hit the Irish\nSweepstakes, I might bring it off yet.\n\nRight now it was time to return to my crawl-space. Ommodurad might come\nback and talk some more, tip me off to a vulnerable spot in the armor\nof his fortress. I went to the door, flicked off the light, turned the\nhandle ... and went rigid.\n\nOmmodurad was back. He pulled off the purple cloak, tossed it aside,\nstrode to a wall bar. I clung to the crack of the door, not daring to\nmove even to close it.\n\n\"But my lord,\" the voice of the redhead said, \"I know he remembers--\"\n\n\"Not so,\" Ommodurad's voice rumbled. \"On the morrow I strip his mind to\nthe bare clean jelly....\"\n\n\"Let me, dread lord. With my steel I'll have the truth from him.\"\n\n\"Such a one as he your steel has never known!\" the bass voice snarled.\n\n\"Great Owner, I crave but one hour ... tomorrow, in the Ceremonial\nChamber. I shall environ him with the emblems of the past--\"\n\n\"Enough!\" Ommodurad's fist slammed against the bar, made glasses jump.\n\"On such starveling lackwits as you a mighty empire hangs. It is a\ncrime before the Gods and on his head I lay it.\" The Owner tossed off a\nglass, jerked his head at the cowering man. \"Still, I grant thy boon.\nNow begone, babbler of folly.\"\n\nThe redhead ducked, grinning, disappeared. Ommodurad muttered to\nhimself, strode up and down the room, stood staring out into the night.\nHe noticed the open balcony door, pulled it shut with a curse. I held\nmy breath but no general check of doors followed.\n\nThe big man threw off his clothes then. He clambered up on the wide\ncouch, touched a switch somewhere, and the room was dark. Within five\nminutes I heard the heavy breathing of deep sleep.\n\nI had found out one thing anyway: tomorrow was Foster's last day. One\nway or another Ommodurad and the redhead between them would destroy\nhim. That didn't leave much time. But since the project was already\nhopeless it didn't make much difference.\n\nI had a choice of moves now: I could tip-toe across to the register and\ntry to wiggle through it without waking up the brontosaurus on the\nbed ... or I could try for the balcony door a foot from where he\nslept ... or I could stay put and wait him out. The last idea had the\nvirtue of requiring no immediate daring adventures. I could just curl\nup on the floor, or, better still, on the padded couch....\n\nA weird idea was taking shape in my mind like a genie rising from a\nbottle. I felt in my pocket, pulled out the two small cylinders that\nrepresented two men's memories of hundreds of years of living. One\nbelonged to Foster, the one with the black and golden bands; but the\nother was the property of a stranger who had died three thousand years\nago, out in space....\n\nThis cylinder, barely three inches long, held all the memories of a man\nwho had been Foster's confidant when he was Qulqlan, a man who knew\nwhat had happened aboard the ship, what the purpose of the expedition\nhad been, and what conditions they had left behind on Vallon.\n\nI needed that knowledge. I needed any knowledge I could get, to add a\nfeather-weight to my side of the balance when the showdown came. The\ncylinder would tell me plenty, including, possibly, the reason for\nOmmodurad's interest in Foster.\n\nIt was simple to use. I merely placed the cylinder in the receptacle\nin the side of the machine, took my place, lowered the helmet into\nposition ... and in an hour or so I would awaken with another man's\nmemories stored in my brain, to use as I saw fit.\n\nIt would be a crime to waste the opportunity. The machine I had found\nhere was probably the only one still in existence on Vallon. I had\nblundered my way into the one room in the palace that could help me in\nwhat I had to do; I had been lucky; I couldn't waste that luck.\n\nI went across to the soft-cushioned chair, spotted the recess in its\nside, and thrust the plain cylinder into it; it seated with a click.\n\nI sat on the couch, lay back, reached up to pull the headpiece down\ninto position against my skull....\n\nThere was an instant of pain--like a pre-frontal lobotomy performed\nwithout anesthetic.\n\nThen blackness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\n_I stood beside the royal couch where Qulqlan the Rthr lay and I saw\nthat this was the hour for which I had waited long, for the Change was\non him...._\n\n_The time-scale stood at the third hour of the Death watch; all aboard\nslept save myself alone. I must move swiftly and at the Dawn watch show\nthem the deed well done._\n\n_I shook the sleeping man; him who had once been the Rthr--king no\nmore, by the law of the Change. He wakened slowly, looked about him,\nwith the clear eyes of the newborn._\n\n_\"Rise,\" I commanded. And the king obeyed._\n\n_\"Follow me,\" I said. He made to question me, after the manner of those\nnewly awakened from their Change. I bade him be silent. Like a lamb he\ncame and I led him through shadowed ways to the cage of the Hunters.\nThey rose, keen in their hunger, to my coming, as I had trained them._\n\n_I took the arm of Qulqlan and thrust it into the cage. The Hunters\nclustered, taking the mark of their prey. He watched, innocent eyes\nwide._\n\n_\"That which you feel is pain, mindless one,\" I spoke. \"It is a thing\nof which you will learn much in the time before you.\" Then they had\ndone, and I set the time catch._\n\n_In my chambers I cloaked the innocent in a plain purple robe and\nafterward led him to the cradle where the lifeboat lay...._\n\n_And by virtue of the curse of the Gods which is upon me one was there\nbefore me. I waited not, but moved as the haik strikes and took him\nfair in the back with my dagger. I dragged the body into hiding behind\nthe flared foot of a column. But no sooner was he hidden well away\nthan others came from the shadows, summoned by some device I know not\nof. They asked of the Rthr wherefore he walked by night, robed in the\ncolors of Ammaerln of Bros-Ilyond. And I knew black despair, that my\ngrand design foundered thus in the shallows of their zeal._\n\n_Yet I spoke forth, with a great show of anger, that I, Ammaerln,\nvizier and companion to the Rthr, did but walk and speak in confidence\nwith my liege lord._\n\n_But they persisted, Gholad foremost among them. And then one saw the\nhidden corse and in an instant they ringed me in:_\n\n_Then did I draw the long blade and hold it at the throat of Qulqlan.\n\"Press me not; or your king will surely die,\" I said. And they feared\nme and shrank back._\n\n_\"Do you dream that I, Ammaerln, wisest of the wise, have come here\nfor the love of Far-Voyaging?\" I raged. \"Long have I plotted against\nthis hour, to lure the king a-voyaging in this his princely yacht, his\nfaithful vizier at his side, that the Change might come to him far from\nhis court. Then would the ancient wrong be redressed._\n\n_\"There are those men born to rule, as the dream-tree seeks the\nsun--and such a one am I! Long has this one, now mindless, denied to\nme my destiny. But behold: I, with a stroke, shall set things aright._\n\n_\"Below us lies a green world, peopled by savages. Not one am I to take\nblood vengeance on a man newborn from the Change. Instead I shall set\nhim free to take up his life there below. May the Fates lead him again\nto royal state if that be their will--\"_\n\n_But there were naught but fools among them and they drew steel. I\ncried out to them that all, all should share!_\n\n_But they heeded me not but rushed upon me. Then did I turn to Qulqlan\nand drive the long blade at his throat, but Gholad threw himself before\nhim and fell in his place. Then they pressed me and I did strike out\nagainst three who hemmed me close, and though they took many wounds\nthey persisted in their madness, one leaping in to strike and another\nat my back, so that I whirled and slashed at shadows who danced away._\n\n_In the end I hunted them down in those corners whither they had\ndragged themselves and each did I put to the sword. And I turned at\nlast to find the Rthr gone and some few with them, and madness took me\nthat I had been gulled like a tinker by common men._\n\n_In the chamber of the memory couch would I find them. There they would\nseek to give back to the mindless one that memory of past glories which\nI had schemed so long to deny him. Almost I wept to see such cunning\nwasted. Terrible in my wrath I came upon them there. There were but two\nand, though they stood shoulder to shoulder in the entry way, their\npoor dirks were no match for my long blade. I struck them dead and went\nto the couch, to lay my hand on the cylinder marked with the vile gold\nand black of Qulqlan, that I might destroy it and with it the Rthr,\nforever--_\n\n_And I heard a sound and whirled about. A hideous figure staggered to\nme from the gloom and for an instant I saw the flash of steel in the\nbloody hand of the accursed Gholad whom I had left for dead. Then I\nknew cold agony between my ribs...._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_Gholad lay slumped against the wall, his face greenish above the\nblood-soaked tunic. When he spoke air whistled through his slashed\nthroat._\n\n_\"Have done, traitor who once was honored of the king,\" he whispered.\n\"Have you no pity for him who once ruled in justice and splendor at\nHigh Okk-Hamiloth?\"_\n\n_\"Had you not robbed me of my destiny, murderous dog,\" I croaked, \"that\nsplendor would have been mine.\"_\n\n_\"You came upon him helpless,\" gasped Gholad. \"Make some amends now for\nyour shame. Let the Rthr have his mind, which is more precious than his\nlife.\"_\n\n_\"I but rest to gather strength. Soon will I rise and turn him from the\ncouch. Then will I die content.\"_\n\n_\"Once you were his friend,\" Gholad whispered. \"By his side you fought,\nwhen both of you were young. Remember that ... and have pity. To leave\nhim here, in this ship of death, mindless and alone....\"_\n\n_\"I have loosed the Hunters!\" I shrieked in triumph. \"With them will\nthe Rthr share this tomb until the end of time!\"_\n\n_Then I searched within me and found a last terrible strength and I\nrose up ... and even as my hand reached out to pluck away the mind\ntrace of the king I felt the bloody fingers of Gholad on my ankle, and\nthen my strength was gone. And I was falling headlong into that dark\nwell of death from which there is no returning...._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI woke up and lay for a long time in the dark without moving, trying\nto remember the fragments of a strange dream of violence and death.\nI could still taste the lingering dregs of some bitter emotion. But\nI had more important things to think about than dreams. For just a\nmoment I couldn't remember what it was I had to do; then with a start\nI remembered where I was. I had lain down on the couch and pulled the\nheadpiece into place--\n\nIt hadn't worked.\n\nI thought hard, tried to tap a new reservoir of memories, drew a blank.\nMaybe my earth-mind was too alien for the Vallonian memory-trace to\naffect. It was another good idea that hadn't worked out. But at least\nI had had a good rest. Now it was time to get moving. First--to see if\nOmmodurad was still asleep. I started to sit up--\n\nNothing happened.\n\nI had a moment of vertigo, as my inner ear tried to accommodate to\nhaving stayed in the same place after automatically adjusting to my\nintention of rising. I lay perfectly still and tried to think it\nthrough.\n\nI had tried to move ... and hadn't so much as twitched a muscle. I\nwas paralyzed ... or tied up ... or maybe, if I was lucky, imagining\nthings. I could try it again and next time--\n\nI was afraid to try. Suppose I tried and nothing happened--again? It\nwas better to lie here and tell myself it was all a mistake. Maybe I\nshould go back to sleep and wake up later and try it again....\n\nThis was ridiculous. All I had to do was sit up. I--\n\nNothing. I lay in the dark and tried to will an arm to move, my head\nto turn. It was as though I had no arm, no head--just a mind--alone\nin the dark. I strained to sense the ropes that held me down: still\nnothing. No ropes, no arms, no body. There was no pressure against me\nfrom the couch, no vagrant itch or cramp, no physical sensation. I was\na disembodied brain, lying nestled in a great bed of pitchblack cotton\nwool.\n\nThen, abruptly, I was aware of myself--not the gross mechanism of bone\nand muscle, but the neuro-electric field generated within a brain alive\nwith flashing currents and a lightning interplay of molecular forces. A\nsense of orientation grew. I occupied a block of cells ... here in the\nleft hemisphere. The mass of neural tissue loomed over me, gigantic.\nAnd \"I\" ... \"I\" was reduced to the elemental ego, who possessed as a\nmaterial appurtenance \"my\" arms and legs, \"my\" body, \"my\" brain....\nRelieved of outside stimuli, I was able now to conceptualize myself\nas I actually was: an insubstantial state existing in an immaterial\ncontinuum, created by the action of neural currents within the\ncerebrum, as a magnetic field is created in space by the flow of\nelectricity.\n\nAnd I knew what had happened. I had opened my mind to invasion by alien\nmemories. The other mind had seized upon the sensory centers and driven\nme to this dark corner. I was a fugitive within my own skull.\n\nFor a timeless time I lay stunned, immured now as the massive stones\nof Bar-Ponderone had never confined me. My basic self-awareness still\nsurvived, out was shunted aside, cut off from any contact with the body\nitself.\n\nWith shadowy fingers of imagination I clawed at the walls surrounding\nme, fought for a glimpse of light, for a way out.\n\nAnd found none.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen, at last, I began again to think.\n\nI must analyze my awareness of my surroundings, seek out channels\nthrough which impulses from sensory nerves flowed, and tap them.\n\nI tried cautiously; an extension of my self-concept reached out with\nultimate delicacy. There were the ranked infinities of cells, there\nthe rushing torrents of gross fluid, there the taut cables of the\ninterconnecting web, and there--\n\nBarrier! Blank and impregnable, the wall reared up. My questing tendril\nof self-stuff raced over the surface like an ant over a melon, and\nfound no tiniest fissure. It loomed alien, inscrutable: the invader who\nhad stolen my brain.\n\nI withdrew. To dissipate my force was senseless. I must select a point\nof attack, hurl against it all the power of my surviving\nidentity ... before it too dwindled away and the abstraction that was\nLegion vanished forevermore.\n\nThe last of the phantom emotions that had clung--for how long?--to the\nincorporeal mind field had faded now, leaving me with no more than\nan intellectual determination to reassert myself. Dimly I recognized\nthis sign of my waning sense of identity but there was no surge of\ninstinctive fear. Instead I coolly assessed my resources--and almost at\nonce stumbled into an unused channel, here within my own self-field.\nFor a moment I recoiled from the outr\u00e9 configuration of the stored\npatterns ... and then I remembered.\n\nI had been in the water, struggling, while the Red soldier waited,\nrifle aimed. And then: a flood of data, flowing with cold, impersonal\nprecision. And I had deftly marshalled the forces of my body to survive.\n\nAnd once more: as I hung by numbed fingers under the cornice of the\nYordano Building, the cold voice had spoken.\n\nAnd I had forgotten. The miracle had been pushed back, rejected by\nthe conscious mind. But now I knew: this was the knowledge that I had\nreceived from the background briefing device that I had used in my\nisland strong-room before I fled. This was the survival data known to\nall Old Vallonians of the days of the Two Worlds. It had lain here,\nunused, the secrets of superhuman strength and endurance ... buried by\nthe imbecile of censor-self's aversion to the alien.\n\nBut the ego alone remained now, stripped of the burden of neurosis,\nfreed from subconscious pressures. The levels of the mind were laid\nbare, and I saw close at hand the regions where dreams were born, the\nbarren sources of instinctive fear-patterns, the linkages to blinding\nemotions; and all lay now under my overt control.\n\nWithout further hesitation I tapped the stored Vallonian knowledge,\nencompassed it, made it mine. Then again I approached the barrier,\nspread out across it, probed in vain--\n\n\"_... vile primitive...._\"\n\nThe thought thundered out with crushing force. I recoiled, then renewed\nmy attack, alert now. I knew what to do.\n\nI sought and found a line of synaptic weakness, burrowed at it--\n\n\"_... intolerable ... vestigial ... erasure...._\"\n\nI struck instantly, slipped past the shield, laid firm hold on an optic\nreceptor bank. The alien mind threw itself against me, but too late. I\nheld secure and the assault faded, withdrew. Cautiously I extended my\ninterpretive receptivity. There was a pattern of pulses, oscillations\nin the lambda/mu range. I tuned, focussed--\n\nAbruptly I was seeing. For a moment my fragile equilibrium tottered,\nas I strove to integrate the flow of external stimuli into my bodiless\nself-concept. Then a balance was struck: I held my ground and stared\nthrough the one eye I had recaptured from the usurper.\n\nAnd I reeled again!\n\nBright daylight blazed in the chamber of Ommodurad. The scene shifted\nas the body moved about, crossing the room, turning.... I had assumed\nthat the body still lay in the dark but instead, it walked, without my\nknowledge, propelled by a stranger.\n\nThe field of vision flashed across the couch. Ommodurad was gone.\n\nI sensed that the entire left lobe, disoriented by the loss of the\neye, had slipped now to secondary awareness, its defenses weakened. I\nretreated momentarily from my optic outpost, laid a temporary traumatic\nblock across the access nerves to keep the intruder from reasserting\npossession, and concentrated my force in an attack on the auricular\nchannels. It was an easy rout. Instantly my eye coordinated its\nimpressions with those coming in along the aural nerves ... and heard\nmy voice mouth a curse.\n\nThe body was standing beside a bare wall with a hand laid upon it. In\nthe wall a recess partly obscured by a sliding panel stood empty.\n\nThe body turned, strode to a doorway, emerged into a gloomy\nviolet-shadowed corridor. The glance flicked from the face of one guard\nto another. They stared in open-mouthed surprise, brought weapons up.\n\n\"You dare to bar the path to the Lord Ammaerln?\" My voice slashed at\nthe men. \"Stand aside, as you value your lives.\"\n\nAnd the body pushed past them, striding off along the corridor. It\npassed through a great archway, descended a flight of marble stairs,\ncame along a hall I had seen on my tour of the Palace of Sapphires and\ninto the Onyx Chamber with the great golden sunburst that covered the\nhigh black wall.\n\nIn the Great Owner's chair at the ring-board Ommodurad sat scowling at\nthe lame courtier whose red hair was hidden now under a black cowl.\nBetween them Foster stood, the heavy manacles dragging at his wrists.\nOmmodurad turned; his face paled, then flushed darkly. He rose, teeth\nbared.\n\nThe gaze of my eye fixed on Foster. Foster stared back, a look of\nincredulity growing on his face.\n\n\"My Lord Rthr,\" I heard my voice say. The eye swept down and fixed on\nthe manacles. The body drew back a step, as if in horror.\n\n\"You overreach yourself, Ommodurad!\" my voice cried harshly.\n\nOmmodurad stepped toward me, his immense arm raised.\n\n\"Lay not a hand on me, dog of a usurper!\" my voice roared out. \"By the\nGods, would you take me for common clay?\"\n\nAnd, unbelievably, Ommodurad paused, stared in my face.\n\n\"I know you as the upstart Drgon, petty Owner,\" he rumbled. \"But I know\nI see another there behind your pale eyes.\"\n\n\"Foul was the crime that brought me to this pass,\" my voice said.\n\"But ... know that your master, Ammaerln, stands before you, in the\nbody of a primitive!\"\n\n\"Ammaerln...!\" Ommodurad jerked as though he had been struck.\n\nMy body turned, dismissing him. The eye rested on Foster.\n\n\"My liege,\" my voice said unctuously. \"I swear the dog dies for this\ntreason----\"\n\n\"It is a mindless one, intruder,\" Ommodurad broke in. \"Seek no favor\nwith the Rthr for he that was Rthr is no more. You deal with me now.\"\n\nMy body whirled on Ommodurad. \"Give a thought to your tone, lest your\nambitions prove your death!\"\n\nOmmodurad put a hand to his dagger. \"Ammaerln of Bros-Ilyond you may\nbe, or a changeling from dark regions I know not of. But know that this\nday I hold all power in Vallon.\"\n\n\"And what of this one who was once Qulqlan? What consort do you\nhold with him you say is mindless?\" I saw my hand sweep out in a\ncontemptuous gesture at Foster.\n\n\"An end to patience!\" the Great Owner roared. \"Shall I stand in my\ninner citadel and give account of myself to a madman?\" He started\ntoward my body.\n\n\"Does the fool, Ommodurad, forget the power of the great Ammaerln?\"\nmy voice said softly. And the towering figure hesitated once more,\nsearching my face. \"The Rthr's hour is past ... and yours, bungler\nand fool,\" my voice went on. \"Your months--or is it years?--of\nself-delusion are ended.\" My voice rose in a bellow: \"Know that I ...\nAmmaerln, the great ... have returned to rule at High Okk-Hamiloth.\"\n\n\"Months?\" rumbled Ommodurad. \"Indeed, I believe the tales of the\nGreymen are true and that an evil spirit has returned to haunt me. You\nspeak of months?\" He threw back his head, laughed a choked throaty\nlaugh that was half sob.\n\n\"Know, demon, or madman, or ancient prince of evil: for thirty\ncenturies have I brooded alone, sealed from an empire by a single key!\"\n\nI felt the shock rack through and through the invader mind. This was\nthe opportunity I had hoped for. Quick as thought I moved, slashed at\nthe wavering shield, and was past it----\n\nI grappled onto the foul mind-matrix, scanned its symbolisms: a miasma\nof twisted concepts like great webs, asquirm with bristling nodes like\ncrouching spiders--and through it all a yammering torrent of deformed\nthought-shapes.\n\nIn my eagerness I was careless. The invader mind, recovering, struck\nback. Too late I felt it slip into my awareness, flick over the stored\ninformation. I leaped to protect one fact ... and lost my gains. With\nonly a single tenuous line of rapport with the alien mind still open,\nI clung, shaken--but hugging precious patterns of stolen data. My raid\nhad been no more than an irritation to the other mind ... but I had\nfetched away a mass of information. I interpreted it, integrated it,\nmatched it to known patterns. A complex structure of relationships\nevolved, growing into a new awareness.\n\nUpon the mind-picture of Foster's face was now super-imposed another:\nthat of Qulqlan, Rthr of all Vallon, ruler of the Two Worlds!\n\nAnd other pictures, snatched from the intruder mind, were present now\nin the earth-consciousness of me, Legion.\n\nThe Vaults, deep in the rock under the fabled city of Okk-Hamiloth,\nwhere the mind-trace of every citizen was stored, sealed by the Rthr\nand keyed to his mind alone.\n\nAmmaerln, urging the king to embark on a Far-Voyage, stressing the\nburden of government, tempting him to bring with him the royal\nmind-trace; Qulqlan's acquiescence and Ammaerln's secret joy at the\nadvancement of his scheme; the coming of the Change for the Rthr,\naboard ship, far out in space--and the vizier's bold stroke;\nand then the fools who found him at the lifeboat ... and the loss of\nall, all....\n\nThere my own memories took up the tale: the awakening of Foster,\nunsuspecting, and his recording of the mind of the dying Ammaerlin;\nthe flight from the Hunters; the memory-trace of the king that lay for\nthree millenia among neolithic bones until I, a primitive, plucked\nit from its place; and the pocket of a coarse fibre garment where\nthe cylinder lay now--on the hip of the body I inhabited but as\ninaccessible to me as if it had been a million miles away.\n\nBut there was a second memory-trace--Ammaerln's. I had crossed a galaxy\nto come to Foster, and with me, locked in an unmarked pewter cylinder,\nI had brought Foster's ancient nemesis.\n\nI had given it life, and a body.\n\nFoster, once Rthr, had survived against all logic and had come back,\nback from the dead: the last hope of a golden age....\n\nTo meet his fate at my hands.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Three thousand years,\" I heard my voice saying. \"Three thousand years\nhave the men of Vallon lived mindless, with the glory that was Vallon\nlocked away in a vault without a key.\"\n\n\"I, alone,\" said Ommodurad, \"have borne the curse of knowledge. Long\nago, in the days of the Rthr, I took my mind-trace from the vaults in\nanticipation of the day of days when he should fall. Little joy has it\nbrought me.\"\n\n\"And now,\" my voice said, \"you think to force this mind--that is no\nmind--to unseal the vault?\"\n\n\"I know it for a hopeless task,\" Ommodurad said. \"At first I\nthought--since he speaks the tongue of old Vallon--that he dissembled.\nBut he knows nothing. This is but the dry husk of the Rthr ... and I\nsicken of the sight. I would fain kill him now and let the long farce\nend.\"\n\n\"Not so!\" my voice cut in. \"Once I decreed exile to the mindless one.\nSo be it!\"\n\nThe face of Ommodurad twisted in its rage. \"Your witless chatterings\ntoo! I tire of them.\"\n\n\"Wait!\" my voice snarled. \"Would you put aside the key?\"\n\nThere was a silence as Ommodurad stared at my face. I saw my hand rise\ninto view. Gripped in it was Foster's memory-trace.\n\n\"The Two Worlds lie in my hand,\" my voice spoke. \"Observe well the\nblack and golden bands of the royal memory-trace. Who holds this key\nis all-powerful. As for the mindless body yonder, let it be destroyed.\"\n\nOmmodurad locked eyes with mine. Then, \"Let the deed be done,\" he said.\n\nThe redhead drew a long stiletto from under his cloak, smiling. I could\nwait no longer....\n\nAlong the link I had kept through the intruder's barrier I poured the\nlast of the stored energy of my mind. I felt the enemy recoil, then\nstrike back with crushing force. But I was past the shield.\n\nAs the invader reached out to encircle me I shattered my unified\nforward impulse into myriad nervous streamlets that flowed on, under,\nover and around the opposing force; I spread myself through and through\nthe inner all-mass, drawing new power from the trunk sources.\n\nI caught a vicious blast of pure wrath that rocked me and then I\ngrappled, shield to shield, with the alien. And he was stronger.\n\nLike a corrosive fluid the massive personality-gestalt shredded my\nextended self-field. I drew back, slowly, reluctantly. I caught a\nshadowy impression of the body, standing rigid, eyes blank, and sensed\na rumbling voice that spoke: \"Quick! The intruder!\"\n\nNow! I struck for the right optic center, clamped down with a death\ngrip.\n\nThe enemy mind went mad as the darkness closed in. I heard my voice\nscream and I saw in vivid pantomime the vision that threatened the\ninvader: the redhead darting to me, the stiletto flashing----\n\nAnd then the invading mind broke, swirled into chaos, and was gone....\n\nI reeled, shocked and alone inside my skull. The brain loomed, dark\nand untenanted now. I began to move, crept along the major nerve paths,\nreoccupied the cortex----\n\nAgony! I twisted, felt again with a massive return of sensation my\narms, my legs, opened both eyes to see blurred figures moving. And in\nmy chest a hideous pain....\n\nI was sprawled on the floor, gasping. Sudden understanding came: the\nredhead had struck ... and the other mind, in full rapport with the\npain centers, had broken under the shock, left the stricken brain to me\nalone.\n\nAs through a red veil I saw the giant figure of Ommodurad loom, stoop\nover me, rise with the royal cylinder in his hand. And beyond, Foster,\nstrained backward, the chain between his wrists garroting the redhead.\nOmmodurad turned, took a step, flicked the man from Foster's grasp and\nhurled him aside. He drew his dagger. Quick as a hunting cat Foster\nleaped, struck with the manacles ... and the knife clattered across the\nfloor. Ommodurad backed away with a curse, while the redhead seized\nthe stiletto he had let fall and moved in. Foster turned to meet him,\nstaggering, and raised heavy arms.\n\nI fought to move, got my hand as far as my side, fumbled with the\nleather strap. The alien mind had stolen from my brain the knowledge of\nthe cylinder but I had kept from it the fact of the pistol. I had my\nhand on its butt now. Painfully I drew it, dragged my arm up, struggled\nto raise the weapon, centered it on the back of the mop of red hair,\nfree now of the cowl ... and fired.\n\nOmmodurad had found his dagger. He turned back from the corner where\nFoster had sent it spinning. Spattered with the blood of the redhead,\nFoster retreated until his back was at the wall: a haggard figure\nagainst the gaudy golden sunburst. The flames of beaten metal shimmered\nand flared before my dimming vision. The great gold circles of the Two\nWorlds seemed to revolve, while waves of darkness rolled over me.\n\nBut there was a thought: something I had found among the patterns in\nthe intruder's mind. At the center of the sunburst rose a boss, in\nblack and gold, erupting a foot from the wall, like a sword-hilt....\n\nThe thought came from far away. The sword of the Rthr, used once, in\nthe dawn of a world, by a warrior king--but laid away now, locked in\nits sheath of stone, keyed to the mind-pattern of the Rthr, that none\nother might ever draw it to some ignoble end.\n\nA sword, keyed to the basic mind-pattern of the king....\n\nI drew a last breath, blinked back the darkness. Ommodurad stepped past\nme, knife in hand, toward the unarmed man.\n\n\"Foster,\" I croaked. \"The sword....\"\n\nFoster's head came up. I had spoken in English; the syllables rang\nstrangely in that outworld setting. Ommodurad ignored the unknown words.\n\n\"Draw ... the sword ... from the stone!... You're ... Qulqlan ...\nRthr ... of Vallon.\"\n\nI saw him reach out, grasp the ornate hilt. Ommodurad, with a cry,\nleaped toward him--\n\nThe sword slid out smoothly, four feet of glittering steel. Ommodurad\nstopped, stared at the manacled hands gripping the hilt of the fabled\nblade. Slowly he sank to his knees, bent his neck.\n\n\"I yield, Qulqlan,\" he said. \"I crave the mercy of the Rthr.\"\n\nBehind me I heard thundering feet. Dimly I was aware of Torbu raising\nmy head, of Foster leaning over me. They were saying something but I\ncouldn't hear. My feet were cold, and the coldness crept higher.\n\nI felt hands touch me and the cool smoothness of metal against my\ntemples. I wanted to say something, tell Foster that I had found the\nanswer, the one that had always eluded me before. I wanted to tell him\nthat all lives are the same length when viewed from the foreshortened\nperspective of death, and that life, like music, requires no meaning\nbut only a certain symmetry.\n\nBut it was too hard. I tried to cling to the thought, to carry it with\nme into the cold void toward which I moved, but it slipped away and\nthere was only my self-awareness, alone in emptiness, and the winds\nthat swept through eternity blew away the last shred of ego and I was\none with darkness....\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE\n\n\nI awoke to a light like that of a morning when the world was young.\nGossamer curtains fluttered at tall windows, through which I saw a\nsquadron of trim white clouds riding in a high blue sky.\n\nI turned my head, and Foster stood beside me, dressed in a short white\ntunic.\n\n\"That's a crazy set of threads, Foster,\" I said, \"but on your build it\nlooks good. But you've aged; you look twenty-five if you look a day.\"\n\nFoster smiled. \"Welcome to Vallon, my friend,\" he said in English. I\nnoticed that he faltered a bit over the words, as if he hadn't used\nthem for a long time.\n\n\"Vallon,\" I said. \"Then it wasn't all a dream?\"\n\n\"Regard it as a dream, Legion. Your life begins today.\"\n\n\"There was something,\" I said, \"something I had to do. But it doesn't\nseem to matter. I feel relaxed inside....\"\n\nSomeone came forward from behind Foster.\n\n\"Gope,\" I said. Then I hesitated. \"You are Gope, aren't you?\" I said in\nVallonian.\n\nHe laughed. \"I was known by that name once,\" he said, \"but my true name\nis Gwanne.\"\n\nMy eyes fell on my legs. I saw that I was wearing a tunic like Foster's\nexcept that mine was pale blue.\n\n\"Who put the dress on me?\" I asked. \"And where's my pants?\"\n\n\"This garment suits you better,\" said Gope. \"Come. Look in the glass.\"\n\nI got to my feet, stepped to a long mirror, glanced at the reflection.\n\"It's not the real me, boys,\" I started----Then I stared, open-mouthed.\nA Hercules, black-haired and clean-limbed, stared back. I shut my\nmouth ... and his mouth shut. I moved an arm and he did likewise. I\nwhirled on Foster.\n\n\"What ... how ... who...?\"\n\n\"The mortal body that was Legion died of its wounds,\" he said, \"but the\nmind that was the man was recorded. We have waited many years to give\nthat mind life again.\"\n\nI turned back to the mirror, gaped. The young giant gaped back. \"I\nremember,\" I said. \"I remember ... a knife in my guts ... and a\nredheaded man ... and the Great Owner, and....\"\n\n\"For his crimes,\" told Gope, \"he went to a place of exile until the\nChange should come on him. Long have we waited.\"\n\nI looked again and now I saw two faces in the mirror and both of them\nwere young. One was low down, just above my ankles, and it belonged to\na cat I had known as Itzenca. The other, higher up, was that of a man I\nhad known as Ommodurad. But this was a clear-eyed Ommodurad, just under\ntwenty-one.\n\n\"Onto the blank slate we traced your mind,\" said Gope.\n\n\"He owed you a life, Legion,\" Foster said. \"His own was forfeit.\"\n\n\"I guess I ought to kick and scream and demand my original ugly puss\nback,\" I said slowly, studying my reflection, \"but the fact is, I like\nlooking like Mr. Universe.\"\n\n\"Your earthly body was infected with the germs of old age,\" said\nFoster. \"Now you can look forward to a great span of life.\"\n\n\"But come,\" said Gope. \"All Vallon waits to honor you.\" He led the way\nto the tall window.\n\n\"Your place is by my side at the great ring-board,\" said Foster. \"And\nafterwards: all of the Two Worlds lie before you.\"\n\nI looked past the open window and saw a carpet of velvet green that\ncurved over foothills to the rim of a forest. Down the long sward I\nsaw a procession of bright knights and ladies come riding on animals,\nsome black, some golden palomino, that looked for all the world like\nunicorns.\n\nMy eyes traveled upward to where the light of a great white sun flashed\non blue towers. And somewhere trumpets sounded.\n\n\"It looks like a pretty fair offer,\" I said. \"I'll take it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n                           A TRACE OF MEMORY\n\nHelp wanted: Soldier of fortune seeks companion in arms to share\nunusual adventure. Foster, Box 19.\n\nLegion was desperate--but not that desperate. Even petty larceny seemed\npreferable to that kind of proposal. But fate stepped in, and now he\nis on the run, pursued by cops, the CIA and a few not-so-friendly\nacquaintances of Foster. And Foster has lost his memory--not to mention\nabout thirty years of his age!\n\nThe key to Legion's dilemma, and to Foster's forgotten past, is in a\nrow of metal cylinders aboard a spaceship that has been orbiting Earth\nfor thousands of years. And Legion's troubles have really only begun....\n\n                     A Tom Doherty Associates Book\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Trace of Memory, by Keith Laumer\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A TRACE OF MEMORY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51712-8.txt or 51712-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/7/1/51712/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org\n\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
