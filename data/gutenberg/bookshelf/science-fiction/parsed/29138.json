So\n    startlingly original was his approach to the dark castles and\n    haunted woodlands of his own somber creation that he transcended the\n    literary by the sheer magic of his prose. Something of that same\n    magic gleams in the darkly-tapestried little fantasy presented here,\n    beneath Evelyn Smith's eerily enchanted wand._\n\n\n     the\n doorway\n\n _by ... Evelyn E. Smith_\n\n\n A man may wish he'd married his first love and not really mean\n it. But an insincere wish may turn ugly in dimensions unknown.\n\n\n\"It is my theory,\" Professor Falabella said, helping himself to a\ncookie, \"that no one ever really makes a decision. What really happens\nis that whenever alternative courses of action are called for, the\nindividuality splits up and continues on two or more divergent planes,\nvery much like the parthenogenesis of a unicellular animal ... Delicious\ncookies these, Mrs. Hughes.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Professor,\" Gloria simpered. \"I made them myself.\"\n\n\"You must give us the recipe,\" said one of the ladies--and the others\nmurmured agreement, glad to get their individualities on a plane they\ncould understand.\n\n\"Since most decisions are hardly as momentous as the individual\nimagines,\" Professor Falabella continued, \"and since the imagination of\nthe average individual is very limited, many of these different\nplanes--or, as they are colloquially known, space-time continuums--may\nexist in close, even tangential relationship.\"\n\nGloria rose unobtrusively and took the teapot to the kitchen for a\nrefill. Her husband stood by the sink moodily drinking whiskey out of\nthe bottle so as to avoid having to wash a glass afterward.\n\n\"Bill, you're not being polite to our guests. Why don't you go out and\nlisten to Professor Falabella?\"\n\n\"I can hear him perfectly well from here,\" Bill muttered--and indeed the\nprofessor's mellifluous tones pervaded every nook and cranny of the\nthin-walled house. \"Long-winded cultist! What is he a professor of, I'd\nlike to know.\"\n\n\"Professor Falabella is _not_ a cultist!\" affirmed Gloria angrily. \"He's\na great philosopher.\"\n\nBill Hughes said something unprintable. \"If I'd married Lucy Allison,\"\nhe continued unkindly, \"she'd never have filled the house with\nlong-haired cultists on my so-called day of rest.\"\n\nGloria's soft chin trembled, and her blue eyes filled with tears. She\nwas beginning to put on weight, he noticed. \"I've been hearing nothing\nbut Lucy Allison, Lucy Allison, Lucy Allison for the past year. Y-you\nsaid yourself she looked like a horse.\"\n\n\"Horses,\" he observed, \"have sense.\"\n\nHe was being brutal, but he couldn't help it and didn't want to.\nProfessor Falabella was only the most long-winded of a long series of\nmystics Gloria was forever dragging into the house. _The trouble with\nthe half-educated_, he thought bitterly, _is that they seek culture in\nthe most peculiar places_.\n\n\"I'll bet she would have let me have peace on Sunday,\" he said. \"It just\ngoes to show what happens when you marry a woman solely for her looks.\"\nHe drained the bottle; then hurled it into the garbage pail with a\nresounding crash.\n\nGloria's shoulders shook as she filled the kettle. \"I wish I'd decided\nto be an old maid,\" she sobbed.\n\nA very unlikely possibility, he thought. Even now, shopworn as she was,\nGloria could have a fairly wide range of suitors should something happen\nto him. She looked sexy, but how deceiving appearances could be!\n\nProfessor Falabella was still talking as Bill and Gloria emerged from\nthe kitchen. \"I believe that it is possible for an individual who exists\non a limited plane of imagination to transpose from one plane to an\nadjacent one without difficulty ... Great Heavens, what was that?\"\n\nSomething had whisked past the archway leading into the foyer.\n\n\"Don't pay any attention,\" Gloria smiled nervously. \"The house is\nhaunted.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" one of the ladies offered, \"I know of the most marvelous\nexterminator--\"\n\n\"The house,\" Gloria assured her coldly, \"really _is_ haunted. We've been\nseeing things ever since we moved in.\"\n\nAnd she really believed it, Bill thought. Believed that the house was\nhaunted, that is. Of course he had seen things too--but he was\nenlightened enough to know that ghosts don't exist, even if you do see\nthem.\n\nProfessor Falabella cleared his throat. \"As I was saying, it is possible\nto send the individual through another--well, dimension, as some popular\nwriters would have it, to one of his other spatial existences on the\nsame temporal plane. It is merely necessary for him to find the Door.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" Bill interrupted. \"Holy, unmitigated nonsense!\"\n\nEvery head swivelled to look at him. Gloria restrained tears with an\neffort.\n\n\"Brute,\" someone muttered.\n\nBut ridicule apparently only stimulated the professor. He beamed. \"You\ndon't believe me. Your imagination cannot extend to the comprehension of\nthe multifariousness of space.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Bill said again, but less confidently.\n\n\"I believe that I have discovered the Doorway,\" Professor Falabella\ncontinued, \"and the Way is Open. However, most people fear to penetrate\nthe unknown, even though it is to enter another phase of their own\nexistence. I do admit that the shock of spatial transference, no matter\nhow slight, combined with the concrete awareness of a previous spatial\nrelationship would be perhaps too much for the keenly sensitive\nindividualism ...\"\n\nBill opened his mouth.\n\n\"I know what you're about to say, young man!\"\n\n\"You don't have to be a mind reader to know that,\" Bill assured him. His\nconsonants were already a little slurred and he knew Gloria was ashamed\nof him. It served her right. He'd been ashamed of her for years.\n\nProfessor Falabella smiled. His teeth were very sharp and white. \"Very\nwell, Mr. Hughes, since you are a skeptic, perhaps you will not object\nto being the subject of our experiment yourself?\"\n\n\"What kind of an experiment?\" Bill asked suspiciously.\n\n\"Merely to go through the Door. Any door can become the Doorway, if it\nis transposed into the proper spatial dimension. That door, for\ninstance.\" Professor Falabella waved his hand toward the doorway of what\nGloria liked to call \"Bill's study.\"\n\n\"You mean you just want me to open the door and go into that room?\" Bill\nasked incredulously. \"That's all?\"\n\n\"That is all. Of course, you go with the awareness that it is the\nthreshold of another plane and that you step voluntarily from this\nexistence to an adjacent one.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Bill said. He had just remembered there was a nearly full bottle\nof Calvert in the bottom drawer of the desk. \"Sure. Anything to oblige.\"\n\n\"Very well. Go to the door, and keep remembering that of your own free\nwill you are passing from this plane to the next.\"\n\n\"Look out, everybody!\" Bill called raucously, as he pulled open the\ndoor. \"I'm coming in on the next plane!\"\n\nNo one laughed.\n\nHe stepped over the threshold, shutting the door firmly behind him. A\nwonderful excuse to get away from those blasted women. He'd climb out of\nthe window as soon as he'd collected the whiskey and give them a nervous\nmoment thinking he'd really passed into another existence. It would\nserve Gloria right.\n\nFor a moment, as he crossed, he had a queer sensation. Maybe there was\nsomething in what Professor Falabella said. But no, there he was in the\nstudy. All that mumbo jumbo was getting him down, that was all. He was a\nnervous man--only nobody appreciated the fact.\n\nTaking a cigarette out of the pack in his pocket, he reached for the\nlighter on his desk. It wasn't there. Time and time again he'd told\nGloria not to touch his things, and always she'd disobeyed him. Company\nwas coming and she must tidy up. Cooking and cleaning--that was all she\nwas good for. But this was carrying tidiness too far; she'd even removed\nthe ashtrays.\n\nAnd where did that glass block paperweight come from? He'd had a penguin\nin a snowstorm and he'd been happy with it. This was too much. He'd tell\nGloria off. Stealing a man's penguin!\n\nHe opened the door into the living room and bumped into Lucy Allison.\n\"Don't you think you've been in there long enough, Bill?\" she asked\nacridly. \"I'm sure your guests would appreciate catching a glimpse of\nyou.\"\n\n\"Why, hello, Lucy,\" he said, surprised. \"I didn't know Gloria had\ninvited you--\"\n\n\"Gloria, Gloria, Gloria!\" Lucy cut across his sentence. \"You've been\ntalking about nothing but that dumb little blonde for months.\" Because\nof the people in the room beyond, her voice was pitched low, but her\npale eyes glittered unpleasantly behind her spectacles. \"I wish you had\nmarried her. You'd have made a fine pair.\"\n\nGently, caressingly, the short hairs on the back of Bill's neck rose.\n\n\"Come back in here,\" Lucy said, hauling him back into the living room\nwhere a number of people who had been enjoying the domestic fracas\nsuddenly broke into loud and animated chatter. \"Dr. Hildebrand was\ntelling us all about nuclear fission.\"\n\n\"Can't find an ashtray,\" Bill muttered, seizing on something tangible.\n\"Can't find an ashtray in the whole darn place.\"\n\n\"We've been over this millions of times, Bill. You know--\" she smiled at\nthe guests, a smile that carefully excluded Bill. \"--I'm allergic to\nsmoke, but I never can get my husband to remember he isn't to smoke\ninside the house.\"\n\n\"Now take the neutron, for example,\" Dr. Hildebrand said through a\nmouthful of p\u00e2t\u00e9. \"What is the neutron? It is only ... What was that?\"\n\nThe wraith of Gloria crossed the foyer and disappeared. Bill took a step\nforward; then stood still.\n\nLucy smiled self-consciously. \"That's nothing at all. The house is\nmerely haunted.\"\n\nEveryone laughed.\n\n\"Forgot something,\" Bill muttered, and dashed back into the study. He\nyanked open the bottom drawer of the desk. Sure enough, there was a\nbottle of Schenley, nearly a third full. \"There are some advantages,\" he\nthought as he tilted it to his lips, \"in having a limited imagination.\"\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ September 1955.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
