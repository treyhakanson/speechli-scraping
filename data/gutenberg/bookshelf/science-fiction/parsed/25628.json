He looked out the windows at the gigantic sea of\nemptiness around him and wondered again what the danger had been that\nhad so terrified the men before him.\n\nOf one thing he was already certain; he would find that nothing was\nwaiting outside the bubble to kill him. The first bubble attendant had\ncommitted suicide and the second was a mindless maniac on the Earthbound\ncruiser but it must have been something inside the bubble that had\ncaused it. Or else they had imagined it all.\n\nHe went across the small room, his magnetized soles loud on the thin\nmetal floor in the bubble's silence. He sat down in the single chair,\nhis weight very slight in the feeble artificial gravity, and reviewed\nthe known facts.\n\nThe bubble was a project of Earth's Galactic Observation Bureau,\npositioned there to gather data from observations that could not be made\nfrom within the galaxy. Since metallic mass affected the hypersensitive\ninstruments the bubble had been made as small and light as possible. It\nwas for that reason that it could accommodate only one attendant.\n\nThe Bureau had selected Horne as the bubble's first attendant and the\ncruiser left him there for his six months' period of duty. When it made\nits scheduled return with his replacement he was found dead from a\ntremendous overdose of sleeping pills. On the table was his daily-report\nlog and his last entry, made three months before:\n\n_I haven't attended to the instruments for a long time because it hates\nus and doesn't want us here. It hates me the most of all and keeps\ntrying to get into the bubble to kill me. I can hear it whenever I stop\nand listen and I know it won't be long. I'm afraid of it and I want to\nbe asleep when it comes. But I'll have to make it soon because I have\nonly twenty sleeping pills left and if--_\n\nThe sentence was never finished. According to the temperature recording\ninstruments in the bubble his body ceased radiating heat that same\nnight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bubble was cleaned, fumigated, and inspected inside and out. No sign\nof any inimical entity or force could be found.\n\nSilverman was Horne's replacement. When the cruiser returned six months\nlater bringing him, Green, to be Silverman's replacement, Silverman was\ncompletely insane. He babbled about something that had been waiting\noutside the bubble to kill him but his nearest to a rational statement\nwas to say once, when asked for the hundredth time what he had seen:\n\n\"Nothing--you can't really see it. But you feel it watching you and you\nhear it trying to get in to kill you. One time I bumped the wall\nand--for God's sake--take me away from it--take me back to Earth ...\"\n\nThen he had tried to hide under the captain's desk and the ship's doctor\nhad led him away.\n\nThe bubble was minutely examined again and the cruiser employed every\ndetector device it possessed to search surrounding space for light-years\nin all directions. Nothing was found.\n\nWhen it was time for the new replacement to be transferred to the bubble\nhe reported to Captain McDowell.\n\n\"Everything is ready, Green,\" McDowell said. \"You are the next one.\" His\nshaggy gray eyebrows met in a scowl. \"It would be better if they would\nlet me select the replacement instead of them.\"\n\nHe flushed with a touch of resentment and said, \"The Bureau found my\nintelligence and initiative of thought satisfactory.\"\n\n\"I know--the characteristics you don't need. What they ought to have is\nsomebody like one of my engine room roustabouts, too ignorant to get\nscared and too dumb to go nuts. Then we could get a sane report six\nmonths from now instead of the ravings of a maniac.\"\n\n\"I suggest,\" he said stiffly, \"that you reserve judgement until that\ntime comes, sir.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd that was all he knew about the danger, real or imaginary, that had\ndriven two men into insanity. He would have six months in which to find\nthe answer. Six months minus-- He looked at the chronometer and saw that\ntwenty minutes had passed since he left the cruiser. Somehow, it seemed\nmuch longer ...\n\nHe moved to light a cigarette and his metal soles scraped the floor with\nthe same startling loudness he had noticed before. The bubble was as\nsilent as a tomb.\n\nIt was not much larger than a tomb; a sphere eighteen feet in diameter,\nmade of thin sheet steel and criss-crossed outside with narrow\nreinforcing girders to keep the internal air pressure from rupturing it.\nThe floor under him was six feet up from the sphere's bottom and the\nspace beneath held the air regenerator and waste converter units, the\nstorage batteries and the food cabinets. The compartment in which he sat\ncontained chair, table, a narrow cot, banks of dials, a remote-control\npanel for operating the instruments mounted outside the hull, a\nmicrofilm projector, and a pair of exerciser springs attached to one\nwall. That was all.\n\nThere was no means of communication since a hyperspace communicator\nwould have affected the delicate instruments with its radiations but\nthere was a small microfilm library to go with the projector so that he\nshould be able to pass away the time pleasantly enough.\n\nBut it was not the fear of boredom that was behind the apprehension he\ncould already feel touching at his mind. It had not been boredom that\nhad turned Horne into a suicide and Silverman into--\n\nSomething cracked sharply behind him, like a gunshot in the stillness,\nand he leaped to his feet, whirling to face it.\n\nIt was only a metal reel of data tape that had dropped out of the\nspectrum analyzer into the storage tray.\n\nHis heart was thumping fast and his attempt to laugh at his nervousness\nsounded hollow and mirthless. _Something_ inside or outside the bubble\nhad driven two men insane with its threat and now that he was\nirrevocably exiled in the bubble, himself, he could no longer dismiss\ntheir fear as products of their imagination. Both of them had been\nrational, intelligent men, as carefully selected by the Observation\nBureau as he had been.\n\nHe set in to search the bubble, overlooking nothing. When he crawled\ndown into the lower compartment he hesitated then opened the longest\nblade of his knife before searching among the dark recesses down there.\nHe found nothing, not even a speck of dust.\n\nBack in his chair again he began to doubt his first conviction. Perhaps\nthere really had been some kind of an invisible force or entity outside\nthe bubble. Both Horne and Silverman had said that \"it\" had tried to get\nin to kill them.\n\nThey had been very definite about that part.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were six windows around the bubble's walls, set there to enable\nthe attendant to see all the outside-mounted instruments and dials. He\nwent to them to look out, one by one, and from all of them he saw the\nsame vast emptiness that surrounded him. The galaxy--his galaxy--was so\nfar away that its stars were like dust. In the other directions the\nempty gulf was so wide that galaxies and clusters of galaxies were tiny,\nfeeble specks of light shining across it.\n\nAll around him was a void so huge that galaxies were only specks in\nit....\n\nWho could know what forces or dangers might be waiting out there?\n\nA light blinked, reminding him it was time to attend to his duties. The\njob required an hour and he was nervous and not yet hungry when he had\nfinished. He went to the exerciser springs on the wall and performed a\nwork-out that left him tired and sweating but which, at least, gave him\na small appetite.\n\nThe day passed, and the next. He made another search of the bubble's\ninterior with the same results as before. He felt almost sure, then,\nthat there was nothing in the bubble with him. He established a routine\nof work, pastime and sleep that made the first week pass fairly\ncomfortably but for the gnawing worry in his mind that something\ninvisible was lurking just outside the windows.\n\nThen one day he accidentally kicked the wall with his metal shoe tip.\n\nIt made a sound like that from kicking a tight-stretched section of tin\nand it seemed to him it gave a little from the impact, as tin would do.\nHe realized for the first time how thin it was--how deadly, dangerously\nthin.\n\nAccording to the specifications he had read it was only one-sixteenth of\nan inch thick. It was as thin as cardboard.\n\nHe sat down with pencil and paper and began calculating. The bubble had\na surface area of 146,500 square inches and the internal air pressure\nwas fourteen pounds to the square inch. Which meant that the thin metal\nskin contained a total pressure of 2,051,000 pounds.\n\nTwo million pounds.\n\nThe bubble in which he sat was a bomb, waiting to explode the instant\nany section of the thin metal weakened.\n\nIt was supposed to be an alloy so extremely strong that it had a high\nsafety factor but he could not believe that any metal so thin could be\nso strong. It was all right for engineers sitting safely on Earth to\nspeak of high safety factors but his life depended upon the fragile wall\nnot cracking. It made a lot of difference.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next day he thought he felt the hook to which the exerciser spring\nwas attached crack loose from where it was welded to the wall. He\ninspected the base of the hook closely and there seemed to be a fine,\nhairline fracture appearing around it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe held his ear to it, listening for any sound of a leak. It was not\nleaking yet but it could commence doing so at any time. He looked out\nthe windows at the illimitable void that was waiting to absorb his\npitiful little supply of air and he thought of the days he had hauled\nand jerked at the springs with all his strength, not realizing the\ndamage he was doing.\n\nThere was a sick feeling in his stomach for the rest of the day and he\nreturned again and again to examine the hairline around the hook.\n\nThe next day he discovered an even more serious threat: the thin skin of\nthe bubble had been spot-welded to the outside reinforcing girders.\n\nSuch welding often created hard, brittle spots that would soon\ncrystallize from continued movement--and there was a slight temperature\ndifference in the bubble between his working and sleeping hours that\nwould daily produce a contraction and expansion of the skin. Especially\nwhen he used the little cooking burner.\n\nHe quit using the burner for any purpose and began a daily inspection of\nevery square inch of the bubble's walls, marking with white chalk all\nthe welding spots that appeared to be definitely weakened. Each day he\nfound more to mark and soon the little white circles were scattered\nacross the walls wherever he looked.\n\nWhen he was not working at examining the walls he could feel the windows\nwatching him, like staring eyes. Out of self defense he would have to go\nto them and stare back at the emptiness.\n\nSpace was alien; coldly, deadly, alien. He was a tiny spark of life in a\nhostile sea of Nothing and there was no one to help him. The Nothing\noutside was waiting day and night for the most infinitesimal leak or\ncrack in the walls; the Nothing that had been waiting out there since\ntime without beginning and would wait for time without end.\n\nSometimes he would touch his finger to the wall and think, _Death is out\nthere, only one-sixteenth of an inch away_. His first fears became a\nblack and terrible conviction: the bubble could not continue to resist\nthe attack for long. It had already lasted longer than it should have.\nTwo million pounds of pressure wanted out and all the sucking Nothing of\nintergalactic space wanted in. And only a thin skin of metal, rotten\nwith brittle welding spots, stood between them.\n\nIt wanted in--the Nothing wanted in. He knew, then, that Horne and\nSilverman had not been insane. It wanted in and someday it would get in.\nWhen it did it would explode him and jerk out his guts and lungs. Not\nuntil that happened, not until the Nothing filled the bubble and\nenclosed his hideous, turned-inside-out body would it ever be content ...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had long since quit wearing the magnetized shoes, afraid the\nvibration of them would weaken the bubble still more. And he began\nnoticing sections where the bubble did not seem to be perfectly concave,\nas though the rolling mill had pressed the metal too thin in places and\nit was swelling out like an over-inflated balloon.\n\nHe could not remember when he had last attended to the instruments.\nNothing was important but the danger that surrounded him. He knew the\ndanger was rapidly increasing because whenever he pressed his ear to the\nwall he could hear the almost inaudible tickings and vibrations as the\nbubble's skin contracted or expanded and the Nothing tapped and searched\nwith its empty fingers for a flaw or crack that it could tear into a\nleak.\n\nBut the windows were far the worst, with the Nothing staring in at him\nday and night. There was no escape from it. He could feel it watching\nhim, malignant and gloating, even when he hid his eyes in his hands.\n\nThe time came when he could stand it no longer. The cot had a blanket\nand he used that together with all his spare clothes to make a tent\nstretching from the table to the first instrument panel. When he crawled\nunder it he found that the lower half of one window could still see him.\nHe used the clothes he was wearing to finish the job and it was much\nbetter then, hiding there in the concealing darkness where the Nothing\ncould not see him.\n\nHe did not mind going naked--the temperature regulators in the bubble\nnever let it get too cold.\n\nHe had no conception of time from then on. He emerged only when\nnecessary to bring more food into his tent. He could still hear the\nNothing tapping and sucking in its ceaseless search for a flaw and he\nmade such emergences as brief as possible, wishing that he did not have\nto come out at all. Maybe if he could hide in his tent for a long time\nand never make a sound it would get tired and go away ...\n\nSometimes he thought of the cruiser and wished they would come for him\nbut most of the time he thought of the thing that was outside, trying to\nget in to kill him. When the strain became too great he would draw\nhimself up in the position he had once occupied in his mother's womb and\npretend he had never left Earth. It was easier there.\n\nBut always, before very long, the bubble would tick or whisper and he\nwould freeze in terror, thinking, _This time it's coming in ..._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen one day, suddenly, two men were peering under his tent at him.\n\nOne of them said, \"My God--_again!_\" and he wondered what he meant. But\nthey were very nice to him and helped him put on his clothes. Later, in\nthe cruiser, everything was hazy and they kept asking him what he was\nafraid of.\n\n\"What was it--what did you find?\"\n\nHe tried hard to think so he could explain it. \"It was--it was Nothing.\"\n\n\"What were you and Horne and Silverman afraid of--what was it?\" the\nvoice demanded insistently.\n\n\"I told you,\" he said. \"Nothing.\"\n\nThey stared at him and the haziness cleared a little as he saw they did\nnot understand. He wanted them to believe him because what he told them\nwas so very true.\n\n\"It wanted to kill us. Please--can't you believe me? It was waiting\noutside the bubble to kill us.\"\n\nBut they kept staring and he knew they didn't believe him. They didn't\n_want_ to believe him ...\n\nEverything turned hazy again and he started to cry. He was glad when the\ndoctor took his hand to lead him away ...\n\nThe bubble was carefully inspected, inside and out, and nothing was\nfound. When it was time for Green's replacement to be transferred to it\nLarkin reported to Captain McDowell.\n\n\"Everything is ready, Larkin,\" McDowell said. \"You're the next one. I\nwish we knew what the danger is.\" He scowled. \"I still think one of my\nroustabouts from the engine room might give us a sane report six months\nfrom now instead of the babblings we'll get from you.\"\n\nHe felt his face flush and he said stiffly, \"I suggest, sir, that you\nnot jump to conclusions until that time comes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cruiser vanished back into hyperspace and he was alone inside the\nobservation bubble, ten thousand light-years beyond the galaxy's\noutermost sun. He looked out the windows at the gigantic sea of\nemptiness around him and wondered again what the danger had been that\nhad so terrified the men before him.\n\nOf one thing he was already certain; he would find that nothing was\nwaiting outside the bubble to kill him ...\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Amazing Stories_ December 1957.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
