Carr\n\n\nWith the publication of this novel, _Uller Uprising_, all of H. Beam\nPiper's previously published science fiction is now available in Ace\neditions. _Uller Uprising_ was first published in 1952 in a Twayne\nScience Fiction Triplet--a hardbound collection of three thematically\nconnected novels. (The other two were Judith Merril's _Daughters of\nEarth_ and Fletcher Pratt's _The Long View_.) A year later it appeared\nin the February and March issues of _Space Science Fiction_, edited by\nLester Del Rey.\n\nThe magazine version, which was abridged by about a third, was\nbelieved by many bibliographers to be the only version--and as a\nnovella it was too short for book publication. The Twayne version had\na small print run and is so scarce that few people have seen it. Those\nbibliographers who knew of its existence assumed that both versions of\n_Uller_ were the same. It was through a telephone conversation with\nCharles N. Brown, publisher of _Locus_ and correspondent with Piper,\nthat I learned about the Twayne edition and its greater length. Brown\nallowed me to photocopy his original, for which we owe him a debt of\nthanks; because the Twayne version is not only novel length, but far\nbetter than the shorter one that appeared in _Space Science Fiction_.\n\nProbably the most surprising and interesting thing about the Twayne\nedition is the essay that forms the introduction to that volume, and\nis reprinted here. The essay is by Dr. John D. Clark, an eminent\nscientist of the fourties and fifties and one of the discoverers of\nsulfa, the first \"miracle drug.\" It describes in great detail the\nplanetary system of the star Beta Hydri, and gives the names of those\nplanets: Uller and Niflheim. A publisher's note states that Clark's\nessay was written first, and given to the contributors as background\nmaterial for a novel they would then write.\n\nThe fans of H. Beam Piper seem to owe a great debt to Dr. Clark.\n_Uller Uprising_ became the foundation of Piper's monumental\nTerro-Human Future History; the first story where we encounter the\nTerran Federation. In it we learn about Odin, the planet that will one\nday be the capital of the First Galactic Empire; and humble Niflheim,\nwhich in more decadent times will become a common expletive, a word\nmeaning hell. This is also where Piper introduced and explained the\nAtomic Era dating system (A.E.). _Uller Uprising_ is set in the early\nyears of the Terran Federation's expansion and exploration, an epoch\nof great vitality. In \"The Edge of the Knife\" Piper compares this time\nof discovery to the Spanish conquest of the Americas. This feeling of\nvigor and unlimited possibilities runs through all the early\nFederation stories: _Uller Uprising_, \"Omnilingual,\" \"Naudsonce,\"\n\"When in the Course--,\" and, to a lesser degree, in the late\nFederation novels, _Little Fuzzy_, _Fuzzy Sapiens_, and _Fuzzies and\nOther People_. (See _Federation_ by H. Beam Piper for a good overview\nof this period.)\n\nIn these stories we see Terro-Humans at their best and at their worst:\nIndividual heroism and bravery in the face of grave danger in _Uller\nUprising_; Federation law and justice in _Little Fuzzy_ and its\nsequels; and, in \"Omnilingual\" and \"Naudsonce,\" the spirit of science\nand rational inquiry. Yet we also see colonial exploitation and\nsubjugation in _Uller Uprising_ and \"Oomphel in the Sky,\" the greed\nand corruption of Chartered land companies in _Little Fuzzy_, and\npolitical corruption in _Four-Day Planet_. These stories are about a\nliving Terro-Human culture, not a utopia.\n\nIt was Piper's attention to historical realism and his use of actual\nhistorical models that have helped his work to pass the test of time\nand have led to his becoming the favorite of a new generation of\nreaders more than twenty-five years after his death.\n\n_Uller Uprising_ is the story of a confrontation between a human\noverlord and alien servants, with an ironic twist at the end. Like\nmost of Piper's best work, _Uller Uprising_ is modeled after an actual\nevent in human history; in this case the Sepoy Mutiny (a Bengal\nuprising in British-held India brought about when rumors were spread\nto native soldiers that cartridges being issued by the British were\ncoated with animal fat. The rebellion quickly spread throughout India\nand led to the massacre of the British Colony at Cawnpore.). Piper's\nnovel is not a mere retelling of the Indian Mutiny, but rather an\nanalysis of an historical event applied to a similar situation in the\nfar future.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLike many philosophers and social theorists before him, Piper\nattempted to chart the progress of human-kind; unlike most, however,\nhe did not envision or try to create a system of ethics that would end\nall of humanity's problems. The best he could offer was his model of\nthe self-reliant man: The man who \"actually knows what has to be done\nand how to do it, and he's going to go right ahead and do it, without\nholding a dozen conferences and round-table discussions and giving\neverybody a fair and equal chance to foul things up for him.\"\n\nPiper brought his own ideas and judgments about society and history\ninto all of his work, but they appear most clearly in his Terro-Human\nFuture History. While not everyone will agree with Piper's theories\nthey give his work a bite that most popular fiction lacks. One cannot\nread Piper complacently. And one can often find a wry insight\nsandwiched in between the blood and thunder.\n\nOther future histories may span more centuries or better illuminate\nthe highlights of several decades, but until a rival is created with\nmore historical depth and attention to detail, H. Beam Piper's\nTerro-Human Future History will stand as the Bayeux Tapestry of\nscience fiction histories.\n\nIn many ways--certainly during his lifetime--Piper was the most\nunderrated of the John W. Campbell's \"Astounding\" writers. He was\nprobably also the most Campbellian; his _self-reliant man_ is almost a\nmirror image of Campbell's \"Citizen.\"\n\nPiper died a bitter man, a failure in his own mind; shortly before his\ndeath he believed he could no longer earn a living as a writer without\ncharity from his friends or the state.\n\nNow he's the cornerstone of Ace Books. Had he lived long enough to\nfinish another half dozen books, he would have been among the sf\ngreats of the sixties....\n\nBut maybe he does know, after all. Jerry Pournelle, who was very much\ninfluenced by Piper and in many ways considers himself Beam's\nspiritual descendant--and incidently was John W. Campbell's last major\n_discovery_--has said that sometimes, when he's gotten down a\nparticularly good line, he can hear the \"old man\" chuckle and whisper,\n_atta boy_.\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nDr. John D. Clark\n\nTHE SILICONE WORLD\n\n\n1. THE STAR AND ITS MOST IMPORTANT PLANET\n\nThe planet is named Uller (it seems that when interstellar travel was\ndeveloped, the names of Greek Gods had been used up, so those of Norse\ngods were used). It is the second planet of the star Beta Hydri, right\nangle 0:23, declension-77:32, G-0 (solar) type star, of approximately\nthe same size as Sol; distance from Earth, 21 light years.\n\nUller revolves around it in a nearly circular orbit, at a distance of\n100,000,000 miles, making it a little colder than Earth. A year is of\nthe approximate length of that on Earth. A day lasts 26 hours.\n\nThe axis of Uller is in the same plane as the orbit, so that at a\ncertain time of the year the north pole is pointed directly at the\nsun, while at the opposite end of the orbit it points directly away.\nThe result is highly exaggerated seasons. At the poles the temperature\nruns from 120\u00b0C to a low of-80\u00b0C. At the equator it remains not far\nfrom 10\u00b0C all year round. Strong winds blow during the summer and\nwinter, from the hot to the cold pole; few winds during the spring and\nfall. The appearance of the poles varies during the year from baked\ndeserts to glaciers covered with solid CO_{2}. Free water exists in\nthe equatorial regions all year round.\n\n\n2. SOLAR MOVEMENT AS SEEN FROM ULLER\n\nAs seen from the north pole--no sun is visible on Jan. 1. On April 1,\nit bisects the horizon all day, swinging completely around. April 1 to\nJuly 1, it continues swinging around, gradually rising in the sky, the\nspiral converging to its center at the zenith, which it reaches July\n1. From July 1 to October 1 the spiral starts again, spreading out\nfrom the center until on October 1 it bisects the horizon again. On\nOctober 1 night arrives to stay until April 1.\n\nAt the equator, the sun is visible bisecting the southern horizon for\nall 26 hours of the day on January 1. From January 1 to April 1, the\nsun starts to dip below the horizon at night, to rise higher above it\nduring the day. During all this time it rises and sets at the same\nhours, but rises in the southeast and sets in the southwest. At noon\nit is higher each day in the southern sky until April 1, when it rises\ndue east, passes through the zenith and sets due west. From April 1 to\nJuly 1, its noon position drops down to the north, until on July 1, it\nis visible all day, bisected by the northern horizon.\n\n\n3. CHEMISTRY AND GEOLOGY OF ULLER\n\nCalcium and chlorine are rarer than on earth, sodium is somewhat\ncommoner. As a result of the shortage of calcium there is a higher\nration of silicates to carbonates than exists on earth. The water is\nslightly alkaline and resembles a very dilute solution of sodium\nsilicate (water glass). It would have a pH of 8.5 and tastes slightly\nsoapy. Also, when it dries out it leaves a sticky, and then a glassy,\ncrackly film. Rocks look fairly earthlike, but the absence or scarcity\nof anything like limestone is noticeable. Practically all the\nsedimentary rocks are of the sandstone type.\n\nAll rivers are seasonal, running from the polar regions to the central\nseas in the spring only, or until the polar cap is completely dried\nout.\n\n\n4. ANIMAL LIFE\n\nAs on Earth life arose in the primitive waters and with a carbon base,\nbut because of the abundance of silicone, there was a strong tendency\nfor the microscopic organisms to develop silicate exoskeletons, like\ndiatoms. The present invertebrate animal life of the planet is of this\ntype and is confined to the equatorial seas. They run from amoeba-like\nobjects to things like crayfish, with silicate skeletons. Later, some\nspecies of them started taking silicone into their soft tissues, and\neventually their carbon-chain compounds were converted to silicone\ntype chains, from\n\n  |  |  |         |   |  |   |  |\n--C--C--C-- to O--Si--O--Si--O--Si,\n  |  |  |         |   |  |   |  |\n\nwith organic radicals on the side links. These organisms were a\ntransitional type, with silicone tissues and water body fluids,\nresembling the earthly amphibians, and are now practically extinct.\nThere are a few species, something like segmented worms, still to be\nseen in the backwaters of the central seas.\n\nA further development occurred when the silicone chain animals began\nto get short-chain silicones into their circulatory systems, held in\nsolution by OH or NH_{2} groups on the ends and branches of the\nchains. The proportion of these compounds gradually increased until\nthe water was a minor and then a missing constituent. The larger\nmobile species were, then, practically anhydrous. Their blood consists\nof short-chain silicones, with quartz reinforcing for the soft parts\nand their armor, teeth, etc., of pure amorphous quartz (opal). Most of\nthese parts are of the milky variety, variously tinted with metallic\nimpurities, as are the varieties of sapphires.\n\nThese pure silicone animals, due to their practical indestructibility,\nannihilated all but the smaller of the carbon animals, and drove the\ncompromise types into odd corners as relics. They developed into a\nfish-like animal with a very large swim-bladder to compensate for the\nrather higher density of the silicone tissues, and from these fish the\nland animals developed. Due to their high density and resulting high\nweight, they tend to be low on the ground, rather reptilian in look.\nThree pairs of legs are usual in order to distribute the heavy load.\nThere is no sharp dividing line between the quartz armor and the\nsilicone tissue. One merges into the other.\n\nThe dominant pure silicone animals only could become mobile and\nventure far from the temperate equatorial regions of Uller, since they\nneither froze nor stiffened with cold, nor became incapacitated by\nheat. Note that all animal life is cold-blooded, with a negligible\ndifference between body and ambient temperatures. Since the animals\nare silicones, they don't get sluggish like cold snakes.\n\n\n5. PLANT LIFE\n\nThe plants are of the carbon-metabolism, silicate-shell type, like the\nprimitive animals. They spread out from the equator as far as they\ncould go before the baking polar summers killed them. They have normal\nseasonal growth in the temperate zones and remain dormant and frozen\nin the winter. At the poles there is no vegetation, not because of the\ncold winter, but because of the hot summer. The winter winds\nfrequently blow over dead trees and roll them as far as the equatorial\nseas. Other dead vegetation, because of the highly silicious water,\nalways gets petrified unless it is eaten first. What with the\nquartz-speckled hides of the living vegetation and the solid quartz of\nthe dead, a forest is spectacular.\n\nThe silicone animals live on the plants. They chew them up, dehydrate\nthem, and convert their silicious outer bark and carbonaceous\ninteriors into silicones for themselves. When silicone tissue is\nmetabolized, the carbon and hydrogen go to CO_{2} and H_{2}O, which\nare breathed out, while the silicone goes into SiO_{2}, which is\ndeposited as more teeth and armor. (Compare the terrestrial octopus,\nwhich makes armor-plating out of calcium urate instead of excreting\nurea or uric acid.) The animals can, of course, eat each other too, or\nmake a meal of the small carbonaceous animals of the equatorial seas.\n\nFurther note that the animals cannot digest plants when they are cold.\nThey can eat them and store them, but the disposal of the solid water\nand CO_{2} is too difficult a problem. When they warm up, the water in\nthe plants melts and can be disposed of, and things are simpler.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE FLUORINE PLANET\n\n1. THE STAR AND PLANET\n\n\nThe planet named Niflheim is the fourth planet of Nu Puppis, right\nangle 6:36, declension-43:09; B8 type star, blue-white and hot, 148\nlight years distant from Earth, which will require a speed in excess\nof light to reach it.\n\nNiflheim is 462,000,000 miles from its primary, a little less than the\ndistance of Jupiter from our sun. It thus does not receive too great a\ntotal amount of energy, but what it does receive is of high potential,\na large fraction of it being in the ultra-violet and higher\nfrequencies. (Watch out for really super-special sunburn, etc., on\nunwarned personnel.)\n\nThe gravity of Niflheim is approximately 1 g, the atmospheric pressure\napproximately 1 atmosphere, and the average ambient temperature\nabout-60\u00b0C;-76\u00b0F.\n\n\n2. ATMOSPHERE\n\nThe oxidizer in the atmosphere is free fluorine (F_{2}) in a rather\nlow concentration, about 4 or 5 percent. With it appears a mad\ncollection of gases. There are a few inert diluents, such as N_{2}\n(nitrogen), argon, helium, neon, etc., but the major fraction consists\nof CF_{4} (carbon tetrafluoride), BF_{3} (boron trifluoride), SiF_{4}\n(silicon tetrafluoride), PF_{5} (phosphorous pentafluoride), SF_{6}\n(sulphur hexafluoride) and probably others. In other words, the\nfluorides of all the non-metals that can form fluorides. The\nphosphorous pentafluoride rains out when the weather gets cold. There\nis also free oxygen, but no chlorine. That would be liquid except in\nvery hot weather. It sometimes appears combined with fluorine in\nchlorine trifluoride. The atmosphere has a slight yellowish tinge.\n\n\n3. SOIL AND GEOLOGY\n\nAbove the metallic core of the planet, the lithosphere consists\nexclusively of fluorides of the metals. There are no oxides, sulfides,\nsilicates or chlorides. There are small deposits of such things as\nbromine trifluoride, but these have no great importance. Since\nfluorides are weak mechanically, the terrain is flattish. Nothing\ntough like granite to build mountains out of. Since the fluoride ion\nis colorless, the color of the soil depends upon the predominant metal\nin the region. As most of the light metals also have colorless ions,\nthe colored rocks are rather rare.\n\n\n4. THE WATERS UNDER THE EARTH\n\nThey consist of liquid hydrofluoric acid (HF). It melts at-83\u00b0C and\nboils at 19.4\u00b0C. In it are dissolved varying quantities of metallic\nand non-metallic fluorides, such as boron trifluoride, sodium\nfluoride, etc. When the oceans and lakes freeze, they do so from the\nbottom up, so there is no layer of ice over free liquid.\n\n\n5. PLANTS AND PLANT METABOLISM\n\nThe plants function by photosynthesis, taking HF as water from the\nsoil, and carbon tetrafluoride as the equivalent of carbon dioxide\nfrom the air to produce chain compounds, such as:\n\n  H  H  H  H\n  |  |  |  |\n--C--C--C--C--\n  |  |  |  |\n  F  F  F  F\n\nand at the same time liberating free fluorine. This reaction could\nonly take place on a planet receiving lots of ultra-violet because so\nmuch energy is needed to break up carbon tetrafluoride and\nhydrofluoric acid. The plant catalyst (doubling for the magnesium in\nchlorophyll) is nickel. The plants are colored in various ways. They\nget their metals from the soil.\n\n\n6. ANIMALS AND ANIMAL METABOLISM\n\nAnimals depend upon two main reactions for their energy, and for the\nconstruction of their harder tissues. The soft tissues are about the\nsame as the plant molecules, but the hard tissues are produced by the\nreaction:\n\n  H  H  H                 F  F  F\n  |  |  |                 |  |  |\n--C--C--C-- + F_{2} --> --C--C--C-- + HF\n  |  |  |                 |  |  |\n  F  F  F                 F  F  F\n\nresulting in a teflon boned and shelled organism. He's going to be\ntough to do much with. Diatoms leave strata of powdered teflon. The\nmain energy reaction is:\n\n  H  H  H\n  |  |  |\n--C--C--C-- ... + F_{2} --> CF_{4} + HF\n  |  |  |\n  F  F  F\n\nThe blood catalyst metal is titanium, which results in colorless\narterial blood and violet veinous, as the titanium flips back and\nforth between tri and tetra-valent states.\n\n\n7. EFFECT ON INTRUDING ITEMS\n\nWater decomposes into oxygen and hydrofluoric acid. All organic matter\n(earth type) converts into oxygen, carbon tetrafluoride, hydrofluoric\nacid, etc., with more or less speed. A rubber gas mask lasts about an\nhour. Glass first frosts and then disappears. Plastics act like\nrubber, only a little slower. The heavy metals, iron, nickel, copper,\nmonel, etc., stand up well, forming an insoluble coat of fluorides at\nfirst and then doing nothing else.\n\n\n8. WHY GO THERE?\n\nLarge natural crystals of fluorides, such as calcium difluoride,\ntitanium tetrafluoride, zirconium tetrafluoride, are extremely useful\nin optical instruments of various forms. Uranium appears as uranium\nhexafluoride, all ready for the diffusion process. Compounds of such\nnon-metals as boron are obtainable from the atmosphere in high purity\nwith very little trouble. All metallurgy must be electrical. There are\nconsiderable deposits of beryllium, and they occur in high\nconcentration in its ores.\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nOn Satan's Footstool\n\n\nThe big armor-tender vibrated, gently and not unpleasantly, as the\ncontragravity field alternated on and off, occasionally varying its\nnormal rate of five hundred to the second when some thermal updraft\nlifted the vehicle and the automatic radar-altimeter control acted to\nalter the frequency and lower it again. Sometimes it rocked slightly,\nlike a boat on the water, and, in the big screen which served in lieu\nof a window at the front of the control cabin, the dingy-yellow\nlandscape would seem to tilt a little. If unshielded human eyes could\nhave endured the rays of Nu Puppis, Niflheim's primary, the whole scene\nwould have appeared a vivid Saint Patrick's Day green, the effect of\nthe blue-predominant light on the yellow atmosphere. The outside\n'visor-pickup, however, was fitted with filters which blocked out the\ngamma-rays and X-rays and most of the ultra-violet-rays, and added the\nlonger light-waves of red and orange which were absent, so that things\nlooked much as they would have under the light of a G0-type star like\nSol. The air was faintly yellow, the sky was yellow with a greenish\ncast, and the clouds were green-gray.\n\nA thousand feet below, the local equivalent of a forest grew, the\ntrees, topped with huge ragged leaves, looking like hundred-foot\nstalks of celery. There would be animal life down there, too--little\nround things, four inches across, like eight-legged crabs, gnawing at\nthe vegetation, and bigger things, two feet long, with articulated\nshell-armor and sixteen legs, which fed on the smaller herbivores.\nBeyond, in the middleground, was open grassland, if one could so call\na mat of wormlike colorless or pastel-tinted sprouts, and a river\nmeandered through it. On the skyline, fifty miles away, was a range of\nlow dunes and hills, none more than a thousand feet high.\n\nNo human had ever set foot on the surface, or breathed the air, of\nNiflheim. To have done so would have been instant death; the air was a\nmixture of free fluorine and fluoride gasses, the soil was metallic\nfluorides, damp with acid rains, and the river was pure hydrofluoric\nacid. Even the ordinary spacesuit would have been no protection; the\nglass and rubber and plastic would have disintegrated in a matter of\nminutes. People came to Niflheim, and worked the mines and uranium\nrefineries and chemical plants, but they did so inside power-driven\nand contragravity-lifted armor, and they lived on artificial\nsatellites two thousand miles off-planet. This vehicle, for instance,\nwas built and protected as no spaceship ever had to be, completely\ninsulated and entered only through a triple airlock--an outer lock,\nwhich would be evacuated outward after it was closed, a middle lock\nkept evacuated at all times, and an inner lock, evacuated into the\ninterior of the vehicle before the middle lock could be opened.\nNiflheim was worse than airless, much worse.\n\nThe chief engineer sat at his controls, making the minor lateral\nadjustments in the vehicle's position which were not possible to the\nautomatic controls. One of the radiomen was receiving from the orbital\nbase; the other was saying, over and over, in an exasperatedly\npatient voice: \"Dr. Murillo. Dr. Murillo. Please come in, Dr.\nMurillo.\" At his own panel of instruments, a small man with grizzled\nblack hair around a bald crown, and a grizzled beard, chewed nervously\nat the stump of a dead cigar and listened intently to what was--or for\nwhat wasn't--coming in to his headset receiver. A couple of assistants\nchecked dials and refreshed their memories from notebooks and peered\nanxiously into the big screen. A large, plump-faced, young man in\nsoiled khaki shirt and shorts, with extremely hairy legs, was doodling\non his notepad and eating candy out of a bag. And a black-haired girl\nin a suit of coveralls three sizes too big for her, and, apparently,\nnot much of anything else, lounged with one knee hooked over her\nchair-arm, staring into the screen at the distant horizon.\n\n\"Dr. Murillo. Dr. Mur--\" The radioman broke off in mid-syllable and\nlistened for a moment. \"I hear you, doctor, go ahead.\" Then, a moment\nlater \"What's your position, now, doctor?\"\n\n\"I can see them,\" the girl said, lifting a hand in front of her. \"At\ntwo o'clock, about one of my hand's-breadths above the horizon.\"\n\nThe man with the grizzled beard put his face into the fur around the\neyepiece of the telescopic-'visor and twisted a dial. \"You have good\neyes, Miss Quinton,\" he complimented. \"Only four personal armors;\nAhmed, ask him where the fifth is.\"\n\n\"We only see four of your personal-armors,\" the radioman said. \"Who's\nmissing, and why?\" He waited for a moment, then lowered the hand-phone\nand turned. \"The fifth one's inside the handling-machine. One of the\nUllerans. Gorkrink.\"\n\nThe larger of the specks that had appeared on the horizon resolved\nitself into a handling-machine, a thing like an oversized\ncontragravity-tank, with a bulldozer-blade, a stubby derrick-boom\ninstead of a gun, and jointed, claw-tipped arms to the sides. The\nsmaller dots grew into personal armor--egg-shaped things that sprouted\narms and grab-hooks and pushers in all directions. The man with the\ngrizzled beard began talking rapidly into his hand-phone, then hung it\nup. There was a series of bumps, and the armor-tender, weightless on\ncontragravity, shook as the handling-machine came aboard.\n\n\"You ever see any nuclear bombing, Miss Quinton?\" the young man with\nthe hairy legs asked, offering her his candy bag.\n\n\"Only by telecast, back Sol-side,\" she replied, helping herself.\n\"Test-shots at the Federation Navy proving-ground on Mars. I never\neven heard of nuclear bombs being used for mining till I came here,\nthough.\"\n\n\"Well, if this turns out as well as the other job, three months ago,\nit'll be something to see,\" he promised. \"These volcanoes have been\ndormant for, oh, maybe as long as a thousand years; there ought to be\na pretty good head of gas down there. And the magma'll be thick,\nviscous stuff, like basalt on Terra. Of course, this won't be anything\nlike basalt in composition--it'll be intensely compressed metallic\nfluorides, with a very high metal-content. The volcanoes we shot three\nmonths ago yielded a fine flow of lava with all sorts of\nmetals--nickel, beryllium, vanadium, chromium, indium, as well as\ncopper and iron.\"\n\n\"What sort of gas were you speaking about?\" she asked.\n\n\"Hydrogen. That's what's going to make the fireworks; it combines\nexplosively with fluorine. The hydrogen-fluorine combination is what\npasses for combustion here; the result is hydrofluoric acid, the\nlocal equivalent of water. See, the metallic core of this planet is\ncovered, much less thickly than that of Terra, with fluoride\nrock--fluorspar, and that sort of thing. There's nothing like granite\nhere, for instance. That's why those big dunes, out there, are the\nbest Niflheim has in the way of mountains. The subsurface hydrogen is\nproduced when the acid filters down through the rock, combines with\npure metals underneath.\"\n\n\"Dr. Murillo's inside, now,\" the radioman said. \"Just came out of the\ninner airlock. He'll be up as soon as he gets out of his\npressure-suit.\"\n\n\"As soon as he gets here, I'll touch it off,\" the bearded man said.\n\"Everything set, de Jong?\"\n\n\"Everything ready, Dr. Gomes,\" one of his assistants assured him.\n\nThe door at the rear of the control-cabin opened, and Juan Murillo,\nthe seismologist, entered, followed by an assistant. Murillo was a big\nman, copper-skinned, barrel-chested; he looked like a third-or\nfourth-generation Martian, of Andes Indian ancestry. He came forward\nand stood behind Gomes' chair, looking down at the instruments. His\nassistant stopped at the door. This assistant was not human. He was a\nbiped, vaguely humanoid, but he had four arms and a face like a\nlizard's, and, except for some equipment on a belt, he was entirely\nnaked.\n\nHe spoke rapidly to Murillo, in a squeaking jabber. Murillo turned.\n\n\"Yes, if you wish, Gorkrink,\" he said, in the\nEnglish-Spanish-Afrikaans-Portuguese mixture that was Sixth Century,\nA.E., Lingua Terra. Then he turned back to Gomes as the Ulleran sat\ndown in a chair by the door.\n\n\"Well, she's all yours, Louren\u00e7o, shoot the works.\"\n\nGomes stabbed the radio-detonator button in front of him. A voice came\nout of the PA-speaker overhead: \"In sixty seconds, the bombs will be\ndetonated ... thirty seconds ... fifteen seconds ... ten seconds ...\nfive seconds, four seconds, three seconds, two seconds, one\nsecond....\"\n\nOut on the rolling skyline, fifty miles away, a lancelike ray of\nblue-white light shot up into the gathering dusk--a clump of five\nrays, really, from five deep shafts in an irregular pentagon half a\nmile across, blended into one by the distance. An instant later, there\nwas a blinding flash, like sheet-lightning, and a huge ball of\nvaricolored fire belched upward, leaving a series of smoke-rings to\nfloat more slowly after it. That fireball flattened, then spread to\nform the mushroom-head of a column of incandescent gas that mounted to\novertake it, engorging the smoke-rings as it rose, twisting, writhing,\nchanging shape, turning to dark smoke in one moment and belching flame\nand crackling with lightning the next. The armor-tender began to pitch\nand roll; it was all the engineer and one of the assistants could do,\ntogether, to keep it level.\n\n\"In about half an hour,\" the large young man told the girl, \"the real\nfireworks should be starting. What's coming up now is just small\ndebris from the nuclear blast. When the shockwaves get down far enough\nto crack things open, the gas'll come up, and then steam and ash, and\nthen the magma. This one ought to be twice as good as the one we shot\nthree months ago; it ought to be every bit as good as Krakatoa, on\nTerra, in 59 Pre-Atomic.\"\n\n\"Well, even this much was worth staying over for,\" the girl said,\nwatching the screen.\n\n\"You going on to Uller on the _City of Canberra_?\" Louren\u00e7o Gomes\nasked. \"I wish I were; I have to stay over and make another shot, in a\nmonth or so, and I've had about all of Niflheim I can take, now. The\nsooner I get onto a planet where they don't ration the air, the better\nI'll like it.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you know!\" the large young man with the hairy legs\nmock-marveled. \"He doesn't like our nice planet!\"\n\n\"Nice planet!\" Gomes muttered something. \"They call Terra God's\nFootstool; well, I'll give you one guess who uses this thing to prop\nhis cloven hoofs on.\"\n\n\"When are you going to Terra?\" the girl asked him.\n\n\"Terra? I don't know, a year, two years. But I'm going to Uller on the\nnext ship--the _City of Pretoria_--if we get the next blast off in\ntime. They want me to design some improvements on a couple of\npower-reactors, so I'll probably see you when I get there.\"\n\n\"Here she comes!\" the chief engineer called. \"Watch the base of the\ncolumn!\"\n\nThe pillar of fiery smoke and dust, still boiling up from where the\nbombs had gone off far underground, was being violently agitated at\nthe bottom. A series of new flashes broke out, lifting and spreading\nthe incandescent radioactive gasses, and then a great gush of flame\nrose. A column of pure hydrogen must have rushed up into the vacuum\ncreated by the explosion; the next blast of flame, in a lateral sheet,\ncame at nearly ten thousand feet above the ground, and great rags of\nfire, changing from red to violet and back through the spectrum to red\nagain, went soaring away to dissipate in the upper atmosphere. Then\ngeysers of hot ash and molten rock spouted upward; some of the\nwhite-hot debris landed almost at the acid river, half-way to the\narmor-tender.\n\n\"We've started a first-class earthquake, too,\" the Hispano-Indian\nMartian Murillo said, looking at the instruments. \"About six big\ncracks opening in the rock-structure. You know, when this quiets down\nand cools off, we'll have more ore on the surface than we can handle\nin ten years, and more than we could have mined by ordinary means in\nfifty.\"\n\nAbout four miles from the original blast, another eruption began with\na terrific gas-explosion.\n\n\"Well, that finishes our work,\" the large young man said, going to a\nkitbag in the corner of the cabin and getting out a bottle. \"Get some\nof those plastic cups, over there, somebody; this one calls for a\ndrink.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Gomes said. \"You do something once, it may be an\naccident; you repeat the performance, and it's a success.\" He began\npushing papers aside on his desk, and the girl in the too-ample\ncoveralls brought drinking cups.\n\nThe Ulleran, in the background, rose quickly and squeaked\napologetically. Murillo nodded. \"Yes, of course, Gorkrink. No need for\nyou to stay here.\" The Ulleran went out, closing the door behind him.\n\n\"That taboo against Ullerans and Terrans watching each other eat and\ndrink,\" Murillo said. \"What is that, part of their religion?\"\n\n\"No, it's their version of modesty,\" the girl replied. \"Like some of\nour sex-inhibitions, which they can't even begin to understand.... But\nyou were speaking to him in Lingua Terra; I didn't know any of them\nunderstood it.\"\n\n\"Gorkrink does,\" Murillo said, uncorking the bottle and pouring into\nthe plastic cups. \"None of them can speak it, of course, because of\nthe structure of their vocal organs, any more than we can speak their\nlanguages without artificial aids. But I can talk to him in Lingua\nTerra without having to put one of those damn gags in my mouth, and he\ncan pass my instructions on to the others. He's been a big help; I'll\nbe sorry to lose him.\"\n\n\"Lose him?\"\n\n\"Yes, his year's up; he's going back to Uller on the _Canberra_. You\nknow, it's impossible to keep some trace of fluorine from the air in\nthe handling-machines, or even out on the orbiters, and it plays the\ndevil with their lungs. He wanted to stay on another three months, to\nhelp with the next shot, but the medics wouldn't hear of it.... He's\nfrom Keegark, wherever on Uller that is; claims to be a prince, or\nsomething. I know all the other geeks kowtow to him. But he's a damn\ngood worker. Very smart; picks things up the first time you tell him.\nI'll recommend him unqualifiedly for any kind of work with\ncontragravity or mechanized equipment.\"\n\nThey all had drinks, now, except the chief engineer, who wanted a\nrain-check on his.\n\n\"Well, here's to us,\" Murillo said. \"The first A-bomb miners in\nhistory....\"\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\nCommander-in-Chief Front and Center\n\n\nGeneral Carlos von Schlichten threw his cigarette away, flexed his\nhands in his gloves, and set his monocle more firmly in his eye,\nstepping forward as the footsteps on the stairway behind him ceased\nand the other officers emerged from the squat flint keep--Captain\nCazabielle, the post CO; big, chocolate-brown Brigadier-General\nThemistocles M'zangwe; little Colonel Hideyoshi O'Leary. Far in front\nof him, to the left, the horizon was lost in the cloudbank over Takkad\nSea; directly in front, and to the right, the brown and gray and black\nflint mountains sawed into the sky until they vanished in the\ndistance. Unseen below, the old caravan-trail climbed one side of the\npass and slid down the other, a sheer five hundred feet below the\nparapet and the two corner catapult-platforms which now mounted 90-mm\nguns. On the little hundred-foot-square parade ground in front of the\nkeep, his aircar was parked, and the soldiers were assembled.\n\nTen or twelve of them were Terrans--a couple of lieutenants,\nsergeants, gunners, technicians, the sergeant-driver and\ncorporal-gunner of his own car. The other fifty-odd were Ulleran\nnatives. They stood erect on stumpy legs and broad, six-toed feet.\nThey had four arms apiece, one pair from true shoulders and the other\nconnected to a pseudo-pelvis midway down the torso. Their skins were\nslate-gray and rubbery, speckled with pinhead-sized bits of quartz\nthat had been formed from perspiration, for their body-tissues were\nsilicone instead of carbon-hydrogen. Their narrow heads were\nunpleasantly saurian; they had small, double-lidded red eyes, and\nslit-like nostrils, and wide mouths filled with opalescent teeth.\nExcept for their belts and equipment, they were completely naked; the\nuniform consisted of the emblem of the Chartered Uller Company\nstencil-painted on chests and backs. Clothing, to them, was\nunnecessary, either for warmth or modesty. As to the former, they were\ncold-blooded and could stand a temperature-range of from a hundred and\ntwenty to minus one hundred Centigrade. Von Schlichten had seen them\nsleeping in the open with their bodies covered with frost or freezing\nrain; he had also seen them wade through boiling water. As to the\nsecond, they had practically no sex-inhibitions; they were all of the\nsame gender, true, functional, hermaphrodites. Any individual among\nthem could bear young, or fertilize the ova of any other individual.\nFifteen years ago, when he had come to Uller as a former Terran\nFederation captain newly commissioned colonel in the army of the Uller\nCompany, it had taken some time before he had become accustomed to the\ndetailing of a non-com and a couple of privates out of each platoon\nfor baby-sitting duty. At least, though, they didn't have the\nsquaw-trouble around army posts on Uller that they had on Thor, where\nhe had last been stationed.\n\nAn airjeep, coming in out of the sun, circled the crag-top fort and\nlet down onto the terrace next to von Schlichten's command-car. It\ncarried a bristle of 15-mm machine-guns, and two of the eight 50-mm\nrocket-tubes on either side were empty and freshly smoke-stained. The\nduraglass canopy slid back, and the two-man crew--lieutenant-driver\nand sergeant-gunner--jumped out. Von Schlichten knew them both.\n\n\"Lieutenant Kendall; Sergeant Garcia,\" he greeted. \"Good afternoon,\ngentlemen.\"\n\nBoth saluted, in the informal, hell-with-rank-we're-all-human manner\nof Terran soldiers on extraterrestrial duty, and returned the\ngreeting.\n\n\"How's the Jeel situation?\" he asked, then nodded toward the fired\nrocket-tubes. \"I see you had some shooting.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" the lieutenant said. \"Two bands of them. We sighted the\nfirst coming up the eastern side of the mountain about two miles this\nside of the Blue Springs. We got about half of them with MG-fire, and\nthe rest dived into a big rock-crevice. We had to use two rockets on\nthem, and then had to let down and pot a few of them with our pistols.\nWe caught the second band in that little punchbowl place about a mile\nthis side of Zortolk's Old Fort. There were only six of them; they\nwere bunched together, feeding. Off one of their own gang, I'd say;\nthe way we've been keeping them up in the high rocks, they've been\neating inside the family quite a bit, lately. We let them have two\nrockets. No survivors. Not many very big pieces, in fact. We let down\nat Zortolk's for a beer, after that, and Captain Martinelli told us\nthat one of his jeeps caught what he thinks was the same band that was\ndown off the mountain night-before-last and ate those peasants on\nPrince Neeldink's estate.\"\n\n\"By God, I'm glad to hear that!\" There'd been a perfect hell of a flap\nabout that business. Before the Terrans came to Uller, it was a good\nyear when not more than five hundred farm-folk would be killed and\neaten by Jeel cannibals. The incident of two nights ago had been the\nfirst of its kind in almost six months, but the nobleman whose serfs\nhad been eaten was practically accusing the Company of responsibility\nfor the crime. \"I'll see that Neeldink is informed. The more you do\nfor these damned geeks, the more they expect from you.... When you get\nyour vehicle re-ammoed, lieutenant, suppose you buzz back to where you\nmachine-gunned that first gang. If there are any more around, they'll\nhave moved in for the free meal by now.\" This breakdown of the Jeels'\ntaboo against eating fellow-tribesmen was one of the best things he'd\nheard from the cannibal-extermination project for some time.\n\nHe turned to Themistocles M'zangwe. \"In about two weeks, get a little\ntask-force together. Say ten combat-cars, about twenty airjeeps, and a\nbattalion of Kragan Rifles in troop-carriers. Oh, yes, and this\ngood-for-nothing Konkrook Fencibles outfit of Prince Jaizerd's; they\ncan be used for beaters, and to block escape routes.\" He turned back\nto Lieutenant Kendall and Sergeant Garcia. \"Good work, boys. And if\nthe synchro-photos show that any of that first bunch got away, don't\nfeel too badly about it. These Jeels can hide on the top of a\npool-table.\"\n\nHe climbed into the command-car, followed by Themistocles M'zangwe and\nHideyoshi O'Leary. Sergeant Harry Quong and Corporal Hassan Bogdanoff\ntook their places on the front seat; the car lifted, turned to nose\ninto the wind, and rose in a slow spiral. Below, the fort grew\nsmaller, a flat-topped rectangle of masonry overlooking the pass, a\ngun covering each approach, and two more on the square keep to cover\nthe rocky hogback on which the fort had been built, with the flagpole\nbetween them. Once that pole had lifted a banner of ragged black\nmarsh-flopper skin bearing the device of the Kragan riever-chieftain\nwhose family had built the castle; now it carried a neat rectangle of\nblue bunting emblazoned with the wreathed globe of the Terran\nFederation and, below that, the blue-gray pennant which bore the\nvermilion trademark of the Chartered Uller Company.\n\n\"Where now, sir?\" Harry Quong asked.\n\nHe looked at his watch. Seventeen-hundred; there wasn't time for a\nvisit to Zortolk's Old Fort, ten miles to the north at the next pass.\n\n\"Back to Konkrook, to the island.\"\n\nThe nose of the car swung east by south; the cold-jet rotors began\nhumming and then the hot-jets were cut in. The car turned from the\nfort and the mountains and shot away over the foothills toward the\ncoastal plain. Below were forests, yellow-green with new foliage of\nthe second growing season of the equatorial year, veined with narrow\ndirt roads and spotted with occasional clearings. Farther east, the\ndirty gray woodsmoke of Uller marked the progress of the\ncharcoal-burnings. It took forty years to burn the forests clear back\nto the flint cliffs; by the time the burners reached the mountains,\nthe new trees at the seaward edge would be ready to cut. Off to the\nsouth, he could see the dark green squares, where the hemlocks and\nNorway spruce had been planted by the Company. With a little chemical\nfertilizer, they were doing well, and they made better charcoal than\nthe silicate-heavy native wood. That was the only natural fuel on\nUller; there was no coal, of course, since fallen timber and even\nstanding dead trees petrified in a matter of a couple of years. There\nwas too much silica on Uller, and not enough of anything else; what\nwould be coal-seams on Terra were strata of silicified wood. And, of\ncourse, there was no petroleum. There was less charcoal being burned\nnow than formerly; the Uller Company had been bringing in great\nquantities of synthetic thermoconcentrate-fuel, and had been setting\nup nuclear furnaces and nuclear-electric power-plants, wherever they\ngained a foothold on the planet.\n\nBeyond the forests came the farmlands. Around the older estates, thick\nwalls of flint and petrified wood had been built, and wide moats dug,\nto keep out the shellosaurs. But now the moats were dry, and the walls\nfalling into disrepair. Some of the newer farms, land devoted to\nagriculture with the declining demand for charcoal, had neither moats\nnor walls. That was the Company, too; the huge shell-armored beasts\nhad become virtually extinct in the Konk Isthmus now, since the\nintroduction of bazookas and recoilless rifles. There seemed to be\nquite a bit of power-equipment working in the fields, and big\ncontragravity lorries were drifting back and forth, scattering\nfertilizer, mainly nitrates from Mimir or Yggdrasill. There were still\na good number of animal-drawn plows and harrows in use, however.\n\nAs planets went, Uller was no bargain, he thought sourly. At times, he\nwished he had never followed the lure of rapid promotion and\nfantastically high pay and left the Federation regulars for the army\nof the Uller Company. If he hadn't, he'd probably be a colonel, at\nfive thousand sols a year, but maybe it would be better to be a\nmiddle-aged colonel on a decent planet--Odin, with its two moons,\nHugin and Munin, and its wide grasslands and its evergreen forests\nthat looked and even smelled like the pinewoods of Terra, or Baldur,\nwith snow-capped mountains, and clear, cold lakes, and rocky rivers\ndashing under great vine-hung trees, or Freya, where the people were\nhuman to the last degree and the women were so breathtakingly\nbeautiful--than a Company army general at twenty-five thousand on\nthis combination icebox, furnace, wind-tunnel and stonepile, where the\nwater tasted like soapsuds and left a crackly film when it dried;\nwhere the temperature ranged, from pole to pole, between two hundred\nand fifty and minus a hundred and fifty Fahrenheit and the\nBeaufort-scale ran up to thirty; where nothing that ran or swam or\ngrew was fit for a human to eat, and where the people....\n\nOf course, there were worse planets than Uller. There was Nidhog, cold\nand foggy, its equatorial zone a gloomy marsh and the rest of the planet\nlocked in eternal ice. There was Bifrost, which always kept the same\nface turned to its primary; one side blazingly hot and the other close\nto absolute zero, with a narrow and barely habitable twilight zone\nbetween. There was Mimir, swarming with a race of semi-intelligent\nquasi-rodents, murderous, treacherous, utterly vicious. Or Niflheim. The\nUller Company had the franchise for Niflheim, too; they'd had to take\nthat and agree to exploit the planet's resources in order to get the\nfranchise for Uller, which furnished a good quick measure of the\ncomparative merits of the two.\n\nAhead, the city of Konkrook sprawled along the delta of the Konk river\nand extended itself inland. The river was dry, now. Except in spring,\nwhen it was a red-brown torrent, it never ran more than a trickle, and\nnot at all this late in the northern summer. The aircar lost altitude,\nand the hot-jet stopped firing. They came gliding in over the suburbs\nand the yellow-green parks, over the low one-story dwellings and\nshops, the lofty temples and palaces, the fantastically twisted\ntowers, following a street that became increasingly mean and squalid\nas it neared the industrial district along the waterfront.\n\nVon Schlichten, on the right, glanced idly down, puffing slowly on\nhis cigarette. Then he stiffened, the muscles around his right eye\nclamping tighter on the monocle. Leaning forward, he punched Harry\nQuong lightly on the shoulder.\n\n\"Circle back, sergeant; let's have a look at that street again,\" he\ndirected. \"Something going on, down there; looks like a riot.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; I saw it,\" the Chinese-Australian driver replied. \"Terrans\nin trouble; bein' mobbed by geeks. Aircar parked right in the bloody\nmiddle of it.\"\n\nThe car made a twisting, banking loop and came back, more slowly.\nColonel Hideyoshi O'Leary was using the binoculars.\n\n\"That's right,\" he said. \"Terrans being mobbed. Two of them, backed up\nagainst a house. I saw one of them firing a pistol.\"\n\nVon Schlichten had the handset of the car's radio, and was punching\nout the combination of the Company guardhouse on Gongonk Island; he\nheld down the signal button until he got an answer.\n\n\"Von Schlichten, in car over Konkrook. Riot on Fourth Avenue, just off\nSeventy-second Street.\" No Terran could possibly remember the names of\nKonkrook's streets; even native troops recruited from outside found\nthe numbers easier to learn and remember. \"Geeks mobbing a couple of\nTerrans. I'm going down, now, to do what I can to help; send troops in\na hurry. Kragan Rifles. And stand by; my driver'll give it to you as\nit happens.\"\n\nThe voice of somebody at the guardhouse, bawling orders, came out of\nthe receiver as he tossed the phone forward over Harry Quong's\nshoulder; Quong caught it and began speaking rapidly and urgently into\nit while he steered with the other hand. Von Schlichten took one of\nthe five-pound spiked riot-maces out of the rack in front of him.\nThemistocles M'zangwe had already drawn his pistol; he shifted it to\nhis left hand and took a mace in his right. The Nipponese-Irish\ncolonel, looking like a homicidally infuriated pixie, had an automatic\nin one hand and a long dagger in the other.\n\nHarry Quong and Hassan Bogdanoff were old Uller hands; they'd done\nthis sort of work before. Bogdanoff rose into the ball-turret and\nswung the twin 15-mm's around, cutting loose. Quong brought the car in\nfast, at about shoulder-height on the mob. Between them, they left a\nswath of mangled, killed, wounded, and stunned natives. Then, spinning\nthe car around, Quong set it down hard on a clump of rioters as close\nas possible to the struggling group around the two Terrans. Von\nSchlichten threw back the canopy and jumped out of the car, O'Leary\nand M'zangwe behind him.\n\nThere was another aircar, a dark maroon civilian job, at the curb; its\nnative driver was slumped forward over the controls, a short\ncrossbow-bolt sticking out of his neck. Backed against the closed door\nof a house, a Terran with white hair and a small beard was clubbing\nfutilely with an empty pistol. He was wounded, and blood was streaming\nover his face. His companion, a young woman in a long fur coat, was\nlaying about her with a native bolo-knife.\n\nVon Schlichten's mace had a spiked ball-head, and a four-inch spike in\nfront of that. He smashed the ball down on the back of one Ulleran's\nhead, and jabbed another in the rump with the spike.\n\n\"_Zak! Zak!_\" he yelled, in pidgin-Ulleran. \"_Jik-jik_, you\nlizard-faced Creator's blunder!\"\n\nThe Ulleran whirled, swinging a blade somewhere between a big\nbutcherknife and a small machete. His mouth was open, and there was\nfroth on his lips.\n\n\"_Znidd suddabit!_\" he screamed.\n\nVon Schlichten parried the cut on the steel shaft of his mace.\n\"_Suddabit_ yourself, you geek bastard!\" he shouted back, ramming the\nspike-end into the opal-filled mouth. \"And _znidd_ you, too,\" he\nadded, recovering and slamming the ball-head down on the narrow\nsaurian skull. The Ulleran went down, spurting a yellow fluid about\nthe consistency of gun-oil. Then, without wasting words, he maced\nanother of the things.\n\nAhead, one of the natives had caught the wounded Terran with both\nlower hands, and was raising a dagger with his upper right. The girl\nin the fur coat swung wildly, slashing the knife-arm, then chopped\ndown on the creature's neck. To one side, a native somewhat better\ndressed than the others, to the extent of a couple of belts with gold\nornaments, drew a Terran automatic. Von Schlichten hurled his mace and\ndrew his pistol, thumbing off the safety as he swung it up, but before\nhe could fire, Hassan Bogdanoff had seen and swung his guns around;\nthe double burst caught the native in the chest and fairly tore him\napart.\n\nAnother of them closed with the girl, grabbing her right arm with all\nfour hands and biting at her; she screamed and kicked her attacker in\nthe groin, where an Ulleran is, if anything, even more vulnerable than\na Terran. The native howled hideously, and von Schlichten, jumping\nover a couple of corpses, shoved the muzzle of his pistol into the\ncreature's open mouth and pulled the trigger, blowing its head apart\nlike a rotten pumpkin and splashing both himself and the girl with\nyellow blood and rancid-looking gray-green brains.\n\nHideyoshi O'Leary, jumping forward after von Schlichten, stuck his\ndagger into the neck of a rioter and left it there, then caught the\ngirl around the waist with his free arm. Themistocles M'zangwe dropped\nhis mace and swung the frail-looking man onto his back. Together, they\nstruggled back to the command-car, von Schlichten covering the retreat\nwith his pistol. Another rioter--a Zirk nomad from the North, he\nguessed--was aiming one of the long-barreled native air-rifles,\nholding the ten-inch globe of the air-chamber in both lower hands. Von\nSchlichten shot him, and the Zirk literally blew to pieces.\n\nFor an instant, he wondered how the small bursting-charge of a 10-mm\nexplosive pistol-bullet could accomplish such havoc, and assumed that\nthe native had been carrying a bomb in his belt. Then another\nexplosion tossed fragmentary corpses nearby, and another and another.\nGlancing quickly over his shoulder, he saw four combat-cars coming in,\nfiring with 40-mm auto-cannon and 15-mm machine-guns. They swept\nbetween the hovels on one side and the warehouses on the other,\nstrafing the mob, darted up to a thousand feet, looped, and came\nswooping back, and this time there were three long blue-gray\ntroop-carriers behind them.\n\nThese landed in the hastily cleared street and began disgorging native\nCompany soldiers--Kragan mercenaries, he noted with satisfaction. They\ncarried a modified version of the regular Terran Federation infantry\nrifle, stocked and sighted to conform to their physical peculiarities,\nwith long, thorn-like, triangular bayonets. One platoon ran forward,\ndropped to one knee, and began firing rapidly into what was left of\nthe mob. Four-handed soldiers can deliver a simply astonishing volume\nof fire, particularly when armed with auto-rifles having twenty-shot\ndrop-out magazines which can be changed with the lower hands without\nlowering the weapon.\n\nThere was a clatter of shod hoofs, and a company of the King of\nKonkrook's cavalry came trotting up on their six-legged,\nlizard-headed, quartz-speckled mounts. Some of these charged into side\nalleys, joyfully lancing and cutting down fleeing rioters, while\nothers dismounted, three tossing their reins to a fourth, and went to\nwork with their crossbows. Von Schlichten, who ordinarily entertained\na dim opinion of the King of Konkrook's soldiery, admitted,\ngrudgingly, that it was smart work; four hands were a big help in\nusing a crossbow, too.\n\nA Terran captain of native infantry came over, saluting.\n\n\"Are you and your people all right, general?\" he asked.\n\nVon Schlichten glanced at the front seat of his car, where Harry\nQuong, a pistol in his right hand, was still talking into the\nradio-phone, and Hassan Bogdanoff was putting fresh belts into his\nguns. Then he saw that the Graeco-African brigadier and the\nIrish-Japanese colonel had gotten the wounded man into the car. The\ngirl, having dropped her bolo, was leaning against the side of the\ncar, one foot heedlessly in what was left of an Ulleran who had gotten\nsmashed under it, weak with nervous reaction.\n\n\"We seem to be, Captain Pedolsky. Very smart work; you must have those\nvehicles of yours on hyperspace-drive.... How is he, colonel?\"\n\n\"We'd better get him to the hospital, right away,\" O'Leary replied. \"I\nthink he has a concussion.\"\n\n\"Harry, call the hospital. Tell them what the score is, and tell them\nwe're bringing the casualty in to their top landing stage.... Why,\nwe'll make out very nicely, captain. You'd better stay around with\nyour Kragans and make sure that these geeks of King Jaikark's don't\nlet the riot flare up again and get away from them. And don't let them\nget the impression that they can maintain order around here without\nour help; the Company would like to see that attitude discouraged.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I understand.\" Captain Pedolsky opened the pouch on his\nbelt and took out the false palate and tongue-clicker without which no\nTerran could do more than mouth a crude and barely comprehensible\npidgin-Ulleran. Stuffing the gadget into his mouth, he turned and\nbegan jabbering orders.\n\nVon Schlichten helped the girl into the car, placing her on his right.\nThe wounded civilian was propped up in the left corner of the seat,\nand Colonel O'Leary and Brigadier-General M'zangwe took the\njump-seats. The driver put on the contragravity-field, and the car\nlifted up.\n\n\"Them, see if there's a flask and a drinking-cup in the door pocket\nnext to you,\" he said. \"I think Miss Quinton could use a drink.\"\n\nThe girl turned. Even in her present disheveled condition, she was\nbeautiful--a trifle on the petite side, with black hair and black eyes\nthat quirked up oddly at the outer corners. Her nails were\nblack-lacquered and spotted with little gold stars, evidently a new\nfeminine fad from Terra.\n\n\"I certainly could, general.... How did you know my name?\"\n\n\"You've been on Uller for the last three months; ever since the _City\nof Canberra_ got in from Niflheim. On Uller, there aren't enough of us\nthat everybody doesn't know all about everybody else. You're Dr. Paula\nQuinton; you're an extraterrestrial sociographer, and you're a\nfield-agent for the Extraterrestrials' Rights Association, like\nMohammed Ferriera, here.\" He took the cup and flask from Themistocles\nM'zangwe and poured her a drink. \"Take this easy, now; Baldur\nhoney-rum, a hundred and fifty proof.\"\n\nHe watched her sip the stuff cautiously, cough over the first\nmouthful, and then get the rest of it down.\n\n\"More?\" When she shook her head, he stoppered the flask and relieved\nher of the cup. \"What were you doing in that district, anyhow?\" he\nwanted to know. \"I'd have thought Mohammed Ferriera would have had\nmore sense than to take you there, or go there, himself, for that\nmatter.\"\n\n\"We went to visit a friend of his, a native named Keeluk, who seems to\nbe a sort of combination clergyman and labor leader,\" she replied.\n\"I'm going to observe labor conditions at the North Pole mines in a\nshort while, and Mr. Keeluk was going to give me letters of\nintroduction to friends of his at Skilk.\"\n\nWith the aid of his monocle, von Schlichten managed to keep a straight\nface. Neither M'zangwe nor O'Leary had any such aid; the African\nrolled his eyes and the Japanese-Irishman grimaced.\n\n\"We talked with Mr. Keeluk for a while,\" the girl said, \"and when we\ncame out, we found that our driver had been killed and a mob had\ngathered. Of course, we were carrying pistols; they're part of this\nsurvival-kit you make everybody carry, along with the emergency-rations\nand the water-desilicator. Mr. Ferriera's wasn't loaded, but mine was.\nWhen they rushed us, I shot a couple of them, and then picked up that\nbig knife....\"\n\n\"That's why you're still alive,\" von Schlichten commented.\n\n\"We wouldn't be if you hadn't come along,\" she told him. \"I never in\nmy life saw anything as beautiful as you coming through that mob\nswinging that war-club!\"\n\n\"Well, I never saw anything much more beautiful than those 40-mm's\nbeginning to land in the mob,\" von Schlichten replied.\n\nThe aircar swung out over Konkrook Channel and headed toward the\nblue-gray Company buildings on Gongonk Island, and the Company\nairport, swarming with lorries and airboats, where the ten\nthousand-ton _Oom Paul Kruger_ had just come in from Keegark, and the\nCompany's one real warship, the cruiser _Procyon_, was lifting out for\nGrank, in the North. Down at the southern tip of the island, the\nthree-thousand-foot globe of the spaceship _City of Pretoria_, from\nNiflheim, was loading with cargo for Terra.\n\n\"Just what happened, while you and Mr. Ferriera were in Keeluk's\nhouse. Miss Quinton?\" Hideyoshi O'Leary asked, trying not to sound\nofficial. \"Was Keeluk with you all the time? Or did he go out for a\nwhile, say fifteen or twenty minutes before you left?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, he did.\" Paula Quinton looked surprised. \"How did you guess\nit? You see, a dog started barking, behind the house, and he excused\nhimself and....\"\n\n\"A dog?\" von Schlichten almost shouted. The other officers echoed him,\nand on the front seat, Harry Quong said, \"Coo-bli'me!\"\n\n\"Why, yes....\" Paula Quinton's eyes widened. \"But there are no dogs on\nUller, except a few owned by Terrans. And wasn't there something\nabout ...?\"\n\nVon Schlichten had the radio-phone and was calling the command car at\nthe scene of the riot. The sergeant-driver answered.\n\n\"Von Schlichten here; my compliments to Captain Pedolsky, and tell him\nhe's to make immediate and thorough search of the house in front of\nwhich the incident occurred, and adjoining houses. For his\ninformation, that's Keeluk's house. Tell him to look for traces of\nGovernor-General Harrington's collie, or any of the other terrestrial\nanimals that have been disappearing--that goat, for instance, or those\nrabbits. And I want Keeluk brought in, alive and in condition to be\ninterrogated. I'll send more troops, or Constabulary, to help you.\" He\nhanded the phone to M'zangwe. \"You take care of that end of it, Them;\nyou know who can be spared.\"\n\n\"But, what ...?\" the girl began.\n\n\"That's why you were attacked,\" he told her. \"Keeluk was afraid to let\nyou get away from there alive to report hearing that dog, so he went\nout and had a gang of thugs rounded up to kill you.\"\n\n\"But he was only gone five minutes.\"\n\n\"In five minutes, I can put all the troops in Konkrook into action.\nKeeluk doesn't have radio or TV--we hope--but he has his forces\nconcentrated, and he has a pretty good staff.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Keeluk's a friend of ours. He knows what our Association is\ntrying to do for his people....\"\n\n\"So he shows his appreciation by setting that mob on you. Look, he has\na lot of influence in that section. When you were attacked, why wasn't\nhe out trying to quiet the mob?\"\n\n\"When they jumped you, you tried to get back into the house,\" M'zangwe\nput in. \"And you found the door barred against you.\"\n\n\"Yes, but....\" The girl looked troubled; M'zangwe had guessed right.\n\"But what's all the excitement about the dog? What is it, the sacred\ntotem-animal of the Uller Company?\"\n\n\"It's just a big brown collie, named Stalin, like half the dogs on\nTerra. Somebody stole it, and Keeluk was keeping it, and we want to\nknow why. We don't like geek mysteries; not when they lead to\nmurderous attacks on Terrans, at least.\"\n\nThe aircar let down on the hospital landing stage. A stretcher was\nwaiting, with a Terran interne and two Ulleran orderlies. They got the\nstill-unconscious Mohammed Ferriera out of the car.\n\n\"You'd better go with them, yourself, Miss Quinton,\" von Schlichten\nadvised. \"You have a couple of nasty-looking bruises and bumps. A\ncouple of abrasions, too, where those geeks grabbed you; they have\nhides like sandpaper. And better have that coat cleaned, before that\ngoo on it hardens, or it'll be ruined.\"\n\n\"Yes. You have a lot of it on your uniform, too.\"\n\nHe glanced down at the blue-gray jacket. \"So I have. And another\nthing. Those letters Keeluk was going to give you, the ones to his\nfriends in Skilk. Did you get them?\"\n\nShe felt in the pocket of her coat. \"Yes. I still have them.\"\n\n\"I wish you'd let Colonel O'Leary have a look at them. There may be\nmore to them than you think.... Hid, will you go with Miss Quinton?\"\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\nRakkeed, Stalin, and the Rev. Keeluk\n\n\nVon Schlichten, in a fresh uniform, sat at the end of the table in\nSidney Harrington's office; Harrington and Eric Blount, the\nLieutenant-Governor, faced each other across it, over the three-foot\ndisc of an Ulleran chess-board. Harrington had the white, or center,\nposition. Blount, sandy-haired and considerably younger, was playing\nblack, and his pieces were closing in relentlessly from the outer rim.\n\n\"Well, then what?\" Harrington asked.\n\nVon Schlichten dropped ash from his cigarette into the tray that\nserved all three of them.\n\n\"Nothing much,\" he replied. \"Keeluk bugged out as soon as he saw my\ncar let down. We picked up a few of his ragtag-and-bobtail, and\nthey're being questioned now, but I doubt if they'll tell us anything\nwe don't know already. The dog had been kept in a lean-to back of the\nhouse; it had been removed, probably as soon as Keeluk called in his\ngoon-gang. At least one of the rabbits had been kept on the premises,\ntoo, some time ago. No trace of the goat.\"\n\nHe watched Blount move one of his pieces and nodded approvingly. \"The\nriot's been put down,\" he continued, \"but we're keeping two companies\nof Kragans in the city, and about a dozen airjeeps patrolling the\nsection from Eightieth down to Sixty-fourth, and from the waterfront\nback to Eighth Avenue. There is also the equivalent of a regiment of\nKing Jaikark's infantry--spearmen, crossbowmen, and a few\nriflemen--and two of those outsize cavalry companies of his, helping\nhold the lid down. They're making mass arrests, indiscriminately. More\nslaves for Jaikark's court favorite, of course.\"\n\n\"Or else Gurgurk wants them to use for patronage,\" Blount added. \"He's\nbeen building quite a political organization, lately. Getting ready to\nshove Jaikark off the throne, I'd say.\"\n\nHarrington pushed one of his pieces out along a radial line toward the\nrim. Blount promptly took a pawn, which, under Ulleran rules, entitled\nhim to a second move. He shifted another piece, a sort of combination\nknight and bishop, to threaten the piece Harrington had moved.\n\n\"Oh, Gurgurk wouldn't dare try anything like that,\" the\nGovernor-General said. \"He knows we wouldn't let him get away with it.\nWe have too much of an investment in King Jaikark.\"\n\n\"Then why's Gurgurk been supporting this damned Rakkeed?\" Blount\nwanted to know, hastily interposing a piece. \"Gurgurk can follow one\nof two lines of policy. He can undertake to heave Jaikark off the\nthrone and seize power, or he has to support Jaikark on the throne.\nWe're subsidizing Jaikark. Rakkeed has been preaching this crusade\nagainst the Terrans, and against Jaikark, whom we control. Gurgurk has\nbeen subsidizing Rakkeed....\"\n\n\"You haven't any proof of that,\" Harrington protested.\n\n\"My Intelligence Section has,\" von Schlichten put in. \"We can give\nsums of money, and dates, and the names of the intermediaries through\nwhom they were paid to Rakkeed. Eric is absolutely correct in making\nthat statement.\"\n\n\"Personally, I think Gurgurk's plan is something like this: Rakkeed\nwill stir up anti-Terran sentiment here in Konkrook, and direct it\nagainst our puppet, Jaikark, as well as against us,\" Blount said.\n\"When the outbreak comes, Jaikark will be killed, and then Gurgurk\nwill step in, seize the Palace, and use the Royal army to put down the\nrevolt that he's incited in the first place. That will put him in the\nposition of the friend of the Company, and most of his dupes will be\nrounded up and sold as slaves, and King Gurgurk'll pocket the\nproceeds. The only question is, will Rakkeed let himself be used that\nway? I think Rakkeed's bigger than Gurgurk ever can be. And more of a\nthreat to the Company. Everywhere we turn, Rakkeed's at the bottom of\nwhatever happens to be wrong. This business, for instance; Keeluk's\none of Rakkeed's followers.\"\n\n\"Eric, you have Rakkeed on the brain!\" Harrington exclaimed\nimpatiently, then moved the threatened piece counterclockwise on the\ncircle where he had placed it. \"He's just a barbarian caravan-driver.\"\n\nEric Blount moved the piece that had taken Harrington's pawn.\n\n\"Your king's in danger,\" he warned. \"And Hitler was just a\npaper-hanger.\"\n\n\"Rakkeed has no following, except among the rabble.\" Harrington puffed\nfuriously at his pipe, trying to figure the best protection for his\nking.\n\n\"You just think he hasn't,\" Blount retorted. \"Here in Konkrook, he's\nalways entertained by one or another of the big ship-owning nobles.\nThey probably deprecate his table-manners, but they just love his\npolitics. And the same thing at Keegark, and at the Free Cities along\nthe Eastern Shore.\"\n\n\"The last time Rakkeed was in Konkrook, he was the guest of the\nKeegarkan Ambassador,\" von Schlichten stated. \"Intelligence got that\nfrom a spy we'd planted among the embassy servants.\"\n\n\"You sure this spy wasn't just romancing?\" Harrington asked. \"You get\nso confounded many wild stories about Rakkeed. Three days after he was\nreported here at Konkrook, he was reported at Skilk, five thousand\nmiles away, said to be having an audience with King Firkked.\"\n\n\"No mystery to that,\" von Schlichten said. \"He travels on our ships,\nin disguise, coolie-class, on the geek-deck.\"\n\n\"Be a good idea if he could be caught at it, some time,\" Blount said,\nmaking another move. \"One of the lower-deck loading ports could be\nleft unlocked, by carelessness, and he could blunder overboard at\nabout five thousand feet.\" He watched Harrington make a deceptively\npointless-looking move. \"Sid, this damn dog business worries me.\"\n\n\"Worries me, too. I'm fond of that mutt, and God only knows what sort\nof stuff he's been getting to eat. And I hate to think of why those\ngeeks stole him, too.\"\n\n\"Well, at risk of seeming heartless, I'm not so much worried for\nStalin as I am about why Keeluk was hiding him, and why he was willing\nto murder the only two Terrans in Konkrook who trust him, to prevent\nour finding out that he had him.\"\n\n\"A Mr. Keeluk, a clergyman,\" von Schlichten quoted. He chain-lit\nanother cigarette and stubbed out the old one. \"Maybe the Rev. Keeluk\nwanted Stalin for sacramental purposes.\"\n\nBlount looked up sharply. \"Ritual killing?\" he asked. \"Or sympathetic\nmagic?\"\n\nVon Schlichten shrugged. \"Take your choice. Maybe Rakkeed wanted the\ndog, to kill before a congregation of his followers, killing us by\nproxy, or in effigy. Or maybe they think we worship Stalin, and\ngetting control of him would give them power over us. I wish we knew a\nlittle more about Ulleran psychology.\"\n\nThat wasn't the first time he'd made that wish. Even if sex weren't\nthe paramount psychological factor the ancient Freudians believed, it\nwas an extremely important one, and on Uller most of the fundamental\nterms of Terran psychology were meaningless. At the same time, the\naverage Ulleran probably had complexes and neuroses that would have\nhad Freud talking to himself, and they certainly indulged in practices\nthat would have even stood Krafft-Ebing's hair on end.\n\n\"One thing,\" Blount said. \"It doesn't take any Ulleran psychologist to\nknow that about eighty percent of them hate us poisonously.\"\n\n\"Oh, rubbish!\" Harrington blew the exclamation out around his\npipe-stem with a gush of smoke. \"A few fanatics hate us, and a few\nmerchants who lost money when we replaced this primitive barter\neconomy of theirs, but nine-tenths of them have benefited enormously\nfrom us, and continue to benefit....\"\n\n\"And hate us more deeply with each new benefit,\" Blount added. \"They\nresent everything we've done for them.\"\n\n\"Yes, this spaceport proposition of King Orgzild of Keegark looks like\nit, now doesn't it?\" Harrington retorted. \"He hates and resents us so\nmuch that he's offered us a spaceport at his city....\"\n\n\"What's it going to cost him?\" Blount asked. \"He furnishes the\nland--sequestered from the estate of some noble he executed for\ntreason--and the labor--all forced. We furnish the structural steel,\nthe machine-equipment, the engineering. We get a spaceport we don't\nreally need, and he gets all the business it'll bring to Keegark.\nConsidering the fact that Rakkeed is a welcome guest at his embassy\nhere, and at the Royal Palace at Keegark, I'm beginning to wonder if\nhe isn't fomenting trouble for us here at Konkrook to make us willing\nto move our main base to his city.\"\n\nHe made a move. Instantly, Harrington slashed out from the middle of\nthe board with one of his heavy-duty, all-purpose pieces and took a\npiece, then moved again.\n\n\"Now look whose king's threatened!\" he crowed.\n\n\"Yes, I see.\" Blount brought a piece clockwise around the board and\ntook the threatening piece, then moved again. \"I hope you see whose\nking's threatened, now.\"\n\nHarrington swore, reached out to move a piece, and then jerked his\nhand back as though the piece were radioactive. For a while, he sat\npuffing his pipe and staring at the board.\n\n\"In fact, Orgzild's so sure that we're going to accept his offer that\nhe's started building two new power-reactors, to handle the additional\npower-demand that'll result from the increased business,\" Blount\ncontinued.\n\n\"Where's he getting the plutonium?\" von Schlichten asked.\n\n\"Where can he get it?\" Harrington replied. \"He just bought four tons\nof it from us, off the _City of Pretoria_.\"\n\n\"That's a hell of a lot of plutonium,\" Blount said. \"I wonder if he\nmightn't have some idea of what else plutonium can be used for,\nbeside generating power.\"\n\n\"Oh, God, I hope not!\" Harrington exclaimed. \"You're going to get me\nstarted seeing burglars under the bed, next....\"\n\n\"Maybe there are burglars,\" Blount said, pointing with his\ncigarette-holder to Harrington's threatened king. \"Can't you do\nsomething about that, Sid?\" Then he turned to von Schlichten. \"Before\nwe get off the subject, how about those letters the Rev. Keeluk gave\nto the Quinton girl?\"\n\n\"All addressed to Skilkans known to be Rakkeed disciples and rabidly\nanti-Terran,\" von Schlichten replied. \"We radioed the list to Skilk;\nColonel Cheng-Li, our intelligence man there, teleprinted us back a\nlot of material on them that looks like the Newgate Calendar. We\nturned the letters themselves over to Doc Petrie, the Ulleran\nphilology sharp, who is a pretty fair cryptanalyst. He couldn't find\nany indications of cipher, but there was a lot of gossip about\nKeeluk's friends and parishioners which might have arbitrary\ncode-meanings. I'm going to explain the situation to Miss Quinton, and\nadvise her to have nothing to do with any of the people Keeluk gave\nher letters to.\"\n\nHarrington had gotten his king temporarily out of danger, losing a\npiece doing it.\n\n\"Think she'll listen to you?\" he asked. \"These Extraterrestrials'\nRights Association people are a lot of blasted fanatics, themselves.\nWe're a gang of bloody-handed, flint-hearted, imperialistic sons of\nbitches in their book, and anything we say's sure to be a Hitler-sized\nlie.\"\n\n\"Oh, they're not as bad as all that. I never met the girl before\ntoday, but old Mohammed Ferriera's a decent bloke. And their\nassociation's really done a lot of good. For one thing, they put an\nend to the peonage system on Yggdrasill, and I know what conditions\nwere like, there, before they did.\"\n\nA calculating look came into Harrington's eye. He puffed slowly at his\npipe and slid a piece from the center toward the sector of the board\nnearest him. Blount whistled softly and made a quick re-arrangement.\n\n\"Carlos, did you say she told you she was going to Skilk, in the near\nfuture?\" Harrington asked. \"Well, look here; you're going up that way,\nyourself, with that battalion of Kragans, on the _Aldebaran_. Why\ndon't you invite her to make the trip with you? You can be quite\nattractive to young ladies, when you try, and she'll be grateful for\nthat rescue this afternoon, which is always a good foundation. Maybe\nyou can plant a couple of ideas where they'll do the most good. She's\nonly been here for three months--since the _Canberra_ got in from\nNiflheim. You know and I know and we all know that there are a lot of\nthings up there at the polar mines that would look like hell to\nanybody who didn't understand local conditions....\"\n\n\"Well, Miss Quinton's company won't be any particularly heavy cross\nfor me to bear,\" von Schlichten replied. \"I won't guarantee anything,\nof course....\"\n\nThe intercom-speaker on the table whistled several times. Harrington\nswore, laid down his pipe, and got up, brushing ashes from the front\nof his coat. He flipped a switch and spoke into the box.\n\n\"Governor,\" a voice replied out of it, \"there's a geek procession just\nlanded from a water-barge in front, and is coming up the roadway to\nCompany House. A platoon of Jaikark's Household Guards, with rifles;\nthe Spear of State; a royal litter; about thirty geek nobles, on foot;\na gift-litter; another platoon of riflemen, if you say the last\nsyllable quick enough.\"\n\n\"That'll be Gurgurk, coming to tell us how unhappy his Sodden and\nInebriated Geekship is about that fracas on Seventy-second Street,\"\nHarrington said. \"The gift-litter will contain the customary\nindemnity, at the current market quotation. Have Gurgurk and party\nadmitted, all but the rifle-platoons; give him an honor guard of our\nKragans, and keep his own gun-toters outside. Take them to the\nReception Hall, and hold them there till I signal from the Audience\nHall, and then herd them in.\"\n\nHe came back and made a move. Immediately, Blount took one of his\npieces, moved again, took another, and made the third move to which he\nwas entitled.\n\n\"I'll mate you in four moves,\" he predicted. \"Want to play it out,\nbefore we go down?\"\n\n\"Sure; what's time to a geek? Gurgurk'd think we were worried about\nsomething if we didn't keep him waiting.... Good Lord! You do have me\nover a barrel, Eric!\"\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nFour-and-Twenty Geek Heads\n\n\nGovernor-General Sidney Harrington sat on the comfortably upholstered\nbench on the dais of the Audience Hall, flanked by von Schlichten and\nEric Blount. He didn't look particularly regal, even on that high\nseat--with his ruddy outdoorsman's face and his ragged gray mustache\nand his old tweed coat spotted with pipe-ashes, he might have been any\nof the dozen-odd country-gentleman neighbors of von Schlichten's\nboyhood in the Argentine. But then, to a Terran, any of the kings of\nUller would have looked like a freak birth in a lizard-house at a zoo;\nit was hard to guess what impression Harrington would make on an\nUlleran.\n\nHe took the false palate and tongue-clicker, officially designated as\nan \"enunciator, Ulleran\" and, colloquially, as a geek-speaker, out of\nhis coat pocket and shoved it into his mouth. Von Schlichten and\nBlount put in theirs, and Harrington pressed the floor-button with his\ntoe. After a brief interval, the wide doors at the other end of the\nhall slid open, and the Konkrookan notables, attended by a dozen\nCompany native-officers and a guard of Kragan Rifles, entered. The\nhonor-guard advanced in two columns; between them marched an unclad\nand heavily armed native carrying an ornate spear with a three-foot\nblade upright in front of him with all four hands. It was the\nKonkrookan Spear of State; it represented the proxy-presence of King\nJaikark. Behind it stalked Gurgurk, the Konkrookan equivalent of Prime\nMinister or Grand Vizier; he wore a gold helmet and a thing like a\nstring-vest made of gold wire, and carried a long sword with a\ntwo-hand grip, a pair of Terran automatics built for a hand with six\nfour-knuckled fingers, and a pair of matched daggers. He was\nconsiderably past the Ulleran prime of life--seventy or eighty, to\njudge from the worn appearance of his opal teeth, the color of his\nskin, and the predominantly reddish tint of his quartz-speckles. An\nimmature Ulleran would be a very light gray, white under the arms, and\nhis quartz-specks would run from white to pale yellow. The retinue of\nnobles behind Gurgurk ran through the whole spectrum, from a\nprinceling who was almost oyster-gray to old Ghroghrank, the Keegarkan\nAmbassador, who was even blacker and more red-speckled than Gurgurk.\nAll of them carried about as much ironmongery as the Prime\nMinister--the pistols were all Terran, and the swords and daggers were\nmostly made either on Terra or at the Terran-operated steel-works on\nVolund.\n\nFour slaves brought up the rear carrying an ornately inlaid box on\npoles. When the spear-bearer reached the exact middle of the hall, he\nhalted and grounded his regalia-weapon with a thump. Gurgurk came up\nand halted a couple of paces behind and to the left of the spear, and\nall the other nobles drew up in two curved lines some ten paces to the\nrear, with considerable pushing and jostling and a _sotto voce_\nargument, with overtones of weapon-fingering, about precedence. All,\nthat is, but Ghroghrank and another noble, who came up and planted\nthemselves beside Gurgurk. Von Schlichten regarded the assemblage\nsourly through his monocle. Maybe Sid Harrington _did_ look regal,\nafter all.\n\nThe Governor-General rose slowly and descended from the dais,\nadvancing to within ten paces of the Spear, von Schlichten and Blount\naccompanying him. Out of the corner of his eye, von Schlichten watched\na couple of Kragan mercenaries with fifty-shot machine-rifles move\nunobtrusively to positions from whence they could, if necessary, spray\nthe visitors with bullets without endangering the Terrans.\n\n\"Welcome, Gurgurk,\" Harrington gibbered through his false palate. \"The\nCompany is honored by this visit.\"\n\n\"I come in the name of my royal master, His Sublime and Ineffable\nMajesty, Jaikark the Seventeenth, King of Konkrook and of all the\nlands of the Konk Isthmus,\" Gurgurk squeaked and clicked. \"I have the\nhonor to bring with me the Lord Ghroghrank, Ambassador of King Orgzild\nof Keegark to the court of my royal master.\"\n\n\"And I,\" Ghroghrank said, after being suitably welcomed, \"am honored\nto be accompanied by Prince Gorkrink, special envoy from my master,\nhis Royal and Imperial Majesty King Orgzild, who is in your city to\nreceive the shipment of power-metal my royal master has been honored\nto be permitted to purchase from the Company.\"\n\nMore protocol about welcoming Gorkrink. Then Gurgurk cleared his\nthroat with a series of barking sounds.\n\n\"My royal master, His Sublime and Ineffable Majesty, is prostrated\nwith grief,\" he stated solemnly. \"Were his sorrow not so overwhelming,\nhe would have come in His Own Sacred Person to express the pain and\nshame which he feels that people of the Company should be set upon\nand endangered in the streets of the royal city.\"\n\nIf he weren't doped to the ears, von Schlichten substituted mentally.\nThere was a native drug which had, on its users, the combined effects\nof hashish, heroin and yohimbine; Jaikark and all his court circle\nwere addicts. He probably hadn't even heard of the riot.\n\n\"The soldiers of His Sublime and Ineffable Majesty came most promptly\nto the aid of the troops of the Company, did they not, General von\nSchlichten?\" Harrington asked.\n\n\"Within minutes, Your Excellency,\" von Schlichten replied gravely.\n\"Their promptness, valor, and efficiency were most exemplary.\"\n\nGurgurk spoke at length, expressing himself as delighted, on behalf of\nhis royal master, at hearing such high praise from so distinguished a\nsoldier. Eric Blount then contributed a short speech, beseeching the\ngods that the deep and beautiful friendship existing between the\nChartered Uller Company and His Sublime etcetera would continue\nunimpaired, and that His Sublime etcetera would enjoy long life and\npeaceful reign, managing, by a trick of Konkrookan grammar, to imply\nthat the second would be conditional upon the first. The Keegarkan\nAmbassador then spoke his piece, expressing on behalf of King Orgzild\nthe deepest regret that the people of the Company should be so\nmolested, and managing to hint that things like that simply didn't\nhappen at Keegark.\n\nThe Prince Gorkrink then spoke briefly, in sympathy for the great and\ngood friend of all Ulleran peoples, Mohammed Ferriera, who had been\ninjured, and hoping that he would soon enjoy full health again. He\nalso managed to convey King Orgzild's pleasure at having obtained the\nplutonium. Von Schlichten noticed that a few of his more recent\nquartz-specks were slightly greenish in tinge, a sure sign that he\nhad, not long ago, been exposed to the fluorine-tainted air which men\nand geeks alike breathed on Niflheim. When a geek prince hired out as\na laborer for a year on Niflheim, he did so for only one purpose--to\nlearn Terran technologies.\n\nGurgurk then announced that so enormous a crime against the friends of\nHis Sublime etcetera had not been allowed to go unpunished, signaling\nbehind him with one of his lower hands for the box to be brought\nforward. The slaves carried it to the front, set it down, and opened\nit, taking from it a rug which they spread on the floor. On this, from\nthe box, they placed twenty-four newly severed opal-grinning heads, in\nfour neat rows. They had all been freshly scrubbed and polished, but\nthey still smelled like crushed cockroaches.\n\nThe three Terrans looked at them gravely. A double-dozen heads was\nstandard payment for an attack in which no Terran had been killed.\nOstensibly, they were the heads of the ringleaders: in practice, they\nwere usually lopped from the first two-dozen prisoners or over-age\nslaves at hand, without regard for whether the victims had even heard\nof the crime which they were expiating. If the Extraterrestrial's\nRights Association were really serious about the rights of these\ngeeks, they'd advocate booting out all these native princes and\nturning the whole planet over to the Company. That had been the Terran\nFederation's idea, from the beginning; why else give the Company's\nchief representative the title of Governor-General?\n\nThere was another long speech from Gurgurk, with the nobles behind him\nmurmuring antiphonal agreement--standard procedure, for which there\nwas a standard pun, geek chorus--and a speech of response from Sid\nHarrington. Standing stiffly through the whole rigamarole, von\nSchlichten waited for it to end, as finally it did.\n\nThey walked back from the door, whence they had escorted the\ndelegation, and stood looking down at the saurian heads on the rug.\nHarrington raised his voice and called to a Kragan sergeant whose\nchevrons were painted on all four arms.\n\n\"Take this carrion out and stuff it in the incinerator,\" he ordered.\n\"If any of you think you can clean up this rug and this box, you're\nwelcome to them.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" von Schlichten told the sergeant. Then he disgorged\nand pouched his geek-speaker. \"See that head, there?\" he asked,\nrolling it over with his toe. \"I killed that geek, myself, with my\npistol, while Them and Hid were getting Ferriera into the car. Miss\nQuinton killed that one with the bolo; see where she chopped him on\nthe back of the neck? The cut that took off the head was a little low,\nand missed it. And Hid O'Leary stuck a knife in that one.\" He walked\naround the rug, turning heads over with his foot. \"This was cut-rate\nhead-payment; they just slashed off two-dozen heads at the scene of\nthe riot. I don't like this butchery of worn-out slaves and petty\nthieves any better than anybody else, but this I don't like either.\nSix months ago, Gurgurk wouldn't have tried to pull anything like\nthis. Now he's laughing up his non-existent sleeve at us.\"\n\n\"That's what I've been preaching, all along,\" Eric Blount took up\nafter him. \"These geeks need having the fear of Terra thrown into\nthem.\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense, Eric; you're just as bad as Carlos, here!\" Harrington\ntut-tutted. \"Next, you'll be saying that we ought to depose Jaikark\nand take control ourselves.\"\n\n\"Well, what's wrong with that, for an idea?\" von Schlichten demanded.\n\"Don't you think we could? Our Kragans could go through that army of\nJaikark's like fast neutrons through toilet-paper.\"\n\n\"My God!\" Harrington exploded. \"Don't let me hear that kind of talk\nagain! We're not _conquistadores_; we're employees of a business\nconcern, here to make money honestly, by exchanging goods and services\nwith these people....\"\n\nHe turned and walked away, out of the Audience Hall, leaving von\nSchlichten and Blount to watch the removal of the geek-heads.\n\n\"You know, I went a little too far,\" von Schlichten confessed. \"Or too\nfast, rather. He's got to be conditioned to accept that idea.\"\n\n\"We can't go too slowly, either,\" Blount replied. \"If we wait for him\nto change his mind, it'll be the same as waiting for him to retire.\nAnd that'll be waiting too long.\"\n\nVon Schlichten nodded seriously. \"Did you notice the green specks in\nthe hide of that Prince Gorkrink?\" he asked. \"He's just come back from\nNiflheim. Not on the _Pretoria_, I don't think. Probably on the\n_Canberra_, three months ago.\"\n\n\"And he's here to get that plutonium, and ship it to Keegark on the\n_Oom Paul Kruger_,\" Blount considered. \"I wonder just what he learned,\non Niflheim.\"\n\n\"I wonder just what's going on at Keegark,\" von Schlichten said.\n\"Orgzild's pulled down a regular First-Century-model iron curtain. You\nknow, four of our best native Intelligence operatives have been\nmurdered in Keegark in the last three months, and six more have just\nvanished there.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm going there in a few days, myself, to talk to Orgzild about\nthis spaceport deal,\" Blount said. \"I'll have a talk with Hendrik\nLemoyne and MacKinnon. And I'll see what I can find out for myself.\"\n\n\"Well, let's go have a drink,\" von Schlichten suggested, consulting\nhis watch. \"About time for a cocktail.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nIf You Read It in Stanley-Browne\n\n\nVon Schlichten and Blount entered the bar together--the Broadway Room,\ndecorated in gleaming plastics and chromium in enthusiastic if\nslightly inaccurate imitation of a First Century New York nightclub.\nThere were no native servants to spoil the illusion, such as it was:\nthe service was fully automatic. Going to a bartending machine, von\nSchlichten dialed the cocktail they had decided upon and inserted his\nkey to charge the drinks to his account, filling a four-portion jug.\n\nAs they turned away, they almost collided with Hideyoshi O'Leary and\nPaula Quinton. The girl wore a long-sleeved gown to conceal a bandage\non her right wrist, and her face was rather heavily powdered in spots;\notherwise she looked none the worse for recent experiences.\n\n\"Well, you seem to have gotten yourself repaired, Miss Quinton,\" he\ngreeted her. \"Feel better, now?... Miss Quinton, this is\nLieutenant-Governor Blount. Eric, Miss Paula Quinton.\"\n\n\"Delighted, Miss Quinton,\" Blount said. \"Carlos tells us he found you\nstanding over poor Mohammed Ferriera, fighting like a commando. How is\nMohammed, by the way? No danger, I hope; we all like him.\"\n\nMohammed Ferriera was still unconscious, the girl reported; he had a\nminor concussion, but the medics were not greatly disturbed, and\nexpected him to be fully recovered in a few weeks. Von Schlichten\ninvited her and her escort to join him and Blount. Colonel O'Leary was\ncarrying a cocktail jug and a couple of glasses; finding a table out\nof the worst of the noise, they all sat down together.\n\n\"I suppose you think it's a joke, our being nearly murdered by the\npeople we came to help,\" Paula began, a trifle defensively.\n\n\"Not a very funny joke,\" von Schlichten told her. \"It's been played on\nus till it's lost its humor.\"\n\n\"Yes, geek ingratitude's an old story to all of us,\" Blount agreed.\n\"You stay on this planet very long and you'll see what I mean.\"\n\n\"You call them that, too?\" she asked, as though disappointed in him.\n\"Maybe if you stopped calling them geeks, they wouldn't resent you the\nway they do. You know, that's a nasty name; in the First Century\nPre-Atomic, it designated a degraded person who performed some sort of\nrevolting public exhibition....\"\n\n\"Biting off live chickens' heads, in a sideshow wild-man act,\"\nHideyoshi O'Leary supplied. \"When you get up north, watch how the\npeasants kill these little things like six-legged iguanas that they\nraise for food.\"\n\n\"That isn't the reason, though,\" von Schlichten said. \"As we use it,\nthe word's pure onomatopoeia. You've learned some of the languages;\nyou know what they sound like. _Geek-geek-geek._\"\n\n\"As far as that goes, you know what the geek name for a Terran is?\"\nBlount asked. \"_Suddabit._\"\n\nShe looked puzzled for a moment, then slipped in her enunciator. Even\nin the absence of any native, she used her handkerchief to mask the\nact.\n\n\"Suddabit,\" she said, distinctly. \"Sud-da-a-bit.\" Taking out the\ngeek-speaker, she put it away. \"Why, that's exactly how they'd\npronounce it!\"\n\n\"And don't tell me you haven't heard it before,\" O'Leary said. \"The\ngeeks were screaming it at you, over on Seventy-second Street, this\nafternoon. _Znidd suddabit_; kill the Terrans. That's Rakkeed the\nProphet's whole gospel.\"\n\n\"So you see,\" Eric Blount rammed home the moral, \"this is just another\ncase of nobody with any right to call anybody else's kettle black....\nCigarette?\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" She leaned toward the lighter-flame O'Leary had snapped\ninto being. \"I suspect that of being a principle you'd like me to bear\nin mind at the polar mines, when I see, let's say, some laborer being\nbeaten by a couple of overseers with three foot lengths of\nthree-quarter-inch steel cable.\"\n\n\"Well, you could also remember that a native's skin is about half an\ninch thick, and a good deal tougher than a human's,\" von Schlichten\ntold her. \"And it wouldn't hurt any if you found out how these\nlaborers are treated at home. Mostly they're serfs hired from the big\nlandowners; it's a fact you can easily verify that permission to join\nthe labor-companies at the polar mines is regarded as a privilege,\ngranted as a reward or denied as a punishment. And most of the geek\nlandowners are bitterly critical of the way we treat our labor at the\nmines; they claim we make them dissatisfied with the treatment they\nget at home.\"\n\n\"Of course, they're always glad to have the peasants taken off their\nhands during a slack agricultural season,\" Blount added, \"and we train\nworkers to handle contragravity power-equipment. I won't deny that\nthere's a lot of unnecessary brutality on the part of the native\nforemen and overseers, which we're trying, gradually, to eliminate.\nYou'll have to remember, though, that we're dealing with a naturally\nbrutal race.\"\n\n\"Of course, mistreatment of native labor is always blamed on other\nnatives, never on the gentle and kindly Terrans,\" she replied. \"That's\nbeen SOP on every planet our Association's had any experience with.\"\n\n\"Now look; you just came here from Niflheim,\" von Schlichten objected.\n\"The Company employs quite a few geeks there; how much brutality did\nyou run into there?\"\n\n\"Well, I must admit, the Ullerans who work there are very well\ntreated. Except that I don't think it's right to employ any people\nwith silicone body-tissues where they're going to breathe\nfluorine-tainted air.\"\n\n\"Nobody ought to be employed on that planet!\" Hideyoshi O'Leary\ndeclared. \"I did a two-year hitch there, when I was first commissioned\nin the Company service.\"\n\n\"I put in two years there, too,\" Blount supported him. \"And I might\nadd that that's a year longer than any Ulleran native is ever allowed\nto spend on Niflheim. You know what the setup is, there, don't you?\nThe Terran Federation Space Navy discovered and explored both Uller\nand Niflheim, which made both planets public domain. The Company was\noriginally formed to exploit Uller alone, but the Federation insisted\nthat both planets would have to be franchised to the same company.\nThey wanted Niflheim exploited, mainly because of the uranium-deposits\nthere. As it turned out, the Company's making as much money out of\nNiflheim as we are out of Uller.\"\n\n\"What you miss is this,\" von Schlichten pointed out. \"On Niflheim,\nthere are about a thousand Terrans, and not more than five hundred\ngeeks, all employed on construction-work and in the mines, on the\nplanet itself, working directly under Terran supervision. We use them\nbecause they have four hands, and in the power-driven contragravity\narmor that's necessary there, they can manipulate more controls and do\nmore things at once than we can. Here on Uller, at the polar mines,\nthere are about ten thousand geeks working under five hundred Terrans,\nand most of the latter are engineers or technicians who don't do\nsupervisory work. So we have to use native foremen, and they're guilty\nof what mistreatment the workers suffer.\"\n\n\"And remember, too,\" O'Leary added, \"work at the polar mines can only\ngo on for about two months out of the year--mid-September to\nmid-November at the Arctic, and mid-March to mid-May at the Antarctic.\nNaturally, things have to be done in a hurry and under pressure.\"\n\n\"Well, why do you work mines at the poles? Aren't there mineral\ndeposits in places where you can work all year 'round?\"\n\n\"Not as rich, or as accessible,\" Blount said. \"You know what the\nseasons are like, at the poles of this planet. The temperature will\nrange from about two-fifty Fahrenheit in mid-summer to a hundred and\nfifty below in winter. There's the most intense sort of thermal\nerosion you can imagine--the ice-cap melts in the spring to a sea,\nwhich boils away completely by the middle of the summer. There will be\nviolent circular storms of hot wind, blowing away the light sand and\ndust and leaving the heavier particles of metallic ores and metals\nbehind. Then, when the winds fall, we move in for a couple of months.\nIt isn't really mining, or even quarrying; we just scoop up ore from\nthe surface, load it onto ore-boats, and fly it down to Skilk and\nKrink and Grank, where it's smelted through the winter. The natives\nrun the smelters; use the heat to thaw frozen food for themselves and\ntheir livestock while they're melting the ore. In the north,\nmetallurgy and food-preparation have always been combined that way.\"\n\n\"Yes, if you think the natives who work at the mines feel themselves\nill-treated, you might propose closing them down entirely and see what\nthe native reaction would be,\" von Schlichten told her. \"Independently\nhired free workers can make themselves rich, by native standards, in a\ncouple of seasons; many of the serfs pick up enough money from us in\nincentive-pay to buy their freedom after one season.\"\n\n\"Well, if the Company's doing so much good on this planet, how is it\nthat this native, Rakkeed, the one you call the Mad Prophet, is able\nto find such a following?\" Paula demanded. \"There must be something\nwrong somewhere.\"\n\n\"That's a fair question,\" Blount replied, inverting a cocktail jug\nover his glass to extract the last few drops. \"When we came to Uller,\nwe found a culture roughly like that of Europe during the Seventh\nCentury Pre-Atomic, or, more closely, like that of Japan before the\nbeginning of the First Century P. A. We initiated a technological and\neconomic revolution here, and such revolutions have their casualties,\ntoo. A number of classes and groups got squeezed pretty badly, like\nthe horse-breeders and harness-manufacturers on Terra by the invention\nof the automobile, or the coal and hydroelectric interests when direct\nconversion of nuclear energy to electric current was developed, or\nthe railroads and steamship lines at the time of the discovery of the\ncontragravity-field. Naturally, there's a lot of ill-feeling on the\npart of merchants and artisans who weren't able or willing to adapt\nthemselves to changing conditions; they're all backing Rakkeed and\nyelling '_Znidd suddabit!_' now. You know, it's a shame that geek\nmessiah isn't a smart crook, instead of an honest fanatic; he could\ntake in the equivalent of a couple of million sols a year off the\nNorth Uller merchants and the Equatorial Zone shipowners. But it is a\nfact, which not even Rakkeed can successfully deny, that we've raised\nthe general living standard of this planet by about two hundred\npercent.\"\n\n\"Rakkeed is a Zirk,\" von Schlichten said. \"They're the nomads who hire\nout to the northern merchants as caravan-drivers, and also prey, or\nused to prey, on the caravans as brigands. Since our air-freighters\ngot into operation, neither caravan-driving nor caravan-raiding has\nbeen a paying business, and our air-patrols have made caravan-raiding\nsuicidal as well. So the Zirks don't like us. The only thing they know\nor are willing to learn is handling these six-legged riding-and\npack-animals we call hipposaurs. We employ a few of them as cavalry,\nand a few more of them work as the local equivalent of _gauchos_, and\nthe rest just sit around and listen to Rakkeed's sermons.\"\n\nBoth jugs were empty. Colonel O'Leary, as befitted his junior rank,\npicked them up; after a good-natured wrangle with von Schlichten,\nBlount handed the colonel his credit-key.\n\n\"The merchants in the north don't like us; beside spoiling the\ncaravan-trade, we're spoiling their local business, because the\nland-owning barons, who used to deal with them, are now dealing\ndirectly with us. At Skilk, King Firkked's afraid his feudal nobility\nis going to try to force a Runnymede on him, so he's been currying\nfavor with the urban merchants; that makes him as pro-Rakkeed and as\nanti-Terran as they are. At Krink, King Jonkvank has the support of\nhis barons, but he's afraid of his urban bourgeoisie, and we pay him a\nhandsome subsidy, so he's pro-Terran and anti-Rakkeed. At Skilk,\nRakkeed comes and goes openly; at Krink he has a price on his head.\"\n\n\"Jonkvank is not one of the assets we boast about too loudly,\"\nHideyoshi O'Leary said, pausing on his way from the table. \"He's as\nbloody-minded an old murderer as you'd care not to meet in a dark\nalley anywhere.\"\n\n\"We can turn our backs on him and not expect a knife between our\nshoulders, anyhow,\" von Schlichten said. \"And we can believe, oh, up\nto eighty percent of what he tells us, and that's sixty percent better\nthan any of the other native princes, except King Kankad, of course.\nThe Kragans are the only real friends we have on this planet.\" He\nthought for a moment. \"Miss Quinton, are you doing sociographic\nresearch-work here, in addition to your Ex-Rights work?\" he asked.\n\"Well, let me advise you to pay some attention to the Kragans. You'll\nonly find them treated at any length at all in that compendium of\nmisinformation, Willard Stanley-Browne's _Short Sociographic History\nof Beta Hydrae II_, and ninety percent of what Stanley-Browne says\nabout them is completely erroneous.\"\n\n\"Oh, but they're just a parasite-race on the Terrans,\" Dr. Paula\nQuinton objected. \"You find races like that all through the explored\ngalaxy--pathetic cultural mongrels.\"\n\nBoth men laughed heartily. Colonel O'Leary, returning with the jugs,\nwanted to know what he'd missed. Blount told him.\n\n\"Ha! She's been reading that thing of Stanley-Browne's,\" he said.\n\n\"What's the matter with Stanley-Browne?\" Paula demanded.\n\n\"Stanley-Browne is one author you can depend on,\" O'Leary assured her.\n\"If you read it in Stanley-Browne, it's wrong. You know, I don't think\nshe's run into many Kragans. We ought to take her over and introduce\nher to King Kankad.\"\n\nVon Schlichten allowed himself to be smitten by an idea. \"By Allah, so\nwe had!\" he exclaimed. \"Look, you're going to Skilk, in the next week,\naren't you? Well, do you think you could get all your end-jobs cleared\nup here and be ready to leave by 0800 Tuesday? That's four days from\ntoday.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I could. Why?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm going to Skilk, myself, with the armed troopship\n_Aldebaran_. We're stopping at King Kankad's Town to pick up a\nbattalion of Kragan Rifles for duty at the polar mines, where you're\ngoing. Suppose we leave here in my command-car, go to Kankad's Town,\nand wait there till the _Aldebaran_ gets in. That would give us about\ntwo to three hours. If you think the Kragans are 'pathetic cultural\nmongrels,' what you'll see there will open your eyes. And I might add\nthat the nearest Stanley-Browne ever came to seeing Kankad's Town was\nfrom the air, once, at a distance of four miles.\"\n\n\"Well, they live entirely by serving as mercenary soldiers for the\nUller Company, don't they?\"\n\n\"More or less. You see, when we came to Uller, they were barbarian\nbrigands; had a string of forts along caravan-roads and at fords and\nmountain-passes, and levied tolls. They raided into Konkrook and\nKeegark territory, too. Well, we had to break that up. We fought a\nlittle war with them, beat them rather badly in a couple of\nskirmishes, and then made a deal with them. That was before my time,\nwhen old Jerry Kirke was Governor-General. He negotiated a treaty with\ntheir King, bought their rievers'-forts outright, and paid them a\nsubsidy to compensate for loss of tolls and raid-spoil, and agreed to\nemploy the whole tribe as soldiers. We've taught them a lot--you'll\nsee how much when you visit their town--but they aren't cultural\nmongrels. You'll like them.\"\n\n\"Well, general, I'll take you up,\" she said. \"But I warn you; if this\nis some scheme to indoctrinate me with the Uller Company's side of the\ncase and blind me to unjust exploitation of the natives here, I don't\npropagandize very easily.\"\n\n\"Fair enough, as long as you don't let fear of being propagandized\nblind you to the good we're doing here, or impair your ability to\nobserve and draw accurate conclusions. Just stay scientific about it\nand I'll be satisfied. Now, let's take time out for lubrication,\" he\nsaid, filling her glass and passing the jug.\n\nTwo hours and five cocktails later, they were still at the table, and\nthey had taught Paula Quinton some twenty verses of _The Heathen\nGeeks, They Wear No Breeks_, including the four printable ones.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\nYou Can Depend on It It's Wrong\n\n\nGongonk Island, with its blue-gray Company buildings, and the Terran\ngreen of the farms, and the spaceport with its ring of mooring-pylons\nempty since the _City of Pretoria_ had lifted out, two days before,\nfor Terra, was dropping away behind. Von Schlichten held his lighter\nfor Paula Quinton, then lit his own cigarette.\n\n\"I was rather horrified, Friday afternoon, at the way you and Colonel\nO'Leary and Mr. Blount were blaspheming against Stanley-Browne,\" she\nsaid. \"His book is practically the sociographers' Koran for this\nplanet. But I've been checking up, since, and I find that everybody\nwho's been here any length of time seems to deride it, and it's full\nof the most surprising misstatements. I'm either going to make myself\nfamous or get burned at the stake by the Extraterrestrial Sociographic\nSociety after I get back to Terra. In the last three months, I've been\nreally too busy with Ex-Rights work to do much research, but I'm\nbeginning to think there's a great deal in Stanley-Browne's book that\nwill have to be reconsidered.\"\n\n\"How'd you get into this, Miss Quinton?\" he asked.\n\n\"You mean sociography, or Ex-Rights? Well, my father and my\ngrandfather were both extraterrestrial sociographers--anthropologists\nwhose subjects aren't anthropomorphic--and I majored in sociography\nat the University of Montevideo. And I've always been in sympathy\nwith extraterrestrial races; one of my great-grandmothers was a\nFreyan.\"\n\n\"The deuce; I'd never have guessed that, as small and dark as you\nare.\"\n\n\"Well, another of my great-grandmothers was Japanese,\" she replied.\n\"The family name's French. I'm also part Spanish, part Russian, part\nItalian, part English ... the usual modern Argentine mixture.\"\n\n\"I'm an Argentino, too. From La Rioja, over along the Sierra de\nVelasco. My family lived there for the past five centuries. They came\nto the Argentine in the Year Three, Atomic Era.\"\n\n\"On account of the Hitler bust-up?\"\n\n\"Yes. I believe the first one, also a General von Schlichten, was what\nwas then known as a war-criminal.\"\n\n\"That makes us partners in crime, then,\" she laughed. \"The Quintons\nhad to leave France about the same time; they were what was known as\ncollaborationists.\"\n\n\"That's probably why the Southern Hemisphere managed to stay out of\nthe Third and Fourth World Wars,\" he considered. \"It was full of the\ndescendants of people who'd gotten the short end of the Second.\"\n\n\"Do you speak the Kragan language, general?\" she asked. \"I understand\nit's entirely different from the other Equatorial Ulleran languages.\"\n\n\"Yes. That's what gives the Kragans an entirely different semantic\norientation. For instance, they have nothing like a subject-predicate\nsentence structure. That's why, Stanley-Browne to the contrary\nnotwithstanding, they are entirely non-religious. Their language\nhasn't instilled in them a predisposition to think of everything as\nthe result of an action performed by an agent. And they have no\ndefinite parts of speech; any word can be used as any part of speech,\ndepending on context. Tense is applied to words used as nouns, not\nwords used as verbs; there are four tenses--spatial-temporal present,\nthings here-and-now; spatial present and temporal remote, things which\nwere here at some other time; spatial remote and temporal present,\nthings existing now somewhere else, and spatial-temporal remote,\nthings somewhere else some other time.\"\n\n\"Why, it's a wonder they haven't developed a Theory of Relativity!\"\n\n\"They have. It resembles ours about the way the Wright Brothers'\nairplane resembles this aircar, but I was explaining the\nKeene-Gonzales-Dillingham Theory and the older Einstein Theory to King\nKankad once, and it was beautiful to watch how he picked it up. Half\nthe time, he was a jump ahead of me.\"\n\nThe aircar began losing altitude and speed as they came in over\nKraggork Swamp; the treetops below blended into a level plain of\nyellow-green, pierced by glints of stagnant water underneath and\nbroken by an occasional low hillock, sometimes topped by a stockaded\nvillage.\n\n\"Those are the swamp-savages' homes,\" he told her. \"Most of what you\nfind in Stanley-Browne about them is fairly accurate. He spent a lot\nof time among them. He never seems to have realized, though, that they\nare living now as they have ever since the first appearance of\nintelligent life on this planet.\"\n\n\"You mean, they're the real aboriginal people of Uller?\"\n\n\"They and the Jeel cannibals, whom we are doing our best to\nexterminate,\" he replied. \"You see, at one time, the dominant type of\nmobile land-life was the thing we call a shellosaur, a big thing,\nrunning from five to fifteen tons, plated all over with silicate\nshell, till it looked like a six-legged pine-cone. Some were\nherbivores and some were carnivores. There are a few left, in remote\nplaces--quite a few in the Southern Hemisphere, which we haven't\nexplored very much. They were a satisfied life-form. Outside of a\nvolcano or an earthquake or an avalanche, nothing could hurt a\nshellosaur but a bigger shellosaur.\n\n\"Finally, of course, they grew beyond their sustenance-limit, but in\nthe meantime, some of them began specializing on mobility instead of\narmor and began excreting waste-matter instead of turning it to shell.\nSome of these new species got rid of their shell entirely. _Parahomo\nsapiens Ulleris_ is descended from one of these.\n\n\"The shellosaurs were still a serious menace, though. The ancestors of\nthe present Ulleran, the proto-geeks, when they were at about the Java\nApe-Man stage of development, took two divergent courses to escape the\nshellosaurs. Some of them took to the swamps, where the shellosaurs\nwould sink if they tried to follow. Those savages, down there, are\nstill living in the same manner; they never progressed. Others\nencountered problems of survival which had to be overcome by\ninvention. They progressed to barbarism, like the people of the\nfishing-villages, and some of them progressed to civilization, like\nthe Konkrookans and the Keegarkans.\n\n\"Then, there were others who took to the high rocks, where the\nshellosaurs couldn't climb. The Jeels are the primitive, original\nexample of that. Most of the North Uller civilizations developed from\nmountaineer-savages, and so did the Zirks and the other northern\nplains nomads.\"\n\n\"Well, how about the Kragans?\" Paula asked. \"Which were they?\"\n\nVon Schlichten was scanning the horizon ahead. He pulled over a pair\nof fifty-power binoculars on a swinging arm and put them where she\ncould use them.\n\n\"Right ahead, there; just a little to the left. See that brown-gray\nspot on the landward edge of the swamp? That's King Kankad's Town.\nIt's been there for thousands of years, and it's always been Kankad's\nTown. You might say, even the same Kankad. The Kragan kings have\nalways provided their own heirs, by self-fertilization. That's a\ncomplicated process, involving simultaneous male and female\nmasturbation, but the offspring is an exact duplicate of the single\nparent. The present Kankad speaks of his heir as 'Little Me,' which is\na fairly accurate way of putting it.\"\n\nHe knew what she was seeing through the glasses--a massive butte of\nflint, jutting out into the swamp on the end of a sharp ridge, with a\ncity on top of it. All the buildings were multi-storied, some piling\nupward from the top and some clinging to the sides. The high\nwatchtower at the front now carried a telecast-director, aimed at an\nautomatic relay-station on an unmanned orbiter two thousand miles\noff-planet.\n\n\"They're either swamp-people who moved up onto that rock, or they're\nmountaineers who came out that far along the ridge and stopped,\" she\nsaid. \"Which?\"\n\n\"Nobody's ever tried to find out. Maybe if you stay on Uller long\nenough, you can. That ought to be good for about eight to ten honorary\ndoctorates. And maybe a hundred sols a year in book royalties.\"\n\n\"Maybe I'll just do that, general.... What's that, on the little\nisland over there?\" she asked, shifting the glasses. \"A clump of\nflat-roofed buildings. Under a red-and-yellow danger-flag.\"\n\n\"That's Dynamite Island; the Kragans have an explosives-plant there.\nThey make nitroglycerine, like all the thalassic peoples; they also\nmake TNT and catastrophite, and propellants. Learned that from us, of\ncourse. They also manufacture most of their own firearms, some of them\npretty extreme--up to 25-mm for shoulder rifles. Don't ever fire one;\nit'd break every bone in your body.\"\n\n\"Are they that much stronger than us?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Just denser, heavier. They're about equal to us in\nweight-lifting. They can't run, or jump, as well as we can. We often\ncome out here for games with the Kragans, where the geeks can't watch\nus. And that reminds me--you're right about that being a term of\nderogation, because I don't believe I've ever knowingly spoken of a\nKragan as a geek, and in fact they've picked up the word from us and\napply it to all non-Kragans. But as I was saying, our baseball team\nhas to give theirs a handicap, but their football team can beat the\ndaylights out of ours. In a tug-of-war, we have to put two men on our\nend for every one of theirs. But they don't even try to play tennis\nwith us.\"\n\n\"Don't the other natives make their own firearms?\"\n\n\"No, and we're not going to teach them how. The thalassic peoples here\nin the Equatorial Zone are fairly good empirical, teaspoon-measure,\nchemists. Well, no, alchemists. They found out how to make\nnitroglycerine, and use it for blasting and for bombs and mines, and\nthey screw little capsules of it on the ends of their arrows. Most of\ntheir chemistry, such as it is, was learned in trying to prevent\norganic materials, like wood, from petrifying. Up in the north, where\nit gets cold, they learned a lot about metallurgy and ceramics, and\nabout forced-draft pneumatics, from having to keep fires going all\nwinter to thaw frozen food. They make air-rifles, to shoot metal\ndarts.\"\n\nThe aircar came in, circling slowly over the town on the big rock, and\nlet down on the roof of the castle-like building from which the\nwatchtower rose. There were a dozen or so individuals waiting for\nthem--the five Terrans, three men and two women, from the telecast\nstation, and the rest Kragans. One of these, dark-skinned but with\nspeckles no darker than light amber, armed only with a heavy dagger,\ncame over and clapped von Schlichten on the shoulder, grinning\nopalescently.\n\n\"Greetings, Von!\" he squawked in Kragan, then, seeing Paula, switched\nover to the customary language of the Takkad Sea country. \"It makes\nhappiness to see you. How long will you stay with us?\"\n\n\"Till the _Aldebaran_ gets in from Konkrook, to pick up the rifles,\"\nvon Schlichten replied, in Lingua Terra. He looked at his watch. \"Two\nhours and a half ... Kankad, this is Paula Quinton; Paula, King\nKankad.\"\n\nHe took out his geek-speaker and crammed it into his mouth. Before any\nother race on Uller, that would have been the most shocking sort of\nbad manners, without the token-concealment of the handkerchief. Kankad\ntook it as a matter of course. At some length, von Schlichten\nexplained the nature of Paula's sociographic work, her connection with\nthe Extraterrestrials' Rights Association, and her intention of going\nto the Arctic mines. Kankad nodded.\n\n\"You were right,\" he said. \"I wouldn't have understood all that in\nyour language. If I had read it, maybe, but not if I heard it.\" He put\nhis upper right hand on Paula's shoulder and uttered a clicking\napproximation of her name. \"I make you one of us,\" he told her. \"You\nmust come back, after the work stops at the mines; if you want to\nlearn about my people, I'll show you what you want to see, and tell\nyou what you want to know. But why not stay here? Why bother about\nthose geeks at the mines; the Company treats them much better than\nthey deserve. Stay here with us; we will make you happy to be with\nus.\"\n\nPaula replied slowly: \"I thank Kankad, but I must go. Those on Terra\nwho sent me here want me to learn for myself how the workers at the\nmines are treated. But I will come back--in a hundred, a hundred and\nfifty days.\"\n\nKankad's opal-jeweled grin widened. \"Good! We'll be waiting for you.\"\nHe turned and introduced another Kragan, about his own age, who wore\nthe equipment and insignia of a Company native-major and was freshly\npainted with the Company emblem. \"This is Kormork. He and I have borne\nyoung to each other. Kormork, you watch over Paula Quinton.\" He\nmanaged, on the second try, to make it more or less recognizable.\n\"Bring her back safe. Or else find yourself a good place to hide.\"\n\nKankad introduced the rest of his people, and von Schlichten\nintroduced the Terrans from the telecast-station. Then Kankad looked\nat the watch he was wearing on his lower left wrist.\n\n\"We will have plenty of time, before the ship comes, to show Paula the\ntown,\" he suggested. \"Von, you know better than I do what she would\nlike to see.\"\n\nHe led the way past a pair of long 90-mm guns to a stone stairway. Von\nSchlichten explained, as they went down, that the guns of King\nKankad's Town were the only artillery above 75-mm on Uller in\nnon-Terran hands. They climbed into an open machine-gun carrier and\nstrapped themselves to their seats, and for two hours King Kankad\nshowed her the sights of the town. They visited the school, where\nyoung Kragans were being taught to read Lingua Terra and studied from\ntextbooks printed in Johannesburg and Sydney and Buenos Aires. Kankad\nshowed her the repair-shops, where two-score descendants of Kragan\nriever-chieftains were working on contragravity equipment, under the\nsupervision of a Scottish-Afrikaner and his Malay-Portuguese wife; the\nsmall-arms factory, where very respectable copies of Terran rifles and\npistols and auto-weapons were being turned out; the machine-shop; the\nphysics and chemistry labs; the hospital; the ammunition-loading\nplant; the battery of 155-mm Long Toms, built in Kankad's own shops,\nwhich covered the road up the sloping rock-spine behind the city; the\nprinting-shop and book-bindery; the observatory, with a big telescope\nand an ingenious orrery of the Beta Hydrae system; the nuclear-power\nplant, part of the original price for giving up brigandage.\n\nHalf an hour before the ship from Konkrook was due, they had arrived\nat the airport, where a gang of Kragans were clearing a berth for the\n_Aldebaran_. From somewhere, Kankad produced two cold bottles of Cape\nTown beer for Paula and von Schlichten, and a bowl of some boiling-hot\nblack liquid for himself. Von Schlichten and Paula lit cigarettes;\nbetween sips of his bubbling hell-brew, Kankad gnawed on the stalk of\nsome swamp-plant. Paula seemed as much surprised at Kankad's disregard\nfor the eating taboo as she had been at von Schlichten's open flouting\nof the convention of concealment when he had put in his geek-speaker.\n\n\"This is the only place on Uller where this happens,\" von Schlichten\ntold her. \"Here, or in the field when Terran and Kragan soldiers are\ntogether. There aren't any taboos between us and the Kragans.\"\n\n\"No,\" Kankad said. \"We cannot eat each others' food, and because our\nbodies are different, we cannot be the fathers of each others' young.\nBut we have been battle-comrades, and worksharers, and we have learned\nfrom each other, my people more from yours than yours from mine.\nBefore you came, my people were like children, shooting arrows at\nlittle animals on the beach, and climbing among the rocks at\ndare-me-and-I-do, and playing war with toy weapons. But we are growing\nup, and it will not be long before we will stand beside you, as the\ngrown son stands beside his parent, and when that day comes, you will\nnot be ashamed of us.\"\n\nIt was easy to forget that Kankad had four arms and a rubbery,\nquartz-speckled skin, and a face like a lizard.\n\n\"I have always wished that some of your people could come to Terra, to\nstudy,\" von Schlichten said. \"I was talking about it with Sid\nHarrington, only a short while ago. He thinks it would be a good\nthing, for your people and for mine.\"\n\n\"Yes. I want Little Me, when he's old enough to travel, to visit your\nworld,\" Kankad said. \"And some of the other young ones. And when\nLittle Me is old enough to take over the rule of our people, I would\nlike to go to Terra, myself.\"\n\n\"Some day, I am going to return to Terra; I would like to have you\nmake the trip with me,\" von Schlichten said.\n\n\"That would be wonderful, Von!\" Kankad exclaimed. \"I want to see your\nworld, before I die. It must be a wonderful place. A world is what its\npeople make it, and your people must be able to make anything of your\nworld that you would want.\"\n\n\"We almost made a lifeless desert, like the poles of Uller, out of our\nworld, once,\" von Schlichten told him. \"Four hundred and more years\nago, we fought great wars among ourselves, with weapons such as I hope\nwill never even be thought of on Uller. Our whole Northern Hemisphere,\nwhere our greatest nations were, was devastated; much of it is\nwasteland to this day. But we put an end to that folly in time; we\nmade one nation out of all our people, and swore never to commit such\ncrimes again, and then we built the ships that took us out to the\nstars. But I want you to see our world, and some of the other worlds\nthat we have visited, I think you would like it.\"\n\n\"I know I would. And with you to tell me what the things I would see\nmeant....\" Kankad was silent for a moment. Then he spoke again,\nchanging the subject abruptly.\n\n\"I hope Paula will pardon me, but isn't Paula the kind of Terran that\nbears young?\"\n\n\"That's right, Kankad. I never bore any, yet, but that's the kind of\nTerran I am.\"\n\n\"I like Paula,\" Kankad said. \"She has come all the way from Terra to\nhelp us, and to learn about us. Of course, the Kragans don't need that\nkind of help, and the geeks, who would stick a knife in her as soon as\nshe turned her back on them, don't deserve it. But she wants to learn\nabout us, just as I want to learn about Terra. Von, why don't you and\nPaula have young?\" he asked. \"I think that would be fine. Then, Little\nPaula-Von and Little Me could be friends, long after the three of us\nare dead and gone.\"\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\nThe Bad News Came After the Coffee\n\n\nThe last clatter of silverware and dishes ceased as the native\nservants finished clearing the table. There was a remaining clatter of\ncups and saucers; liqueur-glasses tinkled, and an occasional\ncigarette-lighter clicked. At the head table, the voices seemed\nlouder.\n\n\"... don't like it a millisol's worth,\" Brigadier-General Barney\nMordkovitz, the Skilk military CO, was saying to the lady on his\nright. \"They're too confounded meek. Nowadays, nobody yells '_Znidd\nsuddabit!_' at you. Nobody sticks all four thumbs in his mouth and\nwaves his fingers. Nobody commits nuisance on the sidewalk in front of\nyou. They just stand and look at you like a farmer looking at a turkey\nthe week before Christmas, and that I don't like!\"\n\n\"Oh, bosh!\" Jules Keaveney, the Skilk Resident-Agent, at the head of\nthe table, exclaimed. \"You soldiers are all alike--begging your\npardon, General von Schlichten,\" he nodded in the direction of the\nguest of honor. \"If they don't bow and scrape to you and get off the\nsidewalk to let you pass, you say they're insolent and need a lesson.\nIf they do, you say they're plotting insurrection.\"\n\n\"What I said,\" Mordkovitz repeated, \"was that I expect a certain\namount of disorder, and a certain minimum show of hostility toward us\nfrom some of these geeks, to conform to what I know to be our\nunpopularity with many of them. When I don't find it, I want to know\nwhy.\"\n\n\"I'm inclined,\" von Schlichten came to his subordinate's support, \"to\nagree. This sudden absence of overt hostility is disquieting. Colonel\nCheng-Li,\" he called on the local Intelligence officer and\nConstabulary chief. \"This fellow Rakkeed was here, about a month ago.\nWas there any noticeable disorder at that time? Anti-Terran\ndemonstrations, attacks on Company property or personnel, shooting at\naircars, that sort of thing?\"\n\n\"No more than usual, general. In fact, it was when Rakkeed came here\nthat the condition General Mordkovitz was speaking of began to become\nconspicuous. We did catch some of Rakkeed's disciples trying to get in\namong the enlisted men of the Tenth N.U.N.I. and the Fifth Zirk\nCavalry and promote disaffection. That was reported at the time, sir.\"\n\n\"And acted upon, as far as the civil administration would permit,\" von\nSchlichten replied. \"And I might say that Lieutenant-Governor Blount\nhas reported from Keegark, where he is now, that the same unnatural\nabsence of hostility exists there.\"\n\n\"Well, of course, general,\" Keaveney said patronizingly. \"King Orgzild\nhas things under pretty tight control at Keegark. He'd not allow a few\nfanatics to do anything to prejudice these spaceport negotiations.\"\n\n\"I wonder if the idea back of that spaceport proposition isn't to get\nus concentrated at Keegark, where Orgzild could wipe us all out in one\nsurprise blow,\" somebody down the table suggested.\n\n\"Oh, Orgzild wouldn't be crazy enough to try anything like that,\"\nCommander Dirk Prinsloo, of the _Aldebaran_, declared. \"He'd get away\nwith it for just twelve months--the time it would take to get the\nnews to Terra and for a Federation Space Navy task-force to get here.\nAnd then, there'd be little bits of radioactive geek floating around\nthis system as far out as the orbit of Beta Hydrae VII.\"\n\n\"That's quite true,\" von Schlichten agreed. \"The point is, does\nOrgzild know it? I doubt if he even believes there is a Terra.\"\n\n\"Then where in Space does he think we come from?\" Keaveney demanded.\n\n\"I believe he thinks Niflheim is our home world,\" von Schlichten\nreplied. \"Or, rather, the string of orbiters and artificial satellites\naround Niflheim. Where he thinks Niflheim is, I wouldn't even try to\nguess.\"\n\n\"Well, it takes six months for a ship to go between here and Nif,\"\nPrinsloo considered. \"Because of the hyperdrive effects, the\nexperienced time of the voyage, inside the ship, is of the order of\nthree weeks. Taking that as the figure, he'd estimate the distance at\nabout a quarter-million miles, assuming the velocity as being the\nspeed of one of our contragravity-ships here on Uller. I'm assuming he\ndoesn't even know there is a hyperdrive.\"\n\n\"Yes. After he'd wiped us out, he might even consider the idea of an\ninvasion of Niflheim with captured contragravity ships,\" Hideyoshi\nO'Leary chuckled. \"That would be a big laugh--if any of us were alive,\nthen, to do any laughing.\"\n\n\"You don't really believe that, general?\" Keaveney asked. His tone was\nstill derisive, but under the derision was uncertainty. After all, von\nSchlichten had been on Uller for fifteen years, to his two.\n\n\"Any question of geek psychology is wide open as far as I'm concerned;\nthe longer I stay here, the less I understand it.\" Von Schlichten\nfinished his brandy and got out cigarette-case and lighter. \"I have\nan idea of the sort of garbled reports these spies of his who spend a\nyear on Niflheim as laborers bring back.\"\n\n\"You know the line Rakkeed's been taking, of course,\" Colonel Cheng-Li\nput in. \"He as much as says that Niflheim's our home, and that the\nfarms where we raise food here, and those evergreen plantings on Konk\nIsthmus and between here and Grank are the beginning of an attempt to\ndrive all native life from this planet and make it over for\nourselves.\"\n\n\"And that savage didn't think an idea like that up for himself; he got\nit from somebody like Orgzild,\" the black-bearded brigadier-general\nadded. \"You know, the main base off Niflheim is practically\nself-supporting, with hydroponic-gardens and animal-tissue culture\nvats. And it's enough bigger than one of the _City_ ships to pass for\na little world. Yes, somebody like Orgzild, or King Firkked here,\ncould easily pick up the idea that that's our home planet.\"\n\n\"But King Kankad was talking about....\" Paula Quinton began.\n\n\"We were speaking of geeks, not Kragans.\" Von Schlichten lit his\ncigarette and held his lighter for hers. \"You saw that big Beta Hydrae\norrery at Kankad's observatory. Well, there's quite a little story\nabout that. You know, it's generally realized by the natives here that\nUller is a globe. The North Zirks have ridden all the way around it,\non hipposaur-back, in the high latitudes, and the thalassic peoples at\nthe Equator have sailed all the five equatorial seas and portaged all\nthe isthmuses between. But, of course, Uller is the center of the\nuniverse; the sun travels around it, on a rather complicated\ndouble-spiral track. As a theory, it explains most of what they're\nable to observe, and any minor effects that don't conform to it are\njust ignored. They have a model, a most ingenious affair run by\nclockwork, at the University of Konkrook, to show the apparent\nmovement and position of Beta Hydrae in the sky; it does so fairly\naccurately.\n\n\"Well, some of our astronomers constructed this orrery, and exhibited\nit to a gathering of the leading native scholars, who are also the\nhigh-priests of the local religion. Sort of combined Academy of Arts\nand Sciences and College of Cardinals. They almost were massacred. As\nsoon as the assembled pundits saw this thing and grasped its meaning,\nthey began geeking and skreeking and yorking and squawking and\nbrandishing knives--it was blasphemous, and sacrilegious, and\nundermined the Faith, and invalidated the whole logic-system.\n\n\"I was brigadier-general, in command of Konkrook military district,\nthen--the post Them M'zangwe has now. When I got a riot-call from the\nUniversity, I hustled around with a company of Kragans, and we cleared\nthe hall with the bayonet and ran the reverend professors out onto the\ncampus, and after we got things in hand, the Kragans crowded around\nthe orrery, trying to set it up to show the existing position of the\nplanet relative to the primary and figure out the theory back of it.\nThey were very much interested; some of them must have sent word home\nabout it, because Kankad came in on the next ship, wanting to see it.\nHe was so much taken with it that Sid Harrington gave it to him. It's\none of his most cherished possessions, but the Konkrook pundits bite\nall four thumbs and wave their fingers every time they think of it.\"\nHe warmed his coffee from a controlled-temperature pot. \"You can't use\nKragan thinking on any subject as a criterion of what somebody like\nOrgzild's opinions will be.\"\n\n\"I never could understand the admiration some of you military people\nhave for those cutthroats,\" Keaveney declared. \"Oh, yes, I can. You\nlike them because they do your dirty work for you.\"\n\n\"He reads Stanley-Browne, too, I'll bet,\" Hideyoshi O'Leary said.\n\"Miss Quinton, how did you like your visit to Kankad's Town? Still\nthink the Kragans are cultural mongrels?\"\n\n\"Why, they're wonderful! I never expected anything like it. They just\nseem to have picked up everything they could from us, and then gone on\nfrom there to develop a culture of their own with our techniques. For\ninstance, those big guns, the ones they call the Ridge Battery, that\nthey built for themselves. They aren't copies of Terran guns. They\ndon't look like our work, or give you the feel our work would. And\nthat telescope at the observatory,\" she continued. \"Did they build\nthat, too?\"\n\n\"Yes, all we furnished was a couple of textbooks on lens-grinding and\ntelescope-design, and a book on optics. You see, when we made that\ndeal with them, they realized that we weren't any better fighters than\nthey were; we just had better weapons. To have the same kind of\nweapons, they'd have to learn to make them, and once they began\nstudying technology, they found that they had to study science.\nWeapon-making was the entering-wedge; after that, they found that they\ncould use the same skills to make anything else they wanted. Give them\nanother century or so and they'll be one of the great races of the\ngalaxy.\"\n\n\"Yes, and it's a good thing they're our friends, too,\" Mordkovitz\nadded. \"I'm only sorry there are so few of them, and so many of the\ngeeks.\"\n\n\"Yes, the Company ought to let us stockpile nuclear weapons here, just\nto be on the safe side,\" another officer, farther down the table,\nsaid.\n\n\"Well, I'm not exactly in favor of that,\" von Schlichten replied.\n\"It's the same principle as not allowing guards who have to go in\namong the convicts to carry firearms. If somebody like Orgzild got\nhold of a nuclear bomb, even a little old First-Century H-bomb, he\ncould use it for a model and construct a hundred like it, with all the\nplutonium we've been handing out for power reactors. And there are too\nfew of us, and we're concentrated in too few places, to last long if\nthat happened. What this planet needs, though, is a visit by a\nfifty-odd-ship task-force of the Space Navy, just to show the geeks\nwhat we have back of us. After a show like that, there'd be a lot less\n_znidd suddabit_ around here.\"\n\n\"General, I deplore that sort of talk,\" Keaveney said. \"I hear too\nmuch of this mailed-fist-and-rattling-saber stuff from some of the\njunior officers here, without your giving countenance and\nencouragement to it. We're here to earn dividends for the stockholders\nof the Uller Company, and we can only do that by gaining the\nfriendship, respect and confidence of the natives....\"\n\n\"Mr. Keaveney,\" Paula Quinton spoke up. \"I doubt if even you would\nseriously accuse the Extraterrestrials' Rights Association of favoring\nwhat you call a mailed-fist-and-rattling-saber policy. We've done\neverything in our power to help these people, and if anybody should\nhave their friendship, we should. Well, only five days ago, in\nKonkrook, Mr. Mohammed Ferriera and I were attacked by a mob, our\nnative aircar driver was murdered, and if it hadn't been for General\nvon Schlichten and his soldiers, we'd have lost our own lives. Mr.\nFerriera is still hospitalized as a result of injuries he received. It\nseems that General von Schlichten and his Kragans aren't trying to\nget friendship and confidence; they're willing to settle for respect,\nin the only way they can get it--by hitting harder and quicker than\nthe geeks can.\"\n\nSomebody down the table--one of the military, of course--said, \"Hear,\nhear!\" Von Schlichten came as close as a man wearing a monocle can to\nwinking at Paula. Good girl, he thought; she's started playing on the\nArmy team!\n\n\"Well, of course....\" Keaveney began. Then he stopped, as a Terran\nsergeant came up to the table and bent over Barney Mordkovitz'\nshoulder, whispering urgently. The black-bearded brigadier rose\nimmediately, taking his belt from the back of his chair and putting it\non. Motioning the sergeant to accompany him, he spoke briefly to\nKeaveney and then came around the table to where von Schlichten sat,\nthe Resident-Agent accompanying him.\n\n\"Message just came in from Konkrook, general,\" he said softly. \"Sid\nHarrington's dead.\"\n\nIt took von Schlichten all of a second to grasp what had been said.\n\"Good God! When? How?\"\n\n\"Here's all we know, sir,\" the sergeant said, giving him a radioprint\nslip. \"Came in ten minutes ago.\"\n\nIt was an all-station priority telecast. Governor-General Harrington\nhad died suddenly, in his room, at 2210; there were no details. He\nglanced at his watch; it was 2243. Konkrook and Skilk were in the same\ntime-zone; that was fast work. He handed the slip to Mordkovitz, who\ngave it to Keaveney.\n\n\"You from the telecast station, sergeant?\" he asked. \"All right, let's\ngo.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, general.\" Keaveney put out a hand to detain him as he\ntook his belt and put it on. \"How about this?\" He gestured nervously\nwith the radioprint slip.\n\n\"Get up and make an announcement, now,\" von Schlichten told him,\nfastening the buckle and hitching his pistol and survival-kit into\nplace. \"It'll be out all over the planet in half an hour. Never hold\nnews out unnecessarily.\" He stubbed out his cigarette. \"Come on,\nsergeant.\"\n\nAs he hurried from the banquet-room, he could hear Keaveney tapping on\nhis wine-glass.\n\n\"Everybody, please! Let me have your attention! There has just come in\na piece of the most tragic news....\"\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\nBismillah! How Dumb Can We Get?\n\n\nThe lights had come on inside the semicircular and now open\nstorm-porch of Company House, but it was still daylight outside. The\nsky above the mountain to the west was fading from crimson to\nburnt-orange, and a couple of the brighter stars were winking into\nvisibility. Von Schlichten and the sergeant hurried a hundred yards\ndown the street between low, thick-walled office buildings to the\ntelecast station, next to the Administration Building.\n\nA woman captain met him just inside the door of the big soundproofed\nroom.\n\n\"We have a wavelength open to Konkrook, general,\" she said. \"In booth\nthree.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Thank you, captain.... We've all lost a true friend,\nhaven't we?\"\n\nAnother girl, a tech-sergeant, was in the booth; on the screen was the\nimage of a third young woman, a lieutenant, at Konkrook station. The\nsergeant rose and started to leave the booth.\n\n\"Stick around, sergeant,\" von Schlichten told her. \"I'll want you to\ntake over when I'm through.\" He sat down in front of the combination\nvisiscreen and pickup. \"Now, lieutenant, just what happened?\" he\nasked. \"How did he die?\"\n\n\"We think it was poison, general. General M'zangwe has ordered autopsy\nand chemical analysis. If you can wait about ten minutes, he'll be\nable to talk to you, himself.\"\n\n\"Call him. In the meantime, give me everything you know.\"\n\n\"Well, the governor decided to go to bed early; he was going hunting\nin the morning. I suppose you know his usual routine?\"\n\nVon Schlichten nodded. Harrington would have taken a shower, put on\nhis dressing-gown, and then sat down at his desk, lighted his pipe,\npoured a drink of Terran bourbon, and begun to write his diary.\n\n\"Well, at 2210, give or take a couple of minutes, the Kragan\nguard-sergeant on that floor heard ten pistol-shots, as fast as they\ncould be fired semi-auto, in the governor's room. The door was locked,\nbut he shot it off with his own pistol and went in. He found Governor\nHarrington on the floor, wearing only his gown, holding an empty\npistol. He was in convulsions, frothing at the mouth, in horrible\npain. Evidently he'd fired his pistol, which he kept on his desk, to\ncall help; all the bullets had gone into the ceiling. The sergeant\npunched the emergency button, beside the bed, and reported, then tried\nto help the governor, but it was too late. One of the medics got there\nin five minutes, just as he was dying. He'd written his diary up to\nnoon of today, and broken off in the middle of a word. There was a\nbottle and an overturned glass on his desk. The Constabulary got there\na few minutes later, and then Brigadier-General M'zangwe took charge.\nA white rat, given fifteen drops from the whiskey-bottle, died with\nthe same symptoms in about ninety seconds.\"\n\n\"Who had access to the whiskey-bottle?\"\n\n\"A geek servant, who takes care of the room. He was caught, an hour\nearlier, trying to slip off the island without a pass; they were\nholding him at the guardhouse when Governor Harrington died. He's now\nbeing questioned by the Kragans.\" The girl's face was bleakly\nremorseless. \"I hope they do plenty to him!\"\n\n\"I hope they don't kill him before he talks.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, general; we have General M'zangwe, now,\" the girl\nsaid. \"I'll switch you over.\"\n\nThe screen broke into a kaleidoscopic jumble of color, then cleared;\nthe chocolate-brown face of Themistocles M'zangwe was looking out of\nit.\n\n\"I heard what happened, how they found him, and about that geek\nchamber-valet being arrested,\" von Schlichten said. \"Did you get\nanything out of him?\"\n\n\"He's admitted putting poison in the bottle, but he claims it was his\nown idea. But he's one of Father Keeluk's parishioners, so....\"\n\n\"Keeluk! God damn, so that was it!\" von Schlichten almost shouted.\n\"Now I know what he wanted with Stalin, and that goat, and those\nrabbits!\"\n\nFive thousand miles away, in Konkrook, Themistocles M'zangwe whistled.\n\n\"_Bismillah_! How dumb can we get?\" he cried. \"Of course they'd need\nterrestrial animals, to find out what would poison a Terran! Wait a\nminute; I'll make a note of that, to spring on this geek, if the\nKragans haven't finished him by now.\" Von Schlichten watched M'zangwe\npick up a stenophone and whisper into it for a moment. \"All right,\nCarlos, what else?\"\n\n\"Has Eric been notified?\"\n\n\"We called Keegark, but he's in audience with King Orgzild, and we\ncan't reach him.\"\n\n\"Well, who's in charge at Konkrook, now?\"\n\n\"Not much of anybody. Laviola, the Fiscal Secretary, and Hans\nMeyerstein, the Banking Cartel's lawyer, and Howlett, the Personnel\nChief, and Buhrmann, the Commercial Secretary, have made up a sort of\nquadrumvirate and are trying to run things. I don't know what would\nhappen if anything came up suddenly....\" A blue-gray uniformed arm,\nwith a major's cuff-braid, came into the screen, handing a slip of\npaper to M'zangwe; he took it, glanced at it, and swore. Von\nSchlichten waited until he had read it through.\n\n\"Well, something has, all right,\" the African said. \"We just got a\ncall from Jaikark's Palace--a revolt's broken out, presumably headed\nby Gurgurk; Household Guards either mutinied or wiped out by the\nmutineers, all but those twenty Kragan Rifles we loaned Jaikark. They,\nand about a dozen of Jaikark's courtiers and their personal retainers,\nare holding the approaches to the King's apartments. The\nnative-lieutenant in charge of the Kragans just radioed in; says the\nsituation is desperate.\"\n\n\"When a Kragan says that, he means damn near hopeless. Is this being\nrecorded?\" When M'zangwe nodded, he continued: \"All right. Use the\nrecording for your authority and take charge. I'm declaring martial\nrule at Konkrook, as of now, 2253. Tell Eric Blount what's happened,\nand what you've done, as soon as you can get in touch with him. I'm\nleaving for Konkrook at once; I ought to get in by 0800.\n\n\"Now, as to the trouble at the Palace. Don't commit more than one\ncompany of Kragans and ten airjeeps and four combat-cars, and tell\nthem to evacuate Jaikark and his followers and our Kragans to Gongonk\nIsland. And alert your whole force. These geek palace revolutions are\nalways synchronized with street-rioting, and this thing seems to have\nbeen synchronized with Sid Harrington's death, too. Get our Kragans\nout if you can't save anybody else from the Palace, but sacrificing\nthirty or forty men to save twenty is no kind of business. And keep\nsending reports; I can pick them up on my car radio as I come down.\"\nHe turned to the girl sergeant. \"Keep on this; there'll be more coming\nin.\"\n\nHe rose and left the booth. If we can pull Jaikark's bacon off the\nfire, he was thinking, the Company can dictate its own terms to him\nafterward; if Jaikark's killed, we'll have Gurgurk's head off for it,\nand then take over Konkrook. In either case, it'll be a long step\ntoward getting rid of all these geek despots. And with Eric Blount as\nGovernor-General....\n\nThe girl captain in charge of the station met him as he came out.\n\n\"Poison,\" he told her. \"A geek servant did the job, on orders from\nGurgurk and possibly Rakkeed. Gurgurk's started a putsch against King\nJaikark; I'm going to Konkrook at once. Call the military airport and\nhave my command-car brought to Company House.\"\n\nHarry Quong and Hassan Bogdanoff had been at the banquet, too; on a\nworld of lizard-faced silicate-eaters, the social difference between a\nhuman general and a human aircar-driver was almost infinitesimal. He'd\nhave to talk to Barney Mordkovitz, too; when word of events at\nKonkrook got out among the local geeks, as it probably had already....\n\nThe inner door of the soundproofed telecast-room burst open, three men\nhurried inside, and it slammed shut behind them. In the brief\ninterval, there had been firing audible from outside. One of the men\nhad a pistol in his right hand, and with his left arm he supported a\ncompanion, whose shoulder was mangled and dripped blood. The third man\nhad a burp-gun in his hands. All were in civilian dress-shorts and\nlight jackets. The man with the pistol holstered it and helped his\ninjured companion into a chair. The burp-gunner advanced into the\nroom, looked around, saw von Schlichten, and addressed him.\n\n\"General! The geeks turned on us!\" he cried. \"The Tenth North Uller's\nmutinied; they're running wild all over the place. They've taken their\nbarracks and supply-buildings, and the lorry-hangars and the\nmaintenance-yard; they're headed this way in a mob. Some of the Zirk\nCavalry's joined them.\"\n\n\"How about the Kragans?\"\n\n\"The Eighteenth Rifles? They're with us. I saw a party of them firing\ninto the mob; I saw some of the Tenth N.U.N.I. tossing a dead Kragan\non their bayonets....\"\n\n\"Have any ammo left for that burp-gun? Come on, then; let's see what\nit's like at Company House,\" von Schlichten said. \"Captain Malavez,\nyou know what to do about defending this station. Get busy doing it.\nAnd have that girl in booth three tell Konkrook what's happened here,\nand say that I won't be coming down, as planned, just yet.\"\n\nHe opened the door, and the rattle of shots outside became audible\nagain. The civilian with the burp-gun knew better than to let a\ngeneral go out first; elbowing von Schlichten out of the way, he\ncrouched over his weapon and dashed outside. Drawing his pistol, von\nSchlichten followed, pulling the door shut after him.\n\nDarkness had fallen, while he had been inside; now the whole Company\nReservation was ablaze with electric lights. Somebody at the\npower-plant--either the regular staff, if they were still holding, or\nthe mutineers, if they had taken it--had thrown on the emergency\nlights. There was a confused mass of gray-skinned figures in front of\nCompany House, reflected light twinkling on steel over them; from the\ndirection of the native-troops barracks more natives were coming on\nthe run. On the roof of a building across the street, two machine-guns\nwere already firing into the mob. A group of Terrans came running out\nof a roadway between two buildings, from the direction of the\nrepair-shops; several of them paused to fire behind them with pistols.\nThey started toward Company House, saw what was going on there, and\nveered, darting into the door of the building from which the\nauto-weapons were firing. From up the street, a hundred-odd\nsaurian-faced native soldiers were coming at the double, bayonets\nfixed and rifles at high port; with them ran several Terrans.\nMotioning his companion to follow, von Schlichten ran to meet them,\nfalling in beside a Terran captain who ran in front.\n\n\"What's the score, captain?\" he asked.\n\n\"Tenth North Uller and the Fifth Cavalry have mutinied; so have these\nrag-tag Auxiliaries. That mob down there's part of them.\" He was\npuffing under the double effort of running and talking. \"Whole thing\nblew up in seconds; no chance to communicate with anybody....\"\n\nA Terran woman, in black slacks and an orange sweater, ran across the\nstreet in front of them, pursued by a group of enlisted \"men\" of the\nTenth North Uller Native Infantry, all shrieking \"_Znidd suddabit!_\"\nThe fugitive ran into a doorway across the street; before her pursuers\nwere aware of their danger, the Kragans had swept over them. There was\nno shooting; the slim, cruel-bladed bayonets did the work. From behind\nhim, as he ran, von Schlichten could hear Kragan voices in a new cry:\n\"_Znidd geek! Znidd geek!_\"\n\nThe mob were swarming up onto the steps and into the semi-rotunda of\nthe storm-porch. There was shooting, which told him that some of the\nhumans who had been at the banquet were still alive. He wondered,\nhalf-sick, how many, and whether they could hold out till he could\nclear the doorway, and, most of all, he found himself thinking of\nPaula Quinton. Skidding to a stop within fifty yards of the mob, he\nflung out his arms crucifix-wise to halt the Kragans. Behind, he could\nhear the Terrans and native-officers shouting commands to form front.\n\n\"Give them one clip, reload, and then give them the bayonet!\" he\nordered. \"Shove them off the steps and then clear the porch!\"\n\n\"One clip, fire, and reload, at will!\" somebody passed it on in\nKragan.\n\nThe hundred rifles let go all at once, and for five seconds they\npoured a deafening two thousand rounds into the mutineers. There was\nsome fire in reply; a Zirk corporal narrowly missed him with a pistol,\nhe saw the captain's head fly apart when an explosive rifle-bullet hit\nhim, and half a dozen Kragans went down.\n\n\"Reload! Set your safeties!\" von Schlichten bellowed. \"Charge!\"\n\nUnder human officers, the North Uller Native Infantry would have stood\nfirm. Even under their native-officers and sergeants, they should not\nhave broken as they did, but the best of these had paid for their\nloyalty to the Company with their lives, and the rest had destroyed\ntheir authority by revolting against the source from which it was\nderived. At that, the Skilkan peasantry who made up the Tenth Infantry\nand the Zirk cavalrymen tried briefly to fight as individuals,\nshrieking \"_Znidd suddabit!_\" until the Kragans were upon them,\nstabbing and shooting. They drove the rioters from the steps or killed\nthem there, they wiped out those who had gotten into the semicircle of\nthe storm-porch. The inside doors, von Schlichten saw, were open, but\nbeyond them were Terrans and a dozen or so Kragans. Hideyoshi O'Leary\nand Barney Mordkovitz seemed to be in command of these.\n\n\"We had about thirty seconds' warning,\" Mordkovitz reported, \"and the\nKragans in the hall bought us another sixty seconds. Of course, we all\nhad our pistols....\"\n\n\"Hey! These storm-doors are wedged!\" somebody discovered. \"Those\ngoddam geek servants ...!\"\n\n\"Yeah, kill any of them you catch,\" somebody else advised. \"If we\ncould have gotten these doors closed....\"\n\nThe mob, driven from the steps, was trying to reform and renew the\nattack. From up the street, the machine-guns, silent during the\nbayonet-fight, began hammering again. The mob surged forward to get\nout of their fire, and were met by a rifle-blast and a hedge of\nbayonets at the steps; they surged back, and the machine-guns flailed\nthem again. They started to rush the building from whence the\nautomatic-fire came, and there was a fusillade and a shriek of \"_Znidd\ngeek!_\" from up the street. They turned and fled in the direction from\nwhence they had come, bullets scourging them from three directions at\nonce.\n\nFor a moment, von Schlichten and the three Terrans and eighty-odd\nKragans who had survived the fight stood on the steps, weapons poised,\nseeking more enemies. The machine-guns up the street stuttered a few\nshort bursts and were silent. From behind, the beleaguered Terrans and\ntheir Kragan guards were emerging. He saw Jules Keaveney and his wife,\nCommander Prinsloo of the _Aldebaran_, Harry Quong and Bogdanoff. Ah,\nthere she was! He heaved a breath of relief and waved to her.\n\nThe Kragans were already setting about their after-battle chores.\nAbout twenty of them spread out on guard; the others, by fours, went\ninto the street, one covering with his rifle while the other three\nchecked on their own casualties, used the short, leaf-shaped swords\nthey carried to slash off the heads of enemy wounded, and collected\nweapons and ammunition. A couple of hundred more Kragans, led by\nNative-Major Kormork, the co-parent of young with King Kankad, came up\nat the double and stopped in front of Company House.\n\n\"We were in quarters, aboard the _Aldebaran_ and in the guesthouse at\nthe airport,\" Kormork reported. \"We were attacked, fifteen minutes\nago, by a mob. We took ten minutes beating them off, and five more\ngetting here. I sent Native-Captain Zeerjeek and the rest of the force\nto retake the supply-depot and the shops and lorry hangars, which had\nbeen taken, and relieve the military airport, which is under attack.\"\n\nThere was still firing from the commercial airport and the smaller\nmilitary airfield. Once there was a string of heavy explosions that\nsounded like 80-mm rockets.\n\n\"Good enough. I hope you didn't spread yourself out too thin. What's\nthe situation at the commercial airport?\"\n\n\"The two ships, the _Aldebaran_ and the freighter _Northern Star_, are\nboth safe,\" Kormork replied. \"I saw them go on contragravity and rise\nto about a hundred feet.\"\n\n\"Whose crowd is that you have?\" he asked the Terran lieutenant who had\ntaken over command of the first force of Kragans.\n\n\"Company 6, Eighteenth Rifles, sir. We were on duty at the guardhouse;\nfighting broke out in the direction of the native barracks. A couple\nof runners from Captain Retief of Company 4 came in with word that he\nwas being attacked by mutineers from the Tenth N.U.N.I. but that he\nwas holding them back. So Captain Charbonneau, who was killed a few\nminutes ago, left a Terran lieutenant and a Kragan native-lieutenant\nand a couple of native-sergeants and thirty Kragans to hold the\nguardhouse, and brought the rest of us here.\"\n\nVon Schlichten nodded. \"You'd pass the military airport and the\npower-plant, wouldn't you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir. The military airport's holding out, and I saw the\nred-and-yellow danger-lights on the fence around the power-plant.\"\n\nThat meant the power-plant was, for the time, safe; somebody'd turned\ntwenty thousand volts into the fence.\n\n\"All right. I'm setting up my command post at the telecast station,\nwhere the communication equipment is.\" He turned to the crowd that had\ncome out onto the porch from inside. \"Where's Colonel Cheng-Li?\"\n\n\"Here, general.\" The Intelligence and Constabulary officer pushed\nthrough the crowd. \"I was on the phone, talking to the military\nairport, the commercial airport, ordnance depot, spaceport, ship-docks\nand power-plant. All answer. I'm afraid Pop Goode, at the city\npower-plant, is done for; nobody answers there, but the TV-pickup is\nstill on in the load-dispatcher's room, and the place is full of\ngeeks. Colonel Jarman's coming here with a lorry to get combat-car\ncrews; he's short-handed. Port-Captain Leavitt has all the native\nlabor at the airport and spaceport herded into a repair dock; he's\nkeeping them covered with the forward 90-mm gun of the _Northern\nStar_. Lorry-hangars, repair-shops and maintenance-yards don't\nanswer.\"\n\n\"That's what I was going to ask you. Good enough. Harry Quong, Hassan\nBogdanoff!\"\n\nHis command-car crew front-and-centered.\n\n\"I want you to take Colonel O'Leary up, as soon as my car's brought\nhere.... Hid, you go up and see what's going on. Drop flares where\nthere isn't any light. And take a look at the native-labor camp and\nthe equipment-park, south of the reservation.... Kormork, you take all\nyour gang, and half these soldiers from the Eighteenth, here, and help\nclear the native-troops barracks. And don't bother taking any\nprisoners; we can't spare personnel to guard them.\"\n\nKormork grinned. The taking of prisoners had always been one of those\nirrational Terran customs which no Ulleran regarded with favor, or\neven comprehension.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\nAuthority of Governor-General von Schlichten\n\n\nThere was fresh intelligence from Konkrook, by the time he returned to\nthe telecast station. Mutiny had broken out there among the laborers\nand native troops, who outnumbered the Terrans and their Kragan\nmercenaries on Gongonk Island by five thousand to five hundred and\nfifteen hundred respectively. The attempt to relieve Jaikark's palace\nhad been called off before the relief-force could be sent; there was\nheavy and confused fighting all over the island, and most of the\ncombat contragravity and about half the Kragan Rifles had had to be\ncommitted to defend the Company farms across the Channel, on the\nmainland, south of the city. There had also been an urgent call for\nhelp from Colonel Rodolfo MacKinnon, in command of Company troops at\nthe Keegark Residency, and another from the Residency at Kwurk, one of\nthe Free Cities on the eastern shore of Takkad Sea.\n\nHe called Keegark; a girl, apparently one of the civilian telecast\ntechnicians, answered.\n\n\"We must have help, General von Schlichten,\" she told him. \"The native\ntroops, all but two hundred Kragans, have mutinied. They have\neverything here except Company House--docks, airport, everything.\nWe're trying to hold out, but there are thousands of them. Our Takkad\nNative Infantry, soldiers of King Orgzild's army, and townspeople.\nThey all seem to have firearms....\"\n\n\"What happened to Eric Blount and your Resident-Agent, Mr. Lemoyne?\"\n\n\"We don't know. They were at the Palace, talking to King Orgzild.\nWe've tried to call the Palace, but we can't get through, general, we\nmust have help....\"\n\nA call came in, a few minutes later, from Krink, five hundred miles to\nthe northeast across the mountains; the Resident-Agent there, one\nFrancis Xavier Shapiro, reported rioting in the city and an attempted\npalace-revolution against King Jonkvank, and that the Residency was\nunder attack. By way of variety, it was the army of King Jonkvank that\nhad mutinied; the Sixth North Uller Native Infantry and the two\ncompanies of Zirk cavalry at Krink were still loyal, along with the\nKragans.\n\nThere was a pattern to all this. Von Schlichten stood staring at the\nbig map, on the wall, showing the Takkad Sea area at the Equatorial\nZone, and the country north of it to the pole, the area of Uller\noccupied by the Company. He was almost beginning to discern the\nunderlying logic of the past half-hour's events when Keaveney, the\nSkilk Resident, blundered into him in a half-daze.\n\n\"Sorry, general, didn't see you.\" His face was ashen, and his jowls\nsagged. Von Schlichten wondered if there could be another spectacle so\nwoe-begone as a back-slapping extrovert with the bottom knocked out of\nhim. \"My God, it's happening all over Uller! Not just here at Skilk;\neverywhere where we have a residency or a trading-station. Why, it's\nthe end of all of us!\"\n\n\"It's not quite that bad, Mr. Keaveney.\" He looked at his watch. It\nwas now nearly an hour since the native troops here at Skilk had\nmutinied. Insurrections like this usually succeeded or failed in the\nfirst hour. It was a little early to be certain, but he was beginning\nto suspect that this one hadn't succeeded. \"If we all do our part,\nwe'll come out of it all right,\" he told Keaveney, more cheerfully\nthan he felt, then turned to ask Brigadier-General Mordkovitz how the\nfighting was going at the native-troops barracks.\n\n\"Not badly, general. Colonel Jarman's got some contragravity up and\nworking. They blew out all four of the Tenth N.U.N.I.'s barracks; the\nTenth and the Zirks are trying to defend the cavalry barracks. Some of\nour Kragans managed to slip around behind the cavalry stables. They're\nleading out hipposaurs, and sniping at the rear of the cavalry\nbarracks.\"\n\n\"That'll give us some cavalry of our own; a lot of these Kragans are\ngood riders.... How about the repair-shops and maintenance-yard and\nlorry-hangars? I don't want these geeks getting hold of that equipment\nand using it against us.\"\n\n\"Kormork's outfit are trying to take back the lorry-hangars. Jarman's\ngot a couple of airjeeps and a combat-car helping them.\"\n\n\"... won't be one of us left by this time tomorrow,\" Keaveney was\nwailing, to Paula Quinton and another woman. \"And the Company is\nfinished!\"\n\n\"We'd better get him a drink, or a cup of coffee, general,\" Mordkovitz\nsuggested. \"With a knockout-drop in it.\"\n\nColonel Cheng-Li, the Intelligence officer, seemed to have somewhat\nthe same idea. He approached Keaveney and tried to quiet him. At the\nsame time, a woman in black slacks and an orange sweater--the one\nwhose pursuers had been overrun by the Kragans at the beginning of\nthe fighting--approached von Schlichten.\n\n\"General, King Kankad's calling,\" she said. \"He's on the screen in\nbooth four.\"\n\n\"Right.\" To avoid any possibility of misunderstanding, he slipped his\ngeek-speaker into his mouth before entering the booth. Kankad's face\nwas looking out of the screen at him, with Phil Yamazaki, the telecast\noperator at Kankad's Town, standing behind him.\n\n\"Von!\" The Kragan spoke almost as though in physical pain. \"What can I\ndo to help? I have twenty thousand of my people here who are capable\nof bearing arms, all with firearms, but I have transport for only five\nhundred. Where shall I send them?\"\n\nVon Schlichten thought quickly. Keegark was finished; the Residency\nstood in the middle of the city, surrounded by two hundred thousand of\nKing Orgzild's troops and subjects. Since Ullerans were bisexual, the\ntotal population, less the senile, crippled, and very young, was the\nmilitary potential. Sending Kankad's five hundred warriors and his\nmeager contragravity there would be the same as shoveling them into a\nfurnace. The people at Keegark would have to be written off, like the\ntwenty Kragans at Jaikark's palace.\n\n\"Send them to Konkrook,\" he decided. \"Them M'zangwe's in command,\nthere; he'll need help to hold the Company farms. Maybe he can find\nadditional transport for you. I'll call him.\"\n\n\"I'll send off what force I can, at once,\" Kankad promised. \"How does\nit go with you at Skilk?\"\n\n\"We're holding, so far,\" he replied. \"Paula is with me, here; she\nsends her friendship.\"\n\nCaptain Inez Malavez, the woman officer in charge of the station, put\nher head into the booth.\n\n\"General! Immediate-urgency message from Colonel O'Leary,\" she said.\n\"Native laborers from the mine-labor camp are pouring into the\nmine-equipment park. Colonel O'Leary's used all his rockets and\nMG-ammunition trying to stop them.\"\n\n\"Call you back, later,\" von Schlichten told Kankad. \"I'll see what\nThem M'zangwe can do about transport; get what force you can started\nfor Konkrook at once.\"\n\nHe left the booth, removing his geek-speaker. \"Barney!\" he called.\n\"General Mordkovitz! Who's the ranking officer in direct contact with\nthe Eighteenth Rifles? Major Falkenberg?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Well, tell him to get as many of his Kragans as he can spare down to\nthe equipment-park.\" He turned to Inez Malavez. \"You call Jarman; tell\nhim what O'Leary reported, and tell him to get cracking on it. Tell\nhim not to let those geeks get any of that equipment onto\ncontragravity; knock it down as fast as they try to lift out with it.\nAnd tell him to see what he can do in the way of troop-carriers or\nlorries, to get Falkenberg's Rifles to the equipment-park.... How's\nbusiness at the lorry-hangars and maintenance-yard?\"\n\n\"Kormork's still working on that,\" the girl captain told him. \"Nothing\ndefinite, yet.\"\n\nIn one corner of the big room, somebody had thumbtacked a\nten-foot-square map of the Company area to the floor. Paula Quinton\nand Mrs. Jules Keaveney were on their knees beside it, pushing out\nhandfuls of little pink and white pills that somebody had brought in\ntwo bottles from the dispensary across the road, each using a\nbilliard-bridge. The girl in the orange sweater had a handful of\nscribbled notes, and was telling them where to push the pills. There\nwere other objects on the map, too--pistol-cartridges, and cigarettes,\nand foil-wrapped food-concentrate wafers. Paula, seeing him,\nstraightened.\n\n\"The pink are ours, general,\" she said. \"The white are the geeks.\" Von\nSchlichten suppressed a grin; that was the second time he'd heard her\nuse that word, this evening. \"The cigarettes are airjeeps, the\ncartridges are combat-cars, and the wafers are lorries or\ntroop-carriers.\"\n\n\"Not exactly regulation map-markers, but I've seen stranger things\nused.... Captain Malavez!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" The girl captain, rushing past, her hands full of\nteleprint-sheets, stopped in mid-stride.\n\n\"What we need,\" he told her, \"is a big TV-screen, and a pickup mounted\non some sort of a contragravity vehicle at about two to five thousand\nfeet directly overhead, to give us an image of the whole area. Can\ndo?\"\n\n\"Can try, sir. We have an eight-foot circular screen that ought to do\nall right for two thousand feet. I'll implement that at once.\"\n\nGoing into a temporarily idle telecast booth, he called Konkrook.\nFirst he spoke to a civilian who chewed a dead cigar, and then he got\nThemistocles M'zangwe on the screen.\n\n\"How is it, now?\" he asked.\n\n\"Getting a little better,\" the Graeco-African replied. \"Half an hour\nago, we were shooting geeks out the windows, here; now we have them\ncontained between the spaceport and the native-troops and labor\nbarracks, and down the east side of the island to the farms. We have\nthe wire around the farms on the island electrified, and we're using\nalmost all our combat contragravity to keep the farms on the mainland\nclear.\" He hesitated for a moment. \"Did you hear about Eric and\nLemoyne?\"\n\nVon Schlichten shook his head.\n\n\"We just got a call from Rodolfo MacKinnon. He took a couple of\nprisoners and made them talk. The whole party that were at Orgzild's\npalace were massacred. Some of them were lucky enough to get killed\nfighting. The geeks took Eric and Hendrik alive; rolled them in a\npuddle of thermoconcentrate fuel and set fire to them. When we can\nspare the contragravity, we're going to drop something on the Kee-geek\nembassy, over in town.\"\n\n\"Well, that was what I wanted to call you about--contragravity.\" He\ntold M'zangwe about King Kankad's offer. \"His crowd ought to be coming\nin in a couple of hours. What can you scrape up to send to Kankad's\nTown to airlift Kragans in?\"\n\n\"Well, we have three hundred-and-fifty-foot gun-cutters, one 90-mm gun\napiece. The _Elmoran_, the _Gaucho_, and the _Bushranger_. But they're\nnot much as transports, and we need them here pretty badly. Then, we\nhave five fertilizer and charcoal scows, and a lot of heavy transport\nlorries, and two one-eighty-foot pickup boats.\"\n\n\"How about the _Piet Joubert_?\" von Schlichten asked. \"She was due in\nKonkrook from the east about 1300 today, wasn't she?\"\n\nM'zangwe swore. \"She got in, all right. But the geeks boarded her at\nthe dock, within twenty minutes after things started. They tried to\nlift out with her, and the Channel Battery shot her down into Konkrook\nChannel, off the Fifty Sixth Street docks.\"\n\n\"Well, you couldn't let the geeks have her, to use against us. What do\nyou hear from the other ships?\"\n\n\"_Procyon_'s at Grank; we haven't had any reports of any kind from\nthere, which doesn't look so good. The _Northern Lights_ is at Grank,\ntoo. The _Oom Paul Kruger_ should have been at Bwork, in the east,\nwhen the gun went off. And the _Jan Smuts_ and the _Christiaan De\nWett_ were both at Keegark; we can assume Orgzild has both of them.\"\n\n\"All right. I'm sending _Aldebaran_ to Kankad's, to pick up more\nreenforcements for you.\"\n\n\"We can use them! And with _Aldebaran_, we ought to be able to take\nthe offensive against the city by this time tomorrow. Anything else?\"\n\n\"Not at the moment. I'll see about getting _Aldebaran_ sent off, now.\"\n\nLeaving the booth, he heard, above the clatter of\ncommunications-machines and hubbub of voices, Jules Keaveney arguing\ncontentiously. Evidently Colonel Cheng-Li's efforts to drag the\nResident out of his despondency had been an excessive success.\n\n\"But it's crazy! Not just here; everywhere on Uller!\" Keaveney was\nsaying. \"How did they do it? They have no telecast equipment.\"\n\n\"You have me stopped, Jules,\" Mordkovitz was replying. \"I know a lot\nof rich geeks have receiving sets, but no sending sets.\"\n\nThe pattern that had been tantalizing von Schlichten took visible\nshape in his mind. For a moment, he shelved the matter of the\n_Aldebaran_.\n\n\"They didn't need sending equipment, Barney,\" he said. \"They used\nours.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Keaveney challenged.\n\n\"Look what happened. Sid Harrington was poisoned in Konkrook. The\nnews, of course, was sent out at once, as the geeks knew it would be,\nto every residency and trading-station on Uller, and that was the\nsignal they'd agreed upon, probably months in advance. All they had to\ndo was have that geek servant put poison in Harrington's whiskey, and\nwe did the rest.\"\n\n\"Well, what was our intelligence doing--sleeping?\" Keaveney demanded\nangrily.\n\n\"No, they were writing reports for your civil administration blokes to\nstuff in the wastebasket, and being called mailed-fist-and-rattling-saber\nalarmists for their pains.\" He turned away from Keaveney. \"Barney, where's\nDirk Prinsloo?\"\n\n\"Aboard his ship. He hitched a ride to the airport with Jarman, when\nhe was here picking up air-crews.\"\n\n\"Call him. Tell him to take the _Aldebaran_ to Kankad's Town, at once;\nas soon as he arrives there, which ought to be about 1100, he's to\npick up all the Kragans he can pack aboard and take them to Konkrook.\nFrom then on, he'll be under Them M'zangwe's orders.\"\n\n\"To Konkrook?\" Keaveney fairly howled. \"Are you nuts? Don't you think\nwe need reenforcements here, too?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do. I'm going to try to get them,\" von Schlichten told him.\n\"Now pipe down and get out of people's way.\"\n\nHe crossed the room, to where two Kragans, a male sergeant, and the\nubiquitous girl in the orange sweater were struggling to get a big\ncircular TV-screen up, then turned to look at the situation-map. A\ngirl tech-sergeant was keeping Paula Quinton and Mrs. Jules Keaveney\ninformed.\n\n\"Start pushing geeks out of the Fifth Zirk Cavalry barracks,\" the\nsergeant was saying. \"The one at the north end, and the one next to\nit; they're both on fire, now.\" She tossed a slip into the wastebasket\nbeside her and glanced at the next slip. \"And more pink pills back of\nthe barracks and stables, and move them a little to the northwest;\nKragans as skirmishers, to intercept geeks trying to slip away from\nthe cavalry barracks.\"\n\n\"Though why we want to do that, I don't know,\" Mrs. Keaveney said,\npushing out a handful of pink pills with her billiard-bridge. \"Let\nthem go, and good riddance!\"\n\n\"I never did like this bridge-of-silver-for-a-fleeing-enemy idea,\"\nPaula Quinton said, evicting token-mutineers from the two northern\nbarracks. \"There's usually two-way traffic on bridges. Kill them here\nand we won't have to worry about keeping them out.\"\n\nOf course, it was easy to be bloodthirsty about pink pills and white\npills. Once, on a three-months' reaction-drive voyage from Yggdrasill\nto Loki, he had taught a couple of professors of extraterrestrial\nzoology to play _kriegspiel_, and before the end of the trip, he was\nbeing horrified by the callous disregard they showed for casualties.\nBut little Paula had the right idea; dead enemies don't hit back.\n\nA young Kragan with his lower left arm in a sling and a daub of\nantiseptic plaster over the back of his head came up and gave him a\nradioprint slip. Guido Karamessinis, the Resident-Agent at Grank, had\nreported, at last. The city, he said, was quiet, but King Yoorkerk's\ntroops had seized the Company airport and docks, taken the _Procyon_\nand the _Northern Lights_ and put guards aboard them, and were\nsurrounding the Residency. He wanted to know what to do.\n\nVon Schlichten managed to get him on the screen, after a while.\n\n\"It looks as though Yoorkerk's trying to play both sides at once,\" he\ntold the Grank Resident. \"If the rebellion's put down, he'll come\nforward as your friend and protector; if we're wiped out elsewhere,\nhe'll yell '_Znidd suddabit!_' and swamp you. Don't antagonize him; we\ncan't afford to fight this war on any more fronts than we are now.\nWe'll try to do something to get you unfrozen, before long.\"\n\nHe called Krink again. A girl with red-gold hair and a dusting of\nfreckles across her nose answered.\n\n\"How are you making out?\" he asked.\n\n\"So far, fine, general. We're in complete control of the Company area,\nand all our native troops, not just the Kragans, are with us.\nJonkvank's pushed the mutineers out of his palace, and we're keeping\nopen a couple of streets between there and here. We air-lifted all our\nKragans and half the Sixth N.U.N.I. to the Palace, and we have the\nZirks patrolling the streets on 'saurback. Now, we have our lorries\nand troop-carriers out picking up elements of Jonkvank's loyal troops\noutside town.\"\n\n\"Who's doing the rioting, then?\"\n\nShe named three of Jonkvank's regiments. \"And the city hoodlums, and\npriests from the temples of one sect that followed Rakkeed, and\nSkilkan fifth columnists. Mr. Shapiro can give you the details. Shall\nI call him?\"\n\n\"Never mind. He's probably busy, he's not as easy on the eyes as you\nare, and you're doing all right.... How long do you think it'd take,\nwith the equipment you have, to airlift all of Jonkvank's loyal troops\ninto the city?\"\n\n\"Not before this time tomorrow.\"\n\n\"All right. Are you in radio communication with Jonkvank now?\"\n\n\"Full telecast, audio-visual,\" the girl replied. \"Just a minute,\ngeneral.\"\n\nHe put in his geek-speaker. The screen exploded into multi-colored\nlight, then cleared. Within a few minutes, a saurian Ulleran face was\nlooking out of it at him--a harsh-lined, elderly face, with an old\nscar, quartz-crusted, along one side.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" von Schlichten greeted him.\n\nJonkvank pronounced something intended to correspond to von\nSchlichten's name. \"We have image-met under sad circumstances,\ngeneral,\" he said.\n\n\"Sad for both of us, King Jonkvank; we must help one another. I am\ntold that your soldiers in Krink have risen against you, and that your\nloyal troops are far from the city.\"\n\n\"Yes. That was the work of my War Minister, Hurkkurk, who was in the\npay of King Firkked of Skilk, may Jeels devour him alive! I have\nHurkkurk's head here somewhere, if you want to see it, but that will\nnot bring my loyal soldiers to Krink any sooner.\"\n\n\"Dead traitors' heads do not interest me, King Jonkvank,\" von\nSchlichten replied, in what he estimated that the Krinkan king would\ninterpret as a tone of cold-blooded cruelty. \"There are too many\ntraitors' heads still on traitors' shoulders.... What regiments are\nloyal to you, and where are they now?\"\n\nJonkvank began naming regiments and locating them, all at minor\nprovincial towns at least a hundred miles from Krink.\n\n\"Hurkkurk did his work well; I'm afraid you killed him too\nmercifully,\" von Schlichten said. \"Well, I'm sending the _Northern\nStar_ to Krink. She can only bring in one regiment at a trip, the way\nthey're scattered; which one do you want first?\"\n\nJonkvank's mouth, until now compressed grimly, parted in a gleaming\nsmile. He made an exclamation of pleasure which sounded rather like a\nboy running along a picket fence with a stick.\n\n\"Good, general! Good!\" he cried. \"The first should be the regiment\nMurderers, at Furnk; they all have rifles like your soldiers. Have\nthem brought to the Great Square, at the Palace here. And then, the\nregiment Fear-Makers, at Jeelznidd, and the regiment Corpse-Reapers,\nat....\"\n\n\"Let that go until the Murderers are in,\" von Schlichten advised.\n\"They're at Furnk, you say? I'll send the _Northern Star_ there,\ndirectly.\"\n\n\"Oh, good, general! I will not soon forget this! And as soon as the\nwork is finished here, I will send soldiers to help you at Skilk.\nThere shall be a great pile of the heads of those who had part in this\nwickedness, both here and there!\"\n\n\"Good. Now, if you will pardon me, I'll go to give the necessary\norders....\"\n\nAs he left the booth, he saw Hideyoshi O'Leary in front of the\nsituation-map, and hailed him.\n\n\"Harry and Hassan are getting the car re-ammoed; they dropped me off\nhere. Want to come up with us and see the show?\"\n\n\"No, I want you to go to Krink, as soon as Harry brings the car here\nagain.\" He told O'Leary what he intended doing. \"You'll probably have\nto go around ahead of the _Star_ and alert these regiments. And as\nsoon as things stabilize at Krink, prod Jonkvank into airlifting\ntroops here. You're authorized, in my name, to promise Jonkvank that\nhe can assume political control at Skilk, after we've stuffed\nFirkked's head in the dustbin.\"\n\nJules Keaveney, who always seemed to be where he wasn't wanted, heard\nthat and fairly screamed.\n\n\"General von Schlichten! That is a political decision! You have no\nauthority to make promises like that; that is a matter for the\nGovernor-General, at least!\"\n\n\"Well, as of now, and until a successor to Sid Harrington can be sent\nhere from Terra, I'm Governor-General,\" von Schlichten told him,\nmentally thanking Keaveney for reminding him of the necessity for such\na step. \"Captain Malavez! You will send out an all-station telecast,\nimmediately: Military Commander-in-Chief Carlos von Schlichten, being\ninformed of the deaths of both Governor-General Harrington and\nLieutenant-Governor Blount, assumes the duties of Governor-General, as\nof 0001 today.\" He turned to Keaveney. \"Does that satisfy you?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"No, it doesn't. You have no authority to assume a civil position of\nany sort, let alone the very highest position....\"\n\nVon Schlichten unbuttoned his holster and took out his authority,\nletting Keaveney look into the muzzle of it.\n\n\"Here it is,\" he said. \"If you're wise, don't make me appeal to it.\"\n\nKeaveney shrugged. \"I can't argue with that,\" he said. \"But I don't\nfancy the Uller Company is going to be impressed by it.\"\n\n\"The Uller Company,\" von Schlichten replied, \"is six and a half\nparsecs away. It takes a ship six months to get from here to Terra,\nand another six months to get back. A radio message takes a little\nover twenty-one years, each way.\" He holstered the pistol again. \"You\nwere bitching about how we needed reenforcements, a while ago. Well,\nhere's where we have to reverse Clausewitz and use politics as an\nextension by other means of war.\"\n\n\"That brings up another question, general,\" one of Keaveney's\nsubordinates said. \"Can we hold out long enough for help to get here\nfrom Terra?\"\n\n\"By the time help could reach us from Terra,\" von Schlichten replied,\n\"we'll either have this revolt crushed, or there won't be a live\nTerran left on Uller.\" He felt a brief sadistic pleasure as he watched\nKeaveney's face sag in horror. \"What do you think we'll live on, for a\nyear?\" he asked. \"On this planet, there's not more than a three\nmonths' supply of any sort of food a human can eat. And the ships\nthat'll be coming in until word of our plight can get to Terra won't\nbring enough to keep us going. We need the farms and livestock and the\nanimal-tissue culture plant at Konkrook, and the farms at Krink and on\nthe plateau back of Skilk, and we need peace and native labor to work\nthem.\"\n\nNobody seemed to have anything to say after that, for a while. Then\nKeaveney suggested that the next ship was due in from Niflheim in\nthree months, and that it could be used to evacuate all the Terrans on\nUller.\n\n\"And I'll personally shoot any able-bodied Terran who tries to board\nthat ship,\" von Schlichten promised. \"Get this through your heads, all\nof you. We are going to break this rebellion, and we are going to hold\nUller for the Company and the Terran Federation.\" He looked around\nhim. \"Now, get back to work, all of you,\" he told the group that had\nformed around him and Keaveney. \"Miss Quinton, you just heard me order\nmy adjutant, Colonel O'Leary, on detached duty to Krink. I want you to\ntake over for him. You'll have rank and authority as colonel for the\nduration of this war.\"\n\nShe was thunderstruck. \"But I know absolutely nothing about military\nmatters. There must be a hundred people here who are better qualified\nthan I am....\"\n\n\"There are, and they all have jobs, and I'd have to find replacements\nfor them, and replacements for the replacements. You won't leave any\nvacancy to be filled. And you'll learn, fast enough.\" He went over to\nthe situation-map again, and looked at the arrangement of pink and\nwhite pills. \"First of all, I want you to call Jarman, at the military\nairport, and have an airjeep and driver sent around here for me. I'm\ngoing up and have a look around. Barney, keep the show going while I'm\nout, and tell Colonel Quinton what it's all about.\"\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\nDon't Push Them Anywhere Put Them Back in the Bottle\n\n\nHe looked at his watch, and stood for a moment, pumping the stale air\nand tobacco-smoke of the telecast station out of his lungs, as the\nlight airjeep let down into the street. Oh-one-fifteen--two hours and\na half since the mutiny at the native-troops barracks had broken out.\nThe Company reservation was still ablaze with lights, and over the\nroof of the hospital and dispensary and test-lab he could see the\nglare of the burning barracks. There was more fire-glare to the south,\nin the direction of the mine-equipment park and the mine-labor camp,\nand from that direction the bulk of the firing was to be heard.\n\nThe driver, a young lieutenant who seemed to be of predominantly\nMalayan and Polynesian blood, slid back the duraglass canopy for him\nto climb in, then snapped it into place when he had strapped himself\ninto his seat.\n\n\"Can you handle the armament, sir?\" he asked.\n\nVon Schlichten nodded approvingly. Not a very flattering question, but\nthe boy was right to make sure, before they started out.\n\n\"I've done it, once or twice,\" he understated. \"Let's go; I want a\nlook at what's going on down at the equipment-park and the labor-camp,\nfirst.\"\n\nThey lifted up, the driver turning the nose of the airjeep in the\ndirection of the flames and explosions and magnesium-lights to the\nsouth and tapping his booster-button gently. The vehicle shot forward\nand came floating in over the scene of the fighting. The situation-map\nat the improvised headquarters had shown a mixture of pink and white\npills in the mine-equipment park; something was going to have to be\ndone about the lag in correcting it, for the area was entirely in the\nhands of loyal Company troops, and the mob of laborers and mutinous\nsoldiers had been pushed back into the temporary camp where the\nworkers had been gathered to await transportation to the Arctic. As he\nfeared, the rioting workers, many of whom were trained to handle\ncontragravity equipment, had managed to lift up a number of\ndump-trucks and powershovels and bulldozers, intending to use them as\nimprovised airtanks, but Jarman's combat-cars had gotten on the job\npromptly and all of these had been shot down and were lying in\nwreckage, mostly among the rows of parked mining-equipment.\n\nFrom the labor-camp, a surprising volume of fire was being directed\nagainst the attack which had already started from the retaken\nequipment-park. This was just another evidence of the failure of\nIntelligence and the Constabulary--and consequently of himself--to\nanticipate the brewing storm. There was, of course, practically no\nchance of keeping Ullerans from having native weapons, swords, knives,\neven bows and air-rifles, and a certain number of Volund-made\ntrade-quality automatic pistols could be expected, but most of the\nfire was coming from military rifles, and now and then he could see\nthe furnace-like backflash of a recoilless rifle or a bazooka, or the\nsteady flicker of a machine-gun. Even if a few of these weapons had\nbeen brought from the barracks by retreating Tenth Infantry or Fifth\nCavalry mutineers, there were still too many.\n\nHovering above the fighting, aloof from it, he saw six long\ntroop-carriers land and disgorge Kragan Rifles who had been released\nby the liquidation of resistance at the native-troops barracks. A\nlittle later, two airtanks floated in, and then two more, going off\ncontragravity and lumbering on treads to fire their 90-mm rifles. At\nthe same time, combat-cars swooped in, banging away with their lighter\nauto-cannon and launching rockets. The titanium prefab-huts, set up to\nhouse the laborers and intended to be taken north with them for their\nstay on the polar desert, were simply wiped away. Among the wreckage,\nresistance was being blown out like the lights of a candelabrum. Push\nthe white pills out, girls, he thought. Don't push them anywhere; put\nthem back in the bottle. This year, there wouldn't be any mining done\nat the North Pole; next year, the stockholders'll be bitching about\ntheir dividend-checks. And a lot of new machine operators are going to\nhave to be trained for next year's mining. If there is any mining,\nnext year.\n\nHe took up the hand-phone and called HQ.\n\n\"Von Schlichten, what's the wavelength of the officer in command at\nthe equipment-park?\"\n\nA voice at the telecast station furnished it; he punched it out.\n\n\"Von Schlichten, right overhead. That you, Major Falkenberg? Nice\ngoing, major, how are your casualties?\"\n\n\"Not too bad. Twenty or thirty Kragans and loyal Skilkans, and eight\nTerrans killed, about as many wounded.\"\n\n\"Pretty good, considering what you're running into. Get many of your\nKragans mounted on those hipposaurs?\"\n\n\"About a hundred, a lot of 'saurs got shot, while we were leading\nthem out from the stables.\"\n\n\"Well, I can see geeks streaming away from the labor-camp, out the\nsouth end, going in the direction of the river. Use what cavalry you\nhave on them, and what contragravity you can spare. I'll drop a few\nflares to show their position and direction.\"\n\nAnticipating him, the driver turned the airjeep and started toward the\ndry Hoork River. Von Schlichten nodded approval and told him to\nrelease flares when over the fugitives.\n\n\"Right,\" Falkenberg replied. \"I'll get on it at once, general.\"\n\n\"And start moving that mine-equipment up into the Company area. Some\nof it we can put into the air; the rest we can use to build\nbarricades. None of it do we want the geeks getting hold of, and the\nequipment-park's outside our practical perimeter. I'll send people to\nhelp you move it.\"\n\n\"No need to do that, sir; I have about a hundred and fifty loyal North\nUllerans--foremen, technicians, overseers--who can handle it.\"\n\n\"All right. Use your own judgment. Put the stuff back of the\nnative-troops barracks, and between the power-plant and the Company\noffice-buildings, and anywhere else you can.\" The lieutenant nudged\nhim and pushed a couple of buttons on the dashboard.\n\n\"Here go the flares, now.\"\n\nImmediately, a couple of airjeeps pounced in, to strafe the fleeing\nenemy. Somebody must have already been issuing orders on another\nwavelength; a number of Kragans, riding hipposaurs, were galloping\ninto the light of the flares.\n\n\"Now, let's have a look at the native barracks and the\nmaintenance-yards,\" he said. \"And then, we'll make a circuit around\nthe Reservation, about two or three miles out. I'm not happy about\nwhere Firkked's army is.\"\n\nThe driver looked at him. \"I've been worrying about that, too, sir,\"\nhe said. \"I can't understand why he hasn't jumped us, already. I know\nit takes time to get one of these geek armies on the road, but....\"\n\n\"He's hoping our native troops and the mine laborers will be able to\nwipe us out, themselves,\" von Schlichten said. \"For the timidity and\nstupidity of our enemies, Allah make us truly thankful, amen. It's\nsomething no commander should depend on, but be glad when it happens.\nIf Firkked had had a couple of regiments on hand outside the\nreservation to jump us as soon as the Tenth and the Zirks mutinied, he\ncould have swamped us in twenty minutes and we'll all have had our\nthroats cut by now.\"\n\nThere was nothing going on in the area between the native barracks and\nthe mountains except some sporadic firing as small patrols of Kragans\nclashed with clumps of fleeing mutineers. All the barracks, even those\nof the Rifles, were burning; the red-and-yellow danger-lights around\nthe power-plant and the water-works and the explosives magazines were\nstill on. Most of the floodlights were still on, and there was still\nsome fighting around the maintenance-yard. It looked as though the\nsurvivors of the Tenth N.U.N.I. were in a few small pockets which were\nbeing squeezed out.\n\nThere was nothing at all going on north of the Reservation; the\ncountryside, by day a checkerboard of walled fields and small\nvillages, was dark, except for a dim light, here and there, where the\noccupants of some farmhouse had been awakened by the noise of battle.\nThe airjeep dropped lower, and the driver slid open the window beside\nhim; von Schlichten could hear the grunts and snorts and squawks of\nfarm-animals, similarly aroused.\n\nThen, two miles east of the Reservation, he caught a new sound--the\nflowing, riverlike, murmur of something vast on the move.\n\n\"Hear that, lieutenant?\" he asked. \"Head for it, at about a thousand\nfeet. When we're directly above it, let go some flares.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" The younger man had lowered his voice to a whisper.\n\"That's geek, headed for the Reservation.\"\n\n\"Maybe Firkked's army,\" von Schlichten thought aloud. \"Or maybe a city\nmob.\"\n\n\"Not quite noisy enough for a mob, is it, sir?\"\n\n\"A tired mob,\" von Schlichten told him. \"They'd start out on a run,\nyelling '_Znidd Suddabit_!' By the time they got across the bridges to\nthis side of the river, they'd be winded. They'd stop for a blow, and\nthen they'd settle down to steady slogging to save their wind.\nSometimes a mob like that's worse than a fresh mob. They get stubborn;\nthey act more deliberately.\"\n\nThe noises were growing clearer, louder. He picked up the phone and\npunched the wavelength of the military airport.\n\n\"Von Schlichten, my compliments to Colonel Jarman. Tell him there's a\ngeek mob, or possibly Firkked's regulars, on the main highway from\nSkilk, two miles east of the Reservation. Get some combat\ncontragravity over here, at once. We'll light them up for you. And\ntell Colonel Jarman to start flying patrols up and down along the\nHoork River; this may not be the only gang that's coming out to see\nus.\"\n\nThe sounds were directly below, now--the scuffing of horny-soled feet\non the dirt road, the clink and rattle of slung weapons, the clicking\nand squeeking of Ulleran voices.\n\nThe lieutenant said, \"Here go the flares, sir.\"\n\nVon Schlichten shut his eyes, then opened them slowly. The driver,\nupon releasing the flares, had nosed up, banked, turned, and was\ncoming in again, down the road toward the advancing column. Von\nSchlichten peered into his all-armament sight, his foot on the\nmachine-gun pedal and his fingers on the rocket buttons. The highway\nbelow was jammed with geeks, and they were all stopped dead and\nstaring upward, as though hypnotized by the lights. A second later,\nthey had recovered and were shooting--not at the airjeep, but at the\nfour globes of blazing magnesium. Then he had the close-packed mass of\nnon-humanity in his sights; he tramped the pedal and began punching\nbuttons. He still had four rockets left by the time the mob was behind\nhim.\n\n\"All right, let's take another pass at them. Same direction.\"\n\nThe driver put the airjeep into a quick loop and came out of it in\nfront of the mob, who now had their backs turned and were staring in\nthe direction in which they had last seen the vehicle. Again, von\nSchlichten plowed them with rockets and harrowed them with his guns.\nSome of the Skilkans were trying to get over the high fences on either\nside of the road--really stockades of petrified tree-trunks. Others\nwere firing, and this time they were shooting at the airjeep. It took\none hit from a heavy shellosaur-rifle, and, immediately, the driver\nbanked and turned away from the road.\n\n\"Dammit, why did you do that?\" von Schlichten demanded, lifting his\nfoot from the gun-pedal. \"Are you afraid of the kind of popguns those\ngeeks are using?\"\n\n\"I am not afraid to risk my vehicle, or myself, sir,\" the lieutenant\nreplied, with the extreme formality of a very junior officer chewing\nout a very senior one. \"I am, however, afraid to risk my passenger.\nGenerals are not expendable, sir; neither are they issued for use as\nclay pigeons.\"\n\nHe was right, of course. Von Schlichten admitted it. \"I'm too old to\nplay cowboy, like this,\" he said. \"Back to the Reservation, telecast\nstation.\"\n\nLooking back over his shoulder, he saw eight or ten more flares\nalight, and the ground-flashes of exploding shells and rockets; the\nair above the road was sparkling with gun-flames. Jarman must have had\nsome contragravity ready to be sent off on the instant.\n\nWhile he had been out, somebody had gotten a TV-pickup mounted on a\ncontragravity-lifter and run up to two thousand feet, on the end of a\nsteel-tough tensilon mooring-line. The big circular screen was lit,\nshowing the whole Company Reservation, with the surrounding\ncountryside foreshortened by perspective to the distant lights of\nSkilk. The map had been taken up from the floor, and a big\nterrain-board had been brought in from the Chief Engineer's office and\nset up in its place. In front of the screen, Paula Quinton, Barney\nMordkovitz, Colonel Cheng-Li, and, conspicuously silent, Jules\nKeaveney sat drinking coffee and munching sandwiches. Half a dozen\nTerrans, of both sexes, were working furiously to get the markers\nwhich replaced the pink and white pills placed on the board, and one\nof Captain Inez Malavez's non-coms, with a headset, was getting\ncombat reports directly from the switchboard. Everything was clicking\nlike well-oiled machinery.\n\nOn the TV-screen, the Residency area was ablaze with light, and so\nwere the ship-docks, the airport and spaceport, the shops, and the\nmaintenance-yard. On the terrain-board, the latter was now marked as\ncompletely in Company hands. The ruins of the native-troops barracks\nwere still burning, and there was a twinkle of orange-red here and\nthere among the ruins of the labor-camp. Much of the equipment for the\npolar mines had already been shifted into defensible ground. The rest\nof the circle was dark, except for the distant lights of Skilk, where\nthe nuclear power plant was apparently still functioning in native\nhands.\n\nThen, without warning, a spot of white light blazed into being\nsoutheast of the Company area and southwest of Skilk, followed by\nanother and another. Instantly, von Schlichten glanced up at the row\nof smaller screens, and on one of them saw the view as picked up by a\npatrolling airjeep.\n\nThe army of King Firkked of Skilk had finally put in its appearance,\ncoming in two columns, one southward from Skilk and the other\nnorthward along the west bank of the dry river. The former had crossed\nover and joined the latter, about three miles south of the\nReservation. The scene in the screen was similar to the one he had,\nhimself, witnessed through his armament-sight. The Skilkan regulars\nhad been marching in formation, some on the road and some along\nparallel lanes and paths. They had the look of trained and disciplined\ntroops, but they had made the same mistake as the rabble that had been\nshot up on the north side of the Reservation. Unused to attack from\nthe air, they had all halted in place and were gaping open-mouthed,\ntheir opal teeth gleaming in the white flare-light. However, before\nthe aircar had passed over them, the lead company of one regiment,\narmed with Terran rifles, had begun firing.\n\nIn the big screen, it could be seen that Colonel Jarman had thrown\nmost of his available contragravity at them, including the\ncombat-cars, that had already started to form the second wave of the\nattack on the mob to the north. Other flares bloomed in the darkness,\nand the fiery trails of rockets curved downward to end in yellow\nflashes on the ground.\n\nThe airjeep with the pickup circled back; the troops on the road and\nin the adjoining fields had broken. The former were caught between the\nfences which made Ulleran roads such death-traps when under\nair-attack. The latter had dispersed, and were running away,\nindividually and by squads; at first, it looked like a panic, but he\ncould see officers signaling to the larger groups of fugitives to open\nout, apparently directing the flight. By this time, there were ten or\ntwelve combat-cars and about twenty airjeeps at work. In the moving\nview from the pickup-jeep, he saw what looked like a 90-mm rocket land\nin the middle of a company that was still trying to defend itself with\nsmall-arms fire on the road, wiping out about half of them.\n\n\"Make the most of it, boys,\" Barney Mordkovitz, his mouth full of\nsandwich, was saying. \"Heave it to them; you won't get another chance\nlike that at those buggers.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Colonel Paula Quinton wanted to know. Her military\neducation was progressing, but it still had a few gaps to fill in.\n\n\"The next time they're air-struck, they won't stay bunched,\"\nMordkovitz replied. \"A lot of them didn't stay bunched this time, if\nyou noticed. And they'll keep out from between the fences.\"\n\nIn the large screen, a quick succession of gun-flashes leaped up from\nthe direction of the Hoork River and shells began bursting over the scene\nof the attack. The screen tuned to the pickup on the airjeep went\ndead; in the big screen, there was a twinkling of falling fire. Almost\nat once, thirty or forty rocket-trails converged on the gun-position,\nand, for a moment, explosions burned like a bonfire.\n\n\"They had a 75-mm at the rear of the column,\" somebody called from the\nbig switchboard. \"Lieutenant Kalanang's jeep was hit; Lieutenant\nVermaas is cutting in his pickup on the same wavelength.\"\n\nThe small screen lighted again. In the big screen, a cluster of\nmagnesium-lights appeared above where the Skilkan gun had been; in the\nsmall screen, there was a stubbled grain-field, pocked with craters,\nand the bodies of fifteen or twenty natives, all rather badly mangled.\nAn overturned and apparently destroyed 75-mm gun lay on its side.\n\nFive or six fairly large fires had broken out, by this time, around\nthe point of attack. Von Schlichten nodded approvingly.\n\n\"I was wondering how long it'd take somebody to think of that,\" he\nsaid. \"Granaries and forage-stacks on some of these farms. They'll\nburn for half an hour, at least.\" He looked at his watch. \"And by that\ntime, it'll be daylight.\"\n\n\"As far as we know, that was the only 75-mm gun Firkked had,\" Colonel\nCheng-Li said. \"He has at least six, possibly ten, 40-mm's. It's a\nwonder we haven't seen anything of them.\"\n\n\"Well, there's no way of being sure,\" Jules Keaveney said, \"but I\nhave an idea they're all at or around the Palace. Firkked knows about\nhow much contragravity we have. He's probably wondering why we aren't\nbombing him, now.\"\n\n\"He doesn't know we've sold the Palace to King Jonkvank for an army,\"\nvon Schlichten said. \"And that reminds me--how much contragravity\ncould Firkked scrape together, for an attack on us? I've been\nexpecting a geek _Luftwaffe_ over here, at any moment.\"\n\nColonel Cheng-Li studied the smoking tip of his cigarette for a\nmoment. \"Well, Firkked owns, personally, three ten-passenger aircars,\na thing like a troop-carrier that he transports some of his courtiers\naround in, four airjeeps armed with a pair of 15-mm machine-guns\napiece, and two big lorries. There are possibly two hundred vehicles\nof all types in Skilk and the country around, but some of them are in\nthe hands of natives friendly to us and or hostile to Firkked. I can\nget the exact figures from the Constabulary office at Company House.\"\n\n\"That's close enough,\" von Schlichten told him. \"And there'll be\noodles of thermoconcentrate-fuel, and blasting explosives. Colonel\nQuinton, suppose you call Ed Wallingsby, the Chief Engineer, right\naway; have him commissioned colonel. Tell him to get to work making\nthis place secure against air attack; tell him to consult with Colonel\nJarman. Tell him to get those geeks Leavitt has penned in the\nrepair-dock at the airport and use them to dig slit-trenches and fill\nsandbags and so on. He can use Kragan limited-duty wounded to guard\nthem.... Mr. Keaveney, you'll begin setting up something in the way of\nan ARP-organization. You'll have to get along on what nobody else\nwants. You will also consult with Colonel Jarman, and with Colonel\nWallingsby. Better get started on it now. Just think of everything\naround here that could go wrong in case of an air attack, and try to\ndo something about it in advance.\"\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\nThe Geek Luftwaffe and the Kragan Airlift\n\n\nAt 0245, an attack developed on the northwestern corner of the\nReservation, in the direction of the explosives magazines. It turned\nout to be relatively trivial. Remnants of the mob that had been broken\nup by air attack on the road had gotten together and were making\nrushes in small bands, keeping well spread out. Beating them off took\nconsiderable ammunition, but it was accomplished with negligible\ncasualties to the defenders. They finally stopped coming around\ndaylight.\n\nIn the meantime, Themistocles M'zangwe called from Konkrook, appearing\nin the screen with his left arm in a freshly white sling.\n\n\"What the hell have you been doing to yourself?\" von Schlichten wanted\nto know.\n\n\"Crossbow-bolt, about half an hour ago. A couple of inches lower and\nacting Brigadier-General Colbert'd have been talking to you, now,\ninstead of me.\"\n\n\"Lucky it didn't have a nitro-capsule on the end. How are you making\nout? Have Kankad's people started coming in, yet?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, about six hundred of them have gotten in already, in the\ndamnedest collection of vehicles you ever saw. Kankad must be using\nevery scrap of contragravity he has; it's a regular airborne\nDunkirk-in-reverse. Kankad sent word that he's coming here in person,\nas soon as he has things organized at his place. And the geeks here\nhave scraped together an air-force of their own--farm-lorries,\naircars, that sort of thing--and they're using them to bomb us here\nand at the mainland farm, mostly with nitroglycerine. We've shot down\nabout twenty of them, but they're still coming. They tried a\nboat-attack across the Channel; that's how I got this. We've been\ndoing some bombing, ourselves; we made a down payment for Eric Blount\nand Hendrik Lemoyne. Took a fifty-ton tank off a fuel-lorry, fitted it\nwith a detonator, filled it with thermoconcentrate, and ferried it\nover on the _Elmoran_ and dumped it on the Keegarkan Embassy. It must\nhave landed in the middle of the central court; in about fifteen\nseconds, flames were coming out every window in the place.\" His face\nbecame less jovial. \"We had something pretty bad happen here, too,\" he\nsaid. \"That Konkrook Fencibles rabble of Prince Jaizerd's mutinied,\nalong with the others; they got into the hospital and butchered\neverybody in the place, patients and staff. The Kragans got there too\nlate to save anybody, but they wiped out the Fencibles. Jaizerd\nhimself was the only one they took alive, and he didn't stay that way\nvery long.\"\n\n\"How are you making out with your Civil Administration crowd?\"\n\nM'zangwe grimaced. \"I haven't had to put any of them under actual\narrest, so far, but we've had to keep Buhrmann away from the\ncommunications equipment by force. He wanted to call you up and chew\nyou out for not evacuating everybody in the north to Konkrook.\"\n\n\"Is he crazy?\"\n\n\"No, just scared. He says you're going to get everybody on Uller\nmassacred by detail, when you could save Konkrook by bringing them\nall here.\"\n\n\"You tell him I'm going to hold this planet, not just one city. Tell\nhim I have a sense of my duty to the Company and its stockholders, if\nhe hasn't; put it in those terms and he may understand you.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll try that out on Meyerstein, too. He's in a hell of a state\nabout the losses the Banking Cartel are taking on this deal.... Well,\nI'll call you when there's anything new.\"\n\nBy 0330, it was daylight; the attacks against the northwest corner of\nthe perimeter stopped entirely. Wallingsby had the three-hundred-odd\nSkilkan laborers at work; he had gathered up all the tarpaulin he could\nfind, and had the two sewing-machines in the tentmaker's shop running on\nsandbags. Jules Keaveney, to von Schlichten's agreeable surprise, had\ntaken hold of his ARP assignment, and was doing an efficient job in\norganizing for fire-fighting, damage-control and first aid. Colonel\nJarman had his airjeeps and combat-cars working in ever-widening circles\nover the countryside, shooting up everything in sight that even looked\nlike contragravity equipment. Some of these patrols had to be recalled,\naround 1030, when sporadic nuisance-sniping began from the side of the\nmountain to the west. And, along with everything else, Paula Quinton\nmanaged, along with her other work, to get a complete digest prepared of\nthe situation elsewhere in the Terran-occupied parts of the planet.\n\nThe situation at Konkrook was brightening steadily. The second wave of\nKankad's improvised airlift, reenforced by contragravity from\nKonkrook, had come in; there were now close to two thousand fresh\nKragans on Gongonk Island and the mainland farms, Kankad himself with\nthem. The _Aldebaran_ had reached Kankad's Town, and was loading\nanother thousand Kragans.... There was nothing more from Keegark. A\nmessage from Colonel MacKinnon had come in at dawn, to the effect that\nthe geeks had penetrated his last defenses and that he was about to\nblow up the Residency; thereafter Keegark went off the air.... By\n0730, the _Northern Star_ had landed the regiment Murderers, armed\nwith first-quality Terran infantry-rifles and a few machine-guns and\nbazookas, at the Palace at Krink, and by 0845 she had returned with\nanother regiment, the Jeel-Feeders. The three-lane street connecting\nthe Palace and the Residency had been widened to six, and then to\neight.... Guido Karamessinis, at Grank, was still at uneasy peace with\nKing Yoorkerk, who was still undecided whether the rebels or the\nCompany were going to be the eventual victors, and afraid to take any\nirrevocable step in either direction.... Eight men and four women, the\nsurvivors of a trading-station on the eastern shore of Takkad Sea,\nreached Konkrook in a lorry; another trading station, on the south\nshore, reported by telecast that the natives there had refused to rise\nagainst them, and had crucified five of Rakkeed's disciples who had\ncome among them preaching _znidd suddabit_.\n\nAt 1100, Paula Quinton and Barney Mordkovitz virtually ordered him to\nget some sleep. He went to his quarters at Company House, downed a\nspaceship-captain's-size drink of honey-rum, and slept until 1600. As\nhe dressed and shaved, he could hear, through the open window, the\nslow sputter of small-arms' fire, punctuated by the occasional\n_whump-whump-whump_ of 40-mm auto-cannon or the hammering of a\nmachine-gun.\n\nReturning to his command-post at the telecast station, the\nterrain-board showed that the perimeter of defense had been pushed out\nin a bulge at the northwest corner; the TV-screen pictured a crude\nbreast-work of petrified tree-trunks, sandbags, mining machinery,\npacking-cases and odds-and-ends, upon which Wallingsby's native\nlaborers were working under guard while a skirmish-line of Kragans had\nbeen thrown out another four or five hundred yards and were exchanging\npot-shots with Skilkans on the gullied hillside.\n\n\"Where's Colonel Quinton?\" he asked. \"She ought to be taking a turn in\nthe sack, now.\"\n\n\"She's taking one,\" Major Falkenberg, who had commanded the action at\nthe native-troops barracks and the labor-camp, the night before, told\nhim. \"General Mordkovitz chased her off to bed a couple of hours ago,\ncalled me in to take her place, and then went out to replace me.\nColonel Guilliford's in the hospital; got hit about thirteen hundred.\nThey're afraid he's going to lose a leg.\"\n\n\"That's a bloody shame!\" He pointed to the northwest corner of the\nperimeter on the screen. \"Whose idea was that?\" he asked. \"It's a good\none; I ought to have thought of it, myself.\"\n\n\"Your new adjutant,\" Falkenberg grinned. \"She asked somebody what\nthose big domes, up there, were. When they told her there were ten\nthousand tons of thermoconcentrate, five thousand tons of\nblasting-explosives, and five tons of plutonium, under them, she\ndamned near fainted, and then she ordered that, right away.\"\n\nMore reports came in. The entire garrison of the small Residency at\nKwurk, the most northern of the eastern shore Free Cities, had arrived\nat Kankad's Town in two hundred-foot contragravity scows and five\naircars. Two of the aircars arrived half an hour behind the rest of\nthe refugee flotilla, having turned off at Keegark to pay their\nrespects to King Orgzild. They reported the Keegark Residency in\nruins, its central buildings vanished in a huge crater; the _Jan\nSmuts_ and the _Christiaan De Wett_ were still in the Company docks,\nboth apparently damaged by the blast which had destroyed the\nResidency. One of the aircars had rocketed and machine-gunned some\nKeegarkans who appeared to be trying to repair them; the other blew up\nKing Orgzild's nitroglycerine plant. Von Schlichten called Konkrook\nand ordered a bombing-mission against Keegark organized, to make sure\nthe two ships stayed out of service.\n\nThe _Northern Star_ was still bringing loyal troops into Krink. King\nJonkvank, whom von Schlichten called, was highly elated.\n\n\"We are killing traitors wherever we find them!\" he exulted. \"The city\nis yellow with their blood; their heads are piled everywhere! How is\nit with you at Skilk?\"\n\n\"We have killed many, also,\" von Schlichten boasted. \"And tonight, we\nwill kill more; we are preparing bombs of great destruction, which we\nwill rain down upon Skilk until there is not one stone left upon\nanother, or one infant of a day's age left alive!\"\n\nJonkvank reacted as he was intended to. \"Oh, no, general, don't do all\nthat!\" he exclaimed. \"You promised me that I should have Skilk, on the\nword of a Terran. Are you going to give me a city of ruins and\ncorpses? Ruins are no good to anybody, and I am not a Jeel, to eat\ncorpses.\"\n\nVon Schlichten shrugged. \"When you are strong, you can flog your\nenemies with a whip; when you are weak, all you can do is kill them.\nIf I had five thousand more troops, here....\"\n\n\"Oh, I will send troops, as soon as I can,\" Jonkvank hastened to\npromise. \"All my best regiments: the Murderers, the Jeel-Feeders, the\nCorpse-Reapers, the Devastators, the Fear-Makers. But, now that we\nhave stopped this sinful rebellion, here, I can't take chances that it\nwill break out again as soon as I strip the city of troops.\"\n\nVon Schlichten nodded. Jonkvank's argument made sense; he would have\ntaken a similar position, himself.\n\n\"Well, get as many as you can over here, as soon as possible,\" he\nsaid. \"We'll try to do as little damage to Skilk as we can, but ...\"\n\nAt 1830, Paula joined him for her breakfast, while he sat in front of\nthe big screen, eating his dinner. There had been light ground-action\nalong the southern end of the perimeter--King Firkked's regulars,\nreenforced by Zirk tribesmen and levies of townspeople, all of whom\nseemed to have firearms, were filtering in through the ruins of the\nlabor-camp and the wreckage of the equipment-park--and there was\nrenewed sniping from the mountainside. The long afternoon of the\nnorthern autumn dragged on; finally, at 2200, the sun set, and it was\nnot fully dark for another hour. For some time, there was an ominous\nquiet, and then, at 0030, the enemy began attacking in force, driving\nherds of livestock--lumbering six-legged brutes bred by the North\nUllerans for food--to test the defenses for electrified wire and\nland-mines. Most of these were shot down or blown up, but a few got as\nfar as the wire, which, by now, had been strung and electrified\ncompletely around the perimeter.\n\nBehind them came parties of Skilkan regulars with long-handled\ninsulated cutters; a couple of cuts were made in the wire, and a\nsection of it went dead. The line, at this point, had been rather\nthinly held; the defenders immediately called for air-support, and\nJarman ordered fifteen of his remaining twenty airjeeps and five\ncombat-cars into the fight. No sooner were they committed than the\nradar on the commercial airport control-tower picked up air vehicles\napproaching from the north, and the air-raid sirens began howling and\nthe searchlights went on.\n\nAs a protection from the sudden fury of the summer and winter gales,\nthe buildings were all low, thick-walled, and provided with steel\ndoors and window-shutters which were electrically operated and\ncentrally controlled. These slammed shut in every occupied building.\nThe contragravity which had been sent to support the ground-defense at\nthe south side of the Reservation turned to meet this new threat, and\neverything else available, including the four heavy airtanks, lifted\nup. Meanwhile, guns began firing from the ground and from rooftops.\n\nThere had been four aircars, ordinary passenger vehicles equipped with\nmachine-guns on improvised mounts, and ten big lorries converted into\nbombers, in the attack. All the lorries, and all but one of the\nmakeshift fighter-escort, were shot down, but not before explosive and\nthermoconcentrate bombs were dumped all over the place. One lorry\nemptied its load of thermoconcentrate-bombs on the control-building at\nthe airport, starting a raging fire and putting the radar out of\ncommission. A repair-shop at the ordnance-depot was set on fire, and a\nquantity of small-arms and machine-gun ammunition piled outside for\ntransportation to the outer defenses blew up. An explosive bomb landed\non the roof of the building between Company House and the telecast\nstation, blowing a hole in the roof and demolishing the upper floor.\nAnd another load of thermoconcentrate, missing the power-plant, set\nfire to the dry grass between it and the ruins of the native-troops\nbarracks.\n\nBefore the air-attack had been broken up, the soldiers of King Firkked\nand their irregular supporters were swarming through the dead section\nof wire. They had four or five big farm-tractors, nuclear-powered but\nunequipped with contragravity-generators, which they were using like\nground-tanks of the First Century. This attack penetrated to the\nmiddle of the Reservation before it was stopped and the attackers\neither killed or driven out; for the first time since daybreak, the\nred-and-yellow lights came on around the power-plant.\n\nAs soon as the combined air and ground attack was beaten off, von\nSchlichten ordered all his available contragravity up, flying patrols\naround the Reservation and retaliatory bombing missions against Skilk,\nand began bombarding the city with his 90-mm guns. A number of fires\nbroke out, and at about 0200 a huge expanding globe of orange-red\nflame soared up from the city.\n\n\"There goes Firkked's thermoconcentrate stock,\" he said to Paula, who\nwas standing beside him in front of the screen.\n\nHalf an hour later, he discovered that he had been overly optimistic.\nMuch of the enemy's supply of Terran thermoconcentrate had been\ndestroyed, but enough remained to pelt the Reservation and the Company\nbuildings with incendiaries, when a second and more severe air-attack\ndeveloped, consisting of forty or fifty makeshift lorry-bombers and\nfifteen aircars. The previous attack von Schlichten had viewed in the\nscreen at the telecast station; it was his questionable good fortune\nto observe the second one directly, having been out inspecting the\ndefenses around the ordnance-depot at the time.\n\nLike the first, the second air-attack was beaten off, or, more\nexactly, down. Most of the enemy contragravity was destroyed; at least\ntwo dozen vehicles crashed inside the Reservation. As in the first\ninstance, there was a simultaneous ground attack from the southern\nside, with a demonstration-attack at the north end. For a while, von\nSchlichten found himself fighting hand-to-hand, first with his pistol\nand then, when his ammunition was gone, with a picked-up rifle and\nbayonet. It was full daylight before the last of the attackers was\neither killed or driven out.\n\nFive minutes later, while he was reloading his pistol-clips with\nsalvaged cartridges, the _Northern Star_ came bulking over the\nmountains from the west.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\nOf Princedoms Which Have Been Won by Conquest\n\n\nHolstering his pistol, he raced for the telecast station, to receive a\ncall from a Colonel Khalid ib'n Talal, a Zanzibar Arab, aboard the\napproaching ship.\n\n\"I've one of Jonkvank's regiments, the Jeel-Feeders, armed with Terran\n9-mm rifles and a few bazookas; I have a company of our Zirks, with\ntheir mounts, and a battalion of the Sixth N.U.N.I.; I also have four\n90-mm guns, Terran-manned,\" he reported. \"What's the situation,\ngeneral, and where do you want me to land?\"\n\nVon Schlichten described the situation succinctly, in an ancient and\nunprintable military cliche. \"Try landing south of the Reservation, a\nlittle west of the ruins of the labor-camp,\" he advised. \"The bulk of\nFirkked's army is in that section, and I want them run out as soon as\npossible. We'll give you all the contragravity and fire support we\ncan.\"\n\nThe _Northern Star_ let down slowly, firing her guns and dropping\nbombs; as she descended, rifle-fire spurted from all her lower-deck\nportholes. There was cheering, human and Ulleran, from inside the\nbattered defense-perimeter; combat-cars, airjeeps, and improvised\nbombers lifted out to strafe the Skilkans on the ground, and the four\nairtanks moved out to take position and open fire with their 90-mm's,\nhelping to flush King Firkked's regulars and auxiliaries out of the\ngullies and ruins and drive them south along the mountain, away from\nwhere the ship would land and also away from the city of Skilk. The\n_Northern Star_ set down quickly, and troops and artillery began to be\nunloaded, joining in the fighting.\n\nIt was five hundred miles to Krink; three hours after lifting out, the\n_Northern Star_ was back again, with two more of King Jonkvank's\ninfantry regiments, and by 1300, when the fourth load arrived from\nKrink, the fighting was entirely on the eastern bank of the dry Hoork\nRiver. This last contingent of reenforcements was landed in the\neastern suburbs of Skilk and began fighting their way into the city\nfrom the rear.\n\nIt was evident, however, that the pacification of Skilk would not be\naccomplished as rapidly as von Schlichten wished--street fighting,\nagainst a determined enemy, is notoriously slow work--and he decided\nto risk the _Northern Star_ in an attack against the Palace itself,\nand, over the objections of Paula Quinton, Jules Keaveney, and Barney\nMordkovitz, to lead the attack in person.\n\nInside the city, he found that the Zirk cavalry from Krink had thrust\nup one of the broader streets to within a thousand yards of the\nPalace, and, supported by infantry, contragravity, and a couple of\nairtanks, were pounding and hacking at a mass of Skilkans whose\nuniform lack of costume prevented distinguishing between soldiery and\ntownsfolk. Very few of these, he observed, seemed to be using\nfirearms; with his glasses, he could see them shooting with long\nnorthern air-rifles and a few Takkad Sea crossbows. Either weapon\nwould shoot clear through a Terran or half-way through an Ulleran at\nfifty yards, but at over two hundred they were almost harmless. There\nwere a few fires still burning from the bombardment of the night\nbefore--Ulleran, and particularly North Ulleran, cities did not burn\nwell--and the blaze which had consumed the bulk of Firkked's stock of\nthermoconcentrate fuel had long ago burned out, leaving an area of six\nor eight blocks blackened and lifeless.\n\nThe ship let down, while the six combat-cars which had accompanied her\nbuzzed the Palace roof, strafing it to keep it clear, and the Kragans\naboard fired with their rifles. She came to rest on seven-eighths\nweight reduction, and even before the gangplanks were run out, the\nKragans were dropping to the flat roof, running to stairhead\npenthouses and tossing grenades into them.\n\nThe taking of the Palace was a gruesome business. Knowing exactly how\nmuch mercy they would have shown had they been storming the Residency,\nFirkked's soldiers and courtiers fought desperately and had to be\nexterminated, floor by floor, room by room, hallway by hallway. There\nwas some attempt at escape from the ground floor as von Schlichten and\nhis Kragans fought their way down from above, but the _Northern Star_\nand her escort of combat-cars and airjeeps bombed and machine-gunned\nand rocketed the fugitives from above, and the loyal Zirk cavalry,\nbursting through the mob, came up shooting and lancing. By this time,\nan aircar fitted with a sound-amplifier was circling overhead, while a\nloyal native-officer of the Sixth N.U.N.I. shouted offers of quarter\nand orders to the troops to spare any who surrendered.\n\nDriving down from above, von Schlichten and his Kragans slithered over\nfloors increasingly greasy with yellow Ulleran blood. He had picked up\na broadsword at the foot of the first stairway down; a little later,\nhe tossed it aside in favor of another, better balanced and with a\nbetter guard. There was a furious battle at the doorways of the throne\nroom; finally, climbing over the bodies of their own dead and the\nenemy's, they were inside.\n\nHere there was no question of quarter whatever, at least as long as\nFirkked lived; North Ulleran nobles did not surrender under the eyes\nof their king, and North Ulleran kings did not surrender their thrones\nalive. There was also a tradition, of which von Schlichten was\nmindful, that a king must only be killed by his conqueror, in personal\ncombat, with steel.\n\nWith a wedge of Kragan bayonets around him and the picked-up\nbroadsword in his hand, he fought his way to the throne, where Firkked\nwaited, a sword in one of his upper hands, his Spear of State in the\nother, and a dagger in each lower hand. With his left hand, von\nSchlichten detached the bayonet from the rifle of one of his followers\nand went forward, trying not to think of the absurdity of a man of the\nSixth Century A.E., the representative of a civilized Chartered\nCompany, dueling to the death with swords with a barbarian king for a\nthrone he had promised to another barbarian, or of what could happen\non Uller if he allowed this four-armed monstrosity to kill him.\n\nIt was not as bad as it looked, however. The ornate Spear of State, in\nspite of its long, cruel-looking blade, was not an especially good\ncombat-weapon, at least for one hand, and Firkked seemed confused by\nthe very abundance of his armament. After a few slashes and jabs, von\nSchlichten knocked the unwieldy thing from his opponent's hand. This\nraised a fearful ululation from the Skilkan nobility, who had stopped\nfighting to watch the duel; evidently it was the very worst sort of a\nbad omen. Firkked, seemingly relieved to be disencumbered of the\nthing, caught his sword in both hands and aimed a roundhouse swing at\nvon Schlichten's head; von Schlichten dodged, crippled one of\nFirkked's lower hands with a quick slash, and lunged at the royal\nbelly. Firkked used his remaining dagger to parry, backed a step\ncloser to his throne, and took another swing with his sword, which von\nSchlichten parried on the bayonet in his left hand. Then, backing, he\nslashed at the inside of Firkked's leg with the thousand-year-old\n_coup-de-Jarnac_. Firkked, unable to support the weight of his\ndense-tissued body on one leg, stumbled; von Schlichten ran him neatly\nthrough the breast with his sword and through the throat with the\nbayonet.\n\nThere was silence in the throne room for an instant, and then, with a\nhorrible collective shriek, the Skilkans threw down their weapons. One\nof von Schlichten's Kragans slung his rifle and picked up the Spear of\nState with all four hands, taking his post ceremoniously behind the\nvictor. A couple of others dragged the body of Firkked to the edge of\nthe dais, and one of them drew his leaf-shaped short-sword and\nbeheaded it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt mid-afternoon, von Schlichten was on the roof of the Palace,\nholding the Spear of State, with Firkked's head impaled on the point,\nwhile a Terran technician aimed an audio-visual recorder.\n\n\"This,\" he said, with the geek-speaker in his mouth, \"is King\nFirkked's Spear of State, and here, upon it, is King Firkked's head.\nTwo days ago, Firkked was at peace with the Company, and Firkked was\nKing in Skilk. If he had not dared raise his feeble hand against the\nmight of the Uller Company, he would still be alive, and his Spear\nwould still be borne behind him. So must all those who rise against\nthe Company perish.... Cut.\"\n\nThe camera stopped. A Kragan came forward and took the Spear of State,\nwith its grisly burden, carrying it to a nearby wall and leaning it\nup, like a piece of stage property no longer required for this scene\nbut needed for the next. Von Schlichten took out his geek-speaker,\nwiped and pouched it, and took his cigarette case from his pocket.\n\n\"Well, this is the limit!\" Paula Quinton, who had come up during the\nfilming of the scene, exploded. \"I thought you had to kill him\nyourself in order to encourage your soldiers; I didn't think you\nwanted to make a movie of it to show your friends. I'm through; you\ncan find yourself a new adjutant!\"\n\nVon Schlichten tapped the cigarette on the gold-and-platinum case and\nstared at her through his monocle.\n\n\"You can't resign,\" he told her. \"Resignations of officers are not\nbeing accepted until the end of hostilities. In any case, I shouldn't\ncare to have you go; you're the best adjutant, Hideyoshi O'Leary not\nexcepted, I ever had. Sit down, colonel.\" He lit the cigarette. \"Your\npolitico-military education still needs a little filling in.\n\n\"At Grank, we have two ships. One is the _Northern Lights_, sister\nship of the _Northern Star_. The other is the cruiser _Procyon_, the\nonly real warship on Uller, with a main battery of four 200-mm guns.\nHow King Yoorkerk was able to get control of those ships I don't know,\nbut there will be a board of inquiry and maybe a couple of\ncourts-martial, when things get stabilized to a point where we can\nafford such luxuries. As it is, we need those ships desperately, and\nas soon as he gets in, I'm sending Hideyoshi O'Leary to Grank with\nthe _Northern Star_ and a load of Kragan Rifles, to pry them loose.\nThe audio-visual of which this is the last scene is going to be one of\nthe crowbars he's going to use.\"\n\n\"Oh! I get it!\" Her eyes widened with pleasure at having finally\ncaught on; she accepted the cigarette and the light von Schlichten\noffered. \"Good old _nervenkrieg_!\"\n\n\"Yes. A little idea I adapted from my Nazi ancestors of four hundred\nand fifty years ago. Hideyoshi's going to treat King Yoorkerk to a\nmovie-show. Want to bet he won't loosen up and release _Procyon_ and\n_Northern Lights_ and unblockade the Grank Residency after he sees\nthat shot of Firkked's head leering at him off the point of that\novergrown asagai? As I said, that's only the last scene, too. I've\nbeen having scenes shot all through this fight; some of them are\nreally horrifying.\"\n\n\"But why did you have to fight Firkked yourself?\" she asked. \"You took\nan awful chance, with two hands to his four.\"\n\n\"Not so awful, remember what I told you about the physical limitations\nof Ullerans. But I had to kill him myself, with a sword; according to\nlocal custom that makes me King of Skilk.\"\n\n\"Why, your Majesty!\" She rose and curtsied mockingly. \"But I thought\nyou were going to make Jonkvank King of Skilk.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Just Viceroy,\" he corrected. \"I'm handing the\nSpear of State down to him, not up to him; he'll reign as my vassal,\nand, consequently, as vassal of the Company, and before long, he won't\nbe much more at Krink either. That'll take a little longer--there'll\nhave to be military missions, and economic missions, and\ntrade-agreements, and all the rest of it, first--but he's on the way\nto becoming a puppet-prince.\"\n\nHalf an hour later, a large and excessively ornate air-launch,\nspecially built at the Konkrook shipyards for King Jonkvank, was\nsighted coming over the mountain from the east. An escort of\ncombat-cars was sent to meet it, and a battalion of Kragans and the\nsurvivors of Firkked's court were drawn up on the Palace roof.\n\n\"His Majesty, Jonkvank, King of Krink!\" the former herald of King\nFirkked's court, now herald to King Carlos von Schlichten, shouted,\nbanging on a brass shield with the flat of his sword, as Jonkvank\ndescended from his launch, attended by a group of his nobles and his\nSpear of State, with Hideyoshi O'Leary and Francis N. Shapiro\nshepherding them. As the guests advanced across the roof, the herald\nbanged again on his shield.\n\n\"His Majesty, Carlos von Schlichten,\"--which came out more or less as\nKarlok vonk Zlikdenk--\"King, by right of combat, of Skilk!\"\n\nVon Schlichten advanced to meet his fellow-monarch, his own Spear of\nState, with Firkked's head still grinning from it, two paces behind\nhim.\n\nJonkvank stopped, his face contorted with saurian rage.\n\n\"What is this?\" he demanded. \"You told me that I could be King of\nSkilk; is this how a Terran keeps his word?\"\n\n\"A Terran's word is always good, Jonkvank,\" von Schlichten replied,\nomitting the titles, as was proper in one sovereign addressing\nanother. \"My word was that you should reign in Skilk, and my word\nstands. But these things must be done decently, according to custom\nand law. I killed Firkked in single combat. Had I not done so, the\nSpear of Skilk would have been left lying, for any of the young of\nFirkked to pick up. Is that not the law?\"\n\nJonkvank nodded grudgingly. \"It is the law,\" he admitted.\n\n\"Good. Now, since I killed Firkked in lawful manner, his Spear is\nmine, and what is mine I can give as I please. I now give you the\nSpear of Skilk, to carry in my name, as I promised.\"\n\nThe Kragan who was carrying the ceremonial weapon tossed the head of\nFirkked from the point; another Kragan kicked it aside and advanced to\nwipe the spear-blade with a rag. Von Schlichten took the Spear and\ngave it to Jonkvank.\n\n\"This is not good!\" one of the Skilkan nobles protested. He had a\nbetter right than any of the others to protest; he had, a few hours\nbefore, ridden in at the head of a company of his retainers to swear\nloyalty to the Company. \"That you should rule over us, yes. You killed\nFirkked in single combat, and you are the soldier of the Company,\nwhich is mighty, as all here have seen. But that this foreigner be\ngiven the Spear of Skilk, that is not good!\"\n\nSome of the others, emboldened by his example, were jabbering\nagreement.\n\n\"Listen, all of you!\" von Schlichten shouted. \"Here is no question of\nKrink ruling over Skilk. Does it matter who holds the Spear of Skilk,\nwhen he does so in my name? And King Jonkvank will be no foreigner. He\nwill come and live among you, and later he will travel back and forth\nbetween Krink and Skilk, and he will leave the Spear of Krink in\nKrink, and the Spear of Skilk in Skilk, and in Skilk he will be a\nSkilkan.\"\n\nThat seemed to satisfy everybody except Jonkvank, and he had wit\nenough not to make an issue of it. He even had the Spear of Krink\ncarried back aboard his launch, out of sight, and when he accompanied\nvon Schlichten, an hour later, to see Hideyoshi O'Leary off for Grank,\nhe had the Spear of Skilk carried behind him. When he was alone with\nvon Schlichten, in the room that had been King Firkked's bedchamber,\nhowever, he exploded: \"What is all this foolishness which you promised\nthese people in my name and which I must now carry out? That I am to\nleave the Spear of Skilk in Skilk and the Spear of Krink in Krink, and\ncome here to live....\"\n\n\"You wish to hold Skilk?\" von Schlichten asked.\n\n\"I intend to hold Skilk. To begin with, there shall be a great killing\nhere. A very great killing: of all those who advised that fool of a\nFirkked to start this business; of those who gave shelter to the false\nprophet, Rakkeed, when he was here; of the faithless priests who gave\near to his abominable heresies and allowed him to spew out his\nblasphemies in the temples; of those who sent spies to Krink, to\ncorrupt and pervert my soldiers and nobles; of those who....\"\n\n\"All that is as it should be,\" von Schlichten agreed. \"Except that it\nmust be done quickly and all at once, before the memories of these\ncrimes fade from the minds of the people. And great care must be taken\nto kill only those who can be proven to be guilty of something; thus\nit will be said that the justice of King Jonkvank is terrible to\nevildoers but a protection and a shield to those who keep the peace\nand obey the laws. Thus you will gain the name of being a wise and\njust king. And when the priests are to be killed it should be done\nunder the direction of those other priests who were faithful to the\ngods and whom King Firkked drove out of their temples, and it must be\ndone in the name of the gods. Thus will you be esteemed a pious, and\nnot an impious, king. As to why you must be a Skilkan in Skilk, you\nheard the words of Flurknurk, and how the others agreed with him. It\nmust not be allowed to seem that the city has come under foreign rule.\nAnd you must not change the laws, unless the people petition you to do\nso, nor must you increase the taxes, and you must not confiscate the\nestates of those who are put to death, for the death of parents is\nalways forgiven before the loss of patrimonies. And you should select\ncertain Skilkan nobles, and become the father of their young, and\nabove all, you must leave none of the young of Firkked alive, to raise\nrebellion against you later.\"\n\nJonkvank nodded, deeply impressed. \"By the gods, Karlok vonk Zlikdenk,\nthis is wisdom! Now it is to be seen why the likes of Firkked cannot\nprevail against you, or against the Company as long as you are the\nCompany's upper sword-arm!\"\n\nHonesty tempted von Schlichten, for a moment, to disclaim originality\nfor the principles he had just enunciated, even at the price of trying\nto pronounce the name of Niccolo Machiavelli with a geek-speaker. On\nsecond thought, however, considerations of policy restrained him. If\nJonkvank ever heard of _The Prince_, nothing would satisfy him short\nof an Ulleran translation, and von Schlichten would have been just\nabout as happy over an Ulleran translation of a complete set of\nBethe-cycle bomb specifications.\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\nThe Shadow of Niflheim\n\n\nThe sun slid lower and lower toward the horizon behind them as the\naircar bulleted south along the broad valley and dry bed of the Hoork\nRiver, nearing the zone of equal day and night. Hassan Bogdanoff drove\nwhile Harry Quong finished his lunch, then changed places to begin his\nown. Von Schlichten got two bottles of beer from the refrigerated\nsection of the lunch-hamper and opened one for Paula Quinton and one\nfor himself.\n\n\"What are we going to do with these geeks,\"--she was using the nasty\nand derogatory word unconsciously and by custom, now--\"after this is\nall over? We can't just tell them, 'Jolly well played, nice game,\nwasn't it?' and go back to where we were Wednesday evening.\"\n\n\"No, we can't. There's going to have to be a Terran seizure of\npolitical power in every part of this planet that we occupy, and as\nsoon as we're consolidated around and north of Takkad Sea, we're going\nto have to move in elsewhere,\" he replied. \"Keegark, Konkrook, and the\nFree Cities, of course, will be relatively easy. They're in arms\nagainst us now, and we can take them over by force. We had to make\nthat deal with Jonkvank, or, rather, I did, so that will be a slower\nprocess, but we'll get it done in time. If I know that pair as well as\nI think I do, Jonkvank and Yoorkerk will give us plenty of pretexts,\nbefore long. Then, we can start giving them government by law instead\nof by royal decree, and real courts of justice; put an end to the\nhead-payment system, and to these arbitrary mass arrests and\ntax-delinquency imprisonments that are nothing but slave-raids by the\ngeek princes on their own people. And, gradually, abolish serfdom. In\na couple of centuries, this planet will be fit to admit to the\nFederation, like Odin and Freya.\"\n\n\"Well, won't that depend a lot on whom the Company sends here to take\nHarrington's place?\"\n\n\"Unless I'm much mistaken, the Company will confirm me,\" he replied.\n\"Administration on Uller is going to be a military matter for a long\ntime to come, and even the Banking Cartel and the mercantile interests\nin the Company are going to realize that, and see the necessity for\ntaking political control. The Federation Government owns a bigger\ninterest in the Company than the public realizes, too; they've always\nfavored it. And just to make sure, I'm sending Hid O'Leary to Terra on\nthe next ship, to make a full report on the situation.\"\n\n\"You think it'll be cleared up by then? The _City of Montevideo_ is\ndue in from Niflheim in a little under three months.\"\n\n\"It'll have to be cleared up by then. We can't keep this war going\nmore than a month, at the present rate. Police-action, and mopping-up,\nyes, full-scale war, no.\"\n\n\"Ammunition?\" she asked.\n\nHe looked at her in pleased surprise. \"Your education has been\nprogressing, at that,\" he said. \"You know, a lot of professional\nofficers, even up to field rank in the combat branches, seem to think\nthat ammo comes down miraculously from Heaven, in contragravity\nlorries, every time they pray into a radio for it. It doesn't; it has\nto be produced as fast as it's expended, and we haven't been doing\nthat. So we'll have to lick these geeks before it runs out, because we\ncan't lick them with gunbutts and bayonets.\"\n\n\"Well, how about nuclear weapons?\" Paula asked. \"I hate to suggest\nit--I know what they did on Mimir, and Fenris, and Midgard, and what\nthey did on Terra, during the First Century. But it may be our only\nchance.\"\n\nHe finished his beer and shoved the bottle into the waste-receiver,\nthen got out his cigarettes.\n\n\"I'd hate to have to make a decision like that, Paula,\" he told her.\n\"The military use of nuclear energy is the last--well, the\nnext-to-last--thing I'd want to see on Uller. Fortunately, or\nunfortunately, it's a decision I won't have to make. There isn't a\nsingle nuclear bomb on the planet. The Company's always refused to\nallow them to be manufactured or stockpiled here.\"\n\n\"I don't think there'd be any criticism of your making them, now,\ngeneral. And there's certainly plenty of plutonium. You could make\nA-bombs, at least.\"\n\n\"There isn't anybody here who even knows how to make one. Most of our\nnuclear engineers could work one up, in about three months, when we'd\neither not need one or not be alive.\"\n\n\"Dr. Gomes, who came in on the _Pretoria_, two weeks ago, can make\nthem,\" she contradicted. \"He built at least a dozen of them on\nNiflheim, to use in activating volcanoes and bringing ore-bearing lava\nto the surface.\"\n\nVon Schlichten's hand, bringing his lighter to the tip of his\ncigarette, paused for a second. Then he completed the operation,\nsnapped it shut, and put it away.\n\n\"When did all this happen?\"\n\nShe took time out for mental arithmetic; even a spaceship officer had\nto do that, when a question of interstellar time-relations arose.\n\n\"About three-fifty days ago, Galactic Standard. They'd put off the\nfirst shot, six bombs, before I got in from Terra. I saw the second\nshot a day or so before I left Niflheim on the _Canberra_. Dr. Gomes\nhad to stay over till the _Pretoria_ to put off the third shot. Why?\"\n\n\"Did you run into a geek named Gorkrink, while you were on Nif?\" he\nasked her. \"And what sort of work was he doing?\"\n\n\"Gorkrink? I don't seem to remember.... Oh, yes! He was helping Dr.\nMurillo, the seismologist. His year was up after the second shot; he\ncame to Uller on the _Canberra_. Dr. Murillo was sorry to lose him. He\nunderstood Lingua Terra perfectly; Dr. Murillo could talk to him, the\nway you do with Kankad, without using a geek-speaker.\"\n\n\"Well, but what sort of work ...?\"\n\n\"Helping set and fire the A-bombs.... _Oh! Good Lord!_\"\n\n\"You can say that again, and deal in Allah, Shiva, and Kali,\" von\nSchlichten told her. \"Especially Kali.... Harry! See if you can get\nsome more speed out of this can. I want to get to Konkrook while it's\nstill there!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was full dark when Konkrook came in view beyond the East Konk\nMountains, a lurid smear on the underside of the clouds, and, at\nGongonk Island and at the Company farms to the south, a couple of\nbunches of searchlights fingering about in the sky. When von\nSchlichten turned on the outside sound-pickup, he could hear the\ndistant tom-tomming of heavy guns, and the crash of shells and bombs.\nKeeping the car high enough to be above the trajectories of incoming\nshells, Harry Quong circled over the city while Hassan Bogdanoff\ntalked to Gongonk Island on the radio.\n\nThe city was in a bad way. There were seventy-five to a hundred big\nfires going, and a new one started in a rising ball of thermoconcentrate\nflame while they watched. The three gun-cutters, _Elmoran_, _Gaucho_,\nand _Bushranger_, and about fifty big freight lorries converted to\nbombers, were shuttling back and forth between the island and the city.\nThe Royal Palace was on fire from end to end, and the entire waterfront\nand industrial district were in flames. Combat-cars and airjeeps were\ndiving in to shell and rocket and machine-gun streets and buildings. He\nsaw six big bomber-lorries move in dignified procession to unload, one\nafter the other, on a row of buildings along what the Terrans called\nSouth Tenth Street, and on the roofs of buildings a block away, red and\nblue flares were burning, and he could see figures, both human and\nUlleran, setting up mortars and machine-guns.\n\nLanding on the top stage of Company House, on the island, they were\nmet by a Terran whom von Schlichten had seen, a few days ago, bossing\nnative-labor at the spaceport, but who was now wearing a major's\ninsignia. He greeted von Schlichten with a salute which he must have\nlearned from some movie about the ancient French Foreign Legion. Von\nSchlichten seriously returned it in kind.\n\n\"Everybody's down in the Governor-General's office, sir,\" he said.\n\"Your office, that is. King Kankad's here with us, too.\"\n\nHe accompanied them to the elevator, then turned to a telephone; when\nvon Schlichten and Paula reached the office, everybody was crowded at\nthe door to greet them: Themistocles M'zangwe, his arm in a sling;\nHans Meyerstein, the Johannesburg lawyer, who seemed to have even more\nBantu blood than the brigadier-general; Morton Buhrmann, the\nCommercial Superintendent; Laviola, the Fiscal Secretary; a dozen or\nso other officers and civil administrators. There was a hubbub of\ngreetings, and he was pleased to detect as much real warmth from the\ncivil administration crowd as from the officers.\n\n\"Well, I'm glad to be back with you,\" he replied, generally. \"And let\nme present Colonel Paula Quinton, my new adjutant; Hid O'Leary's on\nduty in the north.... Them, this was a perfectly splendid piece of\nwork here; you can take this not only as a personal congratulation,\nbut as a sort of unit citation for the whole crowd. You've all behaved\nsimply above praise.\" He turned to King Kankad, who was wearing a pair\nof automatics in shoulder-holsters for his upper hands and another\npair in cross-body belt holsters for his lower. \"And what I've said\nfor anybody else goes double for you, Kankad,\" he added, clapping the\nKragan on the shoulder.\n\n\"All he did was save the lot of us!\" M'zangwe said. \"We were hanging\non by our fingernails here till his people started coming in. And\nthen, after you sent the _Aldebaran_....\"\n\n\"Where is the _Aldebaran_, by the way? I didn't see her when I came\nin.\"\n\n\"Based on Kankad's, flying bombardment against Keegark, and keeping\nan eye out for those ships. Prinsloo caught the _De Wett_ in the docks\nthere and smashed her, but the _Jan Smuts_ got away, and we haven't\nbeen able to locate the _Oom Paul Kruger_, either. They're probably\nboth on the Eastern Shore, gathering up reenforcements for Orgzild,\"\nM'zangwe said.\n\n\"Our ability to move troops rapidly is what's kept us on top this\nlong, and Orgzild's had plenty of time to realize it,\" von Schlichten\nsaid. \"When we get _Procyon_ down here, I'm going to send her out,\nwith a screen of light scout-vehicles, to find those ships and get rid\nof them.... How's Hid been making out, at Grank, by the way? I didn't\nhave my car-radio on, coming down.\"\n\nThat touched off another hubbub: \"Haven't you heard, general?\" ...\n\"Oh, my God, this is simply out of this continuum!\" ... \"Well, tell\nhim, somebody!\" ... \"No, get Hid on the screen; it's his story!\"\n\nSomebody busied himself at the switchboard. The rest of them sat down\nat the long conference-table. Laviola and Meyerstein and Buhrmann were\nespecially obsequious in seating von Schlichten in Sid Harrington's\nold chair, and in getting a chair for Paula Quinton. After a while,\nthe jumbled colors on the big screen resolved themselves into an image\nof Hideyoshi O'Leary, grinning like a pussy-cat beside an empty\ngoldfish-bowl.\n\n\"Well, what happened?\" von Schlichten asked, after they had exchanged\ngreetings. \"How did Yoorkerk like the movies? And did you get the\n_Procyon_ and the _Northern Lights_ loose?\"\n\n\"Yoorkerk was deeply impressed,\" O'Leary replied. \"His story is that\nhe is and always was the true and ever-loving friend of the Company;\nhe acted to prevent quote certain disloyal elements unquote from\nharming the people and property of the Company. _Procyon's_ on the way\nto Konkrook. I'm holding _Northern Lights_ here and _Northern Star_ at\nSkilk; where do you want them sent?\"\n\n\"Leave _Northern Star_ at Skilk, for the time being. Tell the\nCompany's great and good friend King Yoorkerk that the Company expects\nhim to contribute some soldiers for the campaign here and against\nKeegark, when that starts; be sure you get the best-armed and\nbest-trained regiments he has, and get them down here as soon as\npossible. Don't send any of your Kragans or Karamessinis' troops here,\nthough; hold them in Grank till we make sure of the quality of\nYoorkerk's friendship.\"\n\n\"Well, general, I think we can be pretty sure, now. You see, he turned\nRakkeed the Prophet over to me....\"\n\n\"_What_?\" Von Schlichten felt his monocle starting to slip and took a\nfirmer grip on it. \"Who?\"\n\n\"Pay me, Them; he didn't drop it,\" Hideyoshi O'Leary said. \"Why,\nRakkeed the Prophet. Yoorkerk was holding our ships and our people in\ncase we lost; he was also holding Rakkeed at the Palace in case we\nwon. Of course, Rakkeed thought he was an honored guest, right up till\nYoorkerk's guards dragged him in and turned him over to us....\"\n\n\"That geek,\" von Schlichten said, \"is too smart for his own good. Some\nof these days he's going to play both ends against the middle and both\nends'll fold in on him and smash him.\" A suspicion occurred to him.\n\"You sure this is Rakkeed? It would be just like Yoorkerk to try to\nsell us a ringer.\"\n\nO'Leary shook his head solemnly. \"I thought of that, right away. This\nis the real article; Karamessinis' Constabulary and Intelligence\nofficers certified him for me. What do you want me to do, send him\ndown to Konkrook?\"\n\nVon Schlichten shook his head. \"Get the priests of the locally\nvenerated gods to put him on trial for blasphemy, heresy,\nimpersonating a prophet, practicing witchcraft without a license, or\nany other ecclesiastical crimes you or they can think of. Then, after\nhe's been given a scrupulously fair trial, have the soldiers of King\nYoorkerk behead him, and stick his head up over a big sign, in all\nnative languages, 'Rakkeed the False Prophet.' And have audio-visuals\nmade of the whole business, trial and execution, and be sure that the\npriests and Yoorkerk's officers are in the foreground and our people\nstay out of the pictures.\"\n\n\"Soap and towels, for General Pontius von Pilate!\" Paula Quinton\ncalled out.\n\n\"That's an idea; I was wondering what to give Yoorkerk as a\ntestimonial present,\" Hideyoshi O'Leary said. \"A nice thirty-piece\nsilver set!\"\n\n\"Quite appropriate,\" von Schlichten approved. \"Well, you did a first-class\njob. I want you back with us as soon as possible--incidentally, you're now\na brigadier-general--but not till the situation at Grank-Krink-Skilk is\nstabilized. And, eventually, you'll probably have to set up permanent\nheadquarters in the north.\"\n\nAfter Hideyoshi O'Leary had thanked him and signed off, and the screen\nwas dark again, he turned to the others.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, I don't think we need worry too much about the\nnorth, for the next few days. How long do you estimate this operation\nagainst Konkrook's going to take, to complete pacification, Them?\"\n\n\"How complete is complete pacification, general?\" Themistocles\nM'zangwe wanted to know. \"If you mean to the end of organized\nresistance by larger than squad-size groups, I'd say three days, give\nor take twelve hours. Of course, there'll be small groups holding out\nfor a couple of weeks, particularly in the farming country and back in\nthe forest....\"\n\n\"We can forget them; that's minor-tactics stuff. We'll need to keep\nsome kind of an occupation force here for some time; they can deal\nwith that. We'll have to get to work on Keegark, as soon as possible;\nafter we've reduced Keegark, we'll be able to reorganize for a\ncampaign against the Free Cities on the Eastern Shore.\"\n\n\"Begging your pardon, general, but reduce is a mild word for what we\nought to do to Keegark,\" Hans Meyerstein said. \"We ought to raze that\ncity as flat as a football field, and then play football on it with\nKing Orgzild's head.\"\n\n\"Any special reason?\" von Schlichten asked. \"In addition to the\nBlount-Lemoyne massacre, that is?\"\n\n\"I should say so, general!\" Themistocles M'zangwe backed Meyerstein\nup. \"Bob, you tell him.\"\n\nColonel Robert Grinell, the Intelligence officer, got up and took the\ncigar out of his mouth. He was short and round-bodied and bald-headed,\nbut he was old Terran Federation Regular Army.\n\n\"Well, general, we've been finding out quite a bit about the genesis\nof this business, lately,\" he said. \"From up north, it probably looked\nlike an all-Rakkeed show; that's how it was supposed to look. But the\nwhole thing was hatched at Keegark, by King Orgzild. We've managed to\ncapture a few prominent Konkrookans\"--he named half a dozen--\"who've\nbeen made to talk, and a number of others have come in voluntarily and\nfurnished information. Orgzild conceived the scheme in the beginning;\nRakkeed was just the messenger-boy. My face gets the color of the\nCompany trademark every time I think that the whole thing was planned\nfor over a year, right under our noses, even to the signal that was to\ntouch the whole thing off....\"\n\n\"The poisoning of Sid Harrington, and our announcement of his death?\"\nvon Schlichten asked.\n\n\"You figured that out yourself, sir? Well, that was it.\" Grinell went\non to elaborate, while von Schlichten tried to keep the impatience out\nof his face. Beside him, Paula Quinton was fidgeting, too; she was\nthinking, as he was, of what King Orgzild and Prince Gorkrink were\ndoing now. \"And I know positively that the order for the poisoning of\nSid Harrington came from the Keegarkan Embassy here, and was passed\ndown through Gurgurk and Keeluk to this geek here who actually put the\npoison in the whiskey.\"\n\n\"Yes. I agree that Keegark should be wiped out, and I'd like to have\nan immediate estimate on the time it'll take to build a nuclear bomb\nto do the job. One of the old-fashioned plutonium fission A-bombs will\ndo quite well.\"\n\nEverybody turned quickly. There was a momentary silence, and then\nColonel Evan Colbert, of the Fourth Kragan Rifles, the senior officer\nunder Themistocles M'zangwe, found his voice.\n\n\"If that's an order, general, we'll get it done. But I'd like to\nremind you, first, of the Company policy on nuclear weapons on this\nplanet.\"\n\n\"I'm aware of that policy. I'm also aware of the reason for it. We've\nbeen compelled, because of the lack of natural fuel on Uller, to set\nup nuclear power reactors and furnish large quantities of plutonium to\nthe geeks to fuel them. The Company doesn't want the natives here\nlearning of the possibility of using nuclear energy for destructive\npurposes. Well, gentlemen, that's a dead issue. They've learned it,\nthanks to our people on Niflheim, and unless my estimate is entirely\nwrong, King Orgzild already has at least one First-Century\nNagasaki-type plutonium bomb. I am inclined to believe that he had at\nleast one such bomb, probably more, at the time when orders were sent\nto his embassy here, for the poisoning of Governor-General\nHarrington.\"\n\nWith that, he selected a cigarette from his case, offered it to Paula,\nand snapped his lighter. She had hers lit, and he was puffing on his\nown, when the others finally realized what he had told them.\n\n\"That's impossible!\" somebody down the table shouted, as though that\nwould make it so. Another--one of the civil administration\ncrowd--almost exactly repeated Jules Keaveney's words at Skilk: \"What\nthe hell was Intelligence doing, sleeping?\"\n\n\"General von Schlichten,\" Colonel Grinell took oblique cognizance of\nthe question, \"you've just made, by implication, a most grave charge\nagainst my department. If you're not mistaken in what you've just\nsaid, I deserve to be court-martialed.\"\n\n\"I couldn't bring charges against you, colonel; if it were a\ncourt-martial matter, I'd belong in the dock with you,\" von Schlichten\ntold him. \"It seems, though, that a piece of vital information was\npossessed by those who were unable to evaluate it, and until this\nafternoon, I was ignorant of its existence. Colonel Quinton, suppose\nyou repeat what you told me, on the way down from Skilk.\"\n\n\"Well, general, don't you think we ought to have Dr. Gomes do that?\"\nPaula asked. \"After all, he constructed those bombs on Niflheim, and\nit'll be he who'll have to build ours.\"\n\n\"That's right.\" He looked around. \"Where's Dr. Louren\u00e7o Gomes, the\nnuclear engineer who came in on the _Pretoria_, two weeks ago? Send\nout for him, and get him in here at once.\"\n\nThere was another awkward silence. Then Kent Pickering, the chief of\nthe Gongonk Island power-plant, cleared his throat.\n\n\"Why, general, didn't you know? Dr. Gomes is dead. He was killed\nduring the first half hour of the uprising.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\nA Bag of Tricks We Don't Have\n\n\nHe flinched inwardly, and tightened his eye-muscles on the edge of the\nmonocle to keep from flinching physically as well, trying to freeze\nout of his face the consternation he felt.\n\n\"That's bad, Kent,\" he said. \"Very bad. I'd been counting heavily on\nDr. Gomes to design a bomb of our own.\"\n\n\"Well, general, if you please.\" That was Air-Commodore Leslie\nHargreaves. \"You say you suspect that King Orgzild has developed a\nnuclear bomb. If that's true, it's a horrible danger to all of us. But\nI find it hard to believe that the Keegarkans could have done so, with\ntheir resources and at their technological level. Now, if it had been\nthe Kragans, that would have been different, but....\"\n\n\"Paula, you'd better carry on and explain what you told me, and add\nanything else you can think of that might be relevant.... Is that\nsound-recorder turned on? Then turn it on, somebody; we want this\ntaped.\"\n\nPaula rose and began talking: \"I suppose you all understand what\nconditions are on Niflheim, and how these Ulleran native workers are\nemployed; however, I'd better begin by explaining the purpose for\nwhich these nuclear bombs were designed and used....\"\n\nHe smiled; she realized that he needed time to think, and she was\nstalling to provide it. He drew a pencil and pad toward him and began\ndoodling in a bored manner, deliberately closing his mind to what she\nwas saying. There were two assumptions, he considered: first, that\nKing Orgzild already possessed a nuclear bomb which he could use when\nhe chose, and, second, that in the absence of Dr. Gomes, such a bomb\ncould only be produced on Gongonk Island after lengthy experimental\nwork. If both of these assumptions were true, he had just heard the\ndeath-sentence of every Terran on Uller. The first he did not for a\nmoment doubt. The reasons for making it were too good. He dismissed it\nfrom further consideration and concentrated on the second.\n\n\"... what's known as a Nagasaki-type bomb, the first type of\nplutonium-bomb developed,\" Paula was saying. \"Really, it's a\ntechnological antique, but it was good enough for the purpose, and Dr.\nGomes could build it with locally available materials....\"\n\nThat was the crux of it. The plutonium bomb, from a military\nstandpoint, was as obsolete as the flintlock musket had been at the\ntime of the Second World War. He reviewed, quickly, the history of\nweapons-development since the beginning of the Atomic Era. The\nemphasis, since the end of the Second World War, had all been on\nnuclear weapons and rocket-missiles. There had been the H-bomb, itself\nobsolescent, and the Bethe-cyle bomb, and the subneutron bomb, and the\nomega-ray bomb, and the nega-matter bomb, and then the end of\ncivilization in the Northern Hemisphere and the rise of the new\ncivilization in South America and South Africa and Australia. Today,\nthe small-arms and artillery his troops were using were merely slight\nrefinements on the weapons of the First Century, and all the modern\nnuclear weapons used by the Terran Federation were produced at the\nSpace Navy base on Mars, by a small force of experts whose skills were\nalmost as closed to the general scientific and technical world as the\nsecrets of a medieval guild. The old A-bomb was an historical\ncuriosity, and there was nobody on Uller who had more than a layman's\nknowledge of the intricate technology of modern nuclear weapons. There\nwere plenty of good nuclear-power engineers on Gongonk Island, but how\nlong would it take them to design and build a plutonium bomb?\n\n\"... also has a good understanding of Lingua Terra,\" Paula was saying.\n\"He and Dr. Murillo conversed bilingually, just as I've heard General\nvon Schlichten and King Kankad talking to one another. I haven't any\nidea whether or not Gorkrink could read Lingua Terra, or, if so, what\npapers or plans he might have seen.\"\n\n\"Just a minute, Paula,\" he said. \"Colonel Grinell, what does your\nbranch have on this Gorkrink?\"\n\n\"He's the son of King Orgzild, and the daughter of Prince Jurnkonk,\"\nGrinell said. \"We knew he'd signed on for Nif, two years ago, but the\nstory we got was that he'd fallen out of favor at court and had been\nexiled. I can see, now, that that was planted to mislead us. As to\nwhether or not he can read Lingua Terra, my belief is that he can. We\nknow that he can understand it when spoken. He could have learned to\nread at one of those schools Mohammed Ferriera set up, ten or fifteen\nyears ago.\"\n\n\"And Dr. Gomes and Dr. Murillo and Dr. Livesey left papers and plans\nlying around all over the place,\" Paula added. \"If he went to Niflheim\nas a spy, he could have copied almost anything.\"\n\n\"Well, there you have it,\" von Schlichten said. \"When Gorkrink found\nout that plutonium can be used for bombs, he began gathering all the\ninformation he could. And as soon as he got home, he turned it all\nover to Pappy Orgzild.\"\n\n\"That still doesn't mean that the Kee-geeks were able to do anything\nwith it,\" Air-Commodore Hargreaves argued.\n\n\"I think it does,\" von Schlichten differed. \"As soon as Orgzild would\nhear about the possibility of making a plutonium bomb, he'd set up an\nA-bomb project, and don't think of it in terms of the old First\nCentury Manhattan Project. There would be no problem of producing\nfissionables--we've been scattering refined plutonium over this planet\nlike confetti.\"\n\n\"Well, an A-bomb's a pretty complicated piece of mechanism, even if\nyou have the plans for it,\" Kent Pickering said. \"As I recall, there\nhave to be several subcritical masses of plutonium, or U-235, or\nwhatever, blown together by shaped charges of explosive, all of which\nhave to be fired simultaneously. That would mean a lot of electrical\nfittings that I can't see these geeks making by hand.\"\n\n\"I can,\" Paula said. \"Have you ever seen the work these native\njewelers do? And didn't you tell me about a clockwork thing they have\nat the university here, to show the apparent movements of the sun....\"\n\n\"That's right,\" von Schlichten said. \"And what they couldn't make,\nthey could have bought from us; we've sold them a lot of electrical\nequipment.\"\n\n\"All right, they could have built an A-bomb,\" Buhrmann said. \"But did\nthey?\"\n\n\"We assume they tried to. Gorkrink got back from Nif on the Canberra,\nthree months ago,\" von Schlichten said. \"If Orgzild decided to build\nan A-bomb, he wouldn't give the signal for this uprising until he\neither had one or knew he couldn't make one, and he wouldn't give up\ntrying in only three months. Therefore, I think we can assume that he\nsucceeded, and had succeeded at the time he sent Gorkrink here to get\nthat four tons of plutonium we let him have, and, incidentally, to\ntell Ghroghrank to pass the word to have Sid Harrington poisoned\naccording to plan.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't he just use it on us at the start of the uprising?\"\nMeyerstein wanted to know.\n\n\"Why should he? Getting rid of us is only the first step in Orgzild's\nplan,\" Grinell said. \"Back as far as geek history goes, the Kings of\nKeegark have been trying to conquer Konkrook and the Free Cities and\nmake themselves masters of the whole Takkad Sea area. Let Konkrook\nwipe us out, and then he can move in his troops and take Konkrook. Or,\nif we beat off the geeks here, as we seem to be doing, he can bomb us\nout and then move in on Konkrook. I think that as long as we're\nfighting here, he'll wait. The more damage we do to Konkrook, the\neasier it'll be for him.\"\n\n\"Then we'd better start dragging our feet on the Konkrook front,\"\nLaviola said. \"And get busy trying to build a bomb of our own.\"\n\nVon Schlichten looked up at the big screen, on which the battle of\nKonkrook was being projected from an overhead pickup.\n\n\"I'll agree on the second half of it,\" von Schlichten said. \"And we'll\nalso have to set up some kind of security-patrol system against\nbombers from Keegark. And as soon as _Procyon_ gets here, we'll have\nto send her out to hunt down and destroy those two Boer-class\nfreighters, the _Jan Smuts_ and the _Kruger_. And we'll have to\narrange for protection of Kankad's Town; that's sure to be another of\nOrgzild's high-priority targets. As to the action against Konkrook,\nI'll rely on your advice, Them. Can we delay the fall of the city for\nany length of time?\"\n\nM'zangwe shook his head. \"When we divert contragravity to\nsecurity-patrol work, the ground action'll slow up a little, of\ncourse. But the geeks are about knocked out, now.\"\n\n\"The hell with it, then. I doubt if we'd be able to buy much time from\nOrgzild by delaying victory in the city, and we'll probably need the\ntroops as workers over here.\" He turned to Pickering. \"Dr. Pickering,\nwhat sort of a crew can you scrape together to design a bomb for us?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"Well, there's Martirano, and Sternberg, and Howard Fu-Chung, and Piet\nvan Reenen, and....\" He nodded to himself. \"I can get six or eight of\nthem in here in about twenty minutes; I'll have a project set up and\nworking in a couple of hours. There has to be somebody qualified on\nduty at the plant, all the time, of course, but....\"\n\n\"All right, call them in. I want the bomb finished by yesterday\nafternoon. And everybody with you, and you, yourself, had better\nrevert to civilian status. This isn't something you can do by the\nnumbers, and I don't want anybody who doesn't know what it's all about\npulling rank on your outfit. Go ahead, call in your gang, and let me\nknow what you'll be able to do, as soon as possible.\"\n\nHe turned to Hargreaves. \"Les, you'll have charge of flying the\nsecurity patrols, and doing anything else you can to keep Orgzild from\nbombing us before we can bomb him. You'll have priority on everything\nsecond only to Pickering.\"\n\nHargreaves nodded. \"As you say, general, we'll have to protect\nKankad's, as well as this place. It's about five hundred miles from\nhere to Kankad's, and eight-fifty miles from Kankad's to Keegark....\"\n\nHe stopped talking to von Schlichten, and began muttering to himself,\nrunning over the names of ships, and the speeds and pay-load\ncapacities of airboats, and distances. In about five minutes, he would\nhave a programme worked out; in the meantime, von Schlichten could\nonly be patient and contain himself. He looked along the table, and\ncaught sight of a thin-faced, saturnine-looking man in a green shirt,\nwith a colonel's three concentric circles marked on the shoulders in\nsilver-paint. Emmett Pearson, the communications chief.\n\n\"Emmett,\" he said, \"those orbiters you have strung around this planet,\ntwo thousand miles out, for telecast rebroadcast stations. How much of\na crew could be put on one of them?\"\n\nPearson laughed. \"Crew of what, general? White mice, or trained\ncockroaches? There isn't room inside one of those things for anything\nbigger to move around.\"\n\n\"Well, I know they're automatic, but how do you service them?\"\n\n\"From the outside. They're only ten feet through, by about twenty in\nlength, with a fifteen-foot ball at either end, and everything's in\nsections, which can be taken out. Our maintenance-gang goes up in a\nthing like a small spaceship, and either works on the outside in\nspacesuits, or puts in a new section and brings the unserviceable one\ndown here to the shops.\"\n\n\"Ah, and what sort of a thing is this small spaceship, now?\"\n\n\"A thing like a pair of fifty-ton lorries, with airlocks between, and\nconnected at the middle; airtight, of course, and pressurized and\ninsulated like a spaceship. One side's living quarters for a six-man\ncrew--sometimes the gang's out for as long as a week at a time--and\nthe other side's a workshop.\"\n\nThat sounded interesting. With contragravity, of course, terms like\n\"escape-velocity\" and \"mass-ratio\" were of purely antiquarian\ninterest.\n\n\"How long,\" he asked Pearson, \"would it take to fit that vehicle with\na full set of detection instruments--radar, infrared and ultra-violet\nvision, electron-telescope, heat and radiation detectors, the whole\nworks--and spot it about a hundred to a hundred and fifty miles above\nKeegark?\"\n\n\"That I couldn't say, general,\" Emmett Pearson replied. \"It'd have to\nbe a shipyard job, and a lot of that stuff's clear outside my\ndepartment. Ask Air-Commodore Hargreaves.\"\n\n\"Les!\" he called out. \"Wake up, Les!\"\n\n\"Just a second, general.\" Hargreaves scribbled frantically on his pad.\n\"Now,\" he said, raising his head. \"What is it, sir?\"\n\n\"Emmett, here, has a junior-grade spaceship that he uses to service\nthose orbital telecast-relay stations of his. He'll tell you what it's\nlike. I want it fitted with every sort of detection device that can be\ncrammed into or onto it, and spotted above Keegark. It should, of\ncourse, be high enough to cover not only the Keegark area, but\nKonkrook, Kankad's, and the lower Hoork and Konk river-valleys.\"\n\n\"Yes, I get it.\" Hargreaves snatched up a phone, punched out a\ncombination, and began talking rapidly into it in a low voice. After a\nwhile, he hung up. \"All right, Mr. Pearson--Colonel Pearson, I mean.\nHave your space-buggy sent around to the shipyard. My boys'll fix it\nup.\" He made a note on another piece of paper. \"If we live through\nthis, I'm going to have a couple of supra-atmosphere ships in service\non this planet.... Now, general, I have a tentative setup. We're\ngoing to need the _Elmoran_ for patrol work south and east of\nKonkrook, and the _Gaucho_ and _Bushranger_ to the north and\nnortheast, based on Kankad's. We'll keep the _Aldebaran_ at Kankad's,\nand use her for emergencies. And we'll have patrols of light\ncontragravity like this.\" He handed a map, with red-pencil and\nblue-pencil markings, along to von Schlichten. \"Red are Kankad-based;\nblue are Konkrook-based.\"\n\n\"That looks all right,\" von Schlichten said. \"There's another thing,\nthough. We want scout-vehicles to cover the Keegark area with\nradiation-detectors. These geeks are quite well aware of\nradiation-danger from fissionables, but they're accustomed to the\nordinary industrial-power reactors, which are either very lightly\nshielded or unshielded on top. We want to find out where Orgzild's\nbomb-plant is.\"\n\n\"Yes, general, as soon as we can get radiation detectors sent out to\nKankad's, we'll have a couple of fast aircars fitted with them for\nthat job.\"\n\n\"We have detectors, at our laboratory and reaction-plant,\" Kankad\nsaid. \"And my people can make more, as soon as you want them.\" He\nthought for a moment. \"Perhaps I should go to the town, now. I could\nbe of more use there than here.\"\n\nKent Pickering, who had been talking with his experts at a table\napart, returned.\n\n\"We've set up a programme, general,\" he said. \"It's going to be a lot\nharder than I'd anticipated. None of us seem to know exactly what we\nhave to do in building one of those things. You see, the uranium or\nplutonium fission-bomb's been obsolete for over four hundred years. It\nwas a classified-secret matter long after its obsolescence, because it\nhadn't been rendered any the less deadly by being superseded--there\nwas that A-bomb that the Christian Anarchist Party put together at\nBuenos Aires in 378 A.E., for instance. And then, after it was\ndeclassified, it had been so far superseded that it was of only\nantiquarian interest; the textbooks dealt with it only in general\nterms. The principles, of course, are part of basic nuclear science;\nthe \"secret of the A-bomb\" was just a bag of engineering tricks that\nwe don't have, and which we will have to rediscover. Design of\ntampers, design of the chemical-explosive charges to bring subcritical\nmasses together, case-design, detonating mechanism, things like that.\"\n\n\"The complete data on even the old Hiroshima and Nagasaki types is\nstill in existence, of course. You can get it at places like the\nUniversity of Montevideo Library, or Jan Smuts Memorial Library at\nCape Town. But we don't have it here. We're detailing a couple of\njunior technicians to make a search of the library here on Gongonk\nIsland, but we're not optimistic. We just can't afford to pass up any\nchance, even when it approaches zero-probability.\"\n\nVon Schlichten nodded. \"That's about what I'd expected,\" he said. \"I\nsuppose Gomes got his data out of one of the dustier storage-stacks at\nJan Smuts or Montevideo, in the first place.... Well, I still want\nthat bomb finished by yesterday afternoon, but since that's\nimpractical, you'll have to take a little--but as little as\npossible--longer.\"\n\n\"What are we going to do about publicity on this?\" Howlett, the\npersonnel man, asked. \"We don't want this getting out in garbled\nform--though how it could be made worse by garbling I couldn't\nguess--and having the troops watching the sky over their shoulders and\ngoing into a panic as soon as they saw something they didn't\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"No, we don't. I've seen a couple of troop-panics,\" von Schlichten\nsaid. \"There can't be anything much worse than a panic.\"\n\n\"I think the Terrans ought to be told the worst,\" Hargreaves said.\n\"And told that our only hope is to get a bomb of our own built and\ndropped first. As to the Kragans.... What do you think, King Kankad?\"\n\n\"Tell them that we are building a bomb to destroy Keegark; that we are\nrunning short of ammunition, and that it is our only hope of finishing\nthe war before the ammunition is gone,\" Kankad said. \"Tell them\nsomething of what sort of a bomb it is. But do not tell them that King\nOrgzild already has such a bomb. Old Kankad, who made me out of\nhimself, told me about how our people fled in panic from the weapons\nof the Terrans, when your people and mine were still enemies. This\nthing is to the weapons they faced then as those weapons were to the\nold Kragans' spears and bows.... And when the geeks from Grank come\nhere, tell them that we are winning and that if they fight well, they\ncan share the loot of Konkrook and Keegark.\"\n\nVon Schlichten looked up at the big screen. Already, Themistocles\nM'zangwe had ordered the Channel Battery to reduce fire; the big guns\nwere firing singly, in thirty-second-interval salvos. There was less\nbombing, too; contragravity was being drawn out of the battle.\n\n\"Well, we all have things to do,\" he said, \"and I think we've\ndiscussed everything there is to discuss. Anybody think of anything\nwe've forgotten?... Then we're adjourned.\"\n\nHe and Paula Quinton took the elevator to the roof, and sat side by\nside, silently watching the conflagration that was raging across the\nchannel and the nearer flashes of the big guns along the island's\ncity side.\n\n\"Wednesday night, I thought we were all cooked,\" Paula told him.\n\"Cleaning up the north in two days seemed like an impossibility, too.\nMaybe you'll do it again.\"\n\n\"If I pull this one out of the fire, I won't be a general; I'll be a\nmagician,\" he said. \"Pickering'll be a magician, I mean; he's the boy\nwho'll save our bacon, if it's saveable.\" He looked somberly across\nthe flame-reflecting water. \"Let's not kid ourselves; we're just\nkicking and biting at the guards on the way up the gallows-steps.\"\n\n\"Well, why stop till the trap's sprung?\" she asked. \"What'll happen to\nthese people on this planet, after we're atomized?\"\n\n\"That I don't want to think about. Kankad's Town will get the second\nbomb; Orgzild won't dare leave the Kragans after he's wiped us out.\nYoorkerk and Jonkvank, in the north, will turn on Keaveney and Shapiro\nand Karamessinis and Hid O'Leary and wipe them out. And when the next\nship gets in here and they find out what happened, they'll send the\nFederation Space Navy, and this planet'll get it worse than Fenris\ndid. They'll blast anything that has four arms and a face like a\nlizard....\"\n\nHalf a dozen aircars lifted suddenly from the airport and streaked\naway to the northeast. As they went past, in the light of the burning\ncity, he could see that at least three of them had multiple\nrocket-launchers on top. In a matter of seconds, a gun-cutter raced\nafter them, and a second, which had been over Konkrook, jettisoned a\nbomb and turned away to follow.\n\n\"Maybe that's it,\" Paula said.\n\n\"Well, if it is, we won't be any better off anywhere else than here,\"\nhe told her. \"Let's stay and watch.\"\n\nAfter what seemed like a long time, however, a twinkle of lights\nshowed over the East Konk Mountains. They weren't the flashes of\nexplosions; some were magnesium flares, and some were the lights of a\nship.\n\n\"That's _Procyon_, from Grank,\" he said. \"Everybody gets a good mark\nfor this--detection stations, interceptors, gun-cutters. If that had\nbeen it, there'd have been a good chance of stopping it.\" He felt\nbetter than he had since Pickering had told him that Louren\u00e7o Gomes\nwas dead. \"It's a good thing Gorkrink didn't pick up any dope on\nguided missiles, while he was at it. As long as they have to deliver\nit with contragravity, we have a chance.\"\n\nThey rose from the balustrade where they had been sitting, and, for\nthe first time, he discovered that he had had his left arm over her\nshoulder and that she had had her right hand resting on the point of\nhis right hip, just above his pistol. He picked up the folder of\npapers she had been carrying, and put her into the elevator ahead of\nhim, and it was only when they parted on the living-quarters level\nthat he recalled having followed the older protocol of gallantry\nrather than the precedence of military rank.\n\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\nThe Reviewers Panned Hell Out of It\n\n\nHe woke with a guilty start and looked up at the clock on the ceiling;\nit was 0945. Kicking himself free of the covers, he slid his feet to\nthe floor and sprinted for the bathroom. While he was fussing to get\nthe shower adjusted to the right temperature, he bludgeoned his\nconscience by telling himself that a wide-awake general is more good\nthan a half-asleep general, that there was nothing he could do but\nhope that Hargreaves's patrols would keep the bomb away from Konkrook\nuntil Pickering's brain-trust came up with one of their own, and that\nthe fact that the commander-in-chief was making sack-time would be\nmuch better for morale than the spectacle of him running around in\ncircles. He shaved carefully; a stubble of beard on his chin might\nbetray the fact that he was worried. Then he dressed, put his monocle\nin his eye, and called the headquarters that had been set up in Sid\nHarrington's--now his--office. A girl at the switchboard appeared on\nhis screen, and gave place to Paula Quinton, who had been up for the\npast two hours.\n\n\"The _Northern Lights_ got in about three hours ago, general,\" she\ntold him. \"She had four of King Yoorkerk's infantry regiments\naboard--the Seventh, Glorious-and-Terrible, the Fourth,\nFirm-in-Adversity, the Second, Strength-of-the-Throne, and the\nTwelfth, Forever-Admirable. They're the sorriest-looking rabble I\never saw, but Hideyoshi says they're the best Yoorkerk has, and they\nall have Terran-style rifles. General M'zangwe broke them into\nbattalions, and put a battalion in with each of the Kragan regiments.\nI think they're more afraid of the Kragans than they are of the\nrebels.\"\n\nHe nodded. That was probably the best way to employ them, within the\nexisting situation. The trouble was, Them M'zangwe was incurably\ntactical-minded. Put those geeks of Yoorkerk's in with the Kragans and\nthey'd be most useful in conquering Konkrook, but the trouble was\nthat, after associating with Kragans, they might develop into\nreasonably good troops themselves, to the undesired improvement of\nKing Yoorkerk's army. On the other hand maybe not. Keep them in\nCompany service long enough, and they might want to forget about\nYoorkerk and stay there.\n\n\"How's the situation over in town?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, it's slowing up, since we began pulling contragravity out,\" she\ntold him, \"but the geeks are breaking up rapidly.... Oh, there was\nsomething funny about that hassle, last evening, when the _Procyon_\ncame in. Two contragravity vehicles, an aircar and an air-lorry, that\nwent out to meet the ship, are unaccounted for.\"\n\n\"You mean two of our vehicles are missing?\"\n\nShe shook her head, frowning in perplexity. \"Well, no. All the\nvehicles that answered that unidentified-aircraft alert returned, but\nthere were these two that went out that we haven't any record of.\nColonel Grinell is investigating, but he can't find out anything....\"\n\n\"Tell him not to waste any more time,\" he said. \"Those two were\nprobably geeks from Konkrook. You know, that's how the von Schlichten\nfamily got out of Germany, in the Year Three--flew a bomber to Spain.\nThe Konkrook war-criminals are getting out before the Army of\nOccupation moves in.\"\n\n\"Well, the posts at the old Kragan castles report some contragravity,\nand parties riding 'saurs, moving west from the city,\" she told him.\n\"There are a lot of refugees on the roads. And combat reports from\nKonkrook agree that resistance is getting weaker every hour.... And\nthe supra-atmosphere observation-craft--they're beginning to call her\nthe _Sky-Spy_--is up a hundred and fifty miles over Keegark. We have\nradar and vision screens and telemetered radiation and other detectors\nhere, tuned to her. They're installing a similar set on the _Northern\nLights_ at the shipyard. By the way, Air-Commodore Hargreaves wants to\nknow if he can take a pair of 155-mm rifles from the Channel Battery\nand mount them on the _Lights_.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course, he can have anything he wants, as long as it isn't\nurgently needed for the bomb project.\"\n\n\"_Sky-Spy_ reports normal contragravity traffic between Keegark and\nthe farming-villages around--aircars, lorries, a few scows--but\nnothing suspicious. No trace of either of the Boer-class ships.\nKankad's people are building receiving sets to install on the\n_Procyon_ and the _Aldebaran_, and another set for Kankad's Town.\nPickering and his people are still working, but they all look pretty\nfrustrated. They have Major Thornton, at the ammunition plant, doing\nexperimental work on chemical-explosive charges to bring the\nsubcritical masses together and hold them together till an explosion\ncan be produced; they're using most of the skilled electrical and\nelectronics people to work up a detonating device. That's why Kankad's\npeople are doing most of the detection-device work. Hargreaves is\nfitting a lot of small craft-- combat-cars and civilian aircars--with\nradar sets, to use for patrolling.\"\n\n\"That sounds good,\" von Schlichten said. \"I'll be around and see how\nthings are, after I've had some breakfast.\"\n\nHe had breakfast at the main cafeteria, four floors down; there wasn't\nas much laughing and talking as usual, but the crowd there seemed in\ngood spirits. He spent some time at headquarters, watching Keegark by\nTV and radar. So far, nothing had been done about direct\nreconnaissance over Keegark with radiation-detectors, but Hargreaves\nreported that a couple of privately owned aircars were being fitted\nfor the job.\n\nHe made a flying inspection trip around the island, and visited the\nfarms south of the city, on the mainland, and, finally, made a sweep\nin the command-car over the city itself. Reconnaissance in person was\nan archaic and unprogressive procedure, and it was a good way to get\ngenerals killed, but one could see a lot of things that would be\nmissed on TV. He let down several times in areas that had already been\ntaken, and talked to company and platoon officers. For one thing, King\nYoorkerk's flamboyantly named regiments weren't quite as bad as Paula\nhad thought. She'd been spoiled by the Kragans in her appreciation of\nother native troops. They had good, standard-quality, Volund-made\narms; they were brave and capable; and they had been just enough\ninsulted by being integrated into Kragan regiments to try to make a\ngood showing.\n\nBy noon, resistance in the city was beginning to cave in. Surrender\nflags were appearing on one after another of the Konkrookan rebel\nstrong-points, and at 1430, after he had returned to the Island, a\ndelegation, headed by the Konkrookan equivalent of Lord Mayor and\ncomposed largely of prominent merchants, came across the channel under\na flag of truce to surrender the city's Spear of State, with abject\napologies for not having Gurgurk's head on the point of it. Gurgurk,\nthey reported, had fled to Keegark by air the night before, which\nexplained the incident of the unaccountable aircar and lorry. The\nChannel Battery stopped firing, and, with the exception of an\noccasional spatter of small-arms fire, the city fell silent.\n\nAt 1600, von Schlichten visited the headquarters Pickering had set up\nin the office building at the power-plant. As he stepped off the lift\non the third floor, a girl, running down the hall with her arms full\nof papers in folders, collided with him; the load of papers flew in\nall directions. He stooped to help her pick them up.\n\n\"Oh, general! Isn't it wonderful?\" she cried. \"I just can't believe\nit!\"\n\n\"Isn't what wonderful?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, don't you know? They've got it!\"\n\n\"Huh? They have?\" He gathered up the last of the big envelopes and\ngave them to her. \"When?\"\n\n\"Just half an hour ago. And to think, those books were around here all\nthe time, and.... Oh, I've got to run!\" She disappeared into the lift.\n\nInside the office, one of Pickering's engineers was sitting on the\nmiddle of his spinal column, a stenograph-phone in one hand and a book\nin the other. Once in a while, he would say something into the\nmouthpiece of the phone. Two other nuclear engineers had similar books\nspread out on a desk in front of them; they were making notes and\nlooking up references in the _Nuclear Engineers' Handbook_, and making\ncalculations with their sliderules. There was a huddle around the\ndrafting-boards, where two more such books were in use.\n\n\"Well, what's happened?\" he demanded, catching Pickering by the arm as\nhe rushed from one group to another.\n\n\"Ha! We have it!\" Pickering cried. \"Everything we need! Look!\"\n\nHe had another of the books under his arm. He held it out to von\nSchlichten, and von Schlichten suddenly felt sicker than he had ever\nfelt since, at the age of fourteen, he had gotten drunk for the first\ntime. He had seen men crack up under intolerable strain before, but\nthis was the first time he had seen a whole roomful of men blow their\ntops in the same manner.\n\nThe book was a novel--a jumbo-size historical novel, of some seven or eight\nhundred pages. Its dust-jacket bore a slightly-more-than-bust-length\npicture of a young lady with crimson hair and green eyes and jade earrings\nand a plunging--not to say power-diving--neckline that left her affiliation\nwith the class of Mammalia in no doubt whatever. In the background, a\nmushroom-topped smoke-column rose, and away from it something intended to\nbe a four-motor propeller-driven bomber of the First Century was racing\nmadly. The title, he saw, was _Dire Dawn_, and the author was one\nHildegarde Hernandez.\n\n\"Well, it has a picture of an A-bomb explosion on it,\" he agreed.\n\n\"It has more than that; it has the whole business. Case\nspecifications, tampers, charge design, detonating device, everything.\nWhy, the end-papers even have diagrams, copies of the original\nNagasaki-bomb drawings. Look.\"\n\nVon Schlichten looked. He had no more than the average intelligent\nlayman's knowledge of nuclear physics--enough to recharge or repair a\nconversion-unit--but the drawings looked authentic enough. They seemed\nto be copies of ancient blueprints, lettered in First Century English,\nwith Lingua Terra translations added, and marked TOP SECRET and U.S.\nARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS and MANHATTAN ENGINEERING DISTRICT.\n\n\"And look at this!\" Pickering opened at a marked page and showed it to\nhim. \"And this!\" He opened where another slip of paper had been\ninserted. \"Everything we want to know, practically.\"\n\n\"I don't get this.\" He wasn't sick, anymore, just bewildered. \"I read\nsome reviews of this thing. All the reviewers panned hell out of\nit--'World War II Through a Bedroom Keyhole'; 'Henty in Black Lace\nPanties'--that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Yeh, yeh, sure,\" Pickering agreed. \"But this Hernandez had illusions\nof being a great serious historical novelist, see. She won't try to\nwrite a book till she's put in years of research--actually, about six\nmonths' research by a herd of librarians and college-juniors and other\nsuch literary coolies--and she boasts that she never yet has been\ncaught in an error of historical background detail.\n\n\"Well, this opus is about the old Manhattan Project. The heroine is a\nsort of super-Mata-Hari, who is, alternately and sometimes\nsimultaneously, in the pay of the Nazis, the Soviets, the Vatican,\nChiang Kai-Shek, the Japanese Emperor, and the Jewish International\nBankers, and she sleeps with everybody but Joe Stalin and Mao\nTse-tung, and of course, she is in on every step of the A-bomb\nproject. She even manages to stow away on the _Enola Gay_, with the\nhelp of a general she's spent fifty incandescent pages seducing.\n\n\"In order to tool up for this production-job, La Hernandez did her\nresearching just where Louren\u00e7o Gomes probably did his--University of\nMontevideo Library. She even had access to the photostats of the old\nU.S. data that General Lanningham brought to South America after the\ndebacle in the United States in A.E. 114. Those end-papers are part of\nthe Lanningham stuff. As far as we've been able to check\nmathematically, everything is strictly authentic and practical. We'll\nhave to run a few more tests on the chemical-explosive charges--we\ndon't have any data on the exact strength of the explosives they used\nthen--and the tampers and detonating device will need to be tested a\nlittle. But in about half an hour, we ought to be able to start\ndrawing plans for the case, and as soon as they're finished, we'll\nrush them to the shipyard foundries for casting.\"\n\nVon Schlichten handed the book back to Pickering, and sighed deeply.\n\"And I thought everybody here had gone off his rocker,\" he said. \"We\nwill erect, on the ruins of Keegark, a hundred-foot statue of Se\u00f1orita\nHildegarde Hernandez.... How did you get onto this?\"\n\nPickering pointed to a young man with dull brick colored hair, who was\npunching out some kind of a problem on a small computing machine.\n\n\"Piet van Reenen, over there, he has a girl-friend whose taste runs to\nthis sort of literary bubble-gum. She told him it was all in a book\nshe'd just read, and showed him. We descended in force on the bookshop\nand grabbed every copy in stock. We are now running a sort of\ngaseous-diffusion process, to separate the nuclear physics from the\npornography. I must say, Hildegarde has her biological data very well\nin hand, too.\"\n\n\"I'll bet she'd have fun writing a novel about these geeks,\" von\nSchlichten said. \"Well, how soon do you think you can have a bomb\nready for us?\"\n\n\"Casting the cases is going to slow us down the most,\" Pickering said.\n\"But, even with that, we ought to have one ready in three days, at the\nmost. By two weeks, we'll be turning them out on an assembly-line.\"\n\n\"I hope we don't need more than one. But you'd better produce at least\nhalf a dozen. And have some practice-bombs made up, out of concrete or\nanything, as long as they're the right weight and airfoil and have\nsome way of releasing smoke. Get them done as soon as you have your\ncase designed. We want to be able to make a couple of practice drops.\"\n\nThere was no use, he thought, of raising hopes which might prove\npremature. He told Paula Quinton, of course, and Themistocles\nM'zangwe, and, by telecast on sealed beam, King Kankad and\nAir-Commodore Hargreaves. Beyond that, there was nothing to do but\nwait, and hope that Hargreaves could keep Orgzild's bombers away from\nGongonk Island and Kankad's Town and that Hildegarde Hernandez had\nbeen playing fair with her public. He visited the city, where a few\npockets of diehard resistance were being liquidated, and where\neverybody who had not been too deeply and publicly involved in the\n_znidd suddabit_ conspiracy was now coming forward and claiming to\nhave been a lifelong friend of the Terrans and the Company. Von\nSchlichten returned to Gongonk Island, debating with himself whether\nto declare a general amnesty or to set up a dozen guillotines in the\ncity and run them around the clock for a week. There were cogent\narguments for and against either procedure.\n\nBy 2100, the last organized resistance had been wiped out, and curfew\nhad been imposed, and peace of a sort restored. There was still the\nthreat from Keegark, but it was looking less ominous now than it had\nthe evening before. Von Schlichten and Paula were having dinner in the\nBroadway Room, confident that there was nothing left to do that they\ncould do anything about, when the extension phone that had been\nplugged in at their table rang.\n\n\"Colonel Quinton here,\" Paula identified herself into it, and listened\nfor a moment. \"There has? When?... Well, where did it come from?... I\nsee. And the direction?... Anything else?\"\n\nApparently there was nothing else. She hung up, and turned to von\nSchlichten.\n\n\"The _Sky-Spy_ just detected a ship lifting out from Keegark, presumed\none of the Boer-class freighters, either the _Jan Smuts_ or the _Oom\nPaul Kruger_. It was first picked up on contragravity at about a\nhundred feet, rising vertically from near the Palace. The supposition\nis the geeks had her camouflaged since the time Commander Prinsloo\nfirst bombarded Keegark with the _Aldebaran_. That was about twenty\nminutes ago; at last report, she's fifty miles north of Keegark,\nheaded up the Hoork River.\"\n\nVon Schlichten started thinking aloud: \"That could be a feint, to draw\nour ships north after her, and leave the approach to Konkrook or\nKankad's open, but that would be presuming that they know about the\n_Sky-Spy_, and I doubt that, though not enough to take chances on.\nThey know we have ground and ship-radar, and they may think they can\nslip down the Konk Valley either undetected or mistaken for one of our\nships from North Uller.\"\n\nHe picked up the phone. \"Get me through on telecast to Air-Commodore\nHargreaves, aboard the _Procyon_,\" he said. \"I'll take it in the\noffice; I'll be up directly.\" He rose. \"Finish your dinner, and have\nthe rest of mine sent up,\" he told Paula.\n\nLeaving the elevator, he rushed into the big headquarters room just as\ncontact was established with the _Procyon_, on station over the\nnorthwestern corner of Takkad Sea, between Kankad's Town and Keegark.\nThe _Aldebaran_, he knew, was west of Keegark; the _Northern Lights_,\nnow fitted with a pair of 155-mm guns, in addition to her 90's, had\njust arrived at Kankad's. He had the _Aldebaran_ sent north along the\ncrest of the mountain-range between the Hoork and Konk river-valleys,\nwhere she could cover both with her own radar and other\ndetection-devices and exchange information with the _Sky-Spy_, and the\n_Gaucho_ sent in what looked like the right course to intercept the\nBoer-class freighter from Keegark. The _Northern Lights_, also with\nscreens tuned to the _Sky-Spy_, was sent to take over the\n_Aldebaran's_ regular station. Finally, he called Skilk and had the\n_Northern Star_ sent south down the Hoork Valley.\n\nAfter that, there was nothing to do but wait, and watch the screens.\nPaula Quinton put in an appearance shortly after he had finished\ncalling Skilk, pushing a cocktail-wagon on which their interrupted\ndinners had been placed. They finished eating, and drank coffee, and\nsmoked. Most of the rest of his staff who were not busy on the\nbomb-project or at the shipyards or with the occupation of Konkrook\ndrifted in; they all sat and stared from one to another of the\nscreens, which told, in radar-patterns and direct vision and\ntelescopic vision and heat and radiation detection, the story of what\nwas going on to the northeast of them.\n\nKeegark was dark, on the vision-screen; evidently King Orgzild had invented\nthe blackout, too. Not that it did him any good; the radar-screen showed\nthe city clearly, and it was just as clear on the radiation and\nheat-screens. The Keegarkan ship was completely blacked out, but the\nradiations from her engines and the distinctive radiation-pattern of her\ncontragravity-field showed clearly, and there was a speck that marked her\nposition on the radar-screen. The same position was marked with a pin-point\nof light on the vision-screen--some device on the _Sky-Spy_, synchronized\nwith the detectors, kept it focused there. The Company ships and\ncontragravity vehicles all were carrying topside lights, visible only from\nabove, which flashed alternate red and blue to identify them.\n\nTime crawled slowly around the clock-face on the wall, the\nsixty-five-second minutes of Uller dragging like hours. The spots that\nmarked the enemy ship and her hunters crawled, too; seen from the\nhundred-and-fifty-mile altitude of the _Sky-Spy_, even the\nsix-hundred-mile speed of the _Gaucho_ was barely visible. They drank\ncoffee till the stuff revolted them; they smoked until their throats\nand mouths were dry, they watched the screens until they thought that\nthey would see them in their dreams forever. Then the _Gaucho_\nreported radar-contact with the Keegarkan ship, which had begun to\nturn in a hairpin-shaped course and was coming south down the Konk\nValley.\n\nAfter that, the _Gaucho_ began reporting directly, and her topside\nidentification-light went out.\n\n\"... doused our lights; we're down in the valley, altitude about a\nthousand feet. We're trying to get a glimpse of her against the sky,\"\na voice came in. \"We're cutting in our forward TV-pickup.\" The voice\nrepeated, several times, the wavelength, and somebody got an auxiliary\nscreen tuned in. There was nothing visible on it but the darkness of\nthe valley, the star-jeweled sky, and the loom of the East Konk\nMountains. \"We still can't see her, but we ought to, any moment; radar\nshows her well above the mountains. Ah, there she is; she just\nobscured Beta Hydrae V; she's moving toward that big constellation to\nthe east of it, the one they call Finnegan's Goat. Now she'll be right\nin the center of the screen; we're going straight for her. We're going\nto try to slow her down till the _Aldebaran_ can get here....\"\n\nThe enemy ship was vaguely visible, now, becoming clearer in the\nstarlight. She was a Boer-class freighter, all right. Probably the\n_Jan Smuts_; the _Oom Paul Kruger_ had last been reported at Bwork,\nand there was little chance that she had slipped into Keegark since\nthe uprising had started. For all anybody knew, she could have been\ndestroyed in the fighting before the Bwork Residency fell.\n\n\"All right, we have her spotted; we're going to open up on her,\" the\nvoice from the _Gaucho_ announced. \"She has two 90's to our one; we'll\ntry to disable them, first.\" The vision-screen lit with the indirect\nglare of the gun-flash, and the image in it jiggled violently as the\nship shook to the recoil, then steadied again, with the enemy ship\nvisible in the middle of it, growing larger and larger as the _Gaucho_\nrushed toward her. The gun fired again and again, flooding the screen\nwith momentary yellow light and disturbing the image as the recoil\nshook the gun-cutter. The enemy ship began firing in reply, the shots\nwere all wide misses. Apparently the geek guncrew didn't know how to\nsynchronize the radar sights, and were ignorant of the correct setting\nfor the proximity-fuses. The _Gaucho_'s searchlights came on, bathing\nher quarry in light. It was the _Jan Smuts_; the name and the\nfigurehead-bust of the old soldier-philosopher were plainly visible.\nHer forward gun had been knocked out, and she was trying to swing\nabout to get a field of fire for her stern-gun.\n\n\"We're going to give her a rocket-salvo,\" the voice said. \"Watch this,\nnow!\"\n\nThe rockets leaped forward, from the topside racks, four and four and\nfour and four, at half-second intervals. The first four hit the\n_Smuts_ amidships and low, exploding with a flare that grew before it\ncould die away as the second four landed. Nobody ever saw the third\nand fourth four land. The _Jan Smuts_ vanished in a blaze of light\nthat blinded everybody in the room; when they could see again, after\nsome thirty seconds, the screen was dark.\n\nIn the direct-vision screen from the _Sky-Spy_, the whole countryside\nof the Konk Valley, five hundred miles north of Konkrook, was lighted.\nThe heat and radiation detectors were going insane. And in the\nshifting confusion on the radar-screen, there was no trace either of\nthe _Jan Smuts_ or the _Gaucho_.\n\n\"Well, the geeks did have an A-bomb,\" Themistocles M'zangwe said, at\nlength. \"I'd been trying to kid myself that we were just preparing\nagainst a million-to-one chance. I wonder how many more they have.\"\n\n\"Paula, find out who was in command of the _Gaucho_; he'd be a\njunior-grade lieutenant. Fix up orders promoting him to navy captain,\nas of now. It's probably the only thing we can do for him, anymore.\nAnd promotions of the same order for everybody else aboard that\ncutter. Authority Carlos von Schlichten, acting Governor-General.\" He\npicked up a phone. \"Get me Commander Prinsloo, on _Aldebaran_....\"\n\nHe ordered Prinsloo to launch airboats and make a search; cautioned\nhim to be careful of radiation, but to take no chances on any of the\n_Gaucho_'s complement being still alive and in need of help. While\nthat was going on, the _Sky-Spy_ reported another ship coming over her\nhorizon to the east, from the direction of Bwork. That would be the\n_Oom Paul Kruger_. Hargreaves had already learned of the advent of the\nsecond freighter. He was unwilling to take the _Procyon_ off her\nstation until the _Aldebaran_ returned from the Konk Valley. In this,\nvon Schlichten concurred.\n\nSomebody suggested that a drink would be in order. They had just\nwatched the all-but-certain death of three Terran officers, fifteen\nTerran airmen, and ten Kragans, but they had all been living in too\nclose companionship with death in the past three days--or was it three\ncenturies--to be too deeply affected. And they had also watched, at\nleast for a day or so, the removal of the threat that had hung over\ntheir heads. And they had seen proof that they had a defense against\nKing Orgzild's bombs.\n\nThey were still mixing cocktails when Pickering phoned in.\n\n\"Some good news, general, from Operation 'Hildegarde.' We ought to\nhave at least one bomb ready to drop by 1500 tomorrow, four or five\nmore by next midnight,\" he said. \"We don't need to have cases cast. We\ngot our dimensions decided, and we find that there are a lot of big\nempty liquid-oxygen flasks, or tanks, rather, at the spaceport,\nthat'll accommodate everything--fissionables, explosive-charges,\ntampers, detonator, and all.\"\n\n\"Well, go ahead with it. Make up a few of them; as many as you can\nbetween now and 2400 Sunday.\" He thought for a moment. \"Don't waste\ntime on those practice bombs I mentioned. We'll make a practice drop\nwith a live bomb. And don't throw away the design for the cast case.\nWe may need that, later on.\"\n\n\n\n\nXV.\n\nA Place in my Heart for Hildegarde\n\n\nThe company fleet hung off Keegark, at fifteen thousand feet, in a\nbelt of calm air just below the seesawing currents from the warming\nAntarctic and the cooling deserts of the Arctic. There was the\n_Procyon_, from the bridge of which von Schlichten watched the\nmovements of the other ships and airboats and the distant horizon. The\n_Aldebaran_ was ten miles off, to the west, her metal sheathing\nglinting in the red light of the evening sun. There was the _Northern\nStar_, down from Skilk, a smaller and more distant twinkle of\nreflected light to the north of _Aldebaran_. The _Northern Lights_ was\noff to the east, and between her and _Procyon_ was a fifth ship;\nturning the arm-mounted binoculars around, he could just make out, on\nher bow, the figurehead bust of a man in an ancient tophat and a\nfringe of chin-beard. She was the _Oom Paul Kruger_, captured by the\n_Procyon_ after a chase across the mountains northeast of Keegark the\nday before. And, remote from the other ships, to the south, a tiny\nspeck of blue-gray, almost invisible against the sky, and a smaller\ntwinkle of reflected sunlight--a garbage-scow, unflatteringly but\nsomewhat aptly rechristened _Hildegarde Hernandez_, which had been\naltered as a bomb-carrier, and the gun-cutter _Elmoran_. With the\nglasses, he could see a bulky cylinder being handled off the scow and\nloaded onto the improvised bomb-catapult on the _Elmoran_'s stern.\nShortly thereafter, the gun-cutter broke loose from the tender and\nbegan to approach the fleet.\n\n\"General, I must protest against your doing this,\" Air-Commodore\nHargreaves said. \"There's simply no sense in it. That bomb can be\ndropped without your personal supervision aboard, sir, and you're\nendangering yourself unnecessarily. That infernal machine hasn't been\ntested or anything; it might even let go on the catapult when you try\nto drop it. And we simply can't afford to lose you, now.\"\n\n\"No, what would become of us, if you go out there and blow yourself up\nwith that contraption?\" Buhrmann supported him. \"My God, I thought Don\nQuixote was a Spaniard, instead of a German!\"\n\n\"Argentino,\" von Schlichten corrected. \"And don't try to sell me that\nIrreplaceable Man line, either. Them M'zangwe can replace me, Hid\nO'Leary can replace him, Barney Mordkovitz can replace him, and so on\ndown to where you make a second lieutenant out of some sergeant. We've\nbeen all over this last evening. Admitted we can't take time for a\nlong string of test-shots, and admitted we have to use an untested\nweapon; I'm not sending men out under those circumstances and staying\nhere on this ship and watch them blow themselves up. If that bomb's\nour only hope, it's got to be dropped right, and I'm not going to take\na chance on having it dropped by a crew who think they've been sent\nout on a suicide mission. What happened to the _Gaucho_ when she blew\nthe _Smuts_ up is too fresh in everybody's mind. But if I, who ordered\nthe mission, accompany it, they'll know I have some confidence that\nthey'll come back alive.\"\n\n\"Well I'm coming along, too, general,\" Kent Pickering spoke up. \"I\nmade the damned thing, and I ought to be along when it's dropped, on\nthe principle that a restaurant-proprietor ought to be seen eating his\nown food once in a while.\"\n\n\"I still don't see why we couldn't have made at least one test shot,\nfirst,\" Hans Meyerstein, the Banking Cartel man, objected.\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you why,\" Paula Quinton spoke up. \"There's a good\nchance that the geeks don't know we have a bomb of our own. They may\nbelieve that it was something invented on Niflheim for mining\npurposes, and that we haven't realized its military application.\nThere's more than a good chance that the loss of the _Jan Smuts_ has\ntemporarily demoralized them. Personally, I believe that both King\nOrgzild and Prince Gorkrink were aboard her when she blew up. That's\nsomething we'll never know, positively, of course. That ship and\neverything and everybody in her were simply vaporized, and the\nparticles are registering on our geigers now. But I'm as sure as I am\nof anything about these geeks that one or both of them accompanied\nher.\"\n\n\"Paula knows what she's talking about,\" King Kankad jabbered in the\nTakkad Sea language which they all understood. \"Just like Von saying\nthat he has to go on our cutter, to encourage the crew. They always\ninsist that their kings and generals go into battle, particularly if\nsomething important is to be done. They think the gods get angry if\nthey don't.\"\n\n\"And we have to hit them now,\" von Schlichten said. \"They still have a\ncouple of bombs left. We haven't been able to locate them with\ndetectors, but those geeks Kankad's men caught on that commando-raid,\nlast night, say that there were at least three of them made. We can't\ntake a chance that some fanatic may load one into an aircar and make\na kamikaze-raid on Gongonk Island.\"\n\nThe _Elmoran_ ran alongside, with her Masai-warrior figurehead and the\nblack cylinder on her catapult aft. Somebody had painted, on the bomb:\nDIRE DAWN _by Hildegarde Hernandez. Compliments of the author to H.M.\nKing Orgzild of Keegark._ A canvas-entubed gangway was run out to\nconnect the ship with the cutter. Von Schlichten and Kent Pickering\nwent down the ladder from the bridge, the others accompanying them. As\nhe stepped into the gangway, Paula Quinton fell in behind him.\n\n\"Where do you think you're going?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Along with you,\" she replied. \"I'm your adjutant, I believe.\"\n\n\"You definitely are not going along. Personally, I don't believe\nthere's any danger, but I'm not having you run any unnecessary\nrisks....\"\n\n\"Von, I don't know much about the way Terrans think, except about\nfighting and about making things,\" Kankad told him. \"And I don't know\nanything at all about the kind of Terrans who have young. But I\nbelieve this is something important to Paula. Let her go with you,\nbecause if you go alone and don't come back, I don't think she will\never be happy again.\"\n\nHe looked at Kankad curiously, wondering, as he had so often before,\njust what went on inside that lizard-skull. Then he looked at Paula,\nand, after a moment, he nodded.\n\n\"All right, colonel, objection withdrawn,\" he said.\n\nAboard the _Elmoran_, they gave the bomb a last-minute inspection and\nchecked the catapult and the bomb-sight, and then went up on the\nbridge.\n\n\"Ready for the bombing mission, sir?\" the skipper, a Lieutenant\n(j.g.) Morrison, asked.\n\n\"Ready if you are, lieutenant. Carry on; we're just passengers.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir. We'd thought of going in over the city at about five\nthousand for a target-check, turning when we're half-way back to the\nmountains, and coming back for our bombing-run at fifteen thousand. Is\nthat all right, sir?\"\n\nVon Schlichten nodded. \"You're the skipper, lieutenant. You'd better\nmake sure, though, that as soon as the bomb-off signal is flashed,\nyour engineer hits his auxiliary rocket-propulsion button. We want to\nbe about fifteen miles from where that thing goes off.\"\n\nThe lieutenant (j.g.) muttered something that sounded unmilitarily\nlike, \"You ain't foolin', brother!\"\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" von Schlichten agreed. \"I saw the _Jan Smuts_ on the\nTV-screen.\"\n\nThe _Elmoran_ pointed her bow, and the long blade of the figurehead\nwarrior's spear, toward Keegark. The city grew out of the ground-mist,\na particolored blur at the delta of the dry Hoork River, and then a\ncolor-splashed triangle between the river and the bay and the hills on\nthe landward side, and then it took shape, cross-ruled with streets\nand granulated with buildings. As they came in, von Schlichten, who\nhad approached it from the air many times before, could distinguish\nthe landmarks--the site of King Orgzild's nitroglycerin plant, now a\ncrater surrounded by a quarter-mile radius of ruins; the Residency,\nanother crater since Rodolfo MacKinnon had blown it up under him; the\nsmashed _Christiaan De Wett_ at the Company docks; King Orgzild's\nPalace, fire-stained and with a hole blown in one corner by the\n_Aldebaran_'s bombs.... Then they were past the city and over open\ncountry.\n\n\"I wish we had some idea where the rest of those bombs are stored,\nsir,\" Lieutenant Morrison said. \"We don't seem to have gotten anything\nsignificant when we flew reconnaissance with the radiation detectors.\"\n\n\"No, about all that was picked up was the main power-plant, and the\nradiation-escape from there was normal,\" Pickering agreed. \"The bombs\nthemselves wouldn't be detectable, except to the extent that, say, a\nnuclear-conversion engine for an airboat would be. They probably have\nthem underground, somewhere, well shielded.\"\n\n\"Those prisoners Kankad's commandos dragged in only knew that they\nwere in the city somewhere,\" von Schlichten considered. \"How about\nmidway between the Palace and the Residency for our ground-zero,\nlieutenant? That looks like the center of the city.\"\n\nThe cutter turned and started back, having risen another ten thousand\nfeet. Morrison passed the word to the bombardier. The city, with the\nsea beyond it now, came rushing at them, and von Schlichten, standing\nat the front of the bridge, discovered that he had his arm around\nPaula's waist and was holding her a little more closely than was\nmilitary. He made no attempt to release her, however.\n\n\"There's nothing to worry about, really,\" he was assuring her.\n\"Pickering's boys built this thing according to the best principles of\nengineering, and the stuff they got out of that big-economy-size\nshilling-shocker all checked mathematically....\"\n\nThe red light on the bridge flashed, and the intercom shouted, \"_Bomb\noff!_\" He forced Paula down on the bridge deck and crouched beside\nher.\n\n\"Cover your eyes,\" he warned. \"You remember what the flash was like in\nthe screen when the _Jan Smuts_ blew up. And we didn't get the worst\nof it; the pickup on the _Gaucho_ was knocked out too soon.\"\n\nHe kept on lecturing her about gamma-rays and ultra-violet rays and\nX-rays and cosmic rays, trying to keep making some sort of intelligent\nsounds while they clung together and waited, and, with the other half\nof his mind, trying not to think of everything that could go wrong\nwith that jerry-built improvisation they had just dumped onto Keegark.\nIf it didn't blow, and the geeks found it, they'd know that another\none would be along shortly, and....\n\nAn invisible hand caught the gun-cutter and hurled her end-over-end,\nsending von Schlichten and Paula sprawling at full length on the deck,\nstill clinging to one another. There was a blast of almost palpable\nsound, and a sensation of heat that penetrated even the airtight\nsuperstructure of the _Elmoran_. An instant later, there was another,\nand another, similar shock. Two more bombs had gone off behind them,\nin Keegark; that meant that they had found King Orgzild's remaining\nnuclear armament. There were shattering sounds of breaking glass, and\nheavy thumps that told of structural damage to the cutter, and hoarse\nshouts, and lurid cursing as Morrison and his airmen struggled with\nthe controls. The cutter began losing altitude, but she was back on a\nreasonably even keel. Von Schlichten rose, helping Paula to her feet,\nand found that they had been kissing one another passionately. They\nwere still in each other's arms when the pitching and rolling of the\ncutter ceased and somebody tapped him on the shoulder.\n\nHe came out of the embrace and looked around. It was Lieutenant (j.g.)\nMorrison.\n\n\"What the devil, lieutenant?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Sorry to interrupt, sir, but we're starting back to _Procyon_. And\nhere, you'll want this, I suppose.\" He held out a glass disc. \"I\nnever expected to see it, but at that it took three A-bombs to blow\nyou loose from your monocle.\"\n\n\"Oh, that?\" Von Schlichten took his trademark and set it in his eye.\n\"I didn't lose it,\" he lied. \"I just jettisoned it. Don't you know,\nlieutenant, that no gentleman ever wears a monocle while he's kissing\na lady?\"\n\nHe looked around. They were at about eight hundred to a thousand feet\nabove the water, with a stiff following wind away from the explosion\narea. The 90-mm gun, forward, must have been knocked loose and carried\naway; it was gone, and so was the TV-pickup and the radar. Something,\nprobably the gun, had slammed against the front of the bridge--the\nmetal skeleton was bent in, and the armor-glass had been knocked out.\nThe cutter was vibrating properly, so the contragravity-field had not\nbeen disturbed, and her jets were firing.\n\n\"It was the second and third bombs that did the damage, sir,\" Morrison\nwas saying. \"We'd have gone through the effects of our own bomb with\nnothing more than a bad shaking--of course, on contragravity, we're\nweightless relative to the air-mass, but she was built to stand the\nwinds in the high latitudes. But the two geek bombs caught us off\nbalance....\"\n\n\"You don't need to apologize, lieutenant. You and your crew behaved\nsplendidly, lieutenant-commander, best traditions, and all that sort\nof thing. It was a pleasure, commander, hope to be aboard with you\nagain, captain.\"\n\nThey found Kent Pickering at the rear of the bridge, and joined him\nlooking astern. Even von Schlichten, who had seen H-bombs and\nBethe-cycle bombs, was impressed. Keegark was completely obliterated\nunder an outward-rolling cloud of smoke and dust that spread out for\nfive miles at the bottom of the towering column.\n\nThere had been a hundred and fifty thousand people in that city, even\nif their faces were the faces of lizards and they had four arms and\nquartz-speckled skins. What fraction of them were now alive, he could\nnot guess. He had to remind himself that they were the people who had\nburned Eric Blount and Hendrik Lemoyne alive; that two of the three\nbombs that had contributed to that column of boiling smoke had been\nmade in Keegark, by Keegarkans, and that, with a few causal factors\naltered, he was seeing what would have happened to Konkrook. Perhaps\nevery Terran felt a superstitious dread of nuclear energy turned to\nthe purposes of war; small wonder, after what they had done on their\nown world.\n\nFor one thing, he thought grimly, the next geek who picks up the idea\nof soaking a Terran in thermoconcentrate and setting fire to him will\ndrop it again like a hot potato. And the next geek potentate who tries\nto organize an anti-Terran conspiracy, or the next crazy\ncaravan-driver who preached _znidd suddabit_, will be lynched on the\nspot. But this must be the last nuclear bomb used on Uller....\n\nDrunkard's morning-after resolution! he told himself contemptuously.\nThe next time, it will come easier, and easier still the time after\nthat. After you drop the first bomb, there is no turning back, any\nmore than there had been after Hiroshima, four-hundred-and-fifty-odd\nyears ago. Why, he had even been considering just where, against the\nmountains back of Bwork, he would drop a demonstration bomb as a\nprelude to a surrender demand.\n\nYou either went on to the inevitable catastrophe, or you realized, in\ntime, that nuclear armament and nationalism cannot exist together on\nthe same planet, and it is easier to banish a habit of thought than a\npiece of knowledge. Uller was not ready for membership in the Terran\nFederation; then its people must bow to the Terran Pax. The Kragans\nwould help--as proconsuls, administrators, now, instead of\nmercenaries. And there must be manned orbital stations, and the\nResidencies must be moved outside the cities, away from possible\nblast-areas. And Sid Harrington's idea of encouraging the natives to\nown their own contragravity-ships must be shelved, for a long time to\ncome. Maybe, in a century or so....\n\nKankad had a good idea, at that, a most meritorious idea. He was sold\non it, already, and he doubted if it would take much salesmanship with\nPaula, either. Already, she was clinging to his arm with obvious\npossessiveness. Maybe their grandchildren, and the Kankad of that\ntime, would see Uller a civilized member of the Federation....\n\nThey paused, as the gun-cutter nuzzled up to the _Procyon_ and the\ncanvas-entubed gangway was run out and made fast, looking back at the\nfearful thing that had sprouted from where Keegark had been.\n\n\"You know,\" Paula was saying, echoing his earlier thought, \"but for\nthat female pornographer, that would have been Konkrook.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Yes. I hope you won't mind, but there will always be a\nplace in my heart for Hildegarde.\"\n\nThen they turned their backs upon the abomination of Keegark's\ndesolation and went up the gangway together, looking very little like\na general and his adjutant.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     With a broadsword in his hand, von Schlichten fought his way\n     toward the throne. There Firkked waited, a sword in one of\n     his upper hands, his Spear of State in the other, and a\n     dagger in each lower hand. Von Schlichten fought on, trying\n     not to think of the absurdity of a man of the Sixth Century\n     A.E., the representative of a civilized Chartered Company,\n     dueling to the death with a barbarian king for a throne he\n     had promised to another barbarian ... or of what could\n     happen on Uller if he allowed this four-armed monstrosity to\n     kill him!\n\n\n_Ace Science Fiction Books by H.

Then, overnight, war is\neverywhere.\n\nHow it will end is in the (merely) two Terran hands of the new\ngovernor-general, a man shrewd enough to know that \"it is easier to\nbanish a habit of thought than a piece of knowledge.\" The problem is,\nthe particular piece of knowledge he needs hasn't been used in 450\nyears....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Uller Uprising, by\nHenry Beam Piper, John D.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
