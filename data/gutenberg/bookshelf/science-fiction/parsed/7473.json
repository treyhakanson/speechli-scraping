BACK TO EARTH--CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nA WONDERFUL STORY\n\n\n\"Well, what do you think of it, Mark?\" asked Jack Darrow, as he laid\naside a portion of a newspaper, covered with strange printed\ncharacters. \"Great; isn't it?\"\n\n\"You don't mean to tell me that you believe that preposterous story, do\nyou, Jack?\" And Mark Sampson looked across the table at his companion\nin some astonishment.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know; it may be true,\" went on Jack, again picking up the\npaper and gazing thoughtfully at it. \"I wish it was.\"\n\n\"But think of it!\" exclaimed Mark. \"Why, if such a thing exists, and if\nwe, or some one else, should attempt to bring all those precious stones\nto this earth, it would revolutionize the diamond industry of the\nworld. It can't be true!\"\n\n\"Well, here It is, in plain print. You can read it for yourself, as you\nknow the Martian language as well as I do. It states that a large field\nof 'Reonaris' was discovered on the moon near Mare Tranquilitatis (or\nTranquil Ocean, I suppose that could be translated), and that the men\nof Mars brought back some of the Reonaris with them. Here, read it, if\nyou don't believe me.\"\n\n\"Oh, I believe you, all right--that is, I think you have translated\nthat article as well as you can. But suppose you have made some error?\nWe didn't have much time to study the language of Mars while we were\nthere, and we might make some mistake in the words. That article might\nbe an account of a dog-fight on the red planet, instead of an account\nof a trip to the moon and the discovery of a field of Reonaris; eh,\nJack?\"\n\n\"Of course, I'm likely to have made an error, for it isn't easy to\ntranslate this stuff.\" And Jack gazed intently at the strangely printed\npage, which was covered with characters not unlike Greek. \"I may be\nwrong,\" went on the lad, \"but you must remember that I translated some\nother articles in this paper, and Professor Henderson also translated\nthem substantially as I did, and Professor Roumann agreed with him.\nThere _is_ Reonaris on the moon, and I wish we could go there and get\nsome.\"\n\n\"But maybe after you got the Reonaris it would turn out to be only\ncommon crystals,\" objected Mark.\n\n\"No!\" exclaimed Jack. \"Reonaris is what the Martians call it in their\nlanguage, and that means diamonds. I'm sure of it!\"\n\n\"Well, I don't agree with you,\" declared the other lad.\n\n\"Don't be cranky and contrary,\" begged Jack.\n\n\"I'm not; but what's the use of believing anything so wild and weird as\nthat? It's a crazy yarn!\"\n\n\"It's nothing of the sort! There are diamonds on the moon; and I can\nprove it!\"\n\n\"Well, don't get excited,\" suggested Mark calmly. \"I don't believe it;\nthat's all. You're mistaken about what Reonaris is; that's what you\nare.\"\n\n\"I am not!\" Jack had arisen from his chair, and seemed much elated. In\nhis hand he held clinched the paper which had caused the lively\ndiscussion. It was as near to a disagreement as Jack Darrow and Mark\nSampson had come in some time.\n\n\"Sit down,\" begged Mark.\n\n\"I'll not!\" retorted Jack. \"I'm going to prove to you that I'm right.\"\n\n\"How are you going to do it?\"\n\n\"I'm going to get Professor Henderson and Professor Roumann to\ntranslate this article for you, and then you can ask them what Reonaris\nis. Guess that'll convince you; won't it?\"\n\n\"Maybe; but why don't you ask Andy Sudds or Washington White to give\ntheir opinion?\"\n\n\"Don't get funny,\" advised the other lad sharply, and then, seeing that\nhis chum was smiling, Jack laughed, cooled down a bit, looked at the\npaper which he had crumpled in his hand, and said:\n\n\"I guess I _was_ getting a little too excited. But I'm sure I'm right.\nHere's the paper I brought from Mars to prove it, and the only thing\nthere's any doubt about is whether or not Reonaris means diamonds. I'll\nask----\"\n\nAt that moment the door of the library, in which Jack and Mark were\nseated, was cautiously opened, and a black, woolly head was thrust in.\nThen two widely-opened eyes gazed at the boys.\n\n\"What's the matter, Washington?\" asked Jack, with a laugh.\n\n\"'Scuse me, Massa Jack,\" answered the colored man, \"but did I done heah\nyou' to promulgate some conversationess regarding de\ntransmigatorability ob diamonds?\"\n\n\"Do you mean, were we talking about diamonds?\" inquired Mark.\n\n\"Dat's what I done said, Massa Mark.\"\n\n\"No, you _didn't_ say it, but you meant it, I guess,\" went on Jack.\n\"Yes, we _were_ talking about diamonds, Washington. I know a place\nthat's full of them.\"\n\n\"Where?\" inquired the colored man, thrusting his head farther into the\nroom, and opening his eyes to their fullest extent. \"Ef it ain't\nviolatin' no confidences, Massa Jack, would yo' jest kindly mention it\nto yo's truly,\" and Professor Henderson's faithful servant, who had\nfollowed him into many dangers, looked at the two boys, who, of late\nyears, had shared the labors of the well-known scientist. \"Where am\ndose diamonds, Massa Jack?\"\n\n\"On the moon,\" was the answer.\n\n\"On de moon? Ha! Ha! Dat's a joke!\" And Washington began to laugh. \"On\nde moon! Ha! Ho!\"\n\n\"Well, you can read it for yourself,\" went on the lad, tossing the\npaper over to the colored man. The latter picked it up, gazed at it,\nfirst from one side, and then from the other. Next he turned it upside\ndown, but, as this did not make the article any clearer, he turned the\npaper back again. Then he remarked, with a puzzled air:\n\n\"Well, I neber could read without mah glasses, Massa Jack, so I guess\nI'll hab t' let it go until annoder time. Diamonds on de moon, eh?\nDat's wonderful! I wonder what dey'll be doin' next? But I'se got t'\ngo. Diamonds on de moon, eh? Diamonds on de moon!\"\n\nAs Washington turned to leave the room, for he had entered it when Jack\nand Mark were talking to aim, the latter lad asked:\n\n\"Did you want to see us about anything particular, Wash?\"\n\n\"Why, I suah did,\" was the reply, \"I did come t' tell yo' dat Perfesser\nHenderson would be pleased to hold some conversations wid yo', but when\nMassa Jack done mentioned about dem diamonds, I clean fo'got it.\nDiamonds on de moon, eh?\"\n\n\"Well, if the professor wants us we'd better go,\" suggested Mark. \"Come\non, Jack, and stop dreaming about Reonaris and the moonbeams. Get back\nto earth.\"\n\n\"All right; laugh if you want to,\" said Jack sturdily, \"but the time\nwill come, Mark, when you'll find out that I'm right.\"\n\n\"How?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"I don't know, but I'm sure I can prove what I say.\"\n\nThe two boys were to have the wonderful diamond story demonstrated to\nthem sooner than either expected. Following the colored man, the lads,\nJack carrying the paper, made their way to the laboratory of Professor\nHenderson. His door was open, and the aged man, whose hair and beard\nwere now white with age, was bending over a table covered with papers,\nchemical apparatus, test tubes, alembecs, Bunsen burners, globes, and\nvarious pieces of apparatus. Another man, not quite so old as was Mr.\nHenderson, was on the point of leaving the apartment.\n\n\"Ah, boys,\" remarked the older professor, as he caught sight of them,\n\"I hope I didn't disturb you by sending for you.\"\n\n\"No; Jack and I were only having a red-hot discussion about diamonds on\nthe moon,\" said Mark, with a laugh.\n\n\"Diamonds on the moon!\" exclaimed Professor Henderson.\n\n\"Diamonds on the moon?\" repeated his friend, Prof. Santell Roumann. \"Is\nthis a joke, boys?\"\n\n\"Mark thinks so, but I don't!\" cried Jack, enthusiastically. \"Look\nhere, Professor Henderson, and also Mr. Roumann. Here is one of the\nnewspapers that we brought back with us in our projectile, the\n_Annihilator_, after our trip to Mars. I have been translating some of\nthe articles in it, and to-night I came across one that told of a trip\nmade by some of the inhabitants of Mars to the moon, in a sort of\nprojectile, like ours, only more on the design of an aeroplane.\n\n\"They landed on the moon, the article states, and found a big field, or\ndeposit, of Reonaris, which I claim are diamonds. Mark says I'm wrong,\nbut, Professor Henderson, isn't Reonaris to the Martians what diamonds\nare to us?\"\n\n\"It certainly is,\" agreed the older scientist, and he looked for\nconfirmation to his scholarly companion.\n\n\"Reonaris is substantially a diamond,\" said Professor Roumann. \"It has\nthe same chemical constitution, and also the diamond's hardness and\nbrilliancy. But I don't understand how any diamonds can be on the moon.\"\n\n\"You can read this for yourself,\" suggested Jack, passing over the\npaper, which was one of some souvenirs brought back from what was the\nlongest journey on record, ever taken by human beings.\n\nMr. Roumann adjusted his glasses, and carefully read the article that\nwas printed in such strange characters. As he perused it, he nodded his\nhead thoughtfully from time to time. Then he passed the paper to\nProfessor Henderson.\n\nThe older scientist was somewhat longer in going over the article, but\nwhen he had finished, he looked at the two boys, and said: \"Jack is\nright! This is an account of a trip made to the moon by some of the\nMartians, who have advanced much further in the art of air navigation\nthan have we. Some of the words I am not altogether familiar with, but\nin the main, that is what the paper states.\"\n\n\"And doesn't it tell about them finding a field of Reonaris?\" asked\nJack eagerly, for he was anxious to prove to his chum that he was right.\n\n\"Yes, it does,\" replied Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"And Reonaris is diamonds, isn't it?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"It is,\" answered Professor Roumann gravely.\n\n\"Then,\" cried Jack, \"what's to hinder us from going to the moon, and\ngetting some of those diamonds? The Martians must have left some! Let's\ngo to the moon and get them! We can do it in the projectile with which\nwe made the journey to Mars. Let's start for the moon!\"\n\nFor a moment there was silence in the laboratory of the scientist. It\nwas broken by Washington White, who remarked:\n\n\"Good land a' massy! Annodder ob dem trips through de air! Well, I\nain't goin' to no moon--no sah!! Ef I went dere, I'd suah get looney,\nan' I has troubles enough now wid'out dat, I suah has!\" And, shaking\nhis head dubiously, the colored man shuffled from the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nSOMETHING ABOUT OUR HEROES\n\n\n\"Are you in earnest in proposing this trip?\" asked Professor Henderson\nof Jack. The lad, with flushed face and bright eyes, stood in the\ncentre of the apartment, holding the paper which the aged scientist had\nreturned to him.\n\n\"I certainly am,\" was the reply. \"It ought not to be a difficult\nundertaking, after our trip to the North Pole through the air, the one\nto the South Pole under water, our journey to the centre of the earth,\nand our flight to Mars. Why, a trip to the moon ought to be a little\npleasure jaunt, like an automobile tour. Can't we go, Professor?\"\n\n\"From the standpoint of possibility, I presume we could make a trip to\nthe moon,\" the scientist admitted. \"It would not take so long, nor\nwould it be as dangerous, as was our trip to Mars. And yet, I don't\nknow that I care to go. I am getting along in years, and I have money\nenough to live on. Even a field of diamonds hardly sounds attractive to\nme.\" Jack's face showed the disappointment he felt.\n\n\"And yet,\" went on the aged scientist with a smile, \"there are certain\nattractions about another trip through space. I had hoped to settle\ndown in life now, and devote my time to scientific study and the\nwriting of books. But this is something new. We never have been to the\nmoon, and----\"\n\n\"There are lots of problems about it that are still unsolved!\" cried\nJack eagerly. \"You will be able to discover if the moon has an\natmosphere and moisture; and also what the other side--the one that is\nalways turned away from us--looks like.\"\n\n\"It does sound tempting,\" went on the aged scientist slowly. \"And we\ncould do it in our projectile, the _Annihilator_. It is in good working\norder; isn't it, Professor Roumann?\"\n\n\"Couldn't be better. If you ask me, I, for one, would like to make a\ntrip to the moon. It would give me a better chance to test the powers\nof Cardite, that wonderful red substance we brought from Mars. I can\nuse that in the Etherium motor. If you left it to me, I'd say, 'go to\nthe moon.'\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps we will,\" spoke Mr. Henderson thoughtfully.\n\n\"You'll go, too, won't you, Mark?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Oh, I'm not going to be left behind. I'll go if the rest do, but I\ndon't believe you'll find any diamonds on the moon. If there ever were\nany, the Martians took them.\" For Mark had been partly convinced after\nthe confirmation by the two professors of Jack's translation.\n\n\"I'll take a chance on the sparklers,\" said his chum. \"But now, let's\ngo into details, and figure out when we can start. It ought not to take\nvery long to get ready.\"\n\nAs has been explained in detail in the other books of this series,\nProfessor Amos Henderson and the two lads, Mark Sampson and Jack\nDarrow, had undertaken many strange voyages together. Sometimes they\nwere accompanied by friends and assistants, while Washington White, a\nsort of servant, helper, and man-of-all-work, and Andy Sudds, an old\nhunter, always went with them.\n\nMark and Jack were orphans, who had been adopted by Professor\nHenderson, who spent all his time making wonderful machines for\ntransportation, or conducting strange experiments.\n\nThe two boys had been rescued by Professor Henderson and Washington\nWhite from a train wreck. Although both boys were badly hurt, they were\nnursed back to health by the eminent scientist, who soon learned to\ncare for the lads as though they had been his own sons.\n\nThey aided the professor, as soon as they were able, in constructing an\nairship, called the _Electric Monarch_, in which Professor Henderson\nhoped to be able to reach the North Pole. The boys thoroughly enjoyed\nthe trip through the air, and had many thrills fighting the savage\nEskimos. Finally, they succeeded in passing over the exact spot of the\nNorth Pole during a violent snowstorm.\n\nNot satisfied with their experiences after conquering the North, the\nadventurers set out for the Antarctic regions in a submarine boat. This\ntrip, even more remarkable than the first, took them to many strange\nplaces in the South Atlantic. They were trapped for a time in the\nSargasso Sea, and they walked on the ocean floor in new diving suits,\none of the professor's marvelous inventions.\n\nIt was on the voyage to the south that, coming to the surface one day,\nthe adventurers saw a strange island in the Atlantic Ocean, far from\nthe coast of South America. On it was a great whirlpool, into which the\n_Porpoise_, their submarine boat, was nearly drawn by the powerful\nsuction.\n\nThe chasm might lead to the center of the earth, it was suggested, and,\nafter thinking the matter over, on their return from the Antarctic,\nProfessor Henderson decided to build a craft in which they might solve\nthe mystery.\n\nThe details of the voyage they took in the _Flying Mermaid_, are told\nof in the third volume, entitled \"Five Thousand Miles Underground.\" The\n_Mermaid_ could sail on the water, or float in the air like a balloon.\nIn this craft the travellers descended into the centre of the earth,\nand had many wonderful adventures. They nearly lost their lives, and\nhad to escape, after running through danger of the spouting water,\nleaving their craft behind.\n\nFor some time they undertook no further voyages, and the two boys, who\nlived with Professor Henderson in a small town on the coast of Maine,\nwere sent to attend the Universal Electrical and Chemical College.\nWashington remained at home to minister to the wants of the old\nprofessor, and Andy Sudds went off on occasional hunting trips.\n\nBut the spirit of adventure was still strong in the hearts of the boys\nand the professor. One day, in the midst of some risky experiments at\ncollege, Jack and Mark, as related in \"Through Space to Mars,\" received\na telegram from Professor Henderson, calling them home.\n\nThere they found their friend entertaining as a guest Professor Santell\nRoumann, who was almost as celebrated as was Mr. Henderson, in the\nmatter of inventions.\n\nProfessor Roumann made a strange proposition. He said if the old\nscientist and his young friends would build the proper kind of a\nprojectile, they could make a trip to the planet Mars, by means of a\nwonderful motor, operated by a power called Etherium, of which Mr.\nRoumann held the secret.\n\nAfter some discussion, the projectile, called the _Annihilator_, from\nthe fact that it annihilated space, was begun. It was two hundred feet\nlong, ten feet in diameter in the middle, and shaped like a cigar. It\nconsisted of a double shell of strong metal, with a non-conducting gas\nbetween the two sides.\n\nWithin it were various machines, besides the Etherium motor, which\nwould send the projectile along at the rate of one hundred miles a\nsecond. This great speed was necessary in order to reach the planet\nMars, which, at the time our friends started for it, was about\nthirty-five millions of miles away from this earth. It has since\nreceded some distance farther than this.\n\nFinally all was in readiness for the start to Mars. Professor Roumann\nwanted to prove that the planet was inhabited, and he also wanted to\nget some of a peculiar substance, which he believed gave the planet its\nrosy hue. He had an idea that it would prove of great value.\n\nBut, though every precaution was taken, the adventurers were not to get\naway from the earth safely. Almost at the last minute, a crazy\nmachinist, named Fred Axtell, who was refused work on the projectile,\ntried to blow it up with a bomb. He partly succeeded, but the damage\nwas repaired, and the start made.\n\nInside the projectile our friends shut themselves up, and the powerful\nmotors were started. Off it shot, at the rate of one hundred miles a\nsecond, but the travellers were as comfortable as in a Pullman car.\nThey had plenty to eat and drink, they manufactured their own air and\nwater, and they slept when they so desired.\n\nBut Axtell, the crazy machinist, had hidden himself aboard, and, in\nmid-air, he tried to wreck the projectile. He was caught, and locked up\nin a spare room, but, when Mars was reached, he escaped.\n\nThe book tells how our friends were welcomed by the Martians, how they\nlearned the language, saw many strange sights, and finally got on the\ntrack of the Cardite, or red substance, which the German professor, Mr.\nRoumann, had come so far to seek. This Cardite was capable of great\nforce, and, properly controlled, could move great weights and operate\npowerful machinery.\n\nOur friends wanted to take some back to earth with them, but when they\nattempted to store it in their projectile, they met with objections,\nfor the Martians did not want them to take any. They had considerable\ntrouble, and the crazy machinist led an attack of the soldiers of the\nred planet against our friends, the adventurers in the projectile.\n\nAmong the other curiosities brought away by our friends, was a\nnewspaper printed in Mars, for the inhabitants of that place where much\nfurther advanced along certain lines than we are on this earth, but in\nthe matter of newspapers they had little to boast of, save that the\nsheets were printed by wireless electricity, no presses being needed.\n\nAs told at the opening of this story, Jack had noticed on one of the\nsheets they brought back, an account of how some of the Martians made a\ntrip to the moon, and discovered a field of Reonaris. This trip was\nmade shortly before our friends made their hasty departure, and it was\nundertaken by some Martian adventurers on another part of the red\nplanet than where the projectile landed, and so Professor Henderson and\nhis friends did not hear of it at the time.\n\n\"Well, then, suppose we make the attempt to go to the moon,\" said\nProfessor Roumann, after a long discussion in the laboratory. \"It will\nnot take long to get ready.\"\n\n\"I'd like to go,\" said Jack. \"How about you, Professor Henderson? Oh,\nby the way, Washington said you wanted to see Mark and me, but I was so\ninterested in this news item, that I forgot to ask what it as about.\"\n\n\"I merely wanted to inquire when you and Mark thought of resuming your\nstudies at college,\" said the aged man, \"but, since this matter has\ncome up, it will be just as well if you do not arrange to resume your\nlessons right away.\"\n\n\"We can study while making the trip to the moon,\" suggested Mark.\n\n\"Not much,\" declared Jack, with a laugh. \"There'll be too much to see.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll discuss that later,\" went on Mr. Henderson. \"Practically\nspeaking, I think the voyage can be made, and, the more I think of it,\nthe better I like the idea. We will look over the projectile in the\nmorning, and see what needs to be done to it to get it ready for\nanother trip through space.\"\n\n\"Not much will have to be done, I fancy,\" remarked the German\nscientist. \"But I want to make a few improvements in the Cardite motor,\nwhich I will use in place of the Etherium one, that took us to Mars.\"\n\nA little later there came a knock on the rear door of the rambling old\nhouse where the professor lived and did much of his experimental work.\n\n\"I'll go,\" volunteered Jack, and when he opened the portal there stood\non the threshold a small boy, Dick Johnson, one of the village lads.\n\n\"What is it you want, Dick?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Here's a note for you,\" went on the boy, passing over a slip of paper.\n\"I met a man down the road, and he gave me a quarter to bring it here.\nHe said it was very important, and he's waiting for you down by the\nwhite bridge over the creek.\"\n\n\"Waiting for who?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"For Mark, I guess; but I don't know. Anyhow, the note's for him.\"\n\n\"Hum! This is rather strange,\" mused Mark.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Why, this note. It says: 'It is important that I see you. I will wait\nfor you at the white bridge.' That's all there is to it.\"\n\n\"No name signed?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Not a name. But I'll just take a run down and see what it is. I'll not\nbe long. Much obliged, Dick.\"\n\nThe boy who had brought the note turned to leave the house, and Mark\nprepared to follow. Jack said:\n\n\"Let me see that note.\"\n\nHe scanned it closely, and, as Mark was getting on his hat and coat,\nfor the night was chilly, his chum went on:\n\n\"Mark, if I didn't know, that we had left Axtell, the crazy machinist,\nup on Mars, I'd say that this was his writing. But, of course, it's\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"Of course--impossible,\" agreed Mark.\n\n\"But, there's one thing, though,\" continued Jack.\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"I don't like the idea of you going off alone in the dark, to meet a\nman who doesn't sign his name to the note he wrote. So, if you have no\nobjections, I'll go with you. No use taking any chances.\"\n\n\"I don't believe I run any risk,\" said Mark, \"but I'll be glad of your\ncompany. Come along. Maybe it's only a joke.\" And the two lads started\noff together in the darkness toward the white bridge.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nPREPARING FOR A VOYAGE\n\n\n\"Seems like rather an odd thing; doesn't it?\" remarked Jack, as he and\nhis chum walked along.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"This note.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. But what made you think the writing looked like that of the\ncrazy machinist who tried to wreck the projectile?\"\n\n\"Because I once saw some of the crazy letters he sent us, and he wrote\njust like the man who gave Dick this note. But come on, let's hustle,\nand see what's up.\"\n\nIn a few minutes they came in sight of the white bridge, which was\nabout a quarter of a mile down the road from the professor's house. The\ntwo boys kept well together, and they were watching for a first sight\nof the man in waiting.\n\n\"See anything?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"No; do you?\"\n\n\"Not a thing. Wait until we get closer. He may be in the shadow. It's\ndark now.\"\n\nAlmost as Jack spoke, the moon, which had been hidden behind a bank of\nclouds, peeped out, making the scene comparatively bright. The boys\npeered once more toward the bridge, and, as they did so, they saw a\nfigure step from the shadows, stand revealed for an instant in the\nmiddle of the structure, and then, seemingly after a swift glance\ntoward the approaching chums, the person darted off in the darkness.\n\n\"Did you see that?\" cried Jack.\n\n\"Sure,\" assented Mark. \"Guess he didn't want to wait for us. Why, he's\nrunning to beat the band!\"\n\n\"Let's take after him,\" suggested Jack, and, nothing loath, Mark\nassented. The two lads broke into a run, but, as they leaped forward,\nthe man also increased his pace, and they could hear his feet pounding\nout a tattoo on the hard road.\n\nThe two youths reached the bridge, and sped across it. They glanced\nhastily on either side, thinking possibly the man might have had some\ncompanions, but no one was in sight, and the stranger himself was now\nout of view around a bend in the highway.\n\n\"No use going any farther,\" suggested Jack, pulling up at the far side\nof the bridge. \"There are two roads around the bend, and we couldn't\ntell which one he'd take. Besides, it might not be altogether safe to\nrisk it.\"\n\nMark and Jack, on their return, told Professor Henderson and the German\nscientist something of their little excursion.\n\n\"But who could he have been?\" asked Mr. Roumann. \"Perhaps if you ask\nthe boy who brought the note he can tell you.\"\n\n\"We'll do it in the morning,\" decided Mark.\n\n\"It's peculiar that he wanted Mark to meet him,\" spoke Amos Henderson.\n\"Have you any enemies that you know of, Mark?\"\n\n\"Not a one. But what makes you think this man was an enemy, Professor?\"\n\n\"From the fact that he ran when he saw you and Jack together. Evidently\nhe expected to get Mark out alone.\"\n\nThey discussed the matter for some time, and then the boys and the\nscientists retired to bed, ready to begin active preparations on the\nmorrow, for their trip to the moon.\n\nThere was much to be done, but their experience in making other\nwonderful trips, particularly the one to Mars, stood the travellers in\ngood stead. They knew just how to go to work.\n\nTo Washington was entrusted the task of preparing the food supply,\nsince he was to act as cook. Andy Sudds was instructed to look after\nthe clothing and other supplies, except those of a scientific nature,\nwhile the two young men were to act as general helpers to the two\nprofessors.\n\nAs the _Annihilator_ has been fully described in the volume entitled,\n\"Through Space to Mars,\" there is no need to dwell at any length on the\nconstruction of the projectile in which our friends hoped to travel to\nthe moon. Sufficient to say that it was a sort of enclosed airship,\ncapable of travelling through space--that is, air or ether--at enormous\nspeed, that there were contained within it many complicated machines,\nsome for operating the projectile, some for offence or defence against\nenemies, such as electric guns, apparatus for making air or water, and\nscores of scientific instruments.\n\nThe _Annihilator_ was controlled either from the engine room, or from a\npilot house forward. As for the motive power it was, for the trip to\nthe moon, to be of that wonderful Martian substance, Cardite, which\nwould operate the motors.\n\nThe projectile moved through space by the throwing off of waves of\nenergy, similar to wireless vibrations, from large plates of metal, and\nthese plates were the invention of Professor Roumann.\n\nPerhaps to some of my readers it may seem strange to speak so casually\nof a trip to the moon, but it must be remembered that our friends had\nalready accomplished a much more difficult journey, namely, that to\nMars. So the moon voyage was not to daunt them.\n\nMars, as I have said, was thirty-five millions of miles away from the\nearth when the _Annihilator_ was headed toward it. To reach the moon,\nhowever, but 252,972 miles, at the most, must be traversed--a little\nmore than a quarter of a million miles. As the distance from the earth\nto the moon varies, being between the figures I have named, and 221,614\nmiles, with the average distance computed as being 238,840 miles, it\ncan readily be seen that at no time was the voyage to be considered as\ncomparing in distance with the one to Mars.\n\nBut there were other matters to be taken into consideration, and our\nfriends began to ponder on them in the days during which they made\ntheir preparations.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nAN ACCIDENT\n\n\nWashington White was kept busy getting together the food for the\nvoyage, and he had about completed his task, while Andy Sudds announced\none morning that his department was ready for inspection, and that he\nthought he would go hunting until the projectile was ready to start.\n\n\"Well, if you see anything of that queer man who sent me the note, just\nask him what he meant by it,\" suggested Mark, for inquiry from the boy\nwho had brought the message, developed the fact that Dick did not know\nthe man, nor had he ever seen him before. He was a stranger in the\nneighborhood. But, as nothing more resulted from it, the two lads gave\nthe matter no further thought.\n\n\"How soon before we will be ready to start?\" asked Jack one day, while\nhe and his chum, with the two professors, were working over the\nprojectile, which was soon to be shot through space.\n\n\"In about two weeks,\" replied Mr. Roumann. \"I want to make a few\nchanges in the Cardite plates, which will replace the ones used on the\nEtherium motor. Then I want to test them, and, if I find that they work\nall right, as I hope, we will seal ourselves up in the _Annihilator_,\nand start for the moon.\"\n\n\"Are you going to try to go around it, and land on the side turned away\nfrom us?\" asked Mark, who had been studying astronomy lately.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked Jack. \"Doesn't the moon turn around?\"\n\n\"Not as the earth does,\" replied his chum; \"or, rather, to be more\nexact, it rotates exactly as the earth does, on its axis; but, in doing\nthis it occupies precisely the same time that it takes to make a\nrevolution about our planet. So that, in the long run, to quote from my\nastronomy, it keeps the same side always toward the earth; and today,\nor, to be more correct, each night that the moon is visible, we see the\nsame face and aspect that Galileo did when he first looked at it\nthrough his telescope, and, unless something happens, the same thing\nwill continue for thousands of years.\"\n\n\"Then we've never seen the other side of the moon?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Never; and that's why I wondered if the professor was going to attempt\nto reach it. Perhaps there are people there, and air and water, for it\nis practically certain that there is neither moisture nor atmosphere on\nthis side of Luna.\"\n\n\"Wow! Then maybe we'd better not go,\" said Jack, with a shiver. \"What\nwill we do, if we get thirsty?\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess we can manage, with all the apparatus we have, to distill\nenough water,\" said Professor Henderson, with a smile. \"Then, too, we\nwill take plenty with us, and, of course, tanks of oxygen to breathe.\nBut it will be interesting to see if there are people on the moon.\"\n\n\"If there are any, they must have a queer time,\" went on Mark.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Jack, who wasn't very fond of study.\n\n\"Why? Because the moon is only about one forty-ninth the size of the\nearth. Its diameter is 2,163 miles--only a quarter of the earth's--and,\ncomparing the force of gravity, ours is much greater. A body that\nweighs six pounds on the earth, would weigh only one pound on the moon,\nand a man on the moon could jump six times as high as he can on this\nearth, and throw a stone six times as far.\"\n\n\"What's dat?\" inquired Washington White quickly, nearly dropping some\npackages he was carrying into the projectile. \"What was yo' pleased t'\nsaggasiate, in remarkin' concernin' de untranquility ob the densityness\nob stones jumpin' ober a man what is six times high?\" he asked.\n\n\"Do you mean what did I say?\" asked Mark solemnly.\n\n\"Dat's what I done asked yo',\" spoke the colored man gravely.\n\n\"Well, you didn't, but perhaps you meant to,\" went on the youth, and he\nrepeated his remarks.\n\n\"'Scuse me, I guess I'd better not go on dish yeah trip after all,\"\ncame from Washington.\n\n\"Why not?\" demanded Professor Henderson.\n\n\"'Cause I ain't goin' t' no place whar ef yo' wants t' take a little\njump yo' has t' go six times as far as yo' does when yo' is on dis yeah\nearth. An' s'posin' some ob dem moon men takes a notion t' throw a\nstone at me? Whar'll I be, when a stone goes six times as far as it\ndoes on heah? No, sah, I ain't goin'!\"\n\n\"But perhaps there are no men on the moon,\" said Mark quickly. \"It is\nonly a theory of astronomers that I'm talking about.\"\n\n\"Oh, only a theory; eh?\" asked Washington quickly.\n\n\"That's all.\"\n\n\"Oh, if it's only a theory, den I reckons it's all right,\" came from\nthe colored man. \"I didn't know it were a theory. Dat makes it all\nright. It's jest in theory, am it, Massa Mark, dat a stone goes six\ntimes as far?\"\n\n\"That's all.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, den, why didn't yo' say so fust, dat it was only a theory? I\ndon't mind theories. I--I used t' eat 'em boiled an' roasted befo' de\nwah.\" And, with a contented smile on his face, Washington went into the\nprojectile, to finish stowing things away in his kitchen lockers.\n\nThe big projectile was housed in the shed where it had been\nconstructed, and the professor and the boys were working over it there,\ncarefully guarded from curious eyes, for the German inventor did not\nwant the secret of his Cardite motor to become known.\n\nThe work went on from day to day, good progress being made. The boys\nwere of great assistance, for they were practical mechanics, and had\nhad considerable experience.\n\n\"Well, I shall try the Cardite motor to-morrow,\" announced Professor\nRoumann one night, after a hard day's work on the projectile.\n\n\"Do you think it will work?\" asked Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"I think so, yes. My experiments have made me hopeful.\"\n\n\"And if it does work, when can we start?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Two days later; that is, if everything else is in readiness, the food\nand other, supplies on board.\"\n\n\"They are all ready to be stowed away,\" said Andy Sudds, who had been\nhunting all day.\n\nIt was an anxious assemblage that gathered inside the big shed the next\nday, to watch Professor Roumann try the Cardite motor. Would it work as\nwell as had the Etherium one? Would it send them along through space at\nenormous speed? True, they would not have to travel so far, nor so\nfast, but more power would be needed, since, as it was feared no food,\nwater, nor air could be had on the moon, many more supplies were to be\ntaken along than on the trip to Mars, and this made the projectile\nheavier.\n\n\"We will test the Cardite in this small motor first,\" said Mr. Roumann,\nas he pointed to a machine in the projectile used for winding a cable\naround a windlass when there was necessity for hauling the\n_Annihilator_ about, without sending it into the air.\n\nInto the receptacle of the motor, the German professor placed some of\nthe wonderful red substance he had secured from Mars. Then he closed\nthe heavy metal box that held it, and, looking about to see if all was\nin readiness, he motioned to those watching him that he was about to\nshift the lever that would start the motor.\n\n\"If it works as well as I hope it will,\" he said, \"it ought to pull the\nprojectile slowly across the shop--a task that would be impossible in a\nmotor of this size, if operated by electricity, gasoline, or any other\nforce at present in use. And, if this small motor will do that, I know\nthe large ones will send us through space to the moon. All ready, now.\"\n\nSlowly the professor shoved over the lever, while Jack, Mark and the\nothers watched him carefully. They were standing back of him, in the\nengine room of the projectile.\n\nThere was a clicking sound as the lever snapped into place. This was\nsucceeded by a buzzing hum, as the motor began to absorb the great\npower from the red substance, which was not unlike radium in its\naction. There was a trembling to the great projectile.\n\n\"She's moving!\" cried Jack.\n\nHardly had he spoken when there was a flash of red fire, a sound as of\na bursting bomb, and everyone was knocked from his feet, over backward,\nwhile Professor Roumann was hurled the entire length of the engine room.\n\n\"The Cardite motor has exploded!\" cried Mark. \"Professor Roumann is\nkilled!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE WORK OF AN ENEMY\n\n\nJack's first act, on arising from amid a mass of tools, into which he\nhad been tossed by the explosion, was to run to where Professor Roumann\nlay in a semi-conscious condition. An instant later Mark slowly arose,\nand made his way to where Professor Henderson was rubbing his forehead\nin a dazed fashion.\n\n\"Are you hurt?\" asked Mark, of his aged friend.\n\n\"I think not,\" answered Mr. Henderson slowly, \"but I fear Mr. Roumann\nis. See to him; I'm all right.\"\n\n\"He's breathing,\" cried Jack, who had bent over the German. \"He isn't\ndead, at any rate.\"\n\n\"But he may be, unless he gets attention,\" said Professor Henderson.\n\"Get my medicine chest, Mark, and we'll see what we can do for him.\"\n\nJack had raised the head of the injured man on his arm, and was giving\nhim some water from a glass. This partially revived the German, and he\nopened his eyes. He looked around, into the faces of his friends, as if\nscarcely comprehending what had happened, and then, as his gaze\nwandered toward the disabled Cardite motor, he exclaimed:\n\n\"Some enemy has done this! The motor was tampered with. The resistance\nblock was loosened, and that caused the force of the Cardite to shoot\nout at the rear. We must watch out for the work of this enemy!\"\n\n\"Don't distress yourself about that now,\" urged Mr. Henderson. \"Are you\nbadly hurt? Do you need a doctor?\"\n\nThe German slowly drank the rest of the water which Jack gave him, and\nthen gradually arose to a standing position.\n\n\"I am all right,\" he said faintly, \"except that I feel a trifle dizzy.\nSomething hit me on the head, and the fumes from the Cardite took away\nmy breath for a moment. I think I shall be all right soon.\"\n\n\"Here is the medicine chest!\" exclaimed Mark, coming back into the\nengine room. Mr. Henderson poured out some aromatic spirits of ammonia\ninto a graduated glass, added a little water, and gave it to his\nfellow, inventor, who, after drinking it, declared that he felt much\nbetter. There was a cut on his forehead, where a piece of the broken\nmotor had struck him, but, otherwise, he did not seem injured\nexternally.\n\nAs for the boys, they were only stunned, nor was Mr. Henderson more\nthan momentarily shocked. In a few minutes the German professor was\nalmost himself again.\n\n\"We must try to discover who our enemy is,\" he said earnestly, as he\nlooked over the disabled motor. \"He might have blown up the whole\nprojectile by tampering as he did with the machinery. Had I been\ntesting the large, instead of the small motor, there would have been\nnothing left of the _Annihilator_, or us, either. Who could have done\nthis? If that crazy machinist is around again----\"\n\n\"I don't believe he could get here from Mars,\" interrupted Jack, with a\nsmile.\n\n\"Hardly,\" added Mark.\n\n\"No, I guess he is still on the Red Planet, so it couldn't have been\nhim,\" went on Mr. Roumann. \"But it was some one.\"\n\nJack and Mark at once thought of the odd man who had sent Mark the\nnote, and then had run away.\n\n\"Could it have been him?\" suggested Jack.\n\n\"It's possible,\" remarked Professor Henderson. \"We must be on our\nguard. I wonder if Washington----\"\n\nAt that moment there sounded a violent pounding on the exterior of the\nprojectile, and the voice of the colored man could be heard calling:\n\n\"Am anything de mattah? Andy Sudds an' I is out heah, an' we heard\nsuffin goin' on in dere. Am anybody hurted?\"\n\n\"It's all over now, Wash,\" replied Jack, for the two boys, and the two\nprofessors, had shut themselves up in the projectile while they\nconducted the experiment. Jack opened the door of the _Annihilator_ and\nstepped out, being met by the colored man and the old hunter.\n\n\"You haven't seen any suspicious characters around, have you, Wash?\"\nasked Mark. \"Some one has been tampering with a motor, and it exploded.\"\n\n\"Nobody's been around since I've been here,\" announced Andy Sudds, with\na significant glance at his gun.\n\n\"Maybe it's some ob dem moon-men, what don't laik de idea ob us goin'\ndere arter dere diamonds,\" volunteered the colored man.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" admitted Jack, with a smile. \"But certainly some one has\nbeen around here who had no business to be, and we must find out who it\nwas. Better take a look around, Wash.\"\n\n\"I'll help him,\" said Andy, and, with his rifle in readiness for any\nintruders, the old hunter followed the colored man outside the big shed.\n\nMeanwhile Professor Roumann and Mr. Henderson were carefully examining\nthe exploded motor.\n\n\"I should have looked at the breech plug before turning on the power,\"\nsaid the German, \"but I had no reason to suspect that anything was\nwrong.\" He went on to explain that the explosion was something like\nthat which occurs when the breech-block of a big navy gun is not\nproperly in place. The force of the Cardite, instead of being directed\nagainst the piston-heads of the motor, shot out backward, and almost\ninto the face of the professor, who was operating the machine.\n\n\"But what could be their object?\" asked Mark. \"Who would want to injure\nus, or damage the projectile?\"\n\n\"Some enemy, of course,\" declared Jack. \"But who? The crazy machinist\nis out of it, and as for that man who sent the note to you, he seemed\ntoo big a coward to attempt anything like this.\"\n\n\"Some one evidently sneaked in here and loosened the breech-plug,\" went\non Mark, \"and it was evidently done with the idea of delaying us. The\nenemy could not have desired to utterly disable the projectile, or else\nhe would have tampered with the large motor, instead of the small one.\"\n\n\"Yes, the object seems to have been to delay us,\" admitted Professor\nHenderson; \"yet, I can't understand why. Whoever did it evidently knows\nsomething about machinery.\"\n\n\"I hope they did not discover the secret of my Cardite motor,\" said\nProfessor Roumann quickly.\n\n\"They hardly had time,\" declared Mark. \"We have been in or around the\nprojectile nearly every minute of the day, and whoever it was, must\nhave watched his chance, slipped in, stayed a few seconds, and then\nslipped out again.\"\n\nThey went carefully over the entire projectile, but could find no\nfurther damage done. Nor were there any traces of the person who had so\nnearly caused a tragedy. Washington and Andy, after a careful search\noutside the shed, had to admit that they had no clews.\n\n\"Well, the only thing to do is to go to work and build a new small\nmotor,\" announced Professor Roumann, after once more looking over the\n_debris_ of the one that had exploded.\n\n\"Will it take long?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"About two weeks. Fortunately, I can use some of the parts of this one,\nor we would be delayed longer.\"\n\n\"Still two weeks is quite a while,\" suggested Mark. \"Perhaps there'll\nbe no diamonds left on the moon when we get there, Jack,\" and he smiled\njokingly.\n\n\"Oh, I fancy there will. The article in the paper from Mars says there\nwas a whole field of them.\"\n\n\"This brings up another matter,\" said Professor Henderson. \"What will\nhappen if we bring back bushels and bushels of diamonds?--which, in\nview of what the paper says, may be possible. We will swamp the market,\nand the value of diamonds will drop.\"\n\n\"Then we must not throw them upon the market,\" decided Professor\nRoumann. \"The scarcity of an article determines its value. If we do\nfind plenty of diamonds, it will give me a chance to conduct some\nexperiments I have long postponed because of a lack of the precious\nstones. We can use them for laboratory purposes, and need not sell\nthem. In fact, with the Cardite we brought back from Mars, we have no\nlack of money, so we really do not need the diamonds.\"\n\nIt was decided, in view of the shock and upset caused by the explosion,\nthat no further work would be done that day, and so, after carefully\nlocking the shed, and posting Andy on guard with his gun, the boys and\nthe professor went into the house to discuss matters, and plan for work\nthe next day.\n\n\"Mark,\" said Jack in a low voice, as they followed the two scientists,\n\"I think it's up to us to try to find that mysterious man who sent the\nnote. I think he did this mean trick!\"\n\n\"So do I, and we'll have a hunt for him. Let's go now.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nON THE TRACK\n\n\nThe two boys gazed after Professors Henderson and Roumann. The\nscientists were deep in a discussion of various technical matters,\nwhich discussion, it was evident, made them oblivious to everything\nelse.\n\n\"Shall we ask them?\" inquired Jack in a whisper.\n\n\"No; what's the use?\" queried Mark. \"Let's go off by ourselves, and\nperhaps we can discover something. If we could once get on the trail of\nthe man who wrote the note, I think we could put our hands on the\nperson responsible for the blowing up of the motor.\"\n\n\"I agree with you. We won't bother them about our plans,\" and he waved\nhis hand toward the scientists, who had, by this time, entered the\nhouse.\n\n\"In the first place,\" said Mark, as he and his chum turned from the\nyard, and walked along a quiet country road, \"I think our best plan\nwill be to find Dick Johnson, and ask him just where it was he met the\nman who gave him a quarter to bring the note to me.\"\n\n\"What for?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Why, then, we can tell where to start from. Perhaps Dick can give us a\ndescription of the man, or tell from what direction he came. Then we'll\nknow how to begin on the trail.\"\n\n\"That's a good idea, I guess. We know where he disappeared to, or,\nrather, in nearly what direction, so that will help some.\"\n\n\"Sure. Well, then, let's find Dick.\"\n\nTo the inquiries of the two lads from the projectile, Dick Johnson\nreplied that, as he had asserted once before, that the man was a\nstranger to him.\n\n\"He was tall, and had a big black mustache,\" Dick described, \"but he\nkept his hat pulled down over his eyes, so I couldn't see his face very\nwell. Anyhow, it was dark when I met him.\"\n\n\"Where did you meet him?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Not far from your house. He was standing on the corner, where you turn\ndown to go to the woollen mill, and, as I passed him, he asked me if I\nwanted to earn a quarter.\"\n\n\"Of course you said you did,\" suggested Jack.\n\n\"Sure,\" replied Dick. \"Then he gave me the note, and told me where to\ntake it, and I did. That wasn't wrong, was it?\"\n\n\"No; only there seems to be something queer about the man, and we want\nto find out what it is,\" replied Mark.\n\n\"What was the man doing when you saw him?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Standing, and sort of looking toward your house.\"\n\n\"Looking toward our house?\" repeated Jack. \"Was he anywhere near the\nbig shed where we build the machines?\"\n\n\"Well, I couldn't say. Maybe he might have been.\"\n\n\"I guess that's all you can tell us,\" put in Mark, with a glance at his\nchum, to warn him not to go too much into details with Dick, for they\ndid not want it known that some enemy had tried to wreck the projectile.\n\n\"Yes, I can't tell you any more,\" admitted the small lad.\n\n\"Well, here's a quarter for what you did tell us,\" said Jack, \"and if\nyou see that man again, and he gives you a note for us, just keep your\neye on him, watch where he goes, and tell us. Then you will get a\nhalf-dollar.\"\n\n\"Gee! I'll be on the watch,\" promised Dick, his eyes shining at the\nprospect of so much money.\n\n\"Come on,\" suggested Jack to his chum, after the small chap had\ndeparted. \"Let's go down by the white bridge and make some inquiries of\npeople living in that vicinity. They may have seen a stranger hanging\naround, and, perhaps we can get on his trail that way.\"\n\n\"All right,\" agreed Mark, and they walked on together.\n\nThey had gone quite a distance away from the bridge, and had made\nseveral inquiries, but had met with no success, and they were about to\ngive up and go back home.\n\n\"I know one person we haven't inquired of yet,\" said Mark, as they\ntramped along.\n\n\"Who's that?\"\n\n\"Old Bascomb, who lives alone in a shack on the edge of the creek. You\nknow the old codger who traps muskrats.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure; but I don't believe he'd know anything. If he did, he's so\ncranky he wouldn't tell you.\"\n\n\"Maybe he would, if we gave him a little money for some smoking\ntobacco. It's worth trying, anyhow. Bascomb goes around a great deal,\nand he may have met a strange man in his travels.\"\n\n\"Well, go ahead; we'll ask him.\"\n\nThe muskrat trapper did not prove to be in a very pleasant frame of\nmind, but, after Mark had given him a quarter, Bascomb consented to\nanswer a few questions. The boys told him about looking for a strange\nman, describing him as best they could, though they did not tell why\nthey wanted to find him.\n\n\"Wa'al, now, I shouldn't be surprised but what I know the very fellow\nyou want,\" said the trapper. \"I met him a couple of days back, an' I\nthink he's still hanging around. Fust I thought he was after some of my\ntraps, but when I found he wa'ant, I didn't pay no more attention to\nhim. He looked jest like you say.\"\n\n\"Where was he?\" asked Jack eagerly.\n\n\"Walkin' along the creek, sort of absent-minded like.\"\n\n\"You don't know where he lives, or whether he is staying in this\nvicinity, do you?\" inquired Mark.\n\n\"Ya'as, I think I do,\" replied the trapper.\n\n\"Where?\" cried Jack eagerly.\n\n\"Wa'al, you know the old Preakness homestead, down by the bend of the\ncreek, about four mile below here?\"\n\n\"Sure we know it,\" answered Mark. \"We used to go in swimming not far\nfrom there.\"\n\n\"Wa'al, the old house has been deserted now for quite a spell,\" went on\nthe trapper, \"and there ain't nobody lived in it but tramps. But the\nother night, when I was comin' past, with a lot of rats I'd jest taken\nout of my traps, I see a light in the old house. Thinks I, to myself,\nthat there's more tramps snoozin' in there, and I didn't reckon it was\nnone of my business, so I kept on. But jest as I was walking past the\nmain gate, some one come out of the house and hurried away. I had a\ngood look at him, an'----\"\n\n\"Who was it?\" asked Mark impatiently, for the old trapper was a slow\ntalker.\n\n\"It was the same man you're lookin' for,\" declared Bascomb. \"I'm sure\nof it, an' he's hangin' out in the old Preakness house. If you want t'\nsee him, why don't you go there?\"\n\n\"We will!\" cried Jack. \"Come on, Mark. I think we're on the trail at\nlast.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nMARK IS CAPTURED\n\n\nEagerly the boys hurried forward, intent on making the best time\npossible to the old Preakness homestead, which was a landmark for miles\naround, and which, in its day, had been a handsome house and estate.\nNow it was fallen into ruins, for there was a dispute among the heirs,\nand the property was in the Chancery Court.\n\n\"Do you think we'll find him there?\" asked Mark, as they made their way\nalong the dusty highway. \"Hard to tell. Yet, if he's hanging out in\nthis neighborhood, that would be as good a place as any, for him to\nhide in.\"\n\n\"I wonder who he can be, anyhow? And how he knows me?\"\n\n\"Give it up. Evidently he isn't a tramp, though he stays in a place\nwhere there are plenty of the Knights of the Road.\"\n\nThe boys increased their pace, and were soon on the main road leading\nto the Preakness house, and about a mile away from it. \"We'll soon be\nthere now,\" remarked Jack. \"Then we'll see if we can find that man.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the lad put his hand in his pocket, and, a moment later,\nhe uttered a startled cry.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Mark, in some alarm.\n\n\"Matter? Why, gee whiz! If I haven't forgotten to send that telegram\nProfessor Henderson gave me! It's to order some special tools to take\nalong on our trip to the moon. They didn't come, and the professor\nwrote out a message urging the factory to hurry the shipment. He gave\nit to me to send, just before the accident to the motor, but when that\nhappened it knocked it out of my mind, I guess. I stuck the telegram in\nmy pocket, and here it is yet,\" and Jack drew forth a crumpled paper.\n\"Wouldn't that make you tired?\" he asked. \"It's important, and ought to\ngo at once. The professor won't like it.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what to do,\" suggested Mark, after a moment's thought.\n\"The telegraph office isn't so far away from here. You can cut across\nlots, and be there in fifteen or twenty minutes. Tell 'em to rush the\nmessage, and it may be in time yet. Anyhow, we're going to be delayed\nbecause of the accident to the motor, so it won't make so much\ndifference. But come on, let's start, and we can hurry back.\"\n\n\"I guess that's the best plan,\" remarked Jack dubiously, for he did not\nfancy a half-hour's tramp across the fields and back again. Then, as he\nthought of something else, he called out:\n\n\"Say, Mark, there's no use of both of us going to the telegraph office.\nI'll go alone, as it's my fault, and you can stay here, and watch to\nsee if that strange man appears on the scene. I'll not be long, and you\ncan wait for me here.\"\n\n\"How would it be if I went on a little nearer to the Preakness house?\"\nasked Mark. \"I can meet you there just as well as here, and something\nmay develop.\"\n\n\"Good idea! You go on, and when I come back, I'll take the road that\nleads through the old slate quarry, and save some time that way. I'll\nmeet you right near the old barn that stands on the Gilbert property,\njust before you reach the Preakness grounds.\"\n\n\"All right; I'll be there, but don't run your legs off. We're out for\nall day, and there isn't anything that needs to be done at home, or\naround the projectile, so take your time.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll not go to sleep,\" declared Jack. \"I want to see if we can't\nsolve the mystery of the man who writes such queer notes.\"\n\nJack started off across the fields at a swift pace, while Mark strolled\non down the road, in the direction of the old Preakness house. He was\nthinking of many things, chiefly of the wonderful journey that lay\nbefore them, and he was wondering what the moon would look like when\nthey got to it.\n\nThat it would be a wild, desolate place, he had no doubt, for the\nevidences of the telescopes of astronomers pointed that way, and, as is\nwell known, the most powerful instruments can now bring the moon to\nwithin an apparent distance of one hundred miles of the earth. This is\ntrue of the Lick telescope, which has a magnifying power of 2,500 and\nan object lens a yard across.\n\nBut, with this powerful telescope, it has been impossible to\ndistinguish any such objects as forests, cities, or any evidences of\nlife on the moon--that is, on the side that has always been turned\ntoward us.\n\nAlmost unconsciously, Mark went on faster than he intended, and, before\nhe knew it, he had arrived at the barn where he had promised to wait\nfor his chum. Mark looked at his watch, and found that he would still\nhave some time to linger before he could expect Jack to return. He sat\ndown on a stone beside the fence, and looked about him. The day was\nwarm for fall, and the last of the crickets were chirping away, while,\nin distant fields, men could be seen husking corn, or drawing in loads\nof yellow pumpkins.\n\n\"I wonder if we'll have pumpkin pie on the moon,\" thought Mark.\n\"Though, of course, we won't. I guess all we'll have to eat will be\nwhat Washington takes along in the projectile--that is, unless we find\npeople on the other side of the place.\"\n\nHe sat on the stone for some minutes longer, and then, tiring of the\ninactivity, he arose and strolled about. Something seemed to draw him\nin the direction of the old house, which he knew was just around the\nbend in the road.\n\n\"I guess there wouldn't be any harm in my going along and taking a peep\nat it,\" mused the lad. \"It will be some time before Jack returns, and I\nmay be able to catch a glimpse of our man. I think I'll go up where I\ncan see the place, and I can come back in time to meet Jack. I'll do\nit. Maybe the fellow might escape while I'm waiting.\"\n\nMark thus tried to justify himself for his action in not keeping to his\nagreement with his chum. Of course it was not an important matter, Mark\nthought, though the results of his simple action were destined to be\nmore far-reaching than he imagined. He thought he would be back in time\nto meet Jack, and so he strolled on, going more cautiously now, for, in\na few minutes he would come in sight of the old, deserted house, and he\ndid not know what he might find there.\n\nMark's first sight of the Preakness homestead was of two old stone\nposts, that had once formed a fine gateway. The posts were in ruins,\nnow, and half fallen down, being covered with Virginia creeper, the\nleaves of which were now a vivid red, mingled with green.\n\n\"Nothing very alarming there,\" said Mark, half aloud. He could just\ncatch a glimpse of the roof of the house over the tops of the trees,\nwhich had not yet shed all their leaves. \"Guess I'll go on a little\nfarther. Maybe our friend, the enemy, is sitting on the front porch,\nsunning himself.\"\n\nPast the old gateway Mark continued, intending to proceed along the\nhighway until he got directly in front of the old mansion. There, he\nknew, he would have a good view, unobstructed by trees or shrubbery.\n\nWhen the lad got to this place in the road, he paused, and stooped\nover, as if tying the lace of his shoe, for it was his intention to\npass himself off, if possible, as a casual passer-by, so that in case\nthe mysterious man should be in the house, his suspicions would not be\naroused by seeing the youth to whom he had written the note staring in\nat him.\n\nAnd, while he was apparently fussing with his shoe, Mark was narrowly\neying the old house.\n\n\"Not a very inviting place,\" thought Mark. \"I don't see why any man who\ncould afford anything better, would stay there--unless he has some\nstrong motive for lingering in this section. And that's probably what\nthis fellow has, and I'd like to discover it. Well, I don't see any\nsigns of him, so I guess I might as well go back, and wait for Jack.\nHe'll be along soon.\"\n\nHe stood up, took a good look at the house, and was about to retrace\nhis steps down the highway, when he saw the sagging front door of the\nold mansion slowly open. It creaked on the rusty hinges, and Mark\nstared with all his might as he saw a man emerge, a man who did not\nlook like a tramp, for his clothes were of good material and cut, and\nfit him well. Nor did he wear a stubbly growth of beard, but, on the\ncontrary, his face was clean shaven. The man was about Mark's size,\nperhaps a little taller, and nearly as stout. He stood on the sagging\nporch, and gazed off toward the road.\n\n\"Well, if that's the man Dick Johnson got the note from he's changed\nmightily in appearance,\" thought Mark, as he looked at the fellow. \"He\nisn't very tall, and he hasn't any black mustache. But of course he may\nhave shaved that off, and I suppose in the dark, and when one is in a\nhurry to earn a quarter, it's hard to say whether a man is tall or\nshort. I wonder if this can be the person we're looking for?\"\n\nMark hardly knew what to do. He stood in the road, undecided, and\nfairly stared at the man, who had left the porch, and was walking down\nthe weed-grown path. He was looking straight at Mark, but if the\nstranger was the person who had written the note, and if he recognized\nthe lad, he gave no sign to that effect.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" said the man, as he paused at the gap in the front\nwall, where once a gate had been. \"Pleasant day, isn't it.\"\n\n\"Ye--yes,\" stammered Mark, wondering what to say next.\n\n\"Live around here?\" went on the man.\n\n\"Not very far off.\"\n\n\"Ah, then you know this old shack?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't get over here, very often. Do you live here?\" ventured\nMark boldly, determining to do some questioning on his own account.\n\n\"Me live here?\" cried the man, as if indignant \"Well, hardly! I was\njust passing, and, happening to see the old place, and having a\nfondness for antiques, I stepped in. But it is in bad shape. I should\nsay tramps make it their hangout.\"\n\n\"It has that name,\" said Mark.\n\nThere was a pause for a moment, and the lad was a trifle embarrassed.\nThe man was gazing boldly at him.\n\n\"I guess I've made a mistake,\" thought Mark. \"This can't be the man we\nwant. He doesn't live here, and he doesn't look like him. I'd better be\ngetting back to meet Jack.\"\n\n\"Are you engaged at anything in particular?\" questioned the man taking\na few steps nearer the youth.\n\n\"No, I'm not working, but I expect to take a trip, shortly, with some\nfriends of mine,\" answered Mark.\n\n\"Ah, is that so?\" and there was polite inquiry in the man's voice. \"Are\nyou going far?\"\n\n\"Quite a distance.\" Mark wondered what the man would say if he told him\nhe was going to the moon.\n\n\"I wonder if you would do me a favor?\" went on the man. \"As I was\npassing through this old house I saw, on one of the outer doors, an\nold-fashioned knocker. I am a collector of antiques, and I would very\nmuch like to have that. But I need help in getting it off. I do not\nintend to steal it, but if it is left here some tramp may destroy it,\nand that would be too bad. I intend to remove it, and then hunt up the\nowners of this place, and purchase it from them.\"\n\n\"It will be hard to discover who are the owners,\" replied Mark, \"as the\ntitle is in dispute.\"\n\n\"So much the better for me. Will you help me remove the knocker? I will\npay you for your time.\"\n\nMark hesitated. He did not like the man's manner, and there was a\nshifty, uneasy look about his eyes. Still he might be all right. But\nMark did not like the idea of going into the old house with him alone.\nIt might be safe, and, again, it might not. But the knocker was on an\noutside door. There could be no harm in helping him, as long as it was\noutside. The man saw the hesitation in the lad's manner.\n\n\"It will not take us long,\" the stranger said. \"I want you to help me\npry off the knocker, as I have no screw-driver to remove it. I will pay\nyou well.\"\n\nAs he spoke he came nearer to Mark, and the lad noticed that the man's\nright hand was held behind his back. This struck Mark as rather\nsuspicious. Suddenly he became aware of a peculiar odor in the air--a\nsweet, sickish odor. He started back in alarm, all his former\nsuspicions aroused. The man seemed to leap toward him.\n\n\"Look out!\" suddenly cried the fellow. \"Look behind you!\"\n\nInvoluntarily Mark turned. He saw nothing alarming. The next instant he\nfelt himself grasped in the strong arms of the man, and a cloth that\nsmelled strongly of the strange, sweetly sickish odor was pressed over\nthe lad's face.\n\n\"Here! Stop! Let me go! Help! Help!\" cried Mark. Then his voice died\nout. He felt weak and sick, and sank back, an inert mass in the man's\narms.\n\n\"I guess I've got you this time,\" whispered the fellow, as he gazed\ndown on Mark's white face. \"I'll put you where you won't get away,\neither,\" and, picking up the youth, he carried him a prisoner into the\ndeserted house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nJACK IS PUZZLED\n\n\nWhistling merrily, with his mind as much on the big field of diamonds\nhe expected to discover on the moon, as it was on anything else, Jack\nDarrow crossed over the meadows toward the telegraph office.\n\n\"By Jinks! It certainly will be great to fly through space once more,\"\nhe mused. \"Of course it isn't much of a trip, only a quarter of a\nmillion miles at most, but it will be a little outing for us, and then\nthose diamonds!\"\n\nA trip of a quarter of a million miles only a little outing! But then\nwhat can be expected of lads who had gone to Mars and back again?\n\nJack lost no time in reaching the telegraph office, where he left the\nmessage to be sent, urging the operator to \"rush\" it, which that\nofficial promised to do.\n\n\"'Twon't be no great hardship on me, neither,\" he said with a cheerful\ngrin, \"seein' as how this is the only one I've had to send to-day. I'll\nget it right off for you, Jack.\"\n\nJack meant to hurry back, but, just as he was turning out of the main\nvillage street, to cut across lots, and join Mark at the place agreed\nupon, Jack saw two dogs fighting. It was with the best intentions in\nthe world that he ran toward them, for he wanted to separate them.\nHowever a man was ahead of him, and soon had the two beasts apart. But\nJack lingered several moments to see if there would be a renewal of the\nhostilities. There wasn't, and he hurried on. In a short time he was\nwithin sight of the barn, where his chum had agreed to meet him.\n\n\"Mark!\" cried Jack, when he came within hailing distance.\n\nThere was no response.\n\n\"Maybe he's hiding to fool me,\" thought the lad, \"I'll give him another\ncall.\"\n\nNeither was there a reply to this shout, and Jack, with a vague feeling\nof fear in his heart, hurried forward, climbed the fence that separated\nthe field from the highway, and fairly ran toward the barn.\n\nA glance sufficed to show that Mark was not in sight, and, thinking\nthat his chum might be on the other side, Jack went around the\nstructure.\n\n\"Oh, you Mark!\" he called. \"I'm back! Let's get a move on and go to the\nold house.\"\n\nSilence was the only answer.\n\n\"That's queer,\" murmured Jack, when he had made a circuit of the place,\nand had seen no sight of his friend. \"I wonder if anything could have\nhappened to him? Perhaps he went inside, and has fallen down the hay\nmow. I'll take a look.\"\n\nHe made a thorough inspection of the ramshackle old structure, but\nthere was no evidence that Mark had entered it, and Jack was soon quite\nassured that no harm had befallen his friend in there. Then a sudden\nthought came to him.\n\n\"Why, of course!\" he exclaimed aloud. \"I should have thought of that\nbefore. Mark got tired of waiting, and went on to the Preakness house.\nI might have known. I'll go on and catch up to him there.\"\n\nJack had reasoned correctly, but he could not know, what had taken\nplace with only the old, grim, deserted mansion for a witness. With a\nlighter heart he set off down the road.\n\nIt did not take him long, at the pace he kept up, to come within sight\nof the old gateway, with the creeper twining over the pillars. Then he\ncaught a glimpse of the house, and he at once slackened his footsteps.\n\n\"No use rushing into this thing,\" he reasoned in a whisper. \"Mark may\nbe in hiding, taking an observation of the mysterious man, and I don't\nwant to spoil it, by butting in. Guess I'll lie low for a while, and\nsee what develops.\"\n\nCrouching down beside some bushes that lined the roadway Jack looked\ntoward the silent, tumbled-down house and waited. All was still.\nOccasionally a shutter flapped in the wind, the hinges creaking\ndismally, or some of the loose window-panes rattled as the sash was\nblown to and fro. It was not a pleasant aspect, and as the afternoon\nwas waning, and the sun was going down, while a cool wind sprang up,\nJack was anything but comfortable in his place of observation.\n\nAnd the one objection to it was that there was nothing to observe. Not\na sign of life was to be seen about the place, and the broken windows,\nlike so many unblinking eyes, stared out on the fields and road.\n\n\"Oh pshaw!\" exclaimed Jack at length, \"I'm not going to sit here this\nway! I'm going up and take a look. It can't bite me, and if that man's\nin there I can give him some sort of a talk that will make it look all\nright. I'm going closer. Maybe Mark's inside there, waiting for me,\nthough it's queer why he didn't keep his agreement and wait for me at\nthe barn. Well, here goes.\"\n\nThough he spoke bravely, it was not without a little feeling of\napprehension that Jack started toward the old mansion. He kept a close\nwatch for the advent of any person or persons who might be in the\nhouse, but, when he reached the front porch, and had seen no one, he\nfelt more at ease.\n\n\"Hello, Mark!\" he cried boldly. \"Are you inside?\"\n\nHe paused for an answer. None came.\n\n\"This is getting rather strange,\" murmured Jack, who was now quite\npuzzled as to what to make of the whole matter. \"Mark must be here, yet\nwhy doesn't he answer me? Oh, you Mark!\" he shouted at the top of his\nvoice.\n\nThere was only silence, and, after waiting a few moments Jack made up\nhis mind that the best plan would be to enter the house and look around.\n\nHe made a hasty search through the lower rooms, but saw no sign of\nMark. It was the same upstairs, and on the third floor there was no\nevidence of his chum. Jack called again, but got no reply.\n\n\"The garret next, and then the cellar,\" he told himself, and these two\nplaces, darker and more dismal than any other parts of the old mansion,\nwere soon explored.\n\n\"Well, if Mark came here he's not here now,\" thought Jack, \"and there's\nno use in my staying any longer. Maybe something happened that he had\nto go back home. Perhaps he's trailing the man. We should have made up\nsome plan to be followed in case anything like that happened.\"\n\nDeciding that the best thing he could do would be to go back home Jack\ncame out of the old house. As he did so he gave a final call:\n\n\"Mark! Oh, you Mark! Are you anywhere about?\"\n\nWhat was that? Was it an answer, or merely the echo of his own voice?\nJack started, and then, as he heard another sound, he said:\n\n\"Only the wind squeaking a shutter. Mark isn't here.\"\n\nIf Jack had only known!\n\nThrough the quickly-gathering darkness Jack turned his steps toward\nhome. On the way along the country road he kept a sharp lookout for any\nsign of his chum, and, also, he looked to see if he could catch a\nglimpse of any person who might answer the description of the man they\nsuspected of tampering with the Cardite motor.\n\nBut the road was deserted, save for an occasional farmer urging his\nhorses along, that he might the more quickly get home to supper.\n\n\"It's mighty strange,\" mused Jack, as he kept on. \"I don't think Mark\ndid just right, and yet, perhaps, when it's all explained, he may have\ngood reasons for what he did. Maybe I'm wrong to worry about him, and,\njust as likely as not, he's safe home, wondering what kept me. But he\nmight have known that I'd come back to the barn where I said I'd meet\nhim. Of course that dog-fight delayed me a little, but not much.\"\n\nIt was quite dark when Jack reached the house where he and his chum\nlived with the two professors. There was a cheerful light glowing from\nmany windows, and Jack also noticed an illumination in the shed where\nthe projectile was housed.\n\n\"Guess they're working on it, to get it in shape for the trip, sooner\nthan they expected,\" he mused.\n\nJack was met at the door by Washington White.\n\n\"Hello, Wash!\" greeted the lad.\n\n\"Good land a' massy! Where hab yo' been transmigatorying yo'se'f during\nde period when the conglomeration of carbohydrates and protoids hab\nbeen projected on to de interplanetary plane ob de rectangle?\"\n\n\"Do you mean where have I been while supper was getting ready?\" asked\nJack.\n\n\"Dat's 'zackly what I means, Massa Jack.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you say it?\"\n\n\"I done did. Dat's what I done. Supper's cold. But where am Massa Mark?\"\n\n\"What! Isn't Mark home?\" cried Jack, starting back in alarm.\n\n\"No, Massa Jack, we ain't seed him sence yo' two went off togedder.\nWhere yo' all been?\"\n\n\"Mark not home!\" gasped Mark. \"Where is Professor Henderson, Wash? I\nmust speak to him at once.\"\n\n\"He am out in de shed wif Massa Roumann.\"\n\nWith fear in his heart Jack dashed out toward the big shed.\n\n\"Ain't yo' goin' t' hab some supper?\" called Washington.\n\n\"I don't want any supper--yet,\" flung back Jack over his shoulder.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nA DARING PLOT\n\n\nMark Sampson lay an inert mass in the arms of the man who had attacked\nhim. Through the sagging door of the old, deserted house the captive\nlad was carried, and up creaking stairs.\n\n\"I guess no one saw me,\" whispered the man. \"I'm safe, so far, and I\ncan work my scheme to perfection. Everything turned out well for me. I\nwas just wondering how I could get this youth in my power, and he\nfairly walked into my hands! Now to keep him safe until I can take his\nplace in the projectile, and have my revenge. I have waited a long time\nfor it, but it has come at last!\"\n\nPausing at the head of the creaking stairs the man looked behind him,\nto make sure that he was not being followed, but not a sound broke the\nstillness of the old house, save the rattle and bang of the ruined\nshutters.\n\n\"I'm safe! Safe!\" exulted the man, with a cruel chuckle. \"Now to bind\nhim, and hide him in the secret chamber.\"\n\nHe laid Mark down on a pile of bagging in a corner of a room at the\nhead of the stairs. Then, still glancing behind him, as if fearful of\nbeing observed, the man walked over to a mantlepiece, fumbled about a\nbit of carving that adorned the centre, and pressed on a certain spot.\nA moment later the mantle seemed to swing out, and there was revealed a\nsecret room, the existence of which would never have been suspected by\nthe casual observer.\n\nTaking some of the bags from the pile where the unconscious lad was,\nthe man made a rude bed in the secret room. Then he carried Mark in,\nand placed him in a fairly comfortable position, first taking the\nprecaution, however, of binding his hands and feet.\n\n\"There,\" whispered the man, when he had finished, \"I guess you'll not\nget away in a hurry. Now I'll wait until dark, and then I'll give you\nsomething to eat, for I don't want you to starve. But I must keep in\nhiding, for, very likely, there'll be a search made for him. Guess I'd\nbetter stay here, and see what happens,\" and the mysterious man pressed\nthe spring that sent the mantle back into place again, hiding all\ntraces of the secret room.\n\n\"It's a good thing I stumbled upon this hiding place,\" he said to\nhimself. \"It couldn't be better for what I want. Now to see what\nhappens next.\"\n\nHe did not have long to wait, for in a short time Jack, as we have\nseen, appeared on the scene, and began his search. At the sound of his\nvoice, calling for Mark, the man started in his hiding place, and\nglanced uneasily at Mark.\n\n\"He may hear, and wake up,\" he whispered.\n\nJack came upstairs in the deserted house, and continued his search\nthere, calling from time to time. He gave one loud shout at the head of\nthe stairs, and the very thing that the man feared would happen came to\npass.\n\nThe effect of the drug having worn off, Mark stirred uneasily, and\nstarted up. He heard Jack's cry, and uttered a half-articulate answer.\nIn an instant the man was at his side, and had quickly gagged him. This\nhad the further effect of awakening the unfortunate lad; and he\nstruggled to loosen his bonds, but they were too strongly tied. He\nendeavored to answer Jack, but only a meaningless mumble resulted, for\nthe gag was effective.\n\n\"All you have to do is to keep quiet,\" urged the man, as he knelt\nbeside Mark in the darkness. \"As soon as your chum goes, I'll take that\nthing out of your mouth, and give you something to eat.\"\n\nJack's voice died away, and presently, as the ears of the man told him,\nthe boy left the old house. Waiting some time, to make sure that he\nwould not return, the man removed the knot of rags from Mark's mouth,\nand slightly loosened his bonds, first warning him, however, that if he\nattempted to escape he would be harshly dealt with.\n\n\"But what right have you to keep me here?\" demanded the youth. \"Who are\nyou, and what have I done to you, that you should treat me this way?\nAre you crazy? Don't you know that you are liable to arrest for this?\"\n\n\"No one can arrest me,\" boasted the fellow.\n\n\"But why have you made me a prisoner?\" demanded Mark.\n\n\"For reasons of my own. You'll see very soon.\"\n\n\"But what have I done to you?\" persisted the lad. \"I never saw you\nbefore, that I know of, unless you are the man who sent me the note,\nand who ran when my chum and I came to the bridge to meet you.\"\n\n\"I'm the man,\" was the answer, with a chuckle.\n\n\"Then you must be the one who tried to wreck our projectile,\" went on\nMark.\n\n\"Yes, I did that, and now I am sorry for it, for I have thought of a\nmuch better scheme for getting even, and having my revenge on you.\"\n\n\"But why do you want to be revenged on us?\"\n\n\"Because of what you have done!\" and the man's voice took on an ugly\ntone.\n\n\"But what did we do?\" begged Mark.\n\n\"You'll know soon enough,\" was the answer, with a cunning laugh, and\nthen Mark was sure he had to deal with a lunatic. He ceased his\nstruggles to loosen the bonds, and resolved to meet cunning with\ncunning. He would bide his time.\n\n\"Will you promise to be quiet, and not kick up a fuss if I get you\nsomething to eat?\" asked the man.\n\n\"Yes; but I'd rather have a drink of water first. I feel sick.\"\n\n\"Very well, you shall have some water. I'll have to go out and get it,\nbut I must first blindfold you, so that you will not discover the\nsecret of this room.\"\n\nMark could not help himself, for he was bound, and when the man had\ntied a handkerchief over his eyes, Mark heard his captor moving about.\n\nNext there came a sound as of some heavy body, or object, being pushed\nacross the room. Mark felt a draught of wind on his face, but it ceased\ninstantly, and he knew that he was alone. He tried to work the bandage\nfrom over his eyes, and he endeavored to loosen his bonds, for he did\nnot consider that this violated his promise. But it was of no effect.\n\nPresently he heard the moving, shoving sound again, and once more felt\nthe wind on his face. Then he heard the voice of his captor speaking.\n\n\"Here is food and drink. I'm going to untie your hands so you can eat,\nbut mind, no fighting, for I'm a desperate man, and I won't stand any\nnonsense!\"\n\nHe fumbled about the bonds, and soon Mark was free to stand up and use\nhis hands. The bandage was taken from his eyes, and he was able to peer\nabout his prison by the light of a candle which his captor had brought.\n\nMark's first glance was at the man. He was the same one who had emerged\nfrom the house to attack and drug him, but as for recognizing in him\nthe person who had been at the bridge, this was impossible. As far as\nMark could tell he had never seen the man before, nor did he answer the\ndescription given by Dick Johnson.\n\nThere was little danger that Mark would attempt violence. He was too\nweak, and his jailer seemed a powerful fellow. Then, too, the lad felt\nill from the effects of the drug.\n\n\"Drink some water, and eat a bit, and you'll feel better,\" urged the\nman, which advice Mark followed, though, his appetite was not of the\nbest, and he was much worried as to what his friends would think about\nhis strange disappearance.\n\n\"What do you intend to do with me?\" asked Mark, when he felt a little\nbetter from the effects of the food and drink. The man had sat on an\nold soap box, and watched his captive while he ate.\n\n\"Do with you? Why, I'm going to keep you here until your friends have\nleft in the projectile,\" was the answer.\n\n\"But why don't you want me to go with them?\"\n\n\"Oh, I have my reasons. You'll find out soon enough. You can't go,\nthat's all.\"\n\n\"But why do you take such an interest in me? Why didn't you capture my\nchum Jack, too, while you were about it?\"\n\n\"Two reasons. One was that Jack wouldn't answer my purpose, and the\nother was that I didn't have a chance to get him. You walked right into\nmy trap, just when I was doing my best to think of another plan to get\nhold of you, since my first one failed.\"\n\n\"But what is your purpose?\" insisted the lad. \"What do you want with\nme?\" He thought perhaps if he questioned the man closely enough he\nmight discover something that would give him a clew, or might aid him\nto escape.\n\n\"You'll learn soon enough,\" was the answer.\n\n\"Will you tell me your name?\" asked Marie quietly.\n\n\"No--why should I?\" was the quick reply. \"If I told you who I was you\nwould at once know why I have made you a captive here. No; you shall\nhear all in good time, but that will not be until I am ready.\n\n\"Now,\" went on his captor, after a period of silence, \"I shall have to\nbind and blindfold you again.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Mark, in some alarm.\n\n\"Because I don't want you to see how I get in and out of this room, and\nthat's the only way I can guard my secret. Though if you promise not to\nremove the bandage from your eyes within five minutes from the time I\nleave you, I will not have to tie your hands and feet. After I am gone\nyou may take the handkerchief off, but when you hear me rap on the\nwall, ready to come back again, you must once more blindfold yourself.\nOtherwise I shall have to tie you up.\"\n\nMark considered a moment. It was not pleasant to be tied with the cruel\nropes, and he felt that in time he could penetrate the mystery of how\nthe room opened, even if he did not see his jailer enter and leave.\n\n\"I promise,\" he said finally.\n\n\"That's good. It simplifies matters. Now you can blindfold yourself,\nand I trust to your honor. You may remove the bandage in five minutes,\nbut when you hear me knock, you must replace it until I am in the\napartment. Then you can take it off again.\"\n\nThere was little choice but to obey, and Mark tied the handkerchief\nover his eyes. He listened intently, heard the man moving about the\nroom, felt the wind on his cheeks, and then came silence.\n\nHe waited until he thought five minutes had passed, and then took off\nthe bandage. The candle was burning where the man had set it, but the\nfellow himself was gone. He had taken with him the broken dishes, and\nremains of the food Mark had not eaten. The glass and a pitcher of\nwater stood on a broken table, and Mark took a big drink.\n\n\"Now to see if I can't get out of this place,\" he murmured to himself.\n\nMark had invented many pieces of apparatus, and he was considered a\ngood mechanician. Consequently he went about his task in a systematic\nmanner. He examined the walls carefully by the candle, which he carried\nin his hand, but no opening was apparent.\n\n\"Of course, there must be some secret spring to press,\" said the lad.\n\"That's how he gets in and out. A section of the wall moves, but where\nit is I can't see. It will take time. I must look at every inch.\"\n\nHe was in the midst of his investigations when there sounded on the\nwall back of him three raps.\n\n\"Ha! At least, that tells me where the opening is,\" thought the lad.\n\"It's on that side, but now I have to put that blamed bandage on. Well,\nI may be able to escape yet.\"\n\nTrue to his promise, he blindfolded himself well, and presently he\nheard a noise, felt a draught of air, and he knew his captor was in the\nroom.\n\n\"You can now take off the handkerchief,\" said the man. \"I have brought\nyou some more bags for bed clothing. It isn't much, but it is all I\nhave. They will keep you warm tonight.\"\n\n\"Are you going to imprison me over night?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Yes, and I'll stay here with you. No one can find us here. The secret\nroom is well hidden. But first I have another matter that needs\nattention. I am going to ask you a question.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked the captive, wondering what strange request the mentally\nunbalanced man would make now.\n\nThe man leaned forward and whispered something in Mark's ear, as if he\nwas afraid the very walls would hear.\n\n\"I'll not do it!\" cried the youth. \"I'll never aid you to deceive my\nfriends, for that is your object. I'll never do it!\"\n\n\"Then I shall have to use force,\" was the determined response. \"You may\ntake your choice!\"\n\nPoor Mark did not know what to do, yet there was little he could choose\nbetween. The man had him in his power, yet the lad was terribly afraid\nof the result of the daring scheme which he knew was in the mind of the\nlunatic, for such he believed the man to be.\n\n\"Will you not give up this plan?\" begged Mark. \"I know Professor\nHenderson will pay you any sum in reason to let me go. You can become a\nrich man.\"\n\n\"I don't want riches--I want revenge!\" exclaimed the man. And he glared\nat Mark, while throughout the dismal, deserted house there sounded the\nrattle and bang of the flapping shutters.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nMARK'S STRANGE ACTIONS\n\n\nJack Darrow fairly burst into the big shed where the two scientists\nwere at work over the ruined motor. They looked up at his excitable\nentrance, and Mr. Henderson called out:\n\n\"Why, Jack, what's the matter?\"\n\n\"Quite a lot, I'm afraid,\" answered the lad, and there was that in his\nvoice which alarmed the professors.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" inquired Mr. Roumann, laying aside some of the\ndamaged motor plates.\n\n\"Mark's gone!\" gasped Jack.\n\n\"Gone! Where?\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"I don't know, but he went to the deserted house, where we thought the\nmysterious man was hiding, and since then I can't find him.\"\n\nThen the frightened lad proceeded to explain what he and Mark had\nundertaken, and the outcome of it; how his chum had failed to meet him\nat the rendezvous, and how Jack had searched through the old house\nwithout result.\n\n\"There's but one thing to do,\" declared Professor Henderson, when he\nhad listened to the story. \"We must go back there and make a more\nthorough search.\"\n\n\"What--to-night?\" exclaimed the German.\n\n\"Surely. Why not? We can't leave Mark there all alone. He may be hurt,\nor in trouble.\"\n\n\"That's what I think,\" said Jack. \"I'll tell Washington and Andy, and\nwe'll go back and hunt for him. Poor Mark! If he had only waited for\nme, perhaps this would never have happened, and if I hadn't stopped at\nthe dog-fight maybe Mark would have waited for me. Well, it's too late\nto worry about that now. The thing is to find him; and I guess we can.\"\n\nJack would not stop longer than to snatch a hasty bite of supper before\nhe joined the searching party. Washington and he carried lanterns,\nwhile Andy Sudds had his trusty rifle, and the two professors brought\nup in the rear, armed with stout clubs, for Jack's account of the\naffair made them think that perhaps they might have to deal with a\nviolent man.\n\n\"Hadn't you better notify the police?\" suggested Andy. \"A couple of\nconstables would be some help.\"\n\n\"Not very much,\" declared Jack. \"Besides, there are only two in\nBayside, and it's hard to locate either one when you want them. I guess\nwe can manage alone.\"\n\n\"Yes, I would rather not notify the police if it can be avoided,\" said\nProfessor Henderson.\n\nThe searching party hurried along the country highway, which was now\ndeserted, as it was quite dark. Their lanterns flashed from side to\nside, but they had no hope of getting any trace of Mark until they came\nto the old barn, at least, though Jack wished several times that he\nmight meet his chum running toward them along the road.\n\nThey reached the barn in due course, and while Washington, Jack and\nAndy began a search of it, the two scientists went up to the house of\nthe man who owned it and enlisted his aid. They asked him if he had\nseen Mark around that afternoon, but the farmer had not.\n\n\"But me an' my hired man'll come out and help you hunt through the\nbarn,\" he said. \"I remember once, when I was a lad, that my brother\nfell off the hay mow and lay unconscious in a manger for five hours\nbefore we found him. Maybe that's what's happened to this young man,\"\nsuggested Mr. Hampton, which was the farmer's name.\n\n\"I looked around pretty well this afternoon,\" explained Jack, when the\nfarmer and his man had reached the barn, \"but, of course, I didn't know\nall the nooks and corners.\"\n\nA thorough search of the structure, however, failed to reveal the\npresence of Mark, and then the farmer volunteered to accompany the\nparty on to the old Preakness house. His offer was received with\nthanks, and, bringing two more lanterns with them, Mr. Hampton and his\nman added considerable to the illumination.\n\nThey went through the old mansion from garret to cellar, and called\nrepeatedly, but there was no answer. And good reason, for in the secret\nroom, with his captive, the mysterious man heard the first approach of\nthe searching party; and he quickly bound Mark and gagged him, so that\nhe could not answer.\n\nThere was nothing to do but to leave, and it was with sad hearts that\nJack and his friends departed, their search having been unavailing.\nThey turned toward home, which they reached quite late, but found\nnothing disturbed.\n\nNo one in Professor Henderson's house slept much that night, and in the\nmorning pale and wan faces looked at each other, all asking the same\nquestion: \"Where is Mark?\"\n\nBut no one could answer.\n\nThey talked over the matter, and decided that Jack, with Andy and\nWashington, should form a searching party to scour the surrounding\ncountry. The two scientists were too old for such work, and, as the aid\nof the police was not desired, it was felt that the three could do all\nthat was necessary.\n\nAccordingly, while Professor Henderson and his German friend went to\nwork on the damaged motor, which did not need as much repairing as at\nfirst was thought to put it in working shape again, Jack and the two\nmen started off to hunt for Mark.\n\nThey were gone all that day, returning very much discouraged at dusk,\nsaying that they could get no trace of him.\n\n\"I don't see where he can be!\" exclaimed Jack desperately, for, though\nthe two lads were not related, they had been friends so long, and had\nshared so many pleasures and dangers together, that they were like\nbrothers. \"You won't start for the moon until you find him, will you,\nProfessor?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"No, indeed; though we could start to-morrow if he was here,\" replied\nthe aged scientist. \"The special tools came to-day, and the motor has\nbeen repaired. We have tested it, and the Cardite power works even\nbetter than did the Etherium apparatus.\"\n\n\"Then we can start as soon as Mark is found?\" asked Andy Sudds.\n\n\"Yes, for everything has been put inside the projectile, and all that\nremains is to haul it out of the shed, point it at the moon, and start\nthe motor.\"\n\n\"Then I guess I'll give my gun a final cleaning, and get ready. There\nmay be good hunting on the moon,\" said the old hunter.\n\nJack was tired from his long tramp that day, searching for his missing\nchum, but before he went to bed he wanted to go out and take a look at\nthe big projectile, which was now ready to start for the moon.\n\nAs he turned around the corner of the immense shed to enter the door,\nhe was startled by seeing a figure coming toward him. Jack started,\nrubbed his eyes, and peered again.\n\n\"Is it possible? Can I be mistaken?\" he whispered.\n\nThe figure came nearer. Jack, who had come to a halt, broke into a run.\n\n\"Mark! Mark!\" he cried joyously. \"Oh, you've come back! Where have you\nbeen?\"\n\nJack was about to clasp his chum in his arms when he saw that Mark's\narm was in a sling, and that his face was all bandaged up, so that\nscarcely any of his features showed. Had it not been for the clothes,\nand a certain stoutness of which Mark never could seem to get rid, Jack\nwould scarcely have known his friend.\n\n\"Why, Mark, what happened?\" cried Jack. \"Have you met with an accident?\nWhere have you been? In a hospital? What became of you? Why didn't you\nwait for me?\"\n\n\"I can't answer all those questions at once,\" was the reply, and Jack\nthought Mark's voice was curiously muffled and hoarse, entirely unlike\nhis usual tones. But he ascribed that to the bandages around the mouth.\n\n\"Well, answer one at a time then,\" said Jack, and there was an\nundefinable, strange air about his chum which cooled Jack's first\nimpulse of gladness. \"Whatever happened to you, Mark? Are you hurt?\"\n\n\"I was--yes,\" came the reply, in short, jerky tones. \"I had an\naccident, and I've been in a hospital. That's why I couldn't send you\nword. But I'm all right now. When does the projectile start?\"\n\n\"To-morrow, now that you're here. But tell me more about it. Where were\nyou hurt?\"\n\n\"On my head and arm.\"\n\n\"No; I mean where did the accident occur?\"\n\n\"Oh, in the old house where I went to--to look for that man.\"\n\n\"Did you find him?\" asked Jack eagerly.\n\n\"No. He's not there now.\"\n\n\"Well, never mind. We won't bother about him. Come on to the house. My,\nbut I'm glad to see you again! And so will the others be.\"\n\nIn his enthusiasm at seeing his chum again Jack wanted to hug him. He\napproached Mark, but the latter cried out:\n\n\"Look out! Don't come too close!\"\n\n\"Why not? Have you caught some disease?\"\n\n\"No, but you might hurt my broken arm!\"\n\n\"Oh, is it broken? That's tough luck. Did you fall?\"\n\n\"Yes--in the old house. I fell down stairs.\"\n\n\"And your head is all bandaged up, too,\" went on Jack, trying to peer\ninto his friend's face through the roll of bandages.\n\n\"Look out! Don't come too near!\" again warned the other. \"You might\njostle against me, and knock off some of the bandages.\"\n\n\"Did you lose some of your teeth, the reason your voice sounds so\nfunny?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Yes, I did knock out a few when I tumbled. But don't bother about me.\nI'll be all right soon. Let's go in the house. I want to go to bed.\"\n\n\"But they'll all want to see you, and hear about the accident, Mark,\"\ninsisted Jack. \"My, but we've been all worked up about you. How did you\nhappen to be taken to a hospital?\"\n\n\"A farmer came along, and I hailed him. Then I lost consciousness, and\ncouldn't let you know where I was. But never mind the details. I'm\nanxious to get started on the trip to the moon. Couldn't we start\nto-night?\"\n\n\"I don't believe so. You need rest. But come on in the house.\" Then\nJack hurried on ahead, calling: \"Mark's found! Mark is back!\"\n\nHis cries brought all of the others out on the porch, and at first they\ncould scarcely believe the good news, but soon Jack and the new arrival\ncame in sight. As Jack had been, the two professors and the others were\nstartled when they saw how Mark was bundled up in bandages.\n\n\"He fell down stairs,\" explained Jack.\n\n\"Come over here where it's light, so I can see you,\" suggested\nProfessor Henderson. \"Perhaps some of the bandages have slipped off\nsince you came from the hospital. Why did you come alone? Why didn't\nyou send us word where you were as soon as you were conscious, and we\nwould have come for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't want to bother you,\" explained the bundled-up figure. \"I\nmanaged to walk it all right.\"\n\n\"But your injuries may need attention,\" insisted Mr. Henderson. \"I know\nsomething about doctoring. Come here where I can see.\"\n\n\"No--no--the--light hurts my eyes,\" was the hasty reply. \"I guess I'll\ngo to bed, so as to be all ready to start in the morning. Why don't you\nleave for the moon to-night, professor?\"\n\n\"There are still a few little details to look after. But are you sure\nyou are well enough to go with us? We may meet with hardships up on the\nmoon.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm all ready to go,\" was the answer. \"I'd start to-night if I\ncould. But now I must get to bed.\"\n\n\"Don't you want supper?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"No, I had some just before I left the hospital.\"\n\n\"What hospital was it?\" inquired Andy Sudds. \"I was in one once, and I\ndidn't like it. There wa'nt enough air for me.\"\n\n\"I forget the name of the place,\" came the reply. \"I can't think\nclearly. I need sleep.\"\n\nThe newcomer kept in the shadows of the room, as if the light hurt his\neyes, and appeared restless and ill at ease. With the hand that was not\nin a sling he pulled the bandages closer about his face.\n\n\"Can't you tell us more about what happened?\" asked Jack, for Mark was\nnot usually so reticent, and his chum noticed it.\n\n\"There isn't much to tell,\" was the response. \"I went to the old house,\nand I was looking around when I happened to tumble down stairs. I must\nhave been knocked unconscious, but when I came to I crawled outside. A\nfarmer was driving past, and I asked him to take me to a hospital.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you come home?\" asked Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"Oh, I didn't want to make any trouble and delay work on the\nprojectile. I figured that I could be with you in a few hours, and you\nwouldn't worry. But they insisted that I must stay in the hospital when\nthey got me there. Then I lost consciousness again, and couldn't manage\nto let you know where I was. But I'm all right now.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you wait for me at the barn, when I went to send the\ntelegram, as you promised you would?\" asked Jack, who felt a little\nhurt at his chum's neglect.\n\n\"Did I promise to wait for you at some barn?\"\n\n\"Yes; don't you remember?\" and Jack gazed at the bandaged figure in\nsurprise.\n\n\"Oh, yes--I--I guess I do. But I want to go to bed now,\" and pulling\nthe cloths closer about his face the injured one started from the\napartment.\n\n\"Here. That's not the way up to your room. The stairs are over here,\"\ncalled Jack, for he saw the newcomer taking the wrong direction.\n\n\"Oh, yes. Guess my mind must be wandering,\" and with an uneasy laugh\nthe injured one turned about. They heard him going up stairs, and a\nlittle later Jack followed. He found that Mark's room was not occupied.\n\n\"Hi, Mark! Where are you?\" he called, in some alarm.\n\n\"Here,\" was the answer, and the voice came from Jack's own apartment.\n\n\"Well, you're in the wrong bunk.\"\n\n\"Am I? Well, I must have made another mistake. My head can't be right,\"\nand with that the other came out and hastily went into the adjoining\napartment.\n\nFor a moment Jack stood in the hall. He looked at the door that had\nclosed behind the bandaged figure.\n\n\"There's something wrong,\" said Jack in a low voice. \"How strange Mark\nacts! I wonder what can be the matter?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nREADY FOR THE MOON\n\n\nThere were busy times for the moon-voyagers the next day. They were up\nearly, for at the last moment many little details needed to be settled.\nThe Cardite motor had been thoroughly repaired, for the damage caused\nby the unknown enemy had done no permanent harm.\n\nWhen the injured one appeared the bandage on his head seemed larger\nthan ever, and his features were almost hidden. He still wore his arm\nin a sling.\n\n\"Well, how do you feel?\" asked Jack, looking narrowly at the figure. He\ncould not get rid of a suspicion that something was wrong with Mark.\n\n\"Oh, I'm feeling pretty fair,\" was the mumbled answer. \"I didn't sleep\nmuch, though.\"\n\n\"Well, take care of yourself,\" advised Jack. \"We are about ready to\nstart. We'll get off about noon, Professor Henderson says. Don't try to\ndo anything and injure your broken arm. You certainly had a tough time\nof it.\"\n\n\"Yes, I guess I did. I can't do much to help you.\"\n\n\"You don't need to. We're all but finished. Just hang around and watch\nme work. There isn't much to do.\"\n\nBut though Jack gave an invitation to remain near him, the other seemed\nto prefer being off by himself. He wandered in and out of the\nprojectile, now and then helping Andy or Washington to carry light\nobjects into the _Annihilator_. But all the while he was careful not to\ndisturb the bandage on his face, and several times he stopped to\nreadjust it. Nor did he talk much, which Jack ascribed to his statement\nthat his teeth hurt him. And when the bandaged figure did speak, it was\nin mumbling tones, very different from Mark's usually cheerful ones.\n\n\"Well,\" remarked Professor Roumann, after a final inspection of the big\nCardite motor--the one that was to be depended on to carry them to the\nmoon--\"I think we are about ready to leave this earth. How about it,\nProfessor Henderson?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so. Have you made any calculation as to speed?\"\n\n\"Yes, we will not have to move nearly as fast as we did when we went to\nMars. We only have to cover a quarter of a million of miles at the\nmost, and probably less than that. The motor will send us along at the\nrate of about a mile a second, which is three thousand six hundred\nmiles an hour, or eighty-six thousand four hundred miles a--day. At\nthat rate we would be at the moon in less than three days.\n\n\"But I don't want to travel as fast as that,\" the German went on. \"I\nwant time to make some scientific observations on the way, and so I\nhave reduced the speed of the Cardite motor by half, though should we\nneed to hasten our trip we can do so.\"\n\n\"Then we'll be about a week on the way?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"About that, yes,\" assented Mr. Roumann.\n\n\"And could we go farther than to the moon if we wanted to?\" inquired\nthe bandaged figure mumblingly.\n\n\"Farther? What do you mean?\" asked Professor Henderson quickly.\n\n\"I mean could we go to Mars if we wanted to?\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say you want to go back there, and run the chance of\nbeing attacked by the savage Martians, do you?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"No, I was only asking,\" and the other seemed confused.\n\n\"Well, of course, we _could_ go there, as we have plenty of supplies\nand enough of the Cardite,\" said Mr. Roumann. \"But I think the moon\nwill be the limit of our trip this time.\"\n\nThe work went on, the last things to be put aboard the projectile being\na number of scientific instruments. The injured one wandered in and\nout, now being in the house and again in the big shed. He seemed\nrestless and ill at ease, and frequently he walked to the front gate\nand gazed down the road.\n\n\"You seem to be looking for some one,\" spoke Jack. \"Are you expecting\nyour girl to come along and bid you good-by, Mark?\"\n\n\"Who--me? No, I--I was just looking to see if--if it was going to rain.\"\n\n\"Rain? Well, rain won't make much difference to us soon. We will be\noutside of the earth's atmosphere in a jiffy after we have started, and\nthen rain won't worry us. Is your stateroom all fixed up?\"\n\n\"No, I didn't think of that. Guess I'd better look after it.\"\n\nThe two started together for the projectile. The stout one entered\nfirst, and made his way through the engine room and main cabin to the\ncompartment off which the staterooms opened. He entered one.\n\n\"Here, that's not yours,\" cried Jack. \"That's where Professor Henderson\nsleeps. Yours is next to mine.\"\n\n\"That's right; I forgot,\" mumbled the other. \"I must be getting absent\nminded since my accident. But I'll be all right soon. I'll get my room\nto rights, and then probably we'll start.\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" answered Jack, but he shook his head as he gazed after\nhis chum. \"Mark has certainly changed,\" he murmured. \"I wish he'd take\nthose bandages off, so I could get a look at his face.\"\n\nThe last details were completed. The big _Annihilator_ had been run out\non trucks into the yard surrounding the shed, ready to be hurled\nthrough the air. The shop, shed and house had been locked up and given\nin charge of a caretaker, who would remain on guard until our friends\nreturned.\n\n\"Are we all ready?\" asked Professor Henderson, as he stood ready to\nclose the main entrance door and seal it hermetically.\n\n\"All ready, I guess,\" answered Jack. The stout one had gone to his\nstateroom, where he could be heard moving about.\n\n\"I'm ready,\" announced Professor Roumann. \"Say the word and I'll start\nthe motor.\" He was in the engine room, looking over the machinery. At\nthat moment there came a loud yell from the galley where Washington\nWhite was.\n\n\"Heah, heah! Come back!\" cried the colored man. \"My Shanghai rooster is\ngot loose!\" he yelled, and, an instant later, the fowl came sailing out\nof the projectile, with Washington in full chase after him.\n\n\"I'll help you catch him,\" volunteered Jack, springing to the cook's\naid, while Professor Henderson laughed, and a bandaged figure, looking\nfrom a stateroom port, wondered at the delay in starting the projectile.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nMARK'S ESCAPE\n\n\nMark Sampson was alone in the deserted house. Bound hand and foot,\nstripped of his clothing, and attired in some old garments that the\ntramps who made a hanging-out place of the old mansion had cast aside,\nthe unfortunate lad was stretched on a pile of bagging, his heart\nbeating partly with fear and partly with rage over a desire to escape\nand punish the scoundrel responsible for his plight.\n\nThe man who had captured him, after taking away Mark's clothes, had\nchuckled, as though at some joke.\n\n\"You may think this is funny,\" spoke the lad bitterly, \"but you won't\nbe so pleased when my friends get after you.\"\n\n\"They'll never get after me,\" boasted the man. \"This is a good joke. To\nthink that I can pass myself off as you; that I can join them in the\nprojectile, and they never will be the wiser!\"\n\n\"They'll soon discover that you are disguised as me,\" declared Mark,\n\"and when they do they'll have you arrested.\"\n\n\"Yes, but they'll not discover it until we have left the earth, and are\non our way to the moon. Then it will be too late to turn back, and my\nobject will have been accomplished. I will be with them in the\n_Annihilator_, and I'll have my revenge! The projectile is due to sail\nto-morrow, and I'll be on hand. I'm going to leave you now. I have left\norders with a friend of mine that you are to be released to-morrow\nnight. In the meanwhile you will have to be as comfortable as you can.\nI wish you no harm, but I must keep you here.\n\n\"I will feed you well before I go, and put some water where you can get\nit. But I must leave you tied. I'll not gag you, for, no matter how you\nyell, no one will hear you. I have posted a notice in front of this\nplace that it is under the watch of the police, so no tramps will\nventure in, and your friends will not come back.\n\n\"Now, just make yourself comfortable here, and I'll go to the moon in\nyour place. I think I shall enjoy the trip. As I said, you will be\nreleased to-morrow night, several hours after the projectile has left\nthe earth.\"\n\n\"How do you know it is to start to-morrow morning?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Oh, I have been spying around, and I overheard the professors talking.\nI know a thing or two, and I'll be on hand, on time, in your place!\nNow, I have to leave you. I've left ten dollars to pay for your suit,\nwhich I need to disguise myself with.\"\n\nThen the man was gone, and Mark was left with his bitter thoughts to\nkeep him company. The whole daring scheme of the man had been revealed.\nHe did look something like Mark, and, attired in the lad's clothes, and\nby keeping his face concealed, he might pass himself off as Jack's\nchum; at least, until after the projectile had started.\n\n\"And then, as he says, it will be too late to return to earth and get\nme,\" thought Mark bitterly. \"Oh, why did I ever try to learn this man's\nsecret? Who is he, anyhow? Why didn't I wait for Jack at the barn, as I\npromised? It's all my fault. I wonder if I can't get loose?\"\n\nMark struggled several hours desperately and at last he felt the ropes\ngiving slightly. He redoubled his efforts. Strand by strand the cords\nparted. He put all his efforts into one last attempt, and to his great\njoy he felt his hands separate. He was partly free!\n\nBut scarcely half his task was accomplished. He had yet to discover the\nsecret of the hidden room--a room, as he afterward learned, which had\nbeen built during slavery days to conceal the poor black men who were\nescaping from the South.\n\n\"But now I have my hands to work with!\" exulted Mark.\n\nResting a bit after his strenuous labors, he took a long drink of water\nand attacked the ropes on his feet. They were comparatively easy to\nloosen, and soon he stood up unbound.\n\n\"Now for the secret panel!\" he exclaimed, for he was convinced that it\nwas by some such means that his captor had entered and left. As has\nalready been explained, Mark knew on which side of his prison the\nopening was likely to be--it would be where the warning knocks had\nsounded. He began a minute inspection of that wall.\n\nBut if Mark hoped to speedily discover the secret he was doomed to\ndisappointment. He went over every inch of the surface, seemingly, and\npressed on every depression or projection that met his eye, as he\npassed the candle flame along the wall.\n\nSuccess did not reward him, and, as hour after hour passed, and the\ncandle burned lower and lower, Mark began to despair.\n\n\"I must escape before the projectile leaves,\" he murmured. \"It will\nnever do to let them take that man with them under the impression that\nthey have me. I must escape! I will!\"\n\nOnce more he began the tiresome task of seeking the secret spring. The\ncandle was spluttering in the socket now. It would burn hardly another\nminute. Desperately Mark sought.\n\nAt last, just as the candle gave a dying gasp and flared brightly up\nprior to going out, the lad saw a small screw head he had not noticed\nbefore. It was sunk deep in a board.\n\n\"I'll press that and see what happens!\" he exclaimed.\n\nWith a suddenness that was startling, he found himself in total\ndarkness. The candle had burned out, but he had his finger on the\nscrew. He pressed it with all his force.\n\nThere was a rumbling sound in the darkness, a movement as if some heavy\nbody had slid out of the way, and Mark felt a breath of air on his\ncheeks. Then he saw a dim light.\n\n\"Oh, I'm out! I'm out!\" he cried joyously, breathing a prayer of\nthankfulness at his deliverance. \"I'm free! I pushed on the right\nspring, and the panel slid back!\"\n\nHe fairly leaped forward. The morning light was streaming in through\nthe broken windows. He saw himself in the old hall of the mansion, at\nthe head of the stairs, in a sort of anteroom, the mantle of which\napartment had swung aside to give him egress from the secret chamber\nthrough a hole in the wall. He was free!\n\n\"But am I in time?\" he cried. \"It is morning--and about ten o'clock, I\nshould judge. I've been working to get free all night. Will I be in\ntime?\"\n\nHe gave one last look behind at his prison and sprang down the rickety\nstairs. He had but one thought--to reach home in time to unmask the\nvillain who was impersonating him--to be in time to make the journey to\nthe moon.\n\n\"But it's several miles, and I can't walk very fast,\" murmured Mark.\n\"I'm too stiff and weak. How can I do it?\"\n\nHe thought of making his way to the nearest farm house, and asking for\nthe loan of a horse and carriage, but he looked so much like a tramp\nthat no farmer would lend him a horse.\n\n\"And I need to make speed,\" he murmured.\n\nAt that moment he heard a noise down the road. It was a steady\n\"chug-chug,\" like some distant motor-boat, but there was no water near\nat hand.\n\n\"A motorcycle!\" exclaimed Mark. \"Some one is coming on a motorcycle.\nOh, if I could only borrow it!\"\n\nHe ran down into the road. He could see the rider now. To his joy it\nwas Dick Johnson--the lad who had brought him the mysterious note.\n\n\"Hi Dick! Dick! hold on!\" cried Mark.\n\nThe lad on the motor gave one glance at the ragged figure that had\nhailed him. Then he turned on more power to escape from what he thought\nwas a savage tramp.\n\n\"Wait! Stop! I want that motorcycle!\" cried Mark.\n\n\"Well, you're not going to get it!\" yelled back Dick. \"I'll send the\npolice after you.\"\n\nMark couldn't understand. Then a glance down at his ragged garments\nshowed him what was the matter.\n\n\"Wait! Hold on, Dick!\" he cried, running forward. \"I'm Mark Sampson!\nI've had a terrible time! I was captured by that mysterious man, and\nhe's got my clothes. I must get home quick!\"\n\nDick heard, but scarcely understood. However, he comprehended that his\nfriend was in trouble, and he wanted to help him. He slowed up, and\nMark reached him.\n\n\"Lend me your motorcycle, Dick,\" begged Mark. \"I must get home in a\nhurry to unmask a scoundrel. I'll leave your machine for you at our\nhouse. I won't hurt it. I'm in a hurry! Get off!\"\n\nSomewhat dazed, Dick dismounted, and Mark climbed into the saddle. He\nbegan to pedal, and then threw in the gasolene and spark. The cycle\nchugged off.\n\n\"I'll leave it for you at our house,\" Mark called back. \"I'm going on a\ntrip to the moon, and I don't want to be late.\"\n\nHe was fast disappearing in a cloud of dust, while Dick, gazing after\nhim, remarked:\n\n\"Well, I always thought those fellows were crazy to go off in\nprojectiles and things like that, and now I'm sure of it. Going to the\nmoon! Well, I only hope he doesn't take my motorcycle there!\"\n\nMark sped on, turning the handle levers to get the last notch of speed\nout of the cycle. Would he be in time?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nA DIREFUL THREAT\n\n\nPerhaps Washington White's Shanghai rooster did not care to make the\ntrip to the moon, or perhaps the fowl had not yet seen enough of this\nearth. At any rate, when he flew from the projectile, uttering loud\ncrows, and landed some distance away, he began to run back toward the\ncoop in the rear of the yard.\n\n\"Cotch him, cotch him!\" yelled the colored man. \"Dat's a valuable bird!\"\n\n\"We'll get him when he goes in the coop,\" said Jack, who found it\ndifficult to run and laugh at the same time.\n\n\"Shall I fire my rifle off and scare him?\" asked Andy Sudds.\n\n\"No, you might kill him or scare him t' death,\" objected Washington.\n\n\"Come on, Mark, and help,\" cried Jack, looking toward the projectile,\nwhere a figure was peering from the glass-covered port of the main\ncabin.\n\nBut the figure, whose hand was done up in voluminous bandages, did not\ncome out, and Jack wondered the more at what he thought was a growing\nstrangeness on the part of his chum.\n\nJack, followed by Andy and Washington, raced off after the rooster,\nwhile the two professors, somewhat amused, rather chaffed at the delay.\nBut afterward they were glad of it.\n\n\"Just my luck!\" muttered the bandaged one. \"This delay comes at the\nwrong time. Why don't they go on without that confounded rooster? If we\nstay here too long, that fellow Mark may get loose and spoil the whole\nthing, or Jenkins may go and release him before the time set. It would\nbe just like Jenkins! I've a good notion to start the projectile\nmyself. I know how to operate the Cardite motor. Only I suppose those\ntwo professors are on guard in the engine room. I'll have to wait until\nthey catch that rooster, I guess, but I'd like to wring his neck!\"\n\nThe chase after the fowl was kept up.\n\n\"I've got him now!\" cried Jack a little later, as the fowl, evidently\nnow much exhausted, ran into another fence corner, where Jack caught\nhim, and shut him up in the coop in the projectile.\n\n\"Yo' suttinly am de mos' contrary-minded specimen ob de chicken fambly\ndat I eber seed,\" observed Washington, breathing heavily, for his run\nhad winded him.\n\n\"Well, are we all ready to start now?\" asked Professor Henderson. \"No\nmore live stock loose, is there, Jack?\"\n\n\"I think not.\"\n\n\"Where's Mark? Wasn't he helping you catch the rooster?\"\n\n\"No, he's inside. Shall I seal the door?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I'll tell Professor Roumann that we're about to start. All\nready for the moon trip!\"\n\nJack was pulling the steel portal toward him. An eager face, peering\nfrom a port, waited anxiously for the tremor which would indicate that\nthe projectile had left the earth. In another moment they would be off.\n\nBut what was that sound coming from down the highway. A steady\nchug-chug--a sort of roar, as of a battery of rapid-fire guns going off\nin double relays! And, mingled with the explosions, there was a voice\nshouting:\n\n\"Wait! Hold on! Don't go without me! I'm Mark Sampson! Don't start the\nprojectile!\"\n\n\"Somebody must be in a mighty hurry on a motorcycle,\" thought Jack, as\nhe paused a moment before fastening the door. Then the shouts came to\nhis ears.\n\n\"Mark Sampson!\" he cried.\n\nAgain came the cry: \"Wait! Wait! Don't go without me! You've got that\nmysterious man on board!\"\n\n\"Mark Sampson!\" murmured Jack again. \"That's his voice sure enough! I\nwonder--can it be possible--that man--with his head all bandaged\nup--his queer actions--I--I----\"\n\nWords failed the youth. Throwing wide open the door, he sprang out of\nthe projectile. A moment later there dashed into the yard, where the\ngreat projectile rested, a strange figure astride of a puffing\nmotorcycle. The figure was torn and, ragged, and the nondescript\ngarments were covered with dust, for Mark had had a fall. But there was\nno mistaking the face that peered eagerly forward.\n\n\"Jack!\" cried the youth on the machine.\n\n\"Mark!\" ejaculated the lad who had sprung from the projectile. \"What\nhas happened? Who is the fellow who has been masquerading as you?\"\n\n\"A scoundrel and a villain! Let me get at him!\" and, slamming on the\nbrakes, as he shut off the power, Mark leaped from the motorcycle,\nstood it up against the projectile, and clasped his chum by the hand.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Professor Henderson, as he, too, ran out of\nthe _Annihilator_. \"What does that tramp want, Jack? Give him some\nmoney, and get back in here; we ought to have started long ago.\" He\nlooked at the ragged figure.\n\n\"This isn't a tramp,\" cried Jack. \"It's Mark!\"\n\n\"Mark! I thought----\"\n\n\"There have been strange doings,\" gasped the lad in tramp's garments.\n\"I have just escaped from being kept a prisoner. Where is the\nmysterious man? Oh, I'm glad I arrived in time! Were you about to\nstart?\"\n\n\"That's what we were,\" replied Jack. \"Oh, Mark, but I'm glad to see you\nagain! I didn't know what to think. You acted so strange--or, rather,\nthe fellow we thought was you had me guessing!\"\n\n\"Good land a' massy!\" exclaimed Washington White, as he stood in the\ndoorway, with Andy Sudds behind him. \"Am dere two Marks? What's up,\nanyhow?\"\n\n\"Don't let that fellow get away--the fellow who passed himself off as\nme!\" shouted Mark. \"Lock him up! There's some mystery about him that\nmust be explained. He's a dangerous man to be at large.\"\n\nProfessor Henderson turned back to enter the projectile. Jack advised\nAndy to get his gun ready, with which to threaten the scoundrel in case\nof necessity.\n\nAt that instant there sounded a crash of glass, and the whole front of\nthe big observation window in the side of the _Annihilator_ was smashed\nto atoms. A figure leaped--a figure which no longer had its head\nbandaged, and whose arm was no longer in a sling--the figure of a\nman--the mysterious man who had held Mark a prisoner!\n\n\"There he goes!\" shouted Jack. \"Catch him, somebody! Andy, where's your\ngun?\"\n\n\"I'll have it in a jiffy!\" cried the hunter, as he dashed back to get\nit.\n\nBut the man did not linger. Scrambling to his feet after his fall,\ncaused by his leap from the broken window, which he had smashed with a\nsledge hammer as soon as he understood that his game was up, he raced\nout of the yard. He turned long enough to shake his fist at the group\nassembled around the projectile, and then leaped away, calling out some\nwords which they could not hear.\n\n\"Let's take after him,\" proposed Mark.\n\n\"Come on,\" seconded Jack.\n\n\"No, let him go; he's a desperate man, and you came just in time to\nunmask him,\" said Professor Henderson. \"He might harm you if you took\nafter him. Let him go. He has not done much damage. We can easily\nreplace the broken window. But I can't understand what his object was\nin disguising himself as Mark. He certainly looked like you, Mark,\nespecially when he kept his face concealed. Why did he do it?\"\n\n\"He wanted to go to the moon in my place,\" answered the former prisoner\nof the deserted house.\n\n\"But why?\" insisted Jack.\n\n\"Because, I think, he's crazy, and he didn't really know what he did\nwant. But he certainly had me well concealed,\" spoke Mark. \"I'm free\nnow, however, and as soon as I get some decent clothes on I'll go with\nyou to the moon. I wouldn't want the moon people to see me dressed this\nway.\"\n\n\"How did it happen?\" asked Jack. \"Tell us all about it. My! but I\ncertainly have been puzzled since you--or rather since the person we\nthought was you--came back last night all bunged up. Give us the story.\"\n\n\"I will; give me a chance. I guess that villain is gone for good.\" Andy\nSudds came out with his gun, and insisted on taking a look down the\nroad and around the premises. The man was nowhere in sight.\n\n\"Now we're in for another delay,\" remarked Jack ruefully, as he gazed\nat the smashed window. \"It seems as if we'd never get started for the\nmoon.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, we will,\" declared Professor Henderson. \"We have some extra\nheavy plate glass in the shop, and we can soon put in another\nobservation window.\"\n\n\"Let's get right to work then,\" proposed Jack. \"That man may come back.\nDid you learn who he was, Mark?\"\n\n\"No, he wouldn't tell his name, and he said he was doing this to get\nrevenge on us for some fancied wrong. I can't imagine who he is. But\nlet's work and talk at the same time. I'll tell you all that happened\nto me,\" which he did briefly.\n\nMark soon got rid of the tramp clothes, and donned an extra suit which\nhad been packed in his trunk in the projectile. Then he helped replace\nthe broken window, which, in spite of their haste, took nearly all the\nrest of the day to put in place.\n\n\"Shall we wait and start to-morrow?\" asked Jack, when four o'clock\ncame. \"It will soon be dark.\"\n\n\"Darkness will make no difference to us,\" announced Professor Roumann.\n\"Our Cardite motor will soon take us out of the shadow of the earth,\nand we will be in perpetual sunshine until we reach the moon. As we are\nall ready, we might as well start now.\"\n\nThey all agreed with this, and, after a final inspection of the\nprojectile, the travellers entered it, and Jack was once more about to\nseal the big door.\n\nBefore he could do so there came riding into the yard, on his\nmotorcycle, which he had claimed that afternoon, Dick Johnson.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" he cried. \"I've got a letter for you. It's from that\nman!\"\n\n\"What--another thing to delay us?\" cried Jack, but he called to\nProfessor Roumann not to start the motor, and ran to take from Dick the\nletter which the lad held out.\n\n\"That same man who gave me the one for Mark gave me this, and he paid\nme a half a dollar to bring it here,\" said the boy.\n\n\"All right,\" answered Jack impatiently.\n\nHe looked at the note. It was addressed to the \"Moon Travellers,\" and,\nconsidering that he was one, the youth tore open the envelope. In the\ndim light of the fading day he read the bold handwriting.\n\n\"I have fixed you,\" the letter began. \"You will never get to the moon.\nI shall have my revenge. You took my brother Fred Axtell to Mars and\nleft him there. I determined to get him back, and to that end I\ndisguised myself as one of the boys, and got aboard. When we were\nsafely away from the earth, I would have compelled you to go to Mars\nand rescue my brother. But my plan has failed. I will have my revenge,\nthough. You will never reach the moon, even if you do get started.\nBeware! George, the brother of Fred Axtell, will avenge his fate!\"\n\n\"The brother of the crazy machinist!\" gasped Jack. \"Now I understand\nhis strange actions. He's crazy, too--he wanted to go to Mars--he says\nwe will never reach the moon! Say, look here!\" cried Jack, raising his\nvoice. \"Here's bad news! That scoundrel has put some game up on us!\nMaybe he's tampered with the machinery! It won't be safe to start for\nthe moon until we've looked over everything carefully! He says he's\nfixed us, and perhaps he has!\"\n\nFrom the projectile came hurrying the would-be moon travellers, a vague\nfear in their hearts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nOFF AT LAST\n\n\nIn the gathering twilight Professor Henderson read slowly the note Dick\nhad brought. Then he passed it to Professor Roumann. The latter shook\nhis shaggy gray hair, and murmured something in German.\n\n\"Where did you meet the man?\" asked Jack of the young motorcyclist.\n\n\"About two miles down the road. He was walking along, sort of talking\nto himself, and I was afraid of him. He called to me, and offered me a\nhalf a dollar to deliver this message. I didn't want to at first, but\nhe said if I didn't he'd hurt me, so I took it. Is it anything bad?\"\n\n\"We don't know yet,\" replied Mark.\n\n\"No, that is the worst of it,\" added Professor Roumann. \"He has made a\nthreat, but we can't tell whether or not he will accomplish it. We are\nin the dark. He may have done some secret damage to our machinery, and\nit will take a careful inspection to show it.\"\n\n\"And will the inspection have to be made now?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I think so,\" answered Professor Henderson gravely. \"It would not be\nsafe to start for the moon and have a breakdown before we got there. We\nmust wait until morning to begin our trip.\"\n\n\"It will be the safest,\" spoke the German, and the boys, in spite of\nthe fact that they were anxious to get under way, were forced to the\nsame conclusion.\n\n\"Then if we're going to camp here for the night,\" proposed old Andy,\n\"what's the matter with me and the boys having a hunt for that man?\nWe've put up with enough from him, and it's time he was punished. If we\nlet him go on, he'll annoy us all the while, if not now, then after we\nget back from the moon. I'm for giving him a chase and having him\narrested.\"\n\n\"He certainly deserves some punishment, if only for the way he treated\nMark,\" was Jack's opinion, his chum having related how he was drugged\nand kept a prisoner in the secret room, and how he escaped in time to\nunmask the villain.\n\n\"Well,\" said Professor Henderson, after some thought, \"it might not be\na bad plan to see if you could get that scoundrel put in some safe\nplace, where he could make no more trouble for us. I guess the lunatic\nasylum is where he belongs, though I can sympathize with him on account\nof his brother. But it was not our fault that the crazy machinist went\nwith us to Mars. He was a stowaway, and went against our wishes, and\nwhen he got there he tried to injure us.\"\n\n\"Then may Mark, Andy and I see if we can find this man?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Yes, but be careful not to get separated; and don't run any risks,\"\ncautioned the professor. \"Mr. Roumann and I, with the help of\nWashington, will go carefully over all the machinery, and every part of\nthe projectile, to see if any hidden damage has been done. But don't\nstay out too late. You had better notify the police. They may be able\nto give you some aid, and I don't mind letting them know about it now,\nas we will soon be away from here, because, no matter if they do send\ndetectives or constables spying about now, they can learn none of our\nsecrets.\"\n\nWaiting only to partake of a hasty meal, the two boys and the veteran\nhunter set out, Andy with his gun over his shoulder and his sharp eyes\non the lookout for any sign of Axtell, though they hardly expected to\nfind him in the vicinity of the projectile.\n\nTaking the road, on which Dick Johnson said he had encountered the man,\nthe two lads and Andy proceeded, making inquiries from time to time of\npersons they met. But no one had seen Axtell, and the insane man, for\nsuch he seemed to be, appeared to have dropped out of sight.\n\nOn into the village the searchers went, and there they reported matters\nto the chief of police, telling him only so much as was necessary to\ngive him an understanding of the situation.\n\n\"I'll send a couple of my best constables right out on the case,\" said\nthe chief. \"We've just appointed two new ones, and I guess they'll be\nglad to arrest somebody.\"\n\n\"Let them look out that this fellow doesn't drug them and carry them\naway,\" cautioned Mark.\n\n\"Oh, I guess my constables can look out for theirselves,\" spoke the\nchief proudly.\n\nOnce more the trailers sallied forth to renew their search. They\nthought perhaps they might find their man lingering in the town, but a\nsearch through the principal streets did not disclose him, and Mark\nproposed that they return to their home for the night, as he was tired\nand weary from his experience in the deserted house.\n\nAs they were turning out of the town, their attention was attracted by\na disturbance on the street just ahead of them. A woman screamed, and\nmen's voices were heard. Then came cries of: \"Police! Police!\"\n\n\"Some one's in trouble!\" exclaimed Jack. \"Let's go see what it is.\"\n\nThey broke into a run, and, as they approached, they saw a crowd\nquickly collect. It seemed to center about a man who was being held by\ntwo others, though he struggled to get away.\n\n\"Here, what's the trouble?\" the boys heard a constable ask as he\nshouldered his way into the throng.\n\n\"This fellow tried to snatch this lady's purse and run away with it,\"\nexplained one of the men who had grabbed the scoundrel. \"Stand still,\nyou brute!\" he shouted at him, \"or I'll shake you to pieces! Such\nfellows as you ought to go to the whipping-post!\"\n\n\"I'll take charge of him,\" announced the officer. \"Who is he? Does any\none know?\"\n\n\"Stranger in town, I guess,\" volunteered the other man, who had helped\ncapture him. \"Need any help, officer?\"\n\n\"No, I guess I can manage him. Come along now, and behave yourself, or\nI'll use my club. It hasn't been tried on any one yet.\"\n\n\"That's one of the new constables, I guess,\" said Mark, and Jack nodded.\n\nThe crowd separated to allow the officer to take out his prisoner. As\nthe latter walked forward in the grip of the constable, he remarked in\na mild voice totally at variance with his bold act:\n\n\"Why, I only wanted a little change to pay my fare to the moon. I'm\ngoing there to look for my brother.\"\n\n\"Crazy as a loon,\" said one of the men.\n\n\"Or pretending that he is,\" added the officer.\n\n\"Mark!\" cried Jack, pointing at the prisoner, \"look!\"\n\n\"The man who held me captive!\" gasped Mark. \"And he's wearing my\nclothes yet! But he's in custody now, and we needn't fear any more from\nhim.\"\n\n\"Unless he gets away,\" said Jack.\n\n\"We'll go tell the chief who he is, and he'll keep him safe,\" suggested\nMark, and they hurried to headquarters, reaching there just before the\nprisoner was brought in. The boys were assured by the chief that the\nman, who was evidently a dangerous lunatic, would be kept where he\ncould do no harm. He would be arraigned later on the serious charge of\nattempted highway robbery, as well as of being a dangerous lunatic at\nlarge. When the boys and Andy got back, they found the two professors\nand Washington still going over the machinery in detail.\n\n\"Find anything wrong?\" asked Jack, after they had told of the arrest of\nAxtell.\n\n\"No, but we will have another look in the morning,\" said Mr. Henderson.\n\"Then, if we find nothing out of order, I think we will take a chance\nand start.\"\n\nA thorough inspection by all hands the next day did not disclose\nanything wrong, and, a test of the motors and other machinery having\nshown that it was in good working shape, it was decided to leave the\nearth.\n\n\"At last, I think, we are really going to get under way to the moon,\"\nsaid Jack, as he closed the big main door. This time it was not\nreopened. All the stores and supplies were in place. The two professors\nwere in the engine room. Washington White was in his galley, getting\nready to serve the first meal in the air. Jack and Mark were in the\npilot house, ready to do whatever was necessary and anxious to feel the\nthrill that would tell them the projectile had left the earth.\n\n\"All ready?\" asked Professor Henderson.\n\n\"All ready,\" replied his German assistant.\n\n\"Then here we go!\" announced the aged scientist.\n\nHe pulled toward him the main starting lever of the Cardite motor,\nwhile Professor Roumann opened the valve which admitted to the plates\nand cylinders the mysterious force that was to send them on their way.\n\n\"Elevate the bow!\" called Professor Henderson.\n\n\"Elevated it is,\" answered the German, as he turned a wheel which\ndirected the negative gravity force against the surface of the ground\nand tilted up the nose of the _Annihilator_, as a skyrocket is slanted\nin a trough before the fuse is ignited.\n\n\"Throw over the switch,\" directed Mr. Henderson, and the other\nscientist, with a quick motion, snapped it into place, amid a shower of\nvicious electric sparks that hissed as when hot iron is thrust into\nwater.\n\n\"Steer straight ahead!\" called Professor Henderson to Mark and Jack,\nwho were in the pilot house. \"We'll head for the moon later.\"\n\n\"Straight ahead it is,\" answered Jack.\n\nThere was a trembling to the great projectile. Up rose her\nsharp-pointed bow. She swayed slightly in the air. The trembling\nincreased. The great Cardite motor hummed and throbbed. There was a\ncrackling as from a wireless apparatus.\n\nThen, with a rush and a roar, the big steel car, resembling an enormous\ncigar, soared away from the earth, like some gigantic piece of\nfireworks, and shot toward the sky.\n\n\"We're off!\" shouted Mark.\n\n\"For the moon!\" added Jack.\n\nAnd the _Annihilator_ soared upward and onward, while those in her\nnever dreamed of the fearful adventures that were to befall them ere\nthey would again be headed toward the earth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE SHANGHAI MAKES TROUBLE\n\n\nRemaining in the engine room long enough to see that all the motors and\napparatus were working smoothly, Professor Henderson made his way to\nthe pilot house forward, where Mark and Jack were in charge of the\nsteering gears. The projectile could be started and stopped from there,\nas well as from the engine room, once the motor was set going.\n\n\"Well, boys, how does it feel to be in space once more?\" asked the\nscientist.\n\n\"Fine,\" answered Mark. \"But while I was shut up in that old house I\nfeared I'd never have this chance again.\"\n\n\"It seems like old times again, to be flying through space,\" remarked\nJack. \"My! but we aren't making half the speed of which the projectile\nis capable. Why, we're only going about twenty miles a second,\" and he\nspoke as if that was a mere nothing.\n\n\"Twenty miles is some speed,\" observed Mark.\n\n\"The earth goes around the sun at the rate of nineteen miles a second,\nor about seventy-five times as fast as the swiftest cannon-ball, so you\nsee, Jack, you are 'going some,' as the boys say.\"\n\n\"Yes, but we went much faster when we went to Mars. Still, no matter\nhow fast we travel, you'd never realize it inside here.\"\n\nThis was true. So well balanced was the projectile, and so delicately\npoised was the machinery, that the terrifically fast rate of travel,\nrivalling that of the earth, was no more noticed than we, on this\nglobe, notice our pace of nineteen miles a second around the sun.\n\n\"Everything seems to be all right,\" observed Professor Henderson, as he\nlooked out of the plate-glass window of the pilot house into a sea of\nrolling mist, which represented the ether, for they had soon passed\nthrough the atmosphere of the earth, which scientists estimate to be\ntwo hundred miles in thickness.\n\n\"Are we going to move any faster than this?\" asked Jack, who seemed\npossessed of a speed mania.\n\n\"Not right away,\" replied Mr. Henderson. \"Professor Roumann wants to\nthoroughly test the Cardite motor first. Then, when he finds that it\nworks all right, we may go faster. But we will be at the moon soon\nenough as it is. It is time we headed more directly on our proper way,\nthough, so I think I will ask Mr. Roumann to step here and aid me in\ngetting the projectile on the right course. You boys had better remain\nalso and learn how it is done. You may need to know some time.\"\n\n\"I'll call the professor here, if he can leave the engine room,\" said\nMark, and he found the German bending over some complicated apparatus.\nThe scientist announced that the machines would run themselves\nautomatically for a while, so he accompanied the lad back to the\npilot-house.\n\nThere, consulting big charts of the heavens, and by making some\nintricate calculations, which the boys partly understood, the German\nand Mr. Henderson were able to locate the exact position of the moon,\nthough that body was not then in sight, being behind the earth.\n\n\"That ought to bring us there inside of a week,\" announced Mr.\nHenderson, as he fastened the automatic steering apparatus in place.\n\"The projectile will now be held on a straight course, and I hope we\nshall not have to change it.\"\n\n\"Could anything cause us to swerve to one side?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Sure,\" replied Mark. \"Don't you remember how, in the trip to Mars, we\nnearly collided with the comet? If we are in danger of hitting another\none of those things, or even a meteor, we'll steer out of the way,\nwon't we?\"\n\n\"Of course. I forgot about that,\" admitted Jack.\n\n\"Yes,\" declared Professor Roumann, \"we'll have to be on the lookout for\nwandering meteors or other stray heavenly bodies. But our instruments\nwill give us timely warning of them. Now, I think we can leave the\nprojectile to herself while I make sure that all the machinery is\nrunning smoothly. You boys may stay here if you like, though there\nisn't much to see.\"\n\nThere wasn't. It was totally unlike taking a trip on earth, where the\never-varying scenery makes a journey pleasant. There was no landscape\nto greet the eye now. It was even unlike a trip in a balloon, for in\nthat sort of air-craft, at least for a time, a glimpse of the earth can\nbe had. Now there was nothing but a white blanket of mist to be seen,\nwhich rolled this way and that. Occasionally it was dispelled, and the\nfull, golden sunlight bathed the projectile. The earth had long since\ndropped out of sight, for it required only a few seconds to put the\n_Annihilator_ high up in a position where even the most intrepid\nballoonist had never ventured.\n\nMark and Jack sat for a few minutes in the pilot-house, looking out\ninto the ether. But they soon tired of seeing absolutely nothing.\n\n\"I wonder what we'll do when we get to the moon?\" asked Jack of his\nchum.\n\n\"Why, I suppose you'll make a dive for a hatful of diamonds, won't you?\nThat is, if you still believe that Martian newspaper account.\"\n\n\"I sure do.\"\n\nThe boys found the two professors busy adjusting some of the delicate\nscientific instruments with which they expected to make observations on\nthe trip, and after they reached the moon.\n\n\"What is your opinion, Professor Roumann, of the temperature at the\nmoon's surface?\" asked Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"I am in two minds about it,\" was the reply. \"A few years ago, I see by\nan astronomy, Lord Rosse inferred from his observations that the\ntemperature rose at its maximum (or about three days after full moon)\nfar above that of boiling water.\"\n\n\"Boiling water!\" ejaculated Mark. \"Wow! That won't be very nice. I\ndon't want to be boiled like a lobster!\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" cautioned Mr. Roumann, with a smile. \"Later, Lord\nRosse's own investigations, and those of Langley, threw some doubts on\nthis. There is said to be no air blanket about the moon, as there is\nabout the earth, so that the moon loses heat as fast as it receives it;\nand it now seems more probable that the temperature never rises above\nthe freezing point of water, just as is the case on our highest\nmountains.\"\n\n\"That's better,\" came from Jack. \"We can stand a low temperature more\neasily than we can to be boiled; eh, Jack?\"\n\n\"Sure. But I don't want to be frozen or boiled either, if I can help\nit. Guess I'll wear my fur suit that we brought back from the North\nPole with us.\"\n\n\"I agree with you, Professor Roumann, about the temperature,\" announced\nMr. Henderson, \"so we must make up our minds to shiver, rather than\nmelt. But we are prepared for that.\"\n\n\"What about there being no air on the moon?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Oh, we can manufacture our own oxygen,\" said Mark. \"We can walk around\nwith an air tank on our shoulders, as we did when we went beneath the\nsurface of the ocean. Now, I guess----\"\n\n\"Dinner am served in de dining car!\" interrupted Washington White, his\nblack face grinning cheerfully. He used to be a waiter in a Pullman,\nand he was proud of it. \"First call fo' dinner!\" he went on. \"Part ob\nit am boiled, part am roasted, laik I done heah yo' talkin' 'bout jest\nnow, an' part am frozed--dat's de ice cream,\" he added hastily, lest\nthere be a mistake about it.\n\n\"Well, that sounds good,\" observed Mark. \"Come on, everybody,\" and he\nled the way to the dining cabin.\n\nThey had not been at the table more than a few minutes, and had begun\non the \"boiled\" part of the meal, which was the soup, when from the\nengine room there came a curious, whining noise, as when an electric\nmotor slows up.\n\n\"What's that?\" cried Professor Henderson, jumping up from his seat in\nalarm.\n\n\"Something wrong in the engine room,\" cried Mr. Roumann.\n\nThe two scientists, followed by the boys, hurried to where the various\npieces of apparatus were sending the projectile forward through space.\nAlready there was an appreciable slackening of speed.\n\n\"The Cardite motor has stopped!\" cried Mr. Roumann. \"Something has\nhappened to it!\"\n\n\"Can it be the result of the damage which that lunatic did?\" asked Mr.\nHenderson.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" spoke Jack. \"If I had him here----\"\n\n\"We are falling!\" shouted Mark, looking at an indicator which marked\ntheir speed and motion.\n\n\"Can't we start some other motor?\" asked Jack.\n\nAt that instant from beneath the now silent Cardite machine there came\na prolonged crow.\n\n\"My Shanghai rooster!\" shouted Washington. \"He am in dar!\"\n\nA second later the rooster scrambled out, scratching vigorously. Grains\nof corn were scattered about. The motor started up again, and the\nprojectile resumed its onward way.\n\n\"The rooster stopped it!\" cried Jack. \"He went under it to get some\ncorn, and he must have deranged one of the levers. Oh, you old\nShanghai, you nearly gave us all heart disease!\"\n\nAnd the rooster crowed louder than before, while his colored owner\n\"shooed\" him out of the engine room. The trouble was over speedily, and\nthe _Annihilator_ was once more speeding toward the moon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\"WILL IT HIT US?\"\n\n\n\"Well, for a trouble-maker, give me a rooster every time,\" spoke Jack,\nas, after an examination of the machinery, it was found that nothing\nwas out of order. \"How do you think it happened, Professor Henderson?\"\n\n\"It never could have happened except in just that way,\" was the reply\nof Mr. Roumann. \"Underneath the motor, where they are supposed to be\nout of all reach, are several self-adjusting levers. They control the\nspeed, and also, by being moved in a certain direction, they will shut\ndown the apparatus. The rooster crawled beneath the machine, an act\nthat I never figured on, for I knew it was too small for any of us to\nreach with our hands or arms, even had we so desired. But the\nShanghai's feathers must have brushed against the levers, and that\nstopped the action of the Cardite motor. However, I'm glad it was no\nworse.\"\n\n\"Yes, let's finish dinner now, if everything is all right,\" proposed\nMark.\n\n\"How did the rooster get in here?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I 'spects dat's my fault,\" answered Washington. \"I took him out ob his\ncoop fo' a little exercise dis mawnin', an' he run in heah.\"\n\n\"That explains it, I think,\" said Mr. Roumann. \"Well, Washington, don't\nlet it happen again. We don't want to be dashed downward through space\nall on account of a rooster.\"\n\n\"No, indeedy; I'll lock him up good an' tight arter dis,\" promised the\ncolored man.\n\nThey resumed the interrupted dinner, discussing the possibility of what\nmight have happened, and congratulating themselves that it did not take\nplace.\n\n\"It certainly seems like old times to be eating while travelling along\nlike a cannon-ball,\" remarked Jack. \"I declare, it gives me an\nappetite!\"\n\n\"You didn't need any,\" retorted his chum. \"But say! maybe things don't\ntaste good to me, after what I got while that fellow Axtell had me a\nprisoner! Jack, I'll have a little more of that cocoanut pie, if you\ndon't mind.\"\n\nJack passed over the pastry, and Mark took a liberal piece. Then\nWashington brought in the ice cream, which was frozen on board by means\nof an ammonia gas apparatus, the invention of Professor Henderson. The\nnovelty of dining as comfortably as at home, yet being thousands of\nmiles above the earth, and, at the same time, speeding along like a\ncannon-ball, did not impress our friends as much as it had during their\ntrip to Mars.\n\n\"Well, we're making a little better time now,\" observed Mark, as he and\nthe others rose from the table and went to the engine room. \"The gauge\nshows that we're making twenty-five miles a second.\"\n\n\"We will soon go much faster,\" announced Professor Roumann. \"I have not\nyet had a chance to test my Cardite motor to its fullest speed, and I\nthink I will do so. I wish to see if it will equal my Etherium machine.\nI'll turn on the power gradually now, and we'll see what happens.\"\n\n\"How fast do you think it ought to send us along?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Oh, perhaps one hundred and twenty-five miles a second. You know we\nwent a hundred miles a second when we headed for Mars. I would not be\nsurprised if we made even one hundred and thirty miles a second with\nthe Cardite.\"\n\n\"Whew! If we ever hit anything going like that!\" exclaimed old Andy\nSudds.\n\n\"We'd go right through it,\" finished Jack fervently. The professor was\nsoon ready for the test. Slowly he shoved over the controlling lever.\nThe Cardite motor hummed more loudly, like some great cat purring.\nLouder snapped the electrical waves. The air vibrated with the enormous\nspeed of the valve wheels, and there was a prickling sensation as the\npower flowed into the positive and negative plates, by which the\nprojectile was moved through space.\n\n\"Watch the hand of the speed indicator, boys,\" directed Professor\nRoumann, \"while Professor Henderson and I manipulate the motor. Call\nout the figures to us, for we must keep our eyes on the valves.\" Slowly\nthe speed indicator hand, which was like that of an automobile\nspeedometer, swept over the dial.\n\n\"Fifty miles a second,\" read off Mark. The two professors shoved the\nlevers over still more.\n\n\"Seventy-five,\" called Jack.\n\n\"Give it a little more of the positive current,\" directed Mr. Roumann.\n\n\"Ninety miles a second,\" read Mark a few moments later.\n\n\"We are creeping up, but we have not yet equalled our former speed,\"\nspoke Mr. Henderson. The motor was fairly whining now, as if in protest.\n\n\"One hundred and five miles,\" announced Jack.\n\n\"Ha! That's some better!\" ejaculated the German. \"I think we shall do\nit.\" Once more he advanced the speed lever a notch.\n\n\"One hundred and thirty!\" fairly shouted Mark. \"We are beating all\nrecords!\"\n\n\"And we will go still farther beyond them!\" cried Mr. Roumann. \"Watch\nthe gauge, boys!\"\n\nTo the last notch went the speed handle. There was a sharp crackling,\nsnapping sound, as if the metal of which the motor was composed was\nstrained to the utmost. Yet it held together.\n\nThe hand of the dial quivered. It hung on the one hundred and thirty\nmark for a second, as if not wanting to leave it, and then the steel\npointer swept slowly on in a circle, past point after point.\n\n\"One hundred and thirty-five--one hundred and forty,\" whispered Jack,\nas if afraid to speak aloud. The two professors did not look up from\nthe motor. They looked at the oil and lubricating cups. Already the\nmain shaft was smoking with the heat of friction.\n\n\"Look! look!\" whispered Mark hoarsely.\n\n\"One hundred and fifty-three miles a second!\" exclaimed Jack. \"You've\ndone it, Professor Roumann!\"\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" spoke the German, with a sigh of satisfaction. \"That is\nfaster than mortal man ever travelled before, and I think no one will\never equal our speed. We have broken all records--even our own. Now I\nwill slow down, but we must do it gradually, so as not to strain the\nmachinery.\"\n\nHe slipped back the speed lever, notch by notch. The hand of the dial\nbegan receding, but it still marked one hundred and twenty miles a\nsecond.\n\nSuddenly, above the roar and hum of the motor, there sounded the voice\nof Andy.\n\n\"Professor!\" he shouted. \"We're heading right toward a big, black\nstone! Is that the moon?\"\n\n\"The moon? No, we are not half way there,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"Are you\nsure, Andy?\"\n\n\"Sure? Yes! I saw it from the window in the pilot-house. We are\nshooting right toward it.\"\n\n\"Look to the motor, and I'll see what it is,\" directed Mr. Henderson to\nhis friend. Followed by the boys, he hurried to the steering tower. His\nworst fears were confirmed.\n\nSpeeding along with a swiftness unrivalled even by some stars, the\nprojectile was lurching toward a great, black heavenly body. \"It's a\nmeteor! An immense meteor!\" cried Professor Henderson, \"and it's coming\nright toward us.\"\n\n\"Will it hit us?\" gasped Mark and Jack together.\n\n\"I don't know. We must try to avoid it. Boys, notify Professor Roumann\nat once. We are in grave danger!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTURNING TURTLE\n\n\nTogether Mark and Jack leaped for the engine room. Their faces showed\nthe fear they felt. Even before they reached it, they realized that, at\nthe awful speed at which they were travelling, and the fearful velocity\nof the meteor, there might be a crash in mid-air which would destroy\nthe projectile and end their lives.\n\n\"I wonder if we can steer clear of it?\" gasped Jack.\n\n\"If it's possible the professor will do it,\" responded his chum.\n\nThe next instant they were in the engine room, where Mr. Roumann was\nbending over the Cardite motor.\n\n\"Shut off the power!\" yelled Jack.\n\n\"We are going to hit a meteor!\" gasped Mark.\n\nThe German looked up with a startled glance.\n\n\"Slow down?\" he repeated. \"It is impossible to slow down at once! We\nare going ninety miles a second!\" He pointed to the speed gauge.\n\n\"Then there's going to be a fearful collision!\" cried Jack, and he\nblurted out the fact of the nearness of the heavenly wanderer.\n\n\"So!\" exclaimed Professor Roumann. \"Dot is bat! ferry bat!\" and he\nlapsed into the broken language that seldom marked his almost perfect\nEnglish. Then, murmuring something in his own tongue, he leaped away\nfrom the motor, calling to the boys:\n\n\"Slow it down gradually! Keep pulling the speed lever toward you! I\nwill set in motion the repelling apparatus and go to help Professor\nHenderson steer out of the way. It is our only chance!\"\n\nMark and Jack took their places beside the Cardite motor, which was\nstill keeping up a fearful speed, though not so fast as at first. To\nstop it suddenly would mean that the cessation of strain could not all\nbe diffused at once, and serious damage might result.\n\nThe only way was to come gradually down to the former speed, and, while\nMark kept his eyes on the indicator, Jack pulled the lever toward him,\nnotch by notch.\n\n\"She's down to seventy-five miles a second,\" whispered Mark. They were\nas anxious now to reduce speed as they had been before to increase it.\n\nMeanwhile Professor Roumann had set in motion a curious bit of\napparatus, designed to repel stray meteors or detached bits of comets.\nAs is well known, bodies floating in space, away from the attraction of\ngravitation, attract or repel each other as does a magnet or an\nelectrically charged object.\n\nActing on this law of nature, Professor Roumann had, with the aid of\nMr. Henderson, constructed a machine which, when a negative current of\nelectricity was sent into it, would force away any object that was\napproaching the _Annihilator_. In a few moments the boys at the Cardite\nmotor heard the hum, the throb and crackling that told them that the\nrepelling apparatus was at work.\n\nBut would it act in time? Or would the meteor prove too powerful for\nit? And, if it did, would the two scientists be able to steer the\nswiftly moving projectile out of the way of the big, black stone, as\nthe old hunter called it?\n\nThese were questions that showed on the faces of the two lads as they\nbent over the motor.\n\n\"We're only going fifty miles a second now,\" whispered Jack.\n\nMark nodded his head. \"Can't you pull the lever over faster?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't dare,\" replied his chum. There was nothing to do but to wait\nand gradually slow up the projectile as much as possible. The boys\ncould hear the professors in the pilothouse shifting gears, valves and\nlevers to change the course of the projectile. Andy Sudds and\nWashington White, with fear on their faces, looked into the engine\nroom, waiting anxiously for the outcome.\n\n\"Hab--hab we hit it yet?\" asked Washington, moving his hands nervously.\n\n\"I reckon not, or we'd know it,\" said the hunter.\n\n\"No, not yet,\" answered Jack, in a low voice. \"How much are we making\nnow, Mark?\"\n\n\"Only thirty a second.\"\n\n\"Good! She's coming down.\"\n\nHardly had he spoken than there sounded a noise like thunder, or the\nrushing of some mighty wind. The projectile, which was trembling\nthroughout her length from the force of the motor, shivered as though\nshe had plunged into the unknown depths of some mighty sea. The roaring\nincreased. Mark and Jack looked at each other. Washington White fell\nupon his knees and began praying in a loud voice. Old Andy grasped his\ngun, as though to say that, even though on the brink of eternity, he\nwas ready.\n\nThen, with a scream as of some gigantic shell from a thousand-inch\nrifle, something passed over the _Annihilator_; something that shook\nthe great projectile like a leaf in the wind. And then the scream died\naway, and there was silence. For a moment no one spoke, and then Jack\nwhispered hoarsely:\n\n\"We've passed it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" added Mark, \"we're safe now.\"\n\n\"By golly! I knowed we would!\" fairly yelled Washington, leaping to his\nfeet. \"I knowed dat no old meteor could kerflumox us! Perfesser\nHenderson he done jumped our boat ober it laik a hunter jumps his boss\nober a fence. Golly! I'se feelin' better now!\"\n\n\"How did you avoid it?\" asked Mark of the professor.\n\n\"With the help of the repelling machine and by changing our course. But\nwe did it only just in time. It was an immense meteor, much larger than\nat first appeared, and it was blazing hot. Had it struck us, there\nwould have been nothing left of us or the projectile either but star\ndust. But we managed to pass beneath it, and now we are safe.\"\n\nThey congratulated each other on their lucky escape, and then busied\nthemselves about various duties aboard the air-craft. The rest of the\nday was spent in making minor adjustments to some of the machines,\noiling others, and in planning what they would do when they reached the\nmoon.\n\nIn this way three days and nights passed, mainly without incident. They\nslept well on board the _Annihilator_, which was speeding so swiftly\nthrough space--slept as comfortably as they had on earth. Each hour\nbrought them nearer the moon, and they figured on landing on the\nsurface of that wonderful and weird body in about three days more.\n\nIt was on the morning of the fourth day when, as Mark and Jack were\ntaking their shift in the engine room, that Jack happened to glance\nfrom the side observation window, which was near the Cardite motor.\nWhat he saw caused him to cry out in surprise.\n\n\"I say, Mark, look here! There's the moon over there. We're not heading\nfor it at all!\"\n\n\"By Jove! You're right!\" agreed his chum. \"We're off our course!\"\n\n\"We must tell Professor Henderson!\" cried Jack. \"I'll do it. You stay\nhere and watch things.\"\n\nA few seconds later a very much alarmed youth was rapidly talking to\nthe two scientists, who were in the pilot-house.\n\n\"Some unknown force must have pulled us off our course,\" Jack was\nsaying. \"The moon is away off to one side of us.\"\n\nTo his surprise, instead of being alarmed, Mr. Roumann only smiled.\n\n\"It's true,\" insisted Jack.\n\n\"Of course, it is,\" agreed Mr. Henderson. \"We can see it from here,\nJack,\" and he pointed to the observation window, from which could be\nnoticed the moon floating in the sky at the same time the sun was\nshining, a phenomenon which is often visible on the earth early in the\nmorning at certain of the moon's phases.\n\n\"Will we ever get there?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Mr. Roumann. \"You must remember, Jack, that the\nmoon is moving at the same time we are. Had I headed the projectile for\nLuna, and kept it on that course, she would, by the time we reached\nher, been in another part of the firmament, and we would have overshot\nour mark. So, instead, I aimed the _Annihilator_ at a spot in the\nheavens where I calculated the moon would be when we arrived there.\nAnd, if I am not mistaken, we will reach there at the same time, and\ndrop gently down on Luna.\"\n\n\"Oh, is that it?\" asked the lad, much relieved.\n\n\"That's it,\" replied Mr. Henderson. \"And that's why we seem to be\nheaded away from the moon. Her motion will bring her into the right\nposition for us to land on when the time comes.\"\n\n\"Then I'd better go tell Mark,\" said the lad. \"He's quite worried.\" He\nsoon explained matters to his chum, and together they discussed the\nmany things necessary to keep in mind when one navigates the heavens.\n\nThat day saw several thousand more miles reeled off on the journey to\nthe moon, and that evening (or rather what corresponded to evening, for\nit was perpetual daylight) they began to make their preparations for\nlanding. Their wonderful journey through space was nearing an end.\n\n\"I guess that crazy Axtell fellow was only joking when he said we'd\nnever reach the moon,\" ventured Jack. \"Nothing has happened yet.\"\n\n\"Only the meteor,\" said Mark, \"and he couldn't know about that. I guess\nhe didn't get a chance to damage any of the machinery.\"\n\n\"No, we seem to be making good time,\" went on his chum. \"I think I'll\ngo and----\"\n\nJack did not finish his sentence. Instead he stared at one of the\ninstruments hanging from the walls of the engine room. It was a sort of\nbarometer to tell their distance from the earth, and it swung to and\nfro like a pendulum. Now the instrument was swinging out away from the\nwall to which it was attached. Further and further over it inclined.\nJack felt a curious sensation. Mark put his hand to his head.\n\n\"I feel--feel dizzy!\" he exclaimed. \"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"Something has happened,\" cried Jack.\n\nThe instrument swung over still more. Some tools fell from a work\nbench, and landed on the steel floor with a crash. The boys were\nstaggering about the engine room, unable to maintain their balance.\n\nThere came cries of fear from the galley, where Washington White was\nrattling away amid his pots and pans. Andy Sudds was calling to some\none, and from the pilot-house came the excited exclamations of\nProfessors Henderson and Roumann.\n\n\"We're turning turtle!\" suddenly yelled Jack. \"The projectile is\nturning over in the air! Something has gone wrong! Perhaps this is the\nrevenge of that crazy man!\" and, as he spoke, he fell over backward,\nMark following him, while the _Annihilator_ was turned completely over\nand seemed to be falling down into unfathomable depths.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nAT THE MOON\n\n\nConfusion reigned aboard the _Annihilator_. It had turned completely\nover, and was now moving through space apparently bottom side up. Of\ncourse, being cigar shaped, this did not make any difference as far as\nthe exterior was concerned, but it did make a great difference to those\nwithin.\n\nThe occupants of the great shell had fallen and slid down the rounded\nsides of the projectile, and were now standing on what had been the\nceiling. Objects that were not fast had also followed them, scattering\nall about, some narrowly missing hitting our friends. Of course, the\nmachinery was now in the air, over the heads of the travellers.\n\nThis was one of the most serious phases of the accident, for the great\nCardite motor was built to run while in the other position, and when it\nwas turned upside down it immediately stopped, and the projectile,\ndeprived of its motive power, at once began falling through space.\n\n\"What has happened? What caused it?\" cried Mark, as he crawled over to\nwhere Jack sat on the ceiling, with a dazed look on his face.\n\n\"I don't know. Something went wrong. Here comes Professor Henderson and\nMr. Roumann. We'll ask them.\"\n\nThe two scientists were observed approaching from the pilot-house. They\nwalked along what had been the ceiling, and when they came to the\nengine room they had to climb over the top part of the door frame.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Our center of gravity has become displaced,\" answered Mr. Henderson.\n\"The gravity machine has either broken, or some one has been tampering\nwith it. Did either of you boys touch it?\"\n\n\"No, indeed!\" cried Mark, and his chum echoed his words.\n\n\"I wonder if Washington could have meddled with it?\" went on the\nscientist.\n\nAt that moment the colored cook came along, making his way cautiously\ninto the engine room. He was an odd sight. Bits of carrots, turnips and\npotatoes were in his hair, while from one ear dangled a bunch of\nmacaroni, and his clothes were dripping wet.\n\n\"My kitchen done turned upside down on me!\" wailed Washington, \"an' a\nwhole kettle ob soup emptied on my head! Oh, golly! What happened?\"\n\nThe aged scientist looked toward the German. The latter was gazing up\nat the motionless Cardite motor over his head.\n\n\"There is but one way,\" he answered. \"We must restore our centre of\ngravity to where it was before. Then the projectile will right herself.\"\n\n\"Can it be done?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"It will be quite an undertaking, but we must attempt it. Bring some\ntables and chairs, so I can stand up and reach the equilibrium machine.\"\n\nFrom where they had fallen to the ceiling, which was now the floor,\nJack and Mark brought tables and chairs, and made a sort of stepladder.\nOn this Professor Roumann mounted, and at once began the readjusting of\nthe centre of gravity.\n\nIt was hard work, for he had to labor with his arms stretched up in the\nair, and any one who has even put up pictures knows what that means.\nThe muscles are unaccustomed to the strain. The German scientist,\nthough a strong man, had to rest at frequent intervals.\n\n\"We're falling rapidly,\" announced Jack, in a low voice, as he looked\nat the height gauge.\n\n\"I am doing all I can,\" answered Mr. Roumann. \"I think I will soon be\nable to right the craft.\"\n\nHe labored desperately, but he was at a disadvantage, for the\n_Annihilator_ was not now moving smoothly through space. With the\nstopping of the motor she was falling like some wobbly balloon, swaying\nhither and thither in the ether currents.\n\nBut Professor Roumann was not one to give up easily. He kept at his\ntask, aided occasionally by Professor Henderson and by the boys\nwhenever they could do anything.\n\nFinally the German cried out:\n\n\"Ah, I have discovered the trouble. It is that scoundrel Axtell! See!\"\nAnd reaching into the interior of the machine he pulled out a small\nmagnet. To it was attached a card, on which was written:\n\n\"I told you I would have my revenge!\" It was signed with Axtell's name.\n\n\"This was the dastardly plot he evolved,\" said Professor Roumann. \"He\nslipped this magnet into the equilibrium machine, knowing that in time\nit would cause a deflection of the delicate needles, and so shift the\ncentre of gravity. He must have done this as a last resort, and to\nprovide for his revenge in case we discovered him on board after we\nstarted. It was a cruel revenge, for had I not discovered it we would\nsoon all be killed.\"\n\n\"Is the machine all right now?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"It will be in a few minutes. Here, take this magnet and put it as far\naway from the engine room as possible.\"\n\nIt was the work of but a few minutes, now that the disturbing element\nwas removed, to readjust the gravity machine, and Mr. Roumann called:\n\n\"Look out, now, everybody! We're going to turn right side up again!\"\n\nAs he spoke he turned a small valve wheel. There was a clanging of\nheavy ballast weights, which slid down their rods to the proper places.\nThen, like some great fish turning over in the water, the _Annihilator_\nturned over in the ether, and was once more on her proper keel, if such\na shaped craft can be said to have a keel.\n\nOf course, the occupants of the space ship went slipping and sliding\nback, even as they had fallen ceilingward before, but they were\nprepared for it, and no one was hurt. From the galley came a chorus of\ncries, as pots and pans once more scattered about Washington, but there\nwas no more soup to spill.\n\nAs soon as the _Annihilator_ was righted, the Cardite motor began to\nwork automatically, and once more the projectile, with the seekers of\nthe moon, was shooting through space at their former speed. They had\nlost considerable distance, but it was easy to make it up.\n\n\"Well, that _was_ an experience,\" remarked Jack, as he and his chum\nbegan picking up the tools and other objects that were scattered all\nabout by the change in equilibrium.\n\n\"I should say yes,\" agreed Mark. \"I'm glad it didn't happen at dinner\ntime. That fellow Axtell is a fiend to think of such a thing.\"\n\n\"Indeed, he is! But we're all right now, though it did feel funny to be\nturned upside down.\"\n\nAn inspection of the projectile was made, but they could discover no\nparticular damage done. She seemed to be moving along the same as\nbefore, and, except for the upsetting of things in the store-room, it\nwould hardly have been known, an hour later, that a dreadful accident\nwas narrowly averted.\n\nWashington made more soup, and soon had a fine meal ready, over which\nthe travellers discussed their recent experience.\n\n\"And when do you think we will arrive?\" asked Jack of Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"We ought to be at the moon inside of two days now. We have not made\nquite the speed we calculated on, but that does not matter. I think we\nwill go even more slowly on the remainder of the trip, as I wish to\ntake some scientific observations.\"\n\n\"Yes, and so do I,\" added Mr. Roumann. \"I think if we make fifteen\nmiles a second from now on we will be moving fast enough.\"\n\nAccordingly the Cardite motor was slowed down, and the projectile shot\nthrough space at slightly reduced speed, while the two scientists made\nseveral observations, and did some intricate calculating about ether\npressure, the distance of heavenly bodies and other matters of interest\nonly to themselves.\n\nIt was on the afternoon of the third day following the turning turtle\nof the _Annihilator_ that Mark, who was looking through a telescope in\nthe pilot-house, called out: \"I say, Jack, look here!\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked his chum.\n\n\"Why, we're rushing right at the moon! I can see the mountains and\ncraters on it as plain as though we were but five miles away!\"\n\n\"Then we must be nearly there,\" observed Jack. \"Let's tell the others,\nMark.\"\n\nThey hurried to inform the two professors, who at once left their\ntables of figures and entered the steering chamber. Then, after gazing\nthrough the glass, Mr. Henderson announced: \"Friends, we will land on\nthe moon in half an hour. Get ready.\"\n\n\"Are we really going to be walking around the moon inside of thirty\nminutes?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"I don't know about walking around on it,\" answered the German. \"We\nfirst have to see if there is an atmosphere there for us to breathe,\nand whether the temperature is such as we can stand. But the\nAnnihilator will soon be there.\"\n\nThe speed of the Cardite motor was increased, and so rapidly did the\nprojectile approach Luna that glasses were no longer needed to\ndistinguish the surface of the moon.\n\nThere she floated in space, a great, silent ball, but not like the\nearth, pleasantly green, with lakes and rivers scattered about in\nverdant forests. No, for the moon presented a desolate surface to the\ngaze of the travellers. Great, rugged mountain peaks arose all about\nimmense caverns that seemed hundreds of miles deep. The surface was\ncracked and seamed, as if by a moonquake. Silence and terrible\nloneliness seemed to confront them.\n\n\"Maybe it's better on some other part of the surface,\" said Jack, in a\nlow voice.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" agreed Mark. \"It's certainly not inviting there.\"\n\nNearer and nearer they came to the moon. It no longer looked like a\ngreat sphere, for they were so close that their vision could only take\nin part of the surface, and it began to flatten out, as the earth does\nto a balloonist.\n\nAnd the nearer they came to it the more rugged, the more terrible, the\nmore desolate did it appear. Would they be able to find a place to\nland, or would they go hurtling down into some awful crater, or be\ndashed upon the sharp peak of some mountain of the moon?\n\nIt was a momentous question, and anxious were the faces of the two\nprofessors.\n\n\"Mr. Henderson, if you will undertake to steer to some level place, I\nwill take charge of the motor,\" suggested Mr. Roumann. \"I will\ngradually reduce the speed, and get the repelling machine in readiness,\nso as to render our landing gentle.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" responded the aged scientist, as he grasped the steering\nwheel.\n\nThe progress of the _Annihilator_ was gradually checked. More and more\nslowly it approached the moon. The mountains seemed even higher now,\nand the craters deeper.\n\n\"What a terrible place,\" murmured Jack. \"I shouldn't want to live\nthere.\"\n\n\"Me either,\" said Mark.\n\n\"Can you see a place to land?\" called Professor Roumann through the\nspeaking-tube from the engine room to the steering tower.\n\n\"Yes, we seem to be approaching a fairly level plateau,\" was Mr.\nHenderson's reply.\n\n\"Very well, then, I'll start the repelling machine.\"\n\nThe Cardite motor was stopped. The projectile was now being drawn\ntoward the moon by the gravity force of the dead ball that once had\nbeen a world like ours. Slowly and more slowly moved the great\nprojectile.\n\nThere was a moment of suspense. Mr. Henderson threw over the steering\nwheel. The _Annihilator_ moved more slowly. Then came a gentle shock.\nThe dishes in the galley rattled, and there was the clank of machinery.\nThe Shanghai rooster crowed.\n\n\"We're on the moon at last!\" cried jack, peering from an observation\nwindow at the rugged surface outside.\n\n\"Yes; and now to see what it's like,\" added Mark. \"We'll go outside,\nand----\"\n\n\"Wait,\" cautioned Professor Roumann. \"First we must see if we can\nbreathe on the moon, and whether the temperature will support life. I\nmust make some tests before we venture out of the projectile.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTORCHES OF LIFE\n\n\nThe natural inclination of the boys to rush out on the surface of the\nmoon to see what it was like was checked by the words of caution from\nProfessor Roumann.\n\n\"Do you think it would be dangerous to venture outside the projectile?\"\nasked Jack, as he looked from the window and noted the rugged, uneven\nsurface of the moon.\n\n\"Very much so,\" was the answer. \"According to most astronomers, there\nis absolutely no air on the moon, also no moisture, and the temperature\nis either very high or around the freezing point. We must find out what\nit is.\"\n\n\"How can we?\" inquired Mark.\n\n\"I'll soon show you,\" went on the German. \"Professor Henderson, will\nyou kindly assist me.\"\n\nWhen it had been decided to come to the moon in quest for the field of\ndiamonds, certain changes had been made in the _Annihilator_ to fit it\nfor new conditions that might be met. One of these consisted of an\naperture in the two sides of the projectile permitting certain delicate\ninstruments to be thrust out, so that the conditions they indicated\ncould be read on dials or graduated scales from within.\n\n\"We will first make a test of the temperature,\" said Mr. Roumann, \"as\nthat will be the easiest.\" Accordingly a thermometer was put outside,\nand those in the air-craft anxiously watched the red column of spirits.\nThe temperature was marked as seventy-five inside the _Annihilator_,\nbut the thermometer had not been outside more than a second before it\nbegan falling.\n\n\"Good!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson, as he noted it. \"The temperature is\ngoing down. I'd rather have it too cold than too hot. We can stand a\nminus fifty of cold better than two hundred and twelve of heat. We have\nfur garments with us.\"\n\n\"It is still going down,\" remarked Jack, as he saw the red column drop\ndown past the thirty mark.\n\n\"Below freezing,\" added Mark.\n\nThe spirits fell in the tube until they touched twenty-eight degrees,\nand there they remained.\n\n\"Twenty-eight degrees,\" remarked Professor Henderson. \"That isn't so\nbad. At least, we can stand that if we are warmly clad.\"\n\n\"Yes, but it will be colder to-night,\" said Jack. For they had landed\non the moon in bright sunlight.\n\n\"To-night?\" questioned the German scientist, with a smile.\n\n\"Yes, it's always colder when the sun goes down,\" went on the lad.\n\n\"You have forgotten one thing,\" said Mr. Henderson, with a smile at his\nyoung prot\u00e9g\u00e9. \"You must remember, Jack, that the nights and days here\nare each fourteen days long--that is, fourteen of our days.\"\n\n\"How's that?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Why,\" broke in Mark, who was a trifle better student than was his\nchum, \"don't you remember that the moon rotates on its axis once a\nmonth, or in about twenty-eight days, to be exact, and so half of that\ntime is day and half night, just as on our earth, when it revolves on\nits axis in twenty-four hours, half the time is day and half the time\nis night.\"\n\n\"Sure, I ought to have remembered,\" declared Jack.\n\n\"Mark is right,\" added Mr. Henderson. \"And, as we have most fortunately\narrived on the moon at the beginning of the long day, we will have\nfourteen days of sunshine, during which we may expect the temperature\nto remain at about twenty-eight degrees. But now about the atmosphere.\"\n\"We will test that directly,\" went on the German. \"It will take some\ntime longer, though.\"\n\nVarious instruments were brought forth and thrust out of the opening in\nthe side of the projectile, which opening was so arranged that it was\nclosed hermetically while the instruments were put forth. Then the\nreadings of the dials or scales were taken, and computations made. In\nfact, some of what corresponded to the moon's atmosphere was secured in\na hollow steel cup and brought inside the _Annihilator_ for analysis.\n\n\"Well,\" remarked Professor Roumann, as he bent over a test tube, the\ncontents of which he had put through several processes, \"I am afraid we\ncannot breathe on the moon.\"\n\n\"Can't breathe on it?\" gasped Jack. \"Then we can't go out and walk\naround it.\"\n\n\"I didn't say that,\" resumed the German, with a smile. \"I said we\ncouldn't breathe the moon's atmosphere. In fact there is nothing there\nthat we would call atmosphere. There is absolutely no oxygen, and there\nare a number of poisonous gases that would instantly cause death if\ninhaled.\"\n\n\"Then how are we to get out and hunt for those diamonds, Professor?\"\nwent on Jack. \"Gee whiz! if I'd known that, I wouldn't have come. This\nis tough luck!\"\n\n\"Maybe the professor can suggest a way out of the difficulty, boys,\"\nspoke Mr. Henderson. \"It certainly would be too bad if, after our\nperilous trip, we couldn't get out of our cage and walk around the\nmoon.\"\n\n\"I think perhaps I can discover a way so that it will be safe to\nventure forth,\" said Mr. Roumann. \"But I must first conduct some\nfurther experiments. In the meanwhile suppose you boys get out some\nfur-lined garments, for, though it is only twenty-eight degrees, we\nwill need to be well clad after the time spent inside this warm\nprojectile.\"\n\n\"It does look as if he expected to get us out,\" remarked Jack, as he\nand his chum went to where Andy Sudds was.\n\n\"Yes, you'll get a chance to pick up diamonds after all, Jack. That is,\nif there are any here.\"\n\n\"Of course there are diamonds. You wait and see,\" and then, with the\nhelp of the old hunter, they took from the store-room their fur\ngarments.\n\nIt was half an hour before the warm clothes were sorted out, and then\nthe boys went back to where the two professors were.\n\n\"Well,\" asked Jack cautiously, \"can we go outside?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" answered the German cheerfully. \"But you must always be\ncareful to carry one of these with you,\" and he handed to each of the\nboys a steel rod about two feet long, at the end of which was a small\niron box, with perforations in the sides and top.\n\n\"What is this?\" asked Jack. \"It looks like a magician's wand.\"\n\n\"And that is exactly what it is,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"As there is no\natmosphere fit to breathe on the moon, we have been forced to make our\nown, boys. You each hold what may be called torches of life. To venture\nout without them would mean instant death by suffocation or poison.\"\n\n\"And will these save our lives?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Roumann. \"In the iron boxes on those rods are certain\nchemicals, rich in oxygen and other elements, which, when brought in\ncontact with the gases on the moon, will dispel a cloud of air about\nwhoever carries them--air such as we find on our earth. So, boys, be\ncareful never to venture out without the torches of life. I had them\nprepared in anticipation of some such emergency as this, and all that\nwas necessary was to put in the chemicals. This I have done, and now,\nif you wish, you may go out and stroll about the moon.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nON THE EDGE OF A CRATER\n\n\nThere was a little hesitation after Professor Roumann had spoken. Even\nthough he assured them all that it would be safe to venture out on the\nsurface of the moon, with its chilling temperature and its poisonous\n\"atmosphere\" (if such it can be termed), there was an uncanny feeling\nabout stepping forth into the midst of the desolation that was on every\nside.\n\nFor it was desolate--terribly so! Not a sound broke the stillness.\nThere was no life--no motion--as far as could be seen. Not a tree or\nshrub relieved the rugged monotony of the landscape. It was like a dead\nworld.\n\n\"And to think that people may have once lived here,\" observed Jack, in\na low voice.\n\n\"Yes, and to think that there may be people on the other side of the\nmoon even now,\" added Mark. \"We must take a look if it's possible.\"\n\n\"Well,\" remarked Mr. Henderson, after a while, \"are we going out and\nsee what it's like or not.\"\n\n\"Of course, we are,\" said Jack. \"Come on, Mark, I'm not afraid.\"\n\n\"Me either. Do we have to do anything to the torches to make them\noperate, Professor Roumann?\"\n\n\"Merely press this lever,\" and the scientist showed them where there\nwas one in the handle of the steel rod. \"As soon as that is pressed, it\nadmits a liquid to the chemicals and the oxygen gas is formed, rising\nall around you, like a protecting vapor. After that it is automatic.\"\n\n\"How long will the supply of chemical last?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"Each one is calculated to give out gas for nearly two weeks,\" was the\nreply; \"possibly for a little longer. But come, I want to see how they\nwork. Here is your life-torch, Professor Henderson, and there is one\nfor you, too, Andy, and Washington.\"\n\n\"'Scuse me!\" exclaimed the colored man hastily, as he started back\ntoward the kitchen.\n\n\"Why, what's the matter?\" asked Jack. \"Don't you want to go out, and\nwalk around the moon, and pick up diamonds?\"\n\n\"Diamonds am all right,\" answered Washington, \"but I jest done fo'got\ndat I ain't fed my Shanghai rooster to-day, an' I 'spects he's mighty\nhungry. You folks go on out an' pick up a few obde sparklers, an' when\nI gits de Shanghai fed I'll prognosticate myse'f inter conjunction wif\nyo' all.\"\n\n\"You mean you'll join us?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Dat's what I means, suah.\"\n\n\"Why, I do believe Washington's afraid!\" cried Jack jokingly.\n\n\"Askeered! Who's afraid?\" retorted the colored man boldly. \"Didn't I\ndone tole yo' dat I got t' feed my rooster? Heah him crowin' now? Yo'\nall go 'long, an' I'll meet yo' later,\" and with that Washington\ndisappeared quickly.\n\n\"Well, he'll soon pluck up courage and come out,\" declared Professor\nHenderson. \"Let him go now, and we'll go out and see what it is like on\nthe moon.\"\n\n\"I hope we find those diamonds,\" murmured Jack, and Mark smiled.\n\nIn order not to admit the poisonous gases into the projectile, it was\ndecided to leave the Annihilator and return to it by means of a double\ndoor, forming a sort of air lock. It was similar to the water lock used\non the submarine. That is, the adventurers entered a chamber built in\nbetween the two steel walls of their craft. The interior door was then\nsealed shut automatically. Next the outer door was opened, and they\ncould step directly to the surface of the moon and into the deadly\natmosphere.\n\n\"Well, are we all ready?\" asked Mr. Roumann, as he picked up one of the\nchemical torches.\n\n\"I guess so,\" responded Andy Sudds, who had his gun with him. \"I hope I\nsee some game. I haven't had a shot in a long while.\"\n\n\"You're not likely to up here,\" spoke Mr. Henderson. \"Game is scarce on\nthe moon, unless it's some of that green cheese Washington talked\nabout.\"\n\nThey entered the air lock and fastened the door behind them. Then\nProfessor Roumann pressed on the lever that swung open the outer portal.\n\n\"Hold your torches close to your head,\" he called. \"The moon atmosphere\nmay be too strong for us at first until we create a mist of oxygen\nabout us.\"\n\nOut upon the surface of the moon they stepped, probably the first earth\nbeings so to do, though they had evidence that the inhabitants of Mars\nhad preceded them.\n\nFor a moment they all gasped for breath, but only for a moment. Then\nthe gas began to flow from the life-torches, and they could breathe as\nwell as they had done while in the projectile, or while on the earth.\n\n\"Well, if this isn't great!\" cried Jack, gazing about him.\n\n\"It certainly beats anything I ever saw,\" came from Mark.\n\n\"Wonderful, wonderful,\" murmured Professor Henderson. \"We will be able\nto gain much valuable scientific knowledge here, Professor Roumann. We\nmust at once begin our observations.\"\n\n\"I agree with you,\" spoke the German.\n\nAndy Sudds said nothing. He was looking around for a sight of game,\nwith his rifle in readiness. But not a sign of life met his eager eyes.\n\nOnce they were outside the projectile it was even more desolate than it\nhad seemed when they looked from the observation windows. It was\nabsolutely still. Not a breath of wind fanned their cheeks, for where\nthere is no air to be heated and cooled there could be no wind which is\ncaused by the differences of temperature of the air, the cold rushing\nin to fill the vacuum caused by the rising of the hot vapors. Clad in\ntheir fur-lined garments, which effectually defied the cold, the\nadventurers stepped out.\n\nOver the rugged ground they went, gazing curiously about them. It was\nlike being in the wildest part of the Canadian Rocky Mountains of our\nearth, and, in fact, the surface of the moon was not unlike the\nmountainous and hilly sections of the earth. There were no long ranges\nof rugged peaks, though, but rather scattered pinnacles and deep\nhollows, great craters adjoining immense, towering steeples of rocks,\nwith comparatively level ground in between.\n\nThe life-torches worked to perfection. As our friends carried them,\nthere arose about their bodies a cloud of invisible vapor, which,\nhowever, was as great a protection from the poisonous gases as a coat\nof mail would have been.\n\n\"This is great!\" exclaimed Jack. \"It's much better than to have to put\non a diving-suit and carry a cylinder of oxygen or compressed air about\non our shoulders.\"\n\nThey strolled away from the projectile and gazed back at it. Nothing\nmoved--not a sound broke the stillness. There was only the blazing\nsunlight, which, however, did not seem to warm the atmosphere much, for\nit was very chilly. On every side were great rocks, rugged and broken,\nwith here and there immense fissures in the surface of the moon,\nfissures that seemed miles and miles long.\n\n\"Well, here's where I look for diamonds,\" called Jack, as he stepped\nboldly out, followed by Mark. \"Let's see who'll find the first\nsparkler.\"\n\n\"All right,\" agreed his chum, and they strolled away together, slightly\nin advance of the two professors and Andy, who remained together, the\nscientist discussing the phenomena on every side and the hunter looking\nin vain for something to shoot. But he had come to a dead world.\n\nAlmost before they knew it Jack and Mark had gone on quite some\ndistance. Though they were not aware of it at that moment, it was much\neasier to walk on the moon than it was on the earth, for they weighed\nonly one sixth as much, and the attraction of gravitation was so much\nless.\n\nBut suddenly Jack remembered that curious fact, and, stooping, he\npicked up a stone. He cast it from him, at the same time uttering a\nyell.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" called Mark.\n\n\"Look how far I fired that rock!\" shouted Jack. \"Talk about it being\neasy! why, I believe I could throw a mile if I tried hard!\"\n\n\"It goes six times as far as it would on the earth,\" spoke his chum,\n\"and we can also jump six times as far.\"\n\n\"Then let's try that!\" proposed Jack. \"There's a nice level place over\nthere. Come on, I'll wager that I can beat you.\"\n\n\"Done!\" agreed Mark, and they hurried to the spot, their very walking\nbeing much faster than usual.\n\n\"I'll go first,\" proposed Jack, \"and you see if you can come up to me.\"\nHe poised himself on a little hummock of rock, balanced himself for a\nmoment, and then hurled himself through space.\n\nPrepared as he was, in a measure, for something strange, he never\nbargained for what happened. It was as if he had been fired from some\ncatapult of the ancient Romans. Through the air he hurtled, like some\ngreat flying animal, covering fifty feet from a standing jump.\n\n\"Say, that's great!\" yelled Mark. \"Here I come, and I'll beat----\"\n\nHe did not finish, for a cry of horror came from Jack.\n\n\"I'm going to fall into a crater--a bottomless pit! I'm on the edge of\nit!\" yelled the lad who had jumped.\n\nAnd, with horror-stricken eyes, Mark saw his chum disappear from sight\nbeyond a pile of rugged rocks, toward which he had leaped. The last\nglimpse Mark had was of the life-torch, which Jack held up in the air,\nclose to his head.\n\n\"Jack--in a crater!\" gasped Mark, as he ran forward, holding his own\nlife-torch close to his mouth and nose.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nWASHINGTON SEES A GHOST\n\n\nAdvancing by leaps and bounds, and getting over the ground in a manner\nmost surprising, Mark soon found himself on the edge of the great,\nyawning crater, into which his chum Jack had started to slide. I say\nstarted, for, fortunately, the lad had been saved from death but by a\nnarrow margin.\n\nAs Mark gazed down into the depths, which seemed fathomless, and which\nwere as black as night, he saw his friend clinging to a rocky\nprojection on the side of the extinct volcano. Jack had managed to\ngrasp a part of the rough surface as he slid down it after his reckless\njump. He looked up and saw Mark.\n\n\"Oh, Mark, can't you save me?\" he gasped. \"Call Professor Henderson!\"\n\n\"I'll get you up, don't worry!\" called Mark, as confidently as he\ncould. \"Hold tight, Jack. What has become of your life-torch?\"\n\n\"I have it here by me. I didn't drop it, and it's on a piece of the\nrock near my head. Otherwise I couldn't breathe. Oh, this place is\nfearfully deep. I guess it hasn't any bottom.\"\n\n\"Now, keep still, and don't think about that. Save your strength, hold\nfast, and I'll get you up.\"\n\nBut, having said that much, Mark was not so sure how next to proceed.\nIt was going to be no easy task to haul up Jack, and that without ropes\nor other apparatus. Another matter that added to the danger was the\nnecessity of keeping the life-torch close to one's face in order to\nprevent death by the poisonous gases.\n\nMark's first impulse was to hasten back and call the two professors,\nbut he looked over the desolate landscape, and could not see them, and\nhe feared that if he went away Jack might slip and fall into the\nunknown depths of the crater.\n\n\"I've got to get him out alone,\" decided Mark. \"But how can I do it?\"\n\nHe crawled cautiously nearer to the edge of the extinct volcano and\nlooked down. A few loose stones, dislodged by his weight, rattled down\nthe sides.\n\n\"Look out!\" cried Jack quickly, \"or you'll fall, too!\"\n\n\"I'll be careful,\" answered Mark, and then he drew away out of danger,\nwith a queer feeling about his heart, which was beating furiously. Mark\nhad hoped to be able to make his way down the side of the crater to\nwhere his chum was and help him up. But a look at the steep sides and\nthe uncertain footing afforded by the loose rocks of lava-like\nformation showed that this could not be done.\n\n\"I've got to think of a different scheme,\" decided Mark, and, spurred\non by the necessity of acting quickly if he was to save Jack, he fairly\nforced his brain to work. For he saw by the strained look on his chum's\nface that Jack could not hold out much longer.\n\n\"I have it!\" cried Mark at length. \"My fur coat! I can cut it into\nstrips of hide and make a rope. Then I can lower it down to Jack and\nhaul him up.\"\n\nHe did not think, for the moment, of the cold he would feel when he\nstripped off the fur garment, and when it did come to him in a flash he\nnever hesitated.\n\n\"After all, I've often been out without an overcoat on cold days,\" he\nsaid to himself. \"I guess I can stand it for a while, and when Jack is\nup I can run back to the projectile and keep warm that way.\"\n\nTo think was to act, and Mark laid down his life-torch to take off the\nbig fur coat. The next instant he had toppled over, almost in a faint,\nand, had he not fallen so that his head was near the small perforated\nbox on the end of the steel rod, whence came the life-giving gas, the\nlad might have died.\n\nHe had forgotten, for the instant, the necessity of always keeping the\ntorch close to his face to prevent the poisonous gases of the moon from\noverpowering him. Mark soon revived while lying on the ground, and,\nrising, with his torch in his hand, he looked about him.\n\n\"I've got to have my two hands to work with,\" he mused, \"and yet I've\ngot to hold this torch close to my face. Say, a fellow ought to have\nthree hands if he's going to visit the moon. What can I do?\"\n\nIn an instant a plan came to him. He thrust the pointed end of the\nsteel rod in the crevice of some rocks, and it stood upright, so that\nthe perforated box of chemicals was on a level with his face.\n\n\"There,\" said Mark aloud, \"I guess that will work. I can use both my\nhands now.\" The plan was a good one. Next, taking off his coat, the lad\nproceeded to cut it into strips, working rapidly. He called to Jack\noccasionally, bidding him keep up his courage. \"I'll soon have you\nout,\" he said cheeringly.\n\nIn a few minutes Mark had a long, stout strip of hide, and, taking his\nlife-torch with him, he advanced once more to the edge of the crater.\nHe stuck the torch in between some rocks, as before, and looked down at\nJack.\n\n\"I--I can't hold on much longer,\" gasped the unfortunate lad. \"Hurry,\nMark!\"\n\n\"All right. I'm going to haul you up now. Can you hold on with one hand\nlong enough to slip the loop of this rope over your shoulders?\"\n\n\"I guess so. But where did you get a rope?\"\n\n\"I made it--cut up my fur coat.\"\n\n\"But you'll freeze!\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess not. Here it comes, Jack. Get ready!\"\n\nMark lowered the hide rope to his chum. The latter, who managed to get\none toe on a small, projecting rock, while he held on with his right\nhand, used his left to adjust the loop over his shoulders and under his\narms.\n\n\"Are you all ready?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Yes, but can you pull me up?\"\n\n\"Sure. I'm six times as strong as when on the earth. Hold steady now,\nand keep the torch close to your face.\"\n\nMark had placed some pieces of his fur coat under the rope where it\npassed over the edge of the mouth of the crater to prevent the jagged\nrocks from cutting the strips of hide.\n\n\"Here you come!\" he cried to Jack, and he began to haul, taking care to\nkeep his own head near his torch, which was stuck upright. Mark had\nspoken truly when he said he possessed much more than his usual\nstrength. Any one who has tried to haul up a person with a rope from a\nhole, and with no pulleys to adjust the strain of the cable, knows what\na task it is. But to Mark, on the moon, it was comparatively easy.\n\nHand over hand he pulled on the hide rope until, with a final heave, he\nhad Jack out of his perilous position. He had pulled him up from the\nmouth of the crater, and the thick fur coat Jack wore had prevented the\nsharp rocks from injuring him. In another moment he stood beside Mark,\na trifle weak and shaky from his experience, but otherwise unhurt.\n\n\"How did you happen to go down there?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Not from choice, I assure you,\" answered Jack. \"I couldn't see the\ncrater when I jumped, as it was hidden by some rocks, and I was into it\nbefore I knew it. But don't stand talking here. Put on my coat. I don't\nneed it. I'm warm.\"\n\n\"I will not. I'm not a bit cold. But we may as well get back to the\nprojectile, for they'll be worrying about us.\" Thereupon Mark broke\ninto a run, for, now that the exertion of hauling up Jack was over, he\nbegan to feel cool, and the chilling atmosphere of the moon struck\nthrough to his bones.\n\nIn a short time the two lads were back at the _Annihilator_, where they\nfound Professors Roumann and Henderson getting a bit anxious about\nthem. Their adventure was quickly related, and the boys were cautioned\nto be more careful in the future.\n\n\"This moon is a curious, desolate place,\" said Mr. Henderson, \"and you\ncan't behave on it as you would on the earth. We have discovered some\ncurious facts regarding it, and when we get back I am going to write a\nbook on them. But I think we have seen enough for the present, so we'll\nstay in the rest of the day and plan for farther trips.\"\n\n\"Aren't we going to look for those diamonds?\" asked Jack, who had\nalmost fully recovered from his recent experience.\n\n\"Oh, yes, we will look around for them,\" assented Mr. Roumann. \"I\nthink, after a day or so, we will move our projectile to another part\nof the moon. We want to see as much of it as possible.\"\n\nThey sat discussing various matters, and, while doing so, Washington\nWhite peered into the living cabin.\n\n\"Has yo' got one ob dem torch-light processions t' spare?\" he asked.\n\n\"Torch-light processions?\" queried Mark. \"What do you think this is, an\nelection, Wash?\"\n\n\"I guess he means a life-torch,\" suggested Jack. \"Are you going out,\nWash?\"\n\n\"Yais, sah, I did think I'd take a stroll around. Maybe I kin find a\ndiamond fo' my tie.\"\n\nLaughing, Jack provided the colored man with one of the torches,\ninstructing him how to use it, and presently Washington was seen\noutside, walking gingerly around, as though he expected to go through\nthe crust of the moon any moment. Pretty soon, however, he got more\ncourage and tramped boldly along, peering about on the ground for all\nthe world, as Mark said, as if he was looking for chestnuts.\n\nThey paid no attention to the cook for some little time until, when the\nboys and the two professors were in the midst of a discussion as to\nwhere would be the best place to move the projectile next, they heard\nhim running along the corridor toward the cabin.\n\n\"Wash is in a hurry,\" observed Jack.\n\nThe next instant they sprang to their feet at the sight of the\nfrightened face of the colored man peering in on them. He was as near\nwhite as a negro can ever be, which is a sort of chalk color, and his\neyes were wide open with fear.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"A ghost! I done seen de ghost ob a dead man!\" gasped the colored man.\n\n\"A ghost?\" repeated Mark.\n\n\"Yais, sah, right out yeah! He's lyin' down in a hole--a dead man.\nGolly! but I'se a scared coon, I is!\" and Washington looked over his\nshoulder as though he feared the \"ghost\" had followed him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nA BREAKDOWN\n\n\nAt first they were inclined to regard the announcement of Washington\nlightly, but the too evident fright of the colored man showed that\nthere was some basis for his fear.\n\n\"Tell us just what you saw, and where it was,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"Was\nthe man alive, Washington?\"\n\n\"No, sah. How could a ghost be alive? Dey is all dead ones, ghosts am!\"\n\n\"There are no such things as ghosts,\" said Mr. Henderson sternly.\n\n\"Den how could I see one?\" demanded the cook triumphantly, as if there\nwas no further argument.\n\n\"Well, tell us about it,\" suggested Jack.\n\n\"It were jest dis way,\" began Washington earnestly, and with occasional\nglances over his shoulder, \"I were walkin' along, sort ob lookin' fer\ndem sparklin' diamonds, an' I didn't see none, when all on a suddint I\nlooked down in a hole, and dere I seen HIM!\" and he brought out the\nword with a jerk.\n\n\"Saw what--who?\" asked Mr. Roumann.\n\n\"De ghost--de dead man. He were lyin' all curled up, laik he were\nasleep, an' when I seed him, I didn't stop t' call him t' dinner, yo'\ncan make up yo' minds t' dat all.\"\n\n\"Can you show us the place?\" inquired Jack.\n\n\"Yais, sah, massa Jack, dat's what I kin. I'll point it out from dish\nyeah winder, but I ain't g'wine dar ag'in; no, sah, 'scuse me!\"\n\n\"Well, show us then,\" suggested Mark. \"I wonder what it can be?\" he\nwent on.\n\n\"Maybe one of the people who came from Mars after the diamonds, who was\nforgotten and left here, and who died,\" said Jack.\n\n\"It's possible,\" murmured Mr. Henderson. \"However, we'll go take a\nlook. Get on your fur coats, boys, and take the life-torches. Will you\ncome, Andy?\"\n\n\"Sure. It's got to be more than a ghost to scare me,\" said the hunter.\n\nThey emerged from the projectile and walked in the direction Washington\nhad pointed, holding their gas torches near their heads and talking of\nwhat they might see.\n\n\"This will be evidence in favor of my diamond theory,\" declared Jack.\n\"It shows that the Martians were here.\"\n\n\"Wait and see what it is,\" suggested his chum.\n\nThey walked along a short distance farther, and then Mark spoke.\n\n\"That ought to be the place over there,\" he said, pointing to a\ndepression between two tall pinnacles of black rock.\n\nJack sprang forward, and a moment later uttered a cry of astonishment.\n\n\"Here it is!\" he called. \"A dead man!\"\n\n\"A dead man?\" echoed Professor Henderson.\n\n\"A petrified man,\" added Jack, in awe-struck tones. \"He's turned to\nstone.\"\n\nA few seconds later they were all grouped around the strange object--it\nwas a man no longer, but had once been one. It was a petrified human\nbeing, a full-grown man, to judge by the size, and it was a solid image\nin stone, even the garments with which he had been clothed being turned\nto rock.\n\nFor a moment no one spoke, and they gazed in silence at what was an\nevidence of former life on the moon. The man was huddled up, with the\nknees drawn toward the stomach and the arms bent around the body, as if\nthe man had died in agony. The features were scarcely distinguishable.\n\n\"That man was never an inhabitant of Mars,\" spoke Professor Henderson,\nin a low voice. \"He is much too large, and he has none of the\ncharacteristics of the Martians.\"\n\n\"I agree with you,\" came from Mr. Roumann.\n\n\"Then who is he?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I think,\" said the aged scientist, \"that we are now gazing on all that\nwas once mortal of one of the inhabitants of the moon.\"\n\n\"An inhabitant of the moon?\" gasped Mark.\n\n\"Yes; why not?\" went on Mr. Henderson. \"I believe the moon was once a\nplanet like our earth--perhaps even a part of it, and I think that it\nwas inhabited. In time it cooled so that life could no longer be\nsupported, or, at least, this side of the moon presents that\nindication. The people were killed--frozen to death, and by reason of\nthe chemical action of the gases, or perhaps from the moon being\ncovered with water in which was a large percentage of lime, they were\nturned to stone. That is what happened to this poor man.\"\n\n\"Such a thing is possible,\" admitted Professor Roumann gravely.\n\nAnd, indeed, it is, as the writer can testify, for in the Metropolitan\nMuseum in New York there are the remains of an ancient South American\nminer, whose body has been turned into solid copper. The corpse, of\nwhich the features are partly distinguishable, was found four hundred\nfeet down in an old copper mine, where the dripping from hidden\nsprings, the waters of which were rich in copper sulphate, had\nconverted the man's body into a block of metal, retaining its natural\nshape. The body is drawn up in agony, and there is every indication\nthat the man was killed by a cave-in of the mine. Some of his tools\nwere found near him.\n\nThey remained gazing at the weird sight of the petrified man for some\ntime.\n\n\"Then the moon was once inhabited?\" asked Jack at length.\n\n\"I believe so--yes,\" answered Professor Henderson.\n\n\"Then where are the other people?\" asked Mark. \"There must be more than\none left. Why was this man off here alone?\"\n\n\"We don't know,\" responded the German scientist. \"Perhaps he was off\nalone in the mountains when death overtook him, or perhaps all his\ncompanions were buried under an upheaval of rock. We can only theorize.\"\n\n\"It will be something else to put in the book I am to write,\" said Mr.\nHenderson. \"But, now that we have evidence of former life on the moon,\nwe must investigate further. We will make an attempt to go to the other\nside of the country, and to that end I suggest that we set our\nprojectile in motion and travel a bit. There is little more to see\nhere.\"\n\nThis plan met with general approval, and, after some photographs had\nbeen taken of the petrified man, and the professors had made notes, and\nset down data regarding him, and had tried to guess how long he had\nbeen dead, they went back to the _Annihilator_.\n\n\"Well, did yo' all see him?\" asked Washington.\n\n\"We sure did,\" answered Jack. \"You weren't mistaken that time.\"\n\nThey got ready to move the projectile, but decided to remain over night\nwhere they were. \"Over night\" being the way they spoke of it, though,\nas I have said, there was perpetual daylight for fourteen days at a\ntime on the moon.\n\nProfessors Roumann and Henderson made a few more observations for\nscientific purposes. They found traces of some vegetation, but it was\nof little value for food, even to the lower forms of animal life, they\ndecided. There was also a little moisture; noticed at certain hours of\nthe day. But, in the main, the place where they had landed was most\ndesolate.\n\n\"I hope we get to a better place soon,\" said Jack, just before they\nsealed themselves up in the projectile to travel to a new spot.\n\nAs distance was comparatively small on the moon, for her diameter is\nonly a little over two thousand miles and the circumference only about\nsix thousand six hundred miles, the _Annihilator_ could not be speeded\nup. If it went too fast, it would soon be off the moon and into space\nagain.\n\nAccordingly the Cardite motor was geared to send the big craft along at\nabout forty miles an hour, and at times they went even slower than\nthat, when they were passing over some part of the surface which the\nprofessors wished to photograph or observe closely.\n\nThey did not rise high into the air, but flew along at an elevation of\nabout two hundred feet, steering in and out to avoid the towering peaks\nscattered here and there. Occasionally they found themselves over\nimmense craters that seemed to have no bottom.\n\nFor two days they moved here and there, finding no further signs of\nlife, neither petrified nor natural, though they saw many strange\nsights, and some valuable pictures and scientific data was obtained.\n\nIt was on the third day, when they were approaching the side of the\nmoon which from time immemorial has been hidden from view of the\ninhabitants of the earth, that Jack, who was with Mark in the engine\nroom, while the two professors were in the pilot-house, remarked to his\nchum: \"Mark, doesn't it strike you that the water pump and the air\napparatus aren't working just right?\"\n\n\"They don't seem to be operating very smoothly,\" admitted Mark, after\nan examination.\n\n\"That's what I thought. Let's call Mr. Henderson. The machinery may\nneed adjusting.\"\n\nJack started from the engine room to do this, and as he paused on the\nthreshold there was a sudden crash. Part of the air pump seemed to fly\noff at a tangent, and a second later had smashed down on the Cardite\nmotor. This stopped in an instant, and the projectile began falling.\nFortunately it was but a short distance above the moon's surface, and\ncame down with a jar, which did not injure the travellers.\n\nBut there was sufficient damage done to the machinery, for with the\nbreaking of the air pump the water apparatus also went out of\ncommission, and together with the breakdown of the Cardite motor had\nfairly stalled the _Annihilator_.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" cried Professor Henderson, running in from the\npilot-house, for an automatic signal there had apprised him that\nsomething was wrong.\n\n\"There's a bad break,\" said Jack ruefully.\n\n\"A bad break! I should say there was,\" remarked the scientist. \"I think\nwe'll have to lay up for repairs.\" And he called Mr. Roumann.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nLOST ON THE MOON\n\n\nNotwithstanding that they were somewhat accustomed to having accidents\nhappen, it was not with the most pleasant feelings in the world that\nthe moon travellers contemplated this one. It meant a delay, and a\ndelay was the one thing they did not want just now.\n\nThey desired to get to the other side of the moon while the long period\nof sunshine gave them an opportunity for observation. True there was\nsome time yet ere the long night of fourteen days would settle down,\nbut they felt that they would need every hour of sunshine.\n\n\"Well, it's tough luck, but it can't be helped,\" said Mark.\n\n\"No, let's get right to work,\" suggested Jack.\n\nThey got out their tools and started to repair the two pumps. It was\nfound that the Cardite motor was not badly damaged, one of the negative\nelectrical plates merely having been smashed by a piece of the broken\nconnecting rod of the air pump. It was only a short time before the\nmotor was ready to run again.\n\nBut it could not be successfully operated without the air and water\npumps, and it was necessary to fix them next. New gaskets were needed,\nwhile an extra valve and some sliding gears had to be replaced.\n\n\"It's an all day's job,\" remarked Professor Henderson.\n\nBut many hands made light work, and even Washington and Andy were\ncalled upon to do their share. By dinner time the work was more than\nhalf done, and Professor Roumann, announced that he and Mr. Henderson\nwould finish it if Jack and Mark would take a look at the exterior of\nthe projectile, to see if any repairs were needed to that.\n\nThe boys found that some of the exterior piping had become loosed at\nthe joints, because of the jar of the sudden descent, and, taking the\nnecessary tools outside, while they stuck their life-torches upright\nnear them, they labored away.\n\nAt four o'clock the two lads had their task completed, and at the same\ntime Professor Henderson announced that the air and water pumps were\nnow in good shape again.\n\n\"Then let's get under way at once,\" suggested Mr. Roumann. \"We have\nlost enough time as it is. Hurry inside, boys, and we'll start.\"\n\nThe two chums were glad enough to do so, and in a few minutes they were\nagain moving through the air toward the unknown portion of the moon.\n\nBelow the travellers, as they could see by looking down through a\nplate-glass window in the floor of the projectile, were the same rugged\npeaks, the same large and small craters that had marked the surface of\nthe moon from the time they had first had a glimpse of it. There was an\nuninteresting monotony about it, unrelieved by any save the very\nsparest vegetation.\n\n\"I am beginning to think more and more that we will find people on the\nother side of this globe,\" remarked Mr. Roumann, as he made an\nobservation through a telescope.\n\n\"What strengthens your belief?\" inquired Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"The fact that the vegetation is growing thicker. There are many more\nplants below us now than there were before. This part of the moon is\nbetter able to support life than the portion we have just come from.\"\n\nThis seemed to be so, but they were still some distance from the\nopposite side of the moon.\n\n\"I don't see anything of those diamonds you talked so much about,\nJack,\" said Mark, with a smile, a little later. \"I guess all the\nReonaris you get you can put in a hollow tooth.\"\n\n\"You wait,\" was all Jack replied.\n\nThe projectile was slowed up to permit the two professors to make some\nnotes regarding a particularly large and deep crater, and a few minutes\nlater when Mark, who was in the engine room, attempted to speed up the\nCordite motor it would not respond.\n\n\"Humph! I wonder what's wrong?\" he asked of Jack.\n\n\"Better call Mr. Roumann, and not try to fix it yourself,\" suggested\nhis chum, when, in response to various movements of the lever, the\nmachine seemed to go slower and slower.\n\nThe German came in answer to the summons.\n\n\"Ha!\" he exclaimed, \"that motor is broken again. We shall have to stop\nonce more for repairs. I shall need to take it all apart, I fear. Get\nme the negative plate remover, will you, Mark?\"\n\nThe lad went to the tool chest for it. He opened the lid and fumbled\nabout inside.\n\n\"It doesn't seem to be here,\" he announced.\n\n\"What! the negative plate remover not there?\" cried the professor.\n\"Why, it must be. It is one of the new tools we got, and it has not\nbeen used for anything; has it?\".\n\n\"Oh, by Jinks!\" cried Jack suddenly.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked his chum.\n\n\"That plate remover! Don't you remember you and I had it when we were\nfixing the pipes outside the projectile, when we had the other\nbreakdown? We must have left it back there on the ground.\"\n\nJack and his chum gazed blankly at each other.\n\n\"I guess we did,\" admitted Mark dubiously.\n\n\"And it is the only one we have,\" said Mr. Roumann. \"We need it very\nmuch, too, for the projectile can't very well be moved without it.\"\n\n\"How can we get it?\" asked Jack. \"I'm sorry. It was my fault.\"\n\n\"It was as much mine as yours,\" asserted Mark. \"I guess it's up to us\nto go back after it. It isn't far. We can easily walk it.\"\n\nThere seemed to be nothing else to do, and, after some discussion, it\nwas decided to have the two boys walk back after the missing tool,\nwhich was a very valuable one.\n\n\"Take fresh life-torches with you,\" advised Mr. Henderson, \"and you had\nbetter carry some food with you. It may be farther back than you think,\nand you may get hungry.\"\n\n\"I guess it will be a good thing to take some lunch along,\" admitted\nJack. \"And some water, too. We can't get a drink here unless we come to\na spring, and we haven't seen any since we arrived.\"\n\n\"I'll go with you, if you don't mind,\" said Andy. \"I may see something\nto shoot.\"\n\nThe three of them, each one carrying a freshly charged vapor-torch, a\nbasket of food and a bottle of water, started off, well wrapped in\ntheir fur coats. Andy had a compass to enable them to make their way\nback to where the tool was left, for, amid the towering peaks and the\nvalley-like depressions, very little of the level surface of the moon\ncould be seen at a time.\n\nThey walked on for several hours, every now and then hoping that they\nhad reached the place where the projectile had been halted, and where\nthey expected to find the tool. But so many places looked alike that\nthey were deceived a number of times.\n\nAt length, however, they reached the spot and found the instrument\nwhere Jack had carelessly dropped it. They picked it up and turned to\ngo back, when Andy Sudds saw a large crater off to one side.\n\n\"Boys, I'm going to have a look down that,\" he said. \"It may contain a\nbear or wildcat, and I can get a shot.\"\n\n\"Guess there isn't much danger of a bear being on the moon,\" said Mark,\nbut the old hunter leaned as far over the edge of the crater as he\ndared.\n\n\"No, there's nothing here,\" he announced, with almost a sigh, and he\nstraightened up. As he did so there came a tinkling sound, as if some\none had dropped a piece of money.\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"By heck! It's the compass!\" cried Andy. \"It slipped from my pocket\nwhen I stooped over. Now it's gone!\"\n\nThere was no question of that. They could hear the instrument tinkling\nfar down in the unfathomable depths, striking from side to side of the\ncrater as it went down and down.\n\n\"We'll never see that again,\" spoke Mark dubiously. \"Can we get back to\nthe projectile without it?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Oh, I fancy I can pick my trail back,\" answered the hunter. \"It isn't\ngoing to be easy, for there are no landmarks to guide me, but I'll do\nmy best. I ought to have known better than to put a compass in that\npocket.\"\n\nIt was not with very light hearts that they started back, and for a\ntime they went cautiously. Then, as they seemed to get on familiar\nground, they increased their pace and covered several miles.\n\n\"Say,\" remarked. Jack, as he sat down on a big stone. \"I don't know how\nthe rest of you feel, but I'm tired. We've come quite a distance since\nwe picked up that tool.\"\n\n\"Yes, farther than it took us to find it after we left the projectile,\"\nadded Mark. \"I wonder if we're going right?\"\n\nThe two boys looked at Andy. He scratched his head in perplexity.\n\n\"I can't be sure, but it seems to me that we came past here,\" he said.\n\"I seem to remember that big rock.\"\n\n\"There are lots like it,\" observed Jack.\n\n\"Suppose we try over to the left,\" spoke Mark, after they had rested\nfor ten minutes.\n\nThey swerved in that direction, and, after keeping on that trail for\nsome time, and becoming more and more convinced that it was the wrong\none, they turned to the right. That did not bring them to familiar\nground, and there was no sight of the projectile.\n\n\"Let's go straight ahead,\" suggested Andy, after a puzzled pause. \"I\nthink that will be best.\"\n\n\"Well, which way is straight ahead?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"That's so, it is hard to tell,\" admitted the hunter. \"I wish I hadn't\nlost that compass.\"\n\nThey wandered about for an hour longer. They could seem to make no\nprogress, though they covered much ground. Suddenly Jack called out:\n\n\"Say, we've been going around in a circle!\"\n\n\"In a circle?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Yes,\" went on his chum. \"Here's the very rock I sat down on a while\nago. I remember it, for I scratched my initials on it.\"\n\nJack pointed out the letters. There was no disputing it. They had made\na complete circle. For a moment they maintained silence in the face of\nthis alarming fact. Then Mark exclaimed:\n\n\"I guess we're lost!\"\n\n\"Lost on the moon!\" added Jack, in an awestruck voice, and he gazed on\nthe chill and desolate scene all about them; the great pinnacles of\nrocks, in fantastic form; the immense black caverns of craters on\neither hand; the sickly green vegetation.\n\n\"Lost on the moon!\" whispered Mark, and there was not even an echo of\nhis voice to keep them company. Only a chill, desolate silence!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nDESOLATE WANDERINGS\n\n\nFor a moment the three stood helplessly there and stared at each other.\nThey could scarcely comprehend their situation at first. Then, with a\nglance at the cold and quiet scene all about them, a look up at the\nsun, which was the only cheerful object in the whole landscape, Jack\nobserved: \"Oh, I say, come on now, don't let's give up this way! We\nhave only taken a wrong turn, and I'll wager that the projectile will\nbe just around the corner. Come on,\" and he started off.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mark, \"that's the trouble. There are so many corners, and\nwe have taken so many wrong turns, that we're all confused. I think the\nbest thing to do will be to stay here a while and pull ourselves\ntogether.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" spoke old Andy. \"Many a time in the woods I've got all\nconfused-like, and then I'd sit down and think, and I'd get on the\nright path in a few minutes after.\"\n\n\"The trouble here is,\" said Jack, \"that there are no woods. If there\nwere we might know how to get out of them. But think of it! Lost on the\nmoon, in the midst of a whole lot of queer mountain peaks, and big\nholes that would hold half a dozen cities of the United States at the\nsame time, and never know it! This is a fearful place to be lost in!\"\n\n\"I'm not going to admit that we're lost,\" declared Mark stoutly.\n\n\"Hu! You're like the Indian,\" spoke Jack. \"The Indian who got lost in\nthe woods. He insisted that it wasn't he who was lost, that it was his\nwigwam that couldn't be found. He knew where he himself was all the\nwhile. That's our case, I suppose. We're here, but the projectile is\nlost.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed Andy Sudds. \"That's a pretty good joke!\"\n\n\"But not being able to find the projectile is no joke,\" went on Mark,\nwho always took matters more seriously than did his chum. \"What are we\ngoing to do?\" he added. \"We can't stay here like this.\"\n\n\"Maybe we'll have to,\" declared Jack. \"We certainly can't get off the\nmoon--at least, not until we reach the projectile, and I'd like to\ndiscover those diamonds before we go back.\"\n\n\"Hu! Those diamonds!\" exploded Mark. \"I think this whole thing is a\nwild-goose chase, anyhow! If it hadn't been for those diamonds we\nwouldn't have come to the moon. I don't believe there are any diamonds\nhere, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't prove it to you now, but I will before we get back,\"\nasserted Jack. \"We'll be wearing diamonds, as the song says.\"\n\n\"Diamonds aren't going to keep us warm when we're freezing,\" went on\nMark, who seemed bound to look on the dark side, \"and we can't eat 'em\nwhen we're hungry. A lot of good they'll do us if we do find them!\"\n\n\"Oh, cheer up!\" suggested Jack cheerfully. \"And, speaking of eating,\nwhat's the matter with having some lunch? What did we bring it along\nfor if we're not going to eat? Let's begin.\"\n\nHis good spirits were contagious, not that Andy needed any special\ncheering up, but Mark did. In a few minutes they were seated on some\nrugged rocks, and, with their life-torches stuck in cracks, so that the\nperforated metal boxes of chemicals would be on a level with their\nfaces, they opened the baskets they had been fore-sighted enough to\nbring with them.\n\n\"Why, I feel better already,\" asserted Jack, as he munched some\nsandwiches which Washington White had made. \"As soon as we've finished\nwe'll have another hunt for the projectile, and I'll wager that we'll\nfind it.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't finish if I were you,\" suggested Andy, who was eating\nsparingly.\n\n\"Finish what?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"All your lunch. You see,\" the old hunter went on, \"we may find the\nprojectile, and, again, we may not. I'm inclined to think we're not so\nvery far from it, but we may be some time locating it in among all\nthese peaks and craters. So it will be the best plan to save some of\nour lunch and drinking water until--well, until we're hungry again,\"\nand he carefully put back into his basket the remains of the food.\n\n\"You don't mean to say you think we'll be all day finding the\nAnnihilator, do you?\"\n\nJack paused, with a sandwich half way to his mouth as he asked this\nquestion.\n\n\"Well, it's best to be on the safe side,\" spoke Andy guardedly. \"We may\nfind it, and, again, we may not. Save your powder against the time of\nneed, I say--by powder meaning victuals and drink. We can't drop in a\nrestaurant up here, and I don't see much game to shoot, and I should\nhate to eat such fodder as this,\" and he poked with his foot some\nsickly green vines, growing on the ground.\n\nThe boys' faces, which had become more cheerful, assumed a serious\nlook. Jack stopped eating at once and placed back in the basket his\nremaining sandwiches. He also corked up the bottle of water, which was\nkept from freezing by means of a fur pouch in which it was carried.\n\n\"If there's a possibility of being lost some time,\" spoke Mark, \"we'd\nbetter figure out just how long our food will last,\" and he examined\nthe contents of his basket.\n\nFortunately Washington White, with a knowledge of the appetites of the\nchums, had filled the baskets with lavish hands. There was, they found,\nfood enough to last them three days, if they ate sparingly, and there\nwas enough water for half that time, providing they only took small\nsips when thirsty. But they had noticed, in one or two places, little\npools of liquid, which they had not tasted, but which might prove to be\ndrinking water. Certainly they would need more if they were destined to\nremain away from the projectile for very long.\n\n\"Well, then,\" observed Mark, when the food calculation was over, \"it\nappears that we can remain lost for about three days, at the most.\"\n\n\"Oh, but we'll be back home--I mean in the projectile--long before\nthat,\" declared Jack.\n\n\"I wish I was sure of that,\" murmured Andy with a dubious shake of his\nhead.\n\n\"Well, let's move on again,\" suggested Jack. \"We feel better now, and\nmaybe we'll have better luck.\"\n\nThey started off, tramping over the rugged surface of the moon, while\nthe sun shone with tepid heat down on them. They had to go this way and\nthat to avoid the immense fissures in the ground or the yawning\ncraters, which loomed deep, and in awful silence, in their path.\nSometimes they climbed small mountains or crawled in and out of small\ncraters, slipping and stumbling.\n\nThey were not cold, for their fur garments kept them comfortably warm,\nand there was no wind to make the freezing temperature search through\nthe crevices of their clothing. But it was the desolate silence, the\nutter absence of any form of life save the pale green vegetation that\ngot on their nerves. It was like being in a dead world--on a planet\nthat seemed about to dissolve into space.\n\nThey began their further search for the projectile with hope in their\nhearts, but this gradually gave way to despair as they wandered on over\nthe desolate surface, and saw nothing but the same rugged peaks, the\nsame yawning caverns and the innumerable craters, large and small.\n\nOn they wandered, looking on all sides for the missing projectile, but\nthey had no glimpse of it. Even climbing to one of the high peaks,\nwhence they had a view of the surrounding country, afforded them no\ntrace of the _Annihilator_, They were utterly lost.\n\nOld Andy, who, by reason of his experience as a trapper and hunter, had\ntaken the lead, came to a halt. He looked around helplessly. He did not\nknow what to do.\n\n\"Well, boys,\" he remarked at length, \"I don't like to say it, but I\ncan't seem to get anywhere. I give up.\"\n\n\"Give up?\" murmured Jack, in blank dismay.\n\n\"Yes, for the time being,\" said the old man. \"I'm all played out. I\nguess we all are. We must have a rest. Here's a sort of cave. Let's\ncrawl in and have a sleep. Then maybe we can do something\nto-morrow--no, not to-morrow, for they don't have that on the moon,\nwhere the day is fourteen days long--but after we sleep we may be able\nto find our way back. Anyhow, I've got to get some sleep,\" and without\nanother word the old hunter went into the cave, and, fixing his\nlife-torch near his head, where the fumes from it would dissipate the\npoisonous gases of the moon, he closed his eyes, and was soon in\nslumber.\n\n\"I--I guess we'd better do the same,\" said Jack, and Mark nodded. They\nwere both sick at heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nTHE PETRIFIED CITY\n\n\nFor a time, after they had entered the cave, which was in the side of a\nrugged mountain, the boys talked in low tones of their perilous\nsituation. For that it was perilous they both knew. Had they been on\nthe earth, lost in some desolate part of it, away from civilization,\ntheir plight, would have been bad enough with what little food they\npossessed.\n\nBut on the far-off moon--the dead moon, which contained no living\ncreatures save themselves, as far as they could tell--with no form of\nanimal life that might serve to keep them from starving, with only the\nscantiest of vegetation, their situation was most deplorable.\n\n\"And then there's another thing,\" said Mark, as if he was cataloguing a\nlist of their troubles.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Jack. \"I guess we have all the troubles that belong\nto us, and more, too.\"\n\n\"Well, what are we going to do when the life-torches give out, and we\ncan't breathe any more?\" asked Mark dubiously.\n\n\"Well, I guess it'll be all up with us then, if we don't starve to\ndeath in the meanwhile,\" answered Jack. \"But I'm afraid we will get out\nof food before the torches are exhausted. They were freshly filled\nbefore we started out after that tool, and they'll last for two weeks.\nSo we don't have to worry about that.\n\n\"By Jinks! this is all my fault, anyhow, it seems. If I hadn't seen\nthat item in the Martian paper about the diamonds, we never would have\ncome here, and if I hadn't left that tool on the ground outside of the\nprojectile we wouldn't have had to come back after it, and we wouldn't\nhave become lost. So I guess it's up to me, as the boys say.\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense!\" exclaimed Mark, who, as soon as he heard his chum\nblaming his own actions, was ready to shoulder part of the\nresponsibility himself. \"We all wanted to come to the moon,\" he went\non, \"and, as for leaving the tool and forgetting it, I'm as much at\nfault as you are. Let's go to sleep, and maybe we'll feel better when\nwe wake up.\"\n\nIt was a new role for Mark--to be cheerful in the face of\ndifficulties--and Jack appreciated it. They stretched out on the hard,\nrocky floor of the cavern, taking care to fix their life-torches so\nthat the fumes would dispel the poisonous gases. Then the two lads\njoined Andy in slumberland.\n\nMeanwhile, as may be imagined, those aboard the projectile were very\nanxious about the fate of the two boys and the hunter. They could not\nunderstand what delayed them, and, though they guessed the real cause,\nafter several hours had passed, there was nothing the two scientists\ncould do.\n\nThey could not move the projectile until it had been repaired, and this\ncould not be done, without the tool--at least, they did not believe so\nthen. Nor did Mr. Henderson and the German think it would be safe to\nstart out in search of the wanderers.\n\n\"For,\" said Mr. Henderson, \"if we went we would easily get lost amid\nthese peaks ourselves, and they are so much alike and in such numbers\nthat there is no distinguishing feature about them. We had better stay\nhere in charge of the _Annihilator_ until the boys and Andy come back.\nThey can't be away much longer now.\"\n\nSo worn out and exhausted were the boys and the hunter that they slept\nfor several hours in the cave, and the rest did them good. They awoke\nin better spirits, and, after a frugal meal and a sip of the\nfast-dwindling water, they started off once more to locate the\nprojectile.\n\n\"I'm a regular amateur hunter to go and lose my compass,\" complained\nold Andy. \"I ought to have it fastened to me, like a baby does the\nrattle-box. I ought to kick myself,\" and he accepted all the blame for\ntheir misadventure. But the boys would not suffer him to thus accuse\nhimself, and they insisted that they would shortly be with the two\nprofessors and Washington in the _Annihilator_ once more.\n\n\"Well, it can't come any too soon,\" said Jack, \"for I am beginning to\nfeel the need of a square meal and a big drink of water.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" said Mark, \"but let's not think of it.\"\n\nAll that day they wandered on, crossing the rugged mountains, climbing\ntowering peaks, and descending into deep valleys. At times they skirted\nthe lips of craters, to look shudderingly into the depths of which made\nthem dizzy, for the bottoms were lost to sight in the black gloom that\nenshrouded the yawning holes.\n\nTheir food was getting less and less, and what there was of it was most\nunpalatable, for the bread was stale and dry, though the meat kept\nperfectly in that freezing temperature. How they longed for a hot cup\nof coffee, such as Washington used to make! and how they would have\neven exchanged their chance of filling their pockets with the moon\ndiamonds for a good meal, such as was so often served in the projectile!\n\nOn and on they went. Once, as they were crossing the lip of a great\ncrater, Mark became dizzy, and would have fallen had not Jack caught\nhim. Mark had forgotten, for the moment, and had lowered his\nlife-torch, so that his mouth and nose were not enclosed in the film of\nvapor that emanated from the perforated box.\n\n\"You must be careful,\" Andy warned them.\n\n\"What's the use?\" asked Mark despondently. \"I don't believe we'll ever\nfind the projectile.\"\n\n\"Of course we will!\" exclaimed Jack. \"I know we can't be far from it,\nonly we can't see it because of the mountains. If we only had some way\nof letting them know where we are, they could signal to us.\"\n\n\"By gum!\" suddenly exclaimed Andy.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Jack, for the old hunter was capering about\nlike a boy.\n\n\"Matter? Why, the matter is that I'm a double-barrelled dunce,\" was the\nanswer. \"Look here; do you see that?\" and he held up his rifle.\n\n\"Sure,\" replied Jack, wondering if their sufferings and worry had made\nthe old hunter simple-minded.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Andy, shaking it in the air.\n\n\"Your rifle,\" answered Mark, looking at Jack in surprise.\n\n\"Of course,\" answered the hunter, \"and a rifle is made to be fired off,\nand here I've been carrying mine for nearly three days now, and I\nhaven't shot it once. You wanted a signal to make the folks in the\nprojectile hear us. Well, here it is I I guess they can hear this, and\nwhen they do they can come and get us, for we don't seem able to reach\nthem. I'll just fire some signal shots.\"\n\n\"That's the stuff!\" cried Jack, and Andy proceeded to discharge his\nrifle.\n\nThe report the gun made in that quiet place was tremendous, and the\neffect was curious, for, there being no air in the ordinary acceptance\nof the word, there was no echo. It was as if one had hit two shingles\ntogether. Merely a loud, sharp sound, and then an utter silence, the\nvibrations being swallowed up instantly.\n\n\"Do you think they can hear that?\" asked Andy.\n\n\"It sounds loud enough,\" answered Jack. \"Shoot some more,\" which the\nold hunter did. They wandered on still farther, firing at intervals all\nthat day, but there came no answering report or calls to direct them to\nthe projectile. They climbed once more to the tops of towering peaks,\nbut there they found their range of vision limited by peaks still\nhigher, while there were great valleys, in one of which, whether near\nor far they could not tell, they knew, the _Annihilator_ was hidden.\n\nThey had almost lost track of time now, and they did not know how far\nthey had wandered. They had sought out lonely caves to sleep in when\nthey were so weary they could go no farther, and they had sat about on\nbleak rocks shivering, and had eaten their scanty meals--shivering\nbecause in spite of their fur garments they were cold, as they did not\neat enough to keep their blood properly circulating. They could not\nwhen they did not have the food to eat!\n\nAndy used up all but a few of his cartridges in firing signals, but to\nno purpose. Their water was all but gone, and of their food only enough\nremained for a day longer, though their life-torches still gave forth\nplenty of vapor.\n\n\"Well, what's to be done?\" asked Jack, as they sat about, looking\nhelplessly at one another.\n\n\"Might as well give up,\" suggested Mark bitterly.\n\n\"Give up? Not a bit of it!\" cried Andy, as cheerfully as he could.\n\"Let's keep on. We'll find the projectile sooner or later.\"\n\nSo they kept on. It was while making their way between two great\nmountain peaks that towered above their heads on either side, thousands\nof feet up, making a sort of natural gateway, that Jack, who was in the\nlead, cried out in astonishment at the sight that met his gaze when he\nhad passed the pinnacles.\n\n\"Look!\" he shouted, pointing forward.\n\nWhat he indicated was a great crater--larger and deeper than any they\nhad yet met with. It seemed a mile across, and, if gloom and darkness\nwere any indications, it was a hundred miles deep.\n\nBut it was not the size of the great hole in the ground, not its\nfearful gloom, that attracted their attention. What did was a great\nnatural or artificial bridge of stone that was thrown across the middle\nof it from edge to edge. A bridge of stone that spanned the abyss; a\nroadway, fifty feet wide, which reached into some unknown land,\nconnecting it with the desolate country in which our friends had been\nwandering.\n\n\"A bridge of stone across the cavern,\" said Jack, \"but see. Here is a\nhouse of stone. This was the guard-house, I'll wager--the guardhouse at\nthe entrance to some city, and that bridge is the means by which the\ninhabitants entered and left. Maybe we are at the edge of the inhabited\npart of the moon!\"\n\nHis words thrilled them. They pressed forward to the beginning of the\nbridge across the crater. They looked into the stone hut. Clearly it\nhad been made by hands, for it was composed of blocks of stone, neatly\nfitted together. Jack's theory seemed confirmed.\n\nMark peered into the house, and uttered a cry of alarm.\n\n\"There's a petrified man in there!\" he gasped.\n\nJack and Andy looked in at the open window. They saw, sitting at a\ntable, which was also of rock, a man, evidently a soldier, or rather he\nhad been, for he was nothing but stone now, like the hut in which he\ndwelt.\n\nThe wanderers looked at each other with fear on their faces. What\ndreadful mystery were they about to penetrate? \"Let's cross the\nbridge,\" suggested Jack, in a low voice. \"Maybe this marks the end of\ndesolation. Perhaps we may find life and food across the crater.\"\n\n\"But--but the petrified man!\" gasped Mark.\n\n\"What of it? He won't hurt us. Maybe there are live men, who will take\ncare of us, beyond there,\" and Jack pointed across the bridge of stone.\n\nThere was nothing to keep them where they were--in the land of\ndesolation. They could not live much longer there, with no food and\nwater. To pass on over the crater seemed the only thing to do.\n\n\"Come ahead,\" called Jack boldly. They followed him. They kept in the\nmiddle of the road, for to approach the edge, where there was a sheer\ndescent of so many feet that it made them dizzy to think of it, filled\nthem with terror. On they hurried until, in a short time, they had\ncrossed the great chasm.\n\nThe road over the crater came to an end between two peaks, similar to\nthose at the beginning. Jack was the first to pass them, and as he\nemerged he once more uttered a cry--a cry of fear and wonder.\n\nAnd well he might, for in a valley below the wanderers there was a\ncity. A great city, with wonderful buildings, with wide streets well\nlaid out--a city in which figures of many men and women could be\nseen--little children too! A fair city, teeming with life, it seemed!\n\nBut then, as they looked again, struck by the curious quiet that\nprevailed, they knew that they were gazing down on a city of the\ndead--a city where the inhabitants had been turned to stone, even as\nhad the soldier on guard in his lonely hut.\n\nThey had come upon a petrified city of the moon!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nSEEKING FOOD\n\n\n\"Well, if this isn't the limit!\" burst out Jack, when he had stood and\ncontemplated the silent city for several moments, which also his\ncompanions did. \"After all our wanderings and troubles, when we do find\na place, it isn't any good to us. I don't suppose there is a square\nmeal in the whole town! Isn't it wonderful, though--every person turned\nto stone!\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" gasped old Andy. \"I never saw anything like it in all my\nlife! What do you reckon did it, boys?\"\n\n\"The same thing that turned the man in the hut, and the one Washington\nthought was a ghost, into stone,\" answered Mark. \"There was a rain of\nsome lime-water, or a liquid charged with similar chemicals, and the\npeople were turned to rocks.\"\n\nIt was uncanny, and for a moment they hesitated on the edge of the\ncity, which lay in a sort of cup-like valley, surrounded on all sides\nby towering peaks of the moon mountains. The bridge over which they had\ncome afforded the only entrance to the city, and in times of war\n(provided the inhabitants of the moon ever fought) the passage must\nhave been well guarded.\n\nIt was evidently a time of peace when the calamity that turned the\ninhabitants to stone came upon them, for only one soldier was in the\nguard hut--doubtless being there merely to give an alarm, or possibly\nto keep out undesirable strangers.\n\n\"Well, are we going to stand here all day?\" asked Jack of his\ncompanions, when they had contemplated the silent city for five minutes\nlonger.\n\n\"I say, let's go down there and see what we can find. I'm getting\nhungry.\"\n\n\"There'll be nothing there to eat,\" declared Mark. \"If there ever was\nanything, it's now stone. Think of a loaf of bread like a brick, and a\nchunk of meat like some great rock!\"\n\n\"Let's go down, anyhow,\" added Andy, and they advanced.\n\nAs they got down into the streets, the weird effect came over them more\nstrongly. It was as if they had suddenly entered some large town, and\nat their advent every living person had been turned into an image.\n\n\"Wonderful, wonderful!\" murmured Jack.\n\n\"I've read of the uncovering of the ancient buried cities, and how they\nfound women in the kitchen baking bread, and men at their work, but\nthis goes ahead of that, for here the people are not dust--they are\nstatues!\"\n\n\"It certainly is wonderful,\" agreed Mark. \"I only wish the two\nprofessors could see this. They could write several books about it.\nThis proves that the moon was once inhabited, though it is dead now.\nThe projectile should have come to this part of the moon.\"\n\n\"Maybe they'll bring it here, when we get back and tell them what we've\nseen,\" suggested Jack.\n\n\"Yes, if we ever do get back,\" went on his chum, with a return of his\ngloomy thoughts.\n\nThe strangeness of the scenes all about them can scarcely be imagined.\nThink of looking at a city street teeming with life, men and women\nhurrying here and there, dogs running about, children at their play,\nand then suddenly seeing that same street become as dead as some\nmountain, with the people represented as stones on that same mountain,\nand you can get some idea of what our friends looked upon.\n\nHere was a woman, looking in a store window, probably at some bargains,\nthough even the very window and store itself was now stone, and the\nwoman was like a block of marble. Near her was a little child, also\nturned to stone, and there were a number of men, standing together on a\nstreet corner as if they had been talking politics when the calamity\novertook them.\n\nThere were shops where the workers had been turned to stone at their\nbenches, there were houses at the windows of which stone faces peered\nout, and there were parks on the benches of which sat men, women and\nchildren, stiff and solid--creatures of stone! Truly it was a city of\nthe dead!\n\nThe wanderers walked about, seeing new wonders on every side. They\nspoke in whispers at times, as though at the sound of a loud voice the\nsilent ones would awaken and resume the occupations or pleasures they\nhad left off centuries ago.\n\nAnother strange part of it was that the people were not so very\ndifferent from those of the earth. They were exactly the same in size\nand feature, but their clothing, as nearly as could be told from the\nstone garments, seemed of a bygone fashion, such as was in vogue\nhundreds of years ago. There were no horses observed, though there were\nstone dogs and cats, and the shops given over to the sale of food\ncontained in the windows what seemed to be chunks of meat, loaves of\nbread, and pies and cakes, though now they were only pieces of rock.\n\n\"It's just as if one of our cities and the people in it should be\nsuddenly petrified,\" said Mark. \"It's almost like the earth up here;\nonly they don't seem to have gotten to trolley cars yet.\"\n\n\"Maybe they would if the moon hadn't cooled off when it did, and killed\nthem all,\" suggested Jack. \"But, I say, let's get down to something\nmore practical than theorizing.\"\n\n\"What, for instance?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Looking for something to eat,\" went on Jack. \"I'm nearly starved, and\nI have only half a sandwich left. I want to eat it, yet, if I do, I\ndon't know where I'm going to get more. And as for water, I'd give a\nhandful of diamonds, if I had them, for half a glass of even warm\nwater.\"\n\n\"Yes, we do need food and water badly,\" said Andy.\n\n\"Then let's look for it,\" suggested Jack. \"If we can find food in any\nof these houses or shops, I don't believe the people will care if we\ntake it.\"\n\n\"Find food here?\" cried Mark. \"Why, you must be crazy! All the food is\nturned to stone, and what isn't would be spoiled! Why, no one has been\nalive here for thousands and thousands of years!\"\n\n\"That's nothing,\" asserted Jack. \"Don't you remember reading how, in\nthe arctic regions, they have found the bodies of prehistoric elephants\nand mastodons encased in blocks of ice, where they have been for\ncenturies. The meat is perfectly preserved because of the cold. And\nwhat of the grains of wheat they find in the coffins of Egyptian\nmummies? Some of that is three thousand years old, yet it grows when\nthey plant it, and they can make bread of it.\n\n\"Now, maybe we can find some wheat or something to eat in some of these\nhouses. If there's meat, it will be perfectly preserved, for the\ntemperature is below freezing.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" admitted Mark, convinced, in spite of himself, \"but it's\nturned to stone, I tell you.\"\n\n\"The outside part may be,\" said Jack, \"but if we can crack off the\noutside layer of stone we may find some good meat inside. I'm going to\nlook, anyhow.\"\n\n\"That's not a bad idea!\" cried Andy with enthusiasm. \"Think of having a\nloaf of bread and some beefsteak thousands of years old. I suppose they\nhad beefsteak here,\" he added cautiously.\n\n\"Some kind of meat, anyhow,\" agreed Jack. \"Well, let's look for a place\nthat was once a restaurant or hotel, and we'll see what luck we have.\nCome on.\"\n\nThey walked along the silent streets, with their silent occupants, and\nfinally Jack found what he was seeking. It was an eating place, to\njudge by the appearance, and at tables inside were seated stone men and\nwomen.\n\n\"Back to the kitchen!\" cried Jack with enthusiasm. \"There's where we'll\nfind food, if there is any!\"\n\n\"It'll be all stone,\" declared Mark, but he and Andy followed Jack.\n\nThey came to the place where was what appeared to be a stove. It was\nmore like a brick oven, however, than a modern range, though in dishes\nthat were now stone something was being cooked when the catastrophe\noccurred.\n\n\"There's meat, I'll wager!\" cried Jack, pointing to several objects on\na table. They looked like chunks of beef, but when Mark struck them\nwith the end of his life-torch they gave forth a sound as if a rock had\nbeen tapped.\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" Mark asked, \"Nothing but rocks. And the bread is\nalso a stone,\" he added bitterly.\n\n\"You're right,\" admitted Jack, with a sigh. \"And I'm getting hungrier\nthan ever.\" They all were. For days they had been without sufficient\nfood, and now, when it was almost within their reach, they were denied\nit by this curious trick of nature. With pale and wan faces they gazed\nat each other, wetting their parched lips, for they had some time since\ntaken the last of their scant supply of water, and they were very\nthirsty.\n\n\"I guess it's all up with us,\" murmured Mark. \"We'll soon be like these\npoor people here--blocks of stone.\"\n\n\"If we only could change this meat back into it's original shape,\"\nspoke Jack musingly, smiting his fist against a block of beef.\n\nSuddenly Andy uttered a cry.\n\n\"I have it!\" he fairly shouted.\n\n\"What?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I have a plan to get meat out of this hunk of stone!\"\n\nThe two boys gazed at the old hunter as though they thought he had lost\nhis reason, but, chuckling gleefully, Andy took from his pouch several\ncartridges, and proceeded to remove the wads, and pour the powder from\nthe paper shells out on the stone table.\n\n\"I'll have some meat for us,\" he muttered. \"We shan't starve now!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nTHE BLACK POOL\n\n\n\"What are you going to do, Andy?\" asked Jack, as he watched the old\nhunter.\n\n\"What am I going to do? Why, I'm going to blast out some of this meat,\nthat's what I'm going to do! I heard you boys talking about elephants\nand other things being preserved for centuries in a cake of ice, and,\nif that's true, why won't the meat in this petrified city be preserved\njust as well? It's always below freezing here, and that's cold enough.\"\n\n\"But the meat has turned to stone,\" objected Mark.\n\n\"Only the outside part of it, to my thinking,\" answered Andy. \"I\nbelieve that inside these lumps of rock we'll find good, fresh meat!\"\n\n\"But how are you going to get it?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Just as I told you--blast it out with some of the powder from my\ncartridges. I used to be a miner before I turned hunter, and when we\nwanted gold we used to fire a charge in some rocks. Now we want meat,\nand I'm going to do the same thing. I'll put some powder underneath\nthis block of stone that looks as if it was a chunk of roast beef, and\nwe'll see what happens. It's lucky I saved some of my cartridges.\"\n\nWhile he was talking the old hunter had taken some of the powder and\nput it back in one of the paper shells. Then, making a fuse by twisting\nsome powder grains in a piece of paper he happened to have in his\npocket, he inserted it in the improvised bomb, using some dirt and\nsmall stones with which to tamp down the charge. He discovered a crack\nin the big stone, which they hoped would prove to be a chunk of roast\nbeef, and Andy put the cartridge in that.\n\n\"Look out now, boys,\" he called, \"I'm going to light the fuse. I didn't\nmake a heavy charge, but it might do some damage, so we'll go outside.\"\n\nThey hurried from the place, with its silent guests and waiters, and\nreached the street. A moment later there sounded a dull explosion.\n\n\"Now, let's see what we've got!\" called Jack.\n\nBack to the kitchen they ran, the two boys in the lead.\n\n\"Why--why--the stone has disappeared!\" cried Jack, in disappointment,\nas he glanced all around.\n\n\"Yes, but look here,\" added Mark. \"Here are bits of meat,\" and he\npicked up from the stone table some scraps of meat.\n\n\"Is it really roast beef?\" cried Jack. \"Good to eat?\"\n\nMark smelled of it. Then he put the morsel cautiously to his lips. The\nnext instant it had disappeared. It was proof enough.\n\n\"Good! I should say it was good!\" exclaimed Mark. \"I wish there was\nmore of it! What happened to the rock of meat, Andy?\"\n\n\"I used too heavy a charge, and it blew all to pieces. I'll know better\nnext time. There are lots more chunks of meat, and we'll soon have a\nfeast. I'll make another bombshell.\"\n\nHe worked rapidly while Jack sampled some of the shreds of meat that\nhad been scattered about by the explosion. The beef was perfectly\ncooked, and in spite of its great age it was as fresh and palatable as\nfrozen meat ever is. Besides the heat generated by the explosion had\npartly thawed it, so that there was no trouble in chewing it.\n\nOnce more came the explosion, a slight one this time, and when the\nadventurers re-entered the kitchen they found that what had been a lump\nof stone had been broken open, and the middle part, like the kernel of\na nut, was sweet and good. It was cooked, so they did not have to eat\nit raw.\n\n\"Say, maybe this isn't good!\" exclaimed Jack, chewing away. \"It's the\nbest ever!\"\n\n\"And there's enough in this city to keep us alive for months, if we\ncan't find the projectile in that time,\" declared Andy.\n\n\"Don't you think we will?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Of course, but I was only just mentioning it. Now, eat all you want,\nboys, I have quite a few cartridges left. I didn't fire away as many as\nI thought I did, and we can blast out a dinner any time we want it. So\neat hearty!\"\n\nThey needed no second invitation, and for the first time in several\ndays they had enough to eat. It was comfortable in the petrified\nrestaurant, too, for they could move about without carrying their\nlife-torches constantly in their hand. The gases from the perforated\nboxes filled the rooms, and were not quickly dispelled by the poisonous\nvapors as they were outside, so they could walk around in comparative\nfreedom.\n\n\"Now, if we could only blast out a loaf of bread, we'd be all right,\"\nsaid Jack. They found some petrified loaves, but on breaking one open\nit was found to be stone all the way through.\n\nSpurred on by an overwhelming thirst, they wandered about the dead\ncity, but found no moisture. They tried to chew some of the pale green\nvegetation that grew more plentiful on this side of the moon, but it\nwas exceedingly bitter, and they could not stand it, though there was\nsome juice in it.\n\nThey crossed the city, and wandered out into the country beyond. It\nappeared to have been a fertile land before the stone death settled\ndown on it. They saw farmers in the fields, turned into images, beside\nthe oxen with which they had been plowing. But nowhere was there a sign\nof water. Had it not been for a frozen rice pudding, they would have\nperished that first day in the stone city.\n\nAs it was, they dragged out a miserable existence, eating from time to\ntime of the blasted meat. But even this palled on them after a while,\nfor their lips were parched and cracked, and their tongues were swollen\nin their mouths.\n\n\"I can't stand this any longer!\" cried Jack.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Go out and look for water. There must be some in the country outside\nif there isn't any in this city. I'm going to have a look. Besides, if\nI'm going to die, I might as well die while I'm busy. I'm not going to\nsit here in this dreadful place and give up.\"\n\nHis words urged them to follow him, and, with lagging steps, for they\nwere weak and faint, they went from the restaurant, which they had made\ntheir home since coming to the petrified city.\n\nOut into the open fields they went, but their search seemed likely to\nbe in vain. Between times of looking for the water they scanned the sky\nfor a sight of the projectile, which, hoping against hope, they thought\nthey might see hovering over them. But there was no sight of it.\n\nThey came to a vast, level plain, girt with mountains, a lonesome\nplace, where there was no sign of life. Listlessly they walked over it.\n\nSuddenly Andy, who was in the lead, uttered a cry and sprang forward.\nThe boys ran to him, and found the old hunter gazing into the depths of\na great black pool, which filled a depression in the surface of the\nmoon. It was a small crater, and was filled, nearly to the top, with\nsome black liquid, which gloomily reflected back the light of the sun.\n\n\"I'm going to have a drink!\" cried Andy, and before the boys could stop\nhim he threw himself face downward at the edge of the black pool.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nTHE SIGNAL FAILS\n\n\n\"Stop! Don't drink that! It may be poison!\" yelled Jack.\n\n\"Pull him back!\" shouted Mark, and together they advanced on the old\nhunter. They tried to drag him away from the black pool, but Andy shook\nthem off.\n\n\"Let--me--alone!\" he gasped, as he bent over the uninviting liquid and\ndrank deeply. \"It's water, I tell you--good water--and I'm\nalmost--dead--from--thirst!\"\n\n\"Water? Is that water?\" cried Jack.\n\n\"Well, it's the nearest thing to it that I've tasted since I've been\nlost on the moon,\" spoke Andy, as he slowly arose. \"My, but that was\ngood!\" he added fervently.\n\n\"But--water?\" gasped Mark. \"How can there be water here?\"\n\n\"Taste and see,\" invited the old hunter.\n\nThey hesitated a moment, and then followed his example. The\nliquid--water it evidently had once been--had a peculiar taste, but it\nwas not bad. By some curious chemical action, which they never\nunderstood, the liquid had been prevented from evaporating, nor was it\nfrozen or petrified as was everything else on the moon.\n\nWhat gave the liquid its peculiar black color they could not learn.\nSufficient for them that it was capable of quenching their thirst, and\nthey all drank deeply and refilled their bottles.\n\n\"Now, I feel like eating again,\" spoke Andy, \"We can take some of this\nback with us, and have a good meal on blasted meat. Whenever we get\nthirsty we'll have to make a trip back here for water.\"\n\nThe boys agreed with him. They examined the black pool. It appeared to\nbe filled by hidden springs, though there was no bubbling, and the\nsurface was as unruffled as a mirror. The liquid was not very inviting,\nbeing as black as ink, but the color appeared to be a sort of\nreflection, for when the water, if such it was, had been put into\nbottles it at once became clear, nor did it stain their faces or hands.\n\n\"Well, it's another queer thing in this queer moon,\" said Jack. \"I wish\nthe two professors could see this place. They'd have lots to write\nabout.\"\n\n\"I wonder if we'll ever see them again?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Sure,\" replied Jack hopefully. \"We'll fill our lunch baskets, take a\nlot of water along, and have another hunt for the projectile soon.\"\n\nThey did, but with no success. For several days more they lived in the\npetrified city, the meat encased in its block of stone, which Andy\nblasted from time to time, and the black water keeping them alive. From\ntime to time they went out in the surrounding country, looking for the\nprojectile. But they could not find the place where they had left it,\nnor could they find even the place where they had picked up the lost\ntool that had cost them so much suffering. They were more completely\nlost than ever. They crossed back and forth on the bridge over the\ncrater chasm, and penetrated for many miles in a radius from that,\nmarking their way by chipping off pieces of the rocky pinnacles, as\nthey did not want to leave the petrified city behind.\n\nFrom some peaks they caught glimpses of other towns that had fallen\nunder the strange spell of the petrification. Some were larger and some\nsmaller than the one they called \"home.\"\n\nJack proposed visiting some of them, thinking they might find better\nfood, but Mark and Andy decided it was best to stay where they were, as\nthey were nearer the supposed location of the projectile.\n\n\"I think they'll manage to fix it up somehow, so it will move,\" said\nAndy, \"and then they'll come to look for us. I hope it will be soon,\nthough.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Jack, struck by something in the tone of the old hunter.\n\n\"Because,\" replied Andy, \"I am afraid our life-torches won't last much\nlonger. Mine seems to be weakening. I have to hold it very close to my\nface now to breathe in comfort, while at first the oxygen from it was\nso strong that I could hold it two feet off and never notice the\npoisonous moon vapors.\"\n\nThis was a new danger, and, thinking of it, the faces of the boys\nbecame graver than ever. Death seemed bound to get them somehow.\n\nTwo more days went by. They had now been lost on the moon over a week.\nEach one now noticed that his life-torch was weakening. How much longer\nwould they last? They dared not answer that question. They could only\nhope.\n\nThe sun, too, was moving away from them. Soon the long night would set\nin. By Mark's computation there was only three more days of daylight\nleft. What would happen in the desolate darkness?\n\nAs they were returning from the black pool, with their water bottles\nfilled, and put inside the fur bags to prevent the frost from reaching\nthem, Mark happened to gaze over across a line of towering peaks. What\nhe saw caused him to gasp in astonishment.\n\n\"Jack! Andy! See!\" he whispered hoarsely, pointing a trembling finger\nat the sky.\n\nThere, outlined against the cloudless heavens, was a long, black shape,\nfloating through the air about two miles distant.\n\n\"The projectile! The _Annihilator!_\" yelled Jack. \"Shout! Call to them!\nWave your hands! Andy, fire your gun! They have started off, and they\ncan't see us. We must make them hear!\"\n\nTogether they raised their voices in a mighty shout. The old hunter\nfired his gun several times. They waved their hands frantically.\n\nBut the projectile never swerved from its course. On it moved slowly,\nthose in it paying no heed to the wanderers, for they did not hear\nthem. Andy fired his gun again, but the signal failed, and a few\nminutes later the _Annihilator_ was lost to sight behind a great peak.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nTHE FIELD OF DIAMONDS\n\n\nDumbly the wanderers gazed at each other. They could not comprehend it\nat first. That the projectile, on which their very lives depended in\nthis dead world of the moon, should float away and leave them seemed\nincredible. Yet they had witnessed it.\n\n\"Do--do you really think we saw it--saw the _Annihilator_, Mark?\" asked\nJack in a low voice, after several minutes had passed.\n\n\"Saw it? Of course, we saw it. We've seen the last of it, I'm afraid.\nBut what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I--I thought maybe I was out of my head, and I only saw a vision,\"\nanswered Jack. \"You know--a sort of mirage. It was real, then?\"\n\n\"Altogether too real,\" spoke Andy Sudds grimly. \"They didn't see us nor\nhear us. We're left behind!\"\n\n\"But can't we do something?\" demanded Mark. \"Let's start off and try to\ncatch them. They were going slow.\"\n\n\"The wonder to me is how they moved at all,\" said Jack. \"I thought the\nmachinery wouldn't work until we got back with the lost tool.\"\n\n\"Probably the two professors found some way of patching up the motor,\"\nwas Mark's opinion, and later they found that this was so.\n\nFor some time they remained staring in the direction in which the\nprojectile had vanished, as if they might see it reappear, but the\ngreat steel shell did not poke its sharp nose in among the towering\npeaks which hid it from view. Probably it was many miles away now.\n\n\"Well,\" remarked old Andy at length, \"we've got to make the best of it.\nWe won't have many more days of light, and we must gather what food we\ncan, put it where we can find it in the dark, and also bring in some\nwater from the black pool. We can store that in some of the stone\ntables. By turning them upside down they will make good troughs, and it\nwon't freeze. We must work while we have light, for soon the long night\nwill come.\"\n\nThe sight of the projectile going away seemed to take the heart out of\nall of them, and they did not know what to do. For some time they\nremained there idly, until Andy roused the boys to a sense of their\nresponsibility by urging upon them the necessity of getting together a\nstore of meat and water.\n\nAs they had about exhausted the limited food supply in the ancient\nrestaurant, they sought and found another and larger one. There they\nhad the good fortune to come upon some whole sides of beef and lamb,\nwhich were petrified on the outside, but which, when they had blasted\noff the outer shell of stone, gave them good food.\n\nThey made several trips to the black pool, and brought in all the\nliquid they could, for they did not want to have to go outside the\npetrified city into the wild and desolate country beyond, after the\ndismal night had settled down. They feared they would become lost again.\n\nTheir lonely situation seemed to grow upon them. The appalling silence\nall about terrified them. The weird sight of the petrified men and\nwomen in the petrified city got on their nerves.\n\nThey had done all they could. A store of meat had been blasted out and\nput away. It would keep outside of the stone shell now, for the weather\nwas getting colder with the advent of the long night.\n\nThis fact worried them. With the temperature at twenty-eight when the\nsun was shining, what might it not fall to in the darkness? The\nterrible cold of the arctic regions might be nothing compared to the\nfrostiness of the dead moon in the shadow. Their fur garments, thick as\nthey were, might be no more protection than so much paper. And they had\nno means of making a fire, nor anything to burn on one had they been\ncapable of kindling it, for Andy had used the last of his cartridges to\nblast with, and where everything was petrified there was no wood.\n\nThen, too, their life-torches were giving out. The emanations of oxygen\nwere weaker, and they had to hold them almost under their noses to\nbreathe the vital vapor.\n\nOne day, or rather what corresponded to a day, for they had lost all\ntrack of time, Andy Sudds arose from the stone bench on which their\nmeager meal had been served. He started from the restaurant where they\nhad taken up their abode.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I'm going to make one last attempt to find the projectile before it\ngets too dark,\" answered the hunter. \"We can go out, look around for\nseveral hours, and get back before darkness sets in. We might as well\ndo it as sit here doing nothing. Then, too, we can bring in some more\nwater. We'll need all we can store away.\"\n\n\"I'll go with you,\" volunteered Jack, and Mark, not wanting to be left\nalone in the dead city, followed. Carrying their life-torches and\nwrapping their fur garments closely about them, for it had grown much\ncolder, they sallied forth.\n\nThey found a thin film of ice on the black pool, showing that it would\nprobably freeze when it got cold enough, though the ordinary\ntemperature of thirty-two degrees had not affected it. They filled\ntheir water bottles, and then Andy proposed that they take a new\npath--one they had not tried before.\n\nThey hardly knew where they were going, but ever as they tramped on\nthey cast anxious looks upward to see if they might descry the\nprojectile hovering over them. But they did not see it.\n\nJack had taken the lead, and was walking along, glancing idly about. He\ncame to a place where two peaks were so close together that it was all\nhe could do to squeeze through. But the moment he had passed the defile\nand looked out on a broad, level field, he came to a sudden stop. His\ncompanions, who pressed after him, saw him rub his eyes and shake his\nhead, as if disbelieving the evidence of what lay before him. Then Jack\nmurmured: \"It can't be true! It can't be true!\"\n\n\"What?\" called Mark.\n\n\"There! Those,\" answered his chum. \"See, the field is covered with\ndiamonds! We have found the diamonds of the moon--the field of Reonaris\nthat the men of Mars discovered! There are the diamonds--millions of\nthem!\"\n\n\"Diamonds!\" exclaimed Mark. He squeezed through the defile, and stood\nbeside Jack. Before him in the fading light of the sun was a broad\nfield, girt around with towering cliffs, and the surface of the field\nwas covered with white stones.\n\nJack sprang forward and gathered up a double handful. He let them run\nthrough his fingers in a sparkling stream. Old Andy came up to the boys.\n\n\"They're only glass or crystals,\" he said.\n\n\"They are _not_ glass or crystals!\" declared Mark, who had made a study\nof gems. \"I should say they were diamonds, probably meteoric diamonds,\nvery rare and valuable. Why, there is the ransom of a thousand kings\nspread out before us!\"\n\nHe fell upon his knees and began to scoop up the gems. His chum was\nmaking a little heap of the stones.\n\n\"The ransom of a thousand kings!\" murmured Jack. \"More diamonds than in\nall the world--and I'd give my share for a good ham sandwich!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nBACK TO EARTH--CONCLUSION\n\n\nAt any other time the discovery of such a vast store of wealth would\nhave set the wanderers half wild with joy. Now they only accepted the\nfact dully, for the perils of their situation overburdened them. As\nJack had said, they needed food more than the gems, for at best the\nsupply they had blasted out could not last long, and when that was gone\nwhere were they to get more, for there were no more cartridges, and the\nrending force of powder was needed to open the rocky meat.\n\n\"I knew we'd find the diamonds,\" murmured Jack, as he began to fill the\npockets of his fur coat. \"I'm right, after all, Mark, you see.\"\n\n\"Yes, but what good will it do us? What's the good of even carrying any\naway. We can never use them.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" agreed Jack, in a low voice. \"I might as well leave them\nhere.\"\n\nBut somehow the desire to pick up gems which, when they were cut and\npolished, would rival many of the famous diamonds of history was too\nstrong to be resisted. Though he was afraid he would never get back to\nearth to enjoy them, Jack could not help putting in his pockets a\ngoodly supply of the largest of the precious stones. Andy did the same,\nand Mark, in spite of his gloomy feelings, stuffed his pockets. They\nworked with their torches held close to their faces, and in the search\nfor the better stones they literally walked over millions of dollars'\nworth of the gems.\n\nFor there, stretched out before them, was an actual field of diamonds.\nAs Mark had said, they were of meteoric origin, that is, a meteor had\nburst over that particular portion of the moon, and the chemical action\nhad created the diamonds, which had fallen in a shower in the field.\n\n\"If you boys have all you want, then let's get back to the city,\"\nsuggested Andy. \"No telling when it will be night now.\"\n\nThey followed his advice, and soon were going back by way of the black\npool. It seemed more lonesome than ever, after the excitement of\ndiscovering the field of diamonds, and even Jack, glad as he was to\nhave his theory vindicated, got tired of referring to it. His triumph\nmeant little to him now.\n\nThey were at the entrance to the petrified city. As they were about to\ngo in, ready to hide themselves in the deepest part of the restaurant,\naway from the terrible cold and appalling darkness they felt would soon\nbe upon them, Mark came to a sudden halt. He glanced quickly up into\nthe air and cried out: \"Hark!\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Jack, as they stood in a listening attitude.\n\n\"I heard a noise,\" whispered Mark. \"It sounded--I'm sure it\nsounded--like the crackling of the wireless motor waves of the\nprojectile. Listen!\"\n\nFaintly through the silence came a sound as if there was a discharge of\nan electric current. It increased in volume, and there was a faint\nroaring in the atmosphere.\n\n\"It's her--it's the _Annihilator!_\" shouted Jack, leaping about.\n\n\"Wait,\" counselled Andy, who dreaded the terrible disappointment should\nthe boys be mistaken. The sound came nearer. The crackling could\nplainly be made out now. The sun was out of sight, but there was still\nthe glow which follows sunset.\n\nThe boys were eagerly scanning the heavens, Their hearts beat high with\nhope. Suddenly, in the olive-tinted sky just above a range of rugged\npeaks, a black shape loomed. A black shape, as of a great cigar,\npointed at both ends. It shot into full view.\n\n\"The projectile!\" yelled Jack.\n\n\"The _Annihilator!_\" gasped Mark.\n\n\"Thank Heaven, they have found us in time!\" exclaimed Andy fervently,\nand the three stretched out their arms toward the craft from which they\nhad been parted so long. It was as if they tried to pull it down to\nthem.\n\n\"Do they see us?\"\n\n\"Will they pass us by?\"\n\n\"Make a noise so they'll hear us!\"\n\n\"Wave to them!\"\n\n\"Oh, if they leave us now!\"\n\nQuestions, ejaculations and entreaties came rapidly from the lips of\nthe wanderers. They raised their voices in a shout. They leaped up and\ndown. They wildly waved their hands and life-torches.\n\nThen, to their inexpressible joy, they saw the course of the projectile\nchange. It was headed toward them, and a few minutes later it settled\nslowly to the ground about half a mile away.\n\n\"Come on!\" cried Jack! \"We must hurry to them, or soon it will be too\ndark to see them, or for them to find us. It's our last chance; don't\nlet's lose it!\"\n\nHe sprang forward, the others after him, and together they ran toward\nthe projectile. They could see the two professors and Washington White\nemerging from the steel car, waving their hands.\n\nOn rushed the lost wanderers, over the rough stones, skirting the great\ncliffs, falling into small craters, crawling out again, just missing\nseveral times being precipitated into yawning caverns, and stumbling\nover petrified bodies that strewed the ground.\n\nEver did they hasten onward though, increasing their speed. They came\nto a great crater that lay between them and the projectile, but\nfortunately there was across the middle of it a natural bridge of\nstone. But it was narrow--scarcely wide enough for one at a time.\n\n\"We can never cross on that!\" cried Mark, halting.\n\n\"We've got to!\" shouted Jack, and he sprang fearlessly forward, fairly\nrunning over the narrow path, which had a sheer descent of thousands of\nfeet on either side.\n\nMark, though fearful that he would become dizzy and fall, followed\nAndy. They were soon across the narrow bridge, and speeding on toward\nthe _Annihilator_. Five minutes later they had reached it, and were\nbeing wildly welcomed by the two professors and Washington White, who\nhad advanced to meet them.\n\n\"I 'clar t' goodness-gladness!\" exclaimed the colored man, \"I am\nsuttinly constrained t' espress my approbation ob de deleterous manner\nin which yo' all has come back t' dis continuous territory.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you're glad to see us, Wash?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Dat's what I done said,\" was the answer, with a cheerful grin, \"an' I\nmight also remark dat dinner am serbed in de dinin' car.\"\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Jack. \"That's the best news I've heard in a week. No\nmore blasted beef for mine! Give me ham and eggs!\"\n\n\"But what happened to you? Where have you been? We have searched all\nover for you, and were just giving you up for dead, and going back to\nthe earth,\" said Professor Henderson. \"We caught sight of you at the\nlast minute.\"\n\n\"Oh, you mustn't go back until you go to the field of diamonds!\" cried\nJack, and then by turns he and Mark and Andy told of their terrible\nadventures while they were lost on the moon.\n\nOn their part Professors Roumann and Henderson stated how they had\nwaited in vain for the return of the wanderers, and had then, by\nstrenuous work, managed to make the necessary repairs without the\nmissing tool. Then they set out to discover the lost ones, but\nsucceeded only just in time, for it was now quite dusk.\n\n\"An' did yo' all really discober dem sparklers?\" asked Washington, as\nhe served what the boys thought was the finest dinner they had ever\ntasted.\n\n\"We sure did,\" replied Jack. \"Here are a couple for that red necktie of\nyours,\" and he passed over two big diamonds.\n\nIt did not take long to move the projectile to the field of the\nsparkling gems, and by means of a powerful search-light enough were\nsoon gathered up to satisfy even Washington White, who declared that he\nwould be the best decorated colored man in Bayside when they got back.\nThe two professors made what observations they could in the petrified\ncity in the fast-gathering darkness, and then, having taken a petrified\nman into the projectile with them to deposit in a scientific museum in\nwhich Professor Roumann was interested, the _Annihilator_ was sealed\nshut.\n\nAnd it was only just in time, for with the suddenness of an eclipse\nintense darkness settled down, and the temperature, as indicated by a\nthermometer thrust outside, showed a drop of a hundred degrees.\n\n\"We never could have lived out there,\" said Jack.\n\n\"Well, we'll soon be back on earth,\" observed Mark, and a little later\nthe Cardite motor was out in operation, and the journey back to this\nworld begun.\n\nLittle of moment happened on the return trip. The boys went more into\ndetail about their wanderings, and told how they had managed to live\nduring the time they were lost. The two professors and Washington spoke\nof their worry and anxiety, and their vain search for the wanderers.\n\nAs they were anxious to get back home, the motor was speeded to the\nlimit, and in much less time than they had made the trip to the moon\nthey had arrived in sight of the earth again. As they did not want to\ncreate too much excitement, they hovered about in the air over Bayside\nuntil dark, when they gently descended almost in the very spot from\nwhich they had started.\n\n\"Well,\" remarked Jack, as he stepped out on the earth once more, \"it\nwas quite an experience to go to the moon, and I suppose being lost\nthere wasn't the worst thing that could happen to us, but all the same\nI'm glad to be back.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" declared Mark. \"It was worth while going,\" and he felt of\nhis pocketful of diamonds.\n\n\"We certainly made some very valuable scientific observations,\"\nasserted Mr. Henderson, \"and we will be able to prove that the moon was\nonce inhabited.\"\n\nWashington White was carefully lifting out his Shanghai rooster, which\nwas uttering loud crows. As soon as he had set the fowl on the ground,\nthe colored man started off.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"I'm going t' a jewelery shop t' hab my diamonds made inter a stick-pin\nfo' my red necktie,\" was the answer.\n\n\"Oh, you'd better wait until morning,\" suggested Professor Henderson.\n\nThey gathered about the table in the cozy dining room of their home,\nwhile Washington got a meal ready. Every one was talking about what a\nwonderful trip they had had.\n\n\"The only trouble is,\" said Jack, \"that we've been to about all the\ninteresting places in this universe now. I wonder where we can go next?\"\n\n\"I'm going to bed right after supper,\" announced Mark. \"Maybe I'll\ndiscover a new land in my dreams.\"\n\nThe moon voyagers had a great store of gems, and, as they did not wish\nto bring down values by disposing of them, they only sold a few, which,\nbecause of their great size and brilliancy, brought a large price.\nSeveral jewelers wanted to know where the diamonds came from, but the\nsecret was well kept. Most of the gems were used for scientific\npurposes, but Mark and Jack gave some to certain of their friends.\n\nThe petrified man proved a great curiosity, and a history of it, in two\nlarge volumes, can be seen in the museum where the body is exhibited.\nProfessor Henderson wrote the account, and also published quite an\nextensive history of the trip to the moon, which was considered by\nscientists and laymen to be a most remarkable journey.\n\nBut, though our friends had been to many strange places, it was\nreserved for them to have yet still more wonderful adventures, though\nfor a time after returning from the moon they remained at home, the two\nprofessors busy over their scientific work, and the boys engaged with\ntheir studies, while Andy occasionally went hunting, and Washington got\nthe meals and, between times, fed his rooster and admired the diamonds\nin his red necktie. And now we will bid our friends good-by.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Lost on the Moon, by Roy Rockwood\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LOST ON THE MOON ***\n\n***** This file should be named 7473-8.txt or 7473-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/7/4/7/7473/\n\nProduced by Anne Soulard, Tiffany Vergon, Joshua Hutchinson\nand the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
