That was the man who had caused so much trouble in the\nJovian elections. The troublemaker who had shouted for an investigation\nof Interplanetary Power. The man who had said that Spencer Chambers and\nInterplanetary Power were waging economic war against the people of the\nSolar System.\n\nChambers smiled. With long, well-kept fingers, he rubbed his iron-gray\nmustache.\n\nJohn Moore Mallory was right; for that reason, he was a dangerous man.\nPrison was the place for him, but probably a prison outside the Jovian\nconfederacy. Perhaps one of the prison ships that plied to the edge of\nthe System, clear to the orbit of Pluto. Or would the prison on Mercury\nbe better?\n\nSpencer Chambers leaned back in his chair and matched his fingertips,\nstaring at them, frowning again.\n\nMercury was a hard place. A man's life wasn't worth much there. Working\nin the power plants, where the Sun poured out its flaming blast of heat,\nand radiations sucked the energy from one's body, in six months, a year\nat most, any man was finished.\n\nChambers shook his head. Not Mercury. He had nothing against Mallory. He\nhad never met the man but he rather liked him. Mallory was just a man\nfighting for a principle, the same as Chambers was doing.\n\nHe was sorry that it had been necessary to put Mallory in prison. If the\nman only had listened to reason, had accepted the proposals that had\nbeen made, or just had dropped out of sight until the Jovian elections\nwere over ... or at least had moderated his charges. But when he had\nattempted to reveal the offers, which he termed bribery, something had\nto be done.\n\nLudwig Stutsman had handled that part of it. Brilliant fellow, this\nStutsman, but as mean a human as ever walked on two legs. A man utterly\nwithout mercy, entirely without principle. A man who would stoop to any\ndepth. But a useful man, a good one to have around to do the dirty work.\nAnd dirty work sometimes was necessary.\n\nChambers picked up the spacegram again and studied it. Stutsman, out on\nCallisto now, had sent it. He was doing a good job out there. The Jovian\nconfederacy, less than one Earth year under Interplanetary domination,\nwas still half rebellious, still angry at being forced to turn over its\ngovernment to the hand-picked officials of Chambers' company. An iron\nheel was needed and Stutsman was that iron heel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo the people on the Jovian satellites wanted the release of John Moore\nMallory. \"They're getting ugly,\" the spacegram said. It had been a\nmistake to confine Mallory to Callisto. Stutsman should have thought of\nthat.\n\nChambers would instruct Stutsman to remove Mallory from the Callisto\nprison, place him on one of the prison ships. Give instructions to the\ncaptain to make things comfortable for him. When this furor had blown\nover, after things had quieted down in the Jovian confederacy, it might\nbe possible to release Mallory. After all, the man wasn't really guilty\nof any crime. It was a shame that he should be imprisoned when\nracketeering rats like Scorio went scot-free right here in New York.\n\nA buzzer purred softly and Chambers reached out to press a stud.\n\n\"Dr. Craven to see you,\" his secretary said. \"You asked to see him, Mr.\nChambers.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Chambers. \"Send him right in.\"\n\nHe clicked the stud again, picked up his pen, wrote out a spacegram to\nStutsman, and signed it.\n\nDr. Herbert Craven stood just inside the door, his black suit wrinkled\nand untidy, his sparse sandy hair standing on end.\n\n\"You sent for me,\" he said sourly.\n\n\"Sit down, Doctor,\" invited Chambers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCraven sat down. He peered at Chambers through thick-lensed glasses.\n\n\"I haven't much time,\" he declared acidly.\n\n\"Cigar?\" Chambers offered.\n\n\"Never smoke.\"\n\n\"A drink, then?\"\n\n\"You know I don't drink,\" snapped Craven.\n\n\"Doctor,\" said Chambers, \"you're the least sociable man I've ever known.\nWhat do you do to enjoy yourself?\"\n\n\"I work,\" said Craven. \"I find it interesting.\"\n\n\"You must. You even begrudge the time it takes to talk with me.\"\n\n\"I won't deny it. What do you want this time?\"\n\nChambers swung about to face him squarely across the desk. There was a\ncold look in the financier's gray eyes and his lips were grim.\n\n\"Craven,\" he said, \"I don't trust you. I've never trusted you. Probably\nthat's no news to you.\"\n\n\"You don't trust anyone,\" countered Craven. \"You're watching everybody\nall the time.\"\n\n\"You sold me a gadget I didn't need five years ago,\" said Chambers. \"You\noutfoxed me and I don't hold it against you. In fact, it almost made me\nadmire you. Because of that I put you under a contract, one that you and\nall the lawyers in hell can't break, because someday you'll find\nsomething valuable, and when you do, I want it. A million a year is a\nhigh price to pay to protect myself against you, but I think it's worth\nit. If I didn't think so, I'd have turned you over to Stutsman long ago.\nStutsman knows how to handle men like you.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" said Craven, \"that you've found I'm working on something I\nhaven't reported to you.\"\n\n\"That's exactly it.\"\n\n\"You'll get a report when I have something to report. Not before.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Chambers. \"I just wanted you to know.\"\n\nCraven got to his feet slowly. \"These talks with you are so refreshing,\"\nhe remarked.\n\n\"We'll have to have them oftener,\" said Chambers.\n\nCraven banged the door as he went out.\n\nChambers stared after him. A queer man, the most astute scientific mind\nanywhere, but not a man to be trusted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe president of Interplanetary Power rose from his chair and walked to\nthe window. Below spread the roaring inferno of New York, greatest city\nin the Solar System, a strange place of queer beauty and weighty\nmaterialism, dreamlike in its super-skyscraper construction, but\nutilitarian in its purpose, for it was a port of many planets.\n\nThe afternoon sunlight slanted through the window, softening the\niron-gray hair of the man who stood there. His shoulders almost blocked\nthe window, for he had the body of a fighting man, one, moreover, in\ngood condition. His short-clipped mustache rode with an air of dignity\nabove his thin, rugged mouth.\n\nHis eyes looked out on the city, but did not see it. Through his brain\nwent the vision of a dream that was coming true. His dream spun its\nfragile net about the planets of the Solar System, about their moons,\nabout every single foot of planetary ground where men had gone to build\nand create a second homeland--the mines of Mercury and the farms of\nVenus, the pleasure-lands of Mars and the mighty domed cities on the\nmoons of Jupiter, the moons of Saturn and the great, cold laboratories\nof Pluto.\n\nPower was the key, supplied by the accumulators owned and rented by\nInterplanetary Power. A monopoly of power. Power that Venus and Mercury\nhad too much of, must sell on the market, and that the other planets and\nsatellites needed. Power to drive huge spaceships across the void, to\nturn the wheels of industry, to heat the domes on colder worlds. Power\nto make possible the life and functioning of mankind on hostile worlds.\n\nIn the great power plants of Mercury and Venus, the accumulators were\ncharged and then shipped out to those other worlds where power was\nneeded. Accumulators were rented, never sold. Because they belonged at\nall times to Interplanetary Power, they literally held the fate of all\nthe planets in their cells.\n\nA few accumulators were manufactured and sold by other smaller\ncompanies, but they were few and the price was high. Interplanetary saw\nto that. When the cry of monopoly was raised, Interplanetary could point\nto these other manufacturers as proof that there was no restraint of\ntrade. Under the statute no monopoly could be charged, but the cost of\nmanufacturing accumulators alone was protection against serious\ncompetition from anyone.\n\nUpon a satisfactory, efficient power-storage device rested the success\nor failure of space travel itself. That device and the power it stored\nwere for sale by Interplanetary ... and, to all practical purposes, by\nInterplanetary only.\n\nAccordingly, year after year, Interplanetary had tightened its grip upon\nthe Solar System. Mercury was virtually owned by the company. Mars and\nVenus were little more than puppet states. And now the government of the\nJovian confederacy was in the hands of men who acknowledged Spencer\nChambers as their master. On Earth the agents and the lobbyists\nrepresenting Interplanetary swarmed in every capital, even in the\ncapital of the Central European Federation, whose people were dominated\nby an absolute dictatorship. For even Central Europe needed\naccumulators.\n\n\"Economic dictatorship,\" said Spencer Chambers to himself. \"That's what\nJohn Moore Mallory called it.\" Well, why not? Such a dictatorship would\ninsure the best business brains at the heads of the governments, would\ngive the Solar System a business administration, would guard against the\nmistakes of popular government.\n\nDemocracies were based on a false presumption--the theory that all\npeople were fit to rule. It granted intelligence where there was no\nintelligence. It presumed ability where there was not the slightest\ntrace of any. It gave the idiot the same political standing as the wise\nman, the crackpot the same political opportunity as the man of\nwell-grounded common sense, the weakling the same voice as the strong\nman. It was government by emotion rather than by judgment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpencer Chambers' face took on stern lines. There was no softness left\nnow. The late afternoon sunlight painted angles and threw shadows and\ncreated highlights that made him look almost like a granite mask on a\nsolid granite body.\n\nThere was no room for Mallory's nonsense in a dynamic, expanding\ncivilization. No reason to kill him--even he might have value under\ncertain circumstances, and no really efficient executive destroys\nvalue--but he had to be out of the way where his mob-rousing tongue\ncould do no damage. The damned fool! What good would his idiotic\nidealism do him on a prison spaceship?\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER TWO_\n\n\nRussell Page squinted thoughtful eyes at the thing he had created--a\ntransparent cloud, a visible, sharply outlined cloud of _something_. It\nwas visible as a piece of glass is visible, as a globe of water is\nvisible. There it lay, within his apparatus, a thing that shouldn't be.\n\n\"I believe we have something there, Harry,\" he said slowly.\n\nHarry Wilson sucked at the cigarette that drooped from the corner of his\nmouth, blew twin streams of smoke from his nostrils. His eyes twitched\nnervously.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said. \"Anti-entropy.\"\n\n\"All of that,\" said Russell Page. \"Perhaps a whole lot more.\"\n\n\"It stops all energy change,\" said Wilson, \"as if time stood still and\nthings remained exactly as they were when time had stopped.\"\n\n\"It's more than that,\" Page declared. \"It conserves not only energy _in\ntoto_, not only the energy of the whole, but the energy of the part. It\nis perfectly transparent, yet it has refractive qualities. It won't\nabsorb light because to do so would change its energy content. In that\nfield, whatever is hot stays hot, whatever is cold can't gain heat.\"\n\nHe scraped his hand over a week's growth of beard, considering. From his\npocket he took a pipe and a leather pouch. Thoughtfully he filled the\npipe and lit it.\n\nIt had started with his experiments in Force Field 348, an experiment to\nobserve the effects of heating a conductor in that field. It had been\nimpossible to heat the conductor electrically, for that would have upset\nthe field, changed it, twisted it into something else. So he had used a\nBunsen burner.\n\nThrough half-closed eyes, he still could see that slender strand of\nimperm wire, how its silvery length had turned to red under the blue\nflame. Deep red at first and then brighter until it flamed in almost\nwhite-hot incandescence. And all the while the humming of the\ntransformer as the force field built up. The humming of the transformer\nand the muted roaring of the burner and the glowing heat in the length\nof wire.\n\nSomething had happened then ... an awesome something. A weird wrench as\nif some greater power, some greater law had taken hold. A glove of\nforce, invisible, but somehow sensed, had closed about the wire and\nflame. Instantly the roaring of the burner changed in tone; an odor of\ngas spewed out of the vents at its base. Something had cut off the flow\nof flame in the brass tube. Some force, _something_ ...\n\nThe flame was a transparent cloud. The blue and red of flame and hot\nwire had changed, in the whiplash of a second, to a refractive but\ntransparent cloud that hung there within the apparatus.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe red color had vanished from the wire as the blue had vanished from\nthe flame. The wire was shining. It wasn't silvery; it wasn't white.\nThere was no hint of color, just a refractive blur that told him the\nwire was there. Colorless reflection. _And that meant perfect\nreflection!_ The most perfect reflectors reflect little more than 98 per\ncent of the light incident and the absorption of the two per cent colors\nthose reflectors as copper or gold or chromium. But the imperm wire\nwithin that force field that had been flame a moment before, was\nreflecting _all_ light.\n\nHe had cut the wire with a pair of shears and it had still hung,\nunsupported, in the air, unchanging within the shimmer that constituted\nsomething no man had ever seen before.\n\n\"You can't put energy in,\" said Page, talking to himself, chewing the\nbit of his pipe. \"You can't take energy out. It's still as hot as it\nwas at the moment the change came. But it can't radiate any of that\nheat. It can't radiate any kind of energy.\"\n\nWhy, even the wire was reflective, so that it couldn't absorb energy and\nthus disturb the balance that existed within that bit of space. Not only\nenergy itself was preserved, but the very form of energy.\n\nBut why? That was the question that hammered at him. Why? Before he\ncould go ahead, he had to know why.\n\nPerhaps the verging of the field toward Field 349? Somewhere in between\nthose two fields of force, somewhere within that almost non-existent\nborderline which separated them, he might find the secret.\n\nRising to his feet, he knocked out his pipe.\n\n\"Harry,\" he announced, \"we have work to do.\"\n\nSmoke drooled from Wilson's nostrils.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said.\n\nPage had a sudden urge to lash out and hit the man. That eternal\ndrooling of smoke out of his nostrils, that everlasting cigarette\ndangling limply from one corner of his mouth, the shifty eyes, the dirty\nfingernails, got on his nerves.\n\nBut Wilson was a mechanical genius. His hands were clever despite the\ndirty nails. They could fashion pinhead cameras and three-gram\nelectroscopes or balances capable of measuring the pressure of\nelectronic impacts. As a laboratory assistant he was unbeatable. If only\nhe wouldn't answer every statement or question with that nerve-racking\n'yeah'!\n\nPage stopped in front of a smaller room, enclosed by heavy quartz.\nInside that room was the great bank of mercury-vapor rectifiers. From\nthem lashed a blue-green glare that splashed against his face and\nshoulders, painting him in angry, garish color. The glass guarded him\nfrom the terrific blast of ultra-violet light that flared from the pool\nof shimmering molten metal, a terrible emanation that would have flayed\na man's skin from his body within the space of seconds.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe scientist squinted his eyes against the glare. There was something\nin it that caught him with a deadly fascination. The personification of\npower--the incredibly intense spot of incandescent vapor, the tiny\nsphere of blue-green fire, the spinning surge of that shining pool, the\nintense glare of ionization.\n\nPower ... the breath of modern mankind, the pulse of progress.\n\nIn an adjacent room were the accumulators. Not Interplanetary\naccumulators, which he would have had to rent, but ones he had bought\nfrom a small manufacturer who turned out only ten or fifteen thousand a\nyear ... not enough to bother Interplanetary.\n\nGregory Manning had made it possible for him to buy those accumulators.\nManning had made many things possible in this little laboratory hidden\ndeep within the heart of the Sierras, many miles from any other\nhabitation.\n\nManning's grandfather, Jackson Manning, had first generated the\ncurvature field and overcome gravity, had left his grandson a fortune\nthat approached the five-billion mark. But that had not been all. From\nhis famous ancestor, Manning had inherited a keen, sharp, scientific\nmind. From his mother's father, Anthony Barret, he had gained an astute\nbusiness sense. But unlike his maternal grandfather, he had not turned\nhis attention entirely to business. Old Man Barret had virtually ruled\nWall Street for almost a generation, had become a financial myth linked\nwith keen business sense, with an uncanny ability to handle men and\nmoney. But his grandson, Gregory Manning, had become known to the world\nin a different way. For while he had inherited scientific ability from\none side of the family, financial sense from the other, he likewise had\ninherited from some other ancestor--perhaps remote and unknown--a\nwanderlust that had taken him to the farthest outposts of the Solar\nSystem.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was Gregory Manning who had financed and headed the rescue expedition\nwhich took the first Pluto flight off that dark icebox of a world when\nthe exploration ship had crashed. It was he who had piloted home the\nwinning ship in the Jupiter derby, sending his bulleting craft screaming\naround the mighty planet in a time which set a Solar record. It was\nGregory Manning who had entered the Venusian swamps and brought back,\nalive, the mystery lizard that had been reported there. And he was the\none who had flown the serum to Mercury when the lives of ten thousand\nmen depended upon the thrumming engines that drove the shining ship\ninward toward the Sun.\n\nRussell Page had known him since college days. They had worked out their\nexperiments together in the school laboratories, had spent long hours\narguing and wondering ... debating scientific theories. Both had loved\nthe same girl, both had lost her, and together they had been bitter over\nit ... drowning their bitterness in a three-day drunk that made campus\nhistory.\n\nAfter graduation Gregory Manning had gone on to world fame, had roamed\nover the face of every planet except Jupiter and Saturn, had visited\nevery inhabited moon, had climbed Lunar mountains, penetrated Venusian\nswamps, crossed Martian deserts, driven by a need to see and experience\nthat would not let him rest. Russell Page had sunk into obscurity, had\nburied himself in scientific research, coming more and more to aim his\neffort at the discovery of a new source of power ... power that would be\ncheap, that would destroy the threat of Interplanetary dictatorship.\n\nPage turned away from the rectifier room.\n\n\"Maybe I'll have something to show Greg soon,\" he told himself. \"Maybe,\nafter all these years....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nForty minutes after Page put through the call to Chicago, Gregory\nManning arrived. The scientist, watching for him from the tiny lawn that\nsurrounded the combined home and laboratory, saw his plane bullet into\nsight, scream down toward the little field and make a perfect landing.\n\nHurrying toward the plane as Gregory stepped out of it, Russell noted\nthat his friend looked the same as ever, though it had been a year or\nmore since he had seen him. The thing that was discomfiting about Greg\nwas his apparently enduring youthfulness.\n\nHe was clad in jodhpurs and boots and an old tweed coat, with a\nbrilliant blue stock at his throat. He waved a hand in greeting and\nhurried forward. Russ heard the grating of his boots across the gravel\nof the walk.\n\nGreg's face was bleak; it always was. A clean, smooth face, hard, with\nsomething stern about the eyes.\n\nHis grip almost crushed Russ's hand, but his tone was crisp. \"You\nsounded excited, Russ.\"\n\n\"I have a right to be,\" said the scientist. \"I think I have found\nsomething at last.\"\n\n\"Atomic power?\" asked Manning. There was no flutter of excitement in his\nvoice, just a little hardening of the lines about his eyes, a little\ntensing of the muscles in his cheeks.\n\nRuss shook his head. \"Not atomic energy. If it's anything, it's material\nenergy, the secret of the energy of matter.\"\n\nThey halted before two lawn chairs.\n\n\"Let's sit down here,\" invited Russ. \"I can tell it to you out here,\nshow it to you afterward. It isn't often I can be outdoors.\"\n\n\"It is a fine place,\" said Greg. \"I can smell the pines.\"\n\nThe laboratory perched on a ledge of rugged rock, nearly 7,000 feet\nabove sea level. Before them the land swept down in jagged ruggedness\nto a valley far below, where a stream flashed in the noonday sun. Beyond\nclimbed pine-clad slopes and far in the distance gleamed shimmering\nspires of snow-capped peaks.\n\nFrom his leather jacket Russ hauled forth his pipe and tobacco, lighted\nup.\n\n\"It was this way,\" he said. Leaning back comfortably he outlined the\nfirst experiment. Manning listened intently.\n\n\"Now comes the funny part,\" Russ added. \"I had hopes before, but I\nbelieve this is what put me on the right track. I took a metal rod, a\nwelding rod, you know. I pushed it into that solidified force field, if\nthat is what you'd call it ... although that doesn't describe it. The\nrod went in. Took a lot of pushing, but it went in. And though the field\nseemed entirely transparent, you couldn't see the rod, even after I had\npushed enough of it in so it should have come out the other side. It was\nas if it hadn't entered the sphere of force at all. As if I were just\ntelescoping the rod and its density were increasing as I pushed, like\npushing it back into itself, but that, of course, wouldn't have been\npossible.\"\n\nHe paused and puffed at his pipe, his eyes fixed on the snowy peaks far\nin the purple distance. Manning waited.\n\n\"Finally the rod came out,\" Russ went on. \"Mind you, it came out, even\nafter I would have sworn, if I had relied alone upon my eyes, that it\nhadn't entered the sphere at all. _But it came out ninety degrees\nremoved from its point of entry!_\"\n\n\"Wait a second,\" said Manning. \"This doesn't check. Did you do it more\nthan once?\"\n\n\"I did it a dozen times and the results were the same each time. But you\nhaven't heard the half of it. When I pulled that rod out--yes, I could\npull it out--it was a good two inches shorter than when I had pushed it\nin. I couldn't believe that part of it. It was even harder to believe\nthan that the rod should come out ninety degrees from its point of\nentry. I measured the rods after that and made sure. Kept an accurate\nrecord. Every single one of them lost approximately two inches by being\nshoved into the sphere. Every single one of them repeated the phenomenon\nof curving within the sphere to come out somewhere else than where I had\ninserted them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Any explanation of it?\" asked Manning, and now there was a cold chill\nof excitement in his voice.\n\n\"Theories, no real explanations. Remember that you can't see the rod\nafter you push it into the sphere. It's just as if it isn't there.\nWell, maybe it isn't. You can't disturb anything within that sphere or\nyou'd change the sum of potential-kinetic-pressure energies within it.\nThe sphere seems dedicated to that one thing ... it cannot change. If\nthe rod struck the imperm wire within the field, it would press the wire\ndown, would use up energy, decrease the potential energy. So the rod\nsimply had to miss it somehow. I believe it _moved into some higher\nplane of existence and went around_. And in doing that it had to turn so\nmany corners, so many fourth-dimensional corners, that the length was\nused up. Or maybe it was increased in density. I'm not sure. Perhaps no\none will ever know.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me about this sooner?\" demanded Manning. \"I should\nhave been out here helping you. Maybe I wouldn't be much good, but I\nmight have helped.\"\n\n\"You'll have your chance,\" Russ told him. \"We're just starting. I wanted\nto be sure I had something before I troubled you. I tried other things\nwith that first sphere. I found that metal pushed through the sphere\nwill conduct an electrical current, which is pretty definite proof that\nthe metal isn't within the sphere at all. Glass can be forced through it\nwithout breaking. Not flexible glass, but rods of plain old brittle\nglass. It turns without breaking, and it also loses some of its length.\nWater can be forced through a tube inserted in the sphere, but only when\nterrific pressure is applied. What that proves I can't even begin to\nguess.\"\n\n\"You said you experimented on the first sphere,\" said Manning. \"Have you\nmade others?\"\n\nRuss rose from his chair.\n\n\"Come on in, Greg,\" he said, and there was a grin on his face. \"I have\nsomething you'll have to see to appreciate.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe apparatus was heavier and larger than the first in which Russ had\ncreated the sphere of energy. Fed by a powerful accumulator battery,\nfive power leads were aimed at it, centered in the space between four\ngreat copper blocks.\n\nRuss's hand went out to the switch that controlled the power. Suddenly\nthe power beams flamed, changed from a dull glow into an intense, almost\nintolerable brilliance. A dull grumble of power climbed up to a steady\nwail.\n\nThe beams had changed color, were bluish now, the typical color of\nionized air. They were just power beams, meeting at a common center, but\nsomehow they were queer, too, for though they were capable of slashing\nfar out into space, they were stopped dead. Their might was pouring into\na common center and going no farther. A splash of intensely glowing\nlight rested over them, then began to rotate slowly as a motor somewhere\nhummed softly, cutting through the mad roar and rumble of power that\nsurged through the laboratory.\n\nThe glowing light was spinning more swiftly now. A rotating field was\nbeing established. The power beams began to wink, falling and rising in\nintensity. The sphere seemed to grow, almost filling the space between\nthe copper blocks. It touched one and rebounded slightly toward another.\nIt extended, increased slightly. A terrible screaming ripped through the\nroom, drowning out the titanic din as the spinning sphere came in\ncontact with the copper blocks, as force and metal resulted in weird\nfriction.\n\nWith a shocking wrench the beams went dead, the scream cut off, the roar\nwas gone. A terrifying silence fell upon the room as soon as the\nsuddenly thunking relays opened automatically.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sphere was gone! In its place was a tenuous refraction that told\nwhere it had been. That and a thin layer of perfectly reflective\ncopper ... colorless now, but Manning knew it was copper, for it\nrepresented the continuation of the great copper blocks.\n\nHis mind felt as if it were racing in neutral, getting nowhere. Within\nthat sphere was the total energy that had been poured out by five\ngigantic beams, turned on full, for almost a minute's time. Compressed\nenergy! Energy enough to blast these mountains down to the primal rock\nwere it released instantly. Energy trapped and held by virtue of some\npeculiarity of that little borderline between Force Fields 348 and 349.\n\nRuss walked across the room to a small electric truck with rubber\ncaterpillar treads, driven by a bank of portable accumulators.\nSkillfully the scientist maneuvered it over to the other side of the\nroom, picked up a steel bar four inches in diameter and five feet long.\nHolding it by the handler's magnetic crane, he fixed it firmly in the\narmlike jaws on the front of the machine, then moved the machine into a\nposition straddling the sphere of force.\n\nWith smashing momentum the iron jaws thrust downward, driving the steel\nbar into the sphere. There was a groaning crash as the handler came to a\nhalt, shuddering, with only eight inches of the bar buried in the\nsphere. The stench of hot insulation filled the room while the electric\nmotor throbbed, the rubber treads creaked, the machine groaned and\nstrained, but the bar would go no farther.\n\nRuss shut off the machine and stood back.\n\n\"That gives you an idea,\" he said grimly.\n\n\"The trick now,\" Greg said, \"is to break down the field.\"\n\nWithout a word, Russ reached for the power controls. A sudden roar of\nthunderous fury and the beams leaped at the sphere ... but this time the\nsphere did not materialize again. Again the wrench shuddered through the\nlaboratory, a wrench that seemed to distort space and time.\n\nThen, as abruptly as it had come, it was gone. But when it ended,\nsomething gigantic and incomprehensibly powerful seemed to rush\nsoundlessly by ... something that was felt and sensed. It was like a\ngreat noiseless, breathless wind in the dead of night that rushed by\nthem and through them, all about them in space and died slowly away.\n\nBut the vanished steel did not reappear with the disappearance of the\nsphere and the draining away of power. Almost grotesquely now, the\nhandler stood poised above the place where the sphere had been and in\nits jaws it held the bar. But the end of the bar, the eight inches that\nhad been within the sphere, was gone. It had been sliced off so sharply\nthat it left a highly reflective concave mirror on the severed surface.\n\n\"Where is it?\" demanded Manning. \"In that higher dimension?\"\n\nRuss shook his head. \"You noticed that rushing sensation? That may have\nbeen the energy of matter rushing into some other space. It may be the\nkey to the energy of matter!\"\n\nGregory Manning stared at the bar. \"I'm staying with you, Russ. I'm\nseeing this thing through.\"\n\n\"I knew you would,\" said Russ.\n\nTriumph flamed briefly in Manning's eyes. \"And when we finish, we'll\nhave something that will break Interplanetary. We'll smash their\nstranglehold on the Solar System.\" He stopped and looked at Page. \"Lord,\nRuss,\" he whispered, \"do you realize what we'll have?\"\n\n\"I think I do, Greg,\" the scientist answered soberly. \"Material energy\nengines. Power so cheap that you won't be able to give it away. More\npower than anybody could ever need.\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER THREE_\n\n\nRuss hunched over the keyboard set in the control room of the _Comet_\nand stared down at the keys. The equation was set and ready. All he had\nto do was tap that key and they would know, beyond all argument, whether\nor not they had dipped into the awful heart of material energy; whether,\nfinally, they held in their grasp the key to the release of energy that\nwould give the System power to spare.\n\nHis glance lifted from the keyboard, looked out the observation port.\nThrough the inkiness of space ran a faint blue thread, a tiny line that\nstretched from the ship and away until it was lost in the darkness of\nthe void.\n\nOne hundred thousand miles away, that thread touched the surface of a\nsteel ball bearing ... a speck in the immensity of space.\n\nHe thought about that little beam of blue. It took power to do that,\npower to hold a beam tight and strong and steady through the stress of\none hundred thousand miles. But it had to be that far away ... and they\nhad that power. From the bowels of the ship came the deep purr of it,\nthe angry, silky song of mighty engines throttled down.\n\nHe heard Harry Wilson shuffling impatiently behind him, smelled the\nacrid smoke that floated from the tip of Wilson's cigarette.\n\n\"Might as well punch that key, Russ,\" said Manning's cool voice. \"We\nhave to find out sooner or later.\"\n\nRuss's finger hovered over the key, steadied and held. When he punched\nthat key, if everything worked right, the energy in the tiny ball\nbearing would be released instantaneously. The energy of a piece of\nsteel, weighing less than an ounce. Over that tight beam of blue would\nflash the impulse of destruction....\n\nHis fingers plunged down.\n\nSpace flamed in front of them. For just an instant the void seemed\nfilled with an angry, bursting fire that lapped with hungry tongues of\ncold, blue light toward the distant planets. A flare so intense that it\nwas visible on the Jovian worlds, three hundred million miles away. It\nlighted the night-side of Earth, blotting out the stars and Moon,\nsending astronomers scurrying for their telescopes, rating foot-high\nstreamers in the night editions.\n\nSlowly Russ turned around and faced his friend.\n\n\"We have it, Greg,\" he said. \"We really have it. We've tested the\ncontrol formulas all along the line. We know what we can do.\"\n\n\"We don't know it all yet,\" declared Greg. \"We know we can make it work,\nbut I have a feeling we haven't more than skimmed the surface\npossibilities.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRuss sank into a chair and stared about the room. They knew they could\ngenerate alternating current of any frequency they chose by use of a\nspecial collector apparatus. They could release radiant energy in almost\nany quantity they desired, in any wave-length, from the longest radio to\nthe incredibly hard cosmics. The electrical power they could measure\naccurately and easily by simple voltmeters and ammeters. But radiant\nenergy was another thing. When it passed all hitherto known bonds, it\nwould simply fuse any instrument they might use to measure it.\n\nBut they knew the power they generated. In one split second they had\nburst the energy bonds of a tiny bit of steel and that energy had glared\nbriefly more hotly than the Sun.\n\n\"Greg,\" he said, \"it isn't often you can say that any event was the\nbeginning of a new era. You can with this--the era of unlimited power.\nIt kind of scares me.\"\n\nUp until a hundred years ago coal and oil and oxygen had been the main\npower sources, but with the dwindling of the supply of coal and oil, man\nhad sought another way. He had turned back to the old dream of snatching\npower direct from the Sun. In the year 2048 Patterson had perfected the\nphoto-cell. Then the Alexanderson accumulators made it possible to pump\nthe life-blood of power to the far reaches of the System, and on Mercury\nand Venus, and to a lesser extent on Earth, great accumulator power\nplants had sprung up, with Interplanetary, under the driving genius of\nSpencer Chambers, gaining control of the market.\n\nThe photo-cell and the accumulator had spurred interplanetary trade and\nsettlement. Until it had been possible to store Sun-power for the\ndriving of spaceships and for shipment to the outer planets, ships had\nbeen driven by rocket fuel, and the struggling colonies on the outer\nworlds had fought a bitter battle without the aid of ready power.\n\nCoal and oil there were in plenty on the outer worlds, but one other\nessential was lacking ... oxygen. Coal on Mars, for instance, had to\nburned under synthetic air pressures, like the old carburetor. The\nresult was inefficiency. A lot of coal burned, not enough power\ndelivered.\n\nEven the photo-cells were inefficient when attempts were made to operate\nthem beyond the Earth; that was the maximum distance for maximum Solar\nefficiency.\n\nRuss dug into the pocket of his faded, scuffed leather jacket and hauled\nforth pipe and pouch. Thoughtfully he tamped the tobacco into the bowl.\n\n\"Three months,\" he said. \"Three months of damn hard work.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Wilson, \"we sure have worked.\"\n\nWilson's face was haggard, his eyes red. He blew smoke through his\nnostrils.\n\n\"When we get back, how about us taking a little vacation?\" he asked.\n\nRuss laughed. \"You can if you want to. Greg and I are keeping on.\"\n\n\"We can't waste time,\" Manning said. \"Spencer Chambers may get wind of\nthis. He'd move all hell to stop us.\"\n\nWilson spat out his cigarette. \"Why don't you patent what you have? That\nwould protect you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRuss grinned, but it was a sour one.\n\n\"No use,\" said Greg. \"Chambers would tie us up in a mile of legal red\ntape. It would be just like walking up and handing it to him.\"\n\n\"You guys go ahead and work,\" Wilson stated. \"I'm taking a vacation.\nThree months is too damn long to stay out in a spaceship.\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem long to me,\" said Greg, his tone cold and sharp.\n\nNo, thought Russ, it hadn't seemed long. Perhaps the hours had been\nrough, the work hard, but he hadn't noticed. Sleep and food had come in\nsnatches. For three months they had worked in space, not daring to carry\nout their experiments on Earth ... frankly afraid of the thing they had.\n\nHe glanced at Manning.\n\nThe three months had left no mark upon him, no hint of fatigue or\nstrain. Russ understood now how Manning had done the things he did. The\nman was all steel and flame. Nothing could touch him.\n\n\"We still have a lot to do,\" said Manning.\n\nRuss leaned back and puffed at his pipe.\n\nYes, there was a lot to do. Transmission problems, for instance. To\nconduct away such terrific power as they knew they were capable of\ndeveloping would require copper or silver bars as thick as a man's\nthigh, and even so at voltages capable of jumping a two-foot spark gap.\n\nObviously, a small machine such as they now had would be impractical. No\nmatter how perfectly it might be insulated, the atmosphere itself would\nnot be an insulator, with power such as this. And if one tried to\ndeliver the energy as a mechanical rotation of a shaft, what shaft could\ntransmit it safely and under control?\n\n\"Oh, hell,\" Russ burst out, \"let's get back to Earth.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHarry Wilson watched the couple alight from the aero-taxi, walk up the\nbroad steps and pass through the magic portals of the Martian Club. He\ncould imagine what the club was like, the deference of the management,\nthe exotic atmosphere of the dining room, the excellence of the long,\ncold drinks served at the bar. Mysterious drinks concocted of\ningredients harvested in the jungles of Venus, spiced with produce from\nthe irrigated gardens of Mars.\n\nHe puffed on the dangling cigarette and shuffled on along the airy\nhighwalk. Below and above him, all around him flowed the beauty and the\nglamor, the bravery and the splendor of New York. The city's song was in\nhis ears, the surging noises that were its voice.\n\nTwo thousand feet above his head reared giant pinnacles of shining\nmetal, glinting in the noonday sun, architecture that bore the alien\nstamp of other worlds.\n\nWilson turned around, stared at the Martian Club. A man needed money to\npass through those doors, to taste the drinks that slid across its bar,\nto sit and watch its floor shows, to hear the music of its orchestras.\n\nFor a moment he stood, hesitating, as if he were trying to make up his\nmind. He flipped away the cigarette, turned on his heel, walked briskly\nto the automatic elevator which would take him to the lower levels.\n\nThere, on the third level, he entered a Mecho restaurant, sat down at a\ntable and ordered from the robot waiter, pushing ivory-tipped buttons on\nthe menu before him.\n\nHe ate leisurely, smoked ferociously, thinking. Looking at his watch, he\nsaw that it was nearly two o'clock. He walked to the cashier machine,\ninserted the metallic check with the correct change and received from\nthe clicking, chuckling register the disk that would let him out the\ndoor.\n\n\"Thank you, come again,\" the cashier-robot fluted.\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" growled Wilson.\n\nOutside the restaurant he walked briskly. Ten blocks away he came to a\nbuilding roofing four square blocks. Over the massive doorway, set into\nthe beryllium steel, was a map of the Solar System, a map that served as\na cosmic clock, tracing the movement of the planets as they swung in\ntheir long arcs around the Sun. The Solar System was straddled by\nglowing, golden letters. They read: INTERPLANETARY BUILDING.\n\nIt was from here that Spencer Chambers ruled his empire built on power.\n\nWilson went inside.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER FOUR_\n\n\nThe new apparatus was set up, a machine that almost filled the\nlaboratory ... a giant, compact mass of heavy, solidly built metal work,\ntied together by beams of girderlike construction. It was meant to stand\nup under the hammering of unimaginable power, the stress of unknown\nspatial factors.\n\nSlowly, carefully, Russell Page tapped keys on the control board,\nsetting up an equation. Sucking thoughtfully at his pipe, he checked and\nrechecked them.\n\nHarry Wilson regarded him through squinted eyes.\n\n\"What the hell is going to happen now?\" he asked.\n\n\"We'll have to wait and see,\" Russ answered. \"We know what we want to\nhappen, what we hope will happen, but we never can be sure. We are\nworking with conditions that are entirely new.\"\n\nSitting beside a table littered with papers, staring at the gigantic\nmachine before him, Gregory Manning said slowly: \"That thing simply has\nto adapt itself to spaceship drive. There's everything there that's\nneeded for space propulsion. Unlimited power from a minimum of fuel.\nSplit-second efficiency. Entire independence of any set condition,\nbecause the stuff creates its own conditions.\"\n\nHe slowly wagged his head.\n\n\"The secret is some place along the line,\" he declared. \"I feel that we\nmust be getting close to it.\"\n\nRuss walked from the control board to the table, picked up a sheaf of\npapers and leafed through them. He selected a handful and shook them in\nhis fist.\n\n\"I thought I had it here,\" he said. \"My math must have been wrong, some\nfactor that I didn't include in the equation.\"\n\n\"You'll keep finding factors for some time yet,\" Greg prophesied.\n\n\"Repulsion would have been the answer,\" said Russ bitterly. \"And the\nLord knows we have it. Plenty of it.\"\n\n\"Too much,\" observed Wilson, smoke drooling from his nostrils.\n\n\"Not too much,\" corrected Greg. \"Inefficient control. You jump at\nconclusions, Wilson.\"\n\n\"The math didn't show that progressive action,\" said Russ. \"It showed\nrepulsion, negative gravity that could be built up until it would shoot\nthe ship outside the Solar System within an hour's time. Faster than\nlight. We don't know how many times faster.\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" advised Greg. \"The way it stands, it's useless. You get\nrepulsion by progressive steps. A series of squares with one constant\nfactor. It wouldn't be any good for space travel. Imagine trying to use\nit on a spaceship. You'd start with a terrific jolt. The acceleration\nwould fade and just when you were recovering from the first jolt, you'd\nget a second one and that second one would iron you out. A spaceship\ncouldn't take it, let alone a human body.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Maybe this will do it,\" said Wilson hopefully.\n\n\"Maybe,\" agreed Russ. \"Anyhow we'll try it. Equation 578.\"\n\n\"It might do the trick,\" said Greg. \"It's a new approach to the gravity\nangle. The equation explains the shifting of gravitational lines, the\nchanging and contortion of their direction. Twist gravity and you have a\nperfect space drive. As good as negative gravity. Better, perhaps, more\neasily controlled. Would make for more delicate, precise handling.\"\n\nRuss laid down the sheaf of papers, lit his pipe and walked to the\napparatus.\n\n\"Here goes,\" he said.\n\nHis hand went out to the power lever, eased it in. With a roar the\nmaterial energy engine built within the apparatus surged into action,\nsending a flow of power through the massive leads. The thunder mounted\nin the room. The laboratory seemed to shudder with the impact.\n\nWilson, watching intently, cried out, a brief, choked-off cry. A wave of\ndizziness engulfed him. The walls seemed to be falling in. The room and\nthe machine were blurring. Russ, at the controls, seemed horribly\ndisjointed. Manning was a caricature of a man, a weird, strange figure\nthat moved and gestured in the mad room.\n\nWilson fought against the dizziness. He tried to take a step and the\nfloor seemed to leap up and meet his outstretched foot, throwing him off\nbalance. His cigarette fell out of his mouth, rolled along the floor.\n\nRuss was shouting something, but the words were distorted, loud one\ninstant, rising over the din of the apparatus, a mere whisper the next.\nThey made no sense.\n\nThere was a peculiar whistling in the air, a sound such as he had never\nheard before. It seemed to come from far away, a high, thin shriek that\nwas torture in one's ears.\n\nGiddy, seized with deathly nausea, Wilson clawed his way across the\nfloor, swung open the laboratory door and stumbled outdoors. He weaved\nacross the lawn and clung to a sun dial, panting.\n\nHe looked back at the laboratory and gasped in disbelief. All the trees\nwere bent toward the building, as if held by some mighty wind. Their\nbranches straining, every single leaf standing at rigid attention, the\ntrees were bending in toward the structure. _But there was no wind._\n\nAnd then he noticed something else. No matter where the trees stood, no\nmatter in what direction from the laboratory, they all bent inward\ntoward the building ... and the whining, thundering, shrieking machine.\n\nInside the laboratory an empty bottle crashed off a table and smashed\ninto a thousand fragments. The tinkling of the broken glass was a\nsilvery, momentary sound that protested against the blasting thrum of\npower that shook the walls.\n\nManning fought along the floor to Russ's side. Russ roared in his ear:\n\"Gravitational control! Concentration of gravitational lines!\"\n\nThe papers on the desk started to slide, slithering onto the floor,\ndanced a crazy dervish across the room. Liquids in the laboratory\nbottles were climbing the sides of glass, instead of lying at rest\nparallel with the floor. A chair skated, bucking and tipping crazily,\ntoward the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRuss jerked the power lever back to zero. The power hum died. The\nliquids slid back to their natural level, the chair tipped over and lay\nstill, papers fluttered gently downward.\n\nThe two men looked at one another across the few feet of floor space\nbetween them. Russ wiped beads of perspiration from his forehead with\nhis shirt sleeve. He sucked on his pipe, but it was dead.\n\n\"Greg,\" Russ said jubilantly, \"we have something better than\nanti-gravity! We have something you might call _positive_ gravity ...\ngravity that we can control. Your grandfather nullified gravity. We've\ngone him one better.\"\n\nGreg gestured toward the machine. \"You created an attraction center.\nWhat else?\"\n\n\"But the center itself is not actually an attracting force. The fourth\ndimension is mixed up in this. We have a sort of fourth-dimensional lens\nthat concentrates the lines of any gravitational force. Concentration in\nthe fourth dimension turns the force loose in three dimensions, but we\ncan take care of that by using mirrors of our anti-entropy. We can\narrange it so that it turns the force loose in only one dimension.\"\n\nGreg was thoughtful for a moment. \"We can guide a ship by a series of\nlenses,\" he declared at last. \"But here's the really important thing.\nThat field concentrates the forces of gravity already present. Those\nforces exist throughout all of space. There are gravitational lines\neverywhere. We can concentrate them in any direction we want to. In\nreality, we fall toward the body which originally caused the force of\ngravitation, not to the concentration.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRuss nodded. \"That means we can create a field immediately ahead of the\nship. The ship would fall into it constantly, with the concentration\nmoving on ahead. The field would tend to break down in proportion to the\nstrain imposed and a big ship, especially when you are building up\nspeed, would tend to enlarge it, open it up. But the field could be kept\ntight by supplying energy and we have plenty of that ... far more than\nwe'd ever need. We supply the energy, but that's only a small part of\nit. The body emitting the gravitational force supplies the fulcrum that\nmoves us along.\"\n\n\"It would operate beyond the planets,\" said Greg. \"It would operate\nequally well anywhere in space, for all of space is filled with\ngravitational stress. We could use gravitational bodies many light years\naway as the driver of our ships.\"\n\nA half-wild light glowed momentarily in his eyes.\n\n\"Russ,\" he said, \"we're going to put space fields to work at last.\"\n\nHe walked to the chair, picked it up and sat down in it.\n\n\"We'll start building a ship,\" he stated, \"just as soon as we know the\nmechanics of this gravity concentration and control. Russ, we'll build\nthe greatest ship, the fastest ship, the most powerful ship the Solar\nSystem has ever known!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Damn,\" said Russ, \"that thing's slipped again.\"\n\nHe glared at the offending nut. \"I'll put a lock washer on it this\ntime.\"\n\nWilson stepped toward the control board. From his perch on the\napparatus, Russ motioned him away.\n\n\"Never mind discharging the field,\" he said. \"I can get around it\nsomehow.\"\n\nWilson squinted at him. \"This tooth is near killing me.\"\n\n\"Still got a toothache?\" asked Russ.\n\n\"Never got a wink of sleep last night.\"\n\n\"You better run down to Frisco and have it yanked out,\" suggested the\nscientist. \"Can't have you laid up.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's right,\" agreed Wilson. \"Maybe I will. We got a lot to do.\"\n\nRuss reached out and clamped his wrench on the nut, quickly backed it\noff and slipped on the washer. Viciously he tightened it home. The\nwrench stuck.\n\nGritting his teeth on the bit of his pipe, Russ cursed soundlessly. He\nyanked savagely at the wrench. It slipped from his hand, hung for a\nminute on the nut and then plunged downward, falling straight into the\nheart of the new force field they had developed.\n\nRuss froze and watched, his heart in his throat, mad thoughts in his\nbrain. In a flash, as the wrench fell, he remembered that they knew\nnothing about this field. All they knew was that any matter introduced\nin it suddenly acquired an acceleration in the dimension known as time,\nwith its normal constant of duration reduced to zero.\n\nWhen that wrench struck the field, it would cease to exist! But\nsomething else might happen, too, something entirely unguessable.\n\nThe wrench fell only a few feet, but it seemed to take long seconds as\nRuss watched, frozen in fascination.\n\nHe saw it strike the hazy glow that defined the limits of the field, saw\nit floating down, as if its speed had been slowed by some dense medium.\n\nIn the instant that hazy glow intensified a thousand times--became a\nblinding sun-burst! Russ ducked his head, shielded his eyes from the\nterrible blast of light. A rending, shuddering thud seemed to echo ...\nin space rather than in air ... and both field and wrench were gone!\n\nA moment passed, then another, and there was the heavy, solid clanging\nthud of something striking metal. This time the thud was not in space,\nbut a commonplace noise, as if someone had dropped a tool on the floor\nabove.\n\nRuss turned around and stared at Wilson. Wilson stared back, his mouth\nhanging open, the smoldering, cigarette dangling from his mouth.\n\n\"Greg!\" Russ shouted, his cry shattering the silence in the laboratory.\n\nA door burst open and Manning stepped into the main laboratory room, a\ncalculation pad in one hand, a pencil in the other.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he demanded.\n\n\"We have to find my wrench!\"\n\n\"Your wrench?\" Greg was puzzled. \"Can't you get another?\"\n\n\"I dropped it into the field. Its time-dimension was reduced to zero. It\nbecame an 'instantaneous wrench'.\"\n\n\"Nothing new in that,\" said Greg, unruffled.\n\n\"But there is,\" persisted Russ. \"The field collapsed, you see. Maybe the\nwrench was too big for it to handle. And when the field collapsed the\nwrench gained a new time-dimension. I heard it. We have to find it.\"\n\nThe three of them pounded up the stairs to the room where Russ had heard\nthe thump. There was nothing on the floor. They searched the room from\nend to end, then the other rooms. There was no wrench.\n\nAt the end of an hour Greg went back to the main laboratory, brought\nback a portable fluoroscope.\n\n\"Maybe this will do the trick,\" he announced bleakly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt did. They found the wrench _inside the space between the walls_!\n\nRuss stared at the shadow in the fluoroscope plate. Undeniably it was\nthe shadow of the wrench.\n\n\"Fourth dimension,\" he said. \"Transported in time.\"\n\nThe muscles in Greg's cheeks were tensed, that old flame of excitement\nburning in his eyes, but otherwise his face was the mask of old, the\ncalm, almost terrible mask that had faced a thousand dangers.\n\n\"Power and time,\" he corrected.\n\n\"If we can control it,\" said Russ.\n\n\"Don't worry. We can control it. And when we can, it's the biggest thing\nwe've got.\"\n\nWilson licked his lips, dredged a cigarette out of a pocket.\n\n\"If you don't mind,\" he said, \"I'll hit for Frisco tonight. This tooth\nof mine is getting worse.\"\n\n\"Sure, can't keep an aching tooth,\" agreed Russ, thinking of the wrench\nwhile talking.\n\n\"Can I take your ship?\" asked Wilson.\n\n\"Sure,\" said Russ.\n\nBack in the laboratory they rebuilt the field, dropped little ball\nbearings in it. The ball bearings disappeared. They found them\neverywhere--in the walls, in tables, in the floor. Some, still existing\nin their new time-dimension, hung in mid-air, invisible, intangible, but\nthere.\n\nHours followed hours, with the sheet of data growing. Math machines\nwhirred and chuckled and clicked. Wilson departed for San Francisco with\nhis aching tooth. The other two worked on. By dawn they knew what they\nwere doing. Out of the chaos of happenstance they were finding rules of\norder, certain formulas of behavior, equations of force.\n\nThe next day they tried heavier, more complicated things and learned\nstill more.\n\nA radiogram, phoned from the nearest spaceport, forty miles distant,\ninformed them that Wilson would not be back for a few days. His tooth\nwas worse than he had thought, required an operation and treatment of\nthe jaw.\n\n\"Hell,\" said Russ, \"just when he could be so much help.\"\n\nWith Wilson gone the two of them tackled the controlling device, labored\nand swore over it. But finally it was completed.\n\nSlumped in chairs, utterly exhausted, they looked proudly at it.\n\n\"With that,\" said Russ, \"we can take an object and transport it any\nplace we want. Not only that, we can pick up any object from an\nindefinite distance and bring it to us.\"\n\n\"What a thing for a lazy burglar,\" Greg observed sourly.\n\nWorn out, they gulped sandwiches and scalding coffee, tumbled into bed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe outdoor camp meeting was in full swing. The evangelist was in his\ntop form. The sinners' bench was crowded. Then suddenly, as the\nevangelist paused for a moment's silence before he drove home an\nimportant point, the music came. Music from the air. Music from\nsomewhere in the sky. The soft, heavenly music of a hymn. As if an\nangels' chorus were singing in the blue.\n\nThe evangelist froze, one arm pointing upward, with index finger ready\nto sweep down and emphasize his point. The sinners kneeling at the bench\nwere petrified. The congregation was astounded.\n\nThe hymn rolled on, punctuated, backgrounded by deep celestial organ\nnotes. The clear voice of the choir swept high to a bell-like note.\n\n\"Behold!\" shrieked the evangelist. \"Behold, a miracle! Angels singing\nfor us! Kneel! Kneel and pray!\"\n\nNobody stood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAndy McIntyre was drunk again. In the piteous glare of mid-morning, he\nstaggered homeward from the poker party in the back of Steve Abram's\nharness shop. The light revealed him to the scorn of the entire village.\n\nAt the corner of Elm and Third he ran into a maple tree. Uncertainly he\nbacked away, intent on making another try. Suddenly the tree spoke to\nhim:\n\n\"Alcohol is the scourge of mankind. It turns men into beasts. It robs\nthem of their brains, it shortens their lives ...\"\n\nAndy stared, unable to believe what he heard. The tree, he had no doubt,\nwas talking to him personally.\n\nThe voice of the tree went on: \"... takes the bread out of the mouths of\nwomen and children. Fosters crime. Weakens the moral fiber of the\nnation.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" screamed Andy. \"Stop, I tell you!\"\n\nThe tree stopped talking. All he could hear was the whisper of wind\namong its autumn-tinted leaves.\n\nSuddenly running, Andy darted around the corner, headed home.\n\n\"Begad,\" he told himself, \"when trees start talkin' to you it's time to\nlay off the bottle!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn another town fifty miles distant from the one in which the tree had\ntalked to Andy McIntyre, another miracle happened that same Sunday\nmorning.\n\nDozens of people heard the bronze statue of the soldier in the courtyard\nspeak. The statue did not come to life. It stood as ever, a solid piece\nof golden bronze, in spots turned black and green by weather. But from\nits lips came words ... words that burned themselves into the souls of\nthose who heard. Words that exhorted them to defend the principles for\nwhich many men had died, to grasp and hold high the torch of democracy\nand liberty.\n\nIn somber bitterness, the statue called Spencer Chambers the greatest\nthreat to that liberty and freedom. For, the statue said, Spencer\nChambers and Interplanetary Power were waging an economic war, a\nbloodless one, but just as truly war as if there were cannons firing and\nbombs exploding.\n\nFor a full five minutes the statue spoke and the crowd, growing by the\nminute, stood dumbfounded.\n\nThen silence fell over the courtyard. The statue stood as before,\nunmoving, its timeless eyes staring out from under the ugly helmet, its\nhands gripping the bayoneted rifle. A blue and white pigeon fluttered\nsoftly down, alighted on the bayonet, looked the crowd over and then\nflew to the courthouse tower.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBack in the laboratory, Russ looked at Greg.\n\n\"That radio trick gives me an idea,\" he said. \"If we can put a radio in\nstatues and trees without interfering with its operation, why can't we\ndo the same thing with a television set?\"\n\nGreg started. \"Think of the possibilities of that!\" he burst out.\n\nWithin an hour a complete television sending apparatus was placed within\nthe field and a receptor screen set up in the laboratory.\n\nThe two moved chairs in front of the screen and sat down. Russ reached\nout and pulled the switch of the field control. The screen came to life,\nbut it was only a gray blur.\n\n\"It's traveling too fast,\" said Greg. \"Slow it down.\"\n\nRuss retarded the lever. \"When that thing's on full, it's almost\ninstantaneous. It travels in a time dimension and any speed slower than\ninstantaneity is a modification of that force field.\"\n\nOn the screen swam a panorama of the mountains, mile after mile of\nsnow-capped peaks and valleys ablaze with the flames of autumn foliage.\nThe mountains faded away. There was desert now and then a city. Russ\ndropped the televisor set lower, down into a street. For half an hour\nthey sat comfortably in their chairs and watched men and women walking,\nwitnessed one dog fight, cruised slowly up and down, looking into\nwindows of homes, window-shopping in the business section.\n\n\"There's just one thing wrong,\" said Greg. \"We can see everything, but\nwe can't hear a sound.\"\n\n\"We can fix that,\" Russ told him.\n\nHe lifted the televisor set from the streets, brought it back across the\ndesert and mountains into the laboratory.\n\n\"We have two practical applications now,\" said Greg. \"Space drive and\ntelevision spying. I don't know which is the best. Do you realize that\nwith this television trick there isn't a thing that can be hidden from\nus?\"\n\n\"I believe we can go to Mars or Mercury or anywhere we want to with this\nthing. It doesn't seem to have any particular limits. It handles\nperfectly. You can move it a fraction of an inch as easily as a hundred\nmiles. And it's fast. Almost instantaneous. Not quite, for even with\nour acceleration within time, there is a slight lag.\"\n\nBy evening they had an audio apparatus incorporated in the set, had\nwired the screen for sound.\n\n\"Let's put this to practical use,\" suggested Greg. \"There's a show at\nthe New Mercury Theater in New York I've been wanting to see. Let's\nknock off work and take in that show.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Russ, \"you really have an idea. The ticket scalpers are\ncharging a fortune, and it won't cost us a cent to get in!\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER FIVE_\n\n\nPine roots burned brightly in the fireplace, snapping and sizzling as\nthe blaze caught and flamed on the resin. Deep in an easy chair, Greg\nManning stretched his long legs out toward the fire and lifted his\nglass, squinting at the flames through the amber drink.\n\n\"There's something that's been worrying me a little,\" he said. \"I hadn't\ntold you about it because I figured it wasn't as serious as it looked.\nMaybe it isn't, but it looks funny.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Russ.\n\n\"The stock market,\" replied Greg. \"There's something devilish funny\ngoing on there. I've lost about a billion dollars in the last two\nweeks.\"\n\n\"A _billion_ dollars?\" gasped Russ.\n\nGreg swirled the whiskey in his glass. \"Don't sound so horrified. The\nloss is all on paper. My stocks have gone down. Most of them cut in\nhalf. Some even less than that. Martian Irrigation is down to 75. I paid\n185 for it. It's worth 200.\"\n\n\"You mean something has happened to the market?\"\n\n\"Not to the market. If that was it, I wouldn't worry. I've seen the\nmarket go up and down. That's nothing to worry about. But the market,\nexcept for a slight depression, has behaved normally in these past two\nweeks. It almost looks as if somebody was out to get me.\"\n\n\"Who'd want to and why?\"\n\nGreg sighed. \"I wish I knew. I haven't really lost a cent, of course. My\nshares can't stay down for very long. The thing is that right now I\ncan't sell them even for what I paid for them. If I sold now I'd lose\nthat billion. But as long as I don't have to sell, the loss is merely on\npaper.\"\n\nHe sipped at the drink and stared into the fire.\n\n\"If you don't have to, what are you worrying about?\" asked Russ.\n\n\"Couple of things. I put that stock up as collateral to get the cash to\nbuild the spaceship. At present prices, it will take more securities\nthan I thought. If the prices continue to go down, I'll have the bulk of\nmy holdings tied up in the spaceship. I might even be forced to\nliquidate some of it and that would mean an actual loss.\"\n\nHe hunched forward in the chair, stared at Russ.\n\n\"Another thing,\" he said grimly, \"is that I hate the idea of somebody\nsingling me out as a target. As if they were going to make a financial\nexample of me.\"\n\n\"And it sounds as if someone has,\" agreed Russ.\n\nGreg leaned back again, drained his glass and set it down.\n\n\"It certainly does,\" he said.\n\nOutside, seen through the window beside the fireplace, the harvest moon\nwas a shield of silver hung in the velvet of the sky. A lonesome wind\nmoaned in the pines and under the eaves.\n\n\"I got a report from Belgium the other day,\" said Greg. \"The spaceship\nis coming along. It'll be the biggest thing afloat in space.\"\n\n\"The biggest and the toughest,\" said Russ, and Greg nodded silent\nagreement.\n\nThe ship itself was being manufactured at the great Space Works in\nBelgium, but other parts of it, apparatus, engines, gadgets of every\ndescription, were being manufactured at other widely scattered points.\nAnyone wondering what kind of ship the finished product would be would\nhave a hard time gathering the correct information, which, of course,\nwas the idea. The \"anyone\" they were guarding against was Spencer\nChambers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We need a better television set,\" said Russ. \"This one we have is all\nright, but we need the best there is. I wonder if Wilson could get us\none in Frisco and bring it back.\"\n\n\"I don't see why not,\" said Greg. \"Send him a radio.\"\n\nRuss stepped to the phone, called the spaceport and filed the message.\n\n\"He always stays at the Greater Martian,\" he told Greg. \"We'll probably\ncatch him there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo hours later the phone rang. It was the spaceport.\n\n\"That message you sent to Wilson,\" said the voice of the operator,\n\"can't be delivered. Wilson isn't at the Greater Martian. The clerk said\nhe checked out for New York last night.\"\n\n\"Didn't he leave a forwarding address?\" asked Russ.\n\n\"Apparently not.\"\n\nRuss hung up the receiver, frowning. \"Wilson is in New York.\"\n\nGreg looked up from a sheet of calculations.\n\n\"New York, eh?\" he said and then went back to work, but a moment later\nhe straightened from his work. \"What would Wilson be doing in New York?\"\n\n\"I wonder ...\" Russ stopped and shook his head.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Greg. He glanced out of the window, considering, the\nmuscles in his cheeks knotting. \"Russ, we both are thinking the same\nthing.\"\n\n\"I hate to think it,\" said Russ evenly. \"I hate to think such a thing\nabout a man.\"\n\n\"One way to find out,\" declared Greg. He rose from the chair and walked\nto the television control board, snapped the switch. Russ took a chair\nbeside him. On the screen the mountains danced weirdly as the set\nrocketed swiftly away and then came the glint of red and yellow desert.\nBlackness blanked out the screen as the set plunged into the ground,\npassing through the curvature of the Earth's surface. The blackness\npassed and fields and farms were beneath them on the screen, a green and\nbrown checkerboard with tiny white lines that were roads.\n\nNew York was in the screen now. Greg's hand moved the control and the\ncity rushed up at them, the spires speeding toward them like plunging\nspears. Down into the canyons plunged the set, down into the financial\ndistrict with its beetling buildings that hemmed in the roaring traffic.\n\nGrimly, surely, Greg drove his strange machine through New York. Through\nbuildings, through shimmering planes, through men. Like an arrow the\ntelevision set sped to its mark and then Greg's hand snapped back the\nlever and in the screen was a building that covered four whole blocks.\nAbove the entrance was the famous Solar System map and straddling the\nmap were the gleaming golden letters: INTERPLANETARY BUILDING.\n\n\"Now we'll see,\" said Greg.\n\nHe heard the whistle of the breath in Russ's nostrils as the television\nset began to move, saw the tight grip Russ had upon the chair arms.\n\nThe interior of the building showed on the screen as he drove the set\nthrough steel and stone, offices and corridors and brief glimpses of\nsteel partitions, until it came to a door marked: SPENCER CHAMBERS,\nPRESIDENT.\n\nGreg's hand twisted the control slightly and the set went through the\ndoor, into the office of Spencer Chambers.\n\nFour men were in the room--Chambers himself; Craven, the scientist;\nArnold Grant, head of Interplanetary's publicity department, _and Harry\nWilson_!\n\nWilson's voice came out of the screen, a frantic, almost terrified\nvoice.\n\n\"I've told you all I know. I'm not a scientist. I'm a mechanic. I've\ntold you what they're doing. I can't tell you how they do it.\"\n\nArnold Grant leaned forward in his chair. His face was twisted in fury.\n\n\"There were plans, weren't there?\" he demanded. \"There were equations\nand formulas. Why didn't you bring us some of them?\"\n\nSpencer Chambers raised a hand from the desk, waved it toward Grant.\n\"The man has told us all he knows. Obviously, he can't be any more help\nto us.\"\n\n\"You told him to go back and see if he couldn't find something else,\ndidn't you?\" asked Grant.\n\n\"Yes, I did,\" Chambers told him. \"But apparently he couldn't find it.\"\n\n\"I tried,\" pleaded Wilson. Perspiration stood out on his forehead. The\ncigarette in his mouth was limp and dead. \"One of them was always there.\nI never could get hold of any papers. I asked questions, but they were\ntoo busy to answer. And I couldn't ask too much, because then they would\nhave suspected me.\"\n\n\"No, you couldn't do that,\" commented Craven with an open sneer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the laboratory Russ pounded the arm of his chair with a clenched\nfist. \"The rat sold us out!\"\n\nGreg said nothing, but his face was stony and his eyes were\ncrystal-hard.\n\nOn the screen Chambers was speaking to Wilson. \"Do you think you could\nfind something out if you went back again?\"\n\nWilson squirmed in his chair.\n\n\"I'd rather not.\" His voice sounded like a whimper. \"I'm afraid they\nsuspect me now. I'm afraid of what they'd do if they found out.\"\n\n\"That's his conscience,\" breathed Russ in the laboratory. \"I never\nsuspected him.\"\n\n\"He's right about one thing, though,\" Greg said. \"He'd better not come\nback.\"\n\nChambers was talking again: \"You realize, of course, that you haven't\nbeen much help to us. You have only warned us that another kind of power\ngeneration is being developed. You've set us on our guard, but other\nthan that we're no better off than we were before.\"\n\nWilson bristled, like a cowardly animal backed into a corner. \"I told\nyou what was going on. You can be ready for it now. I can't help it if I\ncouldn't find out how all them things worked.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said Chambers. \"I made a bargain with you and I keep my\nbargains. I told you I would pay you twenty thousand dollars for the\ninformation you gave me when you first came to see me. I told you I'd\npay you for any further additional information you might give. Also I\npromised you a job with the company.\"\n\nWatching the financier, Wilson licked his lips. \"That's right,\" he said.\n\nChambers reached out and pulled a checkbook toward him, lifted a pen\nfrom its holder. \"I'm paying you the twenty thousand for the warning.\nI'm not paying you a dime more, because you gave me no other\ninformation.\"\n\nWilson leaped to his feet, started to protest.\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Chambers coldly.\n\n\"But the job! You said you'd give me a job!\"\n\nChambers shook his head. \"I wouldn't have a man like you in my\norganization. If you were a traitor to one man, you would be to\nanother.\"\n\n\"But ... but ...\" Wilson started to object and then sat down, his face\ntwisted in something that came very close to fear.\n\nChambers ripped the check out of the book, waved it slowly in the air to\ndry it. Then he arose and held it out to Wilson, who reached out a\ntrembling hand and took it.\n\n\"And now,\" said Chambers, \"good day, Mr. Wilson.\"\n\nFor a moment Wilson stood uncertain, as if he intended to speak, but\nfinally he turned, without a word, and walked through the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the laboratory Russ and Greg looked at one another.\n\n\"Twenty thousand,\" said Greg. \"Why, that was worth millions.\"\n\n\"It was worth everything Chambers had,\" said Russ, \"because it's the\nthing that's going to wreck him.\"\n\nTheir attention snapped back to the screen.\n\nChambers was hunched over his desk, addressing the other two.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" he asked, \"what are we to do?\"\n\nCraven shrugged his shoulders. There was a puzzled frown in the eyes\nback of the thick-lensed glasses. \"We haven't much to go on. Wilson\ndoesn't know a thing about it. He hasn't the brain to grasp even the\nmost fundamental ideas back of the whole thing.\"\n\nChambers nodded. \"The man knew the mechanical setup perfectly, but that\nwas all.\"\n\n\"I've constructed the apparatus,\" said Craven. \"It's astoundingly\nsimple. Almost too simple to do the things Wilson said it would do. He\ndrew plans for it, so clear that it was easy to duplicate the apparatus.\nHe himself checked the machine and says it is the same as Page and\nManning have. But there are thousands of possible combinations for\nhookups and control board settings. Too many to try to go through and\nhit upon the right answer. Because, you see, one slight adjustment in\nany one of a hundred adjustments might do the trick ... but which of\nthose adjustments do you have to make? We have to have the formulas, the\nequations, before we can even move.\"\n\n\"He seemed to remember a few things,\" said Grant hopefully. \"Certain\nrules and formulas.\"\n\nCraven flipped both his hands angrily. \"Worse than nothing,\" he\nexploded. \"What Page and Manning have done is so far in advance of\nanything that anyone else has even thought about that we are completely\nat sea. They're working with space fields, apparently, and we haven't\neven scratched the surface in that branch of investigation. We simply\nhaven't got a thing to go on.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"No chance at all?\" asked Chambers.\n\nCraven shook his head slowly.\n\n\"At least you could try,\" snapped Grant.\n\n\"Now, wait,\" Chambers snapped back. \"You seem to forget Dr. Craven is\none of the best scientists in the world today. I'm relying on him.\"\n\nCraven smiled. \"I can't do anything with what Page and Manning have, but\nI might try something of my own.\"\n\n\"By all means do so,\" urged Chambers. He turned to Grant. \"I observed\nyou have carried out the plans we laid. Martian Irrigation hit a new low\ntoday.\"\n\nGrant grinned. \"It was easy. Just a hint here and there to the right\npeople.\"\n\nChambers looked down at his hands, slowly closing into fists. \"We have\nto stop them some way, any way at all. Keep up the rumors. We'll make\nit impossible for Greg Manning to finance this new invention. We'll take\naway every last dollar he has.\"\n\nHe glared at the publicity man. \"You understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Grant, \"I understand perfectly.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Chambers. \"And your job, Craven, is to either develop\nwhat Page has found or find something we can use in competition.\"\n\nCraven growled angrily. \"What happens if your damn rumors can't ruin\nManning? What if I can't find anything?\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Chambers, \"there are other ways.\"\n\n\"Other ways?\"\n\nChambers suddenly smiled at them. \"I have a notion to call Stutsman back\nto Earth.\"\n\nCraven drummed his fingers idly on the arm of his chair. \"Yes, I guess\nyou do have other ways,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGreg's hand snapped the switch and the screen suddenly was blank as the\ntelevisor set returned instantly to the laboratory.\n\n\"That explains a lot of things,\" he said. \"Among them what has happened\nto my stocks.\"\n\nRuss sat in his chair, numbed. \"That little weak-kneed, ratting traitor,\nWilson. He'd sell his mother for a new ten-dollar bill.\"\n\n\"We know,\" said Greg, \"and Chambers doesn't know we know. We'll follow\nevery move he makes. We'll know every one of his plans.\"\n\nPacing up and down the room, he was already planning their campaign.\n\n\"There are still a few things to do,\" he added. \"A few possibilities we\nmay have overlooked.\"\n\n\"But will we have time?\" asked Russ.\n\n\"I think so. Chambers is going to go slow. The gamble is too big to risk\nany slip. He doesn't want to get in bad with the law. There won't be any\nstrong-arm stuff ... not until he recalls Stutsman from Callisto.\"\n\nHe paused in mid-stride, stood planted solidly on the floor.\n\n\"When Stutsman gets into the game,\" he said, \"all hell will break\nloose.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath.\n\n\"But we'll be ready for it then!\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER SIX_\n\n\n\"If we can get television reception with this apparatus of ours,\" asked\nGreg, \"what is to prevent us from televising? Why can't we send as well\nas receive?\"\n\nRuss drew doodles on a calculation sheet. \"We could. Just something else\nto work out. You must remember we're working in a four-dimensional\nmedium. That would complicate matters a little. Not like working in\nthree dimensions alone. It would ...\"\n\nHe stopped. The pencil fell from his finger and he swung around slowly\nto face Manning.\n\n\"What's the matter now?\" asked Greg.\n\n\"Look,\" said Russ excitedly. \"We're working in four dimensions. And if\nwe televised through four dimensions, what would we get?\"\n\nGreg wrinkled his brow. Suddenly his face relaxed. \"You don't mean we\ncan televise in _three_ dimensions, do you?\"\n\n\"That's what it should work out to,\" declared Russ. He swung back to the\ntable again, picked up his pencil and jotted down equations. He looked\nup from the sheet. \"Three-dimensional television!\" he almost whispered.\n\n\"Something new again,\" commented Greg.\n\n\"I'll say it's new!\"\n\nRuss reached out and jerked a calculator toward him. Rapidly he set up\nthe equations, pressed the tabulator lever. The machine gurgled and\nchuckled, clicked out the result. Bending over to read it, Russ sucked\nin his breath.\n\n\"It's working out right,\" he said.\n\n\"That'll mean new equipment, lots of it,\" Greg pointed out. \"Wilson's\ngone, damn him. Who's going to help us?\"\n\n\"We'll do it ourselves,\" said Russ. \"When we're the only ones here, we\ncan be sure there won't be any leak.\"\n\nIt took hours of work on the math machines, but at the end of that time\nRuss was certain of his ground.\n\n\"Now we go to work,\" he said, gleefully.\n\nIn a week's time they had built a triple televisor, but simplifications\nof the standard commercial set gave them a mechanism that weighed little\nmore and was far more efficient and accurate.\n\nDuring the time the work went on they maintained a watch over both the\noffice of Spencer Chambers and the laboratory in which Dr. Herbert\nCraven worked 16 hours a day. Unseen, unsuspected, they were silent\ncompanions of the two men during many hours. They read what the men\nwrote, read what was written to them, heard what they said, saw how they\nacted. Doing so, the pair in the high mountain laboratory gained a deep\ninsight into the characters of unsuspecting quarries.\n\n\"Both utterly ruthless,\" declared Greg. \"But apparently men who are\nsincere in thinking that the spoils belong to the strong. Strange,\nalmost outdated men. You can't help but like Chambers. He's good enough\nat heart. He has his pet charities. He really, I believe, wants to help\nthe people. And I think he actually believes the best way to do it is to\ngain a dictatorship over the Solar System. That ambition rules\neverything in his life. It has hardened him and strengthened him. He\nwill crush ruthlessly, without a single qualm, anything that stands in\nhis path. That's why we'll have a fight on our hands.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCraven seemed to be making little progress. They could only guess at\nwhat he was trying to develop.\n\n\"I think,\" said Russ, \"he's working on a collector field to suck in\nradiant energy. If he really gets that, it will be something worth\nhaving.\"\n\nFor hours Craven sat, an intent, untidy, unkempt man, sunk deep in the\ncushions of an easy chair. His face was calm, with relaxed jaw and eyes\nthat seemed vacant. But each time he would rouse himself from the chair\nto pencil new notations on the pads of paper that littered his desk. New\nideas, new approaches.\n\nThe triple televisor was completed except for one thing.\n\n\"Sound isn't so easy,\" said Russ. \"If we could only find a way to\ntransmit it as well as light.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said Greg, \"why don't you try a condenser speaker.\"\n\n\"A condenser speaker?\"\n\n\"Sure, the gadget developed way back in the 1920s. It hasn't been used\nfor years to my knowledge, but it might do the trick.\"\n\nRuss grinned broadly. \"Hell, why didn't I think of that? Here I've been\nracking my brain for a new approach, a new wrinkle ... and exactly what\nI wanted was at hand.\"\n\n\"Should work,\" declared Greg. \"Just the opposite of a condenser\nmicrophone. Instead of radiating sound waves mechanically, it radiates a\nchanging electric field and this field becomes audible directly within\nthe ear. Even yet no one seems to understand just how it works, but it\ndoes ... and that's good enough.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Russ. \"It really makes no sound. In other words it\ncreates an electric field that doubles for sound. It ought to be just\nthe thing because nothing can stop it. Metal shielding can, I guess, if\nit's thick enough, but it's got to be pretty damn thick.\"\n\nIt took time to set the mechanism up. Ready, the massive apparatus,\nwithin which glowed a larger and more powerful force field, was operated\nby two monstrous material energy engines. The controls were equipped\nwith clockwork drives, designed so that the motion of the Earth could be\nnullified completely and automatically for work upon outlying planets.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRuss stood back and looked at it. \"Stand in front of that screen, Greg,\"\nhe said, \"and we'll try it on you.\"\n\nGreg stepped in front of the screen. The purr of power came on.\nSuddenly, materializing out of the air, came Greg's projection. Hazy and\nundefined at first, it rapidly assumed apparent solidity. Greg waved his\narm; the image moved its arm.\n\nRuss left the controls and walked across the laboratory to inspect the\nimage. Examined from all sides, it looked solid. Russ walked through\nit and felt nothing. There was nothing there. It was just a\nthree-dimensional image. But even from two feet away, it was as if the\nman himself stood there in all the actuality of flesh and blood.\n\n\"Hello, Russ,\" the image whispered. It held out a hand. \"Glad to see you\nagain.\"\n\nLaughing, Russ thrust out his hand. It closed on nothing in mid-air, but\nthe two men appeared to shake hands.\n\nThey tested the machine that afternoon. Their images strode above the\ntrees, apparently walking on thin air. Gigantic replicas of Greg stood\non a faraway mountain top and shouted with a thunderous voice. Smaller\nimages, no more than two inches high, shinnied up a table leg.\n\nSatisfied, they shut off the machine.\n\n\"That's one of the possibilities you mentioned,\" suggested Russ.\n\nGreg nodded grimly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn autumn gale pelted the windows with driving rain, and a wild, wet\nwind howled through the pines outside. The fire was leaping and flaring\nin the fireplace.\n\nDeep in his chair, Russ stared into the flame and puffed at his pipe.\n\n\"The factory wants more money on the spaceship,\" said Greg from the\nother chair. \"I had to put up some more shares as collateral on a new\nloan.\"\n\n\"Market still going down?\" asked Russ.\n\n\"Not the market,\" replied Greg. \"My stocks. All of them hit new lows\ntoday.\"\n\nRuss dragged at the pipe thoughtfully. \"I've been thinking about that\nstock business, Greg.\"\n\n\"So have I, but it doesn't seem to do much good.\"\n\n\"Look,\" said Russ slowly, \"what planets have exchanges?\"\n\n\"All of them except Mercury. The Jovian exchange is at Ranthoor. There's\neven one out at Pluto. Just mining and chemical shares listed, though.\"\n\nRuss did not reply. Smoke curled up from his pipe. He was staring into\nthe fire.\n\n\"Why do you ask?\" Greg wanted to know.\n\n\"Just something stirring around in my mind. I was wondering where\nChambers does most of his trading.\"\n\n\"Ranthoor now,\" said Greg. \"Used to do it on Venus. The listing is\nlarger there. But since he took over the Jovian confederacy, he switched\nhis business to it. The transaction tax is lower. He saw to that.\"\n\n\"And the same shares are listed on the Callisto market as on the New\nYork boards?\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Greg, \"only not as many.\"\n\nRuss watched the smoke from his pipe. \"How long does it take light to\ntravel from Callisto to Earth?\"\n\n\"Why, about 45 minutes, I guess. Somewhere around there.\" Greg sat\nupright. \"Say, what's light got to do with this?\"\n\n\"A lot,\" said Russ. \"All commerce is based on the assumption that light\nis instantaneous, but it isn't. All business, anywhere throughout the\nSolar System, is based on Greenwich time. When a noon signal sent out\nfrom Earth reaches Mars, it's noon there, but as a matter of fact, it is\nactually 15 minutes or so past noon. When the same signal reaches\nCallisto, the correct time for the chronometer used in commerce would be\nnoon when it is really a quarter to one. That system simplifies things.\nDoes away with varying times. And it has worked all right so far because\nthere has been, up to now, nothing that could go faster than light. No\nnews can travel through space, no message, no signal can be sent at any\nspeed greater than that. So everything has been fine.\"\n\nGreg had come out of the chair, was standing on his feet, the glow of\nthe blaze throwing his athletic figure into bold relief. That calm\nexterior had been stripped from him now. He was excited.\n\n\"I see what you are getting at! We have something that is almost\ninstantaneous!\"\n\n\"Almost,\" said Russ. \"Not quite. There's a time lag somewhere. But it\nisn't noticeable except over vast distances.\"\n\n\"But it would beat ordinary light signals to Callisto. It would beat\nthem there by almost 45 minutes.\"\n\n\"Almost,\" Russ agreed. \"Maybe a split second less.\"\n\nGreg strode up and down in front of the fireplace like a caged lion. \"By\nheaven,\" he said, \"we've got Chambers where we want him. We can beat the\nstock quotations to Callisto. With that advance knowledge of what the\nboard is doing in New York, we can make back every dime I've lost. We\ncan take Mr. Chambers to the cleaners!\"\n\nRuss grinned. \"Exactly,\" he said. \"We'll know 45 minutes in advance of\nthe other traders what the market will be. Let's see Chambers beat\nthat.\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER SEVEN_\n\n\nBen Wrail was taking things easy. Stretched out in his chair, with his\ncigar lit and burning satisfactorily, he listened to a radio program\nbroadcast from Earth.\n\nThrough the window beside him, he could look out of his skyscraper\napartment over the domed city of Ranthoor. Looming in the sky, slightly\ndistorted by the heavy quartz of the distant dome, was massive Jupiter,\na scarlet ball tinged with orange and yellow. Overwhelmingly luminous,\nmonstrously large, it filled a large portion of the visible sky, a sight\nthat brought millions of tourists to the Jovian moons each year, a sight\nthat even the old-timers still must stare at, drawn by some unfathomable\nfascination.\n\nBen Wrail stared at it now, puffing at his cigar, listening to the\nradio. An awe-inspiring thing, a looming planet that seemed almost ready\nto topple and crash upon this airless, frigid world.\n\nWrail was an old-timer. For thirty years--Earth years--he had made his\nhome in Ranthoor. He had seen the city grow from a dinky little mining\ncamp enclosed by a small dome to one that boasted half a million\npopulation. The dome that now covered the city was the fourth one. Four\ntimes, like the nautilus, the city had outgrown its shell, until today\nit was the greatest domed city in the Solar System. Where life had once\nbeen cheap and where the scum of the system had held rendezvous, he had\nseen Ranthoor grow into a city of dignity, capital of the Jovian\nconfederacy.\n\nHe had helped build that confederacy, had been elected a member of the\nconstitution commission, had helped create the government and for over a\ndecade had helped to make its laws.\n\nBut now ... Ben Wrail spat angrily and stuffed the cigar back in his\nmouth again, taking a fresh and fearsome grip. Now everything had\nchanged. The Jovian worlds today were held in bond by Spencer Chambers.\nThe government was in the hands of his henchmen. Duly elected, of\ncourse, but in an election held under the unspoken threat that\nInterplanetary Power would withdraw, leaving the moons circling the\ngreat planet without heat, air, energy. For the worlds of the Jovian\nconfederacy, every single one of them, depended for their life upon the\naccumulators freighted outward from the Sun.\n\nTalk of revolt was in the air, but, lacking a leader, it would get\nnowhere. John Moore Mallory was imprisoned on one of the prison\nspaceships that plied through the Solar System. Mallory, months ago, had\nbeen secretly transferred from the Callisto prison to the spaceship, but\nin a week's time the secret had been spread in angry whispers. If there\nhad been riots and bloodshed, they would have been to no purpose. For\nrevolution, even if successful, would gain nothing. It would merely goad\nInterplanetary Power into withdrawing, refusing to service the domed\ncities on the moons.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBen Wrail stirred restlessly in his chair. The cigar had gone out. The\nradio program blared unheard. His eyes still looked out the window\nwithout seeing Jupiter.\n\n\"Damn,\" said Ben Wrail. Why did he have to go and spoil an evening\nthinking about this damned political situation? Despite his part in the\nbuilding of the confederacy, he was a businessman, not a politician.\nStill, it hurt to see something torn down that he had helped to build,\nthough he knew that every pioneering strike in history had been taken\nover by shrewd, ruthless, powerful operators. Knowing that should have\nhelped, but it didn't. He and the other Jovian pioneers had hoped it\nwouldn't happen and, of course, it had.\n\n\"Ben Wrail,\" said a voice in the room.\n\nWrail swung around, away from the window.\n\n\"Manning!\" he yelled, and the man in the center of the room grinned\nbleakly at him. \"How did you come in without me hearing you? When did\nyou get here?\"\n\n\"I'm not here,\" said Greg. \"I'm back on Earth.\"\n\n\"You're what?\" asked Wrail blankly. \"That's a pretty silly statement,\nisn't it, Manning? Or did you decide to loosen up and pull a gag now and\nthen?\"\n\n\"I mean it,\" said Manning. \"This is just an image of me. My body is back\non Earth.\"\n\n\"You mean you're dead? You're a ghost?\"\n\nThe grin widened, but the face was bleak as ever.\n\n\"No, Ben, I'm just alive as you are. Let me explain. This is a\ntelevision image of me. Three-dimensional television. I can travel\nanywhere like this.\"\n\nWrail sat down in the chair again. \"I don't suppose there'd be any use\ntrying to shake hands with you.\"\n\n\"No use,\" agreed Manning's image. \"There isn't any hand.\"\n\n\"Nor asking you to have a chair?\"\n\nManning shook his head.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" said Wrail, \"I'm damn glad to see you--or think I see you. I\ndon't know which. Figure you can stay and talk with me a while?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Manning. \"That is what I came for. I want to ask your\nhelp.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" declared Wrail, \"you can't be on Earth, Manning. I say\nsomething to you and you answer right back. That isn't possible. You\ncan't hear anything I say until 45 minutes after I say it, and then I'd\nhave to wait another 45 minutes to hear your answer.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" agreed the image, \"if you insist upon talking about the\nvelocity of light. We have something better than that.\"\n\n\"We?\"\n\n\"Russell Page and myself. We have a two-way television apparatus that\nworks almost instantaneously. To all purposes, so far as the distance\nbetween Earth and Callisto is concerned, it is instantaneous.\"\n\nWrail's jaw fell. \"Well, I be damned. What have you two fellows been up\nto now?\"\n\n\"A lot,\" said Manning laconically. \"For one thing we are out to bust\nInterplanetary Power. Bust them wide open. Hear that, Wrail?\"\n\nWrail stared in stupefaction. \"Sure, I hear. But I can't believe it.\"\n\n\"All right then,\" said Manning grimly, \"we'll give you proof. What\ncould you do, Ben, if we told you what was happening on the stock market\nin New York ... _without you having to wait the 45 minutes it takes the\nquotations to get here_?\"\n\nWrail sprang to his feet. \"What could I do? Why, I could run the pants\noff every trader in the exchange! I could make a billion a minute!\" He\nstopped and looked at the image. \"But this isn't like you. This isn't\nthe way you'd do things.\"\n\n\"I don't want you to hurt anyone but Chambers,\" said Manning. \"If\nsomebody else gets in the way, of course they have to take the rap along\nwith him. But I do want to give Chambers a licking. That's what I came\nhere to see you about.\"\n\n\"By Heaven, Greg, I'll do it,\" said Wrail. He stepped quickly forward,\nheld out his hand to close the deal, and encountered only air.\n\nManning's image threw back its head and laughed.\n\n\"That's your proof, Ben. Good enough?\"\n\n\"I'll say it is,\" said Wrail shakily, looking down at the solid-seeming\nhand that his own had gone right through.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNovember 6, 2153, was a day long remembered in financial circles\nthroughout the Solar System. The Ranthoor market opened easy with little\nactivity. Then a few stocks made fractional gains. Mining dropped\nfractionally. Martian Irrigation still was unexplainably low, as was\nPluto Chemical and Asteroid Mining.\n\nTrading through two brokers, Ben Wrail bought 10,000 shares of Venus\nFarms, Inc. when the market opened at 83-1/2. A few minutes later they\nbought 10,000 shares of Spacesuits Ltd. at 106-1/4. The farm stocks\ndropped off a point. Spacesuits gained a point. Then suddenly both rose.\nIn the second hour of trading the Venus stocks had boomed a full five\npoints and Wrail sold. Ten minutes later they sagged. At the end of the\nday they were off two points from the opening. In late afternoon Wrail\nthrew his 10,000 shares of Spacesuits on the market, sold them at an\neven 110. Before the close they had dropped back with a gain of only\nhalf a point over the opening.\n\nThose were only two transactions. There were others. Spaceship\nFabrication climbed three points before it fell and Wrail cashed in on\nthat. Mercury Metals rose two points and crashed back to close with a\nfull point loss. Wrail sold just before the break. He had realized a\ncool half million in the day's trade.\n\nThe next day it was a million and then the man who had always been a\nsafe trader, who had always played the conservative side of the market,\napparently sure of his ground now, plunged deeper and deeper. It was\nuncanny. Wrail knew when to buy and when to sell. Other traders watched\nclosely, followed his lead. He threw them off by using different brokers\nto disguise his transactions.\n\nHectic day followed hectic day. Ben Wrail did not appear on the floor.\nCalls to his office netted exactly nothing. Mr. Wrail was not in. So\nsorry.\n\nHis brokers, well paid, were close-mouthed. They bought and sold. That\nwas all.\n\nSeated in his office, Ben Wrail was busy watching two television screens\nbefore him. One showed the board in the New York exchange. In the other\nwas the image of Gregory Manning, hunched in a chair in Page's mountain\nlaboratory back on Earth. And before Greg likewise were two screens, one\nshowing the New York exchange board, the other trained on Ben Wrail's\noffice.\n\n\"That Tourist stuff looks good,\" said Greg. \"Why not buy a block of it?\nI happen to know that Chambers owns a few shares. He'll be dabbling in\nit.\"\n\nBen Wrail grinned. \"It's made a couple of points, hasn't it? It's\nselling here for 60 right now. In 45 minutes it'll be quoted at 62.\"\n\nHe picked up a telephone. \"Buy all you can of Tourist,\" he said. \"Right\naway. I'll tell you when to sell. Get rid of whatever you have in Titan\nCopper at 10:30.\"\n\n\"Better let go of your holdings of Ranthoor Dome,\" suggested Greg. \"It's\nbeginning to slip.\"\n\n\"I'll watch it,\" promised Ben. \"It may revive.\"\n\nThey lapsed into silence, watching the board in New York.\n\n\"You know, Greg,\" said Ben finally, \"I really didn't believe all this\nwas true until I saw those credit certificates materialize on my desk.\"\n\n\"Simple,\" grunted Greg. \"This thing we've got can take anything any\nplace. I could reach out there, grab you up and have you down here in a\nsplit second.\"\n\nBen sucked his breath in between his teeth. \"I'm not doubting anything\nany more. You sent me half a billion two days ago. It's more than\ndoubled now.\"\n\nHe picked up the phone again and spoke to his broker on the other end.\n\n\"Unload Ranthoor Dome when she reaches 79.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe real furor came on the Ranthoor floor when Wrail cornered Titan\nCopper. Striking swiftly, he purchased the stock in huge blocks. The\nshares rocketed as the exchanges throughout the System were thrown into\nan uproar. Under the cover of the excitement he proceeded to corner\nSpacesuits Ltd. Spacesuits zoomed.\n\nFor two days the main exchanges on four worlds were in a frenzy as\ntraders watched the shares climb swiftly. Operators representing\nInterplanetary Power made offerings. No takers were reported. The shares\nclimbed.\n\nWithin one hour, however, the entire Wrail holdings in both stocks were\ndumped on the market. The Interplanetary Power traders, frantic over the\nprospect of losing control of the two important issues, bought heavily.\nThe price plummeted.\n\nSpencer Chambers lost three billion or more on the deal. Overnight Ben\nWrail had become a billionaire many times over. Greg Manning added to\nhis own fortune.\n\n\"We have enough,\" said Greg. \"We've given Chambers what he had coming to\nhim. Let's call it off.\"\n\n\"Glad to,\" agreed Ben. \"It was just too damned easy.\"\n\n\"Be seeing you, Ben.\"\n\n\"I'll get down to Earth some day. Come see me when you have a minute.\nDrop in for an evening.\"\n\n\"That's an invitation,\" said Greg. \"It's easy with this three-dimension\nstuff.\"\n\nHe reached out a hand, snapped a control. The screens in Wrail's office\nwent dead.\n\nWrail reached for a cigar, lit it carefully. He leaned back in his\nchair, put his feet on the desk.\n\n\"By Heaven,\" he said satisfiedly, \"I've never enjoyed anything so much\nin all my life.\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER EIGHT_\n\n\nA giant cylindrical hull of finest beryl steel, the ship loomed in the\nscreen. A mighty ship, braced into absolute rigidity by monster cross\nbeams of shining steel. Glowing under the blazing lamps that lighted the\nscene, it towered into the shadows of the factory, dwarfing the\nscurrying workmen who swarmed over it.\n\n\"She's a beauty,\" said Russ, puffing at his pipe.\n\nGreg nodded agreement. \"They're working on her day and night to get her\nfinished. We may need it some day and need it in a hurry. If Chambers\nreally gets that machine of his to rolling, space will be the only place\nbig enough to hide in.\"\n\nHe chuckled, a grim chuckle, deep in his throat.\n\n\"But we won't have to hide long. Just until we get organized and then\nwill come the time when we'll call for the showdown. Chambers will have\nto spread his cards.\"\n\nRuss snapped the television switch and the screen went blank. The\nlaboratory suddenly was a place of queer lights and shadows, bulging\nwith grotesque machines, with sprawling apparatus, a place that hinted\ndarkly of vast power and mighty forces.\n\nThe scientist sat up in his chair. \"We've come a long way, Greg. A long,\nlong way. We have the greatest power man has ever known; we have an\nalmost incomprehensible space drive; we have three-dimensional\ntelevision.\"\n\n\"And,\" said Greg dryly, \"we took Chambers to the cleaners on the\nmarket.\"\n\nThey sat in silence. Greg smelled the smoke from Russ's pipe, mixed with\nthe taint of lubricant and the faint lingering scent of ionized air.\n\n\"We mustn't underrate Chambers, however,\" he declared. \"The man made one\nmistake. He underrated us. We can't repeat his mistake. He is dangerous\nall the time. He will stop at nothing. Not even murder.\"\n\n\"He's going easy now,\" said Russ. \"He's hoping Craven can find something\nthat will either equal our stuff or beat it. But Craven isn't having any\nluck. He's still driving himself on the radiation theory, but he doesn't\nseem to make much headway.\"\n\n\"If he got it, just what would it mean?\"\n\n\"Plenty. With that he could turn all radiations in space to work. The\ncosmics, heat, light, everything. Space is full of radiation.\"\n\n\"If it hadn't been for Wilson,\" Greg said, his voice a snarl, \"we\nwouldn't have to be worrying about Chambers. Chambers wouldn't know\nuntil we were ready to let him know.\"\n\n\"Wilson!\" ejaculated Russ, suddenly leaning forward. \"I had forgotten\nabout Wilson. What do you say we try to find him?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHarry Wilson sat at his table in the Martian Club and watched the exotic\nMartian dance, performed by near-nude girls. Smoke trailed up lazily\nfrom his drooping cigarette as he watched through squinted eyes. There\nwas something about the dance that got under Wilson's skin.\n\nThe music rose, then fell to whispering undertones and suddenly,\nunexpectedly, crashed and stopped. The girls were running from the\nfloor. A wave of smooth, polite applause rippled around the tables.\n\nWilson sighed and reached for his wine glass. He crushed the cigarette\ninto a tray and sipped his wine. He glanced around the room, scanning\nthe bobbing, painted faces of the night--the great, the near-great, the\nnear-enough-to-touch-the-great. Brokers and businessmen, artists and\nwriters and actors. There were others, too, queer night-life shadows\nthat no one knew much about, or that one heard too much about ... the\nplayboys and the ladies of family and fortune, correctly attired men,\ngorgeously, sleekly attired women.\n\nAnd--Harry Wilson. The waiters called him Mr. Wilson. He heard people\nwhispering about him asking who he was. His soul soaked it in and cried\nfor more. Good food, good drinks, the pastels of the walls, the soft\nlights and weird, exotic music. The cold but colorful correctness of it\nall.\n\nJust two months ago he had stood outside the club, a stranger in the\ncity, a mechanic from a little out-of-the-way laboratory, a man who was\npaid a pittance for his skill. He had stood outside and watched his\nemployers walk up the steps and through the magic doors. He had watched\nin bitterness....\n\nBut now!\n\nThe orchestra was striking up a tune. A blonde nodded at him from a\nnear-by table. Solemnly, with the buzz of wine in his brain and its\nhotness in his blood, he returned the nod.\n\nSomeone was speaking to him, calling him by name. He looked around, but\nthere was no one looking at him now. And once again, through that flow\nof music, through the hum of conversation, through the buzzing of his\nown brain, came the voice, cold and sharp as steel:\n\n\"Harry Wilson!\"\n\nIt sent a shudder through him. He reached for the wine glass again, but\nhis hand stopped half-way to the stem, paused and trembled at what he\nsaw.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor there was a gray vagueness in front of him, a sort of shimmer of\nnothingness, and out of that shimmer materialized a pencil.\n\nAs he watched, in stricken terror, the point of the pencil dropped to\nthe tablecloth and slowly, precisely, it started to move. He stared,\nhypnotized, unbelieving, with the fingers of madness probing at his\nbrain. The pencil wrote:\n\n    Wilson, you sold me out.\n\nThe man at the table tried to speak, tried to shriek, but his tongue and\nthroat were dry and only harsh breath rattled in his mouth.\n\nThe pencil moved on mercilessly:\n\n    But you will pay. No matter where you go, I will find you. You\n    cannot hide from me.\n\nThe pencil slowly lifted its point from the table and suddenly was gone,\nas if it had never been. Wilson, eyes wide and filled with terrible\nfear, stared at the black words on the cloth.\n\n    Wilson, you sold me out. But you will pay. No matter where you go, I\n    will find you. You cannot hide from me.\n\nThe music pulsated in the room, the hum of conversation ran like an\nundertone, but Wilson did not hear. His entire consciousness was\ncentered on the writing, the letters and the words that filled his soul\nwith dread.\n\nSomething seemed to snap within him. The cold wind of terror reached out\nand struck at him. He staggered from the chair. His hand swept the wine\nglass from the table and it shattered into chiming shards.\n\n\"They can't do this to me!\" he shrieked.\n\nThere was a silence in the room a silence of terrible accusation.\nEveryone was staring at him. Eyebrows raised.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA waiter was at his elbow. \"Do you feel ill, sir?\"\n\nAnd then, on unsteady feet, he was being led away. Behind him he heard\nthe music once again, heard the rising hum of voices.\n\nSomeone set his hat on his head, was holding his coat. The cold air of\nthe night struck his face and the doors sighed closed behind him.\n\n\"I'd take it easy going down the step, sir,\" counseled the doorman.\n\nAn aero-taxi driver held open the door of the cab and saluted.\n\n\"Where to, sir?\"\n\nWilson stumbled in and stammered out his address. The taxi droned into\nthe traffic lane.\n\nHands twitching, Wilson fumbled with the key, took minutes to open the\ndoor into his apartment. Finally the lock clicked and he pushed open the\ndoor. His questing finger found the wall switch. Light flooded the room.\n\nWilson heaved a sigh of relief. He felt safe here. This place belonged\nto him. It was his home, his retreat....\n\nA low laugh, hardly more than a chuckle, sounded behind him. He whirled\nand for a moment, blinking in the light, he saw nothing. Then something\nstirred by one of the windows, gray and vague, like a sheet of moving\nfog.\n\nAs he watched, shrinking back against the wall, the grayness deepened,\ntook the form of a man. And out of that mistiness a face was etched, a\nface that had no single line of humor in it, a bleak face with the fire\nof anger in the eyes.\n\n\"Manning!\" shrieked Wilson. \"Manning!\" He wheeled and sprinted for the\ndoor, but the gray figure moved, too ... incredibly fast, as if it were\nwind-blown vapor, and barred his path to the door.\n\n\"Why are you running away?\" Manning's voice mocked. \"Certainly you\naren't afraid of me.\"\n\n\"Look,\" Wilson whimpered, \"I didn't think of what it meant. I just was\ntired of working the way Page made me work. Tired of the little salary I\ngot. I wanted money. I was hungry for money.\"\n\n\"So you sold us out,\" said Manning.\n\n\"No,\" cried Wilson, \"I didn't think of it that way. I didn't stop to\nthink.\"\n\n\"Think now, then,\" said Manning gravely. \"Think of this. No matter where\nyou are, no matter where you go, no matter what you do, I'll always be\nwatching you, I'll never let you rest. I'll never give you a minute's\npeace.\"\n\n\"Please,\" pleaded Wilson. \"Please, go away and leave me. I'll give you\nback the money ... there's some of it left.\"\n\n\"You sold out for twenty thousand,\" said Manning. \"You could have gotten\ntwenty million. Chambers would have paid that much to know what you\ncould tell him, because it was worth twenty billion.\"\n\nWilson's breath was coming in panting gasps. He dropped his coat and\nbacked away. The back of his knees collided with a chair and he folded\nup, sat down heavily, still staring at the gray mistiness that was a\nman.\n\n\"Think of that, Wilson,\" Manning went on sneeringly. \"You could have\nbeen a millionaire. Maybe even a billionaire. You could have had all the\nfine things these other people have. But you only got twenty thousand.\"\n\n\"What can I do?\" begged Wilson.\n\nThe misty face split in a sardonic grin.\n\n\"I don't believe there's anything left for you to do.\"\n\nBefore Wilson's eyes the face dissolved, lost its lines, seemed to melt\naway. Only streaming, swirling mist, then a slight refraction in the air\nand then nothing.\n\nSlowly Wilson rose to his feet, reached for the bottle of whiskey on the\ntable. His hand shook so that the liquor splashed. When he raised the\nglass to his mouth, his still-shaking hand poured half the drink over\nhis white shirt front.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER NINE_\n\n\nLudwig Stutsman pressed his thin, straight lips together. \"So that's the\nsetup,\" he said.\n\nAcross the desk Spencer Chambers studied the man. Stutsman was like a\nwolf, lean and cruel and vicious. He even looked like a wolf, with his\nlong, thin face, his small, beady eyes, the thin, bloodless lips. But he\nwas the kind of man who didn't always wait for instructions, but went\nahead and used his own judgment. And in a ruthless sort of way, his\njudgment was always right.\n\n\"Only as a last resort,\" cautioned Chambers, \"do I want you to use the\nextreme measures you are so fond of using. If they should prove\nnecessary, we can always use them. But not yet. I want to settle this\nthing in the quietest way possible. Page and Manning are two men who\ncan't simply disappear. There'd be a hunt, an investigation, an ugly\nsituation.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" agreed Stutsman. \"If something should happen to their\nnotes, if somebody could find them. Perhaps you. If you found them on\nyour desk one morning.\"\n\nThe two men measured one another with their eyes, more like enemies\nthan men working for the same ends.\n\n\"Not my desk,\" snapped Chambers, \"Craven's. So that Craven could\ndiscover this new energy. Whatever Craven discovers belongs to\nInterplanetary.\"\n\nChambers rose from his chair and walked to the window, looked out. After\na moment's time, he turned and walked back again, sat down in his chair.\nLeaning back, he matched his fingertips, his teeth flashing in a grin\nunder his mustache.\n\n\"I don't know anything about what's going on,\" he said. \"I don't even\nknow someone has discovered material energy. That's up to Craven. He has\nto find it. Both you and Craven work alone. I know nothing about either\nof you.\"\n\nStutsman's jaw closed like a steel trap. \"I've always worked alone.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" said Chambers, the edge suddenly off his voice, \"how are\nthings going in the Jovian confederacy? I trust you left everything in\ngood shape.\"\n\n\"As good as could be expected,\" Stutsman replied. \"The people are still\nuneasy, half angry. They still remember Mallory.\"\n\n\"But Mallory,\" objected Chambers, \"is on a prison ship. In near Mercury\nnow, I believe.\"\n\nStutsman shook his head. \"They still remember him. We'll have trouble\nout there one of these days.\"\n\n\"I would hate to have that happen,\" remarked Chambers softly. \"I would\nregret it very much. I sent you out there to see that nothing happened.\"\n\n\"The trouble out there won't be a flash to this thing you were telling\nme about,\" snapped Stutsman.\n\n\"I'm leaving that in your hands, too,\" Chambers told him. \"I know you\ncan take care of it.\"\n\nStutsman rose. \"I can take care of it.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you can,\" Chambers said.\n\nHe remained standing after Stutsman left, looking at the door through\nwhich the man had gone. Maybe it had been a mistake to call Stutsman in\nfrom Callisto. Maybe it was a mistake to use Stutsman at all. He didn't\nlike a lot of things the man did ... or the way he did them. Brutal\nthings.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly Chambers sat down again and his face grew hard.\n\nHe had built an empire of many worlds. That couldn't be done with gentle\nmethods and no sure goal. Fighting every inch from planet to planet, he\nhad used power to gain power. And now that empire was threatened by two\nmen who had found a greater power. That threat had to be smashed! It\nwould be smashed!\n\nChambers leaned forward and pressed a buzzer.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Chambers?\" said a voice in the communicator.\n\n\"Send Dr. Craven in,\" commanded Chambers.\n\nCraven came in, slouchily, his hair standing on end, his eyes peering\nthrough the thick-lensed glasses.\n\n\"You sent for me,\" he growled, taking a chair.\n\n\"Yes, I did,\" said Chambers. \"Have a drink?\"\n\n\"No. And no smoke either.\"\n\nChambers took a long cigar from the box on his desk, clipped off the end\nand rolled it in his mouth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I'm a busy man,\" Craven reminded him.\n\nPuckering lines of amusement wrinkled Chambers' eyes as he lit up,\nwatching Craven.\n\n\"You do seem to be busy, Doctor,\" he said. \"I only wish you had\nsomething concrete to report.\"\n\nThe scientist bristled. \"I may have in a few days, if you leave me alone\nand let me work.\"\n\n\"I presume that you are still working on your radiation collector. Any\nprogress?\"\n\n\"Not too much. You can't expect a man to turn out discoveries to order.\nI'm working almost night and day now. If the thing can be solved, I'll\nsolve it.\"\n\nChambers glowed. \"Keep up the good work. But I wanted to talk to you\nabout something else. You heard, I suppose, that I lost a barrel of\nmoney on the Ranthoor exchange.\"\n\nCraven smiled, a sardonic twisting of his lips. \"I heard something about\nit.\"\n\n\"I thought you had,\" said Chambers sourly. \"If not, you would have been\nthe only one who hadn't heard how Ben Wrail took Chambers for a ride.\"\n\n\"He really took you then,\" commented Craven. \"I thought maybe it was\njust one of those stories.\"\n\n\"He took me, but that's not what's worrying me. I want to know how he\ndid it. No man, not even the most astute student of the market, could\nhave foretold the trend of the market the way he did. And Wrail isn't\nthe most astute. It isn't natural when a man who has always played the\nsafe side suddenly turns the market upside down. Even less natural when\nhe never makes a mistake.\"\n\n\"Well,\" demanded Craven, \"what do you want me to do about it? I'm a\nscientist. I've never owned a share of stock in my life.\"\n\n\"There's an angle to it that might interest you,\" said Chambers\nsmoothly, leaning back, puffing at the cigar. \"Wrail is a close friend\nof Manning. And Wrail himself didn't have the money it took to swing\nthose deals. Somebody furnished that money.\"\n\n\"Manning?\" asked Craven.\n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\n\"If Manning's mixed up in it,\" said Craven acidly, \"there isn't anything\nany of us can do about it. You're bucking money and genius together.\nThis Manning is no slouch of a scientist himself and Page is better.\nThey're a combination.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You think they're good?\" asked Chambers.\n\n\"Good? Didn't they discover material energy?\" The scientist glowered at\nhis employer. \"That ought to be answer enough.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" Chambers agreed irritably. \"But can you tell me how they\nworked this market deal?\"\n\nCraven grimaced. \"I can guess. Those boys didn't stop with just finding\nhow to harness material energy. They probably have more things than you\ncan even suspect. They were working with force fields, you remember,\nwhen they stumbled onto the energy. Force fields are something we don't\nknow much about. A man monkeying around with them is apt to find almost\nanything.\"\n\n\"What are you getting at?\"\n\n\"My guess would be that they have a new kind of television working in\nthe fourth dimension, using time as a factor. It would penetrate\nanything. Nothing could stop it. It could go anywhere, at a speed many\ntimes the speed of light ... almost instantaneously.\"\n\nChambers sat upright in his chair. \"Are you _sure_ about this?\"\n\nCraven shook his head. \"Just a guess. I tried to figure out what I would\ndo if I were Page and Manning and had the things they had. That's all.\"\n\n\"And what would you do?\"\n\nCraven smiled dourly. \"I'd be using that television right in this\noffice,\" he said. \"I'd keep you and me under observation all the time.\nIf what I think is true, Manning is watching us now and has heard every\nword we said.\"\n\nChambers' face was a harsh mask of anger. \"I don't believe it could be\ndone!\"\n\n\"Doctor Craven is right,\" said a quiet voice.\n\nChambers swung around in his chair and gasped. Greg Manning stood inside\nthe room, just in front of the desk.\n\n\"I hope you don't mind,\" said Greg. \"I've been wanting to have a talk\nwith you.\"\n\nCraven leaped to his feet, his eyes shining. \"Three dimensions!\" he\nwhispered. \"How did you do it?\"\n\nGreg chuckled. \"I haven't patented the idea, Doctor. I'd rather not tell\nyou just now.\"\n\n\"You will accept my congratulations, however?\" asked Craven.\n\n\"That's generous of you. I really hadn't expected this much.\"\n\n\"I mean it,\" said Craven. \"Damned if I don't.\" Chambers was on his feet,\nleaning across the desk, with his hand held out. Greg's right hand came\nout slowly.\n\n\"Sorry, I really can't shake hands,\" he said. \"I'm not here, you know.\nJust my image.\"\n\nChambers' hand dropped to the desk. \"Stupid of me not to realize that.\nYou looked so natural.\" He sat back in his chair again, brushed his gray\nmustache. A smile twisted his lips. \"So you've been watching me?\"\n\n\"Off and on,\" Greg said.\n\n\"And what is the occasion of this visit?\" asked Chambers. \"You could\nhave held a distinct advantage by remaining unseen. I didn't entirely\nbelieve what Craven told me, you know.\"\n\n\"That isn't the point at all,\" declared Greg. \"Maybe we can get to\nunderstand one another.\"\n\n\"So you're ready to talk business.\"\n\n\"Not in the sense you mean,\" Greg said. \"I'm not willing to make\nconcessions, but there's no reason why we have to fight one another.\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" said Chambers, \"there's no reason for that. I'll be willing\nto buy your discovery.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't sell it to you,\" Greg told him.\n\n\"You wouldn't? Why not? I'm prepared to pay for it.\"\n\n\"You'd pay the price, all right. Anything I asked ... even if it\nbankrupted you. Then you'd mark it down to loss, and scrap material\nenergy. And I'll tell you why.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA terrible silence hung in the room as the two men eyed one another\nacross the table.\n\n\"You wouldn't use it,\" Greg went on, \"because it would remove the\nstranglehold you have on the planets. It would make power too cheap. It\nwould eliminate the necessity of your rented accumulators. The Jovian\nmoons and Mars could stand on their feet without the power you ship to\nthem. You could make billions in legitimate profits selling the\napparatus to manufacture the energy ... but you wouldn't want that. You\nwant to be dictator of the Solar System. And that is what I intend to\nstop.\"\n\n\"Listen, Manning,\" said Chambers, \"you're a reasonable man. Let's talk\nthis thing over without anger. What do you plan to do?\"\n\n\"I could put my material engines on the market,\" said Greg. \"That would\nruin you. You wouldn't move an accumulator after that. Your\nInterplanetary stock wouldn't be worth the paper it is written on.\nMaterial energy would wipe you out.\"\n\n\"You forget I have franchises on those planets,\" Chambers reminded him.\n\"I'd fight you in the courts until hell froze over.\"\n\n\"I'd prove convenience, economy and necessity. Any court in any land, on\nany planet, would rule for me.\"\n\nChambers shook his head. \"Not Martian or Jovian courts. I'd tell them to\nrule for me and the courts outside of Earth do what I tell them to.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGreg straightened and backed from the desk. \"I hate to ruin a man.\nYou've worked hard. You've built a great company. I would be willing, in\nreturn for a hands-off policy on your part, to hold up any announcement\nof my material energy until you had time to get out, to save what you\ncould.\"\n\nHard fury masked Chambers' face. \"You'll never build a material energy\nengine outside your laboratory. Don't worry about ruining me. I won't\nallow you to stand in my way. I hope you understand.\"\n\n\"I understand too well. But even if you are a dictator out on Mars and\nVenus, even if you do own Mercury and boss the Jovian confederacy,\nyou're just a man to me. A man who stands for things that I don't like.\"\n\nGreg stopped and his eyes were like ice crystals.\n\n\"You talked to Stutsman today,\" he said. \"If I were you, I wouldn't let\nStutsman do anything rash. Russ Page and I might have to fight back.\"\n\nMockery tinged Chambers' voice. \"Am I to take this as a declaration of\nwar, Mr. Manning?\"\n\n\"Take it any way you like,\" Greg said. \"I came here to give you a\nproposition, and you tell me you're going to smash me. All I have to say\nto you, Chambers, is this--when you get ready to smash me, you'd better\nhave a deep, dark hole all picked out for yourself to hide in. Because\nI'll hand you back just double anything you hand out.\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER TEN_\n\n\n\"One of us will have to watch all the time,\" Greg told Russ. \"We can't\ntake any chances. Stutsman will try to reach us sooner or later and we\nhave to be ready for him.\"\n\nHe glanced at the new radar screen they had set up that morning beside\nthe bank of other controls. Any ship coming within a hundred miles of\nthe laboratory would be detected instantly and pinpointed.\n\nThe board flashed now. In the screen they saw a huge passenger ship\nspearing down toward the airport south of them.\n\n\"With the port that close,\" said Russ, \"we'll get a lot of signals.\"\n\n\"I ordered the Belgium factory to rush work on the ship,\" said Greg.\n\"But it will be a couple of weeks yet. We just have to sit tight and\nwait. As soon as we have the ship we'll start in on Chambers; but until\nwe get the ship, we just have to dig in and stay on the defensive.\"\n\nHe studied the scene in the screen. The ship had leveled off, was\nbanking in to the port. His eyes turned away, took in the laboratory\nwith its crowding mass of machinery.\n\n\"We don't want to fool ourselves about Chambers,\" he said. \"He may not\nhave the power here on Earth that he does on the other planets, but he's\ngot plenty. Feeling the way he does, he'll try to finish us off in a\nhurry now.\"\n\nRuss reached out to the table that stood beside the bank of controls and\npicked up a small, complicated mechanism. Its face bore nine dials, with\nthe needles on three of them apparently registering, the other six\nmotionless.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Greg.\n\n\"A mechanical detective,\" said Russ. \"A sort of mechanical shadow. While\nyou were busy with the stock market stunt, I made several of them. One\nfor Wilson and another for Chambers and still another for Craven.\" He\nhoisted and lowered the one in his hand. \"This one is for Stutsman.\"\n\n\"A shadow?\" asked Greg. \"Do you mean that thing will trail Stutsman?\"\n\n\"Not only trail him,\" said Russ. \"It will find him, wherever he may be.\nSome object every person wears or carries is made of iron or some other\nmagnetic metal. This 'shadow' contains a tiny bit of that ridiculous\nmilitary decoration that Stutsman never allows far away from him. Find\nthat decoration and you find Stutsman. In another one I have a chunk of\nWilson's belt buckle, that college buckle, you know, that he's so proud\nof. Chambers has a ring made of a piece of meteoric iron and that's the\nbait for another machine. Have a tiny piece off Craven's spectacles in\nhis machine. It was easy to get the stuff. The force field enables a man\nto reach out and take anything he wants to, from a massive machine to a\nmicroscopic bit of matter. It was a cinch to get the stuff I needed.\"\n\nRuss chuckled and put the machine back on the table. He gestured toward\nit.\n\n\"It maintains a tiny field similar to our television field,\" he\nexplained. \"But it's modified along a special derivation with a magnetic\nresult. It can follow and find the original mass of any metallic\nsubstance it may contain.\"\n\n\"Clever,\" commented Greg.\n\nRuss lit his pipe, puffed comfortably. \"We needed something like that.\"\n\nThe red light on the board snapped on and blinked. Russ reached out and\nslammed home the lever, twirled dials. It was only another passenger\nship. They relaxed, but not too much.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I wonder what he's up to,\" said Russ.\n\nStutsman's car had stopped in the dock section of New York. Crumbling,\nrotting piers and old tumbledown warehouses, deserted and unused since\nthe last ship sailed the ocean before giving way to air commerce, loomed\ndarkly, like grim ghosts, in the darkness.\n\nStutsman had gotten out of the car and said: \"Wait here.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the voice of the driver.\n\nStutsman strode away, down a dark street. The televisor kept pace with\nhim and on the screen he could be seen as a darker shape moving among\nthe shadows of that old, almost forgotten section of the Solar System's\ngreatest city.\n\nAnother shadow detached itself from the darkness of the street, shuffled\ntoward Stutsman.\n\n\"Sir,\" said a whining voice, \"I haven't eaten ...\"\n\nThere was a swift movement as Stutsman's stick lashed out, a thud as it\nconnected with the second shadow's head. The shadow crumpled on the\npavement. Stutsman strode on.\n\nGreg sucked in his breath. \"He isn't very sociable tonight.\"\n\nStutsman ducked into an alley where even deeper darkness lay. Russ, with\na delicate adjustment, slid the televisor along, closer to Stutsman,\ndetermined not to lose sight of him for an instant.\n\nThe man suddenly turned into a doorway so black that nothing could be\nseen. Sounds of sharp, impatient rappings came out of the screen as\nStutsman struck the door with his stick.\n\nBrilliant illumination sprang out over the doorway, but Stutsman seemed\nnot to see it, went on knocking. The colors on the screen were\npeculiarly distorted.\n\n\"Ultra-violet,\" grunted Greg. \"Whoever he's calling on wants to have a\ngood look before letting anybody in.\"\n\nThe door creaked open and a shaft of normal light spewed out into the\nstreet, turning its murkiness to pallid yellow.\n\nStutsman stepped inside.\n\nThe man at the door jerked his head. \"Back room,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe televisor slid through the door into the lighted room behind\nStutsman. Dust lay thick on the woodwork and floors. Patches of plaster\nhad broken away. Furrows zigzagged across the floor, marking the path of\nheavy boxes or furniture which had been pushed along in utter disdain of\nthe flooring. Cheap wall-paper hung in tatters from the walls, streaked\nwith water from some broken pipe.\n\nBut the back room was a startling contrast to the first. Rich,\ncomfortable furniture filled it. The floor was covered with a\nsteel-cloth rug and steel-cloth hangings, colorfully painted, hid the\nwalls.\n\nA man sat under a lamp, reading a newspaper. He rose to his feet, like\nthe sudden uncoiling of springs.\n\nRuss gasped. That face was one of the best known faces in the entire\nSolar System. A ratlike face, with cruel cunning printed on it that had\nbeen on front pages and TV screens often, but never for pay.\n\n\"Scorio!\" whispered Russ.\n\nGreg nodded and his lips were drawn tight.\n\n\"Stutsman,\" said Scorio, surprised. \"You're the last person in the world\nI was expecting. Come in. Have a chair. Make yourself comfortable.\"\n\nStutsman snorted. \"This isn't a social call.\"\n\n\"I didn't figure it was,\" replied the gangster, \"but sit down anyway.\"\n\nGingerly Stutsman sat down on the edge of a chair, hunched forward.\nScorio resumed his seat and waited.\n\n\"I have a job for you,\" Stutsman announced bluntly.\n\n\"Fine. It isn't often you have one for me. Three-four years ago, wasn't\nit?\"\n\n\"We may be watched,\" warned Stutsman.\n\nThe mobster started from his chair, his eyes darting about the room.\n\nStutsman grunted disgustedly. \"If we're watched, there isn't anything we\ncan do about it.\"\n\n\"We can't, huh?\" snarled the gangster. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because the watcher is on the West Coast. We can't reach him. If he's\nwatching, he can see every move we make, hear every word we say.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Greg Manning or Russ Page,\" said Stutsman. \"You've heard of them?\"\n\n\"Sure. I heard of them.\"\n\n\"They have a new kind of television,\" said Stutsman. \"They can see and\nhear everything that's happening on Earth, perhaps in all the Solar\nSystem. But I don't think they're watching us now. Craven has a machine\nthat can detect their televisor. It registers certain field effects they\nuse. They weren't watching when I left Craven's laboratory just a few\nminutes ago. They may have picked me up since, but I don't think so.\"\n\n\"So Craven has made a detector,\" said Greg calmly. \"He can tell when\nwe're watching now.\"\n\n\"He's a clever cuss,\" agreed Russ.\n\n\"Take a look at that machine now,\" urged Scorio. \"See if they're\nwatching. You shouldn't have come here. You should have let me know and\nI would have met you some place. I can't have people knowing where my\nhideout is.\"\n\n\"Quiet down,\" snapped Stutsman. \"I haven't got the machine. It weighs\nhalf a ton.\"\n\nScorio sank deeper into his chair, worried. \"Do you want to take a\nchance and talk business?\"\n\n\"Certainly. That's why I'm here. This is the proposition. Manning and\nPage are working in a laboratory out on the West Coast, in the\nmountains. I'll give you the exact location later. They have some papers\nwe want. We wouldn't mind if something happened to the laboratory. It\nmight, for example blow up. But we want the papers first.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nScorio said nothing. His face was quiet and cunning.\n\n\"Give me the papers,\" said Stutsman, \"and I'll see that you get to any\nplanet you want to. And I'll give you two hundred thousand in\nInterplanetary Credit certificates. Give me proof that the laboratory\nblew up or melted down or something else happened to it and I'll boost\nthe figure to five hundred thousand.\"\n\nScorio did not move a muscle as he asked: \"Why don't you have some of\nyour own mob do this job?\"\n\n\"Because I can't be connected with it in any way,\" said Stutsman. \"If\nyou slip up and something happens, I won't be able to do a thing for\nyou. That's why the price is high.\"\n\nThe gangster's eyes slitted. \"If the papers are worth that much to you,\nwhy wouldn't they be worth as much to me?\"\n\n\"They wouldn't be worth a dime to you.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because you couldn't read them,\" said Stutsman.\n\n\"I can read,\" retorted the gangster.\n\n\"Not the kind of language on those papers. There aren't more than two\ndozen people in the Solar System who could read it, perhaps a dozen who\ncould understand it, maybe half a dozen who could follow the directions\nin the papers.\" He leaned forward and jabbed a forefinger at the\ngangster. \"And there are only two people in the System who could write\nit.\"\n\n\"What the hell kind of a language is it that only two dozen people could\nread?\"\n\n\"It isn't a language, really. It's mathematics.\"\n\n\"Oh, arithmetic.\"\n\n\"No,\" Stutsman said. \"Mathematics. You see? You don't even know the\ndifference between the two, so what good would the papers do you?\"\n\nScorio nodded. \"Yeah, you're right.\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER ELEVEN_\n\n\nThe Paris-Berlin express thundered through the night, a gigantic ship\nthat rode high above the Earth. Far below one could see the dim lights\nof eastern Europe.\n\nHarry Wilson pressed his face against the window, staring down. There\nwas nothing to see but the tiny lights. They were alone, he and the\nother occupants of the ship ... alone in the dark world that surrounded\nthem.\n\nBut Wilson sensed some other presence in the ship, someone besides the\npilot and his mechanics up ahead, the hostess and the three stodgy\ntraveling men who were his fellow passengers.\n\nWilson's hair ruffled at the base of his skull, tingling with an unknown\nfear that left him shaken.\n\nA voice whispered in his ear: \"Harry Wilson. So you are running away!\"\n\nJust a tiny voice that seemed hardly a voice at all, it seemed at once\nto come from far away and yet from very near. The voice, with an edge of\ncoldness on it, was one he never would forget.\n\nHe cowered in his seat, whimpering.\n\nThe voice came again: \"Didn't I tell you that you couldn't run away?\nThat no matter where you went, I'd find you?\"\n\n\"Go away,\" Wilson whispered huskily. \"Leave me alone. Haven't you\nhounded me enough?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered the voice, \"not enough. Not yet. You sold us out. You\nwarned Chambers about our energy and now Chambers is sending men to kill\nus. But they won't succeed, Wilson.\"\n\n\"You can't hurt me,\" said Wilson defiantly. \"You can't do anything but\ntalk to me. You're trying to drive me mad, but you can't. I won't let\nyou. I'm not going to pay any more attention to you.\"\n\nThe whisper chuckled.\n\n\"You can't,\" argued Wilson wildly. \"All you can do is talk to me. You've\nnever done anything but that. You drove me out of New York and out of\nLondon and now you're driving me out of Paris. But Berlin is as far as I\nwill go. I won't listen to you any more.\"\n\n\"Wilson,\" whispered the voice, \"look inside your bag. The bag, Wilson,\nwhere you are carrying that money. That stack of credit certificates.\nAlmost eleven thousand dollars, what is left of the twenty thousand\nChambers paid you.\"\n\nWith a wild cry Wilson clawed at his bag, snapped it open, pawed through\nit.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe credit certificates were gone!\n\n\"You took my money,\" he shrieked. \"You took everything I had. I haven't\ngot a cent. Nothing except a few dollars in my pocket.\"\n\n\"You haven't got that either, Wilson,\" whispered the voice.\n\nThere was a sound of ripping cloth as something like a great, powerful\nhand flung aside Wilson's coat, tore away the inside pocket. There was a\nbrief flash of a wallet and a bundle of papers, which vanished.\n\nThe hostess was hurrying toward him.\n\n\"Is there something wrong?\"\n\n\"They took ...\" Wilson began and stopped.\n\nWhat could he tell her? Could he say that a man half way across the\nworld had robbed him?\n\nThe three traveling men were looking at him.\n\n\"I'm sorry, miss,\" he stammered. \"I really am. I fell asleep and\ndreamed.\"\n\nHe sat down again, shaken. Shivering, he huddled back into the corner of\nhis seat. His hands explored the torn coat pocket. He was stranded, high\nin the air, somewhere between Paris and Berlin ... stranded without\nmoney, without a passport, with nothing but the clothes he wore and the\nfew personal effects in his bag.\n\nFighting to calm himself, he tried to reason out his plight. The plane\nwas entering the Central European Federation and that, definitely, was\nno place to be without a passport or without visible means of support. A\nthousand possibilities flashed through his mind. They might think he was\na spy. He might be cited for illegal entry. He might be framed by secret\npolice.\n\nTerror perched on his shoulder and whispered to him. He shivered\nviolently and drew farther back into the corner of the seat. He clasped\nhis hands, beat them against his huddled knees.\n\nHe would cable friends back in America and have them identify him and\nvouch for his character. He would borrow some money from them, just\nenough to get back to America. But whom would he cable? And with aching\nbitterness in his breast, Harry Wilson came face to face with the\nhorrible realization that nowhere in the world, nowhere in the Solar\nSystem, was there a single person who was his friend. There was no one\nto help him.\n\nHe bowed his head in his hands and sobbed, his shoulders jerking\nspasmodically, the sobs racking his body.\n\nThe traveling men stared at him unable to understand. The hostess looked\nbriskly helpless. Wilson knew he looked like a scared fool and he didn't\ncare.\n\nHe _was_ scared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGregory Manning riffled the sheaf of credit certificates, the wallet,\nthe passport and pile of other papers that lay upon the desk in front of\nhim.\n\n\"That closes one little incident,\" he said grimly. \"That takes care of\nour friend Wilson.\"\n\n\"Maybe you were a bit too harsh with him, Greg,\" suggested Russell Page.\n\nGreg shook his head. \"He was a traitor, the lowest thing alive. He sold\nthe confidence we placed in him. He traded something that was not his to\ntrade. He did it for money and now I've taken that money from him.\"\n\nHe shoved the pile of certificates to one side.\n\n\"Now I've got this stuff,\" he said, \"I don't know what to do with it. We\ndon't want to keep it.\"\n\n\"Why not send it to Chambers?\" suggested Russ. \"He will find the\npassport and the money on his desk in the morning. Give him something to\nthink about tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER TWELVE_\n\n\nScorio snarled at the four men: \"I want you to get the thing done right.\nI don't want bungling. Understand?\"\n\nThe bulky, flat-faced man with the scar across his cheek shuffled\nuneasily. \"We went over it a dozen times. We know just what to do.\"\n\nHe grinned at Scorio, but the grin was lopsided, more like a sneering\ngrimace. At one time the man had failed to side-step a heat ray and it\nhad left a neat red line drawn across the right cheek, nipped the end of\nthe ear.\n\n\"All right, Pete,\" said Scorio, glaring at the man, \"your job is the\nheavy work, so just keep your mind on it. You've got the two heaters and\nthe kit.\"\n\nPete grinned lopsidedly again. \"Yeah, my own kit. I can open anything\nhollow with this rig.\"\n\n\"You got a real job tonight,\" snarled Scorio. \"Two doors and a safe.\nSure you can do it?\"\n\n\"Just leave it to me,\" Pete growled.\n\n\"Chizzy, you're to pilot,\" Scorio snapped. \"Know the coordinates?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said Chizzy, \"know them by heart. Do it with my eyes shut.\"\n\n\"Keep your eyes open. We can't have anything go wrong. This is too\nimportant. You swoop in at top speed and land on the roof. Stand by the\ncontrols and keep a hand on the big heater just in case of trouble.\nPete, Max and Reg will go to the lockdoor. Reg will stay there with the\nbuzzer and three drums of ammunition.\"\n\nHe whirled on Reg. \"You got that ammunition?\"\n\nReg nodded emphatically. \"Four drums of it,\" he said. \"One solid round\nin the gun. Another drum of solid and two explosive.\"\n\n\"There's a thousand rounds in each drum,\" snapped Scorio, \"but they last\nonly a minute, so do your firing in bursts.\"\n\n\"I ain't handled buzzers all these years without knowing something about\nthem.\"\n\n\"There's only two men there,\" said Scorio, \"and they'll probably be\nasleep. Come down with your motor dead. The lab roof is thick and the\nplane landing on those thick tires won't wake them. But be on your guard\nall the time. Pete and Max will go through the lockdoor into the\nlaboratory and open the safe. Dump all the papers and money and whatever\nelse you find into the bags and then get out fast. Hop into the plane\nand take off. When you're clear of the building, turn the heaters on it.\nI want it melted down and the men and stuff inside with it. Don't leave\neven a button unmelted. Get it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Sure, chief,\" said Pete. He dusted his hands together.\n\n\"Now get going. Beat it.\"\n\nThe four men turned and filed out of the room, through the door leading\nto the tumbledown warehouse where was hidden the streamlined metal ship.\nSwiftly they entered it and the ship nosed gently upward, blasting out\nthrough a broken, frameless skylight, climbing up and up, over the\ngleaming spires of New York.\n\nBack in the room hung with steel-cloth curtains, alone, Scorio lit a\ncigarette and chuckled. \"They won't have a chance,\" he said.\n\n\"Who won't?\" asked a tiny voice from almost in front of him.\n\n\"Why, Manning and Page ...\" said Scorio, and then stopped. The fire of\nthe match burned down and scorched his fingers. He dropped it. \"Who\nasked that?\" he roared.\n\n\"I did,\" said the piping voice.\n\nScorio looked down. A three-inch man sat on a matchbox on the desk!\n\n\"Who are you?\" the gangster shouted.\n\n\"I'm Manning,\" said the little man. \"The one you're going to kill. Don't\nyou remember?\"\n\n\"Damn you!\" shrieked Scorio. His hand flipped open a drawer and pulled\nout a flame pistol. The muzzle of the pistol came up and blasted.\nScrewed down to its smallest diameter, the gun's aim was deadly. A\nstraight lance of flame, no bigger than a pencil, streamed out, engulfed\nthe little man, bored into the table top. The box of matches exploded\nwith a gush of red that was a dull flash against the blue blaze of the\ngun.\n\nBut the figure of the man stood _within the flame_! Stood there and\nwaved an arm at Scorio. The piping voice came out of the heart of the\ngun's breath.\n\n\"Maybe I'd better get a bit smaller. Make me harder to hit. More sport\nthat way.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nScorio's finger lifted from the trigger. The flame snapped off.\nLaboriously climbing out of the still smoking furrow left in the oaken\ntable top was Greg Manning, not more than an inch tall now.\n\nThe gangster laid the gun on the table, stepped closer, warily. With the\npalm of a mighty hand he swatted viciously at the little figure.\n\n\"I got you now!\"\n\nBut the figure seemed to ooze upright between his fingers, calmly\nstepped off his hand onto the table. And now it began to grow. Watching\nit, Scorio saw it grow to six inches and there it stopped.\n\n\"What are you?\" he breathed.\n\n\"I told you,\" said the little image. \"I'm Gregory Manning. The man you\nset out to kill. I've watched every move you've made and known\neverything you planned.\"\n\n\"But that isn't possible,\" protested Scorio. \"You're out on the West\nCoast. This is some trick. I'm just seeing things.\"\n\n\"You aren't seeing anything imaginary. I'm really here, in this room\nwith you. I could lift my finger and kill you if I wished ... and maybe\nI should.\"\n\nScorio stepped back a pace.\n\n\"But I'm not going to,\" said Manning. \"I have something better saved for\nyou. Something more appropriate.\"\n\n\"You can't touch me!\"\n\n\"Look,\" said Manning sternly. He pointed his finger at a chair. It\nsuddenly grew cloudy, became a wisp of trailing smoke, was gone.\n\nThe gangster backed away, eyes glued to the spot where the chair had\nvanished.\n\n\"Look here,\" piped the little voice. Scorio jerked his head around and\nlooked.\n\nThe chair was in Manning's hand. A tiny chair, but the very one that had\ndisappeared from the room a moment before.\n\n\"Watch out!\" warned Manning, and heaved the chair. The tiny chair\nseemed to float in the air. Then with a rush it gathered speed, grew\nlarger. In a split second it was a full-sized chair and it was hurtling\nstraight at the gangster's head.\n\nWith a strangled cry Scorio threw up his arms. The chair crashed into\nhim, bowled him over.\n\n\"Now do you believe me?\" demanded Manning.\n\nScrambling to his feet, Scorio gibbered madly, for the six-inch figure\nwas growing. He became as large as the average man, and then much\nlarger. His head cleared the high ceiling by scant inches. His mighty\nhands reached out for the gangster.\n\nScorio scuttled away on hands and knees, yelping with terror.\n\nPowerful hands seemed to seize and lift him. The room was blotted out.\nThe Earth was gone. He was in a place where there was nothing. No light,\nno heat, no gravitation. For one searing, blasting second he seemed to\nbe floating in strangely suspended animation. Then with a jolt he became\naware of new surroundings.\n\nHe blinked his eyes and looked around. He was in a great laboratory that\nhummed faintly with the suggestion of terrific power, that smelled of\nozone and seemed filled with gigantic apparatus.\n\nTwo men stood in front of him.\n\nHe staggered back.\n\n\"Manning!\" he gasped.\n\nManning grinned savagely at him. \"Sit down, Scorio. You won't have long\nto wait. Your boys will be along any minute now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChizzy crouched over the controls, his eyes on the navigation chart.\nOnly the thin screech of parted air disturbed the silence of the ship.\nThe high scream and the slow, precise snack-snack of cards as Reg and\nMax played a game of double solitaire with a cold, emotionless\nprecision.\n\nThe plane was near the stratosphere, well off the traveled air lanes. It\nwas running without lights, but the cabin bulbs were on, carefully\nshielded.\n\nPete sat in the co-pilot's chair beside Chizzy. His blank,\nexpressionless eyes stared straight ahead.\n\n\"I don't like this job,\" he complained.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Chizzy.\n\n\"Page and Manning aren't the kind of guys a fellow had ought to be\nfooling around with. They ain't just chumps. You fool with characters\nlike them and you got trouble.\"\n\nChizzy growled at him disgustedly, bent to his controls.\n\nStraight ahead was a thin sliver of a dying Moon that gave barely\nenough illumination to make out the great, rugged blocks of the\nmountains, like dark, shadowy brush-strokes on a newly started canvas.\n\nPete shuddered. There was something about the thin, watery moonlight,\nand those brush-stroke hills....\n\n\"It seems funny up here,\" he said.\n\n\"Hell,\" growled Chizzy, \"you're going soft in your old age.\"\n\nSilence fell between the two. The snack-snack of the cards continued.\n\n\"You ain't got nothing to be afraid of,\" Chizzy told Pete. \"This tub is\nthe safest place in the world. She's overpowered a dozen times. She can\noutfly anything in the air. She's rayproof and bulletproof and\nbombproof. Nothing can hurt us.\"\n\nBut Pete wasn't listening. \"That moonlight makes a man see things. Funny\nthings. Like pictures in the night.\"\n\n\"You're balmy,\" declared Chizzy.\n\nPete started out of his seat. His voice gurgled in his throat. He\npointed with a shaking finger out into the night.\n\n\"Look!\" he yelled \"Look!\"\n\nChizzy rose out of his seat ... and froze in sudden terror.\n\nStraight ahead of the ship, etched in silvery moon-lines against the\nbackground of the star-sprinkled sky, was a grim and terrible face.\n\nIt was as big and hard as a mountain.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER THIRTEEN_\n\n\nThe ship was silent now. Even the whisper of the cards had stopped. Reg\nand Max were on their feet, startled by the cries of Pete and Chizzy.\n\n\"It's Manning!\" shrieked Pete. \"He's watching us!\"\n\nChizzy's hand whipped out like a striking snake toward the controls and,\nas he grasped them, his face went deathly white. For the controls were\nlocked! They resisted all the strength he threw against them and the\nship still bore on toward that mocking face that hung above the Earth.\n\n\"Do something!\" screamed Max. \"You damn fool, do something!\"\n\n\"I can't,\" moaned Chizzy. \"The ship is out of control.\"\n\nIt seemed impossible. That ship was fast and tricky and it had reserve\npower far beyond any possible need. It handled like a dream ... it was\ntops in aircraft. But there was no doubt that some force more powerful\nthan the engines and controls of the ship itself had taken over.\n\n\"Manning's got us!\" squealed Pete. \"We came out to get him and now he\nhas us instead!\"\n\nThe craft was gaining speed. The whining shriek of the air against its\nplates grew thinner and higher. Listening, one could almost feel and\nhear the sucking of the mighty power that pulled it at an ever greater\npace through the tenuous atmosphere.\n\nThe face was gone from the sky now. Only the Moon remained, the Moon and\nthe brush-stroke mountains far below.\n\nThen, suddenly, the speed was slowing and the ship glided downward, down\ninto the saw-teeth of the mountains.\n\n\"We're falling!\" yelled Max, and Chizzy growled at him.\n\nBut they weren't falling. The ship leveled off and floated, suspended\nabove a sprawling laboratory upon a mountain top.\n\n\"That's Manning's laboratory,\" whispered Pete in terror-stricken tones.\n\nThe levers yielded unexpectedly. Chizzy flung the power control over,\ndrove the power of the accumulator bank, all the reserve, into the\nengines. The ship lurched, but did not move. The engines whined and\nscreamed in torture. The cabin's interior was filled with a blast of\nheat, the choking odor of smoke and hot rubber. The heavy girders of the\nframe creaked under the mighty forward thrust of the engines ... but the\nship stood still, frozen above that laboratory in the hills.\n\nChizzy, hauling back the lever, turned around, pale. His hand began\nclawing for his heat gun. Then he staggered back. For there were only\ntwo men in the cabin with him--Reg and Max. Pete had gone!\n\n\"He just disappeared,\" Max jabbered. \"He was standing there in front of\nus. Then all at once he seemed to fade, as if he was turning into smoke.\nThen he was gone.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomething had descended about Pete. There was no sound, no light, no\nheat. He had no sense of weight. It was as if, suddenly, his mind had\nbecome disembodied.\n\nSeeing and hearing and awareness came back to him as one might turn on a\nlight. From the blackness and the eventless existence of a split second\nbefore, he was catapulted into a world of light and sound.\n\nIt was a world that hummed with power, that was ablaze with light, a\nlaboratory that seemed crammed with mighty banks of massive machinery,\nlighted by great globes of creamy brightness, shedding an illumination\nwhite as sunlight, yet shadowless as the light of a cloudy day.\n\nTwo men stood in front of him, looking at him, one with a faint smile on\nhis lips, the other with lines of fear etched across his face. The\nsmiling one was Gregory Manning and the one who was afraid was Scorio!\n\nWith a start, Pete snatched his pistol from its holster. The sights came\nup and lined on Manning as he pressed the trigger. But the lancing heat\nthat sprang from the muzzle of the gun never reached Manning. It seemed\nto strike an obstruction less than a foot away. It mushroomed with a\nflare of scorching radiance that drove needles of agony into the\ngangster's body.\n\nHis finger released its pressure and the gun dangled limply from his\nhand. He moaned with the pain of burns upon his unprotected face and\nhands. He beat feebly at tiny, licking blazes that ran along his\nclothing.\n\nManning was still smiling at him.\n\n\"You can't reach me, Pete,\" he said. \"You can only hurt yourself. You're\nenclosed within a solid wall of force that matter cannot penetrate.\"\n\nA voice came from one corner of the room: \"I'll bring Chizzy down next.\"\n\nPete whirled around and saw Russell Page for the first time. The\nscientist sat in front of a great control board, his swift, skillful\nfingers playing over the banks of keys, his eyes watching the instrument\nand the screen that slanted upward from the control banks.\n\nPete felt dizzy as he stared at the screen. He could see the interior of\nthe ship he had been yanked from a moment before. He could see his three\ncompanions, talking excitedly, frightened by his disappearance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis eyes flicked away from the screen, looked up through the skylight\nabove him. Outlined against the sky hung the ship. At the nose and\nstern, two hemispheres of blue-white radiance fitted over the metal\nframework, like the jaws of a powerful vise, holding the craft\nimmovable.\n\nHis gaze went back to the screen again, just in time to see Chizzy\ndisappear. It was as if the man had been a mere figure chalked upon a\nboard ... and then someone had taken a sponge and wiped him out.\n\nRuss's fingers were flying over the keys. His thumb reached out and\ntripped a lever. There was a slight hum of power.\n\nAnd Chizzy stood beside him.\n\nChizzy did not pull his gun. He whimpered and cowered within the\ninvisible cradle of force.\n\n\"You're yellow,\" Pete snarled at him, but Chizzy only covered his eyes\nwith his arms.\n\n\"Look, boss,\" said Pete, addressing Scorio, \"what are you doing here? We\nleft you back in New York.\"\n\nScorio did not answer. He merely glared. Pete lapsed into silence,\nwatching.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nManning stood poised before the captives, rocking back and forth on his\nheels.\n\n\"A nice bag for one evening,\" he told Russ.\n\nRuss grinned and stoked up his pipe.\n\nManning turned to the gangster chief. \"What do you think we ought to do\nwith these fellows? We can't leave them in those force shells too long\nbecause they'll die for lack of air. And we can't let them loose because\nthey might use their guns on us.\"\n\n\"Listen, Manning,\" Scorio rasped hoarsely, \"just name your price to let\nus loose. We'll do anything you want.\"\n\nManning drew his mouth down. \"I can't think of a thing. We just don't\nseem to have any use for you.\"\n\n\"Then what in hell,\" the gangster asked shakily, \"are you going to do\nwith us?\"\n\n\"You know,\" said Manning, \"I may be a bit old-fashioned along some\nlines. Maybe I am. I just don't like the idea of killing people for\nmoney. I don't like people stealing things other people have worked hard\nto get. I don't like thieves and murderers and thugs corrupting city\ngovernments, taking tribute on every man, woman and child in our big\ncities.\"\n\n\"But look here, Manning,\" pleaded Scorio, \"we'd be good citizens if we\njust had a chance.\"\n\nManning's face hardened. \"You sent these men here to kill us tonight,\ndidn't you?\"\n\n\"Well, not exactly. Stutsman kind of wanted you killed, but I told the\nboys just to get the stuff in the safe and never mind killing you. I\nsaid to them that you were pretty good eggs and I didn't like to bump\nyou off, see?\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Manning.\n\nHe turned his back on Scorio and started to walk away. The gangster\nchief came half-way out of his chair, and as he did so, Russ reached out\na single finger and tapped a key. Scorio screamed and beat with his\nfists against the wall of force that had suddenly formed about him. That\nsingle tap on the great keyboard had sprung a trap, had been the one\nfactor necessary to bring into being a force shell already spun and\nwaiting for him.\n\nManning did not even turn around at Scorio's scream. He slowly paced his\nway down the line of standing gangsters. He stopped in front of Pete and\nlooked at him.\n\n\"Pete,\" he said, \"you've sprung a good many prisons, haven't you?\"\n\n\"There ain't a jug in the System that can hold me,\" Pete boasted, \"and\nthat's a fact.\"\n\n\"I believe there's one that could,\" Greg told him. \"One that no man has\never escaped from, or ever will.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" demanded Pete.\n\n\"The Vulcan Fleet,\" said Greg.\n\nPete looked into the eyes of the man before him and read the purpose in\nthose eyes. \"Don't send me there! Send me any place but there!\"\n\nGreg turned to Russ and nodded. Russ's fingers played their tune of doom\nupon the keyboard. His thumb depressed a lever. With a roar five\ngigantic material energy engines screamed with thrumming power.\n\nPete disappeared.\n\nThe engines roared with thunderous throats, a roar that seemed to drown\nthe laboratory in solid waves of sound. A curious refractive effect\ndeveloped about the straining hulks as space near them bent under their\nlashing power.\n\nMonths ago Russ and Greg had learned a better way of transmitting power\nthan by metal bars or through conducting beams. Beams of such power as\nwere developing now would have smashed atoms to protons and electrons.\nThrough a window in the side of the near engine, Greg could see the iron\ningot used as fuel dwindling under the sucking force.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe droning died and only a hum remained.\n\n\"He's in a prison now he'll never get out of,\" said Greg calmly. \"I\nwonder what they'll think when they find him, dressed in civilian\nclothes and carrying a heat gun. They'll clap him into a photo-cell and\nkeep him there until they investigate. When they find out who he is, he\nwon't get out--he has enough unfinished prison sentences to last a\ncentury or two.\"\n\nFor Pete was on one of the Vulcan Fleet ships, the hell-ships of the\nprison fleet. There were confined only the most vicious and the most\ndepraved of the Solar System's criminals. He would be forced to work\nunder the flaming whip-lashes of a Sun that hurled such intense\nradiations that mere spacesuits were no protection at all. The workers\non the Vulcan Fleet ships wore suits that were in reality photo-cells\nwhich converted the deadly radiations into electric power. For electric\npower can be disposed of where heat cannot.\n\nQuailing inside his force shell, Scorio saw his men go, one by one. Saw\nthem lifted and whisked away, out through the depths of space by the\nmagic touch upon the keyboards. With terror-widened eyes he watched\nRuss set up the equations, saw him trip the activating lever, saw the\nmen disappear, listened to the thunderous rumbling of the mighty\nengines.\n\nChizzy went to the Outpost, the harsh prison on Neptune's satellite. Reg\nwent to Titan, clear across the Solar System, where men in the infamous\npenal colony labored in the frigid wastes of that moon of Saturn. Max\nwent to Vesta, the asteroid prison, which long had been the target of\nreformers, who claimed that on it 50 per cent of the prisoners died of\nboredom and fear.\n\nMax was gone and only Scorio remained.\n\n\"Stutsman's the one who got us into this,\" wailed the gangster. \"He's\nthe man you want to get. Not me. Not the boys. Stutsman.\"\n\n\"I promise you,\" said Greg, \"that we'll take care of Stutsman.\"\n\n\"And Chambers, too,\" chattered Scorio. \"But you can't touch Chambers.\nYou wouldn't dare.\"\n\n\"We're not worrying about Chambers,\" Greg told him. \"We're not worrying\nabout anyone. You're the one who had better start doing some.\"\n\nScorio cringed.\n\n\"Let me tell you about a place on Venus,\" said Greg. \"It's in the center\nof a big swamp that stretches for hundreds of miles in every direction.\nIt's a sort of mountain rising out of the swamp. And the swamp is filled\nwith beasts and reptiles of every kind. Ravenous things, lusting for\nblood. But they don't climb the mountain. A man, if he stayed on the\nmountain, would be safe. There's food there. Roots and berries and\nfruits and even small animals one could kill. A man might go hungry for\na while, but soon he'd find the things to eat.\n\n\"But he'd be alone. No one ever goes near that mountain. I am the only\nman who ever set foot on it. Perhaps no one ever will again. At night\nyou hear the screaming and the crying of the things down in swamp, but\nyou mustn't pay any attention to them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nScorio's eyes widened, staring. \"You won't send me _there_!\"\n\n\"You'll find my campfires,\" Greg told him, \"if the rain hasn't washed\nthem away. It rains a lot. So much and so drearily that you'll want to\nleave that mountain and walk down into the swamp, of your own free will,\nand let the monsters finish you.\"\n\nScorio sat dully. He did not move. Horror glazed his eyes.\n\nGreg signed to Russ. Russ, pipe clenched between his teeth, reached out\nhis fingers for the keys. The engines droned.\n\nManning walked slowly to a television control, sat down in the chair\nand flipped over a lever. A face stared out of the screen. It was\nstrangely filled with anger and a sort of half-fear.\n\n\"You watched it, didn't you, Stutsman?\" Greg asked.\n\nStutsman nodded. \"I watched. You can't get away with it, Manning. You\ncan't take the law into your own hands that way.\"\n\n\"You and Chambers have been taking the law into your hands for years,\"\nsaid Greg. \"All I did tonight was clear the Earth of some vermin. Every\none of those men was guilty of murder ... and worse.\"\n\n\"What did you gain by it?\" asked Stutsman.\n\nGreg gave a bitter laugh. \"I convinced you, Stutsman,\" he said, \"that it\nisn't so easy to kill me. I think it'll be some time before you try\nagain. Better luck next time.\"\n\nHe flipped the switch and turned about in the chair.\n\nRuss jerked his thumb at the skylight. \"Might as well finish the ship\nnow.\"\n\nGreg nodded.\n\nAn instant later there was a fierce, intolerably blue-white light that\nlit the mountains for many miles. For just an instant it flared,\nexploding into millions of brilliant, harmless sparks that died into\ndarkness before they touched the ground. The gangster ship was destroyed\nbeyond all tracing, disintegrated. The metal and quartz of which it was\nmade were simply gone.\n\nRuss brought his glance back from the skylight, looked at his friend.\n\"Stutsman will do everything he can to wipe us out. By tomorrow morning\nthe Interplanetary machine will be rolling. With only one purpose--to\ncrush us.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Greg agreed, \"but we're ready for them now. Our ship\nleft the Belgium factories several hours ago. The _Comet_ towed it out\nin space and it's waiting for us now. In a few hours the _Comet_ will be\nhere to pick us up.\"\n\n\"War in space,\" said Russ, musingly. \"That's what it will be.\"\n\n\"Chambers and his gang won't fight according to any rules. There'll be\nno holds barred, no more feeble attempts like the one they tried\ntonight. From now on we need a base that simply can't be located.\"\n\n\"The ship,\" said Russ.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER FOURTEEN_\n\n\nThe _Invincible_ hung in space, an empty, airless hull, the largest\nthing afloat.\n\nChartered freighters, leaving their ports from distant parts of the\nEarth, had converged upon her hours before, had unloaded crated\napparatus, storing it in the yawning hull. Then they had departed.\n\nNow the sturdy little space-yacht, _Comet_, was towing the great ship\nout into space, 500,000 miles beyond the orbit of the Moon. Slowly the\nhull was being taken farther and farther away from possible discovery.\n\nWork on the installation of the apparatus had started almost as soon as\nthe _Comet_ had first tugged at the ponderous mass. Leaving only a\nskeleton crew in charge of the _Comet_, the rest of the selected crew\nhad begun the assembly of the mighty machines which would transform the\n_Invincible_ into a thing of unimaginable power and speed.\n\nThe doors were closed and sealed and the air, already stored in the\nship's tanks, was released. The slight acceleration of the _Comet's_\ntowing served to create artificial weight for easier work, but not\nenough to handicap the shifting of the heavier pieces of apparatus. An\nelectric cable was run back from the little yacht and the _Invincible_\ntook her first breath of life.\n\nThe work advanced rapidly, for every man was more than a mere engineer\nor spacebuster. They were a selected crew, the men who had helped to\nmake the name of Gregory Manning famous throughout the Solar System.\n\nFirst the engines were installed, then the two groups of five massive\npower plants and the single smaller engine as an auxiliary supply plant\nfor the light, heat, air.\n\nThe accumulators of the _Comet_ were drained in a single tremendous\nsurge and the auxiliary generator started. It in turn awoke to life the\nother power plants, to leave them sleeping, idling, but ready for\ninstant use to develop power such as man never before had dreamed of\nholding and molding to his will.\n\nThen, with the gigantic tools these engines supplied ... tools of pure\nforce and strange space fields ... the work was rapidly completed. The\npower boards were set in place, welded in position by a sudden furious\nblast of white hot metal and as equally sudden freezing, to be followed\nby careful heating and recooling till the beryl-steel reached its\nmaximum strength. Over the hull swarmed spacesuited men, using that\nstrange new power, heat-treating the stubborn metal in a manner never\nbefore possible.\n\nThe generators were charging the atoms of the ship's beryl-steel hide\nwith the same hazy force that had trapped and held the gangster ship in\na mighty vise. Thus charged, no material thing could penetrate them. The\ngreatest meteor would be crushed to drifting dust without so much as\nscarring that wall of mighty force ... meteors traveling with a speed\nand penetrative power that no gun-hurled projectile could ever hope to\nattain.\n\nRiding under her own power, driven by the concentration of gravitational\nlines, impregnable to all known forces, containing within her hull the\nsecrets of many strange devices, the _Invincible_ wheeled in space.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRussell Page lounged in a chair before the control manual of the\ntele-transport machine. He puffed placidly at his pipe and looked out\nthrough the great sweep of the vision panel. Out there was the black of\nspace and the glint of stars, the soft glow of distant Jupiter.\n\nGreg Manning was hunched over the navigation controls, sharp eyes\nwatching the panorama of space.\n\nRuss looked at him and grinned. On Greg's face there was a smile, but\nabout his eyes were lines of alert watchfulness and thought. Greg\nManning was in his proper role at the controls of a ship such as the\n_Invincible_, a man who never stepped backward from danger, whose spirit\nhungered for the vast stretches of void that lay between the worlds.\n\nRuss leaned back, blowing smoke toward the high-arched control room\nceiling.\n\nThey had burned their bridges behind them. The laboratory back in the\nmountains was destroyed. Locked against any possible attack by a sphere\nof force until the tele-transport had lifted from it certain items of\nequipment, it had been melted into a mass of molten metal that formed a\npool upon the mountain top, that ran in gushing, fiery ribbons down the\nmountain side, flowing in gleaming curtains over precipices. It would\nhave been easier to have merely disintegrated in one bursting flash of\nenergy, but that would have torn apart the entire mountain range,\noverwhelmed and toppled cities hundreds of miles away, dealt Earth a\nstaggering blow.\n\nA skeleton crew had taken the _Comet_ back to Earth and landed it on\nGreg's estate. Once again the tele-transport had reached out, wrapped\nits fingers around the men who stepped from the little ship. In less\nthan the flash of a strobe light, they had been snatched back to the\n_Invincible_, through a million miles of space, through the very walls\nof the ship itself. One second they had been on Earth, the next second\nthey were in the control room of the _Invincible_, grinning, saluting\nGreg Manning, trotting back to their quarters in the engine rooms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRuss stared out at space, puffed at his pipe, considering.\n\nA thousand years ago men had held what they called tournaments. Armored\nknights rode out into the jousting grounds and broke their lances to\nprove which was the better man. Today there was to be another\ntournament. This ship was to be their charger, and the gauntlet had been\nflung to Spencer Chambers and Interplanetary Power. And all of space was\nto be the jousting grounds.\n\nThis was war. War without trappings, without fanfare, but bitter war\nupon which depended the future of the Solar System. A war to break the\ngrip of steel that Interplanetary accumulators had gained upon the\nplanets, to shatter the grim dream of empire held by one man, a war for\nthe right to give to the people of the worlds a source of power that\nwould forever unshackle them.\n\nBack in those days, a thousand years ago, men had built a system of\ngovernment that historians called the feudal system. By this system\ncertain men were called lords or barons and other titles. They held the\npower of life and death over the men \"under\" them.\n\nThis was what Spencer Chambers was trying to do with the Solar\nSystem ... what he would do if someone did not stop him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRuss bit viciously on his pipe-stem.\n\nThe Earth, the Solar System, never could revert to that ancient way of\ngovernment. The proud people spawned on the Earth, swarming outward to\nthe other planets, must never have to bow their heads as minions to an\noverlord.\n\nThe thrum of power was beating in his brain, the droning, humming power\nfrom the engine rooms that would blast, once and forever, the last\nthreat of dictatorship upon any world. The power that would free a\npeople, that would help them on and up and outward to the great destiny\nthat was theirs.\n\nAnd this had come because, wondering, groping, curiously, he had sought\nto heat a slender thread of imperm wire within Force Field 348, because\nanother man had listened and had made available his fortune to continue\nthe experiments. Blind luck and human curiosity ... perhaps even the\nmadness of a human dream ... and from those things had come this great\nship, this mighty power, these many bulking pieces of equipment that\nwould perform wonders never guessed at less than a year ago.\n\nGreg Manning swiveled his chair. \"Well, Russ, we're ready to begin.\nLet's get Wrail first.\"\n\nRuss nodded silently, his mind still half full of fleeting thought.\nAbsent-mindedly he knocked out his pipe and pocketed it, swung around to\nthe manual of the televisor. His fingers reached out and tapped a\npattern.\n\nCallisto appeared within the screen, leaped upward at them. Then the\nsurface of the frozen little world seemed to rotate swiftly and a dome\nappeared.\n\nThe televisor dived through the dome, sped through the city, straight\nfor a penthouse apartment.\n\nBen Wrail sat slumped in a chair. A newspaper was crumpled at his feet.\nIn his lap lay a mangled dead cigar.\n\n\"Greg!\" yelled Russ. \"Greg, there's something wrong!\"\n\nGreg leaped forward, stared at the screen. Russ heard his smothered cry\nof rage.\n\nIn Wrail's forehead was a tiny, neatly drilled hole from which a single\ndrop of blood oozed.\n\n\"Murdered!\" exclaimed Russ.\n\n\"Yes, murdered,\" said Greg, and there was a sudden calmness in his\nvoice.\n\nRuss grasped the televisor control. Ranthoor's streets ran beneath them,\ncuriously silent and deserted. Here and there lay bodies. A few shop\nwindows were smashed. But the only living that stirred was a dog that\nslunk across the street and into the shadows of an alley.\n\nSwiftly the televisor swung along the streets. Straight into the screen\nclanked a marching detail of government police, herding before them a\nhalf dozen prisoners. The men had their hands bound behind their backs,\nbut they walked with heads held high.\n\n\"Revolution,\" gasped Russ.\n\n\"Not a revolution. A purge. Stutsman is clearing the city of all who\nmight be dangerous to him. This will be happening on every other planet\nwhere Chambers holds control.\"\n\nPerspiration ran down Russ's forehead and dripped into his eyes as he\nmanipulated the controls.\n\n\"Stutsman is striking first,\" said Greg, calmly ... far too calmly.\n\"He's consolidating his position, possibly on the pretense that plots\nhave been discovered.\"\n\nA few buildings were bombed. A line of bodies were crumpled at the foot\nof a steel wall, marking the spot where men had been lined up and mowed\ndown with one sweeping blast from a heater.\n\nRuss turned the television controls. \"Let's see about Venus and Mars.\"\n\nThe scenes in Ranthoor were duplicated in Sandebar on Mars, in New\nChicago, the capital of Venus. Everywhere Stutsman had struck ...\neverywhere the purge was wiping out in blood every person who might\nrevolt against the Chambers-dictated governments. Throughout the Solar\nSystem violence was on the march, iron-shod boots trampling the rights\nof free men to tighten the grip of Interplanetary.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the control room of the _Invincible_ the two men stared at one\nanother.\n\n\"There's one man we need,\" said Greg. \"One man, if he's still alive, and\nI think he is.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\" asked Russ.\n\n\"John Moore Mallory,\" said Greg.\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"I don't know. He was imprisoned in Ranthoor, but Stutsman transferred\nhim some place else. Possibly to one of the prison fleet.\"\n\n\"If we had the records of the Callisto prison,\" suggested Russ, \"we\ncould find out.\"\n\n\"If we had the records ...\"\n\n\"We'll get them!\" Russ said.\n\nHe swung back to the keyboard again.\n\nA moment later the administration offices of the prison were on the\nscreen.\n\nThe two men searched the vision plate.\n\n\"The records are most likely in that vault,\" said Russ. \"And the vault\nis locked.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about the lock,\" snapped Greg. \"Just bring the whole damn\nthing here--vault and records and all.\"\n\nRuss nodded grimly. His thumb tripped the tele-transport control and\nfrom the engine rooms came a drone of power. In Ranthoor Prison, great\nbands of force wrapped themselves around the vault, clutching it,\nenfolding it within a sphere of power. Back in the _Invincible_ the\nengines screamed and the vault was ripped out of the solid steel wall as\neasily as a man might rip a button from his shirt.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER FIFTEEN_\n\n\nJohn Moore Mallory sat on the single metal chair within his cell and\npressed his face against the tiny vision port. For hours he had sat\nthere, staring out into the blackness of space.\n\nThere was bitterness in John Moore Mallory's soul, a terrible and futile\nbitterness. So long as he had remained within the Ranthoor prison, there\nhad always been a chance of escape. But now, aboard the penal ship,\nthere was no hope. Nothing but the taunting reaches of space, the\nmocking pinpoints of the stars, the hooting laughter of the engines.\n\nSometimes he had thought he would go mad. The everlasting routine, the\nmeaningless march of hours. The work period, the sleep period ... the\nwork period, the sleep period ... endless monotony, an existence without\na purpose. Men buried alive in space.\n\n\"John Moore Mallory,\" said a voice.\n\nMallory heard, but he did not stir. An awful thought crossed his mind.\nNow he was hearing voices calling his name!\n\n\"John Mallory,\" said the voice again.\n\nMallory slowly turned about and as he turned he started from his chair.\n\nA man stood in the cell! A man he had never seen before, who had come\nsilently, for there had been no screech of opening door.\n\n\"You are John Moore Mallory, aren't you?\" asked the man.\n\n\"Yes, I am Mallory. Who are you?\"\n\n\"Gregory Manning.\"\n\n\"Gregory Manning,\" said Mallory wonderingly. \"I've heard of you. You're\nthe man who rescued the Pluto Expedition. But why are you here? How did\nyou get in?\"\n\n\"I came to take you away with me,\" said Greg. \"Back to Callisto. Back to\nany place you want to go.\"\n\nMallory flattened himself against the partition, his face white with\ndisbelief. \"But I'm in a prison ship. I'm not free to go and come as I\nplease.\"\n\nGreg chuckled. \"You are free to go and come as you please from now on,\"\nhe said. \"Even prison ships can't hold you.\"\n\n\"You're mad,\" whispered Mallory. \"Either you're mad or I am. You're a\ndream. I'll wake up and find you gone.\"\n\nManning stood in silence, looking at the man. Mallory bore the marks of\nprison on him. His eyes were haunted and his rugged face was pinched and\nthin.\n\n\"Listen closely, Mallory,\" said Greg softly. \"You aren't going mad and\nI'm not mad. You aren't seeing things. You aren't hearing things. You're\nactually talking to me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no change in the other's face.\n\n\"Mallory,\" Greg went on, \"I have what you've always needed--means of\ngenerating almost unlimited energy at almost no cost, the secret of the\nenergy of matter. A secret that will smash Interplanetary, that will\nfree the Solar System from Spencer Chambers. But I can't make that\nsecret available to the people until Chambers is crushed, until I'm sure\nthat he can't take it from me. And to do that I need your help.\"\n\nMallory's face lost its expression of bewilderment, suddenly lighted\nwith realization. But his voice was harsh and bitter.\n\n\"You came too late. I can't help you. Remember, I'm in a prison ship\nfrom which no one can escape. You have to do what you can ... you must\ndo what you can. But I can't be with you.\"\n\nManning strode forward. \"You don't get the idea at all. I said I'd get\nyou out of here and I'm going to. I could pick up this ship and put it\nwherever I wanted. But I don't want to. I just want you.\"\n\nMallory stared at him.\n\n\"Just don't be startled,\" said Greg. \"Something will happen soon. Get\nready for it.\"\n\nFeet drummed on the metal corridor outside.\n\n\"Hey, you, pipe down!\" yelled the voice of the guard. \"You know there's\nno talking allowed now. Go to sleep.\"\n\n\"That's the guard,\" Mallory whispered fiercely. \"They'll stop us.\"\n\nGreg grinned viciously. \"No, they won't.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe guard came into view through the grilled door.\n\n\"So it's you, Mallory ...\" he began, stopping in amazement. \"Hey, you!\"\nhe shouted at Greg. \"Who are you? How did you get in that cell?\"\n\nGreg flipped a hand in greeting. \"Pleasant evening, isn't it?\"\n\nThe guard grabbed for the door, but he did not reach the bars. Some\nforce stopped him six inches away. It could not be seen, could not be\nfelt, but his straining against it accomplished nothing.\n\n\"Mallory and I are leaving,\" Greg told the guard. \"We don't like it\nhere. Too stuffy.\"\n\nThe guard lifted a whistle and blew a blast. Feet pounded outside. A\nprisoner yelled from one of the cells. Another catcalled. Instantly the\nship was in an uproar. The convicts took up the yammering, shaking the\nbars on their doors.\n\n\"Let's get started,\" Greg said to Mallory. \"Hold tight.\"\n\nBlackness engulfed Mallory. He felt a peculiar twisting wrench. And then\nhe was standing in the control room of a ship and Gregory Manning and\nanother man were smiling at him. White light poured down from a cluster\nof globes. Somewhere in the ship engines purred with the hum of power.\nThe air was fresh and pure, making him realize how foul and stale the\nair of the prison ship had been.\n\nGreg held out his hand. \"Welcome to our ship.\"\n\nMallory gripped his hand, blinking in the light. \"Where am I?\"\n\n\"You are on the _Invincible_, five million miles off Callisto.\"\n\n\"But were you here all the time?\" asked Mallory. \"Were you in my cell\nback there or weren't you?\"\n\n\"I was really in your cell,\" Greg assured him. \"I could have just thrown\nmy image there, but I went there personally to get you. Russ Page, here,\nsent me out. When I gave him the signal, he brought both of us back.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you're with us,\" Russ said. \"Perhaps you'd like a cup of\ncoffee, something to eat.\"\n\nMallory stammered. \"Why, I really would.\" He laughed. \"Rations weren't\ntoo good in the prison ship.\"\n\nThey sat down while Russ rang the galley for coffee and sandwiches.\n\nCrisply, Greg informed Mallory of the situation.\n\n\"We want to start manufacturing these engines as soon as possible,\" he\nexplained, \"but I haven't even dared to patent them. Chambers would\nsimply buy out the officials if I tried it on Earth, delay the patent\nfor a few days and then send through papers copied from ours. You know\nwhat he'd do with it if he got the patent rights. He'd scrap it and the\nold accumulator business would go on as always. If I tried it on any\nother world, with any other government, he'd see that laws were passed\nto block us. He'd probably instruct the courts to rule against the\nmanufacture of the engines on the grounds that they were dangerous.\"\n\nMallory's face was grave. \"There's only one answer,\" he said. \"With the\nsituation on the worlds, with this purge you told me about, there's only\none thing to do. We have to act at once. Every minute we wait gives\nStutsman just that much longer to tighten his hold.\"\n\n\"And that answer?\" asked Russ.\n\n\"Revolution,\" said Mallory. \"Simultaneous revolution in the Jovian\nconfederacy, on Mars and Venus. Once free, the planets will stay free\nwith your material energy engines. Spencer Chambers and his idea of\nSolar System domination will be too late.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGreg's forehead was wrinkled in thought, his facial muscles tensed.\n\n\"First thing to do,\" he said, \"is to contact all the men we can find ...\nmen we can rely on to help us carry out our plans. We'll need more\ntelevisor machines, more teleport machines, some for use on Mars and\nVenus, others for the Jovian moons. We will have to bring the men here\nto learn to operate them. It'll take a few days. We'll get some men to\nwork on new machines right away.\"\n\nHe started to rise from his chair, but at that moment the coffee and\nsandwiches arrived.\n\nGreg grinned. \"We may as well eat first.\"\n\nMallory looked grateful and tried to keep from wolfing the food. The\nothers pretended not to notice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGrim hours followed, an unrelenting search over two planets and four\nmoons for men whom Mallory considered loyal to his cause--men willing to\nrisk their lives to throw off the yoke of Interplanetary.\n\nThey were hard to find. Many of them were dead, victims of the purge.\nThe others were in hiding and word of them was difficult to get.\n\nBut slowly, one by one, they were ferreted out, the plan explained to\nthem, and then, by means of the tele-transport, they were brought to the\n_Invincible_.\n\nHour after hour men worked, stripped to their waists, in the glaring\ninferno of terrible force fields, fashioning new television units. As\nfast as the sets were constructed, they were placed in operation.\n\nThe work went faster than could be expected, yet it was maddeningly\nslow.\n\nFor with the passing of each hour, Stutsman clamped tighter his iron\ngrip on the planets. Concentration camps were filled to overflowing.\nBuildings were bombed and burned. Murders and executions were becoming\ntoo common to be news.\n\nThen suddenly there was a new development.\n\n\"Greg, Craven has found something!\" Russ cried. \"I can't get him!\"\n\nSupervising the installation of a new televisor set, Greg spun around.\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Craven! I can't reach him. He's blocking me out!\"\n\nGreg helped, but the apparatus was unable to enter the Interplanetary\nbuilding in New York. Certain other portions of the city adjacent to the\nbuilding also were blanketed out. In all the Solar System, the\nInterplanetary building was the only place they could not enter, except\nthe Sun itself.\n\nCraven had developed a field from which their field shied off. The\ntelevisor seemed to roll off it like a drop of mercury. That definitely\nended all spying on Craven and Chambers.\n\nRuss mopped his brow, sucked at his dead pipe.\n\n\"Light penetrates it,\" he said. \"Matter penetrates it, electricity, all\nordinary forces. But this field won't. It's ... well, whatever Craven\nhas is similarly dissimilar. The same thing of opposite nature. It\nrepels our field, but doesn't affect anything else. That means he has\nanalyzed our fields. We have Wilson to thank for this.\"\n\nGreg nodded gravely. \"There's just one thing to be thankful for,\" he\ndeclared. \"He probably isn't any nearer our energy than he was before.\nBut now we can't watch him. And that field of his shows that he has\ntremendous power of some sort.\"\n\n\"We can't watch him, but we can follow him,\" corrected Russ. \"He can't\nshake us. None of them can. The mechanical shadow will take care of\nthat. I have one for Craven with a bit of 'bait' off his spectacles and\nhe'll keep those spectacles, never fear. He's blind as a bat without\nthem. And we can track Chambers with his ring.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" agreed Greg, \"but we've got to speed up. Craven is\ngetting under way now. If he does this, he can do something else.\nSomething that will really hurt us. The man's clever ... too damn\nclever.\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER SIXTEEN_\n\n\nA miracle came to pass in Ranthoor when a man for whom all hope had been\nabandoned suddenly appeared within the city's streets. But he appeared\nto be something not quite earthly, for he did not have the solidity of a\nman. He was pale, like a wraith from out of space, and one could see\nstraight through him, yet he still had all the old mannerisms and\ntricks.\n\nIn frightened, awe-stricken whispers the word was spread ... the spirit\nof John Moore Mallory had come back to the city once again. He bulked\nfour times the height of a normal man and there was that singular\nghostliness about him. From where he had come, or how, or why, no one\nseemed to know.\n\nBut when he reached the steps of the federation's administration\nbuilding and walked straight through a line of troopers that suddenly\nmassed to bar his way, and when he turned on those steps and spoke to\nthe people who had gathered, there was none to doubt that at last a sign\nhad come. The sign that now, if ever, was the time to avenge the purge.\nNow the time to take vengeance for the blood that flowed in gutters, for\nthe throaty chortling of the flame guns that had snuffed out lives\nagainst a broad steel wall.\n\nStanding on the steps, shadowy but plainly visible, John Moore Mallory\ntalked to the people in the square below, and his voice was the voice\nthey remembered. They saw him toss his black mane of hair, they saw his\nclenched fist raised in terrible anger, they heard the boom of the words\nhe spoke.\n\nLike a shrilling alarm the words spread through the city, reverberating\nfrom the dome, seeking out those who were in hiding. From every corner\nof the city, from its deepest cellars and its darkest alleys, poured out\na mass of humanity that surrounded the capitol and blackened the square\nand the converging streets with a mob that shrieked its hatred, bellowed\nits anger.\n\n\"Power!\" thundered the mighty shadow on the steps. \"Power to burn! Power\nto give away. Power to heat the dome, to work your mines, to drive your\nspaceships!\"\n\n\"Power!\" answered the voice of the crowd. \"Power!\" It sounded like a\nbattle cry.\n\n\"No more accumulators,\" roared the towering image. \"Never again need you\nrely on Spencer Chambers for your power. Callisto is yours. Ranthoor is\nyours.\"\n\nThe black crowd surged forward, reached the steps and started to climb,\nwild cheers in their throat, the madness of victory in their eyes. Up\nthe steps came men with nothing but bare hands, screaming women, jeering\nchildren.\n\nOfficers snapped orders at the troops that lined the steps, but the\ntroopers, staring into the awful, raging maw of that oncoming crowd,\ndropped their guns and fled, back into the capitol building, with the\nmob behind them, shrilling blood lust and long-awaited vengeance.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOut of the red and yellow wilderness of the deserts, a man came to\nSandebar on Mars. He had long been thought dead. The minions of the\ngovernment had announced that he was dead. But he had been in hiding for\nsix years.\n\nHis beard was long and gray, his eyes were curtained by hardship, his\nwhite hair hung about his shoulders and he was clothed in the tattered\nleather trappings of the spaceways.\n\nBut men remembered him.\n\nTom Brown had lead the last revolt against the Martian government, an\nill-starred revolt that ended almost before it started when the\ntroopers turned loose the heavy heaters and swept the streets with\nwashing waves of flame.\n\nWhen he climbed to the base of a statue in Techor Park to address the\ncrowd that gathered, the police shouted for him to come down and he\ndisregarded them. They climbed the statue to reach him and their hands\nwent through him.\n\nTom Brown stood before the people, in plain view, and spoke, but he\nwasn't there!\n\nOther things happened in Sandebar that day. A voice spoke out of thin\nair, a voice that told the people the reign of Interplanetary was over.\nIt told of a mighty new source of power. Power that would cost almost\nnothing. Power that would make the accumulators unnecessary ... would\nmake them out of date. A voice that said the people need no longer\nsubmit to the yoke of Spencer Chambers' government in order to obtain\nthe power they needed.\n\nThere was no one there ... no one visible at all. And yet that voice\nwent on and on. A great crowd gathered, listening, cheering. The police\ntried to break it up and failed. The troops were ordered out and the\npeople fought them until the voice told them to disband peaceably and go\nto their homes.\n\nThroughout Mars it was the same.\n\nIn a dozen places in Sandebar the voice spoke. It spoke in a dozen\nplaces, out of empty air, in Malacon and Alexon and Adebron.\n\nTom Brown, vanishing into the air after his speech was done, reappeared\na few minutes later in Adebron and there the police, warned of what had\nhappened in Sandebar, opened fire upon him when he stood on a park bench\nto address the people. But the flames passed through and did not touch\nhim. Tom Brown, his long white beard covering his chest, his mad eyes\nflashing, stood in the fiery blast that bellowed from the muzzles of the\nflame rifles and calmly talked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe chief of police at New Chicago, Venus, called the police\ncommissioner. \"There's a guy out here in the park, just across the\nstreet. He's preaching treason. He's telling the people to overthrow the\ngovernment.\"\n\nIn the ground glass the police commissioner's face grew purple.\n\n\"Arrest him,\" he ordered the chief. \"Clap him in the jug. Do you have to\ncall me up every time one of those fiery-eyed boys climbs a soap box?\nRun him in.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" said the chief.\n\nThe police commissioner seemed ready to explode. \"You can't? Why the\nhell not?\"\n\n\"Well, you know that hill in the center of the park? Memorial Hill?\"\n\n\"What has a hill got to do with it?\" the commissioner roared.\n\n\"He's sitting on top of that hill. He's a thousand feet tall. His head\nis way up in the sky and his voice is like thunder. How can you arrest\nanybody like that?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEverywhere in the System, revolt was flaming. New marching songs rolled\nout between the worlds, wild marching songs that had the note of anger\nin them. Weapons were brought out of hiding and polished. New standards\nwere raised in an ever-rising tide against oppression.\n\nFreedom was on the march again. The right of a man to rule himself the\nway he chose to rule. A new declaration of independence. A Solar Magna\nCarta.\n\nThere were new leaders, led by the old leaders. Led by spirits that\nmarched across the sky. Led by voices that spoke out of the air. Led by\nsigns and symbols and a new-born courage and a great and a deep\nconviction that right in the end would triumph.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpencer Chambers glared at Ludwig Stutsman. \"This is one time you went\ntoo far.\"\n\n\"If you'd given me a free hand before, this wouldn't have been\nnecessary,\" Stutsman said. \"But you were soft. You made me go easy when\nI should have ground them down. You left the way open for all sorts of\nplots and schemes and leaders to develop.\"\n\nThe two men faced one another, one the smooth, tawny lion, the other the\nsnarling wolf.\n\n\"You've built up hatred, Stutsman,\" Chambers said. \"You are the most\nhated man in the Solar System. And because of you, they hate me. That\nwasn't my idea. I needed you because I needed an iron fist, but I needed\nit to use judiciously. And you have been ruthless. You've used force\nwhen conciliation was necessary.\"\n\nStutsman sneered openly. \"Still that old dream of a benevolent\ndictatorship. Still figuring yourself a little bronze god to be set up\nin every household. A dictatorship can't be run that way. You have to\nlet them know you're boss.\"\n\nChambers was calm again. \"Argument won't do us any good now. The damage\nis done. Revolt is flaming through all the worlds. We have to do\nsomething.\"\n\nHe looked at Craven, who was slouched in a chair beside the desk across\nwhich he and Stutsman faced each other.\n\n\"Can you help us, doctor?\" he asked.\n\nCraven shrugged. \"Perhaps,\" he said acidly. \"If I could only be left to\nmy work undisturbed, instead of being dragged into these stupid\nconferences, I might be able to do something.\"\n\n\"You already have, haven't you?\" asked Chambers.\n\n\"Very little. I've been able to blank out the televisor that Manning and\nPage are using, but that is all.\"\n\n\"Do you have any idea where Manning and Page are?\"\n\n\"How could I know?\" Craven asked. \"Somewhere in space.\"\n\n\"They're at the bottom of this,\" snarled Stutsman. \"Their damned tricks\nand propaganda.\"\n\n\"We know they're at the bottom of it,\" said Craven. \"That's no news to\nus. If it weren't for them, we wouldn't have this trouble now, despite\nyour bungling. But that doesn't help us any. With this new discovery of\nmine I have shielded this building from their observation. They can't\nspy on us any more. But that's as far as I've got.\"\n\n\"They televised the secret meeting of the emergency council when it met\nin Satellite City on Ganymede the other day,\" said Chambers. \"The whole\nJovian confederacy watched and listened to that meeting, heard our\nsecret war plans, for fully ten minutes before the trick was discovered.\nCouldn't we use your shield to prevent such a situation again?\"\n\n\"Better still,\" suggested Stutsman, \"let's shield the whole satellite.\nWithout Manning's ghostly leaders, this revolt would collapse of its own\nweight.\"\n\nCraven shook his head. \"It takes fifty tons of accumulators to build up\nthat field, and a ton of fuel a day to maintain it. Just for this\nbuilding alone. It would be impossible to shield a whole planet, an\nentire moon.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Any progress on your collector field?\" asked Chambers.\n\n\"Some,\" Craven admitted. \"I'll know in a day or two.\"\n\n\"That would give us something with which to fight Manning and Page,\nwouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Craven. \"It would be something to fight them with. If I\ncan develop that collector field, we would be able to utilize every\nradiation in space, from the heat wave down through the cosmics. Within\nthe Solar System, our power would be absolutely limitless. Your\naccumulators depend for their power storage upon just one radiation ...\nheat. But with this idea I have you'd use all types of radiations.\"\n\n\"You say you could even put the cosmics to work?\" asked Chambers.\n\nCraven nodded. \"If I can do anything at all with the field, I can.\"\n\n\"How?\" demanded Stutsman.\n\n\"By breaking them up, you fool. Smash the short, high-powered waves into\na lot of longer, lower-powered waves.\" Craven swung back to face\nChambers. \"But don't count on it,\" he warned. \"I haven't done it yet.\"\n\n\"You have to do it,\" Chambers insisted.\n\nCraven rose from his chair, his blue eyes blazing angrily behind the\nheavy lenses. \"How often must I tell you that you cannot hurry\nscientific investigation? You have to try and try ... follow one tiny\nclue to another tiny clue. You have to be patient. You have to hope. But\nyou cannot force the work.\"\n\nHe strode from the room, slammed the door behind him.\n\nChambers turned slowly in his chair to face Stutsman. His gray eyes\nbored into the wolfish face.\n\n\"And now,\" he suggested, \"suppose you tell me just why you did it.\"\n\nStutsman's lips curled. \"I suppose you would rather I had allowed those\ntroublemakers to go ahead, consolidate their plans. There was only one\nthing to do--root them out, liquidate them. I did it.\"\n\n\"You chose a poor time,\" said Chambers softly. \"You would have to do\nsomething like this, just at the time when Manning is lurking around the\nSolar System somewhere, carrying enough power to wipe us off the face of\nthe Earth if he wanted to.\"\n\n\"That's why I did it,\" protested Stutsman. \"I knew Manning was around. I\nwas afraid he'd start something, so I beat him to it. I thought it would\nthrow a scare into the people, make them afraid to follow Manning when\nhe acted.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You have a low opinion of the human race, don't you?\" Chambers said.\n\"You think you can beat them into a mire of helplessness and fear.\"\n\nChambers rose from his chair, pounded his desk for emphasis.\n\n\"But you can't do it, Stutsman. Men have tried it before you, from the\nvery dawn of history. You can destroy their homes and kill their\nchildren. You can burn them at the stake or in the electric chair, hang\nthem or space-walk them or herd them into gas chambers. You can drive\nthem like cattle into concentration camps, you can keep the torture\nracks bloody, but you can't break them.\n\n\"Because the people always survive. Their courage is greater than the\ncourage of any one man or group of men. They always reach the man who\nhas oppressed them, they always tear him down from the place he sits,\nand they do not deal gently with him when they do. In the end the\npeople always win.\"\n\nChambers reached across the desk and caught Stutsman by the slack of the\nshirt. A twist of his hand tightened the fabric around Stutsman's neck.\nThe financier thrust his face close to the wolfish scowl. \"That is what\nis going to happen to you and me. We'll go down in history as just a\ncouple of damn fools who tried to rule and couldn't make the grade.\nThanks to you and your damned stupidity. You and your blood purges!\"\n\nPatches of anger burned on Stutsman's cheeks. His eyes glittered and his\nlips were white. But his whisper was bitter mockery. \"Maybe we should\nhave coddled and humored them. Made them just so awful happy that big\nbad old Interplanetary had them. So they could have set up little bronze\nimages of you in their homes. So you could have been sort of a solar\ngod!\"\n\n\"I still think it would have been the better way.\" Chambers flung\nStutsman from him with a straight-armed push. The man reeled and\nstaggered across the carpeted floor. \"Get out of my sight!\"\n\nStutsman straightened his shirt, turned and left.\n\nChambers slumped into his chair, his hands grasping the arms on either\nside of his great body, his eyes staring out through the window from\nwhich flooded the last rays of the afternoon Sun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDrums pounded in his brain ... the drums of rebellion out in space, of\nrebellion on those other worlds ... drums that were drowning out and\nshattering forever the dream that he had woven. He had wanted economic\ndictatorship ... not the cold, passionless, terrible dictatorship that\nStutsman typified ... but one that would bring peace and prosperity and\nhappiness to the Solar System.\n\nHe closed his eyes and thought. Snatches of ambition, snatches of\nhopes ... but it was useless to think, for the drums and the imagined\nshouting drowned out his thoughts.\n\nMankind didn't give a damn for good business administration, nor a hoot\nfor prosperity or peace or happiness. Liberty and the right to rule, the\nright to go risk one's neck ... to climb a mountain or cross a desert or\nexplore a swamp, the right to aim one's sights at distant stars, to\nfling a taunting challenge into the teeth of space, to probe with clumsy\nfingers and force nature to lay bare her secrets ... that was what\nmankind wanted. That was what those men out on Mars and Venus and in\nthe Jovian worlds were fighting for. Not against Spencer Chambers or\nLudwig Stutsman or Interplanetary Power, but for the thing that drove\nman on and made of him a flame that others might follow. Fighting for a\nheritage that was first expressed when the first man growled at the\nentrance to his cave and dared the world to take it from him.\n\nSpencer Chambers closed his eyes and rocked back and forth in the\ntilting office chair.\n\nIt had been a good fight, a hard fight. He had had a lot of fun out of\nit. But he was licked, after all these years. He had held the biggest\ndream of any man who ever lived. Alexander and Napoleon, Hitler, Stalin\nand those other fellows had been pikers alongside of Spencer Chambers.\nThey had only aimed at Earthly conquest while he had reached out to grab\nat all the worlds. But by heaven, he'd almost made it!\n\nA door grated open.\n\n\"Chambers!\" said a voice.\n\nHis feet hit the floor with a thud and he sat stiff and staring at the\nfigure in the door.\n\nIt was Craven and the man was excited. His glasses were slid far down on\nhis nose, his hair was standing on end, his tie was all awry.\n\n\"I have it!\" Craven whooped. \"I have it at last!\"\n\nHope clutched at Chambers, but he was almost afraid to speak.\n\n\"Have what?\" he whispered tensely.\n\n\"The collector field! It was under my nose all the time, but I didn't\nsee it!\"\n\nChambers was out of his chair and striding across the room. A tumult\nbuzzed within his skull.\n\nLicked? Hell, he hadn't even started! He'd win yet. He'd teach the\npeople to revolt! He'd run Manning and Page out to the end of space and\npush them through!\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER SEVENTEEN_\n\n\nIt was a weird revolution. There were few battles, little blood shed.\nThere seemed to be no secret plots. There were no skulking leaders, no\npasswords, nothing that in former years had marked rebellion against\ntyranny.\n\nIt was a revolution carried out with utter boldness. Secret police were\nhelpless, for it was not a secret revolution. The regular police and the\ntroopers were helpless because the men they wanted to arrest were\nshadows that flitter here and there ... large and substantial shadows,\nbut impossible to seize and imprison.\n\nEvery scheme that was hatched within the government circles was known\nalmost at once to the ghostly leaders who stalked the land. Police\ndetachments, armed with warrants for the arrests of men who had\nparticipated in some action which would stamp them as active rebels,\nfound the suspects absent when they broke down the doors. Someone had\nwarned them. Troops, hurried to points where riots had broken out,\narrived to find peaceful scenes, but with evidence of recent battle. The\nrioters had been warned, had made their getaway.\n\nWhen the rebels struck it was always at the most opportune time, when\nthe government was off balance or off guard.\n\nIn the first day of the revolt, Ranthoor fell when the maddened\npopulace, urged on by the words of a shadowy John Moore Mallory, charged\nthe federation buildings. The government fled, leaving all records\nbehind, to Satellite City on Ganymede.\n\nIn the first week three Martian cities fell, but Sandebar, the capital,\nstill held out. On Venus, Radium City was taken by the rebels within\ntwenty-four hours after the first call to revolt had rung across the\nworlds, but New Chicago, the seat of government, still was in the\ngovernment's hands, facing a siege.\n\nGovernment propagandists spread the word that the material energy\nengines were not safe. Reports were broadcast that on at least two\noccasions the engines had blown up, killing the men who operated them.\n\nBut this propaganda failed to gain credence, for in the cities that were\nin the rebel hands, technicians were at work manufacturing and setting\nup the material engines. Demonstrations were given. The people saw them,\nsaw what enormous power they developed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRuss Page stared incredulously at the television screen. It seemed to be\nshifting back and forth. One second it held the distorted view of\nSatellite City on Ganymede, and the next second the view of jumbled, icy\ndesert somewhere outside the city.\n\n\"Look here, Greg,\" he said. \"Something's wrong.\"\n\nGreg Manning turned away from the calculator where he had been working\nand stared at the screen.\n\n\"How long has it been acting that way?\" he asked.\n\n\"Just started,\" said Russ.\n\nGreg straightened and glanced down the row of television machines. Some\nof them were dead, their switches closed, but on the screens of many of\nthe others was the same effect as on this machine. Their operators were\nworking frustratedly at the controls, trying to focus the image, bring\nit into sharp relief.\n\n\"Can't seem to get a thing, sir,\" said one of the men. \"I was working on\nthe fueling station out on Io, and the screen just went haywire.\"\n\n\"Mine seems to be all right,\" said another man. \"I've had it on Sandebar\nfor the last couple of hours and there's nothing wrong.\"\n\nA swift check revealed one fact. The machines, when trained on the\nJovian worlds, refused to function. Anywhere else in space, however,\nthey worked perfectly.\n\nRuss stoked and lit his pipe, snapped off his machine and swung around\nin the operator's chair.\n\n\"Somebody's playing hell with us out around Jupiter,\" he stated calmly.\n\n\"I've been expecting something like this,\" said Greg. \"I have been\nafraid of this ever since Craven blanketed us out of the Interplanetary\nbuilding.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"He really must have something this time,\" Russ agreed. \"He's blanketing\nout the entire Jovian system. There's a space field of low intensity\nsurrounding all of Jupiter, enclosing all the moons. He keeps shifting\nthe intensity so that, even though we can force our way through his\nfield, the irregular variations make it impossible to line up anything.\nIt works, in principle, just as effectively as if we couldn't get\nthrough at all.\"\n\nGreg whistled soundlessly through suddenly bared teeth.\n\n\"That takes power,\" he said, \"and I'm afraid Craven has it. Power to\nburn.\"\n\n\"The collector field?\" asked Russ.\n\nGreg nodded. \"A field that sucks in radiant energy. Free energy that he\njust reaches out and grabs. And it doesn't depend on the Sun alone. It\nprobably makes use of every type of radiation in all of space.\"\n\nRuss slumped in his chair, smoking, his forehead wrinkled in thought.\n\n\"If that's what he's got,\" he finally declared, \"he's going to be hard\nto crack. He can suck in any radiant vibration form, any space\nvibration. He can shift them around, break them down and build them up.\nHe can discharge them, direct them. He's got a vibration plant that's\nthe handiest little war machine that ever existed.\"\n\nGreg suddenly wheeled and walked to a wall cabinet. From it he took a\nbox and, opening it, lifted out a tiny mechanism.\n\nHe chuckled deep in his throat. \"The mechanical shadow. The little\nmachine that always tells us where Craven is--as long as he's wearing\nhis glasses.\"\n\n\"He always wears them,\" said Russ crisply. \"He's blind as a bat without\nthem.\"\n\nGreg set the machine down on the table. \"When we find Craven, we'll find\nthe contraption that's blanketing Jupiter and its moons.\"\n\nDials spun and needles quivered. Rapidly Russ jotted down the readings\non a sheet of paper. At the calculator, he tapped keys, depressed the\nactivator. The machine hummed and snarled and chuckled.\n\nRuss glanced at the result imprinted on the paper roll.\n\n\"Craven is out near Jupiter,\" he announced. \"About 75,000 miles distant\nfrom its surface, in a plane normal to the Sun's rays.\"\n\n\"A spaceship,\" suggested Greg.\n\nRuss nodded. \"That's the only answer.\"\n\nThe two men looked at one another.\n\n\"That's something we can get hold of,\" said Greg.\n\nHe walked to the ship controls and lowered himself into the pilot's\nchair. A hand came out and hauled back a lever.\n\nThe _Invincible_ moved.\n\nFrom the engine rooms came the whine of the gigantic power plant as it\nbuilt up and maintained the gravity concentration center suddenly\ncreated in front of the ship.\n\nRuss, standing beside Greg at the control panel, looked out into space\nand marveled. They were flashing through space, their speed building up\nat a breath-taking rate, yet they had no real propulsion power. The\ndiscovery of the gravity concentrator had outdated such a method of\ndriving a spaceship. Instead, they were falling, hurtling downward into\nthe yawning maw of an artificial gravity field. And such a method made\nfor speed, terrible speed.\n\nJupiter seemed to leap at them. It became a great crimson and yellow\nball that filled almost half the vision plate.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Invincible's_ speed was slacking off, slower and slower, until it\nbarely crawled in comparison to its former speed.\n\nSlowly they circled Jupiter's great girth, staring out of the vision\nport for a sight of Craven's ship. They were nearing the position the\nlittle mechanical shadow had indicated.\n\n\"There it is,\" said Russ suddenly, almost breathlessly.\n\nFar out in space, tiny, almost like a dust mote against the great bulk\nof the monster planet, rode a tiny light. Slowly the _Invincible_\ncrawled inward. The mote of light became a gleaming silver ship, a\nmighty ship--one that was fully as large as the _Invincible_!\n\n\"That's it all right,\" said Greg. \"They're lying behind a log out here\nraising hell with our television apparatus. Maybe we better tickle them\na little bit and see what they have.\"\n\nRising from the control board, he went to another control panel. Russ\nremained standing in front of the vision plate, staring down at the\nship out in space.\n\nBehind him came a shrill howl from the power plant. The _Invincible_\nstaggered slightly. A beam of deep indigo lashed across space, a finger\nsuddenly jabbing at the other ship.\n\nSpace was suddenly colored, for thousands of miles, as the beam struck\nCraven's ship and seemed to explode in a blast of dazzling indigo light.\nThe ship reeled under the impact of the blow, reeled and weaved in space\nas the beam struck it and delivered to it the mighty power of the\nscreaming engines back in the engine room.\n\n\"What happened?\" Greg screamed above the roar.\n\nRuss shrugged his shoulders. \"You jarred him a little. Pushed him\nthrough space for several hundred miles. Made him know something had hit\nhim, but it didn't seem to do any damage.\"\n\n\"That was pure cosmic I gave him! Five billion horsepower--and it just\nstaggered him!\"\n\n\"He's got a space lens that absorbs the energy,\" said Russ. \"The lens\nconcentrates it and pours it into a receiving chamber, probably a huge\nphoto-cell. Nobody yet has burned out one of those things on a closed\ncircuit.\"\n\nGreg wrinkled his brow, perplexed. \"What he must have is a special field\nof some sort that lowers the wave-length and the intensity. He's getting\nnatural cosmics all the time and taking care of them.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't be much of a trick,\" Russ pointed out. \"But when he takes\ncare of cosmics backed by five billion horsepower ... that's something\nelse!\"\n\nGreg grinned wickedly. \"I'm going to hand him a long heat radiation. If\nhis field shortens that any, he'll have radio beam and that will blow\nphoto-cells all to hell.\"\n\nHe stabbed viciously at the keys on the board and once again the shrill\nhowl of the engines came from the rear of the ship. A lance of red\nsplashed out across space and touched the other ship. Again space was\nlit, this time with a crimson glow.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRuss shook his head. \"Nothing doing.\"\n\nGreg sat down and looked at Russ. \"Funny thing about this. They just sat\nthere and let us throw two charges at them, took everything we gave them\nand never tried to hand it back.\"\n\n\"Maybe they haven't anything to hand us,\" Russ suggested hopefully.\n\n\"They must have. Craven wouldn't take to space with just a purely\ndefensive weapon. He knew we'd find him and he'd have a fight on his\nhands.\"\n\nRuss found his pipe was dead. Snapping his lighter, he applied flame to\nthe blackened tobacco. Walking slowly to the wall cabinet, he lifted two\nother boxes out, set them on the table and took from them two other\nmechanical shadows. He turned them on and leaned close, watching the\nspinning dials, the quivering needles.\n\n\"Greg,\" he whispered, \"Chambers and Stutsman are there in that ship with\nCraven! Look, their shadows register identical with the one that spotted\nCraven.\"\n\n\"I suspected as much,\" Greg replied. \"We got the whole pack cornered out\nhere. If we can just get rid of them, the whole war would be won in one\nstroke.\"\n\nRuss lifted a stricken face from the row of tiny mechanisms. \"This is\nour big chance. We may never get it again. The next hour could decide\nwho is going to win.\"\n\nGreg rose from the chair and stood before the control board. Grimly he\npunched a series of keys. The engines howled again. Greg twisted a dial\nand the howl rose into a shrill scream.\n\nFrom the _Invincible_ another beam lashed out ... another and another.\nSpace was speared with beam after beam hurtling from the great ship.\n\nSwiftly the beams went through the range of radiation, through radio and\nshort radio, infra-red, visible light, ultra-violet, X-ray, the gammas\nand the cosmics--a terrific flood of billions of horsepower.\n\nCraven's ship buckled and careened under the lashing impacts of the\nbombardment, but it seemed unhurt!\n\nGreg's face was bleaker than usual as he turned from the board to look\nat Russ.\n\n\"We've used everything we have,\" he said, \"and he's stopped them all. We\ncan't touch him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRuss shivered. The control room suddenly seemed chilly with a\nfrightening kind of cold.\n\n\"He's carrying photo-cells and several thousand tons of accumulator\nstacks. Not much power left in them. He could pour a billion horsepower\ninto them for hours and still have room for more.\"\n\nGreg nodded wearily. \"All we've been doing is feeding him.\"\n\nThe engines were humming quietly now, singing the low song of power held\nin leash.\n\nBut then they screamed like a buzz saw biting into an iron-hard stick of\nwhite oak. Screamed in a single, frightful agony as they threw into the\nprotecting wall that enclosed the _Invincible_ all the power they could\ndevelop.\n\nThe air of the ship was instantaneously charged with a hazy, bluish\nglow, and the sharp, stinging odor of ozone filled the ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOutside, an enormous burst of blue-white flame splashed and spattered\naround the _Invincible_. Living lightning played in solid, snapping\nsheets around the vision port and ran in trickling blazing fire across\nthe plates.\n\nRuss cried out and backed away, holding his arm before his eyes. It was\nas if he had looked into a nova of energy exploding before his eyes.\n\nIn the instant the scream died and the splash of terrific fire had\nvanished. Only a rapidly dying glow remained.\n\n\"What was it?\" asked Russ dazedly. \"What happened? Ten engines every one\nof them capable of over five billion horsepower and every one of them\nscreaming!\"\n\n\"Craven,\" said Greg grimly. \"He let us have everything he had. He simply\ndrained his accumulator stacks and threw it all into our face. But he's\ndone now. That was his only shot. He'll have to build up power now and\nthat will take a while. But we couldn't have taken much more.\"\n\n\"Stalemate,\" said Russ. \"We can't hurt him, he can't hurt us.\"\n\n\"Not by a damn sight,\" declared Greg. \"I still have a trick or two in\nmind.\"\n\nHe tried them. From the _Invincible_ a fifty-billion-horsepower bolt of\nliving light and fire sprang out as all ten engines thundered with an\ninsane voice that racked the ship.\n\nFireworks exploded in space when the bolt struck Craven's ship. Screen\nafter screen exploded in glittering, flaming sparks, but the ship rode\nthe lashing charge, finally halted the thrust of power. The beam glowed\nfaintly, died out.\n\nPerspiration streamed down Greg's face as he bent over a calculator and\nconstructed the formula for a magnetic field. He sent out a field of\nsuch unimaginable intensity that it would have drawn any beryl-steel\nwithin a mile of it into a hard, compact mass. Even the _Invincible_, a\nhundred miles away, lurched under the strain. But Craven's ship, after\nthe first wild jerk, did not move. A curious soft glow spread out from\nthe ship, veered sharply and disappeared in the magnetic field.\n\nGreg swore softly. \"He's cutting it down as fast as I try to build it\nup,\" he explained, \"and I can't move it any nearer.\"\n\nFrom Craven's ship lashed out another thunderbolt and once again the\nengines screamed in terrible unison as they poured power into the ship's\ntriple screen. The first screen stopped all material things. The second\nstopped radiations by refracting them into the fourth dimension. The\nthird shield was akin to the anti-entropy field, which stopped all\nmatter ... and yet the ten engines bellowed like things insane as Craven\nstruck with flaming bolts, utilizing the power he had absorbed from the\nfifty billion horsepower Greg had thrown at him.\n\nThere was anger in Greg Manning's face ... a terrible anger. His fists\nknotted and he shook them at the gleaming ship that lay far down near\nJupiter.\n\n\"I've got one trick left,\" he shouted, almost as if he expected Craven\nto hear. \"Just one trick. Damn you, see if you can stop this one!\"\n\nHe set up the pattern on the board and punched the activating lever. The\nten engines thrummed with power. Then the howling died away.\n\nFour times they screamed and four times they ebbed into a gentle hum.\n\n\"Get on the navigation controls!\" yelled Greg. \"Be ready to give the\nship all you've got.\"\n\nGreg leaped for the control chair, grasped the acceleration lever.\n\n\"Now,\" growled Greg, \"look out, Craven, we're coming at you!\"\n\nGreg, teeth gritted, slammed the acceleration over.\n\nSuddenly all space wrenched horribly with a nauseating, terrible thud\nthat seemed to strain at the very anchors of the Universe.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER EIGHTEEN_\n\n\nJupiter and the Jovian worlds leaped suddenly backward, turned swiftly\ngreen, then blue, and faded in an instant into violet. The Sun spun\ncrazily through space, retreating, dimming to a tiny ruby-tinted star.\n\nThe giant generators in the _Invincible_ hummed louder now, continually\nlouder, a steel-throated roar that trembled through every plate, through\nevery girder, through every bit of metal in the ship.\n\nThe ship itself was plunging spaceward, streaking like a runaway star\nfor the depths of space beyond the Solar System. And behind it, caught\ntight, gripped and held, Craven's ship trailed at the end of a tractor\nfield that bound it to the space-rocketing _Invincible_.\n\nThe acceleration compensator, functioning perfectly, had taken up the\nslack as the ship had plunged from a standing start into a speed that\nneared the pace of light. But it had never been built to stand such\nsudden, intense acceleration, and for an instant Russ and Greg seemed\nto be crushed by a mighty weight that struck at them. The sensation\nswiftly lifted as the compensator took up the load.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGreg shook his head, flinging the trickling perspiration from his eyes.\n\n\"I hope their compensator worked as well as ours,\" he said.\n\n\"If it didn't,\" declared Russ, \"we're towing a shipload of dead men.\"\n\nRuss glanced at the speed dial. They were almost touching the speed of\nlight. \"He hasn't cut down our speed yet.\"\n\n\"We threw him off his balance. His drive depends largely on the mass of\nsome planet as a body to take up the reaction of his ship. Jupiter is\nthe ideal body for that ... but he's leaving Jupiter behind. He has to\ndo something soon or it'll be too late.\"\n\n\"He's getting less energy, too,\" said Russ. \"We're retreating from his\nmain sources of energy, the Sun and Jupiter. Almost the speed of light\nand that would cut down his energy intake terrifically. He has to use\nwhat he's got in his accumulators, and after that last blast at us, they\nmust be nearly drained.\"\n\nAs Russ watched, the speed needle fell off slightly. Russ held his\nbreath. It edged back slowly, creeping. The speed was being cut down.\n\n\"Craven is using whatever power he has,\" he said. \"They're alive back\nthere, all right. He's trying to catch hold of Jupiter and make its\ngravity work for him.\"\n\nThe _Invincible_ felt the strain of the other ship now. Felt it as\nCraven poured power into his drive, fighting to get free of the\ninvisible hawser that had trapped him, fighting against being dragged\ninto outer space at the tail-end of a mighty craft heading spaceward\nwith frightening speed.\n\nGirders groaned in the _Invincible_, the engines moaned and throbbed.\nThe speed needle fell back, creeping down the dial, slowly, unwillingly,\nresisting any drop in speed. But Craven was cutting it down. And as he\ncut it, he was able to absorb more energy with his collector lens. But\nhe was fighting two things ... momentum and the steadily decreasing\ngravitational pull of Jupiter and the Sun. The Sun's pull was dwindling\nslowly, Jupiter's rapidly.\n\nThe needle still crept downward.\n\n\"What's his point of equality to us?\" demanded Greg. \"Will we make it?\"\n\nRuss shook his head. \"Won't know for hours. He'll be able to slow us\nup ... maybe he'll even stop us or be able to jerk free, although I\ndoubt that. But every minute takes him farther away from his main source\nof power, the Solar System's radiation. He could collect power anywhere\nin space, you know, but the best place to collect it is near large\nradiant bodies.\"\n\nRuss continued to crouch over the dial, begrudging every backward\nflicker of the needle.\n\nThis was the last play, the final hand. If they could drag Craven and\nhis ship away from the Solar System, maroon him deep in space, far\nremoved from any source of radiation, they would win, for they could go\nback and finish the work of smashing Interplanetary.\n\nBut if Craven won--if he could halt their mad dash for space, if he\ncould shake free--they'd never have another chance. He would be studying\nthat field they had wrapped around him, be ready for it next time, might\neven develop one like it and use it on the _Invincible_. If Craven could\nwin his way back to the Sun, he would be stronger than they were, could\ntop them in power, shatter all their plans, and once again the worlds\nwould bow to Interplanetary and Spencer Chambers.\n\nRuss watched the meter. The speed was little more than ten miles a\nsecond now and dropping rapidly. He sat motionless, hunched, sucking at\nhis dead pipe, listening to the thrumming of the generators.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"If we only had a margin,\" he groaned. \"If we just had a few more\nhorsepower. Just a few. But we're wide open. Every engine is developing\neverything it can!\"\n\nGreg tapped him on the shoulder, gently. Russ turned his head and looked\ninto the face of his friend, a face as bleak as ever, but with a hint of\nsmile in the corners of the eyes.\n\n\"Why not let Jupiter help us?\" he asked. \"He could be a lot of help.\"\n\nRuss stared for a moment, uncomprehending. Then with a sob of gladness\nhe reached out a hand, shoved over a lever. Mirrors of anti-entropy\nshifted, assumed different angles, and the _Invincible_ sheered off.\nThey were no longer retreating directly from the Sun, but at an angle\nquartering off across the Solar System.\n\nGreg grinned. \"We're falling behind Jupiter now. Letting Jupiter run\naway from us as he circles his orbit, following the Sun. Adds miles per\nsecond to our velocity of retreat, even if it doesn't show on the dial.\"\n\nThe cosmic tug of war went on, grimly--two ships straining, fighting\neach other, one seeking to escape, the other straining to snake the\nsecond ship into the maw of open, hostile space.\n\nThe speed was down to five miles a second, then a fraction lower. The\nneedle was flickering now, impossible to decide whether it was dropping\nor not. And in the engine rooms, ten great generators howled in their\nattempt to make that needle move up the dial again.\n\nRuss lit his pipe, his eyes not leaving the dial. The needle was\ncreeping lower again. Down to three miles a second now.\n\nHe puffed clouds of smoke and considered. Saturn fortunately was ninety\ndegrees around in his orbit. On the present course, only Neptune\nremained between them and free space. Pluto was far away, but even if it\nhad been, it really wouldn't count, for it was small and had little\nattraction.\n\nIn a short while Ganymede and Callisto would be moving around on the far\nside of Jupiter and that might help. Everything counted so much now.\n\nThe dial was down to two miles a second and there it hung. Hung and\nstayed. Russ watched it with narrowed eyes. By this time Craven\ncertainly would have given up much hope of help from Jupiter. If the big\nplanet couldn't have helped him before, it certainly couldn't now. In\nanother hour or two Earth would transit the Sun and that would cut down\nthe radiant energy to some degree. But in the meantime Craven was\nloading his photo-cells and accumulators, was laying up a power reserve.\nAs a last desperate resort he would use that power, in a final attempt\nto break away from the _Invincible_.\n\nRuss waited for that attempt. There was nothing that could be done about\nit. The engines were developing every watt of power that could be urged\nout of them. If Craven had the power to break away, he would break\naway ... that was all there would be to it.\n\nAn hour passed and the needle crept up a fraction of a point. Russ was\nstill watching the dial, his mind foggy with concentration.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly the _Invincible_ shuddered and seemed to totter in space, as if\nsomething, some mighty force, had struck the ship a terrific blow. The\nneedle swung swiftly backward, reached one mile a second, dipped to half\na mile.\n\nRuss sat bolt upright, holding his breath, his teeth clenched with death\ngrip upon the pipe-stem.\n\nCraven had blasted with everything he had! He had used every last\ntrickle of power in the accumulators ... all the power he had been\nstoring up.\n\nRuss leaped from the chair and raced to the periscopic mirror.\nStooping, he stared into it. Far back in space, like a silver bauble,\nswung Craven's ship. It swung back and forth in space, like a mighty,\ncosmic pendulum. Breathlessly he watched. The ship was still in the grip\nof the space field!\n\n\"Greg,\" he shouted, \"we've got him!\"\n\nHe raced back to the control panel, snapped a glance at the speed dial.\nThe needle was rising rapidly now, a full mile a second. Within another\nfifteen minutes, it had climbed to a mile and a half. The _Invincible_\nwas starting to go places!\n\nThe engines still howled, straining, shrieking, roaring their defiance.\n\nIn an hour the needle indicated the speed of four miles a second. Two\nhours later it was ten and rising visibly as Jupiter fell far behind and\nthe Sun became little more than a glowing cinder.\n\nRuss swung the controls to provide side acceleration and the two ships\nswung far to the rear of Neptune. They would pass that massive planet at\nthe safe distance of a full hundred million miles.\n\n\"He won't even make a pass at it,\" said Greg. \"He knows he's licked.\"\n\n\"Probably trying to store some more power,\" suggested Russ.\n\n\"Sweet chance he has to do that,\" declared Greg. \"Look at that needle\nwalk, will you? We'll hit the speed of light in a few more hours and\nafter that he may just as well shut off his lens. There just won't be\nany radiation for him to catch.\"\n\nCraven didn't make a try at Neptune. The planet was far away when they\nintersected its orbit ... furthermore, a wall of darkness had closed in\nabout the ships. They were going three times as fast as light and the\nspeed was still accelerating!\n\nHour after hour, day after day, the _Invincible_ and its trailing\ncaptive sped doggedly outward into space. Out into the absolute wastes\nof interstellar space, where the stars were flecks of light, like tiny\neyes watching from very far away.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRuss lounged in the control chair and stared out the vision plate. There\nwas nothing to see, nothing to do. There hadn't been anything to see or\ndo for days. The controls were locked at maximum and the engines still\nhammered their roaring song of speed and power. Before them stretched an\nempty gulf that probably never before had been traversed by any\nintelligence, certainly not by man.\n\nOut into the mystery of interstellar space. Only it didn't seem\nmysterious. It was very commonplace and ordinary, almost monotonous.\nRuss gripped his pipe and chuckled.\n\nThere had been a day when men had maintained one couldn't go faster than\nlight. Also, men had claimed that it would be impossible to force nature\nto give up the secret of material energy. But here they were, speeding\nalong faster than light, their engines roaring with the power of\nmaterial energy.\n\nThey were plowing a new space road, staking out a new path across the\ndeserts of space, pioneering far beyond the 'last frontier.'\n\nGreg's steps sounded across the room. \"We've gone a long way, Russ.\nMaybe we better begin to slow down a bit.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Russ. He leaned forward and grasped the controls. \"We'll\nslow down now,\" he said.\n\nSudden silence smote the ship. Their ears, accustomed for days to the\nthroaty roarings of the engines, rang with the torture of no sound.\n\nLong minutes and then new sounds began to be heard ... the soft humming\nof the single engine that provided power for the interior apparatus and\nthe maintenance of the outer screens.\n\n\"Soon as we slow down below the speed of light,\" said Greg, \"we'll throw\nthe televisor on Craven's ship and learn what we can about his\napparatus. No use trying it now, for we couldn't use it, because we're\nin the same space condition it uses in normal operation.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" laughed Russ, \"we can't do much of anything except move.\nEnergies simply can't pass through this space we're in. We're marooned.\"\n\nGreg sat down in a chair, gazed solemnly at Russ.\n\n\"Just what was our top speed?\" he demanded.\n\nRuss grinned. \"Ten thousand times the speed of light,\" he said.\n\nGreg whistled soundlessly. \"A long way from home.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFar away, the stars were tiny pinpoints, like little crystals shining by\nthe reflection of a light. Pinpoints of light and shimmering masses of\nlacy silver ... star dust that seemed ghostly and strange, but was in\nreality the massing of many million mighty stars. And great empty black\nspaces where there was not a single light, where the dark went on and on\nand did not stop.\n\nGreg exhaled his breath softly. \"Well, we're here.\"\n\n\"Wherever that might be,\" amended Russ.\n\nThere were no familiar constellations, not a single familiar star. Every\nsign post of the space they had known was wiped out.\n\n\"There really aren't any brilliant stars,\" said Russ. \"None at all. We\nmust be in a sort of hole in space, a place that's relatively empty of\nany stars.\"\n\nGreg nodded soberly. \"Good thing we have those mechanical shadows.\nWithout them we'd never find our way back home. But we have several that\nwill lead us back.\"\n\nOutside the vision panel, they could see Craven's ship. Freed now of the\nspace field, it was floating slowly, still under the grip of the\nmomentum they had built up in their dash across space. It was so close\nthat they could see the lettering across its bow.\n\n\"So they call it the _Interplanetarian_,\" said Russ.\n\nGreg nodded. \"Guess it's about time we talk to them. I'm afraid they're\ngetting pretty nervous.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Do you have any idea where we are?\" demanded Ludwig Stutsman.\n\nCraven shook his head. \"No more idea than you have. Manning snaked us\nacross billions of miles, clear out of the Solar System into\ninterstellar space. Take a look at those stars and you get some idea.\"\n\nSpencer Chambers stroked his gray mustache, asked calmly: \"What do you\nfigure our chances are of getting back?\"\n\n\"That's something we'll know more about later,\" said Craven. \"Doesn't\nlook too bright right now. I'm not worrying about that. What I'm\nwondering about is what Manning and Page are going to do now that they\nhave us out here.\"\n\n\"I thought you'd be,\" said a voice that came out of clear air.\n\nThey stared at the place from which the voice had seemed to come. There\nwas a slight refraction in the air; then, swiftly, a man took shape. It\nwas Manning. He stood before them, smiling.\n\n\"Hello, Manning,\" said Craven. \"I figured you'd pay us a call when you\ngot around to it.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" snarled Stutsman, but he stopped when Chambers' hand fell\nupon his shoulder, gripped it hard.\n\n\"Got plenty of air?\" asked Greg.\n\n\"Air? Sure. Atmosphere machines working perfectly,\" Craven replied.\n\n\"Fine,\" said Greg. \"How about food and water? Plenty of both?\"\n\n\"Plenty,\" said Craven.\n\n\"Look here, Manning,\" broke in Chambers, \"where's all this questioning\nleading? What have you got up your sleeve?\"\n\n\"Just wanted to be sure,\" Greg told him. \"Would hate to have you fellows\nstarve on me, or go thirsty. Wouldn't want to come back and find you all\ndead.\"\n\n\"Come back?\" asked Chambers wonderingly. \"I'm afraid I don't understand.\nIs this a joke of some sort?\"\n\n\"No joke,\" said Greg grimly. \"I thought you might have guessed. I'm\ngoing to leave you here.\"\n\n\"Leave us here?\" roared Stutsman.\n\n\"Keep your shirt on,\" snapped Greg. \"Just for a while, until we can go\nback to the Solar System and finish a little job we're doing. Then we'll\ncome back and get you.\"\n\nCraven grimaced. \"I thought it would be something like that.\" He\nsquinted at Manning through the thick lenses. \"You never miss a bet, do\nyou?\"\n\nGreg laughed. \"I try not to.\"\n\nA little silence fell upon the three men and Manning's image.\n\nGreg broke it. \"How about your energy collector?\" he asked Craven. \"Will\nit maintain the ship out here? You get cosmic rays. Not too much else,\nI'm afraid.\"\n\nCraven grinned wryly. \"You're right, but we can get along. The\naccumulators are practically drained, though, and we won't be able to\nstore anything. Would you mind shooting us over just a little power?\nEnough to charge the accumulators a little for emergency use.\"\n\nHe looked over his shoulder, almost apprehensively.\n\n\"There might be an emergency out here, you know. Nobody knows anything\nabout this place.\"\n\n\"I'll give you a little power,\" Greg agreed.\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" said Craven, half in mockery. \"No doubt you think\nyourself quite smart, Manning, getting us out here. You know you have us\nstranded, that we can't collect more than enough power to live on.\"\n\n\"That's why I did it,\" Greg said, and vanished.\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER NINETEEN_\n\n\nCraven watched the _Invincible_ gather speed and tear swiftly through\nthe black, saw it grow tiny and then disappear entirely, either\nswallowed by the distance or snapping into the strange super-space that\nexisted beyond the speed of light.\n\nHe turned from the window, chuckling.\n\nStutsman snarled at him: \"What's so funny?\"\n\nThe scientist glared at the wolfish face and without speaking, walked to\nthe desk and sat down. He reached for pencil and paper.\n\nChambers walked over to watch him.\n\n\"You've found something, Doctor,\" he said quietly.\n\nCraven laughed, throatily. \"Yes, I have. I've found a lot. Manning\nthinks he can keep us out here, but he's wrong. We'll be in the Solar\nSystem less than a week after he gets there.\"\n\nChambers stifled a gasp, tried to speak calmly. \"You mean this?\"\n\n\"Of course I mean it. I don't waste my time with foolish jokes.\"\n\n\"You have the secret of material energy?\"\n\n\"Not that,\" the scientist growled, \"but I have something else as\nvaluable. I have the secret of Manning's drive: I know what it is that\nenables him to exceed the speed of light ... to go ten thousand times as\nfast as light ... the Lord knows how much faster if he wanted to.\"\n\n\"No ordinary drive would do that,\" said Chambers. \"It would take more\nthan power to make a ship go that fast.\"\n\n\"You bet your life it would, and Manning is the boy who's got it. He\nuses a space field. I think I can duplicate it.\"\n\n\"And how long will it take you to do this work?\"\n\n\"About a week,\" Craven told him. \"Perhaps a little longer, perhaps a\nlittle less. But once we go, we'll go as fast as Manning does. We'll be\nshort on power, but I think I can do something about that, too.\"\n\nChambers took a chair beside the desk. \"But do we know the way home?\"\n\n\"We can find it,\" said Craven.\n\n\"But there are no familiar constellations,\" objected Chambers. \"He\ndragged us out so far that there isn't a single star that any one of us\ncan identify.\"\n\n\"I said I'd find the Solar System,\" Craven declared impatiently, \"and I\nwill. Manning started out for it, didn't he? I saw the way he went. The\nSun is a type G star and all I'll do is look for a type G star.\"\n\n\"But there may be more than one type G star,\" objected the financier.\n\n\"Probably are,\" Craven agreed, \"but there are other ways of finding the\nSun and identifying it.\"\n\nHe volunteered no further information, went back to work with the pad\nand pencil. Chambers rose wearily from his chair.\n\n\"Tell me when you know what we can do,\" he said.\n\n\"Sure,\" Craven grunted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That's the Sun,\" said Craven. \"That faint star between those two\nbrighter ones.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of it?\" demanded Stutsman.\n\n\"Of course. I don't make blunders.\"\n\n\"It's the only type G star in that direction,\" suggested Chambers,\nhelpfully.\n\n\"Not that, either,\" declared Craven. \"In fact, there are several type G\nstars. I examined them all and I know I'm right.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" challenged Stutsman.\n\n\"Spectroscopic examination. That collector field of ours gathers energy\njust like a burning glass. You've seen a burning glass, haven't you?\"\n\nHe stared at Stutsman, directing the question at him.\n\nStutsman shuffled awkwardly, unhappily.\n\n\"Well,\" Craven went on, \"I used that for a telescope. Gathered the light\nfrom the suns and analyzed it. Of course it didn't act like a real\ntelescope, produce an image or anything like that, but it was ideal for\nspectroscopic work.\"\n\nThey waited for him to explain. Finally, he continued:\n\n\"All of the stars I examined were just type G stars, nothing else, but\nthere was a difference in one of them. First, the spectroscope showed\nlines of reflected light passing through oxygen and hydrogen, water\nvapor and carbon dioxide. Pure planetary phenomena, never found on a\nstar itself. Also it showed that a certain per cent of the light was\npolarized. Now remember that I examined it for a long time and I found\nout something else from the length of observation which convinces me.\nThe light varied with a periodic irregularity. The chronometers aren't\nworking exactly right out here, so I can't give you any explanation in\nterms of hours. But I find a number of regularly recurring changes in\nlight intensity and character ... and that proves the presence of a\nnumber of planetary bodies circling the star. That's the only way one\ncould explain the fluctuations for the G-type star is a steady type. It\ndoesn't vary greatly and has no light fluctuations to speak of. Not like\nthe Cepheid and Mira types.\"\n\n\"And that proves it's our Sun?\" asked Chambers.\n\nCraven nodded. \"Fairly definitely, I'd say.\"\n\n\"How far away is it?\" Stutsman wanted to know.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCraven snorted. \"You would ask something like that.\"\n\n\"But,\" declared Stutsman, \"there are ways of measuring how far a star is\naway from any point, measuring both the distance and the size of the\nstar.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" agreed Craven, \"you find me something solid and within reach\nthat's measurable. Something, preferably, about 200 million miles or so\nacross. Then I'll tell you how far we are from the Sun. This ship is not\nin an orbit. It's not fixed in space. I have no accurate way of\nmeasuring distances and angles simultaneously and accurately. Especially\nangles as small as these would be.\"\n\nCraven and Stutsman glared at one another.\n\n\"It's a long way however you look at it,\" the financier said. \"If we're\ngoing to get there, we'll have to start as soon as possible. How soon\ncan we start, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Very soon. I have the gravity concentration field developed and\nManning left me just enough power to get a good start.\" He chuckled,\ntook off his glasses, wiped the lenses and put them back on again.\n\"Imagine him giving me that power!\"\n\n\"But after we use up that power, what are we going to do?\" demanded\nChambers. \"This collector lens of yours won't furnish us enough to keep\ngoing.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" Craven conceded, \"but we'll be able to get more. We'll\nbuild up what speed we can and then we'll shut off the drive and let\nmomentum carry us along. In the meantime our collector will gather power\nfor us. We're advancing toward the source of radiation now, instead of\naway from it. Out here, where there's little gravity stress, fewer\nconflicting lines of gravitation, we'll be able to spread out the field,\nwiden it, make it thousands of miles across. And the new photo-cells\nwill be a help as well.\"\n\n\"How are the photo-cells coming?\" asked Chambers.\n\nCraven grinned. \"We'll have a bank of them in within a few hours, and\nreplace the others as fast as we can. I have practically the whole crew\nat work on them. Manning doesn't know it, but he found the limit of\nthose photo-cells when he was heaving energy at us back in the Solar\nSystem. He blistered them. I wouldn't have thought it possible, but it\nwas. You have to hand it to Manning and Page. They are a couple of smart\nmen.\"\n\nTo the eye there was only one slight difference between the old cells\nand the new ones. The new type cell, when on no load, appeared milky\nwhite, whereas the old cells on no load were silvery. The granular\nsurface of the new units was responsible for the difference in\nappearance, for each minute section of the surface was covered with even\nmore minute metallic hexagonal pyramids and prisms.\n\n\"Just a little matter of variation in the alloy,\" Craven explained.\n\"Crystalization of the alloy, forming those little prisms and pyramids.\nAs a result, you get a surface thousands of times greater than in the\nold type. Helps you absorb every bit of the energy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Interplanetarian_ arrowed swiftly starward, driving ahead with\nterrific momentum while the collector lens, sweeping up the oncoming\nradiations, charged the great banks of accumulators. The G-type star\ntoward which they were heading was still pale, but the two brighter\nstars to either side blazed like fiery jewels against the black of\nspace.\n\n\"You say we'll be only a week or so behind Manning?\" asked Chambers.\n\nCraven looked at the financier, his eyes narrowed behind the heavy\nlenses. He sucked in his loose lips and turned once again to the control\nboard.\n\n\"Perhaps a little longer,\" he admitted finally. \"We're losing time,\nhaving to go along on momentum in order to collect power. But the nearer\nwe get to those stars, the more power we'll have and we'll be able to\nmove faster.\"\n\nChambers drummed idly on the arm of his chair, thinking.\n\n\"Perhaps there's time yet,\" he said, half to himself. \"With the power\nwe'll have within the Solar System, we can stop Manning and the\nrevolution. We can gain control again.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCraven was silent, watching the dials.\n\n\"Manning might even pass us on the way back to look for us,\" Chambers\nwent on. \"He thinks we're still out there. He wouldn't expect to find us\nwhere we are, light years from where we started.\"\n\nCraven shot him a curious look. \"I wouldn't be too sure of that. Manning\nhas a string of some sort tied to us. He's got us tagged ... good and\nproper. He's always been able to find us again, no matter where we were.\nI have a hunch he'll find us again, even way out here.\"\n\nChambers shrugged his shoulders. \"It really doesn't matter. Just so we\nget close enough to the Sun so we can load those accumulators and jam\nthe photo-cells full. With a load like that we can beat him hands down.\"\n\nThe financier fell into a silence. He stared out of the vision plate,\nwatching the stars. Still far away, but so much nearer than they had\nbeen.\n\nHis brain hummed with dreams. Old dreams, revived again, old dreams of\nconquest and of empire, dreams of a power that held a solar system in\nits grip.\n\nCraven broke his chain of thoughts. \"Where's our friend Stutsman? I\nhaven't seen him around lately.\"\n\nChambers chuckled good-naturedly. \"He's sulking. He seems to have gotten\nthe idea neither one of us likes him. He's been spending most of his\ntime back in the engine room with the crew.\"\n\n\"Were you talking about me?\" asked a silky voice.\n\nThey spun around to see Stutsman standing in the doorway of the control\nroom. His face was twisted into a wolfish grin and in his right hand he\nheld a heat gun.\n\nChambers' voice was sharp, like the note of a clanging bell. \"What's\nthis?\"\n\nStutsman's face twisted into an even more exaggerated grin. \"This,\" he\nsaid, \"is mutiny. I'm taking over!\" He laughed at them.\n\n\"No use calling the crew. They're with me.\"\n\n\"Damn you!\" shouted Chambers, taking a step forward. He halted as\nStutsman jerked the pistol up.\n\n\"Forget it, Chambers. You're just second man from now on. Maybe not even\nsecond man. You tried out this dictator business and you bungled it. You\nwent soft. You're taking orders from me from now on. No questions, no\nback talk. You do as I say and maybe you won't get hurt.\"\n\n\"You're mad, Stutsman!\" cried Chambers. \"You can't get away with this.\"\n\nStutsman barked out a brittle laugh. \"Who is going to stop me?\"\n\n\"The people,\" Chambers shouted at him. \"The people will. They won't\nallow this. When you get back to the Solar System ...\"\n\nStutsman growled, stepping toward Chambers, pistol leveled. \"The people\nwon't have anything to say about this. I'll rule the Solar System the\nway I want to. There won't be anyone else who'll have a thing to say\nabout it. So you dreamed of empire, did you? You dreamed of a solar\ndictatorship. Well, watch me! I'll build a real empire. But I'll be the\nhead of it ... not you.\"\n\nCraven sat down in his chair, crossed his knees. \"Just what do you plan\nto do, Dictator Stutsman?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStutsman fairly foamed at the mouth over the insolence of Craven's\nvoice. \"I'll smash Manning first. I'll wipe him out. This ship will do\nit. You said yourself it would. You have ten times the power he has. And\nthen ...\"\n\nCraven raised a hand and waved him into silence. \"So you plan to reach\nthe Solar System, do you? You plan to meet Manning, and destroy his\nship. Nice plan.\"\n\n\"What's wrong with it?\" challenged Stutsman.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Craven calmly. \"Absolutely nothing at all ... _except\nthat we may never reach the Solar System_!\"\n\nStutsman seemed to sag. The wolfish snarl on his lips drooped. His eyes\nstared. Then with an effort he braced himself.\n\n\"What do you mean? Why can't we?\" He gestured toward the vision plate,\ntoward the tiny yellow star between the two brighter stars.\n\n\"That,\" said Craven, \"isn't our Sun. It has planets, but it isn't our\nSun.\"\n\nChambers stepped quickly to Craven, reached out a hand and hoisted him\nfrom the chair, shook him.\n\n\"You must be joking! That has to be the Sun!\"\n\nCraven shrugged free of Chambers' clutch, spoke in an even voice. \"I\nnever joke. We made a mistake, that's all. I hadn't meant to tell you\nyet. I had intended to get in close to the star and take on a full load\nof power and then try to locate our Sun. But I'm afraid it's a hopeless\ntask.\"\n\n\"A hopeless task?\" shrieked Stutsman. \"You are trying to trick me. This\nis put up between the two of you. That's the Sun over there. I know it\nis!\"\n\n\"It isn't,\" said Craven. \"Manning tricked us. He started off in the\nwrong direction. He made us think he was going straight back to the\nSolar System, but he didn't. He circled and went in some other\ndirection.\"\n\nThe scientist eyed Stutsman calmly. Stutsman's knuckles were white with\nthe grip he had upon the gun.\n\n\"We're lost,\" Craven told him, looking squarely at him. \"We may never\nfind the Solar System!\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER TWENTY_\n\n\nThe revolution was over. Interplanetary officials and army heads had\nfled to the sanctuary of Earth. Interplanetary was ended ... ended\nforever, for on every world, including Earth, material energy engines\nwere humming. The people had power to burn, to throw away, power so\ncheap that it was practically worthless as a commodity, but invaluable\nas a way to a new life, a greater life, a fuller life ... a broader\ndestiny for the human race.\n\nInterplanetary stocks were worthless. The mighty power plants on Venus\nand Mercury were idle. The only remaining tangible asset were the fleets\nof spaceships used less than a month before to ship the accumulators to\nthe outer worlds, to bring them Sunward for recharging.\n\nPatents protecting the rights to the material energy engines had been\nobtained from every government throughout the Solar System. New\ngovernments were being formed on the wreckage of the old. John Moore\nMallory already had been inaugurated as president of the Jovian\nconfederacy. The elections on Mars and Venus would be held within a\nweek.\n\nMercury, its usefulness gone with the smashing of the accumulator trade,\nhad been abandoned. No human foot now trod its surface. Its mighty domes\nwere empty. It went its way, as it had gone for billions of years, a\nlittle burned out, worthless planet, ignored and shunned. For a brief\nmoment it had known the conquering tread of mankind, had played its part\nin the commerce of the worlds, but now it had reverted to its former\nstate ... a lonely wanderer of the regions near the Sun, a pariah among\nthe other planets.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRussell Page looked across the desk at Gregory Manning. He heaved a sigh\nand dug the pipe out of his jacket pocket.\n\n\"It's finished, Greg,\" he said.\n\nGreg nodded solemnly, watching Russ fill the bowl and apply the match.\n\nExcept for the small crew, they were alone in the _Invincible_. John\nMoore Mallory and the others were on their own worlds, forming their own\ngovernments, carrying out the dictates of the people, men who would go\ndown in solar history.\n\nThe _Invincible_ hung just off Callisto. Russ looked out at the mighty\nmoon, saw the lonely stretches of its ice-bound surface, saw the silvery\nspot that was the dome of Ranthoor.\n\n\"All done,\" said Greg, \"except for one thing.\"\n\n\"Go out and get Chambers and the others,\" said Russ, puffing at the\npipe.\n\nGreg nodded. \"We may as well get started.\"\n\nRuss rose slowly, went to the wall cabinet and lifted out a box, the\nmechanical shadow with its tiny space field surrounding the fleck of\nsteel that would lead them to the _Interplanetarian_. Carefully he\nlifted the machine from its resting place and set it on the desk.\nBending over it, he watched the dials.\n\nSuddenly he whistled. \"Greg, they've moved! They aren't where we left\nthem!\"\n\nGreg sprang to his side and stared at the readings. \"They're moving\nfarther away from us ... out into space. Where can they be going?\"\n\nRuss straightened, scowling, pulling at the pipe. \"They probably found\nanother G-type star, and are heading for that. They must think it is old\nSol.\"\n\n\"That sounds like it,\" said Greg. \"We spun all over the map to throw\nCraven off and looped several times so he'd lose all sense of direction.\nNaturally he would be lost.\"\n\n\"But he's evidently got something,\" Russ pointed out. \"We left him\nmarooned ... dead center, out where he didn't have too much radiation\nand couldn't get leverage on any single body. Yet he's moving--and\ngetting farther away all the time.\"\n\n\"He solved our gravitation concentration screen,\" said Greg. \"He tricked\nus into giving him power to build it.\"\n\nThe two men looked at one another for a long minute.\n\n\"Well,\" said Russ, \"that's that. Craven and Chambers and Stutsman. The\nthree villains. All lost in space. Heading for the wrong star.\nHopelessly lost. Maybe they'll never find their way back.\"\n\nHe stopped and relit his pipe. An aching silence fell in the room.\n\n\"Poetic justice,\" said Russ. \"Hail and farewell.\"\n\nGreg rubbed his fist indecisively along the desk. \"I can't do it, Russ.\nWe took them out there. We marooned them. We have to get them back or I\ncouldn't sleep nights.\"\n\nRuss laughed quietly, watching the bleak face that stared at him. \"I\nknew that's what you'd say.\"\n\nHe knocked out the pipe, crushed a fleck of burning tobacco with his\nboot. Pocketing the pipe, he walked to the control panel, sat down and\nreached for the lever. The engines hummed louder and louder. The\n_Invincible_ darted spaceward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It's too late now,\" said Chambers. \"By the time we reach that planetary\nsystem and charge our accumulators, Manning and Page will have\neverything under control back in the Solar System. Even if we could\nlocate the star that was our Sun, we wouldn't have a chance to get there\nin time.\"\n\n\"Too bad,\" Craven said, and wagged his head, looking like a solemn owl.\n\"Too bad. Dictator Stutsman won't have a chance to strut his stuff.\"\n\nStutsman started to say something and thought better of it. He leaned\nback in his chair. From his belt hung a heat pistol.\n\nChambers eyed the pistol with ill-concealed disgust. \"There's no point\nin playing soldier. We aren't going to try to upset your mutiny. So far\nyour taking over the ship hasn't made any difference to us ... so why\nshould we fight you?\"\n\n\"It isn't going to make any difference either,\" said Craven. \"Because\nthere are just two things that will happen to us. We're either lost\nforever, will never find our way back, will spend the rest of our days\nwandering from star to star, or Manning will come out and take us by the\near and lead us home again.\"\n\nChambers started, leaned forward and fastened his steely eyes on Craven.\n\"Do you really think he could find us?\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" Craven replied. \"I don't know how he does it,\nbut I'm convinced he can. Probably, however, he'll find that we are lost\nand get rid of us that way.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Chambers, \"you're wrong there. Manning wouldn't do that.\nHe'll come to get us.\"\n\n\"I don't know why he should,\" snapped Craven.\n\n\"Because he's that sort of man,\" declared Chambers.\n\n\"What you going to do when he does get out here?\" demanded Stutsman.\n\"Fall on his neck and kiss him?\"\n\nChambers smiled, stroked his mustache. \"Why, no,\" he said. \"I imagine\nwe'll fight. We'll give him everything we've got and he'll do the same.\nIt wouldn't seem natural if we didn't.\"\n\n\"You're damned right we will,\" growled Stutsman. \"Because I'm running\nthis show. You seem to keep forgetting that. We have power enough, when\nwe get those accumulators filled, to wipe him out. And that is exactly\nwhat I'm going to do.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said Craven, mockingly, \"just fine. There's just one thing you\nforget. Manning is the only man who can lead us back to the Solar\nSystem.\"\n\n\"Hell,\" stormed Stutsman, \"that doesn't make any difference. I'll find\nmy way back there some way.\"\n\n\"You're afraid of Manning,\" Chambers challenged.\n\nStutsman's hand went down to the heat pistol's grip. His eyes glazed and\nhis face twisted itself into utter hatred. \"I don't know why I keep on\nletting you live. Craven is valuable to me. I can't kill him. But you\naren't. You aren't worth a damn to anyone.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChambers matched his stare. Stutsman's hand dropped from the pistol and\nhe slouched to his feet, walked from the room.\n\nAfraid of Manning! He laughed, a hollow, gurgling laugh. Afraid of\nManning!\n\nBut he was.\n\nWithin his brain hammered a single sentence. Words he had heard Manning\nspeak as he watched over the television set at Manning's mocking\ninvitation. Words that beat into his brain and seared his reason and\nmade his soul shrivel and grow small.\n\nManning talking to Scorio. Talking to him matter-of-factly, but grimly:\n\"_I promise you that we'll take care of Stutsman!_\"\n\nManning had taken Scorio and his gangsters one by one and sent them to\nfar corners of the Solar System. One out to the dreaded Vulcan Fleet,\none to the Outpost, one to the Titan prison, and one to the hell-hole\non Vesta, while Scorio had gone to a little mountain set in a Venus\nswamp. They hadn't a chance. They had been locked within a force shell\nand shunted through millions of miles of space. No trial, no hearing ...\nnothing. Just terrible, unrelenting judgment.\n\n\"_I promise you that we'll take care of Stutsman!_\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Craven's only a few billion miles ahead now,\" said Gregory Manning.\n\"With our margin of speed, we should overhaul him in a few more hours.\nHe is still short on power, but he's remedying that rapidly. He's\ngetting nearer to that sun every minute. Running in toward it as he is,\nhe tends to sweep up outpouring radiations. That helps him collect a\nwhole lot more than he would under ordinary circumstances.\"\n\nRuss, sitting before the controls, pipe clenched in his teeth, watching\nthe dials, nodded soberly.\n\n\"All I'm afraid of,\" he said, \"is that he'll get too close to that sun\nbefore we catch up with him. If he gets close enough so he can fill\nthose accumulators, he'll pack a bigger wallop than we do. It'll all be\nin one bolt, of course, for his power isn't continuous like ours. He has\nto collect it slowly. But when he's really loaded, he can give us aces\nand still win. I'd hate to take everything he could pack into those\naccumulators.\"\n\nGreg shuddered. \"So would I.\"\n\nThe _Invincible_ was exceeding the speed of light, was enveloped in the\nmysterious darkness that characterized the speed. They could see nothing\noutside the ship, for there was nothing to see. But the tiny mechanical\nshadow, occupying a place of honor on the navigation board, kept them\ninformed of the position and the distance of the _Interplanetarian_.\n\nGreg lolled in his chair, watching Russ.\n\n\"I don't think we need to worry about him throwing the entire load of\nthe accumulators at us,\" he said. \"He wouldn't dare load those\naccumulators to peak capacity. He's got to leave enough carrying\ncapacity in the cells to handle any jolts we send him and he knows we\ncan send him plenty. He has to keep that handling margin at all times,\nover and above what he takes in for power, because his absorption screen\nis also a defensive screen. And he has to use some power to keep our\ntelevision apparatus out.\"\n\nRuss chuckled. \"I suppose, at that, we have him plenty worried.\"\n\nThe thunder of the engines filled the control room. For days now that\nthunder had been in their ears. They had grown accustomed to it, now\nhardly noticed it. Ten mighty engines, driving the _Invincible_ at a\npace no other ship had ever obtained, except, possibly, the\n_Interplanetarian_, although lack of power should have held Craven's\nship down to a lower speed. Craven wouldn't have dared to build up the\nacceleration they had now attained, for he would have drained his banks\nand been unable to charge them again.\n\n\"Maybe he won't fight,\" said Russ. \"Maybe he's figured out by this time\nthat he's heading for the wrong star. He may be glad to see us and\nfollow us back to the Solar System.\"\n\n\"No chance of that. Craven and Chambers won't pass up a chance for a\nfight. They'll give us a few wallops if only for the appearance of\nthings.\"\n\n\"We're crawling up all the time,\" said Russ. \"If we can catch him within\nfour or five billion miles of the star, he won't be too tough to handle.\nBe getting plenty of radiations even then, but not quite as much as he\nwould like to have.\"\n\n\"He'll have to start decelerating pretty soon,\" Greg declared. \"He can't\nrun the chance of smashing into the planetary system at the speed he's\ngoing. He won't want to waste too much power using his field as a brake,\nbecause he must know by this time that we're after him and he'll want\nwhat power he has to throw at us.\"\n\nHours passed. The _Invincible_ crept nearer and nearer, suddenly seemed\nto leap ahead as the _Interplanetarian_ began deceleration.\n\n\"Keep giving her all you got,\" Greg urged Russ. \"We've got plenty of\npower for braking. We can overhaul him and stop in a fraction of the\ntime he does.\"\n\nRuss nodded grimly. The distance indicator needle on the mechanical\nshadow slipped off rapidly. Greg, leaping from his chair, hung over it,\nbreathlessly.\n\n\"I think,\" he said, \"we better slow down now. If we don't, we'll be\ninside the planetary system.\"\n\n\"How far out is Craven?\" asked Russ.\n\n\"Not far enough,\" Greg replied unhappily. \"He can't be more than three\nbillion miles from the star and that star's hot. A class G, all right,\nbut a good deal younger than old Sol.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We'll let them know we've arrived,\" grinned Greg. He sent a stabbing\nbeam of half a billion horsepower slashing at the _Interplanetarian_.\n\nThe other ship staggered but steadied itself.\n\n\"They know,\" said Russ cryptically from his position in front of the\nvision plate. \"We shook them up a bit.\"\n\nThey waited. Nothing happened.\n\nGreg scratched his head. \"Maybe you were right. Maybe they don't want to\nfight.\"\n\nTogether they watched the _Interplanetarian_. It was still moving in\ntoward the distant sun, as if nothing had happened.\n\n\"We'll see,\" said Greg.\n\nBack at the controls he threw out a gigantic tractor beam, catching the\nother ship in a net of forces that visibly cut its speed.\n\nSpace suddenly vomited lashing flame that slapped back and licked and\ncrawled in living streamers over the surface of the _Invincible_. The\nengines moaned in their valiant battle to keep up the outer screen. The\npungent odor of ozone filtered into the control room. The whole ship was\nbucking and vibrating, creaking, as if it were being pulled apart.\n\n\"So they don't want to fight, eh?\" hooted Russ.\n\nGreg gritted his teeth. \"They snapped the tractor beam.\"\n\n\"They have power there,\" Russ declared.\n\n\"Too much,\" said Greg. \"More power than they have any right to have.\"\n\nHis hand went out to the lever on the board and pulled it back. A beam\nsmashed out, with the engines' screaming drive behind it, billions of\nhorsepower driving with unleashed ferocity at the other ship.\n\nGreg's hand spun a dial, while the generators roared thunderous\ndefiance.\n\n\"I'm giving them the radiation scale,\" said Greg.\n\nThe _Interplanetarian_ was staggering under the terrific bombardment,\nbut its screen was handling every ounce of the power that Greg was\npouring into it.\n\n\"Their photo-cells can't handle that,\" cried Russ. \"No photo-cell would\nhandle all that stuff you're shooting at them. Unless ...\"\n\n\"Unless what?\"\n\n\"Unless Craven has improved on them.\"\n\n\"We'll have to find out. Get the televisor.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRuss leaped for the television machine.\n\nA moment later he lifted a haggard face.\n\n\"I can't get through,\" he said. \"Craven's got our beams stopped and now\nhe has our television blocked out.\"\n\nGreg nodded. \"We might have expected that. When he could scramble our\ntelevisors back in the Jovian worlds, he certainly ought to be able to\nscreen his ship against them.\"\n\nHe shoved the lever clear over, slamming the extreme limit of power\ninto the beam. The engines screamed like demented things, howling and\nshrieking. Instantly a tremendous sheet of solid flame spun a fiery web\naround the _Interplanetarian_, turning it into a blazing inferno of\nlapping, leaping fire.\n\nA dozen terrific beams, billions of horsepower in each, stabbed back at\nthe _Invincible_ as the _Interplanetarian_ shunted the terrific energy\ninflux from the overcharged accumulators to the various automatic energy\ndischarges.\n\nThe _Invincible's_ screen flared in defense and the ten great engines\nwailed in utter agony. More stabbing flame shot from the\n_Interplanetarian_ in slow explosions.\n\nThe temperature in the _Invincible's_ control room was rising. The ozone\nwas sharp enough to make their eyes water and nostrils burn. The vision\nglass was blanked out by the lapping flames that crawled and writhed\nover the screen outside the glass.\n\nRuss tore his collar open, wiped his face with his shirt sleeve. \"Try a\npure magnetic!\"\n\nGreg, his face set and bleak as a wall of stone, grunted agreement. His\nfingers danced over the control manual.\n\nSuddenly the stars outside twisted and danced, like stars gone mad, as\nif they were dancing a riotous jig in space, some uproariously hopping\nup and down while others were applauding the show that was being\nprovided for their unblinking eyes.\n\nThe magnetic field was tightening now, twisting the light from those\ndistant stars and bending it straight again. The _Interplanetarian_\nreeled like a drunken thing and the great arcs of electric flame looped\nmadly and plunged straight for the field's very heart.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe stars danced weirdly in far-off space again as the\n_Interplanetarian's_ accumulators lashed out with tremendous force to\noppose the energy of the field.\n\nThe field glowed softly and disappeared.\n\n\"They have us stopped at every turn,\" groaned Russ. \"There must be some\nway, something we can do.\" He looked at Greg. Greg grinned without\nhumor, wiping his face. \"There is something we can do,\" said Russ\ngrimly. \"We should have thought of it long ago.\"\n\nHe strode to the desk, reached out one hand and drew a calculator near.\n\n\"You keep them busy,\" he snapped. \"I'll have this thing figured out in\njust a while.\"\n\nFrom the engine rooms came the roar and hum of the laboring units and\nthe _Invincible_ shuddered once again as Greg grimly hurled one beam\nafter another, at the _Interplanetarian_.\n\nThe _Interplanetarian_ struck back, using radio frequency that flamed\nfiercely against the _Invincible's_ outer screen. Simultaneously the\n_Interplanetarian_ leaped forward with a sudden surge of accumulated\nenergy, driving at the star that lay not more than three billion miles\naway.\n\nGreg worked desperately, cursing under his breath. He pulled down the\nouter screen that was fighting directly against the radio frequency,\nenergy for energy, and allowed the beam to strike squarely on the second\nscreen, the inversion field that shunted the major portion of the energy\nimpacting against it through 90 degrees into another space.\n\nThe engines moaned softly and settled into a quieter rumble as the\nnecessity of supplying the first screen was eliminated. But they\nscreamed once again as Greg sent out a tractor beam that seized and\nheld, dragged the _Interplanetarian_ to a standstill. Craven's ship had\ngained millions of miles, though, and established a tremendous advantage\nby fighting nearer to its source of energy.\n\n\"Russ,\" gasped Greg, \"if you don't get that scheme of yours figured out\npretty soon, we're done for. They've stopped everything we've got.\nThey're nearer the sun. We won't stand a chance if they make another\nbreak like that.\"\n\nRuss glanced up to answer, but his mouth fell open in amazement and he\ndid not speak. A streak of terrible light was striking at them from the\n_Interplanetarian_, blinding white light, and along that highway of\nlight swarmed a horde of little green figures, like squirming green\namebas. Swarming toward the _Invincible_, stretching out hungry,\npale-green pseudopods toward the inversion barrier ... _and eating\nthrough it_!\n\nWherever they touched, holes appeared. They drifted through the\ninversion screen easily and began drilling into the inner screen of\nanti-entropy. Eating their way into the anti-entropy ... _into a state\nof matter which Russ and Greg had thought would resist all change_!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor seconds both men stood transfixed, unable to believe the evidence of\ntheir eyes. But the ameba things came on in ever-increasing throngs,\ncreatures that gnawed and slobbered at the anti-entropy, eating into it,\nflaking it away, drilling their way through it.\n\nWhen they pierced the anti-entropy, they would cut through the steel\nplates of the _Invincible_ like so much paper!\n\nAnd more were coming. More and more!\n\nWith a grunt of amazement, Greg slammed a beam straight into the heart\nof the amebas. They ate the beam and vanished as mistily as before,\nlittle glowing things that ate and died. But there were always more to\ntake their place. They overwhelmed the beam and ate back along its\nlength, attacked the screen again.\n\nThey ate through walls of force and walls of metal, and a rush of\nhissing air began to flame into ions in the terrific battle of energies\noutside the _Invincible_.\n\nRuss was crouching over the manual of the televisor board. His breath\nmoaned in his throat as his fingers flew.\n\n\"I have to have power, Greg,\" he said. \"Lots of power.\"\n\n\"Take it.\" Greg replied. \"I haven't been able to do anything with it. It\nisn't any use to me.\"\n\nRuss's thumb reached out and tripped the activating lever. The giant\nengines shrieked and yowled.\n\nSomething was happening on the television screen ... something\nterrifying. Craven's ship seemed to retreat suddenly for millions of\nmiles ... and as suddenly the _Invincible_ appeared on the screen. For a\nsingle flashing instant, the view held; then it was gone in blank\ngrayness. For seconds nothing happened on the screen, unnerving seconds\nwhile the two men held their breath.\n\nThe screen's grayness fled and they looked into the control room of the\n_Interplanetarian_. Craven was hunched in a chair, intent upon a series\nof controls. Behind him and to one side stood Stutsman, a heat pistol\ndangled from his hand, his face twisted into a sneer of triumph. There\nwas no sign of Chambers.\n\n\"You damn fool,\" Craven was snapping at Stutsman. \"You're cheating us\nout of the only chance we ever had of getting home.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Shut up,\" snarled Stutsman, the pistol jerking in his hand. \"Have you\ngot that apparatus on full power?\"\n\n\"It's been on full power for minutes now,\" said Craven. \"It must be\neating holes straight through Manning's ship.\"\n\n\"See you keep it that way. I really don't need you any more, anyhow.\nI've watched and I know all the tricks. I could carry on this battle\nsingle-handed.\"\n\nCraven did not reply, merely hunched closer over the controls, eyes\nwatching flickering dials.\n\nGreg jogged Russ's elbow. \"That must be the apparatus over there, in the\ncorner of the room. That triangular affair. A condenser of some sort.\nThat stuff they're throwing at us must be super-saturated force fields\nand they'd need a space-field condenser for that.\"\n\nRuss nodded. \"We'll take care of that.\"\n\nHis fingers moved swiftly and a transport beam whipped out, riding the\ntelevision beam. Bands of force wrapped around the triangular machine\nand wrenched viciously. In the screen the apparatus disappeared ...\nsimply was gone. It now lay within the _Invincible's_ control room,\njerked there by the tele-transport.\n\nThe flood of dazzling light reaching out from the _Interplanetarian_\nsnapped off and the little green ameba things were gone. The shrill\nwhistle of escaping air stopped as the eaten screens clamped down again,\nsealing in the atmosphere despite the holes bored through the metal\nplates.\n\nIn the television screen, Craven leaped from his chair, was staring with\nStutsman at the place where the concentrator had stood. The machine had\nbeen ripped from a welded base and jagged, bright, torn metal gleamed in\nthe control room lights. Snapped cables and broken busbars lay piled\nabout the room.\n\n\"What happened?\" Stutsman was screaming. They heard Craven laugh at the\nterror in the other's voice. \"Manning just walked in and grabbed it away\nfrom us.\"\n\n\"But he couldn't! We had the screen up! He couldn't get through!\"\n\nCraven shrugged his shoulders. \"I don't know how he did it, but he did.\nProbably he could clean out the whole place if he wanted to.\"\n\n\"That's a good idea,\" said Russ, judiciously.\n\nHe stripped bank after bank of the other ship's photo-cells from their\nmoorings, wrecked the force field controls, ripped cables from the\nengines and left the ship without means of collecting power, without\nmeans of using power, without means of movement, of offense or defense.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe leaned back in his chair and regarded the screen with deep\nsatisfaction.\n\n\"That,\" he decided, \"should hold them for a while.\"\n\nHe hauled the pipe out of his pocket and filled it from the battered\nleather pouch.\n\nGreg regarded him with a quizzical stare. \"You sent the televisor back\nin time. You got it inside the _Interplanetarian_ before Craven had run\nup his screen and then you brought it forward.\"\n\n\"You guessed it,\" said Russ, tamping the tobacco into the bowl. \"We\nshould have thought of that long ago. We have a time factor there. In\nfact, the whole thing revolves around time. We move the televisor, we\nuse the tele-transport, by giving the objects we wish to move an\nacceleration in time.\"\n\nGreg wrinkled his brow. \"Maybe that means we can really investigate the\npast, or even the future. Can sit here before our screen and see\neverything that has happened, everything that is going to happen.\"\n\nRuss shook his head. \"I don't know, Greg. Notice, though, that we got no\nscreen response until the televisor came up out of the past and actually\nreached the point which coincided with the present. That is, the screen\nand the televisor itself have to be on the same time level for them to\noperate. We might modify the screen, even modify the televisor so that\nwe could travel in time, but it will take a lot of research, a lot of\nwork. And especially it will take a whale of a lot of power.\"\n\n\"We have the power,\" said Greg.\n\nRuss moved the lighter back and forth over the tobacco, igniting it\ncarefully. Clouds of blue smoke swirled around his head. He spoke out of\nthe smoke.\n\n\"Right now,\" he said, \"we better see how Craven and our other friends\nare getting along. I didn't like the way Stutsman was talking or the way\nhe was swinging that gun around. And Chambers wasn't anywhere in sight.\nThere's something screwy about the entire thing.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"What are we going to do now?\" demanded Stutsman.\n\nCraven grinned at him. \"That's up to you. Remember, you're the master\nmind around here. You took over and said you were going to run things.\"\nHe waved a casual hand at the shattered machines, the ripped-out\napparatus. \"Well, there you are. Go ahead and run the joint.\"\n\n\"But you will have to help,\" pleaded Stutsman, his face twisted until it\nseemed that he was suffering intense physical agony. \"You know what to\ndo. I don't.\"\n\nCraven shook his head. \"There isn't any use starting. Manning will be\nalong almost anytime now. We'll wait and see what he has in mind.\"\n\n\"Manning!\" shrieked Stutsman, waving the pistol wildly. \"Always Manning.\nOne would think you were working for Manning.\"\n\n\"He's the big shot out in this little corner of space right now,\" Craven\npointed out. \"There isn't any way you can get around that.\"\n\nStutsman backed carefully away. His gun came up and he looked at Craven\nappraisingly, as if selecting his targets.\n\n\"Put down that gun,\" said a voice.\n\nGregory Manning stood between Stutsman and Craven. There had been no\nfoggy forerunner of his appearance. He had just snapped out of empty\nair.\n\nStutsman stared at him, his eyes widening, but the gun remained steady\nin his hand.\n\n\"Look out, Craven,\" warned Greg. \"He's going to fire and it will go\nright through me and hit you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was the thump of a falling body as Craven hurled himself out of\nhis chair, hit the floor and rolled. Stutsman's gun vomited flame. The\nspouting flame passed through Greg's image, blasted against the chair in\nwhich Craven had sat, fused it until it fell in on itself.\n\n\"Russ,\" said Greg quietly, \"disarm this fellow before he hurts\nsomebody.\"\n\nAn unseen force reached out and twisted the gun from Stutsman's hand,\nflung it to one side. Swiftly Stutsman's hands were forced behind his\nback and held there by invisible bonds.\n\nStutsman cried out, tried to struggle, but he was unable to move. It was\nas if giant hands had gripped him, were holding him in a viselike\nclutch.\n\n\"Thanks, Manning,\" said Craven, getting up off the floor. \"The fool\nwould have shot this time. He's threatened it for days. He has been\ndeveloping a homicidal mania.\"\n\n\"We don't need to worry about him now,\" declared Greg. He turned around\nto face Craven. \"Where's Chambers?\"\n\n\"Stutsman locked him up,\" said Craven. \"I imagine he has the key in his\npocket. Locked him up in the stateroom. Chambers jumped him and tried to\ntake the gun away from him and Stutsman laid him out, hit him over the\nhead. He kept Chambers locked up after that. Hasn't allowed anyone to go\nnear the room. Hasn't even given him food and water. That was three days\nago.\"\n\n\"Get the key out of his pocket,\" directed Greg. \"Go and see how Chambers\nis.\"\n\nAlone in the control room with Stutsman, Greg looked at him.\n\n\"I have a score to settle with you, Stutsman,\" he said. \"I had intended\nto let it ride, but not now.\"\n\n\"You can't touch me,\" blustered Stutsman. \"You wouldn't dare.\"\n\n\"What makes you think I wouldn't?\"\n\n\"You're bluffing. You've got a lot of tricks, but you can't do the\nthings you would like me to think you can. You've got Chambers and\nCraven fooled, but not me.\"\n\n\"It may be that I can offer you definite proof.\"\n\nChambers staggered over the threshold. His clothing was rumpled. A rude\nbandage was wound around his head. His face was haggard and his eyes\nred.\n\n\"Hello, Manning,\" he said. \"I suppose you've won. The Solar System must\nbe in your control by now.\"\n\nHe lifted his hand to his mustache, brushed it, a feeble attempt at\nplaying the old role he'd acted so long.\n\n\"We've won,\" said Greg quietly, \"but you're wrong about our being in\ncontrol. The governments are in the hands of the people, where they\nshould be.\"\n\nChambers nodded. \"I see,\" he mumbled. \"Different people, different\nideas.\" His eyes rested on Stutsman and Greg saw sudden rage sweep\nacross the gray, haggard face. \"So you've got him, have you? What are\nyou going to do with him? What are you going to do with all of us?\"\n\n\"I haven't had time to think about it,\" said Greg. \"I've principally\nbeen thinking about Stutsman here.\"\n\n\"He mutinied,\" rasped Chambers. \"He seized the ship, turned the crew\nagainst me.\"\n\n\"And the penalty for that,\" said Greg, quietly, \"is death. Death by\nwalking in space.\"\n\nStutsman writhed within the bands of force that held him tight. His face\ncontorted. \"No, damn you! You can't do that! Not to me, you can't!\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" roared Chambers and Stutsman quieted.\n\n\"I was thinking, too,\" said Greg, \"that at his order thousands of people\nwere mercilessly shot down back in the Solar System. Stood against a\nwall and mowed down. Others were killed like wild animals in the street.\nThousands of them.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe moved slowly toward Stutsman and the man cringed.\n\n\"Stutsman,\" he said, \"you're a butcher. You're a stench in the nostrils\nof humanity. You aren't fit to live.\"\n\n\"Those,\" said Craven, \"are my sentiments exactly.\"\n\n\"You hate me,\" screamed Stutsman. \"All of you hate me. You are doing\nthis because you hate me.\"\n\n\"Everyone hates you, Stutsman,\" said Greg. \"Every living person hates\nyou. You have a cloud of hate hanging over you as black and wide as\nspace.\"\n\nThe man closed his eyes, trying to break free of the bonds.\n\n\"Bring me a spacesuit,\" snapped Greg, watching Stutsman's face.\n\nCraven brought it and dropped it at Stutsman's feet.\n\n\"All right, Russ,\" said Greg. \"Turn him loose.\"\n\nStutsman swayed and almost fell as the bands of force released him.\n\n\"Get into that suit,\" ordered Greg.\n\nStutsman hesitated, but something he saw in Greg's face made him lift\nthe suit, step into it, fasten it about his body.\n\n\"What are you going to do with me?\" he whimpered. \"You aren't going to\ntake me back to Earth again, are you? You aren't going to make me stand\ntrial?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Greg, gravely, \"we aren't taking you back to Earth. And\nyou're standing trial right now.\"\n\nStutsman read his fate in the cold eyes that stared into his. Chattering\nfrightenedly, he rushed at Greg, plunged through him, collided with the\nwall of the ship and toppled over, feebly attempting to rise.\n\nInvisible hands hoisted him to his feet, gripped him, held him upright.\nGreg walked toward him, stood facing him.\n\n\"Stutsman,\" he said, \"you have four hours of air. That will give you\nfour hours to think, to make your peace with death.\" He turned toward\nthe other two. Chambers nodded grimly. Craven said nothing.\n\n\"And now,\" said Greg to Craven, \"if you will fasten down his helmet.\"\n\nThe helmet clanged shut, shutting out the pleas and threats that came\nfrom Stutsman's throat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStutsman saw distant stars, cruel, gleaming eyes that glared at him.\nEmpty space fell away on all sides.\n\nNumbed by fear, he realized where he was. Manning had picked him up and\nthrown him far into space ... out into that waste where for hundreds of\nlight years there was only the awful nothingness of space.\n\nHe was less than a speck of dust, in this great immensity of emptiness.\nThere was no up or down, no means of orientation.\n\nLoneliness and terror closed in on him, a terrible agony of fear. In\nfour hours his air would be gone and then he would die! His body would\nswirl and eddy through this great cosmic ocean. It would never be found.\nIt would remain here, embalmed by the cold of space, until the last clap\nof eternity.\n\nThere was one way, the easy way. His hand reached up and grasped the\nconnection between his helmet and the air tank. One wrench and he would\ndie swiftly, quickly ... instead of letting death stalk him through the\ndarkness for the next four hours.\n\nHe shivered and his hand loosened its hold, dropped away. He was afraid\nto hasten death. He wanted to put it off. He was afraid of death ...\nhorribly afraid.\n\nThe stars mocked him and he seemed to hear hooting laughter from\nsomewhere far away. Curiously, it sounded like his own laughter....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I'll make it easy for you, Manning,\" Chambers said. \"I know that all of\nus are guilty. Guilty in the eyes of the people and the law. Guilty in\nyour eyes. If we had won, there would have been no penalty. There's\nnever a penalty for the one who wins.\"\n\n\"Penalty,\" said Greg, his eyes half smiling. \"Why, yes, I think there\nis. I'm going to order you aboard the _Invincible_ for something to eat\nand to get some rest.\"\n\n\"You mean to say that we aren't prisoners?\"\n\nGreg shook his head. \"Not prisoners,\" he said. \"Why, I came out here to\nguide you back to Earth. I hauled you out here and got you into this\njam. It was up to me to get you out of it. I would have done the same\nfor Stutsman, too, but ...\"\n\nHe hesitated and looked at Chambers.\n\nChambers stared back and slowly nodded.\n\n\"Yes, Manning,\" he said. \"I think I understand.\"\n\n\n\n\n_CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE_\n\n\nChambers lit his cigar and leaned back in his chair.\n\n\"I wish you could see it my way, Manning,\" he said. \"There's no place\nfor me on Earth, no place for me in the Solar System. You see, I tried\nand failed. I'm just a has-been back there.\"\n\nHe laughed quietly. \"Somehow, I can't imagine myself coming back in the\nrole of the defeated tribal leader, chained to your chariot, so to\nspeak.\"\n\n\"But it wouldn't be that way,\" protested Greg. \"Your company is gone,\ntrue, and your stocks are worthless, but you haven't lost everything.\nYou still have a fleet of ships. With our new power, the Solar System\nwill especially need ships. Lots of ships. For the spacelanes will be\nfilled with commerce. You'd be coming back to a new deal, a new Solar\nSystem, a place that has been transformed almost overnight by power\nthat's practically free.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know all that,\" said Chambers. \"But I climbed too high. I\ngot too big. I can't come back now as something small, a failure.\"\n\n\"You have things we need,\" said Greg. \"The screen that blankets out our\ntelevision and tele-transport, for example. We need your screen as a\nsafeguard against the very thing we have created. Think of what criminal\nuses could be made of the tele-transport. No vault, no net of charged\nwires, nothing, could stop a thief from taking anything he wanted.\nPrisons would cease to be prisons. Criminals could reach in and pick up\ntheir friends, no matter how many guards there were. Prisons and bank\nvaults and national treasuries could be cleaned out in a single day.\"\n\n\"Then there's the super-saturated space fields,\" added Russ, ruefully.\n\"Those almost got us. If I hadn't thought of moving the televisor\nthrough time, we would have had to pull stakes and run for it.\"\n\n\"No, you wouldn't,\" pointed out Craven. \"You could have wiped us out in\na moment. You can disintegrate matter. Send it up in a puff of smoke ...\nrip every electron apart and send it hurtling away.\"\n\n\"Of course we could have, Craven,\" said Greg, \"but we wouldn't.\"\n\nChambers laughed softly. \"Not quite mad enough at us to do that, eh?\"\n\nGreg looked at him. \"I guess that must have been it.\"\n\n\"But I'm curious about the green space fields,\" persisted Russ.\n\n\"Simple,\" said Craven. \"They were just fields that had more energy\npacked into a certain portion of space than space could take. Space\nfields that had far more than their share of energy, more than they\ncould hold. A super-saturated solution will crystalize almost\nimmediately onto the tiniest crystal put into it. Those fields acted the\nsame way. They crystalized instantly into hyper-space the moment they\ncame into contact with other energy, whether as photons of radiation,\nmatter or other space fields. Your anti-entropy didn't stand a chance\nunder those conditions. When they crystalized, they took a chunk of the\nfield along with them, a small chunk, but one after another they ate a\nhole right through your screen.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Something like that would have a commercial value,\" said Greg. \"Useful\nin war, too, and now that mankind has taken to space, now that we're\nspreading out, we must think of possible attack. There must be life on\nother planets throughout the Galaxy. Someday they'll come. If they\ndon't, someday we'll go to them. And we may need every type of armament\nwe can get our hands on.\"\n\nChambers knocked the ash off his cigar and was staring out the vision\nport. The ship had swung so that through the port could be seen the\ndistant star toward which the _Interplanetarian_ had been driving.\n\n\"For my part,\" said Chambers, slowly, measuring each word, \"you can have\nthose findings of ours. We'll give them to you, knowing you will use\nthem as they should be used. Craven can tell you how they work. That is,\nif Craven wants to. He is the man who developed them.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Craven. \"They'll be something to remember us by.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But you are coming back with us, aren't you?\" asked Greg.\n\nCraven shook his head. \"No, I'm going with Chambers. I don't know what\nhe's thinking of, but whatever it is, it's all right with me. We've been\ntogether too long. I'd miss someone to fight with.\"\n\nChambers was still staring out the vision port. He was talking, but he\ndid not seem to be talking to them.\n\n\"I had a dream, you see. I saw the people struggling against the\ninefficiency and stupidity of popular government. I saw the periodic\nrise of bad leaders. I saw them lead the people into blunders. I read\nhistory and I saw that since the time man had risen from the ape, this\nhad been going on. So I proposed to give the people scientific\ngovernment ... a business administration. An administration that would\nhave run the government exactly as a successful businessman runs his\nbusiness. The people would have resented it if I had told them they\ndidn't know how to run their affairs. There was only one way to do\nit ... gain control and force it down their throats.\"\n\nChambers was no longer a beaten man, no longer a man with a white\nbandage around his head and his power stripped from him. Once again he\nwas the fighting financier who had sat back at the desk in the\nInterplanetary building on Earth and issued orders ... orders that sped\nacross millions of miles of space.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"They didn't want it. Man doesn't want to\nlive under scientific government. He doesn't want to be protected\nagainst blunders. He wants what he calls freedom. The right to do the\nthings he wants to do, even if it means making a damn fool of himself.\nThe right to rise to great heights and tumble to equally low depths.\nThat's human nature and I ruled it out. But you can't rule out human\nnature.\"\n\nThey sat in silence, no one speaking. Russ cupped his pipe bowl in his\nhand and watched Chambers. Chambers leaned back and slowly puffed at\nthe cigar. Greg just sat, his face unchanging.\n\nCraven finally broke the silence. \"Just what are you planning to do?\"\n\nChambers flicked his hand toward the distant sun that gleamed through\nthe vision port.\n\n\"There's a new solar system out there,\" he said. \"New worlds, a new sun.\nA place to start over again. You and I discovered it. It's ours by right\nof discovery. We'll go there and stake out our claim.\"\n\n\"But there may be nothing there,\" protested Greg. \"That sun is younger\nthan our Sun. The planets may not have cooled as yet. Life may not have\ndeveloped.\"\n\n\"In such a case,\" said Chambers, \"we shall find another planetary system\naround another sun. A system that has cooled, where there is life.\"\n\nRuss gasped. Here was something important, something that should set a\nprecedent. The first men to roam from star to star seeking new worlds.\nThe first men to turn their backs on the old solar system and strike out\nin search of new worlds swinging in their paths around distant suns.\n\nGreg was saying, \"All right, if that's the way you want it. I was hoping\nyou'd come back with us. But we'll help you repair your ship. We'll give\nyou all the supplies we can spare.\"\n\nRuss rose to his feet. \"That,\" he said, \"calls for a little drink.\"\n\nHe opened a cabinet and took out bottles and glasses.\n\n\"Only three,\" said Chambers. \"Craven doesn't drink.\"\n\nCraven interrupted. \"Pour one for me, too, Page.\"\n\nChambers looked at the scientist, astounded. \"I never knew you to take a\ndrink in your life.\"\n\nCraven twisted his face into a grin. \"This is a special occasion.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Invincible_ was nearing Mars, heading for Earth, which was still a\ngreenish sphere far to one side of the flaming Sun.\n\nRuss watched the little green globe, thinking.\n\nEarth was home. To him it always would be home. But that would be\nchanged soon. Just a few more generations, and, to millions upon\nmillions of human beings, Earth no longer would be home.\n\nWith the new material energy engines, life on every planet would be\npossible now, even easy. The cost of manufacture, mining, shipping\nacross the vast distances between the planets would be only a fraction\nof what it had been when man had been forced to rely upon the unwieldy,\nexpensive accumulator system of supplying life-giving power.\n\nNow Mars would have power of her own. Even Pluto could generate her own.\nAnd power was ... well, it was power. The power to live, the power to\nwork, to establish and maintain commerce, to adjust gravity to Earth\nstandard or to any standard. The power to remake and reshape and rebuild\nplanetary conditions to suit man exactly.\n\nEarthmen and Earthwomen would be moving out en masse now to the new and\nvirgin fields of endeavor--to the farms of Venus, to the manufacturing\ncenters that were springing up on Mars, to the mines of the Jovian\nworlds, to the great laboratory plants that would spring up on Titan and\non Pluto and on the other colder worlds.\n\nThe migration of races had started long ago. In the Old Stone Age, the\nCro-Magnon had swept out of nowhere to oust the Neanderthal. Centuries\nlater the barbarians of the north, in another of those restless\nmigrations, had overwhelmed and swept away the Roman Empire. And many\ncenturies later, migration had turned from Europe to a new world across\nthe sea, and fighting Americans had battled their way from east to west,\nconquering a continent.\n\nAnd now another great migration was on--man was leaving the Earth,\nmoving into space. He was leaving behind him the world that had reared\nand fostered him. He was striking out and out. First the planets would\nbe overrun, and then man would leap from the planets to the stars!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor years after America had become a country, had built a tradition of\nher own, Europe was regarded by millions as the homeland. But as the\nyears swept by, this had ceased to be and the Americas were a world unto\nthemselves, owing nothing to Europe.\n\nAnd that was the way it would be with Earth. For centuries, for\nthousands of years, Earth would be the Mother Planet, the homeland for\nall the millions of roaming men and women who dared the gulfs of space\nand the strangeness of new worlds. There would be trips back to the\nEarth for sentimental reasons ... to see the place where one's ancestors\nwere born and had lived, to goggle at the monument which marked the\npoint from which the first spaceship had taken off for the Moon, to\nvisit old museums and see old cities and breathe the air that men and\nwomen had breathed for thousands of years before they found the power to\ntake them anywhere.\n\nIn the end, Earth would be just a worn-out planet. Even now her\nminerals were rapidly being exhausted; her oil wells were dry and all\nher coal was mined; her industry stabilized and filled; her businesses\ninterlocking and highly competitive. A world that was too full, that had\ntoo many things, too many activities, too many people. A world that\ndidn't need men and women. A world where even genius was kept from\nrising to the top.\n\nAnd this was what was driving mankind away from the Earth. The\ncompetition, the crowded conditions, in business and industrial fields,\nthe lack of opportunity for new development, the everlasting struggle to\nget ahead, fighting for a place to live when millions of others were\nfighting for the same thing. But not entirely that, not that alone.\nThere was something else--that old adventuresome spirit, the driving\nurge to face new dangers, to step over old frontiers, to do and dare, to\nmake a damn fool of one's self, or to surpass the greatest\naccomplishments of history.\n\nBut Earth would never die, for there was a part of Earth in every man\nand woman who would go forth into space, part of Earth's courage, part\nof Earth's ideals, part of Earth's dreams. The habits and the virtues\nand the faults that Earth had spawned and fostered ... these were things\nthat would never die. Old Earth would live forever. Even when she was\ndrifting dust and the Sun was a dead, cold star, Earth would live on in\nthe courage and the dreams that by that time would be spreading to the\nfar corners of the Galaxy.\n\nRuss dug the pipe out of his pocket, searched for the pouch, found it on\nthe desk behind him. It was empty.\n\n\"Hell,\" he said, \"my tobacco's all gone.\"\n\nGreg grinned. \"You won't have to wait long. We'll be back on Earth in a\nfew more hours.\"\n\nRuss put the stem between his teeth, bit down on it savagely. \"I guess\nthat's right. I can dry smoke her until we get there.\"\n\nEarth was larger now. Mars had swung astern.\n\nSuddenly a winking light stabbed out into space from the night side of\nEarth. Signaling ... signaling ... clearing the spacelanes for a greater\nfuture than any human prophet had ever predicted.\n\n\nThe End\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Empire, by Clifford Donald Simak\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK EMPIRE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 28215.txt or 28215.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/8/2/1/28215/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Stephen Blundell and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
