F. BONE_\n\n\n        _Generally,\n          human beings don't do\n      totally useless things\n        consistently and widely.\n    So--maybe there is\n            something to it--_\n\n\n\"We call it Thurston's Disease for two perfectly good reasons,\" Dr.\nWalter Kramer said. \"He discovered it--and he was the first to die of\nit.\" The doctor fumbled fruitlessly through the pockets of his lab coat.\n\"Now where the devil did I put those matches?\"\n\n\"Are these what you're looking for?\" the trim blonde in the gray\nseersucker uniform asked. She picked a small box of wooden safety\nmatches from the littered lab table beside her and handed them to him.\n\n\"Ah,\" Kramer said. \"Thanks. Things have a habit of getting lost around\nhere.\"\n\n\"I can believe that,\" she said as she eyed the frenzied disorder around\nher. Her boss wasn't much better than his laboratory, she decided as she\nwatched him strike a match against the side of the box and apply the\nflame to the charred bowl of his pipe. His long dark face became half\nobscured behind a cloud of bluish smoke as he puffed furiously. He\nlooked like a lean untidy devil recently escaped from hell with his\nthick brows, green eyes and lank black hair highlighted intermittently\nby the leaping flame of the match. He certainly didn't look like a\npathologist. She wondered if she was going to like working with him, and\nshook her head imperceptibly. Possibly, but not probably. It might be\ndifficult being cooped up here with him day after day. Well, she could\nalways quit if things got too tough. At least there was that\nconsolation.\n\nHe draped his lean body across a lab stool and leaned his elbows on\nits back. There was a faint smile on his face as he eyed her\nquizzically. \"You're new,\" he said. \"Not just to this lab but to the\nInstitute.\"\n\n[Illustration: ILLUSTRATED BY BARBERIS]\n\nShe nodded. \"I am, but how did you know?\"\n\n\"Thurston's Disease. Everyone in the Institute knows that name for the\nplague, but few outsiders do.\" He smiled sardonically. \"Virus pneumonic\nplague--that's a better term for public use. After all, what good does\nit do to advertise a doctor's stupidity?\"\n\nShe eyed him curiously. \"_De mortuis?_\" she asked.\n\nHe nodded. \"That's about it. We may condemn our own, but we don't like\nlaymen doing it. And besides, Thurston had good intentions. He never\ndreamed this would happen.\"\n\n\"The road to hell, so I hear, is paved with good intentions.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" Kramer said dryly. \"Incidentally, did you apply for this\njob or were you assigned?\"\n\n\"I applied.\"\n\n\"Someone should have warned you I dislike clich\u00e9s,\" he said. He paused a\nmoment and eyed her curiously. \"Just why did you apply?\" he asked. \"Why\nare you imprisoning yourself in a sealed laboratory which you won't\nleave as long as you work here. You know, of course, what the conditions\nare. Unless you resign or are carried out feet first you will remain\nhere ... have you considered what such an imprisonment means?\"\n\n\"I considered it,\" she said, \"and it doesn't make any difference. I\nhave no ties outside and I thought I could help. I've had training. I\nwas a nurse before I was married.\"\n\n\"Divorced?\"\n\n\"Widowed.\"\n\nKramer nodded. There were plenty of widows and widowers outside. Too\nmany. But it wasn't much worse than in the Institute where, despite\nprecautions, Thurston's disease took its toll of life.\n\n\"Did they tell you this place is called the suicide section?\" he asked.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Weren't you frightened?\"\n\n\"Of dying? Hardly. Too many people are doing it nowadays.\"\n\nHe grimaced, looking more satanic than ever. \"You have a point,\" he\nadmitted, \"but it isn't a good one. Young people should be afraid of\ndying.\"\n\n\"You're not.\"\n\n\"I'm not young. I'm thirty-five, and besides, this is my business. I've\nbeen looking at death for eleven years. I'm immune.\"\n\n\"I haven't your experience,\" she admitted, \"but I have your attitude.\"\n\n\"What's your name?\" Kramer said.\n\n\"Barton, Mary Barton.\"\n\n\"Hm-m-m. Well, Mary--I can't turn you down. I need you. But I could wish\nyou had taken some other job.\"\n\n\"I'll survive.\"\n\nHe looked at her with faint admiration in his greenish eyes. \"Perhaps\nyou will,\" he said. \"All right. As to your duties--you will be my\nassistant, which means you'll be a dishwasher, laboratory technician,\nsecretary, junior pathologist, and coffee maker. I'll help you with all\nthe jobs except the last one. I make lousy coffee.\" Kramer grinned, his\nteeth a white flash across the darkness of his face. \"You'll be on call\ntwenty-four hours a day, underpaid, overworked, and in constant danger\nuntil we lick Thurston's virus. You'll be expected to handle the jobs of\nthree people unless I can get more help--and I doubt that I can. People\nstay away from here in droves. There's no future in it.\"\n\nMary smiled wryly. \"Literally or figuratively?\" she asked.\n\nHe chuckled. \"You have a nice sense of graveyard humor,\" he said. \"It'll\nhelp. But don't get careless. Assistants are hard to find.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I won't. While I'm not afraid of dying I don't want\nto do it. And I have no illusions about the danger. I was briefed quite\nthoroughly.\"\n\n\"They wanted you to work upstairs?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I suppose they need help, too. Thurston's Disease has riddled the\nmedical profession. Just don't forget that this place can be a death\ntrap. One mistake and you've had it. Naturally, we take every\nprecaution, but with a virus no protection is absolute. If you're\ncareless and make errors in procedure, sooner or later one of those\nsubmicroscopic protein molecules will get into your system.\"\n\n\"You're still alive.\"\n\n\"So I am,\" Kramer said, \"but I don't take chances. My predecessor, my\nsecretary, my lab technician, my junior pathologist, and my dishwasher\nall died of Thurston's Disease.\" He eyed her grimly. \"Still want the\njob?\" he asked.\n\n\"I lost a husband and a three-year old son,\" Mary said with equal\ngrimness. \"That's why I'm here. I want to destroy the thing that killed\nmy family. I want to do something. I want to be useful.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"I think you can be,\" he said quietly.\n\n\"Mind if I smoke?\" she asked. \"I need some defense against that pipe of\nyours.\"\n\n\"No--go ahead. Out here it's all right, but not in the security\nsection.\"\n\nMary took a package of cigarettes from her pocket, lit one and blew a\ncloud of gray smoke to mingle with the blue haze from Kramer's pipe.\n\n\"Comfortable?\" Kramer asked.\n\nShe nodded.\n\nHe looked at his wrist watch. \"We have half an hour before the roll tube\ncultures are ready for examination. That should be enough to tell you\nabout the modern Pasteur and his mutant virus. Since your duties will\nprimarily involve Thurston's Disease, you'd better know something about\nit.\" He settled himself more comfortably across the lab bench and went\non talking in a dry schoolmasterish voice. \"Alan Thurston was an\nimmunologist at Midwestern University Medical School. Like most men in\nthe teaching trade, he also had a research project. If it worked out,\nhe'd be one of the great names in medicine; like Jenner, Pasteur, and\nSalk. The result was that he pushed it and wasn't too careful. He wanted\nto be famous.\"\n\n\"He's well known now,\" Mary said, \"at least within the profession.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" Kramer said dryly. \"He was working with gamma radiations on\nmicroorganisms, trying to produce a mutated strain of _Micrococcus\npyogenes_ that would have enhanced antigenic properties.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, doctor. It's been four years since I was active in\nnursing. Translation, please.\"\n\nKramer chuckled. \"He was trying to make a vaccine out of a common\ninfectious organism. You may know it better as _Staphylococcus_. As you\nknow, it's a pus former that's made hospital life more dangerous than it\nshould be because it develops resistance to antibiotics. What Thurston\nwanted to do was to produce a strain that would stimulate resistance in\nthe patient without causing disease--something that would help patients\nprotect themselves rather than rely upon doubtfully effective\nantibiotics.\"\n\n\"That wasn't a bad idea.\"\n\n\"There was nothing wrong with it. The only trouble was that he wound up\nwith something else entirely. He was like the man who wanted to make a\nplastic suitable for children's toys and ended up with a new explosive.\nYou see, what Thurston didn't realize was that his cultures were\ncontaminated. He'd secured them from the University Clinic and had, so\nhe thought, isolated them. But somehow he'd brought a virus\nalong--probably one of the orphan group or possibly a phage.\"\n\n\"Orphan?\"\n\n\"Yes--one that was not a normal inhabitant of human tissues. At any rate\nthere was a virus--and he mutated it rather than the bacteria. Actually,\nit was simple enough, relatively speaking, since a virus is infinitely\nsimpler in structure than a bacterium, and hence much easier to modify\nwith ionizing radiation. So he didn't produce an antigen--he produced a\ndisease instead. Naturally, he contracted it, and during the period\nbetween his infection and death he managed to infect the entire\nhospital. Before anyone realized what they were dealing with, the\ndisease jumped from the hospital to the college, and from the college to\nthe city, and from the city to--\"\n\n\"Yes, I know that part of it. It's all over the world now--killing\npeople by the millions.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well,\" Kramer said, \"at least it's solved the population explosion.\" He\nblew a cloud of blue smoke in Mary's direction. \"And it did make\nThurston famous. His name won't be quickly forgotten.\"\n\nShe coughed. \"I doubt if it ever will be,\" she said, \"but it won't be\nremembered the way he intended.\"\n\nHe looked at her suspiciously. \"That cough--\"\n\n\"No, it's not Thurston's Disease. It's that pipe. It's rancid.\"\n\n\"It helps me think,\" Kramer said.\n\n\"You could try cigarettes--or candy,\" she suggested.\n\n\"I'd rather smoke a pipe.\"\n\n\"There's cancer of the lip and tongue,\" she said helpfully.\n\n\"Don't quote Ochsner. I don't agree with him. And besides, you smoke\ncigarettes, which are infinitely worse.\"\n\n\"Only four or five a day. I don't saturate my system with nicotine.\"\n\n\"In another generation,\" Kramer observed, \"you'd have run through the\nstreets of the city brandishing an ax smashing saloons. You're a lineal\ndescendent of Carrie Nation.\" He puffed quietly until his head was\nsurrounded by a nimbus of smoke. \"Stop trying to reform me,\" he added.\n\"You haven't been here long enough.\"\n\n\"Not even God could do that, according to the reports I've heard,\" she\nsaid.\n\nHe laughed. \"I suppose my reputation gets around.\"\n\n\"It does. You're an opinionated slave driver, a bully, an intellectual\ntyrant, and the best pathologist in this center.\"\n\n\"The last part of that sentence makes up for unflattering honesty of the\nfirst,\" Kramer said. \"At any rate, once we realized the situation we\nwent to work to correct it. Institutes like this were established\neverywhere the disease appeared for the sole purpose of examining,\ntreating, and experimenting with the hope of finding a cure. This\nsection exists for the evaluation of treatment. We check the human\ncases, and the primates in the experimental laboratories. It is our\nduty to find out if anything the boys upstairs try shows any promise. We\nwere a pretty big section once, but Thurston's virus has whittled us\ndown. Right now there is just you and me. But there's still enough work\nto keep us busy. The experiments are still going on, and there are still\nhuman cases, even though the virus has killed off most of the\nsusceptibles. We've evaluated over a thousand different drugs and\ntreatments in this Institute alone.\"\n\n\"And none of them have worked?\"\n\n\"No--but that doesn't mean the work's been useless. The research has\nsaved others thousands of man hours chasing false leads. In this\nbusiness negative results are almost as important as positive ones. We\nmay never discover the solution, but our work will keep others from\nmaking the same mistakes.\"\n\n\"I never thought of it that way.\"\n\n\"People seldom do. But if you realize that this is international, that\nevery worker on Thurston's Disease has a niche to fill, the picture will\nbe clearer. We're doing our part inside the plan. Others are, too. And\nthere are thousands of labs involved. Somewhere, someone will find the\nanswer. It probably won't be us, but we'll help get the problem solved\nas quickly as possible. That's the important thing. It's the biggest\nchallenge the race has ever faced--and the most important. It's a\nquestion of survival.\" Kramer's voice was sober. \"We have to solve this.\nIf Thurston's Disease isn't checked, the human race will become\nextinct. As a result, for the first time in history all mankind is\nworking together.\"\n\n\"All? You mean the Communists are, too?\"\n\n\"Of course. What's an ideology if there are no people to follow it?\"\nKramer knocked the ashes out of his pipe, looked at the laboratory clock\nand shrugged. \"Ten minutes more,\" he said, \"and these tubes will be\nready. Keep an eye on that clock and let me know. Meantime you can\nstraighten up this lab and find out where things are. I'll be in the\noffice checking the progress reports.\" He turned abruptly away, leaving\nher standing in the middle of the cluttered laboratory.\n\n\"Now what am I supposed to do here?\" Mary wondered aloud. \"Clean up, he\nsays. Find out where things are, he says. Get acquainted with the place,\nhe says. I could spend a month doing that.\" She looked at the littered\nbench, the wall cabinets with sliding doors half open, the jars of\nreagents sitting on the sink, the drainboard, on top of the refrigerator\nand on the floor. The disorder was appalling. \"How he ever manages to\nwork in here is beyond me. I suppose that I'd better start\nsomewhere--perhaps I can get these bottles in some sort of order first.\"\nShe sighed and moved toward the wall cabinets. \"Oh well,\" she mused, \"I\nasked for this.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Didn't you hear that buzzer?\" Kramer asked.\n\n\"Was that for me?\" Mary said, looking up from a pile of bottles and\nglassware she was sorting.\n\n\"Partly. It means they've sent us another post-mortem from upstairs.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know--man or monkey, it makes no difference. Whatever it is,\nit's Thurston's Disease. Come along. You might as well see what goes on\nin our ultra modern necropsy suite.\"\n\n\"I'd like to.\" She put down the bottle she was holding and followed him\nto a green door at the rear of the laboratory.\n\n\"Inside,\" Kramer said, \"you will find a small anteroom, a shower, and a\ndressing room. Strip, shower, and put on a clean set of lab coveralls\nand slippers which you will find in the dressing room. You'll find\nsurgical masks in the wall cabinet beside the lockers. Go through the\ndoor beyond the dressing room and wait for me there. I'll give you ten\nminutes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We do this both ways,\" Kramer said as he joined her in the narrow hall\nbeyond the dressing room. \"We'll reverse the process going out.\"\n\n\"You certainly carry security to a maximum,\" she said through the mask\nthat covered the lower part of her face.\n\n\"You haven't seen anything yet,\" he said as he opened a door in the\nhall. \"Note the positive air pressure,\" he said. \"Theoretically nothing\ncan get in here except what we bring with us. And we try not to bring\nanything.\" He stood aside to show her the glassed-in cubicle overhanging\na bare room dominated by a polished steel post-mortem table that\nglittered in the harsh fluorescent lighting. Above the table a number of\njointed rods and clamps hung from the ceiling. A low metal door and\nseries of racks containing instruments and glassware were set into the\nopposite wall together with the gaping circular orifice of an open\nautoclave.\n\n\"We work by remote control, just like they do at the AEC. See those\nhandlers?\" He pointed to the control console set into a small stainless\nsteel table standing beside the sheet of glass at the far end of the\ncubicle. \"They're connected to those gadgets up there.\" He indicated the\njointed arms hanging over the autopsy table in the room beyond. \"I could\nperform a major operation from here and never touch the patient. Using\nthese I can do anything I could in person with the difference that\nthere's a quarter inch of glass between me and my work. I have controls\nthat let me use magnifiers, and even do microdissection, if necessary.\"\n\n\"Where's the cadaver?\" Mary asked.\n\n\"Across the room, behind that door,\" he said, waving at the low, sliding\nmetal partition behind the table. \"It's been prepped, decontaminated and\nready to go.\"\n\n\"What happens when you're through?\"\n\n\"Watch.\" Dr. Kramer pressed a button on the console in front of him. A\nsection of flooring slid aside and the table tipped. \"The cadaver slides\noff that table and through that hole. Down below is a highly efficient\ncrematorium.\"\n\nMary shivered. \"Neat and effective,\" she said shakily.\n\n\"After that the whole room is sprayed with germicide and sterilized with\nlive steam. The instruments go into the autoclave, and thirty minutes\nlater we're ready for another post-mortem.\"\n\n\"We use the handlers to put specimens into those jars,\" he said,\npointing to a row of capped glass jars of assorted sizes on a wall rack\nbehind the table. \"After they're capped, the jars go onto that carrier\nbeside the table. From here they pass through a decontamination chamber\nand into the remote-control laboratory across the hall where we can run\nbiochemical and histological techniques. Finished slides and mounted\nspecimens then go through another decontamination process to the outside\nlab. Theoretically, this place is proof against anything.\"\n\n\"It seems to be,\" Mary said, obviously impressed. \"I've never seen\nanything so elegant.\"\n\n\"Neither did I until Thurston's Disease became a problem.\" Kramer\nshrugged and sat down behind the controls. \"Watch, now,\" he said as he\npressed a button. \"Let's see what's on deck--man or monkey. Want to make\na bet? I'll give you two to one it's a monkey.\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe low door slid aside and a steel carriage emerged into the necropsy\nroom bearing the nude body of a man. The corpse gleamed pallidly under\nthe harsh shadowless glare of the fluorescents in the ceiling as Kramer,\nusing the handlers, rolled it onto the post-mortem table and clamped it\nin place on its back. He pushed another button and the carriage moved\nback into the wall and the steel door slid shut. \"That'll be\ndecontaminated,\" he said, \"and sent back upstairs for another body. I'd\nhave lost,\" he remarked idly. \"Lately the posts have been running three\nto one in favor of monkeys.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe moved a handler and picked up a heavy scalpel from the instrument\nrack. \"There's a certain advantage to this,\" he said as he moved the\nhandler delicately. \"These gadgets give a tremendous mechanical\nadvantage. I can cut right through small bones and cartilage without\nusing a saw.\"\n\n\"How nice,\" Mary said. \"I expect you enjoy yourself.\"\n\n\"I couldn't ask for better equipment,\" he replied noncommittally. With\ndeft motion of the handler he drew the scalpel down across the chest\nand along the costal margins in the classic inverted \"Y\" incision.\n\"We'll take a look at the thorax first,\" he said, as he used the\nhandlers to pry open the rib cage and expose the thoracic viscera. \"Ah!\nThought so! See that?\" He pointed with a small handler that carried a\nprobe. \"Look at those lungs.\" He swung a viewer into place so Mary could\nsee better. \"Look at those abscesses and necrosis. It's Thurston's\nDisease, all right, with secondary bacterial invasion.\"\n\nThe grayish solidified masses of tissue looked nothing like the normal\npink appearance of healthy lungs. Studded with yellowish spherical\nabscesses they lay swollen and engorged within the gaping cavity of the\nchest.\n\n\"You know the pathogenesis of Thurston's Disease?\" Kramer asked.\n\nMary shook her head, her face yellowish-white in the glare of the\nfluorescents.\n\n\"It begins with a bronchial cough,\" Kramer said. \"The virus attacks the\nbronchioles first, destroys them, and passes into the deeper tissues of\nthe lungs. As with most virus diseases there is a transitory\nleukopenia--a drop in the total number of white blood cells--and a rise\nin temperature of about two or three degrees. As the virus attacks the\nalveolar structures, the temperature rises and the white blood cell\ncount becomes elevated. The lungs become inflamed and painful. There is\na considerable quantity of lymphoid exudate and pleural effusion.\nSecondary invaders and pus-forming bacteria follow the viral destruction\nof the lung tissue and form abscesses. Breathing becomes progressively\nmore difficult as more lung tissue is destroyed. Hepatization and\nnecrosis inactivate more lung tissue as the bacteria get in their dirty\nwork, and finally the patient suffocates.\"\n\n\"But what if the bacteria are controlled by antibiotics?\"\n\n\"Then the virus does the job. It produces atelectasis followed by\nprogressive necrosis of lung tissue with gradual liquefaction of the\nparenchyma. It's slower, but just as fatal. This fellow was lucky. He\napparently stayed out of here until he was almost dead. Probably he's\nhad the disease for about a week. If he'd have come in early, we could\nhave kept him alive for maybe a month. The end, however, would have been\nthe same.\"\n\n\"It's a terrible thing,\" Mary said faintly.\n\n\"You'll get used to it. We get one or two every day.\" He shrugged.\n\"There's nothing here that's interesting,\" he said as he released the\nclamps and tilted the table. For what seemed to Mary an interminable\ntime, the cadaver clung to the polished steel. Then abruptly it slid off\nthe shining surface and disappeared through the square hole in the\nfloor. \"We'll clean up now,\" Kramer said as he placed the instruments in\nthe autoclave, closed the door and locked it, and pressed three buttons\non the console.\n\nFrom jets embedded in the walls a fine spray filled the room with fog.\n\n\"Germicide,\" Kramer said. \"Later there'll be steam. That's all for\nnow. Do you want to go?\"\n\nMary nodded.\n\n\"If you feel a little rocky there's a bottle of Scotch in my desk. I'll\nsplit a drink with you when we get out of here.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Mary said. \"I think I could use one.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Barton! Where is the MacNeal stain!\" Kramer's voice came from the lab.\n\"I left it on the sink and it's gone!\"\n\n\"It's with the other blood stains and reagents. Second drawer from the\nright in the big cabinet. There's a label on the drawer,\" Mary called\nfrom the office. \"If you can wait until I finish filing these papers,\nI'll come in and help you.\"\n\n\"I wish you would,\" Kramer's voice was faintly exasperated. \"Ever since\nyou've organized my lab I can't find anything.\"\n\n\"You just have a disorderly mind,\" Mary said, as she slipped the last\npaper into its proper folder and closed the file. \"I'll be with you in a\nminute.\"\n\n\"I don't dare lose you,\" Kramer said as Mary came into the lab. \"You've\nmade yourself indispensable. It'd take me six months to undo what you've\ndone in one. Not that I mind,\" he amended, \"but I was used to things the\nway they were.\" He looked around the orderly laboratory with a mixture\nof pride and annoyance. \"Things are so neat they're almost painful.\"\n\n\"You look more like a pathologist should,\" Mary said as she deftly\nremoved the tray of blood slides from in front of him and began to run\nthe stains. \"It's my job to keep you free to think.\"\n\n\"Whose brilliant idea is that? Yours?\"\n\n\"No--the Director's. He told me what my duties were when I came here.\nAnd I think he's right. You should be using your brain rather than\nfooling around with blood stains and sectioning tissues.\"\n\n\"But I like to do things like that,\" Kramer protested. \"It's relaxing.\"\n\n\"What right have you to relax,\" Mary said. \"Outside, people are dying by\nthe thousands and you want to relax. Have you looked at the latest\nmortality reports?\"\n\n\"No--\"\n\n\"You should. The WHO estimates that nearly two billion people have died\nsince Thurston's Disease first appeared in epidemic proportions. That's\ntwo out of three. And more are dying every day. Yet you want to relax.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Kramer said, \"but what can we do about it. We're working but\nwe're getting no results.\"\n\n\"You might use that brain of yours,\" Mary said bitterly. \"You're\nsupposed to be a scientist. You have facts. Can't you put them\ntogether?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" He shrugged, \"I've been working on this problem longer\nthan you think. I come down here at night--\"\n\n\"I know. I clean up after you.\"\n\n\"I haven't gotten anywhere. Sure, we can isolate the virus. It grows\nnicely on monkey lung cells. But that doesn't help. The thing has no\napparent antigenicity. It parasitizes, but it doesn't trigger any immune\nreaction. We can kill it, but the strength of the germicide is too great\nfor living tissue to tolerate.\"\n\n\"Some people seem to be immune.\"\n\n\"Sure they do--but why?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me. I'm not the scientist.\"\n\n\"Play like one,\" Kramer growled. \"Here are the facts. The disease\nattacks people of all races and ages. So far every one who is attacked\ndies. Adult Europeans and Americans appear to be somewhat more resistant\nthan others on a population basis. Somewhere around sixty per cent of\nthem are still alive, but it's wiped out better than eighty per cent of\nsome groups. Children get it worse. Right now I doubt if one per cent of\nthe children born during the past ten years are still alive.\"\n\n\"It's awful!\" Mary said.\n\n\"It's worse than that. It's extinction. Without kids the race will die\nout.\" Kramer rubbed his forehead.\n\n\"Have you any ideas?\"\n\n\"Children have less resistance,\" Kramer replied. \"An adult gets exposed\nto a number of diseases to which he builds an immunity. Possibly one of\nthese has a cross immunity against Thurston's virus.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you work on that line?\" Mary asked.\n\n\"Just what do you think I've been doing? That idea was put out months\nago, and everyone has been taking a crack at it. There are twenty-four\nlaboratories working full time on that facet and God knows how many more\nworking part time like we are. I've screened a dozen common diseases,\nincluding the six varieties of the common cold virus. All, incidentally,\nwere negative.\"\n\n\"Well--are you going to keep on with it?\"\n\n\"I have to.\" Kramer rubbed his eyes. \"It won't let me sleep. I'm sure\nwe're on the right track. Something an adult gets gives him resistance\nor immunity.\" He shrugged. \"Tell you what. You run those bloods out and\nI'll go take another look at the data.\" He reached into his lab coat and\nproduced a pipe. \"I'll give it another try.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I wish you'd read without puffing on that thing,\" Mary said.\n\n\"Your delicate nose will be the death of me yet--\" Kramer said.\n\n\"It's my lungs I'm worried about,\" Mary said. \"They'll probably look\nlike two pieces of well-tanned leather if I associate with you for\nanother year.\"\n\n\"Stop complaining. You've gotten me to wear clean lab coats. Be\nsatisfied with a limited victory,\" Kramer said absently, his eyes\nstaring unseeingly at a row of reagent bottles on the bench. Abruptly he\nnodded. \"Fantastic,\" he muttered, \"but it's worth a check.\" He left the\nroom, slamming the door behind him in his hurry.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That man!\" Mary murmured. \"He'd drive a saint out of his mind. If I\nwasn't so fond of him I'd quit. If anyone told me I'd fall in love\nwith a pathologist, I'd have said they were crazy. I wish--\" Whatever\nthe wish was, it wasn't uttered. Mary gasped and coughed rackingly.\nCarefully she moved back from the bench, opened a drawer and found a\nthermometer. She put it in her mouth. Then she drew a drop of blood from\nher forefinger and filled a red and white cell pipette, and made a smear\nof the remainder.\n\nShe was interrupted by another spasm of coughing, but she waited until\nthe paroxysm passed and went methodically back to her self-appointed\ntask. She had done this many times before. It was routine procedure to\ncheck on anything that might be Thurston's Disease. A cold, a sore\nthroat, a slight difficulty in breathing--all demanded the diagnostic\ncheck. It was as much a habit as breathing. This was probably the result\nof that cold she'd gotten last week, but there was nothing like being\nsure. Now let's see--temperature 99.5 degrees, red cell count 4-1/2\nmillion. White cell count ... oh! 2500 ... leukopenia! The differential\nshowed a virtual absence of polymorphs, lymphocytes and monocytes. The\nwhole slide didn't have two hundred. Eosinophils and basophils way\nup--twenty and fifteen per cent respectively--a relative rise rather\nthan an absolute one--leukopenia, no doubt about it.\n\nShe shrugged. There wasn't much question. She had Thurston's Disease. It\nwas the beginning stages, the harsh cough, the slight temperature, the\nleukopenia. Pretty soon her white cell count would begin to rise, but\nit would rise too late. In fact, it was already too late. It's funny,\nshe thought. I'm going to die, but it doesn't frighten me. In fact, the\nonly thing that bothers me is that poor Walter is going to have a\nterrible time finding things. But I can't put this place the way it was.\nI couldn't hope to.\n\nShe shook her head, slid gingerly off the lab stool and went to the hall\ndoor. She'd better check in at the clinic, she thought. There was bed\nspace in the hospital now. Plenty of it. That hadn't been true a few\nmonths ago but the only ones who were dying now were the newborn and an\noccasional adult like herself. The epidemic had died out not because of\nlack of virulence but because of lack of victims. The city outside, one\nof the first affected, now had less than forty per cent of its people\nleft alive. It was a hollow shell of its former self. People walked its\nstreets and went through the motions of life. But they were not really\nalive. The vital criteria were as necessary for a race as for an\nindividual. Growth, reproduction, irritability, metabolism--Mary smiled\nwryly. Whoever had authored that hackneyed mnemonic that life was a\n\"grim\" proposition never knew how right he was, particularly when one of\nthe criteria was missing.\n\nThe race couldn't reproduce. That was the true horror of Thurston's\nDisease--not how it killed, but who it killed. No children played in the\nparks and playgrounds. The schools were empty. No babies were pushed in\ncarriages or taken on tours through the supermarkets in shopping\ncarts. No advertisements of motherhood, or children, or children's\nthings were in the newspapers or magazines. They were forbidden\nsubjects--too dangerously emotional to touch. Laughter and shrill young\nvoices had vanished from the earth to be replaced by the drab grayness\nof silence and waiting. Death had laid cold hands upon the hearts of\nmankind and the survivors were frozen to numbness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was odd, she thought, how wrong the prophets were. When Thurston's\nDisease broke into the news there were frightened predictions of the end\nof civilization. But they had not materialized. There were no mass\ninsurrections, no rioting, no organized violence. Individual excesses,\nyes--but nothing of a group nature. What little panic there was at the\nbeginning disappeared once people realized that there was no place to\ngo. And a grim passivity had settled upon the survivors. Civilization\ndid not break down. It endured. The mechanics remained intact. People\nhad to do something even if it was only routine counterfeit of normal\nlife--the stiff upper lip in the face of disaster.\n\nIt would have been far more odd, Mary decided, if mankind had given way\nto panic. Humanity had survived other plagues nearly as terrible as\nthis--and racial memory is long. The same grim patience of the past was\nhere in the present. Man would somehow survive, and civilization go\non.\n\nIt was inconceivable that mankind would become extinct. The whole vast\nresources and pooled intelligence of surviving humanity were focused\nupon Thurston's Disease. And the disease would yield. Humanity waited\nwith childlike confidence for the miracle that would save it. And the\nmiracle would happen, Mary knew it with a calm certainty as she stood in\nthe cross corridor at the end of the hall, looking down the thirty yards\nof tile that separated her from the elevator that would carry her up to\nthe clinic and oblivion. It might be too late for her, but not for the\nrace. Nature had tried unaided to destroy man before--and had failed.\nAnd her unholy alliance with man's genius would also fail.\n\nShe wondered as she walked down the corridor if the others who had\nsickened and died felt as she did. She speculated with grim amusement\nwhether Walter Kramer would be as impersonal as he was with the others,\nwhen he performed the post-mortem on her body. She shivered at the\nthought of that bare sterile room and the shining table. Death was not a\npretty thing. But she could meet it with resignation if not with\ncourage. She had already seen too much for it to have any meaning. She\ndid not falter as she placed a finger on the elevator button.\n\nPoor Walter--she sighed. Sometimes it was harder to be among the living.\nIt was good that she didn't let him know how she felt. She had sensed a\nchange in him recently. His friendly impersonality had become merely\nfriendly. It could, with a little encouragement, have developed into\nsomething else. But it wouldn't now. She sighed again. His hardness had\nbeen a tower of strength. And his bitter gallows humor had furnished a\nwry relief to grim reality. It had been nice to work with him. She\nwondered if he would miss her. Her lips curled in a faint smile. He\nwould, if only for the trouble he would have in making chaos out of the\norder she had created. Why couldn't that elevator hurry?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Mary! Where are you going?\" Kramer's voice was in her ears, and his\nhand was on her shoulder.\n\n\"Don't touch me!\"\n\n\"Why not?\" His voice was curiously different. Younger, excited.\n\n\"I have Thurston's Disease,\" she said.\n\nHe didn't let go. \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"The presumptive tests were positive.\"\n\n\"Initial stages?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"I had the first coughing attack a few minutes ago.\"\n\nHe pulled her away from the elevator door that suddenly slid open. \"You\nwere going to that death trap upstairs,\" he said.\n\n\"Where else can I go?\"\n\n\"With me,\" he said. \"I think I can help you.\"\n\n\"How? Have you found a cure for the virus?\"\n\n\"I think so. At least it's a better possibility than the things they're\nusing up there.\" His voice was urgent. \"And to think I might never\nhave seen it if you hadn't put me on the track.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you're right?\"\n\n\"Not absolutely, but the facts fit. The theory's good.\"\n\n\"Then I'm going to the clinic. I can't risk infecting you. I'm a carrier\nnow. I can kill you, and you're too important to die.\"\n\n\"You don't know how wrong you are,\" Kramer said.\n\n\"Let go of me!\"\n\n\"No--you're coming back!\"\n\nShe twisted in his grasp. \"Let me go!\" she sobbed and broke into a fit\nof coughing worse than before.\n\n\"What I was trying to say,\" Dr. Kramer said into the silence that\nfollowed, \"is that if you have Thurston's Disease, you've been a carrier\nfor at least two weeks. If I am going to get it, your going away can't\nhelp. And if I'm not, I'm not.\"\n\n\"Do you come willingly or shall I knock you unconscious and drag you\nback?\" Kramer asked.\n\nShe looked at his face. It was grimmer than she had ever seen it before.\nNumbly she let him lead her back to the laboratory.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But, Walter--I can't. That's sixty in the past ten hours!\" she\nprotested.\n\n\"Take it,\" he said grimly, \"then take another. And inhale. Deeply.\"\n\n\"But they make me dizzy.\"\n\n\"Better dizzy than dead. And, by the way--how's your chest?\"\n\n\"Better. There's no pain now. But the cough is worse.\"\n\n\"It should be.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You've never smoked enough to get a cigarette cough,\" he said.\n\nShe shook her head dizzily. \"You're so right,\" she said.\n\n\"And that's what nearly killed you,\" he finished triumphantly.\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"I'm certain. Naturally, I can't prove it--yet. But that's just a matter\nof time. Your response just about clinches it. Take a look at the\nrecords. Who gets this disease? Youngsters--with nearly one hundred per\ncent morbidity and one hundred per cent mortality. Adults--less than\nfifty per cent morbidity--and again one hundred per cent mortality. What\nmakes the other fifty per cent immune? Your crack about leather lungs\nstarted me thinking--so I fed the data cards into the computer and keyed\nthem for smoking versus incidence. And I found that not one heavy smoker\nhad died of Thurston's Disease. Light smokers and nonsmokers--plenty of\nthem--but not one single nicotine addict. And there were over ten\nthousand randomized cards in that spot check. And there's the exact\nreverse of that classic experiment the lung cancer boys used to sell\ntheir case. Among certain religious groups which prohibit smoking there\nwas nearly one hundred per cent mortality of all ages!\n\n\"And so I thought since the disease was just starting in you, perhaps I\ncould stop it if I loaded you with tobacco smoke. And it works!\"\n\n\"You're not certain yet,\" Mary said. \"I might not have had the\ndisease.\"\n\n\"You had the symptoms. And there's virus in your sputum.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"But, nothing! I've passed the word--and the boys in the other labs\nfigure that there's merit in it. We're going to call it Barton's Therapy\nin your honor. It's going to cause a minor social revolution. A lot of\nlaws are going to have to be rewritten. I can see where it's going to be\nillegal for children not to smoke. Funny, isn't it?\n\n\"I've contacted the maternity ward. They have three babies still alive\nupstairs. We get all the newborn in this town, or didn't you know.\nFunny, isn't it, how we still try to reproduce. They're rigging a smoke\nchamber for the kids. The head nurse is screaming like a wounded tiger,\nbut she'll feel better with live babies to care for. The only bad thing\nI can see is that it may cut down on her chain smoking. She's been\nworried a lot about infant mortality.\n\n\"And speaking of nurseries--that reminds me. I wanted to ask you\nsomething.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Will you marry me? I've wanted to ask you before, but I didn't dare.\nNow I think you owe me something--your life. And I'd like to take care\nof it from now on.\"\n\n\"Of course I will,\" Mary said. \"And I have reasons, too. If I marry you,\nyou can't possibly do that silly thing you plan.\"\n\n\"What thing?\"\n\n\"Naming the treatment Barton's. It'll have to be Kramer's.\"\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Analog Science Fact and Science\n    Fiction_ February 1962.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
