But the lad was\nplainly oblivious of his immediate surroundings; in spirit he had\nfollowed the leading of his eyes a league or more to the westward, where\na mass of indefinable shadow bulked hugely upon the horizon line.\nIndefinable, in that it was neither forest nor mountain nor yet an\natmospheric illusion produced by the presence of watery vapor. It did\nnot change in density as does the true cloud; for all of its mistiness\nof outline there was an impression of solidity about its deeper shadows,\nsomething that the wind could not lift nor the light pierce. A mystery,\nand the boy devoured it with his eyes, his head bent forward and his\nshoulders held tensely.\n\nThe place was a rocky point of land jutting forth into a reef-strewn\ntideway. The forest came down close to the strip of beach, but there was\ncomparatively little underwood, and the grass, growing up to the very\nroots of the trees, gave to the glade an appearance almost parklike.\nThere was no house in sight, not even the thin, blue curl of a smoking\nhearth to proclaim the neighborhood of man. Yet the sign of human\nhandicraft was not wholly wanting; through the tree trunks, at perhaps a\nhundred yards away, appeared the line of a timber stockade--enormous\npalisades, composed of twelve-foot ash and hickory poles, set in a\ndouble row and bound together by lengths of copper wire. It was to be\nfurther observed that the timbers had been stripped of their bark and\nthe knots smoothed down so as to afford no coigne of vantage to even a\nnaked foot. Add, again, that the poles had been charred and sharpened at\nthe top, and it will be understood that the barrier was a formidable one\nagainst any assault short of artillery.\n\nThere was no beaten road or path near the line of palisades, but,\nfollowing the curving of the shore, a forest track, already green with\nthe young grass that was pushing its way through last year's stubble,\nstretched away to the north and south. It was hardly more than a runway\nfor the deer and wild cattle, but it did not give one the impression of\nhaving been originally plotted out by these creatures, after the\nimmemorial fashion of their kind. An animal does not lay out his road in\nsections of perfectly straight lines connected by mathematical curves,\nneither does he fill up gullies nor cut through hills, when it is so\neasy to go around these obstructions.\n\nThe boy, who sat and dreamed at the water's edge, was in his eighteenth\nyear or thereabouts, slenderly proportioned, and with well-cut features.\nThe delicately moulded chin, the sensitive nostril--these are the signs\nof the poet, the dreamer, rather than of the man of action. And yet the\nface was not altogether deficient in indications of strength. That heavy\nline of eyebrow should mean something, as also the free up-fling of the\nhead when he sat erect; the final impression was of immaturity of\ncharacter rather than of the lack of it. From the merely superficial\nstand-point, it may be added that he had brown eyes and hair (the latter\nbeing cut square across his forehead and falling to his shoulders), a\ngood mouth containing the whitest of teeth, and a naturally light\ncomplexion that was already beginning to accumulate its summer's coat of\ntan.\n\nHe was dressed in a tunic or smock of brown linen, gathered at the waist\nby a belt of greenish leather, with a buckle that shone like gold. His\nknees were bare, but around his legs were wound spiral bands of\nsoft-dressed deer-hide. Buskins, secured by thongs of red leather and\nsoled with moose-hide, to prevent slipping, covered his feet, while his\nhead-dress consisted of a simple band of thin gold, worn fillet-wise.\nThis last, being purely ornamental, was doubtless a token of gentle\nbirth or of an assured social station. A short fur coat, made from the\npelt of the much-prized forest cat, lay in a careless heap at the boy's\nfeet. It had felt comfortable enough in the still keenness of the early\nmorning hour, but now that the sun was well up in the sky it had been\ndiscarded.\n\nIn his belt was stuck a long, double-edged hunting-knife, having its\nwooden handle neatly bound with black waxed thread. A five-foot bow of\nsecond-growth hickory leaned against the log beside him, but it was\nunstrung, and the quiver of arrows, suspended by a strap from his\nshoulders, had been allowed to shift from its proper position so that it\nhung down the middle of his back and was, consequently, out of easy\nhand-reach. But the youth was in no apparent fear of being surprised by\nthe advent of an enemy; certainly he had made no provision against such\na contingency, and the carelessness of his attitude was entirely\nunaffected. It may be remarked that the arrows aforesaid were\niron-tipped instead of being simply fire-hardened, and in the feathering\nof each a single plume of the scarlet tanager had been carefully\ninserted. Presumably, the vermilion feather was the owner's private sign\nof his work as a marksman. So far the lad's dress and accoutrements were\nin entire conformity to the primeval rusticity of his surroundings.\nJudge, then, of the reasonable surprise which the observer might feel at\ndiscovering that the object in the boy's hand was nothing less\nincongruous than a pair of binocular glasses, an exquisitely finished\nexample of the highest art of the optician. One of the eye-piece lenses\nhad been lost or broken, for, as the youth raised the glasses to sweep\nagain the distant sea-line, he covered the left-hand cylinder with a\nflat, oblong object--a printed book. Its title, indeed, could be clearly\nread as, a moment after, it lay partly open upon his knee--_A Child's\nHistory of the United States_--and across the top of the page had been\nneatly written in charcoal ink, \"Constans, Son of Gavan at the Greenwood\nKeep.\"\n\nMechanically, the boy began turning the leaves, stopping finally at a\npage upon which was a picture of the lower part of New York City as seen\nfrom the bay. Long and earnestly he studied it, looking up occasionally\nas though he would find its visible presentment in that dark blur on the\nhorizon line. \"It must be,\" he muttered, with a quick intake of his\nbreath. \"The Forgotten City and Doom the Forbidden--one and the same.\nWell, and what then?\" and again he fell upon his dreaming.\n\nFor the best part of an hour the boy had sat almost motionless, looking\nout across the water. Then, suddenly, he turned his head; his ear had\ncaught a suspicious sound, perhaps the dip of an oar-blade. Thrusting\nthe field-glass and book into his bosom, he drew the bow towards him and\nlistened. All was still, except for the chatter of a blue-jay, and after\na moment or so his attention again relaxed. But his eyes, instead of\nlosing themselves in the distance as before, remained fixed upon the\nsand at his feet. Fortunately so, or he must have failed to notice the\nlong shadow that hung poised for an instant above his right shoulder and\nthen darted downward, menacing, deadly.\n\nAn infinitesimal fraction of a second, yet within that brief space\nConstans had contrived to fling himself, bodily, forward and sideways\nfrom his seat. The spear-shaft grazed his shoulder and the blade buried\nitself in the sand. The treacherous assailant, overbalanced by the force\nof his thrust, toppled over the log and fell heavily, ignominiously, at\nthe boy's side. In the indefinite background some one laughed\nmelodiously.\n\nConstans was up and out upon the forest track before his clumsy opponent\nhad begun to recover his breath. It was almost too easy, and then he all\nbut cannoned plump into a horseman who sat carelessly in his saddle,\nhalf hidden by the bole of a thousand-year oak. The cavalier, gathering\nup his reins, called upon the fugitive to stop, but Constans, without\nonce looking behind, ran on, actuated by the ultimate instinct of a\nhunted animal, zigzagging as much as he dared, and glancing from side to\nside for a way of escape.\n\nBut none offered. On the right ran the wall of the stockade,\nimpenetrable and unscalable, and it was a long two miles to the north\ngate. On the left was the water and behind him the enemy. A few hundred\nyards and he must inevitably be brought to a standstill, breathless and\ndefenceless. Yet he kept on; there was nothing else to do.\n\nThe horseman followed, putting his big blood-bay into a leisurely\nhand-gallop. A sword-thrust would settle the business quite as\neffectually as a shot from his cross-bow, and he would not be obliged to\nrisk the loss of a bolt, a consideration of importance in this latter\nage when good artisan work is scarce and correspondingly precious.\n\nConstans could run, and he was sound of wind and limb. Yet, as the\nthunder of hoofs grew louder, he realized that his chance was of a\ndesperate smallness. If only he could gain a dozen seconds in which to\nstring his bow and fit an arrow.\n\nBut he could not make or save those longed-for moments; already he had\nlost a good part of his original advantage, and the horseman was barely\nsixty yards behind. His head felt as though it were about to split in\ntwo; a cloud, shot with crimson stars, swam before his eyes.\n\nThe track swung suddenly to the right, in a sharp curve, and Constans's\nheart bounded wildly; he had forgotten how close he must be to the\ncrossing of the Swiftwater. Now the rotting and worm-eaten timbers of\nthe open trestle-work were under his feet; mechanically, he avoided the\nnumerous gaps, where a misstep meant destruction, and so at last gained\nthe farther bank and sank down panting on the short, crisp sward.\n\nThe cavalier reined in at the beginning of the trestle; he looked\ndoubtfully at the ford above the bridge; but the Swiftwater was in\nspring flood, and, was the chase worth a wetting?\n\nEvidently not, for, with a shrug of his shoulders, the horseman threw\none leg across the saddle-pommel and sat there, very much at his ease,\nwhile he proceeded to roll himself a cigarette from coarse, black\ntobacco and a leaf of dampened corn-husk.\n\nConstans felt his face flush hotly as he noted the contempt implied in\nhis enemy's well-played indifference. Already he had put his bow in\norder; now he stood up and, with some ostentation, proceeded to fit an\narrow to the string. The cavalier looked at these preparations with\nentire calmness and busied himself again with his flint and steel.\n\n\"It would be murder,\" muttered Constans, irritably, and lowered his\nhand. Then, moved by sudden impulse, he took aim anew and with more than\nordinary care. The arrow sung through the air and transfixed the fleshy\npart of the cavalier's bridle-arm. The horse, whose withers had been\ngrazed by the shaft, started to rear, but his rider neither moved nor\nchanged color. Quieting the frightened animal with a reassuring word,\nhe deftly caught the tinder spark at the tip of his cigarette and drew\nin a deep inhalation of the smoke. Then, with the utmost coolness, he\nproceeded to snap the arrow-shaft in twain and draw out the barb,\nConstans yielding him grudging admiration, for it was all very perfectly\ndone.\n\n\"Here is a man,\" thought Constans, and looked him over carefully.\n\nAnd truly the cavalier made a gallant figure, dressed as he was in the\nbravest raiment that the eyes of Constans had ever yet beheld. For his\nclose-fitting suit was of claret-colored velvet with gilt buttons, while\nhis throat-gear was a wonderfully fine lace jabot, with a great red\njewel fastened in the knot. A soft hat, trimmed with gold lace and an\nostrich-feather, covered his dark curls, while yellow gauntlets and high\nriding-boots of polished leather completed his outward attire. Not an\nunpleasing picture as he sat there in the sunshine astride the big\nblood-bay, but Constans, looking upon him, knew that neither now nor\nhereafter could there be any verity of peace between them. There is such\na thing as hate at first sight even as there is love.\n\nThe horseman had retained the feathered end of the arrow-shaft, and he\nproceeded to examine it with an appearance of polite interest.\n\n\"Your private token, young sir?\" he inquired, indicating the single\nfeather of scarlet. His voice was pitched in an affectedly high key, his\nmanner languidly ceremonious. Constans could only bow stiffly in the\naffirmative.\n\n\"Ah, yes; it is one not to be easily forgotten. I, too, have my\nsign-manual, and I should have been glad to have exchanged with you.\"\n\nAgain Constans bowed. He wanted to say something, but the words would\nnot come. The cavalier smiled.\n\n\"But there may be another opportunity later on,\" he continued. \"At\nleast, we may hope so.\" He bowed, lifting his plumed hat. \"To our future\nacquaintance.\" He turned his horse's head to the southward, and rode\naway at a slow canter without once looking back.\n\nConstans watched the ostrich-crest as it rose and fell, until it was\nlost to sight among the tree-trunks. Then, drawing his belt tight, he\nstarted on a dog-trot in the contrary direction; the barrier, admitting\nhim to the protection of the stockade, was still some distance away, and\nhe must reach it without delay and give the warning. But, even as he\nran, he heard the tolling of a bell; it was the alarm that the Doomsmen\nwere abroad. Now, indeed, he must make haste or he would find the\nbarrier closed against himself.\n\nTen minutes later he stood before the northern entrance of the Greenwood\nKeep. Already the warders were fitting into place the gates of\niron-studded oak, but they recognized the voice of their lord's son and\nallowed him to squeeze his way through. Guyder Touchett, the burly\ncaptain of the watch, clapped him familiarly on the back.\n\n\"Your legs have saved your skin, master. God's life! but you flashed\nthrough the cover like a cock-grouse going down the wind. Yet I trembled\nlest a cross-bow bolt might be following even faster.\"\n\n\"They have come--the Doomsmen?\" panted Constans.\n\n\"Garth, the swineherd, reported their landing at the Golden Cove an\nhour before sunup. Three war-galleys, which means twice that score of\nmen.\"\n\n\"Some mischance of wind or tide,\" said Constans, thoughtfully. \"I\nnoticed that the water in the Gut was rougher than is usual at dawn.\"\n\n\"Like enough,\" assented Touchett. \"These night-birds are not often seen\nin a blue sky, and luckily so, for the safety of your father's ricks and\nbyres. After all, there is no certainty in the matter; Garth is stupid\nenough betimes for one of his own boars, and there was a\nchristening-party at the barracks last night. You know what that\nmeans--the can clinking until the tap runs dry.\"\n\n\"Yet you say he saw----\"\n\nGuyder Touchett shrugged his shoulders. \"Anything you like. When the ale\nis in the eye there are stranger things than gray cats to be discovered\nat the half-dawn. In my opinion, Garth is a fool and a liar.\"\n\n\"And, as usual, your opinion is wrong,\" retorted Constans, \"for the Gray\nMen are really here. But I cannot wait; I must speak with Sir Gavan\nhimself.\"\n\n\"You will find him at the water gate,\" bawled Touchett, as the boy ran\npast him.\n\nConstans sped rapidly up the green slope leading to the house a quarter\nof a mile away. As he ran, he mentally rehearsed the story of his late\nadventure. Surely, now, Sir Gavan would permit him to bear a man's part\nin the impending crisis. Had he not already drawn hostile blood--the\nfirst?\n\nSir Gavan awaited his son at the water gate, his ruddy countenance\nstreaked with an unwonted pallor and his gray eyes dark with trouble.\n\n\"Where is your sister?\" he asked, abruptly, as Constans ran up.\n\nThe boy stared. \"She did not go out with me, sir. Do you mean that\nIssa----\"\n\n\"Hush! or your mother will overhear. Come this way.\" And Sir Gavan\npreceded his son into the guard-room on the left of the vaulted\nentrance, walking heavily, as one who bears an unaccustomed burden upon\nhis shoulders. Yet when he spoke again his voice had its accustomed\nsteadiness.\n\n\"No one has seen her since ten of the sundial. It is now noon, and the\nalarm-bell has been ringing this half-hour.\"\n\nConstans felt something tighten at his own throat. \"You have searched\nthe enclosure?\" he faltered.\n\n\"Every nook and corner,\" returned Sir Gavan. \"Tennant, with a dozen men,\nis now beating the upper plantations.\"\n\nConstans thought guiltily of that cleverly concealed gap in the\npalisades just beyond the intake of the Ochre brook. He and Issa had\nshared it between them as a precious secret, and he had used it this\nvery morning as a short cut to the water-side. Tennant, their elder\nbrother, was not aware of its existence, but then Tennant was a prig,\nand not to be trusted in truly momentous affairs.\n\nThere was his father's wrath. Constans turned sick at the thought of\narousing it. No; he could not tell him.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said, vaguely.\n\nSir Gavan looked at him searchingly, then turned and strode out of the\nroom.\n\nConstans felt his cheeks grow hot. Why had he not told all the truth?\nHe was a coward, a liar, in all but the actual word. He sat down on a\nbench and buried his face in his hands; then the recurring thought of\nIssa and of her peril stung him to his feet. Where had Sir Gavan gone?\n\nConstans made his way, hesitatingly, into the court-yard of the keep. He\nfound it thronged with men, his father's retainers and servants. The\narchers were busy putting new strings to their bows; the spearmen were\ntesting, with grave eagerness, the stout ash of their weapons, or\nperchance whetting an edge on the broad blades. Half a dozen of the\nyounger men were engaged in covering the roof of the main and out\nbuildings with horse-hides soaked in water, as a protection against\nburning arrows; others were driving the protesting cattle into the byres\nand sacking up a quantity of newly threshed grain that lay upon the\nflailing floor; everywhere the noise of shouting men and of hurrying\nfeet.\n\nSir Gavan was not to be seen, and Constans, after inquiring for him\nthrough a fruitless quarter of an hour, entered the main house and\nsought the fighting platform on its roof. Why had no lookout been\nstationed here? Surely an oversight. He gazed eagerly about him.\n\nDirectly to the right of the house lay the home paddock, stretching away\nsome two hundred yards to the edge of a white-birch plantation. The\nOchre brook bounded it on one side, and the current had scoured out for\nitself an ever-deepening channel in the soft, alluvial soil. A clump of\nalders, just bursting into leaf, masked the bed of the stream at one\nparticular point, where the bank rose into a miniature bluff. Constans,\nfrom his elevated position, was enabled to overlook this point, and so\nto make out the figure of a mounted man behind the alder screen, his\nhorse standing belly deep in the water. It was the cavalier of the\nostrich-feathers; and then, through the white trunks of the birches, he\ncaught the flutter of a woman's gown. Constans tried to shout, to call\nout, but the vocal chords refused to relax, the sounds rattled in his\nthroat.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE NIGHT OF THE TERROR\n\n\nThe reader, desiring to inform himself _in extenso_ regarding the\nphysical and social changes that followed the catastrophe by which the\nancient civilization was so suddenly subverted, would do well to consult\nthe final authority upon the subject, the learned Vigilas, author of\n_The Later Cosmos_ (elephant folio edition). But for our present purpose\na brief epitome should suffice. To borrow then, with all due\nacknowledgments, from our admirable historian:\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It was in the later years of the twentieth century that the Great\nChange came; at least, so the traditions agree, and how is a man to know\ncertainly of such things except as he learns them from his father's\nlips? True, the accounts differ, and widely so at times, but that much\nis to be expected--where were there ever two men who heard or saw the\nsame things in the same way? It is human nature that we should color\neven transparent fact with the reflected glow of our passions and\nfancies, and so the distortion becomes inevitable; we should be\nsatisfied if, to-day, we succeed in making out even the broad outlines\nof the picture.\n\n\"It appears tolerably certain that the wreck of the ancient civilization\ntook place about three generations ago, the catastrophe being both\nsudden and overwhelming; moreover, all the authorities agree that only\nan infinitesimal portion of the race escaped, with whole skins, from\nwhat were, in very sooth, cities of destruction. These fortunate ones\nwere naturally the politically powerful and the immensely rich, and they\nowed their safety to the fact that they were able to seize upon the\nshipping in the harbors for their exclusive use. The fugitives sailed\naway, presumably to the southward, and so disappeared from the pages of\nauthentic history. We know nothing for certain; only that they departed,\nand that we saw their faces no more.\n\n\"Let us reconstruct, as best we may, the panorama of those few but awful\ndays. The first rush was naturally to the country, but the crowds,\nchoking the ferry and railway stations, were quickly confronted with the\nterror-stricken thousands of the suburbs, who were flocking to the city\nfor refuge. And all through the dragging hours the same despairing\nreports flowed in from the remoter rural districts; everywhere the\nTerror walked, and men were dying like flies. From ocean to ocean, from\nthe lakes to the gulf, the shadow rushed, and now the whole land lay in\ndarkness.\n\n\"Such was the situation in what was then the United States of America,\nand similar conditions prevailed throughout the habitable world. London\nand Hong-Kong, Vienna and Pekin, Buenos Ayres and Archangel--from every\ndirection came the same inquiry, to every questioner was returned the\nsame answer. It was the end of all things.\n\n\"Coincidently with this great recession of the human tide, occurred the\neclipse of industry, science, and, indeed, every form of thought and\nprogress. The plough rusted in the furrow, the half-formed web dropped\nto pieces in the loom, the very crops stood unharvested in the fields,\nto be finally devoured by the birds and by a horde of rats and mice. Up\nto the last moment there had been confusion and dismay certainly, but\nthe wheels of trade and of the civil administration had continued to\nturn; men had stood at their posts in answer to the call of duty or\nimpressed by the blind instinct of habit. And then, suddenly, the sun\nwent down, only to rise again upon a silent land.\n\n\"The relapse into barbarism was swift. The few who had escaped were\nsegregated from one another in small family groups, each man content\nwith the bare necessities of animal existence and fearing the face of\nthe stranger. Under such circumstances, there could be but little\nneighborly intercourse, and the ancient highways speedily became\novergrown with grass and weeds, or else they were undermined and washed\nout by the winter storms. It was not until the second generation after\nthe Terror that men once more began to draw together, in obedience to\ninherited instincts, and even then the new movement must have been\nlargely brought about through the increasing aggressions of the\nDoomsmen. But of this in another place.\n\n\"It has been asserted that fire played a principal part in the\ndestruction of the ancient cities, and it was at one time supposed that\nthese extensive conflagrations were partly accidental and partly\nattributable to the wide-spread lawlessness that marked the closing\nhours of the greatest drama in all history. But later researches have\nevolved a new theory, and it now seems probable that the torch was\nemployed by the authorities themselves as a final and truly a desperate\nmeasure. An heroic cautery, but, alas, a useless one.\n\n\"The comparative exemption of New York from the universal fate goes to\nsupport rather than to discredit this hypothesis. It escaped the\ndynamite cartridge and the torch simply because in that city no\nrecognized authority remained in power; there was no one to carry out\nthe imperative orders of the federal government. There were, of course,\nmany isolated cases of incendiarism, but the city did not suffer from\nany general and organized conflagration, as was the fate of Philadelphia\nand St. Louis and New Orleans. The destiny of the metropolis was decided\nin a different way; already it had passed into the keeping of the\nDoomsmen.\n\n\"In effect, then, the highly civilized North American continent had\nrelapsed, within the brief period of ninety years, into its primeval\nestate. In every direction stretched an inhospitable wilderness of\nmorass and forest, with a few feeble settlements of the Stockade people\nfringing the principal waterways, and here and there the smoke of an\nencampment of the Painted Men rising in a thin spiral from out of the\nvast ocean of green leaves. To-day the wild boar ranges where once the\ntide of human passion most turbulently flowed, and the poor herdsman,\neating his noonday curds from a wooden bowl, crushes with indifferent\nheel the priceless bit of faience lying half hidden in the rotting\nleaves. Everywhere, the old order changing and disappearing, only to\nrecreate itself in form ever more fantastic and enfeebled, a dead being,\nand yet inextricably bound up with the life of the new age. And over\nall, the shadow of Doom, gigantic, threatening, omnipotent.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE NEW WORLD\n\n\nAgain we make acknowledgment to the \"Laudable\" Vigilas and quote at\nlarge from the luminous pages of _The Later Cosmos_. Now the reader,\nscenting more learned discourse, may meditate upon skipping this\nchapter; nay, will probably do so. Yet, to my thinking, he will act more\nwisely in buckling down to it, seeing that it contains matter of moment\nfor the perfect understanding of the narrative proper. The studying of\nguide-posts is not an amusing occupation, but it is infinitely less\ntedious than to wander around all day in a fog and perhaps miss one's\ndestination altogether.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It is, indeed, a small world as we know it to-day. Our philosophers,\nreconstructing, as best they may, the science of the ancients from the\ntreatises, few and sadly incomplete, that have come down to us, affirm\nthat the earth is an orb and that another continent (perhaps more than\none) lies beyond the rim of the eastern horizon. It may be so, but the\nissue is not of practical importance, seeing that there are none who\ncare to make adventure of the great salty gulf that lies between. And so\nthe sea keeps its mysteries.\n\n\"On the other hand, we count it inadvisable to wander far afield. To\nthe north, to the west, and to the south stretches the unbroken forest,\nand in a few hours a man's legs may easily carry him out of hailing of\nthe voice of his kind. The waterways form the only regular channels for\nsocial and commercial intercourse, and the busybody and gad-about are\nnot regarded with favor by honest people.\n\n\"It appears highly probable that the human race was virtually\nannihilated over the general area of the ancient United States of\nAmerica; it persisted only in a few particularly favored localities and\nthrough accidental circumstances of which we know nothing definite. In\nour own day, the northern, central, and southern group of colonies\nmaintain a system of infrequent intercommunication, and beyond that\ncertain knowledge does not extend. It is possible that mankind may exist\nin a degraded state, in many inaccessible corners of this vast continent\nof ours, but this is only a possibility, concerning which the theories\nof the learned are no more susceptible of proof than are the idle\nspeculations of the vulgar.\n\n\"For convenience, we will accept the popular classification of the human\nrace as it exists to-day--the Painted Men, the House People, and the\nDoomsmen. To take them up in that order.\n\n\"The Painted Men, otherwise the Wood Folk, are the descendants of the\nIndians of old, but the strain is largely mingled with that of the negro\nrace, and, with hardly an exception, it is the weaker qualities both of\nbody and of mind that have been emphasized in the hybrid. From their\nIndian forebears they have preserved the custom of painting their face\nwith crude and hideous pigments upon all occasions of ceremony; hence\ntheir popular designation--the 'Painted Men.'\n\n\"The House People are conveniently subdivided into two classes--the\ntownsmen, or House People proper, and the stockade dwellers,\ncolloquially, the Stockaders.\n\n\"The House People of the walled towns represent as nearly as may be the\nmiddle classes of the ancient civilization. Originally, the family was\nthe political and social unit, just as with the patriarchs of Holy Writ,\nbut within the last generation the community idea has been growing\nrapidly, and there are perhaps a score of towns and villages scattered\nalong the banks of the Greater and Lesser rivers.\n\n\"The Stockaders, reversing the procedure of their kinsmen of the towns,\nlive apart from one another, each proprietor depending wholly upon his\nown resources for sustenance and defence. Some of the larger estates\ncontain several hundred acres enclosed by a strong timber stockade and\notherwise defended against the assaults of enemies. The head of the\nfamily, or clan, as it might more properly be termed, is lord paramount\nwithin his own borders, even possessing the rights of life and death.\nBut this last authority is rarely called in exercise, since these folk\nof the free country-side are naturally wholesome, honest,\ngenerous-hearted men, content to lead a simple life and coveting no\nman's honor or goods. On the other hand, it must be admitted that the\nstockade dweller is both provincial of habit and prejudiced of mind. He\nlooks down upon the townsman as a huckster in private and a shuffler in\npublic life, and this feeling of contemptuous enmity is fully returned\nby the cit, who regards the free proprietor in the light of a boor and a\nbully. Moreover, it rankles in the Houseman's breast that no Stockader\npays a farthing of head-money to the treasure-chest of the Doomsmen. Now\nand then some well-to-do proprietor may suffer loss from cattle thieving\nand rick burning, but as often as not the marauders pay full price for\nall they get. And this leads us to a consideration of the Doomsman\nhimself, that foul excrescence upon our modern body politic.\nFortunately, history here speaks clearly, and we have only to listen to\nher voice.\n\n\"It was a natural procedure, upon the coming of the Terror, to throw\nopen the doors of the jails and other punitive institutions, thereby\ngiving the wretched inmates an equal chance for life. The great mass of\nthese degraded beings gravitated inevitably towards the cities, seeking\nplunder and opportunities for bestial dissipation that even the dread\npresence of the Terror could not restrain. Without hope and without\nfear, they rushed to the vulture's feast; here was wine and gold and\nsoft raiment; let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.\n\n\"It was the ancient city of New York that received the vast bulk of this\narmy of human rats; naturally so, since it was the supreme\ntreasure-house of the western world. In such overwhelming numbers did\nthese vermin come that the civil and military administrations were\nliterally swarmed over. Between two days the outlaws were in complete\npossession, and the small remnant of the decent residents retired\nprecipitately, preferring to meet death under the open sky rather than\nin company with their new masters.\n\n\"The years went on, but the changes that they brought were few. The\ndescendants of the ancient criminals remained in the ruined city, at\nfirst of necessity, afterwards by choice, finding there fuel and shelter\nin abundance besides large stores of non-perishable food supplies. When,\nin the next generation, these provisions became exhausted it was\ninevitable that the refugees should fix covetous eyes upon the\nthreshing-floors and herd-stalls of their rural neighbors. But although\nthe outlaws had continued to gain in numbers, their natural increase was\nnot proportionate to the growing power of their adversaries. Little by\nlittle the Doomsmen began to lose ground; already they had been defeated\nseveral times in pitched battle, and it looked as though the\nhornet's-nest would soon be smoked out.\n\n\"It was at this critical juncture that the infamous personality of Dom\nGillian made itself of commanding account, and thenceforth the balance\nbegan to incline the other way. It was but the weight of one man's hand\nin the scale-pan, yet there are still many of us who remember how heavy\nthat hand could be.\n\n\"Infamous is the adjective deliberately applied, and with reason.\nDominus Gillian, to give him his full name, was a renegade, the unworthy\nson of a distinguished Stockader family. Admittedly a man of fine\nintellect and force, it is equally unquestionable that he was entirely\ndevoid of moral sense. He possessed a genius for organization, and he\nsucceeded in consolidating the unruly Doomsmen into a compact and\ndisciplined body of outlaws. Murder and rapine were quickly reduced to\nexact sciences, and, unfortunately, the House People could not be made\nto see the necessity of united action; the townsman and the stockade\ndweller preferred to contend with each other rather than against the\ncommon enemy. As a consequence, the freebooters had a clear road before\nthem, and so was established that intolerable tyranny under which the\nland still groans. All this occurred upward of sixty years ago.\n\n\"It only remains to add that Dominus, or, more colloquially, Dom\nGillian, still lives, albeit he must be verging upon ninety years of\nage. For many years he has not been seen in the field, and it is even\nasserted that he no longer takes active part in the councils of the\nDoomsmen. Be that as it may, his will still remains dominant to animate\nand direct the malign powers created by his wicked genius. And the evil\nthat men do, doth it not live after them?\n\n\"Such is the world, or, rather, one infinitesimal portion of the cosmos,\nin the year 2015, according to the ancient calendar, or 90 since the\nTerror.\"\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTHE MAN ON HORSEBACK\n\n\nGavan of the Greenwood Keep was a prosperous man according to the\nstandard of these latter days, and his estate was reckoned to be the\nlargest and finest holding in all the western country-side. A man might\nwalk from break of day until darkness and yet not complete the periphery\nof its boundary-lines, but the palisaded portion included only the\narable land and home paddocks and was of comparatively limited extent.\nViewed from a bird's-eye elevation, this stockaded enclosure appeared to\nbe laid out in the shape of a pear, the house being situated near the\nsmall end. The greatest length of the area thus enclosed was a mile and\na half, and it was three-quarters of a mile wide at the big or southern\nside, tapering down to a couple of hundred yards at the northern\nentrance or barrier.\n\nA quarter of a mile back from the north gate stood the keep, not one\ndistinct building, but rather several, built in the form of a hollow\nsquare and consolidated for mutual protection. The principal entrance,\nthe one at the northern end, was called the water gate, for it should be\nexplained that the keep stood on the bank of the Ochre brook and access\nwas only possible by means of a drawbridge. Some day Sir Gavan intended\nto turn the course of the stream so as to carry it around the keep and\nthereby secure the protection of a continuous moat. But hitherto other\nduties had seemed more pressing, and the plan was still in abeyance.\n\nEntering through the covered way of the water gate, with guard-room and\nbailiff's office to the right and left, one found himself in the\ncourt-yard, some fifty yards in the square. On the right were the\ncow-barns, horse-stalls, granaries, tool-houses, and store-buildings,\nwhile the dwelling proper, known as the Great House, occupied the entire\nleft of the square, the kitchens and other offices adjoining the\nretainers' quarters on the south. An enormous hall, running clear to the\nroof, took up the central portion of the house, staircases and galleries\naffording access to the store and sleeping-rooms on the second and attic\nstories. The roof proper was surmounted by a para-petted and loop-holed\nstructure called the fighting platform, and it was thither that Constans\nhad repaired upon receiving the startling intelligence of his sister's\ndisappearance. Let us rejoin him there.\n\nIn the leisurely moving figure glimpsed through the birches, Constans\nhad instantly recognized Issa. Plainly she had been out flower-hunting;\nwith the aid of his binoculars he could determine that she carried a\nbunch of the delicate pink-and-white blossoms that we call May-bloom.\nShe was directing her steps straight for the house, but either she was\nunaccountably deaf to the continuous clanging of the alarm-bell or,\nstill more strangely, unaware of its significance; she walked as though\nin a reverie, slowly and with her head bent forward. Thunder of God! it\nwas a trap, and the foolish girl would not see. Unquestionably, the\nDoomsmen had forced the stockade at some distant point and were even now\nin ambush about the keep. But Constans, for all his keenness of vision\nand the assistance of his glass, could discover nothing to indicate the\npresence of any considerable body of men. There was no one in actual\nsight save he who sat upon his blood-bay steed, girth deep in the Ochre\nbrook under shadow of the alders. Only one, but that one!\n\nConstans found himself in the court-yard; how he scarcely knew. The\nwater gate still stood open with the drawbridge lowered, but both could\nbe easily secured within a few seconds should the enemy venture upon any\nopen demonstration. Sir Gavan stood in the covered way talking anxiously\nwith his eldest son Tennant, who had just returned from an unsuccessful\nsearch of the upper orchard.\n\nConstans, in his confusion of mind, did not notice his father and\nbrother; he ran across the court-yard to the horse-boxes. His black mare\nNight whickered upon recognizing her master, and tried to rub her muzzle\nagainst his cheek as he fumbled with the throat-latch of the bridle. An\ninstant longer, to lead out the mare and vault upon her back, and he was\nclattering through the court-yard and covered way.\n\nUpon reaching the open Constans saw that the situation had developed\ninto a crisis. The cavalier of the ostrich-feather had forced his horse\nup the steep bank of the Ochre brook and was riding slowly towards the\ngirl, who stood motionless, realizing her perilous position, but unable\nfor the moment to cope with it. She half turned, as though to seek again\nthe shelter of the birchen copse; then, clutching at her impeding\nskirts, she ran in the direction of the keep. He of the ostrich-plume\nspurred to the gallop; inevitably their paths must intersect a few yards\nfarther on.\n\nFrom behind came the noise of men shouting and the thud of quarrels\nimpinging upon stout oak; the Doomsmen, hitherto in hiding, were making\na diversion, in answer, doubtless, to a signal from their leader. A\nhundred gray-garbed men showed themselves in the open, coming from the\nshelter of the fir plantation back of the rickyards; they ran towards\nthe open water gate, exposing themselves recklessly in their eagerness\nto reach it.\n\nBut the defenders were not to be surprised so easily, and Constans,\nglancing backward, saw that the drawbridge was already in the air and\nthe gate closed. The outlaws, realizing that the surprise was a failure,\nand unwilling to brave the arrows sent whistling about their ears from\nthe fighting platforms of the keep, fell back in some disorder. At the\nsame moment a solitary figure appeared, emerging as though by magic from\nthe solid wall of the keep--Sir Gavan himself, a father forgetful of all\nelse but the peril of his children. He must have used the \"Rat's-Hole\"\nfor egress; he hurried down the green slope, calling his daughter by\nname. All this Constans saw in that swift backward glance. Well, there\nwas but one thing that he could do.\n\nAnd Night knew it, too; brave little Night, how cleverly you forced\nyourself under the towering bulk of that brute of a blood-bay! A thunder\nof hoofs and they were in touch; Constans felt himself hurled into\nspace; the bridle-reins of tough plaited leather were torn from his\nhands; Night and he were down.\n\nThe dust cloud cleared and the boy struggled up, although his head was\nstill spinning from the shock of the encounter. Ten yards away lay the\nblack mare with a broken foreleg. She was trying to rise, her eyes\nglazed with pain and her flanks heaving horribly.\n\nThe blood-bay had kept his feet and his master his saddle--a hardy pair,\nthese two. But the desperate expedient had proved successful in that\nIssa was safe. Already Sir Gavan had her in his arms, and before the\nhorseman had fully found himself the fugitives were under the shadow of\nthe keep's walls.\n\nThe question of his own danger did not immediately concern Constans; he\nhad no eyes for anything but Night lying there in her agony. His father\nhad given him the horse when she was a foal of a week old, and Constans\nhad broken and trained her himself. Well, she had served him faithfully,\nand in return he would show her the last mercy. His knife-sheath hung\nfrom his girdle; he drew out the blade and drove it home just behind the\nglossy black shoulder. Night shuddered and lay still. The knife had\nsunken deep, and Constans had to exert all his strength to withdraw it.\nThe bare point of a rapier touched him meaningly on the arm; he stood up\nand faced his enemy.\n\nThe man on horseback laughed softly. \"Oho, my young cockerel, it was but\na touch of the gaff, and now that you are ready is reason sufficient why\nI should prefer to wait. But that neither of us may forget--\" He bent\ndown and caught Constans by the shoulders, turning him around and\nforcing him backward until his head rested against the blood-bay's\nwithers. Two slashes of his hunting-knife and a tiny, triangular nick\nappeared on the upper part of the lad's right ear.\n\n\"That is my sign-manual of which I spoke to you an hour or more ago. It\nis Quinton Edge's mark, as all men know, and it brands whatever bears it\nas Quinton Edge's property. Some day I may deem it worth while to claim\nmy own; until then you can be my caretaker, my tenant. What! no answer?\nAnd yet it is a generous offer, I think, considering how sore my arm has\ngrown and how impertinently you behaved just now in interfering between\nme and a lady. Light of God! but she is a bewitching bundle of\nfemineity. But twice, boy, have I seen her; hardly a dozen words have\npassed----\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly and gazed hard at Constans. Then slowly:\n\n\"Your sister, I take it; there is the same straight line of eyebrow. No\nanswer again? Well, we will pass it over for the nonce; you have still\nmany things to learn, and, chiefly, to becomingly order body and soul in\nthe presence of your lord. After all, it pleases me better to have the\nlast word from the lady's own lips; she had been most discourteously\ntreated, and I would fain be shriven. Until we meet again, then.\"\n\nThe cavalier put spur to the blood-bay's flank and rode straight for the\nGreat House. The boy stood staring after him; he did not notice the\ntrickle of blood from the cut in his ear; he was not even conscious that\nhe was still in life. He remembered only the unforgivable affront which\nthis man had put upon him, the mark which was the infamous badge of the\nbondman, the slave. Quinton Edge! Ah, yes; he would remember that face\nand name.\n\nThe Doomsman had ridden in cool defiance up to the very walls of the\nkeep. It would have been an easy matter for one of the garrison to have\nbored his gay jacket through with a feathered shaft, and for a moment\nConstans trembled, fearing lest some overzealous partisan should thus\nrob him of his future vengeance. But the very audacity of the man proved\nthe saving of his skin. They were brave men who manned the fighting\nplatforms of the Greenwood Keep, and they could not bring themselves to\nset upon naked courage.\n\nConstans fancied that the man spoke to some one who stood hidden in the\ndeep embrasure of a window, but it was too far to either see or hear.\nThen it seemed that a small object fell lightly from the window-sill.\nThe Doomsman caught it dexterously and fastened it on his breast.\nAnother low bow and, wheeling his horse, he dashed down the slope.\nConstans ran blindly to meet him; why, he did not know. He who named\nhimself Quinton Edge swerved slightly in his course so as to pass within\narm's-length, calling out as he did so:\n\n\"Gage of battle and gage of love; a fortunate day for me. Believe me\nthat at some future time I shall answer for them both.\"\n\nIt was a sprig of the May-bloom that the cavalier wore in his\nbutton-hole; Constans had only time to recognize it when the blood-bay\nbroke into full gallop. The lad flung himself at full length upon the\nturf, face downward, and lay there motionless.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nTHE RAT'S-HOLE\n\n\nIt was a warm, cloudy night some two weeks later, and Constans sat in\nthe great hall of the keep, listlessly regarding the preparations that\nwere being made for the evening meal. Six or seven of the house-servants\nwere bustling to and from the buttery laden with flagons and dishes,\nwhich they deposited with a vast amount of noise and confusion upon the\ntables. These latter were of the most primitive construction, nothing\nmore than puncheons smoothed down with the adze and supported by wooden\ntrestles.\n\nThe main table ran nearly the full length of the hall, and was intended\nto accommodate the men-at-arms and the superior servants, together with\nsuch strangers of low degree as might chance to be present. The\nfurniture was of the rudest pattern--platters of bass and white wood,\nwhich were daily scoured with sand to keep them clean and sweet,\nearthenware pitchers of a bricklike hue, drinking-cups of pewter and\nleather, and clumsy iron forks. There was no provision of cutlery;\nevidently the guests were expected to use their hunting-knives and\ndaggers for the dismemberment of the viands.\n\nAt the upper or dais end of the hall there was a second table, placed at\nright angles to the long one and elevated above it by the height of the\nsuperior flooring upon which it stood. This principal board was, of\ncourse, for the exclusive use of the family and distinguished guests,\nand from the circumstance of its being raised above the main level the\nmaster could command an unobstructed view of the entire household in the\nevent of any overt disorder or indecorum.\n\nThe viands were quite in keeping with the simplicity of the table-gear.\nHuge chines of beef and mutton, with spare-rib and fowl in apparently\nunlimited quantity, formed the staple of the repast, and were reinforced\nby vast bowls of the commoner garden vegetables and by bread made of\nunbolted flour. Sweetmeats were scarce, for the products of the\nsugarcane are difficult to procure in these northern latitudes. Maple\nsugar and honey serve as the ordinary substitutes, and even these are\nregarded as luxuries, since maple-trees are few in number and\nbee-keeping is but little practised. Finally, there were the drinkables,\nthese including hard cider and a thin, acid wine made from the wild\ngrape.\n\nAnnoyed by the clatter of the dishes and the half-whispered conversation\nof the domestics, Constans rose and walked to the dais end of the hall,\nwhere his mother and sister were seated, engaged in the agreeable\noccupation of inspecting the contents of a peddler's pack. It was an\nimposing array to the eye, and the chapman, kneeling on the floor close\nby Issa's stool, kept handing up one article after another for closer\nexamination. The stuff seemed worthless enough to Constans--trumpery\npieces of quartz crystal set in copper and debased silver, rings and\nbangles of a hue unmistakably brassy, hair ribbons, parti-colored dress\ngoods, pins, needles, and a miscellaneous assortment of useless\ntrinkets. Constans was genuinely astonished that Issa, who had been\nhitherto something of a good-fellow, should seem interested in such\nrubbish; but then women were all alike when it was a question of pretty\nthings to buy. He looked sharply at the peddler, but the latter appeared\ncommonplace enough, a man of forty or thereabouts, and dressed in the\nlooped-up gray gaberdine peculiar to the guild of itinerant chapmen.\nPossibly he was bald, for he wore a close-fitting skull-cap; his beard,\nhowever, was luxuriant and effectually hid the contour of the lower half\nof his face. Constans stood by frowning lightly, but he had no\nreasonable pretext for interfering with his sister's amusement, and in\nthe feminine catalogue of diversions the peddler's infrequent visit held\na prominent place.\n\nThe major-domo, wearing a silver chain about his neck by virtue of his\noffice, advanced to his mistress's chair and announced that the meal was\nready for serving. The Lady Rayne nodded, a brazen gong sounded, the big\nfolding-doors at the south end were thrown open, and the hall was\nquickly filled with the customary throng of retainers and hangers-on.\nBut all remained standing in silence until the master and mistress had\ntaken their places. Sir Gavan entered from his workshop, and, offering\nhis hand to his wife, led her ceremoniously to her seat, Issa and\nConstans following.\n\nTo Constans's indignant amazement the peddler stepped forward, as though\nto take the vacant seat alongside of Issa. But before Constans could\nmove or speak the chapman appeared to recognize the impropriety of\nwhich he had been so nearly guilty; with a profound genuflection, he\nwithdrew from the dais and found a place at the lower table. The\nincident had been so momentary that it had passed entirely unnoticed by\nhis father and the Lady Rayne; Constans could not even be sure that Issa\nhad understood, and certainly she gave no sign of discomposure.\n\n\"What presumption!\" muttered Constans, under his breath. \"These fellows\nare becoming more insufferable every day, and my father sees nothing.\"\nConstans resolved that the man should be packed off immediately upon the\nconclusion of the meal. He could easily persuade Sir Gavan that the\nfellow had none too honest a look, while his wares were assuredly the\ncheapest trash. He must be got rid of before the women had been beguiled\ninto spending all their pin-money.\n\nThe repast dragged out to its end, and the women withdrew to the upper\nend of the hall, comparative privacy being secured by large leather\nscreens set up along the edge of the dais. The men remained at the table\nfor deeper potations and the smoking of rank black kinnectikut tobacco in\nhuge wooden pipes.\n\nA heavy thunderstorm, the first of the season, had come up, and Constans\nrecognized, to his vexation, that he would have no decent excuse for\nturning the peddler out-of-doors. So he kept his seat at the table in\nsulky silence, watching the man closely, and ready to note anything of\nfurther suspicion in his actions and bearing. But he had his trouble for\nhis pains, for the fellow was the itinerant chapman to the life, even to\nthe stock of gross stories with which he kept his bucolic audience in an\nuninterrupted guffaw. Pah! would Sir Gavan never finish his second pipe\nand give the signal to rise?\n\nThe storm had turned into a heavy downpour, and the peddler was\nconsequently sure of his night's lodging. He had been summoned again to\nthe presence of the ladies, and, as before, Constans stood aloof and\nwondered irritably how his fastidious sister could find aught in common\nwith this wayside huckster. She was talking to him now with an animation\nrare with her, her checks flushed and her eyes glowing.\n\n\"And you have been in Doom--in the city itself?\" she asked,\nincredulously.\n\n\"Yes, gracious lady; and not once, but a score of times. The brocades\nthat I promised to show you after supper will be my witness. And there\nare some superlative satin and silk lengths which my Lady Rayne wished\nparticularly to see. Will you allow me, then?\"\n\nThe peddler, opening an inner compartment of his pack, drew out several\npieces of stuff wrapped up in brown linen. Removing the covering, he\nspread the goods upon the rug before the ladies, holding up each\nseparate piece to the light and expatiating upon its merits in the\napproved fashion of the shopman. The two women gave a little gasp of\nastonishment; never had they seen such wondrous beauty of color and\nfinish; their little market-town of Croye held nothing to compare to\nthis.\n\n\"I must send for Meta to advise me,\" said the Lady Rayne, glancing\nfondly from one rich fabric to another. \"She ought to know good silk\nwhen she sees it, after living so long in Croye; and you, Issa, seem\nstrangely indifferent to-night. You hardly looked at this piece of\nbrocade.\"\n\nMeta, the Lady Rayne's bedwoman, speedily appeared, and mistress and\nmaid fell into earnest converse. Issa, as in duty bound, listened; then\nher attention seemed to flag again. She bent over the open pack and\npicked up a chain of filigree work. It was beautifully fashioned and\nlooked like gold.\n\n\"It is gold,\" said the chapman, answering the question in her eyes. \"The\npure gold of the ancients; you never see that pale yellow nowadays. Ah,\nyes, a pretty trinket to have brought from the heart of Doom for the\ndelight of a fair woman's eyes, and well worth its price of a man's\nlife. But, then, fortune was kind, and I did not have to pay.\"\n\n\"Tell me about it,\" said the girl, beseechingly, and her breath came\nshort and hot.\n\nWhereupon the chapman drew a little nearer and began a wondrous tale of\na secret visit that he had lately made to Doom, the Forbidden; of how he\nhad crossed the river on a raft, the moon being in its dark quarter; of\nhis landing upon a shaking wharf, where each foot-fall left a print of\nphosphorescent fire on the rotting planks; then of the marvels that he\nhad seen there--vast warehouses covering whole acres of ground and\nfilled with incalculable store of goods; lofty buildings, whose\nchimney-pots were in the clouds; palaces of sculptured stone, now empty\nand despoiled, the habitation of foxes and unclean nocturnal creatures.\n\nThen again of hidden treasure, heaps and heaps of yellow gold; of the\nfierce Doomsmen who guarded it so well; of pitfalls and gins and siren\nvoices that lured the soul astray; of ghastly shapes that crept along\nthe crumbling walls; of mystery in every sound and shadow; of\ntreacheries and alarms and the ever present terror of death--a tale of\namazing wonder, at which the blood ran alternately warm and cold and the\nheart fluttered with a certain fearful joy.\n\nHow the maid hung upon the word, her little breasts heaving and her lips\nparted! \"You have seen all these things?\" she panted. \"How wonderful!\nAnd you were not afraid? That was like a man--to be brave----\" She\nblushed deeply, stammered, and turned to the neglected brocades.\nConstans, standing close at hand, was moved to new anger. The\nimpertinent, how dared he! Yet he had listened himself, and in spite of\nhimself, for assuredly the fellow talked well.\n\nThe evening was now well advanced and the customary hour of retirement\nwas at hand. It was still raining, but Guyder Touchett, who came in\ndripping from his nightly task of posting the watch, remarked that the\nwind was changing and that it was likely to clear when the moon rose. Of\ncourse the peddler would now spend the night at the keep, and at his own\nrequest he was allowed to remain in the hall, a straw pallet being\nbrought in for his accommodation.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The Rat's-Hole!\"\n\nConstans repeated the words half aloud, holding the paper close to the\nguttering candle. It was but a tiny scrap, scarce large enough for the\nwriting that it held. But paper of any kind is rare in these days, and\nso the gleam of white had caught his eye as he went up-stairs to his\nsleeping apartment. The handwriting was unfamiliar, and besides it was\nin back-hand, and it may be disguised as well; he was hardly an expert\nin such fine distinctions. But it was plainly a message, and its\npossible import startled him. For the Rat's-Hole was the secret exit\nthat existed behind the jamb of the fireplace at the upper end of the\nhall. So cunningly had the panelled door been joinered into the\nwainscoting that a man might search for hours and yet not discover the\nspring that threw it open. Furthermore, the wainscoting was but a screen\nfor the real door of iron-bound oak giving passage directly through the\nouter wall of the keep to the open country. A jealously guarded secret,\nthis matter of the Rat's-Hole, and supposed to be known only to the\nmaster of the household and his immediate family. Even among them its\nexistence was never referred to in ordinary conversation, while its\nactual use was restricted to the gravest of emergencies.\n\n\"The Rat's-Hole!\" A message, an agreement, an appointment? By whose hand\nhad these words been written? For whose eye had they been intended?\n\nIt would have been the wiser course to have communicated at once with\nSir Gavan, but the latter, feeling somewhat indisposed, had retired\nearly, and Constans hesitated to disturb him. Moreover, the boy stood in\nawe of his father, and of late a feeling of estrangement had been\ngrowing up between them. To Sir Gavan, Constans, with his dreamy,\ninactive nature, was a keen disappointment--so different from his\nbrother Tennant. And Constans felt that his father did not understand\nhim nor, indeed, cared to do so. Latterly, they had gone their own ways,\nand now at this perplexing juncture Constans could not bring himself to\ntake his father into his confidence.\n\nWhen, a few moments later, the lights had been formally extinguished for\nthe night, Constans made his way back to the hall; he had to pass close\nby the pallet occupied by the peddler, and he paused an instant to\nlisten to his deep and measured breathing. Surely the man slept.\n\nEven in the dark Constans knew how to put his hand on the spring in the\nwainscoting, and it yielded to his touch. It was discomposing to find\nthe key of the real door standing, ready for turning, in the lock. In\ntheory, the key was never out of the master's immediate possession. An\noversight, then? Constans's mind reverted to the one occasion in his\nremembrance on which the Rat's-Hole had been used, that day a fortnight\nback, when his sister Issa came out of the birch-copse, with her hands\nfull of May-bloom and Quinton Edge had waited under cover of the alders.\nIt was possible; his father might have forgotten. And yet----\n\nConstans took the key and slipped it into the bosom of his doublet. Then\nclosing the secret door in the wainscoting, he drew one of the big\nleather screens into convenient position and crouched down behind it.\nThe dying fire gave out a flickering and uncertain light; he watched the\ngrotesque procession of the shadows on the opposite wall until his eyes\ngrew heavy. The odor of a smouldering bough of balsam-fir hung in the\nair--warm, spicy, soporific. He slept.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nTROY TOWN\n\n\nConstans awoke just as the footsteps died away; he listened, but again\nthe stillness was profound. He felt his way to the secret door; the\nwainscot screen stood ajar. It was plain that some one had come to the\nRat's-Hole only to discover that the key of the outside door was\nmissing. Constans realized that he, too, had missed something--his\nchance to get to the bottom of the mystery. Shame on such a sentinel!\n\nWithout any definite plan of action, Constans made his way to the lower\nhall. The moonbeams were pouring a flood of light through the east\nwindows and he could see plainly. The peddler's couch was empty, save\nfor his gabardine of gray and the false hair that had served him for a\nbeard. There were two figures dimly visible in the obscurity of the\nvaulted entrance to the water gate. They were working at the clumsy\nfastenings of the doors. As Constans ran up he recognized his sister\nIssa and the man who called himself Quinton Edge.\n\nWithout a word Constans seized the girl by the arm and swung her behind\nhim. He struck at the Doomsman with his hunting-knife, but the latter\ncaught his wrist with the grip of a wolf-trap. Yet even at that moment\nof stress Quinton Edge's voice preserved its soft, mincing inflections;\nthe man wore his irritating affectations of speech as jauntily as he did\nthe ostrich plumes in his cap.\n\n\"A brave ruffling of feathers--but gently, gently boy, you are\nfrightening the lady. She goes with me of her full consent. Is it not\nso, sweetheart?\"\n\n\"You lie!\" said the boy, thickly.\n\nThe man laughed. \"I tell you,\" he went on, \"that the girl is mine by her\nown choice, and you have only to stand aside quietly to save the house\nand your own skin. But softly now; you are tearing the lace of my\nsleeve. A plague on your clumsy fingers!\"\n\nWith a wrench Constans twisted himself free and turned to face his\nsister. \"Issa!\" he implored.\n\nBut she, with eyes like rain-washed stars, only looked beyond him to\nwhere Quinton Edge stood, softly smiling and holding out his womanish\nwhite hands. She would have rejoined him, but once again Constans forced\nher back. The dangling rope of the alarm-bell grazed his hand; he\nclutched at it, and a clang re-echoed through the court-yard, rousing\nthe recreant warders from their slumbers. In that same instant Quinton\nEdge blew his whistle.\n\nThe Doomsmen must have already crossed the moat and been close up to the\nwater gate, for the response to their leader's call was immediate.\nQuinton Edge had just time to remove the last of the bars securing the\nbarrier when the night-watch streamed out tumultuously from their\nquarters under the arch, and he was obliged to retreat into the\ncourt-yard. But already the outlaws had forced apart the wooden leaves\nof the water gate; now they filled the vaulted passageway, and by sheer\nimpact of superior weight began to drive back the bewildered and\ndisorganized defenders. Friend and foe together, the mass surged into\nthe quadrangle, a blind, indefinite cluster of struggling men, like to a\nswarm of hiving bees.\n\nThe storm had blown over, but the moon was every now and then obscured\nby masses of scurrying cloud-wrack, and in these periods of\nsemi-darkness Doomsman and Stockader were hardly to be told apart. So\nclosely packed was the scrimmage that the use of any missile weapon was\nimpossible. The dagger and the night-stick (the latter a stout truncheon\nweighted with lead) were doing the work, and effectively, too. And in\nthat press a man might be struck and die upon his feet, the corpse being\nstayed from falling through its juxtaposition to the bodies of the\nliving.\n\nThe men of the keep, now that they had recovered from their first\ndiscomfiture, rallied manfully. So stubborn and bitter raged the\nstruggle that there was not a sound to be heard outside the noise of\nscuffling feet and the thud of blows. A man when hard beset for his life\nhas no breath to spare for either oath of despair or shout of triumph.\nBut not for long were the scales to swing so evenly; presently the ranks\nof the Stockaders yielded again to the pressure and broke into separate\ngroups. Then were to be heard the groans of the wounded and dying; then\nfor the first time the yell of the Doomsmen broke forth, ear-piercing in\nits exultancy.\n\nConstans had managed to reach the shelter of the Great House, half\ndragging, half carrying the fainting form of his sister. Already Sir\nGavan, with Tennant and the house-servants, were under arms and making\nwhat preparations they could for the final stand. A hopeless task it\nseemed, for the outlaws were now in full possession of the rest of the\nkeep. The retainers occupying the general quarters in the south barracks\nhad fallen easy victims. Surprised, out-numbered, and poorly armed, they\nhad been quickly cut down as they reached the court-yard, and active\nresistance to the invaders was at an end.\n\nNow the attack was turned directly upon the entrance to the Great House,\nand Sir Gavan, with his handful of followers, waited on the threshold\nfor the inevitable issue. Already the ponderous door of iron-banded oak\nwas groaning and splintering under the hail of blows. And in the\nforefront, with a laugh upon his lips, hewed Quinton Edge.\n\nThe barrier was down at last and the wolves were free to fall upon their\nquarry. A score of men, all told, against a hundred; the outcome was\nhardly doubtful. Yet it was not Gavan of the Greenwood Keep who held up\nhis hand in sign of parley, but the Doomsman, Quinton Edge.\n\n\"The maiden Issa,\" he said, speaking with a smooth insolence that made\nConstans set his teeth. \"Give her safely to my hand and your goods and\nyour lives shall go free of further damage. A cheap bargain; but speak\nquickly, old man, these hounds of mine are not to be held in leash for\nlong.\"\n\nThe partisans on either side had fallen back, leaving the two leaders\nface to face. Sir Gavan plucked twice at his throat, where the veins\nstood out like cords, constricting the vocal passages so that he\nstuttered thickly as he spoke.\n\n\"This--this gallows-scape!\" he stammered. \"This burner of peasants'\nhayricks, this pitiful plunderer of hen-roosts and cattle byres! If it\nwere a man, now--to nail the insult to his lips----\"\n\n\"We lose time,\" interrupted the Doomsman. \"I have named my price.\"\n\n\"The price--ah, yes, the price. Tennant, Constans, you heard what he\nsaid. But where is my child? Let the girl stand forth; she is her\nfather's daughter, and she shall answer for herself.\"\n\n\"I will abide by it,\" said Quinton Edge, with cool confidence.\n\nThe half-circle opened and Issa stood before them; a mere child she\nlooked in her simple slip of white and with her fair hair all unbound. A\nvague terror seized upon Sir Gavan. What was this question that he was\nabout to ask of his daughter? Could there be other than the one answer?\nHow quietly she stood there and waited. Yes, and they were all waiting\nupon him; he must speak.\n\n\"Issa!\"\n\nIt seemed to him that he had shouted aloud; then he realized that he had\nnot spoken at all. \"Issa!\" he said, again, and she turned towards him.\n\n\"This man; he is not known to you. How could it be?\"\n\n\"Yet it is the truth, my father,\" answered the girl, steadily. \"It is\njust a month ago that chance set us face to face--one day when I rode\nalone in the green drive.\"\n\n\"And thereafter?\"\n\n\"Once he came to the walled garden, adventuring the thousand chances of\ndiscovery. Yet how he managed to cross the stockade-line I know not,\nfor I was frightened, and begged him to leave me. And this he did most\ncourteously, only swearing that he would again return.\"\n\n\"The third time?\"\n\n\"That was the day--the day of the first May-bloom--the Ochre brook and\nthe Doomsmen----\" The girl's voice faltered.\n\n\"Yet never a word to me or to your mother?\"\n\n\"It was not my secret,\" she answered, bravely; and upon that Quinton\nEdge himself took up the word.\n\n\"The blame is mine, since I used the peril in which I stood to set a\nseal upon her lips. A true and loyal maid is your daughter, and it was\nonly after she had twice said me nay that I resolved to take without the\nasking. So I came that day which we both remember, and waited under the\nalder bushes, and once again I missed my cast. Yet was the quest not\naltogether fruitless, for I carried away this token from my lady's\nhostile garden.\"\n\nHe drew a faded spray of the May-bloom from his doublet and touched it\nlightly to his lips.\n\n\"What gentleman could refuse to redeem so dear a pledge? You have seen\nhow I took head in hand and sat me down under your own roof-tree, my\ngood Gavan of the keep. Faith, it was an even chance on which side the\nplatter would fall, but this time the luck was mine. We should have been\nleagues away in the sun's eye by now, only that a peevish boy would have\nhis way.\"\n\n\"And this--this is also true?\" said Sir Gavan, and it seemed that the\npreceding silence had been very long.\n\n\"It is true.\" She had answered quietly, almost mechanically, but the\nheart of the Lady Rayne thrilled to the new note in her child's voice.\n\n\"Issa!\" she cried, softly, and fell to weeping, not as a mother for her\ndaughter but as one woman who sorrows for another.\n\n\"Issa!\" she said, again, but neither then nor thereafter did the girl\nvouchsafe her mother look or word, all her soul seeming to hang upon the\nwill of the man who had brought this woe upon her house. There was no\nneed for word to pass; reading the command in her lover's eyes, she\nslipped from her mother's detaining clasp and placed her hand in his.\nNow, Issa was exceeding fair to look upon, and Quinton Edge's blood\nstirred hotly within him. And so for once he lost his head and did a\nfoolish thing (only that no woman would agree that it was foolish), for\nthere, in the presence of all, he quickly drew her face to his and\nkissed her on the lips. Then turning to his men, he made as though to\nsend them from the house.\n\nBut it was not to be. A keen-pointed, heavy throwing-knife hung at Sir\nGavan's side. Without a word he snatched it from the sheath, poised and\nflung it with all his force at his enemy's heart, a master throw and\nexecuted like a flash of light. Issa felt rather than saw the coming of\nthe missile, and with an instinctive movement contrived to interpose her\nown delicate body. The steel bit deep into the white flesh, and with a\nlittle, shuddering cry the girl sank to the floor; out leaped Quinton\nEdge's sword. Constans, supporting his mother, felt her hand grow cold\nin his. He laid her gently down upon a convenient settle and thanked God\nthat she, too, was safe.\n\nIt seemed to Constans that he was wandering in a bristling thicket of\nsteel points; thunderous crashes re-echoed in his ears; the red light\nfrom the burning building eddied about his feet, a sea of blood and\nflame. His father and Tennant were down, never to rise again; a few\npaces in front of him Guyder Touchett headed a little knot of the\ndefenders, swearing furiously as he hewed and hacked. A half-dozen\nagainst ten times their number; the issue could not be doubtful. Even as\nhe gazed, two of the six sunk to their knees and then fell face\ndownward, a dreadful sign that even a child might understand.\n\nNow, Guyder Touchett stood alone, and about him a snarling pack of Dom\nGillian's wolves, waiting cautiously upon one another, for the Stockader\nhad a long sword-arm. Thereupon a man broke out of the press, signing\nthe prudent ones to fall back. It was Quinton Edge, and, as ever, he was\nlaughing, only that now his laughter sounded like to a bell that has\ncracked in the ringing. The swords clashed together; then the Doomsman\ndropped his point.\n\n\"You are too good a man for crows' meat,\" he said, shortly. \"Stand clear\nand save your ears; my business is with the white-faced boy behind you.\"\n\nBut Guyder Touchett, ruddy, full-bodied, and loving his life as well as\nany man, only girded at him, saying:\n\n\"Is there, then, a deeper hell than this? I follow where my master has\ngone, and you, my lord, shall show me the way.\"\n\n\"The more fool you,\" quoth Quinton Edge, and drove at him.\n\n[Illustration: \"OUT LEAPED QUINTON EDGE'S SWORD\"]\n\nAgain the blades engaged, and a great fear suddenly tightened at the\nboy's heart. His champion had been exhausted by his previous efforts,\nand now his strength was going fast. Constans saw Touchett stagger and\nQuinton Edge preparing for a final stroke; he turned and ran for the\nupper end of the hall--the Rat's-Hole.\n\nThe key was still in his bosom, and in a few seconds he had passed the\npostern, closing and locking it behind him. Five minutes' hard running\nand he was free of the stockade and at the summit of a hill that\ncommanded the scene which he had just left. The conflagration was\nprogressing with astonishing rapidity; already the Great House itself\nwas in flames, and dark figures could be seen issuing from the water\ngate. There! the red cock was crowing from the top of the bell-tower,\nand now the whole court-yard was a furnace of fire. A spark carried by\nthe wind fell on his naked shoulder, where it bit like a fiery serpent.\nYet he scarcely felt the smart; he stood motionless, looking upon the\nwreck of his little world, the only one that he had ever known.\n\n\"So in the end he made me a coward as well,\" said the boy, speaking\nsoftly to himself. \"Is it that a slave must be a slave--always?\"\n\nHe drew a long breath. \"No, not always. But in the mean time I am to go\non living and bearing everywhere his mark--Quinton Edge's mark. Well, I\nwill begin by learning how to wait.\"\n\nHe stood irresolute for a moment longer, gazing at the scene of the\nnight's tragedy as though to impress it indelibly upon his memory. Then\nturning his back to the east, where the faint saffron of early dawn was\nnow showing, he started off on a long, swinging trot that speedily\ncarried him down the slope and into the deeper shadow of the wood\nbeyond.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nTHE BREAD OF AFFLICTION\n\n\nTwo miles from the keep was a cave that Constans had discovered on one\nof his hunting-trips, and which, boylike, he had proceeded to fit up\nwith some rude furniture for lodging and cooking, little dreaming that\nhe should ever stand in actual need of these necessities.\n\nThither he betook himself, impelled primarily by the mere instinct for\nrefuge and shelter. Fortunately, the larder had been replenished within\nthe past week, there was an abundance of dry fuel stacked up in the\ninterior of the cavern, and the woods were full of game. But during\nthose first two or three days it is doubtful if Constans would have\nremarked either the presence or the absence of these creature comforts;\nhe ate when he was hungry and went to sleep when it grew dark. The rest\nof the time he sat motionless, thinking, thinking--living for the most\npart in that past that now seemed so infinitely far away.\n\nOf course, the cavern had been the storehouse of his treasures. Here he\nkept a spare hunting-bow and a full stock of arrows, together with his\nfishing lines and nets and a miscellaneous assortment of traps and\ntools. Here, too, was the secret depository of his cherished\nspying-glasses and of another equally marvellous but unfortunately\nvalueless piece of mechanism--a revolver of large caliber. This latter\nhad belonged to his grandfather (for whom he had been named), and upon\nhis death Constans had claimed and taken possession of it. The weapon\nwas in perfect order, for its former owner had been careful to keep it\nwell cleaned and oiled; an absurd whim, of course, since without its\nammunition it was useless. The boy used to puzzle mightily over it,\nsetting the hammer and watching the cylinder as it revolved, then\npulling the trigger and listening to its fascinating click. But he never\ngot any nearer to the secret.\n\nEven more precious than the pistol and binoculars were his books, an\noddly assorted library that included the child's pictorial history\nalready mentioned, Dryden's translation of the _Iliad_, an imperfect\ncopy of _The Three Musketeers_, and _The Descent of Man_. These, indeed,\nmade up the full list of books belonging to the keep, and Constans had\nbeen permitted to appropriate them, nobody else caring to waste time\nover their stained and worm-eaten pages.\n\nWith Constans, however, it had been different. In company with the other\nchildren he had been set at the task of learning his letters, and at\nfirst he, too, had rebelled at the uncongenial labor. What possible use\ncould these ugly, crooked characters ever be to him? And then, suddenly,\nhe found in them a magic key unlocking a door that opened upon an\nundiscovered country--that of the mighty past.\n\nNaturally he experienced some difficulty in viewing this new old world\nin anything like its proper proportions, and it was the literal baldness\nof the child's school-book that first gave him anything like a true\nperspective. Here was both the written story and the visible picture of\nthe world as it once was, as it might be again. Studying these records\nand achievements of the ancient civilization, Constans found himself\npossessed of the knowledge of many things and consumed by the desire to\nlay hold of many more.\n\nBut all this lay in the past--ages ago, when as yet no Doomsman had\nlanded at the Golden Cove, and the pine-tree banner still flew from the\nfighting platform of the Greenwood Keep. Now nothing mattered to the boy\nsitting dull-eyed and inert in the darkest corner of his miserable\nrefuge, while outside it was raining in torrents. But on the third day\nit cleared, and the rays of the morning sun, striking level with the\nmouth of the cave, fell full upon the lad's face, rousing him in a\ndouble sense. He sprang to his feet and drew in a deep breath of the\nmorning air. How blue the sky! How golden the sun! As he sat eating his\nfrugal breakfast of oat-cake and honey he rapidly reviewed his present\ncondition and future prospects, coming at last to the decision that he\nwould go to Croye and see what his uncle Hugolin might be inclined to do\nfor him.\n\nIt was inspiriting, the mere fact that he had determined upon a course\nof action, and Constans immediately began his preparations for\ndeparture. It did not take long to put together his worldly wealth--the\nfour books, the binoculars, the pistol, and the chief of his other\npossessions; now he had everything compactly stowed away in a shoulder\npack and was ready for the journey.\n\nThe town of Croye was situated on the Greater river (formerly the\nHudson) and some ten miles north of the ancient city of New York. It\nboasted a population of quite fifteen hundred souls, and this, with its\nimportance as a trading centre, made it a notable municipality for these\nlatter days. Its appearance, however, does not call for any extended\ndescription; assuredly, it was not imposing. A heterogeneous jumble of\nlow, half-timbered houses and mud-plastered hovels; dirty, unpaved\nstreets, a mean-looking market-place, where the shrill clamor of\nhuckstering never seemed to cease; some pretentious-looking public\nbuildings, with stuccoed fronts; outside of all, the inevitable earth\nrampart, topped by a palisade and pierced by sally-ports at the cardinal\npoints--such was Croye, the principal city of this western hemisphere in\nthe year 2015, or ninety since the Great Change.\n\nConstans frowned as he gazed upon this unlovely picture. Yet he\ndetermined that he would find something of good in it, and as though\nanswering his thought, the sun reappeared at that very moment from\nbehind a passing cloud, its rays lighting up the red tiling used as\nroofing in the houses of the better class--the one note of cheerful\ncolor among these dingy browns and grays. It was an omen, and he\naccepted it as such.\n\nIt was to one of these red-topped mansions that Constans finally found\nhis way, after experiencing several rebuffs from churlish citizens of\nwhom he had ventured to inquire for the whereabouts of his uncle. Now,\nas he laid his hand upon the knocker, he was conscious that the feeling\nof despondency had again fallen upon him; he recalled the old story of\nMesser Hugolin's bitter opposition to the marriage of his sister Rayne\nand Gavan of the keep, of how he had refused to attend the wedding and\nhad sent no gift. Since then there had been no real intimacy between the\nfamilies, although the breach had been outwardly healed and formal\ncivilities infrequently passed. A poor prospect, it would seem, for the\nsuccess of Constans's appeal. But blood is blood, and there was\nliterally no one else to whom he could turn in this his extremity. He\nlet the knocker fall.\n\nMesser Hugolin, a stout man, with crafty lines creased in his broad\nface, received his nephew with nominal cordiality and listened\nattentively to his story. But he was not over-prompt with either advice\nor offer of assistance, and Constans, with a sore heart, finally rose to\ngo.\n\n\"Don't be in a hurry,\" said his uncle, coolly. \"Let me think this over\nagain. After all, we are of the same stock, although your father always\nflouted me for a mean-spirited churl. Poor Gavan, we may forgive him\nnow.\"\n\nAfter another period of cogitation and incidental homilies upon the\nsinfulness of pride and free living, Messer Hugolin came to the point;\nhe offered to take Constans into his employ as an apprentice in the\ntannery. Of course, Constans would have no wages until his indenture was\nout, but he would, at least, be assured of lodging, food, and clothes,\nthe bare necessities of existence. Not an especially attractive\nproposition, but Constans, after a short consideration, concluded to\naccept it. He had a purpose in remaining here in Croye, almost within\nsight of Doom the Forbidden; he had not forgotten that therein dwelt one\nQuinton Edge.\n\nAnd now a new life began for the boy, and a hard one. Lodged in a corner\nof the garret, clad in the meanest garments, fed on the coarsest fare,\nhis lot was little better than that of the actual serf, and in some\nrespects inferior to it, for it was good policy to treat the slave with\nsome decency and so secure a full life's work from the human machine.\nConstans, on the other hand, was bound for four years only, and it was\npolicy to drive him at full speed.\n\nMesser Hugolin's business was of a general nature. He bought and sold\neverything in the way of raw product and finished goods, but cloth and\nleather formed the staple of his trade. The latter he manufactured\nhimself, and his tannery was the largest in Croye. It occupied extensive\nyards along the river-front, and Constans entered upon the agreeable\noccupation of unloading stinking hides from the barges which came down\nfrom the upper river twice in the week, a routine varied only by long\nhours of pounding at interminable lengths of white-oak bark, preparing\nit for use in the tan-pits. Hard, dirty, malodorous work it was, but he\nkept at it steadily, his purpose always in view.\n\nLittle by little his plans had been taking shape, and now at last he had\narrived at something definite. A secret, of course, and fortunately\nopportunity had been given him in which to develop his idea. To explain\nmore particularly:\n\nOn ordinary days the working-hours were from dawn to dark, but Sunday\nwas his own, save for the hour immediately following sunrise and that\npreceding sunset, when everybody was required to attend upon public\nworship.\n\nEvery Sunday, then, Constans made his way through the town barriers\nimmediately upon their unclosing, and betook himself to a wooded\nriver-cove about a mile south of the town. For three months he had been\nworking on a canoe, shaping it with fire and adze from a poplar log, and\nnow, after infinite difficulty, the task approached completion. Could he\nhave had a confidant, a helper, the work might have been done in a third\nof the time, for Constans was not much of a mechanic. But there was no\none among his fellow-workmen whom he dared trust, and so he toiled on\nalone.\n\nThe canoe had been launched, and, to Constans's delight, she was but\nslightly lopsided. A few stones brought her to trim, and she paddled\nbeautifully.\n\nHe had fixed upon the third Sunday in August for the great trial, for\nthe Monday following was a civic holiday, the anniversary of the\nfounding of the city. The double event would give him abundant time in\nwhich to make a reconnoissance of his enemy's position and then return\nto Croye to resume his position in Messer Hugolin's tanyard. For his\nfoothold there must not be endangered; if he returned at all, he would\nfind it more necessary than ever.\n\nPermission to absent himself from Saturday night to Tuesday morning had\nto be obtained from the city authorities. They objected at first, but\nfinally accorded their consent. With his uncle, the matter was quickly\nsettled. Messer Hugolin did not approve of holidays for apprentices, but\nhe dared not controvert the law, and Constans was already in possession\nof the blue ticket which would enable him to pass the city barriers\nafter sunset on Saturday. So Messer Hugolin contented himself with\nblack looks and an acid jibe at the vanity of his civic associates, who\nmultiplied holidays that they might have opportunity to display\nthemselves in their gold chains and red robes of office.\n\n\"And harkee, boy!\" he concluded, harshly. \"Let me see you at roll-call\nTuesday morning or not at all. With flour at ten tokens the quarter,\nthere is no bread of idleness to be eaten in my house.\" And thereupon\nthey parted without further speaking.\n\nIt was a warm August evening when he finally pushed out from shore and\nlaid his course down-stream. He had not ventured upon the experiment of a\nsail, but the tide was beginning to run out, and that, with the current,\nshould carry him to his destination without the dipping of an oar. But\nhe reflected that the moon would rise at nine o'clock, and as it was\nbarely past the full the light might betray him to watching eyes. He\ncould take no risks, and so must reach the city under cover of darkness.\nAccordingly, he bent to his paddle, taking it easy at first, and then\nlengthening out the stroke as he gained confidence in this hitherto\nuntried art.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nIN THE SHADOW OF DOOM\n\n\nAn hour wore on, and Constans was approaching the suburbs of the ancient\nmunicipality. But it did not suit his purpose to make a landing here.\nHis plan was to reach the lower end of the island upon which the city\nwas built, then to work his way northward on foot until he should\ndiscover the innermost citadel of the Doomsmen. To get a fair idea of\nhis task, he proposed to ascend one of the immensely high buildings\nwhich stood crowded together in the down-town district. From such a\nvantage-point he could surely fix upon landmarks for his future guidance\nin penetrating the labyrinth of streets. It would not be a pleasant\nexperience to lose one's way, and, perhaps, stumble by mistake on Master\nQuinton Edge's front door.\n\nNow, as Constans travelled onward, the ruined city began to grow upon\nhim in ever heavier and darker mass. Here and there a half-demolished\nchurch-spire raised itself above the neighboring roof-line; plainly this\nhad been one of the old-time residential sections and of the better\nclass. Still farther down the stream and the water-front stood crowded\nthickly with wharves and warehouses, the scene of the mighty commerce of\nthe past. The ships themselves were there, great monsters of iron and\nsteel, scaled and honeycombed with red rust. But the wharf-slips had\nlong since silted up, and the vessels, careening little by little with\nthe subsidence of the water, had finally broken away from the\nrestraining hawsers and lay on their beam-ends in the mud, a sorrowful\nspectacle.\n\nThe moon was rising and it was time to go ashore. Accordingly, he\ndirected his course for a pier that extended somewhat farther than its\nfellows into the stream. There was just water enough to float the canoe\nwithin arm's-length of the girders--a fortunate circumstance, since\nConstans had not liked the idea of trusting himself upon the\ntreacherous-looking mud-flat left uncovered by the ebbing tide. Securing\nthe boat under shadow of the structure, he took his hunting-knife and\nbasket of provisions and climbed easily to the floor of the pier, then\npicking his way across its broken planking he reached solid ground. At\nlast he stood within Doom the Forbidden.\n\nNow this street, which ran parallel with the river, was of unusual\nwidth, and Constans crossed it quickly, seeking for cover in some\nnarrower and darker thoroughfare. A cross-street opened directly in\nfront of him. He plunged into it without hesitation, for the moonlight\nwas now in full flood and there might be sharp eyes about.\n\nIn the open spaces along the water-front grass grew thick and tall as in\na meadow, but in this narrow, crooked lane the wholesomer, sun-loving\nplants found little encouragement to existence. In their stead,\npale-colored creepers mantled the house walls, and everywhere were moss\nstains and the spore of the various fungoid growths. Constans's\nfootsteps fell hollowly upon the pavement slippery with weed and the\nAugust damp, and as he walked along an unearthly radiance suddenly\nilluminated his path; from every cornice and eaves-end hung balls of the\npale St. Elmo's fire; not a house but boasted its array of\ncorpse-candles that flickered with a greenish flame.\n\nA terrifying sight, but harmless. Far more dangerous, could he have\nknown it, were the invisible but deadly gases from the century-old\ncorruption that rose to meet him and were unconsciously inhaled. Then,\nas the fumes mounted to his brain, sober reason was ousted from her\nthrone and imagination rioted unchecked, peopling the void with horrors\nand ineffectual phantoms. From the sashless windows grotesque faces\nstared down upon him, scowling malignantly, while others, with still\nmore hideous smile, invited him to enter and become one of their\ndreadful company. Insane laughter re-echoed in his ears, and the music\nof lutes, irresistible in its languor-compelling potency. Already had\nConstans stopped twice to listen, and upon each occasion he had been\nobliged to exercise all his failing strength of body and mind to resume\nhis forward march. If he halted again it would be forever; of that he\nfelt perfectly assured, but neither the imminence nor the character of\nthe peril in which he stood seemed sufficient to arouse him from his\nlethargy. Yet he kept on, walking with the shuffling stride of a\nmechanical doll; now he wavered and hesitated, as though the propelling\nspring had wellnigh run down. The night reek, hot and damp, hung like a\npoisoned veil upon his mouth and lips; he could not breathe; he gasped\nand threw up one arm as does a swimmer who looks his last upon a\npitiless sun and sky.\n\nThe wind had risen with the moon; it had been growing in strength, and\nnow a strong gust rattled among the chimney-pots. One fell with a crash,\nand a tiny fragment of brick struck Constans on the check, cutting the\nskin. The shock and the trickle of blood brought him to with a sharp\nshock; he ran forward a few steps and found himself sinking. The roadway\nimmediately in front of him had doubtless been undermined by the action\nof water; for the space of a dozen yards or more the pavement was but a\nshell concealing an abyss.\n\nConstans had already proceeded too far for retreat; he must go on or\nfounder where he stood. He flung himself forward, the oblong blocks of\ngranite, with which the street was paved, grinding together underneath\nhis feet as the mass yielded to the downward pressure. He was sucked in\nto his knees, but instinctively he kept the upper part of his body\nextended horizontally, his out-stretched hand seeking for some chance\nholdfast. Then, as he was beginning to despair, he found it, a section\nof small diameter lead piping that had been uncovered by the breaking\naway of the surrounding earth. It bent under his clutch but did not give\nway. With one last effort he pulled himself clear, gained the firm\nground beyond, and lay there trembling.\n\nWhen afterwards he came to reason soberly over the adventure, the\nconclusion seemed obvious that the pitfall had been a consequent upon\nthe breaking out of one of the ancient springs, so that the water, in\nendeavoring to find an outlet, had finally undermined the whole\nroadway. The chasm, as he looked back upon it, extended dear across the\nstreet. Its depth was only conjectural, but the mass presented the\ntreacherous appearance of quaking sand, and Constans shuddered as he\ngazed. Yet he had escaped; the peril was past; let him forget what was\nbehind and press forward.\n\nHalf a block farther on and he found himself in a cul-de-sac. The street\nwas filled from house-wall to house-wall with an immense mass of broken\nstone, brick, and other d\u00e9bris. The cause was not far to seek.\n\nImmediately upon the left rose one of the fabulously high buildings for\nwhich the ancient city had been famous. It could not compare in\nmagnitude with the tremendous structures that he could discern still\nfarther ahead, but its dozen and a half of stories loomed up imposingly\nwhen contrasted with the moderate sized houses adjoining it. Constans\nlooked up in wonder at its towering fa\u00e7ade, then started back with an\nexclamation of alarm.\n\nIt appeared that the foundations of the structure had in some way become\nweakened, for the whole building had settled and was leaning over at a\nterrifying divergence from the perpendicular. Being constructed of iron\ntruss-work similar to that of a bridge, the essential framework still\nheld together, but the outside walls, mere shells of stone and brick,\nhad cracked and given way under the strain, falling piece-meal into the\nstreet below. Even as he looked, a stone dropped from a window pediment\nand crashed into splinters on the pavement a few yards beyond where he\nstood. The angle of inclination seemed to grow larger as he gazed at\nit; the enormous mass poised itself above him, monstrous, informed,\nthreatening to strike.\n\nWith that uncomfortable contraction of the scalp-skin that attends upon\nthe sudden presence of peril, Constans backed hastily away; not for\nworlds would he have ventured again under that overhang of artificial\ncliff. Yet behind him was the stretch of sunken pavement; he could not\nrisk another passage of that. A single alternative remained--to enter\none of the small houses that lined the street, ascend to its roof, and\nso escape to the nearest cross thoroughfare.\n\nWith a sigh of relief, Constans threw open the scuttle and climbed out\nupon the leads. He had entered at random one of the mean-looking\nedifices that hemmed him in at the right and left, and it was pleasant\nto escape from the close atmosphere of its long-unused staircases and\ncorridors. Apparently the house had been occupied as a tenement in the\nancient time; the marks of its degradation had survived the universal\ndecay, and there was even a fetid suggestion in the air of old-time\nsqualor and disease. Glad he was to be free of it all, and he let the\nscuttle fall to with a bang.\n\nAfter surveying the different routes as best he could, Constans\ndetermined to work his way to the southward. He took one forward step\nand stood transfixed; from below then came a faint but unmistakable tap,\ntap upon the closed scuttle. The bare suspicion that there could be some\nliving thing in that hideous interior, that it was appealing to him for\naid, made him physically sick. But better to meet any horror face to\nface than to wrestle longer with the invisible presence of Fear; he\nthrew aside the hatch, and a big white owl flew out, its wing grazing\nhis face. He could have shouted aloud, so nakedly had his nerves been\nlaid bare in the last quarter of an hour; then setting his teeth hard he\ntook hold of himself and laughed at his own vaporing. The worst was over\nnow; he was sure of that, and so again took courage.\n\nIt was an easy matter to pass from one connecting roof to another, and\nthereafter down a fire-escape to the side street. A few steps took him\nround the corner and into a wide thoroughfare leading directly to the\nmore important business quarter.\n\nConstans looked about him in wonderment. The high buildings stood\nshoulder to shoulder, hemming him in on every side; the street itself\nwas but a fissure in a mountain-range. The moon had now risen high in\nthe heavens, and her beams performed odd tricks of shadow play as they\ndanced through these colossal halls of emptiness and silence. Nothing\nseemed real or substantial; these enormous masses of masonry and iron\nlooked almost dreamlike, the ghosts of a forgotten past, shadows that\nmust surely vanish with the morning sun.\n\nTo sober his imagination, Constans began counting the number of stories\nin a sky-scraper that reared its monstrous bulk directly in front of\nhim. Thirty-six in all, and so higher by half a dozen floors than any of\nits neighbors. It should make an excellent observatory, and he\ndetermined upon exploring it.\n\n[Illustration: \"CONSTANS LOOKED ABOUT HIM IN WONDERMENT\"]\n\nThe street doors stood wide open, and the entrance-way was half blocked\nup by piles of dust and other refuse blown in from the street by the\nwinter storms. On the left, as one entered, was the principal suite of\noffices; it had been occupied by a banking firm, to judge from the\ndesk fittings and the long array of safes and vaults. These latter were\nopen and empty, the doors having been shattered by some powerful\nexplosive. In all probability the vaults had been closed and locked by\ntheir owners, and had afterwards been looted by the criminals who\nthronged the doomed city and who would naturally seek their richest\nbooty in the financial district. The floor was literally knee-deep in\npapers of all description, and in the heap were a number of bundles of\nthe old-time bank-notes, neatly labelled and banded. These the\nplunderers had evidently discarded as beneath their notice, for all that\nthey represented wealth so vast as to be wellnigh incalculable. With the\nGreat Change at hand these paper promises had become valueless; only the\nprecious metals themselves were worth the picking up, and the plunderers\nhad accordingly made a clean sweep of the specie drawers. It was by the\nmerest accident that Constans, in kicking aside a pile of elaborately\nengraved stock certificates, uncovered two of the smaller gold coins, a\nfive and ten dollar piece. He put the treasure-trove carefully away, but\nin spite of this promising beginning he was not tempted to proceed\nfurther on this golden trail. He had another purpose in view, and so\nfound his way to the principal staircase and began the upward climb.\n\nInterminable it seemed, and the sense of loneliness and oppression,\nwhich lay heavy on Constans's spirits, increased steadily as he went\nfrom one landing to another. Each succeeding story was so precisely like\nthe one he had just left; it was always the same long, marble-paved\ncorridor, with every door and window exactly duplicated. How could\nliving men and women have endured the appalling uniformity of this\nhuman beehive? Everywhere, too, were the same recurring evidences of the\nhaste and panic that had characterized the final moments of that\nterrible hegira. Hats and garments, cash-boxes and account-books,\nlittered the hallways, and were piled in little heaps at the entrances\nto the elevators--impedimenta that must inevitably be abandoned at the\nlast if life itself were to be saved. And the final tragedy--an elevator\ncage that had jammed in its ways and so hung fixed between two landings.\nIts occupants had suddenly found themselves entrapped, with no one to\nhear or to help. One can fancy the growing uneasiness, the wild amaze,\nthe terror that was afraid of the sound of its own voice. Constans\nhurried by; he had looked but that once.\n\nOnward and upward, and at last he had gained the topmost floor. It was\nhardly worth his while to ascend to the roof itself, and so he walked\ninto a room that faced the north and consequently commanded a view of\nthe city along its longitudinal axis. He gazed long and earnestly into\nthe obscurity, and far in the distance he caught the faint twinkle of a\nsolitary light--a camp-fire, perhaps. He tried to fix its bearings in\nhis mind; if it were a fire it must indicate the neighborhood of the\nDoomsman stronghold.\n\nFor a long time Constans stood at the window seeking to penetrate the\nmystery of the darkness that surrounded him; then at last nature\nasserted her rights, he yawned vigorously, and his eyelids fell. There\nwas a brown leather lounge in the room, still in tolerable condition,\nand he threw himself down without even troubling to remove the thick\ncoating of dust that covered it. He slept.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTHE KEYS OF POWER\n\n\nThe sun was high in the sky when Constans awoke. For a moment or two the\nunfamiliar environment puzzled him; then the keen edge of remembrance\nsheared through the mists of sleep and he sprang to his feet, alert and\nready for whatever might befall. He walked over to the window facing the\nnorth and looked out.\n\nFor miles and miles the ruined city stretched away, a wilderness of\nbrick and mortar. Here and there were areas of blackness and vacancy,\nwhere fire had worked its will, but these latter were confined for the\nmost part to the region along the water-front and to the poorer\nresidential portions. The business section, with its substantial shops\nand warehouses, and the central district, made up of the clubs,\nchurches, theatres, and the handsomer private houses, remained intact,\nin outward appearance at least. Viewed under the rays of a glorious\nmidsummer sun, the city seemed fair and proud as of yore, a stupendous\nmonument to the industry and genius of the race.\n\nAnd yet, withal, the spectacle was a singularly mournful and depressing\none, for nowhere were there any signs of life. Not a plume of vapor\nwaved against the azure sky, not even a dog ranged the grass-grown\nstreets. The silence reigned infinite and profound, and Constans started\nin alarm as it was suddenly broken by the scream of an eagle out of the\nblue. Here was the picture of a desolation incomparably more complete\nthan that of the untrodden desert upon which the life-giving spirit has\nnever breathed. For in this place there had existed a very citadel of\nbeing, and behold! a night had passed and it was not.\n\nSuddenly Constans bethought himself of that indefinite twinkle of fire,\nand he trained his broken binoculars on the spot where he had marked it\ndown the night before. The glass disclosed the existence of a\ncomparatively open space, doubtless one of the public squares of the\nancient city. It was bordered by a number of handsome edifices, and one\nunusually large, cream-colored building, whose distinctive architectural\nfeature was a tower of remarkably graceful proportions, attracted\nConstans's attention; it should serve him for a landmark, and he took\nits bearings carefully.\n\nBreakfast of brown bread and cold smoked beef was a simple and\nexpeditious meal, and, with his appetite appeased, Constans descended to\nthe street. He had his general direction in mind, and so was able to\nproceed at once upon his journey of exploration, keeping as closely as\npossible due north. He found the sidewalks and roadway encumbered by\nrubbish, and here and there almost entirely blocked by fallen masonry;\nbut in spite of these obstructions he managed to maintain a fair average\npace. Indeed, it was the strangeness of his surroundings rather than the\nmaterial obstacles that caused his steps to loiter. The glimpses that he\ngot through the windows of the deserted shops amazed him; a hundred\ntimes he would fain have halted to investigate some fresh marvel. But he\nwithstood the temptation, telling himself that these things were but\ntrifles, and that the real objects of his quest lay farther on.\n\nAn hour's walk brought Constans to within three blocks of the building\nwith the tower. He had purposely diverged from the direct line in\napproaching it, being shrewdly of the opinion that the stronghold of the\nDoomsmen was not far distant. He was convinced of the truth of this\nconjecture when he reached the next cross-street, which debouched into\nthe public square already mentioned. He could see that the end of the\nstreet was filled by a barricade of paving-blocks and flag-stones torn\nup from the roadway; it looked as though the whole square were one vast\nand formidable fortress.\n\nIt was still early in the morning, and up to this time Constans had not\nseen sign of man. Now, as he continued his cautious examination of the\nbarrier, he noticed two or three spirals of smoke rising behind the\nparapet and going straight up into the windless air. The hornets were\nstirring then, and it behooved him to keep well away from their nest.\n\nAfter some consideration Constans decided that he would continue on\ntowards the north, skirting this centre of danger at a safe distance\nuntil he should be some distance above it. He would then work cautiously\nback towards the citadel, finally seeking some elevated point, such as\nthe roof of a tall building, from which to complete his observations.\n\nAfter proceeding about a mile in an up-town direction, Constans turned\nand walked westward for a couple of blocks. It was a broad and handsome\navenue on which he now found himself, and from the character of the\nbuildings which lined it Constans concluded that here was where the\nwealth and fashion of the ancient world had had its chosen habitation.\nOnce again he would gladly have lingered for a closer examination of the\nmany things that interested him, but the spur of his purpose as often\npricked him on. Yet finally he did stop, thrilling with the sense of a\ngreat discovery.\n\nIt was a large and architecturally impressive building that had\nattracted Constans's attention, and a flash of intuition enabled him to\npronounce upon its true character at first sight. He was now at the very\nheart of the city's social and intellectual life; here, if anywhere, he\nmight expect to find one of the magnificent libraries upon which the\nancient municipality had prided itself. He must decide the question,\nand, after some further searching, he discovered a side door that\nyielded to his touch.\n\nHe was right, then; this was truly a library, and could he ever have\nimagined that there were so many books in the world! A cloud of dust\nrose under his feet as he went up to the cases and tried to read the\ntarnished titles of the volumes on the shelves. Again Chance led him\naright, and his eye brightened as he discovered an unpretentious volume\nthat proclaimed itself: _The Official Visitors' Guide to the City of New\nYork for the Year 1905_. He pulled out the book and opened it. Of course\nit contained what he wanted, a large folding map, and spreading the\nlatter out upon a table Constans set himself to studying it earnestly;\nthis was his enemy's territory, and he must acquaint himself as\nthoroughly as possible with its points of weakness and its points of\nstrength.\n\nThe task of identification proved easier than he had thought possible.\nHere was where he had landed the night before. Step by step he could\ntrace his walk up-town, and the identity of the building in which he now\nstood was made certain by the ruins of the great white cathedral a few\nblocks farther north. And there, a dozen or more blocks to the south,\nthere was the citadel, the living heart of the outlaw world, there was\nthe stronghold in which one Quinton Edge sat secure and at his ease. A\ncold misgiving suddenly struck at Constans's heart. How could he hope to\nmake way alone against a host? How could he think to reach an enemy\nprotected by these impregnable walls? For such a task he would need to\nwield the thunderbolts of the gods, and he had only his useless pistol\nand his long bow. He sighed and let his head droop for a moment, then\nfelt ashamed of his weakness and straightened up again. The way was\nthere; he would find it.\n\nMechanically, his eyes roved along the serried shelves of books, and a\nnew light came into them. In these dusty tomes themselves were hidden\nthe keys of power; he had but to seize them and the secrets of the\nmighty past would be revealed to him, to him alone. Armed with these\npotencies he might dare and accomplish anything--everything.\n\nTrembling with excitement, he went and stood before the cases, scanning\nthe various titles. Again his lucky star guided him; on the row level\nwith his eyes stood an encyclop\u00e6dia of the applied arts and sciences. He\ncarried the two bulky volumes to a convenient table and sat there\nabsorbed.\n\nConstans looked up in the sudden consciousness that he was observed, and\nmet the half-defiant, half-terrified, and wholly curious gaze of a girl.\nHardly more than a child she seemed, not over fourteen at the outside,\nand with a figure that was all flatness and unlovely angles. Certainly\nan exceedingly ugly duckling, yet there was promise of future swanship\nin the clean curves of her neck and in the firm poise of the small head.\nMoreover, her coloring was good, a clear brown through which a scarlet\nflush, born of the excitement of the moment, glowed intermittently, like\nthe flashing of distant signal-flags. And in her eyes there was a\ncurious red glint where the light fell slantingly upon the pupil.\nConstans found his feet awkwardly and stood gazing at her. She in turn\nscanned him with attention, and obviously grew at ease in noting his\nincreasing disconcertment.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" she demanded, abruptly. \"You are not of the\nchildren of the Doomsmen.\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered, and compressed his lips obstinately.\n\n\"You are very foolish,\" she retorted, with a slow shake of her head. \"If\nMaster Quinton Edge catches you he will nick your ear, and then you will\nhave to row in the galleys.\"\n\nConstans winced. Could she possibly have discovered his secret? But no;\nthe hair fell in a thick wave upon his ears--it had been but a chance\nshot.\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" he said, coldly. The tawny eyes, with their heart of\nfire, rested upon him approvingly.\n\n\"I am Esmay,\" she answered. \"What is your name?\"\n\n\"What does it matter?--well, then, Constans.\" He spoke impatiently,\nbeing anxious to get back to his book. He glanced at it longingly, and\nshe, who, as it afterwards appeared, had a part to play, took the cue.\n\n\"Such stupid-looking books!\" She bent carelessly over the volume on the\ntable. \"Nothing but wheels and dotted lines and wheels again. It is a\nridiculous book.\"\n\n\"It is not,\" said Constans, hotly.\n\nThe damsel smiled. \"Oh, if you like that sort of thing, I know of a book\nover there.\" She pointed airily to an alcove at the opposite end of the\nhall. \"It has many more pictures and many more wheels in colors, too,\nred and yellow and blue.\"\n\nConstans was all on fire in an instant. \"Will you show it to me?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"In there,\" said the girl, and pointed to a recess between two tall\ncases.\n\nTen feet above his head ran a metal gallery that gave access to the\nupper tiers of shelves, but Constans did not look up, being intent upon\nthe treasure. Where was it? He could not see.\n\nThe noose of a rope had tightened upon his arms before he was aware that\nit encircled them. He made one furious, ineffectual effort to free\nhimself, and then stood motionless, waiting for the next move of the\nunseen enemy. Forthwith, a second noose dropped smoothly around his\nneck; it was at once drawn taut, and Constans was obliged to stretch\nhimself to his full height to avoid being strangled. He heard Esmay clap\nher hands, and steps descending from the gallery; then his captor stood\nbefore him. He was a boy of Constans's own age, but of shorter,\nsturdier build. A pleasant, ingenuous face it was, flushed now with the\njoy of triumph.\n\n\"Got him,\" he announced, importantly, to the traitress Esmay, who had\nretreated towards the door. \"Don't be such a coward; he can't get away,\"\nhe continued, examining his victim's bonds with critical attention.\n\n\"Look, Esmay; if he moves he hangs himself. A fix, isn't it?\" and the\nboy laughed contentedly. It had been rare sport, this trapping of a man,\nworth half a dozen wolves or even a bear.\n\n\"Hollo! Esmay,\" he called again, and the girl came up slowly. \"You did\nit splendidly,\" said the boy. \"Here's the bracelet I promised you,\" and\nhe held out a circlet of gold-filigree work studded with carbuncles.\n\"They match your eyes,\" he added, in awkward compliment, and then\nblushed for the incredible weakness of mind that had prompted his words.\nWas she going to laugh at him?\n\nBut the girl took, the bracelet without even a look at the donor. She\nsnapped it on her wrist and walked defiantly, straight up to the\nprisoner, as though she would compel him to admire her treasure, to\ncongratulate her upon it.\n\nConstans held himself serenely imperturbable, not even turning his head.\nHer face burned. She threw the bauble on the floor; it lay there crushed\nand shapeless. Then she turned upon her accomplice in the successful\ntreachery.\n\n\"I hate you! I hate you!\" She walked away, imperially offended, and\nstood looking out of a window that faced the street.\n\n\"Whew!\" whistled the boy, in dismay, that was half comic and half real.\nHe addressed himself to Constans, naively confident of masculine\nsympathy. \"Well, if that isn't--\" but the words failed him.\n\nConstans, angry and humiliated as he was, could not help smiling.\n\n\"You know it wasn't exactly fair,\" he said.\n\nThe boy considered, then answered, honestly:\n\n\"It wasn't, then, but what are we going to do about it? You are a\nHouseman, and you have come to spy out the secrets of Doom the\nForbidden. Any of the men who saw you would kill you like a snake.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so, but they would not wait until my back was turned or get a\ngirl to help them.\"\n\nConstans suddenly realized that he stood free of his bonds. The boy had\nsevered them with his clasp-knife, that being the quickest means of\nreleasing his captive.\n\n\"We will fight for it, then,\" he said, simply.\n\nConstans nodded.\n\nIt was not at all an even match, for Constans was at least thirty pounds\nlighter than his adversary, and his slightly longer reach of arm was\nmore than counter-balanced by the latter's ability to take any amount of\npunishment.\n\nHalf a dozen ineffectual passes and they clinched. Constans was forced\nbackward; he tripped and fell. The blows, short but savage, rained down\nupon his face. He tried to strike back, but his throat was gripped hard;\nhe was suffocating. Consciousness was about to desert him, and he felt\nvaguely angry at this betrayal of his senses; then the light returned,\nand he sat up, his head swimming. A man stood between him and his late\nopponent. It was Quinton Edge, and the recognition was a mutual one.\n\n\"Oh, you!\" drawled Quinton Edge, with that well-remembered,\nfine-gentleman inflection. \"I am almost sorry that I interfered, but\nthis young lady would have it so, and a woman's will is always law. Eh,\nUlick?\"\n\nBut the boy Ulick scowled. \"It was no business of yours,\" he said,\nangrily.\n\n\"That depends. Besides, it stands to reason that no man likes to see his\nown property mishandled. You don't realize, my good fellow, that you\nhave a fist as rough as a shark-skin.\"\n\n\"Your property!\" echoed the boy, in disdain. \"Prove it.\"\n\n\"Easily,\" smiled Quinton Edge, and drew aside the lock of hair that\nconcealed the V-shaped nick in Constans's left ear.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Ulick, shortly. He had been quick to see and interpret the\nappeal in his prisoner's eyes. \"It makes not a particle of difference,\"\nasserted Ulick, stubbornly. \"He is my captive, taken in fair fight, and\nhe belongs to me for all of his nicked ear. I sha'n't give him up, and\nthat's my last word to you, Master Quinton Edge.\"\n\nHalf a dozen men entered the hall hurriedly; the girl Esmay must have\nsummoned them when she had disappeared a few minutes before. Sturdy\nvarlets they were, clad in green jerkins and armed with ashen lances\npointed with steel. As Constans came afterwards to know, they were of\nthe personal body-guard of the old Dom Gillian, to whom the boy Ulick\nwas both grandson and presumptive heir. Now Quinton Edge was not yet\nready to measure swords with Dom Gillian. So he veiled his irritation\nand answered, equably:\n\n[Illustration: \"THE BLOWS RAINED DOWN UPON HIS FACE\"]\n\n\"You know the law about harboring a House-dweller, and since you choose\nto violate it\"--here he shrugged his shoulders detestably--\"let Dom\nGillian see to it. Yet, for the sake of peace, I will ask you once more\nto surrender this serf, who bears my mark and is legally proved my\nproperty. In the end it may save a mountain of trouble. What say you?\"\n\n\"No!\" thundered Ulick, roundly, for he was angered at the implied\nthreat, and would have held his ground now out of pure stubbornness.\nWhereupon Quinton Edge smiled and sauntered out, adjusting the ruffles\nat his wrist and carrying himself as gallantly as though he had been the\nvictor, not the vanquished, in this little contest of wills.\n\nConstans went up to Ulick and held out his hand. \"Thank you,\" he said,\nawkwardly, and Ulick flushed in his turn.\n\nThe guardsmen were crowding about the two boys, looking curiously at\nConstans. But Ulick ordered them out imperiously, and they obeyed, being\nmen of slow wit and not used to argue with their superiors. Ulick turned\nto Constans. \"Well, that was fair enough, to make up for--for the other\nthing?\"\n\nConstans nodded a hearty assent; he hesitated, and then spoke, steadily:\n\"But you must understand that I would rather fight again than wear the\niron collar of a slave, or call any one master, even you. You will kill\nme, for you are the better man with the naked fist. But I should prefer\nit that way.\"\n\n\"Will you leave this with me?\" asked Ulick, nodding his head wisely,\nand Constans wondered and submitted.\n\nThey went out into the breathless noon of an August day. Two or three\nmen were loitering about, and Ulick frowned as he saw them.\n\n\"I shall have to take you to my grandsire,\" he whispered. \"These are\nQuinton Edge's men, and they are doubtless under orders to watch us.\nThis way,\" and Constans followed obediently.\n\nUlick stopped at a beautiful Gothic edifice, built about a small\ncourt-yard, in which a score of the green-jerkined guardsmen were\nlounging. In a corner stood a wooden cistern for the collection of\nrain-water from the roof-spouts. Ulick drew a pannikin of water and\noffered it to Constans that he might bathe his face, which was badly\npuffed and marked. How reviving, the touch of the cool, clean liquid!\nConstans arose, mightily refreshed; then, in response to his guide's\nlook, he followed him into the main hallway of the house and up the\nbroad stairs.\n\nThe building, judging from its size and appointments, must have been the\ndwelling of one of the richest members of the ancient plutocracy, and\nthe traces of a splendid luxury were to be seen on all sides. The\ncolored marbles underfoot, the gilding overhead, the gorgeous, albeit\ntorn and weather-stained tapestries that covered the walls--these things\nwere eloquent of a pristine magnificence that could hardly have been\nequalled, even in this city of palaces. Constans kept looking about him\nwith all his eyes, but Ulick strode along indifferently. Every son of\nthe Doomsmen might possess a dwelling measurably as fine as this if he\nchose to look for it, but from a practical point of view the sole\nqualification for a man's house was that it should be standing in plumb\nand tolerably weather-proof. Gold-leaf and silken hangings would not\nkeep out the rain, and it was folly to spend time in making repairs.\nWhen a house became uninhabitable it was a simple matter to move into\nanother.\n\nThe apartment into which they now entered was long and lofty. The thick\ncurtains remained drawn before the windows, excluding so much of the\nlight that Constans had great difficulty in finding his way about. Then,\nhis eyes adjusting themselves to the obscurity, he saw before him a\ndivan piled high with pillows. Propped up against them was the figure of\nan old man.\n\nAnd such a man! In his prime he must have been a very colossus of\nstrength and stature, and even now, in his senility, the muscles that\nhad made terrible those great limbs could be plainly traced. For this\nwas Dominus Gillian, whose name had been first a byword and then a\nterror, and even now was a power to conjure with; Dom Gillian, renegade\nand hero, gallows-bird and world-builder, but ever and in all things a\nman, as all other men will bear witness.\n\nHe knew his favorite grandchild, and smiled as Ulick respectfully raised\nand kissed his hand, that hand in whose hollow had lain the world, now\nshrunken and nerveless, scarce able to crush an impertinent fly. Ulick\nspoke slowly and distinctly, explaining his action and seeking boldly to\njustify it.\n\nThis dog of the House People had dared, under veil of darkness, to creep\ninto the Gray Wolf's den. He, Ulick, had captured him alone and unaided;\nsurely such an exploit deserved recognition, and Ulick desired to keep\nthe prisoner as his own property. Could he do so, no matter what claim\nmight be urged against his right?\n\nThe old man listened, and looked at Constans indifferently. Then he\nspoke in the inflectionless monotone of extreme old age:\n\n\"A House-dweller and a snake, my son--crush them when you can, for the\nwoods are full of shadows, and a man cannot always see where to plant\nhis foot. I have lived very long, and I know.\"\n\n\"But, my father, if you will only let me----\"\n\n\"I am tired,\" interrupted the even, expressionless tones. \"Go away and\nleave me to sleep. To-morrow we will cut out this Houseman's eyes and\ntongue, so that he may see nothing and tell nothing. Then you may have\nhim for your plaything--it will be better so.\"\n\nThe eyelids fell, and the old man slept placidly, his face serene as\nthat of a babe. The two boys stole quietly away.\n\nDown a narrow passage and a flight of stairs into a dark, cool room,\nunderground, as Constans conjectured. Ulick left him there, counselling\nquiet and repose for the next few hours.\n\nIt was night when Ulick finally appeared and conducted his departing\nguest to the open air. The moon had not yet risen, and the danger of\ndetection was practically past.\n\n\"You are sure that you can find your boat,\" whispered Ulick, as they\nstood facing each other, curiously loath to part.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Constans, \"for I shall follow the river straight down.\nIt will take a little longer, but that matters not. Good-bye; I sha'n't\nforget.\"\n\nA slender figure slipped out from the shadow of a doorway and confronted\nthem. It was Esmay, and she spoke with serene gravity.\n\n\"Since you and Ulick are friends you ought to make it up with me also.\nBut not unless you really want to,\" she added, hastily.\n\nConstans smiled with youthful cynicism.\n\n\"Of course,\" he answered, magnificently condescending. \"You are a woman,\nand knew no better.\"\n\nShe snatched her hand away. \"Yes, I am a woman, Master Constans, and\nsome day you will know what that means.\" She moved away, majestically as\ndoes a goddess, conscious of her power but magnanimously refraining from\nusing it. Constans and Ulick laughed after the manner of men-kind who\nfind it easy to disbelieve in what they do not understand. Then, with a\nlong hand-grip, they parted.\n\nThe canoe was still in its hiding-place underneath the ruined pier, and\nConstans's first care was to stow away in the stern-locker the two\nvolumes of the scientific cyclop\u00e6dia that he had been reading at the\ntime of his capture. Ulick of his own volition had stolen the books from\nthe library hall, and had put them into Constans's hands at the moment\nof parting. They made a heavy load for him to carry, but what a precious\nburden it was and how gladly he assumed it! For these were the keys of\npower.\n\nAs Constans paddled out into the stream he heard the steady thumping of\noars in rowlock. He shoved back into the shadow of the pier just as a\ngreat galley filled with men came foaming down the river. Constans could\nsee that it was a war-vessel of the largest size, for there were full\nsixty oars on a side arranged in two banks. The figure-head was the\nrepresentation of a black swan, and on the poop-deck stood the slight,\ngraceful figure of a man wearing a plumed hat. Constans saw him remove\nthe cigar from his lips as he turned to give an order. Instantly the\nport-oars held and backed, and the galley, swinging round on her heel,\nheaded up-stream again, passing within fifty yards of Constans's\nhiding-place. The boy's bow was in his hand, but he had not attempted to\nfit an arrow to the string. \"It will come--the time,\" he said, under his\nbreath.\n\nConstans stared gravely after the _Black Swan_ as she drove along. But\nfor the best of good-fortune he might now be tugging at a heavy ashen\noar, with the lash of the deck-master striping his back. Ulick,\nEsmay--yes, he had much to remember.\n\nTwo hours later he had scaled the wall of Croye, without being\ndiscovered by the sleepy sentinels, and was safe on his pallet of\ncorn-husks in Messer Hugolin's attic.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nTHE MESSAGE\n\n\nThree years had passed since that first memorable visit to Doom the\nForbidden--years of work and of growth. The simple out-door life and the\nphysical toil had been good discipline for Constans, and he was now a\nwell-built young fellow of two-and-twenty, nearly six feet tall and with\nmuscles like steel wire.\n\nThe nights, too, had afforded compensation for the labors of the day,\nfor then he could read and study. The two big volumes of the scientific\ncyclop\u00e6dia had been his school-masters, and he had striven faithfully to\nlearn of them. What a wonderful lesson it had been, for while there was\nmuch in this teaching that he could not understand at all, there was\nmuch again that, with the aid of the illustrations and diagrams, he\ncould make really his own. And so, little by little, he had been able to\nreconstruct, in imagination, at least, the lost civilization of the\nancient world; how men had tamed the lightning and bade it speak their\nwill and work their pleasure; how the same vapor that issued from the\npot bubbling on Martina's fire could be harnessed and made to draw a\nhundred wagons at once upon the old-time steel-railed highways; how a\nchild's hand on the crank of a machine-gun might hurl invisible death\namong a regiment of men and put even an army to flight. Steam and\ngunpowder and electricity, what wonderful ideas were connoted in the\nwords! The very names thrilled him with a sense of infinite power.\n\nA wonderfully fascinating study, and yet at times it left him\nunspeakably weary and depressed, for what did all this knowledge avail\nwithout the practical means to apply it? The great machines that the\nancients had built, what were they now but masses of red rust, useless\nalike to the fool who laughed at them and to the visionary who could\nonly dream of their magnificent potentialities.\n\nA dream, for, in truth, a lion was in the way. So long as the Doomsmen\nheld sway in the land, so long must the wheels of progress stay locked.\nUnable to use themselves the treasures of knowledge stored under their\nhands, they were unwilling that another should even touch them. What\ncould he or any other one man do?\n\nOnce, indeed, during the three years, Constans had found brief\nopportunity to revisit the scenes of his old home in the valley of the\nSwiftwater. In this general district of the West Inch were to be found\nnearly all of the larger estates, a fitting cradling-place, it would\nseem, for the new liberty, the awakening era.\n\nBut time was not yet come, as Constans soon saw clearly. He had been\nhospitably enough received, for the country-side had not forgotten the\nstory of the Greenwood Keep, and it was plain to see that this\nclear-eyed, well-set-up lad was of the true Stockader breed. One of his\nfather's bond-friends, Piers Major, of the River Barony, had even\noffered Constans a home under his roof-tree in exchange for\nsword-service. But this he declined, with becoming gratitude indeed,\nbut none the less firmly. He had no fancy to spend the rest of his life\nin a trooper's saddle riding down naked savages--an agreeable\noccupation, whose only variation was an afternoon at pig-sticking or a\nchance crack at some Doomsman's head. Better to endure the drudgery of\nthe tan-pits than to part with all purpose in life.\n\nAnd so the crusade, which Constans had hoped to father, died at its\nbirth. The kinsmen and friends of his family were sincere enough in\ntheir sympathy, but they could not be expected to risk their own skins\nin the furtherance of his private quarrels, and, so far as it was a\nquestion of political economy or of patriotism, these easy-going\ngentlemen troubled themselves not one whit. For the most part the\nDoomsmen kept their distance from a Stockader's threshold, and\n_laissez-faire_ was a good motto for both sides to adopt.\n\nConstans returned to Croye and to Messer Hugolin's attic neither\novermuch surprised nor discouraged by the results of his mission. After\nall, his ultimate object was a personal one--his revenge--and only his\nown hand could discharge that debt in full. Did the time seem over-long,\nthe way unendurably lonely and toilsome? He had only to close his eyes\nto remember--to remember. And so the years had passed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the noon spell on a day in late October, and Constans sat on the\nriver end of the long wooden pier at the tanyard eating his luncheon of\nbread and bacon scraps. The tide was running up slowly, as could be\nnoted from the bubbles and drift-wood that circled past the piling of\nthe wharf, and Constans, happening to glance down into the swirl, saw\nsomething that brought him to his feet. Nothing more remarkable than a\nbottle of thick, greenish glass, but bottles of any kind had become\nvaluable now that the art of glass blowing was so little practised, and\nsuch flotsam was not to be despised.\n\nHaving strung a length of noosed cord to a light pole, Constans threw\nhimself flat along the string-piece of the pier and began angling for\nthe prize. A failure or two and then he had it snared securely; now it\nwas in his hand.\n\nThe bottle was foul with slime and fungous growth, showing that it had\nbeen in the water for a long period. Possibly it had been out to sea and\nback many times before this particular flood-tide had brought it to\nMesser Hugolin's tannery and under the eyes of one who would have the\nwit to distinguish it from a rotten stick. At all events it had found a\nport at last.\n\nThe bottle had been corked and then sealed with pitch, and Constans had\nto use some care in getting at its contents, a slender cylinder of\ntightly rolled paper. Finally he succeeded in drawing it out uninjured,\nand saw that it was superscribed to his uncle Hugolin.\n\nThe old man looked up with a frown as Constans presented himself at the\ndoor of the counting-room. The rest hour was over and Constans's place\nwas at the tan-pit. How was the work to get done if everybody shirked\ntheir part of the common task? A message in a bottle. What foolery was\nthis? Nevertheless, Messer Hugolin extended his hand to receive the\nroll, and, removing the waxed string that bound it, knit his brows over\nthe enclosure--half a dozen sheets of writing. Constans was about to\nretire discreetly, but Messer Hugolin raised his hand.\n\n\"The writing is too fine for my eyes,\" he grumbled. \"Read it for me,\nnephew; but, harkee! you will keep your mouth shut whatever its import.\"\nThen, in a sudden gust of passion: \"A thousand plagues on that fool of\nan up-river factor who broke for me my reading-glass! Not another one to\nbe had in Croye for good-will or gold, and I compelled to borrow\nanother's eyes, to live at the mercy of my meanest clerk. Come, boy, you\nmust have the sense of it by this time!\"\n\n\"Shall I read it aloud?\" asked Constans, and then, in compliance with\nhis uncle's nod, he began:\n\n     \"'Dated at Doom, in the year 90 after the Great Change.\n\n     \"'It is a score of years my brother, since that moonless August\n     night when the Doomsmen came to Croye and I went back with them,\n     tied to Mad Scarlett's saddle-bow. Twenty years of silence in the\n     City of Silence, and I but a slim, brown-faced maid who might be\n     found one day playing at polo and lamenting her lack of mustachios,\n     and on the very next, mooning over a love charm. It was only\n     through the look in my cousin Philip's eyes, as he died under the\n     weight of the Doomsmen battle-axes, that I knew myself a woman,\n     that I finally entered upon my sex's heritage of sorrow.\n\n     \"'Does this seem an old and hardly remembered tale to you, Anthony\n     Hugolin, Councillor Primus of Croye, and a rich man, if one may\n     judge from the yearly tax rate that stands opposite your name in\n     Dom Gillian's head list? Withal, you are still my brother, and you\n     must listen to what I have now to say, the first and the last word\n     from me to you.\n\n     \"'I must be just and acknowledge that he truly loved me, the man\n     who plucked me like an apple from the bough; later on he made what\n     amends he could by proclaiming me his wife under the Doomsman law.\n     Yet it was a tiger-cat rather than a woman whom he had taken to his\n     bosom, and I wonder now that I did not a thousand times overpass\n     the limits of his forbearance. Assuredly, in that first agony, I\n     tried my hardest to stretch his patience to the breaking-point, in\n     the hope that a knife-thrust might open for me the doors of the\n     prison-house. You see, I was very young, and I could not forget my\n     cousin Philip's eyes.\n\n     \"'A woman's heart is like a cup; it holds but one fixed quantity of\n     life's essential liquor, be the latter sweet or bitter. An infinity\n     of little sips or one deep draught, what does it matter? The vessel\n     is empty in either case. Yet, as time went on, I grew to endure\n     existence; afterwards, when my Esmay was born, I valued it again\n     for her sake. Moreover, she was his daughter as well as mine, and\n     so I came finally to endure and even to welcome the touch of my\n     master's hand. In all these years it had never been aught but\n     gentle, for all that they called him Mad Scarlett, and the children\n     were taught to believe that he always wore gloves, because he had a\n     bloody palm whose stain no water would wash away. Yes, and I wept,\n     as any wife and mother might do, on that gray November day when I\n     knelt beside his bier.\n\n     \"'But this concerns only myself, and it is of Esmay, my daughter,\n     that I would speak. In a year she will be seventeen, and before\n     that time, if at all, the way must be opened for her to go to her\n     mother's people. I am helpless, except for this one opportunity of\n     committing a message to the hands of Chance, one slender line\n     dropped into the ocean of uncertainty. Yet nothing remains to me\n     but to make the cast, for in six months' time I shall be dead; I\n     can count the downward steps of my disease as clearly as though\n     they formed part of the actual stairway under my feet.\n\n     \"'And this also I know--that the message will reach you, my\n     brother; so far, at least, my eyes are permitted to explore the\n     advancing darkness. You will assuredly receive this letter, but\n     with what disposition of heart? That, alas! I may not know. Nor can\n     I give aught of service in either counsel or means; I must trust to\n     your love and good-will for everything. I can only say that the\n     girl is known to all in Doom as Mad Scarlett's daughter. She has\n     her father's tawny hair and red-brown eyes, and her name, as I have\n     already told you, is Esmay.\n\n     \"'To-morrow night I shall make my opportunity to reach the river\n     edge unobserved. I shall then commit to the current the bottle\n     containing this message, a precious freight, for it is my darling's\n     life and happiness.\n\n     \"'To you, my brother, the gift and the grace of God, according as\n     you deal with me and mine.\n                                  ELENA.\n\n            *       *       *       *       *\n\n     \"'Watch him whom they call Quinton Edge.'\"\n\n\n\"The date is a year ago, lacking a month,\" added Constans, as he handed\nthe roll to his uncle.\n\nMesser Hugolin tied up the document with a piece of tape, labelled it\nwith the date of receipt, and laid it away in a pigeon-hole.\n\n\"Well?\" said Constans, interrogatively.\n\n\"Do you want me to put myself within reach of the Gray Wolf's paws?\"\nretorted Messer Hugolin, shrewdly. \"I was flayed badly enough the last\ntime the _Black Swan_ cast anchor before Croye, and I am not paying\nbetween rent-days.\"\n\n\"The year is almost up,\" urged Constans, insistently.\n\n\"I have lived my life,\" returned the old man, with sombre fixity of\nresolve, \"and these things do not interest me. I have other use for my\nhands than to keep them stretched out idly in the dark.\"\n\n\"But that letter--a mother pleading for her child. You have but to give\nthe word--there are men who will go, and gladly.\"\n\n\"I doubt it not, for there are always drones a-plenty around a beehive.\nBut why should I spend my good, red gold to make a beggar's holiday?\"\n\nConstans felt his cheeks burn. \"Their blood is redder than your gold,\"\nhe said. \"And if they are not afraid to risk----\"\n\n\"What has cost them nothing and for whose loss there is quick repair in\na few square inches of sticking-plaster. Tush! boy, you speak of these\nthings as one who dreams visions at noonday. While I--what I know, I\nknow. There is but one thing precious in the world, and that is what a\nman holds safely in his strong-box. Why should I spend myself for\nnaught?\"\n\n\"The girl is your niece--your flesh and blood.\"\n\n\"No more so than yourself, nephew. And tell me, have I ever been\nover-tender with you on that account? Can you call to mind when and\nwhere I have spared you because you were of my kin? At least, I make a\nvirtue of my honesty.\"\n\nMesser Hugolin smiled. He saw from Constans's face that he need not plot\nout the thought in plainer words, and so they parted without further\nspeaking, although the blood throbbed in Constans's temples as he made\nobeisance and walked away. He was conscious that he must keep himself in\nhand; the stocks and the whipping-post were ever ready for the\nrebellious apprentice, and a single hasty act might imperil his whole\nfuture. But as he lay awake that night in his attic bedchamber he\nresolved that this should be his last week's work in Messer Hugolin's\ntan-pits. The time had come for him to make a second visit to Doom the\nForbidden, and to remain there for an indefinite period--until his work\nhad been accomplished.\n\nIt would have been impossible for Constans to have embarked upon this\nnew adventure were it not for the two small gold coins that he had found\nand carried away from Doom on the occasion of his former visit. It was\nagainst the common law of the land for a bound apprentice to possess any\nmoney, even a handful of copper pence. He had to be careful,\ntherefore, with whom he dealt, and he expected to be cheated in making\nhis bargain for a boat and a supply of provisions. As it was, he was\nskilfully skinned by the rascal with whom he finally ventured to open\nnegotiations, and Constans thought himself lucky to exchange it for a\nleaky, flat-bottomed tub and fifty pounds weight of absolute\nnecessaries, chiefly sun-dried strips of beef and parched grain.\n\n[Illustration: \"THEY PARTED WITHOUT FURTHER SPEAKING\"]\n\nHis personal belongings were not burdensome to transfer--the books, half\na dozen in all, his revolver and field-glass, and a good ash bow with\ntwelve dozen arrows, each bearing his private mark of a scarlet feather.\nThese last he had been at work upon through many a long evening in the\nlast two months, and he was sure that they would serve him well should\nneed arise. Clothing and blankets he did not trouble about, even with\nthe cold weather close at hand, for he could reckon certainly on finding\nabundant supplies of this nature in the city itself.\n\nOn the fourth night after the finding of the bottle Constans swung\nlightly out of his garret window. He cast one farewell glance at the\nshuttered windows of Messer Hugolin's office. Through a chink struggled\na feeble beam of pale, yellow light, but his uncle was poring,\ndoubtless, over his ledgers and had heard no sound. The wolf-hound Grip\nwagged his tail as Constans passed, and he patted his head, the one\nsingle creature in his uncle's household who might regret his absence on\nthe morrow. Now the way was clear; he stole off into the darkness,\nfinding no difficulty in scaling the wall, and so was free.\n\nThe night was misty and starless and the tide on a strong ebb. The\nvoyage down-stream was without incident, and by midnight he had landed\nwithin the city lines, but much farther up-town than upon the occasion\nof his first adventure. His plan was to seek some uninhabited house\nwithin convenient distance of the library building and make that his\ntemporary headquarters. He found what he wanted in the block immediately\nto the westward of the library, and in three or four trips he had\ntransported thither his stock of food and other impedimenta. The boat\nhad leaked badly on the way down the river, and was plainly unseaworthy.\nThere was no place in which to hide the craft, and to allow her to\nremain moored at the pier would be tantamount to announcing his arrival\nto the first sharp-eyed Doomsman who might chance to pass that way. So,\npushing her out into the current with a vigorous shove from his foot,\nConstans watched the little hull disappear in the darkness. Henceforth\nhe must depend entirely upon his own resources, inadequate as they were\nfor the task before him. But upon this phase of the situation he would\nnot allow himself to dwell. Such unprofitable meditation could breed\nnaught but irresolution and be unnerving to both body and mind; if he\nwere to play the coward now he but invited the fate he feared. Courage,\nthen, and forward!\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nTHE SISTERS\n\n\nA young girl sat before a magnificent fireplace of cut stone gazing into\nthe fire of drift-wood that burned diffidently upon a hearth whose\nspaciousness would have been more fittingly adorned by Vergil's \"no\nsmall part of a tree.\" Out-of-doors the snow was whirling down in small,\nfrozen flakes that the northwest gale ground into powder against the\ngranite walls and then sifted through every crack and crevice; not a\ndoor-sill or window-seat but wore its decoration of a pure white wreath.\nBitterly cold it had grown with the closing in of the dusk, and the girl\ndrew her cloak, a superb garment of Russian sables, closer about her\nshoulders and stretched out her hands to the dying blaze. Then she\nclapped them impatiently. A long interval and a middle-aged man answered\nthe summons--a servant, as the coarse quality of his clothing\nproclaimed. He shuffled across the floor, his big boots creaking\nunpleasantly.\n\n\"More wood, Ugo,\" said the girl, without looking around; \"and I do wish\nyou would grease your boots. It is unbearable the way you clatter\nabout.\"\n\n\"Grease my boots!\" echoed the man, with ironic emphasis. \"That is good\ncounsel, seeing there isn't enough lard in the house for the frying of\nan egg; yes, and no egg to fry.\"\n\nThe girl half turned, as though about to speak, then checked herself.\nUgo went on impertinently:\n\n\"I could see long ago how things were going, but, Lord, what was the use\nof breaking my heart over it! A dainty lip means a short purse-string,\nand a sick woman's fancy is a bottomless well. Let's have plain speaking\nabout this; it can't hurt any one now, and your mother----\"\n\nHe stopped short, disconcerted, for all his bravado, by the sudden glint\nof red that lit up the girl's eyes. Her hand plucked at the black ribbon\naround her throat; yet when she spoke her voice was clear and even.\n\n\"Never mind about my mother,\" she said, and the man kept sulky silence.\n\n\"Is it really true that there is no food in the house?\" she continued.\n\n\"There was never a rope made that hadn't an end,\" answered the servant,\nwith a trifle more of his former assurance. \"Not a scrap of bacon nor a\nhandful of flour in the larder; even the rats will tell you that. I saw\ntwo of them leaving to-day, and I've about made up my mind to follow\nthem.\"\n\nThe girl unlocked a drawer in the teak-wood table that stood at her\nelbow, and took from it a leathern thong some eight inches in length and\nknotted together at the ends, a purse-string in common parlance. Upon it\nwere strung three of the thin brass tokens pierced in the centre by a\nsquare hole that were in ordinary use among the Doomsmen as currency,\nredeemable against the material supplies on hand in the public\nstorehouses.\n\nThe girl untied the thong and let the coins fall upon the table. She\npushed them over to the fellow with a gesture superbly indifferent.\n\n\"Go now,\" she said, curtly. The man Ugo pocketed the money with a\ndarkening face and turned to depart. At the door he hesitated, making as\nthough he would say a final word. But the girl cut him short.\n\n\"Go!\" she reiterated, and he had no choice but to obey.\n\n\"I should have been in peril of having my ear nicked,\" he said, under\nhis breath, as he crossed the threshold. \"It's just as well that I kept\nmy tongue between my teeth and concluded not to mind Quinton Edge's\nbusiness.\" He closed the door.\n\nIt had grown quite dark, and the fire was making its last stand for\nlife. Only one small piece of wood remained unconsumed, and the flame\nlicked at it lazily, like a beast of prey hanging over a carcass, gorged\nto repletion and yet unwilling to give over employment so delicious.\nSuddenly the girl rose to her feet and went to one of the long windows\nthat looked out upon the street. The casement shook and rattled under\nthe gale's rough hand. Hardly knowing what she did, she flung the window\nwide open.\n\nIn an instant she seemed to have been transported into the midst of the\ntumult, her face lashed by windy whips, her eyes blinded by fine\nparticles of frozen snow, her ears deafened by the multitudinous voices\nof the storm sprites shrieking to their fellows. Something in her\nnature, fierce and untamed, leaped forth to meet the tempest.\nIntoxicated by the strong wine of its fury, she flung out her arms, half\nfearing, half hoping that she might be swept away, whirled like some\nwild sea-bird, into the heart of the madness. A strong hand pulled her\nback.\n\n\"Esmay!\" shrieked a voice in her ear. \"Esmay!\"\n\nLoudly as the call must have been uttered, it came to her, as though\nfrom a great distance, thin and of an infinite littleness. Yet she\nallowed herself to be drawn back into the room, and made no demur to the\nclosing of the window.\n\nIt was a tall, finely built woman of thirty or thereabouts who stood\nbeside her--a woman with a dark, passionate face shaded by a mop of\nraven hair as coarse as a horse's mane. \"Esmay!\" she said again, with an\naccent of wondering reproach.\n\nThe girl stood silent, motionless for a moment; then, with a swift\nintake of her breath:\n\n\"Don't be angry, Nanna, but something is going to happen. I've got to\nlaugh or to cry--I don't know which.\"\n\nIt was a laugh, low but genuine, and full of a silver trickle of sound.\nThe elder woman caught up the girl impetuously into a close embrace.\n\n\"My dear! my dear! is it really you? I can't believe it. After these\ndreadful three months in which you have hardly said as many words. It\nwould be a miracle, if there were any saints in Doom to work one.\"\n\nShe drew away for a moment, her eyes ablaze with excitement. There was a\nsmooth, graceful strength in her every movement that was almost\nanimal-like; she suggested the idea of a big cat as she alternately\nreleased the girl and then returned, in a half-circle, to take renewed\npossession of her. \"A miracle!\" she repeated.\n\n\"Indeed, it almost needed that to bring me to myself,\" said the girl,\ngravely. \"But now I see things clearly; it seems almost as though the\nmother herself had stood beside me and drawn the veil away. It was Ugo,\nthough, who really did it,\" she added, and laughed again softly.\n\n\"Ugo!\" echoed the other, indignantly. \"And, if you please, where is the\nfellow? The candles have not been lighted, the fire is dying out, and\nnot a sign of supper visible. It is unbearable, Esmay, and he shall pack\nthis very night.\"\n\n\"But Nanna!\"\n\n\"I won't listen to a word.\"\n\n\"You will. He has gone already.\"\n\nShe pushed the elder woman into a chair. \"Now don't dare to move until I\nam back with wood and a light. Not a word, sister mine--if you love me.\"\nTaken by surprise, Nanna let her go, and sat waiting.\n\nThe girl returned in a few minutes with a basket containing several\nlumps of sea-coal.\n\n\"This is a thousand times better than Ugo's boards and barrel-staves,\"\nsaid Esmay, triumphantly, and transferred the fuel to the hearth, where\nit presently burst into a cheerful flame. \"There are three or four boxes\nof the stuff in the cellar, enough to last us all winter. Now for the\nlamp.\"\n\nOn the mantel-piece stood a shallow dish containing a small quantity of\ncotton-seed oil and a piece of lampwick. Esmay took down the vessel and\ninspected it with a calculating eye. \"It will last until bedtime,\" she\nannounced, and lit it with a spill of paper.\n\nNanna looked at her half-sister questioningly, but did not offer to\nspeak. She had never seen Esmay just like this, and the change was\nespecially noticeable after the silence and apathy of the past months.\nHer thoughts travelled back to the human link that had united them for\nso long--the woman whom each had called mother, although to Nanna it had\nbeen only a step-relationship. How impossible it had once seemed that\nthere could be any new adjustment of life's machinery; how difficult the\nrealization that nature is accustomed to settle these matters in her own\ntime and way, and invariably does so! Yet here was Esmay suddenly\nreturned to herself, moving about, alert and eager, knitting her brows\nover the one important problem of the moment, the question of supper.\n\n\"You'll have to make out with the firelight for a little while,\" said\nEsmay, picking up the rude lamp. \"But you won't mind, dear?\" She\nstooped, kissed her sister, and was gone again.\n\nThe elder woman felt her eyes brimming saltily. The girl, so far as\nyears were concerned, might almost have been her daughter, since Nanna\nhad been both wife and widow at seventeen. For all that, the sisterly\nrelation was the true one between them; they were of the same strong\nbreed, even if Esmay were only in half a daughter of the Doomsmen. Nanna\nhad never been able to forget that her father's second wife had been of\nthe blood of the despised House People. In spite of herself she had\nlearned to love the dead Elena; she adored Esmay as a part of herself. A\nprimitive emotion, but then Nanna was the elemental woman.\n\nWhen Esmay returned she brought with her a bowl containing a small\nquantity of cottage cheese, hard and yellow with age. Surmounting the\nbowl was a plate upon which were some crusts of bread and a knuckle of\nham, the latter being little more than the bare bone. A table stood in\nthe middle of the room, a handsome piece of buhl-work. Esmay drew it\nforward to the fire and proceeded to arrange her feast. Scanty enough it\nseemed, but the cloth covering the table was of the finest damask, the\nplates that she took from a glazed cabinet were of the precious china of\nS\u00e8vres, the knives and forks were in solid silver, and the drinking-cups\nof silver-gilt had been fashioned by a great artist. A strange contrast!\nbeggar's fare served so royally; but hunger is not nice about trifles\none way or the other. And so it was upon the viands that Nanna's\nattention was immediately concentrated. She glanced suspiciously at the\ncheese, despairingly at the knuckle-bone, and then said, solemnly:\n\n\"Tell me, Esmay, what does it mean? Where is Ugo?\"\n\n\"Ugo has deserted us--like the rats,\" answered the girl. \"And the\nsituation--it is just this.\" She stopped and took a swallow of water.\n\"It is three months now since she--the mother--slipped away from our\narms, and of course the pension stopped with her. I gave the last\nhandful of tokens to Ugo to settle up his wages. So you see I'm a\nbeggar. It's a woman against the world, and one of us will have to\ndevour the other. Lucky, isn't it, that I woke up desperately hungry?\nThat means that I'll make a fight for it. Have the first bite.\"\n\n\"Esmay! You know that I have still my widow's rate.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I also know that it is barely enough to keep one body and soul\ntogether; the two of us would only starve by inches. No use, Nanna, we\nmust take things as we find them. But isn't it strange--\" She stopped\nabruptly and let her glance wander over the luxurious table-service, the\ngleaming surface of the silver reflecting her troubled eyes. She went on\nslowly:\n\n\"All this meant something once--this array of silver and jewelled glass,\nthe tapestries on the walls, the fur cloak about my shoulders. Think of\nit, Nanna! These things must have been the envied treasures of the rich,\nthe luxuries of life. And now any one may possess them who cares to\nfight their battle with moth and rust.\"\n\n\"While a single one of Dom Gillian's brass tokens outweighs it all,\"\nrejoined Nanna, nodding her head wisely. \"It is not hard to understand\nwhy, for with the token any one may buy a quarterweight of flour at the\npublic stores or a fore-shoulder of mutton.\"\n\n\"And bread and meat mean life, don't they? Well, and suppose one doesn't\nhappen to possess a long purse-string laden with these wonderful,\nmiracle-working bits of token-money, what then? A woman can't put on a\nquilted coat and steel cap and go out with the raiders to earn her share\nof the loot. Fancy my teaching a fat House-dweller how to dance on a\nred-hot plate or riding the toll roads of the West Inch in a jacket full\nof arrow-holes.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" agreed Nanna, gravely.\n\nEsmay rose and walked excitedly up and down the long room.\n\n\"It's just hopeless, Nanna, to stay on here in this city of the dead.\"\n\nShe stopped and faced her sister.\n\n\"So I have decided; I am going back to my mother's people. There is a\nchance in their world for a woman to secure her own living; here she\ncan only starve or accept some man's protection.\"\n\nThe elder woman remonstrated feebly, but the girl swept her aside.\n\n\"Listen to me, Nanna. You know that Messer Hugolin, Councillor Primus of\nCroye, is my uncle, my mother's own brother. She ever insisted that in\nhis charity I had a final resource. He might not offer it, but surely he\ncould not deny me, if I sought it. Nanna, you recall what the mother\nherself said--how she always believed that the message would reach him.\nMy own uncle and Councillor Primus of Croye,\" she concluded, hopefully.\n\nBut Nanna was not to be so easily convinced. \"But, Esmay, it is\nimpossible,\" she exclaimed. \"You could never escape from Doom.\"\n\n\"But I will.\"\n\n\"You cannot. The High Bridge to the north is always guarded, and on the\nother three sides of the city there is deep water.\"\n\n\"I shall manage it,\" returned the girl, confidently. \"It is simply a\nquestion of my going empty-handed to my uncle's house. Now gold among\nthe House-dwellers has a value that it does not possess with us; so Ulick\nonce told me. They use it as money.\"\n\n\"Here in Doom it is nothing,\" assented Nanna, \"save that we women like\nthe pretty things that the ancients fashioned from it.\"\n\n\"Precisely; and as you know there is not much of it in existence, even\nhere in Doom, where silver is almost as common as iron.\"\n\n\"Well, and then?\"\n\n\"Don't you see? If only golden tongues could plead my cause in Croye I\nshould be independent, even of my uncle Hugolin. Now there is store of\nthis gold somewhere in Doom. It must be so, for the war-galleys always\ncarry a money-chest when they sail to the northern colonies.\"\n\n\"A treasure,\" said Nanna, slowly. \"Who would know of it here in Doom?\nDom Gillian himself--or perhaps----\"\n\n\"Master Quinton Edge,\" supplied Esmay, and thereupon silence fell\nbetween them.\n\nThe minutes passed away. Then, suddenly, Esmay stopped in her monotonous\npacing of the room and flung herself on her knees by her sister's chair.\n\n\"You goose!\" she exclaimed, with tender suspicion. \"I believe you have\nbeen crying.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" returned Nanna, sitting bolt upright and staring hard\nat the ceiling. \"I only want you to be sure and let me know before you\ngo. Or couldn't you take me with you?\" she added, wistfully, as though\nthe idea had but just occurred to her.\n\n\"Why, Nanna, as though I could have dreamed of anything else! Go without\nyou! Don't you see yourself how ridiculous that would be?\"\n\n\"Then nothing else matters,\" said Nanna, comfortably, and openly wiped\nher eyes. \"When do you want to go--to-night?\"\n\n\"Foolish one! But then you love me, and I can forgive you. Now let me be\nquiet; I want to think out my--our plan.\"\n\nNanna left the room softly. Esmay sat looking into the fire, her small,\nfirm chin propped in her palm. So violent was the storm that she did not\nhear the opening and closing of the street-door, but the flickering of\nthe lamp in the swirl of a current from the outer air warned her that\nshe had a visitor. She recognized him instantly as he came forward, his\nlaced hat in the hollow of his arm. There was no one in Doom besides\nMaster Quinton Edge who bowed with so easy a grace--a woman has a quick\neye for such trifles.\n\n\"You are Esmay, daughter of Mad Scarlett,\" he began, gently. \"My\nintrusion is unseasonable, perhaps, but none the less unavoidable.\"\n\nThe girl made no answer.\n\n\"I will speak to the point,\" he went on. \"Are you ready to make choice,\nto-night, between young Ulick and his oafish cousin Boris? I have a\nreason for asking, believe me.\"\n\nEsmay flushed with annoyance. \"I will not listen to either of them,\" she\nsaid. \"Boris I detest, and Ulick is only a boy, and a silly one; I have\ntold him so a score of times.\"\n\n\"I thought as much, but I wanted the confirmation of your own lips, my\ndear child. The knowledge emboldens me to offer you an asylum under my\nown roof for the next few months--or longer. Ulick, as you say, is but a\nboy, half hot, half muddle-head. He, perhaps, could be kept in\ncheck----\"\n\n\"I can manage that sufficiently well,\" broke in the girl, haughtily.\n\n\"No doubt, no doubt; but with Boris also in the field the situation\nbecomes a complicated one. Accordingly, I have concluded to offer you my\nassistance in dealing with it.\"\n\n\"It is difficult to think of Master Quinton Edge in the light of a\ndisinterested adviser. Perhaps you have other motives.\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" returned the man, with calm assurance. \"Why not a dozen of\nthem? But to disclose them--this is not the time. You have only to\naccept my offer and be thankful.\"\n\n\"Suppose that I refuse?\"\n\nQuinton Edge glanced over his shoulder, and the three men who had been\nstanding motionless in the shadow of the doorway took a step forward.\n\n\"You perceive that there is no such alternative,\" he said, suavely.\n\nThe girl started but kept herself in hand. \"My sister goes with me?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Quinton Edge.\n\nBut Nanna's arms were already encircling her treasure. She had entered\nunobserved, and she had heard enough to understand. \"You!\" she said, and\nspat at Quinton Edge.\n\nThe man's face paled. He stepped forward as though making to push the\nintruder away. In a flash she had turned upon him and her teeth closed\nupon the fleshy part of his right hand. He shook her off as one does a\nsnake.\n\n\"A true forest-cat,\" said Quinton Edge, and smiled as he twisted a fine\nlawn handkerchief about the wounded member. Then, with entire\ngood-humor: \"I apologize for my incivility and truth; it were a biting\nrejoinder. Madam, you, too, are welcome to my poor house. With such a\ndragon in the garden, he will be a brave man indeed who thinks to filch\nmy apples.\"\n\nNanna, huddled up in a corner of the room whither she had been flung,\nanswered not a word, but watched him steadily, unwinkingly, her eyes\nnarrowed to two gleaming slits. Esmay went over and assisted her to her\nfeet.\n\n\"You will give us time to get a few things together,\" said the girl,\nturning to Quinton Edge. \"A woman cannot be moved about like a piece of\nfurniture.\"\n\n\"Ten minutes.\"\n\nIt were waste of breath to renew the argument, and within the quarter of\nan hour the two women, closely shawled and veiled, descended the steps\nto the street. It was still storming. A coach drawn by two horses was\nwaiting at the curb, and the Doomsman, having assisted his unwilling\nguests to mount within, took his place on the box with the driver, the\nthree men following on horseback. The little company moved slowly down\nthe avenue; then, turning into a side thoroughfare, proceeded directly\neastward.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nTHE HEDGE OF ARROWS\n\n\nFor the first few days following upon his arrival in the city, Constans\nkept under rover, venturing forth only after nightfall. He wanted to\nmake sure of all his bearings before taking any long step in advance,\nand the extent and strength of the enemy's defences particularly\ninterested him. Fortunately for his purpose the weather was growing\ncolder every day, autumn having given place to winter much earlier than\nusual, and on these chilly nights the Doomsmen were not inclined to\nwander far abroad. By keeping closely to the side streets he ran but\nlittle risk of discovery through a chance encounter; at the same time he\nmust get inside the danger zone if he hoped to obtain any information of\nvalue.\n\nConstans found the solution of his problem by betaking himself to the\nhouse-tops. Through the aid of a rope, furnished with cross-pieces\ninserted in the strands at regular intervals and a grappling-hook at the\nfree end, he could pass easily from roof to roof of contiguous\nbuildings, and so gain points of observation that otherwise he would\nnever have dared to approach.\n\nOne of these a\u00ebrial routes led from the side avenue on the east to a\nmoderate-sized building situated on the Citadel Square and directly\noverlooking the fortress. Twice now he had ventured to spend the whole\nof a day lying perdue in this convenient eyrie, his binoculars in\nconstant use, and what he saw and learned increased his thoughtfulness,\nalthough he would not let it shake his resolution.\n\nSo far as he could judge, the Doomsmen could not be regarded as\nformidable through mere weight of numbers. Their available fighting\nforce Constans estimated at two hundred, which would indicate a total\npopulation of a round thousand. Now Croye alone was a city of full\nfifteen hundred inhabitants, and the census of the West Inch should show\ntwice that number. In an open field, and man to man, the House-dwellers\nwere much more than a match for Dom Gillian's wolves.\n\nOn the other hand, the Doomsmen were all trained warriors, and to smoke\nthem out of their own nest--one would have to think twice about that.\nHere was a half-ruined city, several square miles in actual area, and\nsurrounded by unfordable tidal rivers. Deep at its heart was the\ncitadel, strongly built and abundantly supplied with water and\nprovisions. Under these circumstances it was a simple matter for a small\nforce to maintain itself indefinitely; it would necessitate the\nemployment of an attacking army four or five times as large as the\ndefence to even up the chances. This, of course, on the presumption that\nboth sides were armed alike. Constans's thoughts reverted to the fire\nartillery of the ancients; with that at his disposal he would hold the\nbalance of power. The possession of a single score of rifles should\nenable him to demonstrate the feasibility of the attempt to his\nsluggard kinsmen, the Stockaders, and to the even more reluctant\ntownsmen. He determined to take the first opportunity to make a careful\nsearch of the city armories and ammunition depots; in the mean time, it\nwas his business to acquaint himself as thoroughly as possible with the\nmaterial situation.\n\nThe stronghold of the Doomsmen occupied the middle section of the\nancient city square. In shape it was an irregular oblong, the original\nbuilders being apparently content to enclose sufficient space without\nreference to architectural symmetry. Its perimeter might be roughly\nestimated at eight hundred yards, respectable proportions, and\nindicating a capacity to comfortably accommodate the whole population of\nDoom should the necessity arise.\n\nThe barricade was constructed of stone, principally paving-blocks torn\nup from the adjoining streets, and since the material was unlimited in\nquantity the walls were of massive proportions, sixteen feet in height\nand nearly six feet in thickness at the bottom course. At the several\ncorners stood towers elevated some ten feet above the wall veil and\nproperly loop-holed. Under the east and south walls and virtually built\ninto them were a series of huts, which served as storehouses and for\nliving quarters in time of siege. At present these huts--low,\nuncomfortable-looking structures of stone and roofed with broad, flat\nflags--were untenanted save for the two or three used by the small\ngarrison on duty. The western side of the enclosure was occupied almost\nentirely by storehouses for grain and other provisions; here, too, were\npens for cattle on the hoof and immense cisterns for the storage of\ndrinking-water. Somewhat to the south of the centre of the square stood\nwhat appeared to be the administration building, a round, tower-like\nstructure, three stories in height and with enormously thick walls. One\ncould fancy it the scene of a last stand in a lost cause.\n\nDirectly opposite, in the north wall, was the gateway. It opened on to\nthe Palace Road, one of the principal avenues of the ancient city, and\nwas in the form of a vaulted passageway defended by flanking towers and\nsuperimposed battlements. A notable stronghold was this citadel of the\nDoomsmen, wisely planned and well built, and Constans could hardly fall\ninto the error of under-estimating its resources. For all that, he would\nnot acknowledge that it was impregnable; stone walls cannot stand\nforever against stout hearts.\n\nDay by day went on and Constans kept adding steadily to his stock of\ninformation. Most important of all, he had succeeded in definitely\nlocating the several positions of the enemy. It appeared that the\ndistrict actually inhabited by the Doomsmen included only the fortified\nsquare and a few of the city blocks contiguous to it on the north. The\ndistance from the citadel to the library building and Dom Gillian's\nhouse was about a mile, and it was some five miles further to the tidal\nestuary which formed the northern boundary of the city proper. Of the\nvarious structures that had formerly spanned the stream, but one, the\nHigh Bridge, remained. Built of massive masonry, it had wonderfully\nresisted the disintegrating processes of time, and stood to-day,\nimmovable as the granite hills of which it formed the connecting link.\nBeing the sole means of landward approach to Doom, it was guarded\ncarefully, and a detail from the general garrison was at all times on\nduty there.\n\nThe final conclusion to which Constans arrived was that he had only to\navoid the immediate neighborhood of the Palace Road and the Citadel\nSquare to pursue his investigations with entire safety. Accordingly he\ngrew venturesome, and began to go out-of-doors at all hours of the day\nor night. And then on the fourteenth day after his arrival in the city\nhis immunity came abruptly to an end.\n\nIt was early in the forenoon, and Constans was exploring a quarter of\nthe city that lay to the northeast of the Citadel Square. He became\ninterested in the curious, bridgelike structure which spanned the\nstreet; enough of it remained standing to show him that it had been\ndesigned for overhead traffic, a highway in the air. There were the\nrails, the signal-boxes, and other mysterious adjuncts of the ancient\nrailways; he had read about them in his books and he recognized them at\nonce.\n\nNow this particular section of the a\u00ebrial railway must have been a\nbranch line, for it ended abruptly in front of a building of unusual\nsize and consequent importance. Beyond this again could be seen a\nsurface net-work of iron rails converging to the black mouth of a great\ntunnel--a highway under the earth. Constans felt a lively impulse to\npush his explorations further. This was evidently a terminal station of\nthe wonderful steel roads of the ancients; within the building itself he\nmight reasonably expect to find some of the old-time engines and wagons\nwith which the traffic had been carried on.\n\nPassing through a central hall of fine proportions, Constans found\nhimself standing under an immense arched structure of stone and iron and\nglass. The ancient car-shed, so Constans conjectured; then he paused\nexcitedly before a long platform, at which stood a complete train, made\nup and ready to start.\n\nConstans examined this new find with critical attention. The enormous\nlocomotive-engine, with its driving-wheels that stood higher than a\nman's head, impressed him mightily, for all that the monster's burning\nheart had grown cold and its stentor breathing had been hushed forever.\nHe climbed into the cab and wondered hugely at the multiplicity of\nstopcocks and levers and cabalistically lettered dials. It seemed\nincredible that the giant could have moved even his own weight, and yet\nthere was his appointed task strung out behind him, fifteen long and\nheavy vehicles--it was amazing!\n\nBehind the engine came the cars for luggage, piled high with bags and\nboxes, and then the regular train equipment, a long line of coaches.\nThese last were of the most luxurious pattern--that was plain to see,\nalthough the varnish had blistered on the panels and the silken curtains\nat the windows hung in tatters. The last car of all had clearly been in\nservice as an eating apartment, and fortunately the doors of this coach\nhad been left closed and the windows remained intact. Constans entered\nand looked about him, noting that the tables still bore their weight of\nplate and china and napery. Most moving of all was the little nosegay\nthat stood in a tall glass at each cover. But even as he gazed,\ndelighted that the flowers still retained recognizable shape, they broke\nand crumbled into nothingness.\n\nIt was difficult to understand why the train should have been abandoned,\nit being evident that it had stood here, ready for immediate departure,\nbut the unquestionable fact may serve to emphasize again the suddenness\nof the final catastrophe. People had simply dropped and forgotten\neverything. In the extremity of terror civilized man had become a\nsavage, reverting to primeval instincts in preferring his legs to any\nother means of escape. There was but one thing left for him--to run\naway.\n\nIt was a depressing experience to be standing solitary and alone under\nthese vast arches that had echoed to the tramp of feet innumerable. A\nsense of his loneliness pressed heavily upon Constans; then, suddenly,\nhe became aware of the presence of a man, who stood leaning against a\npillar a short distance away and watched him from under close-knit\nbrows.\n\nThe fair hair and frank, kindly face seemed dimly familiar to Constans;\nand what thighs and breadth of shoulder! The stranger stood little short\nof gianthood, and Constans would have run small chance against him as\nman to man. Bitterly he regretted having left his bow behind; even his\ndouble-edged hunting-knife was missing from his belt.\n\nThe man walked deliberately forward to meet him. Certainly his dress and\nequipment proclaimed him a Doomsman, and by the same token he must have\nrecognized that Constans was an alien. Yet he smiled and held out his\nhand as he came up.\n\n\"It is Constans, of course; for who else among the House People would\ndare to cross the Gray Wolf's threshold. Do you not remember Ulick?\"\n\nThe two young men shook hands heartily, albeit a certain constraint was\nimmediately to fall upon them. For Constans could not be unmindful of\nhis purpose, and Ulick was a true Doomsman, and hatred of the\nHouse-dweller was the first article in his hereditary creed. The\ninheritance of a naked sword lay between them. Was it not inevitable\nthat one or the other of them should be moved to take it up?\n\nIt was Constans who realized that only frankness could save the\nsituation, and as they walked along he told Ulick the full story of the\nenmity between him and Quinton Edge, then of the years of his\napprenticeship to his Uncle Hugolin, and of the message in the bottle\nthat had served to crystallize desire into action. The purport of the\nletter was still fresh in his mind, and he repeated it as nearly as he\ncould word for word.\n\n\"Esmay, did you say?\" interrupted Ulick. \"It was Esmay who helped me\ntrap you. Don't you remember her eyes, brown and with a flame in them\nlike to the carbuncles in the bracelet that I gave her? Elena was her\nmother.\"\n\nConstans assented, indifferently. In truth, he had entirely forgotten\nabout the girl.\n\n\"Ten days ago she disappeared,\" said Ulick, gloomily, \"and not a trace\nof her have I been able to discover. Yet I believe that your friend\nQuinton Edge could tell me if he would.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Nor does anybody else. For all that, I am sure that he does not want\nher for himself; no woman has ever been able to boast that Master\nQuinton Edge looked at her twice. Were it otherwise I think I should go\nmad.\"\n\nConstans shrugged his shoulders impatiently; then he looked up and saw\nthe pain in the big fellow's face. It touched him, although he could not\ncomprehend the weakness (for such it seemed to him), that had given it\nbirth.\n\n\"If you could see her, you would understand,\" continued Ulick, as though\ndivining his thought. Again they walked along in silence. Constans broke\nit abruptly:\n\n\"And your grandsire, is he still living? I can see him yet, that\nterrible old man who wanted to cut out my eyes and tongue so that you\ncould have a new toy.\"\n\nUlick smiled, and the current of his darker mood was diverted.\n\n\"Lucky for you that he fell asleep again before he could give the order\nfor the irons to be heated. And so we ran away trembling, and I brought\nyou to the vault underneath the sidewalk--do you remember?\"\n\n\"I remember,\" said Constans, briefly.\n\n\"He is living still; think how old he must be! Nowadays he sleeps nearly\nall the time; sometimes for a week on end he will not leave his couch in\nthe darkened room. Then again he will have himself apparelled and his\ngreat sword girded upon him, and he will come down into the court-yard\nand walk in the sun for hours. You should see those lazy rascals of\nguardsmen scatter at the first sight of him--like mice running to their\nholes when puss begins to yawn and stretch herself.\"\n\n\"You are still the heir?\"\n\n\"Yes, unless the council sees fit to set my rights aside in favor of my\ncousin Boris. To tell the truth, neither of us is fit to be chief in\nDoom while Quinton Edge lives.\"\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\n\"Why, you see, Boris is a brute whose brains, such as he has, are always\nfuddled with ale. And I----\" Ulick stopped and laughed a little\nsheepishly.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Frankly, then, I don't want to carry the weight of the wolf-skin; I\nshould feel like a man buried up to his neck in sand. I dreamed of that\nthe other night, and how a raven that had Quinton Edge's face came and\npecked at my eyes.\"\n\n\"Then you really don't care,\" commented Constans, shrewdly.\n\n\"No; except to have my fair share of the fighting and feasting--and, of\ncourse, Esmay.\"\n\nConstans laughed. \"You always come back to the girl.\"\n\n\"How could it be otherwise, since I love her?\" said Ulick, simply.\n\nConstans grew sober again. \"Strange that it should be the same man,\nQuinton Edge, for whom we are both seeking. I can see, however, that my\narrow must not leave the string until first you have had speech with\nhim.\"\n\n\"But that is just what I cannot do,\" returned Ulick, with a frown. \"It\nis a week now that any one has seen him, and yet neither galley nor\ntroop has left the city since the new moon.\"\n\n\"He must show himself in time; we have only to wait.\"\n\n\"Waiting! it is the one thing----\"\n\n\"Yet you must; the chance is certain to come. Only, if I help you in\nthis, then afterwards when you have learned what you want----\"\n\nUlick nodded. \"Do what you will, but until then it is Esmay who stands\nfirst, and he lives under her shadow.\"\n\nThe young men had been walking in the direction of the Citadel Square,\nand the time had come for Constans to decide whether or not he should\ngive Ulick his full confidence. Yesterday he had moved all his\nbelongings to a large building on the south side of the square\noverlooking the fortress, and he was minded to establish himself there\npermanently. It might seem foolhardy for him to take up his abode, not\nunder, indeed, but just above the noses of his enemies; in reality, he\nwas as safe in one place as in another. Here was an immense building,\ncontaining literally hundreds of apartments; it was like being in a\nrabbit-warren, a labyrinth of passages and rooms that it would take a\nregiment to explore. He had only to observe reasonable prudence in\nentering and leaving his lair to be assured against the ordinary risks\nof discovery, and he depended, too, upon the obvious negligence of the\nsentinels. It was a simple application of the principle that what is\nnearest to the eye is oftenest overlooked.\n\nFor where he stood he could see the huge bulk of the sky-scraper\ntowering into the blue. The building had been constructed upon a narrow,\ntriangular plot of land, and its ground-plan bore a fanciful resemblance\nto the shape of a flat-iron. Its acute angle was pointed towards them;\none compared it instinctively to the prow of some gigantic ship of stone\nploughing its way through billows of brick and mortar.\n\n\"Come,\" said Constans, and Ulick, understanding the confidence about to\nbe reposed in him, followed silently.\n\nIt was a small front-room on the third floor that Constans had fitted up\nas his abode, and after Ulick had passed approving judgment upon his\nfriend's domestic arrangement they walked over to the window and stood\nthere looking down into the thoroughfare upon which the building faced.\nFormerly this open space had been paved with small oblong blocks of\nstone, but these had long since been incorporated with the walls of the\nfortress, and in their stead was a stretch of thick, short turf. Pacing\nslowly along, there came in sight the figure of a man, his head bent\ndown and his hands clasped behind his back. Constans recognized him\ninstantly, even before Ulick's eager whisper had reached his ear. It was\nQuinton Edge.\n\nConstans knew that he was doing a foolish thing, but the humor of the\nmoment gripped him, and he yielded to it. To make sport of this\ninsolent, and so wipe out, in some measure, the memory of his own\nhumiliation--the temptation was too great to be resisted, and the next\ninstant the bowstring twanged and an arrow plunged into the ground, a\nscant yard in front of Quinton Edge, and stuck there quivering.\nInvoluntarily, the Doomsman stepped back and another arrow grazed his\nheel; a half turn to the right and a third shaft sheared the curling\nostrich-plume from his hat. A fourth arrow to the left of him, and then\nQuinton Edge understood. He drew himself up and stood still while a\ndozen more skilfully directed bolts winged their way to complete the\nbarbed circle that hemmed him in. And each missile bore its individual\nmessage to his memory--a tiny tuft of scarlet inserted in the\nfeathering.\n\nQuinton Edge waited an instant or so, as though out of pure politeness,\nthen turned and faced the great building that towered mountainously\nabove his head. There were hundreds of window openings in the tremendous\nfa\u00e7ade of the \"Flat-iron,\" and he had no means of guessing the precise\none in whose deep embrasure his enemy stood concealed; at any moment he\nmight expect the final shaft striking home to his heart and staining its\nfeathering all crimson in his life blood. Yet there was no hint of\nperturbation in the affected languor of his voice; he bowed slightly and\nspoke:\n\n\"What a sorry marksman! See! I will give you a final chance to hit the\ngold. Make the most of it, for here in Doom no man's hair grows long\nenough to hide a nicked ear.\"\n\nHe threw back his cloak of crimson cloth and unbuttoned the white,\nruffled shirt that he wore underneath, exposing his naked throat and\nbreast. And not an eyelash quivered, while he stood there for the space\nin which one might count a score slowly.\n\n\"As you please, then,\" he continued, readjusting his garments with\npunctilious care. \"I must warn you, however, that standing so long in\nthis chilly air may mean the influenza for me. By the Shining One! if we\nkeep on like this the interest due on our little account is likely to\nexceed in amount the original principal. That would be a pity as\nhappening between gentlemen, who know naturally nothing of what they\ncall business and have no desire to cheat each other.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"AN INSTANT LATER THE BOWSTRING TWANGED\"]\n\nThen he laughed heartily, unaffectedly. \"What a comedy! and you and I\ncast for the fools in it. Which is the bigger one neither of us should\nbe willing to say. And for the best of reasons, we don't know. My\ncompliments, brother imbecile, and so good-day.\"\n\nQuinton Edge doffed his hat as though to intimate that the interview was\nat an end, then stepped lightly across the hedge of arrows and proceeded\nat an even pace to the eastern angle of the fortress, around which he\ndisappeared.\n\nUlick's eyes were sparkling as he turned to Constans.\n\n\"He is at least a man,\" he said, half proudly, half enviously.\n\nBut Constans only set his teeth the harder. \"I could have gone out, met\nhim face to face and killed him,\" he said, sombrely, \"only for you and\nyour Esmay.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nGODS IN EXILE\n\n\nFebruary, and a full three months since Constans had come to Doom. And\nyet he was virtually at his starting-point, so little had he been able\nto accomplish along the line of his purpose. A dozen times indeed he\nmight have planted an arrow between the delicately shrugged shoulders of\nMaster Quinton Edge as he strolled, of a sunshiny morning, along the\nPalace Road, surrounded by his little body-guard of flatterers and\npolitical courtiers. But such an act would have stained his honor\nwithout fully satisfying his vengeance; he did not want to strike until\nhe should know where it would hurt the most.\n\nIt had been Ulick always who had stood in the road; Ulick with his\neternal lamentations over the maid Esmay. Together they had searched for\nher in every possible quarter. But where was one to look first in this\nwilderness of stone? It would have been an obvious procedure to have\nkept close watch upon the movements of Quinton Edge, whose complicity\nwas a matter of reasonable suspicion. But the first attempts at\nshadowing him had resulted in nothing, and early in December the _Black\nSwan_, with Quinton Edge himself in command, had left her moorings in\nthe Greater river, bound doubtless on some piratical expedition.\n\nIt was an added aggravation of Constans's impatience that Ulick himself\nwas ordered away at the end of January. He had been drafted to take part\nin a raid, and since the route of the proposed foray led far to the\nsouthward he would probably be absent for a considerable time. It would\ntake a fortnight's hard riding for the band to reach the distant colony\nagainst which the attack had been planned, and fully six weeks would be\nrequired in which to drive the cattle home. Two full months, then, and\nas yet only one had passed; the returning raiders would not cross the\nHigh Bridge much before the first day in April.\n\nAs the weeks went heavily on, Constans, in spite of his philosophy,\nbegan to fret and chafe. He could put in a part of each day in the\nlibrary poring over his books and digging out the ancient wisdom from\nthe printed page by sheer force of will. But there always came a time\nwhen only physical exertion would have any effect in dispelling the\nmental disquietude that possessed him, and then he would throw aside his\nbooks and walk the empty streets for hours.\n\nThe weather continued bad, bitter cold alternating with storms of rain\nand sleet. Towards the end of January the snow came in earnest: it lay a\nfoot deep on the level, and the Doomsmen, after their custom, kept\nclosely within doors. Constans would occasionally note a few fresh\ntracks along the Palace Road, and the smoke that curled steadily from\nscattered chimney-pots and the bivouac fires on the Citadel Square might\nbe taken as evidence that the suspension of social activities was only\ntemporary. But for the present, at least, Constans had the city to\nhimself, and he wandered about as he chose without a thought of\npossible danger.\n\nAn anxiously longed-for discovery was the reward of one of these lonely\nexcursions. In a shop that had once been devoted to the sale of\nfire-arms, Constans found a quantity of ammunition of a caliber that\nwould fit the chambers of his revolver. The cartridges had been packed\nin hermetically sealed cases, presumably for export-shipment or upon a\nspecial order. However that might be, the precaution had prevented the\ndeterioration of the powder, and the ammunition was consequently, in\ncondition for use. Constans nerved himself to make the experiment, but\nalthough his studies had made him well acquainted with the theory of the\nexplosive projectile, he had to summon all his resolution for the actual\npulling of the trigger.\n\nThe detonation that followed startled him out of his self-possession. He\ndropped the pistol, and was out of the shop and half way across the\nstreet before he could recover himself. Then, ashamed of his cowardice,\nhe forced himself to pick up the weapon and went forward to examine the\ntwo-inch plank at which he had taken aim. To his astonishment and\ndelight he saw that a hole had been drilled clean through the solid oak\nand the bullet itself was lying on the ground, flattened from its impact\nwith the masonry behind the planking. All this, let it be said again,\nwas perfectly familiar to Constans in theory, but its realization in\nfact gave him a strange thrill. A score of men armed with these large\ncaliber pistols, or, better still, rifles, might easily enough compel\nthe surrender or bring about the destruction of the entire fighting\nforce of the Doomsmen.\n\nInspired by this new thought, Constans made a thorough examination of\nthe stock of arms in the shop. To his disappointment he found most of\nthe rifles in unserviceable condition, covered with rust and verdigris.\nFinally, however, he came across a dozen carbines carefully wrapped and\npacked for a prospective shipment across the ocean. Protected by their\nheavy coverings the weapons had suffered comparatively little damage,\nand Constans spent the best part of a week in cleaning them and getting\nthe mechanism of their working parts into tolerable order.\n\nLater on, Constans removed the serviceable ammunition, amounting to\nseveral hundred rounds, to a convenient hiding-place in the cellar of a\nbuilding fronting on the Lesser or Eastern river, and he also\ntransported thither the carbines, the latter carefully wrapped in\ngreased rags to preserve them from dampness. Some day the opportunity\nwould come to put these things to use. And now, February had passed, and\nMarch was well into its third quarter; in a few more days the returning\nsun would cross the line, and spring, the time for action, would be at\nhand. How he longed for its advent.\n\nThis was the third occasion upon which Constans had noticed that\npeculiar noise, a continuous, deep, humming note, such as might have\nbeen made by swarming-bees multiplied a hundredfold. On the day that he\nfirst heard it he happened to be walking three blocks to the westward of\nthe Citadel Square, and it seemed then that the seat of the mystery lay\nalmost due south. A week later he happened to be in the same locality.\nOnce more, those deep-toned vibrations smote upon his ears; now the\nsound-waves were all about him and the sense of direction was lost;\nagain, and they plainly proceeded from somewhere to the eastward. It was\nperplexing, but the varying quarter and strength of the wind might be\nsufficient to account for the difference, and in one curious particular\nthe two observations corresponded. The day of the week in each case had\nbeen Friday, and the humming noise had commenced at precisely the same\ntime--the passing of the sun over the meridian.\n\nTo-day was the third successive Friday, and Constans had made\npreparations for the careful noting of the phenomenon should it reoccur.\nHe waited with a lively sense of expectation, and he was not\ndisappointed. At high noon the humming began again, and it seemed to be\nlouder than when he had listened to it on the two former occasions--the\nair was full of the vibrant droning. There was a sinister quality, too,\nin its monotone, and Constans for the moment felt himself swayed by a\ngust of superstitious terror. He recalled the traditions current among\nthe House-dwellers, the belief that Doom was inhabited not only by the\noutlaws but by demons of many a grewsome sort and kind. There were\nstrange tales of lights that lured the wanderer onward, only to vanish\nas the victim sank into some frightful abyss; of invisible hands that\nplucked at the rash intruder's skirts; of monstrous shapes that leered\nand gabbled behind the traveller's back and were only blocks of stone\nwhen he turned to face them; of bloodless creatures that one might meet\nin the full flood of day, and whose unearthly character was only to be\nproved by observing that they cast no shadow in even the brightest\nsunlight; of vampires and ghouls and fair women with enchanting voices,\nwho enticed their victims into blind passageways and then changed\nsuddenly to foul, harpy-like monsters. But in this latter case the\nfoolish one had only himself to blame, for if he kept on the lookout he\ncould always detect the masquerade by observing the creature's hands.\nThe harpies could transform themselves in every other way, but their\nclaws remained unchanged, and they were, consequently, obliged to cover\nthem with gloves. \"Beware the gloved hand,\" was a familiar aphorism\namong the wise women of the West Inch, and Constans, shaken in spite of\nhimself by the remembrance of these old fables, felt the sweat break out\nupon his forehead, for all that the wind blew shrewdly cold.\n\nYet as he waited and listened and still nothing happened his natural\ngood-sense reasserted itself. Overhead a glorious winter sun was\nshining; as everybody knew, the sirens never sang until after dark, and\nassuredly they were accustomed to give a much more artistic performance.\nHis courage re-established, curiosity asserted her rights; he must\ndiscover the source and nature of this mystery, and so he proceeded\ncautiously in the direction from whence it now appeared to come, a\ncourse that led him south by east for perhaps ten of the city blocks.\n\nConstans found himself a short distance below the Citadel Square and in\na quarter of the city that he had never yet explored. Suddenly he came\nupon a large building of brick covering a full square in area but only\ntwo stories in height. As he approached the humming noise grew louder\nand louder; the secret, whatever it was, lay concealed behind those\ncommon-place-looking walls. Constans held his breath and went forward\nslowly.\n\nThe street, upon which the main elevation of the building faced was an\nunusually wide one, and directly in front of the entrance to the\nstructure the snow had been cleared away from a circular space whose\ndiameter was about forty feet. In this enclosure were three women whose\ncostume, a dark gray cloak and scarlet hood, proclaimed them to be of\nthe Doomsmen. They were kneeling on the hard pavement, and kept\nalternately bowing their foreheads to the ground and then bringing the\nupper body to a vertical position, the arms extended and the palms\nturned outward. The movements were done in time to the rhythmic throb of\nthe mysterious humming, and undoubtedly the ceremony possessed some\nreligious significance.\n\nFor perhaps ten minutes Constans stood motionless, watching the scene.\nThen, together, the women rose to their feet and approached a rude,\nblock-shaped structure of stone that apparently served as an altar. Upon\nit each in turn laid her gift, some article of food, and immediately\ndeparted. In his eagerness to see what would follow, Constans stepped\nboldly around the corner, and so came within the view of a man who had\njust made his exit from the building.\n\nIt was too late to retreat, and Constans stood his ground, noting that\nthe stranger seemed equally astonished with himself at the encounter. An\nelderly man, to judge by the whitening beard, but his eye was bright and\nsearching, and there was no hint at superannuation in either port or\nmovement. He was dressed in a long skirtlike garment of black\ncloth--true priest garb--and for a girdle he wore a length of hempen\nrope tied in the peculiar and sinister fashion known as the \"hangman's\nknot.\" Around his neck, suspended like a priest's stole, hung a steel\nchain with pendent manacles or handcuffs that jangled unmusically as he\nmoved. A grotesque, almost ridiculous figure this priest of the\nDoomsmen, but with the first look into the man's face one forgot about\nthe fantastic garb. A singular contradiction it presented, for the\nlarge, square jaw was indicative of a mind keenly rationalistic, while\nthe high, narrow forehead assuredly proclaimed the partisan and the\nbigot.\n\nIt was the elder man who broke the silence.\n\n\"The time is long since a man of the Doomsmen has appeared to pay his\nvows to the Shining One. You are welcome, my son.\"\n\nConstans wondered if he had heard aright. Then he remembered that he was\nwearing a suit of Ulick's clothes and that his hair was cut after the\nDoomsmen fashion. It was a comfortable assurance of the merit of his\ndisguise that it had passed muster so easily; he had only to guard\nagainst talking too much, and detection was practically impossible. So\nhe contented himself with what might pass for an obeisance and some\nvague words of apology. The priest, however, paid no attention to his\nexcuses, but continued in a tone of sarcastic bitterness:\n\n\"Strange that you should think it worth while to seek a god who is\nserved only by women. Yet the Shining One seems neither to know nor to\ncare that the sons of the Doomsmen come no longer into his presence\nchamber and bring no gifts to his altar. A god forsaken by his people, a\nneglected shrine, a worn-out creed--why, indeed, should any one do\nreverence to such things as these? Yet you have come.\"\n\n\"I--my father----\" stammered Constans. \"There are reasons; I will\nexplain----\"\n\n\"It matters not,\" interrupted the priest, impatiently. \"It is enough\nthat you are here, and, being a man, you have the privilege of the inner\nmysteries. And possibly a message may be awaiting you. Come.\"\n\nHe took Constans by the hand and drew him towards the vaulted\nentrance-way. There was no reasonable opportunity for protest, and\nbefore Constans was fully aware of what was happening he had been\nhurried through the passage and into a large, semi-darkened building\nthat was filled with the rumble and clank of machinery in rapid motion.\nConstans, having recovered from the first surprise and his eyes becoming\naccustomed to the obscurity, looked about him with a dawning sense of\ncomprehension.\n\nIn the middle of the hall was installed an enormous piece of machinery,\na vast cylindrical construction revolving at great speed, and Constans\nbecame the more certain of its real nature as he proceeded to examine it\nin detail. He recalled the illustrations and diagrams that he had been\nporing over only the day before at the library building, and he was sure\nthat this monster could be nothing else than an electric dynamo, and one\nof the very largest size, delivering as high as fifteen thousand\nhorse-power of potential energy. But how to account for the chance that\nhad preserved this mightiest of the Old-World forces? What miracle had\nbeen wrought to keep this soulless giant in life through so many years\nof darkness and of silence? Constans felt his head spinning; the\nconsciousness of a fact so tremendous was overwhelming; to save himself\nhe turned away from the dynamo proper and began looking about for the\nsource of its mechanical energy. He found it in an odd-appearing motor,\nto which the dynamo was connected by the ordinary means of a shaft and\nbelting.\n\nThe engine was simple enough in outward construction. All that could be\nseen was an apparatus consisting of two ten-foot tuning-forks of steel\nsupported on insulated pedestals, and between them a disk of some\nunknown composition, mounted in a vertical plane and revolving at\ninconceivable velocity. The power was taken from the shaft of this\nrevolving disk and reduced in speed by means of gear-wheels before being\nconveyed to the dynamo. The prongs of the big tuning-forks continued to\nvibrate strongly, and gave out in unison the loud, humming note that had\noriginally attracted Constans's attention. It was undoubtedly, a form of\nmotor whose power was derived from some secret property of vibratory\nbodies, a recondite subject to which his books alluded but obscurely.\nYet in the years immediately preceding the Great Change the principle\nseems to have been reduced to practical utility. Here was the engine in\nactual operation, and whatever its source of fuel supply or the ultimate\nsecret of its energy there could be no doubt about its production of\npower. It moved, it was alive, and Constans gazed upon it with\nfascinated eyes.\n\nThe priest had risen to his feet; he touched Constans lightly on the\nshoulder.\n\n\"The presence chamber,\" he said, in a whisper. \"Come, that you may look\nupon the face of the Shining One; he will rejoice in knowing that there\nis left even one faithful in Doom.\"\n\nHe opened a door leading to a room at the left of the main hall and\nmotioned Constans to enter. The door closed behind them and they stood\nin darkness. Then came the click of a switch-key, and out of the\nblackness faint lines of radiance appeared, changing slowly to a fiery\nbrightness. And as the lines grew visible they resolved themselves into\nthe semblance of a great and terrible face, the countenance of a man of\nheroic size with long hair. There was no suggestion of a body, only that\nmajestic head crowned with hyacinthine locks and limned in lambent fire.\n\nConstans felt his knees shaking under him, and involuntarily he\nprostrated himself; then again he heard the switch click, and the vision\nfaded into nothingness.\n\nThere was the sound of a shutter being thrown back, and the daylight\nstreamed in. He rose uncertainly to his feet and looked about him.\n\nIt was a small apartment, low-studded, with cement walls and a tiled\nfloor. Near the door and fastened against the wall was a wooden\nframework, bearing a complicated arrangement of push-buttons and levers.\nConstans had seen its like pictured in his books, and he instantly\nconjectured it to be an electrical switch-board, designed to control and\ndirect the current generated by the dynamo. On the opposite wall was\nsuspended a thick sheet of some insulating substance--vulcanite--and\nfixed upon it was a net-work of wires in whose outlines he could\ndistinguish the lineaments of the fiery face. Now he understood; it was\nsimply a trick, the passing of a strong current of electricity through\nplatinum wires until they became incandescent.\n\nThe recognition of those material agencies for the production of the\napparition that had so terrified him gave Constans back his confidence;\nhis books had not deceived him, and he was ready now for any fresh\nmarvels that might be on the cards. But the attitude of the priest\npuzzled him. Was he really the charlatan, the trickster that he seemed?\nWas it not equally simple to regard him as the self-deluded votary? He\ncould not decide.\n\n\"You have looked upon the face of the Shining One,\" said the old man,\nbreaking the silence. \"Now behold his throne; perchance he will accord\nyou the honor of sharing it with him.\"\n\nIn the middle of the apartment stood the only piece of furniture proper\nthat it contained, a massive oaken chair, with a head-piece, upon which\nwas fastened a metal plate. On the arms of the chair were copper clips,\nthe size of a man's wrist, and all the points of contact were supplied\nwith cups containing sponges. Again Constans understood. It was only\nnecessary to dampen these sponges to ensure a perfect discharge of the\nelectrical current passing through the head-rest and the metal\nwrist-clips. Constans shuddered, and this time with reason; he knew\nenough of the science to realize that the slightest contact with those\nenormously charged electrodes must be fatal.\n\nThe priest went to the switch-board, and, after a series of\ngenuflections and the mumbling of what might have been an invocation, he\nturned a lever. Constans stepped back hastily.\n\n\"Now is the Shining One come upon his throne. Take your seat at his side\nif you would put his divinity to the proof. Or else be content to serve\nhim in silence and singleness of heart, even as I.\"\n\nConstans guessed acutely that the full current from the dynamo must be\npassing through the metal framework of the great chair; he moved a\nlittle farther back and stood on guard. There was a glitter in the old\nman's eye that was disquieting, and Constans did not relish the idea of\na hand-to-hand struggle in this contracted space with these\nwicked-looking wires running in every direction. One of them had been\nbroken, and from the dangling end, which hung close to a metal\nwall-bracket, a continuous stream of sparks fizzed and spluttered.\n\n\"I am content,\" he said, quietly.\n\nThe priest smiled grimly. \"Yet it is a pity that your doubts are not of\na more stubborn growth, for it is many a year since the Shining One has\ntaken a man to his arms. Of a truth, the ancient faith has failed\nmiserably among the children of the Doomsmen, and I alone of all his\npriests remain to serve our lord.\"\n\nThere was silence, the old man remaining apparently absorbed in his\nbitter reverie. Constans had been growing more and more uncomfortable,\nand this seemed to be his opportunity to escape. He edged towards the\ndoor. Now the metal knob of the door handle was within reach; he grasped\nit, and received a severe electric shock. Unable to master his startled\nnerves, he gave utterance to a cry of pain. The priest turned quickly, a\nfrosty smile upon his lips.\n\n\"The sentinels of the Shining One are faithful to their duty,\" he said,\nquietly. He touched a push-button, and Constans was at last able to let\ngo of that innocent-looking door-knob; he fell to rubbing his arm\nvigorously in order to relieve the contracted muscles. What a ridiculous\nfigure he had made of himself, he thought, vexedly.\n\n\"My son.\"\n\nThere was a new note in the old man's voice, an inflection almost\nkindly, and Constans wondered.\n\n\"Nothing happens of itself,\" continued the priest, \"and it was more than\nchance that led you thither. Surely, the Shining One has been mindful of\nhis own, for I am an old man and my days are numbered. Therefore, has he\nsent you, my son, that to you I may commit the secrets of his power and\nworship. Then shall I ascend in peace upon the knees of the Silent One,\nknowing that his honor is safe in your hands. What say you?\"\n\nConstans realized that he was in a difficult position; nay more, that he\nwas absolutely at the mercy of his new acquaintance. There was no means\nof exit save by the one door, and he had no desire for a second trial of\nstrength with the electric current. The old priest might be ignorant of\nthe real nature of the forces under his control, but certainly he was\nwell provided with practical formulas for their exploitation, as witness\nthe illuminated face and the electrically charged door-knob. Constans\nunderstood that he was in a trap, where even to come into contact with\nthe walls of his prison-house might mean death. There was but one thing\nto do, and that was to surrender.\n\n\"I will serve the Shining One,\" he said, quietly.\n\n\"You have chosen well, my son,\" returned the old man. \"Now a fool would\nnever have understood that a net may be none the less strong for being\ninvisible, and our lord does not love to speak twice. You have heard\nand you have obeyed; it is good.\"\n\nHe stepped to the switch-board, and, after going through a series of\ngenuflections, accompanied by an undertone of carelessly gabbled ritual,\nhe depressed a lever. Instantly the room was in darkness and the\nspluttering wire ceased its crackling. The priest passed into the great\nhall, motioning Constans to follow him. Another brief and\nincomprehensible ritual and he approached the vibratory motor. Constans\nwatched intently as he proceeded to manipulate a series of polished rods\nand levers. Suddenly the loud, humming note separated into two distinct\ntones, at first in musical accord and then becoming more and more\ndissonant. The revolving disk slowed down and stopped, and with it the\ndynamo came finally to rest. The hour of worship had come to an end; the\nShining One had departed from his sanctuary.\n\nAt the suggestion of his ecclesiastical superior Constans brought within\ndoors the offerings of food that had been left by the earlier\nworshippers. There were some dry cakes, baked of rye flour, a pot of\nhoney, cheese, milk, and two bottles of wine. These provisions he was\nordered to carry to a room on the story above the street, where a fire\nof sea-coal burned cheerfully in a brazier. Here they sat down and\nfeasted amicably together, for the frosty air had put a keen edge to\nappetite and the noon hour was long overpast. And then as they sat at\nease after the meal and the old man was well started on his second pipe,\nConstans came directly to the point.\n\n\"If I am to serve the Shining One acceptably,\" he said, \"there are many\nthings that I should know. May I speak, my father?\"\n\nThe priest looked at him searchingly. \"As you will,\" he replied.\n\nAll through the afternoon and deep into the night they talked earnestly\ntogether. And so, from time to time, in the days that were to follow,\nfor it was a question of many things, and of some that were hard of\nunderstanding.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nARCADIA HOUSE\n\n\nLittle by little, Constans succeeded in piecing together the puzzle, for\npuzzle indeed it was. Here in this city of the dead he had found in\nactual operation one of the great power-producing plants of the ancient\nworld. How to account for the miracle of its preservation during the\ngenerations that had passed since the sun of knowledge had disappeared\nbeneath the sea of mental darkness. What sufficient explanation could\nthere be for this amazing fact?\n\nFrom Prosper, the priest, Constans drew the main outlines of the story,\nand his studies enabled him to fill in the details. In brief, it may be\nset down as follows:\n\nWhen the convicts and criminals, who were the ancestors of the Doomsmen,\ntook possession of the old-time city, it is reasonable to suppose that\namong them were a certain proportion of technically educated\nmen--artisans, mechanics, engineers. A power-plant of such imposing\nproportions (designed, we may conjecture, for the furnishing of motive\npower to one of the great transportation systems) could hardly escape\ntheir notice, and they would certainly know how to utilize it if they\ncared to do so. And they did--for a peculiar reason.\n\nIt is a matter of record that in the twentieth century the universal\nform of capital punishment was execution by electricity. In every\nstate-prison stood the \"death-chair,\" the visible embodiment of the\nmoral force which the wrong-doer had defied, and which, in the ensuing\nstruggle, had proved too strong for him. No wonder that it was both\nfeared and hated by the citizens of the underworld of crime.\n\nNow that the social fabric lay in ruins, now that the very foundations\nof law and order had been razed, what could be more natural than the\nimpulse to turn this instrument of legal punishment into one of\nunlicensed vengeance? Society had dealt, mercilessly, with the breaker\nof laws, and now it was to suffer in its turn. So it came to pass that\nwhenever a House-dweller (as representative of the old law-creating and\nlaw-abiding classes) fell alive into the hands of the Doomsmen, it was\ninvariably ordained that he must take his seat in the chair of death and\nin his own body make satisfaction for the ancient debt.\n\nBut the years rolled on, and with the new generations came a slow but\nsweeping change in sentiment. The Doomsmen were now the dominant race,\nand the Housemen had become their vassals. It was not good policy for a\nmaster to wantonly destroy productive property, and so by degrees these\nbarbarous reprisals slackened. The time was now ripe for the second\nstage of the evolution--the introduction of the religious element and\nthe final conversion of the execution into the sacrifice. That the\ntransformation was a natural one may be easily shown.\n\nEven among the ancient scientists the nature of electricity was but\nimperfectly understood, and as the night of ignorance settled down upon\nthe world it was inevitable that the various phenomena of electrical\nenergy should come to be regarded with ever-increasing awe. To the\ncommonalty among the Doomsmen this invisible, inaudible, intangible\nforce which slew at a breath, became invested with supernatural\nattributes; it was the spirit of a god that came and sat in the chair of\ndeath, now transformed into the high altar of his chosen sacrifice.\n\nBut outside of the vulgar crowd were the initiated, the _illuminati_,\nthe technically trained adepts who managed the whole business. How about\nthem? In the beginning, doubtless, they would be tempted to foster the\nnew cult, recognizing in it a weakness upon which they could profitably\nplay. And this they did, only to be trapped, in turn, in the net of\nsuperstition which they had helped to weave. It was now three\ngenerations back to the electricians and mechanical experts to whom the\ncare of the great engines had originally been intrusted. Their sons and\ngrandsons continued to preserve the practical knowledge which was\nrequired for the management of the machinery under their charge, but as\ntime went on they cared less and less about the principles of the\nmysterious forces that they controlled. Now, let the tide of religious\nfervor sweep onward to its flood, and inevitably the apprentice would be\nreplaced by the acolyte; the neophytes of the fourth generation would be\ntaught only so much about the engines as was absolutely necessary for\ntheir maintenance in running order. At last, the Shining One had come to\nhis own, and all bowed before his throne.\n\nFollowing upon this culmination came decadence; it is the universal\nlaw. Through imperceptible degrees men fell away from the faith of their\nfathers, and the worship of the god had become unfashionable. The\ndevotees were reduced to a handful of women; of the once all-powerful\npriesthood, Prosper alone remained, and he was an old and feeble man.\n\nOne man but he had stood unfalteringly at his post; every Friday for\nmore than thirty years he had caused the spirit of the god to descend\ninto his sanctuary, and had called upon all true-hearted believers to\ndraw near and worship. That they would not heed was no concern of his;\nhis duty was accomplished, and beyond this no man may go.\n\n\"And surely the Shining One is jealous of his own honor,\" said Constans,\nguardedly. \"Will he not bring to naught these foolish contemners of his\nmajesty? Without doubt, else he were no god.\"\n\nIt was the afternoon of the following day, and the two men had been busy\nwith the care of the machinery in the great hall, polishing up the\nbright parts and examining with infinite patience the innumerable\nbearings, their oil-cups and dust-caps. The conversation had naturally\nbeen colored by the pious character of their task, and Prosper had\nspoken more unreservedly than was his wont, emboldening Constans to ask\nthe question recorded above. \"Else he were no god,\" he repeated,\ninsistently. The old man turned on him.\n\n\"And who shall tell us whether he be a god or no?\" he demanded, with\nstartling vehemence. \"What manner of divinity can he be who allows these\nfeeble hands to call him into existence and again to reduce him to\nnothingness? A god! This senseless block of iron that lives only at my\nwill and pleasure. Behold, boy! shall the Shining One suffer indignity\nsuch as this and not worthily avenge himself?\" and as he spoke, he\ncaught up a handful of refuse from the floor and deliberately threw it\nat the great dynamo before which they were standing.\n\n\"A god!\" he reiterated, with contemptuous bitterness, and spat upon the\nmass of polished metal.\n\nThere was a moment of suspense so real that Constans, despite his\nvantage ground of superior knowledge, trembled with an inexplicable\nterror. Surely, the outraged divinity had started into life; it was\npreparing to strike down the blasphemer.\n\n\"Perchance he is on a journey, or he sleeps,\" said the old priest,\ncoldly. \"He is a wise man who knows in whom he believes, and the Shining\nOne shall, doubtless, be justified of his children.\" Then, with a\ngesture of indescribable dignity, he drew a corner of his flowing outer\ncape across his face and passed out into the gathering shadows of the\nwinter day.\n\nThe task was still unfinished, but not for worlds would Constans have\nremained alone in that echoing, wind-swept cavern, surrounded by these\nmonstrous shapes of metal. Lever and piston, wheel and shaft, the\nfamiliar outlines had disappeared, and in their stead a vast,\nindefinable bulk loomed through the dusk. It hung in the background like\na wild beast, eternally watchful and waiting, waiting. Of a sudden,\nConstans felt horribly afraid. Stumbling and panting he ran up-stairs\nand gained the shelter of his own little room. A fire was smouldering on\nthe hearth; he blew the log into a flame and lighted every candle upon\nwhich he could lay his hand. Then as mind and body relaxed under the\ncheering influence of light and warmth he drew a chair to the fire and\nsat down to seriously consider his future course of action. The\nsituation had forced itself upon him. How was he to grapple with it?\n\nIn the first place, here was this tremendous power whose secret he alone\npossessed; the day and hour might even now be at hand when he should be\nable to wrest this superior knowledge to advantage.\n\nSecondly, there was the question of personal safety, and assuredly it\nwould be to his interest to be numbered among the accredited servants of\nthe Shining One. The people might have grown indifferent to the worship\nof their ancient gods, but superstition still counselled an outward\nmeasure of respect towards those who wore the priestly garb. Finally,\nthere was the pressing necessity of putting food into his mouth, a\ncommonplace but still cogent consideration. Constans had been living on\nshort rations now for a week past, his provisions were just about\nexhausted, and the prospects for the future had caused him no little\nanxiety. In the service of the Shining One he would at least be fed. So\nhe resolved to accept the issue that had been forced upon him: he had\npassed his word, and he would keep it until destiny itself absolved him.\n\nSeveral days later Constans adventured forth, making directly for the\nCitadel Square and from thence into the Palace Road. His official garb,\na long black soutane and hood, was a tolerable disguise in itself, while\nthe emblem of the forked lightning, worked in gold thread upon his left\nsleeve, vouched for his sacerdotal character as a member of the\ninferior priesthood. The Doomsmen whom he encountered looked at him\nwith indifference, a very few saluted him with a perfunctory respect. It\nwas plain that his appearance awakened neither interest nor distrust,\nand during the course of his walk he was enabled to add materially to\nhis stock of knowledge about the city and its defences.\n\nHalf way down the Palace Road he overtook a man, a squat,\nbroad-shouldered fellow, who limped as he walked. Constans would have\nbrushed by, but the man plucked at his sleeve, and he was forced to stop\nand accommodate his pace to that of his interlocutor. A disagreeable\nappearing personage, with a crafty face, yet he spoke civilly enough.\n\n\"A fair day, master. Eh! but a black cassock's a rare bird nowadays upon\nthe Palace Road.\"\n\n\"Is it not wide enough for us both?\" returned Constans, as easily as he\ncould.\n\n\"Oh, of a most noble broadness; I've no complaint to make on that score.\nIt's the length of the way that is troubling me just now--this cursed\nleg of mine! Might I be so bold to ask the loan of your arm so far as\nthe fortress? An old sailorman with a sprung spar navigates but badly on\nthese icy stones.\"\n\nConstans could do nothing but comply, albeit somewhat ungraciously. His\nnew acquaintance did not seem to notice his coldness. He went on\nvolubly:\n\n\"A fair day, as I have said, but I should prefer a leaden sky and the\nfighting-deck of the _Black Swan_, with the oars ripping through the\nyeast of a north-wester.\"\n\n\"The _Black Swan_!\" ejaculated Constans, forgetting himself for the\nmoment.\n\n\"Ay, master, and I may well curse my luck in missing the chance,\"\ncontinued the fellow grumblingly. \"There is always fat picking to be had\nunder that same bird's beak, but this bad knee of mine has kept me out\nof it for twice a twelvemonth. Perhaps it might be worth my while,\" he\nadded, hesitatingly, \"to humble myself before the Shining One. Who knows\nbut that he might help me, seeing that all the physicians have failed.\nHow about a quarter of hung venison, my lord, and a gallon or so of the\nbest apple-wine--just by way of a peace-offering?\"\n\n\"The Shining One makes no bargains,\" answered Constans, sternly, in\nvirtue of his assumed office. \"Submit yourself to his will, and then\nperchance our lord may deign to hear. He grants his favors to his\nobedient children; he sells them to none.\"\n\n\"But, my father----\"\n\n\"Our ways part here,\" said Constans, decidedly, for they had now reached\nthe north gate of the citadel and he was beginning to feel more and more\nuncomfortable under those sharp eyes. \"Farewell, my son, and remember\nthat penitence precedes healing, whether of soul or of body.\"\n\nConstans passed on, and the man stood looking after him with a certain\nmalevolent curiosity.\n\n\"Now so surely as I am Kurt, the Knacker, there is more in this\npriestling than meets the eye,\" he muttered. \"Is a blithe young chap,\nwith such a pair of shoulders, to willingly prefer a black robe to a\nvelvet jacket, a priest's empire over a score of silly women to a seat\nin a trooper's saddle, and the whole green world from which to pick and\nchoose his pleasures? Bah! it isn't reasonable, and if this knee of mine\nwill permit me to hobble into the presence of the Shining One some fine\nmorning I will have another guess at the riddle.\n\n\"To-morrow, now, is Friday,\" he continued, thoughtfully, \"and my little\ndoves have been teasing me to give them an outing. There is the\ncertainty of a smile or even a kiss from the black-browed Nanna to\nrecompense my good-nature, and a possible secret hanging in the wind.\nFinally, the off chance that the Shining One is not so hopelessly out of\nfashion as we have been led to think. In this backsliding age he should\nappreciate the honor of my attendance in person, to say nothing of the\nvenison and the wine.\" Kurt, the Knacker, laughed silently under his\ncurtain of black beard, and then stumped over to a bench in the gateway,\nsheltered from the wind and open to the sun. There he sat him down and\nproceeded to enjoy the pleasures of social converse with the warders on\nguard, an occupation pleasingly diversified by an occasional black-jack\nof ale and innumerable pipefuls of Kinnectikut shag. A highly respected\nman among his fellow-citizens was Kurt, the Knacker.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the hour of the weekly sacrifice, and Prosper, the priest, stood\nbefore the altar of the Shining One, performing the uncouth and ofttimes\nwholly meaningless ritual of his office. Constans, in his capacity of\nacolyte, stood on the right of the altar. He felt out of place and\nsomewhat ridiculous; he was conscious that he performed his\ngenuflections and posturing awkwardly, and there were all these women\nwatching him. Especially the two in the front row, accompanied by the\nlimping scoundrel to whom he had yesterday lent his arm on the Palace\nRoad. The one who seemed the elder of the two scanned him with bold,\nblack eyes, unaffectedly amused by his clumsiness; the other, whose face\nwas hidden by a veil, looked at him but once or twice, yet Constans felt\nsure that she, too, was laughing at him. His position was becoming an\nintolerable one. Would the farce never come to an end?\n\nNow the service was over, and one by one the worshippers withdrew. Last\nof all the two women, escorted by the man who called himself Kurt, the\nKnacker. They passed within arm's-length of Constans, but he made as\nthough to turn his head away; youth is proverbially sensitive to\nridicule. He noticed, however, that the pilgrimage had not been of\nmarked benefit to the lame man, for he limped as badly as ever. Then\ntheir eyes met, and Constans felt somewhat uncomfortable at being\nfavored with a particularly sour smile of recognition. Still he need not\nconcern himself. It was evident that these people were not true\nworshippers; it was mere curiosity that had brought them before the\ngates of the Shining One, and now that they had seen the show they were\ndoubtless satisfied. Let them depart whence they came; it was but a\npassing incident.\n\nThe snow that covered the ground a week before had nearly disappeared\nunder the influence of a three-days' warm rain. This morning had given\npromise of even more springlike weather, but as the day wore on it had\ngrown cloudy and the air had turned chill. It had begun to snow again\nshortly before the hour of service, and so fast had the flakes come down\nthat the fall was already over an inch in depth. Constans, turning the\ncorner into the side-street to get a more extended view of the eastern\nsky, suddenly halted to contemplate a curious appearing mark in the pure\nwhite expanse--the imprint of a woman's foot.\n\nIt was an exquisitely moulded thing; even the slender arch of the instep\nhad been preserved in unbroken line and curve, and yet Constans wondered\nvaguely why it should seem so beautiful to him. He put out his own foot\nand compared the two, laughed, half understood, and was silent.\n\nHe went on a little farther, following the successive footprints as they\nled down the street. Once his heavy boot half obliterated one of the\ndelicately marked prints; he backed quickly away, as though his\nclumsiness had been an actual offence. Then he knit his brows over the\nabsurdity of the affair and stopped to consider.\n\nSophistry suggested that it might be the missing girl, Esmay, and\ncertainly she who had walked here was the veiled woman of the temple\nworshippers; there were the footprints, broader and heavier in\nappearance, of her companion, and the halting progress of the\nblack-chapped ruffian, who had accompanied them, was also plainly\nvisible. Constans followed the trail at a smart pace, for it was snowing\nharder than ever, and it would not take long to obliterate the marks.\nBut three blocks farther on the three sets of footprints suddenly turned\nat right angles to the sidewalk and disappeared.\n\nA mystery whose solution should have been apparent at once from the\nwheel-tracks parallel with the curb, but for a minute or two Constans\ndid not realize their true nature. The ordinary vehicle in use among\nthe House People was a springless cart, whose wheels were simply\nsections of an elm-tree butt, and these primitive constructions creaked\nhorribly upon their axles, unless liberally greased, and left a track\nsix inches or more in width. It is not surprising, then, that Constans\nwas momentarily puzzled by the narrow, delicately lined marks that\nbetokened the passage of a real carriage. For while Doom contained many\nexamples of the ancient coach-builder's skill, they were not in general\nuse. The old Dom Gillian occasionally employed a carriage in taking the\nair--at least, so Ulick had told him, but Constans had never seen it.\nFor all that the check was but a momentary one; his wits had been\nsharpened by use, and now they helped him to the truth. He ran on at top\nspeed.\n\nA course of a mile or more and he was entering a poorer part of the city\na little north of east and close to the shore of the Lesser river. It\nwas a region of tenement dwellings, a huddle of nondescript buildings,\nflanked by huge factories and sprawling coal and lumber yards--an\nunpromising region, surely, in which to look for Master Quinton Edge's\nparticular retreat. And yet it would have marked the subtlety of the man\nto have set his secret here, where it would have been at once so easily\nseen and overlooked. Every labyrinth has its clew, but the fugitive\nwalks safely in a crowd.\n\nThe wheel-tracks turned sharply to the right, going straight down a side\nstreet to the river-front. On the left were the ruins of one of the\nancient plants for the manufacture of illuminating gas. The yard was\nbut a wilderness of rusty iron tanks and fallen bricks; surely there\nwas nothing here to interest.\n\nOn the right, however, there was an enclosed area that comprised the\ngreater part of the block. It was separated from the highway by a brick\nwall ten feet in height, and the general level of the ground was\nconsiderably higher than that of the street. Constans could see trees\ngrowing and the ruins of a pergola and trellises for fruit; it actually\nlooked like a garden, and through the naked branches of the trees there\ngleamed the white stuccoed walls of a dwelling-house, with a flat roof,\nsurmounted by a cupola. The estate, for it possessed certain pretensions\nto that title, looked as though it had been transported from some more\nfavored region and set down all in a piece among these hideous iron\ntanks and dingy, cliff-like factories.\n\nConstans quickened his pace; his imagination was on fire. Yes, there was\na gateway, and surely the carriage had passed through but a few minutes\nbefore. Constans halted at the barrier and studied it attentively. It\nwas snowing hard now, and he ran but small risk of being observed from\nthe house.\n\nThe doors of the driveway were of heavy planking studded with\ninnumerable bands and rivets, and they were suspended between massive\nbrick piers. A structure of light open iron-work spanned the gateway and\nsupported a central lantern, with a coat of arms immediately below it.\nThe device upon the shield was three roundels in chief and the crest, an\narm holding a hammer.\n\nIn the left wing of the gate proper a small door had been cut for\npedestrian use. It had been painted a dark green, the knocker and\ndoor-plate being of brass. Constans by dint of rubbing away some of the\nverdigris succeeded in making out the inscription. It read:\n\n      ARCADIA HOUSE\n    RICHARD VAN DUYNE\n         1803\n\nActuated by a daring impulse he lifted the knocker and let it fall. The\nrat-tat sounded hollowly, but there was no response. Constans looked\nlongingly at the wall, but without some special appliance, such as a\nnotched pole or grappling-hooks, it was unscalable. There were no signs\nof life to be seen in or about the house. Not a light in any of the\nwindows or curl of smoke from a chimney-pot. The wheel-tracks leading\nthrough the gateway had already become obliterated by the rapidly\nfalling snow; the silence was profound. The whole adventure seemed to be\nvanishing into thin air; the wheel-tracks having led him into this land\nof folly had disappeared after the accustomed fashion of those mocking\nspirits whose delight is in leading the unwary traveller astray.\nInvoluntarily, Constans glanced over his shoulder; he almost expected to\nsee some shadowy bulk stealing up behind him preparing to make its\nspring.\n\nYet as he retraced his steps to the temple of the Shining One he\nresolved that he would pay another visit to Arcadia House. \"To-morrow,\"\nthought Constans, \"I may find some one to answer the door.\"\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\nA MAN AND A MAID\n\n\nIn spite of that brave \"to-morrow,\" it was several days before Constans\nfound opportunity to revisit Arcadia House. A misstep upon an icy\nflag-stone had resulted in a sprained ankle, and for that there was no\nremedy but patience.\n\nYet the time was not wasted. Here was a fascinating problem to be\nsolved, and, yielding to importunity, Prosper was finally induced to\ntalk freely of the sacred mysteries of the Shining One. He was even\npersuaded to put the machinery in operation, outside the canonical\nhours, in order that Constans might test the theories derived from his\nbooks. One experiment interested them greatly.\n\nConstans took a \"live\" wire and allowed its free end to hang in close\nproximity to a leaden water-pipe. Then he placed a piece of oily rag\nnear by and saw it answer his expectation by bursting into flame. He\nlooked triumphantly around at Prosper, to whom he had previously\nexplained the nature of the experiment.\n\n\"Would the fire descend wherever the wire led?\" demanded the priest.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Constans, confidently. \"Under the same conditions, of\ncourse--a broken circuit and inflammable material close at hand.\"\n\nThe old man frowned. \"It is wonderful,\" he said, grudgingly, \"but it\nproves nothing. Is your viewless, formless electricity anything more or\nanything less than my god? What am I to believe? Is it the spirit of the\nlightning-cloud that thrills in this little wire, or have you learned\nhow to bottle fire and thunder, even as a House-dweller who fills his\ngoat-skins with apple-wine? Is the Shining One at once so great and so\nsmall that we can be both his servants and his lords?\"\n\nConstans would not be drawn into an argument, being as little versed in\ntheological subtleties as was the old priest in scientific terminology.\nBut he noticed that Prosper was studying the subject after his own\nfashion. Nearly every night now he would start up the machinery and\nspend hours in watching the revolutions of the giant dynamo. It was not\nunusual for Constans to fall to sleep, lulled by the monotonous humming\nof the vibratory motor and awake to find the machinery still in motion.\n\nIt was within this week that the _Black Swan_ returned to port. On the\nfourth day after the accident to his ankle Constans managed to hobble to\none of his posts of observation, and he discovered immediately that the\ngalley was lying at her accustomed pier. It was vexatious! to have\nQuinton Edge return at this precise time. Annoying! that this fair field\nshould be closed before he had had a chance to explore it. Well, it was\nfortune, and he must accept it; he was all the more eager now to make a\nsecond call at Arcadia House.\n\nIt was a dull, thawy afternoon when Constans found himself standing\nagain before the closed door that bore the name of the inhospitable Mr.\nRichard van Duyne. He had brought with him a rope ladder, provided with\ngrappling-hooks, and the mere scaling of the barrier should not present\nany great difficulty. It would be well, however, to reconnoitre a little\nfurther before he attempted it.\n\nFollowing the wall down to the river, he saw that it was continued to\nthe very edge of the water, where it joined a solidly constructed\nsea-wall. There were the remains of a wooden pier running out from the\nend of the street proper, and Constans adventured upon its worm-eaten\ntimbers, intent on obtaining a more extended view of this singular\ndomain of Arcadia House.\n\nA large and somewhat imposing structure it was, albeit of a curiously\ncomposite order of architecture.\n\nOriginally, it must have been a villa of the true Dutch type built of\nstuccoed brick, with many-gabled roof and small-paned, deeply embrasured\nwindows. A subsequent proprietor had enlarged its ground-plan, added an\nupper story, and changed the roof to one of flat pitch crowned by a\nhideous cupola. Still a third meddler had tried to make it over into a\ncolonial homestead by painting the stucco white and joining on an\nenormous columned porch. The final result could hardly have been\notherwise than an artistic monstrosity, yet the old house had acquired\nthat certain unanalyzable dignity which time confers, and the gentle\nfingers of the years had softened down insistent angles and smoothed out\nunlovely curves. It was a house with a soul, for men had lived and died,\nrejoiced and suffered within its walls.\n\nA house--and such a house!--set in its own garden amid the incongruous\nsurroundings of tenement buildings and malodorous gas-works. How to\naccount for it, what theory could be invented to reconcile facts so\ndiscordant? In reality, the explanation was simple enough; as between\nthe house and its environment, the former had all the rights of prior\npossession. In the early days of the settlement of the city the banks of\nthe Lesser river had been a favorite place of residence for well-to-do\nburghers and merchants. But foot by foot the muddy tide of trade and\nutilitarianism had risen about these green water-side Edens; one by one\ntheir quiet-loving owners had been forced farther afield.\n\nYet now and then the standard of rebellion had been raised; here and\nthere might be found a Dutchman as stiff-necked as the fate that he\ndefied. His father and his father's father had lived here upon the\nLesser river, and nothing short of a cataclysm of nature should avail to\nbudge him. The commissioners might cut up his cabbage-patch into\nbuilding sites and reduce his garden to the limits of a city block, but\nthey could not touch his beloved Arcadia House, with its white-porticoed\npiazza that gave upon the swirl and toss of the river--a delectable spot\non a hot June morning. Let them lower their accursed streets to their\nthrice-accursed grade; it would but leave him high and dry in his\ngreen-embowered island, secure of contamination to his fruit trees from\nunspeakable gas and sewer pipes. A ten-foot brick wall, with its top set\nwith broken bottles, would defend his quinces and apricots from the\nincursion of the street Arabs, and wind and sky were as free as ever.\nYes, he would hold his own against these vandals of commercialism,\nwhile one brick of Arcadia House remained upon another. So, let us\nfancy, quoth Mynheer van Duyne away back in _anno Domini_ 1803, and when\nhe died in 1850 or thereabouts, the estate, having but a moderate value\nas city property goes, was allowed to remain in _statu quo_; the heirs\nhad ground-rents enough and to spare without it, and Arcadia House might\nbe considered a proper memorial of the ancient state and dignity of the\nVan Duynes. But this is getting to be pure conjecture; let us return to\nConstans and the facts as he saw them.\n\nThe main house stood close to the river, there being but a strip of lawn\nbetween the piazza and the top of the sea-wall. On the left, as Constans\nfaced, an enclosed vestibule led to a secondary structure, which\nprobably contained the domestic offices and servants' quarters. Still\nfarther on, and under the same continuous albeit slightly lower\nroof-line, were the stables and cattle barns, the wood and other\nstorehouses forming the extreme left wing. In its day, Arcadia House had\nbeen an eminently respectable and comfortable dwelling, and even now it\npresented a tolerably good appearance; certainly it might be called\nhabitable. Constans, straining his eyes, for the afternoon was\nadvancing, thought he saw smoke ascending from one of the chimneys, and\nthis incited him to an actual invasion of the premises.\n\nHe chose the southwestern corner of the block as being farthest removed\nfrom the range of the house windows. A lucky throw made the grapples\nfast, and it took but an instant to run up the rungs. There was no one\nin sight, so Constans, shifting the ladder to the inner side, made the\ndescent quite at his ease, and found himself in a little plantation of\nspruce-trees.\n\nThe evergreens grew so thickly together that he had some difficulty in\nforcing his way through them. Breaking free at last, he stepped out into\nthe open, and stood vis-\u00e0-vis with a girl who had been advancing, as it\nwere, to meet him. Constans knew instantly that this could be none other\nthan Mad Scarlett's daughter, and there, indeed, were the proofs--the\nred-gold hair and the tawny eyes, just as Elena had described them in\nher message and Ulick in his endless lover's rhapsodies.\n\nShe stood mute and wide-eyed before him, the color in her cheeks coming\nand going like a flickering candle. Constans naturally concluded that\nhis appearance had frightened her. He retreated a step or two; he tried\nto think of something to say that would reassure her. Perhaps he might\nuse Ulick's name by way of introduction. He ended by blurting out:\n\n\"Don't be afraid; I will go whenever you say.\"\n\nHer lips formed rather than uttered the warning, \"Sh!\" She listened\nintently for a moment or two, but there was only the distant dripping of\nwater to be heard, the air being extraordinarily still and windless.\n\n\"Come!\" she panted, and, clutching at her skirts, led the way to a\nthatched pavilion some eighty yards distant, a storehouse, perhaps, or a\nbuilding once used as a farm office. Constans tried to question, to\nprotest, but for the moment his will was as flax in the flame of her\nresolution; he yielded and ran obediently at her side.\n\nArrived at the little house, the girl pushed him bodily through the\ndoorway and entered herself, turning quickly to slip into place the\noaken bar that secured the door from the inside. Constans swelled with\nindignation at this singular treatment. He was a man grown, not a truant\nchild to be led away by the ear for punishment. Yet she would not abate\none jot of her first advantage, and his anger melted under the quiet\nserenity of her gaze; in spite of himself he let her have the first\nword.\n\n\"Did you think I was afraid for myself?\" she asked, with a slow smile\nthat made Constans's cheeks burn. \"You see, I remembered that Fangs and\nBlazer are generally out by this time, a full hour before dark.\"\n\n\"Fangs and Blazer?\"\n\n\"The dogs, I mean. They will track a man even over this half-melted\nsnow, and old Kurt has trained them to short work with trespassers. You\ndid not know that?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Constans, simply. \"But then it would not have made any\ndifference.\"\n\n\"You mean that you are not afraid?\"\n\nHe had to be honest. \"I'm not sure about that, but still I should have\ncome.\"\n\nThe girl's eyes swept him approvingly.\n\n\"Of course,\" she said, well pleased, for a woman delights in placing her\nown valuation upon the courage of which a man speaks diffidently.\n\n\"I am Esmay,\" she announced, and paused a little doubtfully.\n\n\"I know,\" assented Constans.\n\n\"Then you do remember? Even the bracelet with the carbuncles, and how\nyou would not make up because I was a girl and knew no better?\"\n\n\"It was a very foolish affair from beginning to end,\" said Constans,\nloftily, intent upon disguising his embarrassment.\n\n[Illustration: SHE STOOD MUTE AND WIDE-EYED BEFORE HIM]\n\n\"Of course I knew you at once,\" she went on, meditatively. \"You were so\nawkward in your ridiculous priest robes that morning in the temple of\nthe Shining One. How Nanna and I did laugh!\"\n\nConstans winced a trifle at this, but he could not think of anything to\nsay. She laughed again at the remembrance--provokingly. Then she turned\non him suddenly. \"Why have you come to Arcadia House?\" she asked.\n\nConstans hesitated, tried to avoid the real issue, and of course put\nhimself in the wrong.\n\n\"It was on Ulick's account. I had promised him----\"\n\n\"Oh!\" The look was doubly eloquent of the disappointment inherent in the\nexclamation, and Constans thrilled under it. What delicious flattery in\nthis unexpected frankness! He made a step forward, but Esmay in her turn\ndrew back, her eyes hardened, and he stopped, abashed.\n\nIt had been a sudden remembrance of her childish threat--\"a woman ...\nand some day you will know what that means\"--that had tempted her to the\nrashness which she had so quickly regretted. For she had forgotten that\na proposition is generally provided with a corollary. If she had become\na woman he no less had grown to manhood, and that one forward step had\nforced her to recognize the fact. She was silent, feeling a little\nafraid and wondering at herself. Constans, in more evident discomfiture,\nblundered on, obsessed by a vague sense of loyalty to his friend.\n\n\"Ulick is away--on the expedition to the southland. He was anxious that\nyou should be found, and I promised to do my best. He will be glad to\nknow.\"\n\n\"When is he coming back?\" demanded Esmay, with an entire absence of\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"This month, certainly; indeed, it may be any day now.\"\n\n\"You must promise me that you will not tell him where I am or even that\nyou have seen me.\"\n\n\"But--but----\"\n\n\"Remember now that you have promised.\"\n\nConstans felt himself called upon to speak with some severity to this\nunreasonable young person.\n\n\"You are giving a great deal of trouble to your friends,\" he said,\nreprovingly.\n\n\"My friends!\" she echoed, mockingly.\n\n\"There was your mother and her message to your uncle Hugolin in Croye.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" she broke in. \"Then it was received--the message----?\"\nShe stopped, unable to go on; an indefinable emotion possessed her.\n\n\"My uncle has sent you to fetch me,\" she whispered. \"You are his\nmessenger.\"\n\nConstans had to answer her honestly, and was sorry.\n\n\"No,\" he said, bluntly. \"Messer Hugolin could not see his way to\nanything.\"\n\nHer pride came to her aid. \"Oh, it does not matter,\" she said, and so\nindifferently that Constans was deceived.\n\n\"But you cannot stay here,\" he insisted--\"here among the Doomsmen.\"\n\n\"They are my father's people, and you have just told me that my uncle\nHugolin does not want me.\"\n\n\"And what does Quinton Edge desire of you?\" he asked.\n\n\"I do not know,\" she answered, returning his gaze fearlessly, whereof\nConstans was glad, although he could not have told her why.\n\n\"Yet you are a prisoner?\"\n\n\"It seems so, and my sister Nanna as well. But we have nothing of which\nto complain, and doubtless our master will acquaint us with his pleasure\nin good time.\"\n\n\"It is always that way,\" said Constans, bitterly. \"His will against mine\nat every turn; a rock upon which I beat with naked hands.\"\n\n\"He is a strong man,\" answered Esmay, thoughtfully, \"but I think I know\nwhere his power lies. It is simply that neither his friends nor his\nenemies are aware of how they stand with him.\"\n\nBut Constans did not even notice that she was speaking; the remembrance\nof his unfulfilled purpose seized and racked him. He had hated this man,\nQuinton Edge, from that first moment in which their eyes had\nclashed--ever and always. At first instinctively; then with reason\nenough and to spare; and yet this small world still held them both. How\nlong were his hands to be tied? Once and again his enemy had stood\nbefore him and had gone his way insolently triumphant. He might be now\nin the house yonder, and Constans looked at it eagerly. A master\npassion, primitive and crude, possessed him.\n\nThe girl divined the hostile nature of the power which held him, and\ninstinctively she put forth her own strength against it.\n\n\"Listen!\" she said, and plucked him by the sleeve. Constans looked at\nher.\n\n\"I am going to trust you,\" she went on, quickly. \"The time may come when\nI can no longer remain in safety at Arcadia House. When it does I will\nlet you know by displaying a white signal in the western window of the\ncupola. Then you will come?\"\n\n\"I will come,\" he answered, albeit a little slowly and heavily as one\nwho seeks to find himself.\n\nEsmay opened the door and looked out. It was almost dark, and after\nlistening a moment she seemed satisfied.\n\n\"You have a ladder? Very well, you need not be afraid of the dogs, for\nwhen you see the signal I will arrange that they are kept in leash. And\nnow you had better go; they are surely unchained by this time, and any\nmoment may bring them ranging about. Good-bye, and remember your\npromise.\"\n\nThey walked along together until they came to the plantation of\nspruce-trees. Constans could see that his ladder was still in place on\nthe wall; his path of retreat was open. He put out his hand, and her\nslim, cool palm rested for a moment in his. She nodded, smiled, and left\nhim, going directly towards the house.\n\nMoved by an inexplicable impulse, Constans followed for a short\ndistance, keeping under the shelter of the trees. Then suddenly to him,\nstraining his eyes through the dusk, there appeared a second figure,\nthat of a woman, clothed wholly in white, hovering close upon the\nretreating steps of the girl.\n\nConstans felt his knees loosen under him, the ancient superstitions\nbeing still strong in his blood for all of his studies and new-found\nphilosophy.\n\n\"It is her sister Nanna,\" he muttered to himself, and knew that he lied\nin saying it. The old wives' tales, at which he had shuddered in\nboyhood, came crowding back upon him--grisly legends of vampire shapes\nand of the phantoms, invariably feminine in form, who were said to\ninhabit ruined places. A panic terror seized him as he watched the\napparition gliding so swiftly and noiselessly upon the unconscious girl.\nYet he continued to run forward, stumbling and slipping on the\ntreacherous foothold of melting snow.\n\nEsmay had reached a side door of the main building; quite naturally she\nentered and closed the door behind her, while the white-robed figure,\nafter hesitating a moment, walked to a far corner of the house and\ndisappeared. Out of the indefinite distance came the deep-throated bay\nof a hound. Constans turned and fled for his life.\n\nSafely astride the wall coping he looked back. All was quiet in the\ngarden, and at that instant a light shone out at an upper window of the\nhouse.\n\n\"She is safe,\" he told himself, and that was enough to know.\n\nAs he walked slowly westward, the thought of Ulick came again to him.\nHad he really promised the girl that he would tell Ulick nothing?\nRidiculous as it may appear, he could not remember.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nAS IN A LOOKING-GLASS\n\n\nArcadia House, while it certainly stood in need of the repairer's hand,\nwas by no means uninhabitable, a fact which spoke well for the honesty\nof its old-time builders. Its oak beams, fastened together with\ntree-nails instead of iron spikes, were still sound, and its brick\nwalls, unusually massive in construction, were without a crack. Most\nimportant of all, the roof, shingled with the best cypress, remained\nwater-tight, and so protected the interior from the ruinous effects of\nmoisture. In outward appearance, however, Arcadia House had sadly\ndegenerated. The stucco that originally covered the outer walls had\nfallen away here and there, leaving unsightly patches to vex the eye,\nand in many of the windows the glazing had been destroyed either wholly\nor in part.\n\nSome years before Quinton Edge had taken possession of this abandoned\nEden. The summers in the city were usually warm, and the Doomsmen were\nin the habit of seeking the upper stories of the tall buildings for\nrelief, just as in the twentieth century people went to the mountains\nfor the heated term. Quinton Edge, having accidentally discovered\nArcadia House recognized its advantages as a summer residence, and he\nhad his own reasons for desiring the privacy that its secluded\nsituation afforded. He was satisfied with putting three or four of the\nrooms into livable condition, and as for the rest it was only necessary\nto repair the wall surrounding the grounds and stock the storehouses\nwith fuel and provisions to make of Arcadia House the proverbial castle.\nThat it _was_ his castle was his own affair, and he had taken care that\nonly the fewest possible number should be in the secret. Old Kurt and a\ncouple of negro slave women made up the ordinary domestic staff of the\nestablishment, and until the advent of Esmay and Nanna, some three\nmonths before, Arcadia House had received no visitors. And he would be a\nfoolish man who called upon Quinton Edge without an invitation.\n\nEsmay, after parting from Constans, paused a moment at the side entrance\nof the house. She wanted to look back, but a stronger instinct forbade\nit; she opened the door and passed into the hall.\n\nIt was a broad, low-ceilinged apartment, and served as a common\nliving-room to the master of Arcadia House and his guests. A few embers\nburned on the hearth, and a solitary candle set in a wall-sconce strove\nwith its feeble glimmer against the full tide of silver moonshine that\npoured in through the uncurtained windows facing on the river. Quinton\nEdge himself was sitting at the corner of the fireplace smoking a\nred-clay pipe with a reed stem. He rose as Esmay entered, detaining her\nwith a gesture as she would have passed him.\n\n\"One moment, if you will.\"\n\nThe girl stopped and waited for him to continue. He considered a moment,\nlooking her over coolly. And indeed she made an attractive picture as\nshe stood there, the firelight glinting redly in her tawny eyes and her\ncheeks incarnadined with excitement. Quinton Edge told himself that he\nhad made no mistake. Then he spoke:\n\n\"You have waited most patiently for me to announce my intentions. Let me\nsee; it is nearly three months since you came to Arcadia House?\"\n\nThe girl made no reply. Alert and keeping herself well in hand, she\nwould force him to the first move. And Quinton Edge realized that he\nwould have to make it.\n\n\"It won't be any news to you that there are several people who would be\nglad to be informed of your whereabouts. There's Boris, for one, and\nyoung Ulick--we spoke of them some time ago.\"\n\n\"But to no purpose, sir; you remember that.\"\n\n\"Perfectly. Still, in three months a woman may change her mind many\ntimes.\"\n\n\"But only for her own satisfaction.\"\n\n\"Then it is hopeless to expect a decision from you?\"\n\n\"Evidently.\"\n\n\"In that case it may become necessary for me to act for you.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\nThe exclamation told its own story, and the girl in her vexation bit the\nlip that had betrayed her. Quinton Edge smiled.\n\n\"Don't distress yourself,\" he said, smoothly. \"I am only giving you the\nwarning that courtesy entitles you to receive.\"\n\nEsmay reflected. Whatever his intentions concerning her, she could not\nbe the worse off for knowing them. So she went on, steadily:\n\n\"Since you have already decided upon my future, argument would be\nuseless. But perhaps I may assume that you have acted with some small\nregard for my interests.\"\n\n\"Not the least in the world,\" returned Quinton Edge, and Esmay smiled\ninvoluntarily at frankness so unblushing. Whereupon and curiously\nenough, Quinton Edge became suddenly of a great gravity, the flippancy\nof his accustomed manner falling from him as a cloak drops unnoticed\nfrom a man's shoulders. He rose to his feet, strode to a window, and\nstood there for perhaps a minute looking out upon the moonlit waters of\nthe Lesser river. When he turned again to the girl there were lines of\nhardness about his mouth that she had never noticed before. Yet, in\nspeaking, his voice was soft, almost hesitating.\n\n\"Why should I tell you of these things, and then again why not? We are\nboth children of the Doomsmen, and the matter concerns us nearly. Not\nequally, of course, but listen and draw your own conclusions.\"\n\n\"There are clouds in the political sky, and our little ship of state is\nin danger of going upon the rocks, coincident with the death of Dom\nGillian, its old-time helmsman. And that contingency in the natural\ncourse of events cannot be long delayed.\n\n\"Now there are two nominal heirs--Boris and Ulick. Each deems himself\nthe chosen successor to his great-grandfather, and each is incompetent\nto play the part. In the past the reins of power have been held by the\nman who stands between them. I am that third man.\"\n\n\"As everybody knows now.\"\n\n\"No; and for the simple reason that there are few to care who rules so\nlong as the figure-head remains a presentable one. But let me continue.\n\n\"Dom Gillian will formally nominate one of his grandsons as his heir. It\nmakes no difference whether Boris or Ulick succeeds--the outcome must be\nthe same. Both have personal followings, and that of the disappointed\none will form a minority insignificant in numerical strength, but\ncapable of being kneaded by strong hands into a compact mass.\"\n\n\"A revolution, then?\"\n\n\"By no means. I accept the situation as it is and simply turn it to my\nown advantage--as third man. This makes it necessary that the\ndisappointed one should become my absolute property. Now I hold the\nprice that he will demand for the surrender of his rights and\nfreedom--nothing less than yourself.\"\n\n\"I shall not affect to be surprised,\" said the girl, coolly. \"But are\nyou quite sure that I am valued at so high a figure? It would be\nmortifying for you to go into the market and find that your currency had\ndepreciated on your hands.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" he answered. \"The passion with Boris and Ulick alike\nis genuine enough, albeit of somewhat different sort. As you care for\nneither, it should be a matter of indifference whose property you\nbecome.\"\n\nThe blood burned redly under the girl's brown skin. \"No one but a woman\ncould know how unforgivable is that insult,\" she said. Then, with a\nsuddenly conceived appeal to the man himself:\n\n\"But why a bargain at all? You have the strength, the courage, the\nbrains--why chaffer when you have but to strike once to win all? You\nstand between Boris and Ulick; crush them both in a single embrace and\ntake their birthright of power.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said the Doomsman, contemptuously. \"Do you think that the mere\npossession of the wolf-skin is the object of the hunt? It is the game\nthat amuses me and not the final distribution of the stakes. The game, I\nsay, and it happens to suit my humor to play it in this particular way.\nYou are simply a piece on the board, and I may win with you or lose with\nyou, or conclude to throw you back in the box without playing you at\nall--just as it pleases me.\"\n\n\"The means are at least nobler than the end,\" retorted the girl. \"A\nlofty ambition, truly, to stand behind a screen and pull the strings of\na puppet, who in turn lords it over a handful of rick burners and cattle\nreivers. Even my uncle Hugolin, Councillor Primus of Croye, cuts a\nbetter figure when, clad in his state robe of silver-fox fur, he\npresides over his parliament of shopkeepers.\"\n\n\"Granted,\" returned Quinton Edge, \"but one and all dance together when I\nchoose to pipe. Is it such a contemptible thing to rule a small world,\nif, indeed, it be the world? I take all that there is to be taken. Could\nAlexander or C\u00e6sar do more?\"\n\n\"I am beginning to comprehend,\" she said, slowly. \"An ambition that\nconfessedly overleaps all bounds is at least not an ignoble one.\"\n\nHe turned and searched her eyes.\n\n\"You will play the game with me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Yet a moment ago you were considering it--the possibility, I mean.\"\n\n\"For the moment--yes. After three months of Arcadia House dulness\nalmost any amusement would seem worth while. But, frankly speaking, it\nis the nature of the risk that appalls me. I cannot afford to lose my\nstake nor even to adventure it.\"\n\n\"To speak plainly?\"\n\n\"Well, then, you contribute to the common capital but one thing--your\nbrains. Later on, if the play goes against us, you may have to throw on\nthe table your liberty, and, in the last extremity, your life. But that\nis the utmost limit of your losses. I, on the contrary, must contribute\nmyself to the hazard, and no man understands what that means to a\nwoman.\"\n\n\"How long is it since the woman has understood?\" he asked, mockingly,\nbut Esmay was silent.\n\n\"Well, then, if I cannot have you with me I want you actively against\nme--the more balls in the air, the better sport for the juggler. And at\nleast we understand each other.\"\n\n\"There is just the one question--perhaps an obvious one.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Boris or Ulick? For of course you know which of them is to be the old\nDom's heir.\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"I am to be informed of my purchaser's name--after the bargaining is\nover? And only then?\"\n\n\"Since you choose to put it in that way--yes.\"\n\nNeither chose to break the silence that fell between them, and Esmay,\ncatching up her skirt, turned to go.\n\n\"Good-night,\" she said, but Quinton Edge did not answer. Apparently he\nhad forgotten her very existence; he sat with feet out-stretched to the\nfire, his eyes fixed upon the curl of blue smoke that hung above his\npipe bowl.\n\nEsmay went up to the room on the second floor which she shared with her\nsister. Nanna was already in bed and asleep, but she started up as Esmay\nentered, like a dog that has been listening in its dreams for its\nmaster's footsteps. \"Are you coming to bed?\" she asked, drowsily, and\nfell back among the pillows without even waiting for the answer.\n\nEsmay, unconscious of the cold, remained seated at the window looking\nout upon the river, her mind busy with the ultimatum which had just been\npresented to it. That it was an ultimatum, she could not doubt; Quinton\nEdge had been in deadly earnest in confronting her with her fate--a\ndouble-faced one, as she thought, with a little shiver. She could not\navoid seeing it, no matter which way she turned.\n\nA waning moon in a clouding sky. Even as she looked the two faces seemed\nto start out from the uncertain shadows--Boris, the Butcher--involuntarily,\nshe shrank back from the window--never that!\n\nUlick? Yes, she had been fond of Ulick; they had been comrades and\nfriends for so long as she could remember. But Ulick in this new\nlight--ah, that was different again. Strangely enough she found herself\ncontemplating this last possibility even more fearfully than she had the\nfirst. If the \"Butcher\" but laid a finger upon her, surely her arm was\nstrong enough to drive the dagger home. But if it were Ulick, what could\nshe do but turn the weapon against her own breast.\n\nPlan and counterplan, and the argument invariably came back to where it\nbegan--she must call upon Constans for the aid which he had promised to\nplace at her disposal. Hardly two hours had passed since they had made\nthe compact, and now she was come to ask for its fulfilment. What would\nhe think of her? How interpret a precipitancy so foreign to the cool\nassurance of her bearing in the garden? She frowned; the instinct that\nurges a woman to any folly short of the supreme blunder of unveiling\nherself to masculine eyes took possession of her. But only for a moment,\nfor again the imminence of the peril in which she stood broke over her\nlike a wave. There was but one thing to do; the signal must be set this\nvery night. The returning expedition from the south might even now be\nencamped at the High Bridge, and if Constans could help her at all it\nmust be at once.\n\nWithout waiting to parley further with herself, Esmay went to the door\nopening into the hall and looked out. The hour must be close upon\nmidnight; the house was quiet and dark.\n\nA piece of white cloth had been the signal agreed upon, and a fluttering\nhandkerchief should answer the purpose well enough without being too\nconspicuous to alien eyes. Nanna still slept, and Esmay, slipping into\nthe hallway, stood listening for a moment. Then she went on boldly; the\nmoon was still high, and she would not need a light.\n\nIt had been arranged that the signal should be displayed from the\nsouthwestern window of the cupola crowning the main roof. But the stairs\nto the third story and attic were in a wing; to reach them she must\ntraverse a long corridor which led past the apartments occupied by\nQuinton Edge. Esmay noticed a gleam of yellow light upon the threshold\nof his half-closed door as she passed it on winged feet, but there was\nnothing extraordinary in that--it often burned there throughout the\nentire night. But he was talking to somebody; she could hear distinctly\nthe opposition of the two voices. Who could it be? for none of the\nservants ever entered these rooms, and she had never known of any\nstranger being invited thither. She stopped and listened for a moment or\ntwo. But she could make out nothing distinctly, and then she flushed\nhotly to think that she had been tempted to eavesdropping. Let her be\nsatisfied in knowing that Quinton Edge was in his room and busily\nengaged; at least, he would not disturb her.\n\nThe upper stories of the house had not been occupied for many years, and\nit took all the girl's courage to carry her through the shadow-haunted\ngarret and up the ladder leading to the cupola proper. But she\naccomplished the task of putting the signal-cloth in position, and,\nstill shaking with cold and excitement, began to retrace her steps.\n\nAt the entrance to Quinton Edge's room she stopped again, not out of\ncuriosity, but as though yielding to the pressure of an invisible hand.\nThe door still stood ajar, but there was no sound of voices. Again it\nwas the invisible hand that seemed to draw the door away, permitting the\ngirl to look within. An empty room, save for the figure that sat at the\ntable, his head buried in his hands, the whole attitude one of intense\nweariness and dejection. Even as she stood there he looked up, and she\nsaw his face mirrored in the glass that hung suspended from the opposite\nwall. It was Quinton Edge's face, indisputably; but could she ever have\nimagined that such capacity of pain lay behind the mask she knew so\nwell? The dark eyes seemed to seize and hold her fast; then she realized\nthat they saw nothing beyond their own mirrored reflection. Again the\nhead sank forward into the hollowed hands, and only the slow heave of\nthe shoulders made certain that it was a living man who sat there in the\nsilence.\n\nNoiselessly closing the door, Esmay regained her room and, all clothed\nas she was, crept into bed. Nanna stirred sleepily and put out a\nprotecting arm. How blessed the comfort of that strong, warm clasp!\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nTHE AWAKENING\n\n\nConstans climbed to his observatory on the roof of the \"Flat-iron\" as\nusual that next morning. It was a fine, bright day and so clear that he\ncould see for miles without the use of his glass. And there was\nsomething to see--far away to the north he discovered a thin thread of\nsmoke that must mark the spot of a newly extinguished camp-fire. At last\nthe raiders were back from the Southland; they would be within the city\nboundaries by this time and should arrive at the Citadel Square by noon\nat the latest.\n\nGlancing down into the fortress he saw that already tidings of the\nreturn must have been received. Torch signals had probably been sent\nduring the night from the High Bridge announcing the fact of the\narrival, and now all was bustle and excitement.\n\nIt was a colorful and inspiriting scene--soldiers engaged in polishing\ntheir accoutrements or clouting up hitherto neglected rents in cloak or\ntunic; musicians tuning their simple instruments; negro slaves grooming\nhorses; women busy over saucepans that bubbled upon extemporized\nfurnaces of piled-up bricks; children and dogs on all sides, chattering,\nsquealing, under everybody's feet, alternately and impartially cuffed\nand caressed. An air of joyous expectancy lightened every face, for now\nthe long months of waiting and of anxiety were past; the outriders of\nDoom had returned from the Southland with goodly store of corn and wine\nand of fat beeves for future feasting. It was, indeed, chilled and aged\nblood that did not run the faster on this day of days.\n\nOutside of the White Tower stood a groom, holding the bridle of a horse\nwhose housings were of the most gorgeous description, a blaze of crimson\ncloth and gold thread. The owner's spear, with its pennon of embroidered\nsilk, stood close at hand, its iron-shod shaft wedged tightly into a\nconvenient crack in the pavement. Upon the banneret, Constans, with his\nglass, made out the symbol used by Quinton Edge, a raven in mid-air\nbearing a skull in his beak. Evidently he was to command the guard of\nhonor who would escort the returned warriors down the Palace Road, and\nthe hour must be close at hand. A few moments later and Quinton Edge\nhimself appeared, issuing forth from the White Tower. A splendidly\ngorgeous figure he presented, for over his close-fitting suit of claret\ncloth he wore a surcoat of white velvet ornamented with gold lace and\nbuttons of amethyst. His hat of soft felt was decorated with a white\nostrich-plume, exquisitely curled and secured by a jewelled clasp, and\nin his left hand he carried an ivory truncheon tipped with gold, the\nemblem, doubtless, of his high position in the councils of the Doomsmen.\nApparently he was in good-humor this morning; he chatted animatedly with\nthose nearest to him, and once or twice he even laughed aloud.\n\nA trumpet sounded, and, without much pretence at military smartness, the\nescorting party scrambled into their saddles and the cavalcade moved\nforward through the north gate and up the Palace Road. By noon at the\nlatest they should return, and preparations immediately began for the\nfeast that was to be given in honor of the long-absent warriors now\nhappily restored to the society of their families and friends. A score\nor more of wine-casks were rolled out from the public stores and made\nready for broaching. In the centre of the square the board flooring had\nbeen removed from a huge circular pit that measured twenty feet across\nby six or eight in depth; it was lined and bottomed with flat\npaving-stones. A fire of hard-wood had been burning in it for hours, the\npreliminary to a gigantic barbecue of fat oxen. Upon the open space in\nfront of the guard-huts, slaves were erecting long trestle-tables to\nserve as the banqueting-board. The day had turned so warm that there\nwould be no discomfort in dining out-of-doors, for all that the date was\nMarch 22d and the last snow-fall still lay a foot or more in depth in\nthe side streets. The square itself had been thoroughly cleaned, or it\nwould have been a veritable sea of slush. Astonishing! but as the sun's\nrays became more and more inclined to the vertical, it became apparent\nthat the day would not only be warm but actually hot.\n\nConstans had grown tired of making his observations at long range; he\nresolved to descend and mingle boldly with the people in the square. He\nhad only Quinton Edge to fear, and it should be easy to keep out of his\nway. Moreover, this was a golden chance for him to pick up some intimate\ninformation about the defences of the Citadel Square.\n\nCarefully adjusting the details of his ecclesiastical costume, Constans\nprepared to descend. His last act was to cast a perfunctory glance in\nthe direction of Arcadia House, and it seemed that his eye caught the\nflutter of something white. He raised the binoculars--it was true, the\nsignal was there, a handkerchief tied to the lattice-blind of the cupola\nwindow.\n\nConstans frowned and reflected. It was only last night that the girl had\nasserted her entire ability to look after herself--it was like a woman\nto be so soon of another mind. And there was Ulick--Ulick who would have\nshed the last drop in his veins to serve her. Yet she would have none of\nhim, and she had deliberately tied Constans's hands in exacting the\npromise that he should not reveal her whereabouts to the man who of all\nthings desired to serve her. There could be no reasoning with this\nwilful young person; she would have her way in spite of all the\nmasculine logic in the world, and he realized the fact with a growing\nresentment.\n\nYet there was his promise and it must be kept. He would go again to\nArcadia House sometime during the afternoon or evening, for the matter\nwas not one of absolute urgency. In the latter case two signals would\nhave been displayed, and there was but the one. So, dismissing the\nmatter from mind for the present, he made his way to the street and\njoined with the crowd that was continually passing in and out of the\nnorth gate.\n\nWith an air of easy unconcern, he directed his steps towards the\nentrance. A harsh croak greeted him, and he recognized the crippled\nsailor who called himself Kurt the Knacker. He glanced up to see that\nworthy ensconced in a snug corner of the gateway and surrounded by his\naccustomed cronies the warders on duty. Plainly, there had been more\nthan one replenishing of the black-jack that stood on the settle beside\nhim, for his face was flushed and the purple veins in his high, bald\nforehead presented an inordinately swollen appearance.\n\n\"Hola! shipmet,\" said the Knacker, in a tone that was doubtless intended\nto be affable. \"It is to be a brave show to-day and you are come in good\ntime to see it. Seven thunders! but one always sees the black-jackets\nflocking thick as flies in a pudding when the smell of the saucepan is\nin the air. Your master yonder was of too proud a stomach to clink can\nwith us, but you will be more amiable. There's a fresh cask on the\ntrestles and not a token to pay.\"\n\nConstans, following the direction in which a stubby forefinger pointed,\ncaught sight of the tall form of Prosper, the priest. He was moving\nslowly along in the press and only a few yards away. Now Constans had no\ndesire for a meeting with his ecclesiastical superior; so, without\ntroubling himself to reply to the Knacker's hospitable invitation, he\ntried to edge forward and again seek concealment in the crowd. But Kurt\nreached out and caught his sleeve. \"No skulking, reverend sir,\" he said,\nmaliciously. \"Which shall it be, a swig from my black-jack or a full\ntoss of the horn? For drink you must, if you would enter here.\"\n\nOne of the guardsmen held out a full ox-horn of wine, and the Knacker\nseized it and forced it into Constans's hand.\n\n\"After all, the good malt is for stronger stomachs; wine is the tipple\nfor women, boys, and priests. Down with it right cheerfully or take a\nsousing in the butt itself--to drown there or drink it dry.\"\n\nIt was not a prudent thing to do, but Constans was angry. Seizing the\nox-horn, he dashed its contents full in his tormentor's face, and Kurt,\nthe Knacker, half strangled, fell back coughing and breathing\nstertorously. It was a critical moment, but luckily the temper of the\nby-standers was in mood to be amused. A great roar of laughter went up,\nand under cover of it Constans managed to push his way on through the\ncrowd and so reach the open square. Stepping into one of the empty\nguard-huts he quickly divested himself of cowl and cassock, and rolling\nthem up into a bundle he tossed them into a dark corner. His under suit\nwas made of the ordinary gray frieze worn generally among the Doomsmen,\nand now neither Prosper nor the witnesses of the fracas at the gate\nwould be likely to identify him.\n\nConstans gazed about him with lively interest. Yet so accurate had been\nhis previous bird's-eye observations that he found but little to add to\nthem. He noticed, however, that a banquette of earth, rammed hard, ran\naround the inside periphery of the walls, affording vantage for the\ndefenders to discharge their arrows and other missiles over the parapet.\nBut, as Constans quickly saw, this same terrace would give useful\nfoothold to the besiegers should once the top of the wall be gained.\nInstead of being obliged to draw up their scaling-ladders, or risk the\nsixteen-foot drop to the hard surface of the enclosure, they had only to\njump onto the banquette and from thence to the ground. He would have\nliked to investigate what engines of defence could be brought into\nservice by the garrison, but there was nothing to be seen beyond two\nmachines, sadly out of repair, which were intended for the casting of\nheavy stones through the force of twisted ropes. So Constans turned his\nattention again to the scene before him.\n\nA gang of carpenters were putting the finishing-touches to an elevated\nplatform which stood near the entrance to the White Tower. A crimson\ncanopy warded off the sun's rays, and the structure was probably\nintended for the accommodation of the more distinguished guests. A large\nchair stood in the centre of the dais, and over it a gray wolf-skin had\nbeen draped; certainly this must be the official seat of Dom Gillian\nhimself. But as yet it stood empty.\n\nHow hot the sun was! And yet this was only the day of the vernal\nequinox; it was most extraordinary. Everywhere the gutters ran streaming\nwith water, the snow melting under the unexampled heat of the solar rays\nlike wax in a candle flame. The trees growing in the square were\nleafless, and the tropic sun's rays blazed mercilessly through their\nnaked branches. Constans found himself panting for breath.\n\nAs the hours dragged on Constans felt a vague uneasiness pressing down\nupon him, and he could see that the people also were growing restless\nunder the unaccountable delay. The laughter and talk little by little\ndied away; men stood in silent groups staring through the open gate, up\nthe long avenue of the Palace Road, shading their bent brows under their\nhollowed hands. Would they never come!\n\nWith noon a small diversion offered. Four negro slaves carrying a litter\nissued from the door of the White Tower. There was no mistaking that\ngreat head with its mane of coarse, white hair--the old Dom Gillian.\nWith infinite difficulty the attendants succeeded in hoisting the\nunwieldy bulk upon the platform, and so into the great chair. The people\nlooked on in silence; not a murmur of applause greeted the appearance of\ntheir lord. And with equal indifference did Dom Gillian regard his\npeople; plainly he was wearied, for his hands rested heavily upon the\narms of his chair, and he neither spoke nor moved. A slave stood on\neither hand wielding a fan; presently the gaunt figure seemed to\ncollapse into a heap, the eyes closed, and Dom Gillian slept.\n\nAgain the slow hours dragged along. The sun had already passed the\nzenith, the barbecue-fires were dying out, on the western sky-line\nrested a cloud in bigness like to a man's hand and of the blackness of\nnight itself. Would they never come!\n\nFar down the vista of the Palace Road a black dot stood out against the\nsnowy background. A moment later it had resolved itself into the figure\nof a horse and his rider. The man was riding fast, heedless of the\nslippery, dangerous footing; now he was at the gate and the crowd\npressed back to give him room. On and on, with the red drops falling\nfrom his spurs, until he drew rein at the very steps of the platform.\nAnd no man durst speak or move as Quinton Edge flung himself from the\nsaddle and ascended to where the Lord Keeper of Doom still slept\nplacidly in his great chair with the wolf-skin upon his knees.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\nA PROPHET OF EVIL\n\n\nStanding at Dom Gillian's side Quinton Edge bent down and whispered a\nfew words in his ear, inaudible even to those who stood nearest. And yet\nthe people knew that woe had fallen upon Doom. Like flame upon flax the\nvoiceless signal leaped from heart to heart; here and there in the crowd\nappeared little centres of disturbance, the strong pushing the weak\nforcibly aside that they might the quicker fill their own gasping lungs;\nan inarticulate murmur rose and swelled, like to the stirring of forest\nleaves under the breath of the rough north wind. Quinton Edge heard, and\nturned to face the people.\n\n\"It is true,\" he said, and gripped hard upon the rail on which his hand\nrested. \"A child's trick it was, but the Southlanders are men of smooth\ntongue and our brothers were encumbered with the cattle and perhaps\noverconfident now that their faces were turned at last towards home.\nSix-score brave men\"--he stopped and swallowed at something in his\nthroat.\n\n\"The ambuscade was well-planned, and the Southlanders had enlisted the\naid of the Painted Men, to their shame be it said. So our brethren found\nthemselves hemmed in at every point. Yet they sold their lives at a\ngood price, and they are mourning to-day in the Southland, even as we\nhere. Not a Doomsman set out upon his long journey to the shadowland but\nthat a Southron was forced to bear him company. It was well done--a good\nfight, the sword-point driven home, and then the dropping of the\ncurtain. Hail! a hail! to our brothers who have passed beyond.\"\n\nA few wavering and uncertain voices took up the cry, but it quickly died\naway before the uplifted hand of Prosper, the priest. He had pushed his\nway through the crowd and was now standing in its outmost rank directly\nopposite the platform.\n\n\"There were six-score who rode away,\" he said, addressing himself\ndirectly to Quinton Edge. \"Six-score, and how many have returned?\"\n\nAn insolent question in the manner of its asking, but the Doomsman's\nanswer matched it well.\n\n\"Four that I counted, but there may be a straggler or two to come in\nlater. Does the Shining One no longer know where his own thunderbolts\nhave struck, that he sends his hired servants to gather up the gossip of\nthe market-place?\"\n\n\"The All-Wise both sees and knows,\" retorted the priest. \"It is the\npeople you deceive who have need to look and listen, if haply they may\nunderstand. You have dared to take the name of the Shining One upon your\nlips; stand forth now like a man, if you would face him in his wrath.\"\n\nDuring the past few minutes it had grown suddenly dark; the sun had\ndisappeared and a curtain of opaque cloud was rapidly overcasting the\nsky; a peculiar, yellowish light had replaced the radiance of day.\n\n\"And what does your god demand that his anger may be turned away?\" asked\nQuinton Edge. \"Doubtless the daily offerings upon which his faithful\npriests depend for their easy, unearned living. Sides of fat beeves and\nmeasures of wheat, not forgetting a cask or two of apple-wine or corn\nbrandy.\"\n\nBut the priest, disdaining to answer the taunt, had turned and was\nspeaking directly to the people.\n\n\"Is it that you seek a deliverer and find none? But how shall the\nShining One keep faith with you who turn your feet away from his\nsanctuary and bring no victims to his altars? Has he not called to you\ndaily, and have you not stopped your ears? And now that ye call in turn,\nshall he indeed hear? Already is your woe come upon you, children of\nDoom. Look and listen!\"\n\nA flash of lightning accompanied the priest's last words and the crash\nof the thunder came almost simultaneously. The obscurity was momentarily\nincreasing, and the gigantic, nimbus cloud-band now reached far beyond\nthe zenith, its slate-blue edges contrasting vividly with the\ngreen-and-saffron tints of the narrow strip of clear sky that still\nremained visible. And in another moment that, too, had disappeared; such\nwas the darkness that a man could not see his neighbor's face, though\ntheir elbows might be touching.\n\n\"To your holes and dens!\" shouted the priest, now quite beside himself\nin his fanatical exaltation. \"He speaks again, he speaks again! Woe, woe\nto the city of Doom!\" Once more the firmament seemed cleft in twain, and\nthe earth trembled under the reverberations of the tremendous electrical\ndischarges. The effect upon the overwrought nerves of the throng was\ninstantaneous; as one man the crowd turned and made for the exits from\nthe Citadel Square. Even the personal attendants upon Dom Gillian were\naffected by the panic, and leaped over the guard-rails of the platform\ninto the mass of humanity below. In half a score of minutes the enormous\nsquare was deserted save for a few infirm and crippled stragglers, and\nConstans himself thought it prudent to withdraw to the shelter of one of\nthe guard-huts from whose doorway he could still watch the progress of\nevents.\n\nOnly Prosper, the priest, remained in the open, standing there with\nuplifted hands and gazing steadfastly into the sable vault above him.\nQuinton Edge called to him, but he answered not. Then the Doomsman,\nleaning far over the balustrade of the platform, struck the priest\nsharply on the shoulder with his truncheon of office.\n\n\"Come up here and help me with the Lord Keeper. These dogs have all\nsought their kennels and left us to shift for ourselves.\"\n\nGathering up his long, black robe, Prosper ascended the steps of the\nplatform and passed to the Lord Keeper's side. He looked eagerly into\nDom Gillian's eyes, but the old man's face might have been a mask in its\nimpassive stolidity. Plainly he had neither heard nor understood aught\nof all that had passed.\n\n\"It is too late,\" muttered the priest. \"The crash of steel is now the\nonly music to which the old lion will prick his ears, and the Shining\nOne must strike for his own honor.\"\n\nSuddenly the obscurity lightened. A downpour of rain was imminent, but\nthe sky had lost its terrifying aspect of abnormality; the yellowish\nhaze that in superstitious eyes presaged some dreadful convulsion of\nnature had drifted away before the rising wind--it would be a pelting\nshower and nothing more. Quinton Edge looked around, smiling.\n\n\"So it was only a player's effect--a few fireworks and the rattling of a\nbig drum--an opportune conjunction of bad news and bad weather that is\nhardly likely to occur again. The next time that the Shining One\ncondescends to forge his thunderbolts----\"\n\n\"They will fall from out of a cloudless sky,\" interrupted the priest,\nwith a vehemence that in spite of himself shook the cool confidence of\nthe Doomsman. Yet the latter flung back the challenge contemptuously.\n\n\"Words, words--painted bladders with which to belabor the backs of fools\nand children. It calls for a buffet of sturdier sort to convince a man.\"\n\nThe priest measured his adversary. \"Let it be a blow, then,\" he said,\ncoldly, \"since a prating mouth knows no other argument than the mailed\nfist. But you shall not see the hand that smites, nor even know the\nquarter from whence it comes. Build high your walls and your bulwarks;\nthey shall but prove the greater peril when they crumble under the\nimpact of our lord's hammer. You will believe; yes, when trencher-mate\nand bedfellow are stricken at your side, and yet no man shall be able to\nsay at what instant the avenger's shadow passed between, or catch the\nfaintest sound of his retreating footsteps. All in his good time to whom\na day and an hour and a cycle of the ages are as one.\"\n\nA dozen big raindrops splashed down, and from the distance came the\npatter of the advancing hail. Quinton Edge drew himself up stiffly; the\nnecessity of immediate action was a relief more welcome than he would\nhave cared to own. He stepped to Dom Gillian's chair, and, putting his\nhands under the armpits of the old man, lifted him unresisting to his\nfeet.\n\n\"Help me with him to the White Tower,\" he said, with curt command, and\nProsper obeyed in silence. Together they managed to get Dom Gillian down\nthe steps and across the open space to the entrance of the tower, barely\ngaining the shelter when the storm broke in earnest, the rain coming\ndown in great, gray masses as though the clouds had been literally torn\nasunder by the weight of their burden. For a few moments everything was\nblotted out by the deluge, then it lightened again with the coming of\nthe hail, and Constans drew in his breath sharply as he saw a little\ncavalcade trotting slowly through the north gate from the Palace Road.\nFirst came a few of the escort-guard and behind them three or four\ntroopers, survivors of the ill-fated expedition, followed by a couple of\nhorse-litters, improvised from fence-poles and blankets. In these rough\nbeds lay two grievously wounded men, and Constans gazed, half in hope,\nhalf in fear, upon their wan faces upon which the stinging hail beat\ndown. Soldierly men they were, too, for they made no complaint, but\nUlick was not one of them. A moment later Constans saw him bringing up\nthe rear on a big bay horse. He had a bandage about his head, and looked\nthin and careworn, but he was alive, and Constans felt glad at heart for\nhis friend. He managed to catch Ulick's eye as the train swept by, and\nfor an instant the latter drew rein, bending low over his saddle-bow as\nhe whispered to Constans, standing in the shadow of the guard-hut:\n\n\"In half an hour at the old library,\" and then, with passionate\neagerness, \"Esmay--have you seen her?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Constans, and the next instant could have bitten his\nunthinking tongue in twain.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\nIN QUINTON EDGE'S GARDEN\n\n\nIt was late that night when the friends finally parted. Their interview\nhad been a trying one; it might have ended in a serious estrangement had\nConstans been of nature less straightforward or Ulick of disposition\nless generous. Friendship between men is a beautiful thing, but of such\ndelicate poise that only the touch of a finger is needed to displace it.\nAnd the disturbing hand is generally that of a woman. Esmay had come\nbetween them, and it needed but the mention of her name that a certain\nconstraint should at once manifest itself.\n\n\"We'll have to drop the subject, then, or, rather, leave it where it\nbegan,\" said Ulick, breaking the final pause. \"Perhaps it's just as well\nthat I don't understand the reason why--it's even possible that you\ndon't know clearly yourself. I sha'n't ask you to tell me.\"\n\nConstance flushed, and was angry with himself, at this evidence of a\nweakness so unexpected. \"It can't go on in this way,\" he said,\ndecidedly. \"Neither of us could wish that, and it lies with me to make\nit plain--to her, you know. Of course, you must have guessed that there\nare certain contingencies----\" He stopped abruptly, as the remembrance\nof what Esmay had said rushed back upon him. \"I don't see that Boris is\nwith you,\" he continued, gravely.\n\n\"He lies under the shadow of the southern pines--one of the first to\nfall that morning when the storm of gray goose arrows drove down upon\nus. A good end and perhaps the better one.\"\n\nConstans was silent. Here was one of his contingencies that existed no\nlonger; with Boris out of the way, the decision that Esmay must make was\nenormously simplified. Or was it still more infinitely complicated? With\na woman to consider, the question was not so easy to answer. Nor would\nhe attempt it. He rose, and put out his hand, \"I am going to tell her,\"\nhe said, simply, and Ulick, in his turn, had no further word to say; so\nthey parted.\n\nIt was not until noon of the following day that Constans found\nopportunity to set out for Arcadia House, for all that morning he had\nbeen kept in close attendance at the temple. The old priest had\ndisplayed a new and astonishingly practical interest in the mysterious\npower that had been for so long under his nominal control; he had even\njoined Constans in the latter's daily task of cleaning and polishing up\nthe working-parts of the machinery, and, as they worked, he had\nquestioned him searchingly.\n\n\"The Shining One may be a god or no,\" he said, cunningly, \"but it is\nmeet that I should know him better, if only to serve him the more\nfaithfully. You, my son, are wise, and you will tell me what you have\nlearned from your books, that it may be added to all that our fathers\nhave handed down by word of mouth. So shall our lord have great honor,\nand the unbelievers be put to shame.\"\n\nConstans had no recourse but to obey, and for several hours they worked\nsteadily, experimenting with the intricacies of switch-board and\ncommutator, stringing various wires about the hall and noting the\nconditions under which they might be charged and discharged from the\ncentral source of power. Dangerous work, as they came to realize after\nConstans had narrowly escaped being burned by contact with a live wire.\nYet undeniably fascinating, this uncovering of a great world secret,\nthis sense of growing mastery over a power that could be none else than\ntwin-brother to the thunderbolt. But the face of the old man gave no\nsign, no one could have guessed whether he now believed all or believed\nnothing. Certainly he was proving himself an astonishingly apt pupil,\nhis years of practical experience with the machines admirably\nsupplementing Constans's theoretical knowledge. It was not until mid-day\nthat he gave the order to shut down the engines, and Constans was at\nliberty.\n\nHe walked rapidly in the direction of Arcadia House, for this was the\nhour of the principal meal with the Doomsmen, and the streets were\nentirely deserted. The abnormally high temperature of yesterday still\nprevailed, although the sky was clear, and everywhere could be heard the\nsound of running and dripping water. The snow, that twenty-four hours\nago lay a foot deep upon the ground, was now a mass of slush, making\nlocomotion exceedingly disagreeable. How hot the sun was! it might have\nbeen midsummer instead of the last of March; how oddly sounded the\npremature chirping of the birds in the leafless trees!\n\nArcadia House was once more in sight, and Constans's first thought was\nfor the signal. It was still flying from the cupola window, but that\nfact, of itself, meant little. All or nothing might have happened in the\ntwenty-four hours that had elapsed since its first setting.\n\nThe rope-ladder was in its hiding-place, and Constans, by its aid, was\nquickly on the garden wall. Here he waited for an instant, to look and\nlisten.\n\nAll was quiet, and there was no sign of life in the closely shuttered\nhouse. The snow in this exposed and sunny enclosure had entirely\ndisappeared; there would be no fear of his footprints being noticed. The\ndogs--but Esmay had assured him that they would be kept in leash so long\nas the signal was flying. He wasted no further time in reflection, but\ndescended into Quinton Edge's garden.\n\nThe plantation of spruce-trees screened him for the moment; then he ran\nswiftly across the open space and reached the shelter of the pavilion.\nIt was empty, but he had expected that; he had previously set his\nanswering signal at the window of a house overlooking the garden at the\nback, and he would now have to wait until Esmay should find opportunity\nto join him.\n\nAn hour passed, and there was no sign of her appearance. Constans grew\nrestless, impatient, uneasy, until finally inaction became intolerable.\nCertainly Esmay should have come by this time, supposing that she had\nobserved his answering signal. She might be absent, ill, a prisoner.\n\nHe looked searchingly at the apparently deserted house; the bold thought\nstruck him to examine it more closely, even at the risk of discovery. He\nhad his rope-ladder with him, and, at a pinch, could make a run for it.\nAlong the northern wall of the enclosure there was a wind-break of\nevergreens that would protect him up to the sunken carriageway, and,\nsurely, he could adventure thus far and then trust Fortune and his own\nwits for the next move.\n\nThe piece of open ground was some seventy yards in width; he crossed it\nat speed and dived into the shadow of the trees, keeping close to the\nwall as he worked along. He reached the road without misadventure and\ndropped lightly down upon its stone-paved surface. It was cool and damp\nin this semi-subterranean causeway; the stone flagging was blotched with\nlichenous growth, and ferns flourished rankly in the wall crevices.\nConstans stood for a moment gazing up at the blank fa\u00e7ade of the north\nwing, wondering how best to proceed. Then, suddenly, a face appeared at\na window; Esmay herself was looking down upon him in wide-eyed\nastonishment. She hesitated, then motioned him towards the eastern or\nriver side of the house, and he obeyed unquestioningly. Following the\ndriveway around, he found himself before the pillared portico that\nmasked the front of the main edifice; springing up the steps, he met her\nstanding at one of the long windows that opened off the drawing-room of\nthe mansion. She drew back, inviting him to enter.\n\n\"You are very foolish,\" she said, in a whisper, yet looked upon him\napprovingly as a woman always must upon the man who dares.\n\n\"I told you that I would come,\" he answered. \"Yesterday it was the\nunexpected that happened, the return of the expedition. Between the\nstorm and Ulick, you and the signal were clean put out of mind until too\nlate.\"\n\nShe flushed. \"Then you have seen Ulick?\"\n\n\"Yes; he is safe and well.\" He hesitated. How should he tell her the\ntruth about the other? He ended by blurting it out.\n\n\"You know that Boris--he will not return.\"\n\n\"He is dead?\"\n\nConstans nodded. The girl turned and looked out of the window for\nperhaps half a minute.\n\n\"I was to have decided between them this very day. He who is my master\nhad so determined, and that is why I sent for you. For indeed I\ncannot----\" She stopped; it was so difficult to put into words what must\nbe said. Then she went on, speaking softly:\n\n\"If it had finally come to that, I must have named Boris, for I could\nhave gone on hating him just the same as before. With Ulick it is\ndifferent, for he really cared.\"\n\n\"But now,\" interrupted Constans, impatiently, \"it is no longer a\nquestion of choice, but of a decision.\"\n\n\"I have already come to it,\" she returned. \"I must escape from Doom; I\ncannot stay here for even another day.\"\n\nIn their absorption neither noticed how the door leading into the\ncentral hall slowly opened. It remained ajar, its very attitude that of\na listener.\n\n\"You want my help,\" said Constans, half to himself. He was casting over\nin his mind the effect that the death of Boris might have upon Quinton\nEdge's intrigues, and he could not but conclude that Esmay had become a\nfactor more necessary than ever in their successful development. Ulick\nwas now the sole heir to the old Dom Gillian, and he was hostile to\nQuinton Edge. Only through Ulick's passion for this slip of a girl\ncould the Doomsman hope to control him. What an admirable stroke, then,\nto snatch the card from his hand before he had a chance to play it.\n\n\"I will help you,\" he continued, aloud. \"But where to find a boat?\"\n\n\"There is a canoe which is generally kept moored at the garden dock; you\ncan see it from the terrace. It is a good, stout dugout, and, oh----\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"There is Nanna, my sister; I cannot go without her.\"\n\n\"She is in no danger,\" said Constans, with calm indifference. \"The boat\nwill carry only two--is that it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Very well, then; Nanna must remain behind.\"\n\n\"It is impossible to leave her; I have promised.\"\n\n\"No; it is her coming that is impossible, and because I say so.\"\n\nThe girl remained silent. Had she yielded to a will stronger than her\nown? The door seemed to hesitate; then it closed noiselessly.\n\nEsmay crossed over to one of the windows opening on the garden grounds\nand flung the shutters open. The coolness of the later afternoon breeze\nfell gratefully upon her hot cheeks; the horizontal, reddish-rays of the\ndeclining sun emphasized the warm coloring of her hair and complexion,\nand brought out again those curious carmine flecks in her eyes of topaz\nthat Constans had noticed once or twice before. An odd combination, but\nhe realized now that he had thought it pretty. The girl divined the\nunspoken word and drew back a trifle.\n\nRetreat is the first and essential principle of feminine strategy, and\nin practice it should suggest the ambuscade to even the most thoughtless\nof masculine minds. But it never does. Constans stepped up a little\ncloser.\n\n\"Nanna must go with me,\" repeated the girl, hurriedly. \"You will help us\nto get out the boat and tell me in what direction Croye lies. We shall\nfind our way, never fear, for I know the stars, and Nanna can paddle all\nday long as well as a man.\"\n\n\"And what will you do when you get to Croye?\" asked Constans, gently.\n\"Must you hear the whole truth about your uncle, Messer Hugolin? It is\nnot that he is unable but unwilling to turn a hand in your behalf. The\nhumblest shelter, the meanest food--I know what you would say. But not\neven a night's housing in the cattle-byre or a plate of broken victuals\nis to be had from Messer Hugolin unless one is prepared to pay, and\nroundly, too. Remember that I, too, am of his blood, and have dwelt in\nhis house.\"\n\nThe girl's eyes grew cloudy and troubled. \"There is the town itself,\"\nshe faltered. \"Surely among so many people there must be some chance for\na livelihood--there is work---\"\n\n\"Not of the honest kind and for such as you,\" he retorted. \"Must I make\nyou understand? Look at yourself, then, in the glass behind you.\"\nSuddenly he took her hand between both his own. \"Who would dare hint at\nwork to those fingers so slimly white? But one may live delicately, even\nin Croye.\"\n\nThe girl recoiled as though from a blow, and Constans felt the shame of\nhaving actually struck one. \"But not you,\" he stammered, and raged\ninwardly at himself. She forgave him in a look. \"But, Esmay,\" he said,\nhumbly. She smiled to him to go on.\n\n\"You are thinking of the world beyond, but indeed you do not know\nit--its cruelty to the weak, above all to a woman. Here, at least----\"\n\n\"Here the least of all,\" she interrupted, but would not look at him to\nmake her meaning clearer.\n\n\"Yet you see how I could not let you go alone or even with Nanna,\" he\nurged.\n\n\"Yes, I understand that. What is it that you wish me to do?\"\n\nConstans started. Was he, then, prepared to make himself responsible for\nthis young creature's future? Of course she could not remain longer in a\nposition so dangerous and equivocal. But why should she not be\nreasonable? It was true that Nanna was quite capable of managing the\nboat; he had only to assist them to get away and give the word to Ulick\nthat he might follow. Ulick would go to the end of the world to serve\nher.\n\nA thoroughly sensible solution of the problem, and then in a twinkle\nConstans forgot that he had ever wanted Esmay to be reasonable, forgot\nthe faith owed to a friend and the vengeance sworn against an enemy,\nforgot times and seasons and the peril in which they stood, forgot all\nthings save that he was a man and she was a woman, and that he had\nsuddenly come to desire her above all else in life.\n\n\"A woman, and some day he would come to know what that meant.\" Now he\nknew.\n\nEsmay stood waiting for the answer to her question.\n\n\"You cannot go alone,\" he said, in a half-whisper, \"and your sister's\nprotection is useless. You will have to trust yourself to me.\"\n\nEsmay had turned away her head, but a treacherous mirror intercepted the\nconfession in her eyes and flung it back to him who had compelled its\nutterance. Now a man may never yet have seen that look on a woman's\nface, but he need not fear lest he fail to recognize it when at last his\ntime comes. Constans saw, and suddenly the primeval passion of the world\nseized and shook him. \"I want you,\" he said, and would have taken\nher--then stopped, confounded and appalled.\n\nThrough the open window came the sharp, staccato yelp of a hound at\nfield. Yes; the dogs were out, and already they were at work, ranging in\ngreat semicircles, alert with the joy of the chase. There was Blazer,\nwith his tawny muzzle, and behind him Fangs, the great, black bitch,\nhalf mastiff and half bloodhound, the saliva dripping from her jaws as\nshe ran. Constans drew a deep breath as he watched them. Already they\nwere nearing the pavilion; in a few seconds at the farthest they would\nbe giving tongue upon the striking of his scent. He must decide quickly\nthen, and he turned to Esmay.\n\nA black suspicion gathered in Constans's mind as he looked upon her mute\nagony and misinterpreted it.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked, with rising anger, but she answered no word. The\nmemory of the ancient betrayal rushed back upon him.\n\n\"Perhaps another bracelet of carbuncles?\" She shrank back as though from\na blow.\n\n\"Esmay!\" he said, roughly, and shook her by the shoulders, not being in\nfear for himself but intent upon knowing the truth, however incredible.\nThen as she still gave no sign he flung her from him and strode away,\nthe flame of a fierce anger in his heart. To die here--the base fate of\na runaway slave upon whose trail the master has set his hounds--no, it\nshould not be! Yet, with only his bare hands, for there was not even a\nbillet of wood lying about--well, if it must be-- Then he bethought him\nof the boat that Esmay had told him was always kept moored at the garden\nlanding-stage. He glanced out and saw that the canoe had disappeared. He\nturned to the girl and announced the fact. \"If indeed it were ever\nthere,\" he added. It seemed as though her eyes pointed to the door\nleading to the other part of the house, but he shook his head. \"I would\nrather meet it in the open,\" he said, coldly.\n\nHe considered a moment longer, and threw off his black soutane, having\ndetermined to take to the water, although it was truly a desperate\nchance, the current running like a mill-race with the ebbing tide, and,\nmoreover, being choked with ice-floes. Ah, there was Blazer's bay, he\nmust lose no time. Without another glance at that silent, rigid figure,\nhe stepped quickly through the long window and gained the portico.\nSomething snapped in the girl's throat, her lips quivered hysterically,\nand she laughed aloud, a flood of silvery sound.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\nTHE SILVER WHISTLE BLOWS\n\n\nConstans remained motionless at the window. Every instinct of\nself-preservation urged him onward, but yet he stopped and listened to a\ngirl's laughter. It ceased, and he sprang forward--too late! for already\nthe blood-hounds were upon him.\n\nFangs, the bitch, was in the lead, and as she sprang Constans kicked out\nsavagely, his heavy boot catching the animal squarely on the flank. The\nportico had no guard-railing, and the dog, taken off her balance, was\nprecipitated to the terrace below. Constans shouted exultantly, but\nthere was still Blazer with whom to deal. Before he could recover, the\nbrute had him by the throat and was bearing him downward; man and dog\nrolled together on the stone-paved floor of the gallery. Something\npassed with the swift rustle of wind-distended garments, but Constans\ncould see nothing, his eyes being blinded by the acrid foam from the\nanimal's jaws. Fortunately, the high collar of leather that he wore\nprevented the dog's teeth from fastening on his actual throat, but that\nadvantage could not endure, and already he could feel that the animal\nwas shifting its hold for a better one. Then, as he despaired, his right\nhand struck upon something round and hard in the outside-pocket of his\ndoublet; it was the handle of the loaded revolver that he had carried\nfor a month past. A supreme effort and he managed to seize it; without\nattempting to draw it from the pocket he pulled the trigger. The report\nfollowed, and immediately he felt the dog's grip relax; he pushed the\ndead weight from off his chest and rose to his feet.\n\nUp from the river terrace came Esmay, and behind her ran Quinton Edge.\nConstans turned to meet them; then, as they gained the portico, he saw\nthe girl's face go white and realized dizzily the danger that still\nmenaced him. But he was past caring now, and so stood stupidly in his\ntracks as the great, black bitch crawled up behind him, her belly close\nto the ground, and crouching for her rush. He heard Quinton Edge shout\nand saw him raise his hand; the dog, recognizing her master's voice,\neven as she leaped, was quick to obey, arching and stiffening her back\nin mid-air so as to break the force of her spring; he saw her fall in a\nheap at his feet, and lie there whimpering. Whereupon, for a brief\nmoment, the trees seemed to bow themselves before him and the sky grew\nblack.\n\nWhen again he found himself, he saw Quinton Edge bending over the dead\nhound and inspecting, with curious attention, the ragged hole in its\nchest. But the Doomsman asked no questions; he spoke, lightly and\ncarelessly, as was his wont.\n\n\"Fortunate that I happened to be returning from an excursion on the\nriver, for my pets are a difficult pair to manage, even for one who\ncarries a thunderbolt in his doublet-pocket. You scored nicely on poor\nBlazer, but I venture to think that Fangs would have avenged her mate\nhad I let her have her way.\" He stopped and patted the brute's huge\nhead. \"My compliments, old woman; doubtless this visitor of ours will\nalways remember you respectfully as one who feared neither God, man; nor\ndevil, but only Quinton Edge. Now be off with you.\" The hound licked her\nmaster's hand and limped away. Quinton Edge straightened up and passed\nhis lace-edged handkerchief across his lips. Then, with smooth irony:\n\"An honor, indeed, to entertain so unexpected a guest at Arcadia House;\nto what happy chance am I indebted?\"\n\n\"That I am here should be condemnation sufficient for your purpose,\"\nsaid Constans, slowly. \"I have nothing to add to it.\"\n\nHe hardly troubled to look up as he spoke; exhausted and dispirited as\nhe was, what did it matter what he answered.\n\n\"Then you do not even plead a first offence?\"\n\nConstans remained silent. Like a disobedient school-urchin, he told\nhimself, glowering sulkily in the presence of his tutor. Between this\nman and himself lay an enmity that was deeper than the grave, and yet to\nQuinton Edge he was merely the petulant boy to be scolded and punished\nor, even more contemptuously, ignored. Was he never to stand before him\nas man to man?\n\n\"It is just as well,\" continued the Doomsman, \"since there have been\nother eyes who have kept watch for me. I am not entirely uninformed\nconcerning a romantic adventure of two days ago at the pavilion in the\ngarden. But perhaps on this count the maid may choose to answer for\nherself, speech being a woman's prerogative, and ofttimes her\nopportunity.\"\n\nBut Esmay, holding herself as straight and white as the portico column\nbehind her, made no sign of even hearing, and Quinton Edge fell upon a\nsudden earnestness of speech and manner.\n\n\"Then since neither of you have a word to say, you must perforce listen\nto me of a matter equally concerning you, Esmay Scarlett, a daughter of\nthe Doomsmen, and you, Constans, son of Gavan of the keep. For to-day\nthe fate of the world lies between us three--a ball that we may toss\nfrom hand to hand.\n\n\"You know both the strength and the weakness of Doom. We have lost\nheavily in the expedition to the south; every man in the reserve must\nnow be called upon to fill up the ranks. Dom Gillian is fast sinking\ninto the grave, where Boris already lies. Ulick, who must now succeed,\nin the ordinary course, has only physical courage to recommend him. That\nis not enough if Doom is to remain mistress of the world.\n\n\"Yet if our weaknesses are patent, no less apparent are our springs of\npower. Here in Doom and here alone will you find that unity of action\nwhich makes for empire. Were the Stockaders and the House People to join\nhands they could overwhelm us in a night, but they will not, since\njealousy digs an ever-widening chasm. Moreover, it is a strong position\nthat we hold here in this wilderness of stone, when every brick is a\nman. There is no need for boasting; this is the truth, as you know.\n\n\"Yet there is one thing lacking--a man to lead and a brain to guide.\nUlick may possess the strong arm, and doubtless I have the wits, but I\nfear that, like oil and water, we, too, shall never mix. Besides, I may\ngrow weary of the business, or the time may come when I must turn my\nback upon it all. Yet I could not be content that chaos should reign in\nmy stead. I must leave a man behind me, and that man is you, Constans,\nson of Gavan.\n\n\"Nay, but hear me out. Apostate, renegade--I know what you would say.\nYet what are these but words--mere words. You are alone in the world,\"\nand here for just an instant Quinton Edge dropped his eyes, although the\neven tones of his voice never wavered. \"You owe no debt of gratitude to\neither Stockader or Houseman. A crust from one, a bone from the other;\nthey would have done as much for a starving dog. You see that I have\nwatched you longer than you have been aware.\n\n\"And so I offer you the first and last of the things that all men crave.\nThe first is love, and she who stands there is fair, else why do I find\nyou in my garden? The last is power, and it is the world that I put\nunder your feet.\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly and seemed to catch at something mounting upward in\nhis throat. Then he continued:\n\n\"There is still the blood-debt between us, and I promise you it shall be\npaid and to the last drop. The only condition is that you must leave it\nto another to name the day of reckoning; that privilege belongs neither\nto you nor to me. Rest assured that when that day does come, I shall be\nready; ay, more than ready to pay my score.\"\n\nAgain silence fell between them for the space of a full minute. Quinton\nEdge turned to adjust the jabot of fine lace about his neck, and that he\nmight have both hands free he laid upon a wicker garden table the\nobject he had been carrying. Constans saw that it was a bunch of\nMay-bloom, a glorious cluster of pink-and-white blossom.\n\n\"I am waiting for my answer,\" said Quinton Edge.\n\nConstans tried to command his voice, but he could not speak, and Quinton\nEdge turned to Esmay:\n\n\"We have both of us omitted to remember where courtesy is first due.\nMadam, I should have informed myself of your pleasure in this matter.\"\n\n\"No, oh no!\" she stammered.\n\nThe Doomsman laughed. \"Yet I must ask you to reconsider; nay, even to\nuse what arts you possess to induce this short-sighted young gentleman\nto accept my generous proposition. For, mind you, there is a consequent\nupon his refusal--and yours.\"\n\nThe hidden fire in the girl's eyes seemed to leap forth, a bolt of fiery\nscorn that would have fused, upon the instant, metal less resisting.\n\n\"A consequent--of course. And it is----\"\n\n\"A lofty one. He mounts either to Dom Gillian's chair or to the yard arm\nof the _Black Swan_. A spy's death for a spy--it is but justice.\"\n\nEsmay turned to Constans.\n\n\"Surely it were shame enough for any woman to find herself made part of\nsuch a bargain. But my humiliation goes even deeper, for I must parade\nmy poor wares before you like any huckster, beseeching you to buy. My\nlord, it is for your life, and I am but a flower that it may please you\nto wear to-day and cast aside to-morrow. Buy of me, my lord, and at what\nprice you will--it is for your life. But be quick; he will not wait\nover-long.\" She plucked at his sleeve. \"Do you not understand? The men\nare coming; you can hear the rattle of the sheaf-blocks at the mast-head\nof the galley--Constans!\"\n\nBut Constans looked only at his enemy, Quinton Edge. \"I am ready,\" he\nsaid, coldly.\n\nEsmay passed through the long window and so into the drawing-room. To\nher overly excited senses the signal was already sounding in her ears,\nand a gradual faintness mounted to her brain, even as water rises about\nthe swimmer advancing through the shingle to the first shock of the\nsurge. Then, in deadly truth, she heard Quinton Edge blow his whistle,\nand the darkness closed in upon her.\n\nFor the second time the Doomsman raised the pipe to his lips. It slipped\nfrom his fingers and fell to the garden-table at his side.\n\nAs he bent to recover it the subtle, uprising scent of the May-bloom\nstruck him like a blow; a dark flush overspread his brow. He spoke,\nquickly, insistently:\n\n\"The canoe is still at the landing-stage. Go, while there is yet time.\"\n\nHe seized Constans by the shoulders, slewing him around and pushing him\ntowards the steps that led to the terrace.\n\n\"Go, and forget all that you have seen and heard in Doom the Forbidden.\nYou and your secrets are known; be content to leave my people with\ntheirs. And to me my memories.\"\n\nThe madness of protest, of resistance, was still upon Constans, and yet\nhe found himself yielding to this stronger will. Mechanically, he leaped\nto the terrace below, and from thence ran on to the landing-stage just\nas Kurt, the Knacker hobbled around the corner of the house at the head\nof a squad of sailors from the _Black Swan_. An arrow or two flew wild,\nbut Constans quickly had the boat in the current, which was running out\non a strong ebb-tide, and so was safe from further molestation. Half a\nmile down-stream he ventured to make a landing. The dozen or so of\nrifles and store of ammunition that he had left in hiding at this point\nwere too precious a treasure to be abandoned without an effort. Yet\nhardly had he transferred the last case of cartridges to his boat than\nhe became aware that the Doomsmen were close upon him, and this time he\ngot a bruised shoulder from a spent cross-bolt by way of a parting\nsalute. The canoe was heavily laden, but fortunately the wind had gone\ndown with the sun, and the water was unusually smooth. Constans bent to\nhis paddle, shaping his course to the southwest, the direction of his\nold home on the West Inch.\n\nHow cool and pure the air! How clean and sweet the stars that shone\nabove him! Little by little the fever and the fret of life departed from\nhim, and he was at peace. He wondered now at the madness that had\npossessed him, at the passion that had thrilled him at the touch of a\nwoman's hand. He had come so near to proving himself a traitor, a\nrecreant to all that was sacred in his life. And then a hound had bayed,\nand a girl had laughed, and the shining bubble had vanished into the\nair. Beguiled, betricked, betrayed--base repetition of the ancient\ninjury. What a fool he had been!\n\nThen, his heart being sore, he tried to comfort himself after a man's\nfashion. It had been all a mistake from the beginning; he had never\nreally loved this amber-haired enchantress; it had been the infatuation\nof passion only, and he had escaped; let him be thankful. Or even\ngranting that love lay behind, was not all of life before him? One day\nhad passed, but another was soon to dawn, a day for new purposes, fresh\nconsecrations. In his present exalted mood, even his long-cherished\nvengeance upon Quinton Edge seemed a small, a contemptible thing. What\nwere either his love or his hate in the world-drama that was being\nenacted under his eyes. Again, as in days long past, he thrilled to the\nthought of a new and larger life, the redemption of humanity, the\nestablishment of peace and righteousness, the shadow of Doom forever\nlifted from the land. There were the rifles and ammunition lying at his\nfeet, potencies irresistible; surely this was the fulness of time. What\na splendid vision! How glorious his own part in it might be! And so,\nthrough the night, he dreamed and drifted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a week later that Esmay looked into Nanna's face bending over\nher, and knew that remembrance had come again. She had listened\nsilently, as Nanna, between fits of weeping and stormy self-reproach,\nmade her confession, of her eavesdropping at the door, of her jealous\nterror lest she should be separated from her darling, of her new-born\nhatred of this Constans, who dared to stand between herself and Esmay,\nof the final madness that had tempted her to the unchaining of the dogs.\nYet, when it was finished, Esmay had put forth her hand and drawn the\nrough, tear-stained face close to her own. \"You could not know, dear,\"\nshe said, quietly, \"and it was all for love of me.\"\n\nIt was not until the end of another week, a sunny day, when she had\nventured out for the first time, that Esmay found courage to ask the\nquestion that had risen so often to her lips.\n\n\"When did the _Black Swan_ sail away?\"\n\n\"That same morning,\" answered Nanna. \"Although it's a living wonder that\nI should have cared to take notice of anything beyond your face that lay\nso still and white upon my arm.\"\n\n\"And our master--he carried out his purpose?\"\n\nNanna looked puzzled. Then she answered, carelessly, \"Does he ever fail\nin that?\"\n\nThere was a pause, and Esmay turned again to look upon the shining\nriver.\n\n\"He might have saved his life--and lost it,\" she whispered to herself.\n\"I am glad for him. And for myself--for now he knows.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\nOXENFORD'S DAUGHTER\n\n\nConstans had now spent nearly a fortnight in the valley of the\nSwiftwater, and, while he had been hospitably received and entertained,\nhe made but small progress in his mission; it seemed as though this\nsecond propaganda were also doomed to failure. There was neither\nunanimity nor enthusiasm among these rustic seigneurs; they were content\nto leave well enough alone, and the rest of the world could shift for\nitself, as in the past.\n\n\"Doom will not trouble us, and why should we concern ourselves about the\nflaying of a few fat burghers. Mayhap a little blood-letting now and\nthen is efficacious in warding off the falling sickness, and in the end\nthe churls get it back out of us. Your own worthy uncle, Messer Hugolin,\nhas squeezed me more than once. As for your ideal republic, stuff of\ndreams, lad! Take an old man's word for it.\"\n\nPiers Major, of the River Barony, spoke decidedly, yet withal not\nunkindly, for he had been blood-brother to Constans's father, and he\nliked the boy for his own sake. Constans had gone; to him last of all;\nunconsciously he had been counting upon his support, whatever else\nfailed, and to be repulsed in this quarter was bitter indeed. The old\nman looked into the clouded face before him and continued, earnestly:\n\n\"A dream, I tell you. Let the morning wind scatter these vapors; you are\nyoung, and the world is before you. Harkee, lad, for I speak for your\nown good--nothing less. There is the Greenwood Keep, and it still\nremains 'no man's land.' True, the house was badly gutted by the fire,\nbut there is plenty of good timber in the forest, and every man among us\nwill be glad to lend a hand to the reconstruction of your fortunes.\nFinally, there is your tall cousin Alexa, 'Red' Oxenford's daughter.\nMethinks she looks upon you not unkindly, and she bade me be sure to\nbring you to her coming of age to-day. The whole country-side will be\npresent, and you may bag all your birds with one fairly shot bolt. What\nsay you?\"\n\nConstans was silent; for the moment he was conscious of being allured by\nan offer so well and kindly meant. To restore the old home, to find\nhimself again among his kinsmen and friends, contentedly sharing their\nsimple, wholesome life, to plough his own acres and see the smoke\ncurling upward from his own hearthstone--were not these things, after\nall, the actualities of life?--was he to be always turning his back upon\nthem to grasp at clouds mirrored in running water, shadows that ever\neluded his grasp? His cousin Alexa--undoubtedly she was a pretty girl,\nwith her rose-leaf complexion and bright, gray eyes. He had met her on\ntwo or three occasions, and he was not wholly unaware of her shy\npleasure in his companionship, impersonal as it had hitherto been. He\nmight, indeed, stop and consider.\n\nYet the temptation passed as quickly as it had presented itself. There\nwas that other work in the world to-day, and who was to take it up if he\ndrew back? Others might be of gifts more competent, but at least he had\ncome to know himself through hard experience, and knowledge so bought\nwas not to be lightly flung away.\n\n\"It cannot be,\" he said, shortly. \"Believe me, that I am not ungrateful,\nbut my own way is plain, and I must take it.\" He hesitated. \"You are of\nmy father's covenant,\" he continued, slowly.\n\n\"The blood-bond is between us,\" assented the other, heartily enough, and\nyet knitting his brows as he spoke.\n\n\"Then if I choose to exact the full obligation of brotherhood, even to\nsword-service----\"\n\n\"It must be paid, and it shall be,\" said Piers Major, quickly, and still\nhis countenance was troubled.\n\nConstans deliberated. \"I shall not require so severe a test of your good\nfaith,\" he said at length. \"Yet I may ask you to hold the question open,\nto give me a chance to prove that my plans are feasible and that action\nis necessary for the future peace of all.\"\n\n\"That I can agree to with all my heart. But, mind you, the argument must\nhave a keen edge and weight behind it. We Stockaders are a stubborn\ngeneration.\"\n\n\"So, too, are facts,\" returned Constans, \"and possibly you may have to\ndeal with them rather than with my theories. It is a long time since the\nmen in gray have needed to go afield in this direction, but the country\naround Croye is a dry sponge, and I happen to know that there were more\nempty saddles than full hands in the expedition that has just returned\nto Doom from the Southland. I stood on Harbor Hill last night, and there\nwere lights in the Narrows.\"\n\n\"It may be so,\" said the old man, sombrely, \"but the graybacks should\nnot have forgotten already the lesson we taught them at the Golden Cove\nthe year of the red comet. But, Constans, lad, we should be on our way\nif we would not have the pretty Alexa furrowing her forehead over our\nempty seats at her birthday board. Hola! Willem; the horses!\"\n\nThe way to Deepdene, Red Oxenford's stronghold, led through the forest,\nand the green drive was a pleasant place on this brightest of May\nmornings, there being the languor of coming summer in the fitful breeze.\nThe two horsemen rode slowly, yet their speech was brief, each being\nabsorbed in his own thoughts and questionings.\n\nA couple of miles farther on and they came to the crossing of the Ochre\nbrook. As they rode their horses into the ford, a wild dog that had been\nlapping at the brink started up with a snarl under the very feet of\nPiers Major's steed. Now such is the cowardly nature of the wood-dog\nthat he will run from the presence of man if chance of escape be\noffered; yet if cornered he will show all the ferocity of a wounded\nboar. In this instance the dog could not retreat to advantage, and so he\nsprang at the horse, gripping the tender muzzle in his strong, sharp\nteeth, and hanging there like a rat on a terrier. The horse, maddened\nwith pain, plunged and reared. His master drew his hunting-knife and\nmade an ineffectual pass at the ugly beast.\n\n\"Hold!\" shouted Constans. \"Back in your saddle and leave him to me.\"\n\nThe pistol in his hand spoke once, and the dog, shot through the lungs,\nfell back into the water. A bubble of crimson foam floated for a moment\non the current, and he was gone.\n\n\"That was well done,\" said Piers Major, gravely. He had finally\nsucceeded in quieting his horse, and they were again on their way.\n\n\"It is one of the ancient secrets,\" said Constans, and explained as best\nhe could the mechanism of the revolver and the composition of its\nexplosive cartridge. The old man examined the strange weapon with\nrespectful attention; he had had proof of its powers.\n\n\"Have you ever killed a man?\" he demanded.\n\nConstans was obliged to answer in the negative, and the other seemed a\nlittle doubtful. \"Look,\" said Constans, and, drawing rein, he took aim\nat a beech-tree a few yards distant. The bullet ploughed into the wood,\nleaving a small, round hole in the smooth bark. \"See how deeply it has\npenetrated,\" he continued. \"Think you that a man could endure to have\nthis lump of lead drilled through heart or brain? Ay, and against it no\ncuirass of quilted cloth will avail, however well it may turn an\narrow-point.\"\n\nPiers Major smiled grimly. \"If I questioned your assertion,\" he said,\n\"you would doubtless invite me to stand up and put the matter to the\nproof. I am content.\"\n\n\"In a secret place, some three miles from here,\" went on Constans, \"I\nhave in store a dozen similar weapons, together with as many of a larger\npattern--rifles as they were anciently called. Also abundance of\nammunition. Put them in the hands of brave men, and would not the odds\nbe in our favor, even if the Doomsmen out-numbered us?\"\n\n\"Yet may not our enemies provide themselves with the same means of\noffence?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Constans, decidedly. \"It took me a month's hard work to get\nwhat I have into serviceable condition. Besides, the weapons are useless\nwithout the cartridges of gunpowder and lead. Of these only a small\nquantity remained fit for use, and I have secured it all.\"\n\nThe old man's eye brightened. \"Good,\" he said, laconically, and relapsed\ninto his abstracted mood.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a joyous and inspiring spectacle that presented itself when they\nfinally drew rein before the doors of Deepdene. On the smooth lawn\nwithin the stockade full a hundred horses were picketed, while their\nmasters strolled about in the bright sunshine. For the most part they\nwere well-built young fellows, clad in all the bravery of a rustic\nholiday. Constans and his companion paused only long enough to receive\nthe salutation of those nearest, and then passed into the house to pay\ntheir respects to the host. They had been among the last of the guests\nto arrive, and now the signal was given for the festivities of the day\nto begin in earnest.\n\nThe sports were of the sort characteristic of such a\ngathering--wrestling and foot-races, target-shooting and bouts at\ncudgel-play and night-stick. Towards the middle of the afternoon, when\nthe athletic prowess of the young men had been fully exploited, came the\ngreat spectacle, the bull-fight, and of this it will be necessary to\nspeak somewhat particularly.\n\nThe pen, or corral, as it might more properly be called, was a circular\nenclosure of fifty yards in diameter, the ring being formed of stout\npost-and-rail fence. The victim, a wild bull, was first turned\nblindfolded into the enclosure and baited by the dogs until excited to\nfrenzy. Then half a dozen of the bolder youths would vault into the ring\narmed only with their throwing-knives, and the real sport would begin.\nThe master of the ring, having provided himself with a long pole to\nwhich a sharp knife-blade had been bound, would watch his opportunity to\ncut the thong that secured the blind-cloth about the animal's eyes. Woe\nnow to him who was dull of eye or laggard of foot!\n\nThe object of the game was, of course, to strike the fatal blow; but,\nskilled as were the young Stockaders in the art of throwing the knife,\nit often happened that a bull would be bleeding from a hundred wounds\nand still keep his feet. Commonly, too, he would manage to score upon\none or more of his adversaries before succumbing, for while it was\npermissible for a contestant to leave the ring, he could only do so\nafter he had thrown his knife and as a last resort against the bull's\ncharge. When the animal's attention had been diverted by an attack from\nanother quarter, the disarmed contestant would vault again into the ring\nand recover his weapon. Here, indeed, was a game that might well stir\nthe coldest blood, since life itself was the stake for which it was\nplayed.\n\nThe company had gathered about the bull-pen, pressing closely against\nthe barrier, that they might lose no part of the show. It should be a\nspectacle worth more than ordinary attention, for the bull was an animal\nof exceptional size and of a temper to correspond; the knowing ones\nopined that the contest would be a protracted one, and expatiated\ngravely upon the animal's strong points to their less-informed brethren.\nWagers were being booked; there were endless arguments, asseverations,\nquestionings; the smoke from innumerable pipes hung like a blue haze\nabove the heads of the throng, and here and there a fretful child lifted\nup complaining voice. Already the sun hung in the zenith, and it was\ntime to begin if the sport were not to encroach upon the dinner hour.\n\nAt the north end of the enclosure a wooden gallery had been reared for\nthe accommodation of the principal guests, and Constans, to his\nsurprise, found himself included in this privileged number. Possibly the\npretty Alexa could have explained the mystery of his invitation; certain\nit is that she favored him with a radiant smile when he made his\nappearance on the platform, a mark of encouragement which might have\njustified him in appropriating the vacant seat at the maiden's right\nhand. But Constans, being of a retiring disposition, and even a little\nindifferent to his opportunities, let the chance slip, and another who\nhad been waiting anxiously upon the lady's nod was finally made happy.\n\nA murmur of applause had greeted the entrance of the bull, and truly he\nwas a magnificent creature, deep chested and of the true checkered\nmarking in black and white. The customary baiting had been omitted, for\nthe ugliness of his temper needed no external stimulus, and the young\nmen were already in the ring when he appeared.\n\nThe preliminary encounter was a mortifying experience for the sextet of\noverconfident youth. One by one they launched their weapons and either\nmissed outright or else scored but lightly; successively they had been\nforced to retreat beyond the barrier by the animal, whose agility in\ngetting around the ring was marvellous. Unfortunately for the\ncontestants, all the knives had fallen on virtually the same spot, and\nthe bull proceeded to mount guard over them as though aware that their\npossession was the guarantee of his own immunity. The game was now\nindefinitely blocked, since it was certain death for a player to attempt\nthe recovery of his throwing-knife, and the rules did not permit the\nsubstitution of fresh weapons. The crowd laughed ironically as the\nsituation dawned upon them, and the discomfited players were compelled\nto submit to many a gibe. The bull remained master of the field, and the\nspectators, grown tired of waiting, began to express their disapproval\naudibly.\n\nPiers Major pushed his way to Constans's side. \"A chance for you and\nyour fire-stick,\" he whispered. \"I have been talking to Red Oxenford and\nthe others about it, and they are curious to see for themselves. Think\nyou that you can drop that fellow where he stands?\" and he nodded at the\nbull, who still kept watch over his spoils.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Constans, confidently. Here was the supreme moment at\nlast arrived; the very thought of failure was impossible; he must and\nwould succeed in the task imposed. Obeying the beckoning finger of his\nhost, Constans advanced to the edge of the platform overhanging the\nenclosure.\n\nAn excited murmur rose from the crowd below, and even the dignitaries\nupon the gallery jostled one another to obtain a favorable\nvantage-point. Alexa stood immediately behind Constans, her eyes bright\nwith excitement, and her slim hand hidden in her father's huge fist.\nWithout attempting to take aim, Constans raised the revolver and fired.\n\nThe bullet struck the ground in front of the bull and threw up a\nspiteful puff of dust, at which the animal pawed disdainfully. But if\nthe shot had missed its mark, the report of the explosion did full\nexecution among the spectators. The women shrieked, and the men nearest\nthe enclosure pushed back hastily among the crowd. For a moment a panic\nwas imminent, but Constans quieted it with a word.\n\n\"It is only the bark of the dog,\" he said, smilingly, and his hearers\nsomewhat shamefacedly resumed their places, but this time leaving a dear\nspace in which he might stand and handle his weapon.\n\nConstans took steady aim, and, to his surprise, missed again, the bullet\nflying wide. The failure nettled him. He made his preparations for the\nthird essay with care, raising and lowering the pistol several times,\nuntil he was sure that he could not miss the mark. A third failure--the\nbullet clipping a splinter from a fence-post on the opposite side of the\nring. A mist rose before Constans's eyes; what did it mean? Could he\nhave deceived himself in thinking that he had mastered this secret of\nthe ancients? Was it to fail him now, when all depended upon success?\nHis hand trembled so that he could hardly draw the trigger. The hammer\nfell for the fourth time, but no explosion followed, the cartridge\nhaving missed fire. He had now but one shot left, and the whispers of\ndisapproval and disappointment among the crowd were plainly audible.\n\nWithout stopping to reflect, Constans leaped over the rail of the\ngallery to the arena below. As he jumped, the girl, Alexa, started, and\na cry escaped her parted lips; it was a sigh rather than an exclamation,\nthe voice of a crushed flower suspiring its last vital breath. And\nConstans did not hear.\n\nFor perhaps half a dozen seconds man and beast stood motionless, waiting\nupon each other. The bull tossed his head savagely, his tail twitching,\nand a cloud of dust and gravel rising under his impatient hoof.\nConstans, with finger on trigger, moved a step to the right so as to\nface him fairly. Suddenly the great horns came down with a vindictive\nsweep, the shoulders heaved in the first impulse of the coming charge.\nLike the snap of a whip the report rang out clean and sharp, and the\nbullet went home at just the one vulnerable point in the thick\nskull--that at which the butcher aims his pole-axe. The bull pulled up\nshort, the glaring eyes softened as though in wonder at this strange\nperformance that had been enacted before him; then, as the people still\nheld their breath, the brute sank quietly to his knees and rolled over\ndead.\n\nA woman started in to laugh hysterically, but her voice was drowned in a\nmighty shout; like a wave the crowd passed over the barrier, and\nConstans grasped helplessly at half a hundred out-stretched hands. A\nbabel of voices arose; the arena, filled to overflowing with excited men\nand women, was comparable only to some gigantic ant-hill.\n\nFifty yards outside of the main palisade stood an oak-tree. Under the\nStockader law no standing timber should have been permitted at a less\ndistance than one hundred paces, but the oak was such a fine specimen\nthat Red Oxenford had allowed it to remain--a fatal error.\n\nA bowstring twanged; the arrow sped to its mark--the fair young breast\nof Oxenford's daughter--and in her father's arms the maiden gasped and\ndied; all this in the space of time in which a cloud of the bigness of a\nman's hand might pass across the sun. Down from the lower branches of\nthat accursed oak dropped the lithe figure of a man garbed all in gray.\n\"Stop him!\" called a weak, uncertain voice, but no one moved. The man in\ngray waved his hand derisively and disappeared into the bush. An\ninarticulate sound arose from the closely packed throng in the\nenclosure, the exhalation of a universal sigh.\n\nRed Oxenford had made neither sound nor sign. He stood motionless, his\ndaughter's head cradled in the hollow of his arm; he stared stupidly at\nthe girl's face, so pitifully white and small it seemed, with its\nvirginal coronal of flaxen hair--then he fell in a heap, like to a\ncollapsing wall.\n\nPiers Major gently withdrew the bolt from the wound and held it up to\nview. Its message was plain to all, for none save the Doomsmen feathered\ntheir arrows with the plume of the gray goose. Only now the quills were\nstained to a darker hue.\n\n\"It is her blood,\" he said, and the shaft of polished hickory snapped\nlike a straw between his fingers. \"Her blood! and of Doom shall we\nrequire it.\" And at that all the people shouted and then stood with\nuncovered heads, while the young men bore away the body of Oxenford's\ndaughter on their locked shields and gave it to her mother.\n\n[Illustration: \"OF DOOM SHALL WE REQUIRE IT\"]\n\nThat night Constans rode out from Deepdene at the head of twenty picked\nmen, leading them to the secret place where he had stored the guns and\nammunition which he had brought from Doom. Two days of practice with the\nunfamiliar weapons, and on the morning of the third the little squad,\nreinforced by a company of two hundred men-at-arms, set out upon the\nnorthern road.\n\nTowards noon they passed through Croye. It had been their intention to\nstop here for the mid-day meal, but none cared to propose a halt after\nentering this strange city of silence. Ordinarily the central square\nwould have been filled with a voluble, chaffering crowd, it being a\nmarket-day; now there was not a living thing to be seen, not even a hog\nwallowing in the kennel nor a buzzard about the butcher-stalls. Yet\nthere were no traces of fire and sword, the houses had suffered no\nviolence, and stood there barred and shuttered as though it were still\nthe middle watch of the night.\n\n\"What think you?\" said Piers Major to Constans. \"Is it the plague?\"\n\n\"No, or there would be fires burning in the streets and yellow crosses\nchalked upon the door-lintels. Those who keep so close behind their\nbolts and bars are living people, hale and strong as ourselves. But,\nassuredly, some great fear has been put upon them. Perhaps we shall know\nmore as we go on.\"\n\nThe answer to the riddle was given as they turned the corner by Messer\nHugolin's house. The strong-room on the ground-floor stood empty and\ndespoiled of its treasures, yet the gold and silver had not been carried\naway, but lay scattered about in the filth of the street, as though\nutterly contemned by the marauders.\n\nAnd there, hanging from a cross-bar of the broken window, was the body\nof Messer Hugolin, Councillor Primus of Croye, dressed in his scarlet\nrobes of office, and with a great gold chain about his neck. His head\nwas bowed upon his breast, so that the face was not visible, and for\nthis indulgence Constans gave inward thanks.\n\n\"Ride on,\" commanded Piers Major, shortly, and the cavalcade clattered\nforward. It is not worth while to linger where once Dom Gillian's\ntax-gatherers have passed.\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\nYET THREE DAYS\n\n\nEsmay sat in the gardens at Arcadia House. It was the loveliest of\nspring days, and there were blossoms everywhere--the vivid pink of the\nJudas-tree, the white glory of the dogwood, and each Forsythia bush a\ncascade of golden foam. It was all so beautiful, and in that same\nmeasure it hurt so keenly. The girl flung herself face downward in the\ngrass, seeking to shut out from sight and hearing the world that mocked\nher.\n\nThat same night Esmay went to Nanna and announced her intention of\npaying another visit to the \"House of Power.\"\n\n\"Our lord cannot be wholly unmindful of his children,\" she said, \"and\nlight may come to us from the Shining One. Besides,\" and here her color\ndeepened, \"it is where he lived, he who was my friend. If I could but\nfind some little thing that had been his--a glove or one of his books!\nNow do be a good Nanna and help me in this.\"\n\nBut the practical Nanna shook her head. \"That mad, old graybeard, who\nconsiders it a contamination to even look upon a woman, is it likely\nthat he will invite you into his sanctuary and set himself to answer\nyour foolish questions? It is supposed to be sufficient grace for a\nwoman if the Shining One deigns to accept the gifts that she lays upon\nhis altar.\"\n\n\"Then we will go dressed as men. There is everything we can want in the\npresses up-stairs, and I can steal the key of the wicket gate from out\nof Kurt's very pocket. Now, Nanna, dear----\"\n\nAnd of course Nanna yielded, for she saw that her darling's heart was\nset upon this thing. Quinton Edge was still absent in the _Black Swan_,\nand it would be an easy matter to hoodwink old Kurt; he was always\nfuddled with ale nowadays. To-morrow would be Friday, the day of the\nweekly sacrifice; they could make the trial then.\n\nIt was hard upon noon of the following day when the two women drew near\nto the temple of the Shining One. Nanna, clad in doublet and\nsmall-clothes, swung jauntily along, one hand on dagger-hilt and\ncareless challenge in her snapping, black eyes, the picture of a\nswaggering younker. But Esmay, at the last moment, could not bring\nherself to don habiliments exclusively masculine. So she compromised by\nwearing a round jacket with a rolling collar and tucking away her hair\nunder a boy's cap. A long rain-coat, for which the showery morning was\nan excuse, completed her outward attire and concealed her petticoats\nfrom casual view. Yet in any case her blushes had been spared, for they\nmet nobody on their way, and the open space in front of the temple was\ndeserted. Not a single worshiper had come to pay honor and tithe to the\nShining One; the altar was empty of offerings, and the priest himself\nwas absent from his accustomed post. Yet upon the ear fell the rumble\nand clang of moving machinery, and the eye, piercing through the\nhalf-lights of the archway, caught indefinite glimpses of the pulsing\nmysteries of wheel and piston-rod that lay within the shadows.\n\n\"He must be within,\" said Nanna, leading the way. \"Don't stumble around\nlike that. Here, take my hand.\"\n\nProstrate in front of the switch-board they found the priest, a mere\nanatomy of a man, with his checks shrunken to the jaw, and his wasted\nlimbs no larger than those of a child. Yet he was alive and conscious,\nthe deep-set eyes glowing with suspicious fire as they turned upon his\nunexpected guests.\n\n\"Starving,\" said Nanna, briefly, and proceeded to force a few drops of\nwine from a pocket-flask between his lips, while Esmay ran for the\nbasket of food which had been brought along as an offertory in their\nassumed character of worshippers. The stimulant acted powerfully, and\nwithin the hour Prosper was so far restored as to be able to partake of\nsome solid food. Then he insisted upon getting to his feet, a gaunt and\nterrible figure in his rusty cassock.\n\n\"I have my work to do,\" he reiterated, stubbornly. \"I must be preparing\nthe harvest field for my lord's sickle, and already the time is ripe for\nhis appearing. Behold and believe!\"\n\nWith a firm step he approached the switch-board and turned one of the\ncontrolling levers. A flash of light, succeeded by a stream of crackling\nsparks, leaped from the free end of a broken wire at the other end of\nthe building, and a pile of straw lying near it burst into flame. An\nexpert in electrical engineering would have understood that the broken\nwire must be in proximity to a mass of metal, and that the powerful\ncurrent was being visibly hurled across the gap. Esmay uttered a cry,\nand even Nanna shrank back. Prosper smiled.\n\n\"Who can abide the displeasure of the Shining One? Who can stand before\nthe flame of his wrath? A mighty and a terrible god, yet he would have\nleft his servant to starve before his altar--you have seen that for\nyourselves. It is ten days now since even a woman has condescended to\nkneel at his shrine and make her offerings of meat and drink. I, his\nhigh-priest, may eat no common food, but how should the lord of heaven\nand earth keep such trivial circumstances in mind? He had forgotten, and\nso I must have died but for your opportune coming and pious gifts.\n\n\"One might argue that our lord employed you as the instruments of my\ndeliverance,\" continued the priest, musingly. \"I might think it, but\nthat I know the Shining One of old. It is his pleasure to punish, not to\nhelp; to slay and not to make alive. Never has he given aught of grace\nto me who have served him faithfully for these threescore years. And\nto-day, if I should sit with him upon the death-chair, he would consume\nme as utterly as though I were the foulest-mouthed blasphemer in all\nDoom. What think ye, in all honesty, of the Shining One? Is he a god to\nbe propitiated by sacrifice and offering, to be worshipped and\nadored--supreme, almighty, everlasting? Or are we but blind fools,\ntrembling before a blind force that knows and sees and is nothing,\nexcept as we, its lords and masters, may compel it to work our will?\"\n\nThe muttering of thunder broke in upon the priest's last words. A\nstorm-cloud was driving in from the west, low-hanging and menacing. The\npriest's face changed.\n\n\"He comes! he comes!\" he continued, with fanatic intensity. \"This is our\nlord, in very truth, who now stands before us, calling upon his people\nto turn to him ere it be too late. Yet three days, and Doom, Doom the\nMighty, is fallen, is fallen! He has said it--yet three days.\"\n\nThe two women stayed neither to see nor to listen further. Hand-in-hand\nthey gained the street and ran in the direction of the Citadel Square,\nheedless of the rain that was now beginning to fall. Several blocks away\nthey paused, exhausted, compelled to seek shelter in a doorway from the\nfury of the storm. Some one was already there--a man. He turned as they\nentered, and Esmay saw that it was Ulick.\n\nFor several moments they stood side by side without exchanging a word,\nand, indeed, no speech would have been audible amid the almost\ncontinuous crashing of the thunder-peals. Then, as the first violence of\nthe storm expended itself, Esmay heard her name uttered, and realized\nthat Ulick was holding her hand in both his own.\n\n\"Don't!\" she pleaded, and drew her hand away.\n\nUlick's face hardened. \"I might have known it,\" he said, bitterly. \"Yet\nhe who has been false to friendship may betray love as well.\"\n\n\"He is dead,\" she said, and Ulick started.\n\n\"Constans--dead!\" he stammered.\n\n\"Hanged at the yard-arm of the _Black Swan_. But Quinton Edge still\nlives.\"\n\n\"You loved him?\" persisted Ulick, the sense of his injury still strong\nwithin him.\n\nThe girl drew herself up proudly. \"Yes, I loved him--that is for you and\nall the world to know. But be comforted; he cared not a whit for me.\nThat, in the end, was made plain enough.\"\n\nUlick's fare was pale. \"But he still stands between us?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, simply.\n\nThe rain had almost ceased; Esmay made a movement to depart.\n\n\"There is nothing--no way in which I can serve you?\" he asked.\n\nShe shook her head. \"Nothing. I am going back to Arcadia House, but I\nshall have Nanna with me. There is nothing to fear.\"\n\nHe regarded her fixedly. \"What can you do against Quinton Edge? He is\nthe master--our master.\"\n\n\"I do not know; I have not thought. But I can watch and I can wait.\"\n\n\"Waiting! If that were all----\"\n\n\"No, no! it could not be.\" She colored hotly, and he stopped, abashed.\n\n\"You must go now,\" she went on, gently. \"Ulick, dear Ulick, I am sending\nyou away, but, indeed, it is better so. And I shall remember--always.\"\n\nHe would have spoken again, but something in her face restrained him. He\nbent and kissed her reverently, as a brother might, and went out. And\nshe, watching him go, found her vision suddenly blurred by a mist of\ntears. For there is something in every woman's heart that pleads a true\nman's cause, for all that she may not accept the gift he proffers.\n\nNanna had disappeared into the house some few minutes before; now she\nreturned from her journey of discovery, wearing an expression of gravity\nquite new to her. \"Come,\" she said, \"I want to show you something.\"\n\nShe drew Esmay after her down the draughty passage that led to the\noffices of the long-since-deserted dwelling-house. There was a large\napartment at the end of the passage--the kitchen, to judge from the\ncharacter of the fittings. The room had been formerly lighted by\nelectricity, and Nanna pointed out a lampwire whose free end was\ndangling in close proximity to a lead water-pipe. Underneath was a small\nheap of oil-soaked rags.\n\n\"You remember what we saw at the House of Power?\" said Nanna,\nsignificantly.\n\nEsmay examined the wire carefully. At the broken end the insulating\nfabric had been stripped off and the copper scraped clean and bright\nwith a knife-blade.\n\n\"I found this on a nail in the passage,\" went on Nanna, and held out a\nbit of cloth that had been torn from a garment. It was of that peculiar\nweave worn only by the priests of the Shining One.\n\nEsmay looked at it with troubled eyes. \"What does it mean?\" she asked,\nbut Nanna only shook her head.\n\n\"Of course, I remember what happened at the temple,\" said Esmay,\nhesitatingly. \"We saw him turn a handle, and the wire a hundred feet\naway spouted fire. If a hundred feet, why not half a mile?\"\n\n\"It is a trap,\" asserted Nanna.\n\n\"But for what purpose?\"\n\nNanna was not to be moved. \"A trap,\" she persisted. \"I do not\nunderstand, but I can feel what it is just as do the wolverine and the\nfox. Come away.\"\n\nThey walked down the street.\n\n\"What could Prosper hope to catch in such a snare--for whom could he have\nset it?\" asked Esmay, putting into audible language the question over which\nboth were puzzling. \"Unless,\" she went on, thoughtfully--\"unless this is\nonly one of many.\"\n\nNanna nodded. \"Dozens, hundreds of them, and scattered all over the\ncity. It is the harvest-field of which he spoke.\"\n\nAs they passed a street corner that commanded a view of the Palace Road,\nNanna caught Esmay by the arm and bade her look. Towering head and\nshoulders above the throng of idle men and gossiping women strode\nProsper, the priest, and as he went he proclaimed the woe that must\nshortly come upon the city, a message to which none gave heed. But for\nall their mocking he would not forbear, and long after he had passed out\nof sight Esmay could distinguish the accents of his powerful voice\nrising above the din that strove to drown it:\n\n\"Yet three days, and Doom the Mighty--is fallen, is fallen!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\nTHE RED LIGHT IN THE NORTH\n\n\nIt had been Constans's original plan to cross the river some miles above\nCroye, and so avoid attracting the attention of the Doomsmen should any\nof their parties be afield. The expedition would then move cautiously\ndown the east bank in the hope of surprising the guard at the High\nBridge, and so gain entrance to the city. But Piers Major, at the\ncouncil of war that first evening, brought about a reconsideration.\n\n\"Against the citadel,\" he said, shrewdly, \"we should rather choose to\ndirect an unexpected blow. The bridge may be carried by a rush, but not\nso the stone walls that guard the heart of Doom. In that assault a man's\nlife must be paid for each rung gained on the scaling-ladders. We have\nno batteries with which to hammer at the gate-hinges, and as for a\nsiege--well, it is weary work starving out rats whose fortress is a\ngranary in itself. Let us move, indeed, but cautiously, prudently.\n\n\"Splendor of God!\" shouted Red Oxenford, and he sprang to his feet. A\nman of full habit and ruddy face he had been in his day, but since the\ndeath of the young Alexa he seemed to have aged and whitened visibly.\nHis eyes were bright, as though with fever, and he went on with growing\nvehemence:\n\n\"Are we, then, chapmen of Croye, calling to collect an overdue\naccount--prepared to sit down in humble expectancy at Dom Gillian's door\nuntil it may pleasure him to open it? Caution, expediency! he is no\nfriend to Oxenford who would utter such words as these.\"\n\nBut Piers Major was not to be daunted. He put his hands on the shoulders\nof the angry man and forced him backward into his seat.\n\n\"Nay, but you have not heard me out,\" continued Piers Major. \"It is a\ndebt, indeed, for which we are pressing payment--only one of blood\nrather than of gold. All the more reason, then, that the settlement\nshould be in full and the cost of collection kept small. Now, Dom\nGillian has shut his door in our faces, and it is a strong one. If we so\nelect we may butt out our brains against it, and be none the better off.\n\n\"A fortress and a woman, there is always more than one way in which they\nmay be taken. Let us find that back door, and some of us may quietly\nenter there while the others are parleying at the front. Once within the\nwalls, the fire-sticks should quickly clear the house for us.\"\n\n\"Ay, man,\" broke in Oxenford, impatiently, \"but all this is words, not\ndeeds. What can we do so that Dom Gillian hangs from his own door-post\nbefore a second rising of the sun?\"\n\n\"I propose, then,\" answered Piers Major, \"that the score of men who are\narmed with the new weapons shall take boat down the river and make a\nlanding to the south of the Citadel Square, remaining in hiding until\nthe rising of the moon to-morrow night. The main body will force the\nHigh Bridge at the coming dawn, and should be able to drive the Doomsmen\nto cover within the next twelve hours. Then the frontal attack in force\nand the gun-fire from behind. If they follow each other at the proper\ninterval, our victory is assured.\"\n\n\"It is your idea that I should go with the flanking-party?\" asked\nConstans.\n\n\"Naturally, since you alone know the city. We can reach the Citadel\nSquare from our side without difficulty, for it is a simple matter of\nhewing our way thither. But with your party it must be the progress of\nthe snake through the grass.\"\n\nWithout further parley the plan proposed was adopted. Piers Major would\ncommand the main body in person--about one hundred and fifty men in all.\nConstans selected Piers Minor, son of Piers Major, as his lieutenant,\nand, somewhat to his surprise, Oxenford elected to join the smaller\ncommand. \"It is the better chance,\" he explained, grimly, \"for my\ngetting a face-to-face look at the old, gray wolf.\"\n\nFortunately, the question of transportation for the river party was\nquickly settled. One of Messer Hugolin's flat-boats, coming down from\nthe upper river with a cargo of hides, had anchored for the night a\nhalf-mile up-stream; it was an easy matter to impress crew and vessel\ninto service. The hides were tossed ashore, and by midnight the\nexpedition was ready to start. The scow was fitted with two masts,\ncarrying square sails, and, as the wind was directly astern and blowing\nstrongly, the clumsy craft swept away from her moorings with imposing\nanimation, leaving a full half-acre of bubbles to mark her wake.\n\n\"For the third time,\" said Constans to himself as he sat in the bow with\nhis back to the squat foremast and watched the river flowing darkly by.\nTwice now had he measured strength with Doom the Forbidden, and twice\nhad the battle been drawn, the issue left undecided. This time one or\nthe other must fall.\n\nThe long night wore away, and presently the sky was streaked with the\npink and saffron of the coming dawn. A landing was made without\ndifficulty, and Constans was soon leading his little band through the\nrubbish-encumbered thoroughfares to the appointed station. The men\nmarched along in sulky silence, for their night's rest on the open\nboat-deck had been an uncomfortable one, and they wanted their\nbreakfast.\n\nConstans had determined to make use of his old quarters in the\n\"Flat-iron\" building, on the south side of the Citadel Square, and his\nrelief was great when the last man passed within the shelter of its\nwalls. Once mustered in one of the large rooms on the fourth floor, the\nhaversacks and canteens were quickly requisitioned, and the men feasted\ngloriously upon oat-cake and cold coffee, brewed from parched grain,\nwith a pipe for dessert. After this agreeable interlude, there was\nnothing to do but to wait, and the majority curled themselves up in some\nconvenient corner and resumed their interrupted slumbers. Constans\nposted himself at a window overlooking the square, with the intention of\nkeeping close watch on all that passed below. But, in spite of all his\nefforts, Nature insisted upon her rights, and he, too, slept.\n\nOver at Arcadia House, Nanna, being wakeful with the torture of an\naching tooth, happened to glance through the north windows of the room\noccupied by the sisters and saw a dull-red glow on the horizon--a\nconflagration. She aroused Esmay, and the two girls watched it,\nwondering.\n\n\"It is in the direction of the High Bridge,\" said Esmay, and Nanna\nnodded acquiescence. \"And it is the morning of the third day,\" continued\nEsmay, and Nanna nodded again.\n\nThe fire was a long way off, low down on the northern sky-line. But\nevery now and then a crimson streamer would leap upward almost to the\nzenith, showing how great and vehement the conflagration must be. As the\ntwo girls stood watching it, they heard a window flung up sharply, and\nQuinton Edge's voice calling to Old Kurt and bidding him saddle a horse\nwith all speed.\n\nNanna's eyes glowed. \"It is something big,\" she said, excitedly, and\nbegan scrambling into her masculine attire. \"Something that is worth our\nwhile to know all about,\" she continued.\n\n\"But, Nanna----\" began Esmay, doubtfully.\n\n\"Do you suppose that our master is going out to pick flowers? Help me\nwith this buckle, little sister, and talk not so foolishly.\"\n\nAnd forthwith Esmay submitted to this new Nanna in doublet and\nsmall-clothes, who spoke with authority and took such tremendously long\nstrides. If great events were really at hand, it were well to be\nforewarned, and Nanna, thanks to the dash of wild-folk blood in her\nveins, would be both hawk and hound upon such a trail. So Esmay\ncontented herself with an admonition to caution, and helped the\nimpatient one to depart, stealing down with her into the great hall, in\norder to rebolt the outer door. She feared lest she might meet Quinton\nEdge as she remounted the stairs and flew along the corridor to her\nroom, but she regained its shelter undisturbed. It had been many weeks\nnow since the master had returned, but Esmay had only seen him at a\ndistance, walking for hours at a time in the garden. Strange, that\nseemingly he should have forgotten her very existence, but neither sign\nnor message had come to her. Even his larger plans had apparently been\nlaid aside; not once had he left the boundaries of Arcadia House, except\nfor the weekly council meeting at the Citadel Square. But perhaps,\nagain, this was the crisis for which he had been waiting; even as she\nmeditated she heard his step in the hallway and his knock at her door;\nthen it opened, and Quinton Edge stood before her.\n\nHe did not appear to notice Nanna's absence, but crossed over to the\nwindow where Esmay stood. \"Come,\" he said, and Esmay obeyed, being yet\nfaint with terror lest his hands should touch her. And this he must have\nguessed, for he drew aside and passed out first, motioning her to\nfollow. The door leading to his apartments stood open. Esmay hesitated.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Quinton Edge, and the girl turned and searched his face. She\ndid not understand what she saw there, yet it contented her, and she\ncrossed the threshold. Quinton Edge followed, reappearing almost\nimmediately and carefully locking the door behind him. He descended the\nstairs and passed out to the eastern portico, where his horse should\nhave been in waiting. It was not there, and Quinton Edge grew angry.\n\"Kurt!\" he called, once and twice and thrice. Then at last the\ndelinquent appeared. The sullenness of sleep was still upon him, and\nwhen his master would have reproved him for his tardiness he answered\nback insolently.\n\n\"Enough!\" said Quinton Edge, and struck him across the mouth with his\nriding-whip. Then vaulting into the saddle, he spurred through the\ngateway, riding hard for the northwest.\n\nOld Kurt gazed after his master. \"Thirty lashes at Middenmass,\" he\nmuttered, \"and now this--this----\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree hours later a boyish figure scaled the wall and dropped into the\nsunken way. Fangs, who was sunning herself on the terrace, looked up\nwith white teeth bared, then rose, wagging her tail in friendly\ngreeting. But Nanna, with a hasty word to the dog, entered the house and\nran up to Esmay's room. Great news indeed! But where was the child?\nNanna stood stock-still, gazing stupidly around the empty room. \"Esmay,\"\nshe murmured, in a half-whisper, and passed out into the corridor. She\nwent straight to the door leading to Quinton Edge's apartments. A tiny\nhair-pin of tortoise-shell lay on the floor. Nanna picked it up with a\nsob and regarded it fixedly. She knocked twice upon the door, but there\nwas no response. She tried her strength against it, and shook her head.\nNothing could be done here. She went down-stairs, and looked to see if\nthe key of the wicket gate was hanging in its accustomed place behind\nthe master's leather chair. It was there; she took it and let herself\ninto the street. There was only Fangs, the great, black bitch, to watch\nher go, the dog whining and leaping upon the wicket gate as it swung\nback into place.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\nTHE EVE OF THE THIRD DAY\n\n\nA touch upon Constans's shoulder and a voice in his ear aroused him. He\nsprang to his feet; the sunshine was streaming through the glazeless\ncasements, and Constans, being yet heavy with sleep, blinked against it\nas a man drunken with wine. Oxenford confronted him. \"The attack?\"\nquestioned Constans, and for the life of him could not help yawning\nprodigiously.\n\nRed Oxenford laughed. \"In that case I should have pulled your ear off\ninstead of wasting time shouting into it. By the thunders of God, man,\nbut you sleep soundly.\"\n\nConstans was fully awake now. He glanced at the sun, which was high in\nthe sky, and then at Oxenford's gaunt face.\n\n\"I have left you to do the watching alone,\" he said, apologetically.\n\n\"What matter?\" was the indifferent answer. \"For me slumber would not\nhave meant forgetfulness, and the watching made the waiting so much the\neasier.\"\n\nConstans stood by the window looking across the Citadel Square and\ndirectly up the Palace Road. \"I see no sign of Piers Major,\" he said at\nlength.\n\n\"Down in the square,\" replied Oxenford, laconically.\n\nIn truth there was a most unusual activity pervading the stronghold of\nthe Doomsmen. Already the long rows of guard-huts were tenanted by a\nthrong of women and children, and the number was being constantly\nreinforced by fresh arrivals. Guards were pacing the walls, and a squad\nof the younger men were engaged in setting up the artillery machines for\nhurling stones so as to command the open space in front of the north\ngate. New ropes were being fitted to the torsion levers, and an ox-cart\nloaded with ammunition, in the shape of rounded boulders, creaked\nnoisily through the gateway.\n\n\"The warning must have come down from the High Bridge at an early hour,\"\nsaid Constans, thoughtfully. \"How long has all this been going on?\"\n\n\"Only within the last hour,\" returned Oxenford. \"I waited for the old\ngray wolf himself to seek his lair before arousing you. He has but just\ncrawled into it--out of arrow-shot,\" he added, regretfully.\n\nConstans could see half a dozen of the green-jerkined guards lounging\nabout the entrance to the White Tower, evidence that Dom Gillian was\nresting within. There was nothing to be seen of Quinton Edge, but surely\nhe would not be far away from the storm-centre. Probably he was\ndirecting the defence at the northern boundary or even at the High\nBridge.\n\nSlowly the day dragged on for the watchers in the \"Flat-iron.\" It was\nimpossible to form any conjecture as to how the preliminary conflict was\nproceeding; it was not even certain that it had begun. Piers Major had\nundoubtedly forced the passage of the bridge, but apparently he had been\ncontent with holding his advantage. He might not begin to move until\nlate in the day, and he would proceed slowly and cautiously.\n\nFrom time to time a messenger galloped down the Palace Road. At once he\nwould be surrounded by an eager throng and escorted to the guard-room of\nthe White Tower, where Ulick had set up his headquarters. For it was\nUlick who had been left in command of the citadel garrison and intrusted\nwith the preparations for the impending siege. Twice Constans had caught\nhim fairly with his binoculars, and he could not be mistaken in the\nfeatures and carriage of his friend. His friend--one might say the only\nfriend that he had ever had--and Constans felt his heart heavy within\nhim, knowing that they must henceforth walk on diverging paths.\n\nConstans found it difficult to keep his men under discipline. It was\nall-important that their presence should be unsuspected by the enemy,\nbut it would have been betrayed a score of times had not his vigilance\nintervened. Red Oxenford, in particular, grew more and more\nunmanageable; he had neither eaten nor slept now for three days, and the\nstrain was telling on him. Finally he announced that he would wait no\nlonger. The north gate was open, and what should prevent his walking\nstraight up to the White Tower and sticking his boar-spear into the gray\nwolf's hide? \"And I will--by the seven thunders of God!\" His voice rose\ninto a shriek.\n\nIt took half a dozen men to gag and bind him; he lay on a truss of\nstraw, his eyes fixed malevolently on Constans, whose orders had\nprevented him from carrying out a plan so eminently practicable.\n\nThe shadows were growing long when Piers Minor pointed out a cloud of\ndust far up the Palace Road. Later on they could distinguish the figures\nof men and horses. Stragglers and wounded began to dribble away from the\nfighting-line; they came running down the Palace Road, one by one, then\nin bunches of two and three and four. Piers Major, with his greatly\nsuperior force, was evidently driving the defenders back.\n\nHalf an hour later the conjecture became accomplished fact. The\nDoomsmen, retreating with admirable steadiness, fell back upon the\nshelter of the citadel walls. Quinton Edge, with a score of mounted\ncross-bowmen, brought up the rear, and he himself was the last man to\npass through the north gate.\n\nThree hundred yards away the Stockaders came suddenly into view, but it\nwas close to sunset, the time for the evening meal, and, as though by\nmutual consent, both sides laid aside their arms for the homelier\nutensils of the cuisine. Down in the Citadel Square a hundred little\nfires started up, and as many pots and kettles began to bubble\ncheerfully. The invaders contented themselves with building huge\nbonfires, intended for warmth rather than for cooking, since their light\nmarching order precluded the carrying of anything more than cold\nrations. From far up the avenue came the boom of an ox-horn, militant,\nalmost brazen in its sonority. A drum, beaten noisily, rattled back an\nimpudent defiance from the citadel.\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\nENTR'ACTE\n\n\nThere had been no final understanding between Constans and Piers Major\nas to the precise line of the attack upon the citadel. That must depend\nupon the successful carrying of the defences at the boundary and upon\nthe duration of the skirmishing in the streets. Both had agreed,\nhowever, that a night assault offered the better chances of victory. The\nStockaders had no siege artillery with which to batter down the gates at\nlong range; they would have to march straight to the walls, and the\ndarkness would be in the nature of a protection from the missiles of the\nenemy. The moon, a little past the full, rose about nine o'clock, but\nits light was liable to be obscured by clouds. One of the sudden changes\ncharacteristic of the month of May was in progress, and a cold wind was\nblowing from the northwest. It promised to be half a gale by midnight,\nand already the sky was partially overcast. The initiative lay, of\ncourse, with Piers Major, and Constans must use his own judgment in\nmaking the diversion in the rear.\n\n\"They are throwing up an inner barricade,\" said Piers Minor, at\nConstans's elbow. He looked, and saw that the space immediately in front\nof the storehouses was being enclosed by a barrier of earth and\npaving-stones. The Doomsmen were prepared, then, for the possible\ncarrying of the main walls by assault. What could be the weak point in\nthe defence?\n\n\"The gate,\" suggested Piers Minor.\n\nConstans levelled his glass and examined the barrier with attention. The\nvaulted archway through the walls was about sixteen feet long by ten\nwide and as many high. At the street end it was closed by a gate\nconsisting of two wooden leaves, swung on hinges in the ordinary manner,\nand having as a central support a stout post firmly sunken into the\nground. The timber construction was of the heaviest, but axe and sledge\nwould make short work of it could they be brought near enough for\neffective use.\n\nAt the inner entrance to the archway was suspended a portcullis of\nwrought-iron bars. This was the real barrier, for, even if the attacking\nparty succeeded in battering down the outer gate, they would find\nthemselves cooped up in the passageway and exposed to missiles\ndischarged both through the grating and from trap-doors in the vaulted\nceiling. A well-conceived theory of defence, but its present practice\nwas complicated by an unexpected difficulty--the portcullis, long\nunused, had become jammed in the ways and refused to descend. A squad of\nmen were sweating at the task, but so far they had accomplished nothing.\n\n\"You are right,\" said Constans, letting the glass fall and turning to\nPiers Minor. \"What can they be thinking of--wasting time in that\nhopeless tinkering? The one important thing is to close the\npassageway--if possible, by means of the portcullis; failing that, to\nblock it up. If Piers Major but knew--nay, he _must_ know.\"\n\nPiers Minor nodded; he understood the appeal.\n\n\"I am going to tell him,\" he said, imperturbably. \"I will be careful\nabout keeping out of sight until well away from the vicinity of the\n'Flat-iron.' So as not to spoil sport for you,\" he added, smiling.\n\nConstans accompanied Piers Minor to the street entrance, going over in\ndetail the message that he was to bear to his father. A final admonition\nof caution, and they parted. It was still broad daylight, and Constans\nreturned to his post of observation.\n\nOf course, the expected happened. A report of the portcullis's\nunserviceable condition had been finally made to Quinton Edge, and\nalready he was on the scene--a master indeed. The confusion, the\ncontradictory babel of voices, dies away into order and silence, and, as\nConstans had foreseen, his orders were to suspend operations on the\nportcullis and proceed with all speed to the blocking-up of the archway.\nChoked to the ceiling with loose stones and other d\u00e9bris, it would be a\nformidable barricade to carry by assault.\n\nConstans strode up and down the room, devoured by impatience. Piers\nMinor had been gone now upward of half an hour, and yet there was no\nsign of preparation in the camp of the allies. It would take possibly an\nhour longer to make the vaulted passage impassable; Piers Major must\nadvance within half that time if he would take advantage of this secret\nweakness in the defence. Failing to do so, he would be thrown back upon\nthe desperate adventure of the scaling-ladders, and the whole issue\nwould then hang upon the effectiveness with which Constans could bring\noff his attack from the rear.\n\nThe restless fit passed, and Constans leaned out upon the window-sill,\nwatching the darkening sky. A fierce revulsion seized him as he pictured\nto himself the scene upon which the morning sun would look--the kennels\nred with blood, the horrors huddled in every corner, all the dreadful\njetsam cast up by the ensanguined tide of war. Of necessity, perhaps,\nmust such things be--the endurance of a lesser evil that the greater\nwrong might be forever blotted out. And yet his heart was heavy.\n\nHe looked out again upon the ruined wilderness of stone that hemmed him\nin. How he hated this monstrous city of Doom, infernal mother of\ntreacheries and spoils! How weary he was of wandering through its stony\nlabyrinths, fit symbol of his own oft-thwarted hopes! A vision of green\nfields and quiet waters rose before him, he seemed to be walking\nknee-deep in the lush grass starred with purple asters and the sweet\nmeadow-flag--it was the old home paddock of the Greenwood Keep; there\nwas the copse of white beeches, and through it came the flutter of a\nwoman's gown. Eagerly he watched as she came to meet him--Issa; then she\nturned her face full towards him, and he saw that it was Esmay. He\nsprang forward.\n\nA roll of drums beating the charge, and Constans started. \"At last!\" he\nsaid.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPiers Minor, keeping as closely as possible to cover, worked his way\nslowly to the northward and towards the Stockader camp, on the Palace\nRoad. But, being unfamiliar with the topography of the district, he\ninsensibly kept edging into dangerous proximity to the Citadel Square;\nsuddenly he found himself within a short block of its eastern front. He\nturned to retreat, and came face to face with a slender, black-eyed\nyouth who must have been following close upon his heels. Discovered, he\ntried to dodge, but Piers Minor was too quick, and they closed. The\nyouth struggled gallantly, but the Stockader had all the advantage in\nstrength; in another moment Piers Minor had his antagonist crushed\nhelplessly into a corner. He looked at the boy contemptuously.\n\n\"Not a sound, mind, or I'll twist your throat as I would a\nmeadow-lark's. Why were you following me?\"\n\nThe black eyes snapped back at him unwinkingly.\n\n\"Let me speak, then--you hurt me.\"\n\nPiers Minor loosened his hold upon the slender throat.\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"You are a Stockader, and there is a young man with you, fair-haired and\nwith dark eyes--Constans by name? Do you know him?\"\n\n\"Well, and if I do?\"\n\n\"Will you tell me where and how I can see him? Just a word, or, if not,\nthen to send him a message.\"\n\n\"It is impossible,\" said Piers Minor, stolidly. \"This is a time of war,\nand only for life and death----\"\n\n\"It is a question of that,\" insisted the youth.\n\nPiers Minor shook himself impatiently.\n\n\"Speak out, can't you? What is it that he would care to know?\"\n\n\"Tell him, then, that last night Esmay disappeared, and yet still\nremains in Arcadia House. He will understand, for he knows Quinton\nEdge.\"\n\n\"A woman!\" ejaculated Piers Minor, in supreme disdain. \"Always that.\"\n\n\"Yes, always that,\" retorted the boy, and Piers Minor burst into a\nlaugh.\n\n\"You are a bold one,\" he said, half admiringly. \"Well, I will tell him;\nI promise you that. And now what am I to do with you?\"\n\nThe boy made a grimace. \"We may part as we have met, with no one the\nwiser.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" said the other, suspiciously. \"You are a\nDoomsman, and you know me to be a Stockader--a spy, if you like. If it\nwere for myself alone I might trust you, but so much may hang----\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly and his eyes darkened. \"The only sure way lies at my\nknife-point.\" He scanned intently the face which paled before his gaze,\nyet changed not in the smallest line.\n\n\"Good!\" said Piers Minor, heartily. \"Although, indeed, I could never\nhave done it. Yet I must bind and gag you,\" he added.\n\nThe boy pouted. \"No; I will not have you touch me.\" He tried by a sudden\nmovement to slip under Piers Minor's detaining hand. The shock displaced\nhis cap, a fastening gave way at the same instant, and a mass of long,\nblack hair tumbled down upon the youth's shoulders. Even then Piers\nMinor, being of masculine slow wit, might not have guessed the truth but\nfor a bright blush that overspread brow and cheek, a confession that\neven his dull senses could not misinterpret.\n\n\"A woman!\" he said, confusedly, and blushed as unrestrainedly in his\nturn.\n\nBeholding his embarrassment, Nanna was relieved of her own.\n\n\"You will have to trust me, you see,\" she said, coldly.\n\nThe abashed Piers Minor murmured an indistinct assent.\n\n\"And you will not forget my message?\"\n\n\"No, no! He shall have it at the earliest possible moment.\"\n\n\"Very good--it is understood, then. Now you may go.\"\n\nPiers Minor had not a word to say. He had been meditating upon a\nthousand possible explanations, excuses, apologies, and his tongue would\nnot utter one of them. He accepted his orders meekly, but as he turned\nto go he managed to stammer out, \"Of course--to meet again.\"\n\nNanna, to her own infinite amazement, answered with a look that meant\nyes, and knew that he had not failed to so understand it. As she walked\nover to the Citadel Square she could feel that he was standing where she\nhad left him and looking after her. She would have turned to fittingly\nrebuke behavior so indecorous, but something told her that her insulted\ndignity would be better saved by removing it to a greater distance.\n\nNanna entered the Citadel Square after some parley with the sentinels on\nthe walls, who grumbled at the trouble to which they were put to let\ndown a rope-ladder; but, being a daughter of the Doomsmen, she could not\nbe denied.\n\nA little crowd of women and elderly men gathered about an ox-cart in the\ncentre of the square attracted her attention. They were listening to a\nspeaker who, standing upright in the wagon-body, was haranguing them\nearnestly. Nanna recognized him--Prosper, the priest.\n\nIt was the old story--repentance, the wrath of the Shining One, and the\nimminence of the judgment. The men of the garrison, absorbed in their\npreparations for defence, paid no heed; only this handful of old men and\nfearful women, who crept a little closer together as they listened and\nsought one another's hands. \"To-day, to-day, even to-day, and Doom is\nfallen, is fallen!\"\n\nA disquieting thought flashed into Nanna's mind, the remembrance of\nthose carefully arranged broken wires in the empty house not more than a\nblock away from the Citadel Square. Then of those other wires in the\ntemple of the Shining One, spluttering their wicked-looking sparks. She\nstrained her ears to catch the humming drone of the engines in the House\nof Power, but there was no sound to be heard--they could not be running.\n\n\"Yet there will be mischief worked to-night if the priest has his way,\"\nsaid Nanna to herself, and shook her black-polled head safely. \"I almost\nwish that I had told _him_ of that, too.\" And then, unaccountably, she\nblushed again, for all that it was dark and no one was looking at her.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\nTHE SONG OF THE SWORD\n\n\nIt did not take long for Constans to arouse and collect his men; tired\nof inaction, they were only too glad to respond to the summons. And at\nthe last, Constans, unable to withstand the entreaty in Red Oxenford's\neyes, ordered his release.\n\n\"But, with the others, you must wait upon my word,\" he said, sternly,\nand Oxenford, fearful above all things of being left behind, gave ready\nassent to the condition.\n\nUnder the south rampart of the citadel they halted. There were but two\nguards on duty here, and they were easily surprised and secured before\nthey could give an alarm. As one by one the rest of the company ascended\nthe scaling-ladder, they were ordered to throw themselves prone on the\nflat top of the wall, to await the final signal. Over at the north gate\nthe clamor grew momentarily--there were blows of axes on wood, and clash\nof arms, and the confused crying of many voices.\n\n\"The snapping-turtle must be at his work,\" said Constans to himself.\n\"Wait until his teeth show through that flimsy wooden screen.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPiers Major had advanced promptly upon receiving the message brought by\nhis son. The chances of a frontal attack had already been discussed\nbetween him and Constans, and the latter had devised a formation which,\nin theory at least, should make such an undertaking feasible. In its\nbasic idea it was the Roman _testudo_, described by Julius C\u00e6sar in the\nGallic Commentaries. The phalanx of marching men were protected from\narrows, darts, and ordinary missiles by a continuous covering formed of\ntheir ox-hide shields, the latter being held horizontally above the head\nand interlocked. The overlapping shields bore a fanciful resemblance to\nthe scaly carapace of a tortoise--hence its name; and, so long as the\nessential principle of unity of action was maintained, it might be\nreckoned an effective engine of warfare.\n\nAs the _testudo_ moved down the Palace Road and towards the wooden\nbarrier of the north gate, it was to be observed that the front-rank men\nand the file-closers carried their shields in the ordinary fashion, in\norder to ward off horizontally flying missiles. Once under the shelter\nof the walls, the leaders would immediately discard their now useless\nbucklers and begin to ply their axes, protected from overhead assaults\nby the overlapping shields of their comrades. The formation advanced\nsteadily; there was a suggestion of terrific irresistibility in the very\nslowness of its progress; to the eager fancy it might have been the\nveritable recreation of some prehistoric monster, the illusion being\nheightened by the torchlight that flickered uncertainly over the rounded\nbellies of the shields of greenish leather and was reflected redly from\ntheir copper bosses.\n\nThe defence had been quick to recognize the character of the assault,\nand had done their best to repel it. The catapults had been brought\ninto action, and their huge projectiles hurtled constantly through the\nair, but for the most part innocuously, the machines not being in the\nbest of order and the artillerymen unpractised in their use. It was not\nuntil the _testudo_ had advanced to within fifty yards that a shot\ndischarged by a machine, worked by Quinton Edge in person, took effect,\nthe missile striking the _testudo_ on the left wing and disabling three\nmen. Before the advantage could be followed up the files had been closed\nagain and the formation had advanced so far that the catapults became\nuseless, it being impossible to depress them beyond a certain angle. The\nfront rank had now reached the barrier, and the axes fell furiously upon\nthe wooden leaves of the gate. The Doomsmen on the walls renewed the\nattack with hand-weapons, the slingers and archers hurling their\nmissiles vertically downward and the spearmen watching their opportunity\nfor an effective body-thrust. The affair would be short and sharp, for\nthe _testudo_ could not be expected to hold its position for longer than\na few minutes--it was not in flesh and blood to withstand indefinitely\nthat fierce and deadly shower. Already there were gaps in the protective\nroof of shields--impossible to repair, for in that close-packed mass the\nbodies of the wounded and dead impeded the progress of those who would\notherwise have taken their places. Yet the struggle went stubbornly on.\n\nA sharp-eyed youth who was lying next to Constans touched him on the\narm, directing his attention to a squad of the defenders who were\nworking to dislodge one of the massive coping-stones of the gateway\narch. Already it was oscillating under the heave of the levers; if it\nfell, a score of men might be crushed beneath its weight, and the\ndestruction of the _testudo_ would be a certainty. Constans raised his\nrifle. It was a long shot, but he could not wait to take deliberate aim;\nhe fired.\n\nThe bullet had found its mark, for one man was fallen where he stood and\nanother nursed a broken wrist. The workers at the gate were thrown into\nconfusion and the stone settled back into its bed. The assailants\nredoubled their efforts, and the thunder of the axe-blows became\ncontinuous.\n\n\"Through! they are through!\" shouted Constans, and sprang down upon the\nbanquette. In his excitement he entirely forgot about the new weapon\nthat had but just now rendered such signal service; he threw aside the\nrifle for the more familiar sword. And he noticed that his followers had\nacted under the same primitive impulse; the fire-stick might be given\nthe honor of drawing first blood, but it was for cold steel to finish\nthe work.\n\nShoulder to shoulder the men raced across the square to the gate. The\nattempt to block up the passage, had failed for lack of time, and the\nStockaders were pouring through pellmell, intent on securing foothold in\nthe open. The Doomsmen, forsaking the now useless walls, met them man to\nman; there was the clash of opposing bucklers, and through the din\npierced the keen, clear ring of blades in play--the Song of the Sword.\n\nThe diversion in the rear came at the opportune moment. The Doomsmen had\nso far greatly out-numbered the Stockaders, and the latter were being\nforced back into the vaulted passage, thereby blocking it against the\nmain body of their comrades. But now the Doomsmen, attacked from behind,\nwere obliged to devote part of their attention elsewhere, the pressure\nat the gateway was relieved, and reinforcements, with Piers Major and\nPiers Minor at their head, made their way through and took active part\nin the struggle. Even then the defenders were slightly superior\nnumerically to the invading party, and the issue remained in doubt.\n\nConstans felt himself carried into the thickest of the press; he fought\non mechanically, thrusting and cutting with the rest, and yet hardly\nconscious of what he was doing. His mind would not work easily; he found\nhimself dwelling upon inconsequential trifles--what had become of his\ncap? and how tall was that big fellow with the broad-axe who seemed so\nanxious to come to close quarters with him? He was not in the least\nafraid, but he wondered if it were possible for him to come out of all\nthis alive. It seemed unthinkable that the ring of steel surrounding him\ncould be broken by any mortal power; sooner or later it must contract\nand crush him. Even the momentary vision of Ulick, stripped to the waist\nand with a broad, red streak across his forehead, failed to arouse him.\nHe could think only of a thresher with his flail as Ulick, bludgeoning\nright and left, won clear from the press of Stockader foes surrounding\nhim and rejoined his own ranks. A confused idea that he wanted to speak\nto Ulick suddenly oppressed Constans; he half started to follow him.\nPiers Minor, at his elbow, held him back and shouted a caution.\n\n\"Keep up your guard, man, or that big chap will have you yet! And let\nthem come to you--don't rush them!\"\n\nIn a hand-to-hand encounter there can be but little opportunity for\nstrategy or leadership, except in the purely physical sense. Yet, on\neither side, the men fought as though animated by a common instinct, the\nDoomsmen striving to force the Stockaders back into the gateway passage,\nand the latter endeavoring to cut their way bodily through the mass of\nthe defenders and so divide its strength. For a while the tide began to\nrun with the allies, and the Doomsmen were obliged to fall back slowly\ntowards the interior barricade on the east side of the square that\nprotected the women and children. Constans, panting from his exertions,\nsnatched at this moment of respite to regain his breath. A moment before\nhe had stumbled against a small keg that was rolling about under the\nfeet of the struggling men; this he up-ended and mounted for a better\nlook around.\n\nIt was true; the Doomsmen were really giving way, and the victory was\nall but won. Yet not quite, for even as he gazed the onrushing line of\nthe triumphant Stockaders sagged backward at the centre, and the\nDoomsman yell broke out. What was it? What had happened?\n\nEmerging from the portal of the White Tower came half a dozen bearers\ncarrying between them a chair in which sat a man--an old man with a\nshock of snow-white hair covering his massive head. And those shoulders\nneeded no identification from the familiar wolf-skin that lay across\nthem. This could be none other than Dom Gillian, Chief and Overlord of\nthe Doomsmen, Father of the Gray People. He wore no armor and carried no\nshield, but his hand gripped a great war-mace studded with silver nails,\nfit emblem of the authority supreme that its own weight had created.\nBut that had been full half a century ago.\n\nThe old man made a movement as though to rise. Two of the attendants\nattempted to assist him, but he waved them back. Ah, the wonder of it as\nthat huge bulk reared itself to full height! An ordinary man might stand\ncomfortably under his out-stretched arm and barely join the tips of his\nfingers in measuring around the monster's girth. But there was more than\nmere bigness with which to reckon. The close observer might notice that\nhis armpits and the corresponding parts under the knee were not hollow,\nas is ordinarily the case, but were filled with a solid mass of muscle\nand tendon. And this was Dom Gillian, with the weight of ninety-odd\nyears upon his back. What manner of man must he have been in the noonday\nof his strength!\n\nAs though by common consent the conflict came to an abrupt end; the two\nlines drew apart and silence fell between them. Dom Gillian took two or\nthree forward steps. He seemed to be uncertain of where to plant his\nfeet, as is the natural consequent when one has not walked for a long\ntime; but once squarely set, he stood solidly--like a column of masonry.\nThe bent shoulders had straightened up and the chest had filled out;\nthere was no evidence of decrepitude in the ease with which he\nmanipulated his ponderous mace, swinging it from side to side in great,\nslow circles. Only Constans noticed that he kept his head turned\nconstantly in one direction, where there was a great flare of light, a\ndozen cressets and link-torches burning together. Could it be that his\neyesight had failed save for the mere distinction between light and\ndarkness? It might be well to know surely, and, stepping down from his\nvantage-point, Constans forced his way to the front. Quinton Edge was\nspeaking, and Constans listened with the rest.\n\n\"If there is one among you,\" he said, with smooth distinctness, \"who\nthinks himself a man, let him stand forth and make answer to our father,\nDom Gillian, face to face, so that our lord may particularly inquire\nconcerning these dogs of Stockaders who dare to show a naked blade in\nthe inmost citadel of Doom the Forbidden. You have tracked the gray wolf\nto his lair, now send you out a gallant who will clip his claws.\"\n\nConstans, intent upon his theory, noticed that Dom Gillian had turned\nhis head in the direction of Quinton Edge's voice when he first began to\nspeak, but almost immediately his attention had flagged and his eyes had\nwandered back to the lights. Now, as Quinton Edge stopped, the old man's\nface changed suddenly, the eyebrows contracting and the jaw setting\nitself rigidly. It seemed as though he were about to speak, but there\nwas only that murmur in his throat, hoarse and unintelligible. Then\nConstans understood that this was no longer a man that stood before\nthem, but merely a wild beast in leash. The monster seemed annoyed by\nthe silence. He moved forward uncertainly for a few steps and stood\nstill; one could hear him purring softly like a big cat.\n\n\"We are waiting,\" said Quinton Edge.\n\nA man brushed by Constans and stepped into the open. It was Oxenford the\n\"Red.\"\n\n\"This belongs to me--to none other,\" he said, and looked about him.\n\nNo man moved.\n\n\"I am ready,\" he continued, and threw his upper coat on the ground\nbehind him. Constans stood for an instant at Oxenford's ear.\n\n\"The old wolf is nearly blind,\" he whispered. \"Take care not to get\nbetween him and the light yonder and you have a chance.\"\n\nOxenford nodded. His manner was quiet and collected, and his face,\nthough pale, had lost the strained look that had characterized it for\nthese last few days. \"Stand clear!\" he said, and Constans moved away and\nstood watching.\n\nMan to man, Oxenford, though by no means a weakling, was yet outclassed\nin every particular of height, weight, and reach. But he possessed one\ninestimable advantage--that of agility. Quick footwork should save him\nat even the closest pinch--that and his wits. Then, if the giant were\nreally blind!\n\nRealizing the futility of trying to meet Dom Gillian with weapons\nsimilar to his own, Oxenford had provided himself with a simple\ntruncheon of lignum-vit\u00e6, while in his belt was stuck a broad-bladed,\ndouble-edged knife. The latter was for close quarters, but it would\nrequire some manoeuvring to get there, and Dom Gillian would ask\nopportunity but for one clean stroke.\n\nThe men faced each other steadily for perhaps a minute. Then Oxenford\nrapped his antagonist smartly across the knuckles and sprang back out of\nreach. The colossus, with a growl, swung his mace to right and left,\nstriking at random, for Oxenford had cunningly contrived to turn Dom\nGillian so that the light was at his back. Quinton Edge must have\nnoticed the ruse, for he beckoned to an attendant and ordered that\nevery available torch and cresset should be placed about the arena. But\nthe affair was over long before the command could be obeyed.\n\nAgain the giant struck out, and this time so strongly that he came near\nto losing his balance. Oxenford, rushing in, discharged a quick half-arm\nblow on the Doomsman's right wrist, and the mace dropped from the\nsuddenly paralyzed grip. Confused and terror-stricken, Dom Gillian\ndropped on all-fours, groping about in the darkness for the weapon that\nhad rolled away and out of immediate reach. Oxenford, drawing his knife,\nstruck downward, aiming for the angle of neck and collar-bone. But in\nhis eagerness he overshot the mark, the blade making only a trifling\nflesh wound, and the next instant Dom Gillian had him in his clutch. The\ntwo stood up together.\n\nIt seemed a long time, hours indeed, that Dom Gillian waited for his\ninjured wrist to recover its strength, holding Oxenford easily in his\nleft hand and shaking the other incessantly to restore the interrupted\ncirculation. Even when at last satisfied that the wrist could be trusted\nto do its duty, he did not appear to be in any hurry; he seemed to be\nmeditating upon the most effective use to which he could apply the\nadvantage that he had gained. Then, suddenly, Dom Gillian bent down and\ngrasped his victim by the ankles, swinging Oxenford into the air as\neasily as a thresher does his flail. With every muscle starting to the\nstrain, the Doomsman whirled his enemy's body once, twice, and thrice,\nat full sweep about his head, then downward into crushing contact with\nthe pavement. A final superhuman effort, and the inert mass was hurled\nclean over the heads of the on-lookers, falling with the dead sound of\nover-ripe fruit against the wall of the White Tower.\n\nA full minute passed, and still every eye remained fixed on Dom Gillian.\nHe had not moved, except to turn his head again in the direction of the\nlight--a dumb instinct like to the compass-needle that seeks the\nmagnetic pole. A colossal statue, but Constans fancied that it was\nswaying at its base, then he saw the great chest heave convulsively and\na bubble of reddish foam issuing at his lips.\n\nBut the man was dying hard; in another moment he had straightened up,\nand was resolutely swallowing back the salty, suffocating tide, beating\nthe air with his hands as he strove for breath. Only for an instant,\nhowever, for now the tide had become a flood, and, with a little fretful\nmoan, like to that of a tired child, Dom Gillian, Overlord of Doom, sank\nto earth, not falling headlong, as does a felled tree, but quietly\nsettling into a heap, just as an empty bag collapses into itself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe fighting had begun again; no man could say why or how. True, the\nDoomsmen had been disheartened by the fall of their champion, but they\nwere not yet ready to yield themselves; they had retreated to the\nshelter of the interior barricade, and would make there a final stand.\nThe Stockaders, flushed with anticipated triumph, drove blindly,\nrecklessly at the barrier. Constans felt the blood singing in his ears,\nthen a weight suddenly lifted from his brain; his eyes cleared and the\nfierce joy of conflict captured him. He forced his way to the front,\ngaining foothold on the barricade. Ten feet away stood Quinton Edge,\nand Constans's heart was glad. At last!\n\nA hand caught at the skirt of his doublet, and impatiently he jerked\nhimself loose. Again the detaining grasp; he bent down to strike and\nlooked into Ulick's eyes. Obedient to the unspoken request, he knelt\ndown and tried to move his friend into a more comfortable position. The\ncrushed chest sank horribly under his hands, and he was obliged to give\nover.\n\n\"Close to me,\" whispered Ulick, and Constans bent his head to listen.\n\n\"It is of Esmay,\" he said. \"Nanna but just now told me--a\nprisoner--Arcadia House--you will go to her?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Constans.\n\nBut Ulick had followed the direction of his eyes and seen that they\nrested on Quinton Edge.\n\n\"At once; it must be now--else too late.\"\n\nConstans did not answer.\n\n\"Now!\" reiterated Ulick, insistently.\n\n\"I cannot.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I will not.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nConstans's voice was hard; he rose to his feet.\n\n\"I have been waiting upon this chance for years--you do not understand.\"\n\n\"Yes--I understand.\"\n\n\"All along; it was you who loved her.\"\n\n\"But you--whom she loved.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Constans, sullenly.\n\n\"It is--true.\"\n\n\"No!\" again cried Constans. Then, suddenly, it seemed that a great\nlight shone about him. But the wonder of it lay not in this new\nknowledge of Esmay's heart, but in the revelation of his own. He loved\nher, he knew it now, and not as in that brief moment of passion at\nArcadia, when even honor seemed well lost. For this was the greater love\nthat draws a man to the one woman in the world who has the power to lift\nhim to the heights whereon she herself stands. A supreme joy, that\nhumbled even while it exalted, swept over Constans. \"I will go,\" he\nsaid, and took Ulick's hand in both his own.\n\nThe storm-centre of the fighting had moved away from them; above their\nheads the stars shone serenely. Constans could not speak, but he pointed\nthem out to his friend.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPiers Minor, fighting in the press at the gate as became his stout\nbreed, chanced to rescue a boy from being crushed to death. The lad had\nbeen crowded up against a projecting angle and was quite breathless when\nthe Stockader, arching his back against the pressure, broke the jam by\nsheer strength and pulled the stripling out of his dangerous position.\nBut what a fine color came back into the white cheeks as the twain\nrecognized each other!\n\n\"You!\" said Nanna, and at that moment she would have given all she\npossessed in the world for just a skirt.\n\n\"You!\" re-echoed Piers Minor, and immediately a horrible dumbness fell\nupon him.\n\nThe thunder of the captains and the shouting filled their ears, but they\nheard not, the red light of battle danced before their eyes, but they\nsaw not. Some miracle swept them clear of the struggle, and guided them\nto the shelter afforded by a half-completed barricade of ox-carts. And\nhere Piers Minor, seeing that she trembled and edged closer to him like\nany ordinary woman, took on a wonderful accession of courage.\n\n\"Little one!\" he murmured, in his big, bass voice, and laughed\ncontentedly, just as though death were not standing at his other elbow.\nBut then Piers Minor was not a man to think of more than one thing at a\ntime.\n\n\"I have seen Ulick,\" whispered Nanna, \"and he promised to give the\nmessage to Constans. Surely he will do so--tell me?\"\n\nPiers Minor put his arm around her. \"Of course,\" he answered, stoutly,\nwithout comprehending in the least who Ulick was or what the message\ncould be about. But he did understand that she wanted comfort in her\ntrouble, and so he said and did precisely the right thing. All of which\nwas exceedingly clever for Piers Minor.\n\nSome one brushed rudely against them, and Piers Minor turned in anger.\nBut Nanna laid her hand upon his arm. \"Hush!\" she said, \"it is Prosper,\nthe priest.\"\n\nThe old man stood motionless for an instant surveying the wild scene\nbefore him.\n\n\"It is the third day,\" he muttered, \"the day of Doom. The day and now\nthe hour. So be it, lord; it is thy will, and I obey.\"\n\nWith the last word he wheeled and disappeared into the shadows. An\nintuitive sense of the impending peril seized the girl. \"Come!\" she\npanted, and dragged at her companion's sleeve. \"It is the vengeance of\nthe Shining One. But there is a chance--if we follow.\"\n\nPiers Minor did not hesitate. \"As you will,\" he said, briefly, and Nanna\nflashed back at him a brilliant smile, hand-in-hand they sped through\nthe now deserted passageway of the north gate.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the last time Constans bent his lips to the ear of the dying man.\n\"Ulick!\" he called. There was no answer, and Constans felt that the hand\nthat lay in his was growing cold. Then for one brief instant the soul\nlooked out from the hollowed eyes.\n\n\"The sun!\" he said, and smiled as one who, having kept the watches of a\nlong night, looks upon the dawn. \"The sun!\" he cried again, and his\nspirit went forth to meet it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nConstans rose unsteadily to his feet.\n\nThe sun! A vivid glare beat down upon him. The sun! and rising in the\nwest!\n\nA vast shaft of fire shot upward to the zenith, and all along the\nwestern horizon pinnacles and roof-line stood out etched in crimson.\nConstans saw that the entire quarter of the city west of the Citadel\nSquare was in conflagration, and the flames, borne on the wings of a\nnorthwest gale, came driving swiftly down. A rain of red-hot cinders\nfell about him.\n\nA shout of terror went up from Doomsmen and Stockader alike, and the\nfighting ended abruptly. Then began a rush for the gate, victors and\nvanquished mingled indiscriminately together, constrained only by the\none common impulse to seek refuge in flight. To add to the confusion,\nfresh explosions were heard on the north and south, followed almost\nimmediately by the appearance of flames in these latter quarters. Where,\nthen, led the path to safety?\n\nConstans, running towards the southern rampart, where he knew he should\nfind his ladder, saw a tall figure just ahead of him. He recognized\nQuinton Edge, but the Doomsman had reached and scaled the wall before\nConstans could overtake him. Yet he caught a glimpse of his enemy\nproceeding rapidly in a northeast direction. Constans followed\nimmediately, tightening his belt for the hard run that lay before him.\n\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\nDOOMSDAY\n\n\nProsper's start upon Piers Minor and Nanna had been a short one, and\nunder ordinary circumstances he could hardly have retained his\nadvantage. But in her nervous confusion Nanna made two wrong turns, and\nso many precious moments were wasted.\n\nA quarter of a mile away from the citadel they were halted by the sound\nof a heavy explosion. Piers Minor spoke his astonishment frankly.\n\n\"Thunder on a cool night in May! Who ever heard of such a thing?\"\n\n\"It is the voice of the Shining One,\" said Nanna to herself, and hurried\non the faster.\n\n\"Yet the lightning must have struck somewhere,\" persisted Piers Minor,\n\"for the sky is red. There! look for yourself.\"\n\nHalf a dozen blocks away to the westward they could see flames shooting\nfrom the windows of a warehouse. Its contents must have been highly\ncombustible, for they were burning like chaff in a furnace draught. As\nthey stood and watched the conflagration a second explosion occurred,\nand so close at hand that the ground seemed to rock beneath their feet.\nAnd with that Nanna's heart grew faint within her, for now she knew\ncertainly that they were too late. The Shining One had spoken, and Doom\nwas falling.\n\nPiers Minor looked at his companion with troubled eyes. What was this\ndevil's work?\n\n\"The Shining One,\" she whispered, and clung to his arm. \"See how his\ntongues of fire lick up the dust of Doom.\"\n\n\"But who is the Shining One?\" demanded the young man, wonderingly.\n\n\"Listen!\"\n\nDeep under the crackling of the flames vibrated the diapason of the\ngreat dynamo. Piers Minor turned pale.\n\n\"He speaks,\" whispered the girl. \"And now look, look!\"\n\nA little distance away stood one of the ancient telegraph-poles carrying\na tangled mass of wire ends. The pole had been swaying dangerously in\nthe rising gale; now with a loud crack it broke off close to the ground\nand fell so that the wires were brought into naked contact with a copper\ncable suspended on the opposite side of the street. Instantly the \"dead\"\nwires awoke to life, spluttering and hissing like a bunch of snakes; a\ncataract of yellow-blue sparks poured from the broken ends.\n\n\"The tongues of fire,\" said Nanna. \"You may have seen them devour a\nsingle tree in the forest or suck out a man's life with a touch, but\nto-night they are hungry and they are eating up the world.\"\n\nA terrifying conclusion that was not so far away from the truth. During\nthe last few minutes the area of the conflagration had increased\ntremendously and the whole central portion of the city, including the\nCitadel Square, was now a vast furnace in which no life could possibly\nexist. For the moment the general direction of the wind had shifted, and\nthe flames were not bearing down so rapidly as before upon the two\nfugitives. They would be in comparative safety for some time yet unless\nthe gale veered back to its former quarter.\n\n\"We can never get through to the north,\" said Piers Minor.\n\n\"There is no necessity,\" returned Nanna. \"I know of a wharf on the\nLesser river where the shad-fishers keep their boats. We can reach it\nfrom here in a quarter of an hour.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Piers Minor, and waited for her to lead the way. Then, as\nshe still held back, he went on, impatiently, \"The wind may change at\nany moment, and it is foolish to wait.\"\n\n\"It is my sister,\" explained the girl. \"She is here in the city--a\nprisoner----\" Her voice shook and failed her.\n\n\"But what can we do?\" asked the young man. \"You do not even know--in\nQuinton Edge's house, you say? But that is a mile or more away, and the\nroad is already blocked. It is impossible.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know, but suppose there should be a chance--the hand that has\nmoved the Shining One to strike, may it not be lifted again to repair\nthe evil?\"\n\n\"I do not understand,\" said Piers Minor.\n\nAnd thereupon Nanna described as clearly as she could the part that\nProsper, the priest, had played in the impending tragedy. Surely he\nmight be prevailed upon to avert the judgment from the innocent. He who\nhad released the flames could as easily restrain them. Or, at least,\nArcadia House might be spared.\n\n\"But where are we to find him?\"\n\nNanna pointed down the street. \"There--in the House of Power.\"\n\n\"Come,\" he said, and they went on quickly.\n\nAt the entrance to the temple of the Shining One they stopped and\nlistened. The air was all tremulous with the hum of the rapidly\nrevolving dynamos, the thud of the reciprocating machinery, and the\ngrinding of the badly lubricated shafting.\n\nPiers Minor knew that he was horribly afraid, but for very shame he\ncould not hold back. Together they stole a little way within the vaulted\nentrance and listened again. Nothing but the roar of the machinery. The\nvast hall would have been in utter darkness save for the glare of the\nconflagration; as it was, they could see clearly that there was nobody\nwithin.\n\n\"The little room beyond,\" said Nanna, and shivered. These were forbidden\nsights for a woman's eyes, and the god would be very angry. Yet it must\nbe done. They joined hands like two children and went forward.\n\nNow they stood, wondering, within the little room with its low ceiling\nand bare white walls. Could it be that so great a god as the Shining One\ncould dwell here? An empty room, save for the oak chair standing in the\nmiddle of the floor and that curious-appearing board fixed against the\nwall, with its multiplicity of keys, knobs, and levers. That was all,\nand yet a vague terror laid its hand upon them; they remained motionless\nand speechless.\n\nSomething, some one had entered the room--slow footsteps and the rustle\nof trailing garments. Then the sound of a lever snapped to its\nconnecting points, and the great, shining face flamed out of the\ndarkness. In his intense absorption, the old priest saw nothing of the\ntwo who also waited there. Advancing to the centre of the room, he stood\nand looked upon the countenance of the Shining One, while a man might\ncount twoscore. Then he spoke, slowly and hesitatingly, as one who\nexcuses himself of grievous fault:\n\n\"Let the Shining One be content--it is accomplished. And now, O father,\nhave mercy. For the sins of thy people--a sacrifice----\"\n\nWith unfaltering step he walked to the great chair and seated himself.\nThen, in a clear voice, \"Lord--if indeed thou art lord----\" There was\nthe click of a switch-key; the man's body half rose from its seat and\nsank back again.\n\nPiers Minor felt the girl's dead weight thrown suddenly upon him.\n\"Nanna!\" he cried, and she responded bravely, fighting with all her\nstrength against the inflowing tide of faintness. One forward step,\ntaken with infinite precaution, and then another. The stillness remained\nunbroken.\n\nThe great chair stood with its back towards them, and they could not see\nthe seated figure. But Piers Minor caught one glimpse of a hand gripped\nhard upon the chair arm, and he saw that it was burned hard and black as\na coal. Now the door was within reach and they passed out. In the little\nroom, Prosper, the priest, sat upon the knees of the Shining One, and\nthe great, white face looked down upon him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNot an instant too soon had Piers Minor and Nanna reached the open\nstreet. The wind had shifted back to the northwest, and the fire,\nbreaking out in one place after another from the gale-scattered brands,\nwas coming down upon them in great bounds, as though it were some\ngigantic beast of prey. A suffocating smoke choked their throats and\nnostrils; they could neither speak nor breathe. Then, by the mercy of\nGod, a fierce counter-current drove the smoke back a little way; they\nran at full speed towards the south-east. Now they stopped an instant to\nrefill their panting lungs, then on again, for the air about them was\nfull of flying sparks that stung the unprotected flesh and even burned\nholes in their clothing of stout woollen. On and on, till their heads\nfelt light as a child's toy balloon and the blood in their ears pounded\nlike a mill-wheel. Piers Minor stumbled and fell.\n\n\"I am blind,\" he gasped. \"Leave me.\" But Nanna would not give over,\ntugging at the man's weight until she had him to his feet again, with a\nconvenient railing at his back. She picked up some water from the gutter\nwith her hands held cup-wise, and dashed the liquid in his face. Piers\nMinor straightened up, and from his eyes the darkness cleared away.\n\n\"Courage!\" she said, and he smiled back at her.\n\nThere was the shining of the river; now they could see the pier and the\nboats of the shad-fishers lying alongside. Piers Minor cast off the\nlargest and most seaworthy-looking of the lot, and, without troubling to\nbail out the standing water, he brought the craft broadside to the wharf\nand held out his hand to Nanna. But she, looking to the northward, where\nthe gilded cupola of Arcadia House shone out against the sky, neither\nmoved nor spoke.\n\n\"Come,\" he said.\n\nThe girl turned. \"She is there,\" she said, and pointed to the north. \"I\nmust go to her--my little sister.\"\n\nPiers Minor swung himself up on the wharf and seized her.\n\n\"You shall not,\" he said.\n\nShe tried to wrench herself free; she struck him full in the face. But\nPiers Minor only smiled grimly and held on the tighter. And then, to his\nastonishment, this tiger-cat became suddenly metamorphosed into a dove.\nHer breast heaved, and she turned her head away; he knew that she was\nweeping just like any other woman. Whereat Piers Minor smiled again, but\nnot grimly, and held her a little closer.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said, and forced her gently to look at him. \"It is\nimpossible to reach Arcadia House; even now the fire is there before\nyou. You must believe that Constans received the message and was able to\nget there in time. Believe it, because it is I who tell you.\"\n\nShe did believe, but, being a woman, she hesitated again--at the very\nbrink of surrender.\n\n\"Let me go,\" she said, in a low tone, and Piers Minor was so astonished\nthat he immediately complied, and stood looking at her helplessly. But\nwhen, coloring like a rose and with downcast eyes, she would have passed\nhim, the masculine instinct of possession awoke again; he barred the way\ndeterminedly.\n\nA little distance away an enormous brick storehouse was burning\nfiercely. A tremendous explosion threw a roof bodily into the air; a\nshower of incandescent particles descended and drove directly at the\nfugitives. Nanna felt herself lifted bodily off her feet and swept with\na rush down the wharf. One little gulp of regret for her lost\nindependence and she yielded--deliciously. The boat rocked from side to\nside, then it shot out upon the open river.\n\nPiers Minor had stopped rowing, for the sparks no longer fell about\nthem. The spectacle of the burning city was a magnificent one. The\ninverted bowl of the sky shone as though it were made of copper, and the\ngale had flattened out the flames horizontally so that they resembled\nthe flying masses of a woman's unbound hair.\n\nNanna's eyes filled with tears.\n\n\"It was my world,\" she said, softly, \"the only one I knew.\"\n\n\"Nanna!\" said Piers Minor. She let her hand rest in his, and the boat\nfloated on.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\nIN THE FULNESS OF TIME\n\n\nThe streets were as light as noonday, and Constans found no difficulty\nin keeping the dying figure in sight. But, run as he would, he could not\ngain a yard.\n\n\"Arcadia House,\" muttered Constans, under his breath, as he noticed the\ndirection taken by the runner. What more natural than that a man should\nseek his own home at such a time? But Constans's brow was clouded as he\nfollowed in Quinton Edge's footsteps.\n\nArcadia House, and why? There could be but one answer to that question\nafter Nanna's message, conveyed to him through Ulick's dying lips. Esmay\nhad disappeared, and yet had remained in Arcadia House. He, who knew\nQuinton Edge, would understand.\n\nConstans told himself grimly that he did understand. This insolent\nwanted the girl, just as he had desired many another thing in life, and\nit had always been his way to take what he coveted. But this\ntime--Constans set his teeth hard, and now, at last, Arcadia House was\nin sight.\n\nDuring this last quarter of an hour the progress of the conflagration\nhad been perceptibly slower, and the great sheaf of flame in the western\nsky had almost disappeared. It was like the lull that so often takes\nplace in a storm, a period of sudden quiet in the element strife that\nshould warn the prudent that the worst is still to come. To Constans it\nwas the most fortunate of happenings, the comparative darkness enabling\nhim to keep close upon Quinton Edge without risk of discovery.\n\nAs though satisfied that he had arrived in time, Quinton Edge now\nslackened his pace, making for the gateway on the side street. Whereupon\nConstans determined to scale the wall at the rear and take the short cut\nthrough the garden, so as to intercept the Doomsman at the entrance.\nOnce over the wall, the way was clear. Disdaining caution, he crashed\nrecklessly through the shrubbery, the wet and tangled grass wrapping\nitself exasperatingly about his ankles as he ran. At the carriage-drive\nhe stopped, flinging himself full length on the ground and close against\nthe wall that marked the sunken way. The run had winded him, and he was\nthankful for the moment's breathing-space.\n\nFrom where Constans lay he could command sight of the north terrace that\nconnected the porticos of the river and western fronts. Suddenly it\nseemed to him that the terrace was occupied by some living thing. A\nmoment before he had noticed a darker blur in the shadows at the river\ncorner; it had appeared to move. He heard a soft padding on the\nflag-stones as of an animal moving cautiously. He strained his eyes,\nstriving to resolve that dusky blotch into shape intelligible; then a\nnew burst of flame lit up the western sky and he saw clearly--it was\nFangs, the hound.\n\nThe dog stood motionless, her head thrown upward as though listening.\nShe could not possibly see Constans where he lay, but the smallest noise\nmust betray him.\n\nHis revolver was in a side pocket, and he drew it forth with infinite\ncare. Then he discovered that it was unloaded and that he had no more\ncartridges. His knife also had disappeared from its sheath; he realized\nthat he was absolutely unarmed and helpless.\n\nThe hound leaped lightly from the terrace and began ranging in great\nhalf-circles. Constans looked on with fascinated eyes. It could be a\nmatter of seconds only when she must cross his scent, and he knew that\nshe would remember it--there was a blood-feud between them--the death of\nBlazer, who had been her mate.\n\nThe pass-key rattled in the lock of the postern-door, and Quinton Edge\nentered the sunken way. Fangs heard the noise, hesitated a moment, then\ntossed her black muzzle in the air and bounded forward to meet her\nmaster. Constans wiped away the sweat that was blinding his eyes and\nwaited. Quinton Edge, with the hound by his side, went up the steps\nleading to the terrace.\n\nSome one came forward to meet him--a slim, womanish figure dressed in\nwhite. Constans's heart gave a great bound, for who but Esmay carried\nher small head with so irresistible a grace. She held out her hands as\nQuinton Edge reached her side, but he crushed her into his arms and\nkissed her on the lips. They walked slowly along the terrace, turned the\ncorner of the eastern portico, and disappeared. Constans, running up,\nwas just an instant too late; he heard Quinton Edge calling the dog\ninside, then the sound of the closing door.\n\nBy a supreme exercise of will Constans stopped short of the insanity\nthat impelled him to thunder on the barrier and demand admittance. Yet\nhe must gain instant entrance to the house, and he ran around the\nterrace to the river portico. As he had expected, the hall-door was\nfastened, but he had no difficulty in forcing one of the long windows of\nthe drawing-room; he stepped into the dark and empty room and stood\nlistening.\n\nThere was perfect silence everywhere, but he could not trust to it--eyes\nand ears might be in waiting at every turn, and, above all, there was\nthe dog. He wondered that the hound had not already detected his\npresence in the house, and his pulse thumped at the thought; he fancied\nthat he could hear deep breathing and the oncoming of padded feet.\n\nThe minutes passed, and the silence remained unbroken. Then the sense of\nhis cowardice smote him; the jaws of the brute would be preferable to\nthis intolerable inaction, and he went forward through the half-opened\ndoor and into the main hall.\n\nThis, too, was empty, and, having windows that faced the west, it was\nsufficiently well lighted by the conflagration to make the fact of its\ndesertion certain. And Constans owed it to the friendly flames that he\nwas once more provided with a weapon. There was a rapier hanging upon\nthe wall, slender and yet strong, of very ancient make; in an instant he\nhad it down and was trying the temper of its blade upon the hearthstone.\n\nThe touch of the cold steel was like a tonic; heart and blood responded\nimmediately. Its discovery had been a fortunate chance, for again the\nillumination in the west died down the final pianissimo before the full\ncrash of the orchestra--and the darkness returned deeper than before.\n\nConstans, with the rapier held shortened in his hand, found his way to\nthe staircase and began the ascent. At the turn of the second landing he\nstopped, feeling instinctively that there was something in the way. When\nhe could bear no longer to wait and listen, he put his hand down and\nfelt beneath it the smooth, hairy coat of the hound's body. The dog was\nquite dead, and lying in a pool of her own blood; there was a warm,\nsickly smell of salt in the air, and Constans's hand was wet when he\nfetched it away. Who had done this thing, and why?\n\nHe went on, with every sense on edge. He could hardly have mistaken his\nway now, for the door before him stood partly ajar, and there was a\nlight in the room; Constans guessed that it must be the first of the\nprivate apartments belonging to Quinton Edge.\n\nHe looked in. The room was a large one and luxuriously furnished. An\nancient hanging-lamp of brass hung from the ceiling, diffusing a soft\nradiance; the curtains that concealed the deep window-seat were closely\ndrawn, and, had Constans made his observations with more care, he might\nhave noticed that something moved behind them, an unwieldy bulk that\ngathered itself as though for a spring.\n\nBut he took no account of these smaller things, his eyes being full of\nEsmay only, and surely that was she who stood there in the shelter of\nQuinton Edge's arms; now she half turned her head, the better to look\ninto her lord's face, and Constans could trace the outline of her\nprofile--the upper lip, so deliciously short, and the exquisite curve\nof her throat. His breath came quick as he watched them, and his grasp\ntightened upon the rapier hilt. So she had deceived him, after all; she\nhad played the traitress from the very beginning. Twice, now, she had\nsmiled into his eyes and sold him for some piece of trumpery--a bracelet\nof carbuncles or a kiss from Quinton Edge's lips. Well, he could kill\nthem both, and almost at a single stroke, since they stood with their\nbacks to the doorway and were quite unconscious of his presence. But,\nupon further thought, he determined to wreak positive vengeance on\nQuinton Edge alone. It was shame to strike a woman, and unnecessary--it\nwould be her punishment to live.\n\nDispassionately he reviewed his decision and reaffirmed it; it was now\nthe time for action. But he had delayed just a moment too long. Before\nhe could take that first forward step the one who waited behind the\nwindow-curtains had passed before him, an ungainly figure of a man, who\nlimped upon one knee and whose black beard fell like a curtain before\nhis cruel mouth and lips--Kurt, whom men called the \"Knacker.\" A knife\nwas in his hand, and he struck once and twice at Quinton Edge.\n\n\"This for the thirty lashes at Middenmass!\" he shouted; \"and this----\"\n\nBut here Constans's rapier passed through his throat, and he fell back,\ngurgling horribly and tearing at his windpipe.\n\nIt had all happened so quickly that the two living men could only stare\nalternately at each other and at the burden that lay in Quinton Edge's\narms. A slim, white figure, with that red stain upon her\nbreast--spreading, spreading.\n\nConstans gathered himself with a mighty effort. \"Let me help you,\" he\nsaid, and between them they carried her over to the couch and laid her\ndown. On a near-by table stood a ewer of water; Constans fetched it and\nbegan moistening the bloodless lips. They parted with a little sigh, and\nthen the eyes of his sister Issa opened upon him. \"Little brother,\" she\nwhispered, and smiled.\n\nConstans looked over at Quinton Edge, but he shook his head and stood\nback among the shadows.\n\n\"Little brother,\" said Issa again, and put out a wavering hand.\n\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\nDEATH AND LIFE\n\n\nIt had been very quiet in the room for a long time. Constans had tried\nto make the dying woman more comfortable, but every attempt to move her\nhad only resulted in the wound breaking out afresh. It was cruelty to\npersist, and so he gave it over, waiting for what must come.\n\nNow it seemed that Issa slept, for her eyes were closed and the lines of\npain had wholly disappeared from the smooth, white brow. Quinton Edge\nkept his place at the back, where he could see and not be seen; a statue\ncould not have been more immobile. Constans, kneeling by the couch,\nstill held his sister's hand in his, keeping watch upon the pulse that\nfluttered so delicately. Once or twice the heavy eyes had opened and she\nhad smiled up at him--contentedly as a child resting after the long\nday's play.\n\nConstans had not attempted to speak; his mind was still seeking its\nwonted bearings, and he was afraid. His sister Issa!--the little Issa\nwith whom he had played at fox-chase and grace-hoops. Issa!--the maiden\nwho had gathered her May-bloom in the long ago, and who had given\nherself and all for love of the stranger within her father's gates; yes,\nand who had died within that self-same hour upon her lord's breast.\n\nAnd yet if this miracle were indeed the truth it accounted for more than\none thing that had troubled him. He remembered now the white-robed\nfigure that had appeared to him in the gardens of Arcadia House and the\nsuperstitious terror with which he had watched it following upon the\nunconscious footsteps of the girl Esmay. Then, again, the fair-haired\nwoman who only a few minutes ago had come to meet Quinton Edge on the\nnorth terrace, an apparition so ravishing that Constans must needs\nconfound it with the flesh-and-blood presentment of his own dear lady.\n\nShe was speaking now, almost fretfully. \"Is the night never to be gone?\nThe hangings at the window are so heavy. And where is my father?\"\n\nConstans rose and went to the window, intent on flinging it wide open.\nBut Quinton Edge was there before him and stayed his hand.\n\n\"No,\" he said, and Constans obeyed, being greatly troubled in mind and\nuncertain of himself, even as one who wanders in a maze. This Quinton\nEdge must have perceived, for he spoke gently, making it plain to him\nthat this was, indeed, the maid whom they had both loved and not some\ndisembodied shadow from the underworld. And having come finally to\nbelieve this, Constans was comforted and desired to hear the matter in\nfull. \"Tell me,\" he said, and Quinton Edge went on:\n\n\"It was weeks and weeks that she lay weak and speechless upon a pallet\nof dried fern, her only shelter the thatch of a mountain sheepfold.\n\n\"There was no one among us who had any knowledge of surgery, and so I\nhad to be content with simples--cold-water compresses for the wound and\na tea made from the blossoms of the camomile flower to subdue the fever\nin the blood. So the days dragged by until the turn for the better came.\nLittle by little I nursed her back to life again, and in time we came\nsafely to Doom.\n\n\"Arcadia House was a secure hiding-place for my treasure, and during all\nthese years no one has even guessed at the secret. I had no need to\ntrust my servants, for they knew nothing; the walls had neither eyes nor\nears, and I kept my own counsel. Until to-day no man's eye but mine has\nlooked upon her face.\n\n\"But even yet you do not wholly understand. Have you forgotten, then,\nthat the body may be in health and yet the soul be darkened? She had\ncome back to life, indeed, but it was the life of a butterfly in the\nsun, unconscious of aught else than the light and warmth that surrounds\nit. For her the past had been sealed; to me the future. Do you\nunderstand now? A woman grown and yet as a new-born babe in heart and\nmind. What was there for me to do but to bear my punishment as patiently\nas I might, the cup of love ever at my lips, but never to be tasted.\"\n\nConstans kept silence for a little space. When he spoke it was\nhaltingly.\n\n\"Then you think--you think----\"\n\n\"She recognized you. Could you not see it--that note in her voice as of\none who wakes from a long sleep? That was why I stopped you from\nthrowing aside the window-curtains. The light of the burning city--it\nmight have brought back the memory of that night at the keep.\"\n\n\"And for the same reason you have kept yourself out of sight,\" said\nConstans, coldly.\n\nThe man trembled. \"Yes; I am afraid,\" he answered, and Constans, for all\nhis bitterness of heart, was fain to pity him.\n\nA series of muffled explosions startled them. Quinton Edge moved softly\ntowards the outer door. \"The fire must be coming nearer,\" he whispered.\n\"I will make sure of our position and return within a few minutes. Hush!\nshe is sleeping again.\"\n\nBut when Constans went and stood by the couch, Issa was looking at him\nwith wide-opened eyes.\n\n\"Constans--little brother,\" she said, weakly, and yet with an infinite\ncontent. He dropped to his knees beside her and tried to answer, but\ncould not.\n\n\"Surely it must be close to morning now,\" she went on, slowly. \"I can\nhear the doves cooing on the tiles, the wind is blowing over the\nwater-meadows, and the lark is in the blue--ah, God! how beautiful this\ndear world of ours! It is the May-time, little brother, and the arbutus\nwill be in bloom--the shy, pink blossoms that nestle on the sunny slopes\nof the rocks and at the roots of the birch-trees. We will gather\nthem--you and I--and bring them home to deck our lady mother's chamber.\nThe May-bloom--it is in the air. How sweet--how sweet!\"\n\nConstans, following the look in her eyes, saw a low table standing\nagainst the opposite wall. Upon it was a bowl filled with the delicate\narbutus--fresh and fragrant as though but lately gathered. He went\nsoftly across the room and despoiled the bowl of a spray. She took it\nfrom him eagerly. Then the violet eyes clouded.\n\n\"I cannot remember--it must be that I am still so tired--it is strange.\nThe morning--it cannot be far distant--now----\"\n\nQuinton Edge at the threshold held up a beckoning finger, and Constans\nwent to him.\n\n\"It is upon us,\" said the Doomsman. \"The out-buildings are smoking\nalready, and the lumber-yard on the north will become a furnace the\ninstant that the first spark falls there. There is but one chance--the\nriver. You will find a boat at the dock. The girl Esmay--ah, you could\nthink that, too, of me. Yet it was natural enough.\"\n\nConstans would have spoken, but the words tripped on his tongue. Quinton\nEdge interrupted him imperiously.\n\n\"She is there,\" he said, and pointed to a door leading to the interior\napartments of the suite. \"I could not leave Issa entirely alone on this\nlast night. So I brought the girl here--for once, she trusted me. For\nonce, you can do likewise.\"\n\nConstans bowed his head. \"But Issa,\" he said, thickly.\n\n\"She would be dead in our arms before we reached the stairs,\" returned\nthe other. \"Can you not leave her to me for just this little while\nlonger?\" His voice hardened savagely. \"She is mine, do you hear--mine,\nmine. I have paid the price, double and treble, and now I take what is\nmy own.\"\n\nHis voice rang like a trumpet in the narrow room. And yet, straight\nthrough its clamor, pierced the sound of a stifled cry. Constans turned\ninstantly, but Quinton Edge, trembling, kept his eyes fixed on the\nfloor.\n\nSitting upright upon the couch, Issa looked at the two men steadfastly,\nand then only at the one. The violet depths in her eyes had darkened to\npools of midnight, and her lips were like a thread of scarlet against\nthe ivory of her face. A miracle! but Constans would not look again,\nknowing that for him this hour had passed forever.\n\nConstans went to the inner door and opened it. Esmay was kneeling at the\nwindow; he went over and touched her on the shoulder. \"Come,\" he said.\nShe looked up at him, and he saw that her face whitened for all of the\nglare from the flaming sky that fell upon it. Yet she let him lead her,\nunresisting, into the other room, where Quinton Edge still stood\nmotionless and looked upon the floor. Constans plucked at his sleeve,\ndrawing him out into the full circle of the lamp-light. Face to face for\nthe last time, and, though no word was said, each knew that there was\npeace between them.\n\n\"Go to her,\" whispered Constans, and pushed him gently towards the\ncouch.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow the room had fallen into semi-darkness, for the oil had failed in\nthe lamp, and there was only that dull-red line along the edge of the\nwindow-curtains. And there was silence, too, for all that words could\nsay had been said already.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe minutes passed, but the man had ceased to count them. The hand that\nlay in his was growing cold, but the knowledge had ceased to concern\nhim; the brain no longer registered the messages sent by the nerves,\nand he was conscious only of an immense weariness, of an overwhelming\ndesire to sleep. The maiden Issa's hair lay within the hollow of his\narm, a pool of rippled gold; it was like looking down into an enchanted\nwell; the waters seem to rise and meet him. The glow at the curtain-edge\ngrew stronger; now it was a lake of liquid fire into which he gazed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe threshold of the door had warped and sprung, and through the crack\ncrept a thin line of smoke; it raised itself sinuously, as does a snake;\nit darted its head from side to side, preparing to strike.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDescending the staircase, Constans saw that the time was growing\nperilously short. On three sides of them the buildings were burning, and\nArcadia House itself was on fire at the southern wing. The hurricane,\nshifting back to the northwest, was at its wildest, and the air was full\nof ashes and incandescent sparks. As Constans and Esmay emerged from the\nshelter of the house, it seemed as though the universe itself was on\nfire. Could they ever hope to reach the river? His heart sank as he\nlooked at that fiery rain through which they must pass. He turned to\nEsmay.\n\n\"It is the only way,\" he began, and then stopped, wondering that she\nshould look so strangely upon him.\n\n\"I thought you dead,\" she answered, humbly. \"It was the last thing I\nheard--the silver whistle and Nanna misunderstood my question.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Constans, enlightened, and at the same time subtly warned\nthat he must not press her too far. \"So you feared that it might have\nbeen my spirit that came to fetch you?\"\n\n\"No; not feared,\" she answered, and with such sweet confidence that\nConstans's heart thrilled to new courage. By God's splendor! this woman\ntrusted him and he would save her.\n\nHalf way to the boat-stage they were caught in a whirlwind of choking\nvapor; they struggled onward for a few steps, and then the girl fell.\nWith infinite difficulty Constans half carried, half dragged her down\nthe last slope to the landing. The boat, a small canoe or dugout, was\nthere, but he could find only one broken paddle. It was a mad thing to\nventure out upon the wind-lashed river with equipment so imperfect, but\nthere could be no choice of another way.\n\nThe tide was running out strongly and Constans could do nothing more\nthan keep the craft on a straight course and out of the trough of the\nheavier seas. He looked longingly at the opposite shore, so near to the\neye and so impossible to attain against that wind and tide; he realized\nthat they were drifting down into the open bay, and that would be the\nend. Yet he would fight for it, and now that the fresh air had aroused\nEsmay from her swoon, she crept to his side and sat there comforting\nhim.\n\nFour hours later the keel grated on a pebbly shingle, and Constans,\nlooking about him with weary eyes, recognized the little bay, with its\nfringing semicircle of trees. Here was the very log upon which he had\nsat and dreamed of unutterable things that bright May morning in the\nlong ago, a dream from which he had awakened to make first acquaintance\nwith Quinton Edge.\n\nA little way up the grassy glade a fire was burning, and there was the\nsavory odor of roasted meat in the air. Constans helped Esmay out of the\nboat, and with stiffened limbs they dragged themselves up the forest\nway. There was a little shriek, a rush of feet, and swishing skirts, and\nNanna's arms were about her sister, while Constans was looking into\nPiers Minor's honest eyes.\n\nFar in the north, a smoke as of a furnace ascended, and the sky was\ndarkened. But here the sun shone brightly, the grass was green\nunderfoot, the birds sang in the branches above their heads, and the\nsmell of the spring-tide was in the air. Truly, life and light are sweet\nto him who has once walked in the shadow.\n\n\n\n\nXXX\n\nTHE STAR IN THE EAST\n\n\nIt was in October of the same year that Constans and Esmay stood one day\nin the court-yard of the Greenwood Keep, now restored and rebuilt.\n\nHis father's blood friends had helped generously in the rehabilitation\nof his fortunes, and Constans had worked hard with his own hands. Now\nthe task was finished, and he had persuaded Esmay to ride over from the\nRiver Barony and pronounce in person upon its merits. For let it be\nknown that Piers Minor had lost no time in bringing home his bride, and\nboth he and Nanna had insisted that Esmay must live with them. And Esmay\nhad accepted gratefully, for all that she was an heiress in her own\nright, through inheritance of her uncle Hugolin's estate, and could have\nbought and sold Piers Minor and Nanna, and all their holdings, ten times\nover. But all of her red gold could not buy love, and Esmay was wise\nenough to know this. Moreover, the River Barony was but twenty miles\ndistant from the Greenwood Keep, and at least twice every week Constans\nrode over and spent the night. It was pleasant to hear him tell proudly\nof the progress of the work; how yesterday the roofing of the\nguard-house had been started, and how to-day they had turned for the\nfirst time the waters of the Ochre brook into the moat. Esmay always\nlistened attentively, and it pleased her to think that Constans looked\nat her when he talked, even though his actual words might be addressed\nto Piers Minor or to Nanna. Listening always, but speaking seldom, for\nshe felt that he was waiting purposely until some milestone of\nachievement had been passed, and she feared that he might consider her\nunwomanly. So the summer had gone, the great work was accomplished, and\nnow they were viewing it together. They had seen everything, going in\nturn from lighting platform to calving-barn; from forge and smithy to my\nlady's bower. And Esmay had duly admired all and pronounced it good.\n\nNow they were standing in the great hall watching the martins as they\ncircled around the red-capped gatehouse, and the white doves cooing in\nthe eaves. A silence had fallen between them, and Constans, leaning\nagainst the window-casement, seemed to have forgotten of Esmay's very\nexistence. Quietly she drew aside and left him, impelled by an\nirresistible desire to know if he would notice her absence and would\nfollow her. Hardly had she stolen five steps away than she heard him\nstart, and then turn to seek her. A sheer delight coursed through her\nveins, and she began to run.\n\n\"Esmay!\" he called, but she would not stop, gathering up her skirts in\nboth her hands, and trying not to look behind her. But he was quickly at\nher heels, and an inexplicable terror seemed to seize her; she looked\nabout for a hiding-place; a door presented itself, and she clutched the\nhandle desperately, but it refused to turn. Seeing her discomfiture,\nConstans believed that he was entitled to enjoy his triumph. He walked\nup with leisurely deliberation. \"You are a goose,\" he said, and took\nher hands in his, as one who reproves a wilful child.\n\nShe assented meekly.\n\n\"To run away like that--so foolish, when I had something serious to say\nto you. Why do you suppose I brought you here? Why should I want you to\nsee the house? why did I build it at all? Be good enough to answer me.\"\n\nShe looked up at him with the most innocent expression in the world.\n\"Why?\" she echoed, as though mightily puzzled, and immediately the male\ncreature became miserably bewildered, and lost his confident bearing in\nthe twinkling of an eye. Had she really misunderstood him? had he been\ndeceiving himself from the very beginning? He turned pale and dropped\nher hands, and she, misinterpreting this relinquishment of ownership,\nfelt the blood receding from her own checks. Two utterly foolish\ncreatures, and yet their folly is not to be argued away by the wise men.\nFor while it is the accepted theory that a woman always knows when she\nis loved (with which men please themselves), and _per contra_ that a man\nis never unconscious of the favor in which he stands (with which women\ntorment themselves), yet the truth is that neither man nor woman is ever\ncertain of the fact until it is finally proclaimed in actual speech. So\nthis is why lovers are always being asked to repeat and repeat again the\nmagic words upon which all their happiness depends.\n\n\"The reason--you know--the reason why,\" he stammered, and then she came\nto his aid.\n\n\"Yes, I know, but _tell_ me.\"\n\nAnd thereupon he did tell her.\n\nA year later, and Constans and his wife sat on a high point of land that\noverlooked the waters of the Lower bay and the broad, salt sea beyond\nthe dunes. Several of Constans's neat-cattle had strayed, and he had\ndetermined to ride to the fishermen's village below the Narrows to\ninquire if the estrays had been seen in that direction. Esmay had\naccompanied him, and they had been all day in the saddle and were weary.\nNevertheless, they were satisfied, for the lost cattle had been\nrecovered, and in the morning the herdsmen would be sent over to drive\nthem home.\n\nThey had shared a frugal supper of bread and cheese and dried grapes,\nand now they were waiting until the horses should have cropped their\nfill. There was no hurry, the moon not rising for an hour yet, and it\nwas useless to arrive at the Kills before the time of slack water.\nConstans had his back against a pine-stump, and Esmay's head rested on\nher husband's shoulder. They sat in silence, gazing out upon the gray\nsea, content in their present happiness and looking forward to a yet\ngreater one in the near future. For to Constans Esmay had just made a\nwife's final confession, the secret being whispered into his inmost ear,\nthough there was only the land and the sea to overhear.\n\nSuddenly, on the darkened eastern sky-line, a bright light flashed out,\nin color like to a star, and yet incomparably more brilliant. And the\nlight was not fixed, but continually changed its base, as was shown by\nthe broad band of rays that now swept the surface of the sea and then\ntraced their luminous way on the overhanging clouds. Another shift and\nthe shining pathway reached to their very feet, illuminating with its\nradiance every object within its focus, down to the tiniest shell upon\nthe beach. Esmay, startled, clung to her husband's arm.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked, but he could not answer her.\n\nYet as they gazed upon the new star, insensibly they became comforted.\nWhatever this prodigy foretold, it could not be an omen of lasting evil.\nHad they not seen for themselves that, even in the worst of worlds,\nrighteousness and justice and truth had been something more than names.\nDoom had fallen; for more than a twelvemonth the ruins had smouldered,\nand to-day they were but the harmless haunt of bat and badger. And the\nworld relieved of that intolerable incubus, and recovered of its purging\nand cleansing sickness, had started once more upon its appointed\npath--slowly, indeed, at the first, but ever onward and upward.\n\n\"It is only one more of the things that we cannot understand,\" said\nConstans at the last. \"But we who love need not fear.\"\n\nHe drew his wife's face to his own, and there, full in the radiance of\nthe unknown star, he kissed her on the lips.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEarly that same evening Sub-Lieutenant Jarvison, watch-officer of the\nelectric cruiser _Erebus_, reported to his commander that a landfall had\nbeen made six points away on the port bow. Captain Laws immediately\nhastened to the bridge of the vessel and ordered that the engines be\nstopped and the customary signals shown. But no reply was received to\nthe rockets displaying the red, green, and white colors of the Antarctic\nRepublican Navy; apparently the country was not inhabited. Yet to make\nsure, the search-light was put in requisition. Up and down, from side to\nside, swept the giant beam, and now they could see that the land on the\nleft rose gradually into a considerable headland. Beyond opened the wide\nwaters of what must be a great bay. Captain Laws reflected for a moment,\nand then gave another order to his executive.\n\nUnder half speed, and with a leadsman in the chains, the _Erebus_ moved\nsteadily towards the unknown coast.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS CORRECTED\n\nThe following typographical errors in the text were corrected as\ndetailed here.\n\nIn the text: \"It was only necessary to dampen these sponges to ensure\na perfect discharge of the electrical current passing through the\nhead-rest ...\" the word \"ensue\" was corrected to \"ensure.\"\n\nSome hypenation was inconsistently used in the original.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
