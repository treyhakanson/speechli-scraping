Starzl_\n\n[Illustration: _This time Forepaugh was ready for it._]\n\n[Sidenote: A stupid blunder--and Mark Forepaugh faces a life of\ncastaway loneliness in the savage welter of the planet Inra's\nmonster-ridden jungles.]\n\n\nThere was no use hiding from the truth. Somebody had blundered--a\nfatal blunder--and they were going to pay for it! Mark Forepaugh\nkicked the pile of hydrogen cylinders. Only a moment ago he had broken\nthe seals--the mendacious seals that certified to the world that the\nflasks were fully charged. And the flasks were empty! The supply of\nthis precious power gas, which in an emergency should have been\nsufficient for six years, simply did not exist.\n\nHe walked over to the integrating machine, which as early as the year\n2031 had begun to replace the older atomic processes, due to the\nshortage of the radium series metals. It was bulky and heavy compared\nto the atomic disintegrators, but it was much more economical and very\ndependable. Dependable--provided some thick-headed stock clerk at a\nterrestrial supply station did not check in empty hydrogen cylinders\ninstead of full ones. Forepaugh's unwonted curses brought a smile to\nthe stupid, good-natured face of his servant, Gunga--he who had been\nbanished for life from his native Mars for his impiety in closing his\nsingle round eye during the sacred Ceremony of the Wells.\n\nThe Earth man was at this steaming hot, unhealthful trading station\nunder the very shadow of the South Pole of the minor planet Inra for\nan entirely different reason. One of the most popular of his set on\nthe Earth, an athletic hero, he had fallen in love, and the devoutly\nwished-for marriage was only prevented by lack of funds. The\nopportunity to take charge of this richly paid, though dangerous,\noutpost of civilization had been no sooner offered than taken. In\nanother week or two the relief ship was due to take him and his\nvaluable collection of exotic Inranian orchids back to the Earth, back\nto a fat bonus, Constance, and an assured future.\n\nIt was a different young man who now stood tragically before the\nuseless power plant. His slim body was bowed, and his clean features\nwere drawn. Grimly he raked the cooling dust that had been forced in\nthe integrating chamber by the electronic rearrangement of the\noriginal hydrogen atoms--finely powdered iron and silicon--the \"ashes\"\nof the last tank of hydrogen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGunga chuckled.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Forepaugh barked. \"Going crazy already?\"\n\n\"Me, haw! Me, haw! Me thinkin',\" Gunga rumbled. \"Haw! We got, haw!\nplenty hydr'gen.\" He pointed to the low metal roof of the trading\nstation. Though it was well insulated against sound, the place\ncontinually vibrated to the low murmur of the Inranian rains that fell\ninterminably through the perpetual polar day. It was a rain such as is\nnever seen on Earth, even in the tropics. It came in drops as large as\na man's fist. It came in streams. It came in large, shattering masses\nthat broke before they fell and filled the air with spray. There was\nlittle wind, but the steady green downpour of water and the brilliant\ncontinuous flashing of lightning shamed the dull soggy twilight\nproduced by the large, hot, but hidden sun.\n\n\"_Your_ idea of a joke!\" Forepaugh growled in disgust. He understood\nwhat Gunga's grim pleasantry referred to. There was indeed an\nincalculable quantity of hydrogen at hand. If some means could be\nfound to separate the hydrogen atoms from the oxygen in the world of\nwater around them they would not lack for fuel. He thought of\nelectrolysis, and relaxed with a sigh. There was no power. The\ngenerators were dead, the air drier and cooler had ceased its rhythmic\npulsing nearly an hour ago. Their lights were gone, and the automatic\nradio utterly useless.\n\n\"This is what comes of putting all your eggs in one basket,\" he\nthought, and let his mind dwell vindictively on the engineers who had\ndesigned the equipment on which his life depended.\n\nAn exclamation from Gunga startled him. The Martian was pointing to\nthe ventilator opening, the only part of this strange building that\nwas not hermetically sealed against the hostile life of Inra. A dark\nrim had appeared at its margin, a loathsome, black-green rim that was\nmoving, spreading out. It crept over the metal walls like the\nlow-lying smoke of a fire, yet it was a solid. From it emanated a\nstrong, miasmatic odor.\n\n\"The giant mold!\" Forepaugh cried. He rushed to his desk and took out\nhis flash pistol, quickly set the localizer so as to cover a large\narea. When he turned he saw, to his horror, Gunga about to smash into\nthe mold with his ax. He sent the man spinning with a blow to the ear.\n\n\"Want to scatter it and start it growing in a half-dozen places?\" he\nsnapped. \"Here!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe pulled the trigger. There was a light, spiteful \"ping\" and for an\ninstant a cone of white light stood out in the dim room like a solid\nthing. Then it was gone, and with it was gone the black mold, leaving\na circular area of blistered paint on the wall and an acrid odor in\nthe air. Forepaugh leaped to the ventilating louver and closed it\ntightly.\n\n\"It's going to be like this from now on,\" he remarked to the shaken\nGunga. \"All these things wouldn't bother us as long as the machinery\nkept the building dry and cool. They couldn't live in here. But it's\ngetting damp and hot. Look at the moisture condensing on the ceiling!\"\n\nGunga gave a guttural cry of despair. \"It knows, Boss; look!\"\n\nThrough one of the round, heavily framed ports it could be seen, the\nlower part of its large, shapeless body half-floating in the lashing\nwater that covered their rocky shelf to a depth of several feet, the\nupper part spectral and gray. It was a giant amoeba, fully six feet in\ndiameter in its present spheroid form, but capable of assuming any\nshape that would be useful. It had an envelope of tough, transparent\nmatter, and was filled with a fluid that was now cloudy and then\nclear. Near the center there was a mass of darker matter, and this was\nundoubtedly the seat of its intelligence.\n\nThe Earth man recoiled in horror! A single cell with a brain! It was\nunthinkable. It was a biological nightmare. Never before had he seen\none--had, in fact, dismissed the stories of the Inranian natives as a\nbit of primitive superstition, had laughed at these gentle, stupid\namphibians with whom he traded when they, in their imperfect language,\ntried to tell him of it.\n\nThey had called it the Ul-lul. Well, let it be so. It was an amoeba,\nand it was watching him. It floated in the downpour and watched him.\nWith what? It had no eyes. No matter, it was watching him. And then it\nsuddenly flowed outward until it became a disc rocking on the waves.\nAgain its fluid form changed, and by a series of elongations and\ncontractions it flowed through the water at an incredible speed. It\ncame straight for the window, struck the thick, unbreakable glass with\na shock that could be felt by the men inside. It flowed over the glass\nand over the building. It was trying to eat them, building and all!\nThe part of its body over the port became so thin that it was almost\ninvisible. At last, its absolute limit reached, it dropped away,\nbaffled, vanishing amid the glare of the lightning and the frothing\nwaters like the shadows of a nightmare.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe heat was intolerable and the air was bad.\n\n\"Haw, we have to open vent'lator, Boss!\" gasped the Martian.\n\nForepaugh nodded grimly. It wouldn't do to smother either. Though to\nopen the ventilator would be to invite another invasion by the black\nmold, not to mention the amoebae and other fabulous monsters that had\nup to now been kept at a safe distance by the repeller zone, a simple\nadaptation of a very old discovery. A zone of mechanical vibrations,\nof a frequency of 500,000 cycles per second, was created by a large\nquartz crystal in the water, which was electrically operated. Without\npower, the protective zone had vanished.\n\n\"We watch?\" asked Gunga.\n\n\"You bet we watch. Every minute of the 'day' and 'night.'\"\n\nHe examined the two chronometers, assuring himself that they were well\nwound, and congratulated himself that they were not dependent on the\ndefunct power plant for energy. They were his only means of measuring\nthe passage of time. The sun, which theoretically would seem to travel\nround and round the horizon, rarely succeeded in making its exact\nlocation known, but appeared to shift strangely from side to side at\nthe whim of the fog and water.\n\n\"Th' fellas,\" Gunga remarked, coming out of a study. \"Why not come?\"\nHe referred to the Inranians.\n\n\"Probably know something's wrong. They can tell the quartz oscillator\nis stopped. Afraid of the Ul-lul, I suppose.\"\n\n\"'Squeer,\" demurred the Martian. \"Ul-lul not bother fellas.\"\n\n\"You mean it doesn't follow them into the underbrush. But it would\nfind tough going there. Not enough water; trees there, four hundred\nfeet high with thorny roots and rough bark--they wouldn't like that.\nOh no, these natives ought to be pretty snug in their dens. Why,\nthey're as hard to catch as a muskrat! Don't know what a muskrat is,\nhuh? Well, it's the same as the Inranians, only different, and not so\nugly.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the next six days they existed in their straitened quarters, one\nguarding while the other slept, but such alarms as they experienced\nwere of a minor nature, easily disposed of by their flash pistol. It\nhad not been intended for continuous service, and under the frequent\ndrains it showed an alarming loss of power. Forepaugh repeatedly\nwarned Gunga to be more sparing in its use, but that worthy persisted\nin his practice of using it against every trifling invasion of the\npoisonous Inranian cave moss that threatened them, or the warm, soggy\nwater-spiders that hopefully explored the ventilator shaft in search\nof living food.\n\n\"Bash 'em with a broom, or something! Never mind if it isn't nice.\nSave our flash gun for something bigger.\"\n\nGunga only looked distressed.\n\nOn the seventh day their position became untenable. Some kind of sea\ncreature, hidden under the ever-replenished storm waters, had found\nthe concrete emplacements of their trading post to its liking. Just\nhow it was done was never learned. It is doubtful that the creatures\ncould gnaw away the solid stone--more likely the process was chemical,\nbut none the less it was effective. The foundations crumbled; the\nmetal shell subsided, rolled half over so that silty water leaked in\nthrough the straining seams, and threatened at any moment to be\nbuffeted and urged away on the surface of the flood toward that\ndistant vast sea which covers nine-tenths of the area of Inra.\n\n\"Time to mush for the mountains,\" Forepaugh decided.\n\nGunga grinned. The Mountains of Perdition were, to his point of view,\nthe only part of Inra even remotely inhabitable. They were sometimes\nfairly cool, and though perpetually pelted with rain, blazing with\nlightning and reverberating with thunder, they had caves that were\nfairly dry and too cool for the black mold. Sometimes, under favorable\ncircumstances on their rugged peaks, one could get the full benefit of\nthe enormous hot sun for whose actinic rays the Martian's starved\nsystem yearned.\n\n\"Better pack a few cans of the food tablets,\" the white man ordered.\n\"Take a couple of waterproof sleeping bags for us, and a few hundred\nfire pellets. You can have the flash pistol; it may have a few more\ncharges in it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nForepaugh broke the glass case marked \"Emergency Only\" and removed two\nmore flash pistols. Well he knew that he would need them after passing\nbeyond the trading area--perhaps sooner. His eyes fell on his personal\nchest, and he opened it for a brief examination. None of the contents\nseemed of any value, and he was about to pass when he dragged out a\nlong, heavy, .45 caliber six-shooter in a holster, and a cartridge\nbelt filled with shells. The Martian stared.\n\n\"Know what it is?\" his master asked, handing him the weapon.\n\n\"Gunga not know.\" He took it and examined it curiously. It was a fine\nmuseum piece in an excellent state of preservation, the metal overlaid\nwith the patina of age, but free from rust and corrosion.\n\n\"It's a weapon of the Ancients,\" Forepaugh explained. \"It was a sort\nof family heirloom and is over 300 years old. One of my grandfathers\nused it in the famous Northwest Mounted Police. Wonder if it'll still\nshoot.\"\n\nHe leveled the weapon at a fat, sightless wriggler that came squirming\nthrough a seam, squinting unaccustomed eyes along the barrel. There\nwas a violent explosion, and the wriggler disappeared in a smear of\ndirty green. Gunga nearly fell over backward in fright, and even\nForepaugh was shaken. He was surprised that the ancient cartridge had\nexploded at all, though he knew powder making had reached a high level\nof perfection before explosive chemical weapons had yielded to the\nnewer, lighter, and infinitely more powerful ray weapons. The gun\nwould impede their progress. It would be of very little use against\nthe giant Carnivora of Inra. Yet something--perhaps a sentimental\nattachment, perhaps what his ancestors would have called a\n\"hunch\"--compelled him to strap it around his waist. He carefully\npacked a few essentials in his knapsack, together with one chronometer\nand a tiny gyroscopic compass. So equipped, they could travel with a\nfair degree of precision toward the mountains some hundred miles on\nthe other side of a steaming forest, a-crawl with feral life, and hot\nwith blood-lust.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMan and master descended into the warm waters and, without a backward\nglance, left the trading post to its fate. There was not even any use\nin leaving a note. Their relief ship, soon due, would never find the\nstation without radio direction.\n\nThe current was strong, but the water gradually became shallower as\nthey ascended the sloping rock. After half an hour they saw ahead of\nthem the loom of the forest, and with some trepidation they entered\nthe gloom cast by the towering, fernlike trees, whose tops disappeared\nin murky fog. Tangled vines impeded their progress. Quagmires lay in\nwait for them, and tough weeds tripped them, sometimes throwing one or\nanother into the mud among squirming small reptiles that lashed at\nthem with spiked, poisonous feet and then fell to pieces, each piece\nto lie in the bubbling ooze until it grew again into a whole animal.\n\nSeveral times they almost walked under the bodies of great,\nspheroidal creatures with massive short legs, whose tremendously long,\nsinuous necks disappeared in the leafy murk above, swaying gently like\nlong-stalked lilies in a terrestial pond. These were azornacks,\nmild-tempered vegetarians whose only defense lay in their thick,\nblubbery hides. Filled with parasites, stinking and rancid, their\ndecaying covering of fat effectively concealed the tender flesh\nunderneath, protecting them from fangs and rending claws.\n\nDeeper in the forest the battering of the rain was mitigated. Giant\nneo-palm leaves formed a roof that shut out not only most of the weak\ndaylight, but also the fury of the downpour. The water collected in\ncataracts, ran down the boles of the trees, and roared through the\nsemi-circular canals of the snake trees, so named by early explorers\nfor their waving, rubbery tentacles, multiplied a millionfold, that\nperformed the duties of leaves. Water gurgled and chuckled everywhere,\nspread in vast dim ponds and lakes writhing with tormented roots,\nup-heaved by unseen, uncatalogued leviathans, rippled by translucent\ndiscs of loathsome, luminescent jelly that quivered from place to\nplace in pursuit of microscopic prey.\n\nYet the impression was one of calm and quiet, and the waifs from other\nworlds felt a surcease of nervous tension. Unconsciously they relaxed.\nTaking their bearings, they changed their course slightly for the\nnesting place of the nearest tribe of Inranians where they hoped to\nget food and at least partial shelter; for their food tablets had\nmysteriously turned to an unpleasant viscous liquid, and their\nsleeping bags were alive with giant bacteria easily visible to the\neye.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were doomed to disappointment. After nearly twelve hours of\ndesperate struggling through the morass, through gloomy aisles, and\ncountless narrow escapes from prowling beasts of prey in which only\nthe speed and tremendous power of their flash pistols saved them from\ninstant death, they reached a rocky outcropping which led to the\ncomparatively dry rise of land on which a tribe of Inranians made its\nhome. Their faces were covered with welts made by the hanging\nfilaments of blood-sucking trees as fine as spider webs, and their\nsenses reeled with the oppressive stench of the abysmal jungle. If the\npampered ladies of the Inner Planets only knew where their\nthousand-dollar orchids sprang from!\n\nConverging runways showed the opening of one of the underground dens,\nalmost hidden from view by a bewildering maze of roots, rendered more\nformidable by long, sharp stakes made from the iron-hard thigh-bones\nof the flying kabo.\n\nForepaugh cupped his hands over his mouth and gave the call.\n\n\"Ouf! Ouf! Ouf! Ouf! Ouf!\"\n\nHe repeated it over and over, the jungle giving back his voice in a\nmuffled echo, while Gunga held a spare flash pistol and kept a sharp\nlookout for a carnivore intent on getting an unwary Inranian.\n\nThere was no answer. These timid creatures, who are often rated the\nmost intelligent life native to primitive Inra, had sensed disaster\nand had fled.\n\nForepaugh and Gunga slept in one of the foul, poorly ventilated dens,\nate of the hard, woody tubers that had not been worth taking along,\nand wished they had a certain stock clerk at that place at that time.\nThey were awakened out of deep slumber by the threshing of an evil\nlooking creature which had become entangled among the sharpened\nspikes. Its tremendous maw, splitting it almost in half, was opened in\nroars of pain that showed great yellow fangs eight inches in length.\nIts heavy flippers battered the stout roots and lacerated themselves\nin the beast's insensate rage. It was quickly dispatched with a flash\npistol and Gunga cooked himself some of the meat, using a fire pellet;\nbut despite his hunger Forepaugh did not dare eat any of it, knowing\nthat this species, strange to him, might easily be one of the many on\nInra that are poisonous to terrestials.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey resumed their march toward the distant invisible mountains, and\nwere fortunate in finding somewhat better footing than they had on\ntheir previous march. They covered about 25 miles on that \"day,\"\nwithout untoward incident. Their ray pistols gave them an insuperable\nadvantage over the largest and most ferocious beasts they could expect\nto meet, so that they became more and more confident, despite the\nknowledge that they were rapidly using up the energy stored in their\nweapons. The first one had long ago been discarded, and the charge\nindicators of the other two were approaching zero at a disquieting\nrate. Forepaugh took them both, and from that time on he was careful\nnever to waste a discharge except in case of a direct and unavoidable\nattack. This often entailed long waits or stealthy detours through\nsucking mud, and came near to ending both their lives.\n\nThe Earth man was in the lead when it happened. Seeking an uncertain\nfooting through a tangle of low-growing, thick, ghastly white\nvegetation, he placed a foot on what seemed to be a broad, flat rock\nprojecting slightly above the ooze. Instantly there was a violent\nupheaval of mud; the seeming rock flew up like a trap-door, disclosing\na cavernous mouth some seven feet across, and a thick, triangular\ntentacle flew up from its concealment in the mud in a vicious arc.\nForepaugh leaped back barely in time to escape being swept in and\nengulfed. The end of the tentacle struck him a heavy blow on the\nchest, throwing him back with such force as to bowl Gunga over, and\nwhirling the pistols out of his hands into a slimy, bulbous growth\nnearby, where they stuck in the phosphorescent cavities the force of\ntheir impact had made.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no time to recover the weapons. With a bellow of rage the\nbeast was out of its bed and rushing at them. Nothing stayed its\nprogress. Tough, heavily scaled trees thicker than a man's body\nshuddered and fell as its bulk brushed by them. But it was momentarily\nconfused, and its first rush carried it past its dodging quarry. This\nmomentary respite saved their lives.\n\nRearing its plumed head to awesome heights, its knobby bark running\nwith brown rivulets of water, a giant tree, even for that world of\ngiants, offered refuge. The men scrambled up the rough trunk easily,\nfinding plenty of hand and footholds. They came to rest on one of the\nshelflike circumvoluting rings, some twenty-five feet above the\nground. Soon the blunt brown tentacles slithered in search of them,\nbut failed to reach their refuge by inches.\n\nAnd now began the most terrible siege that interlopers in that\nprimitive world can endure. From that cavernous, distended throat came\na tremendous, world-shaking noise.\n\n\"HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM!\"\n\nForepaugh put his hand to his head. It made him dizzy. He had not\nbelieved that such noise could be. He knew that no creature could long\nlive amidst it. He tore strips from his shredded clothing and stuffed\nhis ears, but felt no relief.\n\n\"HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM!\"\n\nIt throbbed in his brain.\n\nGunga lay a-sprawl, staring with fascinated eye into the pulsating\nscarlet gullet that was blasting the world with sound. Slowly, slowly\nhe was slipping. His master hauled him back. The Martian grinned at\nhim stupidly, slid again to the edge.\n\nOnce more Forepaugh pulled him back. The Martian seemed to acquiesce.\nHis single eye closed to a mere slit. He moved to a position between\nForepaugh and the tree trunk, braced his feet.\n\n\"No you don't!\" The Earth man laughed uproariously. The din was making\nhim light-headed. It was so funny! Just in time he had caught that\ncunning expression and prepared for the outlashing of feet designed to\nplunge him into the red cavern below and to stop that hellish racket.\n\n\"And now--\"\n\nHe swung his fist heavily, slamming the Martian against the tree. The\nred eye closed wearily. He was unconscious, and lucky.\n\nHungrily the Earth man stared at his distant flash pistols, plainly\nvisible in the luminescence of their fungus bedding. He began a slow,\ncautious creep along the top of a vine some eight inches thick. If he\ncould reach them....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCrash! He was almost knocked to the ground by the thud of a frantic\ntentacle against the vine. His movement had been seen. Again the\ntentacle struck with crushing force. The great vine swayed. He managed\nto reach the shelf again in the very nick of time.\n\n\"HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM!\"\n\nA bolt of lightning struck a giant fern some distance away. The crash\nof thunder was hardly noticeable. Forepaugh wondered if his tree would\nbe struck. Perhaps it might even start a fire, giving him a flaming\nbrand with which to torment his tormentor. Vain hope! The wood was\nsaturated with moisture. Even the fire pellets could not make it burn.\n\n\"HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM!\"\n\nThe six-shooter! He had forgotten it. He jerked it from its holster\nand pointed it at the red throat, emptied all the chambers. He saw the\nflash of yellow flame, felt the recoil, but the sound of the\ndischarges was drowned in the Brobdignagian tumult. He drew back his\narm to throw the useless toy from him. But again that unexplainable,\nsenseless \"hunch\" restrained him. He reloaded the gun and returned it\nto its holster.\n\n\"HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM! HOOM!\"\n\nA thought had been struggling to reach his consciousness against the\npressure of the unbearable noise. The fire pellets! Couldn't they be\nused in some way? These small chemical spheres, no larger than the end\nof his little finger, had long ago supplanted actual fire along the\nfrontiers, where electricity was not available for cooking. In contact\nwith moisture they emitted terrific heat, a radiant heat which\npenetrated meat, bone, and even metal. One such pellet would cook a\nmeal in ten minutes, with no sign of scorching or burning. And they\nhad several hundred in one of the standard moisture-proof containers.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs fast as his fingers could work the trigger of the dispenser\nForepaugh dropped the potent little pellets down the bellowing throat.\nHe managed to release about thirty before the bellowing stopped. A\nveritable tornado of energy broke loose at the foot of the tree. The\ngiant maw was closed, and the shocking silence was broken only by the\nthrashing of a giant body in its death agonies. The radiant heat,\npenetrating through and through the beast's body, withered nearby\nvegetation and could be easily felt on the perch up the tree.\n\nGunga was slowly recovering. His iron constitution helped him to rally\nfrom the powerful blow he had received, and by the time the jungle was\nstill he was sitting up mumbling apologies.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said his master. \"Shin down there and cut us off a good\nhelping of roast tongue, if it has a tongue, before something else\ncomes along and beats us out of a feast.\"\n\n\"Him poison, maybe,\" Gunga demurred. They had killed a specimen new to\nzoologists.\n\n\"Might as well die of poison as starvation,\" Forepaugh countered.\n\nWithout more ado the Martian descended, cut out some large, juicy\nchunks as his fancy dictated, and brought his loot back up the tree.\nThe meat was delicious and apparently wholesome. They gorged\nthemselves and threw away what they could not eat, for food spoils\nvery quickly in the Inranian jungles and uneaten meat would only serve\nto attract hordes of the gauzy-winged, glutinous Inranian swamp flies.\nAs they sank into slumber they could hear the beginning of a bedlam of\nsnarling and fighting as the lesser Carnivora fed on the body of the\nfallen giant.\n\nWhen they awoke the chronometer recorded the passing of twelve hours,\nand they had to tear a network of strong fibers with which the tree\nhad invested them preparatory to absorbing their bodies as food. For\nso keen is the competition for life on Inra that practically all\nvegetation is capable of absorbing animal food directly. Many an\nInranian explorer can tell tales of narrow escapes from some of the\nmore specialized flesh-eating plants; but they are now so well known\nthat they are easily avoided.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA clean-picked framework of crushed and broken giant bones was all\nthat was left of the late bellowing monster. Six-legged water dogs\nwere polishing them hopefully, or delving into them with their long,\nsinuous snouts for the marrow. The Earth man fired a few shots with\nhis six-shooter, and they scattered, dragging the bodies of their\nfallen companions to a safe distance to be eaten.\n\nOnly one of the flash pistols was in working order. The other had been\ntrampled by heavy hoofs and was useless. A heavy handicap under which\nto traverse fifty miles of abysmal jungle. They started with nothing\nfor breakfast except water, of which they had plenty.\n\nFortunately the outcroppings of rocks and gravel washes were becoming\nmore and more frequent, and they were able to travel at much better\nspeed. As they left the low-lying jungle land they entered a zone\nwhich was faintly reminiscent of a terrestial jungle. It was still\nhot, soggy, and fetid, but gradually the most primitive aspects of the\nscene were modified. The over-arching trees were less closely packed,\nand they came across occasional rock clearings which were bare of\nvegetation except for a dense carpet of brown, lichenlike vegetation\nthat secreted an astonishing amount of juice. They slipped and sloshed\nthrough this, rousing swarms of odd, toothed birds, which darted\nangrily around their heads and slashed at them with the razor-sharp\nsaw edges on the back of their legs. Annoying as they were, they could\nbe kept away with branches torn from trees, and their presence\nconnoted an absence of the deadly jungle flesh-eaters, permitting a\ntemporary relaxation of vigilance and saving the resources of the last\nflash gun.\n\nThey camped that \"night\" on the edge of one of these rock clearings.\nFor the first time in weeks it had stopped raining, although the sun\nwas still obscured. Dimly on the horizon could be seen the first of\nthe foothills. Here they gathered some of the giant, oblong fungus\nthat early explorers had taken for blocks of porous stone because of\ntheir size and weight, and, by dint of the plentiful application of\nfire pellets, managed to set it ablaze. The heat added nothing to\ntheir comfort, but it dried them out and allowed them to sleep\nunmolested.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn unwary winged eel served as their breakfast, and soon they were on\ntheir way to those beckoning hills. It had started to rain again, but\nthe worst part of their journey was over. If they could reach the top\nof one of the mountains there was a good chance that they would be\nseen and rescued by their relief ship, provided they did not starve\nfirst. The flyer would use the mountains as a base from which to\nsearch for the trading station, and it was conceivable that the\nskipper might actually have anticipated their desperate adventure and\nwould look for them in the Mountains of Perdition.\n\nThey had crossed several ranges of the foothills and were beginning to\ncongratulate themselves when the diffused light from above was\nsuddenly blotted out. It was raining again, and above the\necho-augmented thunder they heard a shrill screeching.\n\n\"A web serpent!\" Gunga cried, throwing himself flat on the ground.\n\nForepaugh eased into a rock cleft at his side. Just in time. A great\ngrotesque head bore down upon him, many-fanged as a medieval dragon.\nBetween obsidian eyes was a fissure whence emanated a wailing and a\nfoul odor. Hundreds of short, clawed legs slithered on the rocks under\na long sinuous body. Then it seemed to leap into the air again. Webs\ngrew taut between the legs, strumming as they caught a strong uphill\nwind. Again it turned to the attack, and missed them. This time\nForepaugh was ready for it. He shot at it with his flash pistol.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNothing happened. The fog made accurate shooting impossible, and the\ngun lacked its former power. The web serpent continued to course back\nand forth over their heads.\n\n\"Guess we'd better run for it,\" Forepaugh murmured.\n\n\"Go 'head!\"\n\nThey cautiously left their places of concealment. Instantly the\nserpent was down again, persistent if inaccurate. It struck the place\nof their first concealment and missed them.\n\n\"Run!\"\n\nThey extended their weary muscles to the utmost, but it was soon\napparent that they could not escape long. A rock wall in their path\nsaved them.\n\n\"Hole!\" the Martian gasped.\n\nForepaugh followed him into the rocky cleft. There was a strong draft\nof dry air, and it would have been next to impossible to hold the\nMartian back, so Forepaugh allowed him to lead on toward the source of\nthe draft. As long as it led into the mountains he didn't care.\n\nThe natural passageway was untenanted. Evidently its coolness and\ndryness made it untenable for most of Inra's humidity and heat loving\nlife. Yet the floor was so smooth that it must have been artificially\nleveled. Faint illumination was provided by the rocks themselves. They\nappeared to be covered by some microscopic phosphorescent vegetation.\n\nAfter hundreds of twists and turns and interminable straight galleries\nthe cleft turned more sharply upward, and they had a period of stiff\nclimbing. They must have gone several miles and climbed at least\n20,000 feet. The air became noticeably thin, which only exhilarated\nGunga, but slowed the Earth man down. But at last they came to the end\nof the cleft. They could go no further, but above them, at least 500\nfeet higher, they saw a round patch of sky, miraculously bright blue\nsky!\n\n\"A pipe!\" Forepaugh cried.\n\nHe had often heard of these mysterious, almost fabulous structures\nsometimes reported by passing travelers. Straight and true, smooth as\nglass and apparently immune to the elements, they had been\noccasionally seen standing on the very tops of the highest\nmountains--seen for a few moments only before they were hidden again\nby the clouds. Were they observatories of some ancient race, placed\nthus to pierce the mysteries of outer space? They would find out.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe inside of the pipe had zigzagging rings of metal, conveniently\nspaced for easy climbing. With Gunga leading, they soon reached the\ntop. But not quite.\n\n\"Eh?\" said Forepaugh.\n\n\"Uh?\" said Gunga.\n\nThere had not been a sound, but a distinct, definite command had\nregistered on their minds.\n\n\"Stop!\"\n\nThey tried to climb higher, but could not unclasp their hands. They\ntried to descend, but could not lower their feet.\n\nThe light was by now relatively bright, and as by command their eyes\nsought the opposite wall. What they saw gave their jaded nerves an\nunpleasant thrill--a mass of doughy matter of a blue-green color about\nthree feet in diameter, with something that resembled a cyst filled\nwith transparent liquid near its center.\n\nAnd this thing began to flow along the rods, much as tar flows. From\nthe mass extended a pseudopod; touched Gunga on the arm. Instantly the\narm was raw and bleeding. Terrified, immovable, he writhed in agony.\nThe pseudopod returned to the main mass, disappearing into its\ninterior with the strip of bloody skin.\n\nIts attention was centered so much on the luckless Martian that its\ncontrol slipped from Forepaugh. Seizing his flash pistol, he set the\nlocalized for a small area and aimed it at the thing, intent on\nburning it into nothingness. But again his hand was stayed. Against\nthe utmost of his will-power his fingers opened, letting the pistol\ndrop. The liquid in the cyst danced and bubbled. Was it laughing at\nhim? It had read his mind--thwarted his will again.\n\nAgain a pseudopod stretched out and a strip of raw, red flesh adhered\nto it and was consumed. Mad rage convulsed the Earth man. Should he\nthrow himself tooth and nail on the monster? And be engulfed?\n\nHe thought of the six-shooter. It thrilled him.\n\nBut wouldn't it make him drop that too?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA flash of atavistic cunning came to him.\n\nHe began to reiterate in his mind a certain thought.\n\n\"This thing is so I can see you better--this thing is so I can see you\nbetter.\"\n\nHe said it over and over, with all the passion and devotion of a\ncelibate's prayer over a uranium fountain.\n\n\"This thing is harmless--but it will make me see you better!\"\n\nSlowly he drew the six-shooter. In some occult way he knew it was\nwatching him.\n\n\"Oh, this is harmless! This is an instrument to aid my weak eyes! It\nwill help me realize your mastery! This will enable me to know your\ntrue greatness. This will enable me to know you as a god.\"\n\nWas it complacence or suspicion that stirred the liquid in the cyst so\nsmoothly? Was it susceptible to flattery? He sighted along the barrel.\n\n\"In another moment your great intelligence will overwhelm me,\"\nproclaimed his surface mind desperately, while the subconscious tensed\nthe trigger. And at that the clear liquid burst into a turmoil of\nalarm. Too late. Forepaugh went limp, but not before he had loosed a\nsteel-jacketed bullet that shattered the mind cyst of the pipe\ndenizen. A horrible pain coursed through his every fibre and nerve. He\nwas safe in the arms of Gunga, being carried to the top of the pipe to\nthe clean dry air, and the blessed, blistering sun.\n\nThe pipe denizen was dying. A viscous, inert mass, it dropped lower\nand lower, lost contact at last, shattered into slime at the bottom.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMiraculous sun! For a luxurious fifteen minutes they roasted there on\nthe top of the pipe, the only solid thing in a sea of clouds as far as\nthe eye could reach. But no! That was a circular spot against the\nbrilliant white of the clouds, and it was rapidly coming closer. In a\nfew minutes it resolved itself into the _Comet_, fast relief ship of\nthe Terrestial, Inranian, Genidian, and Zydian Lines, Inc. With a low\nbuzz of her repulsion motors she drew alongside. Hooks were attached\nand ports opened. A petty officer and a crew of roustabouts made her\nfast.\n\n\"What the hell's going on here?\" asked the cocky little terrestial who\nwas skipper, stepping out and surveying the castaways. \"We've been\nlooking for you ever since your directional wave failed. But come on\nin--come on in!\"\n\nHe led the way to his stateroom, while the ship's surgeon took Gunga\nin charge. Closing the door carefully, he delved into the bottom of\nhis locker and brought out a flask.\n\n\"Can't be too careful,\" he remarked, filling a small tumbler for\nhimself and another for his guest. \"Always apt to be some snooper to\nreport me. But say--you're wanted in the radio room.\"\n\n\"Radio room nothing! When do we eat?\"\n\n\"Right away, but you'd better see him. Fellow from the Interplanetary\nNews Agency wants you to broadcast a copyrighted story. Good for about\nthree years' salary, old boy.\"\n\n\"All right. I'll see him\"--with a happy sigh--\"just as soon as I put\nthrough a personal message.\"\n\n[Advertisement: Everyone Is Invited\n_To \"Come Over in_\n'THE READERS' CORNER'!\"]\n\n\n\n\nThe Lord of Space\n\n_By Victor Rousseau_\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Sidenote: A Black Caesar had arisen on Eros--and all Earth trembled\nat his distant menace.]\n\n\n\"On the day of the next full moon every living thing on earth will be\nwiped out of existence--unless you succeed in your mission, Lee.\"\n\nNathaniel Lee looked into the face of Silas Stark, President of the\nUnited States of the World, and nodded grimly. \"I'll do my best, Sir,\"\nhe answered.\n\n\"You have the facts. We know who this self-styled Black Caesar is, who\nhas declared war upon humanity. He is a Dane named Axelson, whose\nfather, condemned to life imprisonment for resisting the new\nworld-order, succeeded in obtaining possession of an interplanetary\nliner.\n\n\"He filled it with the gang of desperate men who had been associated\nwith him in his successful escape from the penitentiary. Together they\nsailed into Space. They disappeared. It was supposed that they had\nsomehow met their death in the ether, beyond the range of human ken.\n\n\"Thirty years passed, and then this son of Axelson, born, according to\nhis own story, of a woman whom the father had persuaded to accompany\nhim into Space, began to radio us. We thought at first it was some\npractical joker who was cutting in.\n\n[Illustration: _It was like struggling with some vampire creatures in\na hideous dream._]\n\n\"When our electricians demonstrated beyond doubt that the voice came\nfrom outer space, it was supposed that some one in our Moon Colony had\nacquired a transmitting machine. Then the ships we sent to the Moon\nColony for gold failed to return. As you know, for seven weeks there\nhas been no communication with the Moon. And at the last full moon\nthe--blow--fell.\n\n\"The world depends upon you, Lee. The invisible rays that destroyed\nevery living thing from China to Australia--one-fifth of the human\nrace--will fall upon the eastern seaboard of America when the moon is\nfull again. That has been the gist of Axelson's repeated\ncommunications.\n\n\"We shall look to you to return, either with the arch-enemy of the\nhuman race as your prisoner, or with the good news that mankind has\nbeen set free from the menace that overhangs it.\n\n\"God bless you, my boy!\" The President of the United States of the\nWorld gripped Nat's hand and stepped down the ladder that led from the\nlanding-stage of the great interplanetary space-ship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe immense landing-field reserved for the ships of the Interplanetary\nLine was situated a thousand feet above the heart of New York City, in\nWestchester County. It was a flat space set on the top of five great\ntowers, strewn with electrified sand, whose glow had the property of\ndispersing the sea fogs. There, at rest upon what resembled nothing so\nmuch as iron claws, the long gray shape of the vacuum flyer bulked.\n\nNat sneezed as he watched the operations of his men, for the common\ncold, or coryza, seemed likely to be the last of the germ diseases\nthat would yield to medical science, and he had caught a bad one in\nthe Capitol, while listening to the debate in the Senate upon the\nthreat to humanity. And it was cold on the landing-stage, in contrast\nto the perpetual summer of the glass-roofed city below.\n\nBut Nat forgot the cold as he watched the preparations for the ship's\ndeparture. Neon and nitrogen gas were being pumped under pressure into\nthe outer shell, where a minute charge of leucon, the newly discovered\nelement that helped to counteract gravitation, combined with them to\nprovide the power that would lift the vessel above the regions of the\nstratosphere.\n\nIn the low roof-buildings that surrounded the stage was a scene of\ntremendous activity. The selenium discs were flashing signals, and the\nradio receivers were shouting the late news; on the great power boards\ndials and light signals stood out in the glow of the amylite tubes. On\na rotary stage a thousand feet above the ship a giant searchlight,\nvisible for a thousand miles, moved its shaft of dazzling luminosity\nacross the heavens.\n\nNow the spar-aluminite outer skin of the ship grew bright with the red\nneon glare. Another ship, from China, dropped slowly to its stage near\nby, and the unloaders swarmed about the pneumatic tubes to receive the\nmail. The teleradio was shouting news of a failure of the Manchurian\nwheat crop. Nat's chief officer, a short cockney named Brent, came up\nto him.\n\n\"Ready to start, Sir,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNat turned to him. \"Your orders are clear?\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir.\"\n\n\"Send Benson here.\"\n\n\"I'm here, Sir.\" Benson, the ray-gunner in charge of the battery that\ncomprised the vessel's armament, a lean Yankee from Connecticut,\nstepped forward.\n\n\"You know your orders, Benson? Axelson has seized the Moon and the\ngold-mines there. He's planning to obliterate the Earth. We've got to\ngo in like mad dogs and shoot to kill. No matter if we kill every\nliving thing there, even our own people who are inmates of the Moon's\npenal settlement, we've got to account for Axelson.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir.\"\n\n\"We can't guess how he got those gold-ships that returned with neon\nand argon for the Moon colonists. But he mustn't get us. Let the men\nunderstand that. That's all.\"\n\n\"Very good, Sir.\"\n\nThe teleradio suddenly began to splutter: A-A-A, it called. And\ninstantly every sound ceased about the landing-stage. For that was the\ncall of Axelson, somewhere upon the Moon.\n\n\"Axelson speaking. At the next full moon all the American Province of\nthe World Federation will be annihilated, as the Chinese Province was\nat the last. There's no hope for you, good people. Send out your\nvacuum liners. I can use a few more of them. Within six months your\nworld will be depopulated, unless you flash me the signal of\nsurrender.\"\n\nWould the proud old Earth have to come to that? Daily those ominous\nthreats had been repeated, until popular fears had become frenzy. And\nNat was being sent out as a last hope. If he failed, there would be\nnothing but surrender to this man, armed with a super-force that\nenabled him to lay waste the Earth from the Moon.\n\nWithin one hour, those invisible, death-dealing rays had destroyed\neverything that inhaled oxygen and exhaled carbon. The ray with which\nthe liner was equipped was a mere toy in comparison. It would kill at\nno more than 500 miles, and its action was quite different.\n\nAs a prelude to Earth's surrender, Axelson demanded that World\nPresident Stark and a score of other dignitaries should depart for\nthe Moon as hostages. Every ray fortress in the world was to be\ndismantled, every treasury was to send its gold to be piled up in a\ngreat pyramid on the New York landing-stage. The Earth was to\nacknowledge Axelson as its supreme master.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe iron claws were turning with a screwlike motion, extending\nthemselves, and slowly raising the interplanetary vessel until she\nlooked like a great metal fish with metal legs ending with suckerlike\ndisks. But already she was floating free as the softly purring engines\nheld her in equipoise. Nat climbed the short ladder that led to her\ndeck. Brent came up to him again.\n\n\"That teleradio message from Axelson--\" he began.\n\n\"Yes?\" Nat snapped out.\n\n\"I don't believe it came from the Moon at all.\"\n\n\"You don't? You think it's somebody playing a hoax on Earth? You think\nthat wiping out of China was just an Earth-joke?\"\n\n\"No, Sir.\" Brent stood steady under his superior's sarcasm. \"But I was\nchief teleradio operator at Greenwich before being promoted to the\nProvince of America. And what they don't know at Greenwich they don't\nknow anywhere.\"\n\nBrent spoke with that self-assurance of the born cockney that even the\ncenturies had failed to remove, though they had removed the cockney\naccent.\n\n\"Well, Brent?\"\n\n\"I was with the chief electrician in the receiving station when\nAxelson was radioing last week. And I noticed that the waves of sound\nwere under a slight Doppler effect. With the immense magnification\nnecessary for transmitting from the Moon, such deflection might be\nconstrued as a mere fan-like extension. But there was ten times the\nmagnification one would expect from the Moon; and I calculated that\nthose sound-waves were shifted somewhere.\"\n\n\"Then what's your theory, Brent?\"\n\n\"Those sounds come from another planet. Somewhere on the Moon there's\nan intercepting and re-transmitting plant. Axelson is deflecting his\nrays to give the impression that he's on the Moon, and to lure our\nships there.\"\n\n\"What do you advise?\" asked Nat.\n\n\"I don't know, Sir.\"\n\n\"Neither do I. Set your course Moonward, and tell Mr. Benson to keep\nhis eyes peeled.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Moon Colony, discovered in 1976, when Kramer, of Baltimore, first\nproved the practicability of mixing neon with the inert new gas,\nleucon, and so conquering gravitation, had proved to be just what it\nhad been suspected of being--a desiccated, airless desolation.\nNevertheless, within the depths of the craters a certain amount of the\nMoon's ancient atmosphere still lingered, sufficient to sustain life\nfor the queer troglodytes, with enormous lung-boxes, who survived\nthere, browsing like beasts upon the stunted, aloe-like vegetation.\n\nHalf man, half ape, and very much unlike either, these vestiges of a\nspecies on a ruined globe had proved tractable and amenable to\ndiscipline. They had become the laborers of the convict settlement\nthat had sprung up on the Moon.\n\nThither all those who had opposed the establishment of the World\nFederation, together with all persons convicted for the fourth time of\na felony, had been transported, to superintend the efforts of these\ndumb, unhuman Moon dwellers. For it had been discovered that the Moon\ncraters were extraordinarily rich in gold, and gold was still the\nmedium of exchange on Earth.\n\nTo supplement the vestigial atmosphere, huge stations had been set up,\nwhich extracted the oxygen from the subterranean waters five miles\nbelow the Moon's crust, and recombined it with the nitrogen with\nwhich the surface layer was impregnated, thus creating an atmosphere\nwhich was pumped to the workers.\n\nThen a curious discovery had been made. It was impossible for human\nbeings to exist without the addition of those elements existing in the\nair in minute quantities--neon, krypton, and argon. And the ships that\nbrought the gold bars back from the Moon had conveyed these gaseous\nelements there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe droning of the sixteen atomic motors grew louder, and mingled with\nthe hum of gyroscopes. The ladder was drawn up and the port hole\nsealed. On the enclosed bridge Nat threw the switch of durobronze that\nreleased the non-conducting shutter which gave play to the sixteen\ngreat magnets. Swiftly the great ship shot forward into the air. The\ndroning of the motors became a shrill whine, and then, growing too\nshrill for human ears to follow it, gave place to silence.\n\nNat set the speed lever to five hundred miles an hour, the utmost that\nhad been found possible in passing through the earth's atmosphere,\nowing to the resistance, which tended to heat the vessel and damage\nthe delicate atomic engines. As soon as the ether was reached, the\nspeed would be increased to ten or twelve thousand. That meant a\ntwenty-two hour run to the Moon Colony--about the time usually taken.\n\nHe pressed a lever, which set bells ringing in all parts of the ship.\nBy means of a complicated mechanism, the air was exhausted from each\ncompartment in turn, and then replaced, and as the bells rang, the men\nat work trooped out of these compartments consecutively. This had been\noriginated for the purpose of destroying any life dangerous to man\nthat might unwittingly have been imported from the Moon, but on one\noccasion it had resulted in the discovery of a stowaway.\n\nThen Nat descended the bridge to the upper deck. Here, on a platform,\nwere the two batteries of three ray-guns apiece, mounted on swivels,\nand firing in any direction on the port and starboard sides\nrespectively. The guns were enclosed in a thin sheath of osmium,\nthrough which the lethal rays penetrated unchanged; about them, thick\nshields of lead protected the gunners.\n\nHe talked with Benson for a while. \"Don't let Axelson get the jump on\nyou,\" he said. \"Be on the alert every moment.\" The gunners,\nkeen-looking men, graduates from the Annapolis gunnery school, grinned\nand nodded. They were proud of their trade and its traditions; Nat\nfelt that the vessel was safe in their hands.\n\nThe chief mate appeared at the head of the companion, accompanied by a\ngirl. \"Stowaway, Sir,\" he reported laconically. \"She tumbled out of\nthe repair shop annex when we let out the air!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNat stared at her in consternation, and the girl stared back at him.\nShe was a very pretty girl, hardly more than twenty-two or three,\nattired in a businesslike costume consisting of a leather jacket,\nknickers, and the black spiral puttees that had come into style in the\npast decade. She came forward unabashed.\n\n\"Well, who are you?\" snapped Nat.\n\n\"Madge Dawes, of the Universal News Syndicate,\" she answered,\nlaughing.\n\n\"The devil!\" muttered Nat. \"You people think you run the World\nFederation since you got President Stark elected.\"\n\n\"We certainly do,\" replied the girl, still laughing.\n\n\"Well, you don't run this ship,\" said Nat. \"How would you like a long\nparachute drop back to Earth?\"\n\n\"Don't be foolish, my dear man,\" said Madge. \"Don't you know you'll\nget wrinkles if you scowl like that? Smile! Ah, that's better. Now,\nhonestly, Cap we just had to get the jump on everybody else in\ninterviewing Axelson. It means such a lot to me.\"\n\nPouts succeeded smiles. \"You're not going to be cross about it, are\nyou?\" she pleaded.\n\n\"Do you realize the risk you're running, young woman?\" Nat demanded.\n\"Are you aware that our chances of ever getting back to Earth are\nsmaller than you ought to have dreamed of taking?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" the girl responded. \"And now that we're\nfriends again, would you mind asking the steward to get me something\nto eat? I've been cooped up in that room downstairs for fifteen hours,\nand I'm simply starving.\"\n\nNat shrugged his shoulders hopelessly. He turned to the chief mate.\n\"Take Miss Dawes down to the saloon and see that Wang Ling supplies\nher with a good meal,\" he ordered. \"And put her in the Admiral's\ncabin. That good enough for you?\" he asked satirically.\n\n\"Oh that'll be fine,\" answered the girl enthusiastically. \"And I shall\nrely on you to keep me posted about everything that's going on. And a\nlittle later I'm going to take X-ray photographs of you and all these\nmen.\" She smiled at the grinning gunners. \"That's the new fad, you\nknow, and we're going to offer prizes for the best developed skeletons\nin the American Province, and pick a King and Queen of Beauty!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"A radio, Sir!\"\n\nNat, who had snatched a brief interval of sleep, started up as the man\non duty handed him the message. The vessel had been constantly in\ncommunication with Earth during her voyage, now nearing completion,\nbut the dreaded A-A-A that prefaced this message told Nat that it came\nfrom Axelson.\n\n\"Congratulations on your attempt,\" the message ran, \"I have watched\nyour career with the greatest interest, Lee, through the medium of\nsuch scraps of information as I have been able to pick up on the\nMoon. When you are my guest to-morrow I shall hope to be able to offer\nyou a high post in the new World Government that I am planning to\nestablish. I need good men. Fraternally, the Black Caesar.\"\n\nNat whirled about. Madge Dawes was standing behind him, trying to read\nthe message over his shoulder.\n\n\"Spying, eh?\" said Nat bitterly.\n\n\"My dear man, isn't that my business?\"\n\n\"Well, read this, then,\" said Nat, handing her the message. \"You're\nlikely to repent this crazy trick of yours before we get much\nfarther.\"\n\nAnd he pointed to the cosmic-ray skiagraph of the Moon on the curved\nglass dome overhead. They were approaching the satellite rapidly. It\nfilled the whole dome, the craters great black hollows, the mountains\nstanding out clearly. Beneath the dome were the radium apparatus that\nemitted the rays by which the satellite was photographed\ncinematographically, and the gyroscope steering apparatus by which the\nship's course was directed.\n\nSuddenly a buzzer sounded a warning. Nat sprang to the tube.\n\n\"Gravitational interference X40, gyroscopic aberrancy one minute 29,\"\nhe called. \"Discharge static electricity from hull. Mr. Benson, stand\nby.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\" asked Madge.\n\n\"It means I shall be obliged if you'll abstain from speaking to the\nman at the controls,\" snapped Nat.\n\n\"And what's that?\" cried Madge in a shriller voice, pointing upward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAcross the patterned surface of the Moon, shown on the skiagraph, a\nblack, cigar-shaped form was passing. It looked like one of the\nold-fashioned dirigibles, and the speed with which it moved was\nevident from the fact that it was perceptibly traversing the Moon's\nsurface. Perhaps it was travelling at the rate of fifty thousand miles\nan hour.\n\nBrent, the chief officer, burst up the companion. His face was livid.\n\n\"Black ship approaching us from the Moon, Sir,\" he stammered.\n\"Benson's training his guns, but it must be twenty thousands miles\naway.\"\n\n\"Yes, even our ray-guns won't shoot that distance,\" answered Nat.\n\"Tell Benson to keep his guns trained as well as he can, and open fire\nat five hundred.\"\n\nBrent disappeared. Madge and Nat were alone on the bridge. Nat was\nshouting incomprehensible orders down the tube. He stopped and looked\nup. The shadow of the approaching ship had crossed the Moon's disk and\ndisappeared.\n\n\"Well, young lady, I think your goose is cooked,\" said Nat. \"If I'm\nnot mistaken, that ship is Axelson's, and he's on his way to knock us\ngalley-west. And now oblige me by leaving the bridge.\"\n\n\"I think he's a perfectly delightful character, to judge from that\nmessage he sent you,\" answered Madge, \"and--\"\n\nBrent appeared again. \"Triangulation shows ten thousand miles, Sir,\"\nhe informed Nat.\n\n\"Take control,\" said Nat. \"Keep on the gyroscopic course, allowing for\naberrancy, and make for the Crater of Pytho. I'll take command of the\nguns.\" He hurried down the companion, with Madge at his heels.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe gunners stood by the ray-guns, three at each. Benson perched on a\nrevolving stool above the batteries. He was watching a periscopic\ninstrument that connected with the bridge dome by means of a tube, a\nflat mirror in front of him showing all points of the compass. At one\nedge the shadow of the black ship was creeping slowly forward.\n\n\"Eight thousand miles, Sir,\" he told Nat. \"One thousand is our extreme\nrange. And it looks as if she's making for our blind spot overhead.\"\n\nNat stepped to the speaking-tube. \"Try to ram her,\" he called up to\nBrent. \"We'll open with all guns, pointing forward.\"\n\n\"Very good, Sir,\" the Cockney called back.\n\nThe black shadow was now nearly in the centre of the mirror. It moved\nupward, vanished. Suddenly the atomic motors began wheezing again. The\nwheeze became a whine, a drone.\n\n\"We've dropped to two thousand miles an hour, Sir,\" called Brent.\n\nNat leaped for the companion. As he reached the top he could hear the\nteleradio apparatus in the wireless room overhead begin to chatter:\n\n\"A-A-A. Don't try to interfere. Am taking you to the Crater of Pytho.\nShall renew my offer there. Any resistance will be fatal. Axelson.\"\n\nAnd suddenly the droning of the motors became a whine again, then\nsilence. Nat stared at the instrument-board and uttered a cry.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" demanded Madge.\n\nNat swung upon her. \"The matter?\" he bawled. \"He's neutralized our\nengines by some infernal means of his own, and he's towing us to the\nMoon!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe huge sphere of the Moon had long since covered the entire dome.\nThe huge Crater of Pytho now filled it, a black hollow fifty miles\nacross, into which they were gradually settling. And, as they settled,\nthe pale Earth light, white as that of the Moon on Earth, showed the\ngaunt masses of bare rock, on which nothing grew, and the long\nstalactites of glassy lava that hung from them.\n\nThen out of the depths beneath emerged the shadowy shape of the\nlanding-stage.\n\n\"You are about to land,\" chattered the radio. \"Don't try any tricks;\nthey will be useless. Above all, don't try to use your puny ray. You\nare helpless.\"\n\nThe ship was almost stationary. Little figures could be seen swarming\nupon the landing-stage, ready to adjust the iron claws to clamp the\nhull. With a gesture of helplessness, Nat left the bridge and went\ndown to the main deck where, in obedience to his orders, the crew had\nall assembled.\n\n\"Men, I'm putting it up to you,\" he said. \"Axelson, the Black Caesar,\nadvises us not to attempt to use the Ray-guns. I won't order you to.\nI'll leave the decision with you.\"\n\n\"We tried it fifteen minutes ago, Sir,\" answered Benson. \"I told\nLarrigan to fire off the stern starboard gun to see if it was in\nworking order, and it wasn't!\"\n\nAt that moment the vessel settled with a slight jar into the clamps.\nOnce more the teleradio began to scream:\n\n\"Open the port hold and file out slowly. Resistance is useless. I\nshould turn my ray upon you and obliterate you immediately. Assemble\non the landing-stage and wait for me!\"\n\n\"You'd best obey,\" Nat told his men. \"We've got a passenger to\nconsider.\" He glared at Madge as he spoke, and Madge's smile was a\nlittle more tremulous than it had been before.\n\n\"This is the most thrilling experience of my life, Captain Lee,\" she\nsaid. \"And I'll never rest until I've got an X-Ray photograph of Mr.\nAxelson's skeleton for the Universal News Syndicate.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne by one, Nat last, the crew filed down the ladder onto the\nlanding-stage, gasping and choking in the rarefied air that lay like a\nblanket at the bottom of the crater. And the reason for this was only\ntoo apparent to Nat as soon as he was on the level stage.\n\nOverhead, at an altitude of about a mile, the black ship hung, and\nfrom its bow a stupendous searchlight played to and fro over the\nbottom of the crater, making it as light as day. And where had been\nthe mining machinery, the great buildings that had housed convicts and\nMoon people, and the huge edifice that contained the pumping station,\nthere was--nothing.\n\nThe devilish ray of Axelson had not merely destroyed them, it had\nobliterated all traces of them, and the crew of the liner were\nbreathing the remnants of the atmosphere that still lay at the bottom\nof the Crater of Pytho.\n\nBut beside the twin landing-stages, constructed by the World\nFederation, another building arose, with an open front. And that front\nwas a huge mirror, now scintillating under the searchlight from the\nblack ship.\n\n\"That's it, Sir!\" shouted Brent.\n\n\"That's what?\" snapped Nat.\n\n\"The deflecting mirror I was speaking of. That's what deflected the\nray that wiped out China. The ray didn't come from the Moon. And\nthat's the mirror that deflects the teleradio waves, the\nsuper-Hertzian rays that carry the sound.\"\n\nNat did not answer. Sick at heart at the failure of his mission, he\nwas watching the swarm of Moon men who were at work upon the\nlanding-stage, turning the steel clamps and regulating the mechanism\nthat controlled the apparatus. Dwarfed, apish creature, with tiny\nlimbs, and chests that stood out like barrels, they bustled about,\nchattering in shrill voices that seemed like the piping of birds.\n\nIt was evident that Axelson, though he had wiped out the Moon convicts\nand the Moon people in the crater, had reserved a number of the latter\nfor personal use.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe black ship was dropping into its position at the second\nlanding-stage, connected with the first by a short bridge. The\nstarboard hold swung open, and a file of shrouded and hooded forms\nappeared, masked men, breathing in condensed air from receptacles upon\ntheir chests, and staring with goggle eyes at their captives. Each one\nheld in his hand a lethal tube containing the ray, and, as if by\ncommand, they took up their stations about their prisoners.\n\nThen, at a signal from their leader, they suddenly doffed their masks.\n\nNat looked at them in astonishment. He had not known whether these\nwould be Earth denizens or inhabitants of some other planet. But they\nwere Earth men. And they were old.\n\nMen of sixty or seventy, years, with long, gray beards and wrinkled\nfaces, and eyes that stared out from beneath penthouses of shaggy\neyebrows. Faces on which were imprinted despair and hopelessness.\n\nThen the first man took off his mask and Nat saw a man of different\ncharacter.\n\nA man in the prime of life, with a mass of jet black hair and a black\nbeard that swept to his waist, a nose like a hawk's, and a pair of\ndark blue eyes that fixed themselves on Nat's with a look of\nLuciferian pride.\n\n\"Welcome, Nathaniel Lee,\" said the man, in deep tones that had a\ncurious accent which Nat could not place. \"I ought to know your name,\nsince your teleradios on Earth have been shouting it for three days\npast as that of the man who is to save Earth from the threat of\ndestruction. And you know me!\"\n\n\"Axelson--the Black Caesar,\" Nat muttered. For the moment he was taken\naback. He had anticipated any sort of person except this man, who\nstood, looked, and spoke like a Viking, this incarnation of pride and\nstrength.\n\nAxelson smiled--and then his eyes lit upon Madge Dawes. And for a\nmoment he stood as if petrified into a block of massive granite.\n\n\"What--who is this?\" he growled.\n\n\"Why, I'm Madge Dawes, of the Universal News Syndicate,\" answered the\ngirl, smiling at Axelson in her irrepressible manner. \"And I'm sure\nyou're not nearly such a bold, bad pirate as people think, and you're\ngoing to let us all go free.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInstantly Axelson seemed to become transformed into a maniac. He\nturned to the old men and shouted in some incomprehensible language.\nNat and Madge, Brent and Benson, and two others who wore the uniforms\nof officers were seized and dragged across the bridge to the\nlanding-stage where the black ship was moored. The rest of the crew\nwere ordered into a double line.\n\nAnd then the slaughter began.\n\nBefore Nat could even struggle to break away from the gibbering Moon\nmen to whom he and the other prisoners had been consigned, the aged\ncrew of the Black Caesar had begun their work of almost instantaneous\ndestruction.\n\nStreams of red and purple light shot from the ray-pistols that they\ncarried, and before them the crew of the ether-liner simply withered\nup and vanished. They became mere masses of human d\u00e9bris piled on the\nlanding-stage, and upon these masses, too, the old men turned their\nimplements, until only a few heaps of charred carbon remained on the\nlanding-stage, impalpable as burned paper, and slowly rising in the\nlow atmospheric pressure until they drifted over the crater.\n\nNat had cried out in horror at the sight, and tried to tear himself\nfree from the grasp of the Moon dwarfs who held him. So had the rest.\nNever was struggle so futile. Despite their short arms and legs, the\nMoon dwarfs held them in an unshakable grip, chattering and squealing\nas they compressed them against their barrel-like chests until the\nbreath was all but crushed out of their bodies.\n\n\"Devil!\" cried Nat furiously, as Axelson came up to him. \"Why don't\nyou kill us, too?\" And he hurled furious taunts and abuse at him, in\nthe hope of goading him into making the same comparatively merciless\nend of his prisoners.\n\nAxelson looked at him calmly, but made no reply. He looked at Madge\nagain, and his features were convulsed with some emotion that gave him\nthe aspect of a fiend. And then only did Nat realize that it was Madge\nwho was responsible for the Black Caesar's madness.\n\nAxelson spoke again, and the prisoners were hustled up the ladder and\non board the black vessel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The Kommandant-Kommissar will see you!\" The door of their prison had\nopened, letting in a shaft of light, and disclosing one of the\ngraybeards, who stood there, pointing at Nat.\n\n\"The--who?\" Nat demanded.\n\n\"The Kommandant-Kommissar, Comrade Axelson,\" snarled the graybeard.\n\nNat knew what that strange jargon meant. He had read books about the\npolitical sect known as Socialists who flourished in the Nineteenth\nand Twentieth Centuries, and, indeed, were even yet not everywhere\nextinct. And with that a flash of intuition explained the presence of\nthese old men on board.\n\nThese were the men who had been imprisoned in their youth, with\nAxelson's father, and had escaped and made their way into space, and\nhad been supposed dead long since. Somewhere they must have survived.\n\nAnd here they were, speaking a jargon of past generations, and\nignorant that the world had changed, relics of the past, dead as the\ndead Moon from which the black ship was winging away through the\nether.\n\n\"Don't go, Captain,\" pleaded Madge. \"Tell him we'll all go together.\"\n\nNat shook his head. \"Maybe I'll be able to make terms with him,\" he\nanswered, and stepped out upon the vessel's deck.\n\nThe graybeard slammed the door and laughed savagely. \"You'll make no\nterms with the Black Caesar,\" he said. \"This is the reign of the\nproletariat. The bourgeois must die! So Lenin decreed!\"\n\nBut he stopped suddenly and passed his hand over his forehead like a\nman awakening from a dream.\n\n\"Surely the proletariat has already triumphed on earth?\" he asked. \"A\nlong time has passed, and daily we expect the summons to return and\nestablish the new world-order. What year is this? Is it not 2017? It\nis so hard to reckon on Eros.\"\n\n\"On Eros?\" thought Nat. \"This is the year 2044,\" he answered. \"You've\nbeen dreaming, my friend. We've had our new world-order, and it's not\nin the least like the one you and your friends anticipated.\"\n\n\"Gott!\" screamed the old man. \"Gott, you're lying to me, bourgeois!\nYou're lying, I tell you!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo Eros was their destination! Eros, one of the asteroids, those tiny\nfragments of a broken planet, lying outside the orbit of Mars. Some of\nthese little worlds, of which more than a thousand are known to exist,\nare no larger than a gentleman's country estate; some are mere rocks\nin space. Eros, Nat knew, was distinguished among them from the fact\nthat it had an eccentric orbit, which brought it at times nearer Earth\nthan any other heavenly body except the Moon.\n\nAlso that it had only been known for thirty years, and that it was\nsupposed to be a double planet, having a dark companion.\n\nThat was in Nat's mind as he ascended the bridge to where Axelson was\nstanding at the controls, with one of the graybeards beside him. The\ndoor of his stateroom was open, and suddenly there scuttled out of it\none of the most bestial objects Nat had ever seen.\n\nIt was a Moon woman, a dwarfish figure, clothed in a shapeless garment\nof spun cellulose, and in her arms she held a heavy-headed Moon baby,\nwhose huge chest stood up like a pyramid, while the tiny arms and legs\nhung dangling down.\n\n\"Here is the bourgeois, Kommandant,\" said Nat's captor.\n\nAxelson looked at Nat, eye meeting eye in a slow stare. Then he\nrelinquished the controls to the graybeard beside him, and motioned\nNat to precede him into the stateroom.\n\nNat entered. It was an ordinary room, much like that of the captain of\nthe ether-liner now stranded on the Moon. There were a bunk, chairs, a\ndesk and a radio receiver.\n\nAxelson shut the door. He tried to speak and failed to master his\nemotion. At last he said:\n\n\"I am prepared to offer you terms, Nathaniel Lee, in accordance with\nmy promise.\"\n\n\"I'll make no terms with murderers,\" replied Nat bitterly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAxelson stood looking at him. His great chest rose and fell. Suddenly\nhe put out one great hand and clapped Nat on the shoulder.\n\n\"Wise men,\" he said, \"recognize facts. Within three weeks I shall be\nthe undisputed ruler of Earth. Whether of a desert or of a cowed and\nsubmissive subject-population, rests with the Earth men. I have never\nbeen on Earth, for I was born on Eros. My mother died at my birth. I\nhave never seen another human woman until to-day.\"\n\nNat looked at him, trying to follow what was in Axelson's mind.\n\n\"My father fled to Eros, a little planet seventeen miles in diameter,\nas we have found. He called it a heavenly paradise. It was his\nintention to found there a colony of those who were in rebellion\nagainst the tyrants of Earth.\n\n\"His followers journeyed to the Moon and brought back Moon women for\nwives. But there were no children of these unions. Later there were\ndissensions and civil war. Three-fourths of the colony died in battle\nwith one another.\n\n\"I was a young man. I seized the reins of power. The survivors--these\nold men--were disillusioned and docile. I made myself absolute. I\nbrought Moon men and women to Eros to serve us as slaves. But in a few\nyears the last of my father's old compatriots will have died, and thus\nit was I conceived of conquering Earth and having men to obey me. For\nfifteen years I have been experimenting and constructing apparatus,\nwith which I now have Earth at my mercy.\n\n\"But I shall need assistance, intelligent men who will obey me and aid\nme in my plans. That is why I saved you and the other officers of\nyour ether-lines. If you will join me, you shall have the highest post\non Earth under me, Nathaniel Lee, and those others shall be under\nyou.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAxelson paused, and, loathing the man though he did, Nat was conscious\nof a feeling of pity for him that he could not control. He saw his\nlonely life on Eros, surrounded by those phantom humans of the past,\nand he understood his longing for Earth rule--he the planetary exile,\nthe sole human being of all the planetary system outside Earth,\nperhaps, except for his dwindling company of aged men.\n\n\"To-day, Nathaniel Lee,\" Axelson went on, \"my life was recast in a new\nmould when I saw the woman you have brought with you. I did not know\nbefore that women were beautiful to look on. I did not dream that\ncreatures such as she existed. She must be mine, Nathaniel Lee.\n\n\"But that is immaterial. What is your answer to my offer?\"\n\nNat was trying to think, though passion distorted the mental images as\nthey arose in his brain. To Axelson it was evidently incomprehensible\nthat there would be any objection to his taking Madge. Nat saw that he\nmust temporize for Madge's sake.\n\n\"I'll have to consult my companions,\" he answered.\n\n\"Of course,\" answered Axelson. \"That is reasonable. Tell them that\nunless they agree to join me it will be necessary for them to die. Do\nEarth men mind death? We hate it on Eros, and the Moon men hate it,\ntoo, though they have a queer legend that something in the shape of an\ninvisible man raises from their ashes. My father told me that that\nsuperstition existed on Earth in his time, too. Go and talk to your\ncompanions, Nathaniel Lee.\"\n\nThe Black Caesar's voice was almost friendly. He clapped Nat on the\nshoulder again, and called the graybeard to conduct him back to his\nprison.\n\n\"Oh, Captain Lee, I'm so glad you're back!\" exclaimed Madge. \"We've\nbeen afraid for you. Is he such a terrible man, this Black Caesar?\"\n\nNat sneered, then grinned malevolently. \"Well, he's not exactly the\nold-fashioned idea of a Sunday-school teacher,\" he answered. Of course\nhe could not tell the girl about Axelson's proposal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe little group of prisoners stood on the upper deck of the black\nship and watched the Moon men scurrying about the landing-stage as she\nhovered to her position.\n\nAxelson's father had not erred when he had called the tiny planet,\nEros, a heavenly paradise, for no other term could have described it.\n\nThey were in an atmosphere so similar to that of Earth that they could\nbreathe with complete freedom, but there seemed to be a lightness and\na vigor in their limbs that indicated that the air was supercharged\nwith oxygen or ozone. The presence of this in large amounts was\nindicated by the intense blueness of the sky, across which fleecy\nclouds were drifting.\n\nAnd in that sky what looked like threescore moons were circling with\nextraordinary swiftness. From thirty to forty full moons, of all\nsizes, from that of a sun to that of a brilliant planet, and riding\nblack against the blue.\n\nThe sun, hardly smaller than when seen from Earth, shone in the\nzenith, and Earth and Mars hung in the east and north respectively,\neach like a blood-red sun.\n\nThe moons were some of the thousand other asteroids, weaving their\nlacy patterns in and out among each other. But, stupendous as the\nsight was, it was toward the terrestrial scene that the party turned\ntheir eyes as the black ship settled.\n\nA sea of sapphire blue lapped sands of silver and broke into soft\nlines of foam. To the water's edge extended a lawn of brightest green,\nand behind this an arm of the sea extended into what looked like a\ntropical forest. Most of the trees were palmlike, but towered to\nimmense heights, their foliage swaying in a gentle breeze. There were\napparently no elevations, and yet, so small was the little sphere that\nthe ascending curve gave the illusion of distant heights, while the\nhorizon, instead of seeming to rise, lay apparently perfectly flat,\nproducing an extraordinary feeling of insecurity.\n\nNear the water's edge a palatial mansion, built of hewn logs and of a\nsingle story, stood in a garden of brilliant flowers. Nearer, beyond\nthe high landing-stage, were the great shipbuilding works, and near\nthem an immense and slightly concave mirror flashed back the light of\nthe sun.\n\n\"The death ray!\" whispered Brent to Nat.\n\nAxelson came up to the party as the ship settled down. \"Welcome to\nEros,\" he said cordially. \"My father told me that in some Earth tongue\nthat name meant 'love'.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNever, perhaps, was so strange a feast held as that with which Axelson\nentertained his guests that day. Dwarfish Moon men passed viands and a\nsort of palm wine in the great banquet-room, which singularly\nresembled one of those early twentieth century interiors shown in\nmuseums. Only the presence of a dozen of the aged guards, armed with\nray-rods, lent a grimness to the scene.\n\nMadge sat on Axelson's right, and Nat on his left. The girl's\nlightheartedness had left her; her face grew strained as Axelson's\nmotives--which Nat had not dared disclose to her--disclosed themselves\nin his manner.\n\nOnce, when he laid his finger for a moment against her white throat,\nshe started, and for a moment it seemed as if the gathering storm must\nbreak.\n\nFor Nat had talked with his men, and all had agreed that they would\nnot turn traitor, though they intended to temporize as long as\npossible, in the hope of catching the Black Caesar unawares.\n\nThen slowly a somber twilight began to fall, and Axelson rose.\n\n\"Let us walk in the gardens during the reign of Erebos,\" he said.\n\n\"Erebos?\" asked Nat.\n\n\"The black world that overshadows us each sleeping period,\" answered\nAxelson.\n\nNat knew what he meant. The dark companion of Eros revolves around it\nevery six hours; the day of Eros would therefore never be longer than\nsix hours, this without reckoning the revolution of Eros around the\nsun. But owing to its small size, it was probable that it was bathed\nin almost perpetual sunshine.\n\nThe sweet scent of the flowers, much stronger than of any flowers on\nearth, filled the air. They walked across the green lawn and entered a\njungle path, with bamboos and creeping plants on either side, and huge\npalmlike trees. Behind them stalked the guards with their ray-rods.\n\nA lake of deepest black disclosed itself. Suddenly Madge uttered a\nscream and clung to Nat. \"Look, look!\" she cried. \"It's horrible!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly Nat realized that the lake swarmed with monsters. They were\nof crocodilian form, but twice the size of the largest crocodile, and\nsprawled over one another in the shallows beside the margin. As the\nparty drew near, an enormous monster began waddling on its clawed feet\ntoward them.\n\nA mouth half the length of the creature opened, disclosing a purplish\ntongue and hideous fangs. Madge screamed again.\n\n\"Ah, so fear exists on Earth, too?\" asked Axelson blandly. \"That makes\nmy conquest sure. I suspected it, and yet I was not sure that science\nhad not conquered it. But there is no cause for fear. A magnetic field\nprotects us. See!\"\n\nFor the waddling monster suddenly stopped short as if brought up\nsharply by the bars of a cage, and drew back.\n\nAxelson turned and wheezed in the Moon language--if the gibbering of\nthe dwarfs could be called speech--and one of the guards answered him.\n\n\"These primitive dwellers on Eros I have preserved,\" said Axelson, \"as\na means of discipline. The Moon animals are afraid of them. I keep a\nsupply of those who have transgressed my laws to feed them. See!\"\n\nHe turned and pointed. Two guards were bringing a gibbering,\nscreeching, struggling Moon man with them. Despite his strength, he\nseemed incapable of making any resistance, but his whole body\nquivered, and his hideous face was contorted with agony of terror.\n\nAt a distance of some fifty feet they turned aside into a little\nbypath through the jungle, reappearing close beside the Lake upon a\nraised platform. And what happened next happened so swiftly that Nat\nwas unable to do anything to prevent it.\n\nThe guards disappeared; the Moon man, as if propelled by some\ninvisible force, moved forward jerkily to the lake's edge. Instantly\none of the saurians had seized him in its jaws, and another had\nwrenched half the body away, and the whole fighting, squirming mass\nvanished in the depths.\n\nAnd from far away came the screeching chant of the Moon men, as if in\ninvocation to some hideous deity.\n\nAnd, moving perceptibly, the huge black orb of Eros's dark satellite\ncrept over the sky, completely covering it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAxelson stepped forward to where Nat stood, supporting Madge in his\narms. The girl had fainted with horror at the scene.\n\n\"Your answer Nathaniel Lee,\" he said softly. \"I know you have been\npostponing the decision. Now I will take the girl, and you shall give\nme your answer. Will you and these men join me, or will you die as the\nMoon man died?\" He spoke wheezily, as if he, like Nat, had a cold.\n\nAnd he put his arm around Madge.\n\nNext moment something happened to him that had never happened in his\nlife before. The Black Caesar went down under a well-directed blow to\nthe jaw.\n\nHe leaped to his feet trembling with fury and barked a command.\nInstantly the old guards had hurled themselves forward. And behind\nthem a horde of Moon men came, ambling.\n\nWhile the guards covered their prisoners with their ray-rods, two Moon\nmen seized each of them, imprisoning him in their unbreakable grasp.\n\nAxelson pointed upward. \"When the reign of Erebos is past,\" he said,\n\"you become food for the denizens of the lake, unless you have agreed\nto serve me.\"\n\nAnd he raised Madge in his arms, laughing as the girl fought and\nstruggled to resist him.\n\n\"Madge!\" cried Nat, trying to run toward her.\n\nSo furious were his struggles that for a moment he succeeded in\nthrowing off the Moon men's grasp. Then he was caught again, and,\nfighting desperately, was borne off by the dwarfs through the shadows.\n\nThey traversed the border of the lake until a small stone building\ndisclosed itself. Nat and the others were thrust inside into pitch\ndarkness. The door clanged; in vain they hurled themselves against it.\nIt was of wood, but it was as solid as the stone itself, and it did\nnot give an inch for all their struggles.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Where is your Kommandant?\" The whisper seemed in the stone hut\nitself. \"Your Nathaniel Lee. I must speak to him. I am the guard who\nbrought him to the Black Caesar on board the ship.\"\n\n\"I'm here,\" said Nat. \"Where are you?\"\n\n\"I am in the house of the ray. I am on guard there. I am speaking into\nthe telephone which runs only to where you are. You can speak anywhere\nin the hut, and I shall hear you.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you want?\" asked Nat.\n\n\"You love the Earth woman. I remember, when I was a boy, we used to\nlove. I had forgotten. There was a girl in Stamford.... Tell me, is it\ntrue that this is the year 2044 and that the proletariat has not yet\ntriumphed?\"\n\n\"It's true,\" said Nat. \"Those dreams are finished, We're proud of the\nWorld Federation. Tell me about Madge Dawes--the Earth woman. Is she\nsafe?\"\n\n\"He has taken her to his house. I do not think she is harmed. He is\nill. He is closely guarded. There are rumors afoot. I do not know.\"\n\n\"What do you want, then?\"\n\n\"If the Black Caesar dies will you take me back to Earth again? I long\nso for the old Earth life. I will be your slave, if only I can set\nfoot on Earth before I die.\"\n\n\"Can you rescue us?\" Nat held his breath.\n\n\"The Moon men are on guard.\"\n\n\"They have no ray-guns and you have.\"\n\n\"The penalty would be terrible. I should be thrown to the monsters.\"\n\n\"Can you get us each a ray-gun? Will you risk it, to get back to\nEarth?\" asked Nat.\n\nA pause. Then, \"My friend, I am coming.\"\n\nNat heard Benson hissing in his ear, \"If we can surprise them, we can\nget possession of the black ship and return.\"\n\n\"We must get Madge Dawes.\"\n\n\"And smash the mirror,\" put in Brent.\n\nAfter that there was nothing to do but wait.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe door clicked open. An indistinct form stood in the entrance. It\nwas already growing light; the dark satellite that eclipsed Eros was\npassing.\n\n\"Hush! I have brought you ray-rods!\" It was the old man with whom Nat\nhad spoken on the boat. Under his arm he held five metallic rods,\ntipped with luminous glass. He handed one to each of the prisoners.\n\"Do you know how to use them?\" he asked.\n\nNat examined his. \"It's an old-style rod that was used on earth fifty\nyears ago,\" he told his men. \"I've seen them in museums. It came into\nuse in the Second World War of 1950 or thereabouts. You slip back the\nsafety catch and press this button, taking aim as one did with the\npistol. You fellows have seen pistols?\"\n\n\"My father had an old one,\" said the chief mate, Barnes.\n\n\"How many times can they be fired without reloading?\" Nat asked the\nold guard.\n\n\"Ten times; sometimes more; and they were all freshly loaded\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"Take us to where Axelson is.\"\n\n\"First you must destroy the guards. I sent the one on duty here away\non some pretext. But the others may be here at any moment. Talk lower.\nAre you going to kill them?\"\n\n\"We must,\" said Nat.\n\nThe old fellow began to sob. \"We were companions together. They seized\nus and imprisoned us together, the capitalists, years ago. I thought\nthe proletariat would have won, and you say it is all different. I am\nan old man, and life is sad and strange.\"\n\n\"Listen. Is Axelson in the house?\" demanded Nat.\n\n\"He is in his secret room. I do not know the way. None of us has ever\nentered it.\"\n\n\"And Madge?\"\n\n\"She was with him. I do not know anything more.\" He sank down,\ngroaning, broken.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNat pushed his way past him. It was fast growing light now. A ray of\nsunshine shot from beneath the edge of the dark sphere overhead, which\nstill filled almost all the heavens. At that moment the hideous face\nand squat body of one of the Moon men came into view at the end of\nthe path. The creature stopped, gibbering with surprise, and then\nrushed forward, mewing like a cat.\n\nNat aimed his ray-rod and pressed the button. The streak of light, not\nquite aimed, in Nat's excitement, sheared off one side of the Moon\nman's face.\n\nThe creature rocked where it stood, raised its voice in a screech, and\nrushed forward again, arms flailing. And this time Nat got home. The\nstreak passed right through the body of the monster, which collapsed\ninto a heap of calcined carbon.\n\nBut its screech had brought the other dwarfs running to the scene. In\na moment the path was blocked by a score of the hideous monsters,\nwhich, taking in what was happening, came forward in a yelling bunch.\n\nThe ray-rods streaked their message of death into the thick of them.\nYet so fierce was the rush that some parts got home. Arms, legs, and\nbarrel chests, halves of men, covering the five with that impalpable\nblack powder into which their bodies were dissolving. Nat remembered\nafterward the horror of a grinning face, apparently loose in the air,\nand a flailing arm that lashed his chest.\n\nFor fifteen seconds, perhaps, it was like struggling with some vampire\ncreatures in a hideous dream. And then, just when it seemed to Nat\nthat he was going mad, he found the path free, and the huddled\nremnants of the Moon men piled up about him on every side.\n\nHe emptied two more ray-shots into the writhing mass, and saw it cease\nto quiver and then dissolve into the black powder. He turned and\nlooked at his companions. They, too, showed the horror of the strain\nthey had undergone.\n\n\"We must kill the guards now,\" Nat panted. \"And then find Madge and\nsave her.\"\n\n\"We're with you,\" answered Brent, and together the five rushed into\nthe sunlight and the open.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were no guards on duty at the entrance of the house, and the\ndoor stood wide open. Nat rushed through the door at the head of his\nmen. A single guard was in the hall, but he only looked up as they\ncame in. And it was evident that he was in no condition to resist, for\nhe was in the grip of some terrible disease.\n\nHis features were swollen so that they were hardly recognizable, and\nhoarse, panting breaths came from his lungs. He was so far gone that\nhe hardly registered surprise at the advent of the five.\n\n\"Where's Axelson?\" demanded Nat.\n\nThe guard pointed toward the end of the corridor, then let his arm\nfall. Nat led his men along the half-dark passage.\n\nAt the end of the corridor two more guards were on duty, but one was\ncollapsed upon the floor, apparently unconscious, and the other,\nmaking a feeble attempt to draw his ray-rod, crumbled into ashes as\nBrent fired. The five burst through the door.\n\nThey found themselves in the banquet-hall. The remnants of the meal\nwere still upon the table, and three Moon men, looking as if they had\nbeen poisoned, were writhing on the floor. At the farther end of the\nhall was another door.\n\nThis gave upon a central hall, with a door in each of its four sides,\nand a blaze of sunlight coming through the crystal roof. The five\nstopped, baffled. Then of a sudden Axelson's voice broke the\nsilence--his voice, yet changed almost beyond recognition, hoarse,\nbroken, and gasping:\n\n\"Try the doors, Nathaniel Lee. Try each door in turn, and then go\nback. And know that in an instant I can blast you to nothingness where\nyou stand!\"\n\nAnd suddenly there came Madge's voice, \"He can't! He can't, Nat. He's\ndying, and he knows it. I won't let him, and he hasn't got the\nstrength to move.\"\n\n\"Which door?\" cried Nat in desperation.\n\n\"None of the doors. They're a trick,\" came Madge's voice. \"Go forward\nand press the grooved panel upon the wall in front of you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNat stepped forward, found the panel, and pressed it. The wall swung\nopen, like two folded doors, revealing another room within, perfectly\ncircular.\n\nIt contained a quantity of pieces of apparatus, some glowing with\nlight, some dark, and a radio transmitting set; it was evidently the\nsecret lair of the Black Caesar. And there he was, trapped at last by\nthe mortal illness that had overtaken him!\n\nHe was lying upon the couch, his great form stretched out, his\nfeatures hideously swollen by the same disease that had attacked the\nguards.\n\nNat raised his ray-rod, but Axelson feebly put up his hand, and Nat\nlowered the weapon. And, as the five gathered about the dying man,\nagain Nat felt that strange sense of pathos and pity for him.\n\nHe had never known Earth life, and he was not to be measured by the\ncommon standards applicable on Earth.\n\n\"Don't fire, Nat,\" said Madge in a shaky voice. She was seated beside\nAxelson, and--the wonder of it--she was sponging the foam from his\nlips and moistening his forehead. She raised a crystal that contained\nsome fluid to his lips, and he drained it greedily.\n\n\"So--Earth wins, Nathaniel Lee,\" whispered Axelson hoarsely. \"I am\ndying. I know it. It is the same dreaded disease that came to the Moon\nat the time of my father's landing there. Three-fourths of the Moon\nanimals died. It is mortal. The lungs burn away.\n\n\"My father told me that on Earth it is not mortal. He called it\n'cold'--but I am burning hot.\"\n\nThen only did Nat understand, and the irony of it made him catch his\nbreath and grit his teeth to check his hysterical laughter. The Black\nCaesar, the terror of Earth, was dying of a common cold which he\nhimself had given him.\n\nThe coryza germ, almost harmless on Earth, among a population\nhabituated to it for countless generations, had assumed the potency of\na plague here, where no colds had ever been known--among the Moon men,\nand even among the guards, after their lifetime in the germless\nclimate of Eros.\n\n\"I've failed, Nathaniel Lee,\" came the Black Caesar's voice. \"And yet\nthat hardly troubles me. There is something more that I do not\nunderstand. She is a creature like ourselves--with will and reason.\nShe is not like the Moon women. She told me that she did not wish to\nbe queen of the Earth because she did not love me. I do not\nunderstand. And so--I am glad to go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA gasp came from Axelson's throat as he raised his head and tried to\nspeak, but the death-rattle was already in his throat. A slight\nstruggle, and the massive form upon the couch was nothing but\ninanimate clay.\n\nMadge rose from beside him, and the tears were streaming down her\nface.\n\n\"He wasn't a bad man, Nat,\" she said. \"He was--gentle with me. He\ndidn't understand; that was all. When I refused to be his queen, he\nwas overcome with bewilderment. Oh, Nat, I can never, never write this\nstory for the Universal News Syndicate.\"\n\nNat led her, sobbing, from the room.\n\nSoon he succeeded in getting into teleradio communication with Earth.\nHe broadcast the news that the Black Caesar was dead, and that his\npower for evil was at an end forever.\n\nThen, in the few hours of daylight that remained, he set his men to\nwork to smash the ray outfit that had destroyed China. There was some\nprinciple involved which he did not altogether understand, though\nBrent professed to have a clue to it, but it was evident that, except\nfor the ray, Axelson had possessed no knowledge superior to that of\nthe Earth scientists.\n\nOf the guards, a few were already recovering, principally those of\ncomparatively younger age. Not a Moon man, on the other hand, had\nsurvived the epidemic. As soon as Nat had got the guards out of the\nhouse, he reduced it to ashes by the aid of an old-fashioned box of\nphosphoric matches.\n\nAs the dark satellite was again creeping over Eros, the black ship set\nsail.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut of the return journey to the Moon, where they transferred to their\nown ship, of their landing at New York, and of the triumphal reception\nthat was accorded them, this is no place to speak. Nat's journey with\nMadge from the center of the city, in what was the old Borough of\nWestchester, to his home in the suburb of Hartford, was a continual\novation.\n\nCrowds lined the air-route, and every few miles, so thick was the\nair-traffic, he was forced to hover and address the cheering\nmultitudes. Hartford itself was _en fete_, and across the main road\nthe City Bosses had hung an old-fashioned banner, strung from house to\nhouse on either side, bearing the legend: For World President:\nNATHANIEL LEE!\n\nNat turned to Madge, who was seated beside him silently. \"Ever hear of\n'getting married?'\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course I've heard of it,\" replied the girl indignantly. \"Do you\nthink I'm as dumb as that, Nat Lee? Why, those old-fashioned novels\nare part of the public schools' curriculum.\"\n\n\"Pity those days can't come back. You ought to be a World\nPresidentess, you know,\" said Nat. \"I was thinking, if we registered\nas companionates, I could take you into the White House, and you'd\nhave a swell time there taking X-rays on visiting days.\"\n\n\"Well,\" answered Madge slowly. \"I never thought of that. It might be\nworth trying out.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Second Satellite\n\n_By Edmond Hamilton_\n\n[Illustration: _The city of the frog-men!_]\n\n[Sidenote: Earth-men war on frog-vampires for the emancipation of the\nhuman cows of Earth's second satellite.]\n\n\nNorman and Hackett, bulky in their thick flying suits, seemed to fill\nthe little office. Across the room Harding, the field superintendent,\ncontemplated them. Two planes were curving up into the dawn together\nfrom the field outside, their motors thunderous as they roared over\nthe building. When their clamor had receded, Harding spoke:\n\n\"I don't know which of you two is crazier,\" he said. \"You, Norman, to\npropose a fool trip like this, or you, Hackett, to go with him.\"\n\nHackett grinned, but the long, lean face of Norman was earnest. \"No\ndoubt it all sounds a little insane,\" he said, \"but I'm convinced I'm\nright.\"\n\nThe field superintendent shook his head. \"Norman, you ought to be\nwriting fiction instead of flying. A second satellite--and Fellows and\nthe others on it--what the devil!\"\n\n\"What other theory can account for their disappearance?\" asked Norman\ncalmly. \"You know that since the new X-type planes were introduced,\nhundreds of fliers all over Earth have been trying for altitude\nrecords in them. Twenty-five miles--thirty--thirty-five--the records\nhave been broken every day. But out of the hundreds of fliers who\nhave gone up to those immense heights, four have never come down nor\nbeen seen again!\n\n\"One vanished over northern Sweden, one over Australia, one over Lower\nCalifornia, and one, Fellows, himself, right here over Long Island.\nYou saw the globe on which I marked those four spots, and you saw that\nwhen connected they formed a perfect circle around the Earth. The only\nexplanation is that the four fliers when they reached a forty-mile\nheight were caught up by some body moving round Earth in that circular\norbit, some unknown moon circling Earth inside its atmosphere, a\nsecond satellite of Earth's whose existence has until now never been\nsuspected!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHarding shook his head again. \"Norman, your theory would be all right\nif it were not for the cold fact that no such satellite has ever been\nglimpsed.\"\n\n\"Can you glimpse a bullet passing you?\" Norman retorted. \"The two\nfliers at Sweden and Lower California vanished within three hours of\neach other, on opposite sides of the Earth. That means that this\nsecond satellite, as I've computed, circles Earth once every six\nhours, and travelling at that terrific speed it is no more visible to\nus of Earth than a rifle bullet would be.\"\n\n\"Moving through Earth's atmosphere at such speed, indeed, one would\nexpect it to burn up by its own friction with the air. But it does\nnot, because its own gravitational power would draw to itself enough\nair to make a dense little atmosphere for itself that would cling to\nit and shield it as it speeds through Earth's upper air. No, I'm\ncertain that this second satellite exists, Harding, and I'm as certain\nthat it's responsible for the vanishing of those four fliers.\"\n\n\"And now you and Hackett have figured when it will be passing over\nhere and are going up in an X-type yourselves to look for it,\"\nHarding said musingly.\n\n\"Look for it?\" echoed Hackett. \"We're not going to climb forty miles\njust to get a look at the damn thing--we're going to try landing on\nit!\"\n\n\"You're crazy sure!\" the field superintendent exploded. \"If Fellows\nand those others got caught by the thing and never came down again,\nwhy in the name of all that's holy would you two want--\" He stopped\nsuddenly. \"Oh, I think I see,\" he said, awkwardly. \"Fellows was rather\na buddy of you two, wasn't he?\"\n\n\"The best that ever flew a crippled Nieuport against three Fokkers to\npull us out of a hole,\" said Norman softly. \"Weeks he's been gone, and\nif it had been Hackett and I he'd be all over the sky looking for\nus--the damned lunatic. Well, we're not going to let him down.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Harding repeated. Then--\"Well, here comes your mechanic,\nNorman, so your ship must be ready. I'll go with you. It's an event to\nsee two Columbuses starting for another world.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe gray dawn-light over the flying field was flushing to faint rose\nas the three strode out to where the long X-type stood, its strangely\ncurved wings, enclosed cabin and flat, fan-like tail gleaming dully.\nIts motor was already roaring with power and the plane's stubby wheels\nstrained against the chocks. In their great suits Norman and Hackett\nwere like two immense ape-figures in the uncertain light, to the eyes\nof those about them.\n\n\"Well, all the luck,\" Harding told them. \"You know I'm pulling for\nyou, but--I suppose it's useless to say anything about being careful.\"\n\n\"I seem to have heard the words,\" Hackett grinned, as he and Norman\nshook the field superintendent's hand.\n\n\"It's all the craziest chance,\" Norman told the other. \"And if we\ndon't come down in a reasonable time--well, you'll know that our\ntheory was right, and you can broadcast it or not as you please.\"\n\n\"I hope for your sake that you're dead wrong,\" smiled the official.\n\"I've told you two to get off the Earth a lot of times, but I never\nmeant it seriously.\"\n\nHarding stepped back as the two clambered laboriously into the cramped\ncabin. Norman took the controls, the door slammed, and as the chocks\nwere jerked back and the motor roared louder the long plane curved up\nat a dizzy angle from the field into the dawn. Hackett waved a thick\narm down toward the diminishing figures on the field below; then\nturned from the window to peer ahead with his companion.\n\nThe plane flew in a narrow ascending spiral upward, at an angle that\nwould have been impossible to any ship save an X-type. Norman's eyes\nroved steadily over the instrument as they rose, his ears\nunconsciously alert for each explosion of the motor. Earth receded\nswiftly into a great gray concave surface as they climbed higher and\nhigher.\n\nBy the time the five-mile height was reached Earth's surface had\nchanged definitely from concave to convex. The plane was ascending by\nthen in a somewhat wider spiral, but its climb was as steady and sure\nas ever. Frost begin to form quickly on the cabin's windows, creeping\nout from the edges. Norman spoke a word over the motor's muffled\nthunder, and Hackett snicked on the electrical radiators. The frost\ncrept back as their warm, clean heat flooded the cabin.\n\nTen miles--fifteen--they had reached already altitudes impossible but\na few years before, though it was nothing to the X-types. As they\npassed the ten-mile mark, Hackett set the compact oxygen-generator\ngoing. A clean, tangy odor filled the cabin as it began functioning.\nTwenty miles--twenty-two--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a time Norman pointed mutely to the clock on the instrument\nboard, and Hackett nodded. They were well within their time schedule,\nhaving calculated to reach the forty-mile height at ten, the hour\nwhen, by its computed orbit, the second satellite should be passing\noverhead. \"--26--27--28--\" Hackett muttered the altimeter figures to\nhimself as the needle crept over them.\n\nGlancing obliquely down through the window he saw that Earth was now a\nhuge gray ball beneath them, white cloud-oceans obscuring the drab\ndetails of its surface here and there. \"--31--32--\" The plane was\nclimbing more slowly, and at a lesser angle. Even the X-type had to\nstruggle to rise in the attenuated air now about them. Only the\nsuper-light, super-powered plane could ever have reached the terrific\nheight.\n\nIt was at the thirty-four mile level that the real battle for altitude\nbegan. Norman kept the plane curving steadily upward, handling it with\nsurpassing skill in the rarefied air. Frost was on its windows now\ndespite the heating mechanism. Slowly the altimeter needle crept to\nthe forty mark. Norman kept the ship circling, its wings tilted\nslightly, but not climbing, Earth a great gray misty ball beneath.\n\n\"Can't keep this height long,\" he jerked. \"If our second satellite\ndoesn't show up in minutes we've had a trip for nothing.\"\n\n\"All seems mighty different up here,\" was Hackett's shouted comment.\n\"Easy enough to talk down there about hopping onto the thing, but up\nhere--hell, there's nothing but air and mighty little of that!\"\n\nNorman grinned. \"There'll be more. If I'm right about this thing we\nwon't need to hop it--its own atmosphere will pick us up.\"\n\nBoth looked anxious as the motor sputtered briefly. But in a moment it\nwas again roaring steadily. Norman shook his head.\n\n\"Maybe a fool's errand after all. No--I'm still sure we're right! But\nit seems that we don't prove it this time.\"\n\n\"Going down?\" asked Hackett.\n\n\"We'll have to, in minutes. Even with its own air-feed the motor can't\nstand this height for--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorman never finished the words. There was a sound, a keen rising,\nrushing sound of immense power that reached their ears over the\nmotor's roar. Then in an instant the universe seemed to go mad about\nthem: they saw the gray ball of Earth and the sun above skyrocketing\naround them as the plane whirled madly.\n\nThe rushing sound was in that moment thunderous, terrible, and as\nwinds smashed and rocked the plane like giant hands, Hackett glimpsed\nanother sphere that was not the sphere of Earth, a greenish globe that\nexpanded with lightning speed in the firmament beside their spinning\nplane! The winds stilled; the green globe changed abruptly to a\nlandscape of green land and sea toward which the plane was falling!\nNorman was fighting the controls--land and sea were gyrating up to\nthem with dizzy speed--crash!\n\nWith that cracking crash the plane was motionless. Sunlight poured\nthrough its windows, and great green growths were all around it.\nHackett, despite Norman's warning cry, forced the door open and was\nbursting outside, Norman after him. They staggered and fell, with\ncurious lightness and slowness, on the ground outside, then clutched\nthe plane for support and gazed stupefiedly around them.\n\nThe plane had crashed down into a thicket of giant green reeds that\nrose a yard over their heads, its pancake landing having apparently\nnot damaged it. The ground beneath their feet was soft and soggy, the\nair warm and balmy, and the giant reeds hid all the surrounding\nlandscape from view.\n\nIn the sky the sun burned near one horizon with unusual brilliance.\nBut it was dwarfed, in size, by the huge gray circle that filled half\nthe heavens overhead. A giant gray sphere it was, screened here and\nthere by floating white mists and clouds, that had yet plain on it\nthe outlines of dark continents and gleaming seas. A quaking\nrealization held the two as they stared up at it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Earth!\" Norman was babbling. \"It's Earth, Hackett--above us; my God,\nI can't believe even yet that we've done it!\"\n\n\"Then we're on--the satellite--the second satellite!--\" Hackett fought\nfor reality. \"Those winds that caught us--\"\n\n\"They were the atmosphere of this world, of the second satellite! They\ncaught us and carried us on inside this smaller world's atmosphere,\nHackett. We're moving with it around Earth at terrific speed now!\"\n\n\"The second satellite, and we on it!\" Hackett whispered,\nincredulously. \"But these reeds--it can't all be like this--\"\n\nThey stepped together away from the plane. The effort sent each of\nthem sailing upward in a great, slow leap, to float down more than a\nscore of feet from the plane. But unheeding in their eagerness this\nstrange effect of the satellite's lesser gravitational power, they\nmoved on, each step a giant, clumsy leap. Four such steps took them\nout of the towering reeds onto clear ground.\n\nIt was a gentle, grassy slope they were on, stretching away along a\ngray-green sea that extended out to the astoundingly near horizon on\ntheir right. To the left it rose into low hills covered with dense\nmasses of green junglelike vegetation. Hackett and Norman, though,\ngazed neither at sea or hills for the moment, but at the half-score\ngrotesque figures who had turned toward them as they emerged from the\nreeds. A sick sense of the unreal held them as they gazed, frozen with\nhorror. For the great figures returning their gaze a few yards from\nthem were--frog-men!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrog-men! Great mottled green shapes seven to eight feet in height,\nwith bowed, powerful legs and arms that ended in webbed paws. The\nheads were bulbous ones in which wide, unwinking frog-eyes were set at\nthe sides, the mouths white-lipped and white-lined. Three of the\ncreatures held each a black metal tube-and-handle oddly like a\ntarget-pistol.\n\n\"Norman!\" Hackett's voice was a crescendo of horror. \"_Norman!_\"\n\n\"Back to the plane!\" Norman cried thickly. \"The plane--\"\n\nThe two staggered back, but the frog-men, recovering from their own\nfirst surprise, were running forward with great hopping steps! The two\nfliers flung themselves back in a floating leap toward the reeds, but\nthe green monsters were quick after them. A croaking cry came from one\nand as another raised his tube-and-handle, something flicked from it\nthat burst close beside Norman. There was no sound or light as it\nburst, but the reeds for a few feet around it vanished!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA hoarse cry from Hackett--the creatures had reached him, grasped him\nat the edge of the reeds! Norman swerved in his floating leap to\nstrike the struggling flier and frog-men. The scene whirled around him\nas he fought them, great paws reaching for him. With a sick, frantic\nrage he felt his clenched fist drive against cold, green, billowy\nbodies. Croaking cries sounded in his ears; then, Hackett and he were\njerked to their feet, held tightly by four of the creatures.\n\n\"My God, Norman,\" panted Hackett, helpless. \"What are\nthey--frog-things?--\"\n\n\"Steady, Hackett. They're the people of the second satellite, it\nseems; wait!\"\n\nOne of the armed frog-men approached and inspected them, and then\ncroaked an order in a deep voice. Then, still holding the two tightly,\nthe party of monsters began to move along the slope, skirting the\nsea's edge. In a few minutes they reached two curious objects resting\non the slope. They seemed long black metal boats, slender and with\nsharp prow and stern. A compact mechanism and control-board filled\nthe prow, while at the stern and sides were long tubes mounted on\nswivels like machine-guns.\n\nThe frog-men motioned Norman and Hackett into one, fastening the two\nprisoners and themselves into their seats with metal straps provided\nfor the purpose. Four had entered the one boat, the others that of the\ncaptives. One at the prow moved his paws over the control-board and\nwith a purring of power the boat, followed by the other, rose smoothly\ninto the air. It headed out over the gray-green sea, land dropping\nquickly from sight behind, the horizons water-bounded on all sides.\nFrom their nearness Norman guessed that this second satellite of\nEarth's was small indeed beside its mother planet. He had to look up\nto earth's great gray sphere overhead to attain a sense of reality.\n\nHackett was whispering beside him, the frog-men watchful. \"Norman, it's\nnot real--it can't be real! These things--these boats--intelligent like\nmen--\"\n\nThe other sought to steady him. \"It's a different world, Hackett.\nGravitation different, light different, everything different, and\nevolution here has had a different course. On Earth men evolved to be\nthe most intelligent life-forms, but here the frog-races, it seems.\"\n\n\"But where are they taking us? Could we ever find the plane again?\"\n\n\"God knows. If we ever get away from these things we might. And we've\ngot to find Fellows, too; I wonder where he is on this world.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor many minutes the two boats raced on at great speed over the\nendless waters before the watery skyline was broken far ahead by\nsomething dark and unmoving. Hackett and Norman peered with intense\ninterest toward it. It seemed at first a giant squat mountain rising\nfrom the sea, but as they shot nearer they saw that its outline was\ntoo regular, and that colossal as it was in size it was the work of\nintelligence. They gasped as they came nearer and got a better view of\nit.\n\nFor it was a gigantic dome of black metal rising sheer from the lonely\nsea, ten miles if anything in diameter, a third that in greatest\nheight. There was no gate or window or opening of any kind in it. Just\nthe colossal, smooth black dome rearing from the watery plain. Yet the\ntwo boats were flashing lower toward it.\n\n\"They can't be going inside!\" Hackett conjectured. \"There's no way in\nand what could be in there? The whole thing's mad--\"\n\n\"There's some way,\" Norman said. \"They're slowing--\"\n\nThe flying-boats were indeed slowing as they dipped lower. They were\nvery near the dome now, its curving wall a looming, sky-high barrier\nbefore them. Suddenly the boats dipped sharply downward toward the\ngreen sea. Before the two fliers could comprehend their purpose, could\ndo aught more than draw instinctive great breaths in preparation, the\ntwo craft had shot down into the waters and were arrowing down through\nthe green depths.\n\nBlinded, flung against his metal strap by the resistance of the waters\nthey ripped through, Norman yet retained enough of consciousness to\nglimpse beams of light that stabbed ahead from the prows of their\nrushing boats, to see vaguely strange creatures of the deep blundering\nin and out of those beams as the boats hurtled forward. The water that\nforced its way between his lips was fresh, he was vaguely aware, and\neven as he fought to hold his breath was aware too that the frog-men\nseemed in no way incommoded by the sudden transition into the water,\ntheir amphibian nature allowing them to stay under it far longer than\nany human could do.\n\nThe boats ripped through the waters at terrific speed and in a few\nseconds there loomed before them the giant metal wall of the great\ndome, going down into the depths here. Norman glimpsed vaguely that\nthe whole colossal dome rested on a vast pedestal-like mountain of\nrock that rose from the sea's floor almost to the surface. Then a\ngreat round opening in the wall; the boats flashed into it and were\nhurtling along a water-filled tunnel. Norman felt his lungs near\nbursting--when the tunnel turned sharply upward and the boats whizzed\nup and abruptly out of the water-tunnel into air!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut it was not the open air again. They were beneath the gigantic\ndome! For as Norman and Hackett breathed deep, awe fell on their faces\nas they took in the scene. Far overhead stretched the dome's\ncolossally curving roof, and far out on all sides. It was lit beneath\nthat roof by a clear light that the two would have sworn was sunlight.\nThe dome was in effect the roof of a gigantic, illuminated building,\nand upon its floor there stretched a mighty city.\n\nThe city of the frog-men! Their boats were rising up over it and\nNorman and Hackett saw it clear. Square mile upon square mile of\nstructures stretched beneath the dome, black buildings often of\nimmense size, varying in shape, but all of square, rectangular\nproportions. Between them moved countless frog-hordes, swirling\nthrongs in streets and squares, and over the roofs darted thick swarms\nof flying-boats. And at the city's center, in a great, circular, clear\nspace, lay a wide, round, green pool--the opening of the water-tunnel\nup through which they had come.\n\nNorman pointed down toward it. \"That's your answer!\" he cried. \"The\nonly entrance to this frog-city is from the sea, up through that\nwater-tunnel!\"\n\n\"Good God, an amphibian city!\" Hackett was shaken, white-faced.\n\nThe two boats were driving quickly over the city, through the swarming\ncraft. Norman glimpsed towering buildings that might have been\npalaces, temples, laboratories. They slowed and dipped toward one\nblock-like building not far from the water-tunnel's opening. Armed\nfrog-guards were on its roof, and other boats rested there. The two\ncame to rest and the two captives were jerked out, the guards seizing\nthem.\n\nHalf-dragged and half-floating they were led toward an opening in the\nroof from which a stair led downward. They passed down thus into the\nbuilding's interior, lit by many windows. Norman glimpsed long halls\nending in barred doors, guards here and there. Tube-lines ran along\nthe walls and somewhere machines were throbbing dully. They came at\nlast to a barred door whose guard opened it at the croaking order of\nthe frog-men who held the two, and they were thrust inside, as the\ndoor clanged. They turned, and exclaimed in amazement. The room held\nfully a half-hundred men!\n\nThey were men such as the two fliers had never seen before, like\nhumans except that their skins were a light green instead of the\nnormal white and pink. They were dressed in dark short tunics, and\nkept talking to each other in a tongue quite unintelligible to Norman\nand Hackett. They came closer, flocking curiously around the two men,\nwith a babel of voices quite meaningless to the two. Then one of the\nmen uttered an exclamation, and all turned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe barred door had swung open and a half-dozen frog-guards entered,\nfollowed by two frog-men carrying a square little mechanism from which\ntubing led back out through the door.\n\n\"Norman--these men--\" Hackett was whispering rapidly. \"If there are\nmen in this world too, it may be that--\"\n\n\"Quiet, Hackett--look at what they're doing.\"\n\nThe two frog-men had set their mechanism in place and then croaked out\na brief word or order. Slowly, reluctantly, one of the green men moved\ntoward them. Quickly they removed a metal disk fastened to his arm,\nexposing a small orifice like an unhealed wound. Onto this they\nfastened a suckerlike object from which a transparent tube led back\nthrough the mechanism. The machine hummed and at once a red stream\npulsed through the tube and back through the mechanism. The man to\nwhom it was attached was growing rapidly pale!\n\nNorman, sick with horror, clutched his companion. \"Hackett--these\nfrog-men are sucking his blood from him!\"\n\n\"Good God! And look--they're doing it with another!\"\n\n\"All of these men--kept prisoners to furnish them with blood. It must\nbe the damned creatures' food! And we here with the others--\"\n\nA common horror shook the two. It did not seem to affect the green men\nin the room, though, who advanced to the mechanism one by one with a\nreluctant air as of cows unwilling to be milked. Each was attached to\nthe mechanism by the sucking disk on his arm, and out of each the\nblood poured through the tube. The metal disk was replaced on his arm\nthen and he went back to the others. Norman saw that the frog-men took\nonly from each an amount of blood that they could lose and yet live,\nsince, though each came back pale and weak from the mechanism, they\nwere able to walk.\n\n\"It must be their food--human blood!\" Norman repeated. \"They may have\nthousands on thousands of humans penned up like this, like so many\nherds of cows, and perhaps they live entirely on the life-blood they\nmilk from them. Human cows--God!\"\n\n\"Norman--look--they're calling to us!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe two stiffened. All the others in the room had taken their turn at\nthe blood-sucking mechanism and now the frog-men croaked their order\nto the two fliers. They had forgotten their own predicament in the\nhorror of the scene, but now it became real to them. They backed\nagainst the room's wall, quivering, dangerous.\n\nThe frog-guards came forward to drag them to the machine. A webbed paw\nwas outstretched but Hackett with a wild blow drove the frog-man back\nand downward. The frog-guards leaped, and Norman and Hackett struck\nthem back with all the greater strength the lesser gravitation gave\nthem. The room was in an uproar, the green men shouting hoarsely and\nseeming on the point of rushing to their aid.\n\nBut the menacing force-pistols of the other frog-guards held back the\nshouting men and in moments the two fliers were overpowered by sheer\nweight of frog-bodies. Norman felt himself dragged to the machine.\n\nPain needled his upper arm as an incision was made. He felt the\nsucking-disk attached; then the machine hummed, and a sickening nausea\nswept him as the blood drained from his body. Held tightly by the\nguards he went dizzy, weak, but at last felt the sucker removed and a\nmetal disk fastened over the incision. He was jerked aside and\nHackett, his face deathly white, was dragged into his place. In a\nmoment some of the latter's blood had been pumped from him also.\n\nThe machine was withdrawn, Norman and Hackett were released, and the\nfrog-men, with their black force-pistols watchfully raised, withdrew,\nthe door clanging. The room settled back to quietness, the green men\nstretching in lassitude on the metal bunks around it. The two fliers\ncrouched down near the door, shuddering nausea and weakness still\nholding them.\n\nNorman found that Hackett was laughing weakly. \"To think that\ntwenty-four hours ago I was in New York,\" he half-laughed,\nhalf-sobbed. \"On Earth--Earth--\"\n\nThe other gripped his arm. \"It's horrible, Hackett, I know. But it\nisn't instant death, and we've still a chance to escape. Hell, can\ndamn frog-men keep us here? Where's your nerve, man?\"\n\nA voice beside them made them turn in amazement. \"You are men from\nEarth?\" it asked, in queerly accented English. \"From Earth?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAstonishment held them as they saw who spoke. It was one of the green\nmen in the room, who had settled down by their side. A tall figure\nwith superb muscles and frank, clean countenance, his dark eyes afire\nwith eagerness.\n\n\"English?\" Norman exclaimed. \"You know English--you understand me?\"\n\nThe other showed his teeth in a smile. \"I know, yes. I'm Sarja, and I\nlearned to speak it from Fallas, in my city, before the Ralas caught\nme.\"\n\n\"Fallas--\" Norman repeated, puzzled; then suddenly he flamed. \"By God,\nhe means Fellows!\"\n\n\"Fallas, yes,\" said the other. \"From the sky he fell into our city in\na strange flying-boat that was smashed. He was hurt but we cared for\nhim, and he taught me his speech, which I heard you talking now.\"\n\n\"Then Fellows is in your city now?\" asked Hackett eagerly. \"Where is\nthat?\"\n\n\"Across this sea--back in the hills,\" the other waved. \"It is far from\nthe sea but I was rash one day and came too near the water in my\nflying-boat. The Ralas were out raiding and they saw me, caught me,\nand brought me here. No escape now, until I die.\"\n\n\"The Ralas--you mean these frog-men?\" Norman asked.\n\nSarja nodded. \"Of course. They are the tyrants and oppressors of this\nworld. Our little world is but a tenth or less the size of your great\nEarth which it circles, but it has its lands and rivers, and this one\ngreat fresh-water sea into which the latter empty. In this sea long\nago developed the Ralas, the great frog-men who acquired such\nintelligence and arts that they became lords of this world.\n\n\"Through the centuries, while on the land our races of green men have\nbeen struggling upward, the Ralas have oppressed them. Long ago the\nRalas left all their other cities to build this one great amphibian\ncity at the sea's center. Entrance to it is only by the water-tunnel\nfrom without, and being frog-people entrance thus is easy for them\nsince they can move for many minutes under water, though they drown\nlike any other breathing animal if kept under too long. Humans dare\nnot try to enter it thus by the water-tunnel, since, before they could\nfind it and make their way up through it, they would have drowned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"So the Ralas have ruled from this impregnable amphibian city. Its\ncolossal metal dome is invulnerable to ordinary attack, and though\nsolid and without openings it is always as light beneath the dome here\nas outside, since the Ralas' scientists contrived light-condensers and\nconductors that catch light outside and bring it in to release inside.\nSo when it is day outside the sunlight is as bright here, and when\nnight comes the Earth-light shines here the same as without.\n\n\"From this city their raiding parties have gone out endlessly to swoop\ndown on the cities of us green men. Since we learned to make\nflying-boats like theirs, with molecular-motors, and to make the guns\nlike theirs that fire shells filled with annihilating force, we have\nresisted them stoutly but their raids have not ceased. And always they\nhave brought their prisoners back in to this, their city.\n\n\"Tens of thousands of green men they have prisoned here like us, for\nthe sole purpose of supplying them with blood. For the Ralas live on\nthis blood alone, changing it chemically to fit their own bodies and\nthen taking it into their bodies. It eliminates all necessity for food\nhere for them. Every few days they drain blood from us, and since we\nare well fed and cared for to keep us good blood-producers, we will be\nhere for a long time before we die.\"\n\n\"But haven't you made any attempt to get out of here--to escape?\"\nNorman asked.\n\nSarja smiled. \"Who could escape the city of the Ralas? In all recorded\nhistory it has never been done, for even if by some miracle you got a\nflying-boat, the opening of the water-tunnel that leads outward is\nguarded always.\"\n\n\"Guards or no guards, we're going to try it and not sit here to\nfurnish blood for the Ralas,\" Norman declared. \"Are you willing to\nhelp, to try to get to Fellows and your city?\"\n\nThe green man considered. \"It is hopeless,\" he said, \"but as well to\ndie beneath the force-shells of the Ralas as live out a lifetime here.\nYes, I will help, though I cannot see how you expect to escape even\nfrom this room.\"\n\n\"I think we can manage that,\" Norman told him. \"But first--not a word\nto these others. We can't hope to escape with them all, and there is\nno knowing what one might not betray us to the frog-men.\"\n\nHe went on then to outline to the other two the idea that had come to\nhim. Both exclaimed at the simpleness of the idea, though Sarja\nremained somewhat doubtful. While Hackett slept, weak still from his\nloss of blood, Norman had the green man scratch on the metal floor as\nwell as possible a crude map of the satellite's surface, and found\nthat the city, where Fellows was, seemed some hundreds of miles back\nfrom the sea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile they talked, the sunlight, apparently sourceless, that came\nthrough the heavily barred windows of the room faded rapidly, and dusk\nsettled over the great amphibian city beneath the giant dome, kept\nfrom total darkness by a silvery pervading light that Norman reflected\nmust be the light from Earth's great sphere. With the dusk's coming\nthe activities in the frog-city lessened greatly.\n\nWith dusk, too, frog-guards entered the room bearing long metal\ntroughs filled with a red jellylike substance, that they placed on\nracks along the wall. As the guards withdrew the men in the room\nrushed toward the troughs, elbowing each other aside and striking\neach other to scoop up and eat as much of the red jelly as possible.\nIt was for all the world like the feeding of farm-animals, and Hackett\nand Norman so sickened at the sight that they had no heart to try the\nfood. Sarja, though, had no such scruples and seemed to make a hearty\nmeal at one of the troughs.\n\nAfter the meal the green men sought the bunks and soon were stretched\nin sonorous slumber. It was, Norman reflected, exactly the existence\nof domesticated animals--to eat and sleep and give food to their\nmasters. A deeper horror of the frog-men shook him, and a deeper\ndetermination to escape them. He waited until all in the room were\nsleeping before beckoning to Sarja and Hackett.\n\n\"Quiet now,\" he whispered to them. \"If these others wake they'll make\nsuch a clamor we won't have a chance in the world. Ready, Sarja?\"\n\nThe green man nodded. \"Yes, though I still think such a thing's\nimpossible.\"\n\n\"Probably is,\" Norman admitted. \"But it's the one chance we've got,\nthe immensely greater strength of our Earth-muscle that the frog-men\nmust have forgotten when they put us in here.\"\n\nThey moved silently to the room's great barred door, outside which a\nfrog-guard paced. They waited until he had passed the door and on down\nthe hall, then Norman and Hackett and Sarja grasped together one of\nthe door's vertical bars. It was an inch and a half in thickness, of\nsolid metal, and it seemed ridiculous that any men could bend it by\nthe sheer strength of their muscles.\n\nNorman, though, was relying on the fact that on the second satellite,\nwith its far lesser gravitational influence, their Earth-muscles gave\nthem enormous strength. He grasped the bar, Hackett and Sarja gripping\nit below him, and then at a whispered word they pulled with all their\nforce. The bar resisted and again, with sweat starting on their\nforeheads, they pulled. It gave a little.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey shrank back from it as the guard returned, moving past. Then\ngrasping the bar again they bent all their force once more upon it.\nEach effort saw it bending more, the opening in the door's bars\nwidening. They gave a final great wrench and the bent bar squealed a\nlittle. They shrank back, appalled, but the guard had not heard or\nnoticed. He moved past it on his return along the hall, and no sooner\nwas past it than Norman squeezed through the opening and leaped\nsilently for the great frog-man's back.\n\nIt went down with a wild flurry of waving webbed paws and croaking\ncries, stilled almost instantly by Norman's terrific blows. There was\nsilence then as Hackett and Sarja squeezed out after him, the\nmomentary clamor of the battle having aroused no one.\n\nThe three leaped together toward the stairs. In two great floating\nleaps they were on the floor above, Hackett and Norman dragging Sarja\nbetween them. They were not seen, were sailing in giant steps up\nanother stair, hopes rising high. The last stair--the roof-opening\nabove; and then from beneath a great croaking cry swelled instantly\ninto chorus of a alarmed shouts.\n\n\"They've found the door--the guard!\" panted Hackett.\n\nThey were bursting out onto the roof. Frog-guards were on it who came\nin a hopping rush toward them, force-pistols raised. But a giant leap\ntook Hackett among them, to amaze them for a moment with great\nflailing blows. Sarja had leaped for the nearest flying-boat resting\non the roof, and was calling in a frantic voice to Norman and Hackett.\nNorman was turning toward Hackett, the center of a wild combat, but\nthe latter emerged from it for a brief second to motion him\nfrantically back.\n\n\"No use, Norman--get away--get away!\" he cried hoarsely, frenziedly.\n\n\"Hackett--for God's sake--!\" Norman half-leaped to the other, but an\narm caught him, pulled him desperately onto the boat's surface. It was\nSarja, the long craft flying over the roof beneath his control.\n\n\"They come!\" he panted. \"Too late now--\" Frog-men were pouring up onto\nthe roof from below. Sarja sent the craft rocketing upward, as Hackett\ngestured them away for a last frantic time before going down beneath\nthe frog-men's onslaught.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe roof and the combat on it dropped back and beneath them like a\nstone as their craft ripped across the silvery dusk over the mighty\nfrog-city. They were shooting toward the city's center, toward the\ngreen pool that was the entrance to the water-tunnel, while behind and\nbeneath an increasing clamor of alarm spread swiftly. Norman raged\nfutilely.\n\n\"Hackett--Hackett! We can't leave him--\"\n\n\"Too late!\" Sarja cried. \"We cannot help him but only be captured\nagain. We escape now and come back--come back--\"\n\nThe truth of it pierced Norman's brain even in the wild moment.\nHackett had fought and held back the frog-guards only that they might\nescape. He shouted suddenly.\n\n\"Sarja--the water-tunnel!\" A half-dozen boats with frog-guards on them\nwere rising round it in answer to the alarm!\n\n\"The force-gun!\" cried the green man. \"Beside you--!\"\n\nNorman whirled, glimpsed the long tube on its swivel beside him,\ntrained it on the boats rising ahead as they rocketed nearer. He\nfumbled frantically at a catch at the gun's rear, then felt a stream\nof shells flicking out of it. Two of the boats ahead vanished as the\nshells released their annihilating force, another sagged and fell.\nFrom the remaining three invisible force-shells flicked around them,\nbut in an instant Sarja had whirled the boat through them and down\ninto the water-tunnel!\n\nNorman clung desperately to his seat as the boat flashed down through\nthe waters, and then, as Sarja sent it flying out through the great\ntunnel's waters, glimpsed, close behind, the beams of the three Rala\nboats as they pursued them through the tunnel, overtaking them. Could\nthe force-shells be fired under water? Norman did not know, but\ndesperately he swung the force-gun back as they rushed through the\nwaters, and pressed the catch. An instant later beams and boats behind\nthem in the tunnel vanished.\n\nHis lungs were afire; it seemed that he must open them to the\nstrangling water. The boat was ripping the waters at such tremendous\nspeed that he felt himself being torn from his hold on it. Pain seemed\npoured like molten metal through his chest--he could hold out no\nlonger; and then the boat stabbed up from the waters into clear air!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorman panted, sobbed. Behind them rose the colossal metal dome of the\nfrog-city, gleaming dully in the silvery light that flooded the\nfar-stretching seas. That light poured down from a stupendous silver\ncrescent in the night skies. Norman saw dully the dark outlines on it\nbefore he remembered. Earth! He laughed a little hysterically. Sarja\nwas driving the flying-boat out over the sea and away from the\nfrog-city at enormous speed. At last he glanced back. Far behind them\nlay the great dome and up around it gleaming lights were pouring,\nlights of pursuing Rala boats.\n\n\"We escape,\" Sarja cried, \"the city of the Ralas, from which none ever\nbefore escaped!\"\n\nRemembrance smote Norman. \"Hackett! Held off those frog-men so we\ncould get away--we'll come back for him, by God!\"\n\n\"We come back!\" said Sarja. \"We come back with all the green men of\nthis world to the Ralas' city, yes! I know what Fallas has planned.\"\n\n\"Can you find your way to him--to your city?\" Norman asked.\n\nSarja nodded, looking upward. \"Before the next sun has come and gone\nwe can reach it.\"\n\nThe boat flew onward, and the great dome and the searching lights\naround it dropped beneath the horizon. Norman felt the warm wind\ndrying his drenched garments as they rushed onward. Crouched on the\nboat he gazed up toward the silver crescent of Earth sinking toward\nthe horizon ahead. That meant, he told himself, that the satellite\nturned slowly on its axis as it whirled around Earth. It came to him\nthat its night and day periods must be highly irregular.\n\nWhen the sun climbed from the waters behind them they were flying\nstill over a boundless waste of waters, but soon they sighted on the\nhorizon ahead the thin green line of land. Sarja slowed as they\nreached it, took his bearings, and sent the craft flying onward.\n\nThey passed over a green coastal plain and then over low hills joined\nin long chains and mantled by dense and mighty jungles, towering green\ngrowths of unfamiliar appearance to Norman. He thought he glimpsed,\nmore than once, huge beastlike forms moving in them. He did see twice\nin the jungles great clearings where were fair-sized cities of\nbright-green buildings, a metal tower rising from each. But when he\npointed to them Sarja shook his head.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last, as they passed over another range of hills and came into\nsight of a third green city with its looming tower, the other pointed,\nhis face alight.\n\n\"My city,\" he said. \"Fallas there.\"\n\nFellows! Norman's heart beat faster.\n\nThey shot closer and lower and he saw that the buildings were\nobviously green to lend them a certain protective coloration similar\nto that of the green jungles around them. The tower with its\nsurmounting cage puzzled him though, but before he could ask Sarja\nconcerning it his answer came in a different way. A long metal tube\npoked slowly out of the cage on the tower's top and sent a hail of\nforce-shells flicking around them.\n\n\"They're firing on us!\" Norman cried. \"This can't be your city!\"\n\n\"They see our black boat!\" Sarja exclaimed. \"They think we're Rala\nraiders and unless we let them know they'll shoot us out of the air!\nStand up--wave to them--!\"\n\nBoth Norman and Sarja sprang to their feet and waved wildly to those\nin the tower-cage, their flying-boat drifting slowly forward.\nInstantly the force-shells ceased to hail toward them, and as they\nmoved nearer a sirenlike signal broke from the cage. At once scores of\nflying-boats like their own, but glittering metal instead of black,\nshot up from the city where they had lain until now, and surrounded\nthem.\n\nAs Sarja called in his own tongue to them the green men on the\nsurrounding boats broke into resounding cries. They shot down toward\nthe city, Norman gazing tensely. Great crowds of green men in their\ndark tunics had swarmed out into its streets with the passing of the\nalarm, and their craft and the others came to rest in an open square\nthat was the juncture of several streets.\n\nThe green men that crowded excitedly about Norman and Sarja gave way\nto a half-dozen hurrying into the square from the greatest of the\nbuildings facing on it. All but one were green men like the others.\nBut that one--the laughing-eyed tanned face--the worn brown clothing,\nthe curious huge steps with which he came--Norman's heart leapt.\n\n\"Fellows!\"\n\n\"Great God--Norman!\" The other's face was thunderstruck. \"Norman--how\nby all that's holy did you get here?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorman, mind and body strained to the breaking point, was incoherent.\n\"We guessed how you'd gone--the second satellite, Fellows--Hackett\nand I came after you--taken to that frog-city--\"\n\nAs Norman choked the tale, Fellows' face was a study. And when it was\nfinished he swallowed, and gripped Norman's hand viselike.\n\n\"And you and Hackett figured it out and came after me--took that risk?\nCrazy, both of you. Crazy--\"\n\n\"Fellows, Hackett's still there, if he's alive! In the Rala city!\"\n\nFellows' voice was grim, quick. \"We'll have him out. Norman, if he\nstill lives. And living or dead, the Ralas will pay soon for this and\nfor all they've done upon this world in ages. Their time nears--yes.\"\n\nHe led Norman, excited throngs of the green men about them, into the\ngreat building from which he had emerged. There were big rooms inside,\nworkshops and laboratories that Norman but vaguely glimpsed in\npassing. The room to which the other led him was one with a long metal\ncouch. Norman stretched protestingly upon it at the other's bidding,\ndrifted off almost at once into sleep.\n\nHe woke to find the sunlight that had filled the room gone and\nreplaced by the silvery Earth-light. From the window he saw that the\nsilver-lit city outside now held tremendous activity, immense hordes\nof green men surging through it with masses of weapons and equipment,\nflying-boats pouring down out of the night from all directions. He\nturned as the door of the room clicked open behind him. It was his old\nfriend Fellows.\n\n\"I thought you'd be awake by now, Norman. Feeling fit?\"\n\n\"As though I'd slept a week,\" Norman said, and the other laughed his\nold care-free laugh.\n\n\"You almost have, at that. Two days and nights you've slept, but it\nall adds up to hardly more than a dozen hours.\"\n\n\"This world!\" Norman's voice held all his incredulity. \"To think that\nwe should be on it--a second satellite of Earth's--it seems almost\nbeyond belief.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Sometimes it seems so to me, too,\" Fellows said thoughtfully. \"But\nit's not a bad world--not the human part of it, at least. When this\nsatellite's atmosphere caught me and pitchforked me down among these\ngreen men, smashing the plane and almost myself, they took care of me.\nYou say three others vanished as I did? I never heard of them here;\nthey must have crashed into the sea or jungles. Of course, I'd have\ngot back to Earth on one of these flying-boats if I'd been able, but\ntheir molecular power won't take them far from this world's surface,\nso I couldn't.\n\n\"As it was, the green men cared for me, and when I found how those\nfrog-men have dominated this world for ages, how that city of the\nRalas has spread endless terror among the humans here, I resolved to\nsmash those monsters whatever I did. I taught some of the green men\nlike Sarja my own speech, later learning theirs, and in the weeks I've\nbeen here I've been working out a way to smash the Ralas.\n\n\"You know that amphibian city is almost impregnable because humans can\nhardly live long enough under the water to get into it, let alone\nfight under water as the frog-men can. To meet them on even terms the\ngreen men needed diving-helmets with an oxygen supply. They'd never\nheard of such an idea, too afraid of the sea ever to experiment in it,\nbut I convinced them and they've made enough helmets for all their\nforces. In them they can meet the Ralas under water on equal terms.\n\n\"And there's a chance we can destroy that whole Rala city with their\nhelp. It's built on a giant pedestal of rock rising from the sea's\nfloor, as you saw, and I've had some of the green men make huge\nforce-shells or force-bombs that ought to be powerful enough to split\nthat pedestal beneath the city. If we can get a chance to place those\nbombs it may smash the frog-men forever on this world. But one thing\nis sure: we're going to get Hackett out if he still lives!\"\n\n\"Then you're, going to attack the Rala city now?\" Norman cried.\n\nFellows nodded grimly. \"While you have slept all the forces of the\ngreen men on this world have been gathering. Your coming has only\nprecipitated our plans, Norman--the whole soul of the green races has\nbeen set upon this attack for weeks!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNorman, half bewildered at the swiftness with which events rushed upon\nhim, found himself striding with Fellows in great steps out through\nthe building into the great square. It was shadowed now by mass on\nmass of flying-boats, crowded with green men, that hung over it and\nover the streets. One boat, Sarja at its controls, waited on the\nground and as they entered and buckled themselves into the seats the\ncraft drove up to hang with the others.\n\nA shattering cheer greeted them. Norman saw that in the silvery light\nof Earth's great crescent there stretched over the city and\nsurrounding jungle now a veritable plain of flying-boats. On each were\ngreen men and each bristled with force-guns, and had as many great\ngoggled helmets fastened to it as it had occupants. He glimpsed larger\nboats loaded with huge metal cylinders--the force-bombs Fellows had\nmentioned.\n\nFellows rose and spoke briefly in a clear voice to the assembled green\nmen on their craft, and another great shout roared from them, and from\nthese who watched in the city below. Then as he spoke a word, Sarja\nsent their craft flying out over the city, and the great mass of\nboats, fully a thousand in number, were hurtling in a compact column\nafter them.\n\nFellows leaned to Norman as the great column of purring craft shot on\nover the silver-lit jungles. \"We'll make straight for the Rala city\nand try setting into it before they understand what's happening.\"\n\n\"Won't they have guards out?\"\n\n\"Probably, but we can beat them back into the city before their whole\nforces can come out on us. That's the only way in which we can get\ninside and reach Hackett. And while we're attacking the force-bombs\ncan be placed, though I don't rely too much on them.\"\n\n\"If the attack only succeeds in getting us inside,\" Norman said,\ngrim-lipped, \"we'll have a chance--\"\n\n\"It's on the knees of the gods. These green men are doing an\nunprecedented thing in attacking the Ralas, the masters of this world,\nremember. But they've got ages of oppression to avenge; they'll\nfight.\"\n\nThe fleet flew on, hills and rivers a silver-lit panorama unreeling\nbeneath them. Earth's crescent sank behind them, and by the time they\nflashed out over the great fresh-water sea, the sun was rising like a\nflaming eye from behind it. Land sank from sight behind and the green\nmen were silent, tense, as they saw stretching beneath only the gray\nwaters that for ages had been the base of the dread frog-men. But\nstill the fleet's column raced on.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last the column slowed. Far ahead the merest bulge broke the level\nline where sky and waters met. The amphibian city of the Ralas! At\nFellows' order-the flying-boats sank downward until they moved just\nabove the waters. Another order made the green hosts don the grotesque\nhelmets. Norman found that while cumbersome their oxygen supply was\nunfailing. They shot on again at highest speed, but as the gigantic\nblack dome of the frog-city grew in their vision there darted up from\naround it suddenly a far-flung swarm of black spots.\n\n\"Rala boats!\"\n\nThe muffled exclamation was Fellows'. There needed now no order on his\npart, though. Like hawks, leaping for prey, the fleet of the green men\nsprang through the air. Norman, clutching the force-gun between his\nknees, had time only to see that the Rala craft were a few hundred in\nnumber and that, contemptuous of the greater odds that favored these\nhumans they had so long oppressed, they were flying straight to meet\nthem. Then the two fleets met--and were spinning side by side above\nthe waters.\n\nNorman saw the thing only as a wild whirl of Rala boats toward and\nbeside them, great green frog-men crowding the craft, their force-guns\nhailing shells. Automatically, with the old air-fighting instinct, his\nfingers had pressed the catch of the gun between his knees and as its\nshells flicked toward the rushing boats he saw areas of nothingness\nopening suddenly in their mass, shells striking and exploding in\nannihilating invisibility there and in their own fleet.\n\nThe two fleets mingled and merged momentarily, the battle becoming a\nthing of madness, a huge whirl of black and glittering flying-boats\ntogether, striking shells exploding nothingness about them. The Ralas\nwere fighting like demons.\n\nThe merged, terrific combat lasted but moments; could last but\nmoments. Norman, his gun's magazine empty, seemed to see the mass of\nstruggling ships splittering, diverging; then saw that the black craft\nwere dropping, plummeting downward toward the waves! The Ralas,\nstunned by that minute of terrific combat, were fleeing. Muffled cries\nand cheers came from about him as the glittering flying-boats of the\ngreen men shot after them. They crashed down into the waters and\ncurved deeply into their green-depths, toward the gigantic dome.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAhead the Rala boats were in flight toward their city, and now their\npursuers were like sharks striking after them. There in the depths the\nforce-guns of black and glittering boats alike were spitting, and\ngiant waves and underwater convulsions rocked pursued and pursuers as\nthe exploding shells annihilated boats and water about them. The\ntunnel! Its round opening yawned in the looming wall ahead, and Norman\nsaw the Rala craft, reduced to scores in number, hurtling into it, to\nrouse all the forces of the great amphibian city. Their own boats were\nflashing into the opening after them. He glimpsed as he glanced back\nfor a moment the larger craft with the great force-bombs veering aside\nbehind them.\n\nIt was nightmare in the water-tunnel. Flashing beams of the craft\nahead and waters that rocked and smashed around them as in flight the\nRalas still rained back force-shells toward them in a chaos of action.\nOnce the frog-men turned to hold them back in the tunnel, but by sheer\nweight the rushing ships of the green men crashed them onward. Boats\nwere going into nothingness all around them. A part of Norman's brain\nwondered calmly why they survived even while another part kept his gun\nagain working, with refilled magazine. Fellows and Sarja were\ngrotesque shapes beside him. Abruptly the tunnel curved upward and as\nthey flashed up after the remaining Rala craft their boats ripped up\ninto clear air! They were beneath the giant dome!\n\nThe frog-men chased inward spread out in all directions over their\nmighty, swarming city and across it a terrific clamor of alarm ran\ninstantly as the green men emerged after them! Norman saw flying-boats\nbeginning to rise across all the city and realized that moments would\nsee all the immense force of the Ralas, the thousands of craft they\ncould muster, pouring upon them. He pointed out over the city to a\nblock-like building, and shouted madly through his helmet to Fellows\nand Sarja:\n\n\"Hackett!\"\n\nBut already Sarja had sent their craft whirling across the city toward\nthe structure, half their fleet behind it, with part still emerging\nfrom the water-tunnel. Rala boats rose before them, but nothing could\nstop them now, their force-shells raining ahead to clear a path for\ntheir meteor-flight. They shot down toward the block-structure, and\nNorman, half-crazed by now, saw that to descend and enter was suicide\nin the face of the frog-forces rising now over all the city. He cried\nto Fellows, and with two of the guns as they swooped lower they\nsprayed force-shells along the building's side.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe shells struck and whiffed away the whole side, exposing the level\non the building's interior. Out from it rushed swarms of crazed green\nmen, sweeping aside the frog-men guards, while far over the city the\ninvading craft were loosing shells on the block-like buildings that\nheld the prisoners, tens of thousands of them swarming forth. In the\nthrong below as they raced madly forth Norman saw one, and shouted\nwildly. The one brown garbed figure looked up, saw their boat swooping\nlower, and leaped for it in a tremendous forty-foot spring that\nbrought his fingers to its edge. Norman pulled him frenziedly up.\n\n\"Norman!\" he babbled. \"In God's name--Fellows--!\"\n\n\"That helmet, Hackett!\" Fellows flung at him. \"My God, look at those\nprisoners--Norman!\"\n\nThe countless thousands of green men released from the buildings whose\nwalls had vanished under the shells of the invaders had poured forth\nto make the amphibian city a chaos of madness. Oblivious to all else\nthey were throwing themselves upon the city's crowding frog-men in a\nbattle whose ferocity was beyond belief, disregarding all else in this\nsupreme chance to wreak vengeance on the monstrous beings who had fed\nupon their blood. In the incredible insanity of that raging fury the\ncraft of the green men hanging over the city were all but forgotten.\n\nSuddenly the city and the mighty dome over it quivered violently, and\nthen again. There came from beneath a dull, vast, grinding roar.\n\n\"The great force-bombs!\" Fellows screamed. \"They've set them off--the\ncity's sinking--out of here, for the love of God!\"\n\nThe boat whirled beneath Sarja's hands toward the pool of the\nwater-tunnel, all their fleet rushing with them. The grinding roar was\nlouder, terrible; dome and city were shaking violently now; but in the\ninsensate fury of their struggle the frog-men and their released\nprisoners were hardly aware of it. The whole great dome seemed sinking\nupon them and the city falling beneath it as Sarja's craft ripped down\ninto the tunnel's waters, and then out, at awful speed, as the great\ntunnel's walls swayed and sank around them! They shot out into the\ngreen depths from it to hear a dull, colossal crashing through the\nwaters from behind as the great pedestal of rock on which the city had\nstood, shattered by the huge force-bombs, collapsed. And as their\nboats flashed up into the open air they saw that the huge dome of the\ncity of the Ralas was gone.\n\nBeneath them was only a titanic whirlpool of foaming waters in which\nonly the curved top of the settling dome was visible for a moment as\nit sank slowly and ponderously downward, with a roar as of the roar of\nfalling worlds. Buckling, collapsing, sinking, it vanished in the\nfoam-wild sea with all the frog-men who for ages had ruled the second\nsatellite, and with all those prisoners who had at the last dragged\nthem down with them to death! Ripping off their helmets, with all the\ngreen men shouting crazily about them, Norman and Fellows and Hackett\nstared down at the colossal maelstrom in the waters that was the tomb\nof the masters of a world.\n\nThen the depression's sides collapsed, the waters rushing together ...\nand beneath them was but troubled, tossing sea....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEarth's great gray ball was overhead again and the sun was sinking\nagain to the horizon when the three soared upward in the long,\ngleaming plane, its motor roaring. Norman, with Hackett and Fellows\ncrowding the narrow cabin beside him, waved with them through its\nwindows. For all around them were rising the flying-boats of the green\nmen.\n\nThey were waving wildly, shouting their farewells, Sarja's tall figure\nerect at the prow of one. Insistent they had been that the three\nshould stay, the three through whom the monstrous age-old tyranny of\nthe frog-men had been lifted, but Earth-sickness was on them, and they\nhad flown to where the plane lay still unharmed among the reeds, a\nhundred willing hands dragging it forth for the take-off.\n\nThe plane soared higher, motor thundering, and they saw the\nflying-boats sinking back from around them. They caught the wave of\nSarja's hand still from the highest, and then that, too, was gone.\n\nUpward they flew toward the great gray sphere, their eyes on the dark\noutlines of its continents and on one continent. Higher--higher--green\nland and gray tea receding beneath them; Hackett and Fellows intent\nand eager as Norman kept the plane rising. The satellite lay, a\ngreenish globe, under them. And as they went higher still a rushing\nsound came louder to their ears.\n\n\"The edge of the satellite's atmosphere?\" Fellows asked, as Norman\nnodded.\n\n\"We're almost to it--here we go!\"\n\nAs he shot the plane higher, great forces smote it, gray Earth and\ngreen satellite and yellow sun gyrating round it as it reeled and\nplunged. Then suddenly it was falling steadily, gray Earth and its\ndark continent now beneath, while with a dwindling rushing roar its\nsecond satellite whirled away above them, passing and vanishing.\nPassing as though, to Norman it seemed, all their strange sojourn on\nit were passing; the frog-men and their mighty city, Sarja and their\nmad flight, the green men and the last terrific battle; all whirling\naway--whirling away.\n\n\nHISTORIC EXPERIMENT PROVES EARTH'S ROTATION\n\nThe famous experiment which proves that the \"earth do move\" by letting\nthe observer actually see it twisting underneath his feet, an\nexperiment invented by the French mathematician Jean B. L. Foucault\nnearly a century ago was repeated recently under unusually impressive\ncircumstances before an international scientific congress at Florence,\nItaly, the same city where Galileo once was persecuted for holding the\nsame opinion.\n\nFrom the center of the dome of the Church of Santa Maria di Fiore,\nFather Guido Alfani, director of the Astronomical Observatory,\nsuspended a 200-pound weight on a wire 150 feet long. On the bottom of\nthis weight was a tiny projecting point which traced a line on a\ntable-top sprinkled with sand, as the great pendulum swung slowly back\nand forth. At a given signal Father Alfani set the pendulum to\nswinging. While the assembled scientists watched it, slowly the line\ntraced across the sand table-top changed direction.\n\nAs Foucault proved long ago and as the watching scientists well knew,\nthe table was being twisted underneath the pendulum by the rotation of\nthe earth.\n\n\nA REVOLUTIONARY AIRPLANE\n\nA new airplane propeller has recently been patented by J. Kalmanson of\nBrooklyn, N. Y. Greater speed and marked saving in fuel is claimed for\nthe invention, which may be attached to any type of airplane.\n\nThe device is in two parts, which may be used separately as front and\nrear propellers or combined into a single blade. The principle is that\nthe front one acts to bring air to the other, giving the propeller\nmore of a hold, so to speak, and greater power. This is accomplished\nby four air-spoons, one on each side of each blade of the propeller.\n\nIt is said that the device can double the speed of an airplane and\nraise it from the ground in ninety feet instead of the 200 feet most\nairplanes now require. It is also claimed that the new propeller will\nprevent the plane from making a nose drive unless the pilot forces it\nto do so, and enable it to make a safe landing within a short\ndistance. Because of the increase in power and speed, the device would\nsave a large amount of gasoline and oil, as well as guarding the motor\nfrom part of the strain on it.\n\nThe device is said to be also applicable to ships, the same principle\noperating in water as well as air.\n\n\n\n\nSilver Dome\n\n_By Harl Vincent_\n\n[Illustration: _Orris led the way to a great underground city._]\n\n[Sidenote: In her deep-buried kingdom of Theros, Phaestra reveals the\namazing secret of the Silver Dome.]\n\n\nIn a secluded spot among the hills of northern New Jersey stood the\nold DeBost mansion, a rambling frame structure of many wings and\ngables that was well-nigh hidden from the road by the half-mile or\nmore of second-growth timber which intervened. High on the hill it\nstood, and it was only by virtue of its altitude that an occasional\nglimpse might be obtained of weatherbeaten gable or partly\ntumbled-down chimney. The place was reputed to be haunted since the\ndeath of old DeBost, some seven years previously, and the path which\nhad once been a winding driveway was now seldom trod by human foot.\n\nIt was now two years since Edwin Leland bought the estate for a song\nand took up his residence in the gloomy old house. And it had then\nbeen vacant for five years since DeBost shot himself in the northeast\nbedroom. Leland's associates were sure he would repent of his bargain\nin a very short time, but he stayed on and on in the place, with no\ncompany save that of his man-servant, an aged hunch-back who was\nknown to outsiders only as Thomas.\n\nLeland was a scientist of note before he buried himself in the DeBost\nplace, and had been employed in the New York research laboratory of\none of the large electrical manufacturers, where he was much admired\nand not a little envied by his fellow workers. These knew almost\nnothing of his habits or of his personal affairs, and were much\nsurprised when he announced one day that he had come into a sizable\nfortune and was leaving the organization to go in for private research\nand study. Attempts to dissuade him were of no avail, and the purchase\nof the DeBost property followed, after which Leland dropped from sight\nfor nearly two years.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen, on a blustery winter day, a strange telephone call was received\nat the laboratory where he had previously worked. It was from old\nThomas, out there in the DeBost mansion, and his quavering voice asked\nfor Frank Rowley, the genial young engineer whose work had been most\nclosely associated with Leland's.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Rowley,\" wailed the old man, when Frank responded to the\ncall, \"I wish you would come out here right away. The master has been\nacting very queerly of late, and to-day he has locked himself in his\nlaboratory and will not answer my knocks.\"\n\n\"Why don't you break in the door?\" asked Frank, looking through the\nwindow at the snow storm that still raged.\n\n\"I thought of that, Mr. Rowley, but it is of oak and very thick.\nBesides, it is bound with steel or iron straps and is beyond my\npowers.\"\n\n\"Why not call the police?\" growled Frank. He did not relish the idea\nof a sixty or seventy mile drive in the blizzard.\n\n\"Oh--no--no--no!\" Old Thomas was panicky at the suggestion. \"The\nmaster told me he'd kill me if I ever did that.\"\n\nBefore Frank could formulate a reply, there came a sharp gasp from the\nother end of the line, a wailing cry and a thud as of a falling body;\nthen silence. All efforts to raise Leland's number merely resulted in\n\"busy\" or \"line out of order\" reports.\n\nFrank Rowley was genuinely concerned. Though he had never been a close\nfriend of Leland's, the two had worked on many a knotty problem\ntogether and were in daily contact during the nearly ten years that\nthe other man had worked in the same laboratory.\n\n\"Say, Tommy,\" said Frank, replacing the receiver and turning to his\nfriend, Arnold Thompson, who sat at an adjoining desk, \"something has\nhappened out at Leland's place in Sussex County. Want to take a drive\nout there with me?\"\n\n\"What? On a day like this? Why not take the train?\"\n\n\"Don't be foolish, Tommy,\" said Frank. \"The place is eight miles from\nthe nearest station, which is a flag stop out in the wilds. And, even\nif you could find a cab there--which you couldn't--there isn't a taxi\ndriver in Jersey who'd take you up into those mountains on a day like\nthis. No, we'll have to drive. It'll be okay. I've got chains on the\nrear and a heater in the old coupe, so it shouldn't be so bad. What do\nyou say?\"\n\nSo Tommy, who usually followed wherever Frank led, was prevailed upon\nto make the trip. He had no particular feeling for Leland, but he\nsensed an adventure, and, in Frank's company, he could ask for no\nmore.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrank was a careful driver, and three hours were required to make the\nsixty-mile journey. Consequently, it was late in the afternoon when\nthey arrived at the old DeBost estate. It had stopped snowing, but the\ndrifts were deep in spots, and Frank soon found that the car could not\nbe driven through the winding path from the road to the house. So\nthey left it half buried in a drift and proceeded on foot.\n\nIt was a laborious task they had undertaken, and, by the time they set\nfoot on the dilapidated porch, even Frank, husky and athletic as was\nhis build, was puffing and snorting from his exertions. Little Tommy,\nwho tipped the scales at less than a hundred and twenty, could hardly\nspeak. They both were wet to the waist and in none too good humor.\n\n\"Holy smoke!\" gasped Tommy, stamping the clinging snow from his sodden\ntrouser legs and shoes, \"if it snows any more, how in Sam Hill are we\ngoing to get out of this place?\"\n\n\"Rotten trip I let you in for Tommy,\" growled Frank, \"and I hope\nLeland's worth it. But, darn it all, I just had to come.\"\n\n\"It's all right with me, Frank. And maybe it'll be worth it yet.\nLook--the front door's open.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe pointed to the huge oaken door and Frank saw that it was ajar. The\nsnow on the porch was not deep and they saw that footprints led from\nthe open door to a corner of the porch. At that point the snow on the\nrailing was disturbed, as if a hurrying man had clung to it a moment\nbefore jumping over and into the drifts below. But the tracks led no\nfurther, for the drifting snow had covered all excepting a hollow\nwhere some body had landed.\n\n\"Thomas!\" exclaimed Frank. \"And he was in a hustle, by the looks of\nthe tracks. Bet he was frightened while at the telephone and beat it.\"\n\nThey entered the house and closed the door behind them. It was growing\nquite dark and Frank searched for the light switch. This was near the\ndoor, and, at pressure on the upper button, the spacious old hall with\nits open staircase was revealed dimly by the single remaining bulb in\na cluster set in the center of the high ceiling. The hall was\nunfurnished, excepting for a telephone table and chair, the chair\nhaving fallen to the floor and the receiver of the telephone dangling\nfrom the edge of the table by its cord.\n\n\"You must have heard the chair fall,\" commented Tommy, \"and it sure\ndoes look as if Thomas left in a hurry. Wonder what it was that\nfrightened him?\"\n\nThe house was eerily silent and the words echoed awesomely through the\nadjoining rooms which connected with the hall through large open\ndoorways.\n\n\"Spooky place, isn't it?\" returned Frank.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then they were both startled into immobility by a rumble that\nseemed to shake the foundations of the house. Heavier and heavier\nbecame this vibration, as if some large machine was coming up to\nspeed. Louder and louder grew the rumble until it seemed that the\nrickety old house must be shaken down about their ears. Then there\ncame a whistling scream from the depths of the earth--from far\nunderground it seemed to be--and this mounted in pitch until their\neardrums tingled. Then abruptly the sounds ceased, the vibration\nstopped, and once more there was the eery silence.\n\nRather white-faced, Tommy gazed at Frank.\n\n\"No wonder old Thomas beat it!\" he said. \"What on earth do you suppose\nthat is?\"\n\n\"Search me,\" replied Frank. \"But whatever it is, I'll bet it has\nsomething to do with Leland's strange actions. And we're going to find\nout.\"\n\nHe had with him the large flashlamp from the car, and, by its light,\nthe two made their way from room to room searching for the iron-bound\ndoor mentioned by Thomas.\n\nThey found all rooms on the first and second floors dusty and unused\nwith the exception of two bedrooms, the kitchen and pantry, and the\nlibrary. It was a gloomy and spooky old house. Floor boards creaked\nstartlingly and unexpectedly and the sound of their footsteps echoed\ndismally.\n\n\"Where in time is that laboratory of Leland's?\" exclaimed Frank, his\nruddy features showing impatient annoyance, exaggerated to an\nappearance of ferocity by the light of the flashlamp.\n\n\"How about the cellar?\" suggested Tommy.\n\n\"Probably where it is,\" agreed Frank, \"but I don't relish this job so\nmuch. I'd hate to find Leland stiff down there, if that's where he\nis.\"\n\n\"Me, too,\" said Tommy. \"But we're here now, so let's finish the job\nand get back home. It's cold here, too.\"\n\n\"You said it. No steam in the pipes at all. He must have let the fire\ngo out in his furnace, and that's probably in the cellar too--usually\nis.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile talking, Frank had opened each of the four doors that opened\nfrom the kitchen, and the fourth revealed a stairway that led into the\nblackness beneath. With the beam of his torch directed at the steps,\nhe proceeded to descend, and Tommy followed carefully. There was no\nlight button at the head of the stairs, where it would have been\nplaced in a more modern house, and it was not until they had reached\nthe furnace room that they located a light fixture with a pull cord.\nAn ordinary cellar, with furnace, coal bin, and a conglomeration of\ndust-covered trunks and discarded furniture, was revealed. And, at its\nfar end, was the iron-bound door.\n\nThe door was locked and could not be shaken by the combined efforts of\nthe two men.\n\n\"Have to have a battering ram,\" grunted Frank, casting about for a\nsuitable implement.\n\n\"Here you are,\" called Tommy, after a moment's search. \"Just the thing\nwe are looking for.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe had come upon a pile of logs, and one of these, evidently a section\nof an old telephone pole, was of some ten or twelve inches diameter\nand about fifteen feet long. Frank pounced upon it eagerly, and,\nsupporting most of the weight himself, led the attack on the heavy\noak door with the iron bands.\n\nNo sound from within greeted the thunderous poundings. Clearly, if\nLeland was behind that door, he was either dead or unconscious.\n\nFinally the double lock gave way and Tommy and Frank were precipitated\nheadlong into the brightly lighted room beyond. Recovering their\nbalance, they took stock of their surroundings and were amazed at what\nthey saw--a huge laboratory, fitted out with every modern appliance\nthat money could buy. A completely equipped machine shop there was;\nbench after bench covered with the familiar paraphernalia of the\nchemical and physical laboratory; huge retorts and stills; complicated\nelectrical equipments; dozens of cabinets holding crucibles, flasks,\nbottles, glass tubing, and what not.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" gasped Tommy. \"Here's a laboratory to more than match our\nown. Why, Leland's got a fortune invested here!\"\n\n\"I should say so. And a lot of stuff that our company does not even\nhave. Some of it I don't know even the use of. But where is Leland?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no sign of the man they had come to help. He was not in the\nlaboratory, though the door had been locked from within and the lights\nleft burning throughout.\n\nWith painstaking care they searched every nook and cranny of the large\nsingle room and were about to give up in despair when Tommy happened\nto observe an ivory button set into the wall at the only point in the\nroom where there were no machines or benches at hand. Experimentally\nhe pressed the button, and, at the answering rumble from under his\nfeet, jumped back in alarm. Slowly there opened in the paneled oak\nwall a rectangular door, a door of large enough size to admit a man.\nFrom the recess beyond there came a breath of air, foul with the\nmusty odor of decayed vegetation, dank as the air of a tomb.\n\n\"Ah-h-h!\" breathed Frank. \"So that is where Ed Leland is hiding! The\nsecret retreat of the gloomy scientist!\"\n\nHe spoke half jestingly, yet when he squeezed his stalwart bulk\nthrough the opening and flashed the beam of his light into the\ndarkness of a narrow passage ahead he was assailed with vague\nforebodings. Tommy followed close behind and spoke not a word.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe passage floor was thick with dust, but the marks of many footsteps\ngoing and returning gave mute evidence of the frequency of Leland's\nvisits. The air was heavy and oppressive and the temperature and\nhumidity increased as they progressed along the winding length of the\nrock-walled passageway. The floor sloped, ever downward and, in spots,\nwas slippery with slimy seepage. It seemed that they turned back on\ntheir course on several occasions but were descending deeper and\ndeeper into the heart of the mountain. Then, abruptly, the passage\nended at the mouth of a shaft, which dropped vertically from almost\nbeneath their feet.\n\n\"Whew!\" exclaimed Frank. \"Another step and I'd have dropped into it.\nThat's probably what happened to Leland.\"\n\nHe knelt at the rim of the circular opening and looked into the depths\nof the pit, Tommy following suit. The feeble ray of the flashlight was\nlost in the blackness below.\n\n\"Say, Frank,\" whispered Tommy, \"turn off the flash. I think I saw a\nlight down there.\"\n\nAnd, with the snapping of the catch, there came darkness. But, miles\nbelow them, it seemed, there was a tiny pin-point of brilliance--an\neery green light that was like a wavering phosphorescence of\nwill-o'-the-wisp. For a moment it shone and was gone. Then came the\ndreadful vibration they had experienced in the hall of the house--the\nwhistling scream that grew louder and louder until it seemed they\nmust be deafened. The penetrating wail rose from the depths of the\npit, and the vibration was all around them, in the damp rock floor on\nwhich they knelt, and in the very air of the cavern. Hastily Frank\nsnapped on the light of his flash.\n\n\"Oh boy!\" he whispered. \"Leland is certainly up to something down\nthere and no mistake! How're we going to get down?\"\n\n\"Get down?\" asked Tommy. \"You don't want to go down there, do you?\"\n\n\"Sure thing. We're this far now and, by George, we're going to find\nout all there is to learn.\"\n\n\"How deep do you suppose it is?\"\n\n\"Pretty deep, Tommy. But we can get an idea by dropping a stone and\ncounting the seconds until it strikes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe played the light of the flash over the floor and soon located a\nsmooth round stone of the size of a baseball. This he tossed over the\nrim of the pit and awaited results.\n\n\"Good grief!\" exclaimed Tommy. \"It's not falling!\"\n\nWhat he said was true, for the stone poised lightly over the opening\nand drifted like a feather. Then slowly it moved, settling gradually\ninto oblivion. Frank turned the flash downward and they watched in\nastonishment as the two-pound pebble floated deliberately down the\ncenter of the shaft at the rate of not more than one foot in each\nsecond.\n\n\"Well, I'll be doggoned,\" breathed Frank admiringly. \"Leland has done\nit. He has conquered gravity. For, in that pit at least, there is no\ngravity, or at any rate not enough to mention. It has been almost\ncompletely counteracted by some force he has discovered and now we\nknow how to follow him down there. Come on Tommy, let's go!\"\n\nAnd, suiting action to his words, Frank jumped into the mouth of the\npit where he bobbed about for a moment as if he had jumped into a\npool of water. Then slowly he sank from view, and Tommy followed him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a most unique experience, that drop into the heart of the\nmountain. Practically weightless, the two young men found it quite\ndifficult to negotiate the passage. For the first hundred or more feet\nthey continued to bump about in the narrow shaft and each sustained\npainful bruises before he learned that the best and simplest method of\naccommodating himself to the strange condition was to remain\nabsolutely motionless and allow the greatly weakened gravity to take\nits course. Each movement of an arm or leg was accompanied by a change\nin direction of movement, and contact with the hard stone walls\nfollowed. If they endeavored to push themselves from the contact the\nresult was likely to be an even more serious bump on the opposite side\nof the shaft. So they continued the leisurely drop into the unknown\ndepth of the pit.\n\nFrank had turned off the flashlamp, for its battery was giving out and\nhe wished to conserve its remaining energy for eventualities. Thus\nthey were in Stygian darkness for nearly a half-hour, though the green\nluminosity far beneath them grew stronger with each passing minute. It\nnow revealed itself as a clearly defined disc of light that flickered\nand sputtered continually, frequently lighting the lower end of the\nshaft with an unusual burst of brilliance. Remotely distant it seemed\nthough, and unconscionably slow in drawing nearer.\n\n\"How far do you think we must drop?\" called Tommy to Frank, who was\nprobably fifty feet below him in the shaft.\n\n\"Well, I figure we have fallen about a thousand feet so far,\" came the\nreply, \"and my guess is that we are about one third of the way down.\"\n\n\"Then this shaft is over a half-mile deep, you think?\"\n\n\"Yes, at least a thousand yards, I should say. And I hope his gravity\nneutralizing machinery doesn't quit all of a sudden and let us down.\"\n\n\"Me, too,\" called Tommy, who had not thought of that possibility.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis was no joke, this falling into an unknown region so far beneath\nthe surface of good old mother earth, thought Tommy. And how they\nwould ever return was another thing that was not so funny. Frank was\nalways rushing into things like this without counting the possible\ncost and--well--this might be the last time.\n\nGradually the mysterious light became stronger and soon they could\nmake out the conformation of the rock walls they were passing at such\na snail's pace. Layers of vari-colored rock showed here and there,\nand, at one point there was a stratum of gold-bearing or mica-filled\nrock that glistened with a million reflections and re-reflections. The\nair grew warmer and more humid as they neared the mysterious light\nsource. They moved steadily, without acceleration, and Frank estimated\nthe rate at about forty feet a minute. Then, with blinding suddenness,\nthe light was immediately below and they drifted into a tremendous\ncavern that was illuminated by its glow.\n\nDirectly beneath the lower end of the shaft through which they had\npassed, there was a glowing disc of metal about fifteen feet in\ndiameter. They drifted to its surface and sprawled awkwardly where\nthey fell. Scrambling to gain a footing, they bounced and floated\nabout like toy balloons before realizing that it would be necessary to\ncreep slowly from the influence of that repelling force which had made\nthe long drop possible without injury. Gravity met them at the disc's\nedge with what seemed to be unusual violence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt first it seemed that their bodies weighed twice the normal amount,\nbut this feeling soon passed and they looked about them with\nincredulous amazement. The metal disc was quite evidently the medium\nthrough which the repelling force was set up in the shaft, and to this\ndisc was connected a series of heavy cables that led to a pedestal\nnearby. On the pedestal was a controlling lever and this moved over a\nquadrant that was graduated in degrees, one end of the quadrant being\nlabeled \"Up\" and the other \"Down.\" The lever now stood at a point but\na very few degrees from the center or \"Zero\" mark and on the down\nside. Frank pulled this lever over to the full \"Down\" position and\nthey found that they could walk over the disc with normal gravity.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Frank, \"that if the lever is at the other end of the\nscale one would fall upward with full gravity acceleration--reversed.\nAt zero, gravity is exactly neutralized, and the intermediate\npositions are useful in conveying materials or human beings up and\ndown the shaft as desired. Very clever; but what is the reason for it\nall?\"\n\nIn the precise center of the great cavern there was a dome or\nhemisphere of polished metal, and it was from this dome that the eery\nlight emanated. At times, when the light died down, this dome gleamed\nwith dull flickerings that threatened to vanish entirely. Then\nsuddenly it would resume full brilliance, and the sight was marvelous\nbeyond description. A slight hissing sound came from the direction of\nthe dome, and this varied in intensity as did the light.\n\n\"Gosh!\" said Tommy. \"That looks like silver to me. And, if it is, what\na wealthy man our friend Leland has become. He has spent his fortune\nwell, even if he used it all to get to this.\"\n\n\"Yes, but where is he?\" commented Frank. Then: \"Leland! Leland!\" he\ncalled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis voice echoed through the huge vault and re-echoed hollowly. But\nthere was no reply save renewed flickerings from the dome.\n\nLeaving the vicinity of the gravity disc, the two men advanced in the\ndirection of the shining dome, which was about a quarter-mile from\nwhere they stood. Both perspired freely, for the air was very close\nand the temperature high. But the light of the dome was as cold as the\nlight of a firefly and they had no hesitancy in drawing near. It was a\nbeautiful sight, this dome of silver with its flickering lights and\nperfect contour.\n\n\"By George, I believe it _is_ silver,\" exclaimed Frank, when they were\nwithin a few feet of the dome. \"No other metal has that precise color.\nAnd look! There is a wheelbarrow and some mining tools. Leland has\nbeen cutting away some of the material.\"\n\nSure enough, there was indisputable evidence of the truth of his\nstatement. And the material was undoubtedly silver!\n\n\"Silver Dome,\" breathed Tommy, holding a lump of the metal in his\nhand. \"A solid dome of pure silver--fifty feet high and a hundred in\ndiameter. How much does that figure in dollars and cents, Frank?\"\n\n\"Maybe it isn't solid,\" said Frank dryly, \"though it's worth a\nsizeable fortune even if it is hollow. And we haven't found Leland.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey circled the dome twice and looked into every corner of the great\ncavern, but there was no sign of the man for whom they searched. The\nwheelbarrow was half filled with lumps of the heavy metal, and maul\nand drill lay where they had been dropped by the lone miner. A cavity\nthree feet across, and as many deep, appeared in the side of the dome\nto show that considerably more than one wheelbarrow load had been\nremoved.\n\n\"Funny,\" grunted Tommy. \"Seems almost like the old dome had swallowed\nhim up.\"\n\nAt his words there came the terrific vibration. The light of the dome\ndied out, leaving them in utter darkness, and from its interior there\nrose the mounting scream that had frightened old Thomas away. From so\nclose by it was hideous, devastating; and the two men clung to each\nother in fright, expecting momentarily that the earth would give way\nbeneath their feet and precipitate them into some terrible depth from\nwhich there could be no return.\n\nThen the sound abruptly ceased and a gleam of light came from under\nthe dome of silver. A crack appeared between its lower edge and the\nrocky floor of the cavern, and through this crack there shone a light\nof dazzling brilliancy--a warm light of rosy hue. Wider grew the\nopening until there was a full three feet between the floor and the\nbottom of the dome. Impelled by some irresistible force from within,\nthe two men stumbled blindly to the opening, fell to the floor and\nrolled inside.\n\nThere was a heavy thud and the dome had returned to its normal\nposition, with Frank and Tommy prisoners within its spacious hollow.\nThe warm light bathed them with fearful intensity for a moment, then\nfaded to a rosy glow that dulled their senses and quieted their\nnerves. Morpheus claimed them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Frank awoke he found himself between silken covers, and for a\nmoment he gazed thoughtfully at a high arched ceiling that was\nentirely unfamiliar. Then, remembering, he sprang from the downy bed\nto his feet. The room, the furnishings, his silken robe, everything\nwas strange. His bed, he saw, was a high one, and the frame was of the\nsame gleaming silver as the dome under which they had been trapped.\nThe arched ceiling glowed softly with the same rosy hue as had the\ninner surface of the dome. A large pool of water invited him, the\nsurface of the pool being no more than a foot below the point where it\nwas built into the tile floor of the room. A large open doorway\nconnected with a similar adjoining room, where he suspected Tommy had\nbeen taken. On his bare toes, he moved silently to the other room and\nsaw that his guess had been correct. Tommy lay sleeping quietly\nbeneath covers as soft as his own and amidst equal luxury of\nsurroundings.\n\n\"Well,\" he whispered, \"this doesn't look as though we would come to\nany harm. And I might as well take a dive in that pool.\"\n\nReturning to his own room, he removed the silken garment with which he\nhad been provided and was quietly immersed in the cool, invigorating\nwater of the bath. His head cleared instantly.\n\n\"Hi there!\" called Tommy from the doorway. \"Why didn't you wake me up?\nWhere are we, anyway?\"\n\nWith dripping head and shoulders above the water, Frank was compelled\nto laugh at the sleepy-eyed, wondering expression on the blue-jowled\nface of his friend. \"Thought you were dead to the world,\" he returned,\n\"you old sleepy-head. And I don't know where we are, excepting that it\nis somewhere under the silver dome. What's more, I don't much care.\nYou should get into this water. It's great!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo saying, he dived to the bottom of the pool and stood on his hands,\nhis feet waving ludicrously above the surface. Tommy sniffed once and\nthen made a quick dash for the pool in his own room. He was not to be\noutdone by his more energetic partner.\n\nA half-hour later, shaved and attired in their own garments, which had\nbeen cleaned and pressed and hung neatly in the closets, they settled\nthemselves for a discussion of the situation. Having tried the doors\nof both rooms and found them locked from the outside, there was no\nother course open to them. They must await developments.\n\n\"Looks like Leland has quite an establishment down here inside the\nmountain,\" ventured Tommy.\n\n\"Hm!\" snorted Frank, \"this place is none of Leland's work. He is\nprobably a prisoner here, as are we. He just stumbled on to the\nsilver dome and was captured by whatever race is living down here\nbeneath it, the same as we were. Who the real inhabitants are, and\nwhat the purpose of all this is, remains to be seen.\"\n\n\"You think we are in friendly hands?\"\n\n\"These quarters do not look much like prison cells, Tommy, but I must\nadmit that we are locked in. Anyhow, I'm not worrying, and we will\nsoon learn our fate and have to be ready to meet it. The people who\nown this place must have everything they want, and they sure have some\nscientific knowledge that is not known to us on the surface.\"\n\n\"Wonder if they are humans?\"\n\n\"Certainly they are. You never heard of wild beasts sleeping in beds\nlike these, did you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy laughed at he examined the exquisite hand-wrought figures on the\nsilver bedstead. \"No, I didn't,\" he admitted; \"but where on earth did\nthey come from, and what are they doing here?\"\n\n\"You ask too many questions,\" replied Frank, shrugging his broad\nshoulders. \"We must simply wait for the answers to reveal themselves.\"\n\nThere was a soft rap at the door of Frank's room, where the two men\nwere talking.\n\n\"Come in,\" called Frank, chuckling at the idea of such consideration\nfrom their captors.\n\nA key rattled in the lock and the door swung open to admit the\nhandsomest man they had ever set eyes on. He was taller than Frank by\nseveral inches, standing no less than six feet five in his thin-soled\nsandals, and he carried himself with the air for an emperor. His\nmarble-white body was uncovered with the exception of a loin cloth of\nsilver hue, and lithe muscles rippled beneath his smooth skin as he\nadvanced to meet the prisoners. His head, surmounted by curly hair of\nebon darkness, was large, and his forehead high. The features were\nclassic and perfectly regular. The corners of his mouth drew upward in\na benign smile.\n\n\"Greetings,\" he said, in perfect English and in a soft voice, \"to the\ndomain of Theros. You need fear no harm from our people and will be\nreturned to the upper world when the time comes. We hope to make your\nstay with us enjoyable and instructive, and that you will carry back\nkind memories of us. The morning meal awaits you now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo taken aback were the two young Americans that they stared foolishly\nagape for a space. Then a tinkling laugh from the tall stranger set\nthem once more at ease.\n\n\"You will pardon us, I hope,\" apologized Frank, \"but this is all so\nunexpected and so unbelievable that your words struck me speechless.\nAnd I know that my friend was similarly affected--We place ourselves\nin your hands.\"\n\nThe handsome giant nodded understanding. \"No offense was taken,\" he\nmurmured, \"since none was intended. And your feelings are not to be\nwondered at. You may call me Orrin.\"\n\nHe turned toward the open door and signified that they were to follow\nhim. They fell in at his side with alacrity, both suddenly realizing\nthat they were very hungry.\n\nThey followed in silent wonderment as Orrin led the way to a broad\nbalcony that overlooked a great underground city--a city lighted by the\nsoft glow from some vast lighting system incorporated in its vaulted\nceiling high overhead. The balcony was many levels above the streets,\nwhich were alive with active beings of similar appearance to Orrin,\nthese speeding hither and yon by means of the many lanes of traveling\nways of which the streets were composed. The buildings--endless rows of\nthem lining the orderly streets--were octagonal in shape and rose to\nthe height of about twenty stories, as nearly as could be judged by\nearthly standards. There were no windows, but at about every fifth floor\nthere was an outer silver-railed balcony similar to the one on which\nthey walked. The air was filled with bowl-shaped flying ships that sped\nover the roof tops in endless procession and without visible means of\nsupport or propulsion. Yet the general effect of the busy scene was one\nof precise orderliness, unmarred by confusion or distracting noises.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOrrin vouchsafed no explanations and they soon reentered the large\nbuilding of which the balcony was a part. Here they were conducted to\na sumptuously furnished dining room where their breakfast awaited\nthem.\n\nDuring the meal, which consisted of several courses of fruits and\ncereals entirely strange to Frank and Tommy, they were tended by Orrin\nwith the utmost deference and most painstaking attention. He\nanticipated their every want and their thoughts as well. For, when\nFrank endeavored to ask one of the many questions with which his mind\nwas filled, he was interrupted by a wave of the hand and a smile from\ntheir placid host.\n\n\"It is quite clear to me that you have many questions to propound,\"\nsaid Orrin, \"and this is not a matter of wonder. But it is not\npermitted that I enlighten you on the points you have in mind. You\nmust first finish your meal. Then it is to be my privilege to conduct\nyou to the presence of Phaestra, Empress of Theros, who will reveal\nall. May I ask that you be patient until then?\"\n\nSo friendly was his smile and so polished his manner that they\nrestrained their impatience and finished the excellent breakfast in\npolite silence.\n\nAnd Orrin was as good as his word, for, no sooner had they finished\nwhen he led them from the room and showed the way to the elevator\nwhich conveyed them to the upper floor of the building.\n\nFrom the silver-grilled cage of the lift they stepped into a room of\nsuch beauty and magnificence of decoration that they gazed about them\nin wondering admiration. The paneling and mouldings were of hammered\nsilver that gleamed with polished splendor in the soft rose glow of\nthe hidden lights. The hangings were of heavy plush of deep green hue\nand bore intricate designs of silver thread woven into the material.\nAt the opposite side of the room there was a pair of huge double doors\nof chased silver and on either side of this pretentious portal there\nstood an attendant attired as was Orrin, but bearing a silver scepter\nto denote his official capacity.\n\n\"Phaestra awaits the visitors from above,\" intoned one of the\nattendants. Both bowed stiffly from the waist when Orrin led the two\nyoung scientists through the great doors which had opened silently and\nmajestically at their approach.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIf the outer room was astonishing in its sumptuousness of decoration\nand furnishing, the one they now entered was positively breath-taking.\nOn every side there were the exquisite green and silver hangings.\nTables, divans, and rugs of priceless design and workmanship. But the\nbeauty of the surroundings faded into insignificance when they saw the\nempress.\n\nA canopied dais in the center of the room drew their attention and\nthey saw that Phaestra had risen from her seat in a deeply cushioned\ndivan and now stood at its side in an attitude of welcome. Nearly as\ntall as Frank, she was a figure of commanding and imperious beauty.\nThe whiteness of her body was accentuated by the silver embroidered\nand tightly fitted black vestments that covered yet did not conceal\nits charms. A halo of glorious golden hair surmounted a head that was\npoised expectantly alert above the perfectly rounded shoulders. The\nexquisite oval of her face was chiseled in features of transcendent\nloveliness. She spoke, and, at sound of her musical voice, Frank and\nTommy were enslaved.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Gentlemen of the upper world,\" she said gently, \"you are welcome to\nTheros. Your innermost thoughts have been recorded by our scientists\nand found good. With a definite purpose in mind, you learned of the\nexistence of the silver dome of Theros, yet you came without greed or\nmalice and we have taken you in to enlighten you on the many questions\nthat are in your minds and to return you to mankind with a knowledge\nof Theros--which you must keep secret. You are about to delve into a\nmystery of the ages; to see and learn many things that are beyond the\nken of your kind. It is a privilege never before accorded to beings\nfrom above.\"\n\n\"We thank you, oh, Queen,\" spoke Frank humbly, his eyes rivetted to\nthe gaze of those violet orbs that seemed to see into his very soul.\nTommy mumbled some commonplace.\n\n\"Orrin--the sphere!\" Phaestra, slightly embarrassed by Frank's stare,\nclapped her hands.\n\nAt her command, Orrin, who had stood quietly by, stepped to the wall\nand manipulated some mechanism that was hidden by the hangings. There\nwas a musical purr from beneath the floor, and, through a circular\nopening which appeared as if by magic, there rose a crystal sphere of\nsome four feet in diameter. Slowly it rose until it reached the level\nof their eyes and there it came to rest. The empress raised her hands\nas if in invocation and the soft glow of the lights died down, leaving\nthem in momentary darkness. There came a slight murmur from the\nsphere, and it lighted with the eery green flickerings they had\nobserved in the dome of silver.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFascinated by the weaving lights within, they gazed into the depths of\nthe crystal with awed expectancy. Phaestra spoke.\n\n\"Men from the surface,\" she said, \"you, Frank Rowley, and you, Arnold\nThompson, are about to witness the powers of that hemisphere of metal\nyou were pleased to term 'Silver Dome.' As you rightly surmised, the\ndome is of silver--mostly. There are small percentages of platinum,\niridium, and other elements, but it is more than nine-tenths pure\nsilver. To you of the surface the alloy is highly valuable for its\nintrinsic worth by your own standards, but to us the value of the dome\nlies in its function in revealing to us the past and present events of\nour universe. The dome is the 'eye' of a complicated apparatus which\nenables us to see and hear any desired happening on the surface of the\nearth, beneath its surface, or on the many inhabited planets of the\nheavens. This is accomplished by means of extremely complex vibrations\nradiated from the hemisphere, these vibrations penetrating earth,\nmetals, buildings, space itself, and returning to our viewing and\nsound reproducing spheres to reveal the desired past or present\noccurrences at the point at which the rays of vibrations are directed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"In order to view the past on our own planet, the rays, which travel\nat the speed of light, are sent out in a huge circle through space,\nreturning to earth after having spent the requisite number of years in\ntransit. Instantaneous effect is secured by a connecting beam that\nties together the ends of the enormous arc. This, of course, is beyond\nyour comprehension, since the Ninth Dimension is involved. When it is\ndesired that events of the present be observed, the rays are projected\ndirect. The future can not be viewed, since, in order to accomplish\nthis, it would be necessary that the rays travel at a speed greater\nthan that of light, which is manifestly impossible.\"\n\n\"Great guns!\" gasped Frank. \"This crystal sphere then, is capable of\nbringing to our eyes and ears the happenings of centuries past?\"\n\n\"It is, my dear Frank,\" said Phaestra, \"and I would that I were able\nto describe the process more clearly.\" She smiled, and in the\nunearthly light of the sphere she appeared more beautiful than before,\nif such a thing were possible.\n\nOn the pedestal which supported the sphere there was a glittering\narray of dials and levers. Several of these controls were now adjusted\nby Phaestra, the delicate motions of her tapered fingers being watched\nby the visitors with intense admiration. There came a change in the\nnote of the sphere, a steadying of the flickerings within.\n\n\"Behold!\" exclaimed Phaestra.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey gazed into the depths of the sphere and lost all sense of\ndetachment from the scene depicted therein. It seemed they were at a\npoint several thousand miles from the surface of a planet. A great\ncontinent spread beneath them, its irregular shore line being clearly\noutlined against a large body of water. Here and there the surface was\nobscured by great white patches of clouds that cast their shadows\nbelow.\n\n\"Atlantis!\" breathed Phaestra reverently.\n\nThe lost continent of mythology! The fabled body of land that was\nengulfed by the Atlantic thousands of years ago--a fact!\n\nTommy glanced at Frank, noting that he had withdrawn his gaze from the\nsphere and was devouring Phaestra with his eyes. As if drawn by the\nardor of his observation, she raised her own eyes from the sphere to\nmeet those of the handsome visitor. Obviously confused, she dropped\nher long lashes and turned nervously to the controls. Tommy\nexperienced a sudden feeling of dread. Surely his pal was not falling\nin love with this Theronian empress!\n\nThen there came another change in the note of the sphere and once more\nthey lost themselves in contemplation of the scene within. The surface\nof the lost continent was rushing madly to meet them. With terrific\nvelocity they seemed to be falling. An involuntary gasp was forced\nfrom Tommy's lips. Mountains, valleys, rivers could now be discerned.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen the scene shifted slightly and they were stationary, directly\nabove a large seacoast city. A city of great beauty it was, and its\nbuildings were of the same octagonal shape as were those of Theros!\nThere could be but one inference--the Theronians were direct\ndescendants of those inhabitants of ancient Atlantis.\n\n\"Yes,\" sighed Phaestra, in answer to the thought she had read, \"our\nancestors were those you now see in the streets of this city of\nAtlantis. A marvelous race they were, too. When the rest of the world\nwas still savage and unenlightened, they knew more of the arts and\nsciences than is known on the surface to-day. The mysteries of the\nFourth Dimension they had already solved. Their telescopes were of\nsuch power that they knew of the existence of intelligent beings on\nMars and Venus. They had conquered the air. They knew of the relation\nbetween gravity and magnetism but recently propounded by your\nEinstein. They were prosperous, happy. Then--but watch!\"\n\nFaint sounds of the life of the city came to their ears. A swarm of\nmonoplanes roared past just beneath them. The streets were crowded\nwith rapidly moving vehicles, the roof-tops with air-craft. Then\nsuddenly the scene darkened; a deep rumbling came from the sea. As\nthey watched in fascinated wonder, a great chasm opened up through the\nheart of the city. Tall buildings swayed and crumbled, falling into\nheaps of twisted metal and crushed masonry and burying hundreds of the\npopulace in their fall. The confusion was indescribable, the uproar\nterrific, and within the space of a very few minutes the entire city\nwas a mass of ruins, fully half of the wrecked area having been\nswallowed up by the heaving waters of the ocean.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPhaestra stifled a sob. \"Thus it began,\" she stated. \"Trovus was\nfirst--the city you just saw--then came three more of the cities of\nthe western coast in rapid succession. Computations of the scientists\nshowed that the upheaval was widespread and that the entire continent\nwas to be engulfed in a very short time. The exodus began, but it was\ntoo late, and only a few hundred people were able to escape the\ncontinent before it was finally destroyed. The ocean became the tomb\nof two hundred millions. The handful of survivors reached the coast of\nwhat is now North America. But the rigors of the climate proved severe\nand more than three-quarters of them perished within a few days after\ntheir planes landed. Then the rest took to the caves along the shore,\nand for a while were safe.\"\n\nShe manipulated the controls once more and there was a quick shift to\nanother coast, a rugged, wave-beaten shore. Closer they drew until\nthey observed a lofty palisade that extended for miles along the\nbarren waterfront. They saw a fire atop this elevation and active men\nand women at various tasks within the narrow circle of its warmth. A\ncave mouth opened at the brink of the precipice near the spot they\noccupied.\n\nThen came a repetition of the upheaval at Trovus. The ocean rushed in\nand beat against the cliff with such ferocity that its spray was\ntossed hundreds of feet in the air. The earth shook and the group of\npeople around the fire made a hasty retreat to the mouth of the cave.\nThe sky darkened and the winds howled with demoniac fury. Quake after\nquake rent the rugged cliffs: huge sections toppled into the angry\nwaters. Then a great tidal wave swept in and covered everything,\ncliffs, cave mouths and all. Nought remained where they had been but\nthe seething waters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But some escaped!\" exulted Phaestra, \"and these discovered Theros.\nThough many miles of the eastern seaboard of your United States were\nsubmerged and the coastline entirely altered, these few were saved.\nTheir cave connected with a long passage, a tunnel that led into the\nbowels of the earth. With the outer entrance blocked by the upheaval\nthey had no alternative save to continue downward.\"\n\n\"They traveled for days and days. Some were overcome by hunger and\nfell by the wayside. The most hardy survived to reach Theros, a series\nof enormous caverns that extends for hundreds of miles under the\nsurface of your country. Here they found subterranean lakes of pure\nwater; forests, game. They had a few tools and weapons and they\nestablished themselves in this underground world. From that small\nbeginning came this!\"\n\nPhaestra's slim fingers worked rapidly at the controls. The scenes\nshifted in quick succession. They were once more in the present, and\nseemed to be traveling speedily through the underground reaches of\nTheros. Now they were racing through a long lighted passage; now over\na great city similar to the one in which they had arrived. Here they\nvisited a huge workshop or laboratory; there a mine where radium or\ncobalt or platinum was being wrested from the vitals of the unwilling\nearth. Then they visited a typical Theronian household, saw the\nperfect peace and happiness in which the family lived. Again they were\nin a large power plant where direct application of the internal heat\nof the earth as obtained through deep shafts bored into the interior\nwas utilized in generating electricity.\n\nThey saw vast quantities of supplies, fifty-ton masses of machinery,\nmoved from place to place as lightly as feathers by use of the gravity\ndiscs, those heavily charged plates whose emanations counteracted the\nearth's attraction. In one busy laboratory they saw an immense\ntelevision apparatus and heard scientists discussing moot questions\nwith inhabitants of Venus, whose images were depicted on the screen.\nThey witnessed a severe electrical storm in the huge cavern arch over\none of the cities, a storm that condensed moisture from the\nartificially oxygenated and humidified atmosphere in such blinding\nsheets as to easily explain the necessity for well-roofed buildings in\nthe underground realm. And, in all the speech and activities of the\nTheronians, there was evident that all-pervading feeling of absolute\ncontentment and freedom from care.\n\n\"What I can not understand,\" said Frank, during a quiet interval, \"is\nwhy the Theronians have never migrated to the surface. Surely, with\nall your command of science and mechanics, that would be easy.\"\n\n\"Why? Why?\" Phaestra's voice spoke volumes. \"Here--I'll show you the\nreason.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd again the scene in the sphere changed. They were on the surface\nand a few years in the past--at Chateau Thierry. They saw their fellow\nmen mangled and broken; saw human beings shot down by hundreds in\nwithering bursts of machine-gun fire; saw them in hand-to-hand bayonet\nfights; gassed and in delirium from the horror of it all.\n\nThey traveled over the ocean; saw a big passenger liner the victim of\ntorpedo fire; saw babies tossed into the water by distracted mothers\nwho jumped in after them to join them in death.\n\nA few years were passed by and they saw gang wars in Chicago and New\nYork; saw militia and picketing strikers in mortal combat; saw wealthy\nbrokers and bank presidents turn pistols on themselves following a\ncrash in the stock market; government officials serving penitentiary\nterms for betrayal of the people's trust; opium dens, speakeasies, sex\ncrimes. It was a fearful indictment.\n\n\"Ah, no,\" said Phaestra kindly, \"the surface world has not yet emerged\nfrom savagery. We should be unwelcome were we to venture outside. And\nnow we come to the reason for your visit. You come in search of one\nEdwin Leland, a fellow worker at one time. Your motives are above\nreproach. But Leland came as a greedy searcher of riches. We brought\nhim within to teach him the error of his ways and to beg him to desist\nfrom his efforts at destroying the dome of silver. He alone knew the\nsecret.\"\n\n\"Then you followed him and we took you in for similar reasons, though\nour scientists found very quickly that your mental reactions were of\nentirely different type from Leland's and that the secret would be\nsafe in your keeping. Leland remains obdurate. He threatens us with\nphysical violence, and his reactions to the thought-reading machines\nare of the most treacherous sort. We must keep him with us. He shall\nremain unharmed, but he must not be allowed to return. That is the\nstory. You two are free to leave when you choose. I ask not that you\ngive your word to keep the secret of 'Silver Dome.' I know it is not\nnecessary.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lights had resumed their normal glow, and the marvelous sphere\nreturned to its receptacle beneath the floor. Phaestra resumed her\nseat on the canopied divan. Frank dropped to a seat on the edge of the\ndais. Tommy and Orrin remained standing, Tommy lost in thought and\nOrrin stolidly mute. The empress avoided Frank's gaze studiously. Her\ncheeks were flushed; her eyes bright with emotion.\n\nFrank was first to break the silence. \"Leland is in solitary\nconfinement?\" he asked.\n\n\"For the present he is under guard,\" replied Phaestra. \"He was quite\nviolent and it was necessary to disarm him after he had killed one of\nmy attendants with a shot from his automatic pistol. When he agrees to\nsubmit peacefully, he shall be given the freedom of Theros for the\nremainder of his life.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" suggested Frank, \"if I spoke to him....\"\n\n\"The very thing.\" Phaestra thanked him with her wondrous eyes.\n\nA high pitched note rang out from behind the hangings, and, in rapid\nsyllables of the language of Theros, a voice broke forth from the\nconcealed amplifiers. Orrin, startled from his stoicism, sprang to the\nside of his empress. She rose from her seat as the voice completed its\nexcited message.\n\n\"It is Leland,\" she said calmly. \"He has escaped and recovered his\npistol. I have been told that he is now at large in the palace,\nterrorizing the household. We have no weapons here, you see.\"\n\n\"Good God!\" shouted Frank. \"Suppose he should come here?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe jumped to his feet just as a shot rang out in the antechamber.\nOrrin dashed to the portal when a second shot spat forth from the\nautomatic which must certainly be in the hands of a madman. The doors\nswung wide and Leland, hair disarranged and bloodshot eyes staring,\nburst into the room. Orrin went down at the next shot and the hardly\nrecognizable scientist advanced toward the dais.\n\nWhen he saw Frank and Tommy he stopped in his tracks. \"So you two have\nbeen following me!\" he snarled. \"Well, you won't keep me from my\npurpose. I'm here to kill this queen of hell!\"\n\nOnce more he raised his automatic, but Frank had been watching closely\nand he literally dove from the steps of the dais to the knees of the\nderanged Leland. As beautiful a tackle as he had ever made in his\ncollege football days laid the maniac low with a crashing thud that\ntold of a fractured skull. The bullet intended for Phaestra went wide,\nstriking Tommy in the shoulder.\n\nSpun half way around by the impact of the heavy bullet, Tommy fought\nto retain his balance. But his knees went suddenly awry and gave way\nbeneath him. He crumpled helplessly to the floor, staring foolishly at\nthe prostrate figure of Leland and at Frank, who had risen to his feet\nand now faced the beautiful empress of Theros. Strange lights danced\nbefore Tommy's eyes, and he found it difficult to keep the pair in\nfocus. But he was sure of one thing--his pal was unharmed. Then the\ntwo figures seemed to merge into one and he blinked his eyes rapidly\nto clear his failing vision. By George, they were in each other's\narms! Funny world--above or below--it didn't seem to make any\ndifference. But it was a tough break for Frank--morganatic marriage\nand all that. No chance--well--\n\nTommy succumbed to his overpowering drowsiness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe awakening was slow, but not painful. Rather there was a feeling of\nutter contentment, of joy at being alive. A delicious languor pervaded\nTommy's being as he turned his head on a snow white silken pillow and\nstared at the figure of the white-capped nurse who was fussing with\nthe bottles and instruments that lay on an enameled table beside the\nbed. Memory came to him immediately. He felt remarkably well and\nrefreshed. Experimentally he moved his left shoulder. There was\nabsolutely no pain and it felt perfectly normal. He sat erect in his\nsurprise and felt the shoulder with his right hand. There was no\nbandage, no wound. Had he dreamed of the hammer blow of that\nforty-five caliber bullet?\n\nHis nurse, observing that her patient had recovered consciousness,\nbroke forth in a torrent of unintelligible Theronian, then rushed from\nthe room.\n\nHe was still examining his unscarred shoulder in wonder, when the\nnurse returned, with Frank Rowley at her heels. Frank laughed at the\nexpression of his friend's face.\n\n\"What's wrong, old-timer?\" he asked.\n\n\"Why--I--thought that fool of a Leland had shot me in the shoulder,\"\nstammered Tommy, \"but I guess I dreamed it. Where are we? Still in\nTheros?\"\n\n\"We are.\" Frank sobered instantly, and Tommy noted with alarm that his\nusually cheerful features were haggard and drawn and his eyes hollow\nfrom loss of sleep. \"And you didn't dream that Leland shot you. That\nshoulder of yours was mangled and torn beyond belief. He was using\nsoft nosed bullets, the hell-hound!\"\n\n\"Then how--?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Tommy, these Theronians are marvelous. We rushed you to this hospital\nand a half-dozen doctors started working on you at once. They repaired\nthe shattered bones by an instantaneous grafting process, tied the\nsevered veins and arteries and closed the gaping wound by filling it\nwith a plastic compound and drawing the edges together with clamps.\nYou were anaesthetized and some ray machine was used to heal the\nshoulder. This required but ten hours and they now say that your arm\nis as good as ever. How does it feel?\"\n\n\"Perfectly natural. In fact I feel better than I have in a month.\"\nTommy observed that the nurse had left the room and he jumped from his\nbed and capered like a school boy.\n\nThis drew no sign of merriment from Frank, and Tommy scrutinized him\nonce more in consternation. \"And you,\" he said, \"what is wrong with\nyou?\"\n\n\"Don't worry about me,\" replied Frank impatiently. Then, irrelevantly,\nhe said \"Leland's dead.\"\n\n\"Should be. I knew we shouldn't have started out to help him. But,\nFrank, I'm concerned about you. You look badly.\" Tommy was getting\ninto his clothes as he spoke.\n\n\"Forget it, Tommy. You've been sleeping for two days, you know--part\nof the cure--and I haven't had much rest during that time. That is\nall.\"\n\n\"It's that Phaestra woman,\" Tommy accused him.\n\n\"Well, perhaps. But I'll get over it, I suppose. Tommy, I love her.\nBut there's no chance for me. Haven't seen her since the row in the\npalace. Her council surrounds her continually and I have been advised\nto-day that we are to be returned as quickly as you are up and around.\nThat means immediately now.\"\n\n\"Good. The sooner the better. And you just forget about this queen as\nsoon as you are able. She's a peach, of course, but not for you.\nThere's lots more back in little old New York.\" But Frank had no reply\nto this sally.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere came a knock at the door and Tommy called, \"Come in.\"\n\n\"I see you have fully recovered,\" said the smiling Theronian who\nentered at the bidding, \"and we are overjoyed to know this. You have\nthe gratitude of the entire realm for your part in the saving of our\nempress from the bullets of the madman.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Yes. You and your friend. And now, may I ask, are you ready to return\nto your own land?\"\n\nTommy stared. \"Sure thing,\" he said, \"or rather, I will be in a few\nminutes.\"\n\n\"Thank you. We shall await you in the transmitting room.\" The\nTheronian bowed and was gone.\n\n\"Well, I like that,\" said Tommy. \"He hands me an undeserved compliment\nand then asks how soon we can beat it. A 'here's your hat, what's your\nhurry' sort of thing.\"\n\n\"It's me they're anxious to be rid of,\" remarked Frank, shrugging his\nbroad shoulders, \"and perhaps it is just as well.\"\n\n\"You bet it is!\" agreed Tommy enthusiastically, \"and I'm in favor of\nmaking it good and snappy.\" He completed his toilet as rapidly as\npossible and then turned to face the down-hearted Frank.\n\n\"How do we go? The way we came?\" he asked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"No, Tommy. They have closed off the shaft that led from the cavern of\nthe silver dome. They are taking no more chances. It seems that the\nshaft down which we floated was constructed by the Theronians; not by\nLeland. They had used it and the gravity disc to transport casual\nvisitors to the surface, who occasionally mixed with our people in\norder to learn the languages of the upper world and to actually touch\nand handle the things they were otherwise able to see only through the\nmedium of Silver Dome and the crystal spheres. Further visits to the\nsurface are now forbidden, and we are to be returned by a remarkable\nprocess of beam transmission of our disintegrated bodies.\"\n\n\"Disintegrated?\"\n\n\"Yes. It seems they have learned to dissociate the atoms of which the\nhuman body is composed and to transmit them to any desired point over\na beam of etheric vibrations, then to reassemble them in the original\nliving condition.\"\n\n\"What? You mean to say we are to be shot to the surface through the\nintervening rock and earth? Disintegrated and reintegrated? And we'll\nnot even be bent, let alone busted?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis time he was rewarded by a laugh. \"That's right. And I have gone\nthrough the calculations with one of the Theronian engineers and can\nfind no flaw in the scheme. We're safe in their hands.\"\n\n\"If you say so, Frank, it's okay with me. Let's go!\"\n\nReluctantly his friend lifted his athletic bulk from the chair. In\nsilence he led the way to the transmitting room of the Theronian\nscientists.\n\nHere they were greeted by two savants with whom Frank was already\nacquainted, Clarux and Rhonus by name. A bewildering array of complex\nmechanisms was crowded into the high-ceilinged chamber and, prominent\namong them, was one of the crystal spheres, this one of somewhat\nsmaller size than the one in the palace of Phaestra.\n\n\"Where do you wish to arrive?\" asked Clarux.\n\n\"As near to my automobile as possible,\" replied Frank, taking sudden\ninterest in the proceedings. \"It is parked in the lane between\nLeland's house and the road.\"\n\nTommy looked quickly in his direction, encouraged by the apparent\nchange in his attitude. The scientists proceeded to energize the\ncrystal sphere. They were bent upon speeding the parting guests. Their\nbeloved empress was to be saved from her own emotions.\n\nQuick adjustments of the controls resulted in the locating of Frank's\ncar, which was still buried to its axles in snow. The scene included\nLeland's house, or rather its site, for it appeared to have been\nutterly demolished by some explosion within.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTommy raised questioning eyebrows.\n\n\"It was necessary,\" explained Rhonus, \"to destroy the house in\nobliterating all traces of our former means of egress. It has been\ncommanded that you two be returned safely, and we are authorized to\ntrust implicitly in your future silence regarding the existence of\nTheros. This is satisfactory, I presume?\"\n\nBoth Tommy and Frank nodded agreement.\n\n\"Are you ready, gentlemen?\" asked Clarux, who was adjusting a\nmechanism that resembled a huge radio transmitter. Its twelve giant\nvacuum tubes glowed into life as he spoke.\n\n\"We are,\" chimed the two visitors.\n\nThey were requested to step to a small circular platform that was\nraised about a foot from the floor by means of insulating legs. Above\nthe table there was an inverted bowl of silver in the shape of a large\nparabolic reflector.\n\n\"There will be no alarming sensations,\" averred Clarux. \"When I close\nthe switch the disintegrating energy from the reflector above will\nbathe your bodies for a moment in visible rays of a deep purple hue.\nYou may possibly experience a slight momentary feeling of nausea.\nThen--presto!--you have arrived.\"\n\n\"Shoot!\" growled Frank from his position on the stand.\n\nClarux pulled the switch and there was a murmur as of distant thunder.\nTommy blinked involuntarily in the brilliant purple glow that\nsurrounded him. Then all was confusion in the transmitting room.\nSomebody had rushed through the open door shouting, \"Frank! Frank!\" It\nwas the empress Phaestra.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a growing daze Tommy saw her dash to the platform, seize Frank in a\nclutch of desperation. There was a violent wrench as if some monster\nwere twisting at his vitals. He closed his eyes against the blinding\nlight, then realized that utter silence had followed the erstwhile\nconfusion. He sat in Frank's car--alone.\n\nThe journey was over, and Frank was left behind. With awful finality\nit came to him that there was nothing he could do. It was clear that\nPhaestra had wanted his pal, needed him--come for him. From the fact\nthat Frank remained behind it was evident that she had succeeded in\nretaining him. A sickening fear came to Tommy that she had been too\nlate; that Frank's body was already partly disintegrated and that he\nmight have paid the price of her love with his life. But a little\nreflection convinced him that if this were the case a portion of his\nfriend's body would have reached the intended destination. Then,\nunexplainably, he received a mental message that all was well.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nConsiderably heartened, he pressed the starter button and the cold\nmotor of Frank's coupe turned over slowly, protestingly. Finally it\ncoughed a few times, and, after considerable coaxing by use of the\nchoke, ran smoothly. He proceeded to back carefully through the drifts\ntoward the road, casting an occasional regretful glance in the\ndirection of the demolished mansion.\n\nHe would have some explaining to do when he returned to New York.\nPerhaps--yes, almost certainly, he would be questioned by the police\nregarding Frank's disappearance. But he would never betray the trust\nof Phaestra. Who indeed would believe him if he told the story?\nInstead, he would concoct a weird fabrication regarding an explosion\nin Leland's laboratory, of his own miraculous escape. They could not\nhold him, could not accuse him of murder without producing a body--the\n_corpus delicti_, or whatever they called it.\n\nAnyway, Frank was content. So was Phaestra.\n\nTommy swung the heavy car into the road and turned toward New York,\nalone and lonely--but somehow happy; happy for his friend.\n\n[Advertisement: ASTOUNDING STORIES\n\n_Appears on Newsstands_\n\nTHE FIRST THURSDAY IN EACH MONTH]\n\n\n\n\nEarth, the Marauder\n\nPART TWO OF A THREE-PART NOVEL\n\n_By Arthur J. Burks_\n\n[Illustration: Closer and closer they came.]\n\n[Sidenote: Deep in the gnome-infested tunnels of the Moon, Sarka and\nJaska are brought to Luar, the radiant goddess against whose minions\nthe marauding Earth had struck in vain.]\n\n\nWHAT HAS GONE BEFORE\n\nThe Earth was dying. Ever since Sarka the First, king of scientists,\nhad given mankind the Secret of Life, which prolonged life\nindefinitely, the Earthlings had multiplied beyond all count, and been\nforced to burrow deep into the ground and high into the air in the\ndesperate search for the mere room in which to live. There was much\ncivil war. The plight of the children of men was desperate. Something\nhad to be done.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThen Sarka the Third called the Spokesmen of the Gens of Earth around\nhim, and proposed to them a new scheme which had come to him in his\nlaboratory atop the Himalayas. He would swing the Earth from its\norbit!--send it careening through space toward the Moon!--there to\ndestroy its inhabitants and supplant them with a colony of Earthlings!\nAnd then they would surge on to Mars!\n\nOne by one the twelve Spokesmen, each the head and representative of\nthe teeming trillions comprising his Gens, acceded. Even Dalis, the\njealous rival of Sarka, finally gave his sulky consent.\n\nSo, under Sarka's commands, the Earth's hordes were mobilized; and in\ntune with the Master Beryl in Sarka's laboratory all the Beryls of the\nEarth vibrated, freeing the Earth from her age-old orbit and swinging\nher out towards the Moon.\n\nThe Gens of Dalis--the trillions of people who swore allegiance to\nhim--would lead the attack on the Moon. When within fifty thousand\nmiles, they darted out, clad only in their tight green clothing and\nthe helmets that held the anti-gravitational ovoids, which\nneutralized gravity for them and enabled them to instantly fly where\nthey willed. Their only weapons were hand atom-disintegrators. And out\nfrom the Moon came mysterious aircars, with long clutching\ntentacles--the weapons of the Moon's minions! The war of the worlds\nwas begun!\n\nYet Dalis, leader of the Gens that now engaged the Moon's aircars, was\nstill in the laboratory with Sarka. For Dalis' treacherous mind\ncoveted control of the Earth, and though the urge to lead his Gens\ninto battle was tremendous, still he stayed, watching Sarka closely,\nwaiting for the moment when he could trick Sarka and assume control.\n\nAnd at the head of the Gens of Dalis was a woman, Jaska, whom Sarka\nloved. The Moon's aircars swept away the Gens of Dalis, and out from\nEarth poured the Gens of Cleric, who was Jaska's father. The newcomers\nfought desperately to save Jaska from the deadly clutches of the\naircars.\n\nDalis could stand it no longer. He sped forth from the laboratory, to\nreorganize his beaten Gens. Jaska flew for home; but behind her a\nsingle aircar, splashed with crimson, reached forth its tentacles to\nclutch her--and Sarka groaned with the agony of his impotence to help\nthe woman he loved.\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n_Escape--and Dalis' Laughter_\n\nBut Sarka was not to be so easily beaten. There still remained an\ninfinite number of possible changes of speed by manipulation of ovidum\nby vibration set up by the Beryls, without which this flight from the\nbeginning would have been impossible. But for two hours, while the\nwhite robed men of Cleric fought against the car of the crimson\nsplashes to prevent the capture of the daughter of their\nSpokesman--and died by hundreds in the grip of those grim\ntentacles--Sarka was forced to labor with the Beryls until\nperspiration bathed his whole body and his heart was heavy as he\nforesaw failure. And failure meant death or worse for Jaska.\n\nBut at the end of two hours, while the men of Cleric fought like men\ninspired against the aircar of the crimson slashes, a cessation in the\noutward speed of the earth could be noted. At the end of three hours\nthe body of Jaska, all this time fighting manfully to attain to\nlanding place on the Earth, was at last bulking larger; but the\ntentacles of the aircar were groping after her, reaching for her,\nstriving to catch and clasp her to her death.\n\nThe two Sarkas watched and prayed while the might of the Beryls,\ntraveling at top speed, fought against the force of whatever was used\nby the Moon-men to compel the Moon to withdraw. Still the men of\nCleric fought that single car, and died by hundreds in the fighting.\nWhite robed figures which became shriveled and black in the grip of\nthose tentacles.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCountless of the men of Cleric deliberately cast themselves against\nthose tentacles, throwing their lives away to give Jaska more leeway\nin her race for life.\n\n\"Will she make it, father?\" queried Sarka in a whisper.\n\n\"If the courage and loyalty of her people stand for anything, she will\nmake it,\" he replied.\n\nOn she came at top speed, and now through the micro-telescopes the\nSarkas could see the agony of effort on her face, even through the\nsmooth mask used by the people of Earth for flight in space where\nthere was no atmosphere. Courage was there, and the will of\nnever-say-die; and Jaska, moreover, was coming back to the man she\nloved. In a nebulous sort of way Sarka realized this, for though these\ntwo had not mated there was a resonant inner sympathy between them\nwhich had rounded into an emotion of overpowering force since Jaska\nhad proved to Sarka that she was to be trusted--that he had been\nsomething less than a faithful lover when he had mistrusted her, ever\nso little.\n\nCloser now and closer, and at last the aircar of the crimson splashes\nwas drawing away, losing in the race for life. It was falling back, as\nthough minded to turn about and race back for the Moon, now a ball in\nthe sky, far away, the outlines of its craters growing dim and misty\nwith distance. Now the men of Cleric, those who remained, were\nbreaking contact with the aircar, and forming a valiant rear-guard for\nthe retreat of Jaska.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThroughout the Earth, as the Beryls fought with ever increasing speed\nto lower the rate of the earth's outward race from the Moon, was such\na trembling, such a vibration induced by conflicting, alien forces as\nthere had not been even in that moment when back there in its orbit,\nthe Earth could have either been kept within its orbit, or hurled\noutward into space at the touch of a finger.\n\nNow Jaska, surrounded by her father's men, was almost close enough to\ntouch the Earth.\n\nShe made it, weak and weary, and rested for a moment while her\nfather's men steadied her. Then, thrusting them aside, with gestures\nbidding them return to their Gens, she lifted into the air again, and\nfled straight for the laboratory of Sarka.\n\nShe entered tiredly through the exit dome, and all but collapsed into the\narms of Sarka. Gently he removed her helmet of the anti-gravitational\novoid, noting as she leaned against him the tumultuous beating of her\nheart. Then her gentle eyes opened and she whispered to Sarka.\n\n\"You trust me now?\"\n\nFor answer he bent and kissed her softly on the lips--for the kiss,\nfrom the far distant time when the first baby was kissed by the first\nmother, had been the favored caress of mankind. Her face was\ntransfigured as she read his answer in his eyes, and the touch of his\nlips. Then, remembering, fear flashed across her face. She\nstraightened, and grasping Sarka by the hand, hurried with him into\nthe observatory.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe took the seat in which Dalis had sat before he had gone out to the\ncommand of his Gens, studied for many minutes the battle in space\nbetween the two alien worlds.\n\n\"Dalis is winning,\" said the Elder Sarka quietly, \"apparently!\"\n\n\"The qualification is a just one,\" said Jaska softly. \"'Apparently,'\nindeed! You will note now that, though men of the Gens of Dalis swarm\nall about the aircars, and even clamber atop them, no more are dying\nin the grasp of those tentacles? Is Dalis arranging a treacherous\ntruce with the Moon-men?\"\n\n\"I have been wondering about that,\" said Sarka softly, \"for it is my\nbelief that nothing not conducive to his own selfish interests would\nhave forced Dalis to leave this place and take command of his Gens, as\nI had first ordered, unless he had schemes planned of which father and\nI could know nothing. Now that I think of it, Jaska, how did Dalis\nknow our secret code of fingers?\"\n\nJaska started, and turned a blanched face to Sarka.\n\n\"_Did_ he know?\" she cried. \"Did he? If he did that proves a suspicion\nthat I have entertained since the first moment when Dalis swept into\nthe fight, and I sensed that alien signals were being flashed back and\nforth!\"\n\n\"Flashed back and forth!\" ejaculated Sarka. \"How do you mean? That\nDalis was somehow able to communicate with the Moon-men in their own\nlanguage, or through their own signals?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Why not? He knew our secret code, did he not? I never gave it to him,\nand I know that you did not. No, Dalis has some means, never\ndiscovered or suspected by you Sarkas, whereby he is able to\nunderstand alien tongues and alien sign manuals!\"\n\n\"That means,\" said Sarka the Elder in a dead voice, \"that by forcing\nDalis to go out at the head of his Gens....\"\n\n\"We have,\" interrupted Sarka the Younger, \"placed a new weapon of\ntreason in his hands! Dalis, at the very moment of contact with the\naircars, loaded with Moon-men, broke in on their signals--they must\nhave had some means of signalling one another--and communicated with\nthem in their own way! Do you think it possible that, with all his\nGens, he may go over to the Moon-men, form an alliance with them?\"\n\nFor many moments no one dared to answer the question; yet, from what\nthe Sarkas knew of him, it was not impossible at all. For Dalis was\nthe master egotist always, and never overlooked opportunity to gain\nsomething for himself.\n\nIt was Jaska who broke the silence.\n\n\"Did you note carefully,\" she said, \"those aircars which were\npartially destroyed by our ray directors and atom-disintegrators?\"\n\nThe Sarkas nodded.\n\n\"Did you note that no men, formed like our own, no creatures of any\nsort whatever, fell from the cars?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAgain the awesome silence, and the keen brains of the Sarkas wrestled\nwith this vague hint of the uncanny.\n\n\"You mean, Jaska ... you mean....\"\n\n\"That the occupants of aircars are part of the cars, but--Beings of\nthe Moon! That they are either metal monsters endowed with brains or\ntiny creatures irrevocably attached to the cars themselves!\"\n\n\"But how,\" said Sarka at last, \"are we to be sure? I can understand\nwhat Dalis might do if the Moon-men granted his wish for an alliance\nwith them. It is easy to understand why his Gens would follow his\nlead, for with the Moon forced outward from the Earth faster than his\nGens could retreat, there is but one direction for his Gens to\ngo--toward the Moon! They would go to the Moon as captives and trust\nthe keen brain of Dalis to gain the mastery, sooner or later, over the\nMoon-men. And then....\"\n\n\"And then--?\" repeated Sarka the Elder.\n\n\"Then, Dalis has already been inspired by the speed with which those\naircars travel! You will remember that he did not take kindly to\nleaving the Earth and making his abode on some other planet! But why\ncould he not do so, combine forces and knowledge with the people of\nthat planet--and then return to Earth in alliance with them?--after we\nhave depleted our forces by placing a large portion of our people on\nMars and Venus and Saturn?\"\n\n\"Sarka, my son,\" said Sarka's father, \"before we continue with our\nflight to Mars, we must know the truth! We must somehow learn exactly\nwhat is going on on the Moon! If you could reach the Moon, alone,\nundetected, and bring back a report....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment he left it there, and the faces of all three were gray\nwith worry and abysmal fear.\n\n\"I can't go bodily, father,\" said Sarka at last, \"but you remember my\nsecret exit dome, to the right of the observatory, from which I have\nnever yet dared exit from this place for fear that it might cost me my\nlife?\"\n\nSarka the Elder nodded, while Jaska looked puzzled. Another evidence\nof the fact that Sarka had not always trusted her, for she knew\nnothing of a secret exit dome. Sarka's eyes, as he looked at Jaska,\nmutely asked her forgiveness, which she gave him with her smile.\n\n\"I remember, son, and now?...\"\n\n\"Surely it is worth risking one's life to know what new menace looms\nover the children of men!\"\n\n\"What is the use of this secret dome?\" asked Jaska softly.\n\n\"It is merely an elaboration of the regular exit dome, combined with\ncertain phases of our atom-distintegrators, and the principle involved\nin the anti-gravitational ovoids. I step into the secret exit dome,\ngarbed for flight Outside, and will myself to appear bodily in a\ncertain place. It is instantaneous. I step into the dome, for\nexample, and will myself to appear whole upon the Moon, and there I\nwill appear!\"\n\n\"You mean that during the period of transposition you are invisible?\"\n\n\"Yes, invisible because non-existent, except for the essential\nelements of me, broken down by the secret exit dome, reassembled at\nthe place willed in their entirety! I can't fly there, for a million\neyes would see me approach! I must go in secret, as a spy, and wearing\nthe clothing and insignia of a member of the Gens of Dalis!\"\n\nSilence in the observatory for a brief breathing space, and then Jaska\nspoke that speech out of the books of antiquity, which remains the\nclassic expression of loyalty.\n\n\"Whithersoever thou goest, there will I go also!\"\n\nFrom the laboratory came a sudden burst of laughter, the laughter\nwhich all three recognized as the laughter of Dalis; but when they\nentered the place of the Revolving Beryl, there was no one there--and\na feeling of dread, all encompassing, held them thralled for the space\nof several heart-beats. Dalis, they knew, was thousands of miles away,\nupon the Moon; yet here in the place of the Master Beryl they all\nthree had just heard his sardonic laughter!\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n_Ashes of the Moon_\n\nThrough the micro-telescopes it was possible to see what had happened\nafter Dalis had assumed command of the Gens of Dalis. For even though\nthe Moon, in spite of the speed of the Beryls, was being forced\nfurther and further from the Earth, the eyes of the micro-telescopes\npicked out and enlarged details to such an extent that the battle\nseemed to be transpiring under the eyes of the beholders.\n\nA terrific jumble, in which Earthlings and aircars were all tumbled\ntogether in mad chaos, a great mass of writhing, green-garbed figures.\nInfinite in number--in the midst of which were the gigantic aircars,\nlike monster beetles being beset by armies upon armies of ants.\n\nThen, by the time Jaska had seated herself in the observatory atop the\nHimalayas, to watch what developed, the battle seemed to be over, and\nthe Moon-men had won. For the huge cars swung around between the\nmyriads of the Gens of Dalis, and seemed to be herding them toward the\nMoon, as though they were prisoners.\n\nTelepathically, Sarka and his father had been able to catch some hint\nof the thoughts of the Earthlings in the battle, and these thoughts\nhad been tinged with doubt, fear and horror, so that even thus to\nreceive them, by mental telepathy, was to feel the searing heat of\ntheir fear.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow, in the instant when the battle in Space seemed to be over and the\nGens of Dalis were prisoners, the thought waves were no more, and a\nbrooding silence took their place. Dalis, the Sarkas knew, possessed\nthe power to mask his thoughts, for it was a power possessed in common\nby all the scientists of Earth. But the common people of his Gens did\nnot posses that power. However, for the moment Sarka had forgotten an\nall important something: that, when people were outside the roof of\nthe world, they were subservient to the will of a common commander to\nwhom they had sworn allegiance.\n\nIf, therefore, Dalis could mask his own thoughts from the brains of\nmen, he could also mask the thoughts of the people of his Gens, merely\nby willing it! So Sarka and his father and Jaska could not know\nwhether the Gens of Dalis had gone over in a body with him, in a truce\nwith the people of the Moon, or whether they were dual prisoners--of\nDalis and of the Moon-men!\n\nMore than ever was it necessary for someone to somehow reach the Moon\nand make a thorough investigation, discover just what Dalis was doing,\nwhat mischief he was hatching.\n\nThe secret exit dome seemed to be the answer.\n\n\"You can manage without me, father?\" asked Sarka.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe elder Sarka nodded.\n\n\"Of the other Spokesmen of Earth,\" went on Sarka, \"I trust Gerd the\nmost. Might I suggest that you bring him here, trust him in all\ndetails, and let him take my place wherever possible? Or, better\nstill, keep Jaska here with you! I ... I may not be able to return!\nI'll try to find a way, but--we can always communicate telepathically.\nJaska....\"\n\n\"Jaska,\" said that young lady grimly, \"goes with Sarka wherever Sarka\ngoes!\"\n\n\"But it may mean death! We can only guess at the cunning of the Moon\ndwellers! They may have been in secret communication with Dalis for\ncenturies! Dalis, who somehow discovered our secret finger code, may\nalso know of the secret exit dome, and the principle upon which it\noperates! If he does, he may know how to combat it! Perhaps that\nexplains his laughter! Perhaps he heard and understood every word we\nspoke, hears and understands every word we speak now! Who knows? He\nmay wait until I have passed through the secret exit dome, and then\nmake it impossible for me to be reincarnated on the Moon--or\nelsewhere!\"\n\n\"No matter,\" said Jaska softly, \"wherever Sarka goes, there goes\nJaska! It is useless to attempt to dissuade me, and it is time you\nlearned that!\"\n\nIn spite of himself Sarka smiled, and his father met his smile with a\nquizzical one of his own. Both men had the same thought.\n\n\"The eternal woman!\" said Sarka the Elder. \"No man has ever understood\nher--no man ever will! And all men are ruled by her!\"\n\nSarka shrugged, and Jaska spoke again.\n\n\"Don't you think it is time we tried this new experiment?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka nodded, and his face was suddenly alight with the excitement\nwhich burned within him.\n\n\"First,\" he said, \"we need accoutrements of the Gens of Dalis for two\npeople!\"\n\nJaska smiled.\n\n\"Forseeing that we might have need of such equipment, I had several\ncomplete outfits sent here when I took charge of the Gens of Dalis as\nits Spokesman!\"\n\nTwo minutes later, arrayed in the green clothing of the House of\nDalis, swathed in it from neck to toe, wearing their belts and the\nmasks which were necessary to life in space where there was no\natmosphere, the whole topped by the gleaming helmets whose skull-pans\nheld the infinitesimally small anti-gravitational ovoids, Jaska and\nSarka entered the secret exit dome, side by-side.\n\nOn the breast and back of each showed the yellow stars of the Gens of\nDalis. There was no hiding their identity otherwise, and if any of the\nGens saw them, both would be immediately recognized--for Jaska had\ncommanded the Gens, and Sarka was the world's greatest scientist known\nto every human being. But they planned on carrying out their\ninvestigations by stealth.\n\n\"Father,\" said Sarka, \"when the inner door is closed upon us, you have\nbut to press the button to the right of the door. Press it when the\nlight beside it glows red, which will indicate that we have willed\nourselves to go to a certain destination!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe inner door closed upon Sarka and Jaska, and, hand in hand, side by\nside, their bodies glowing with knowledge of warm, sympathetic\ncontact, they waited for a miracle which had never before been\nattempted.\n\n\"Are you afraid, beloved?\" queried Sarka.\n\n\"When I am with you,\" she said softly, \"I have no fear.\"\n\n\"Then face the outer door, and will to go wherever I will to take\nyou!\"\n\nSide by side, hand-in-hand still, they faced the outer door, and Sarka\nwilled:\n\n\"Let us appear together in a deserted spot, within sight but unseen,\nof the Moon crater from which those aircars were sent against us!\"\n\nA sudden blur, a cessation of all knowledge, and then....\n\nSarka and Jaska stood side by side in a desolate expanse surrounded by\nbleak and appalling mountains of grotesque shape, in a light that was\nweirdly, awesomely blue. Their feet were invisible, deeply rooted in\nsome soft, fine material which looked like snow.\n\nAfter a swift glance around to see if anything lived or moved in this\nawful desolation, Sarka stooped and dipped up some of the fine stuff\nwith his fingers, touched it to his lips.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe material seemed to be fine blue ashes and on his tongue it had a\nsoapy savor. He peered at Jaska, whose eyes were glowing with\nexcitement, whose lips were parted with anticipation, and instantly he\nopened a mental conversation with her.\n\n\"We must speak with each other telepathically, but do not speak with\nme until I have explained to you how to mask your thoughts from all\npersons save the one with whom you hold converse! First, I love you!\nSecond, let us see if, searching the sky, we can find the Earth!\"\n\nIn a few brief, highly technical words, Sarka told his beloved how to\ntalk with him in the manner which he had never before explained to\nher. They had used telepathy before, countless times, but they had not\ncared who heard--while now secrecy in all things was the prime\nessential for success, even for life.\n\nWhen he had told her, and she replied, \"I understand perfectly, and it\nseems quite easy,\" they turned and surveyed the heavens, out of which,\nby this new miracle of the secret exit dome, they had dropped to the\nface of the Moon.\n\nAway across the space between worlds, its transfiguration plainly\nvisible to the two, they could make out and identify the world from\nwhich they had come. Save that they knew themselves standing on the\nMoon, they would have thought as far as appearances went, that the\nplace where they had come was the Moon, many times enlarged. It seemed\nincredible that they had come so far in the twinkling of an eye; but\nthat they had was proved by the fact of their physical presence.\n\n\"Look, Jaska!\" said Sarka suddenly. \"See how our Earth glows, as\nthough it were afire inside!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey stared at the great circular yellowish flame that he pointed out,\nand Sarka, always the scientist whose science was one of exactness,\ntried to estimate just where, on the Earth's surface, the glow was.\n\n\"Jaska,\" he said again, \"that glow comes out of the heart of the Gens area\nwhich Dalis ruled! And no one lives there, since Dalis' Gens flew out to do\nbattle! That's why we did not know of it before we left! That glow,\nsomehow, beloved, is the cause of the outward-from-the-Earth journey of the\nMoon! First we must locate the Moon-source of the glow, and render it\nincapable of further forcing itself away! For do you realize that, unless\nwe do so, we will never again see home?\"\n\nJaska said nothing, but her eyes were troubled for a moment. Then she\nsmiled again.\n\n\"What care I if I become a prisoner on the Moon, if you are with me?\"\n\nSarka was just now realizing the wonder of this raven-haired woman\nwhom, knowing her for half a century as he had, he had just known so\nlittle after all.\n\n\"If we seem in danger of discovery, Jaska,\" he said to her, \"drop down\ninstantly into the ashes, for if we are discovered by Dalis....\"\n\nHe left it there and, with a deep intake of breath, started away for\nthe nearest and highest hill. They desired to walk, yet found walking\nalmost impossible, as they could not keep their feet on the ground\nsave by the exercise of a really incredible effort of will. So,\ndespairing of keeping their feet in contact with the ashes, they flew\njust above them, heading for the nearest weird-looking ridge.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the strange light, which was oddly like moonlight in some painted\ndesert of Earth, shapes were distorted and somehow menacing, colors\nwere raw, almost bleeding--and distances that seemed but a step\nrequired hours to traverse.\n\nEver and anon, as they traveled they looked back up at the Earth which\nwas their home. It still was visible, though plainly smaller with\ndistance, and for a time Sarka's heart misgave him; but he only\nclasped tighter the hand of Jaska and moved on.\n\nThey were just at the base of the first hill, which had now become a\nmountain of gloomy, forbidding aspect, when the first sound they had\nheard on the moon came to them. A sound that was a commingling of the\nlaughter of Dalis, the barking of jackals of the olden times, the\nhumming of a million Beryls revolving at top speed, and a strident\nbuzzing such as neither had ever heard.\n\nHad they been discovered? Was the sound a warning? They could not\nknow; but as they stared at the crest of the hill, two long, snaky,\nwaving things appeared above the crest, undulating, waving to and\nfro, as though questing for something. They crouched low in the white\nashes at the base of the mountain, and waited, scarcely breathing.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n_The Lunar Cubes_\n\nFor a long time Sarka and Jaska remained still, like sentinels,\nlistening to the strange discord which seemed to emanate from behind\nthe hill at whose base they crouched.\n\n\"Look!\" said Sarka at last. \"There against the sky, beyond and between\nthose two waving tentacles! Note that column of light, scarcely\nlighter than the light which surrounds it everywhere? It looks like a\nmassive column just lighter than everything around it, yet so little\nlighter that you have to watch closely to see it at all?\"\n\nJaska stared for all of a minute, before she thought back her answer.\n\n\"I see it,\" she said.\n\n\"Note now whether it goes, as it reaches outward into Space!\"\n\nJaska followed the mighty height of the thing, outward and outward,\nand then gasped.\n\n\"Sarka,\" she said, \"its end touches the Earth in the very heart of\nthat strange glow we spoke about!\"\n\n\"Exactly! And people of Earth know nothing about it, because it is\ninvisible to them! It is only from Outside that the glow it makes\nagainst the Earth is visible! If we can divert its direction, or\nrender it useless in any way, the Moon will no longer be thrust away\nby its force!\"\n\nA pause of indecision, then Sarka thought again:\n\n\"Let us go, Jaska! Keep behind me, right on my heels!\"\n\nSlowly, fighting against something that seemed determined to pull, or\nhurl, them outward from the surface of the Moon with each forward\nmovement they made, they essayed the side of the hill, pausing at the\nend of what seemed like hours in a sort of hollow just large enough\nto mask their bodies and stared over its edge into one of the craters\nof the Moon. Out of the depths of that crater came the discordant\nsounds, which now were almost deafening, and out of that crater too\ncame the almost invisibly bluish column whose outer tip touched the\nEarth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRight before them, so close that they all but rested in its shadow,\nwas one of those monster aircars, its tentacles moving to and fro as\nthough wafted into motion by some vagrant breeze. But since neither\nSarka nor Jaska could feel the breeze, Sarka knew that it was life\nwhich caused the waving motion of those tentacles of terror.\n\n\"Note,\" he said to Jaska, \"that there is a tiny trap-door in the\nbottom of the aircar, and that the thing rests on a half-dozen of\nthose tentacles!\"\n\n\"I see,\" came Jaska's reply.\n\nJaska went on:\n\n\"Note the gleaming thing on the ground, right below the aircar? I\nwonder what it is?\"\n\nThey studied the thing there, which seemed to be a huge jewel of some\nsort that glittered balefully in the eery light of the Moon. It was,\nperhaps, twice the size of an average man's torso, and was almost\nexactly cubical in shape. As Sarka studied the thing, he sensed that\nfeeling flowed out of it--that the cube, whatever it was, was alive!\n\nHe tore his glance away from it, and realized that he accomplished the\nfeat with a distinct effort of will--as though the cube had willed to\nhold his gaze, knew he was there. His eyes, peering around the inner\nslope of the crater--which dipped over, some hundreds of feet down,\nand plunged downward to some unknown depth--noted a broad, flat stone,\noff to his right; and around the rim of the crater he counted a full\nhundred of the aircars, all with their tentacles waving as if they\nbelonged to sentient creatures.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBelow each one, as he studied them and strained his eyes to make out\ndetails, he caught the baleful gleam of other cubes like the first he\nhad seen. The aircars, it seemed, were either sentinels, at the lip of\nthe crater, or were the dwelling places of sentinels--and the cubes\nwere those sentinels!\n\nIt seemed absurd, but it came to Sarka in a flash that that was the\nanswer, and his eyes came back to the first cube, because it was\nnearer and more easy to study.\n\n\"I will not be swayed by the will of the thing,\" Sarka told himself.\n\"Nor will I allow it to analyze me! Jaska, do you do likewise!\"\n\nBeside him, Jaska shivered. He turned to look at her. Her face was\ncoldly white, and her eyes were big with terror and fascination as she\nstared at that first cube, resting so balefully there under the first\naircar.\n\nHe shook her, and she seemed to bring her eyes to his with a terrific,\nwill-straining effort.\n\n\"Look at me!\" he told her, telepathically. \"Keep your eyes on me, for\nto look at the cube spells danger!\"\n\nBut his own eyes went back to the thing, and he studied it closely. A\ncold chill raced through his body as he noted that its gleam was\nbecoming dull, fading slowly out. It had gleamed brightly at first,\nand now was losing its sheen, fading away to invisibility. He thought\nhe should be able, regardless of gleam or color, to see its outline;\nbut its outline, too, seemed to be becoming faint, indistinct.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen, in a trice, it was gone, and a feeling of uneasiness, more\ncompelling than he had ever known before, coursed through the soul of\nSarka. Where had the cube gone? What was it? What was its purpose? He\ntore his eyes away from the spot where he had last seen it, and stared\naway to the shadow beneath the second nearest aircar, where he had\nglimpsed another of the cubes.\n\nThe cube there, too, was fading out.\n\n\"Sarka! Sarka! Look!\" came to his brain the thoughts of Jaska.\n\nSarka turned and stared at her, and a feeling of fear for which he\ncould not account at all took fast hold of him. The eyes of Jaska,\nwide and staring as they had been when he commanded her to look away\nfrom the cube under the aircar, were staring at that flat, table-like\nrock, off to his right.\n\nThere, almost in the center of the rock, a gleaming something was\ntaking shape! Just a dull spot, in the center of the yellow glow; then\nthe beginning of the outline of a cube. Then, all at once, the cube\nitself, gleaming and baleful!\n\nSarka gasped in terror. He had seen the cube vanish, its glow\ndisappear, and now here it was, almost close enough to touch, on a\nrock beside him, gleaming and baleful as before! That it was the same\ncube he had seen under the first aircar, he somehow knew without being\ntold. That it was a sentient _thing_ he also knew, for now there was\nno mistaking the fact that, but for the presence in the little hollow\nof Jaska and Sarka, the cube would not have moved.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSwift as light, Sarka's right hand darted to his belt, where his ray\ndirector should be nestled against his need of it. And with his first\nmovement, the cube's brilliance vanished instantly, the cube\ndisappeared, and appeared again right before the face of Sarka, so\nclose he could touch it! Yet he did not turn the ray director against\nit, nor did he extend his hand to touch the thing--because he was\nafraid to do so!\n\nEven as the cube appeared before his eyes, thrice baleful and menacing\nin its close proximity, his eyes darted back to that broad flat rock,\nwhere the second gleaming cube now appeared!\n\n\"Great God, Jaska!\" he sent mentally, \"what does it mean?\"\n\n\"These,\" she answered bravely back, \"are Moon-soldiers! And, unless\nwe manage not to appear furtive, we are undone!\"\n\nStill Sarka made no move, while other gleaming cubes appeared on the\nflat rock. Five other cubes appeared beside the first, at the rim of\nthe hollow which held the forms of Jaska and Sarka. The cubes were\nclosing on them, oddly like a squad of Earthlings in the olden times,\nadvancing by rushes against an entrenched enemy!\n\nThe buzzing sound which they had first heard now seemed accentuated,\nbut, instead of being outside of the listeners, seemed inside them,\nhammering against their very brains! Messages were being sent to them,\nor passed back and forth between and among the cube-men about\nthem--and they hadn't the slightest idea how to make answer, know\nwhether an answer was expected of them, or what the cube-men thought\nabout them!\n\nSince there was nothing else to do, they lay there, hands clasped, as\nchildren in the dark clasp hands, and waited for what might transpire.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly the discord from the inside of the crater ceased, and all was\nstill, while it came to Sarka that the cube-men who stood before him\nwere in grim communication with something invisible to Sarka and\nJaska, somebody, perhaps, deep in the bowels of the Moon, over inside\nthe crater.\n\nThey knew, those two, that the cube-soldiers were reporting their\npresence, and asking instructions; that the Moon had gone silent to\nlisten, and that within a few moments their fate would be decided.\nWhat should they do?\n\nIn his hand Sarka held his ray director, with which he knew he could\nblast one or all of the cubes into nothingness. But still he held his\nhand, made no move.\n\nSomething, however, had to be done, for the discord was starting\nagain, growing in volume. It made Sarka think, oddly enough, of a deaf\nmute fighting for speech! Then came the first intelligible sound....\n\nA burst, from the depths of the crater, of sardonic laughter!\n\n\"Dalis!\" said Sarka, and moved. While Sarka moved, Jaska held fast to\nhis arm. Casting her fear to the winds, furious because of the\nlaughter of Dalis, Sarka thrust his ray director back into his belt\nand stood upright.\n\nBending over he seized the first of the gleaming cubes and hurled it\nover the edge of the crater, saw it start plummeting down. But even\nbefore it fell out of sight within the crater its gleam had dulled\nuntil it was almost impossible to see the thing. Racing as though\nracing against time, Sarka caught up cube after cube and hurled them\nall after the first.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOut of the crater there came no sound of heavy objects striking,\nthough Sarka felt there should have, for the cubes were almost as\nheavy as a man.\n\nThen his hair almost stood on end under his helmet, for under that\nfirst aircar, where he had first seen it, the initial cube was again\ngleaming into life!\n\nThe thing had dissolved while being hurled over the rim, and reformed\nin its proper place, its station as silent sentinel under the aircar!\n\nThese cubes then, were indeed sentinels--sentinels impossible to\ninjure. Though no force had been used against Sarka and Jaska, Sarka\nhad the feeling that they were powerless, and that here on the edge of\na crater of the Moon awful forces were being mustered against them.\nMustered slowly, sluggishly, yet surely, as though the mentality which\nmustered them knew them helpless, and that there was no need to hurry!\n\nAs for Jaska, she merely clung to Sarka and waited--trusting him no\nmatter what might transpire.\n\nOn a blind chance, Sarka brought out his ray director again, turned\nits muzzle toward that invisibly-blue column, pressed with his\nfingers, moving the director back and forth.\n\nInstantly the blue column seemed to break short off, while the broken\nupper portion started racing outward toward the Earth. Sarka watched\nit, and noted that the yellowish glow on the Earth, even as he\nwatched, was fading out--disappearing!\n\n\"If the ray will smash the blue column, Jaska,\" he said, \"it will also\ndestroy its source! Come! We will go look for it!\"\n\nAnd, holding her hand tightly, he rose to his feet and strode boldly\ndown the inner slope of the vast crater.\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n_The Crater Gnomes_\n\nIt seemed to Sarka, as he moved down the inner slope of the crater,\nthat the cubes were somehow making sport of him, laughing at him,\nthough no hint of laughter or anything resembling laughter emanated\nfrom them.\n\nBut, shutting his lips grimly, holding fast to Jaska's hand, he\nproceeded on, reached the lower portion of the inner slope, where it\ndropped off into a seeming black abyss, and dropped, keeping to a safe\nspeed because of the fact that both he and Jaska were attired for\nmovement in the air--though their manner of aerial transportation\ncould scarcely be called flying.\n\nThe anti-gravitational ovoids simply rendered ineffectual the law of\ngravity.\n\nDown they dropped, endlessly it seemed, while all about them, growing\ngradually, a bluish glow began to make itself manifest. Sarka turned\nand looked at the face of Jaska and noted that it--all her being--was\nglowing with this strange radiance.\n\nHe smiled at her, and she smiled back.\n\nLooking down now, to what seemed still a vast depth, they could see\nfigures moving, tiny, almost infinitesimal, about a great circular\ncone, out of the depths of which came that strange bluish column whose\nouter tip touched the Earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome inner sense warned Sarka not to touch that column, or to permit\nJaska to do so. They dropped down beside it, while Sarka, for no\nreason that he could assign, once more took his ray director in his\nfree hand and held it in readiness. It seemed so tiny and futile--so\nfoolish for two people, one of them a woman--to go into the very heart\nof an alien world, against an unknown enemy, armed with such a tiny\nweapon. Two people against unguessed myriads, whose very nature was an\nenigma, even to Sarka.\n\nCloser now appeared the bottom of the crater, whose floor seemed to be\ncovered with something that looked like blue sand, or rock. From this\nbluish substance the glow which bathed the two Earthlings seemed to\nemanate.\n\nThe funnel of the crater had now given away to the immensities of\nspace, in all directions, and the cold of outside was being replaced\nby a warmth which promised soon to be even uncomfortable.\n\nThen, without a jar, the two landed at the bottom of the crater, side\nby side, close enough almost to that great cone to touch it. Out of\nthe cone came that bluish column, to shoot up through the funnel down\nwhich the two had lightly dropped ... and the motion of the--whatever\nit was--was accompanied by a muted moaning sound, like that of a\ndistant waterfall.\n\nThey paused there, in amazement, taking stock of their surroundings.\nHuge tunnels, whose roofs were lost to invisibility in the bluish\nhaze, whose extremities could only be guessed at, reached off in all\ndirections. As far as the two could tell they were the only living\nsouls within the crater, though both knew better.\n\nSarka had the feeling, and he knew Jaska shared it with him, that\ninnumerable eyes were studying them, innumerable intellects were\ncataloguing them. And somehow he sensed the presence, somewhere near,\nof the traitor Dalis!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen that discordant sound again, breaking so swiftly that it fell\nupon the eardrums of Sarka and Jaska like the crack of doom. Out of\nthe many tunnels, from all directions, came hordes of beings which\nwould have made the nightmares of Paracelsus--first of the scientists\nof Earth--pale to insignificance.\n\nParacelsus had written and illustrated his nightmares. Had hinted of\nstrange acts of flesh-grafting--as the grafting of legs on the head of\nman. He had spoken, and written about, ghastly operations, from which\nmen came forth as part men, part spiders; part men, part scorpions,\ndogs, cats, crocodiles....\n\nSarka thought, as his mind went back to those ancient books of his\npeople in which still remained vestiges of the theories of Paracelsus,\nthat somehow, in his dreams, Paracelsus must have visited the craters\nof the Moon.\n\nThese people ... if they could be called people....\n\nThey had heads like the heads of Earthlings, broad-domed of brow,\nlacking eyelashes or lids, so that their eyes were perpetually\nstaring. They possessed no bodies at all, and their legs, thin and\nattenuated to the size of the wrists of average men, seemed to support\nthe massive heads with difficulty!\n\nFrom all directions they came, looking like spiders such as Sarka the\nFirst had described to Sarka, when Sarka had been a mere boy. They\ncame on the floor, out of the tunnels; they dropped from the walls of\nthe tunnels, and down from the invisible roofs, landing on the floor\nas lightly as feathers--and all converged on Jaska and Sarka.\n\nThey seemed to have no fear at all, but only a vast curiosity.\n\nCloser and closer they came.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJaska's grip tightened on the hand of Sarka, for one of the creatures,\nwith a spiderish leap, had jumped upon her, fastening its legs in her\ntight-fitting costume, where he hung, his face within an inch or two\nof hers. His lidless eyes, unblinking, stared deeply into hers.\n\nOthers jumped up beside the first, and still others clambered over\nSarka, until both Sarka and Jaska were covered by them like beetles\nattacked by ants. But these strange gnomelike creatures, who did not\nfear these strangers, apparently meant them no harm.\n\nThen, after a thorough scrutiny, began the strangest talking Sarka had\never heard. The crater-Gnomes seemed to communicate by making strange\nclucking sounds with their tongues, sounds which were unmusical and\ndiscordant, and which, as the Gnomes who stood back from them, because\nalready the two were covered until no more could cling to Jaska or\nSarka, joined in the speech--mounted in the cavern to a vast crescendo\nof sound.\n\nSarka knew then that this was the sound which had come out to them\nwhile they crouched at the crater rim. These were people of the Moon:\nbut if these were Moon-men, what, or who, were those gleaming cubes?\n\n\"Stand perfectly still,\" Sarka mentally admonished Jaska, \"they\napparently mean us no harm!\"\n\nHe had not spoken aloud, had not allowed his thought to reach any but\nJaska; yet instantly the discordant clucking ceased, and the Gnomes\nwere quiet, as though they politely listened to someone who had\ninterrupted them, yet whose interruption they resented, or were\ncurious about.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWondering how the creature would regard his action, Sarka reached\nforth and plucked away the first Gnome which had jumped upon Jaska,\nand placed him gently on the ground. The thing merely stared at Sarka\nwith his lidless eyes, as though wondering at Sarka's meaning. Then\nhis lips, which were triangular, rather than straight as those of\nEarthlings, began again that strange clucking.\n\nImmediately the Gnomes which clung to Jaska and Sarka dropped away,\nand scuttled into the midst of the myriads that stood and watched.\nThey did not understand the speech of these Earthlings, but they were\nunusually clever in comprehending the meaning of gestures.\n\n\"Hold fast to me, Jaska,\" thought Sarka toward her--and wondered anew\nas the Gnomes instantly ceased their clucking sounds--\"for I am going\nto try an experiment.\"\n\nHolding her hand still, he turned and strode straight toward the huge\ncone out of which rose the bluish column.\n\nInstantly the Gnomes broke into a frightful clucking of tongues, a\nsound that mounted to ear-drum-breaking intensity, and in a trice,\nclimbing over one another to get into position, they moved in between\nSarka and the cone. So eager were they to bar his further progress\nthat they stood atop one another, until the depth of them was as tall\nas Sarka standing upright.\n\nYet, though they plainly said to Sarka: \"You must not approach the\ncone,\" they did not seem to be angry with their visitors, but only\ncurious. Sarka looked at Jaska, noted how wanly she smiled.\n\nThen he turned, and headed for the nearest of the monster tunnels.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nInstantly he detected a surprising eagerness in the renewed clucking\nof tongues, while the Gnomes raced ahead, behind, all about the two,\ncapering like pet animals, showing these strangers the way into the\ntunnel.\n\nAs they entered it, Sarka tried to discover whence came the bluish\nglow. The floor seemed to be of bluish sandstone, though its color,\ntoo, might have been caused by the glow. It was warm, too, so warm\nthat perspiration was breaking out on the cheeks of Sarka.\n\nWhence came the glow? Apparently from the very walls of the tunnel, or\nits roof; but surely from somewhere, surely from some secret place,\nwhence it was diffused all over.\n\n\"And Jaska,\" said Sarka, \"the Moon, according to my father's\nresearches, is literally honeycombed with craters like this one!\"\n\nAgain, as he thought, that strange, sudden cessation of the clucking\nof the Gnomes. Whither were they leading them? It was plain to be seen\nthat the Gnomes were heading for some destination, almost herding\nSarka and Jaska toward it. Capering creatures, who behaved witlessly,\nyet were far from witless. If Sarka were not sadly mistaken, these\nwere Moon-men--and women, too, perhaps, since he could not tell the\nsex of them--and those gleaming cubes were their outer guards, perhaps\nslaves.\n\nIf the cubes were really of metal--they had felt warm to Sarka's\ntouch--then these Moon-men had gone further in science than\nEarthlings, as they had imbued at least some metals, or stones, with\nintelligence sufficiently advanced for them to perform actions\nindependently of their masters' wills.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka, too, was remembering another thing: that he had touched one of\nthese Gnomes, to remove it from Jaska--and had felt a distinct shock\nthat was patently electrical!\n\nThe bluish glow was increasing, becoming more soft and mellow, shading\ngradually into golden, as they advanced--shading still as they\npreceded until it was almost white, almost blinding, in its radiance.\n\nThen, of a sudden, the clucking of the Gnomes ended, and the creatures\nceased their capering, fell into something that might have been an\nordered military formation, and with Jaska and Sarka in the midst of\nthem, moved straight toward a broad expanse of the tunnel wall, in the\nface of which appeared three long lines, deeply cut in the shape of a\ntriangle.\n\nThe Gnome who had first leaped upon Jaska advanced to the wall, paused\nwith his face almost against the lower line of the triangle, and\nremained there, intently staring, while the other Gnomes remained\nmute and unmoving.\n\nStronger and stronger appeared the blinding light. Slowly the inner\nportion of the triangle began to give inward, like a door. And out of\nthe opening came that blinding radiance.\n\nAs the triangular door stood entirely open, Sarka and Jaska stood in\nthunderstruck silence, staring like people bereft of their senses. For\nthere, standing in the opening, the now white radiance itself a mantle\nto cover her, was a woman, unclothed save for the radiance, who might\nhave been of the Earth, save that she was more beautiful than any\nwoman of Earth.\n\nBeside her the radiant beauty of Jaska paled, became wan and sickly.\n\nBut Sarka noted immediately her eyes, whose depths bewildered, amazed\nhim. For in them he could see no expression, no feeling, but only\nabysmal cruelty. That she was Sarka's master, and Jaska's master, and\nmaster of all these Gnomes, became instantly apparent for\ntelepathically she addressed Sarka.\n\n\"I am busy now. The Moon-people will hold you prisoners in the Place\nof the Blue light, until I am ready to give you to the Cone!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n_The Place of the Blue Light_\n\nSo the Gnomes were Moon-people, masters of the Moon cubes! And people\nand cubes were ruled by a woman who resembled a woman of Earth!\n\nThe Gnomes took them back the way they had come.\n\nWhere, Sarka wondered, were the people of the Gens of Dalis? And where\nwas Dalis himself! Sarka was sure that, in those first discords which\nhad come out of the crater, he had heard at least a hint of the\nlaughter of Dalis.\n\nAnd this woman clothed in radiance--who was she? And what? That she\nwas a creature of the Moon, and yet resembled in all ways a woman of\nEarth, save that she was more beautiful than any woman Sarka had ever\nseen, seemed almost impossible to believe. Yet he had seen her. So had\nJaska, and as Sarka and Jaska, with the capering Gnomes still about\nthem, were led away to a fate at which they could only guess, Sarka\nwondered at Jaska's silence and at the strange lack of expression on\nher face.\n\nHe pressed her hand, but somehow she failed to return the pressure,\nmystifying more than ever. This sudden coldness was not like Jaska.\n\nBack they went through the vast cavern where the cone of the bluish\ncolumn still moaned and murmured. Sarka moved as close to the cone as\nthe Gnomes would permit, and peered up along the mighty length of the\ncolumn. At its tip was still the Earth, like a star viewed from the\nbottom of a deep well.\n\nSmaller, too, it seemed, which proved that Sarka's breaking of the\nblue column had been but momentary, that the column had almost\ninstantly regained its contact with the Earth. What was its source,\nwhat the composition of the column?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the moment there could be no answer to the question. Now the Gnomes\nwere escorting them into another tunnel, whose glow was even bluer\nthan that which the two had experienced in the other tunnels. And the\ndeeper they penetrated, the more distant from the cavern of the Cone,\nthe deeper in color became that light.\n\nFinally the Gnome who had mentally asked permission of the Radiant\nWoman to show her Jaska and Sarka passed before another expanse of\nwall, identical in appearance with that of the wall of the triangle\nfrom which the Radiant Woman had appeared.\n\nThis time the Gnome managed ingress by a strange clucking sound, with\nhis triangular lips held close to the base-line of the triangle.\n\nNow the door swung open; but the radiance which now came out was not\nclear white, as in the case of the outer door, but deeply, coldly\nblue. For the first time the Gnomes used force with their prisoners,\nthus proving to them that they were indeed prisoners. Their tiny feet\ncaught at Sarka and at Jaska, and forced them through the door, which\nswung shut behind them.\n\nSarka looked at Jaska who, in this strange new light, had taken on the\ncolor of indigo, and smiled at her. She did not return his smile, but\nher eyes looked deeply, somewhat sorrowfully, into his. As though she\nasked him a question he could not understand, to which he could\ntherefore give no answer.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka was now conscious of the fact that the heat of their\nprison-house--whose character they did not as yet know--was becoming\nalmost unbearable. They were alone, too, for the Gnomes had not\nentered the door of triangle. Sarka partially removed his life mask,\nand testing the atmosphere of the place, found it capable of being\nbreathed without the mask. He signalled mentally to Jaska to remove\nher mask, and when the girl had done so he took her in his arms and\nkissed her on the lips.\n\nShe accepted his caress, but did not return it, and her eyes still\npeered deeply into his.\n\n\"Well, beloved,\" he said. \"I am terribly sorry. But I did not want you\nto come because I was afraid that something of this sort would\nhappen.\"\n\nShe did not answer.\n\n\"What is it, Jaska?\" he said at last.\n\n\"What did you think of that woman?\" she asked softly.\n\n\"Beautiful!\" he said enthusiastically. \"Fearfully beautiful! But did\nyou see her eyes? She had no more mercy in her heart than if she were\nmade of stone! And she hated us both the moment she saw us!\"\n\n\"And you, Sarka--did you hate her, too?\"\n\nSarka stared at her, not comprehending.\n\n\"I feel,\" he said, \"that if we are ever to escape her, we must kill\nher, or render her incapable of retaining us!\"\n\nThen, of her own accord, Jaska placed her arms around Sarka, and gave\nhim her lips. Her new behavior was as incomprehensible to Sarka as her\nformer enigmatic expression had been. Wise in the ways of science was\nSarka, but he knew nothing of women!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow hand in hand again, they began a survey of their prison house. The\nbluish glow was unbearable to the eyes, and tears came unbidden and\nran down the cheeks of the prisoners. In a minute or two, perspiration\nwas literally bathing the bodies of the two. After a questioning\nexchange of glances, Sarka swiftly divested himself of his costume,\nstripping down to the gray toga of Earth's manhood. With a shrug,\nJaska removed her clothing to her own toga, and the two suits Sarka\ncarried under his arm.\n\nThey started ahead, exploring, then sprang back with a cry of fright.\nSarka did not know whether it was Jaska or himself who had cried out;\nfor just as they moved forward, a rent opened in the floor at their\nfeet, and their eyes for a moment--they could stand no longer--peered\ninto a bluely flaming abyss which, save for the color, reminded Sarka\nof the word pictures of Hell he had read in Earth's books of\nantiquity!\n\nAs the two stepped back, the rent in the floor closed instantly. Sarka\nhad noted where the end of it had been, and started to detour, his\neyes on the floor.\n\nOver to his left the bluely glowing wall reached up to invisible\nimmensity. But as he would have passed along the wall, the rent opened\nagain, effectually barring his way.\n\nBeyond the rent he could see a vast continuation of the cavern, and he\nfelt that, could they only pass the rent, they might reach a place\nwhere the heat was not so unbearable, and they could stay and talk in\ncomfort.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nReleasing Jaska, he stepped back and prepared to leap the spot where\nthe rent had been. High he jumped, and far, surprised at the length of\nhis own leap. He landed lightly, far beyond the area where the rent\nhad been, and even as he landed, a rent opened again at his feet, thus\neffectually barring further progress!\n\n\"It could just as easily,\" he told himself, \"have opened under my\nfeet, and dropped me into the abyss!\"\n\nFrom behind him came the sudden sound of screaming. He whirled to look\nback, to see Jaska standing there, arms outstretched toward him, her\neyes wide with fear and horror, and as he stood watching, she raced to\nhim, unmindful of abysses that might open under her feet, and flung\nherself into his arms.\n\n\"Come back!\" she moaned. \"Come back! Don't you see? _They_ don't wish\nyou to explore further! We are in their power, and must simply await\ntheir pleasure, whoever or whatever they are! They see all we do!\"\n\nSo they turned back, and stood against the door which held them\nprisoners; and the heat of the place seemed to enter into them, to\ngnaw at their very vitals. After a time Sarka found himself almost\ntearing at his throat, fighting for breath.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGasping, the tears bathing their cheeks until even their tears and\ntheir perspiration would flow no more, they huddled now just inside\nthe massive stone door, arms about each other, and almost prayed for\ndeath. Sarka at least prayed for death for both of them; but Jaska\nprayed for a way of deliverance, prayed that herself and Sarka might\nsomehow win free, and be together again.\n\nSarka, who knew little of women, marveled at the grandeur of her\ncourage, and wondered that he really knew this radiant woman so\nlittle. He compared her in his mind with the unclothed woman who had\nordered them here as prisoners, and it came to him that Jaska was all\nperfection, all tender womanhood, while the Radiant Woman was a\nmonster, without soul or compassion--a creature of horror who mocked\nGod with her outward seeming of perfection.\n\nJaska read his thoughts, and smiled wanly to herself, and Sarka\nwondered how, suffering as he knew she must be suffering, she could\nfind the courage to smile.\n\nThen, for a time, the two became comatose, mastered by the blue heat,\nand in dreamlike imaginings wandered in strange fields which could\nonly, to these two, have been racial memories, since neither had ever\nseen such fields. There were cool streams, all a-murmur, and breezes\nwhich cooled their sun-tanned cheeks. Water touched their tongues, and\ncooled their whole bodies as they gratefully imbibed it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn their wanderings, in which Sarka was a faun and Jaska a nymph, they\ntalked together in a language which only these two comprehended--a\nlanguage which dealt in figures of speech, a language which depended\nupon handclasps for periods, glances of the eyes for commas, and the\nsinging of their hearts for complete understanding.\n\nThen a cool breeze, cool by comparison, caressed their pain-distorted\ncheeks, and the Gnomes came in, found them lying there, and clucked\nendlessly as though wondering what to do with them.\n\nFrom hand to tiny hand, their feet serving as hands, the Gnomes passed\ngarments--garments of the Gens of Dalis, and clothed again the two\nwhom the Place of the Blue Light had all but slain. Of that ghastly\nexperiment Sarka retained but one real memory....\n\nThat bluish light, in the midst of the abyss, shifting and swaying\nlike blue serpents swimming in Hades ... that bluish light of the\nCone, which he had broken up for a brief moment by the use of his ray\ndirector. Was this bluish light in the abyss the source of the light\nin the Cone? If one were to destroy it at its source....\n\nThe two regained consciousness completely as the triangular door\nclosed behind Sarka and Jaska and the Gnomes, and they were taken into\nthe refreshing coolness of the tunnel, led back again in the direction\nof the room where they had seen the Radiant Woman. Both Jaska and\nSarka noticed that they were clothed in new clothing, and a shy blush\ntinged the cheeks of Jaska as her eyes met those of Sarka.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis time they entered the vast chamber of radiance behind the first\ntriangular door, and were forced to their knees to do obeisance to the\nRadiant Woman, who sat on a gleaming yellow stone for dais! The guards\nwho forced Sarka and Jaska to their knees, were clothed in the green\nof the Gens of Dalis, and Dalis himself, his face stern, but bearing\nno sign of recognition of these two, stood at the right hand of the\nRadiant Woman!\n\n\"You come to us as spies,\" the thought of the Radiant Woman impinged\nupon the brains of Sarka and of Jaska, \"and as spies you should be\ngiven to the Cone. But if you swear eternal allegiance to me, to obey\nme in all things, to forego your allegiance to Earth, your lives will\nbe spared! What say you?\"\n\nBoldly Sarka stared into the almost opaque eyes of the woman. Then his\nglance went to the face of Dalis.\n\n\"What,\" he asked boldly, in the language of Earth, \"does the traitor\nDalis say?\"\n\n\"I have sworn allegiance to Luar, who addresses you, and am her ally\nin all things! I have but one addition to make to what she says: Jaska\nbelongs to me!\"\n\nThe sudden leering grin of Dalis was hideous.\n\nSarka peered at Jaska, framing his answer. But Jaska spoke first.\n\n\"For myself, O Dalis,\" she said swiftly, \"I can answer in but one way.\nReturn me to the Place of the Blue Light, and forget me there!\"\n\nSarka smiled, while his heart leaped with joy.\n\n\"And I, O Luar,\" he said mentally to the Radiant Woman, \"prefer death\nwith Jaska, at the Place of the Blue Light, than life as a traitor to\nthe world of my nativity!\"\n\nInstantly Luar began the clucking sound which was the language of the\nGnomes, at the same time allowing her thoughts as she spoke to impress\nthemselves upon the brains of the prisoners.\n\n\"Take them away! Take them to the Cavern of the Cone, and when they\nhave suffered as much as such inferior beings are capable of\nsuffering, thrust them into the base of the Cone!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n_Cavern of the Cone_\n\nThe Gnomes had been bidden to take the prisoners to the Cavern of the\nCone, but to the surprise of Sarka and Jaska, they were taken back to\nthe Place of the Blue Light! This time the Gnomes entered the place\nwith them, closing and securing the door behind them.\n\nBut the Place of the Blue Light had changed!\n\nNow it had no floor of blue, as it had had before, but only a corridor\nperhaps wide enough to allow the passage of four grown men, walking\nside by side, while the abyss of which the two had got but the merest\nhint through the opening and closing rents filled all the center of\nthe place!\n\nThe Gnomes seemed impervious to the unendurable heat, and these,\nmoving together, one behind the other, one beside the other, one atop\nthe other, formed a living wall between Sarka and Jaska and the rim of\nthe flaming blue abyss, to protect them from the heat.\n\nYet through the bodies of this living wall of Gnomes, a wall which was\nhigher than the heads of Sarka and Jaska, the heat forced its way to\nthe prisoners, and burned them anew with its agony.\n\nTo what dread rendezvous were they going? Where, save for the few\nguards at the house of Luar, were the people of the Gens of Dalis?\nSarka felt, somehow, that the answers to all these questions would\nsoon be made manifest, and a feeling of exaltation he could not\nexplain was possessing him as he advanced. Around the corridor, whose\none side was the wall reaching up to invisibility, whose other side\ndropped off into the abyss, the Gnomes herded the prisoners.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe leader of the Gnomes was again the Gnome who had first leaped upon\nJaska to examine her curiously. Now, watching the lidless eyes of this\nbeing, Sarka fancied he could detect a hint of some expression. The\nGnome was excited at some prospect, some climax which they were\napproaching. What? On and on they moved. The blue flames from the\nabyss, roaring in a way that neither of the prisoners had ever\nexperienced, reached upward in searing tongues toward the invisible\nroof of this place.\n\nThen, when they had progressed far from the door of entry, Sarka\ngasped at a new manifestation. Out of the abyss, some distance ahead,\ncame a gleaming thing, something that had apparently evolved itself\nout of the flames of the abyss. Blue of color it was, because of the\nflames from the pit; but Sarka recognized it with a start which he\ncould not suppress nor understand.\n\nIt was one of those cubes, such as he and Jaska had seen at the lip of\nthe Moon-crater! As they approached, guided by the Gnomes, other cubes\nappeared out of the abyss, others in numbers swiftly augmented, until\na veritable battalion of them had marshalled itself, there at the lip\nof the abyss.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStraight toward these cubes the Gnomes led Sarka and Jaska, and when\nthey had reached the center of the group, they halted, forming a\ncircle, still a wall to mask the prisoners from the heat of the abyss.\nThe leader of the Gnomes stopped with his face, his lidless eyes,\nclose to one of the cubes.\n\nFor a moment he paused thus, and Sarka felt sure that somehow the\nGnome was holding thought converse with the cube; but, try as he\nmight, he could find no meaning in the weird conversation for himself.\nIt was oddly like listening to a conversation in a code beyond his\nknowledge.\n\nThen the Gnome turned back to Sarka and Jaska. By a pressure of tiny\nfeet, he tried to indicate that Sarka and Jaska should unclasp their\nhands. But they only clung the tighter, and now threw their arms about\neach other.\n\nThe Gnome desisted, much to the joy of the lovers, while Sarka studied\nthe cubes, wondering what their mission was with Jaska and himself.\n\nSlowly, together, the cubes began to lose their bluish glow, their\ncube shape--to vanish utterly.\n\nIn a trice, still locked in each other's arms, Sarka and Jaska saw the\nGnomes through what appeared to be an even bluer haze. Besides, the\nheat of the abyss no longer tortured them, and their bodies were\ncooling in a way that was unbelievably refreshing.\n\n\"What is it, beloved?\" whispered Jaska. \"What is it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka stared at the Gnomes, now in retreat, capering as they had first\ncapered when the two had fallen into their hands, toward the door by\nwhich all had entered. Mystified, Sarka put forth his hand. It came in\ncontact with something solid, and oddly warm, which stirred an\ninstantly responsive chord in the brain of Sarka.\n\nThis feeling was the same as he experienced when he had lifted those\ncubes and hurled them into the crater--where they had dissolved in\nfalling, and instantly reappeared, each under its own aircar!\n\n\"Jaska!\" he explained. \"Jaska! The cubes have dissolved themselves,\nand have reformed in the shape of a globe, as a protective covering\nabout us, to protect us from the heat of the abyss! Apparently we are\nnot to be killed at once! These cubes are slaves of the Gnomes, of\nwhom Luar is ruler!\"\n\nThey were indeed locked inside a globe, a globe whose integral parts\nwere the cubes of their acquaintance; and the atmosphere of the\ninterior was not uncomfortable, but otherwise. Sarka and Jaska were\nfeeling normal for the first time since they had landed on the Moon.\nBut what was the meaning of this strange imprisonment?\n\nThey were soon to know!\n\nFor the globe which enclosed them, moved to the edge of the flaming\nabyss, and dropped into the bluish glow! It did not drop heavily, like\na falling object on Earth, but rather floated downward, right into the\nheart of the flames. At this new manifestation of the strangeness of\nscience on the Moon, Sarka was at once all scientist himself, striving\nto find adequate answers for things which, from cause to effect, were\nentirely new to him. With Jaska still clasped close against him, he\nseated himself in the base of the globe and studied the area through\nwhich they were passing.\n\nBlue flames which seemed to be born somewhere, an infinite distance\nbelow them; blue flames which he knew to be the element that, shot\noutward from the great cone, had forced the Moon away from the Earth.\n\nNo sound of the roaring flames came through the globe, but every\nmovement of them was visible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka turned and peered through the bottom of the globe; but all he\ncould see below were the flames, a molten indigo lake of them. Now, as\nthey floated downward, the glow was giving away to lighter blue, to\nwhite, almost pure white, like the radiance which covered Luar like a\nmantle.\n\nSarka felt himself on the eve of vast important discoveries, and the\nscientist in him made him, for the moment, almost forget the woman at\nhis side. Jaska, unbothered about anything, now that Sarka was at her\nside, regarded his expression of deep concentration with a tolerant\nsmile.\n\nWhiter now was the light, and faster fell the globe which held the\ntwo.\n\nThe color of the globe, now fallen below the area of blue, had taken\non, chameleonlike, the color of the white flames that bathed it.\n\nThen, apparently right in the center of a lake of white flames, though\nSarka could see no solid place on which the globe had landed, the\nglobe came to rest.\n\nNow everything was plain to see, and Sarka studied his surroundings\nwith new interest. He felt a mounting sensation of scalp-prickling\nhorror.\n\nFor, scattered throughout the lake of white flames, in all directions,\nas far as the eye could reach--standing alone, suffering untold\nagonies, from the expressions on their faces--were people of the Gens\nof Dalis!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo longer were they clothed in green and wearing on breast and back\nthe yellow stars of their Gens. Now they were nude as they had come\ninto the world and standing there, each was holding out hands in\nhorror, to hold back myriads of the Gnomes, who would have forced them\nto submerge themselves in the white flames of the lake!\n\nWas the Gens of Dalis being burned alive? What was the meaning of\nthis?\n\nFor a moment, filled with horror, Sarka looked away from the\nspectacle. Off to his right, as he sat, he noted that the flames,\nwhich here seemed lighter than they had in high levels, were\nconverging on a single spot toward the side of the lake of white\nflames--as smoke converges on the base of a chimney leading outward to\nthe air!\n\nHe knew as he stared that he was gazing at the spot where the bluish\ncolumn of the cone was born!\n\nShaking his head, he turned back to the mighty spectacle of this\nhorrible thing that was being done to the people of the Gens of Dalis.\n\nIn his brain there suddenly crashed a thought whose source he could\nonly guess at, whose meaning mystified him more than anything yet\nexperienced. The thought might have emanated from Luar, or from Dalis.\nBut the more he thought of the matter, the more he thought how the\nphrasing of the thought was like the telepathy of Sarka the Second,\nnow thousands of miles away, upon the Earth. And this was the thought:\n\n\"If they fight the flames, the flames will destroy them! If they go\ninto them freely, voluntarily, they will be rendered immune to heat\nand to cold, to life and to death. But it is better that they die, for\nEarth's sake!\"\n\nWhat did it mean?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka thought of the radiant white light which perpetually bathed the\nperson of Luar, and thought that he had somehow been given a hint of\nits source. If the Gens of Dalis were voluntarily bathed in the lake\nof white flames, would they become as Luar?\n\nSomehow, though he knew that such bathing would save their lives, the\nidea filled him anew with horror. He found himself torn between two\nduties. If he sent his thought out there to the Gens of Dalis, people\nof Earth, his people, they would be saved, but might forever become\nallies of the people of the Moon. If Sarka did not tell them, they\nwould die--and there were millions of them.\n\nBut his science had always been a science of Life, and it still was.\n\n\"Enter the flames!\" he telepathically bade his people. \"Enter the\nflames!\"\n\nBut they did not heed him, and for the first time the atmosphere of\nthe interior of the globe seemed filled with savage, abysmal menace!\nPlain to Sarka was the meaning of that menace: The cubes which\ncomposed this globe were loyal to their masters, the masters to a\nmistress, Luar, and would countenance no meddling.\n\nLikewise it was impossible, if the Gnomes willed it to the cubes, for\nSarka to transmit his thoughts to the Gens of Dalis through the\ntransparent walls of the globe!\n\nThey were prisoners, indeed, of Dalis and of Luar!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut could Sarka and Jaska turn their new-found knowledge to their own\nuse? Sarka was thinking back, back to one of the ancient tomes of his\npeople. It spoke, someplace, of a man who had got trapped in the heart\nof a seething volcano, where the heat of it had cured him of his\nillnesses, made him whole again, given him new youth and freshness.\n\nBut since the cubes could forestall his transmission of thought, and\nperhaps could read and understand thoughts, how was he to tell Jaska?\nHow show her that a way of deliverance had been given into their\nhands, if they only possessed the courage to use it!\n\nAgain came that thought, which Sarka recognized as the telepathy of\nhis father:\n\n\"Courage! You will win, and Jaska with you!\"\n\nThoughts could come in to them then, but could not go out. Or did it\nmean that the cubes, or the masters of the cubes, did not care if the\nprisoners received messages from outside, because they knew themselves\ncapable of frustrating anything the prisoners planned? Perhaps. More\nthan likely that was it.\n\nBut, looking through the bottom of the globe, into the sea of white\nflames below, Sarka gripped more tightly his ray director, and tried\nto marshal the forces of his courage. There was surely some way of\nescape. Some way out of their strange predicament.\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n_Casting the Die_\n\nSomehow Sarka believed that this white radiance of the abyss held the\nsecret of the omnipotence of Luar, if omnipotence she possessed. That\nshe did seemed sure, else Dalis would not have been with her. Besides,\nshe had asked Sarka and Jaska to swear allegiance to her. Yes the\nsecret was here, in the heart of the lake of white flames.\n\nIt might have been the Moon Fountain of Youth, or of omnipotence.\nThere was no telling, unless Sarka tried an experiment.\n\nHis fury at Dalis now knew no bounds, and he was conscious of a\ndesire, too poignant almost to be borne, in some way to circumvent the\narch-traitor. For here in the craters of the Moon Dalis was working\nout a strange amplification of the scheme which he had, centuries\nbefore, proposed to Sarka the First. He was subjecting the people of\nhis Gens to the white flames.\n\nIf they immersed themselves voluntarily, they became as Luar was, but\nstill subservient to the will of Dalis--and, in his hands, invincible\ninstruments of war! Dalis had doubtless already been bathed in the\nflames. Sarka was not sure, for in the home of Luar the white light\nwas so blinding it would have been impossible to make sure that the\nwhite radiance clothed the others with Luar.\n\n\"That's it!\" said Sarka to himself. \"That's it! Dalis and those guards\nat the dais of Luar have already been subjected to the white flames!\nThe rest who immerse themselves, voluntarily, come forth as Luar and\nDalis! Who do not, die. Dalis' manner of forcing the survival of the\nfittest! His idea of the flood in grandfather's time, only now he\ncauses his selection by flames instead of flood! He believes that only\nthose worthy to survive, and to stand at his back in whatever he\nconceives to be his need, will guess the secret of the immersion. The\nothers will die!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat a terrible alternative, when Dalis could as easily have given the\nsecret to all his people! Could have told them how to save themselves!\nBut it was not Dalis' way. Here, in the beginning of what was to\nbecome a dual sovereignty of the Moon, Dalis had already taken thought\non the matter of over-population, and was destroying the many that the\nfew--the strongest, most ruthless--might survive! Hundreds of\nthousands, millions of the Gens of Dalis, stood at the door of life,\nand did not know how to enter, merely because Dalis withheld the key!\nAnd, pausing in terror before the flames, they died, when a step and a\nplunge would have saved them all!\n\n\"If he lives to be a million, if he lives through everlasting life,\"\nsaid Sarka to himself, \"and does penance through a thousand\nreincarnations, Dalis can never atone for this wholesale destruction\nof humanity! But I ... I wonder!\"\n\nSarka realized the nicety of the revenge of Dalis upon Jaska and\nhimself. Dalis had not given the secret to the prisoners, but by his\nuse of the cubes, he had plunged them into the very heart of the\nhorror, where they could see the suffering of the people of the Gens.\nThen, when they had seen and appreciated the horror of it all, they\nwould follow the people of the Gens to death!\n\nBut Luar had spoken of thrusting them into the base of the Cone!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen they were not for the flames after all! How could it be done? The\nglobe composed of the cubes had but to transport the prisoners to the\nbase of the Cone, press against that base, and open to let the\nprisoners free--and in the heart of the white-blue column they would\nbe hurled outward from the Moon, into space. The mere prospect of such\nhorror caused the perspiration to break forth anew on the body of\nSarka.\n\nBut there might be a way.\n\n\"I wonder,\" he asked himself, \"if the Earth people in _this_ crater\ncould read my thoughts in spite of their agonies, if I could get my\nthought to them through the globe? I wonder if, reading my thoughts,\nthey would obey?\"\n\nBit by bit, as parts of a puzzle fall into place, he made his plan,\nand his heart beat high with excitement. Jaska bent before him to look\ninto his eyes, and he knew that she was trying to read his face. She\nknew, wise Jaska, that this brilliant lover of hers was making a plan,\nand she believed in the sure success of it because it would be _his_!\n\nShe smiled at him, her courage high, and waited!\n\nHolding the ray director between his body and that of Jaska, he took a\nterrible, ghastly chance. Dalis had known the secret sign manual of\nthese two; but would the intelligence of the cubes comprehend it? He\nmust take the chance, slender as it seemed. His free hand began to\nspell out, with all speed, the mad plan he had conceived.\n\n\"The white flames are harmless if one plunges into them voluntarily.\nAre you afraid to attempt it? No? Then unfasten your clothing, and\nhave it so arranged that you can drop entirely out of it when I give\nyou the signal, which will be a mere widening of the eyes, like this!\nYou understand? We must go nude into the flames, so that they will\nbathe our whole bodies! But, when you slip out of your clothing, tear\nyour anti-gravitational ovoid from the skull-pan of your helmet, and\nhold it in your mouth! Then depend upon me, and have no fear!\"\n\n\"I have no fear,\" replied the fingers of Jaska. \"I go to death with\nyou if you wish--or to Life!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFeeling the menace of the cubes almost gripping at his throat as he\ngot into action, Sarka unfastened his own clothing, ripped the ovoid\nfrom his helmet, placed it in his mouth. Then, looking at Jaska, he\ngave her the signal.\n\nInstantly, at her nod, he brought forth the ray director, pressed it\nwith his fingers, directing its muzzle toward the curve of the globe,\nswinging it around in a circle, cutting out the bottom of the globe of\ncubes.\n\nThe action must have been one of untold surprise to the cubes which\nmade up the globe, for before anything could be done to stay the hand\nof Sarka, his ray director had cut out the bottom of the globe, and\nJaska and himself, divested now of all clothing, had fallen from the\nglobe.\n\nUnbearable heat slashed and tore at them. They still held hands, and\nwhen their feet touched upon something solid, they were gasping with\nthe unbelievable heat; and it was ripping at their lungs like talons\nof white hot steel. But, pausing not at all, Sarka raced ahead with\nJaska, and dived straight into the lake of white flames.\n\nAs he dived he directed his thoughts toward the people of the Gens who\nstood, undecided, dying by slow inches, on their little oases in the\nlake. And this was the thought, which was a command.\n\n\"Plunge into the flames! They will not hurt you! Plunge in, and obey\nmy commands, O people of the Gens of Dalis! I, Sarka, command that you\nobey me! Jaska, who commanded you at the will of Dalis, also commands.\nGather with Jaska and me at the base of the Cone! You have but to\nfollow the converging of the flames!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTogether the two plunged in, and it seemed all at once as though the\nfire had gone out of the white flames, for they were cool and soothing\nto the touch. Sarka could feel new life being borne in him, could feel\nhimself revitalized, exalted, lifted to the heights. He suddenly\nexperienced the desire to run, and shout his joy for all to hear. But\nreason held him. Not thus easily would Luar and Dalis, the traitor,\ngive over their designs against these two.\n\nBut in the heart of the flames, they dropped down, while they turned\ntheir faces toward the base of the Cone, or where they thought the\nbase to be, even as Sarka gave another command to the now invisible\npeople of the Gens of Dalis.\n\n\"Hold your ovoids in your mouths and follow! Obey my will!\"\n\nThey dropped now to what seemed to be cool flagstones, while above\nthem showed an orifice in a wall, into which those tongues of flame\nwere darting. They paused there, side by side, their faces radiant,\nand looked back the way they had come.\n\nComing out of the white flames, like battalions on parade, were the\npeople of the Gens of Dalis--scores and hundreds of them, who had\nsensed and heeded the mental commands of Sarka. Like genii appearing\nout of the flames they came, to muster about Sarka and Jaska.\n\nThen, when it seemed that no more were coming, Sarka turned to the\nbase of the Cone, his face high shining with courage and confidence,\nand stepped straight into the flames that led into the Cone. Beside\nhim came Jaska, while behind him came the people of the Gens of Dalis\nwho dared to do as he had commanded.\n\nThey were sucked into the Cone like chips sucked into a whirlpool, and\nSarka willed a last command as they entered:\n\n\"Quit the column at the lip of the crater, and muster about the\naircars!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n_The People of Radiance_\n\nThe exaltation of Sarka knew no bounds, and looking into the eyes of\nJaska, he knew she felt it, too. For her face was shining, and all of\nher, the wondrous shining brilliance of her, was bathed in the white\nradiance that mantled Luar. And now, since Jaska too knew that\nradiance, her beauty was greater even than that of Luar. Sarka\nthrilled anew at the glory of her.\n\nBut even as he stepped into the base of the Cone, he stepped out of\nthe blue column at the lip of the Moon-crater. Swift as light, and\nswifter, had been the flight upward from the Cavern of the Cone; yet,\nso keen were his perceptions, he knew when he had passed through the\nchamber of the bluish glow, into which he and Jaska had first dropped\nupon arrival.\n\nNow they were on the lip of the crater, and the people of the Gens who\nhad followed him, were slipping out of the blue column, like insects\nout of a flame, and converging on the aircars whose tentacles still\nwaved as they had when Sarka had last seen them.\n\nSarka looked at these people in amazement. To him there was a divinity\nnow about their nudeness which nudity never before had suggested to\nhim. For the people shone, and there was something glorious in those\ndivinely white bodies. They reminded Sarka of his people's books of\nantiquity, and his childhood's pictures of angels....\n\nBut the effect of those white flames!...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no explaining it. But Sarka felt that whatever he willed to\ndo he could do; that whatever he wished for was his, whether it was\nhis by right or no. He felt that he could move mountains, with only\nthe aid of his hands. Looking at Jaska he conceived all sorts of new\nbeauty in her, for she was the brightest, to him, of all the people\nwho had passed through the lake of white flames, and been cleansed in\ntheir heat.\n\n\"No wonder Luar has mastered the Moon!\" he cried to Jaska. \"For when\nshe was bathed in the white flames, her will is paramount!\"\n\n\"But how, if she passes the people of the Gens of Dalis through the\nflames, will she retain her sovereignty?\"\n\n\"Because Dalis, too, has passed through, and his will is the will of\nthe Gens! They will obey him, and he has sworn allegiance to Luar, or\ngiven some sort of oath of fealty!\"\n\n\"How strange that but one person on the Moon has been bathed in the\nwhite flames!\"\n\n\"How do we know,\" Sarka almost whispered it, \"that she is, originally,\nof the Moon? Does she not look too much like our people, to be from\nanother world entirely?\"\n\n\"I do not know, but ... you mean ... you mean...?\"\n\n\"I scarcely know; but Dalis would swear allegiance to no man, much\nless to a woman, unless he knew that man, or woman, far better than he\nhas had opportunity, in a matter of hours only, to know Luar!\"\n\nHe left it there then, as he strode boldly, with Jaska by his side, to\nthe nearest of the aircars.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he approached the car, the gleam cube beneath it seemed to gleam\nbrighter and brighter, as though it echoed the radiance of Sarka.\nSarka knew, studying this phenomenon, that he possessed at least a\nhint of the secret of Luar's omnipotence. There had been a hint\nbefore, but by now its meaning was clearer. The white flames, out of\nthe heart of the dying Moon, gave new life, exaltation, not only to\nthe bodies but to the brains of those who passed through it, and with\ntheir brains quickened, they possessed such knowledge as men of Earth,\nfor ages, had wished to possess.\n\nTransmutation of metals ... the ability, at will, to endow the higher,\nmore selective metals with intelligence ... and the ability to retain\ncommand of the intelligences thus endowed. This explained the power of\nLuar over the Gnomes, and the power of the Gnomes over the cubes--if\nthey possessed that power.\n\nBut the Gnomes, what of them? What were they?\n\nBut for a space Sarka must await the answer to that question, for\nthere was little time. Already he knew that the tale of his escape,\nand his taking over of a portion of the Gens of Dalis, must have gone\nlike wildfire through all the crater, and from this crater, perhaps,\nhad been transmitted to all the craters of the Moon. All the\ncraters....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThat explained to him the absence from the lake of white flames, where\nhe had seen so few, comparatively, of the people of Dalis' Gens. The\nMoon was honeycombed by such craters, and perhaps the white flame\nconnected them all, made them all one. And Luar commanded all from her\ndais in this crater Sarka and his people were escaping. The millions\nof the Gens had been swallowed by the craters of the Moon, at command\nof Luar, acceded to by Dalis--and all over the Moon the very things\nwhich Sarka and Jaska had witnessed were taking place.\n\nEven now, as Sarka raced for the aircar, and Jaska with him, he could\nfeel a backward pulling that was well-nigh invincible. Someone was\nwilling him to return, willing the Gnomes to pursue him, willing the\ncubes to refuse obedience to him; but he laughed and stepped to the\naircar, passing by the nearest writhing tentacle as though he knew it\npossessed no power to harm him. The tentacle swept aside, and did not\ntry to bar him, while he sent his will crashing against that brightly\ngleaming cube. \"Into the aircar! We enter with you!\"\n\nThe cube vanished instantly, and it seemed to Sarka that invisible\nhands caught at his feet, lifting him up through the trap-door in the\nbelly of the aircar, up and inside. The door swung shut, and in the\nforward end of the vast aircar gleamed the cube which had obeyed his\ncommand!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSarka sent one thought careening outward from the aircar, a command to\nthe cubes which stood watch beneath the other aircars.\n\n\"Obey the Radiant People, and through them, _me_!\"\n\nThe light of the cube made the interior of the aircar as light as day,\nand Sarka was struck at once with another phenomenon. He could see\nthrough the sides of the car in any direction.\n\nAnd what he saw filled him with a sudden fear!\n\nOut of the crater poured myriads of the Gnomes, and up the sides of it\ncame myriads of the gleaming cubes, all racing toward the cars.\n\n\"Get back! Get back!\" he commanded the Gnomes and the cubes.\n\nAt the same time he issued his commands to the cube within his own\ncar, and to the cubes which by now were inside the other aircars,\nrealizing that the cubes themselves were the motive power of the\naircars--and that his will was the will of these individual cubes.\n\n\"Fly at once! Fly outward at top speed toward the Earth!\"\n\nInstantly, as though a single signal had started all the cars, a dozen\naircars rose majestically from the crater, while Sarka studied the\nGnomes and the cubes in turmoil on the rim. He noted then, a strange\ncircumstance: that when he commanded the Gnomes and the pursuing cubes\nto keep back, they hesitated, dazedly, as though they did not know\nwhether to advance or to retreat; that when he merely watched them,\nthey came on.\n\nHe laughed aloud at this measuring of mental swords with Luar, and\nwith Dalis. For he could sense the conflict very plainly. She\ncommanded the Gnomes and the cubes to attack, he commanded them to\nretreat, and they remained undecided, like people drawn between two\nextremities, and uncertain which direction to take.\n\nUpward, side by side now, floated the aircars of the Moon, and in the\nforepeak of each, one of the gleaming cubes, like--like\nanti-gravitational ovoids of the Moon! At the fast falling rim of the\ncrater boiled the Gnomes and the cubes, stirring and tumbling,\nhampered by their very numbers, as they tried to attack at will of\nLuar and retreated in confusion at the will of Sarka.\n\nThen there was Jaska beside Sarka, her face fearful, as he pointed off\nacross the gloomy expanse of the Moon.\n\nFrom all sides, from all directions, from other craters which these\ntwo had not even seen, came scores and hundreds of the monster cars!\n\nThey had beaten Luar and Dalis but for a moment, then! Now, at her\ncommand, the countless other aircars were coming in to head them off,\nto fight them back to the surface of the Moon. It would be a race\nagainst time, and against death. But of at least a dozen of the\naircars, Sarka was master, and he did not fear the issue. That strange\nexaltation which the white flames had given him filled him with a\nconfidence that nothing could shake.\n\nHe shot a thought at the gleaming cube in the forepeak.\n\n\"Faster! Faster! There is no limit to your speed! Faster! Faster! Even\nfaster!\"\n\nInstantly the Moon seemed literally to drop away beneath the dozen\naircars which carried the Radiant People, while the aircars of Luar\nand of Dalis fell hopelessly behind.\n\nSure that they would win in this race now, since he was just beginning\nto realize the vastness of his power--the all-encompassing,\nall-mastering power of the human mind and will, which the white flames\nof the Moon had made almost god-like--Sarka turned his eyes toward a\ncoldly gleaming sphere in the star-spangled heavens ahead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the Earth, and it seemed ringed in flames! From its edges there\nseemed to shoot long streamers of yellow or golden flames, which broke\ninto sunlike pinwheels of radiance at their tips. Something, there on\nthe precious Earth, was decidedly wrong!\n\nInstantly, telepathically, he sought to gain mental contact with his\nfather.\n\n\"Father, we are coming!\" he said, across those countless miles. \"What\nis happening?\"\n\nFor a full minute there was no answer. Then it came, feeble, broken,\nweighted with fear; but it was a thought-message, unmistakably, of\nSarka the Second.\n\n\"Hurry, son! Hurry! For Dalis has indeed betrayed us! I could not\nmaintain control of the Earth with the Beryls, for some strange\ncatastrophe has destroyed all the Beryls in the area Dalis ruled! The\nshifting of positions of the Earth and the Moon has so altered the\nrelative effects of the pull of gravity exerted by the planets that\nMars has been brought into dangerous proximity to us and is already so\nclose that her ether-lights are playing over us! Surely you must be\nable to see them! We have received messages, but as yet I have only\nbeen partially able to decode them! What I have decoded, however,\npresages catastrophe--for I am sure that Mars and the Moon are in\nconfederation, and that the Moon-people have deliberately forced us\ninto contact with her ally!\"\n\nCold fear clutched at the throat of Sarka as he caught the message. He\ndecided not to tell Jaska for the moment. He looked to right and left,\nat the aircars on either side of him, then issued his commands.\n\n\"Faster! Faster! Be prepared to land in the area of the Gens of\nCleric, as close as possible to my laboratory!\"\n\nA strange, awesome sight, that flight of the rebels of Dalis' Gens\nfrom the Moon to the Earth--like gleaming stars across the void. Far\nout in Space they fled at terrific speed through almost utter\ndarkness, but their light was still blinding, lighting the way.\n\n(_Concluded in the next issue_)\n\n\n\n\nMurder Madness\n\nCONCLUSION OF A FOUR-PART NOVEL\n\n_By Murray Leinster_\n\n[Illustration: _The deck was covered with panic-stricken folk who had\ncome in awful terror to watch. And all were slaves to The Master._]\n\n[Sidenote: Bell has fought through tremendous obstacles to find and\nkill The Master, whose diabolical poison makes murder-mad snakes of\nthe hands; and, as he faces the monster at last--his own hands start\nto writhe!]\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nThe door of the car swung wide, and Ortiz's pale grim face peered in\nbehind the blue steel barrel of his automatic. He smiled queerly as\nJamison, with a grunt of relief, tapped Bell's wrist in sign to put\naway his weapon.\n\n\"Ah, very well,\" said Ortiz, with the same queer smile upon his face.\n\"One moment.\"\n\nHe disappeared. On the instant there was the thunderous crashing of a\nweapon. Bell started up, but Jamison thrust him back. Then Ortiz\nappeared again with smoke still trickling from the barrel of his\npistol.\n\n\"I have just done something that I have long wished to do,\" he\nobserved coolly. \"I have killed the chauffeur and his companion. You\nmay alight, now. I believe we will have half an hour or more. It will\ndo excellently.\"\n\nHe offered his hand to Paula as she stepped out. She seemed to shudder\na little as she took it.\n\n\"I do not blame you for shuddering, Senorita,\" he said politely, \"but\nmen who are about to die may indulge in petty spites. And the\nchauffeur was a favorite with the deputy for whom I am substituting.\nLike all favorites of despots, he had power to abuse, and abused it. I\ncould tell you tales, but refrain.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe car had come to a stop in what seemed to be a huge warehouse, and\nby the sound of water round about, it was either near or entirely\nbuilt out over the harbor. A large section near the outer end was\nwalled off. Boxes, bales, parcels and packages of every sort were\nheaped all about. Bell saw crated air engines lying in a row against\none wall. There were a dozen or more of them. Machinery, huge cases of\nfoodstuffs....\n\n\"The Buenos Aires depot,\" said Ortiz almost gaily. \"This was the point\nof receipt for all the manufactured goods which went to the _fazenda_\nof Cuyaba, Senor Bell. Since you destroyed that place, it has not been\nso much used. However, it will serve excellently as a tomb. There are\ncases of hand grenades yonder. I advise you to carry a certain number\nwith you. The machine guns for the air-craft, with their ammunition,\nare here....\"\n\nHe was hurrying them toward the great walled-off space as he talked,\nhis automatic serving as a pointer when he indicated the various\nobjects.\n\n\"Now, here,\" he added as he unlocked the door, \"is your vessel. The\nMaster bought only amphibian planes of late. Those for Cuyaba were\nassembled in this little dock and took off from the water. Your\ndestruction up there, Senor Bell, left one quite complete but\nundelivered. I think another, crated, is still in the warehouse. I\nhave been very busy, but if you can fuel and load it before we are\nattacked....\"\n\nThey were in a roofed and walled but floorless shed, built into the\nwarehouse itself. Water surged about below them, and on it floated a\nfive passenger plane, fully assembled and apparently ready to fly,\nbut brand new and so far unused.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I'll look it over,\" said Bell, briefly. He swung down the catwalk\npainted on the wings. He began a swift and hasty survey. Soot on the\nexhaust stacks proved that the motors had been tried, at least.\nEverything seemed trim and new and glistening in the cabin. The fuel\ntanks showed the barest trace of fuel. The oil tanks were full to\ntheir filling-plugs.\n\nHe swung back up.\n\n\"Taking a chance, of course,\" he said curtly. \"If the motors were all\nright when they were tried, they probably are all right now. They may\nhave been tuned up, and may not. I tried the controls, and they seem\nto work. For a new ship, of course, a man would like to go over it\ncarefully, but if we've got to hurry....\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Ortiz, and laughed, \"that haste would be desirable.\nHerr Wiedkind--No! _Amigo mio_, it was that damned Antonio Calles who\nlistened to us last night. I found pencil marks beside the listening\ninstrument. He must have sat there and eavesdropped upon me many weary\nhours, and scribbled as men do to pass the time. He had a pretty taste\nin monograms.... I gave all the orders that were needful for you to\ntake off from the flying field. I even went there myself and gave\nadditional orders. And Calles was there. Also others of The Master's\nsubjects. My treason would provoke a terrible revenge from The Master,\nso they thought to prove their loyalty by permitting me to disclose my\nplan and foil it at its beginning.\n\n\"I would have made the journey with you to The Master, but as a\nprisoner with the tale of my treason written out. So I returned and\nchanged the orders to the chauffeur, when all the Master's loyal\nsubjects were waiting at the flying field. But soon it will occur to\nthem what I have done. They will come here. Therefore, hasten!\"\n\n\"We want food,\" said Bell evenly, \"and arms, but mostly we want fuel.\nWe'll get busy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe shed his coat and picked up a hand-truck. He rammed it under a drum\nof gasoline and ran it to the walkway nearest to the floating plane.\nCoiled against the wall there was a long hose with a funnel at its\nupper end. In seconds he had the hose end in one of the wing\nfuel-tanks. In seconds more he had propped the funnel into place and\nwas watching the gasoline gurgling down the hose.\n\n\"Paula,\" he said curtly, \"watch this. When it's empty roll the drum\naway so I can put another in its place.\"\n\nShe moved quickly beside it, throwing him a little smile. She set\nabsorbedly about her task.\n\nJamison arrived with another drum of gas before the first was emptied,\nand Bell was there with a third while the second still gurgled. They\nheaped the full drums in place, and Jamison suddenly abandoned his\ntruck to swear wrathfully and tear off his spectacles and fling them\nagainst the wall. The bushy eyebrows and beard peeled off. His coat\nwent down. He began to rush loads of foodstuffs, arms, and other\nobjects to a point from which they could be loaded on the plane. Ortiz\npointed out the things he pantingly demanded.\n\nIn minutes, it seemed, he was demanding: \"How much can we take? Any\nmore than that?\"\n\n\"No more,\" said Bell. \"All the weight we can spare goes for fuel. See\nif you can find another hose and funnel and get to work on the other\ntank. I'm going to rustle oil.\"\n\nHe came staggering back with heavy drums of it. A thought struck him.\n\n\"How do we get out? What works the harbor door?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOrtiz pointed, smiling.\n\n\"A button, Senor, and a motor does the rest.\" He looked at his watch.\n\"I had better see if my fellow subjects have come.\"\n\nHe vanished, smiling his same queer smile. Bell worked frantically. He\nsaw Ortiz coming back, pausing to light a cigarette, and taking up a\nhatchet, with which he attacked a packing case.\n\n\"They are outside, Senor,\" he called. \"They have found the signs of\nthe car entering, and now are discussing.\"\n\nHe plucked something carefully from the packing box and went leisurely\nback toward the door. Bell began to load the food and stores into the\ncabin, with sweat streaming down his face.\n\nThere was the sound of a terrific explosion, and Bell jumped savagely\nto solid ground.\n\n\"Keep loading! I'll hold them back!\" he snapped to Jamison.\n\nBut when he went pounding to the back of the warehouse he found Ortiz\nlaughing.\n\n\"A hand grenade, Senor,\" he said in wholly unnatural levity. \"Among\nthe subjects of The Master. I believe that I am going mad, to take\nsuch pleasure in destruction. But since I am to die so shortly, why\nnot go mad, if it gives me pleasure?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe peered out a tiny hole and aimed his automatic carefully. It\nspurted out all the seven shots that were left.\n\n\"The man who poisoned me,\" he said pleasantly. \"I think he is dead. Go\nback and make ready to leave, Senor Bell, because they will probably\ntry to storm this place soon, and then the police will come, and\nthen.... It is amusing that I am the one man to whom those enslaved\namong the city authorities would look for The Master's orders.\"\n\nBell stared out. He saw a small horde of people, frantically agitated,\nmilling in the cramped and unattractive little street of Buenos Aires'\nwaterfront. Sheer desperation seemed to impel them, desperation and a\nfrantic fear. They surged forward--and Ortiz flung a hand grenade. Its\nexplosion was terrific, but he had perhaps purposely flung it short.\nBell suddenly saw police uniforms, fighting a way through to the front\nof the crowd and the source of all this disturbance.\n\n\"Go back,\" said Ortiz seriously. \"I shall die, Senor Bell. There is\nnothing else for me to do. But I wish to die with Latin melodrama.\" He\nmanaged a smile. \"I will give you ten minutes more. I can hold off the\npolice themselves for so long. But you must hasten, because there are\npolice launches.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe held out his hand. Bell took it.\n\n\"Good luck,\" said Ortiz.\n\n\"You can come--\" began Bell, wrenched by the gaiety on Ortiz's face.\n\n\"Absurd,\" said Ortiz, smiling. \"I should be murder mad within three\ndays. This is a preferable death, I assure you. Ten minutes, no more!\"\n\nAnd Bell went racing back and found Jamison rolling away the last of\nthe fuel drums and Paula looking anxiously for him.\n\n\"Tanks full,\" said Jamison curtly. \"Everything set. What next?\"\n\n\"Engines,\" said Bell.\n\nHe swung down and jerked a prop over. Again, and again.... The motor\ncaught. He went plunging to the other. Minutes.... They caught. He\nthrottled them down to the proper warming up roaring, while the air in\nthe enclosed space grew foul.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce more to the warehouse. Ortiz shouted and waved his hand. He was\nfilling his pockets with hand grenades. Bell made a gesture of\nfarewell and Ortiz seemed to smile as he went back to hold the\nentrance for a little longer.\n\n\"We're going,\" said Bell grimly. \"Get your guns ready, Jamison, for\nwhen the door goes up.\"\n\nHe pressed on the button Ortiz had pointed out. There were more\nexplosions and the rattle of firearms from the front of the warehouse.\nThere was a sudden rumble of machinery and the blank front of the\nlittle covered dock rose suddenly. The sunlit waters of Buenos Aires\nharbor spread out before them. To Bell, who had not looked on sunlight\nthat day, the effect was dazzling. He blinked, and then saw a fast\nlittle launch approaching. There were uniformed figures crowded about\nits bows.\n\n\"All set!\" he snapped. \"I'm going to give her the gun.\"\n\n\"Go to it,\" said Jamison. \"We're--\"\n\nThe motors bellowed and drowned out the rest. The plane shuddered and\nbegan to move. The sound of explosions from the back of the warehouse\nwas loud and continuous, now. Out into the bright sunlight the plane\nmoved, at first heavily, then swiftly....\n\nBell saw arms waving wildly in the launch with the uniformed men.\nSunlight glittered suddenly on rifle barrels. Puffs of vapor shot out.\nSomething spat through the wall beside Bell. But the roaring of the\nmotors kept up, and the pounding of the waves against the curved bow\nof the boat-body grew more and more violent.... Sweat came out on\nBell's face. The ship was not lifting....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut it did lift. Slowly, very slowly, carrying every pound with which\nit could have risen from the water. It swept past the police launch at\nninety miles an hour, but no more than five feet above the waves. A\nbig, clumsy tramp flying the Norwegian flag splashed up river with its\npropeller half out of water. Bell dared to rise a little so he could\nbank and dodge it. He could not rise above it.\n\nHe had one glimpse of blonde, astonished beards staring over the stern\nof the tramp as he swept by it, his wing tips level with its rail and\nbarely twenty feet away. And then he went on and on, out to sea.\n\nHe began to spiral for height fully four miles offshore, and looked\nback at the sprawling city. Down by the waterfront a thick, curling\nmass of smoke was rising from one spot abutting on the water. It\nswayed aside and Bell saw the rectangular opening out of which the\nplane had come.\n\n\"Ortiz's in there,\" he said, sick at heart. \"Dying as he planned.\"\n\nBut there was a sudden upheaval of timbers and roof. A colossal burst\nof smoke. A long time later the concussion of a vast explosion. There\nwas nothing left where the warehouse had been.\n\nBell looked, and swore softly to himself, and felt a fresh surge of\nthe hatred he bore to The Master and all his works. And then filmy\nclouds loomed up but a little above the rising plane, and Bell shot\ninto them and straightened out for the south.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor many long hours the plane floated on to southward, high above a\ngray ocean which seemed deceptively placid beneath a canopy of thin\nclouds. The motors roared steadily in the main, though once Bell\ninstructed Jamison briefly in the maintenance of a proper course and\nheight, and swung out into the terrific blast of air that swept past\nthe wings. He clung to struts and handholds and made his way out on\nthe catwalk to make some fine adjustment in one motor, with six\nthousand feet of empty space below the swaying wing.\n\n\"Carburetter wrong,\" he explained when he had closed the cabin window\nbehind him again and the motors' roar was once more dulled. \"It was\nlikely to make a lot of carbon in the cylinders. O.K., now.\"\n\nPaula's hand touched his shyly. He smiled abstractedly at her and went\nback to the controls.\n\nAnd then the plane kept on steadily. Time and space have become purely\nrelative in these days, in startling verification of Mr. Einstein, and\nthe distance between Buenos Aires and Magellan Strait is great or\nsmall, a perilous journey or a mere day's travel, according to the\nmind and the transportation facilities of the voyager. Before four\no'clock in the afternoon the coast was low and sandy to the westward,\nand it continued sterile and bare for long hours while the plane hung\nhigh against the sky with a following wind driving it on vastly more\nswiftly than its own engines could have contrived.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was little before sunset when the character of the shore changed\nyet again, and the sun was low behind a bank of angry clouds when the\nstubby forefinger of rock that Magellan optimistically named the Cape\nof the Eleven Thousand Virgins reached upward from the seemingly\nplacid water. Bell swept lower, then, much lower, looking for a\nlanding place. He found it eight or nine miles farther on, on a wide\nsandy beach some three miles from a lighthouse. The little plane\nsplashed down into tumbling sea and, half supported by the waves and\nhalf by the lift remaining to its wings, ran for yards up upon the\nhard packed sand.\n\nThe landing had been made at late twilight, and Bell moved stiffly\nwhen he rose from the pilot's seat.\n\n\"I'm going over to that lighthouse,\" he said curtly. \"There won't be\nenough men there to be dangerous and they probably haven't frequent\ncommunication with the town. I'll learn something, anyway. You two\nstay with the plane.\"\n\nJamison lifted his eyebrows and was about to speak, but looked at\nBell's expression and stopped. Leadership is everywhere a matter of\nemotion and brains together, and though Jamison had his share of\nbrains, he had not Bell's corroding, withering passion of hatred\nagainst The Master and all who served him gladly. All the way down the\ncoast Bell had been remembering things he had seen of The Master's\ndoing. His power was solely that of fear, and the deputies of his\nselection had necessarily been men who would spread that terror with\nan unholy zest. The nature of his hold upon his subjects was such that\nno honorable man would ever serve him willingly, and for deputies he\nhad need of men even of enthusiasm. His deputies, then, were men who\nfound in the assigned authority of The Master full scope for the\nsatisfaction of their own passions. And Bell had seen what those\npassions brought about, and there was a dull flame of hatred burning\nin his eyes that would never quite leave them until those men were\npowerless and The Master dead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You'll look after the ship and Paula,\" said Bell impatiently. \"All\nright?\"\n\nJamison nodded. Paula looked appealingly at Bell, but he had become a\nman with an obsession. Perhaps the death of Ortiz had cemented it, but\ncertainly he was unable to think of anything, now, but the necessity\nof smashing the ghastly hold of The Master upon all the folk he had\nentrapped. Subconsciously, perhaps, Bell saw in the triumph of The\nMaster a blow to all civilization. Less vaguely, he foresaw an attempt\nat the extension of The Master's rule to his own nation. But when Bell\nthought of The Master, mainly he remembered certain disconnected\nincidents. The girl at Ribiera's luxurious _fazenda_ outside of Rio,\nwho had been ordered to persuade him to be her lover, on penalty of a\nhorrible madness for her infant son if she failed. Of a pale and\nstricken _fazendiero_ on the Rio Lauren\u00e7o who thought him a deputy and\nhumbly implored the grace of The Master for a moody twelve year old\ngirl. Of a young man who kept his father, murder mad, in a barred room\nin his house and waited despairingly for that madness to be meted out\nupon himself and on his wife and children. Of a white man who had been\nkept in a cage in Cuyaba, with other men....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell trudged on through the deepening night with his soul a burning\nflame of hatred. He clambered amid boulders, guided by the tall\nlighthouse of Cape Possession with the little white dwelling he had\nseen at its base before nightfall. He fell, and rose, and forced his\nway on and upward, and at last was knocking heavily at a trim and\nneatly painted door.\n\nHe was so absorbed in his rage that his talk with the lighthouse\nkeeper seemed vague in his memory, afterward. The keeper was a wizened\nlittle Welshman from the Chibut who spoke English with an\nextraordinary mixture of a Spanish intonation and a Cimbrian accent.\nBell listened heavily and spoke more heavily still. At the end he went\nback to the plane with a spindle-shanked boy with a lantern\naccompanying him.\n\n\"All settled,\" he said grimly, when Jamison came out into the darkness\nwith a ready revolver to investigate the approaching light. \"We get a\nboat from the lighthouse keeper to go to Punta Arenas in. He's a\ndevout member of some peculiar sect, and he's seen enough of the hell\nPunta Arenas amounts to, to believe what I told him of its cause. His\nwife will look after Paula, and this boy will hitch a team to the\nplane and haul it out of sight early in the morning. With the help of\nGod, we'll kill Ribiera and The Master before sunset to-morrow.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nBut they did not kill The Master before nightfall. It was not quite\npracticable. Bell and Jamison started out well before dawn with a\nfavorable wind and tide, in the small launch the wizened Welshman\nplaced at their disposal. His air was one of dour piety, but he\naccepted Bell's offer of money with an obvious relief, and criticized\nhis Paraguayan currency with an acid frankness until Jamison produced\nArgentine pesos sufficient to pay for the boat three times over.\n\n\"I think,\" said Jamison dryly, \"that Pau--that Miss Canalejas is safe\nenough until we come back. The keeper is a godly man and knows we\nhave money. She'll be in no danger, except of her soul. They may try\nto save that.\"\n\nBell did not answer. He could think of nothing but the mission he had\nset himself. He tinkered with the engine to make it speed up, and set\nthe sails with infinite care to take every possible advantage of the\nstiff breeze that blew. During the day, those sails proved almost as\nmuch of a nuisance as a help. The fiendish, sullen williwaws that blow\nfuriously and without warning about the Strait required watching, and\nmore than once it was necessary to reef everything and depend on the\nmotor alone.\n\nBell watched the horizon ahead with smouldering eyes. Jamison watched\nhim almost worriedly.\n\n\"Look here, Bell,\" he said at last, \"you'll get nowhere feeling like\nyou do. I know you've done The Master more damage than I have, but\nyou'll just run your head into a trap unless you use your brains. For\ninstance, you didn't ask about communications. There's a direct\ntelegraph wire from Cape Virgins to Buenos Aires, and there's\ntelephonic communication between the Cape and Punta Arenas. Do you\nimagine that the plane wasn't seen when it came in the Cape? And do\nyou imagine The Master doesn't know we're here?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell turned, then, and frowned blackly.\n\n\"I hadn't thought of it,\" he said grimly, \"but I put some hand\ngrenades in the locker, there.\"\n\n\"You damned fool!\" said Jamison angrily. \"Stop being bloodthirsty and\nuse your head! You haven't even asked what I've done! I've done\nsomething, anyhow. That bundle I chucked in the bow has a couple of\nsheepmen's outfits in it. Lots of sheep raised around here. We'll put\n'em on before we land. And like a good general, I arranged a method of\nretreat before we left B. A. There'll be a naval vessel here in two or\nthree days. She's carrying a party of Government scientists. She'll\nanchor in Punta Arenas harbor and announce a case of some infectious\ndisease on board. No shore leave, you see, and nobody from shore\npermitted on board her. And she has one or two damned good analytical\nchemists with a damned good laboratory on board her, too. It's a long\ngamble, but if we can get hold of some of The Master's poison.... Do\nyou see?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bell heavily. \"I see. But you haven't been through what\nI've been through. What I've done, fighting that devil, has caused men\nto be deserted after being enslaved. There's one place, Cuyaba....\"\n\nHis face twitched. That place was in his dreams, now. That place and\nothers where human beings had watched their bodies go mad, and had\nbeen carried about screaming with horror at the crimes those bodies\ncommitted....\n\n\"I'm going to kill The Master,\" he rasped. \"That's all.\"\n\nHe settled down to his grim watch for the city. All during the cloudy,\novercast day he strained his eyes ahead. Jamison could make nothing of\nhim. In the end he had to leave Bell to his moody waiting.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe morning passed, and midday, and a long afternoon. Three times Bell\ncame restlessly back to the engine and tried to coax more speed out of\nit. But when darkness fell the town was still not in sight. They kept\non, then, steering by the stars with the motor putt-putt-putting\nsturdily away in the stern. The water splashed and washed all about\nthem. The little boat rose, and fell, and rose and fell again.\n\n\"That's the town,\" said Bell grimly.\n\nIt was eleven at night, or later. Lights began to appear, very far\naway, dancing miragelike on the edge of the water. They grew nearer\nwith almost infinite slowness. Two wide bands of many lights, with a\ndarker space in which a few much brighter lights showed clearly.\nPresently a single red light appeared, the Punta Arenas harbor light,\ntwenty-five feet up on an iron pole. They passed it.\n\n\"Bell,\" said Jamison curtly, \"it's time you showed some sense, now.\nWe're going to find out some things before we get reckless. This town\nisn't a big one, but it always was a hell on earth. No extradition\nfrom here. It's full of wanted men. It's dying, now, from the old days\nwhen all ships passed the Straits before the Panama Canal opened up,\nbut it ought to be still a hell on earth. And we're going to put on\nthese sheepmen outfits, and put up at some low caste sailors' and\nsheepmen's hotel on shore, and find out what is what. In the morning,\nif you like--\"\n\n\"In the morning,\" said Bell coldly, \"I'm going to settle with The\nMaster.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey found a small and filthy hotel, in a still filthier street where\nthe houses were alternately black and silent and empty, and filled\nwith the squalid hilarity most seaport towns can somehow manage to\nsupport. The street lamps were white and cold. The dirt and squalor\nshowed the more plainly by their light. There were sailors from the\nfew ships in harbor, and women so haggard and bedraggled that shrill\nlaughter and lavish endearments remained their only allure. And Bell\nand Jamison plodded to the reeking place in which a half-drunk\nsheepman pointed, and there Bell sat grimly in the vermin infested\nroom while Jamison, swearing wryly, went out.\n\nHe came back later, much later. His breath was strong of bad whiskey\nand he looked like a man who feels that a bath would be very\ndesirable. He looked like a man who feels unclean.\n\n\"Give me a cigarette,\" he said shortly. \"I found out most of what we\nwant to know.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell gave him a cigarette and waited.\n\n\"Good thing you stayed behind,\" said Jamison. \"I want to vomit. Why\npeople go in hell holes for fun.... But I was very drunk and very\namorous. Picked up a woman and fed her liquor. Young, too. Damnation!\nShe got crying drunk and told me everything she knew. I gave her money\nand left. Punta Arenas is The Master's, body and soul.\"\n\n\"One could have guessed it,\" said Bell grimly.\n\n\"Nothing like it is,\" said Jamison. \"Every living creature, man,\nwoman, and child, has been fed that devilish poison of his. The\nkeepers of the dives go fawning to the local officials for the\nantidote. The _jefe politico_ is driven in his carriage to be cured\nwhen red spots form before his eyes. The damned place is full of\nsuicides, and women, and--oh, my God! It's horrible!\"\n\nA humming, buzzing noise set up off in the night somewhere. It kept up\nfor a long time, throttled down. Suddenly it seemed to grow louder,\nchanged in pitch, and dwindled as if into the far, far distance.\n\n\"That's one of The Master's planes now, no doubt,\" said Jamison\nsavagely, \"going off on some errand for him. He uses this place\npractically as an experiment station. The human beings here are his\nguinea pigs. The deputies get a standardized form of the stuff, but\nhe's got it worked out in different doses so he can make a man go mad\nin hours, if he chooses, instead of after a delay. I don't know how.\nAnd The Master--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe checked himself sharply. There were shuffling footsteps in the hall\noutside. A timid tap on the door. Jamison opened it, while Bell\ndropped one hand inconspicuously to a weapon inside his shapeless\nclothing.\n\nThe toothless and filthy old man who kept the hotel beamed in at them.\n\n\"_Senores_,\" he cackled. \"_Vdes son de Porvenir, no es verdad?_\"\n\nJamison hiccoughed, as one who has been out and been drunken ought to\ndo.\n\n\"_No, viejo_,\" he rumbled tipsily, \"_somos de la estancia del Se\u00f1or\nRubio. Vaya._\"\n\nThe old man seemed to mourn that they did not come from the sheep\nranches about Porvenir Bay. But he produced a bottle with a shaking\nhand, still beaming.\n\n\"_Tengo muchos amigos en Porvenir_,\" he chirped amiably. \"_Y questa\nbotella--_\"\n\n\"_D\u00e9mela_,\" rumbled Jamison. He reached out his hand.\n\n\"_No mas que poquito!_\" said the old man, beaming but anxious as\nJamison tilted it to his lips. \"_Es visky de gentes...._\"\n\nHe beamed upon Bell, and Bell swallowed a spoonful and seemed to\nswallow vastly more. He lay back lazily while Jamison in the part of a\ntipsy sheepherder bullied the old man amiably and eventually chased\nhim out.\n\n\"You're amused?\" asked Jamison sardonically, when there were no more\nsounds outside. \"Because I said you didn't want to meet the young\nsenorita who loved you when she saw you downstairs? Well, Bell, if you\nused your brain you didn't swallow any of that stuff.\"\n\nBell started up. Jamison caught him by the shoulder.\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" he said sharply. \"Of course not. But it's damned funny\nfor a Spanish hotel keeper to give something for nothing, even when he\nseemed just to want to gossip about his friends. Here. Drink this\nwater. It looks vile enough to take the place of mustard....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNext morning the hotel keeper beamed upon them both as they went out\nof the place. A slatternly, dark haired girl who leaned on his\nshoulder smiled invitingly at Bell. And Bell, in his character of a\nloutish sheepman from one of the ranches that dot the shores of the\nStrait, grinned awkwardly back. But he went on with Jamison.\n\n\"We separate,\" said Jamison under his breath. \"We want to find where\nThe Master lives, mostly, and then we want to find the laboratory\nwhere his stuff is mixed. We don't want to do any killing until that's\nsettled. After all, the Trade has something to say!\"\n\nBell codded indifferently and began to wander idly about the streets,\nturning here and there as if moved by nothing more than the vaguest\ncuriosity. But gradually he was working through the sections in which\nthe larger buildings stood. Concrete structures, astonishingly modern,\ndotted the business section. But none of them had the air that would\nsurround a place where a man with power of life or death would be. In\na town the size of Punta Arenas there would be unmistakable evidences\nabout The Master's residence, even if it were only that those who\npassed it did so hurriedly and with a twinge of fear.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere were prosperous men in plenty on the streets, mingled with\ndeserting sailors, stockmen and farmers from the villages along the\nStrait, and even a few grimy men who looked like miners. But there is\na lignite mine not far from the city, and a narrow gauge railroad\nrunning to it. Of the prosperous-seeming men, however, Bell picked out\none here and there toward whom all passersby adopted a manner of\ncringing respect. Bell lounged against a pole and studied them\nthoughtfully. Men with an air of amused and careless scorn which only\nmen with unlimited power may adopt. He saw one grossly fat man with\nhard and cruel eyes. The uniformed policemen drove all traffic\nabjectly out of the way of his carriage, and stood with lifted hat\nuntil he had passed. The fat man gave no faintest sign of\nacknowledgment.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Bell slowly, and very grimly, \"if that's The Master?\"\n\nAnd then a passerby dodged quickly past his shoulder, brushing against\nhim, and waited humbly in the street. Bell turned. A party of men were\ntaking up nearly all the sidewalk. There were half a dozen of them in\nall. And nearly in the middle was the bulky, immaculate, pigmented\nRibiera.\n\nBell stiffened. But to move, beyond clearing the way, would be to\nattract attention. He backed clumsily off the curbing as if making\nway....\n\nAnd Ribiera looked at his face.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell's hand drifted near his hidden weapon. But Ribiera looked neither\nsurprised nor alarmed. He halted and chuckled.\n\n\"Ah, the Senhor Bell!\"\n\nBell said nothing, looking as stupid as possible, merely because there\nwas nothing else to do.\n\n\"Ah, do not deny my acquaintance!\" said Ribiera. He laughed. \"I advise\nyou to go and look at the view, over the harbor. Good day, Senhor\nBell.\"\n\nLaughing, he went off along the street. And Bell felt a cold horror\ncreeping over him as he realized what Ribiera might mean. Ribiera had\nentirely too much against him to greet him only, in a town where even\nthe dogs dared not bark without The Master's express command. He had\nguards with him, men who would have shot Bell down at a nod from\nRibiera.\n\nBell burst into a mad run for the waterfront. When the bay spread out\nbefore his eyes he saw what Ribiera meant, and something seemed to\nsnap in his brain.\n\nThe plane in which he and Jamison and Paula had escaped in was\nfloating out in the harbor. It was unmistakable. A larger, bulkier\nseaplane floated beside it. The buzzing in the air the night\nbefore.... The arrival of the plane had been telephoned from Cape\nVirgins. Through a glass, perhaps, even its alighting had been\nwatched. And a big seaplane had gone out to bring it back. Footprints\nin the sand would lead toward the lighthouse. There would be plenty of\nmen to storm that, if necessary, to take the three fugitives. But they\nwould have found only Paula. It was quite possible that the plane had\nonly been sent for after Bell and Jamison had been seen to land in\nPunta Arenas. And Paula in The Master's hands would explain Ribiera's\namusement perfectly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell found Jamison looking unhurriedly for him. And Jamison glanced at\nhis utterly white face and said softly:\n\n\"We want to get where we can't be seen, to talk. There's the devil to\npay.\"\n\n\"No use hiding,\" said Bell. His lips seemed stiff. \"Paula--\"\n\n\"Hide anyway,\" snapped Jamison. He fairly thrust Bell into an alleyway\nbetween two houses and thrust two rounded objects beneath his loose\nfitting coat. \"Two grenades. I have two more. The boat we came in is\ntaken--\"\n\n\"So is the plane,\" said Bell emotionlessly.\n\n\"And there is a sign, in English, posted where we tied it up. The sign\nsays, '_The Senores Bell and Jamison may recover their boat on\napplication to The Master, and may also receive news of a late\ntraveling companion from him._\"\n\n\"We're known,\" Bell told him--and amazingly found it possible to smile\nfaintly--\"Ribiera met me on the street and spoke to me and laughed and\nwent on.\"\n\nJamison stared. Bell's manner was almost entirely normal again. Then\nJamison shrugged.\n\n\"The sense of what you're saying,\" he observed wryly, \"is that we're\nlicked. Let us, then, go to see The Master. I confess I feel some\ncuriosity to know just what he's like.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell was smiling. Being in an entirely abnormal state, he had a\ncurious certitude of the proper course to adopt. He went up to a\npoliceman and said politely, in Spanish:\n\n\"I am desired to report to The Master, himself. Will you direct me?\"\n\nThe policeman abased himself instantly and trotted with them as a\nguide. And Bell walked naturally, now, with his head up and his\nshoulders back, and smoked leisurely as he went, and the policeman's\nabasement became abject. All who walked with that air of amused\nsuperiority in Punta Arenas were high in the service of The Master.\nObviously, the two men in these dejected clothes must also be high in\nthe service of The Master, and had adopted their disguise for purposes\ninto which a mere policeman and a slave of The Master should not dare\nenquire.\n\nJamison was rather grim and still. Jamison thought he was walking to\nhis death. But Bell smiled peculiarly and talked almost gaily and--as\nJamison thought--almost irrationally.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey came to a house set in a fairly spacious lawn behind a rather\nhigh wall. There were greenhouses behind it, and there were flowers\ngrowing as well as any flowers can be expected to grow in such high\naltitudes. It was an extraordinarily cheerful dwelling to be found in\nPunta Arenas, but the shuddering fear with which the little policeman\nremoved his hat as he entered the gateway was instructive.\n\nThey were confronted by four other policemen, on guard inside the\ngate.\n\n\"_Estos Se\u00f1ores_--\" began the abject one.\n\n\"Take us to The Master,\" commanded Bell in a species of amused and\nsuperior scorn.\n\n\"It is required, Senor,\" said the leader of the four on guard, very\nrespectfully, \"it is required that none enter without being searched\nfor weapons.\"\n\nBell laughed.\n\n\"Does The Master manage things so?\" he asked scornfully. \"Now, where I\nam deputy no man would dare to think of a weapon to be used against\nme! If it is The Master's rule, though....\"\n\nThe policeman cringed. Bell scornfully thrust an automatic out.\n\n\"Take it,\" he snapped. \"And go and tell The Master that the Senores\nBell and Jamison await his pleasure, and that they have given up\ntheir weapons.\"\n\nThe policeman scuttled toward the house. Bell smiled at his cigarette.\n\n\"Do you know, Bell,\" said Jamison dryly, in English, \"I'd hate to play\npoker with you.\"\n\n\"I'm not bluffing,\" said Bell. \"Not altogether. I've a four card\nflush, with the draw to come.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlmost instantly the policeman returned, more abject still. He had\nstammered out Bell's message, just as it was given him. And the slaves\nof The Master did not usually disobey orders, especially orders\ndesigned to prevent any danger of a doomed man or woman trying to\nassassinate The Master before madness was complete. Bell and Jamison\nwere received by liveried servants in utter silence and conducted\nthrough a long passageway, too long to have been contained entirely in\nthe house as seen from the front. Indeed, they came out into a great\nopen greenhouse, in which the smell of flowers was heavy. There were\nflowers everywhere, and a benign, small old man with a snowy beard and\nhair, sat at a desk as if chatting of amiable trivialities with the\nfrock-coated men who stood about him. The white haired old man lifted\na blossom delicately to his nostrils and inhaled its perfume with a\nsensitive delight. He looked up and smiled benignly upon the two.\n\nIt was then that Jamison got a shock surpassing all the rest. Bell's\nhands were writhing at the ends of his wrists, writhing as if they\nwere utterly beyond his control and as if they were longing to rend\nand tear....\n\nAnd Bell suddenly looked down at them, and his expression was that of\na man who sees cobras at the ends of his arms.\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nThere was a long pause. Bell was very calm. He seemed to tear his eyes\nfrom the writhing hands that were peculiarly sensate, as if under the\ncontrol of in intelligence alien to his own.\n\n\"I believe,\" said Bell steadily, \"that The Master wishes to speak to\nme.\"\n\nWith an apparent tremendous effort of will, he thrust his hands into\nhis pockets. Jamison cursed softly. Bell had taken the direction of\nthings entirely out of his hands. It only remained to play up.\n\n\"To be sure,\" said a mild, benevolent voice. The man with the snowy\nbeard regarded Bell exactly in the fashion of an elderly\nphilanthropist. \"I am The Master, Senor Bell. You have interested me\ngreatly. I have grown to have a great admiration for you. Will you be\nseated? Your companion also pleases me. I would like\"--and the mild\nbrown eyes beamed at him--\"I would like to have your friendship, Senor\nBell.\"\n\n\"Pull out a chair for me, Jamison,\" said Bell in a strained voice.\n\"And--I'd like to have a cigarette.\"\n\nJamison, cursing under his breath, put a chair behind Bell and stuck a\ncigarette between his lips. He held a match, though his hands shook.\n\n\"You might sit down, too,\" said Bell steadily. \"From the manner of The\nMaster, I imagine that the conversation will take some time.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe inhaled deeply of his cigarette, and faced the little man again.\nAnd The Master looked so benevolent that he seemed absolutely\ncherubic, and there was absolutely no sign of anything but the utmost\nsaintliness about him. His eyes were clear and mild. His complexion\nwas fresh and translucent. The wrinkles that showed upon his face were\nthose of an amiable and a serene soul filled with benevolence and\ncharity. He looked like one of those irritatingly optimistic old\ngentlemen who habitually carry small coins and stray bits of candy in\ntheir pockets for such small children as they may converse with under\nthe smiling eyes of nurses.\n\n\"Ah, Senor Bell,\" he said gently. \"You do cause me to admire you. May\nI see your hands again?\"\n\nBell held them out. He seemed to have conquered their writhing to some\nextent. But he could not hold them quite still. Sweat stood out on his\nforehead. He thrust them abruptly out of sight again.\n\n\"Sad,\" said The Master gently. \"Very sad.\" He sighed faintly and laid\ndown the rose he had been toying with. His fingers caressed the soft\npetals delicately. \"Fortunately,\" he said benevolently, \"it is not yet\ntoo late for me to relieve the strain under which you labor, Senor.\nMay I send for a certain medicine which will dispose of those symptoms\nin a very short time?\"\n\n\"We'll talk first,\" said Bell harshly. \"I want to hear what you have\nto say.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Master nodded, his fingers touching the rose petals as if in a\nsensitive pleasure in their texture.\n\n\"Always courageous,\" he said benignly. \"I admire it while I combat it.\nBut the Senor Jamison....\"\n\nJamison had been looking fascinatedly at his own hands, opening and\nclosing the fingers with a savage abruptness. They obeyed him, though\nthey trembled.\n\n\"I didn't drink the damned stuff that hotel keeper brought us last\nnight,\" he growled. \"Bell did. And I--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, Jamison,\" said Bell evenly. \"Let's talk to The Master\nfor a while. I swore, sir,\" he said grimly, \"that I'd kill you. I've\nseen what your devilish poison does, in the hands of the men you've\nchosen to distribute it. I've seen\"--he swallowed and said\nharshly--\"I've seen enough to make me desire nothing so much as to see\nyou roast in hell! But you wanted to talk to me. Go ahead!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Master beamed at him, and then glanced about at the frock-coated\nmen who had been attending him. Bell glanced at them. Ribiera was\nthere, chuckling.\n\n\"I told you, _tio mio_,\" he said familiarly, \"that he would not be\npolite. You can do nothing with him. Better have him shot.\"\n\nFrancia, of Paraguay, nodded amusedly to Bell as their eyes met. But\nThe Master shook his really rather beautiful head. An old man can be\ngood to look at, and with a saintly aureole of snow-white hair and the\npatriarchal white beard, The Master was the picture of benign and\nbeautiful old age.\n\n\"Ah, you do not understand,\" he protested mildly. \"The more the Senor\nBell shows his courage, _hijo mio_, the more we must persuade him.\" He\nturned to Bell. \"I realise,\" he said gently, \"that there are hardships\nconnected with the administration of my power, Senor. It is\ninevitable. But the Latin races of the continent which is now nearly\nmine require strong handling. They require a strong man to lead them.\nThey are comfortable only under despotism. The task I have chosen for\nyou is different, entirely. _Los Americanos del Norte_ will not\nrespond to the treatment which is necessary for those _del Sud_. Their\ngovernments, their traditions, are entirely unlike. If you become my\ndeputy and viceroy for all your nation, you shall rule as you will. A\nbenevolent, yet strong, rule is needed for your people. It may even\nbe--I will permit it--that the democratic institutions of your nation\nmay continue if you so desire. I am offering you, Senor, the position\nof the absolute ruler of your nation. You may interfere with the\npresent government not at all, if you choose, provided only that my\nown commands are obeyed when relayed through you. I choose you because\nyou have courage, and resource, and because you have the _Yanqui_\ncleverness which will understand your nation and cope with it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell inhaled deeply.\n\n\"In other words,\" he said bitterly, \"you're saying indirectly that you\noffer me a chance to be the sort of ruler Americans will submit to\nwithout too much fuss, because you think one of Ribiera's stamp would\ndrive them to rebellion.\"\n\nThe fine dark eyes twinkled.\n\n\"You have much virtue, Senor. My nephew--though he is to be my\nsuccessor--has a weakness for a pretty face. Would you prefer that I\ngive him the task of subduing your nation?\"\n\n\"You might try it,\" said Bell. His eyes gleamed. \"He'd be dead within\na week.\"\n\nThe Master laughed softly.\n\n\"I like you, Senor. I do like you indeed. I have not been so defied\nsince another _Americano del Norte_ defied me in this same room. But\nhe had not your resource. He had been enslaved with much less\ndifficulty than yourself. I do not remember what happened to him....\"\n\n\"He was taken, Master,\" said a fat man with hard eyes, obsequiously,\n\"he was taken in Bolivia.\" It was the man whom Bell had seen earlier\nthat morning in a carriage. \"You gave him to me. He had insulted me\nwhen I ordered him sent to you. I had him killed, but he was very\nobstinate.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said The Master meditatively. \"You told me the details.\" He\nseemed to recall small facts in benevolent retrospection. \"But you,\nSenor Bell, I have need of you. In fact, I shall insist upon your\nfriendship. And therefore--\"\n\nHe beamed upon Bell.\n\n\"I give you back the Senorita Canalejas.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe shook his head reproachfully at the utterly grim look in Bell's\neyes.\n\n\"I shall give you one single portion of the antidote to the medicine\nwhich makes your hands behave so badly. You may take it when you\nplease. The Senor Jamison I shall keep and enslave. I do not think he\nwill be as obstinate as you are, but he has excellent qualities. If\nyou prove obdurate, I may yet persuade him to undertake certain tasks\nfor me. But you and the Senorita Canalejas are free. Your boat has\nbeen reprovisioned and provided with fuel. You may go from here where\nyou will.\"\n\nRibiera snarled.\n\n\"_Tio mio_,\" he protested angrily, \"you promised me--\"\n\n\"Your will in many things,\" said The Master gently, \"but not in all.\nRemember that you have much to learn, _hijo mio_. I have taught you to\nprepare my little medicine, it is true. That is so you can take my\nplace if age infirmity shall carry me away.\" The Master folded his\nhands with an air of pious resignation. \"But you must learn policy.\nThe Senorita Canalejas belongs to the Senor Bell.\"\n\nJamison was staring, now, but Bell's eyes had narrowed to mere slits.\n\n\"You see,\" said The Master gently, to him, \"I desire your friendship.\nYou may go where you will. You may take the Senorita Canalejas with\nyou. You will have enough of the antidote to my little medicine to\nkeep you sane for perhaps a week. In one week you may go far, with\nher. You may do many things. But you cannot find a place of safety for\nher. I still have a little power, Senor. If you take her with you,\nyour hands will writhe again. Your body will become uncontrollable.\nYour eyes, staring and horror-struck, will observe your own hands\nrending her. While your brain is yet sane you will see this body of\nyours which now desires her so ardently, tearing at and crushing that\ndelicate figure, gouging out her eyes, battering her tender flesh,\ndestroying her.... Have you ever seen what a man who has taken my\nlittle medicine does to a human being at his mercy?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe figures about The Master were peculiarly tense. The fat man with\nthe hard eyes laughed suddenly. It was a horrible laugh. Francia of\nParaguay took out his handkerchief and delicately wiped his lips. He\nwas smiling. Ribiera looked at Bell's face and chuckled. His whole\ngross figure shook with his amusement.\n\n\"And of course,\" said The Master benignly, \"if you prefer to commit\nsuicide, if you prefer to leave her here--well, my nephew knows little\nexpedients to reduce her will to compliance. You recall _Yagu\u00e9_, among\nothers.\"\n\nBell's face was a white mask of horror and fury. He tried to speak,\nand failed. He raised his hand to his throat--and it tore at the\nflesh, insanely.\n\n\"Let--let me see her,\" croaked Bell, as if strangling.\n\nJamison stiffened. Bell seemed to be trying to get his hands into his\npockets. They were apparently uncontrollable. He thrust them under his\ncoat as there was a stirring at the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Paula was brought in, as if she had been waiting. She was entirely\ncolorless, but she smiled at Bell. She came quickly to his side.\n\n\"I heard,\" she said in a clear and even little voice. \"We will go\ntogether, Charles. If there is a week in which we can be together, it\nwill be so much of happiness. And when you are--The Master's victim,\nwe will let the little boat sink, and sink with it. I do not wish to\nlive without you, Charles, and you do not wish to live as his slave.\"\n\nBell gave utterance to a sudden laugh that was like a bark. His hands\ncame out from under his coat. Dangling from each one was a small,\npear-shaped globule of metal. A staff projected upward from each one,\nand he held those staffs in his writhing hands. About each wrist was a\ntiny loop of cord that went down to a pin at the base of the staffs.\n\n\"Close to me, Paula,\" he said coldly. She clung to his arm. He moved\nforward, with half-a-dozen revolver muzzles pointed at his breast.\n\n\"If one of you damned fools fires,\" he said harshly, \"I'll let go.\nWhen I let go--these are Mills grenades, and they go off in three\nseconds after they leave the hand. Stand still!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a terrible, frozen silence. Then a movement from behind\nBell. Jamison was rising with a grunt.\n\n\"Some day, Bell,\" he observed coolly, \"I'll be on to all of your\ncurves. This is the best one yet. But you're likely to let go at any\nsecond, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Like hell!\" raged Bell. \"I drank some of your poison,\" he snarled at\nThe Master. \"Yes! I was fool enough to do it! But I took what measures\nany man will take who finds he's swallowed poison. I got it out of my\nstomach at once. And if you or one of these deputies tries to\nmove....\"\n\nRibiera had blanched to a pasty gray. The Master was frozen. But Bell\nsaw Ribiera's eyes move in swift calculation. There was a solid wall\nbehind The Master. It seemed as if the greenhouse were a sort of\npassageway between two larger structures. And there was a door almost\nimmediately behind Ribiera. Ribiera glanced right--left--\n\nHe flung himself through that door. He knew the secret of The Master's\npower. He was The Master's appointed successor. If The Master and all\nhis deputies died, Ribiera....\n\nBut Bell snapped into action like a bent spring released. His arm shot\nforward. A grenade went hurtling through the door through which\nRibiera had fled. There was an instantaneous, terrific explosion. The\nsolid wall shook and shivered and, with a vast deliberation,\ncollapsed. The greenhouse was full of crushed plaster dust. Panes of\nglass shivered....\n\nBut Bell was upon The Master. He had struck the little man down and\nstood over him, his remaining automatic replacing the grenade he had\nthrown.\n\n\"Ribiera's dead,\" he snapped, \"and if I'm shot The Master dies too and\nyou all go mad! Stand back!\"\n\nThe deputies stood frozen.\n\n\"I think,\" said Jamison composedly, \"I take a hand now. I'll pick him\nup, Bell.... Right. I've got him. With a grenade hanging down his\nback. If he jerks away from me, or I from him, it will blow his spine\nto bits.\"\n\n\"Hold him so,\" said Bell coldly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe went coolly to where he could look over the heap of the collapsed\nwall. He saw a bundle of torn clothing that had been a man. It was\nflung against a cracked and tottering chimney.\n\n\"Right,\" he said evenly. \"Ribiera's dead, all right.\"\n\nHe turned to the deputies, whose revolvers were still in their hands.\n\n\"The Master's carriage, please,\" he said politely. \"To the door. You\nmay accompany us if you please, but in other carriages. I am working\nfor the release of all the Master's slaves, and you among them if you\nchoose. But you can see very easily that there is no hope of the\nrelease of The Master without the meeting of my terms.\"\n\nThe Master spoke, softly and mildly and without fear.\n\n\"It is my order that the Senor Bell is to be obeyed. I shall return.\nYou need have no fear of my death. My carriage.\"\n\nA man went stiffly, half-paralyzed with terror, to where chattering\nscared servants were grouped in the awful fear that came upon the\nslaves of The Master at any threat to his rule.\n\nBut Bell and Paula and Jamison went slowly and cautiously--though they\nheld the whip hand--to the entrance door of the house, and out to the\nentrance gate. A carriage was already before the door when they\nreached it, and others were drawing up in a line behind it.\n\n\"Get in,\" said Bell briefly. \"Down to the waterfront.\"\n\nHe turned to the group of frock-coated, stricken men who had followed.\n\n\"Some of you men,\" he said coldly, \"had better go on ahead and warn\nthe police and the public generally about the certainty of The\nMaster's death if any attempt is made to rescue him.\"\n\nFrancia, of Paraguay, summoned a swagger and raised his hand to the\nsecond carriage. It drew in to the curb.\n\n\"I will attend to it, Senor Bell,\" he said politely. \"Ah, when I think\nthat I once raised my revolver to shoot you and refrained!\"\n\nHe drove off swiftly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell's eyes were glowing. He got into the carriage, and such a\nprocession drove through the streets of Punta Arenas as has rarely\nmoved through the streets of any city in the world. The long line of\ncarriages moved at a funereal pace amid a surging, terrified mob. The\nMaster beamed placidly as he looked out over white, starkly agonized\nfaces. Some of the people groaned audibly. A few cursed The Master in\ntheir despair. More cursed Bell, not daring to strike or fire on him.\nBut he would have been torn to bits if he had stepped from the\ncarriage for an instant.\n\n\"Bell,\" said Jamison dryly, \"considering that I'm prepared to be blown\napart on three seconds notice, it is peculiar that this mob frightens\nme.\"\n\nThe Master's eyes twinkled benignly. He seemed totally insensible to\nfear.\n\n\"You need not be afraid,\" he said gently. \"They will not touch you\nunless I order them.\"\n\nJamison stared down at the little man whose collar he held firmly,\nwith a Mills grenade dangling down at the base of his neck.\n\n\"I wouldn't order them to attack, if I were you,\" he said coldly. \"I\nhaven't Bell's brains, but I have just as much dislike for you as he\nhas.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey came to the harbor. Bell spoke again.\n\n\"The carriage is to drive out to the end of one of the docks, and no\none else is to go out on that dock.\"\n\nThe Master relayed the order in his mild voice, but as the coachman\nobeyed him he clucked his tongue commiseratingly.\n\n\"Senor Bell,\" he protested gently. \"You do not expect to escape! Not\nafter killing me! Why that is absurd!\"\n\nBell said nothing. He alighted from the carriage, his face set grimly,\nand stared ashore at the long, long row of terrified faces staring out\nat him. The whole waterfront seemed to be lined with staring faces.\nWails came from that mass of enslaved human beings.\n\n\"Hold him here, Jamison,\" he said drearily. \"I'm going out to look at\nthat big plane. There's a rowboat tied to the dock, here.\"\n\nHe swung down the side into the dock and rowed off into the harbor,\nwhile the horses attached to The Master's carriage pawed impatiently\nat the wooden flooring of the dock. Bell reached the two planes\nanchored on the still harbor water. The smaller one had brought them\ndown from Buenos Aires. The larger one had gone after the beached\namphibian and brought it and Paula on to the city. Bell, from the\nshore, was seen to be investigating the larger one. He came rowing\nback.\n\nHis head appeared above the dock edge.\n\n\"All right,\" he said tiredly. \"The Master has a rule requiring all his\nships ready for instant flight. Very useful. The big plane is fueled\nand full of oil. We'll go out to it and take off.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJamison lifted The Master to his feet and with a surge of muscles\nswept him down to the flooring of the dock.\n\n\"Paula first,\" said Bell, \"and then The Master, and then you,\nJamison.\"\n\n\"One moment,\" said The Master reproachfully. \"It would be cruel not to\nlet me reassure my subjects. I will give an order.\"\n\nBell and Jamison listened suspiciously. But he spoke gently to the\ncoachman.\n\n\"You will tell the deputies,\" said The Master in Spanish, \"that a\nmonth's supply of medicine for all my subjects will be found in my\nlaboratory. And you may tell them that I shall return before the end\nof that time.\"\n\nThe coachman's eyes filled with a passionate relief.\n\n\"Now,\" said The Master placidly, \"I am ready for our little jaunt.\"\n\nPaula descended the ladder and seated herself in the bow of the boat.\nBell covered The Master grimly with his automatic as he descended,\nwith surprising agility. Jamison came down last, and resumed his\nformer grip on The Master's collar. Bell rowed out to the big plane.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJamison kept close watch while Bell started the four huge motors and\nthrottled them down to warming up speed, and while he hauled up the\nanchor with which the huge seaplane was anchored.\n\nThe dock was covered with a swarm of panic stricken folk. Everywhere,\nall the inhabitants of the city who were slaves to The Master had come\nin awful terror to watch. And all the inhabitants of the city were\nslaves to The Master. Some of them fell to their knees and held out\nimploring arms to Bell, begging him for mercy and the return of The\nMaster. Some cursed wildly.\n\nBut, with his jaws set grimly, Bell gave the motors the gun.\n\nThe big plane moved heavily, then more swiftly through the water. It\nlifted slowly, and rose, and rose, and dwindled to a speck high in the\nair.\n\nAnd all through the streets and ways of Punta Arenas, fear stalked\nalmost as a tangible thing. Panic hovered over the housetops, always\nready to descend. Terror was in the air that every man breathed, and\nevery human being looked at every other human being with staring,\nhaunted eyes. Punta Arenas was waiting for its murder madness to\nbegin.\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nThere were four motors to pull the big plane through the air, and\ntheir roaring was a vast thundering noise which the earth re-echoed.\nBut inside the cabin that tumult was reduced to a not intolerable\nhumming sound.\n\n\"What'll I do with this devil, Bell?\" asked Jamison. \"Now that we're\naloft, I confess this grenade makes me nervous. I'm holding it so\ntightly my fingers are getting cramped.\"\n\n\"Tie him up,\" said Bell, without looking. \"He'll talk presently.\"\n\nMovements. The plane flew on, swaying slightly in the way of big\nsea-planes everywhere. A williwaw began in the hills ahead and swept\nout and set the ship to reeling crazily in its erratic currents. The\nStrait vanished and there were tumbled hills below them. Minutes\npassed.\n\n\"Got him fixed up,\" said Jamison coolly, \"I'll guarantee he won't\nbreak loose. Got any plans, Bell?\"\n\n\"No time,\" said Bell. \"I haven't had time to make any. The first thing\nis to get where his folk will never find us. Then we'll see what we\ncan do with him.\"\n\nPaula looked at the now bound figure of The Master. And the little old\nman beamed at her.\n\n\"He--he's smiling!\" said Paula, in a voice that was full of a peculiar\nhorrified shock.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell shrugged. Punta Arenas was all of twenty-five miles behind, and\nthe earth over which they flew began to take on the shape of an\nisland. Water appeared beyond it, and innumerable small islands. Bell\nbegan to rack his brain for the infinitesimal scraps of knowledge he\nhad about this section of the world. It was pitifully scanty. Punta\nArenas was the southernmost point of the continental mass. All about\nit was an archipelago and a maze of waterways, thinly inhabited\neverywhere and largely without any inhabitants at all. The only solid\nground between Cape Horn and the Antarctic ice pack was Diego Ramirez\nand the South Shetlands....\n\nNothing to go on. But any sufficiently isolated and desolate spot\nwould do. Almost anywhere along the southern edge of the continental\nislands should serve.\n\nThe plane roared on monotonously, while Bell began to wrestle with\nanother and more serious problem. In three days--two, now--an American\nnaval vessel would turn up, with scientists and chemists on board. It\nwas to be doubted whether anything like an overt act would be risked\nby that vessel. If all the governments of South America were under The\nMaster's thumb, then cabled orders from his deputies would race three\nnavies to the spot. And the government of the United States does not\nlike to start war, anywhere. Certainly it would not willingly enter\ninto a conflict with the whole southern continent for the solution of\na problem that so far affected that continent alone. The Master's\nkidnapping had solved nothing, so far.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJamison tapped his shoulder.\n\n\"No pursuit, so far,\" he observed coolly. \"I've looked.\" Bell nodded.\n\n\"They don't dare. Not yet, anyhow. They're depending on The Master.\nHow is he?\"\n\n\"Smiling peacefully to himself, damn him!\" snarled Jamison. \"Do you\nknow what we're up against?\"\n\n\"Ourselves,\" said Bell coldly. \"But I'm nearly licked. He's got to\ntalk!\"\n\nJamison moved away again. The earth below looked as if it had been\ntorn to shreds in some titanic convulsion of ages past. The sea was\neverywhere, and so was land! There were little threads of silver\ninterlacing and crossing and wavering erratically in every conceivable\ndirection. And there were specks of islands--rocks only yards in\nextent--and islands of every imaginable size and shape, with their\nsurfaces in every possible state of upheaval and distortion. A broader\nmass of land appeared ahead and to the left.\n\n\"Tierra del Fuego again,\" muttered Bell. \"If we cross it....\"\n\nFor fifteen minutes the plane thundered across desolate, rocky hills.\nThen the maze of islets again. Bell scanned them keenly, and saw a\ntiny steamer traveling smokily, for no conceivable reason, among the\nscattered bits of stone. The sea appeared, stretching out toward\ninfinity.\n\nBell rose, to survey a wider space. He swung to the left, so that he\nwas heading nearly southeast, and went on down toward that desolation\nof desolations, the stormy cape which faces the eternal ice of the\nantarctic. He was five thousand feet up, then, and scanning sea and\nearth and sky....\n\nAnd suddenly he swung sharply to the right and headed out toward the\nopen sea. He felt a small figure pressing against his shoulder.\nPresently fingers closed tightly upon his sleeve. He glanced down at\nPaula and managed to smile.\n\n\"There are some rocks out there,\" he told her quietly. \"Islands, I\nthink, and Diego Ramirez, at a guess.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were specks, no more, but they were vastly more distinct from the\nplane than from Mount Beaufoy. That is on Henderson Island in New Year\nSound, and its seventeen-hundred-foot peak was almost below Bell when\nhe sighted the islands. But the islands have been seen full fifty\nmiles from there.\n\nIt took the plane nearly forty minutes to cover the space, but long\nbefore that the islands had become distinct. Two tiny groups of\nscattered rocks, the whole group hardly five miles in length and by\nfar the greater number no more than boulders surrounded by sheets of\nfoam from breakers. Two of them merited the name of islands. The\nnearer was high and bare and precipitous. No trace of vegetation\nshowed upon it. The farther was smaller, and at its northern corner a\nlittle cove showed, nearly land-locked.\n\nBell descended steeply. The big plane plunged wildly in the air eddies\nabout the taller island at five hundred feet, but steadied and went\nwinging on down lower, and lower.... The waves between the two\nislands were not high, but the seaplane alighted with a mighty, a\ntremendous splashing, and Bell navigated it grimly though clumsily\ninto the mouth of the cove. There a small beach showed. He went very\nslowly toward it. Presently he swung abruptly about. A wing tip float\ngrounded close to the shore.\n\nThe motors cut off and left a thunderous silence. Bell climbed atop\nthe cabin and let go the anchor.\n\n\"We're here,\" he said shortly. \"Bring The Master and we'll go ashore.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe catwalk painted on the lower wing guided them. Bell jumped to the\nrocks first, and stumbled, and then rose to lift Paula down and take\nThe Master's small, frail body from Jamison's arms.\n\n\"You looked for a gun?\" asked Bell\n\n\"He'd nothing to fight with,\" said Jamison heavily. He had been facing\nthe same problem Bell had worked on desperately, and had found no\nanswer. But he shuddered a little as he looked about the island.\n\nThere was nothing in sight but rock. No moss. No lichens. Not even\nstringy grass or the tufty scrub bushes that seemed able to grow\nanywhere.\n\nBell untied The Master, carefully but without solicitude. The little\nman sat up, and brushed himself off carefully, and arranged himself in\na comfortable position.\n\n\"I am an old man,\" said The Master in mild reproach. \"You might at\nleast have given me a cushion to sit upon.\"\n\nBell sat down and lighted a cigarette with fingers that did not\ntremble in the least.\n\n\"Suppose,\" he said hardly, \"you talk. First, of what your poison is\nmade. Second, of what the antidote is made. Third, how we may be sure\nyou tell the truth.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Master looked at him with bright, shrewd, and apparently kindly\nold eyes.\n\n\"_Hijo mio_,\" he said mildly, \"I am an old man. But I am obstinate. I\nwill tell you nothing.\"\n\nBell's eyes glowed coldly.\n\n\"Does it occur to you,\" he asked grimly, \"that it's too important a\nmatter for us to have any scruples about? That we can--and will--make\nyou talk?\"\n\n\"You may kill me,\" said The Master benignly, \"but that is all.\"\n\n\"And,\" said Bell, still more grimly, \"we have only to get back in the\nplane yonder, and go away....\"\n\nThe Master beamed at him. Presently he began to laugh softly.\n\n\"_Hijo mio_,\" he said gently, \"let us stop this little byplay. You\nwill take me back in my airplane, and you will land me at Punta\nArenas. And then you will fly away. I concede you freedom, but that is\nall. You cannot leave me here.\"\n\n\"Paula,\" said Bell coldly, \"get in the plane again. Jamison--\"\n\nPaula rose doubtfully. Jamison stood up. The Master continued to\nchuckle amiably.\n\n\"You see,\" he said cherubically, \"you happen to be a gentleman, Senor\nBell. Every man has some weakness. That is yours. And you will not\nleave me here to die, because you have killed my nephew, who was the\nonly other man who knew how to prepare my little medicine. And you\nknow, Senor, that all my subjects will wish to die. Those who do, in\nfact,\" he added mildly, \"will be fortunate. The effect of my little\nmedicine does not make for happiness without its antidote.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBell's hands clenched.\n\n\"You know,\" said The Master comfortably, \"that there are many\nthousands of people whose hands will writhe, very soon. The city of\nPunta Arenas will be turned into a snarling place of maniacs within a\nvery little while--if I do not return. Would you like, Senor, to think\nin after days of that pleasant city filled with men and women tearing\neach other like beasts? Of little children, even, crouching, and\ncrushing and rending the tender flesh of other little children? Of\nlisping little ones gone--\"\n\n\"Stop!\" snarled Bell, in a frenzy. \"Damn your soul! You're right! I\ncan't! You win--so far!\"\n\n\"Always,\" said The Master benevolently. \"I win always. And you forget,\nSenor. You have seen the worst side of my rule. The revolutions, the\nrebellions that have made men free, were they pretty things to watch?\nAlways, _amigo_, the worst comes. But when my rule is secure, then you\nshall see.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe waved a soft, beautifully formed hand. From every possible aspect\nthe situation was a contradiction of all reason. The bare, black, salt\nencrusted rocks with no trace of vegetation showing. The gray water\nrumbling and surging among the uneven rocks at the base of the shore,\nwhile gulls screamed hoarsely overhead. The white haired little man\nwith his benevolent face, smiling confidently at the two grim men.\n\n\"The time will come,\" said The Master gently, and in the tone of utter\nconfidence with which one states an inescapable fact, \"the time will\ncome when all the earth will know my rule. The taking of my little\nmedicine will be as commonplace a thing as the smoking of tobacco,\nwhich I abhor, Senores. You are mistaken about there being an antidote\nand a poison. It is one medicine only. One little compound. A\nvegetable substance, Senor Bell, combined with a product of modern\nchemistry. It is a synthetic drug. Modern chemistry is a magnificent\nscience, and my little medicine is its triumph. Even my deputies have\nnot heard me speak so, Senores.\"\n\nBell snarled wordlessly, but if one had noticed his eyes they would\nhave been seen to be curiously cool and alert and waiting. The Master\nleaned forward, and for once spoke seriously, almost reverently.\n\n\"There shall be a forward step, Senores, in the race of men. Do you\nknow the difference between the brain of a man and that of an\nanthropoid ape? It consists only of a filmy layer of cortex, a film of\ngray nerve cells which the ape has not. And that little layer creates\nthe difference between ape and man. And I have discovered more. My\nlittle medicine acts upon that film. Administered in the tiny\nquantities I have given to my slaves, it has no perceptible effect. It\nis merely a compound of a vegetable substance and a synthetic organic\nbase. It is not excreted from the body. Like lead, it remains always\nin solution in the blood. But in or out of the blood it changes,\nalways, to the substance which causes murder madness. Fresh or\nchanged, my little medicine acts upon the brain.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe smiled brightly upon them.\n\n\"But though in tiny quantities it has but little effect, in larger\nquantities--when fresh it makes the functioning of the gray cells of\nthe human brain as far superior to the unmedicated gray cells, as\nthose human gray cells are to the white cells of the ape! That is what\nI have to offer to the human race! Intelligence for every man, which\nshall be as the genius of the past!\"\n\nHe laughed softly.\n\n\"Think, Senores! Compare the estate of men with the estate of apes!\nCompare the civilization which will arise upon the earth when men's\nbrains are as far above their present level as the present level is\nabove the anthropoid! The upward steps of the human race under my rule\nwill parallel, will surpass the advance from the brutish caveman to\nintellectual genius. But I have seen, Senores, the one danger in my\noffering.\"\n\nThere was silence. Jamison shook his head despairingly. The Master\ncould not see him. He formed the word with his lips.\n\n\"Crazy!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Bell said coldly:\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"I must rule,\" said The Master soberly. \"It is essential. If my little\nsecret were known, intelligences would be magnified, but under many\nflags and with many aims. Scientists, with genius beside which\nNewton's pales, would seek out deadly weapons for war. The world would\ndestroy itself of its own genius. But under my rule--\"\n\n\"Men go mad,\" said Bell coldly.\n\nThe Master smiled reproachfully.\n\n\"Ah, you are trying to make me angry, so that I will betray something!\nYou are clever, Senor Bell. With my little medicine, in such\nquantities as I would administer it to you....\"\n\n\"You describe it,\" said Bell harshly and dogmatically, \"as a brain\nstimulant. But it drives men mad.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" said The Master mildly. \"It does. It is not excreted\nfrom the body save very, very slowly. But it changes in the blood\nstream. As--let us say--sugar changes into alcohol in digestion. The\nend-product of my little medicine is a poison which attacks the brain.\nBut the slightest bit of unchanged medicine is an antidote. It is\"--he\nsmiled amiably--\"it is as if sugar in the body changed to alcohol, and\nalcohol was a poison, but sugar--unchanged--was an antidote. That is\nit exactly. You see that I have taken my little medicine for years,\nand it has not harmed me.\"\n\n\"Which,\" said Bell--and somehow his manner made utter silence fall so\nthat each word fell separately into a vast stillness--\"which, thank\nGod, is the one thing that wins finally, for me!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stood up and laughed. Quite a genuine laugh.\n\n\"Paula,\" he said comfortably, \"get on the plane. In the cabin. Jamison\nand I are going to strip The Master.\"\n\nPaula stared. The Master looked at him blankly. Jamison frowned\nbewilderedly, but stood up grimly to obey.\n\n\"But Senor,\" said The Master in gentle dignity, \"merely to humiliate\nme--\"\n\n\"Not for that,\" said Bell. He laughed again. \"But all the time I've\nbeen hearing about the stuff, I've noticed that nobody thought of it\nas a drug. It was a poison. People were poisoned. They did not become\naddicts. But you--you are the only addict to your drug.\"\n\nHe turned to Jamison, his eyes gleaming.\n\n\"Jamison,\" he said softly, \"did you ever know of a drug addict who\ncould bear to think of ever being without a supply of his drug--_right\non his person_?\"\n\nJamison literally jumped.\n\n\"By God! No!\"\n\nThe Master was quick. He was swarming up the plane-wing tip before\nJamison reached him, and he kicked frenziedly when Jamison plucked him\noff. But then it was wholly, entirely, utterly horrible that the\nlittle white haired man, whose face and manner had seemed so cherubic\nand so bland, should shriek in so complete a blind panic as they\nforced his fingers open and took a fountain pen away from him.\n\n\"This is it,\" said Bell in a deep satisfaction. \"This is his point of\nweakness.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Master was ghastly to look at, now. Jamison held him gently\nenough, considering everything, but The Master looked at that fountain\npen as one might look at Paradise.\n\n\"I--I swear,\" he gasped. \"I--swear I will give you the formula!\"\n\n\"You might lie,\" said Jamison grimly.\n\n\"I swear it!\" panted The Master in agony. \"It--If the formula is known\nit--can be duplicated! It--the excretion can be hastened! It can all\nbe forced from the body! Simply! So simply! If only you know! I will\ntell you how it is done! The medicine is the cacodylate of--\"\n\nBell was leaning forward, now, like a runner breasting the tape at the\nend of a long and exhausting race.\n\n\"I'll trade,\" he said softly. \"Half the contents of the pen for the\nformula. The other half we'll need for analysis. Half the stuff in the\npen for the formula for freeing your slaves!\"\n\nThe Master sobbed.\n\n\"A--a pencil!\" he gasped. \"I swear--\"\n\nJamison gave him a pencil and a notebook. He wrote, his hands shaking.\nJamison read inscrutably.\n\n\"It doesn't mean anything to me,\" he said soberly, \"but you can read\nit. It's legible.\"\n\nBell smiled faintly. With steady finger he took his own fountain pen\nfrom his pocket. He emptied it of ink, and put a scrupulous half of a\nmilky liquid from The Master's pen into it. He passed it over.\n\n\"Your medicine,\" said Bell quietly, \"may taste somewhat of ink, but it\nwill not be poisonous. Now, what do we do with you? I give you your\nchoice. If we take you with us, you will be held very secretly as a\nprisoner until the truth of the information you have given us can be\nproven. And if your slaves have all been freed, then I suppose you\nwill be tried....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Master was drawn and haggard. He looked very, very old and beaten.\n\n\"I--I would prefer,\" he said dully, \"that you did not tell where I am,\nand that you go away and leave me here. I--I may have some subjects\nwho will search for me, and--they may discover me here.... But I am\nbeaten, Senor. You know that you have won.\"\n\nBell swung up on the wing of the plane. He explored about in the\ncabin. He came back.\n\n\"There are emergency supplies,\" he said coldly. \"We will leave them\nwith you, with such things as may be useful to allow you to hope as\nlong as possible. I do not think you will ever be found here.\"\n\n\"I--prefer it, Senor,\" said The Master dully. \"I--I will catch\nfish....\"\n\nJamison helped put the packages ashore. The Master shivered. Bell\nstripped off his coat and put it on top of the heap of packages. The\nMaster did not stir. Bell laid a revolver on top of his coat. He went\nout to the plane and started the motors. The Master watched\napathetically as the big seaplane pulled clumsily out of the little\ncove. The rumble of the engines became a mighty roar. It started\nforward with a rush, skimmed the water for two hundred yards or so,\nand suddenly lifted clear to go floating away through the air toward\nthe north.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPaula was the only one who looked back.\n\n\"He's crying,\" she said uncomfortably.\n\n\"It isn't fear,\" said Bell quietly. \"It's grief at the loss of his\nambition. It may not seem so to you two, but I believe he meant all\nthat stuff he told me. He was probably really aiming, in his own way,\nfor an improved world for men to live in.\"\n\nThe plane roared on. Presently Bell said shortly:\n\n\"That stuff he has won't last indefinitely. I'm glad I left him that\nrevolver.\"\n\nJamison stirred suddenly. He dug down in his pocket and fished out a\ncigar.\n\n\"Since I feel that I may live long enough to finish smoking this,\" he\nobserved dryly, \"I think I'll light it. I haven't felt that I had\ntwenty minutes of life ahead of me for a long time, now. A sense of\neconomy made me smoke cigarettes. It wouldn't be so much waste if you\nleft half a cigarette behind you when you were killed.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe tight little cabin began to reek of the tobacco. Paula pressed\nclose to Bell.\n\n\"But--Charles,\" she asked hopefully, \"is--is it really all right,\nnow?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" said Bell, frowning. \"Our job's over, anyhow. We go up\nthe Chilean coast and find that navy boat. We turn our stuff over to\nthem. They'll take over the task of seeing that every doctor,\neverywhere in South America, knows how to get The Master's poison out\nof the system of anybody who's affected. Some of them won't be\nreached, but most of them will. I looked at his formula. Standard\ndrugs, all of them. There won't be any trouble getting the news\nspread. The Master's slaves will nearly go crazy with joy. And,\" he\nadded grimly, \"I'm going to see to it that the Rio police take back\nwhat they said about us. I think we'll have enough pull to demand that\nmuch!\"\n\nHe was silent for a moment or so, thinking.\n\n\"I do think, Jamison,\" he said presently, \"we did a pretty good job.\"\n\nJamison grunted.\n\n\"If--if it's really over,\" said Paula hopefully, \"Charles--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You--will be able to think about me sometimes,\" asked Paula\nwistfully, \"instead of about The Master always?\"\n\nBell stared down at her.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" he groaned. \"I have been a brute, Paula! But I've been\nloving you--\" He stopped, and then said with the elaborate politeness\nand something of the customary idiotic air of a man making such an\nannouncement. \"I say, Jamison, did you know Paula and I were to be\nmarried?\"\n\nJamison snorted. Then he said placidly:\n\n\"No. Of course not. I never dreamed of such a thing. When did this\nremarkably original idea occur to you?\"\n\nHe puffed a huge cloud of smoke from his cigar. It was an unusually\nvile cigar. Bell scowled at him helplessly for a moment and then said\nwrathfully:\n\n\"Oh, go to hell!\"\n\nAnd he bent over and kissed Paula.\n\n(_The End._)\n\n[Advertisement: IN THE NEXT ISSUE\n\nJETTA OF THE LOWLANDS\n_Beginning an Exciting Three-Part Novel of the Nares Deep_\nBy Ray Cummings\n\nAN ATTACK FROM SPACE\n_A Sequel to \"Beyond the Heaviside Layer\"_\nBy Captain S.

Thompson Rich_\n\n[Illustration: The ray shot down--and squadrons of planes frizzled\nlike moths in the air.]\n\n[Sidenote: From Space came Cor's disc-city of Vada--its mighty,\nage-old engines weakening--its horde of dwarfs hungry for the Earth!]\n\n\nIn the burning solitude of the great Arizona desert, some two miles\nsouth of Ajo, a young scientist was about to perform an experiment\nthat might have far-reaching results for humanity.\n\nThe scientist was Gordon Kendrick--a tall, tanned, robust chap who\nlooked more like a prospector in search of gold than a professor of\nphysics from the State University of Tucson.\n\nIndeed, he was in a way, a prospector, since it was gold he\nsought--some practical method of tapping the vast radio-energetic\ntreasure of the sun--and it was an apparatus designed to accomplish\njust this that he was about to test.\n\nThe primary unit of the mechanism comprised a spheroidal vacuum-tube\nmeasuring a little over a foot across its long axis, mounted in a\nsteel bracket that held it horizontal with the ground. Down through\nits short axis ran a shaft on which was centered a light cross of\naluminum wire, carrying four vanes of mica, one face of each coated\nwith lampblack. A flexible cable led from the bottom of this shaft to\nthe base of the bracket, where it was geared to a small electric motor\ndriven by two dry cells. A rheostat-switch for delivering and\ncontrolling the current was mounted nearby.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAt the wide arc of the egg-shaped tube was a concave platinum cathode,\nat the narrow arc a nib of some sort, ending in a socket. From this\nsocket, two heavy insulated wires extended sixty feet or so across the\nsand to the secondary unit of the mechanism, which was roughly a\nseries of resistance coils, resembling those in an ordinary electric\nheater.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Kendrick prepared to test this delicate apparatus that represented\nso much of his time and thought, held so much of his hope locked up in\nit, a turmoil was in his heart, though his brown face was calm.\n\nIf his theories were right, that revolving cross would tap and draw\ninto its vanes radio-energetic waves of force, much as the whirling\narmature of a dynamo draws into its coils electro-magnetic waves of\nforce. For the blackened sides of the vanes, absorbing more radiation\nthan the bright sides, would cause the molecules to rebound from the\nwarmer surfaces with greater velocity, setting up an alternate\npressure and bringing the rays to a focus on the cathode, where they\nwould be reflected to the nib as waves of _heatricity_, to use the\nword he had coined.\n\nThose were Kendrick's theories, and now he moved to put them to the\nsupreme test. Switching on the current, he set the motor going. In\nresponse, the cross began to revolve, slowly at first--then faster,\nfaster, as he opened the rheostat wider.\n\nEyes fixed on his resistance coils, he gave a sudden cry of triumph.\nYes, there was no doubt about it! They were growing red, glowing\nbrightly, whitely, above the intense desert sunlight.\n\nHere was a means of convening solar radiation into heat, then, that\noffered tremendous commercial possibilities!\n\nBut even as he exulted, there came a blinding flash--and the overtaxed\ncoils burst into flame.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShielding his eyes from the glare, he reached for the rheostat, shut\noff the current, rushed to his secondary unit--where he beheld an\namazing sight. Not only had this part of the apparatus completely\ndisintegrated, but the sand of the desert floor under it as well. On\nthe spot quivered a miniature lake of molten glass!\n\nAs Kendrick stood ruefully beside that fiery pool, meditating on the\nspectacular but not altogether gratifying results of his experiment, a\npeculiar low humming sound reached his ears. Rushing back to his\nprimary unit, with the thought that perhaps by some chance he had not\nfully closed the rheostat, he looked at the cross. But no, the vanes\nwere still.\n\nThe humming increased, however--grew into a vibration that made his\neardrums ache.\n\nPuzzled, he looked around. What on earth could it be? Had his unruly\nexperiment called into play some tremendous, unsuspected force of the\nuniverse. Was he to bring the world to ruin, as a result of his blind\ngroping after this new giant of power?\n\nSuch predictions had often been made by the ignorant, to be dismissed\nby scientists as the veriest nonsense. But was there some truth in the\nuniversal fear, after all? Was he to be the Prometheus who stole fire\nfrom Olympus, the Samson who toppled down the temple?\n\nChilled, dizzied with the pain of the ever-increasing vibration, he\ngritted his teeth, awaiting he knew not what.\n\nThen it came--a spectacle so staggering that he went rigid with awe as\nhe regarded it, all power of motion utterly numbed for the moment. The\nvibration ceased. The thing appeared.\n\nIt was a city--a city in the air--a flying city!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs Kendrick stood staring at this phenomenon, he could scarcely credit\nhis senses.\n\nHad the magic carpet of Bagdad suddenly materialized before him, he\nwould not have been more astounded. And indeed, it was in a way a\nmagic carpet--a great disclike affair, several miles in diameter, its\nmyriad towers and spires glinting like gold under the noonday sun,\nwhile its vast shadow fell athwart the desert like the pall of an\neclipse.\n\nThe lower portion, he noted, was in the main flat, though a number of\nwartish protuberances jutted down from it, ejecting a pale violet\nemanation. Whatever this was it seemed to have the effect of holding\nthe thing motionless in the air, for it hovered there quite easily, a\nhundred yards or so above the ground.\n\nBut what was it? Where was it from? What had brought it?\n\nThose were the questions he wanted answered; and they were to be,\nsooner than he knew.\n\nAs he stood there speculating, a device like a trap-door opened in the\nbase of the disc, and creatures resembling human beings began\ndescending. Began floating down, rather.\n\nWhereupon Kendrick did what any sensible man would have done, under\nsimilar circumstances. He reacted into motion. In short, he ran.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGlancing back over his shoulder after a minute or two, however, he\ndrew up sheepishly. Of that strange apparition and those who had\ndescended from it there was not a trace, not a shadow!\n\nBut the peculiar humming had recommenced, he realized in the next\nbreath--and at the same instant he felt himself seized by invisible\nhands.\n\nThere was a struggle, but it was brief and futile. When it was over\nhis captors became visible once more. They were singular little beings\nabout four feet tall, with strange, wise, leathery faces, their heads\ngrotesquely bald.\n\nThe humming had ceased again. The disc, too, was once more visible.\n\nWhat happened next was something even more astounding, if there could\nbe any further degrees of wonder possible for the utterly baffled\nyoung scientist. He felt himself lifted up, leaving the desert floor,\nwhirling away toward that incredible phenomenon hovering there.\n\nAnother moment or two and he had been borne up through its trap-door\nopening, was standing in a dark space bounded by solid metal walls.\nThen he was thrust into a cylinder with several of his tiny guards,\nshot swiftly upward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA door opened as they came to rest, and he was led out into a vast\ncourt of gleaming amber crystal. Something like a taxi slid up, with\nirridescent planes, and he was bundled into it, whirled away again.\n\nDown broad, gleaming avenues they passed, where similar traffic flowed\ndensely, but under marvelous control. Towering skyscrapers loomed to\nright and left. Tier on tier of upper and lower boulevards revealed\nthemselves, all crowded with automotive and pedestrian activity.\n\nAt length a stupendous concourse was reached. Thousands of these taxis\nand similar vehicles were parked along its broad flanks, while literal\nswarms of diminutive individuals circulated to and fro.\n\nAssisted from the vehicle that had brought him to this obvious center\nof the disc's activities. Kendrick was led into a monumental structure\nof jade-green stone that towered a full hundred, stories above the\nstreet level. There he was escorted into another of those\nprojectilelike elevators, shot up, up--till at length it came to rest.\nThe door opened and he was led out into a small lobby of the same\namber crystal he had observed before.\n\nBy now his guards had diminished to two, but he no longer made any\neffort to escape. Wherever this amazing adventure might lead, he was\nresolved to follow it through.\n\nOne of the guards had advanced to a jewelled door and was pressing a\nbutton. In response, the door opened. A golden-robed, regal creature\nstood there.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThough dwarfed to four feet, like his fellow, he was obviously their\nmental superior to a prodigious degree. Not only was his symmetrical\nbald head of large brain content, but the finely-cut features of his\nparchment face bore the unmistakable stamp of a powerful intellect.\n\n\"_Ao-chaa!_\" commanded this evident monarch of the disc, addressing\nthe guards.\n\nThey bowed and departed, abruptly.\n\n\"My dear Kendrick!\" the regal personage now said, in thin, precise\nEnglish. \"It is indeed a pleasure to welcome you to my humble\nquarters. Pray enter and make yourself comfortable.\"\n\nWhereupon he ushered him into a dazzling apartment that was one vast\nmosaic of precious gems, indicated a richly carved chair, into which\nthe young scientist dropped wonderingly.\n\n\"Now then, Professor,\" continued the mighty little dwarf, when he was\nseated in a chair even more sumptuous, \"suppose we have a friendly\nlittle discussion. I have been much interested in your experiments on\nheat radiation. What you demonstrated this morning, in particular, was\nmost absorbing. You have hit upon a rather profound scientific\nprinciple, yes?\"\n\n\"Possibly,\" Kendrick admitted, quite conscious that he was being\npatronized.\n\n\"Oh, don't be modest, my dear fellow!\" smiled the dwarf. \"I am the\nlast one to belittle your achievement. Indeed, it is because of it\nthat I have invited you here to-day. Permit me to introduce myself,\nand to make clear one or two possibly perplexing matters. Then I am\nsure we shall have a most agreeable chat.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis name was Cor, he said, and he was in truth the monarch of this\nstrange realm. His people had come from the one-time planet of Vada,\nfar distant in the universe. A thousand years ago, this planet had\nbeen doomed by the approach of an alien star. Their great scientist,\nRavv, had met the emergency by inventing the disc, into whose\nconstruction they had poured all their resources. The pick of their\npopulace had been salvaged on this giant life-raft. The rest had\nperished when that destroying star had crashed down on the doomed\nVada.\n\nSince then these survivors and their descendants had been voyaging\nthrough space on their marvelous disc. For hundreds of years they had\ngiven no thought to the future, content to drift on and on in the\ninterstellar void, breathing an atmosphere produced artificially. But\nat length the inevitable had happened. This superb piece of mechanism\ndevised by their super-genius, Ravv, was beginning to show signs of\nwear. Some of its mighty engines were nearing the exhaustion point.\nEither they must soon find a planet comparable with the one they had\nonce known, where they could pause and rehabilitate their machinery,\nor they must disintegrate and pass into oblivion.\n\nFaced with that crisis, Cor had long been seeking such a planet. He\nhad found it, at last, in the earth--and had resolved that this was\nwhere they were going to alight and transplant the civilization of\nancient Vada, pending such time as they could take to space again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor some months now they had been hovering over various portions of\nthe earth, studying its geography and its peoples, with the result\nthat they had concluded the United States offered the most logical\npoint for launching the attack. Once this country was subdued, they\nwere in possession of the richest and most advanced section of the\nplanet. The conquest of the rest of it could await their leisure.\n\nWith such an invasion in view, their scientists had mastered the\nlanguage of the country. This had been accomplished very easily, since\nin addition to their power of mingling with the populace in an\ninvisible form, they had the principles of radio developed to a high\ndegree and were able to tune in on any station they wanted.\n\nKendrick sat there, stunned, as Cor followed his astounding revelation\nof their origin with this calm plan for the conquest of America, of\nthe world. Why, of all people on earth, had he alone been singled out\nfor this disclosure?\n\nHe asked the question now.\n\n\"My dear Professor, can't you really guess?\" replied Cor, with that\nleathery smile. \"Hasn't it dawned that you were a little too near our\nown field with that machine of yours? A trifle more research, a\nslightly different application--and you would have become a dangerous\nenemy.\"\n\n\"You--you mean--?\"\n\n\"I mean there isn't a great deal of difference between the experiments\nyou have been making and those our great Ravv once made. For instance,\nhad you broadcast your heatricity, as you call it, instead of trying\nto transmit it on wires--well, picture a receiving apparatus in each\nhome of the land, like your commercial radio sets. You would have\nbecome a billionaire, don't you see?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKendrick saw indeed. It was simple, so simple! Fool--why hadn't he\nthought of it?\n\n\"But your invention will never make you wealthy now, my dear fellow,\"\nCor went on, tauntingly. \"You will be our guest, here, until we have\ntaken over your interesting country. After that, if there is any need\nfor the broadcasting of heat, we will furnish it ourselves. We have\nthose facilities, among others, fully developed. Would you care to see\nour plant?\"\n\nKendrick naturally admitted that he would, so the dwarf led him\nthrough a rear door and up a winding flight of stairs. They emerged\npresently into a great laboratory housed in the glass-roofed pinnacle\nof the tower.\n\nThere he beheld a sight that left him breathless. Never before had he\nseen such an assemblage of scientific apparatus. Its vastness and\nstrangeness were fairly overpowering, even to a man as well versed in\nphysio-chemical paraphernalia as he was.\n\nBefore his eyes could take in a tenth part of the spectacle, Cor had\nled him to the left wall.\n\n\"There,\" he said, \"you will observe a development of your heat\ngenerator.\"\n\nKendrick looked--to see a long bank of large vacuum-tubes, each about\nthree feet high and a foot wide, connected by a central shaft that\ncaused series of little vanes in each of them to revolve at lightning\nspeed.\n\nAround the apparatus moved numerous small attendants, oiling, wiping,\nadjusting its many delicate parts.\n\n\"Well, what do you think now?\" asked Cor.\n\nKendrick made no reply, though he was thinking plenty.\n\n\"You see, it is your invention, my dear Professor,\" the dwarf went on\nin his taunting voice, \"only anteceded by a thousand years--and rather\nmore perfected, you must admit.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe walked now to the center of the laboratory, where stood a huge dial\nof white crystal, ranked with many levers and switches, all capped\nwith the same material.\n\n\"Behold!\" he said, throwing over one.\n\nInstantly there came again that peculiar low humming that had so\npuzzled him a few minutes before--and the entire room, its engines,\nits attendants, Cor himself, leapt into invisibility. Only Kendrick\nremained, facing the faintly visible crystal dial.\n\nThen he saw a switch move, as though automatically. But no, for the\ndwarf's hand was on it now. Visibility had returned. The vibration\nceased.\n\n\"That is the central control,\" said Cor. \"Our city and all its\ninhabitants become invisible when that switch is thrown. Only the dial\nremains, for the guidance of the operator, and even that cannot be\nseen at a distance of more than fifty feet. But now behold!\"\n\nHe raised his hand, touched a watch-like device strapped to his\nwrist--and was instantly invisible. But the laboratory and every\nmachine and person in it remained in plain view. Nor was there any\nvibration now.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next moment, having touched that curious little device again, Cor\nreappeared.\n\n\"That is the local control,\" he said. \"Every one of our inhabitants,\nexcept those under discipline, has one of these little mechanisms. It\nenables us to make ourselves invisible at will. A convenience at\ntimes, you must admit.\"\n\n\"Decidedly,\" Kendrick agreed. \"And the principle?\"\n\n\"Quite simple. One of those, in fact, that lies behind your\nresearches. Doubtless you would have hit upon it yourself in time.\nYour own scientist, Faraday, you may recall, held the opinion that the\nvarious forms under which the forces of matter manifest themselves\nhave a common origin. We of the disc, thanks to our great Ravv, have\nfound that common origin.\"\n\nIt was the origin of matter itself, Cor said, which lay in the ether\nof interstellar space--energy, raw, cosmic--vibrations, rays.\n\nBy harnessing and controlling these various rays, his people had been\nable to accomplish their seeming miracles--miracles that the people of\nearth, too, were beginning to achieve--as in electricity, for\ninstance, and its further application, radio.\n\nBut the people of Vada had long since mastered such simple rays, and\nnow, in possession of vastly more powerful ones, had the elemental\nforces of the universe at their disposal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe disc was propelled through space by short rays of tremendously\nhigh frequency, up above the ultra-violet. The same rays, directed\ndownward instead of outward, enabled them to overcome the pull of\ngravity when in a planet's influence, as at present. And the escalator\nrays, by which they could proceed to and from the disc, were also of\nhigh frequency, as were their invisibility rays.\n\n\"But you, Professor, are more interested in low frequency rays, the\nlong ones down below infra-red,\" continued Cor. \"You have seen our\ndevelopment of the heat-dynamo principle. It utilizes, I might add,\nnot only solar radiation but that of the stars as well. There being a\nbillion and a half of these in the universe, many of them a thousand\ntimes or more as large as your own sun, we naturally have quite an\nefficient little heating plant here. It provides us with our weapon of\nwarfare, as well as keeping us warm. Permit me to demonstrate.\"\n\nHe led the way to a gleaming circle of glass like an inverted\ntelescope, about a yard in diameter, mounted in the floor.\n\n\"Look!\" said the dwarf.\n\nKendrick did so--and there, spread below him, lay the floor of the\ndesert. His camp, his apparatus, were just as he had left them.\n\nCor now moved toward the dial.\n\n\"Behold!\" he said, pulling a lever.\n\nInstantly the scene below was an inferno. Stricken by a blast of\nstupendous heat, the whole area went molten, lay quivering like a lake\nof lava in the crater of an active volcano.\n\n\"Suppose, my dear Professor,\" smiled the dwarf, strolling back from\nthe dial, \"just suppose, for instance, that instead of the lonely\ncamp of an obscure scientist, your proud city of New York had been\nbelow there!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKendrick shuddered.\n\nWell he knew now the terrible power, the appalling menace of this\nstrange invader.\n\n\"I would prefer not to make such a supposition,\" he said, quietly,\nwith a last thoughtful glance at that witches' caldron below.\n\n\"Then let us think of pleasanter things. You are my guest of honor,\nsir--America's foremost scientist, though she may never realize it,\"\nwith a piping chuckle. \"To-night there will be a great banquet in your\nhonor. Meanwhile, suppose I show you to your quarters.\"\n\nNettled, fuming, though outwardly calm, Kendrick permitted himself to\nbe escorted from the laboratory to an ornate apartment on one of the\nlower floors.\n\nThere Cor left him, with the polite hint that he would find plenty of\nattendants handy should he require anything.\n\nAlone now, in the midst of this vast, nightmarish metropolis, he paced\nback and forth, back and forth--knowing the hideous fate that\nthreatened the world but powerless to issue one word of warning, much\nless avert it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKendrick was still thinking and brooding along these lines when he saw\nthe door of the apartment swiftly open and close again.\n\nSomeone had entered, invisible!\n\nBacking away, he waited, tense. Then, suddenly, his visitor\nmaterialized. With a gasp, he saw standing before him a beautiful\ngirl.\n\nShe was a young woman, rather, in her early twenties. Not one of these\npigmies of the disc either, but a tall, slender creature of his own\nworld.\n\nHer hair was dark, modishly bobbed. Her eyes were a deep, clear brown,\nher skin a warm olive. And she was dressed as though she had just\nstepped off Fifth Avenue--which indeed she had, not so long ago, as\nhe was soon to learn.\n\n\"I hope I haven't startled you too much, Mr. Kendrick,\" she said, in a\nrich, husky murmur, \"but--well, there wasn't any other way.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess I'll get over it,\" he replied with a smile. \"But you have\nthe advantage of me, since you know my name.\"\n\nHers was Marjorie Blake, she told him then.\n\n\"Not the daughter of Henderson Blake?\" he gasped.\n\n\"Yes,\" with a tremor, \"his only daughter.\"\n\nWhereupon Kendrick knew the solution of a mystery that had baffled the\npolice for weeks. The newspapers had been full of it at the time. This\nbeautiful girl, whose father was one of America's richest men and\npresident of its largest bank, had disappeared as though the earth had\nswallowed her. She had left their summer estate at Great Neck, Long\nIsland, on a bright June morning, bound for New York on a shopping\ntour--and had simply vanished.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuicide had been hinted by some of the papers, but had not been taken\nseriously, since she had no apparent motive for ending her life.\nAbduction seemed to be the more logical explanation, and huge rewards\nhad been offered by her frantic parents--all to no avail.\n\nWhat had happened was, she now explained, that after visiting several\nshops and making a number of purchases, she had stepped into Central\nPark at the Plaza for a breath of fresh air before lunching at the\nSherry-Netherlands, where she planned to meet some friends.\n\nBut before advancing a hundred yards along the secluded path, she had\nbeen seized by invisible hands--had felt something strapped to her\nwrist, before anyone came in sight--and then, invisible too, had been\nlifted up, whirled away into a vast, humming vibration that sounded\nthrough the air.\n\nOnce on the disc, it had swept off into space at incredible speed,\npausing only when some hundreds of miles above the earth and invisible\nfrom below without mechanical aid. When its vibration finally ceased\nthat amazing city had leapt before her eyes.\n\nThen, her own visibility restored, she had been led into the presence\nof that mighty little monarch, Cor, who explained that she had been\nseized as a hostage and would be held as an ace in the hole, pending\nconquest of her country. Since when she had been a prisoner aboard the\ndisc.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLearning of Kendrick's capture, from gossip among the women, she had\ntaken the first opportunity of coming to him, in the hope that between\nthem they might devise some means of escape.\n\nIndeed, that was his own fondest hope--their imperative need, if the\npeople of America and of the earth were to be saved from this\nappalling menace. But what basis was there for such a fantastic hope?\nJust one, that he could see.\n\n\"That thing on your wrist,\" he said, voicing it. \"I'm surprised they\nlet you wear one of those.\"\n\n\"They don't,\" she smiled. \"I stole it!--from one of the maids in my\napartment. It was the only way I could get here without being seen. I\nfelt I must see you at once. We've got to do something, soon, or it'll\nbe too late. I felt that, as a scientist, you might have some idea how\nwe could get off.\"\n\n\"How do the people themselves get off?\" he asked. \"That escalator\nray--do you know how they use it?\"\n\n\"No, I've never been able to find out. They don't let me go near that\npart of the city.\"\n\nKendrick reflected a moment.\n\n\"Let's have a look at that invisibility affair,\" he said.\n\nShe removed it from her wrist, handed it to him. Somewhat in awe, he\nexamined it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe mechanism portion, which was linked in a strap of elastic metal,\nresembled only superficially a watch, he now saw. Rather it had the\nappearance of some delicate electric switch. Rectangular in shape, it\nwas divided into two halves by a band of white crystal. In each of\nthese halves were two little buttons of the same material, those on\none side round, on the other square.\n\n\"Which buttons control the invisibility?\" he asked.\n\n\"The square ones,\" she replied. \"One's pushed in now, you see. If you\nshould push the other, the first would come out--and you'd pass out of\nthe picture, so to speak.\"\n\nKendrick was half tempted to try the thing then and there, but\ndeferred the impulse.\n\n\"What are the round buttons for?\" he inquired instead.\n\nMarjorie didn't know, but thought they were probably an emergency\npair, in case something went wrong with the square ones. In any event,\nnothing happened when you pushed them.\n\nKendrick pushed one, just to see. It was true. Nothing happened--but\nhe seemed to sense a faint, peculiar vibration and a wave of giddiness\nswept over him. On pushing the other, which released the first, it\nstopped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe handed the device back to Marjorie.\n\n\"There's your bracelet. Now, if I can just get one like it, I think\nwe'll get down to earth all right.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Kendrick!\" Her eyes lit up eagerly. \"Then you've thought of a\nway?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. I think I've discovered their own way. I can't be\ncertain, but I'm willing to gamble on it, if you are.\"\n\n\"Then you--you think those round buttons are connected with the\nescalator rays?\"\n\n\"Exactly! I think they control individual descent and ascent, just as\nthe square ones control individual visibility and invisibility. At\nany rate, it's the hunch I'm going to act on right now, if you're with\nme.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm with, you!\" she breathed. \"Anything, death almost, would be\npreferable to this.\"\n\n\"Then stand by, invisible. I'm going to get one of my jailors in here\nand relieve him of his wrist-watch.\"\n\nMarjorie touched that little square button on her own. She instantly\nbecame invisible.\n\nKendrick touched a button too, a button he had noticed beside the\ndoor. As he had supposed, it brought one of the Vadans.\n\nShutting the door quietly, he seized the fellow before he could move\nhis hand to his wrist. Thwarted in his attempt to vanish from sight,\nthe diminutive guard attempted an outcry. But Kendrick promptly\nthrottled him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMarjorie had reappeared by now and together they bound him to a chair\nwith a gilded cord torn from the drapery.\n\nRemoving the precious mechanism from his wrist, Kendrick slipped it on\nhis own.\n\n\"Now let's go!\" he said, pressing the protruding square button of the\ndevice. \"We haven't a minute to--my golly, what a peculiar sensation!\"\n\n\"It is rather odd, isn't it?\" she laughed, pressing her own and\njoining him in that invisible realm.\n\n\"Feels like a combination electric massage and cold shower! Where are\nyou, anyway? I can't see you.\"\n\n\"Of course you can't!\" came an unseen tinkle. \"Here!\"\n\nHe felt her brush him.\n\n\"Better hold hands,\" he suggested, then gave an invisible flush he was\nglad she couldn't see.\n\n\"All right. A good idea.\"\n\nHer delicate hand came into his, soft, warm. Heart vibrating even\nfaster than his body, his whole being a-quiver with a strange\nexaltation, Kendrick opened the door, and they left the apartment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next half-hour was the tensest either of then had ever\nexperienced. Every foot of the way was fraught with peril.\n\nNot only did they have to carefully avoid the visible swarms of little\npeople who hurried everywhere, but had to be on their guard as well\nagainst any who might be moving about like themselves under cover of\ninvisibility.\n\nNor could they use any elevator or public conveyances, but were\nobliged to make their way down to the concourse by heaven knew how\nmany flights of stairs, and cross heaven knew how many teeming streets\non foot, before they reached the amber court, below which the\ntrap-door and their hope of freedom.\n\nThey got there at last, however, descended, and peered down from that\nyawning brink upon the desert floor--to draw back with gasps of\ndismay. For the area still gleamed semi-molten from the stupendous\nblast that had wiped out Kendrick's camp.\n\n\"W-what is it?\" she gasped.\n\nSwiftly he told her.\n\n\"But isn't there any way around it? Look, over there to the left. One\nedge of the crater seems to end almost underneath us.\"\n\nIt was true that the center of the caldron was far to the right of\nwhere they stood, and that its left rim was only a little within their\ndirect line of descent. But to land even one foot inside that inferno\nwould be as fatal as to alight in its very midst.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKendrick was thinking fast.\n\n\"There's just a chance,\" he said. \"It all depends upon how wide the\nzone of these escalator rays is, and whether we can tune in on them.\nAt least, I can probably answer the latter question.\"\n\nPushing the protrudent round button on his mysterious bracelet as he\nspoke, he leaned over the edge of the trap-door and awaited results.\n\nThey were not long in coming. The vibration he was already under from\nthe invisibility rays seemed to double. Alternate waves of giddiness\nand depression, of push and pull, swept over him.\n\nA minute of it was enough. He pressed the round button that now\nprotruded, ending this influence, and faced Marjorie, stating:\n\n\"I'm positive now that these things control descent and ascent. As\nnearly as I can figure, the rays work on the principle of an endless\nbelt. If you're up here, you get carried down, and vice versa. As to\nhow wide the belt is, and whether you can move sideways on it, remains\nto be seen. Anyway, I'm going to take a chance. I'll go first. If my\nguess is wrong, you--well, needn't follow.\"\n\n\"No, I'm going with you!\" she declared resolutely. \"We've come this\nfar together. I shan't be left alone now. Let's go!\"\n\nAnd again her soft, warm hand was in his.\n\nLord, what a girl! How many would be brave enough to take a gamble\nlike that, on a fellow's mere supposition?\n\n\"All right--go it is!\" he said. \"Push your round button, like this.\"\nHe showed her the way he thought was right, pushed his own. \"Ready?\"\n\n\"Ready!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTheir voices were grave. It was a grim prospect, stepping off into\nspace like that, with only a guess between them and death.\n\n\"Then jump!\"\n\nThey jumped, gripping each other's hands tightly--and instead of\ndropping like plummets were caught in a powerful field of force and\nwhirled gently downward.\n\n\"Oh, you were right!\" gasped Marjorie, awed. \"See, we--\"\n\nThen she paused, horror-stricken, for it was obvious that they were to\ndescend within that lake of molten glass, unless they could change\ntheir course at once.\n\n\"Quick!\" he called. \"Hold fast! Now--run!\"\n\nBreathless, they raced to the left, across that invisible descending\nbelt.\n\nToo far, Kendrick knew, and they would plunge outside its zone, fall\ncrushed and mangled. Not far enough, and they would meet cremation. It\nwas a fearful hazard, either way, but it had to be taken.\n\nThey were almost down, now, and still not quite far enough to the\nleft. The heat of that yawning crater rose toward them.\n\n\"Faster--_faster_!\" he cried, fairly dragging her along with him.\n\nA last dash--a breathless instant--and they stood there on the ground,\nnot three feet from the edge of doom.\n\nSwooning with the heat, Marjorie swayed against him, murmured an\nincoherent prayer.\n\n\"Take heart!\" he whispered, lifting her bodily and bearing her some\nyards away. \"We're down--safe!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTheir safety was but relative, however, Kendrick well knew. Until they\ncould put miles between them and this monstrous disc, they were not\nreally safe. No telling how soon their escape might be discovered. No\ntelling what terrible means Cor might take of curbing their flight.\n\nSo as soon as Marjorie had recovered sufficiently to proceed, they\nheaded off across the desert at a fast walk toward Ajo, where he hoped\nto catch the afternoon train for Gila Bend. From there, they could\nboard the limited for Tucson and points east, when it came through\nfrom Yuma that night.\n\nThey had tuned out on the escalator rays, but continued on still\ninvisible--for the disc hung above them in plain view and it would\nhave been suicide to let themselves be seen.\n\nEven so, Kendrick soon began to have an uneasy feeling of being\nfollowed. He looked around from time to time, but could see nothing.\nWere some of those invisible little creatures on their trail?\n\nHe said nothing to Marjorie of his anxiety, but presently she too\nbegan glancing backward uneasily, every few steps.\n\n\"They are near us!\" she said at length, in a whisper. \"I can sense\nthem.\"\n\nIt was more than sense, they soon discovered. Little paddings became\nquite audible, and once or twice they saw the sand scuffed up, not\ntwenty feet away, as though by a foot passing over it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeanwhile they were climbing a rise of ground, broken by many small\nhummocks and dotted with thorny shrubs. On the other side, at the foot\nof a long down-slope, lay Ajo.\n\nOnce they reached the summit, Kendrick felt sure they could\noutdistance their pursuers on the descent. Already, if his watch was\nright, the train was preparing to pull out. It would be a breathless\ndash, but he was confident they could make it.\n\nSo he reassured Marjorie as best he could, and helped her on up the\nslope.\n\nThey were practically on the summit and already in view of the little\nrailroad station and huddle of shacks below--when suddenly he felt\nhimself tripped and flung violently to the ground. At the same\ninstant, his companion emitted a scream, as she felt herself seized by\ninvisible hands.\n\nLeaping to his feet, Kendrick flailed out with solid fists at their\nattackers. Groans answered the impacts and he knew his blows were\ntaking effect.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFree for a moment he dashed to Marjorie, felt for the midgets who\nswarmed around her. Seizing one of the invisible forms, he lifted it\nand flung it crashing to the ground. Another, likewise, and another.\n\nThen he threshed his legs, where two of the creatures clung, trying to\ndrag him down again. They flew through the air, with cries of fright.\n\n\"Well, so far, so good!\" he exclaimed. \"We won't wait to see if there\nare any more. Come on--let's go!\"\n\n\"Right!\"\n\nReaching for each other's hands, they raced down the slope.\n\nHalfway there they saw a warning blast of steam rise from the engine,\nfollowed by a whistle.\n\n\"They'll be pulling out in a minute now!\" he gasped, increasing speed.\n\"We've got to make it!--our only chance!\"\n\n\"We _will_ make it!\" she sobbed through clenched teeth, meeting his\npace.\n\nGlancing over his shoulder, after another fifteen seconds, Kendrick\nsaw that the disc was no longer visible. Since there was no vibration\nhe realized with relief that it was now hidden behind the slope they\nwere descending.\n\n\"Quick--push your button!\" he said, pushing his own.\n\nThey came out of the influence of the invisibility rays, raced\nbreathless on down the slope--gained the station platform just as the\ntrain was getting under way.\n\nHelping the exhausted girl aboard, he mounted the steps himself, led\nher through the vestibule into its single passenger coach.\n\nDropping into a seat, they sat there panting as the train gathered\nspeed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy the time the decrepit but life-saving little local drew into Gila\nBend they had somewhat recovered from their harrowing experience.\n\nMarjorie was still pale, however, as Kendrick helped her from the\ntrain.\n\n\"I may recover,\" she said with a wan smile, \"but I'll never look the\nsame! An old saying, but I know what it means now.\"\n\nHe thought better of a sudden impulse to tell her she looked quite all\nright to him. Instead, he said grimly:\n\n\"I know now what a lot of things mean!\"\n\nThe Tucson limited would not be through for over an hour, they\nlearned. That would give them time to hunt up the authorities and\nsound a warning of the ominous invader that was in the vicinity.\nPerhaps, by prompt military action, it might be destroyed, or at least\ncrippled.\n\nBut first they went to the telegraph office, where Marjorie got off a\nmessage that would bring joy to her grieved family.\n\nWhile standing there outside the barred window, odors of food wafting\nto them from a nearby lunch-room.\n\n\"Um-m!\" she sniffed. \"That smells good to me! I haven't tasted any\nearthly cooking for ages. Everything on that horrible disc was\nsynthetic.\"\n\n\"Then I suggest we have ham and eggs, at once,\" he said. \"Or would you\nprefer a steak?\"\n\n\"I think I'll have both!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs they walked into the lunch-room, Kendrick told her of the banquet\nin his honor Cor had promised for that night.\n\n\"I guess I didn't miss much,\" he ended.\n\n\"You certainly didn't!\" she assured him, with a smile. \"It would have\nopened with a pur\u00e9e of split-molecule soup, continued with an entr\u00e9e\nof breaded electrons, and closed with an ionic caf\u00e9.\"\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"I'm just as well satisfied. I was unable to attend! Humble as it is,\nI think this will prove to be much more wholesome food.\"\n\nNight had fallen by the time they left the lunch-room. Glancing at his\nwatch, Kendrick saw that they still had better than a half-hour before\nthe limited was due, so they betook themselves to the police station.\n\nIt was only a block away and in consequence they weren't long reaching\nit.\n\nThe chief had gone home, the officer at the desk informed them, but if\nthere was anything they cared to report, he would be glad to make note\nof it.\n\nA big raw-boned westerner, he shifted his quid as he spoke and spat\nresoundingly in a cuspidor at his feet.\n\n\"All right, then--get your pencil ready!\" said Kendrick with a smile.\n\"This is Miss Marjorie Blake, daughter of Henderson Blake, of New\nYork. Perhaps you read of her disappearance, a few weeks ago. And\nI....\"\n\nAs he introduced himself and told briefly of their astounding\nexperience, the officer's eyes bulged with amazement.\n\n\"Say, what yuh-all tryin' to hand me?\" he snorted finally. \"D'yuh\nthink I was born simple?\"\n\n\"Press your button!\" whispered Marjorie. \"Show him how the\ninvisibility ray works. It'll save a lot of argument.\"\n\n\"Right!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe held up his wrist.\n\n\"See this? Now watch!\"\n\nWhereupon he pressed the button. But to their dismay, nothing\nhappened.\n\n\"Wa-al. I'm still watchin'!\" drawled the officer. \"Who's loony now?\"\n\nKendrick examined the mechanism in impatience, pressed that little\nbutton repeatedly: but still nothing happened.\n\n\"Try yours!\" he told Marjorie finally.\n\nShe did so, with similar results--or lack of them, rather.\n\n\"Something's wrong,\" he said at length. \"The ray isn't working.\"\n\n\"Wrong is right!\" declared the officer with a contemptuous flood of\ntobacco juice. \"Yuh folks better go catch yuhr train 'fore yuh ferget\nwhere it is.\"\n\nChagrined, embarrassed, they took their leave, headed back toward the\nrailroad station.\n\n\"Of all the utterly silly things!\" declared Marjorie, as they walked\nalong. \"Why do you suppose it didn't work?\"\n\nKendrick didn't reply at once. When he did, his voice was grave.\n\n\"Because the disc has gone!\" he said. \"We are outside its zone of\ninfluence. That's my hunch, at least, and I think we'd better act on\nit.\"\n\n\"You mean...?\"\n\n\"I mean our escape has probably caused them to hurry their plans.\nThey're probably over New York right now. I think we'd better get\nthere the quickest possible way.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe result was that when the train came, they remained on it only to\nTucson. There they chartered a fast plane and started east at once.\n\nAt sunset the following day the plane swooped out of the sky and slid\nto rest on the broad grounds of the Blake estate at Great Neck.\n\nAs Kendrick stepped from the cabin and helped Marjorie down, a tall,\ndistinguished-looking man with graying hair and close-cropped mustache\ncame hurrying toward them.\n\n\"Daddy!\" she cried, rushing into his arms. \"Oh, Daddy--Daddy!\"\n\nEven without this demonstration. Kendrick would have recognized\nHenderson Blake from pictures he had seen recently in the papers.\n\nNow he was introduced, and Blake was gripping his hand warmly.\n\n\"I don't quite know what this is all about, Professor,\" he heard the\ngreat financier say. \"Marjorie's telegram last night was as cryptic as\nit was over-joying. But I do know that I owe you a deep debt of\ngratitude.\"\n\n\"Yes, and you owe our pilot about a thousand dollars, too!\" put in the\ndaughter of the house, clinging to her father's arm. \"Please give him\na check--then we'll go inside and I'll explain all about it.\"\n\n\"A matter very much easier dispatched than my debt to Professor\nKendrick,\" said Blake, complying.\n\nThe check was for two thousand, not one, the pilot saw when he\nreceived it.\n\n\"Thank you very much, sir!\" he said, saluting.\n\n\"Don't mention it. Good night--and good luck to you!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe pilot returned to his plane, it lifted from the lawn, droned off\ninto the twilight.\n\nThen they approached the cool white villa that stood invitingly a\nhundred yards or so away beyond sunken gardens.\n\nAs they neared it, a handsome, well-preserved woman whose face\nreflected Marjorie's own beauty came toward them. Lines of suffering\nwere still evident around her sensitive mouth, but her dark eyes were\nradiant.\n\n\"Mother!\"\n\n\"My poor darling!\"\n\nThey rushed into each other's arms, clung, sobbing and laughing.\n\nKendrick was glad when these intimate greetings were over and he had\nmet Mrs. Blake.\n\nThey were in the drawing-room now, listening to a somewhat more lucid\naccount of their daughter's experiences and those of her rescuer.\nMarjorie was doing most of the talking, but every now and again she\nwould turn to Kendrick for verification.\n\n\"Heavens!\" gasped Mrs. Blake, finally. \"Can such things be possible?\"\n\n\"Almost anything seems possible nowadays, my dear,\" her husband told\nher. \"And you say, Professor, that you have brought back samples of\nthis invisibility device?\"\n\n\"Yes, we have, but I can't promise they'll work. I'll try, however.\"\n\nWhereupon, sceptically, he pressed that little square button--and\ninstantly faded out of sight.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" cried Blake, leaping to his feet. \"That proves it! Why,\nthis is positively--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis remarks were cut short by a scream of terror from his wife.\n\n\"Marjorie--Marjorie!\" she shrieked.\n\nWheeling, he faced the chair where his daughter had sat. It was empty,\nso far as human eyes could see.\n\n\"Don't worry Mother--Daddy!\" came a calm voice from it. \"I'm quite all\nright--coming back--steady.\"\n\nAnd back she came, as did Kendrick, from the empty chair beside her.\n\nHis face was grave. The success of the demonstration, which had proved\ntheir story to practical-minded Henderson Blake, had proved to him\nsomething altogether more significant. The disc, as he had surmised,\nhad rushed eastward immediately on learning of their escape, and was\nnow probably hovering right over New York.\n\n\"Marvelous--marvelous!\" declared Blake. \"But that heat ray, Professor.\nThat sounds bad. You are convinced it is as powerful as they make\nout!\"\n\n\"Positively! That blast they let go in the desert would have utterly\ndestroyed New York.\"\n\n\"Hm! Yes, no doubt you're right. I fully realize how the fearful\nmenace of this thing. Do you think the military authorities will be\nable to cope with it?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Perhaps, if they are prompt enough.\"\n\n\"And is there no other way--no scientific way?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKendrick grew thoughtful.\n\n\"I wonder,\" he said at last. \"There's just a possibility--something\nrunning through my mind--an experiment I'd like to make, if I had the\nfacilities of some large electrical laboratory.\"\n\n\"You shall have them to-morrow!\" Blake promised. \"I'm one of the\ndirectors of Consolidated Electric. Their experimental laboratory in\nBrooklyn is the finest of its kind in America. I'll see that you have\nthe run of it.\"\n\n\"That will be very kind,\" said Kendrick. \"But don't expect anything to\ncome from it, necessarily. It's just a theory I want to work out.\"\n\nA butler entered at this moment and announced dinner.\n\n\"Well, theories are mighty these days!\" beamed Blake, as they rose,\nclapping the younger man on the shoulder. \"You go ahead with your\ntheories--and I'll bring a few facts to bear. To-morrow noon I'll\nescore some military men and others of my friends over to the\nlaboratory to hear and see something of this menace direct. Meanwhile,\nand during this crisis, it will honor me to have you as my guest.\"\n\n\"Our guest!\" amended Marjorie, with a warm smile.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNext morning Blake motored Kendrick out to the Brooklyn Laboratory of\nthe Consolidated Electric Utilities Corporation and installed him\nthere.\n\nThen he left--to return at noon with the promised delegation of\ngenerals, admirals, statesmen and financiers.\n\nThey were all frankly sceptical, though realizing that Henderson Blake\nwas not a man given to exaggeration. Nor did their scepticism\naltogether vanish when Kendrick had ended his bizarre story with a\ndemonstration of the invisibility device.\n\nMurmurs of amazement ran around the laboratory, it is true, but the\nmore hard-headed of his spectators charged him with having invented\nthe apparatus himself. Though they didn't come right out and say so,\nthey seemed to imply that he was seeking publicity.\n\nAnnoyedly, Kendrick tried to refute their charges. But even as he was\nsummoning words, refutation utter and complete came from the air.\n\nA low, humming vibration sounded, grew in volume till it filled the\nroom--and as suddenly ceased: The light of midday faded to twilight.\n\n\"_The disc!_\" gasped Kendrick, rushing to the west windows.\n\nThey followed, tense with awe. And there, between earth and sun, its\nmyriad towers and spires refracting a weird radiance, hovered that\nvast flying city.\n\n\"My God!\" muttered a famous general, staring as though he had seen a\nghost.\n\nA great statesman opened his lips, but no words came.\n\n\"Appalling! Incredible!\" burst from others of that stunned assemblage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTheir comments were cut short by a broadcast voice, thin and clear,\ntremendously amplified, a voice Kendrick recognized at once as that of\nCor.\n\n\"People of America!\" it said. \"We of the planet Vada have come to\nconquer your country. You will be given forty-eight hours to lay down\nyour arms. If complete surrender has not been made by high noon, two\ndays from now, New York will be destroyed.\"\n\nThe voice ceased. The humming recommenced--waned in volume till it\ndied away. Twilight turned once more to midday.\n\nPeering fixedly through the west windows of the laboratory, the little\nassemblage saw the disc swallowed up in the clear blue sky.\n\nThen they turned, faced one another gravely.\n\nOutside, on the streets, confusion reigned. In newspaper plants,\npresses were whirling. In telegraph and cable offices, keys were\nticking. From radio towers, waves were speeding.\n\nWithin an hour, the nation and the world knew of this planetary\ninvader and its staggering ultimatum.\n\nNaturally, the government at Washington refused to meet these shameful\nterms. Military and naval forces were rushed to the threatened\nmetropolis. The Atlantic Fleet steamed up from Hampton Roads under\nforced draught and assembled in the outer harbor. Thousands of planes\ngathered at Mitchell Field and other nearby aerodromes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut where was the enemy? He must be miles up in space, Kendrick knew,\nas he toiled feverishly in the laboratory over his experiment after a\nsleepless night. For had that flying city been nearer earth, it could\nnot have maintained invisibility without that peculiar humming\nvibration.\n\nScout planes urged on by impatient squadron commanders, climbed till\nthey reached their ceilings, searching in vain. They could encounter\nnothing, see nothing of the invader.\n\nThus passed a morning of growing tension.\n\nBut by noon of that day, with a bare twenty-four hours left before\nthe expiration of the ultimatum, the disc came down, showed itself\nboldly.\n\nThere followed stunning disasters.\n\nOne salvo, and the ray shot down--the Atlantic Fleet, the pride of\nAmerica, burst and melted in flaming hell. Squadrons of planes,\ncarrying tons of bombs, frizzled like moths in the air. Mighty\nprojectiles hurled by land batteries were deflected off on wild\ntrajectories.\n\nAppalled, the nation and the world followed in lurid extras these\ncrushing defeats.\n\nBy nightfall of that day, all seemed lost. All opposition had been\nobliterated. America must capitulate or perish. It had until the next\nnoon to decide which.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMeanwhile, in that great Brooklyn laboratory, Kendrick was working\nagainst time, besieged by frantic delegations of the nation's leaders.\nThey knew now that their one hope lay in him. Was he succeeding? Was\nthere even any hope?\n\nFace haggard, eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep, he waved them away,\nwent on with his work.\n\n\"I will tell you--as soon as I know.\"\n\nThat was all he would say.\n\nFollowed a night that was the blackest in all history, though the\nmyriad stars of heaven shone tauntingly brilliant in the summer sky.\n\nAt length, as dawn was breaking. Kendrick paused in his labors.\n\n\"There!\" he said, grimly, surveying an apparatus that seemed to\ninvolve the entire facilities of the laboratory. \"It is done! Now\nthen--will it work?\"\n\nThe delegation were called to witness the test.\n\nHenderson Blake was among them, as was Marjorie. She stepped forward,\nas he prepared to make the demonstration.\n\n\"I _know_, somehow, you're going to be successful!\" she murmured,\npressing his hand, meeting his eyes with a smile of confidence.\n\n\"I hope you're right--Marjorie!\" he replied, letting slip the last\nword almost unconsciously.\n\nHer face colored warmly as the stepped back and rejoined her father.\n\nKendrick's heart was beating fast as he turned to his instruments. How\ncould he fail, with faith like that behind him?--love, even, perhaps!\nHe mustn't fail--nor would he, if his theories were sound.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAddressing the assemblage, he explained briefly the complicated\napparatus.\n\n\"These towers,\" he said, pointing to four steel structures about ten\nfeet high, arranged at the corners of a square roughly twenty feet\nacross, \"are miniature radio masts. The area enclosed by them, we will\nassume, is the city of New York. That metal disc suspended above the\narea represents the invader. It contains a miniature heat-generator\nsuch as I was experimenting with recently in the Arizona desert.\"\n\nHe paused, threw a switch. Somewhere in the laboratory a dynamo began\nto whir.\n\n\"I am now sending electro-magnetic waves from the four towers,\" he\nresumed. \"But instead of broadcasting them in every direction. I am\nbending them in concave cathode of force over the city. You may\npicture this cathode as an invisible shield, if you choose, but it is\nmore than that. It it a reflector. If my theories are right, the\nradio-energetic ray I am about to project upon it from my miniature\ndisc will be flung back to its source as though it had been a ray of\nlight falling on a mirror. The success of the experiment depends upon\nwhat the result will be.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKendrick ceased, moved toward a rheostat.\n\nAs he made ready to touch it, a breathless tension settled upon the\nassemblage. Upon the outcome of what was now to happen rested the fate\nof America--and the world.\n\nCalmly, though every fiber of his being was at breaking stress, the\nyoung scientist opened the rheostat.\n\nFor an instant, the ray seared down--then, as it boomeranged back, the\ndisc burst into flame, dissolved, disintegrated. A thin dust, like\ncarbon, slowly settled to the laboratory floor.\n\nCutting off the current from the radio towers, Kendrick faced them, a\nlight of triumph in his tired eyes.\n\n\"You see--it works,\" he said.\n\nThey saw. Beyond a doubt, it worked!\n\nAnd what Kendrick saw, as his eyes met Marjorie's, made him forget his\nfatigue.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rest was a mad scramble of preparation. Only a few brief hours\nremained, and much was to be done.\n\nThe application of the principle that had just been demonstrated\ninvolved a hook-up from the Consolidated Electric laboratory with\nevery broadcasting station in the metropolitan area, power being\nsupplied by commandeering every generating plant within a radius of\nfifty miles.\n\nThe city, moreover, had to be evacuated of all but the few brave\nhundreds who volunteered to stand by their posts at radio stations and\ngenerating plants.\n\nAs for Kendrick, it was the busiest, most hectic morning he had ever\nexperienced. Only the realization of a girl's love and a nation's\ntrust enabled him to overcome the exhaustion of two sleepless nights.\n\nAt length, a little before eleven, all was in readiness. Just two\nquestions troubled the young scientist's mind. Had the people of the\ndisc learned of their preparations to counter the attack? And would\nthe improvised broadcasting apparatus of the area stand the stupendous\nstrain that would be placed upon it if the ray came down?\n\nThe first of these questions was answered, staggeringly, at a quarter\nafter eleven.\n\n\"Kendrick--oh, my God!\" cried Blake, bursting into the laboratory.\n\"Marjorie--they've got her again! Look! Read this!\"\n\nHe thrust out a piece of paper. Kendrick took it, read:\n\n     Your daughter will be my queen, after this noon.\n\n\"Where'd you get it?\" he gasped.\n\n\"One of the invisible devils thrust it into my hand right out in the\nstreet, not five minutes ago,\" Blake explained, trembling with\nanguish. \"Do you realize what this means, Kendrick? She's on the disc\nnow--and in a scant three-quarters of an hour....\"\n\n\"Yes, I realize!\" his voice came grimly. \"And I realize, too, that\nthey don't know their fate. They'll stay. There's forty-five minutes\nyet. We can't abandon our defense against the ray, not even for\nMarjorie. But I'll go, I'll rescue her--or die with her!\"\n\nAnd even as Blake mutely reached out his hand to grip that of the\ndetermined young man who stood before him. Kendrick touched his wrist\nmechanism and went invisible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOnce on the street, he pressed the escalator button as well--and by\nthe strength of the vibrations that followed, he knew he must be very\nclose within that mysterious lifting zone.\n\nRunning west a block, he found it growing stronger.\n\nFairly racing now, he continued on toward the river, progress\nunhampered in the deserted streets. Suddenly, with a thrill of\nexultation, he felt himself swept up, whirled away toward that great\nshimmering hulk against the sun.\n\n\"What hope?\" he was thinking. \"What possible hope?\" And the answer\ncame: Cor!\n\nReaching the disc, he switched out the escalator influence and\nhastened across the city to that monumental structure of jade-green\nstone.\n\nThe mighty little dwarf would be up there in his glittering mosaic\napartment, or in his pinnacle laboratory, perhaps, ready to pull the\nlever that would release that stupendous blast of heat.\n\nGaining the jewelled door of the monarch's quarters at last, after\nescaping detection by a hair's breadth more than once, he pressed the\nbutton outside, just as the guard had done that first time.\n\nIn response, the door opened--and there stood Cor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stood there an instant, that is, while the expression on his\nleathery face went from inquiry to alarm. Then, as Kendrick burst into\nthe room and shut the door, he went invisible.\n\nIn that same instant, the young scientist's eyes beheld a sight that\ncaused his heart to leap. There sat Marjorie, bound in a chair, an\nexpression half of hope, half of dejection, on her face.\n\n\"It's I--Gordon!\" he called. \"Take courage!\"\n\n\"Oh, I prayed so you'd come--and you came!\" she murmured as her face\nlighted. Then, tensely, she added, \"The door--look out!\"\n\nKendrick wheeled, and just in time. The door was opening.\n\n\"Not so fast!\" he called, lunging.\n\nHis hands gripped the dwarf, yanked him back, throttled him before he\ncould emit a cry, pushed the door shut.\n\nCor struggled like a madman, but it was futile. Kendrick's hands cut\ninto his throat like a vice. After a moment or two, he gasped,\nrelaxed.\n\nReleasing his grip then, Kendrick felt for his wrist, stripped off his\nbracelet--whereupon the dwarf became visible. His face was\nputty-white. He was either dead or unconscious.\n\nRestoring his own visibility then, he advanced to Marjorie, swiftly\nfreed her.\n\n\"Take this!\" he said, handing her Cor's bracelet.\n\nShe slipped it on.\n\n\"Now let's tie him and get out of here. He may be dead, but we can't\ntake any chances.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe dwarf wasn't dead, however, for he groaned and opened his eyes as\nthey lifted him into the chair.\n\n\"You win, Professor--but it avails you nothing!\" He smiled\nmaliciously. \"My capture, my death even, will not prevent the ray. The\norders have been given. It will be projected sharp at twelve. You but\ngo to your doom!\"\n\n\"That,\" said Kendrick, \"is a matter of opinion.\"\n\nSwiftly they bound him, gagged him.\n\n\"And now,\" he added, \"we wish you good day--and such fate as you\ndeserve!\"\n\nThen, turning to Marjorie:\n\n\"Your hand again!\"\n\nThere was a new tenderness in its soft warmth that thrilled him.\n\nThey touched their buttons, went invisible.\n\nSilently, then, they stole from the apartment. Swiftly they made their\nway down to the concourse, raced across the city to the amber court,\ndescended to the trap-door.\n\nIt must be nearly twelve, Kendrick knew. He couldn't look at his\nwatch, for it as well as himself was invisible. Indeed, even as they\nstood there, poised for the plunge, a faint whistle rose from below.\n\nMarjorie trembled.\n\n\"Steady!\" he spoke. \"Some of them always blow a minute or two before.\nAre you ready?\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Then press your button--jump!\"\n\nEven as they leapt, the sickening thought came that perhaps the\nescalator ray was no longer running. But the fear was unwarranted.\nThey were caught up, whirled gently downward.\n\nMoving along laterally, as they descended, they were able to land\nwithout difficulty in the middle of a deserted street near the\nConsolidated Electric laboratory.\n\n\"Thank heaven!\" she sighed, as their feet touched solid ground. They\npressed off both buttons, becoming visible once more.\n\n\"Echo!\" he agreed. \"So let's--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Kendrick never completed that sentence--for now whistles all over\nthe metropolitan area, rising from the generating plants, announced\nthe ominous hour.\n\nIt was high noon. The ultimatum had expired.\n\nLifting tense faces to the disc, they waited. Would that stupendous\nray be hurled back upon itself? Or would it sear through their\nmakeshift defense, plunging them and the whole great metropolis into\noblivion?\n\nSuddenly, cataclysmically, the answer came.\n\nThere burst a withering whirlwind from the disc. It struck that mighty\nconcave cathode of interlaced waves above the city. There followed an\ninstant's clash of titanic forces. Then the cathode triumphed, hurled\nit back.\n\nRocked by a concussion as of two worlds in impact, blinded by a glare\nthat made the sunlight seem feeble in comparison. Marjorie and\nKendrick clung together, while the disc grew into a satellite of\ncalcium fire in the sky.\n\nPresently, as the conflagration waned, they opened their eyes.\nGravely, but with deep thanksgiving, they searched each other's faces.\nIn them they read deep understanding, too, and a new hope.\n\n\"I think we'd better go and find father,\" she said at length, quietly.\n\n\"I think so too!\" he agreed.\n\nAs they headed toward the laboratory, a fine, powdery dust, like\nvolcanic ash was falling.\n\nIt continued to fall until the city streets were covered to a depth of\nan inch or more.\n\nThus passed the menace of Vada.\n\n[Advertisement: NO ONE MUST FORGET\n\n_That he has a standing\ninvitation to_\n\n\"Come Over In\n'THE READERS' CORNER'\"\n\n_And join in the general\ndiscussion of stories,\nauthors, likes, dislikes--everything\npertaining\nto_\n\nASTOUNDING STORIES\n\n_And Science-Fiction_]\n\n\n\n\nThe Readers' Corner\n\n_A Meeting Place for Readers of_ Astounding Stories\n\n[Illustration:]\n\n\n_To the Rescue_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I hope you can see fit to print this letter in the July\n     issue of Astounding Stories. This letter is written in\n     defence of Ray Cummings and in reply to the letter of C.\n     Harry Jaeger, 2900 Jordan Road, Oakland, California.\n\n     Following is an extract of Mr. Jaeger's letter: \"Also I like\n     my authors to make an original contribution to whatever\n     theory of science they develop fictionally. This, Ray\n     Cummings does not do in his very interesting story,\n     \"Phantoms of Reality.\" His beginning is palpably borrowed\n     from Francis Flagg's story, \"The Blue Dimension,\" which\n     appeared in a Science Fiction magazine in 1927.\" Another\n     paragraph is devoted to explaining his claim. He claims that\n     Cummings' method of transporting his characters from one\n     dimension or planet to another is practically copied from\n     Flagg's story. The method, that is, not the narration. I\n     hope to prove that if any borrowing was done, it was done by\n     Flagg. Incidentally, Flagg's story \"The Blue Dimension\" was\n     printed in 1928, not 1927, as Mr. Jaeger says.\n\n     I have in my possession a story by Ray Cummings named \"Into\n     the Fourth Dimension\" and published in another magazine\n     during the last month of 1926 and first ones of 1927. And in\n     this story--printed two years before Flagg's story--Cummings\n     uses almost the same apparatus of passing from one dimension\n     to another as is used in \"Phantoms of Reality.\" I will not\n     discuss whether this procedure is to be approved or not.\n\n     This letter is not to be construed as an attack on Mr.\n     Jaeger, or Mr. Flagg, or on either of the two stories under\n     discussion.\n\n     If Mr. Jaeger will let me know I will send him Ray Cumming's\n     story \"Into the Fourth Dimension,\" as clipped from the\n     magazines.\n\n     I write this letter to the magazine, instead of Mr. Jaeger,\n     so that if any one was misled by Mr. Jaeger's well meant but\n     mistaken criticism they will be straightened out.--Donald\n     Coneyon, Petoskey, Michigan.\n\n\n_A Wish for Success_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have read both of your first issues. I am writing to say\n     that I wish you success with your new magazine, which I know\n     will succeed.\n\n     Also to say I wish you would get more of the \"Carnes and Dr.\n     Bird Stories\" by Captain S. P. Meek, for I think everybody,\n     including myself, likes them. I also enjoyed \"Creatures of\n     the Light.\"--Thomas D. Taylor, 415 So. 7th St., Boise,\n     Idaho.\n\n\n_No Kick Any More_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have been a reader of Astounding Stories ever since you\n     started it, and I guess I'm getting too particular as I\n     don't get the kick out of it any more that I did out of the\n     first issues. That is, I don't get the kick out of ALL of\n     the stories as I did at first. However, \"Murder Madness\"\n     sure is a hot one. Why not print a story by Sax Rohmer, H.\n     G. Wells, or some of them?--H. Elsworth Jones, Box 340, R.\n     R. 6, Battle Creek, Mich.\n\n\n_Via Postcard_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Astounding Stories is an astounding magazine. It has really\n     astounding stories. It couldn't be better. There's hardly\n     room for improvement. May Astounding Stories be more\n     astounding yet. I like it!--Monroe Hood Stinson, 1742, 12th\n     Ave., Oakland, California.\n\n\n_Only Fiction!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just finished a story in the February, 1930, issue of\n     Astounding Stories entitled \"Into Space,\" by Sterner St.\n     Paul.\n\n     I would like to know if it is a true story, if the actions\n     described in it really happened, or is it merely a story of\n     fiction.--Dan S. Scherrer, Shawneetown, Ill.\n\n\n_Perhaps--Soon_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just finished reading your new magazine, Astounding\n     Stories. It is the best magazine I have ever read. Keep up\n     the good work and you will find me a constant reader. I have\n     only one suggestion to make: Let Astounding Stories come out\n     every other Thursday.--Harold Kulko, 433 Palmer E., Detroit,\n     Michigan.\n\n\n_More Preferences_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have read with great interest the second issue of\n     Astounding Stories and note your invitation for readers to\n     express themselves.\n\n     I enjoyed the whole magazine, finding the literary quality\n     surprisingly high. Especially good were \"Spawn of the\n     Stars,\" and \"Creatures of the Light.\" Harl Vincent's tale\n     was the best of his I have read; and Captain Meek's are\n     always good. \"The Corpse on the Grating,\" however, was\n     merely Poe's \"Fall of the House of Usher\" done over, and not\n     half so well.\n\n     As for the sort of tales I like, here they are in order of\n     preference:\n\n     1. Tales of weird mystery--Merritt's \"Moon Pool\" and his\n     others; Taine's \"White Lily.\"\n\n     2. Interplanetary Adventure--\"A Columbus of Space,\" by\n     Serviss; \"The Skylark of Space,\" by Smith.\n\n     3. \"Different stories,\" that defy classification, based on\n     new ideas of science--most of Wells' short stories are\n     examples. 4. Detective, Fourth Dimension, and air\n     adventure--only well done.--Jack Williamson, Box 661 Canyon,\n     Texas.\n\n\n_A Brick or Two_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     For the last three years we have been reading any and all of\n     the various Science Fiction magazines which have appeared\n     upon the market. We therefore feel that we are as well\n     qualified as anyone to offer the criticism and advice that\n     follows.\n\n     First, the stories. We feel that it would be a good idea to\n     get your stories from the same authors whose work has been\n     and is being accepted by the other magazines in this field.\n     In one case you have already done this, and I consider his\n     stories to be the best in each issue. I believe that you\n     will be forced to do this eventually, anyhow, because the\n     people who read this magazine will naturally be readers of\n     the others also, and will therefore, be used to the\n     standards set by those publications. Then, you should have\n     someone who is well qualified to pass upon the science in\n     the stories.\n\n     Second, the cover design and the pictures at the beginning\n     of each story. Up to this time the cover and inside pictures\n     have contained many mistakes. The cover of the March issue\n     was especially atrocious. In the first place a voyager in\n     outer space would find it jet black and studded with stars,\n     instead of blue and apparently empty, except for a few\n     tremendously oversize planets, a moon with entirely too many\n     craters, and a total eclipse of the sun with a very much\n     distorted corona visible beside the earth. Illustrations by\n     your cover artist also appear in another publication, but\n     these are much superior to the ones in Astounding Stories.\n     Here also a scientific advisor would be welcome.\n\n     Third, I think it would be a good idea to have a department\n     in which readers could write their opinions of the stories\n     and suggest improvements in the conduct of the magazine.\n\n     Fourth, I think there should be a scientific editorial in\n     each issue by some eminent scientist. This is also a feature\n     in the other magazines.\n\n     We hope that you take these criticisms and suggestions, as\n     they were offered, in good faith. We also hope that the\n     circulation will increase as the magazine becomes\n     better.--George L. Williams and Harry Heillisan, 5714 Howe\n     St., Pittsburgh, Pa.\n\n\n\"_Wonderful_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I received your magazine last week, Astounding Stories, and\n     I think it is wonderful. I am very glad that I subscribed\n     for it. I can hardly wait to get the latest one which I\n     hoped to receive to-day and was very much disappointed when\n     it did not arrive. I hope you will consider a quarterly or\n     at least an annual in the near future.\n\n     I wish you success with this magazine, and hope you will\n     forgive my writing you so often in reference to your\n     magazine--Louis Wentzler, 1935, Woodbine St., Brooklyn, New\n     York.\n\n\n--_But We Made Our Bow Only Last January!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Last month my boy brought one copy of this magazine home,\n     and I want to ask you if you would send me the copies from\n     last January, 1929, up to December, 1929. If you charge no\n     more than $3.00 would you send them C. O. D.? Do you have\n     the issues for 1928, too?\n\n     I never knew there was a magazine like that on the market. I\n     never bought one because most of them are no good, and when\n     one has children one has to be doubly careful.\n\n     But this magazine is just right. No silly love stories and\n     mushy stuff in them. It sure keeps your mind from unpleasant\n     things. We can get them from the newsstand but I would like\n     to subscribe for them.\n\n     Keep up the good work and please send me the last year's\n     copies and let me know if I could get 1928, too.--Mrs. M.\n     Ristan, 4684, No. Broadway, Denver, Colorado.\n\n\n\"_Best One Yet_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     The April issue is the best one you have put out yet. Arthur\n     J. Burks is GOOD. I hope to see much of him in the future.\n     \"Brigands of the Moon,\" by Ray Cummings, is getting better\n     with each instalment. The stories of Dr. Bird are always\n     interesting. I would like to see one in each issue, if you\n     could arrange for it.\n\n     As long as the other readers like the size of Astounding\n     stories, I will, too, but please cut all edges smooth like\n     the latest issue of Five Novels Monthly. I would like to see\n     a full-page illustration with each story, and if possible by\n     Wesso.\n\n     I am glad that you are starting another serial in the May\n     issue of Astounding Stories. I like serials and I hope that\n     you will always have two in each issue.\n\n     Your schedule for the May issue looks good, and I'm sure it\n     will be, with such authors as Murray Leinster, Victor\n     Rousseau, Ray Cummings, Harl Vincent and Sewell P. Wright.\n\n     I am still waiting for a different colored cover.--Jack\n     Darrow, 4225, N. Spaulding Ave., Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n_An Enthusiastic Reader_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     As a reader of long standing of Science Fiction I feel I am\n     qualified to make some remarks and give my opinion of the\n     wonderful Astounding Stories magazine lately put out.\n     Although I read three other Science Fiction magazines none\n     of them have aroused in me such a wonderful enthusiasm as\n     Astounding Stories. Before I forget it I want to mention\n     that I read two quarterlies also.\n\n     The reason, or rather reasons, for my enthusiasm I will now\n     enumerate. (1) The stories are wonderful. (2) The binding is\n     very strong and efficient. (3) The print is just right, and\n     soothing to the eyes of one who reads much. The paper is\n     good, and the size and price of the magazine is just right.\n     The covers are excellent, and with the addition of \"The\n     Readers' Corner\" the magazine becomes absolutely perfect.\n     Truly a wonderful start. See that it is kept up. The only\n     thing that can still spoil the magazine is poor stories.\n     Science Fiction stories that contain no science.\n\n     In \"Vampires of Venus\" the plot was rather weak. Even if the\n     Venerians knew nothing of entomology, they should have\n     brains enough to get rid of the vampires the way Leslie\n     Larner did without having to call an Earthman to help them.\n     Another thing: the Venerians kept only insects that were not\n     harmful to the crops. On Earth there are such insects who\n     help the farmer by eating harmful insects. If the harmful\n     insects were exterminated--an almost impossible and gigantic\n     task--the harmless insects would change their diet and\n     become harmful too. And it seems funny, too, that such a\n     highly civilized planet as Venus should still depend on\n     domesticated animals for food, drink and clothing instead of\n     manufacturing what they need synthetically.\n\n     The April cover on your magazine was wonderful.\n\n     Before I close I wish to say a word about the Science\n     Correspondence Club of which I am a proud member. There is\n     little to say, however, after reading Conrad Ruppert's\n     letter in the April issue. The membership has increased to\n     over 300 now, numbering among them quite a number of famous\n     scientists and authors. All I can say is that I hope every\n     scientifically inclined person of whatever nationality,\n     creed, color or sex they may be, will join this wonderful\n     and rapidly progressing club. I will now close thanking the\n     publishers of Astounding Stories for issuing such a\n     wonderful magazine--Stan Osowski, E2, Railroad St., Central\n     Falls, R. I.\n\n\n_But--Conniston Was An Impostor!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I read with interest Mr. Ray Cummings' story, \"Brigands of\n     the Moon,\" in the March number of Astounding Stories. The\n     tale was a worthy one from the pen of so clever a writer. I\n     do think, however, that the author might have left out the\n     point about Sir Arthur Conniston, an English gentleman,\n     turning traitor. This sort of thing is hardly calculated to\n     bring about a friendly feeling between England and America,\n     the two greatest countries in the world. I have the greatest\n     admiration for the United States, and though we may have a\n     little fun at each other's expense, there is no ill feeling\n     meant, but I really hope you will not publish any other\n     story like that one.--An Englishman, Montreal, Canada.\n\n\n_Likes the Romance_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just finished my second copy of Astounding Stories\n     and I wish to say I have enjoyed every story.\n\n     For some time I have been a reader of Science Fiction, but\n     none will compare to Astounding Stories. These stories seem\n     to have the proper amount of romance in them to make them\n     really interesting, and it adds the proper touch.\n\n     I have no criticism to make. May I wish you a great success\n     with this magazine--Frank I. Sontag, 825 Prescott Ave.,\n     Scranton, Pa.\n\n\n_High Praise_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Allow me to congratulate you upon the establishment of \"The\n     Readers' Corner.\" I do not know which was the first issue of\n     your delightful magazine, but I have been buying it\n     regularly for quite a few months.\n\n     I may not be an experienced critic, but it can be easily\n     seen by anyone that this magazine is one of the best on\n     sale. I, for one, enjoy your stories more than any other\n     stories I have ever read.\n\n     I have just finished the second part of the four-part serial\n     entitled \"Brigands of the Moon.\" I thing Ray Cummings is the\n     best author I have ever met up with in stories. The drawings\n     are fine, the print is excellent, but I think the paper\n     could be improved. But by no means change the size of your\n     little magazine. The size is just right.\n\n     In your April issue I read in \"The Readers' Corner\" about a\n     Science Correspondence Club. Believe me when I say I'm\n     sending immediately for an application blank. I think the\n     idea of this club is excellent.\n\n     Truly you have contributed a great gift to Science Fiction\n     readers in offering this magazine to the receptive\n     public.--Theodore L. Page, 2361 Los Angeles Ave.,\n     Pittsburgh, Pa.\n\n\n\"_Don't Do It!_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     This afternoon I saw Astounding Stories for the first time\n     and immediately grabbed a copy, as I have read others of the\n     Clayton group, and moreover am a Science Fiction fan.\n\n     The newsstand has no back numbers, and I simply must have\n     the March 1930 issue, as I wish to read \"Brigands of the\n     Moon,\" so here is 25\u00a2, in stamps to cover purchase price and\n     cost of mailing me a copy of that issue.\n\n     Have you a complete file since Vol. 1, No. 1? If so, what is\n     the cost including charges? I'm sorry that I missed this\n     magazine before, but you can rest assured that I'll miss no\n     more.\n\n     In the \"Readers' Corner\" I notice a call from Stephen Takacs\n     for a change in size. DON'T DO IT! The size and shape are O.\n     K., and to make it the awkward size of most magazines\n     (including two of the Science Fiction magazines that I am\n     now a confirmed reader of), would not improve it a bit.\n\n     You have two of my favorite authors in the April number; no,\n     I see it is three--Burks, Cummings and Meek. They are O. K.,\n     but don't forget a few others, such as Burroughs, Verrill,\n     Hamilton, Coblentz, Keller, Quinn, Williamson, Leinster,\n     Repp, Vincent, Flagg--oh, why continue; you certainly know\n     all the good authors of OUR kind of fiction; try them all.\n     Of course, the other Science Fiction magazines that I take\n     are full of stories by my favorites, but you can get stories\n     by them too.\n\n     From this one issue that I have read I can see only praise\n     for your publication. Here's to a long life and a happy one.\n\n     Don't forget to send me the March issue as fast as the mail\n     can get it here--Robert J. Hyatt, 1353 Kenyon St., N. W.,\n     Washington D. C.\n\n\n\"_Worst Ever Read_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Since you invite criticism as well as praise, I am impelled\n     to state that by far the worst story I ever read in any\n     Science Fiction magazine was \"Vampires of Venus,\" by Anthony\n     Pelcher, which appeared in your April issue. It was so\n     idiotic, so flat and inane, that it might have passed for a\n     burlesque rather than a straight story, were it not\n     painfully evident that the author was serious. The yarn was\n     unworthy of Astounding Stories and did not belong in this\n     magazine.\n\n     The other stories, except for an amateurish attempt called\n     \"The Man Who Was Dead,\" were deeply engrossing and of\n     unusual merit.--Sears Langell, 1214 Boston Road, New York.\n\n\n\"_The Readers' Corner_\"\n\nAll Readers are extended a sincere and cordial invitation to \"come\nover in 'The Readers' Corner'\" and join in our monthly discussion of\nstories, authors, scientific principles and possibilities--everything\nthat's of common interest in connection with our Astounding Stories.\n\nAlthough from time to time the Editor may make a comment or so, this\nis a department primarily for _Readers_, and we want you to make full\nuse of it. Likes, dislikes, criticisms, explanations, roses,\nbrickbats, suggestions--everything's welcome here; so \"come over in\n'The Readers' Corner'\" and discuss it with all of us!\n\n--_The Editor._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Astounding Stories of Super-Science,\nAugust 1930, by Various\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ASTOUNDING STORIES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29768-8.txt or 29768-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/7/6/29768/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
