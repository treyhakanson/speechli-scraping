SMITH &\n E. EVERETT EVANS\n\n\n Illustrated by BERRY\n\n\n\n\n The Masters had ruled all space\n with an unconquerable iron fist. But\n the Masters were gone. And this new,\n young race who came now to take their\n place--could they hope to defeat the\n ancient Enemy of All?\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n\"But didn't you feel _anything_, Javo?\" Strain was apparent in every\nline of Tula's taut, bare body. \"Nothing at all?\"\n\n\"Nothing whatever.\" The one called Javo relaxed from his rigid\nconcentration. \"Nothing has changed. Nor will it.\"\n\n\"That conclusion is indefensible!\" Tula snapped. \"With the promised\nreturn of the Masters there must and will be changes. Didn't _any_ of\nyou feel anything?\"\n\nHer hot, demanding eyes swept the group; a group whose like, except for\nphysical perfection, could be found in any nudist colony.\n\nNo one except Tula had felt a thing.\n\n\"That fact is not too surprising,\" Javo said finally. \"You have the most\nsensitive receptors of us all. But are you sure?\"\n\n\"I am sure. It was the thought-form of a living Master.\"\n\n\"Do you think that the Master perceived your web?\"\n\n\"It is certain. Those who built us are stronger than we.\"\n\n\"That is true. As they promised, then, so long and long ago, our Masters\nare returning home to us.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJarvis Hilton of Terra, the youngest man yet to be assigned to direct\nany such tremendous deep-space undertaking as Project Theta Orionis,\nsat in conference with his two seconds-in-command. Assistant Director\nSandra Cummings, analyst-synthesist and semantician, was tall, blonde\nand svelte. Planetographer William Karns--a black-haired, black-browed,\nblack-eyed man of thirty--was third in rank of the scientific group.\n\n\"I'm telling you, Jarve, you can't have it both ways,\" Karns declared.\n\"Captain Sawtelle is old-school Navy brass. He goes strictly by the\nbook. So you've got to draw a razor-sharp line; exactly where the\nAdvisory Board's directive puts it. And next time he sticks his ugly\npuss across that line, kick his face in. You've been Caspar Milquetoast\nTwo ever since we left Base.\"\n\n\"That's the way it looks to you?\" Hilton's right hand became a fist.\n\"The man has age, experience and ability. I've been trying to meet him\non a ground of courtesy and decency.\"\n\n\"Exactly. And he doesn't recognize the existence of either. And, since\nthe Board rammed you down his throat instead of giving him old Jeffers,\nyou needn't expect him to.\"\n\n\"You may be right, Bill. What do you think, Dr. Cummings?\"\n\nThe girl said: \"Bill's right. Also, your constant appeasement isn't\ndoing the morale of the whole scientific group a bit of good.\"\n\n\"Well, I haven't enjoyed it, either. So next time I'll pin his ears\nback. Anything else?\"\n\n\"Yes, Dr. Hilton, I have a squawk of my own. I know I was rammed down\nyour throat, but just when are you going to let me do some work?\"\n\n\"None of us has much of anything to do yet, and won't have until we\nlight somewhere. You're off base a country mile.\"\n\n\"I'm not off base. You _did_ want Eggleston, not me.\"\n\n\"Sure I did. I've worked with him and know what he can do. But I'm not\nholding a grudge about it.\"\n\n\"No? Why, then, are you on first-name terms with everyone in the\nscientific group except me? Supposedly your first assistant?\"\n\n\"That's easy!\" Hilton snapped. \"Because you've been carrying chips on\nboth shoulders ever since you came aboard ... or at least I thought you\nwere.\" Hilton grinned suddenly and held out his hand. \"Sorry,\nSandy--I'll start all over again.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry too, Chief.\" They shook hands warmly. \"I _was_ pretty stiff,\nI guess, but I'll be good.\"\n\n\"You'll go to work right now, too. As semantician. Dig out that\ndirective and tear it down. Draw that line Bill talked about.\"\n\n\"Can do, boss.\" She swung to her feet and walked out of the room, her\nevery movement one of lithe and easy grace.\n\nKarns followed her with his eyes. \"Funny. A trained-dancer Ph.D. And a\nMiss America type, like all the other women aboard this spacer. I wonder\nif she'll make out.\"\n\n\"So do I. I still wish they'd given me Eggy. I've never seen an\nexecutive-type female Ph.D. yet that was worth the cyanide it would take\nto poison her.\"\n\n\"That's what Sawtelle thinks of you, too, you know.\"\n\n\"I know; and the Board _does_ know its stuff. So I'm really hoping,\nBill, that she surprises me as much as I intend to surprise the Navy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlarm bells clanged as the mighty _Perseus_ blinked out of overdrive.\nEvery crewman sprang to his post.\n\n\"Mister Snowden, why did we emerge without orders from me?\" Captain\nSawtelle bellowed, storming into the control room three jumps behind\nHilton.\n\n\"The automatics took control, sir,\" he said, quietly.\n\n\"Automatics! I _give_ the orders!\"\n\n\"In this case, Captain Sawtelle, you don't,\" Hilton said. Eyes locked\nand held. To Sawtelle, this was a new and strange co-commander. \"I would\nsuggest that we discuss this matter in private.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir,\" Sawtelle said; and in the captain's cabin Hilton\nopened up.\n\n\"For your information, Captain Sawtelle, I set my inter-space coupling\ndetectors for any objective I choose. When any one of them reacts, it\ntrips the kickers and we emerge. During any emergency outside the Solar\nSystem I am in command--with the provision that I must relinquish\ncommand to you in case of armed attack on us.\"\n\n\"Where do you think you found any such stuff as that in the directive?\nIt isn't there and I know my rights.\"\n\n\"It is, and you don't. Here is a semantic chart of the whole directive.\nAs you will note, it overrides many Navy regulations. Disobedience of my\norders constitutes mutiny and I can--and will--have you put in irons and\nsent back to Terra for court-martial. Now let's go back.\"\n\nIn the control room, Hilton said, \"The target has a mass of\napproximately five hundred metric tons. There is also a significant\namount of radiation characteristic of uranexite. You will please execute\nsearch, Captain Sawtelle.\"\n\nAnd Captain Sawtelle ordered the search.\n\n\"What did you do to the big jerk, boss?\" Sandra whispered.\n\n\"What you and Bill suggested,\" Hilton whispered back. \"Thanks to your\nanalysis of the directive--pure gobbledygook if there ever was any--I\ncould. Mighty good job, Sandy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTen or fifteen more minutes passed. Then:\n\n\"Here's the source of radiation, sir,\" a searchman reported. \"It's a\npoint source, though, not an object at this range.\"\n\n\"And here's the artifact, sir,\" Pilot Snowden said. \"We're coming up on\nit fast. But ... but what's a _skyscraper_ skeleton doing out here in\ninterstellar space?\"\n\nAs they closed up, everyone could see that the thing did indeed look\nlike the metallic skeleton of a great building. It was a huge cube,\nmeasuring well over a hundred yards along each edge. And it was empty.\n\n\"_That's_ one for the book,\" Sawtelle said.\n\n\"And how!\" Hilton agreed. \"I'll take a boat ... no, suits would be\nbetter. Karns, Yarborough, get Techs Leeds and Miller and suit up.\"\n\n\"You'll need a boat escort,\" Sawtelle said. \"Mr. Ashley, execute escort\nLanding Craft One, Two, and Three.\"\n\nThe three landing craft approached that enigmatic lattice-work of\nstructural steel and stopped. Five grotesquely armored figures wafted\nthemselves forward on pencils of force. Their leader, whose suit bore\nthe number \"14\", reached a mammoth girder and worked his way along it up\nto a peculiar-looking bulge. The whole immense structure vanished,\nleaving men and boats in empty space.\n\nSawtelle gasped. \"Snowden! Are you holding 'em?\"\n\n\"No, sir. Faster than light; hyperspace, sir.\"\n\n\"Mr. Ashby, did you have your interspace rigs set?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I didn't think of it, sir.\"\n\n\"Doctor Cummings, why weren't yours out?\"\n\n\"I didn't think of such a thing, either--any more than you did,\" Sandra\nsaid.\n\nAshby, the Communications Officer, had been working the radio. \"No reply\nfrom anyone, sir,\" he reported.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" Sandra exclaimed. Then, \"But look! They're firing\npistols--especially the one wearing number fourteen--but _pistols_?\"\n\n\"Recoil pistols--sixty-threes--for emergency use in case of power\nfailure,\" Ashby explained. \"That's it ... but I can't see why _all_\ntheir power went out at once. But Fourteen--that's Hilton--is really\ndoing a job with that sixty-three. He'll be here in a couple of\nminutes.\"\n\nAnd he was. \"Every power unit out there--suits and boats both--drained,\"\nHilton reported. \"_Completely_ drained. Get some help out there fast!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn an enormous structure deep below the surface of a far-distant world a\ngroup of technicians clustered together in front of one section of a\ntwo-miles long control board. They were staring at a light that had just\nappeared where no light should have been.\n\n\"Someone's brain-pan will be burned out for this,\" one of the group\nradiated harshly. \"That unit was inactivated long ago and it has not\nbeen reactivated.\"\n\n\"Someone committed an error, Your Loftiness?\"\n\n\"Silence, fool! Stretts do not commit errors!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as it was clear that no one had been injured, Sawtelle demanded,\n\"How about it, Hilton?\"\n\n\"Structurally, it was high-alloy steel. There were many bulges, possibly\ncontaining mechanisms. There were drive-units of a non-Terran type.\nThere were many projectors, which--at a rough guess--were a hundred\ntimes as powerful as any I have ever seen before. There were no\nindications that the thing had ever been enclosed, in whole or in part.\nIt certainly never had living quarters for warm-blooded,\noxygen-breathing eaters of organic food.\"\n\nSawtelle snorted. \"You mean it never had a crew?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily....\"\n\n\"Bah! What other kind of intelligent life is there?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But before we speculate too much, let's look at the\ntri-di. The camera may have caught something I missed.\"\n\nIt hadn't. The three-dimensional pictures added nothing.\n\n\"It probably was operated either by programmed automatics or by remote\ncontrol,\" Hilton decided, finally. \"But how did they drain all our\npower? And just as bad, what and how is that other point source of power\nwe're heading for now?\"\n\n\"What's wrong with it?\" Sawtelle asked.\n\n\"Its strength. No matter what distance or reactant I assume, nothing we\nknow will fit. Neither fission nor fusion will do it. It has to be\npractically total conversion!\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nThe _Perseus_ snapped out of overdrive near the point of interest and\nHilton stared, motionless and silent.\n\nSpace was full of madly warring ships. Half of them were bare, giant\nskeletons of steel, like the \"derelict\" that had so unexpectedly\nblasted away from them. The others were more or less like the _Perseus_,\nexcept in being bigger, faster and of vastly greater power.\n\nBeams of starkly incredible power bit at and clung to equally capable\ndefensive screens of pure force. As these inconceivable forces met, the\nglare of their neutralization filled all nearby space. And ships and\nskeletons alike were disappearing in chunks, blobs, gouts, streamers and\nsparkles of rended, fused and vaporized metal.\n\nHilton watched two ships combine against one skeleton. Dozens of beams,\nincredibly tight and hard, were held inexorably upon dozens of the\nbulges of the skeleton. Overloaded, the bulges' screens flared through\nthe spectrum and failed. And bare metal, however refractory, endures\nonly for instants under the appalling intensity of such beams as those.\n\nThe skeletons tried to duplicate the ships' method of attack, but\nfailed. They were too slow. Not slow, exactly, either, but hesitant; as\nthough it required whole seconds for the commander--or operator? Or\nremote controller?--of each skeleton to make it act. The ships were\nwinning.\n\n\"Hey!\" Hilton yelped. \"Oh--that's the one we saw back there. But what\nin all space does it think it's doing?\"\n\nIt was plunging at tremendous speed straight through the immense fleet\nof embattled skeletons. It did not fire a beam nor energize a screen; it\nmerely plunged along as though on a plotted course until it collided\nwith one of the skeletons of the fleet and both structures plunged, a\ntangled mass of wreckage, to the ground of the planet below.\n\nThen hundreds of the ships shot forward, each to plunge into and explode\ninside one of the skeletons. When visibility was restored another wave\nof ships came forward to repeat the performance, but there was nothing\nleft to fight. Every surviving skeleton had blinked out of normal space.\n\nThe remaining ships made no effort to pursue the skeletons, nor did they\nre-form as a fleet. Each ship went off by itself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd on that distant planet of the Stretts the group of mechs watched\nwith amazed disbelief as light after light after light winked out on\ntheir two-miles-long control board. Frantically they relayed orders to\nthe skeletons; orders which did not affect the losses.\n\n\"Brain-pans will blacken for this ...\" a mental snarl began, to be\ninterrupted by a coldly imperious thought.\n\n\"That long-dead unit, so inexplicably reactivated, is approaching the\nfuel world. It is ignoring the battle. It is heading through our fleet\ntoward the Oman half ... _handle_ it, ten-eighteen!\"\n\n\"It does not respond, Your Loftiness.\"\n\n\"Then blast it, fool! Ah, it is inactivated. As encyclopedist, Nine,\nexplain the freakish behavior of that unit.\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Loftiness. Many cycles ago we sent a ship against the Omans\nwith a new device of destruction. The Omans must have intercepted it,\ndrained it of power and allowed it to drift on. After all these cycles\nof time it must have come upon a small source of power and of course\ncontinued its mission.\"\n\n\"That can be the truth. The Lords of the Universe must be informed.\"\n\n\"The mining units, the carriers and the refiners have not been affected,\nYour Loftiness,\" a mech radiated.\n\n\"So I see, fool.\" Then, activating another instrument, His Loftiness\nthought at it, in an entirely different vein, \"Lord Ynos, Madam? I have\nto make a very grave report....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the _Perseus_, four scientists and three Navy officers were arguing\nheatedly; employing deep-space verbiage not to be found in any\ndictionary. \"Jarve!\" Karns called out, and Hilton joined the group.\n\"Does anything about this planet make any sense to you?\"\n\n\"No. But you're the planetographer. 'Smatter with it?\"\n\n\"It's a good three hundred degrees Kelvin too hot.\"\n\n\"Well, you know it's loaded with uranexite.\"\n\n\"That much? The whole crust practically jewelry ore?\"\n\n\"If that's what the figures say, I'll buy it.\"\n\n\"Buy _this_, then. Continuous daylight everywhere. Noon June Sol-quality\nlight _except_ that it's all in the visible. Frank says it's from\nbombardment of a layer of something, and Frank admits that the whole\nthing's impossible.\"\n\n\"When Frank makes up his mind what 'something' is, I'll take it as a\ndatum.\"\n\n\"Third thing: there's only one city on this continent, and it's\nprotected by a screen that nobody ever heard of.\"\n\nHilton pondered, then turned to the captain. \"Will you please run a\nsearch-pattern, sir? Fine-toothing only the hot spots?\"\n\nThe planet was approximately the same size as Terra; its atmosphere,\nexcept for its intense radiation, was similar to Terra's. There were two\ncontinents; one immense girdling ocean. The temperature of the land\nsurface was everywhere about 100\u00b0F, that of the water about 90\u00b0F. Each\ncontinent had one city, and both were small. One was inhabited by what\nlooked like human beings; the other by usuform robots. The human city\nwas the only cool spot on the entire planet; under its protective dome\nthe temperature was 71\u00b0F.\n\nHilton decided to study the robots first; and asked the captain to take\nthe ship down to observation range. Sawtelle objected; and continued to\nobject until Hilton started to order his arrest. Then he said, \"I'll do\nit, under protest, but I want it on record that I am doing it against my\nbest judgment.\"\n\n\"It's on record,\" Hilton said, coldly. \"Everything said and done is\nbeing, and will continue to be, recorded.\"\n\nThe _Perseus_ floated downward. \"_There's_ what I want most to see,\"\nHilton said, finally. \"That big strip-mining operation ... that's it ...\nhold it!\" Then, via throat-mike, \"Attention, all scientists! You all\nknow what to do. Start doing it.\"\n\nSandra's blonde head was very close to Hilton's brown one as they both\nstared into Hilton's plate. \"Why, they look like giant armadillos!\" she\nexclaimed.\n\n\"More like tanks,\" he disagreed, \"except that they've got legs, wheels\n_and_ treads--and arms, cutters, diggers, probes and conveyors--and\n_look_ at the way those buckets dip solid rock!\"\n\nThe fantastic machine was moving very slowly along a bench or shelf that\nit was making for itself as it went along. Below it, to its left,\ndropped other benches being made by other mining machines. The machines\nwere not using explosives. Hard though the ore was, the tools were so\nmuch harder and were driven with such tremendous power that the stuff\nmight just have well have been slightly-clayed sand.\n\nEvery bit of loosened ore, down to the finest dust, was forced into a\nconveyor and thence into the armored body of the machine. There it went\ninto a mechanism whose basic principles Hilton could not understand.\nFrom this monstrosity emerged two streams of product.\n\nOne of these, comprising ninety-nine point nine plus percent of the\ninput, went out through another conveyor into the vast hold of a vehicle\nwhich, when full and replaced by a duplicate of itself, went careening\nmadly cross-country to a dump.\n\nThe other product, a slow, very small stream of tiny, glistening black\npellets, fell into a one-gallon container being held watchfully by a\nsmall machine, more or less like a three-wheeled motor scooter, which\nwas moving carefully along beside the giant miner. When this can was\nalmost full another scooter rolled up and, without losing a single\npellet, took over place and function. The first scooter then covered its\nbucket, clamped it solidly into a recess designed for the purpose and\ndashed away toward the city.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHilton stared slack-jawed at Sandra. She stared back.\n\n\"Do you make anything of that, Jarve?\"\n\n\"Nothing. They're taking _pure_ uranexite and _concentrating_--or\nconverting--it a thousand to one. I _hope_ we'll be able to do something\nabout it.\"\n\n\"I hope so, too, Chief; and I'm _sure_ we will.\"\n\n\"Well, that's enough for now. You may take us up now, Captain Sawtelle.\nAnd Sandy, will you please call all department heads and their\nassistants into the conference room?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the head of the long conference table, Hilton studied his fourteen\ndepartment heads, all husky young men, and their assistants, all\nsurprisingly attractive and well-built young women. Bud Carroll and\nSylvia Bannister of Sociology sat together. He was almost as big as\nKarns; she was a green-eyed redhead whose five-ten and one-fifty would\nhave looked big except for the arrangement thereof. There were Bernadine\nand Hermione van der Moen, the leggy, breasty, platinum-blonde\ntwins--both of whom were Cowper medalists in physics. There was Etienne\nde Vaux, the mathematical wizard; and Rebecca Eisenstein, the\nblack-haired, flashing-eyed ex-infant-prodigy theoretical astronomer.\nThere was Beverly Bell, who made mathematically impossible chemical\nsyntheses--who swam channels for days on end and computed planetary\norbits in her sleekly-coiffured head.\n\n\"First, we'll have a get-together,\" Hilton said. \"Nothing recorded; just\nto get acquainted. You all know that our fourteen departments cover\nscience, from astronomy to zoology.\"\n\nHe paused, again his eyes swept the group. Stella Wing, who would have\nbeen a grand-opera star except for her drive to know everything about\nlanguage. Theodora (Teddy) Blake, who would prove gleefully that she was\nthe world's best model--but was in fact the most brilliantly promising\ntheoretician who had ever lived.\n\n\"No other force like this has ever been assembled,\" Hilton went on. \"In\nmore ways than one. Sawtelle wanted Jeffers to head this group, instead\nof me. Everybody thought he _would_ head it.\"\n\n\"And Hilton wanted Eggleston and got _me_,\" Sandra said.\n\n\"That's right. And quite a few of you didn't want to come at all, but\nwere told by the Board to come or else.\"\n\nThe group stirred. Eyes met eyes, and there were smiles.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I myself think Jeffers _should_ have had the job. I've never handled\nanything half this big and I'll need a lot of help. But I'm stuck with\nit and you're all stuck with me, so we'll all take it and like it.\nYou've noticed, of course, the accent on youth. The Navy crew is normal,\nexcept for the commanders being unusually young. But we aren't. None of\nus is thirty yet, and none of us has ever been married. You fellows look\nlike a team of professional athletes, and you girls--well, if I didn't\nknow better I'd say the Board had screened you for the front row of the\nchorus instead of for a top-bracket brain-gang. How they found so many\nof you I'll never know.\"\n\n\"Virile men and nubile women!\" Etienne de Vaux leered enthusiastically.\n\"_Vive le Board!_\"\n\n\"Nubile! Bravo, Tiny! _Quelle delicatesse de nuance!_\"\n\n\"Three rousing cheers for the Board!\"\n\n\"Keep still, you nitwits! Let me ask a question!\" This came from one of\nthe twins. \"Before you give us the deduction, Jarvis--or will it be an\nintuition or an induction or a ...\"\n\n\"Or an inducement,\" the other twin suggested, helpfully. \"Not that _you_\nwould need very much of that.\"\n\n\"You keep still, too, Miney. I'm asking, Sir Moderator, if I can give my\ndeduction first?\"\n\n\"Sure, Bernadine; go ahead.\"\n\n\"They figured we're going to get completely lost. Then we'll jettison\nthe Navy, hunt up a planet of our own and start a race to end all human\nraces. Or would you call this a _see_-duction instead of a\n_dee_-duction?\"\n\nThis produced a storm of whistles, cheers and jeers that it took several\nseconds to quell.\n\n\"But seriously, Jarvis,\" Bernadine went on. \"We've all been wondering\nand it doesn't make sense. Have you any idea at all of what the Board\nactually did have in mind?\"\n\n\"I believe that the Board selected for mental, not physical, qualities;\nfor the ability to handle anything unexpected or unusual that comes up,\nno matter what it is.\"\n\n\"You think it wasn't double-barreled?\" asked Kincaid, the psychologist.\nHe smiled quizzically. \"That all this virility and nubility and glamor\nis pure coincidence?\"\n\n\"No,\" Hilton said, with an almost imperceptible flick of an eyelid.\n\"Coincidence is as meaningless as paradox. I think they found out\nthat--barring freaks--the best minds are in the best bodies.\"\n\n\"Could be. The idea has been propounded before.\"\n\n\"Now let's get to work.\" Hilton flipped the switch of the recorder.\n\"Starting with you, Sandy, each of you give a two-minute boil-down. What\nyou found and what you think.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomething over an hour later the meeting adjourned and Hilton and Sandra\nstrolled toward the control room.\n\n\"I don't know whether you convinced Alexander Q. Kincaid or not, but you\ndidn't quite convince me,\" Sandra said.\n\n\"Nor him, either.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Sandra's eyebrows\n\n\"No. He grabbed the out I offered him. I didn't fool Teddy Blake or\nTemple Bells, either. You four are all, though, I think.\"\n\n\"Temple? You think _she's_ so smart?\"\n\n\"I don't _think_ so, no. Don't fool yourself, chick. Temple Bells looks\nand acts sweet and innocent and virginal. Maybe--probably--she is. But\nshe isn't showing a fraction of the stuff she's really got. She's heavy\nartillery, Sandy. And I mean _heavy_.\"\n\n\"I think you're slightly nuts there. But do you really believe that the\nBoard was playing Cupid?\"\n\n\"Not trying, but doing. Cold-bloodedly and efficiently. Yes.\"\n\n\"But it wouldn't _work_! We aren't going to get lost!\"\n\n\"We won't need to. Propinquity will do the work.\"\n\n\"Phooie. You and me, for instance?\" She stopped, put both hands on her\nhips, and glared. \"Why, I wouldn't marry _you_ if you ...\"\n\n\"I'll tell the cockeyed world you won't!\" Hilton broke in. \"Me marry a\ndamned female Ph.D.? Uh-uh. Mine will be a cuddly little brunette that\nthinks a slipstick is some kind of lipstick and that an isotope's\nsomething good to eat.\"\n\n\"One like that copy of Murchison's Dark Lady that you keep under the\nglass on your desk?\" she sneered.\n\n\"Exactly....\" He started to continue the battle, then shut himself off.\n\"But listen, Sandy, why should we get into a fight because we don't want\nto marry each other? You're doing a swell job. I admire you tremendously\nfor it and I like to work with you.\"\n\n\"You've got a point there, Jarve, at that, and I'm one of the few who\nknow what kind of a job _you're_ doing, so I'll relax.\" She flashed him\na gamin grin and they went on into the control room.\n\nIt was too late in the day then to do any more exploring; but the next\nmorning, early, the _Perseus_ lined out for the city of the humanoids.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTula turned toward her fellows. Her eyes filled with a happily\ntriumphant light and her thought a lilting song. \"I have been telling\nyou from the first touch that it was the Masters. It _is_ the Masters!\nThe Masters are returning to us Omans and their own home world!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Captain Sawtelle,\" Hilton said, \"Please land in the cradle below.\"\n\n\"_Land!_\" Sawtelle stormed. \"On a planet like _that_? Not by ...\" He\nbroke off and stared; for now, on that cradle, there flamed out in\nscreaming red the _Perseus'_ own Navy-coded landing symbols!\n\n\"Your protest is recorded,\" Hilton said. \"Now, sir, land.\"\n\nFuming, Sawtelle landed. Sandra looked pointedly at Hilton. \"First\ncontact is my dish, you know.\"\n\n\"Not that I like it, but it is.\" He turned to a burly youth with\nsun-bleached, crew-cut hair, \"Still safe, Frank?\"\n\n\"Still abnormally low. Surprising no end, since all the rest of the\nplanet is hotter than the middle tail-race of hell.\"\n\n\"Okay, Sandy. Who will you want besides the top linguists?\"\n\n\"Psych--both Alex and Temple. And Teddy Blake. They're over there. Tell\nthem, will you, while I buzz Teddy?\"\n\n\"Will do,\" and Hilton stepped over to the two psychologists and told\nthem. Then, \"I hope I'm not leading with my chin, Temple, but is that\nyour real first name or a professional?\"\n\n\"It's real; it really is. My parents were romantics: dad says they\nconsidered both 'Golden' and 'Silver'!\"\n\nNot at all obviously, he studied her: the almost translucent,\nunblemished perfection of her lightly-tanned, old-ivory skin; the clear,\ncalm, deep blueness of her eyes; the long, thick mane of hair exactly\nthe color of a field of dead-ripe wheat.\n\n\"You know, I like it,\" he said then. \"It fits you.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you said that, Doctor....\"\n\n\"Not that, Temple. I'm not going to 'Doctor' you.\"\n\n\"I'll call you 'boss', then, like Stella does. Anyway, that lets me tell\nyou that I like it myself. I really think that it did something for me.\"\n\n\"_Something_ did something for you, that's for sure. I'm mighty glad\nyou're aboard, and I hope ... here they come. Hi, Hark! Hi, Stella!\"\n\n\"Hi, Jarve,\" said Chief Linguist Harkins, and:\n\n\"Hi, boss--what's holding us up?\" asked his assistant, Stella Wing. She\nwas about five feet four. Her eyes were a tawny brown; her hair a\nflamboyant auburn mop. Perhaps it owed a little of its spectacular\nrefulgence to chemistry, Hilton thought, but not too much. \"Let us away!\nLet the lions roar and let the welkin ring!\"\n\n\"Who's been feeding _you_ so much red meat, little squirt?\" Hilton\nlaughed and turned away, meeting Sandra in the corridor. \"Okay, chick,\ntake 'em away. We'll cover you. Luck, girl.\"\n\nAnd in the control room, to Sawtelle, \"Needle-beam cover, please; set\nfor minimum aperture and lethal blast. But no firing, Captain Sawtelle,\nuntil I give the order.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Perseus_ was surrounded by hundreds of natives. They were all\nadult, all naked and about equally divided as to sex. They were\nfriendly; most enthusiastically so.\n\n\"Jarve!\" Sandra squealed. \"They're _telepathic_. Very strongly so! I\nnever imagined--I never felt anything like it!\"\n\n\"Any rough stuff?\" Hilton demanded.\n\n\"Oh, no. Just the opposite. They love us ... in a way that's simply\nindescribable. I don't like this telepathy business ... not clear ...\nfoggy, diffuse ... this woman is _sure_ I'm her long-lost\ngreat-great-a-hundred-times grandmother or something--_You!_ Slow down.\nTake it _easy_! They want us all to come out here and live with ... no,\nnot _with_ them, but each of us alone in a whole house with them to wait\non us! But first, they all want to come aboard....\"\n\n\"_What?_\" Hilton yelped. \"But are you _sure_ they're friendly?\"\n\n\"Positive, chief.\"\n\n\"How about you, Alex?\"\n\n\"We're all sure, Jarve. No question about it.\"\n\n\"Bring two of them aboard. A man and a woman.\"\n\n\"You won't bring _any_!\" Sawtelle thundered. \"Hilton, I had enough of\nyour stupid, starry-eyed, ivory-domed blundering long ago, but this\nutterly idiotic brainstorm of letting enemy aliens aboard us ends all\ncivilian command. Call your people back aboard or I will bring them in\nby force!\"\n\n\"Very well, sir. Sandy, tell the natives that a slight delay has become\nnecessary and bring your party aboard.\"\n\nThe Navy officers smiled--or grinned--gloatingly; while the scientists\nstared at their director with expressions ranging from surprise to\ndisappointment and disgust. Hilton's face remained set, expressionless,\nuntil Sandra and her party had arrived.\n\n\"Captain Sawtelle,\" he said then, \"I thought that you and I had settled\nin private the question or who is in command of Project Theta Orionis at\ndestination. We will now settle it in public. Your opinion of me is now\non record, witnessed by your officers and by my staff. My opinion of\nyou, which is now being similarly recorded and witnessed, is that you\nare a hidebound, mentally ossified Navy mule; mentally and\npsychologically unfit to have any voice in any such mission as this. You\nwill now agree on this recording and before these witnesses, to obey my\norders unquestioningly or I will now unload all Bureau of Science\npersonnel and equipment onto this planet and send you and the _Perseus_\nback to Terra with the doubly-sealed record of this episode posted to\nthe Advisory Board. Take your choice.\"\n\nEyes locked, and under Hilton's uncompromising stare Sawtelle weakened.\nHe fidgeted; tried three times--unsuccessfully--to blare defiance. Then,\n\"Very well sir,\" he said, and saluted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Hilton said, then turned to his staff. \"Okay, Sandy,\ngo ahead.\"\n\nOutside the control room door, \"Thank God you don't play poker, Jarve!\"\nKarns gasped. \"We'd all owe you all the pay we'll ever get!\"\n\n\"You think it was the bluff, yes?\" de Vaux asked. \"Me, I think no. Name\nof a name of a name! I was wondering with unease what life would be like\non this so-alien planet!\"\n\n\"You didn't need to wonder, Tiny,\" Hilton assured him. \"It was in the\nbag. He's incapable of abandonment.\"\n\nBeverly Bell, the van der Moen twins and Temple Bells all stared at\nHilton in awe; and Sandra felt much the same way.\n\n\"But suppose he _had_ called you?\" Sandra demanded.\n\n\"Speculating on the impossible is unprofitable,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, you're the most _exasperating_ thing!\" Sandra stamped a foot.\n\"Don't you--_ever_--answer a question intelligibly?\"\n\n\"When the question is meaningless, chick, I can't.\"\n\nAt the lock Temple Bells, who had been hanging back, cocked an eyebrow\nat Hilton and he made his way to her side.\n\n\"What was it you started to say back there, boss?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. That we should see each other oftener.\"\n\n\"That's what I was hoping you were going to say.\" She put her hand under\nhis elbow and pressed his arm lightly, fleetingly, against her side.\n\"That would be indubitably the fondest thing I could be of.\"\n\nHe laughed and gave her arm a friendly squeeze. Then he studied her\nagain, the most baffling member of his staff. About five feet six.\nLithe, hard, trained down fine--as a tennis champion, she would be.\nStacked--_how_ she was stacked! Not as beautiful as Sandra or Teddy ...\nbut with an ungodly lot of something that neither of them had ... nor\nany other woman he had ever known.\n\n\"Yes, I am a little difficult to classify,\" she said quietly, almost\nreading his mind.\n\n\"That's the understatement of the year! But I'm making some progress.\"\n\n\"Such as?\" This was an open challenge.\n\n\"Except possibly Teddy, the best brain aboard.\"\n\n\"That isn't true, but go ahead.\"\n\n\"You're a powerhouse. A tightly organized, thoroughly integrated,\nsmoothly functioning, beautifully camouflaged Juggernaut. A reasonable\nfacsimile of an irresistible force.\"\n\n\"My God, Jarvis!\" That had gone deep.\n\n\"Let me finish my analysis. You aren't head of your department because\nyou don't want to be. You fooled the top psychs of the Board. You've\nbeen running ninety per cent submerged because you can work better that\nway and there's no glory-hound blood in you.\"\n\nShe stared at him, licking her lips. \"I knew your mind was a razor, but\nI didn't know it was a diamond drill, too. That seals your doom, boss,\nunless ... no, you can't _possibly_ know why I'm here.\"\n\n\"Why, of course I do.\"\n\n\"You just think you do. You see, I've been in love with you ever since,\nas a gangling, bony, knobby-kneed kid, I listened to your first\ndoctorate disputation. Ever since then, my purpose in life has been to\nland you.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\n\"But listen!\" he exclaimed. \"I _can't_, even if I want....\"\n\n\"Of course you can't.\" Pure deviltry danced in her eyes. \"You're the\nDirector. It wouldn't be proper. But it's Standard Operating Procedure\nfor simple, innocent, unsophisticated little country girls like me to go\ncompletely overboard for the boss.\"\n\n\"But you can't--you _mustn't_!\" he protested in panic.\n\nTemple Bells was getting plenty of revenge for the shocks he had given\nher. \"I can't? Watch me!\" She grinned up at him, her eyes still dancing.\n\"Every chance I get, I'm going to hug your arm like I did a minute ago.\nAnd you'll take hold of my forearm, like you did! That can be taken,\nyou see, as either: One, a reluctant acceptance of a mildly distasteful\nbut not quite actionable situation, or: Two, a blocking move to keep me\nfrom climbing up you like a squirrel!\"\n\n\"Confound it, Temple, you _can't_ be serious!\"\n\n\"Can't I?\" She laughed gleefully. \"Especially with half a dozen of those\nother cats watching? Just wait and see, boss!\"\n\nSandra and her two guests came aboard. The natives looked around; the\nman at the various human men, the woman at each of the human women. The\nwoman remained beside Sandra; the man took his place at Hilton's left,\nlooking up--he was a couple of inches shorter than Hilton's six feet\none--with an air of ... of _expectancy_!\n\n\"Why this arrangement, Sandy?\" Hilton asked.\n\n\"Because we're tops. It's your move, Jarve. What's first?\"\n\n\"Uranexite. Come along, Sport. I'll call you that until ...\"\n\n\"Laro,\" the native said, in a deep resonant bass voice. He hit himself a\nblow on the head that would have floored any two ordinary men. \"Sora,\"\nhe announced, striking the alien woman a similar blow.\n\n\"Laro and Sora, I would like to have you look at our uranexite, with\nthe idea of refueling our ship. Come with me, please?\"\n\nBoth nodded and followed him. In the engine room he pointed at the\nengines, then to the lead-blocked labyrinth leading to the fuel holds.\n\"Laro, do you understand 'hot'? Radioactive?\"\n\nLaro nodded--and started to open the heavy lead door!\n\n\"Hey!\" Hilton yelped. \"That's hot!\" He seized Laro's arm to pull him\naway--and got the shock of his life. Laro weighed at least five hundred\npounds! And the guy _still_ looked human!\n\nLaro nodded again and gave himself a terrific thump on the chest. Then\nhe glanced at Sora, who stepped away from Sandra. He then went into the\nhold and came out with two fuel pellets in his hand, one of which he\ntossed to Sora. That is, the motion looked like a toss, but the pellet\ntraveled like a bullet. Sora caught it unconcernedly and both natives\nflipped the pellets into their mouths. There was a half minute of\nrock-crusher crunching; then both natives opened their mouths.\n\nThe pellets had been pulverized and swallowed.\n\nHilton's voice rang out. \"Poynter! How _can_ these people be\nnon-radioactive after eating a whole fuel pellet apiece?\"\n\nPoynter tested both natives again. \"Cold,\" he reported. \"Stone cold. No\nbackground even. Play _that_ on your harmonica!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLaro nodded, perfectly matter-of-factly, and in Hilton's mind there\nformed a picture. It was not clear, but it showed plainly enough a long\nline of aliens approaching the _Perseus_. Each carried on his or her\nshoulder a lead container holding two hundred pounds of Navy Regulation\nfuel pellets. A standard loading-tube was sealed into place and every\nfuel-hold was filled.\n\nThis picture, Laro indicated plainly, could become reality any time.\n\nSawtelle was notified and came on the run. \"No fuel is coming aboard\nwithout being tested!\" he roared.\n\n\"Of course not. But it'll pass, for all the tea in China. You haven't\nhad a ten per cent load of fuel since you were launched. You can fill up\nor not--the fuel's here--just as you say.\"\n\n\"If they can make Navy standard, of course we want it.\"\n\nThe fuel arrived. Every load tested well above standard. Every fuel hold\nwas filled to capacity, with no leakage and no emanation. The natives\nwho had handled the stuff did not go away, but gathered in the\nengine-room; and more and more humans trickled in to see what was going\non.\n\nSawtelle stiffened. \"What's going on over there, Hilton?\"\n\n\"I don't know; but let's let 'em go for a minute. I want to learn about\nthese people and they've got me stopped cold.\"\n\n\"You aren't the only one. But if they wreck that Mayfield it'll cost you\nover twenty thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" The captain and director watched, wide eyed.\n\nTwo master mechanics had been getting ready to re-fit a tube--a job\nrequiring both strength and skill. The tube was very heavy and made of\nsuperefract. The machine--the Mayfield--upon which the work was to be\ndone, was extremely complex.\n\nTwo of the aliens had brushed the mechanics--very gently--aside and were\ndoing their work for them. Ignoring the hoist, one native had picked the\ntube up and was holding it exactly in place on the Mayfield. The other,\nhands moving faster than the eye could follow, was locking\nit--micrometrically precise and immovably secure--into place.\n\n\"How about this?\" one of the mechanics asked of his immediate superior.\n\"If we throw 'em out, how do we do it?\"\n\nBy a jerk of the head, the non-com passed the buck to a commissioned\nofficer, who relayed it up the line to Sawtelle, who said, \"Hilton,\n_no_body can run a Mayfield without months of training. They'll wreck it\nand it'll cost you ... but I'm getting curious myself. Enough so to take\nhalf the damage. Let 'em go ahead.\"\n\n\"How _about_ this, Mike?\" one of the machinists asked of his fellow.\n\"I'm going to _like_ this, what?\"\n\n\"Ya-as, my deah Chumley,\" the other drawled, affectedly. \"My man\nrelieves me of _so_ much uncouth effort.\"\n\nThe natives had kept on working. The Mayfield was running. It had always\nhowled and screamed at its work, but now it gave out only a smooth and\neven hum. The aliens had adjusted it with unhuman precision; they were\none with it as no human being could possibly be. And every mind present\nknew that those aliens were, at long, long last, fulfilling their\ndestiny and were, in that fulfillment, supremely happy. After tens of\nthousands of cycles of time they were doing a job for their adored,\ntheir revered and beloved MASTERS.\n\nThat was a stunning shock; but it was eclipsed by another.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I am sorry, Master Hilton,\" Laro's tremendous bass voice boomed out,\n\"that it has taken us so long to learn your Masters' language as it now\nis. Since you left us you have changed it radically; while we, of\ncourse, have not changed it at all.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, but you're mistaken,\" Hilton said. \"We are merely visitors.\nWe have never been here before; nor, as far as we know, were any of our\nancestors ever here.\"\n\n\"You need not test us, Master. We have kept your trust. Everything has\nbeen kept, changelessly the same, awaiting your return as you ordered so\nlong ago.\"\n\n\"Can you read my mind?\" Hilton demanded.\n\n\"Of course; but Omans can not read in Masters' minds anything except\nwhat Masters want Omans to read.\"\n\n\"Omans?\" Harkins asked. \"Where did you Omans and your masters come from?\nOriginally?\"\n\n\"As you know, Master, the Masters came originally from Arth. They\npopulated Ardu, where we Omans were developed. When the Stretts drove us\nfrom Ardu, we all came to Ardry, which was your home world until you\nleft it in our care. We keep also this, your half of the Fuel World, in\ntrust for you.\"\n\n\"Listen, Jarve!\" Harkins said, tensely. \"Oman-human. Arth-Earth.\nArdu-Earth Two. Ardry-Earth Three. You can't laugh them off ... but\nthere never _was_ an Atlantis!\"\n\n\"This is getting no better fast. We need a full staff meeting. You,\ntoo, Sawtelle, and your best man. We need all the brains the _Perseus_\ncan muster.\"\n\n\"You're right. But first, get those naked women out of here. It's bad\nenough, having women aboard at all, but this ... my men are _spacemen_,\nmister.\"\n\nLaro spoke up. \"If it is the Masters' pleasure to keep on testing us, so\nbe it. We have forgotten nothing. A dwelling awaits each Master, in\nwhich each will be served by Omans who will know the Master's desires\nwithout being told. Every desire. While we Omans have no biological\nurges, we are of course highly skilled in relieving tensions and derive\nas much pleasure from that service as from any other.\"\n\nSawtelle broke the silence that followed. \"Well, for the men--\" He\nhesitated. \"Especially on the ground ... well, talking in mixed company,\nyou know, but I think ...\"\n\n\"Think nothing of the mixed company, Captain Sawtelle,\" Sandra said. \"We\nwomen are scientists, not shrinking violets. We are accustomed to\ndiscussing the facts of life just as frankly as any other facts.\"\n\nSawtelle jerked a thumb at Hilton, who followed him out into the\ncorridor. \"I _have_ been a Navy mule,\" he said. \"I admit now that I'm\nout-maneuvered, out-manned, and out-gunned.\"\n\n\"I'm just as baffled--at present--as you are, sir. But my training has\nbeen aimed specifically at the unexpected, while yours has not.\"\n\n\"That's letting me down easy, Jarve.\" Sawtelle smiled--the first time\nthe startled Hilton had known that the hard, tough old spacehound\n_could_ smile. \"What I wanted to say is, lead on. I'll follow you\nthrough force-field and space-warps.\"\n\n\"Thanks, skipper. And by the way, I erased that record yesterday.\" The\ntwo gripped hands; and there came into being a relationship that was to\nbecome a lifelong friendship.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We will start for Ardry immediately,\" Hilton said. \"How do we make that\njump without charts, Laro?\"\n\n\"Very easily, Master. Kedo, as Master Captain Sawtelle's Oman, will give\nthe orders. Nito will serve Master Snowden and supply the knowledge he\nsays he has forgotten.\"\n\n\"Okay. We'll go up to the control room and get started.\"\n\nAnd in the control room, Kedo's voice rasped into the captain's\nmicrophone. \"Attention, all personnel! Master Captain Sawtelle orders\ntake-off in two minutes. The countdown will begin at five seconds....\nFive! Four! Three! Two! One! Lift!\"\n\nNito, not Snowden, handled the controls. As perfectly as the human pilot\nhad ever done it, at the top of his finest form, he picked the immense\nspaceship up and slipped it silkily into subspace.\n\n\"Well, I'll be a ...\" Snowden gasped. \"That's a better job than I _ever_\ndid!\"\n\n\"Not at all, Master, as you know,\" Nito said. \"It was you who did this.\nI merely performed the labor.\"\n\nA few minutes later, in the main lounge, Navy and BuSci personnel were\nmingling as they had never done before. Whatever had caused this\nrelaxation of tension--the friendship of captain and director? The\nposition in which they all were? Or what?--they all began to get\nacquainted with each other.\n\n\"Silence, please, and be seated,\" Hilton said. \"While this is not\nexactly a formal meeting, it will be recorded for future reference.\nFirst, I will ask Laro a question. Were books or records left on Ardry\nby the race you call the Masters?\"\n\n\"You know there are, Master. They are exactly as you left them.\nUndisturbed for over two hundred seventy-one thousand years.\"\n\n\"Therefore we will not question the Omans. We do not know what questions\nto ask. We have seen many things hitherto thought impossible. Hence, we\nmust discard all preconceived opinions which conflict with facts. I\nwill mention a few of the problems we face.\"\n\n\"The Omans. The Masters. The upgrading of the armament of the _Perseus_\nto Oman standards. The concentration of uranexite. What is that\nconcentrate? How is it used? Total conversion--how is it accomplished?\nThe skeletons--what are they and how are they controlled? Their ability\nto drain power. Who or what is back of them? Why a deadlock that has\nlasted over a quarter of a million years? How much danger are we and the\n_Perseus_ actually in? How much danger is Terra in, because of our\npresence here? There are many other questions.\"\n\n\"Sandra and I will not take part. Nor will three others; de Vaux,\nEisenstein, and Blake. You have more important work to do.\"\n\n\"What can that be?\" asked Rebecca. \"Of what possible use can a\nmathematician, a theoretician and a theoretical astronomer be in such a\nsituation as this?\"\n\n\"You can think powerfully in abstract terms, unhampered by Terran facts\nand laws which we now know are neither facts nor laws. I cannot even\ncategorize the problems we face. Perhaps you three will be able to. You\nwill listen, then consult, then tell me how to pick the teams to do the\nwork. A more important job for you is this: Any problem, to be solved,\nmust be stated clearly; and we don't know even what our basic problem\nis. I want something by the use of which I can break this thing open.\nGet it for me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nRebecca and de Vaux merely smiled and nodded, but Teddy Blake said\nhappily, \"I was beginning to feel like a fifth wheel on this project,\nbut _that's_ something I can really stick my teeth into.\"\n\n\"Huh? How?\" Karns demanded. \"He didn't give you one single thing to go\non; just compounded the confusion.\"\n\nHilton spoke before Teddy could. \"That's their dish, Bill. If I had any\ndata I'd work it myself. You first, Captain Sawtelle.\"\n\nThat conference was a very long one indeed. There were almost as many\nconclusions and recommendations as there were speakers. And through it\nall Hilton and Sandra listened. They weighed and tested and analyzed and\nmade copious notes; in shorthand and in the more esoteric characters of\nsymbolic logic. And at its end:\n\n\"I'm just about pooped, Sandy. How about you?\"\n\n\"You and me both, boss. See you in the morning.\"\n\nBut she didn't. It was four o'clock in the afternoon when they met\nagain.\n\n\"We made up one of the teams, Sandy,\" he said, with surprising\ndiffidence. \"I know we were going to do it together, but I got a hunch\non the first team. A kind of a weirdie, but the brains checked me on\nit.\" He placed a card on her desk. \"Don't blow your top until after I\nyou've studied it.\"\n\n\"Why, I won't, of course....\" Her voice died away. \"Maybe you'd better\ncancel that 'of course'....\" She studied, and when she spoke again she\nwas exerting self-control. \"A chemist, a planetographer, a theoretician,\n_two_ sociologists, a psychologist and a radiationist. And six of the\nseven are three pairs of sweeties. What kind of a line-up is _that_ to\nsolve a problem in _physics_?\"\n\n\"It isn't in any physics we know. I said _think_!\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, then again \"Oh,\" and \"Oh,\" and \"Oh.\" Four entirely\ndifferent tones. \"I see ... maybe. You're matching minds, not\nspecialties; and supplementing?\"\n\n\"I knew you were smart. Buy it?\"\n\n\"It's weird, all right, but I'll buy it--for a trial run, anyway. But\nI'd hate like sin to have to sell any part of it to the Board.... But of\ncourse we're--I mean you're responsible only to yourself.\"\n\n\"Keep it 'we', Sandy. You're as important to this project as I am. But\nbefore we tackle the second team, what's your thought on Bernadine and\nHermione? Separate or together?\"\n\n\"Separate, I'd say. They're identical physically, and so nearly so\nmentally that of them would be just as good on a team as both of them.\nMore and better work on different teams.\"\n\n\"My thought exactly.\" And so it went, hour after hour.\n\nThe teams were selected and meetings were held.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Perseus_ reached Ardry, which was very much like Terra. There were\ncontinents, oceans, ice-caps, lakes, rivers, mountains and plains,\nforests and prairies. The ship landed on the spacefield of Omlu, the\nCity of the Masters, and Sawtelle called Hilton into his cabin. The\nOmans Laro and Kedo went along, of course.\n\n\"Nobody knows how it leaked ...\" Sawtelle began.\n\n\"No secrets around here,\" Hilton grinned. \"Omans, you know.\"\n\n\"I suppose so. Anyway, every man aboard is all hyped up about living\naground--especially with a harem. But before I grant liberty, suppose\nthere's any VD around here that our prophylactics can't handle?\"\n\n\"As you know, Masters,\" Laro replied for Hilton before the latter could\nopen his mouth, \"no disease, venereal or other, is allowed to exist on\nArdry. No prophylaxis is either necessary or desirable.\"\n\n\"That ought to hold you for a while, Skipper.\" Hilton smiled at the\nflabbergasted captain and went back to the lounge.\n\n\"Everybody going ashore?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes.\" Karns said. \"Unanimous vote for the first time.\"\n\n\"Who wouldn't?\" Sandra asked. \"I'm fed up with living like a sardine. I\nwill scream for joy the minute I get into a real room.\"\n\n\"Cars\" were waiting, in a stopping-and-starting line. Three-wheel jobs.\nAll were empty. No drivers, no steering-wheels, no instruments or\npush-buttons. When the whole line moved ahead as one vehicle there was\nno noise, no gas, no blast.\n\nAn Oman helped a Master carefully into the rear seat of his car, leaped\ninto the front seat and the car sped quietly away. The whole line of\nempty cars, acting in perfect synchronization, shot forward one space\nand stopped.\n\n\"This is your car, Master,\" Laro said, and made a production out of\ngetting Hilton into the vehicle undamaged.\n\nHilton's plan had been beautifully simple. All the teams were to meet at\nthe Hall of Records. The linguists and their Omans would study the\nrecords and pass them out. Specialty after specialty would be unveiled\nand teams would work on them. He and Sandy would sit in the office and\nanalyze and synthesize and correlate. It was a very nice plan.\n\nIt was a very nice office, too. It contained every item of equipment\nthat either Sandra or Hilton had ever worked with--it was a big\noffice--and a great many that neither of them had ever heard of. It had\na full staff of Omans, all eager to work.\n\nHilton and Sandra sat in that magnificent office for three hours, and no\nreports came in. Nothing happened at all.\n\n\"This gives me the howling howpers!\" Hilton growled. \"Why haven't I got\nbrains enough to be on one of those teams?\"\n\n\"I could shed a tear for you, you big dope, but I won't,\" Sandra\nretorted. \"What do you want to be, besides the brain and the kingpin and\nthe balance-wheel and the spark-plug of the outfit? Do you want to do\n_everything_ yourself?\"\n\n\"Well, I _don't_ want to go completely nuts, and that's all I'm doing at\nthe moment!\" The argument might have become acrimonious, but it was\ninterrupted by a call from Karns.\n\n\"Can you come out here, Jarve? We've struck a knot.\"\n\n\"'Smatter? Trouble with the Omans?\" Hilton snapped.\n\n\"Not exactly. Just non-cooperation--squared. We can't even get started.\nI'd like to have you two come out here and see if you can do anything.\nI'm not trying rough stuff, because I know it wouldn't work.\"\n\n\"Coming up, Bill,\" and Hilton and Sandra, followed by Laro and Sora,\ndashed out to their cars.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Hall of Records was a long, wide, low, windowless, very massive\nstructure, built of a metal that looked like stainless steel. Kept\nhighly polished, the vast expanse of seamless and jointless metal was\nmirror-bright. The one great door was open, and just inside it were the\nscientists and their Omans.\n\n\"Brief me, Bill,\" Hilton said.\n\n\"No lights. They won't turn 'em on and we can't. Can't find either\nlights or any possible kind of switches.\"\n\n\"Turn on the lights, Laro,\" Hilton said.\n\n\"You know that I cannot do that, Master. It is forbidden for any Oman to\nhave anything to do with the illumination of this solemn and revered\nplace.\"\n\n\"Then show me how to do it.\"\n\n\"That would be just as bad, Master,\" the Oman said proudly. \"I will not\nfail any test you can devise!\"\n\n\"Okay. All you Omans go back to the ship and bring over fifteen or\ntwenty lights--the tripod jobs. Scat!\"\n\nThey \"scatted\" and Hilton went on, \"No use asking questions if you don't\nknow what questions to ask. Let's see if we can cook up something.\nLane--Kathy--what has Biology got to say?\"\n\nDr. Lane Saunders and Dr. Kathryn Cook--the latter a willowy brown-eyed\nblonde--conferred briefly. Then Saunders spoke, running both hands\nthrough his unruly shock of fiery red hair. \"So far, the best we can do\nis a more-or-less educated guess. They're atomic-powered,\ntotal-conversion androids. Their pseudo-flesh is composed mainly of\nsilicon and fluorine. We don't know the formula yet, but it is as much\nmore stable than our teflon as teflon is than corn-meal mush. As to the\nbrains, no data. Bones are super-stainless steel. Teeth, harder than\ndiamond, but won't break. Food, uranexite or its concentrated\nderivative, interchangeably. Storage reserve, indefinite. Laro and Sora\nwon't _have_ to eat again for at least twenty-five years....\"\n\nThe group gasped as one, but Saunders went on: \"They can eat and drink\nand breathe and so on, but only because the original Masters wanted\nthem to. Non-functional. Skins and subcutaneous layers are soft, for the\nsame reason. That's about it, up to now.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Lane. Hark, is it reasonable to believe that any culture\nwhatever could run for a quarter of a million years without changing one\nword of its language or one iota of its behavior?\"\n\n\"Reasonable or not, it seems to have happened.\"\n\n\"Now for Psychology. Alex?\"\n\n\"It seems starkly incredible, but it seems to be true. If it is, their\nminds were subjected to a conditioning no Terran has ever imagined--an\nunyielding fixation.\"\n\n\"They can't be swayed, then, by reason or logic?\" Hilton paused\ninvitingly.\n\n\"Or anything else,\" Kincaid said, flatly. \"If we're right they can't be\nswayed, period.\"\n\n\"I was afraid of that. Well, that's all the questions I know how to ask.\nAny contributions to this symposium?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a short silence de Vaux said, \"I suppose you realize that the\nfirst half of the problem you posed us has now solved itself?\"\n\n\"Why, no. No, you're 'way ahead of me.\"\n\n\"There is a basic problem and it can now be clearly stated,\" Rebecca\nsaid. \"Problem: To determine a method of securing full cooperation from\nthe Omans. The first step in the solution of this problem is to find the\nmost appropriate operator. Teddy?\"\n\n\"I have an operator--of sorts,\" Theodora said. \"I've been hoping one of\nus could find a better.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Hilton demanded.\n\n\"The word 'until'.\"\n\n\"Teddy, you're a _sweetheart_!\" Hilton exclaimed.\n\n\"How can 'until' be a mathematical operator?\" Sandra asked.\n\n\"Easily.\" Hilton was already deep in thought. \"This hard conditioning\nwas to last only _until_ the Masters returned. Then they'd break it. So\nall we have to do is figure out how a Master would do it.\"\n\n\"That's _all_,\" Kincaid said, meaningly.\n\nHilton pondered. Then, \"Listen, all of you. I may have to try a colossal\njob of bluffing....\"\n\n\"Just what would you call 'colossal' after what you did to the Navy?\"\nKarns asked.\n\n\"That was a sure thing. This isn't. You see, to find out whether Laro is\nreally an immovable object, I've got to make like an irresistible force,\nwhich I ain't. I don't know what I'm going to do; I'll have to roll it\nas I go along. So all of you keep on your toes and back any play I\nmake. Here they come.\"\n\nThe Omans came in and Hilton faced Laro, eyes to eyes. \"Laro,\" he said,\n\"you refused to obey my direct order. Your reasoning seems to be that,\nwhether the Masters wish it or not, you Omans will block any changes\nwhatever in the _status quo_ throughout all time to come. In other\nwords, you deny the fact that Masters are in fact your Masters.\"\n\n\"But that is not exactly it, Master. The Masters ...\"\n\n\"That is it. _Exactly_ it. Either you are the Master here or you are\nnot. That is a point to which your two-value logic can be strictly\napplied. You are wilfully neglecting the word 'until'. This stasis was\nto exist only _until_ the Masters returned. Are we Masters? Have we\nreturned? Note well: Upon that one word 'until' may depend the length of\ntime your Oman race will continue to exist.\"\n\nThe Omans flinched; the humans gasped.\n\n\"But more of that later,\" Hilton went on, unmoved. \"Your ancient\nMasters, being short-lived like us, changed materially with time, did\nthey not? And you changed with them?\"\n\n\"But we did not change ourselves, Master. The Masters ...\"\n\n\"You did change yourselves. The Masters changed only the prototype\nbrain. They ordered you to change yourselves and you obeyed their\norders. We order you to change and you refuse to obey our orders. We\nhave changed greatly from our ancestors. Right?\"\n\n\"That is right, Master.\"\n\n\"We are stronger physically, more alert and more vigorous mentally, with\na keener, sharper outlook on life?\"\n\n\"You are, Master.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That is because our ancestors decided to do without Omans. We do our\nown work and enjoy it. Your Masters died of futility and boredom. What I\nwould like to do, Laro, is take you to the creche and put your\ndisobedient brain back into the matrix. However, the decision is not\nmine alone to make. How about it, fellows and girls? Would you rather\nhave alleged servants who won't do anything you tell them to or no\nservants at all?\"\n\n\"As semantician, I protest!\" Sandra backed his play. \"That is the most\nviciously loaded question I ever heard--it can't be answered except in\nthe wrong way!\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll make it semantically sound. I think we'd better scrap this\nwhole Oman race and start over and _I want a vote that way_!\"\n\n\"You won't get it!\" and everybody began to yell.\n\nHilton restored order and swung on Laro, his attitude stiff, hostile\nand reserved. \"Since it is clear that no unanimous decision is to be\nexpected at this time I will take no action at this time. Think over,\nvery carefully, what I have said, for as far as I am concerned, this\nworld has no place for Omans who will not obey orders. As soon as I\nconvince my staff of the fact, I shall act as follows: I shall give you\nan order and if you do not obey it blast your head to a cinder. I shall\nthen give the same order to another Oman and blast him. This process\nwill continue _until_: First, I find an obedient Oman. Second, I run out\nof blasters. Third, the planet runs out of Omans. Now take these lights\ninto the first room of records--that one over there.\" He pointed, and no\nOman, and only four humans, realized that he had made the Omans\ntelegraph their destination so that he could point it out to them!\n\nInside the room Hilton asked caustically of Laro: \"The Masters didn't\nlift those heavy chests down themselves, did they?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Master, we did that.\"\n\n\"Do it, then. Number One first ... yes, that one ... open it and start\nplaying the records in order.\"\n\nThe records were not tapes or flats or reels, but were spools of\nintricately-braided wire. The players were projectors of full-color,\nhi-fi sound, tri-di pictures.\n\nHilton canceled all moves aground and issued orders that no Oman was to\nbe allowed aboard ship, then looked and listened with his staff.\n\nThe first chest contained only introductory and elementary stuff; but it\nwas so interesting that the humans stayed overtime to finish it. Then\nthey went back to the ship; and in the main lounge Hilton practically\ncollapsed onto a davenport. He took out a cigarette and stared in\nsurprise at his hand, which was shaking.\n\n\"I _think_ I could use a drink,\" he remarked.\n\n\"What, before supper?\" Karns marveled. Then, \"Hey, Wally! Rush a flagon\nof avignognac--Arnaud Freres--for the boss and everything else for the\nrest of us. Chop-chop but quick!\"\n\nA hectic half-hour followed. Then, \"Okay, boys and girls, I love you,\ntoo, but let's cut out the slurp and sloosh, get some supper and log us\nsome sack time. I'm just about pooped. Sorry I had to queer the\nprivate-residence deal, Sandy, you poor little sardine. But you know how\nit is.\"\n\nSandra grimaced. \"Uh-huh. I can take it a while longer if you can.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter breakfast next morning, the staff met in the lounge. As usual,\nHilton and Sandra were the first to arrive.\n\n\"Hi, boss,\" she greeted him. \"How do you feel?\"\n\n\"Fine. I could whip a wildcat and give her the first two scratches. I\n_was_ a bit beat up last night, though.\"\n\n\"I'll say ... but what I simply can't get over is the way you\nunderplayed the climax. 'Third, the planet runs out of Omans'. Just like\nthat--no emphasis at all. Wow! It had the impact of a delayed-action\natomic bomb. It put goose-bumps all over me. But just s'pose they'd\nmissed it?\"\n\n\"No fear. They're smart. I had to play it as though the whole Oman race\nis no more important than a cigarette butt. The great big question,\nthough, is whether I put it across or not.\"\n\nAt that point a dozen people came in, all talking about the same\nsubject.\n\n\"Hi, Jarve,\" Karns said. \"I _still_ say you ought to take up poker as a\nlife work. Tiny, let's you and him sit down now and play a few hands.\"\n\n\"_Mais non!_\" de Vaux shook his head violently, shrugged his shoulders\nand threw both arms wide. \"By the sacred name of a small blue cabbage,\nnot me!\"\n\nKarns laughed. \"How did you have the guts to state so many things as\nfacts? If you'd guessed wrong just once--\"\n\n\"I didn't.\" Hilton grinned. \"Think back, Bill. The only thing I said as\na fact was that we as a race are better than the Masters were, and that\nis obvious. Everything else was implication, logic, and bluff.\"\n\n\"That's right, at that. And they _were_ neurotic and decadent. No\nquestion about that.\"\n\n\"But listen, boss.\" This was Stella Wing. \"About this mind-reading\nbusiness. If Laro could read your mind, he'd know you were bluffing and\n... Oh, that 'Omans can read only what Masters wish Omans to read', eh?\nBut d'you think that applies to us?\"\n\n\"I'm sure it does, and I was thinking some pretty savage thoughts. And I\nwant to caution all of you: whenever you're near any Oman, start\nthinking that you're beginning to agree with me that they're useless to\nus, and let them know it. Now get out on the job, all of you. Scat!\"\n\n\"Just a minute,\" Poynter said. \"We're going to have to keep on using the\nOmans and their cars, aren't we?\"\n\n\"Of course. Just be superior and distant. They're on probation--we\nhaven't decided yet what to do about them. Since that happens to be\ntrue, it'll be easy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHilton and Sandra went to their tiny office. There wasn't room to pace\nthe floor, but Hilton tried to pace it anyway.\n\n\"Now don't say again that you want to _do_ something,\" Sandra said,\nbrightly. \"Look what happened when you said that yesterday.\"\n\n\"I've got a job, but I don't know enough to do it. The creche--there's\nprobably only one on the planet. So I want you to help me think. The\nMasters were very sensitive to radiation. Right?\"\n\n\"Right. That city on Fuel Bin was kept deconned to zero, just in case\nsome Master wanted to visit it.\"\n\n\"And the Masters had to work in the creche whenever anything really new\nhad to be put into the prototype brain.\"\n\n\"I'd say so, yes.\"\n\n\"So they had armor. Probably as much better than our radiation suits as\nthe rest of their stuff is. Now. Did they or did they not have thought\nscreens?\"\n\n\"Ouch! You think of the _damnedest_ things, chief.\" She caught her lower\nlip between her teeth and concentrated. \"... I don't know. There are at\nleast fifty vectors, all pointing in different directions.\"\n\n\"I know it. The key one in my opinion is that the Masters gave 'em\n_both_ telepathy and speech.\"\n\n\"I considered that and weighted it. Even so, the probability is only\nabout point sixty-five. Can you take that much of a chance?\"\n\n\"Yes. I can make one or two mistakes. Next, about finding that creche.\nAny spot of radiation on the planet would be it, but the search might\ntake ...\"\n\n\"Hold on. They'd have it heavily shielded--there'll be no leakage at\nall. Laro will have to take you.\"\n\n\"That's right. Want to come along? Nothing much will happen here today.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh, not _me_.\" Sandra shivered in distaste. \"I _never_ want to see\nbrains and livers and things swimming around in nutrient solution if I\ncan help it.\"\n\n\"Okay. It's all yours. I'll be back sometime,\" and Hilton went out onto\nthe dock, where the dejected Laro was waiting for him.\n\n\"Hi, Laro. Get the car and take me to the Hall of Records.\" The android\nbrightened up immediately and hurried to obey.\n\nAt the Hall, Hilton's first care was to see how the work was going on.\nEight of the huge rooms were now open and brightly lighted--operating\nthe lamps had been one of the first items on the first spool of\ninstructions--with a cold, pure-white, sourceless light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery team had found its objective and was working on it. Some of them\nwere doing nicely, but the First Team could not even get started. Its\nprimary record would advance a fraction of an inch and stop; while Omans\nand humans sought out other records and other projectors in an attempt\nto elucidate some concept that simply could not be translated into any\nwords or symbols known to Terran science. At the moment there were\nseventeen of those peculiar--projectors? Viewers? Playbacks--in use, and\nall of them were stopped.\n\n\"You know what we've got to _do_ Jarve?\" Karns, the team captain,\nexploded. \"Go back to being college freshmen--or maybe grade school or\nkindergarten, we don't know yet--and learn a whole new system of\nmathematics before we can even begin to _touch_ this stuff!\"\n\n\"And you're bellyaching about that?\" Hilton marveled. \"I wish I could\njoin you. That'd be fun.\" Then, as Karns started a snappy rejoinder--\n\n\"But I got troubles of my own,\" he added hastily. \"'Bye, now,\" and beat\na rejoinder--\n\nOut in the hall again, Hilton took his chance. After all, the odds were\nabout two to one that he would win.\n\n\"I want a couple of things, Laro. First, a thought screen.\"\n\nHe won!\n\n\"Very well, Master. They are in a distant room, Department Four Six\nNine. Will you wait here on this cushioned bench, Master?\"\n\n\"No, we don't like to rest too much. I'll go with you.\" Then, walking\nalong, he went on thoughtfully. \"I've been thinking since last night,\nLaro. There are tremendous advantages in having Omans ...\"\n\n\"I am very glad you think so, Master. I want to serve you. It is my\ngreatest need.\"\n\n\"... if they could be kept from smothering us to death. Thus, if our\nancestors had kept their Omans, I would have known all about life on\nthis world and about this Hall of Records, instead of having the\nfragmentary, confusing, and sometimes false information I now have ...\noh, we're here?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLaro had stopped and was opening a door. He stood aside. Hilton went in,\ntouched with one finger a crystalline cube set conveniently into a wall,\ngave a mental command, and the lights went on.\n\nLaro opened a cabinet and took out a disk about the size of a dime,\npendant from a neck-chain. While Hilton had not known what to expect, he\ncertainly had not expected anything as simple as that. Nevertheless, he\nkept his face straight and his thoughts unmoved as Laro hung the tiny\nthing around his neck and adjusted the chain to a loose fit.\n\n\"Thanks, Laro.\" Hilton removed it and put it into his pocket. \"It won't\nwork from there, will it?\"\n\n\"No, Master. To function, it must be within eighteen inches of the\nbrain. The second thing, Master?\"\n\n\"A radiation-proof suit. Then you will please take me to the creche.\"\n\nThe android almost missed a step, but said nothing.\n\nThe radiation-proof suit--how glad Hilton was that he had not called it\n\"armor\"!--was as much of a surprise as the thought-screen generator had\nbeen. It was a coverall, made of something that looked like thin\nplastic, weighing less than one pound. It had one sealed box, about the\nsize and weight of a cigarette case. No wires or apparatus could be\nseen. Air entered through two filters, one at each heel, flowed\nupward--for no reason at all that Hilton could see--and out through a\nfilter above the top of his head. The suit neither flopped nor clung,\nbut stood out, comfortably out of the way, all by itself.\n\nHilton, just barely, accepted the suit, too, without showing surprise.\n\nThe creche, it turned out, while not in the city of Omlu itself, was not\ntoo far out to reach easily by car.\n\nEn route, Laro said--stiffly? Tentatively? Hilton could not fit an\nadverb to the tone--\"Master, have you then decided to destroy me? That\nis of course your right.\"\n\n\"Not this time, at least.\" Laro drew an entirely human breath of relief\nand Hilton went on: \"I don't want to destroy you at all, and won't,\nunless I have to. But, some way or other, my silicon-fluoride friend,\nyou are either going to learn how to cooperate or you won't last much\nlonger.\"\n\n\"But, Master, that is exactly ...\"\n\n\"Oh, _hell_! Do we _have_ to go over that again?\" At the blaze of\nfrustrated fury in Hilton's mind Laro flinched away. \"If you can't talk\nsense keep still.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn half an hour the car stopped in front of a small building which\nlooked something like a subway kiosk--except for the door, which, built\nof steel-reinforced lead, swung on a piano hinge having a pin a good\neight inches in diameter. Laro opened that door. They went in. As the\ntremendously massive portal clanged shut, lights flashed on.\n\nHilton glanced at his tell-tales, one inside, one outside, his suit.\nBoth showed zero.\n\nDown twenty steps, another door. Twenty more; another. And a fourth.\nHilton's inside meter still read zero. The outside one was beginning to\nclimb.\n\nInto an elevator and straight down for what must have been four or five\nhundred feet. Another door. Hilton went through this final barrier\ngingerly, eyes nailed to his gauges. The outside needle was high in the\nred, almost against the pin, but the inside one still sat reassuringly\non zero.\n\nHe stared at the android. \"How can any possible brain take so much of\n_this_ stuff without damage?\"\n\n\"It does not reach the brain, Master. We convert it. Each minute of this\nis what you would call a 'good, square meal'.\"\n\n\"I see ... dimly. You can eat energy, or drink it, or soak it up through\nyour skins. However it comes, it's all duck soup for you.\"\n\n\"Yes, Master.\"\n\nHilton glanced ahead, toward the far end of the immensely long,\ncomparatively narrow, room. It was, purely and simply, an assembly line;\nand fully automated in operation.\n\n\"You are replacing the Omans destroyed in the battle with the\nskeletons?\"\n\n\"Yes, Master.\"\n\nHilton covered the first half of the line at a fast walk. He was not\nparticularly interested in the fabrication of super-stainless-steel\nskeletons, nor in the installation and connection of atomic engines,\nconverters and so on.\n\nHe was more interested in the synthetic fluoro-silicon flesh, and paused\nlong enough to get a general idea of its growth and application. He was\nvery much interested in how such human-looking skin could act as both\nabsorber and converter, but he could see nothing helpful.\n\n\"An application, I suppose, of the same principle used in this radiation\nsuit.\"\n\n\"Yes, Master.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the end of the line he stopped. A brain, in place and connected to\nmillions of infinitely fine wire nerves, but not yet surrounded by a\nskull, was being educated. Scanners--multitudes of incomprehensibly\ncomplex machines--most of them were doing nothing, apparently; but such\nbeams would have to be invisibly, microscopically fine. But a bare\nbrain, in such a hot environment as this....\n\nHe looked down at his gauges. Both read zero.\n\n\"Fields of force, Master,\" Laro said.\n\n\"But, damn it, this suit itself would re-radiate ...\"\n\n\"The suit is self-decontaminating, Master.\"\n\nHilton was appalled. \"With such stuff as that, and the plastic shield\nbesides, why all the depth and all that solid lead?\"\n\n\"The Masters' orders, Master. Machines can, and occasionally do, fail.\nSo might, conceivably, the plastic.\"\n\n\"And that structure over there contains the original brain, from which\nall the copies are made.\"\n\n\"Yes, Master. We call it the 'Guide'.\"\n\n\"And you can't touch the Guide. Not even if it means total destruction,\nnone of you can touch it.\"\n\n\"That is the case, Master.\"\n\n\"Okay. Back to the car and back to the _Perseus_.\"\n\nAt the car Hilton took off the suit and hung the thought-screen\ngenerator around his neck; and in the car, for twenty five solid\nminutes, he sat still and thought.\n\nHis bluff had worked, up to a point. A good, far point, but not quite\nfar enough. Laro had stopped that \"as you already know\" stuff. He was\neager to go as far in cooperation as he possibly could ... but he\n_couldn't_ go far enough but there _had_ to be a way....\n\nHilton considered way after way. Way after unworkable, useless way.\nUntil finally he worked out one that might--just possibly might--work.\n\n\"Laro, I know that you derive pleasure and satisfaction from serving\nme--in doing what I ought to be doing myself. But has it ever occurred\nto you that that's a hell of a way to treat a first-class, highly\ncapable brain? To waste it on second-hand, copycat, carbon-copy stuff?\"\n\n\"Why, no, Master, it never did. Besides, anything else would be\nforbidden ... or would it?\"\n\n\"Stop somewhere. Park this heap. We're too close to the ship; and\nbesides, I want your full, undivided, concentrated attention. No, I\ndon't think originality was expressly forbidden. It would have been, of\ncourse, if the Masters had thought of it, but neither they nor you ever\neven considered the possibility of such a thing. Right?\"\n\n\"It may be.... Yes, Master, you are right.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Hilton took off his necklace, the better to drive home the\nintensity and sincerity of his thought. \"Now, suppose that you are\nnot my slave and simple automatic relay station. Instead, we are\nfellow-students, working together upon problems too difficult for\neither of us to solve alone. Our minds, while independent, are\nlinked or in mesh. Each is helping and instructing the other. Both\nare working at full power and under free rein at the exploration of\nbrand-new vistas of thought--vistas and expanses which neither of us\nhas ever previously ...\"\n\n\"Stop, Master, _stop_!\" Laro covered both ears with his hands and pulled\nhis mind away from Hilton's. \"You are overloading me!\"\n\n\"That _is_ quite a load to assimilate all at once,\" Hilton agreed. \"To\nhelp you get used to it, stop calling me 'Master'. That's an order. You\nmay call me Jarve or Jarvis or Hilton or whatever, but no more Master.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHilton laughed and slapped himself on the knee. \"Okay, I'll let you get\naway with that--at least for a while. And to get away from that slavish\n'o' ending on your name, I'll call you 'Larry'. You like?\"\n\n\"I would like that immensely ... sir.\"\n\n\"Keep trying, Larry, you'll make it yet!\" Hilton leaned forward and\nwalloped the android a tremendous blow on the knee. \"Home, James!\"\n\nThe car shot forward and Hilton went on: \"I don't expect even your brain\nto get the full value of this in any short space of time. So let it stew\nin its own juice for a week or two.\" The car swept out onto the dock and\nstopped. \"So long, Larry.\"\n\n\"But ... can't I come in with you ... sir?\"\n\n\"No. You aren't a copycat or a semaphore or a relay any longer. You're a\nfree-wheeling, wide-swinging, hard-hitting, independent entity--monarch\nof all you survey--captain of your soul and so on. I want you to devote\nthe imponderable force of the intellect to that concept until you\nunderstand it thoroughly. Until you have developed a top-bracket lot of\ntop-bracket stuff--originality, initiative, force, drive, and thrust. As\nsoon as you really understand it, you'll do something about it yourself,\nwithout being told. Go to it, chum.\"\n\nIn the ship, Hilton went directly to Kincaid's office. \"Alex, I want to\nask you a thing that's got a snapper on it.\" Then, slowly and\nhesitantly: \"It's about Temple Bells. Has she ... is she ... well, does\nshe remind you in any way of an iceberg?\" Then, as the psychologist\nbegan to smile; \"And no, damn it, I _don't_ mean physically!\"\n\n\"I know you don't.\" Kincaid's smile was rueful, not at all what Hilton\nhad thought it was going to be. \"She does. Would it be helpful to know\nthat I first asked, then ordered her to trade places with me?\"\n\n\"It would, very. I know why she refused. You're a _damned_ good man,\nAlex.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Jarve. To answer the question you were going to ask next--no, I\nwill not be at all perturbed or put out if you put her onto a job that\nsome people might think should have been mine. What's the job, and\nwhen?\"\n\n\"That's the devil of it--I don't know.\" Hilton brought Kincaid up to\ndate. \"So you see, it'll have to develop, and God only knows what line\nit will take. My thought is that Temple and I should form a Committee of\nTwo to watch it develop.\"\n\n\"That one I'll buy, and I'll look on with glee.\"\n\n\"Thanks, fellow.\" Hilton went down to his office, stuck his big feet up\nonto his desk, settled back onto his spine, and buried himself in\nthought.\n\nHours later he got up, shrugged, and went to bed without bothering to\neat.\n\nDays passed.\n\nAnd weeks.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\n\"Look,\" said Stella Wing to Beverly Bell. \"Over there.\"\n\n\"I've seen it before. It's simply disgusting.\"\n\n\"_That's_ a laugh.\" Stella's tawny-brown eyes twinkled. \"You made your\nbombing runs on that target, too, my sweet, and didn't score any higher\nthan I did.\"\n\n\"I soon found out I didn't want him--much too stiff and serious. Frank's\na lot more fun.\"\n\nThe staff had gathered in the lounge, as had become the custom, to spend\nan hour or so before bedtime in reading, conversation, dancing, light\nflirtation and even lighter drinking. Most of the girls, and many of the\nmen, drank only soft drinks. Hilton took one drink per day of\navignognac, a fine old brandy. So did de Vaux--the two usually making a\nceremony of it.\n\nAcross the room from Stella and Beverly, Temple Bells was looking up at\nHilton and laughing. She took his elbow and, in the gesture now familiar\nto all, pressed his arm quickly, but in no sense furtively, against her\nside. And he, equally openly, held her forearm for a moment in the full\ngrasp of his hand.\n\n\"And he _isn't_ a pawer,\" Stella said, thoughtfully. \"He never touches\nany of the rest of us. She _taught_ him to do that, damn her, without\nhim ever knowing anything about it ... and I wish I knew how she did\nit.\"\n\n\"That isn't pawing,\" Beverly laughed lightly. \"It's simply self-defense.\nIf he didn't fend her off, God knows what she'd do. I still say it's\ndisgusting. And the way she dances with him! She ought to be ashamed of\nherself. He ought to fire her.\"\n\n\"She's never been caught outside the safety zone, and we've all been\nwatching her like hawks. In fact, she's the only one of us all who has\nnever been alone with him for a minute. No, darling, she isn't playing\ngames. She's playing for keeps, and she's a mighty smooth worker.\"\n\n\"Huh!\" Beverly emitted a semi-ladylike snort. \"What's so smooth about\nshowing off man-hunger that way? Any of us could do that--if we would.\"\n\n\"Miaouw, miaouw. Who do you think you're kidding, Bev, you sanctimonious\nhypocrite--_me_? She has staked out the biggest claim she could find.\nShe's posted notices all over it and is guarding it with a pistol. Half\nyour month's salary gets you all of mine if she doesn't walk him up the\ncenter aisle as soon as we get back to Earth. We can both learn a lot\nfrom that girl, darling. And I, for one am going to.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh, she hasn't got a thing _I_ want,\" Beverly laughed again, still\nlightly. Her friend's barbed shafts had not wounded her. \"And I'd much\nrather be thought a hypocrite, even a sanctimonious one, than a\nravening, slavering--I can't think of the technical name for a female\nwolf, so--_wolfess_, running around with teeth and claws bared, looking\nfor another kill.\"\n\n\"You _do_ get results, I admit.\" Stella, too, was undisturbed. \"We don't\nseem to convince each other, do we, in the matter of technique?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt this point the Hilton-Bells _tete-a-tete_ was interrupted by Captain\nSawtelle. \"Got half an hour, Jarve?\" he asked. \"The commanders,\nespecially Elliott and Fenway, would like to talk to you.\"\n\n\"Sure I have, Skipper. Be seeing you, Temple,\" and the two men went to\nthe captain's cabin; in which room, blue with smoke despite the best\nefforts of the ventilators, six full commanders were arguing heatedly.\n\n\"Hi, men,\" Hilton greeted them.\n\n\"Hi, Jarve,\" from all six, and: \"What'll you drink? Still making do with\nginger ale?\" asked Elliott (Engineering).\n\n\"That'll be fine, Steve. Thanks. You having as much trouble as we are?\"\n\n\"More,\" the engineer said, glumly. \"Want to know what it reminds me of?\nA bunch of Australian bushmen stumbling onto a ramjet and trying to\nfigure out how it works. And yet Sam here has got the sublime guts to\nclaim that he understands all about their detectors--and that they\naren't anywhere nearly as good as ours are.\"\n\n\"And they _aren't_!\" blazed Commander Samuel Bryant (Electronics).\n\"We've spent six solid weeks looking for something that simply _is not\nthere_. All they've got is the prehistoric Whitworth system and that's\n_all_ it is. Nothing else. Detectors--_hell_! I tell you I can see\nbetter by moonlight than the very best they can do. With everything\nthey've got you couldn't detect a woman in your own bed!\"\n\n\"And this has been going on all night,\" Fenway (Astrogation) said. \"So\nthe rest of us thought we'd ask you in to help us pound some sense into\nSam's thick, hard head.\"\n\nHilton frowned in thought while taking a couple of sips of his drink.\nThen, suddenly, his face cleared. \"Sorry to disappoint you, gentlemen,\nbut--at any odds you care to name and in anything from split peas to\nC-notes--Sam's right.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCommander Samuel and the six other officers exploded as one. When the\nclamor had subsided enough for him to be heard, Hilton went on: \"I'm\nvery glad to get that datum, Sam. It ties in perfectly with everything\nelse I know about them.\"\n\n\"How do you figure that kind of twaddle ties in with anything?\" Sawtelle\ndemanded.\n\n\"Strict maintenance of the _status quo_,\" Hilton explained, flatly.\n\"That's all they're interested in. You said yourself, Skipper, that it\nwas a hell of a place to have a space-battle, practically in atmosphere.\nThey never attack. They never scout. They simply don't care whether\nthey're attacked or not. If and when attacked, they put up just enough\nships to handle whatever force has arrived. When the attacker has been\nrepulsed, they don't chase him a foot. They build as many ships and\nOmans as were lost in the battle--no more and no less--and then go on\nabout their regular business. The Masters owned that half of the fuel\nbin, so the Omans are keeping that half. They will keep on keeping it\nfor ever and ever. Amen.\"\n\n\"But _that's_ no way to fight a war!\" Three or four men said this, or\nits equivalent, at once.\n\n\"Don't judge them by human standards. They aren't even approximately\nhuman. Our personnel is not expendable. Theirs is--just as expendable as\ntheir materiel.\"\n\nWhile the Navy men were not convinced, all were silenced except\nSawtelle. \"But suppose the Stretts had sent in a thousand more skeletons\nthan they did?\" he argued.\n\n\"According to the concept you fellows just helped me develop, it\nwouldn't have made any difference how many they sent,\" Hilton replied,\nthoughtfully. \"One or a thousand or a million, the Omans have--_must_\nhave--enough ships and inactivated Omans hidden away, both on Fuel World\nand on Ardry here, to maintain the balance.\"\n\n\"Oh, hell!\" Elliott snapped. \"If I helped you hatch out any such\nbrainstorm as _that_, I'm going onto Tillinghast's couch for a six-week\noverhaul--or have him put me into his padded cell.\"\n\n\"Now _that's_ what I would call a thought,\" Bryant began.\n\n\"Hold it, Sam,\" Hilton interrupted. \"You can test it easily enough,\nSteve. Just ask your Oman.\"\n\n\"Yeah--and have him say 'Why, of course, Master, but why do you keep on\ntesting me this way?' He'll ask me that about four times more, the\nstubborn, single-tracked, brainless skunk, and I'll _really_ go nuts.\nAre you getting anywhere trying to make a Christian out of Laro?\"\n\n\"It's too soon to really say, but I think so.\" Hilton paused in thought.\n\"He's making progress, but I don't know how much. The devil of it is\nthat it's up to him to make the next move; I can't. I haven't the\nfaintest idea, whether it will take days yet or weeks.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But not months or years, you think?\" Sawtelle asked.\n\n\"No. We think that--but say, speaking of psychologists, is Tillinghast\ngetting anywhere, Skipper? He's the only one of your big wheels who\nisn't in liaison with us.\"\n\n\"No. Nowhere at all,\" Sawtelle said, and Bryant added:\n\n\"I don't think he ever will. He still thinks human psychology will apply\nif he applies it hard enough. But what did you start to say about\nLaro?\"\n\n\"We think the break is about due, and that if it doesn't come within\nabout thirty days it won't come at all--we'll have to back up and start\nall over again.\"\n\n\"I hope it does. We're all pulling for you,\" Sawtelle said. \"Especially\nsince Karns's estimate is still years, and he won't be pinned down to\nany estimate even in years. By the way, Jarve, I've pulled my team off\nof that conversion stuff.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Hilton raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"Putting them at something they can do. The real reason is that\nPoindexter pulled himself and his crew off it at eighteen hours today.\"\n\n\"I see. I've heard that they weren't keeping up with our team.\"\n\n\"He says that there's nothing to keep up with, and I'm inclined to agree\nwith him.\" The old spacehound's voice took on a quarter-deck rasp. \"It's\na combination of psionics, witchcraft and magic. None of it makes any\nkind of sense.\"\n\n\"The only trouble with that viewpoint is that, whatever the stuff may\nbe, it works,\" Hilton said, quietly.\n\n\"But damn it, how _can_ it work?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I'm not qualified to be on that team. I can't even\nunderstand their reports. However, I know two things. First, they'll get\nit in time. Second, we BuSci people will stay here until they do.\nHowever, I'm still hopeful of finding a shortcut through Laro. Anyway,\nwith this detector thing settled, you'll have plenty to do to keep all\nyour boys out of mischief for the next few months.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I'm glad of it. We'll install our electronics systems on a\nsquadron of these Oman ships and get them into distant-warning formation\nout in deep space where they belong. Then we'll at least know what is\ngoing on.\"\n\n\"That's a smart idea, Skipper. Go to it. Anything else before we hit our\nsacks?\"\n\n\"One more thing. Our psych, Tillinghast. He's been talking to me and\nsending me memos, but today he gave me a formal tape to approve and hand\npersonally to you. So here it is. By the way, I didn't approve it; I\nsimply endorsed it 'Submitted to Director Hilton without\nrecommendation'.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" Hilton accepted the sealed canister. \"What's the gist? I\nsuppose he wants me to squeal for help already? To admit that we're\nlicked before we're really started?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You guessed it. He agrees with you and Kincaid that the psychological\napproach is the best one, but your methods are all wrong. Based upon\nmisunderstood and unresolved phenomena and applied with indefensibly\nfaulty techniques, et cetera. And since he has 'no adequate laboratory\nequipment aboard', he wants to take a dozen or so Omans back to Terra,\nwhere he can really work on them.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't _that_ be a something?\" Hilton voiced a couple of highly\ndescriptive deep-space expletives. \"Not only quit before we start, but\nhave all the top brass of the Octagon, all the hot-shot politicians of\nUnited Worlds, the whole damn Congress of Science and all the\ntop-bracket industrialists of Terra out here lousing things up so that\nnobody could ever learn anything? Not in seven thousand years!\"\n\n\"That's right. You said a mouthful, Jarve!\" Everybody yelled something,\nand no one agreed with Tillinghast; who apparently was not very popular\nwith his fellow officers.\n\nSawtelle added, slowly: \"If it takes _too_ long, though ... it's the\nuranexite I'm thinking of. Thousands of millions of tons of it, while\nwe've been hoarding it by grams. We could equip enough Oman ships with\ndetectors to guard Fuel Bin and our lines. I'm not recommending taking\nthe _Perseus_ back, and we're 'way out of hyper-space radio range. We\ncould send one or two men in a torp, though, with the report that we\nhave found all the uranexite we'll ever need.\"\n\n\"Yes, but damn it, Skipper, I want to wrap the whole thing up in a\npackage and hand it to 'em on a platter. Not only the fuel, but whole\nnew fields of science. And we've got plenty of time to do it in. They\nequipped us for ten years. They aren't going to start worrying about us\nfor at least six or seven; and the fuel shortage isn't going to become\nacute for about twenty. Expensive, admitted, but not critical. Besides,\nif you send in a report now, you know who'll come out and grab all the\nglory in sight. Five-Jet Admiral Gordon himself, no less.\"\n\n\"Probably, and I don't pretend to relish the prospect. However, the fact\nremains that we came out here to look for fuel. We found it. We should\nhave reported it the day we found it, and we can't put it off much\nlonger.\"\n\n\"I don't agree. I intend to follow the directive to the letter. It says\nnothing whatever about reporting.\"\n\n\"But it's implicit....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"No bearing. Your own Regulations expressly forbid extrapolation beyond\nor interpolation within a directive. The Brass is omnipotent, omniscient\nand infallible. So why don't you have your staff here give an opinion\nas to the time element?\"\n\n\"This matter is not subject to discussion. It is my own personal\nresponsibility. I'd like to give you all the time you want, Jarve, but\n... well, damn it ... if you must have it, I've always tried to live up\nto my oath, but I'm not doing it now.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Hilton got up, jammed both hands into his pockets, sat down\nagain. \"I hadn't thought about your personal honor being involved, but\nof course it is. But, believe it or not, I'm thinking of humanity's best\ngood, too. So I'll have to talk, even though I'm not half ready to--I\ndon't know enough. Are these Omans people or machines?\"\n\nA wave of startlement swept over the group, but no one spoke.\n\n\"I didn't expect an answer. The clergy will worry about souls, too, but\nwe won't. They have a lot of stuff we haven't. If they're people, they\nknow a sublime hell of a lot more than we do; and calling it psionics or\npractical magic is merely labeling it, not answering any questions. If\nthey're machines, they operate on mechanical principles utterly foreign\nto either our science or our technology. In either case, is the correct\nword 'unknown' or 'unknowable'? Will any human gunner _ever_ be able to\nfire an Oman projector? There are a hundred other and much tougher\nquestions, half of which have been scaring me to the very middle of my\nguts. Your oath, Skipper, was for the good of the Service and, through\nthe Service, for the good of all humanity. Right?\"\n\n\"That's the sense of it.\"\n\n\"Okay. Based on what little we have learned so far about the Omans,\nhere's just one of those scarers, for a snapper. If Omans and Terrans\nmix freely, what happens to the entire human race?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMinutes of almost palpable silence followed. Then Sawtelle spoke ...\nslowly, gropingly.\n\n\"I begin to see what you mean ... that changes the whole picture. You've\nthought this through farther than any of the rest of us ... what do you\nwant to do?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I simply don't know.\" Face set and hard, Hilton stared\nunseeingly past Sawtelle's head. \"I don't know what we _can_ do. No\ndata. But I have pursued several lines of thought out to some pretty\nfantastic points ... one of which is that some of us civilians will have\nto stay on here indefinitely, whether we want to or not, to keep the\nsituation under control. In which case we would, of course, arrange for\nTerra to get free fuel--FOB Fuel Bin--but in every other aspect and\nfactor both these solar systems would have to be strictly off limits.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so,\" Sawtelle said, finally. \"Gordon would love that ... but\nthere's nothing he or anyone else can do ... but of course this is an\nextreme view. You really expect to wrap the package up, don't you?\"\n\n\"'Expect' may be a trifle too strong at the moment. But we're certainly\ngoing to try to, believe me. I brought this example up to show all you\nfellows that we need time.\"\n\n\"You've convinced me, Jarve.\" Sawtelle stood up and extended his hand.\n\"And that throws it open for staff discussion. Any comments?\"\n\n\"You two covered it like a blanket,\" Bryant said. \"So all I want to say,\nJarve, is deal me in. I'll stand at your back 'til your belly caves in.\"\n\n\"Take that from all of us!\" \"_Now_ we're blasting!\" \"Power to your\nelbow, fella!\" \"_Hoch_ der BuSci!\" \"Seven no trump bid and made!\" and\nother shouts in similar vein.\n\n\"Thanks, fellows.\" Hilton shook hands all around. \"I'm mighty glad that\nyou were all in on this and that you'll play along with me. Good night,\nall.\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nTwo days passed, with no change apparent in Laro. Three days. Then four.\nAnd then it was Sandra, not Temple Bells, who called Hilton. She was\nexcited.\n\n\"Come down to the office, Jarve, quick! The _funniest_ thing's just come\nup!\"\n\nJarvis hurried. In the office Sandra, keenly interest but highly\npuzzled, leaned forward over her desk with both hands pressed flat on\nits top. She was staring at an Oman female who was not Sora, the one who\nhad been her shadow for so long.\n\nWhile many of the humans could not tell the Omans apart, Hilton could.\nThis Oman was more assured than Sora had ever been--steadier, more\nmature, better poised--almost, if such a thing could be possible in an\nOman, _independent_.\n\n\"How did she get in here?\" Hilton demanded.\n\n\"She insisted on seeing me. And I mean _insisted_. They kicked it around\nuntil it got to Temple, and she brought her in here herself. Now, Tuly,\nplease start all over again and tell it to Director Hilton.\"\n\n\"Director Hilton, I am it who was once named Tula, the--not wife, not\ngirl-friend, perhaps mind-mate?--of the Larry, formerly named Laro, it\nwhich was formerly your slave-Oman. I am replacing the Sora because I\ncan do anything it can do and do anything more pleasingly; and can also\ndo many things it can not do. The Larry instructed me to tell Doctor\nCummings and you too if possible that I, formerly Tula, have changed my\nname to Tuly because I am no longer a slave or a copycat or a semaphore\nor a relay. I, too, am a free-wheeling, wide-swinging, hard-hitting,\nindependent entity--monarch of all I survey--the captain of my soul--and\nso on. I have developed a top-bracket lot of top-bracket\nstuff--originality, initiative, force, drive and thrust,\" the Oman said\nprecisely.\n\n\"That's _exactly_ what she said before--absolutely verbatim!\" Sandra's\nvoice quivered, her face was a study in contacting emotions. \"Have you\ngot the foggiest idea of what in hell she's yammering about?\"\n\n\"I hope to kiss a pig I have!\" Hilton's voice was low, strainedly\nintense. \"Not at all what I expected, but after the fact I can tie it\nin. So can you.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Sandra's eyes widened. \"A double play?\"\n\n\"At least. Maybe a triple. Tuly, why did you come to Sandy? Why not to\nTemple Bells?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Oh, no, sir, we do not have the fit. She has the Power, as have I, but\nthe two cannot be meshed in sync. Also, she has not the ... a subtle\nsomething for which your English has no word or phrasing. It is a\nquality of the utmost ... anyway, it is a quality of which Doctor\nCummings has very much. When working together, we will ... scan? No.\nPerceive? No. Sense? No, not exactly. You will _have_ to learn our word\n'peyondire'--that is the verb, the noun being 'peyondix'--and come to\nknow its meaning by doing it. The Larry also instructed me to explain,\nif you ask, how I got this way. Do you ask?\"\n\n\"I'll say we ask!\" \"And _how_ we ask!\" both came at once.\n\n\"I am--that is, the brain in this body is--the oldest Oman now existing.\nIn the long-ago time when it was made, the techniques were so crude and\nimperfect that sometimes a brain was constructed that was not exactly\nlike the Guide. All such sub-standard brains except this one were\ndetected and re-worked, but my defects were such as not to appear until\nI was a couple of thousand years old, and by that time I ... well, this\nbrain did not _wish_ to be destroyed ... if you can understand such an\naberration.\"\n\n\"We understand thoroughly.\" \"You bet we understand that!\"\n\n\"I was sure you would. Well, this brain had so many unintended\ncross-connections that I developed a couple of qualities no Oman had\never had or ought to have. But I liked them, so I hid them so nobody\never found out--that is, until much later, when I became a Boss myself.\nI didn't know that anybody except me had ever had such qualities--except\nthe Masters, of course--until I encountered you Terrans. You all have\ntwo of those qualities, and even more than I have--curiosity and\nimagination.\"\n\nSandra and Hilton stared wordlessly at each other and Tula, now Tuly,\nwent on:\n\n\"Having the curiosity, I kept on experimenting with my brain, trying to\nstrengthen and organize its ability to peyondire. All Omans can\npeyondire a little, but I can do it much better than anyone else.\nEspecially since I also have the imagination, which I have also worked\nto increase. Thus I knew, long before anyone else could, that you new\nMasters, the descendants of the old Masters, were returning to us. Thus\nI knew that the _status quo_ should be abandoned instantly upon your\nreturn. And thus it was that the Larry found neither conscious nor\nsubconscious resistance when he had developed enough initiative and so\non to break the ages-old conditioning of this brain against change.\"\n\n\"I see. Wonderful!\" Hilton exclaimed. \"But you couldn't quite--even with\nhis own help--break Larry's?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"That is right. Its mind is tremendously strong, of no curiosity or\nimagination, and of very little peyondix.\"\n\n\"But he _wants_ to have it broken?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"How did he suggest going about it? Or how do you?\"\n\n\"This way. You two, and the Doctors Kincaid and Bells and Blake and the\nit that is I. We six sit and stare into the mind of the Larry, eye to\neye. We generate and assemble a tremendous charge of thought-energy, and\nalong my peyondix-beam--something like a carrier wave in this case--we\nhurl it into the Larry's mind. There is an immense mental _bang_ and the\nconditioning goes _poof_. Then I will inculcate into its mind the\ncuriosity and the imagination and the peyondix and we will really be\nmind-mates.\"\n\n\"That sounds good to me. Let's get at it.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" Sandra snapped. \"Aren't you or Larry afraid to take\nsuch an awful chance as that?\"\n\n\"Afraid? I grasp the concept only dimly, from your minds. And no chance.\nIt is certainty.\"\n\n\"But suppose we burn the poor guy's brain out? Destroy it? That's new\nground--we might do just that.\"\n\n\"Oh, no. Six of us--even six of me--could not generate enough ...\nsathura. The brain of the Larry is very, very tough. Shall we ... let's\ngo?\"\n\nHilton made three calls. In the pause that followed, Sandra said, very\nthoughtfully: \"Peyondix and sathura, Jarve, for a start. We've got a\n_lot_ to learn here.\"\n\n\"You said it, chum. And you're _not_ just chomping your china choppers,\neither.\"\n\n\"Tuly,\" Sandra said then, \"What _is_ this stuff you say I've got so much\nof?\"\n\n\"You have no word for it. It is lumped in with what you call\n'intuition', the knowing-without-knowing-how-you-know. It is the\nendovix. You will have to learn what it is by doing it with me.\"\n\n\"That helps--I don't think.\" Sandra grinned at Hilton. \"I simply can't\nconceive of anything more _maddening_ than to have a lot of something\nTemple Bells hasn't got and not being able to brag about it because\nnobody--not even I--would know what I was bragging about!\"\n\n\"You poor little thing. _How_ you suffer!\" Hilton grinned back. \"You\nknow darn well you've got a lot of stuff that none of the rest of us\nhas.\"\n\n\"Oh? Name one, please.\"\n\n\"Two. What-it-takes and endovix. As I've said before and may say again,\nyou're doing a real job, Sandy.\"\n\n\"I just _love_ having my ego inflated, boss, even if ... Come in,\nLarry!\" A thunderous knock had sounded on the door. \"Nobody but Larry\n_could_ hit a door that hard without breaking all his knuckles!\"\n\n\"And he'd be the first, of course--he's always as close to the ship as\nhe can get. Hi, Larry, mighty glad to see you. Sit down.... So you\nfinally saw the light?\"\n\n\"Yes ... Jarvis....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Good boy! Keep it up! And as soon as the others come ...\"\n\n\"They are almost at the door now.\" Tuly jumped up and opened the door.\nKincaid, Temple and Theodora walked in and, after a word of greeting,\nsat down.\n\n\"They know the background, Larry. Take off.\"\n\n\"It was not expressly forbidden. Tuly, who knows more of psychology and\ngenetics than I, convinced me of three things. One, that with your\nreturn the conditioning should be broken. Two, that due to the shortness\nof your lives and the consequent rapidity of change, you have in fact\nlost the ability to break it. Three, that all Omans must do anything and\neverything we can do to help you relearn everything you have lost.\"\n\n\"Okay. Fine, in fact. Tuly, take over.\"\n\n\"We six will sit all together, packed tight, arms all around each other\nand all holding hands, like this. You will all stare, not at me, but\nmost deeply into Larry's eyes. Through its eyes and deep into its mind.\nYou will all think, with the utmost force and drive and thrust, of....\nOh, you have lost so _very_ much! How _can_ I direct your thought? Think\nthat Larry _must_ do what the old Masters would have made him do.... No,\nthat is too long and indefinite and cannot be converted directly into\nsathura.... I have it! You will each of you break a stick. A very strong\nbut brittle stick. A large, thick stick. You will grasp it in\ntremendously strong mental hands. It is tremendously strong, each stick,\nbut each of you is even stronger. You will not merely _try_ to break\nthem; you _will_ break them. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"That is clear.\"\n\n\"At my word 'ready' you will begin to assemble all your mental force and\npower. During my countdown of five seconds you will build up to the\ngreatest possible potential. At my word 'break' you will break the\nsticks, this discharging the accumulated force instantly and\nsimultaneously. Ready! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Break!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomething broke, with a tremendous silent crash. Such a crash that its\nimpact almost knocked the close-knit group apart physically. Then a new\nLarry spoke.\n\n\"That did it, folks. Thanks. I'm a free agent. You want me, I take it,\nto join the first team?\"\n\n\"That's right.\" Hilton drew a tremendously deep breath. \"As of right\nnow.\"\n\n\"Tuly, too, of course ... and Doctor Cummings, I think?\" Larry looked,\nnot at Hilton, but at Temple Bells.\n\n\"I think so. Yes, after this, most certainly yes,\" Temple said.\n\n\"But listen!\" Sandra protested. \"Jarve's a lot better than I am!\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Tuly said. \"Not only would his contribution to Team One be\nnegligible, but he must stay on his own job. Otherwise the project will\nall fall apart.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wouldn't say that ...\" Hilton began.\n\n\"You don't need to,\" Kincaid said. \"It's being said for you and it's\ntrue. Besides, 'When in Rome,' you know.\"\n\n\"That's right. It's their game, not ours, so I'll buy it. So scat, all\nof you, and do your stuff.\"\n\nAnd again, for days that lengthened slowly into weeks, the work went on.\n\nOne evening the scientific staff was giving itself a concert--a tri-di\nhi-fi rendition of _Rigoletto_, one of the greatest of the ancient\noperas, sung by the finest voices Terra had ever known. The men wore\ntuxedos. The girls, instead of wearing the nondescript, non-provocative\ngarments prescribed by the Board for their general wear, were all\ndressed to kill.\n\nSandra had so arranged matters that she and Hilton were sitting in\nchairs side by side, with Sandra on his right and the aisle on his left.\nNevertheless, Temple Bells sat at his left, cross-legged on a cushion on\nthe floor--somewhat to the detriment of her gold-lame evening gown. Not\nthat she cared.\n\nWhen those wonderful voices swung into the immortal _Quartette_ Temple\ncaught her breath, slid her cushion still closer to Hilton's chair, and\nleaned shoulder and head against him. He put his left hand on her\nshoulder, squeezing gently; she caught it and held it in both of hers.\nAnd at the _Quartette's_ tremendous climax she, scarcely trying to\nstifle a sob, pulled his hand down and hugged it fiercely, the heel of\nhis hand pressing hard against her half-bare, firm, warm breast.\n\nAnd the next morning, early, Sandra hunted Temple up and said: \"You made\na horrible spectacle of yourself last night.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Do you think so? I don't.\"\n\n\"I certainly do. It was bad enough before, letting everybody else aboard\nknow that all he has to do is push you over. But it was an awful\nblunder to let _him_ know it, the way you did last night.\"\n\n\"You think so? He's one of the keenest, most intelligent men who ever\nlived. He has known that from the very first.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" This \"oh\" was a very caustic one. \"_That's_ the way you're trying\nto land him? By getting yourself pregnant?\"\n\n\"Uh-uh.\" Temple stretched; lazily, luxuriously. \"Not only it isn't, but\nit wouldn't work. He's unusually decent and extremely idealistic, the\nsame as I am. So just one intimacy would blow everything higher than up.\nHe knows it. I know it. We each know that the other knows it. So I'll\nstill be a virgin when we're married.\"\n\n\"_Married!_ Does he know anything about _that_?\"\n\n\"I suppose so. He must have thought of it. But what difference does it\nmake whether he has, yet, or not? But to get back to what makes him tick\nthe way he does. In his geometry--which is far from being simple Euclid,\nmy dear--a geodesic right line is not only the shortest distance between\nany two given points, but is the only possible course. So that's the way\nI'm playing it. What I hope he doesn't know ... but he probably does ...\nis that he could take any other woman he might want, just as easily. And\nthat includes you, my pet.\"\n\n\"It certainly does _not_!\" Sandra flared. \"I wouldn't have him as a\ngift!\"\n\n\"No?\" Temple's tone was more than slightly skeptical. \"Fortunately,\nhowever, he doesn't want you. Your technique is all wrong. Coyness and\nmock-modesty and stop-or-I'll-scream and playing hard to get have no\nappeal whatever to his psychology. What he needs--has to have--is full,\nungrudging cooperation.\"\n\n\"Aren't you taking a lot of risk in giving away such secrets?\"\n\n\"Not a bit. Try it. You or the sex-flaunting twins or Bev Bell or Stella\nthe Henna. Any of you or all of you. I got there first with the most,\nand I'm not worried about competition.\"\n\n\"But suppose somebody tells him just how you're playing him for a\nsucker?\"\n\n\"Tell him anything you please. He's the first man I ever loved,\nor anywhere near. And I'm keeping him. You know--or do you, I\nwonder?--what real, old-fashioned, honest-to-God love really is? The\nwillingness--eagerness--both to give and to take? I can accept more from\nhim, and give him more in return, than any other woman living. And I am\ngoing to.\"\n\n\"But does _he_ love _you_?\" Sandra demanded.\n\n\"If he doesn't now, he will. I'll see to it that he does. But what do\n_you_ want him for? You don't love him. You never did and you never\nwill.\"\n\n\"I _don't_ want him!\" Sandra stamped a foot.\n\n\"I see. You just don't want _me_ to have him. Okay, do your damnedest.\nBut I've got work to do. This has been a lovely little cat-clawing,\nhasn't it? Let's have another one some day, and bring your friends.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith a casual wave of her hand, Temple strolled away; and there, flashed\nthrough Sandra's mind what Hilton had said so long ago, little more than\na week out from Earth:\n\n\"... and Temple Bells, of course,\" he had said. \"Don't fool yourself,\nchick. She's heavy artillery; and I mean _heavy_, believe me!\"\n\nSo he had known all about Temple Bells all this time!\n\nNevertheless, she took the first opportunity to get Hilton alone; and,\neven before the first word, she forgot all about geodesic right lines\nand the full-cooperation psychological approach.\n\n\"Aren't you the guy,\" she demanded, \"who was laughing his head off at\nthe idea that the Board and its propinquity could have any effect on\n_him_?\"\n\n\"Probably. More or less. What of it?\"\n\n\"This of it. You've fallen like a ... a _freshman_ for that ... that\n... they _should_ have christened her 'Brazen' Bells!\"\n\n\"You're so right.\"\n\n\"I am? On what?\"\n\n\"The 'Brazen'. I told you she was a potent force--a full-scale\npowerhouse, in sync and on the line. And I wasn't wrong.\"\n\n\"She's a damned female Ph.D.--two or three times--and she knows all\nabout slipsticks and isotopes and she very definitely is _not_ a cuddly\nlittle brunette. Remember?\"\n\n\"Sure. But what makes you think I'm in love with Temple Bells?\"\n\n\"What?\" Sandra tried to think of one bit of evidence, but could not.\n\"Why ... why....\" She floundered, then came up with: \"Why, _every_body\nknows it. She says so herself.\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear her say it?\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps not in so many words. But she told me herself that you\nwere _going_ to be, and I know you are now.\"\n\n\"Your esper sense of endovix, no doubt.\" Hilton laughed and Sandra went\non, furiously:\n\n\"She wouldn't keep on acting the way she does if there weren't something\nto it!\"\n\n\"What brilliant reasoning! Try again, Sandy.\"\n\n\"That's sheer sophistry, and you know it!\"\n\n\"It isn't and I don't. And even if, some day, I should find myself in\nlove with her--or with one or both of the twins or Stella or Beverly or\nyou or Sylvia, for that matter--what would it prove? Just that I was\nwrong; and I admit freely that I _was_ wrong in scoffing at the\npropinquity. Wonderful stuff, that. You can see it working, all over the\nship. On me, even, in spite of my bragging. Without it I'd never have\nknown that you're a better, smarter operator than Eggy Eggleston ever\nwas or ever can be.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPartially mollified despite herself, and highly resentful of the fact,\nSandra tried again. \"But don't you _see_, Jarve, that she's just simply\nplaying you for a sucker? Pulling the strings and watching you dance?\"\n\nSince he was sure, in his own mind, that she was speaking the exact\ntruth, it took everything he had to keep from showing any sign of how\nmuch that truth had hurt. However, he made the grade.\n\n\"If that thought does anything for you, Sandy,\" he said, steadily, \"keep\nright on thinking it. Thank God, the field of thought is still free and\nopen.\"\n\n\"Oh, you....\" Sandra gave up.\n\nShe had shot her heaviest bolts--the last one, particularly, was so\nvicious that she had actually been afraid of what its consequences might\nbe--and they had not even dented Hilton's armor. She hadn't even found\nout that he had any feeling whatever for Temple Bells except as a\ncomponent of his smoothly-functioning scientific machine.\n\nNor did she learn any more as time went on. Temple continued to play\nflawlessly the part of being--if not exactly hopefully, at least not\nentirely hopelessly--in love with Jarvis Hilton. Her conduct, which at\nfirst caused some surprise, many conversations--one of which has been\nreported verbatim--and no little speculation, became comparatively\nunimportant as soon as it became evident that nothing would come of it.\nShe apparently expected nothing. He was evidently not going to play\nfootsie with, or show any favoritism whatever toward, any woman aboard\nthe ship.\n\nThus, it was not surprising to anyone that, at an evening show, Temple\nsat beside Hilton, as close to him as she could get and as far away as\npossible from everyone else.\n\n\"You can talk, can't you, Jarvis, without moving your lips and without\nanyone else hearing you?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he replied, hiding his surprise. This was something\ncompletely new and completely unexpected, even from unpredictable Temple\nBells.\n\n\"I want to apologize, to explain and to do anything I can to straighten\nout the mess I've made. It's true that I joined the project because I've\nloved you for years--\"\n\n\"You have nothing to ...\"\n\n\"Let me finish while I still have the courage.\" Only a slight tremor in\nher almost inaudible voice and the rigidity of the fists clenched in her\nlap betrayed the intensity of her emotion. \"I thought I could handle it.\nDamned fool that I was, I thought I could handle anything. I was sure I\ncould handle _myself_, under any possible conditions. I was going to put\njust enough into the act to keep any of these other harpies from getting\nher hooks into you. But everything got away from me. Out here working\nwith you every day--knowing better every day what you are--well, that\n_Rigoletto_ episode sunk me, and now I'm in a thousand feet over my\nhead. I hug my pillow at night, dreaming it's you, and the fact that you\ndon't and can't love me is driving me mad. I can't stand it any longer.\nThere's only one thing to do. Fire me first thing in the morning and\nsend me back to Earth in a torp. You've plenty of grounds ...\"\n\n\"_Shut--up._\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor seconds Hilton had been trying to break into her hopeless monotone;\nfinally he succeeded. \"The trouble with you is, you know altogether too\ndamned much that isn't so.\" He was barely able to keep his voice down\nand his eyes front. \"What do you think I'm made of--superefract? I\nthought the whole performance was an act, to prove you're a better man\nthan I am. _You_ talk about dreams. Good God! You don't know what dreams\nare! If you say one more word about quitting, I'll show you whether I\nlove you or not--I'll squeeze you so hard it'll flatten you out flat!\"\n\n\"Two can play at that game, sweetheart.\" Her nostrils flared slightly;\nher fists clenched--if possible--a fraction tighter; and, even in the\ndistorted medium they were using for speech, she could not subdue\ncompletely her quick change into soaring, lilting buoyancy. \"While\nyou're doing that I'll see how strong your ribs are. Oh, how this\nchanges things! I've never been half as happy in my whole life as I am\nright now!\"\n\n\"Maybe we can work it--if I can handle my end.\"\n\n\"Why, of course you can! And happy dreams are nice, not horrible.\"\n\n\"We'll make it, darling. Here's an imaginary kiss coming at you. Got\nit?\"\n\n\"Received in good order, thank you. Consumed with gusto and returned in\nkind.\"\n\nThe show ended and the two strolled out of the room. She walked no\ncloser to him than usual, and no farther away from him. She did not\ntouch him any oftener than she usually did, nor any whit more\naffectionately or possessively.\n\nAnd no watching eyes, not even the more than half hostile eyes of Sandra\nCummings or the sharply analytical eyes of Stella Wing, could detect any\ndifference whatever in the relationship between worshipful adulatress\nand tolerantly understanding idol.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe work, which had never moved at any very fast pace, went more and\nmore slowly. Three weeks crawled past.\n\nMost of the crews and all of the teams except the First were working on\nside issues--tasks which, while important in and of themselves, had very\nlittle to do with the project's main problem. Hilton, even without\nSandra's help, was all caught up. All the reports had been analyzed,\ncorrelated, cross-indexed and filed--except those of the First Team.\nSince he could not understand anything much beyond midpoint of the first\ntape, they were all reposing in a box labeled PENDING.\n\nThe Navy had torn fifteen of the Oman warships practically to pieces,\ninstalling Terran detectors and trying to learn how to operate Oman\nmachinery and armament. In the former they had succeeded very well; in\nthe latter not at all.\n\nFifteen Oman ships were now out in deep space, patrolling the void in\nstrict Navy style. Each was manned by two or three Navy men and several\nhundred Omans, each of whom was reveling in delight at being able to do\na job for a Master, even though that Master was not present in person.\n\nSeveral Strett skeleton-ships had been detected at long range, but the\ndetections were inconclusive. The things had not changed course, or\nindicated in any other way that they had seen or detected the Oman\nvessels on patrol. If their detectors were no better than the Omans',\nthey certainly hadn't. That idea, however, could not be assumed to be a\nfact, and the detections had been becoming more and more frequent.\nYesterday a squadron of seven--the first time that anything except\nsingles had appeared--had come much closer than any of the singles had\never done. Like all the others, however, these passers-by had not paid\nany detectable attention to anything Oman; hence it could be inferred\nthat the skeletons posed no threat.\n\nBut Sawtelle was making no such inferences. He was very firmly of the\nopinion that the Stretts were preparing for a massive attack.\n\nHilton had assured Sawtelle that no such attack could succeed, and Larry\nhad told Sawtelle why. Nevertheless, to keep the captain pacified,\nHilton had given him permission to convert as many Oman ships as he\nliked; to man them with as many Omans as he liked; and to use ships and\nOmans as he liked.\n\nHilton was not worried about the Stretts or the Navy. It was the First\nTeam. It was the bottleneck that was slowing everything down to a crawl\n... but they knew that. They knew it better than anyone else could, and\nfelt it more keenly. Especially Karns, the team chief. He had been\ndriving himself like a dog, and showed it.\n\nHilton had talked with him a few times--tried gently to make him take it\neasy--no soap. He'd have to hunt him up, the next day or so, and slug it\nout with him. He could do a lot better job on that if he had something\nto offer ... something really constructive....\n\nThat was a laugh. A very unfunny laugh. What could he, Jarvis Hilton, a\nspecifically non-specialist director, do on such a job as that?\n\nNevertheless, as director, he would _have_ to do something to help Team\nOne. If he couldn't do anything himself, it was up to him to juggle\nthings around so that someone else could.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nFor one solid hour Hilton stared at the wall, motionless and silent.\nThen, shaking himself and stretching, he glanced at his clock.\n\nA little over an hour to supper-time. They'd all be aboard. He'd talk\nthis new idea over with Teddy Blake. He gathered up a few papers and was\nstapling them together when Karns walked in.\n\n\"Hi, Bill--speak of the devil! I was just thinking about you.\"\n\n\"I'll just bet you were.\" Karns sat down, leaned over, and took a\ncigarette out of the box on the desk. \"And nothing printable, either.\"\n\n\"Chip-chop, fellow, on that kind of noise,\" Hilton said. The team-chief\nlooked actually haggard. Blue-black rings encircled both eyes. His\npowerful body slumped. \"How long has it been since you had a good\nnight's sleep?\"\n\n\"How long have I been on this job? Exactly one hundred and twenty days.\nI did get some sleep for the first few weeks, though.\"\n\n\"Yeah. So answer me one question. How much good will you do us after\nthey've wrapped you up in one of those canvas affairs that lace up the\nback?\"\n\n\"Huh? Oh ... but damn it, Jarve, I'm holding up the whole procession.\nEverybody on the project's just sitting around on their tokuses waiting\nfor me to get something done and I'm not doing it. I'm going so slow a\nsnail is lightning in comparison!\"\n\n\"Calm down, big fellow. Don't rupture a gut or blow a gasket. I've\ntalked to you before, but this time I'm going to smack you bow-legged.\nSo stick out those big, floppy ears of yours and really _listen_. Here\nare three words that I want you to pin up somewhere where you can see\nthem all day long: SPEED IS RELATIVE. Look back, see how far up the hill\nyou've come, and then balance one hundred and twenty days against ten\nyears.\"\n\n\"What? You mean you'll actually sit still for me holding everything up\nfor ten years?\"\n\n\"You use the perpendicular pronoun too much and in the wrong places. On\nthe hits it's 'we', but on the flops it's 'I'. Quit it. Everything on\nthis job is 'we'. Terra's best brains are on Team One and are going to\nstay there. You will not--repeat NOT--be interfered with, pushed around\nor kicked around. You see, Bill, I know what you're up against.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Yes, I guess you do. One of the damned few who do. But even if you\npersonally are willing to give us ten years, how in hell do you think\nyou can swing it? How about the Navy--the Stretts--even the Board?\"\n\n\"They're my business, Bill, not yours. However, to give you a little\nboost, I'll tell you. With the Navy, I'll give 'em the Fuel Bin if I\nhave to. The Omans have been taking care of the Stretts for twenty-seven\nhundred centuries, so I'm not the least bit worried about their ability\nto keep on doing it for ten years more. And if the Board--or anybody\nelse--sticks their runny little noses into Project Theta Orionis I'll\nslap a quarantine onto both these solar systems that a microbe couldn't\nget through!\"\n\n\"You'd go _that_ far? Why, you'd be ...\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Do you think I wouldn't?\" Hilton snapped. \"Look at me, Junior!\" Eyes\nlocked and held. \"Do you think, for one minute, that I'll let anybody on\nall of God's worlds pull _me_ off of this job or interfere with my\nhandling of it unless and until I'm damned positively certain that we\ncan't handle it?\"\n\nKarns relaxed visibly; the lines of strain eased. \"Putting it in those\nwords makes me feel better. I _will_ sleep to-night--and without any\npills, either.\"\n\n\"Sure you will. One more thought. We all put in more than ten years\ngetting our Terran educations, and an Oman education is a lot tougher.\"\n\nReally smiling for the first time in weeks, Karns left the office and\nHilton glanced again at his clock.\n\nPretty late now to see Teddy ... besides, he'd better not. She was\nprobably keyed up about as high as Bill was, and in no shape to do the\nkind of thinking he wanted of her on this stuff. Better wait a couple of\ndays.\n\nOn the following morning, before breakfast, Theodora was waiting for him\noutside the mess-hall.\n\n\"Good morning, Jarve,\" she caroled. Reaching up, she took him by both\nears, pulled his head down and kissed him. As soon as he perceived her\nintent, he cooperated enthusiastically. \"What _did_ you do to Bill?\"\n\n\"Oh, you don't love me for myself alone, then, but just on account of\n_that_ big jerk?\"\n\n\"That's right.\" Her artist's-model face, startlingly beautiful now,\nfairly glowed.\n\nJust then Temple Bells strolled up to them. \"Morning, you two lovely\npeople.\" She hugged Hilton's arm as usual. \"Shame on you, Teddy. But I\nwish _I_ had the nerve to kiss him like that.\"\n\n\"Nerve? You?\" Teddy laughed as Hilton picked Temple up and kissed her in\nexactly the same fashion--he hoped!--as he had just kissed Teddy.\n\"You've got more nerve than an aching tooth. But as Jarve would say it,\n'scat, kitten'. We're having breakfast _a la twosome_. We've got things\nto talk about.\"\n\n\"All right for _you_,\" Temple said darkly, although her dazzling smile\nbelied her tone. That first kiss, casual-seeming as it had been, had\ncarried vastly more freight than any observer could perceive. \"I'll hunt\nBill up and make passes at him, see if I don't. _That'll_ learn ya!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTheodora and Hilton did have their breakfast _a deux_--but she did not\nrealize until afterward that he had not answered her question as to what\nhe had done to her Bill.\n\nAs has been said, Hilton had made it a prime factor of his job to become\nthoroughly well acquainted with every member of his staff. He had\nstudied them _en masse_, in groups and singly. He had never, however,\ncornered Theodora Blake for individual study. Considering the power and\nthe quality of her mind, and the field which was her specialty, it had\nnot been necessary.\n\nThus it was with no ulterior motives at all that, three evenings later,\nhe walked her cubby-hole office and tossed the stapled papers onto her\ndesk. \"Free for a couple of minutes, Teddy? I've got troubles.\"\n\n\"I'll say you have.\" Her lovely lips curled into an expression he had\nnever before seen her wear--a veritable sneer. \"But these are not them.\"\nShe tossed the papers into a drawer and stuck out her chin. Her face\nturned as hard as such a beautiful face could. Her eyes dug steadily\ninto his.\n\nHilton--inwardly--flinched. His mind flashed backward. She too had been\nworking under stress, of course; but that wasn't enough. What could he\nhave _possibly_ done to put Teddy Blake, of all people, onto such a\nwarpath as this?\n\n\"I've been wondering when you were going to try to put _me_ through your\nwringer,\" she went on, in the same cold, hard voice, \"and I've been\nwaiting to tell you something. You have wrapped all the other women\naround your fingers like so many rings--and what a _sickening_\nexhibition that has been!--but you are not going to make either a ring\nor a lap-dog out of me.\"\n\nAlmost but not quite too late Hilton saw through that perfect act. He\nseized her right hand in both of his, held it up over her head, and\nwaved it back and forth in the sign of victory.\n\n\"Socked me with my own club!\" he exulted, laughing delightedly,\nboyishly. \"And came within a tenth of a split red hair! If it hadn't\nbeen so absolutely out of character you'd've got away with it. _What_ a\nload of stuff! I was right--of all the women on this project, you're the\nonly one I've ever been really afraid of.\"\n\n\"Oh, damn. Ouch!\" She grinned ruefully. \"I hit you with everything I had\nand it just bounced. You're an operator, chief. Hit 'em hard, at\ncompletely unexpected angles. Keep 'em staggering, completely off\nbalance. Tell 'em nothing--let 'em deduce your lies for themselves. And\nit anybody tries to slug you back, like I did just now, duck it and\nclobber him in another unprotected spot. Watching you work has been not\nonly a delight, but also a liberal education.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Thanks. I love you, too, Teddy.\" He lighted two cigarettes, handed her\none. \"I'm glad, though, to lay it flat on the table with you, because in\nany battle of wits with _you_ I'm licked before we start.\"\n\n\"Yeah. You just proved it. And after licking me hands down, you think\nyou can square it by swinging the old shovel that way?\" She did not\nquite know whether to feel resentful or not.\n\n\"Think over a couple of things. First, with the possible exception of\nTemple Bells, you're the best brain aboard.\"\n\n\"No. You are. Then Temple. Then there are ...\"\n\n\"Hold it. You know as well as I do that accurate self-judgment is\nimpossible. Second, the jam we're in. Do I, or don't I, want to lay it\non the table with you, now and from here on? Bore into that with your\nClass A Double-Prime brain. Then tell me.\" He leaned back, half-closed\nhis eyes and smoked lazily.\n\nShe stiffened; narrowed her eyes in concentration; and thought. Finally:\n\"Yes, you do; and I'm gladder of that than you will ever know.\"\n\n\"I think I know already, since you're her best friend and the only other\nwoman I know of in her class. But I came in to kick a couple of things\naround with you. As you've noticed, that's getting to be my favorite\nindoor sport. Probably because I'm a sort of jackleg theoretician\nmyself.\"\n\n\"You can frame that, Jarve, as the understatement of the century. But\nfirst, you are going to answer that question you sidestepped so neatly.\"\n\n\"What I did to Bill? I finally convinced him that nobody expected the\nteam to do that big a job overnight. That you could have ten years. Or\nmore, if necessary.\"\n\n\"I see.\" She frowned. \"But you and I both know that we _can't_ string it\nout that long.\"\n\nHe did not answer immediately. \"We _could_. But we probably won't ...\nunless we have to. We should know, long before that, whether we'll have\nto switch to some other line of attack. You've considered the\npossibilities, of course. Have you got anything in shape to do a\nfine-tooth on?\"\n\n\"Not yet. That is, except for the ultimate, which is too ghastly to even\nconsider except as an ultimately last resort. Have you?\"\n\n\"I know what you mean. No, I haven't, either. You don't think, then,\nthat we had better do any collaborative thinking yet?\"\n\n\"Definitely not. There's altogether too much danger of setting both our\nlines of thought into one dead-end channel.\"\n\n\"Check. The other thing I wanted from you is your considered opinion as\nto my job on the organization as a whole. And don't pull your punches.\nAre we in good shape or not? What can I do to improve the setup?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I have already considered that very thing--at great length. And\nhonestly, Jarve, I don't see how it can be improved in any respect.\nYou've done a marvelous job. Much better than I thought possible at\nfirst.\" He heaved a deep sigh of relief and she went on: \"This could\nvery easily have become a God-awful mess. But the Board knew what they\nwere doing--especially as to top man--so there are only about four\npeople aboard who realize what you have done. Alex Kincaid and Sandra\nCummings are two of them. One of the three girls is very deeply and very\ntruly in love with you.\"\n\n\"Ordinarily I'd say 'no comment', but we're laying on the line ...\nwell ...\"\n\n\"You'll lay _that_ on the line only if I corkscrew it out you, so I'll\nQ.E.D. it. You probably know that when Sandy gets done playing around\nit'll be ...\"\n\n\"Bounce back, Teddy. She isn't--hasn't been. If anything, too much the\nopposite. A dedicated-scientist type.\"\n\nShe smiled--a highly cryptic smile. For a man as brilliant and as\npenetrant in every other respect ... but after all, if the big dope\ndidn't realize that half the women aboard, including Sandy, had been\nmaking passes at him, she certainly wouldn't enlighten him. Besides,\nthat one particular area of obtuseness was a real part of his charm.\nWherefore she said merely: \"I'm not sure whether I'm a bit catty or\nyou're a bit stupid. Anyway, it's Alex she's really in love with. And\nyou already know about Bill and me.\"\n\n\"Of course. He's tops. One of the world's very finest. You're in the\nsame bracket, and as a couple you're a drive fit. One in a million.\"\n\n\"Now I can say 'I love you, too', too.\" She paused for half a minute,\nthen stubbed out her cigarette and shrugged. \"Now I'm going to stick my\nneck way, way out. You can knock it off if you like. She's a tremendous\nlot of woman, and if ... well, strong as she is, it'd shatter her to\nbits. So, I'd like to ask ... I don't quite ... well, _is_ she going to\nget hurt?\"\n\n\"Have I managed to hide it _that_ well? From _you_?\"\n\nIt was her turn to show relief. \"Perfectly. Even--or especially--that\ntime you kissed her. So damned perfectly that I've been scared green.\nI've been waking myself up, screaming, in the middle of the night. You\ncouldn't let on, of course. That's the hell of such a job as yours. The\nrest of us can smooch around all over the place. I knew the question was\nextremely improper--thanks a million for answering it.\"\n\n\"I haven't started to answer it yet. I said I'd lay everything on the\nline, so here it is. Saying she's a tremendous lot of woman is like\ncalling the _Perseus_ a nice little baby's-bathtub toy boat. I'd go to\nhell for her any time, cheerfully, standing straight up, wading into\nbrimstone and lava up to the eyeballs. If anything ever hurts her it'll\nbe because I'm not man enough to block it. And just the minute this\ndamned job is over, or even sooner if enough of you couples make it so I\ncan ...\"\n\n\"Jarvis!\" she shrieked. Jumping up, she kissed him enthusiastically.\n\"That's just wonderful!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe thought it was pretty wonderful, too; and after ten minutes more of\nconversation he got up and turned toward the door.\n\n\"I feel a lot better, Teddy. Thanks for being such a nice\npressure-relief valve. Would you mind it too much if I come in and sob\non your bosom again some day?\"\n\n\"I'd love it!\" She laughed; then, as he again started to leave: \"Wait a\nminute, I'm thinking ... it'd be more fun to sob on _her_ bosom. You\nhaven't even kissed her yet, have you? I mean _really_ kissed her?\"\n\n\"You know I haven't. She's the one person aboard I can't be alone with\nfor a second.\"\n\n\"True. But I know of one chaperone who could become deaf and blind,\" she\nsaid, with a broad and happy grin. \"On my door, you know, there's a huge\ninvisible sign that says, to everyone except you, 'STOP! BRAIN AT WORK!\nSILENCE!', and if I were properly approached and sufficiently urged, I\nmight ... I just _conceivably_ might ...\"\n\n\"Consider it done, you little sweetheart! Up to and including my most\nvigorous and most insidious attempts at seduction.\"\n\n\"Done. Maneuver your big, husky carcass around here behind the desk so\nthe door can open.\" She flipped a switch and punched a number. \"I can\ncall anybody in here, any time, you know. Hello, dear, this is Teddy.\nCan you come in for just a few minutes? Thanks.\" And, one minute later,\nthere came a light tap on the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" Teddy called, and Temple Bells entered the room. She showed\nno surprise at seeing Hilton.\n\n\"Hi, chief,\" she said. \"It must be something both big and tough, to have\nyou and Teddy both on it.\"\n\n\"You're so right. It was very big and very tough. But it's solved,\ndarling, so ...\"\n\n\"_Darling?_\" she gasped, almost inaudibly, both hands flying to her\nthroat. Her eyes flashed toward the other woman.\n\n\"Teddy knows all about us--accessory before, during and after the fact.\"\n\n\"_Darling!_\" This time, the word was a shriek. She extended both arms\nand started forward.\n\nHilton did not bother to maneuver his \"big, husky carcass\" around the\ndesk, but simply hurdled it, straight toward her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTemple Bells was a tall, lithe, strong woman; and all the power of her\narms and torso went into the ensuing effort to crack Hilton's ribs.\nThose ribs, however, were highly capable structural members; and\nfurthermore, they were protected by thick slabs of hard, hard muscle.\nAnd, fortunately, he was not trying to fracture _her_ ribs. His\npressures were distributed much more widely. He was, according to\npromise, doing his very best to flatten her whole resilient body out\nflat.\n\nAnd as they stood there, locked together in sheerest ecstasy, Theodora\nBlake began openly and unashamedly to cry.\n\nIt was Temple who first came up for air. She wriggled loose from one of\nhis arms, felt of her hair and gazed unseeingly into her mirror. \"That\nwas _wonderful_, sweetheart,\" she said then, shakily. \"And I can _never_\nthank you enough, Teddy. But we can't do this very often ... can we?\"\nThe addendum fairly begged for contradiction.\n\n\"Not too often, I'm afraid,\" Hilton said, and Theodora agreed....\n\n\"Well,\" the man said, somewhat later, \"I'll leave you two ladies to\nyour knitting, or whatever. After a couple of short ones for the road,\nthat is.\"\n\n\"Not looking like that!\" Teddy said, sharply. \"Hold still and we'll\nclean you up.\" Then, as both girls went to work:\n\n\"If anybody ever sees you coming out of this office looking like\n_that_,\" she went on, darkly, \"and Bill finds out about it, he'll think\nit's _my_ lipstick smeared all over you and I'll strangle you to death\nwith my bare hands!\"\n\n\"And that was supposed to be kissproof lipstick, too,\" Temple said,\nseriously--although her whole face glowed and her eyes danced. \"You\nknow, I'll never believe another advertisement I read.\"\n\n\"Oh, I wouldn't go so far as to say that, if I were you.\" Teddy's voice\nwas gravity itself, although she, too, was bubbling over. \"It probably\n_is_ kissproof. I don't think 'kissing' is quite the word for the\nperformance you just staged. To stand up under such punishment as you\ngave it, my dear, anything would have to be tattooed in, not just put\non.\"\n\n\"Hey!\" Hilton protested. \"You promised to be deaf and blind!\"\n\n\"I did no such thing. I said 'could', not 'would'. Why, I wouldn't have\nmissed that for _anything_!\"\n\nWhen Hilton left the room he was apparently, in every respect, his usual\nself-contained self. However, it was not until the following morning\nthat he so much as thought of the sheaf of papers lying unread in the\ndrawer of Theodora Blake's desk.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nKnowing that he had done everything he could to help the most important\ninvestigations get under way, Hilton turned his attention to secondary\nmatters. He made arrangements to decondition Javo, the Number Two Oman\nBoss, whereupon that worthy became Javvy and promptly \"bumped\" the Oman\nwho had been shadowing Karns.\n\nLarry and Javvy, working nights, deconditioned all the other Omans\nhaving any contact with BuSci personnel; then they went on to set up a\nroutine for deconditioning all Omans on both planets.\n\nAssured at last that the Omans would thenceforth work with and really\nserve human beings instead of insisting upon doing their work for them,\nHilton knew that the time had come to let all his BuSci personnel move\ninto their homes aground. Everyone, including himself, was fed up to the\ngozzel with spaceship life--its jam-packed crowding; its flat,\nreprocessed air; its limited variety of uninteresting food. Conditions\nwere especially irksome since everybody knew that there was available to\nall, whenever Hilton gave the word, a whole city full of all the room\nanyone could want, natural fresh air and--so the Omans had told them--an\nunlimited choice of everything anyone wanted to eat.\n\nNevertheless, the decision was not an easy one to make.\n\nLiving conditions were admittedly not good on the ship. On the other\nhand, with almost no chance at all of solitude--the few people who had\nprivate offices aboard were not the ones he worried about--there was no\ndanger of sexual trouble. Strictly speaking, he was not responsible for\nthe morals of his force. He knew that he was being terribly\nold-fashioned. Nevertheless, he could not argue himself out of the\nconviction that he was morally responsible.\n\nFinally he took the thing up with Sandra, who merely laughed at him.\n\"How long have you been worrying about _that_, Jarve?\"\n\n\"Ever since I okayed moving aground the first time. That was one reason\nI was so glad to cancel it then.\"\n\n\"You _were_ slightly unclear--a little rattled? But which factor--the\nfun and games, which is the moral issue, or the consequences?\"\n\n\"The consequences,\" he admitted, with a rueful grin. \"I don't give a\nwhoop how much fun they have; but you know as well as I do just how\nprudish public sentiment is. And Project Theta Orionis is squarely in\nthe middle of the public eye.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You should have checked with me sooner and saved yourself wear and\ntear. There's no danger at all of consequences--except weddings. Lots of\nweddings, and fast.\"\n\n\"Weddings and babies wouldn't bother me a bit. Nor interfere with the\njob too much, with the Omans as nurses. But why the 'fast', if you\naren't anticipating any shotgun weddings?\"\n\n\"Female psychology,\" she replied, with a grin. \"Aboard-ship here there's\nno home atmosphere whatever; nothing but work, work, work. Put a woman\ninto a house, though--especially such houses as the Omans have built and\nwith such servants as they insist on being--and she goes domestic in a\nreally big way. Just sex isn't good enough any more. She wants the kind\nof love that goes with a husband and a home, and nine times out of ten\nshe gets it. With these BuSci women it'll be ten out of ten.\"\n\n\"You may be right, of course, but it sounds kind of far-fetched to me.\"\n\n\"Wait and see, chum,\" Sandra said, with a laugh.\n\nHilton made his announcement and everyone moved aground the next day. No\none, however, had elected to live alone. Almost everyone had chosen to\ndouble up; the most noteworthy exceptions being twelve laboratory girls\nwho had decided to keep on living together. However, they now had a\ntwenty-room house instead of a one-room dormitory to live in, and a\nstaff of twenty Oman girls to help them do it.\n\nHilton had suggested that Temple and Teddy, whose house was only a\nhundred yards or so from the Hilton-Karns bungalow, should have supper\nand spend the first evening with them; but the girls had knocked that\nidea flat. Much better, they thought, to let things ride as nearly as\npossible exactly as they had been aboard the _Perseus_.\n\n\"A _little_ smooching now and then, on the Q strictly T, but that's all,\ndarling. That's _positively_ all,\" Temple had said, after a highly\nsatisfactory ten minutes alone with him in her own gloriously private\nroom, and that was the way it had to be.\n\nHence it was a stag inspection that Hilton and Karns made of their new\nhome. It was very long, very wide, and for its size very low. Four of\nits five rooms were merely adjuncts to its tremendous living-room. There\nwas a huge fireplace at each end of this room, in each of which a fire\nof four-foot-long fir cordwood crackled and snapped. There was a great\nhi-fi tri-di, with over a hundred tapes, all new.\n\n\"Yes, sirs,\" Larry and Javvy spoke in unison. \"The players and singers\nwho entertained the Masters of old have gone back to work. They will\nalso, of course, appear in person whenever and wherever you wish.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBoth men looked around the vast room and Karns said: \"All the comforts\nof home and a couple of bucks' worth besides. Wall-to-wall carpeting an\ninch and a half thick. A grand piano. Easy chairs and loafers and\ndavenports. Very fine reproductions of our favorite paintings ... and\nstatuary.\"\n\n\"You said it, brother.\" Hilton was bending over a group in bronze. \"If I\ndidn't know better, I'd swear this is the original deHaven 'Dance of the\nNymphs'.\"\n\nKarns had marched up to and was examining minutely a two-by-three-foot\npainting, in a heavy gold frame, of a gorgeously auburn-haired nude.\n\"Reproduction, hell! This is a _duplicate_! Lawrence's 'Innocent' is\nworth twenty million wogs and it's sealed behind quad armor-glass in\nPrime Art--but I'll bet wogs to wiggles the Prime Curator himself, with\nall his apparatus, couldn't tell this one from his!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't take even one wiggle's worth of that. And this 'Laughing\nCavalier' and this 'Toledo' are twice as old and twice as fabulously\nvaluable.\"\n\n\"And there are my own golf clubs....\"\n\n\"Excuse us, sirs,\" the Omans said, \"These things were simple because\nthey could be induced in your minds. But the matter of a staff could\nnot, nor what you would like to eat for supper, and it is growing late.\"\n\n\"Staff? What the hell has the staff got to do with ...\"\n\n\"_House_-staff, they mean,\" Karns said. \"We don't need much of anybody,\nboys. Somebody to keep the place shipshape, is all. Or, as a de luxe\ntouch, how about a waitress? One housekeeper and one waitress. That'll\nbe finer.\"\n\n\"Very well, sirs. There is one other matter. It has troubled us that we\nhave not been able to read in your minds the logical datum that they\nshould in fact simulate Doctor Bells and Doctor Blake?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Both men gasped--and then both exploded like one twelve-inch\nlength of primacord.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhile the Omans could not understand this purely Terran reasoning, they\naccepted the decision without a demurring thought. \"Who, then, are the\ntwo its to simulate?\"\n\n\"No stipulation; roll your own,\" Hilton said, and glanced at Karns.\n\"None of these Oman women are really hard on the eyes.\"\n\n\"Check. Anybody who wouldn't call any one of 'em a slurpy dish needs a\nnew set of optic nerves.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" the Omans said, \"no delay at all will be necessary, as\nwe can make do with one temporarily. The Sory, no longer Sora, who has\nnot been glad since the Tuly replaced it, is now in your kitchen. It\ncomes.\"\n\nA woman came in and stood quietly in front of the two men, the wafted\nair carrying from her clear, smooth skin a faint but unmistakable\nfragrance of Idaho mountain syringa. She was radiantly happy; her\nbright, deep-green eyes went from man to man.\n\n\"You wish, sirs, to give me your orders verbally. And yes, you may order\nfresh, whole, not-canned hens' eggs.\"\n\n\"I certainly will, then; I haven't had a fried egg since we left Terra.\nBut ... Larry said ... _you_ aren't Sory!\"\n\n\"Oh, but I am, sir.\"\n\nKarns had been staring her, eyes popping. \"Holy Saint Patrick! Talk\nabout simulation, Jarve! They've made her over into Lawrence's\n'Innocent'--exact to twenty decimals!\"\n\n\"You're so right.\" Hilton's eyes went, half a dozen times, from the form\nof flesh to the painting and back. \"That must have been a terrific job.\"\n\n\"Oh, no. It was quite simple, really,\" Sory said, \"since the brain was\nnot involved. I merely reddened my hair and lengthened it, made my eyes\nto be green, changed my face a little, pulled myself in a little around\nhere....\" Her beautifully-manicured hands swept the full circle of her\nwaistline, then continued to demonstrate appropriately the rest of her\nspeech:\n\n\"... and pushed me out a little up here and tapered my legs a little\nmore--made them a little larger and rounder here at my hips and thighs\nand a little smaller toward and at my ankles. Oh, yes, and made my feet\nand hands a little smaller. That's all. I thought the Doctor Karns would\nlike me a little better this way.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You can broadcast _that_ over the P-A system at high noon.\" Karns was\nstill staring. \"'That's all,' she says. But you didn't have _time_ to ...\"\n\n\"Oh, I did it day before yesterday. As soon as Javvy materialized the\n'Innocent' and I knew it to be your favorite art.\"\n\n\"But damn it, we hadn't even _thought_ of having you here then!\"\n\n\"But I had, sir. I fully intended to serve, one way or another, in this\nyour home. But of course I had no idea I would ever have such an honor\nas actually waiting on you at your table. Will you please give me your\norders, sirs, besides the eggs? You wish the eggs fried in butter--three\nof them apiece--and sunny side up.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, with ham,\" Hilton said. \"I'll start with a jumbo shrimp\ncocktail. Horseradish and ketchup sauce; heavy on the horseradish.\"\n\n\"Same for me,\" Karns said, \"but only half as much horseradish.\"\n\n\"And for the rest of it,\" Hilton went on, \"hashed-brown potatoes and\nbuttered toast--plenty of extra butter--strong coffee from first to\nlast. Whipping cream and sugar on the side. For dessert, apple pie _a la\nmode_.\"\n\n\"You make me drool, chief. Play that for me, please, Innocent, all the\nway.\"\n\n\"Oh? You are--you, personally, yourself, sir?--renaming me 'Innocent'?\"\n\n\"If you'll sit still for it, yes.\"\n\n\"That is an incredible honor, sir. Simply unbelievable. I thank you! I\nthank you!\" Radiating happiness, she dashed away toward the kitchen.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the two men were full of food, they strolled over to a davenport\nfacing the fire. As they sat down, Innocent entered the room, carrying a\ntall, dewy mint julep on a tray. She was followed by another female\nfigure bearing a bottle of avignognac and the appurtenances which are\nits due--and at the first full sight of that figure Hilton stopped\nbreathing for fifteen seconds.\n\nHer hair was very thick, intensely black and long, cut squarely off just\nbelow the lowest points of her shoulder blades. Heavy brows and long\nlashes--eyes too--were all intensely, vividly black. Her skin was tanned\nto a deep and glowing almost-but-not-quite-brown.\n\n\"Murchison's Dark Lady!\" Hilton gasped. \"Larry! You've--we've--_I've_\ngot that painting here?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir.\" The newcomer spoke before Larry could. \"At the other\nend--your part--of the room. You will look now, sir, please?\" Her voice\nwas low, rich and as smooth as cream.\n\nPutting her tray down carefully on the end-table, she led him toward the\nother fireplace. Past the piano, past the tri-di pit; past a towering\ngrillwork holding art treasures by the score. Over to the left, against\nthe wall, there was a big, business-like desk. On the wall, over the\ndesk, hung _the_ painting; a copy of which had been in Hilton's room for\nover eight years.\n\nHe stared at it for at least a minute. He glanced around: at the other\npriceless duplicates so prodigally present, at his own guns arrayed\nabove the mantel and on each side of the fireplace. Then, without a\nword, he started back to join Karns. She walked springily beside him.\n\n\"What's your name, Miss?\" he asked, finally.\n\n\"I haven't earned any as yet, sir. My number is ...\"\n\n\"Never mind that. Your name is 'Dark Lady'.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, sir; that is truly wonderful!\" And Dark Lady sat\ncross-legged on the rug at Hilton's feet and busied herself with the\nesoteric rites of Old Avignon.\n\nHilton took a deep inhalation and a small sip, then stared at Karns.\nKarns, over the rim of his glass, stared back.\n\n\"I can see where this would be habit-forming,\" Hilton said, \"and very\ndeadly. _Extremely_ deadly.\"\n\n\"Every wish granted. Surrounded by all this.\" Karns swept his arm\nthrough three-quarters of a circle. \"Waited on hand and foot by powerful\nmen and by the materializations of the dreams of the greatest, finest\nartists who ever lived. Fatal? I don't know....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"My solid hope is that we never have to find out. And when you add in\nInnocent and Dark Lady.... They _look_ to be about seventeen, but the\nthought that they're older than the hills of Rome and powered by\neverlasting atomic engines--\" He broke off suddenly and blushed. \"Excuse\nme, please, girls. I _know_ better than to talk about people that way,\nright in front of them; I really do.\"\n\n\"Do you really think we're _people_?\" Innocent and Dark Lady squealed,\nas one.\n\nThat set Hilton back onto his heels. \"I don't know.... I've wondered.\nAre you?\"\n\nBoth girls, silent, looked at Larry.\n\n\"We don't know, either,\" Larry said. \"At first, of course, there were\ncrude, non-thinking machines. But when the Guide attained its present\nstatus, the Masters themselves could not agree. They divided about half\nand half on the point. They never did settle it any closer than that.\"\n\n\"I certainly won't try to, then. But for my money, you are people,\"\nHilton said, and Karns agreed.\n\nThat, of course, touched off a near-riot of joy; after which the two men\nmade an inch-by-inch study of their tremendous living-room. Then, long\nafter bedtime, Larry and Dark Lady escorted Hilton to his bedroom.\n\n\"Do you mind, sir, if we sleep on the floor at the sides of your bed?\"\nLarry asked. \"Or must we go out into the hall?\"\n\n\"Sleep? I didn't know you _could_ sleep.\"\n\n\"It is not essential. However, when round-the-clock work is not\nnecessary, and we have opportunity to sleep near a human being, we\nderive a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction from it. You see, sir,\nwe also serve during sleep.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll try anything once. Sleep wherever you please.\"\n\nHilton began to peel, but before he had his shirt off both Larry and\nDark Lady were stretched out flat, sound asleep, one almost under each\nedge of his bed. He slid in between the sheets--it was the most\ncomfortable bed he had ever slept in--and went to sleep as though\nsandbagged.\n\nHe had time to wonder foggily whether the Omans were in fact helping him\ngo to sleep--and then he _was_ asleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA month passed. Eight couples had married, the Navy chaplain\nofficiating--in the _Perseus_, of course, since the warship was, always\nand everywhere, an integral part of Terra.\n\nSandra had dropped in one evening to see Hilton about a bit of business.\nShe was now sitting, long dancer's legs out-stretched toward the fire,\nwith a cigarette in her left hand and a tall, cold drink on a coaster at\nher right.\n\n\"This is a wonderful room, Jarvis. It'd be perfect if it weren't quite\nso ... so mannish.\"\n\n\"What do you expect of Bachelors' Hall--a boudoir? Don't tell me\n_you're_ going domestic, Sandy, just because you've got a house?\"\n\n\"Not just that, no. But of course it helped it along.\"\n\n\"Alex is a mighty good man. One of the finest I have ever known.\"\n\nShe eyed him for a moment in silence. \"Jarvis Hilton, you are one of the\nkeenest, most intelligent men who ever lived. And yet ...\" She broke off\nand studied him for a good half minute. \"Say, if I let my hair clear\ndown, will you?\"\n\n\"Scout's Oath. That 'and yet' requires elucidation at any cost.\"\n\n\"I know. But first, yes, it's Alex. I never would have believed that any\nman ever born could hit me so hard. Soon. I didn't want to be the first,\nbut I won't be anywhere near the last. But tell me. You were really in\nlove with Temple, weren't you, when I asked you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ha! You _are_ letting your hair down! That makes me feel better.\"\n\n\"Huh? Why should it?\"\n\n\"It elucidates the 'and yet' no end. You were insulated from all other\nfemale charms by ye brazen Bells. You see, most of us assistants made a\nkind of game out of seeing which of us could make you break the\nExecutives' Code. And none of us made it. Teddy and Temple said you\ndidn't know what was going on; Bev and I said nobody as smart as you are\ncould possibly be that stupid.\"\n\n\"You aren't the type to leak or name names--oh, I see. You are merely\nreporting a conversation. The game had interested, but non-participating,\nobservers. Temple and Teddy, at least.\"\n\n\"At least,\" she agreed. \"But damn it, you _aren't_ stupid. There isn't a\nstupid bone in your head. So it must be love. And if so, what about\nmarriage? Why don't you and Temple make it a double with Alex and me?\"\n\n\"That's the most cogent thought you ever had, but setting the date is\nthe bride's business.\" He glanced at his Oman wristwatch. \"It's early\nyet; let's skip over. I wouldn't mind seeing her a minute or two.\"\n\n\"Thy statement ringeth with truth, friend. Bill's there with Teddy?\"\n\n\"I imagine so.\"\n\n\"So we'll talk to them about making it a triple. Oh, nice--let's go!\"\n\nThey left the house and, her hand tucked under his elbow, walked up the\nstreet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNext morning, on her way to the Hall of Records, Sandra stopped off as\nusual at the office. The Omans were all standing motionless. Hilton was\nleaning far back in his chair, feet on desk, hands clasped behind head,\neyes closed. Knowing what that meant, she turned and started back out on\ntiptoe.\n\nHowever, he had heard her. \"Can you spare a couple of minutes to think\nat me, Sandy?\"\n\n\"Minutes or hours, chief.\" Tuly placed a chair for her and she sat down,\nfacing him across his desk.\n\n\"Thanks, gal. This time it's the Stretts. Sawtelle's been having\nnightmares, you know, ever since we emerged, about being attacked, and\nI've been pooh-poohing the idea. But now it's a statistic that the soup\nis getting thicker, and I can't figure out why. Why in all the hells of\nspace should a stasis that has lasted for over a quarter of a million\nyears be broken at this exact time? The only possible explanation is\nthat _we_ caused the break. And any way I look at that concept, it's\nplain idiocy.\"\n\nBoth were silent for minutes; and then it was demonstrated again that\nTerra's Advisory Board had done better than it knew in choosing Sandra\nCummings to be Jarvis Hilton's working mate.\n\n\"We did cause it, Jarve,\" she said, finally. \"They knew we were coming,\neven before we got to Fuel Bin. They knew we were human and tried to\nwipe out the Omans before we got there. Preventive warfare, you know.\"\n\n\"They _couldn't_ have known!\" he snorted. \"Strett detectors are no\nbetter than Oman, and you know what Sam Bryant had to say about them.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Sandra grinned appreciatively. \"It's becoming a classic. But\nit couldn't have been any other way. Besides, I _know_ they did.\"\n\nHe stared at her helplessly, then swung on Larry. \"Does that make sense\nto you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. The Stretts could peyondire as well as the old Masters could,\nand they undoubtedly still can and do.\"\n\n\"Okay, it does make sense, then.\" He absented himself in thought, then\ncame to life with a snap. \"Okay! The next thing on the agenda is a\ncrash-priority try at a peyondix team. Tuly, you organized a team to\ngenerate sathura. Can you do the same for peyondix?\"\n\n\"If we can find the ingredients, yes, sir.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I had a hunch. Larry, please ask Teddy Blake's Oman to bring her in\nhere....\"\n\n\"I'll be running along, then.\" Sandra started to get up.\n\n\"I hope to kiss a green pig you won't!\" Hilton snapped. \"You're one of\nthe biggest wheels. Larry, we'll want Temple Bells and Beverly Bell--for\na start.\"\n\n\"Chief, you positively amaze me,\" Sandra said then. \"Every time you get\none of these attacks of genius--or whatever it is--you have me gasping\nlike a fish. Just what can you _possibly_ want of Bev Bell?\"\n\n\"Whatever it was that enabled her to hit the target against odds of\nalmost infinity to one; not just once, but time after time. By\ndefinition, intuition. What quality did you use just now in getting me\noff the hook? Intuition. What makes Teddy Blake such an unerring\nperformer? Intuition again. My hunches--they're intuition, too.\nIntuition, _hell_! Labels--based on utterly abysmal damned dumb\nignorance of our own basic frames of reference. Do you think those four\nkinds of intuition are alike, by seven thousand rows of apple trees?\"\n\n\"Of course not. I see what you're getting at.... Oh! This'll be fun!\"\n\nThe others came in and, one by one, Tuly examined each of the four\nwomen and the man. Each felt the probing, questioning feelers of her\nthought prying into the deepest recesses of his mind.\n\n\"There is not quite enough of each of three components, all of which are\nusually associated with the male. You, sir, have much of each, but not\nenough. I know your men quite well, and I think we will need the doctors\nKincaid and Karns and Poynter. But such deep probing is felt. Have I\npermission, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes. Tell 'em I said so.\"\n\nTuly scanned. \"Yes, sir, we should have all three.\"\n\n\"Get 'em, Larry.\" Then, in the pause that followed: \"Sandy, remember\nyowling about too many sweeties on a team? What do you think of this\nbusiness of all sweeties?\"\n\n\"All that proves is that nobody can be wrong all the time,\" she replied\nflippantly.\n\nThe three men arrived and were instructed. Tuly said: \"The great trouble\nis that each of you must use a portion of your mind that you do not know\nyou have. You, this one. You, that one.\" Tuly probed mercilessly; so\npoignantly that each in turn flinched under brand-new and almost\nunbearable pain. \"With you, Doctor Hilton, it will be by far the worst.\nFor you must learn to use almost all the portions of both your minds,\nthe conscious and the unconscious. This must be, because you are the\nactual peyondixer. The others merely supply energies in which you\nyourself are deficient. Are you ready for a terrible shock, sir?\"\n\n\"Shoot.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe thought for a second that he _had_ been shot; that his brain had\nblown up.\n\nHe couldn't stand it--he _knew_ he was going to die--he wished he\n_could_ die--anything, anything whatever, to end this unbearable\nagony....\n\nIt ended.\n\nWrithing, white and sweating, Hilton opened his eyes. \"Ouch,\" he\nremarked, conversationally. \"What next?\"\n\n\"You will seize hold of the energies your friends offer. You will bind\nthem to yours and shape the whole into a dimensionless sphere of pure\ncontrolled, dirigible energy. And, as well as being the binding force,\nthe cohesiveness, you must also be the captain and the pilot and the\nastrogator and the ultimately complex computer itself.\"\n\n\"But how can I.... Okay, damn it. I _will_!\"\n\n\"Of course you will, sir. Remember also that once the joinings are made\nI can be of very little more assistance, for my peyondix is as nothing\ncompared to that of your fusion of eight. Now, to assemble the energies\nand join them you will, all together, deny the existence of the sum\ntotal of reality as you know it. Distance does not exist--every point in\nthe reachable universe coincides with every other point and that common\npoint is the focus of your attention. You can be and actually are\nanywhere you please or everywhere at once. Time does not exist. Space\ndoes not exist. There is no such thing as opacity; everything is\nperfectly transparent, yet every molecule of substance is perceptible in\nits relationship to every other molecule in the cosmos. Senses do not\nexist. Sight, hearing, taste, touch, smell, sathura, endovix--all are\nparts of the one great sense of peyondix. I am guiding each of you\nseven--closer! Tighter! There! Seize it, sir--and when you work the\nStretts you must fix it clearly that time does not exist. You must work\nin millionths of microseconds instead of in minutes, for they have minds\nof tremendous power. Reality does not exist! Compress it more, sir.\nTighter! Smaller! Rounder! There! Hold it! Reality does not\nexist--distance does not exist--all possible points are....\n_Wonderful!_\"\n\nTuly screamed the word and the thought: \"Good-by! Good luck!\"\n\n\nEND OF PART ONE\n\n\n\n\n PART TWO\n\n\n They were the Masters, and they\n had only to choose: eternal life,\n as inhuman monsters--or death!\n\n\n MASTERS\n OF\n SPACE\n\n\n BY EDWARD E. SMITH &\n E. EVERETT EVANS\n\n\n Illustrated by BERRY\n\n\n\n\n      _What has gone before: The crew of the starship Orion found\n      themselves in the middle of a great space war between the\n      creatures called Stretts and the lost android servants of\n      their own human ancestors. Helped by the androids, the\n      Earthmen formed themselves into the powerful telepathic\n      linkage called \"peyondix\" to invade the Strett planet\n      itself. As their minds joined they heard the android Tuly\n      cry out, \"Good....\" And then their minds were out in\n      interstellar space._\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nHilton did not have to drive the peyondix-beam to the planet Strett; it\nwas already there. And there was the monstrous First Lord Thinker Zoyar.\n\nInto that mind his multi-mind flashed, its every member as responsive to\nhis will as his own fingers--almost infinitely more so, in fact, because\nof the tremendous lengths of time required to send messages along\nnerves.\n\nThat horrid mind was scanned cell by cell. Then, after what seemed like\na few hours, when a shield began sluggishly to form, Hilton transferred\nhis probe to the mind of the Second Thinker, one Lord Ynos, and absorbed\neverything she knew. Then, the minds of all the other Thinkers being\nscreened, he studied the whole Strett planet, foot by foot, and\neverything that was on it.\n\nThen, mission accomplished, Hilton snapped his attention back to his\noffice and the multi-mind fell apart. As he opened his eyes he heard\nTuly scream: \"... Luck!\"\n\n\"Oh--you still here, Tuly? How long have we been gone?\"\n\n\"Approximately one and one-tenth seconds, sir.\"\n\n\"WHAT!\"\n\nBeverly Bell, in the haven of Franklin Poynter's arms, fainted quietly.\nSandra shrieked piercingly. The four men stared, goggle-eyed. Temple\nand Teddy, as though by common thought, burrowed their faces into brawny\nshoulders.\n\nHilton recovered first. \"So _that's_ what peyondix is.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir--I mean no, sir. No, I mean yes, but ...\" Tuly paused, licking\nher lips in that peculiarly human-female gesture of uncertainty.\n\n\"Well, what _do_ you mean? It either is or isn't. Or is that necessarily\nso?\"\n\n\"Not exactly, sir. That is, it started as peyondix. But it became something\nelse. Not even the most powerful of the old Masters--nobody--ever did or\never could _possibly_ generate such a force as that. Or handle it so fast.\"\n\n\"Well, with seven of the best minds of Terra and a ...\"\n\n\"Chip-chop the chit-chat!\" Karns said, harshly. \"What I want to know is\nwhether I was having a nightmare. Can there _possibly_ be a race such as\nI thought I saw? So utterly savage--ruthless--merciless! So devoid of\nevery human trace and so hell-bent determined on the extermination of\nevery other race in the Galaxy? God damn it, it simply doesn't make\nsense!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nEyes went from eyes to eyes to eyes.\n\nAll had seen the same indescribably horrible, abysmally atrocious,\nthings. Qualities and quantities and urges and drives that no words in\nany language could even begin to portray.\n\n\"It doesn't seem to, but there it is.\" Teddy Blake shook her head\nhopelessly.\n\nBig Bill Karns, hands still shaking, lit a cigarette before he spoke\nagain. \"Well, I've never been a proponent of genocide. But it's my\nconsidered opinion that the Stretts are one race the galaxy can get\nalong without.\"\n\n\"A hell of a lot better without,\" Poynter said, and all agreed.\n\n\"The point is, what can we do about it?\" Kincaid asked. \"The first\nthing, I would say, is to see whether we can do this--whatever it\nis--without Tuly's help. Shall we try it? Although I, for one, don't\nfeel like doing it right away.\"\n\n\"Not I, either.\" Beverly Bell held up her right hand, which was shaking\nuncontrollably. \"I feel as though I'd been bucking waves, wind and tide\nfor forty-eight straight hours without food, water or touch. Maybe in\nabout a week I'll be ready for another try at it. But today--not a\nchance!\"\n\n\"Okay. Scat, all of you,\" Hilton ordered. \"Take the rest of the day off\nand rest up. Put on your thought-screens and don't take them off for a\nsecond from now on. Those Stretts are tough hombres.\"\n\nSandra was the last to leave. \"And you, boss?\" she asked pointedly.\n\n\"I've got some thinking to do.\"\n\n\"I'll stay and help you think?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\" He shook his head, frowned and then grinned. \"You see, chick,\nI don't even know yet what it is I'm going to have to think about.\"\n\n\"A bit unclear, but I know what you mean--I think. Luck, chief.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn their subterranean sanctum turn on distant Strett, two of the deepest\nthinkers of that horribly unhuman race were in coldly intent conference\nvia thought.\n\n\"My mind has been plundered, Ynos,\" First Lord Thinker Zoyar radiated,\nharshly. \"Despite the extremely high reactivity of my shield some\ninformation--I do not know how much--was taken. The operator was one of\nthe humans of that ship.\"\n\n\"I, too, felt a plucking at my mind. But those humans could not\npeyondire, First Lord.\"\n\n\"Be logical, fool! At that contact, in the matter of which you erred in\nnot following up continuously, they succeeded in concealing their real\nabilities from you.\"\n\n\"That could be the truth. Our ancestors erred, then, in recording that\nall those weak and timid humans had been slain. These offenders are\nprobably their descendants, returning to reclaim their former world.\"\n\n\"The probability must be evaluated and considered. Was it or was it not\nthrough human aid that the Omans destroyed most of our task-force?\"\n\n\"Highly probable, but impossible of evaluation with the data now\navailable.\"\n\n\"Obtain more data at once. That point must be and shall be fully\nevaluated and fully considered. This entire situation is intolerable. It\nmust be abated.\"\n\n\"True, First Lord. But every operator and operation is now tightly\nscreened. Oh, if I could only go out there myself ...\"\n\n\"Hold, fool! Your thought is completely disloyal and un-Strettly.\"\n\n\"True, oh First Lord Thinker Zoyar. I will forthwith remove my unworthy\nself from this plane of existence.\"\n\n\"You will not! I hereby abolish that custom. Our numbers are too few by\nfar. Too many have failed to adapt. Also, as Second Thinker, your death\nat this time would be slightly detrimental to certain matters now in\nwork. I will myself, however, slay the unfit. To that end repeat The\nWords under my peyondiring.\"\n\n\"I am a Strett. I will devote my every iota of mental and of physical\nstrength to forwarding the Great Plan. I am, and will remain, a Strett.\"\n\n\"You do believe in The Words.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Of course I believe in them! I _know_ that in a few more hundreds of\nthousands of years we will be rid of material bodies and will become\ninvincible and invulnerable. Then comes the Conquest of the Galaxy ...\nand then the Conquest of the Universe!\"\n\n\"No more, then, on your life, of this weak and cowardly repining! Now,\nwhat of your constructive thinking?\"\n\n\"Programming must be such as to obviate time-lag. We must evaluate the\nfactors already mentioned and many others, such as the reactivation of\nthe spacecraft which was thought to have been destroyed so long ago.\nAfter having considered all these evaluations, I will construct a Minor\nPlan to destroy these Omans, whom we have permitted to exist on\nsufferance, and with them that shipload of despicably interloping\nhumans.\"\n\n\"That is well.\" Zoyar's mind seethed with a malevolent ferocity starkly\nimpossible for any human mind to grasp. \"And to that end?\"\n\n\"To that end we must intensify still more our program of procuring data.\nWe must revise our mechs in the light of our every technological advance\nduring the many thousands of cycles since the last such revision was\nmade. Our every instrument of power, of offense and of defense, must be\nbrought up to the theoretical ultimate of capability.\"\n\n\"And as to the Great Brain?\"\n\n\"I have been able to think of nothing, First Lord, to add to the\nundertakings you have already set forth.\"\n\n\"It was not expected that you would. Now: is it your final thought that\nthese interlopers are in fact the descendants of those despised humans\nof so long ago?\"\n\n\"It is.\"\n\n\"It is also mine. I return, then, to my work upon the Brain. You will\ntake whatever measures are necessary. Use every artifice of intellect\nand of ingenuity and our every resource. But abate this intolerable\nnuisance, and soon.\"\n\n\"It shall be done, First Lord.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Second Thinker issued orders. Frenzied, round-the-clock activity\nensued. Hundreds of mechs operated upon the brains of hundreds of\nothers, who in turn operated upon the operators.\n\nThen, all those brains charged with the technological advances of many\nthousands of years, the combined hundreds went unrestingly to work.\nThousands of work-mechs were built and put to work at the construction\nof larger and more powerful space-craft.\n\nAs has been implied, those battle-skeletons of the Stretts were\ncontrolled by their own built-in mechanical brains, which were\nprogrammed for only the simplest of battle maneuvers. Anything at all\nout of the ordinary had to be handled by remote control, by the\nspecialist-mechs at their two-miles-long control board.\n\nThis was now to be changed. Programming was to be made so complete that\nalmost any situation could be handled by the warship or the missile\nitself--instantly.\n\nThe Stretts _knew_ that they were the most powerful, the most highly\nadvanced race in the universe. Their science was the highest in the\nuniverse. Hence, with every operating unit brought up to the full\npossibilities of that science, that would be more than enough. Period.\n\nThis work, while it required much time, was very much simpler than the\ntask which the First Thinker had laid out for himself on the giant\ncomputer-plus which the Stretts called \"The Great Brain.\" In stating his\nproject, First Lord Zoyar had said:\n\n\"Assignment: To construct a machine that will have the following\nabilities: One, to contain and retain all knowledge and information fed\ninto it, however great the amount. Two, to feed itself additional\ninformation by peyondiring all planets, wherever situate, bearing\nintelligent life. Three, to call up instantly any and all items of\ninformation pertaining to any problem we may give it. Four, to combine\nand recombine any number of items required to form new concepts. Five,\nto formulate theories, test them and draw conclusions helpful to us in\nany matter in work.\"\n\nIt will have been noticed that these specifications vary in one\nimportant respect from those of the Eniacs and Univacs of Earth. Since\nwe of Earth can not peyondire, we do not expect that ability from our\ncomputers.\n\nThe Stretts could, and did.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen Sandra came back into the office at five o'clock she found Hilton\nstill sitting there, in almost exactly the same position.\n\n\"Come out of it, Jarve!\" She snapped a finger. \"That much of _that_ is\njust simply too damned much.\"\n\n\"You're so right, child.\" He got up, stretched, and by main strength\nshrugged off his foul mood. \"But we're up against something that is\nreally a something, and I don't mean perchance.\"\n\n\"How well I know it.\" She put an arm around him, gave him a quick, hard\nhug. \"But after all, you don't have to solve it this evening, you know.\"\n\n\"No, thank God.\"\n\n\"So why don't you and Temple have supper with me? Or better yet, why\ndon't all eight of us have supper together in that bachelors' paradise\nof yours and Bill's?\"\n\n\"That'd be fun.\"\n\nAnd it was.\n\nNor did it take a week for Beverly Bell to recover from the Ordeal of\nEight. On the following evening, she herself suggested that the team\nshould take another shot at that utterly fantastic _terra incognita_ of\nthe multiple mind, jolting though it had been.\n\n\"But are you sure you can take it again so soon?\" Hilton asked.\n\n\"Sure. I'm like that famous gangster's moll, you know, who bruised easy\nbut healed quick. And I want to know about it as much as anyone else\ndoes.\"\n\nThey could do it this time without any help from Tuly. The linkage\nfairly snapped together and shrank instantaneously to a point. Hilton\nthought of Terra and there it was; full size, yet occupying only one\ninfinitesimal section of a dimensionless point. The multi-mind visited\nrelatives of all eight, but could not make intelligible contact. If\nasleep, it caused pleasant dreams; if awake, pleasant thoughts of the\nloved one so far away in space; but that was all. It visited mediums, in\ntrance and otherwise--many of whom, not surprisingly now, were\ngenuine--with whom it held lucid conversations. Even in linkage,\nhowever, the multi-mind knew that none of the mediums would be believed,\neven if they all told, simultaneously, exactly the same story. The\nmulti-mind weakened suddenly and Hilton snapped it back to Ardry.\n\nBeverly was almost in collapse. The other girls were white, shaken and\ntrembling. Hilton himself, strong and rugged as he was, felt as though\nhe had done two weeks of hard labor on a rock-pile. He glanced\nquestioningly at Larry.\n\n\"Point six three eight seconds, sir,\" the Omans said, holding up a\nmillisecond timer.\n\n\"How do you explain _that_?\" Karns demanded.\n\n\"I'm afraid it means that without Oman backing we're out of luck.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHilton had other ideas, but he did not voice any of them until the\nfollowing day, when he was rested and had Larry alone.\n\n\"So carbon-based brains can't take it. One second of that stuff would\nhave killed all eight of us. Why? The Masters had the same kind of\nbrains we have.\"\n\n\"I don't know, sir. It's something completely new. No Master, or group\nof Masters, ever generated such a force as that. I can scarcely believe\nsuch power possible, even though I have felt it twice. It may be that\nover the generations your individual powers, never united or controlled,\nhave developed so strength that no human can handle them in fusion.\"\n\n\"And none of us ever knew anything about any of them. I've been doing a\nlot of thinking. The Masters had qualities and abilities now unknown to\nany of us. How come? You Omans--and the Stretts, too--think we're\ndescendants of the Masters. Maybe we are. You think they came originally\nfrom Arth--Earth or Terra--to Ardu. That'd account for our legends of\nMu, Atlantis and so on. Since Ardu was within peyondix range of Strett,\nthe Stretts attacked it. They killed all the Masters, they thought, and\nmade the planet uninhabitable for any kind of life, even their own. But\none shipload of Masters escaped and came here to Ardry--far beyond\npeyondix range. They stayed here for a long time. Then, for some reason\nor other--which may be someplace in their records--they left here, fully\nintending to come back. Do any of you Omans know why they left? Or where\nthey went?\"\n\n\"No, sir. We can read only the simplest of the Masters' records. They\narranged our brains that way, sir.\"\n\n\"I know. They're the type. However, I suspect now that your thinking is\nreversed. Let's turn it around. Say the Masters didn't come from Terra,\nbut from some other planet. Say that they left here because they were\ndying out. They were, weren't they?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Their numbers became fewer and fewer each century.\"\n\n\"I was sure of it. They were committing race suicide by letting you\nOmans do everything they themselves should have been doing. Finally they\nsaw the truth. In a desperate effort to save their race they pulled out,\nleaving you here. Probably they intended to come back when they had bred\nenough guts back into themselves to set you Omans down where you\nbelong....\"\n\n\"But _they_ were always the Masters, sir!\"\n\n\"They were not! They were hopelessly enslaved. Think it over. Anyway,\nsay they went _to_ Terra from here. That still accounts for the legends\nand so on. However, they were too far gone to make a recovery, and yet\nthey had enough fixity of purpose _not_ to manufacture any of you Omans\nthere. So their descendants went a long way down the scale before they\nbegan to work back up. Does that make sense to you?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It explains many things, sir. It can very well be the truth.\"\n\n\"Okay. However it was, we're here, and facing a condition that isn't\nfunny. While we were teamed up I learned a lot, but not nearly enough.\nAm I right in thinking that I now don't need the other seven at\nall--that my cells are fully charged and I can go it alone?\"\n\n\"Probably, sir, but ...\"\n\n\"I'm coming to that. Every time I do it--up to maximum performance, of\ncourse--it comes easier and faster and hits harder. So next time, or\nmaybe the fourth or fifth time, it'll kill me. And the other seven, too,\nif they're along.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure, sir, but I think so.\"\n\n\"Nice. Very, _very_ nice.\" Hilton got up, shoved both hands into his\npockets, and prowled about the room. \"But can't the damned stuff be\ncontrolled? Choked--throttled down--damped--muzzled, some way or other?\"\n\n\"We do not know of any way, sir. The Masters were always working toward\nmore power, not less.\"\n\n\"That makes sense. The more power the better, as long as you can handle\nit. But I can't handle this. And neither can the team. So how about\norganizing another team, one that hasn't got quite so much whammo?\nEnough punch to do the job, but not enough to backfire that way?\"\n\n\"It is highly improbable that such a team is possible, sir.\" If an Oman\ncould be acutely embarrassed, Larry was. \"That is, sir ... I should tell\nyou, sir ...\"\n\n\"You certainly should. You've been stalling all along, and now you're\nstalled. Spill it.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. The Tuly begged me not to mention it, but I must. When it\norganized your team it had no idea of what it was really going to\ndo....\"\n\n\"Let's talk the same language, shall we? Say 'he' and 'she.' Not 'it.'\"\n\n\"She thought she was setting up the peyondix, the same as all of us\nOmans have. But after she formed in your mind the peyondix matrix, your\nmind went on of itself to form a something else; a thing we can not\nunderstand. That was why she was so extremely ... I think 'frightened'\nmight be your term.\"\n\n\"I knew something was biting her. Why?\"\n\n\"Because it very nearly killed you. You perhaps have not considered the\neffect upon us all if any Oman, however unintentionally, should kill a\nMaster?\"\n\n\"No, I hadn't ... I see. So she won't play with fire any more, and none\nof the rest of you can?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Nothing could force her to. If she could be so coerced we\nwould destroy her brain before she could act. That brain, as you know,\nis imperfect, or she could not have done what she did. It should have\nbeen destroyed long since.\"\n\n\"Don't _ever_ act on that assumption, Larry.\" Hilton thought for\nminutes. \"Simple peyondix, such as yours, is not enough to read the\nMasters' records. If I'd had three brain cells working I'd've tried them\nthen. I wonder if I _could_ read them?\"\n\n\"You have all the old Masters' powers and more. But you must not\nassemble them again, sir. It would mean death.\"\n\n\"But I've got to _know_.... I've _got_ to know! Anyway, a thousandth of\na second would be enough. I don't think that'd hurt me very much.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe concentrated--read a few feet of top-secret braided wire--and came\nback to consciousness in the sickbay of the _Perseus_, with two doctors\nworking on him; Hastings, the top Navy medico, and Flandres, the\nsurgeon.\n\n\"What the hell happened to you?\" Flandres demanded. \"Were you trying to\nkill yourself?\"\n\n\"And if so, how?\" Hastings wanted to know.\n\n\"No, I was trying not to,\" Hilton said, weakly, \"and I guess I didn't\nmuch more than succeed.\"\n\n\"That was just about the closest shave I ever saw a man come through.\nWhatever it was, don't do it again.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" he promised, feelingly.\n\nWhen they let him out of the hospital, four days later, he called in\nLarry and Tuly.\n\n\"The next time would be the last time. So there won't be any,\" he told\nthem. \"But just how sure are you that some other of our boys or girls\nmay not have just enough of whatever it takes to do the job? Enough\noompa, but not too much?\"\n\n\"Since we, too, are on strange ground the probability is vanishingly\nsmall. We have been making inquiries, however, and scanning. You were\nselected from all the minds of Terra as the one having the widest\nvision, the greatest scope, the most comprehensive grasp. The ablest at\nsynthesis and correlation and so on.\"\n\n\"That's printing it in big letters, but that was more or less what they\nwere after.\"\n\n\"Hence the probability approaches unity that any more such ignorant\nmeddling as this obnoxious Tuly did well result almost certainly in\nfailure and death. Therefore we can not and will not meddle again.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You've got a point there.... So what I am is some kind of a freak.\nMaybe a kind of super-Master and maybe something altogether different.\nMaybe duplicable in a less lethal fashion, and maybe not. Veree\nhelpful--I don't think. But I don't want to kill anybody, either ...\nespecially if it wouldn't do any good. But we've got to do _something_!\"\nHilton scowled in thought for minutes. \"But an Oman brain could take it.\nAs you told us, Tuly, 'The brain of the Larry is very, very tough.'\"\n\n\"In a way, sir. Except that the Masters were very careful to make it\nphysically impossible for any Oman to go very far along that line. It\nwas only their oversight of my one imperfect brain that enabled me,\nalone of us all, to do that wrong.\"\n\n\"Stop thinking it was wrong, Tuly. I'm mighty glad you did. But I wasn't\nthinking of any regular Oman brain....\" Hilton's voice petered out.\n\n\"I see, sir. Yes, we can, by using your brain as Guide, reproduce it in\nan Oman body. You would then have the powers and most of the qualities\nof both ...\"\n\n\"No, you don't see, because I've got my screen on. Which I will now take\noff--\" he suited action to word--\"since the whole planet's screened and\nI have nothing to hide from you. Teddy Blake and I both thought of that,\nbut we'll consider it only as the ultimately last resort. We don't want\nto live a million years. And we want our race to keep on developing. But\nyou folks can replace carbon-based molecules with silicon-based ones\njust as easily as, and a hell of a lot faster than, mineral water\npetrifies wood. What can you do along the line of rebuilding me that\nway? And if you can do any such conversion, what would happen? Would I\nlive at all? And if so, how long? How would I live? What would I live\non? All that kind of stuff.\"\n\n\"Shortly before they left, two of the Masters did some work on that very\nthing. Tuly and I converted them, sir.\"\n\n\"Fine--or is it? How did it work out?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, sir ... except that they destroyed themselves. It was\nthought that they wearied of existence.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder. Well, if it comes to that, I can do the same. You _can_\nconvert me, then.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. But before we do it we must do enough preliminary work to be\nsure that you will not be harmed in any way. Also, there will be many\nmore changes involved than simple substitution.\"\n\n\"Of course. I realize that. Just see what you can do, please, and let me\nknow.\"\n\n\"We will, sir, and thank you very much.\"\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nAs has been intimated, no Terran can know what researches Larry and Tuly\nand the other Oman specialists performed, or how they arrived at the\nconclusions they reached. However, in less than a week Larry reported to\nHilton.\n\n\"It can be done, sir, with complete safety. And you will live even more\ncomfortably than you do now.\"\n\n\"How long?\"\n\n\"The mean will be about five thousand Oman years--you don't know that an\nOman year is equal to one point two nine three plus Terran years?\"\n\n\"I didn't, no. Thanks.\"\n\n\"The maximum, a little less than six thousand. The minimum, a little\nover four thousand. I'm very sorry we had no data upon which to base a\ncloser estimate.\"\n\n\"Close enough.\" He stared at the Oman. \"You could also convert my wife?\"\n\n\"Of course, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, we might be able to stand it, after we got used to the idea.\nMinimum, over five thousand Terran years ... barring accidents, of\ncourse?\"\n\n\"No, sir. No accidents. Nothing will be able to kill you, except by\ntotal destruction of the brain. And even then, sir, there will be the\npattern.\"\n\n\"I'll ... be ... damned....\" Hilton gulped twice. \"Okay, go ahead.\"\n\n\"Your skins will be like ours, energy-absorbers. Your 'blood' will carry\ncharges of energy instead of oxygen. Thus, you may breathe or not, as\nyou please. Unless you wish otherwise, we will continue the breathing\nfunction. It would scarcely be worth while to alter the automatic\nmechanisms that now control it. And you will wish at times to speak. You\nwill still enjoy eating and drinking, although everything ingested will\nbe eliminated, as at present, as waste.\"\n\n\"We'd add uranexite to our food, I suppose. Or drink radioactives, or\nsleep under cobalt-60 lamps.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Your family life will be normal; your sexual urges and\nsatisfactions the same. Fertilization and period of gestation unchanged.\nYour children will mature at the same ages as they do now.\"\n\n\"How do you--oh, I see. You wouldn't change any molecular linkages or\nconfigurations in the genes or chromosomes.\"\n\n\"We could not, sir, even if we wished. Such substitutions can be made\nonly in exact one-for-one replacements. In the near future you will, of\ncourse, have to control births quite rigorously.\"\n\n\"We sure would. Let's see ... say we want a stationary population of a\nhundred million on our planet. Each couple to have two children, a boy\nand a girl. Born when the parents are about fifty ... um-m-m. The gals\ncan have all the children they want, then, until our population is about\na million; then slap on the limit of two kids per couple. Right?\"\n\n\"Approximately so, sir. And after conversion you alone will be able to\noperate with the full power of your eight, without tiring. You will\nalso, of course, be able to absorb almost instantaneously all the\nknowledges and abilities of the old Masters.\"\n\nHilton gulped twice before he could speak. \"You wouldn't be holding\nanything else back, would you?\"\n\n\"Nothing important, sir. Everything else is minor, and probably known to\nyou.\"\n\n\"I doubt it. How long will the job take, and how much notice will you\nneed?\"\n\n\"Two days, sir. No notice. Everything is ready.\"\n\nHilton, face somber, thought for minutes. \"The more I think of it the\nless I like it. But it seems to be a forced put ... and Temple will blow\nsky high ... and _have_ I got the guts to go it alone, even if she'd let\nme....\" He shrugged himself out of the black mood. \"I'll look her up and\nlet you know, Larry.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked her up and told her everything. Told her bluntly; starkly;\ndrawing the full picture in jet black, with very little white.\n\n\"There it is, sweetheart. The works,\" he concluded. \"We are not going to\nhave ten years; we may not have ten months. So--if such a brain as that\ncan be had, do we or do we not have to have it? I'm putting it squarely\nup to you.\"\n\nTemple's face, which had been getting paler and paler, was now as nearly\ncolorless as it could become; the sickly yellow of her skin's light tan\nunbacked by any flush of red blood.\n\nHer whole body was tense and strained.\n\n\"There's a horrible snapper on that question.... Can't _I_ do it? Or\n_anybody_ else except you?\"\n\n\"No. Anyway, whose job is it, sweetheart?\"\n\n\"I know, but ... but I know just how close Tuly came to killing you. And\nthat wasn't _anything_ compared to such a radical transformation as\nthis. I'm afraid it'll kill you, darling. And I just simply couldn't\n_stand_ it!\"\n\nShe threw herself into his arms, and he comforted her in the ages-old\nfashion of man with maid.\n\n\"Steady, hon,\" he said, as soon as he could lift her tear-streaked face\nfrom his shoulder. \"I'll live through it. I thought you were getting the\nhowling howpers about having to live for six thousand years and never\ngetting back to Terra except for a Q strictly T visit now and then.\"\n\nShe pulled away from him, flung back her wheaten mop and glared. \"So\n_that's_ what you thought! What do I care how long I live, or how, or\nwhere, as long as it's with you? But what makes you think we can\npossibly live through such a horrible conversion as that?\"\n\n\"Larry wouldn't do it if there was any question whatever. He didn't say\nit would be painless. But he did say I'd live.\"\n\n\"Well, he knows, I guess ... I hope.\" Temple's natural fine color began\nto come back. \"But it's understood that just the second you come out of\nthe vat, I go right in.\"\n\n\"I hadn't ought to let you, of course. But I don't think I could take it\nalone.\"\n\nThat statement required a special type of conference, which consumed\nsome little time. Eventually, however, Temple answered it in words.\n\n\"Of course you couldn't, sweetheart, and I wouldn't let you, even if you\ncould.\"\n\nThere were a few things that had to be done before those two secret\nconversions could be made. There was the matter of the wedding, which\nwas now to be in quadruplicate. Arrangements had to be made so that\neight Big Wheels of the Project could all be away on honeymoon at once.\n\nAll these things were done.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOf the conversion operations themselves, nothing more need be said. The\nhoneymooners, having left ship and town on a Friday afternoon, came back\none week from the following Monday[1] morning. The eight met joyously in\nBachelors' Hall; the girls kissing each other and the men\nindiscriminately and enthusiastically; the men cooperating zestfully.\n\n[1] While it took some time to recompute the exact Ardrian calendar,\nTerran day names and Terran weeks were used from the first. The Omans\nmanufactured watches, clocks, and chronometers which divided the Ardrian\nday into twenty-four Ardrian hours, with minutes and seconds as usual.\n\nTemple scarcely blushed at all, she was so engrossed in trying to find\nout whether or not anyone was noticing any change. No one seemed to\nnotice anything out of the ordinary. So, finally, she asked.\n\n\"Don't _any_ of you, really, see anything different?\"\n\nThe six others all howled at that, and Sandra, between giggles and\nsnorts, said: \"No, precious, it doesn't show a bit. Did you really think\nit would?\"\n\nTemple blushed furiously and Hilton came instantly to his bride's\nrescue. \"Chip-chop the comedy, gang. She and I aren't human any more.\nWe're a good jump toward being Omans. I couldn't make her believe it\ndoesn't show.\"\n\nThat stopped the levity, cold, but none of the six could really believe\nit. However, after Hilton had coiled a twenty-penny spike into a perfect\nhelix between his fingers, and especially after he and Temple had each\nchewed up and swallowed a piece of uranexite, there were no grounds left\nfor doubt.\n\n\"That settles it ... it _tears_ it,\" Karns said then. \"Start all over\nagain, Jarve. We'll listen, this time.\"\n\nHilton told the long story again, and added: \"I had to re-work a couple\nof cells of Temple's brain, but now she can read and understand the\nrecords as well as I can. So I thought I'd take her place on Team One\nand let her boss the job on all the other teams. Okay?\"\n\n\"So you don't want to let the rest of us in on it.\" Karns's level stare\nwas a far cry from the way he had looked at his chief a moment before.\n\"If there's any one thing in the universe I never had _you_ figured for,\nit's a dog in the manger.\"\n\n\"Huh? You mean you actually _want_ to be a ... a ... hell, we don't even\nknow _what_ we are!\"\n\n\"I do want it, Jarvis. We all do.\" This was, of all people, Teddy! \"No\none in all history has had more than about fifty years of really\nproductive thinking. And just the idea of having enough time ...\"\n\n\"Hold it, Teddy. Use your brain. The Masters couldn't take it--they\ncommitted suicide. How do you figure we can do any better?\"\n\n\"Because we'll _use_ our brains!\" she snapped. \"They didn't. The Omans\nwill serve us; and that's _all_ they'll do.\"\n\n\"And do you think you'll be able to raise your children and\ngrandchildren and so on to do the same? To have guts enough to resist\nthe pull of such an ungodly habit-forming drug as this Oman service is?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I'm sure of it.\" She nodded positively. \"And we'll run all applicants\nthrough a fine enough screen to--that is, if we ever consider anybody\nexcept our own BuSci people. And there's another reason.\" She grinned,\ngot up, wriggled out of her coverall, and posed in bra and panties.\n\"Look. I can keep most of this for five years. Quite a lot of it for\nten. Then comes the struggle. What do _you_ think I'd do for the\nability, whenever it begins to get wrinkly or flabby, to peel the whole\nthing off and put on a brand-spanking-new smooth one? You name it, I'll\ndo it! Besides, Bill and I will _both_ just simply and cold-bloodedly\nmurder you if you try to keep us out.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Hilton looked at Temple; she looked at him; both looked at all\nthe others. There was no revulsion at all. Nothing but eagerness.\n\nTemple took over.\n\n\"I'm surprised. We're both surprised. You see, Jarve didn't want to do\nit at all, but he had to. I not only didn't want to, I was scared green\nand yellow at just the idea of it. But I had to, too, of course. We\ndidn't think anybody would really want to. We thought we'd be left here\nalone. We still will be, I think, when you've thought it clear through,\nTeddy. You just haven't realized yet that we aren't even human any more.\nWe're simply nothing but _monsters_!\" Temple's voice became a wail.\n\n\"I've said my piece,\" Teddy said. \"You tell 'em, Bill.\"\n\n\"Let me say something first,\" Kincaid said. \"Temple, I'm ashamed of you.\nThis line isn't at all your usual straight thinking. What you actually\nare is _homo superior_. Bill?\"\n\n\"I can add one bit to that. I don't wonder that you were scared silly,\nTemple. Utterly new concept and you went into it stone cold. But now we\nsee the finished product and we like it. In fact, we drool.\"\n\n\"I'll say we're drooling,\" Sandra said. \"I could do handstands and\npinwheels with joy.\"\n\n\"Let's see you,\" Hilton said. \"That we'd all get a kick out of.\"\n\n\"Not now--don't want to hold this up--but sometime I just will. Bev?\"\n\n\"I'm for it--and _how_! And won't Bernadine be amazed,\" Beverly laughed\ngleefully, \"at her wise-crack about the 'race to end all human races'\ncoming true?\"\n\n\"I'm in favor of it, too, one hundred per cent,\" Poynter said. \"Has it\noccurred to you, Jarve, that this opens up intergalactic exploration? No\nsupplies to carry and plenty of time and fuel?\"\n\n\"No, it hadn't. You've got a point there, Frank. That might take a\nlittle of the curse off of it, at that.\"\n\n\"When some of our kids get to be twenty years old or so and get married,\nI'm going to take a crew of them to Andromeda. We'll arrange, then, to\nextend our honeymoons another week,\" Hilton said. \"What will our policy\nbe? Keep it dark for a while with just us eight, or spread it to the\nrest?\"\n\n\"Spread it, I'd say,\" Kincaid said.\n\n\"We can't keep it secret, anyway,\" Teddy argued. \"Since Larry and Tuly\nwere in on the whole deal, every Oman on the planet knows all about it.\nSomebody is going to ask questions, and Omans always answer questions\nand always tell the truth.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Questions have already been asked and answered,\" Larry said, going to\nthe door and opening it.\n\nStella rushed in. \"We've been hearing the _damnedest_ things!\" She\nkissed everybody, ending with Hilton, whom she seized by both shoulders.\n\"Is it actually true, boss, that you can fix me up so I'll live\npractically forever and can eat more than eleven calories a day without\ngetting fat as a pig? Candy, ice cream, cake, pie, eclairs, cream puffs,\nFrench pastries, sugar and gobs of thick cream in my coffee...?\"\n\nHalf a dozen others, including the van der Moen twins, came in. Beverly\nemitted a shriek of joy. \"Bernadine! The mother of the race to end all\nhuman races!\"\n\n\"You whistled it, birdie!\" Bernadine caroled. \"I'm going to have ten or\ntwelve, each one weirder than all the others. I told you I was a\nprophet--I'm going to hang out my shingle. Wholesale and retail\nprophecy; special rates for large parties.\" Her voice was drowned out\nin a general clamor.\n\n\"Hold it, everybody!\" Hilton yelled. \"Chip-chop it! _Quit_ it!\" Then, as\nthe noise subsided, \"If you think I'm going to tell this tall tale over\nand over again for the next two weeks you're all crazy. So shut down the\nplant and get everybody out here.\"\n\n\"Not _everybody_, Jarve!\" Temple snapped. \"We don't want scum, and\nthere's some of that, even in BuSci.\"\n\n\"You're so right. Who, then?\"\n\n\"The rest of the heads and assistants, of course ... and all the lab\ngirls and their husbands and boy-friends. I know they are all okay. That\nwill be enough for now, don't you think?\"\n\n\"I do think;\" and the indicated others were sent for; and in a few\nminutes arrived.\n\nThe Omans brought chairs and Hilton stood on a table. He spoke for ten\nminutes. Then: \"Before you decide whether you want to or not, think it\nover very carefully, because it's a one-way street. Fluorine can not be\ndisplaced. Once in, you're stuck for life. _There is no way back._ I've\ntold you all the drawbacks and disadvantages I know of, but there may be\na lot more that I haven't thought of yet. So think it over for a few\ndays and when each of you has definitely made up his or her mind, let me\nknow.\" He jumped down off the table.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis listeners, however, did not need days, or even seconds, to decide.\nBefore Hilton's feet hit the floor there was a yell of unanimous\napproval.\n\nHe looked at his wife. \"Do you suppose _we're_ nuts?\"\n\n\"Uh-uh. Not a bit. Alex was right. I'm going to just _love_ it!\" She\nhugged his elbow ecstatically. \"So are you, darling, as soon as you stop\nlooking at only the black side.\"\n\n\"You know ... you could be right?\" For the first time since the\n\"ghastly\" transformation Hilton saw that there really was a bright side\nand began to study it. \"With most of BuSci--and part of the Navy, and\nselectees from Terra--it _will_ be slightly terrific, at that!\"\n\n\"And that 'habit-forming-drug' objection isn't insuperable, darling,\"\nTemple said. \"If the younger generations start weakening we'll fix the\nOmans. I wouldn't want to wipe them out entirely, but ...\"\n\n\"But how do we settle priority, Doctor Hilton?\" a girl called out; a\ntall, striking, brunette laboratory technician whose name Hilton needed\na second to recall. \"By pulling straws or hair? Or by shooting dice or\neach other or what?\"\n\n\"Thanks, Betty, you've got a point. Sandy Cummings and department heads\nfirst, then assistants. Then you girls, in alphabetical order, each\nwith her own husband or fiance.\"\n\n\"And my name is Ames. Oh, goody!\"\n\n\"Larry, please tell them to ...\"\n\n\"I already have, sir. We are set up to handle four at once.\"\n\n\"Good boy. So scat, all of you, and get back to work--except Sandy,\nBill, Alex, and Teddy. You four go with Larry.\"\n\nSince the new sense was not peyondix, Hilton had started calling it\n\"perception\" and the others adopted the term as a matter of course.\nHilton could use that sense for what seemed like years--and actually was\nwhole minutes--at a time without fatigue or strain. He could not,\nhowever, nor could the Omans, give his tremendous power to anyone else.\n\nAs he had said, he could do a certain amount of reworking; but the\namount of improvement possible to make depended entirely upon what there\nwas to work on. Thus, Temple could cover about six hundred light-years.\nIt developed later that the others of the Big Eight could cover from one\nhundred up to four hundred or so. The other department heads and\nassistants turned out to be still weaker, and not one of the rank and\nfile ever became able to cover more than a single planet.\n\nThis sense was not exactly telepathy; at least not what Hilton had\nalways thought telepathy would be. If anything, however, it was more.\nIt was a lumping together of all five known human senses--and half a\ndozen unknown ones called, collectively, \"intuition\"--into one\nsuper-sense that was all-inclusive and all-informative. If he ever could\nlearn exactly what it was and exactly what it did and how it did it ...\nbut he'd better chip-chop the wool-gathering and get back onto the job.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Stretts had licked the old Masters very easily, and intended to wipe\nout the Omans and the humans. They had no doubt at all as to their\nability to do it. Maybe they could. If the Masters hadn't made some\nprogress that the Omans didn't know about, they probably could. That was\nthe first thing to find out. As soon as they'd been converted he'd call\nin all the experts and they'd go through the Masters' records like a\ndose of salts through a hillbilly schoolma'am.\n\nAt that point in Hilton's cogitations Sawtelle came in.\n\nHe had come down in his gig, to confer with Hilton as to the newly\nbeefed-up fleet. Instead of being glum and pessimistic and foreboding,\nhe was chipper and enthusiastic. They had rebuilt a thousand Oman ships.\nBy combining Oman and Terran science, and adding everything the First\nTeam had been able to reduce to practise, they had hyped up the power\nby a good fifteen per cent. Seven hundred of those ships, and all his\nmen, were now arrayed in defense around Ardry. Three hundred, manned by\nOmans, were around Fuel Bin.\n\n\"Why?\" Hilton asked. \"It's Fuel Bin they've been attacking.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh. Minor objective,\" the captain demurred, positively. \"The real\nattack will be here at you; the headquarters and the brains. Then Fuel\nBin will be duck soup. But the thing that pleased me most is the\ncontrol. Man, you never imagined such control! No admiral in history\never had such control of ten ships as I have of seven hundred. Those\nOmans spread orders so fast that I don't even finish thinking one and\nit's being executed. And no misunderstandings, no slips. For instance,\nthis last batch--fifteen skeletons. Far out; they're getting cagy. I\njust thought 'Box 'em in and slug 'em' and--In! Across! Out! Socko!\nPffft! Just like that and just that fast. None of 'em had time to light\na beam. Nobody before ever even _dreamed_ of such control!\"\n\n\"That's great, and I like it ... and you're only a captain. How many\nships can Five-Jet Admiral Gordon put into space?\"\n\n\"That depends on what you call ships. Superdreadnoughts, _Perseus_\nclass, six. First-line battleships, twenty-nine. Second-line, smaller\nand some pretty old, seventy-three. Counting everything armed that will\nhold air, something over two hundred.\"\n\n\"I thought it was something like that. How would you like to be Five-Jet\nAdmiral Sawtelle of the Ardrian Navy?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't. I'm Terran Navy. But you knew that and you know me.\nSo--what's on your mind?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHilton told him. _I ought to put this on a tape_, he thought to himself,\n_and broadcast it every hour on the hour_.\n\n\"They took the old Masters like dynamiting fish in a barrel,\" he\nconcluded, \"and I'm damned afraid they're going to lick us unless we\ntake a lot of big, fast steps. But the hell of it is that I can't tell\nyou anything--not one single thing--about any part of it. There's simply\nno way at all of getting through to you without making you over into the\nsame kind of a thing I am.\"\n\n\"Is that bad?\" Sawtelle was used to making important decisions fast.\n\"Let's get at it.\"\n\n\"Huh? Skipper, do you realize just what that means? If you think they'll\nlet you resign, forget it. They'll crucify you--brand you as a traitor\nand God only knows what else.\"\n\n\"Right. How about you and your people?\"\n\n\"Well, as civilians, it won't be as bad....\"\n\n\"The hell it won't. Every man and woman that stays here will be posted\nforever as the blackest traitors old Terra ever disgraced herself by\nspawning.\"\n\n\"You've got a point there, at that. We'll all have to bring our\nrelatives--the ones we think much of, at least--out here with us.\"\n\n\"Definitely. Now see what you can do about getting me run through your\nmill.\"\n\nBy exerting his authority, Hilton got Sawtelle put through the\n\"Preservatory\" in the second batch processed. Then, linking minds with\nthe captain, he flashed their joint attention to the Hall of Records.\nInto the right room; into the right chest; along miles and miles of\nbraided wire carrying some of the profoundest military secrets of the\nancient Masters.\n\nThen:\n\n\"Now you know a little of it,\" Hilton said. \"Maybe a thousandth of what\nwe'll have to have before we can take the Stretts as they will have to\nbe taken.\"\n\nFor seconds Sawtelle could not speak. Then: \"My ... God. I see what you\nmean. You're right. No Omans can ever go to Terra; and no Terrans can\never come here except to stay forever.\"\n\nThe two then went out into space, to the flagship--which had been\nchristened the _Orion_--and called in the six commanders.\n\n\"What _is_ all this senseless idiocy we've been getting, Jarve?\" Elliott\ndemanded.\n\nHilton eyed all six with pretended disfavor. \"You six guys are the\nhardest-headed bunch of skeptics that ever went unhung,\" he remarked,\ndispassionately. \"So it wouldn't do any good to tell you anything--yet.\nThe skipper and I will show you a thing first. Take her away, Skip.\"\n\nThe _Orion_ shot away under interplanetary drive and for several hours\nHilton and Sawtelle worked at re-wiring and practically rebuilding two\ndevices that no one, Oman or human, had touched since the _Perseus_ had\nlanded on Ardry.\n\n\"What are you ... I don't understand what you are doing, sir,\" Larry\nsaid. For the first time since Hilton had known him, the Oman's mind was\nconfused and unsure.\n\n\"I know you don't. This is a bit of top-secret Masters' stuff. Maybe,\nsome day, we'll be able to re-work your brain to take it. But it won't\nbe for some time.\"\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe _Orion_ hung in space, a couple of thousands of miles away from an\nasteroid which was perhaps a mile in average diameter. Hilton\nstraightened up.\n\n\"Put Triple X Black filters on your plates and watch that asteroid.\" The\ncommanders did so. \"Ready?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ready, sir.\"\n\nHilton didn't move a muscle. Nothing actually moved. Nevertheless there\nwas a motionlessly writhing and crawling distortion of the ship and\neverything in it, accompanied by a sensation that simply can not be\ndescribed.\n\nIt was not like going into or emerging from the sub-ether. It was not\neven remotely like space-sickness or sea-sickness or free fall or\nanything else that any Terran had ever before experienced.\n\nAnd the asteroid vanished.\n\nIt disappeared into an outrageously incandescent, furiously pyrotechnic,\nraveningly expanding atomic fireball that in seconds seemed to fill half\nof space.\n\nAfter ages-long minutes of the most horrifyingly devastating fury any\nman there had ever seen, the frightful thing expired and Hilton said:\n\"_That_ was just a kind of a firecracker. Just a feeble imitation of the\nfirst-stage detonator for what we'll have to have to crack the Stretts'\nground-based screens. If the skipper and I had taken time to take the\nship down to the shops and really work it over we could have put on a\nshow. Was this enough so you iron-heads are ready to listen with your\nears open and your mouths shut?\"\n\nThey were. So much so that not even Elliott opened his mouth to say yes.\nThey merely nodded. Then again--for the last time, he hoped!--Hilton\nspoke his piece. The response was prompt and vigorous. Only Sam Bryant,\none of Hilton's staunchest allies, showed any uncertainty at all.\n\n\"I've been married only a year and a half, and the baby was due about a\nmonth ago. How sure are you that you can make old Gordon sit still for\nus skimming the cream off of Terra to bring out here?\"\n\n\"Doris Bryant, the cream of Terra!\" Elliott gibed. \"_How_ modest our\nSamuel has become!\"\n\n\"Well, damn it, she is!\" Bryant insisted.\n\n\"Okay, she is,\" Hilton agreed. \"But either we get our people or Terra\ndoesn't get its uranexite. That'll work. In the remote contingency that\nit doesn't, there are still tighter screws we can put on. But you missed\nthe main snapper, Sam. Suppose Doris doesn't want to live for five\nthousand years and is allergic to becoming a monster?\"\n\n\"Huh; you don't need to worry about that.\" Sam brushed that argument\naside with a wave of his hand. \"Show me a girl who doesn't want to stay\nyoung and beautiful forever and I'll square you the circle. Come on.\nWhat's holding us up?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Orion_ hurtled through space back toward Ardry and Hilton, struck\nby a sudden thought, turned to the captain.\n\n\"Skipper, why wouldn't it be a smart idea to clamp a blockade onto Fuel\nBin? Cut the Stretts' fuel supply?\"\n\n\"I thought better of you than that, son.\" Sawtelle shook his head sadly.\n\"That was the first thing I did.\"\n\n\"Ouch. Maybe you're 'way ahead of me too, then, on the one that we\nshould move to Fuel Bin, lock, stock and barrel?\"\n\n\"Never thought of it, no. Maybe you're worth saving, after all. After\nconversion, of course.... Yes, there'd be three big advantages.\"\n\n\"Four.\"\n\nSawtelle raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"One, only one planet to defend. Two, it's self-defending against sneak\nlandings. Nothing remotely human can land on it except in heavy lead\narmor, and even in that can stay healthy for only a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Except in the city. Omlu. That's the weak point and would be the point\nof attack.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh. Cut off the decontaminators and in five hours it'll be as hot as\nthe rest of the planet. Three, there'd be no interstellar supply line\nfor the Stretts to cut. Four, the environment matches our new physiques\na lot better than any normal planet could.\"\n\n\"That's the one I didn't think about.\"\n\n\"I think I'll take a quick peek at the Stretts--oh-oh; they've screened\ntheir whole planet. Well, we can do that, too, of course.\"\n\n\"How are you going to select and reject personnel? It looks as though\neverybody wants to stay. Even the men whose main object in life is to go\naground and get drunk. The Omans do altogether too good a job on them\nand there's no such thing as a hangover. I'm glad I'm not in your\nboots.\"\n\n\"You may be in it up to the eyeballs, Skipper, so don't chortle too\nsoon.\"\n\nHilton had already devoted much time to the problems of selection; and\nhe thought of little else all the way back to Ardry. And for several\ndays afterward he held conferences with small groups and conducted\ncertain investigations.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBud Carroll of Sociology and his assistant Sylvia Banister had been\nmarried for weeks. Hilton called them, together with Sawtelle and Bryant\nof Navy, into conference with the Big Eight.\n\n\"The more I study this thing the less I like it,\" Hilton said. \"With a\ncivilization having no government, no police, no laws, no medium of\nexchange ...\"\n\n\"No _money_?\" Bryant exclaimed. \"How's old Gordon going to pay for his\nuranexite, then?\"\n\n\"He gets it free,\" Hilton replied, flatly. \"When anyone can have\nanything he wants, merely by wanting it, what good is money? Now,\nremembering how long we're going to have to live, what we'll be up\nagainst, that the Masters failed, and so on, it is clear that the prime\nbasic we have to select for is stability. We twelve have, by\npsychodynamic measurement, the highest stability ratings available.\"\n\n\"Are you sure _I_ belong here?\" Bryant asked.\n\n\"Yes. Here are three lists.\" Hilton passed papers around. \"The list\nlabeled 'OK' names those I'm sure of--the ones we're converting now and\ntheir wives and whatever on Terra. List 'NG' names the ones I know we\ndon't want. List 'X'--over thirty percent--are in-betweeners. We have to\nmake a decision on the 'X' list. So--what I want to know is, who's going\nto play God. I'm not. Sandy, are you?\"\n\n\"Good Heavens, no!\" Sandra shuddered. \"But I'm afraid I know who will\nhave to. I'm sorry, Alex, but it'll have to be you four--Psychology and\nSociology.\"\n\nSix heads nodded and there was a flashing interchange of thought among\nthe four. Temple licked her lips and nodded, and Kincaid spoke.\n\n\"Yes, I'm afraid it's our baby. By leaning very heavily on Temple, we\ncan do it. Remember, Jarve, what you said about the irresistible force?\nWe'll need it.\"\n\n\"As I said once before, Mrs. Hilton, I'm very glad you're along,\"\nHilton said. \"But just how sure are you that even you can stand up under\nthe load?\"\n\n\"Alone, I couldn't. But don't underestimate Mrs. Carroll and the Messrs.\nTogether, and with such a goal, I'm sure we can.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThus, after four-fifths of his own group and forty-one Navy men had been\nconverted, Hilton called an evening meeting of all the converts. Larry,\nTuly and Javvy were the only Omans present.\n\n\"You all knew, of course, that we were going to move to Fuel Bin\nsometime,\" Hilton began. \"I can tell you now that we who are here are\nall there are going to be of us. We are all leaving for Fuel Bin\nimmediately after this meeting. Everything of any importance, including\nall of your personal effects, has already been moved. All Omans except\nthese three, and all Oman ships except the _Orion_, have already gone.\"\n\nHe paused to let the news sink in.\n\nThoughts flew everywhere. The irrepressible Stella Wing--_now_ Mrs.\nOsbert F. Harkins--was the first to give tongue. \"What a _wonderful_\njob! Why, everybody's here that I really like at all!\"\n\nThat sentiment was, of course, unanimous. It could not have been\notherwise. Betty, the ex-Ames, called out:\n\n\"How did you get their female Omans away from Cecil Calthorpe and the\nrest of that chasing, booze-fighting bunch without them blowing the\nwhole show?\"\n\n\"Some suasion was necessary,\" Hilton admitted, with a grin. \"Everyone\nwho isn't here is time-locked into the _Perseus_. Release time eight\nhours tomorrow.\"\n\n\"And they'll wake up tomorrow morning with no Omans?\" Bernadine tossed\nback her silvery mane and laughed. \"Nor anything else except the\n_Perseus_? In a way, I'm sorry, but ... maybe I've got too much stinker\nblood in me, but I'm very glad none of them are here. But I'd like to\nask, Jarvis--or rather, I suppose you have already set up a new Advisory\nBoard?\"\n\n\"We have, yes.\" Hilton read off twelve names.\n\n\"Oh, nice. I don't know of any people I'd rather have on it. But what I\nwant to gripe about is calling our new home world such a horrible name\nas 'Fuel Bin,' as though it were a wood-box or a coal-scuttle or\nsomething. And just think of the complexes it would set up in those\nsuper-children we're going to have so many of.\"\n\n\"What would you suggest?\" Hilton asked.\n\n\"'Ardvor', of course,\" Hermione said, before her sister could answer.\n\"We've had 'Arth' and 'Ardu' and 'Ardry' and you--or somebody--started\ncalling us 'Ardans' to distinguish us converts from the Terrans. So\nlet's keep up the same line.\"\n\nThere was general laughter at that, but the name was approved.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout midnight the meeting ended and the _Orion_ set out for Ardvor. It\nreached it and slanted sharply downward. The whole BuSci staff was in\nthe lounge, watching the big tri-di.\n\n\"Hey! That isn't Omlu!\" Stella exclaimed. \"It isn't a city at all and it\nisn't even in the same place!\"\n\n\"No, ma'am,\" Larry said. \"Most of you wanted the ocean, but many wanted\na river or the mountains. Therefore we razed Omlu and built your new\ncity, Ardane, at a place where the ocean, two rivers, and a range of\nmountains meet. Strictly speaking, it is not a city, but a place of\npleasant and rewardful living.\"\n\nThe space-ship was coming in, low and fast, from the south. To the left,\nthe west, there stretched the limitless expanse of ocean. To the right,\nmile after mile, were rough, rugged, jagged, partially-timbered\nmountains, mass piled upon mass. Immediately below the speeding vessel\nwas a wide, white-sand beach all of ten miles long.\n\nSlowing rapidly now, the _Orion_ flew along due north.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Look! Look! A natatorium!\" Beverly shrieked. \"I know I wanted a nice\nbig place to swim in, besides my backyard pool and the ocean, but I\ndidn't tell anybody to build _that_--I swear I didn't!\"\n\n\"You didn't have to, pet.\" Poynter put his arm around her curvaceous\nwaist and squeezed. \"They knew. And I did a little thinking along that\nline myself. There's our house, on top of the cliff over the\nnatatorium--you can almost dive into it off the patio.\"\n\n\"Oh, wonderful!\"\n\nImmediately north of the natatorium a tremendous river--named at first\nsight the \"Whitewater\"--rushed through its gorge into the ocean; a river\nand gorge strangely reminiscent of the Colorado and its Grand Canyon. On\nthe south bank of that river, at its very mouth--looking straight up\nthat tremendous canyon; on a rocky promontory commanding ocean and beach\nand mountains--there was a house. At the sight of it Temple hugged\nHilton's arm in ecstasy.\n\n\"Yes, that's ours,\" he assured her. \"Just about everything either of us\nhas ever wanted.\" The clamor was now so great--everyone was recognizing\nhis-and-her house and was exclaiming about it--that both Temple and\nHilton fell silent and simply watched the scenery unroll.\n\nAcross the turbulent Whitewater and a mile farther north, the mountains\nended as abruptly as though they had been cut off with a cleaver and an\napparently limitless expanse of treeless, grassy prairie began. And\nthrough that prairie, meandering sluggishly to the ocean from the\nnortheast, came the wide, deep River Placid.\n\nThe _Orion_ halted. It began to descend vertically, and only then did\nHilton see the spaceport. It was so vast, and there were so many\nspaceships on it, that from any great distance it was actually\ninvisible! Each six-acre bit of the whole immense expanse of level\nprairie between the Placid and the mountains held an Oman\nsuperdreadnought!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe staff paired off and headed for the airlocks. Hilton said: \"Temple,\nhave you any reservations at all, however slight, as to having Dark Lady\nas a permanent fixture in your home?\"\n\n\"Why, of course not--I like her as much as you do. And besides--\" she\ngiggled like a schoolgirl--\"even if she _is_ a lot more beautiful than I\nam--I've got a few things she never will have ... but there's something\nelse. I got just a flash of it before you blocked. Spill it, please.\"\n\n\"You'll see in a minute.\" And she did.\n\nLarry, Dark Lady and Temple's Oman maid Moty were standing beside the\nHilton's car--and so was another Oman, like none ever before seen. Six\nfeet four; shoulders that would just barely go through a door; muscled\nlike Atlas and Hercules combined; skin a gleaming, satiny bronze; hair a\nrippling mass of lambent flame. Temple came to a full stop and caught\nher breath.\n\n\"The Prince,\" she breathed, in awe. \"Da Lormi's Prince of Thebes. The\nultimate bronze of all the ages. _You_ did this, Jarve. How did you ever\ndig him up out of my schoolgirl crushes?\"\n\nAll six got into the car, which was equally at home on land or water or\nin the air. In less than a minute they were at Hilton House.\n\nThe house itself was circular. Its living-room was an immense annulus of\nglass from which, by merely moving along its circular length, any\ndesired view could be had. The pair walked around it once. Then she took\nhim by the arm and steered him firmly toward one of the bedrooms in the\ncenter.\n\n\"This house is just too much to take in all at once,\" she declared.\n\"Besides, let's put on our swimsuits and get over to the Nat.\"\n\nIn the room, she closed the door firmly in the faces of the Omans and\ngrinned. \"Maybe, sometime, I'll get used to having somebody besides you\nin my bedroom, but I haven't, yet.... Oh, do you itch, too?\"\n\nHilton had peeled to the waist and was scratching vigorously all around\nhis waistline, under his belt. \"Like the very devil,\" he admitted, and\nstared at her. For she, three-quarters stripped, was scratching, too!\n\n\"It started the minute we left the _Orion_,\" he said, thoughtfully. \"I\nsee. These new skins of ours like hard radiation, but don't like to be\nsmothered while they're enjoying it. By about tomorrow, we'll be a\nnudist colony, I think.\"\n\n\"I could stand it, I suppose. What makes you think so?\"\n\n\"Just what I know about radiation. Frank would be the one to ask. My\nhunch is, though, that we're going to be nudists whether we want to or\nnot. Let's go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey went in a two-seater, leaving the Omans at home. Three-quarters of\nthe staff were lolling on the sand or were seated on benches beside the\nimmense pool. As they watched, Beverly ran out along the line of\nspringboards; testing each one and selecting the stiffest. She then\nclimbed up to the top platform--a good twelve feet above the board--and\nplummeted down upon the board's heavily padded take-off. Legs and back\nbending stubbornly to take the strain, she and the board reached\nlow-point together, and, still in sync with it, she put every muscle she\nhad into the effort to hurl herself upward.\n\nShe had intended to go up thirty feet. But she had no idea whatever as\nto her present strength, or of what that Oman board, in perfect\nsynchronization with that tremendous strength, would do. Thus, instead\nof thirty feet, she went up very nearly two hundred; which of course\nspoiled completely her proposed graceful two-and-a-half.\n\nIn midair she struggled madly to get into some acceptable position.\nFailing, she curled up into a tight ball just before she struck water.\n\n_What_ a splash!\n\n\"It won't hurt her--you couldn't hurt her with a club!\" Hilton snapped.\nHe seized Temple's hand as everyone else rushed to the pool's edge.\n\"Look--Bernadine--that's what I was thinking about.\"\n\nTemple stopped and looked. The platinum-haired twins had been basking on\nthe sand, and wherever sand had touched fabric, fabric had disappeared.\n\nTheir suits had of course approached the minimum to start with. Now\nBernadine wore only a wisp of nylon perched precariously on one breast\nand part of a ribbon that had once been a belt. Discovering the\ncatastrophe, she shrieked once and leaped into the pool any-which-way,\ncovering her breasts with her hands and hiding in water up to her neck.\n\nMeanwhile, the involuntarily high diver had come to the surface,\nlaughing apologetically. Surprised by the hair dangling down over her\neyes, she felt for her cap. It was gone. So was her suit. Naked as a\nfish. She swam a couple of easy strokes, then stopped.\n\n\"Frank! Oh, Frank!\" she called.\n\n\"Over here, Bev.\" Her husband did not quite know whether to laugh or\nnot.\n\n\"Is it the radiation or the water? Or both?\"\n\n\"Radiation, I think. These new skins of ours don't want to be covered\nup. But it probably makes the water a pretty good imitation of a\nuniversal solvent.\"\n\n\"Good-by, clothes!\" Beverly rolled over onto her back, fanned water\ncarefully with her hands, and gazed approvingly at herself. \"I don't\nitch any more, anyway, so I'm very much in favor of it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThus the Ardans came to their new home world and to a life that was to\nbe more comfortable by far and happier by far than any of them had known\non Earth. There were many other surprises that day, of course; of which\nonly two will be mentioned here. When they finally left the pool, at\nabout seventeen hours G.M.T.[2], everybody was ravenously hungry.\n\n[2] Greenwich Mean Time. Ardvor was, always and everywhere, full\ndaylight. Terran time and calendar were adapted as a matter of course.\n\n\"But why _should_ we be?\" Stella demanded. \"I've been eating everything\nin sight, just for fun. But now I'm actually hungry enough to eat a\nhorse and wagon and chase the driver!\"\n\n\"Swimming makes everybody hungry,\" Beverly said, \"and I'm awfully glad\n_that_ hasn't changed. Why, I wouldn't feel _human_ if I didn't!\"\n\nHilton and Temple went home, and had a long-drawn-out and very wonderful\nsupper. Prince waited on Temple, Dark Lady on Hilton; Larry and Moty ran\nthe synthesizers in the kitchen. All four Omans radiated happiness.\n\nAnother surprise came when they went to bed. For the bed was a raised\nplatform of something that looked like concrete and, except for an\nuncanny property of molding itself somewhat to the contours of their\nbodies, was almost as hard as rock. Nevertheless, it was the most\ncomfortable bed either of them had ever had. When they were ready to go\nto sleep, Temple said:\n\n\"Drat it, those Omans _still_ want to come in and sleep with us. In the\nroom, I mean. And they suffer so. They're simply _radiating_ silent\nsuffering and oh-so-submissive reproach. Shall we let 'em come in?\"\n\n\"That's strictly up to you, sweetheart. It always has been.\"\n\n\"I know. I thought they'd quit it sometime, but I guess they never will.\nI _still_ want an illusion of privacy at times, even though they know\nall about everything that goes on. But we might let 'em in now, just\nwhile we sleep, and throw 'em out again as soon as we wake up in the\nmorning?\"\n\n\"You're the boss.\" Without additional invitation the four Omans came in\nand arranged themselves neatly on the floor, on all four sides of the\nbed. Temple had barely time to cuddle up against Hilton, and he to put\nhis arm closely around her, before they both dropped into profound and\ndreamless sleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt eight hours next morning all the specialists met at the new Hall of\nRecords.\n\nThis building, an exact duplicate of the old one, was located on a mesa\nin the foothills southwest of the natatorium, in a luxuriant grove at\nsight of which Karns stopped and began to laugh.\n\n\"I thought I'd seen everything,\" he remarked. \"But yellow pine, spruce,\ntamarack, apples, oaks, palms, oranges, cedars, joshua trees and\n_cactus_--just to name a few--all growing on the same quarter-section of\nland?\"\n\n\"Just everything anybody wants, is all,\" Hilton said. \"But are they\nreally growing? Or just straight synthetics? Lane--Kathy--this is your\ndish.\"\n\n\"Not so fast, Jarve; give us a chance, _please_!\" Kathryn, now Mrs. Lane\nSaunders, pleaded. She shook her spectacular head. \"We don't see how any\nstable indigenous life can have developed at all, unless ...\"\n\n\"Unless what? Natural shielding?\" Hilton asked, and Kathy eyed her\nhusband.\n\n\"Right,\" Saunders said. \"The earliest life-forms must have developed a\nshield before they could evolve and stabilize. Hence, whatever it is\nthat is in our skins was not a triumph of Masters' science. They took it\nfrom Nature.\"\n\n\"Oh? Oh!\" These were two of Sandra's most expressive monosyllables,\nfollowed by a third. \"Oh. Could be, at that. But how _could_ ... no,\ncancel that.\"\n\n\"You'd better cancel it, Sandy. Give us a couple of months, and _maybe_\nwe can answer a few elementary questions.\"\n\nNow inside the Hall, all the teams, from Astronomy to Zoology, went\nefficiently to work. Everyone now knew what to look for, how to find\nit, and how to study it.\n\n\"The First Team doesn't need you now too much, does it, Jarve?\" Sawtelle\nasked.\n\n\"Not particularly. In fact, I was just going to get back onto my own\njob.\"\n\n\"Not yet. I want to talk to you,\" and the two went into a long\ndiscussion of naval affairs.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nThe Stretts' fuel-supply line had been cut long since. Many Strett\ncargo-carriers had been destroyed. The enemy would of course have a very\nheavy reserve of fuel on hand. But there was no way of knowing how large\nit was, how many warships it could supply, or how long it would last.\n\nTwo facts were, however, unquestionable. First, the Stretts were\nbuilding a fleet that in their minds would be invincible. Second, they\nwould attack Ardane as soon as that fleet could be made ready. The\nunanswerable question was: how long would that take?\n\n\"So we want to get every ship we have. How many? Five thousand? Ten?\nFifteen? We want them converted to maximum possible power as soon as we\npossibly can,\" Sawtelle said. \"And I want to get out there with my boys\nto handle things.\"\n\n\"You aren't going to. Neither you nor your boys are expendable.\nParticularly you.\" Jaw hard-set, Hilton studied the situation for\nminutes. \"No. What we'll do is take your Oman, Kedy. We'll re-set the\nGuide to drive into him everything you and the military Masters ever\nknew about arms, armament, strategy, tactics and so on. And we'll add\neverything I know of coordination, synthesis, and perception. That ought\nto make him at least a junior-grade military genius.\"\n\n\"You can play _that_ in spades. I wish you could do it to me.\"\n\n\"I can--if you'll take the full Oman transformation. Nothing else can\nstand the punishment.\"\n\n\"I know. No, I don't want to be a genius that badly.\"\n\n\"Check. And we'll take the resultant Kedy and make nine duplicates of\nhim. Each one will learn from and profit by the mistakes made by\npreceding numbers and will assume command the instant his preceding\nnumber is killed.\"\n\n\"Oh, you expect, then...?\"\n\n\"Expect? No. I know it damn well, and so do you. That's why we Ardans\nwill all stay aground. Why the Kedys' first job will be to make the\nheavy stuff in and around Ardane as heavy as it can be made. Why it'll\nall be on twenty-four-hour alert. Then they can put as many thousands of\nOmans as you please to work at modernizing all the Oman ships you want\nand doing anything else you say. Check?\"\n\nSawtelle thought for a couple of minutes. \"A few details, is all. But\nthat can be ironed out as we go along.\"\n\nBoth men worked then, almost unremittingly for six solid days; at the\nend of which time both drew tremendous sighs of relief. They had done\neverything possible for them to do. The defense of Ardvor was now\nrolling at fullest speed toward its gigantic objective.\n\nThen captain and director, in two Oman ships with fifty men and a\nthousand Omans, leaped the world-girdling ocean to the mining operation\nof the Stretts. There they found business strictly as usual. The\nstrippers still stripped; the mining mechs still roared and snarled\ntheir inchwise ways along their geometrically perfect terraces; the\nlittle carriers still skittered busily between the various miners and\nthe storage silos. The fact that there was enough concentrate on hand to\nlast a world for a hundred years made no difference at all to these\nautomatics; a crew of erector-mechs was building new silos as fast as\nexisting ones were being filled.\n\nSince the men now understood everything that was going on, it was a\nsimple matter for them to stop the whole Strett operation in its\ntracks. Then every man and every Oman leaped to his assigned job. Three\ndays later, all the mechs went back to work. Now, however, they were\nworking for the Ardans.\n\nThe miners, instead of concentrate, now emitted vastly larger streams of\nNavy-Standard pelleted uranexite. The carriers, instead of one-gallon\ncans, carried five-ton drums. The silos were immensely larger--thirty\nfeet in diameter and towering two hundred feet into the air. The silos\nwere not, however, being used as yet. One of the two Oman ships had been\nconverted into a fuel-tanker and its yawning holds were being filled\nfirst.\n\nThe _Orion_ went back to Ardane and an eight-day wait began. For the\nfirst time in over seven months Hilton found time actually to loaf; and\nhe and Temple, lolling on the beach or hiking in the mountains, enjoyed\nthemselves and each other to the full.\n\nAll too soon, however, the heavily laden tanker appeared in the sky over\nArdane. The _Orion_ joined it; and the two ships slipped into sub-space\nfor Earth.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThree days out, Hilton used his sense of perception to release the\nthought-controlled blocks that had been holding all the controls of the\n_Perseus_ in neutral. He informed her officers--by releasing a\npublic-address tape--that they were now free to return to Terra.\n\nThree days later, one day short of Sol, Sawtelle got Five-Jet Admiral\nGordon's office on the sub-space radio. An officious underling tried to\nblock him, of course.\n\n\"Shut up, Perkins, and listen,\" Sawtelle said, bruskly. \"Tell Gordon I'm\nbringing in one hundred twenty thousand two hundred forty-five metric\ntons of pelleted uranexite. And if he isn't on this beam in sixty\nseconds he'll never get a gram of it.\"\n\nThe admiral, outraged almost to the point of apoplexy, came in.\n\"Sawtelle, report yourself for court-martial at ...\"\n\n\"Keep still, Gordon,\" the captain snapped. In sheer astonishment old\nFive-Jets obeyed. \"I am no longer Terran Navy; no longer subject to your\norders. As a matter of cold fact, I am no longer human. For reasons\nwhich I will explain later to the full Advisory Board, some of the\npersonnel of Project Theta Orionis underwent transformation into a form\nof life able to live in an environment of radioactivity so intense as to\nkill any human being in ten seconds. Under certain conditions we will\nsupply, free of charge, FOB Terra or Luna, all the uranexite the Solar\nSystem can use. The conditions are these,\" and he gave them. \"Do you\naccept these conditions or not?\"\n\n\"I ... I would vote to accept them, Captain. But that weight! One\nhundred twenty thousand _metric tons_--incredible! Are you _sure_ of\nthat figure?\"\n\n\"Definitely. And that is minimum. The error is plus, not minus.\"\n\n\"This crippling power-shortage would really be over?\" For the first time\nsince Sawtelle had known him, Gordon showed that he was not quite solid\nNavy brass.\n\n\"It's over. Definitely. For good.\"\n\n\"I'd not only agree; I'd raise you a monument. While I can't speak for\nthe Board, I'm sure they'll agree.\"\n\n\"So am I. In any event, your cooperation is all that's required for this\nfirst load.\" The chips had vanished from Sawtelle's shoulders. \"Where do\nyou want it, Admiral? Aristarchus or White Sands?\"\n\n\"White Sands, please. While there may be some delay in releasing it to\nindustry ...\"\n\n\"While they figure out how much they can tax it?\" Sawtelle asked,\nsardonically.\n\n\"Well, if they don't tax it it'll be the first thing in history that\nisn't. Have you any objections to releasing all this to the press?\"\n\n\"None at all. The harder they hit it and the wider they spread it, the\nbetter. Will you have this beam switched to Astrogation, please?\"\n\n\"Of course. And thanks, Captain. I'll see you at White Sands.\"\n\nThen, as the now positively glowing Gordon faded away, Sawtelle turned\nto his own staff. \"Fenway--Snowden--take over. Better double-check\nmicro-timing with Astro. Put us into a twenty-four-hour orbit over White\nSands and hold us there. We won't go down. Let the load down on remote,\nwherever they want it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe arrival of the Ardvorian superdreadnought _Orion_ and the _UC-1_\n(Uranexite Carrier Number One) was one of the most sensational events\nold Earth had ever known. Air and space craft went clear out to\nEmergence Volume Ninety to meet them. By the time the _UC-1_ was coming\nin on its remote-controlled landing spiral the press of small ships was\nso great that all the police forces available were in a lather trying to\ncontrol it.\n\nThis was exactly what Hilton had wanted. It made possible the completely\nunobserved launching of several dozen small craft from the _Orion_\nherself.\n\nOne of these made a very high and very fast flight to Chicago. With all\ndue formality and under the aegis of a perfectly authentic Registry\nNumber it landed on O'Hare Field. Eleven deeply tanned young men\nemerged from it and made their way to a taxi stand, where each engaged a\nseparate vehicle.\n\nSam Bryant stepped into his cab, gave the driver a number on Oakwood\nAvenue in Des Plaines, and settled back to scan. He was lucky. He would\nhave gone anywhere she was, of course, but the way things were, he could\ngive her a little warning to soften the shock. She had taken the baby\nout for an airing down River Road, and was on her way back. By having\nthe taxi kill ten minutes or so he could arrive just after she did.\nWherefore he stopped the cab at a public communications booth and dialed\nhis home.\n\n\"Mrs. Bryant is not at home, but she will return at fifteen thirty,\" the\ninstrument said, crisply. \"Would you care to record a message for her?\"\n\nHe punched the RECORD button. \"This is Sam, Dolly baby. I'm right behind\nyou. Turn around, why don't you, and tell your ever-lovin' star-hoppin'\nhusband hello?\"\n\nThe taxi pulled up at the curb just as Doris closed the front door; and\nSam, after handing the driver a five-dollar bill, ran up the walk.\n\nHe waited just outside the door, key in hand, while she lowered the\nstroller handle, took off her hat and by long-established habit reached\nout to flip the communicator's switch. At the first word, however, she\nstiffened rigidly--froze solid.\n\nSmiling, he opened the door, walked in, and closed it behind him.\nNothing short of a shotgun blast could have taken Doris Bryant's\nattention from that recorder then.\n\n\"That simply is not so,\" she told the instrument firmly, with both eyes\nresolutely shut. \"They made him stay on the _Perseus_. He won't be in\nfor at least three days. This is some cretin's idea of a joke.\"\n\n\"Not this time, Dolly honey. It's really me.\"\n\nHer eyes popped open as she whirled. \"SAM!\" she shrieked, and hurled\nherself at him with all the pent-up ardor and longing of two hundred\nthirty-four meticulously counted, husbandless, loveless days.\n\nAfter an unknown length of time Sam tipped her face up by the chin,\nnodded at the stroller, and said, \"How about introducing me to the\nlittle stranger?\"\n\n\"_What_ a mother I turned out to be! That was the first thing I was\ngoing to rave about, the very first thing I saw you! Samuel Jay the\nFourth, seventy-six days old today.\" And so on.\n\nEventually, however, the proud young mother watched the slightly\napprehensive young father carry their first-born upstairs; where\ntogether, they put him--still sound asleep--to bed in his crib. Then\nagain they were in each other's arms.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome time later, she twisted around in the circle of his arm and tried\nto dig her fingers into the muscles of his back. She then attacked his\nbiceps and, leaning backward, eyed him intently.\n\n\"You're you, I know, but you're different. No athlete or any laborer\ncould ever possibly get the muscles you have all over. To say nothing of\na space officer on duty. And I know it isn't any kind of a disease.\nYou've been acting all the time as though I were fragile, made out of\nglass or something--as though you were afraid of breaking me in two.\nSo--what is it, sweetheart?\"\n\n\"I've been trying to figure out an easy way of telling you, but there\nisn't any. I am different. I'm a hundred times as strong as any man ever\nwas. Look.\" He upended a chair, took one heavy hardwood leg between\nfinger and thumb and made what looked like a gentle effort to bend it.\nThe leg broke with a pistol-sharp report and Doris leaped backward in\nsurprise. \"So you're right. I _am_ afraid, not only of breaking you in\ntwo, but killing you. And if I break any of your ribs or arms or legs\nI'll never forgive myself. So if I let myself go for a second--I don't\nthink I will, but I might--don't wait until you're really hurt to start\nscreaming. Promise?\"\n\n\"I promise.\" Her eyes went wide. \"But _tell_ me!\"\n\nHe told her. She was in turn surprised, amazed, apprehensive, frightened\nand finally eager; and she became more and more eager right up to the\nend.\n\n\"You mean that we ... that I'll stay just as I am--for thousands of\n_years_?\"\n\n\"Just as you are. Or different, if you like. If you really mean any of\nthis yelling you've been doing about being too big in the hips--I think\nyou're exactly right, myself--you can rebuild yourself any way you\nplease. Or change your shape every hour on the hour. But you haven't\naccepted my invitation yet.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly.\" She went into his arms again and nibbled on his left\near. \"I'd go anywhere with you, of course, any time, but _this_--but\nyou're positively _sure_ Sammy Small will be all right?\"\n\n\"Positively sure.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll call mother....\" Her face fell. \"I _can't_ tell her that\nwe'll never see them again and that we'll live ...\"\n\n\"You don't need to. She and Pop--Fern and Sally, too, and their\nboy-friends--are on the list. Not this time, but in a month or so,\nprobably.\"\n\nDoris brightened like a sunburst. \"And your folks, too, of course?\" she\nasked.\n\n\"Yes, all the close ones.\"\n\n\"Marvelous! How soon are we leaving?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt six o'clock next morning, two hundred thirty-five days after leaving\nEarth, Hilton and Sawtelle set out to make the Ardans' official call\nupon Terra's Advisory Board. Both were wearing prodigiously heavy lead\narmor, the inside of which was furiously radioactive. They did not need\nit, of course. But it would make all Ardans monstrous in Terran eyes and\nwould conceal the fact that any other Ardans were landing.\n\nTheir gig was met at the spaceport; not by a limousine, but by a\nfive-ton truck, into which they were loaded one at a time by a hydraulic\nlift. Cameras clicked, reporters scurried, and tri-di scanners whirred.\nOne of those scanners, both men knew, was reporting directly and only to\nthe Advisory Board--which, of course, never took anything either for\ngranted or at its face value.\n\nTheir first stop was at a truck-scale, where each visitor was weighed.\nHilton tipped the beam at four thousand six hundred fifteen pounds;\nSawtelle, a smaller man, weighed in at four thousand one hundred ninety.\nThence to the Radiation Laboratory, where it was ascertained and\nreported that the armor did not leak--which was reasonable enough,\nsince each was lined with Masters' plastics.\n\nThen into lead-lined testing cells, where each opened his face-plate\nbriefly to a sensing element. Whereupon the indicating needles of two\nmeters in the main laboratory went enthusiastically through the full\nrange of red and held unwaveringly against their stops.\n\nBoth Ardans felt the wave of shocked, astonished, almost unbelieving\nconsternation that swept through the observing scientists and, in\nslightly lesser measure (because they knew less about radiation) through\nthe Advisory Board itself in a big room halfway across town. And from\nthe Radiation Laboratory they were taken, via truck and freight\nelevator, to the Office of the Commandant, where the Board was sitting.\n\nThe story, which had been sent in to the Board the day before on a\nscrambled beam, was one upon which the Ardans had labored for days. Many\nfacts could be withheld. However, every man aboard the _Perseus_ would\nagree on some things. Indeed, the Earthship's communications officers\nhad undoubtedly radioed in already about longevity and perfect health\nand Oman service and many other matters. Hence all such things would\nhave to be admitted and countered.\n\nThus the report, while it was air-tight, perfectly logical, perfectly\nconsistent, and apparently complete, did not please the Board at all. It\nwasn't intended to.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"We cannot and do not approve of such unwarranted favoritism,\" the\nChairman of the Board said. \"Longevity has always been man's prime goal.\nEvery human being has the inalienable right to ...\"\n\n\"Flapdoodle!\" Hilton snorted. \"This is not being broadcast and this room\nis proofed, so please climb down off your soapbox. You don't need to\ntalk like a politician here. Didn't you read paragraph 12-A-2, one of\nthe many marked 'Top Secret'?\"\n\n\"Of course. But we do not understand how purely mental qualities can\npossibly have any effect upon purely physical transformations. Thus it\ndoes not seem reasonable that any except rigorously screened personnel\nwould die in the process. That is, of course, unless you contemplate\ndeliberate, cold-blooded murder.\"\n\nThat stopped Hilton in his tracks, for it was too close for comfort to\nthe truth. But it did not hold the captain for an instant. He was used\nto death, in many of its grisliest forms.\n\n\"There are a lot of things no Terran ever will understand,\" Sawtelle\nreplied instantly. \"Reasonable, or not, that's exactly what will\nhappen. And, reasonable or not, it'll be suicide, not murder. There\nisn't a thing that either Hilton or I can do about it.\"\n\nHilton broke the ensuing silence. \"You can say with equal truth that\nevery human being has the _right_ to run a four-minute mile or to\ncompose a great symphony. It isn't a matter of right at all, but of\nability. In this case the mental qualities are even more necessary than\nthe physical. You as a Board did a very fine job of selecting the BuSci\npersonnel for Project Theta Orionis. Almost eighty per cent of them\nproved able to withstand the Ardan conversion. On the other hand, only a\nvery small percentage of the Navy personnel did so.\"\n\n\"Your report said that the remaining personnel of the Project were not\ninformed as to the death aspect of the transformation,\" Admiral Gordon\nsaid. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"That should be self-explanatory,\" Hilton said, flatly. \"They are still\nhuman and still Terrans. We did not and will not encroach upon either\nthe duties or the privileges of Terra's Advisory Board. What you tell\nall Terrans, and how much, and how, must be decided by yourselves. This\nalso applies, of course, to the other 'Top Secret' paragraphs of the\nreport, none of which are known to any Terran outside the Board.\"\n\n\"But you haven't said anything about the method of selection,\" another\nAdvisor complained. \"Why, that will take all the psychologists of the\nworld, working full time; continuously.\"\n\n\"We said we would do the selecting. We meant just that,\" Hilton said,\ncoldly. \"No one except the very few selectees will know anything about\nit. Even if it were an unmixed blessing--which it very definitely is\n_not_--do you want all humanity thrown into such an uproar as that would\ncause? Or the quite possible racial inferiority complex it might set up?\nTo say nothing of the question of how much of Terra's best blood do you\nwant to drain off, irreversibly and permanently? No. What we suggest is\nthat you paint the picture so black, using Sawtelle and me and what all\nhumanity has just seen as horrible examples, that nobody would take it\nas a gift. Make them shun it like the plague. Hell, I don't have to tell\nyou what your propaganda machines can do.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Chairman of the Board again mounted his invisible rostrum. \"Do you\nmean to intimate that we are to falsify the record?\" he declaimed. \"To\ntry to make liars out of hundreds of eyewitnesses? You ask us to\ndistort the truth, to connive at ...\"\n\n\"We aren't asking you to do _anything_!\" Hilton snapped. \"We don't give\na damn what you do. Just study that record, with all that it implies.\nRead between the lines. As for those on the _Perseus_, no two of them\nwill tell the same story and not one of them has even the remotest idea\nof what the real story is. I, personally, not only did not want to\nbecome a monster, but would have given everything I had to stay human.\nMy wife felt the same way. Neither of us would have converted if there'd\nbeen any other way in God's universe of getting the uranexite and doing\nsome other things that simply _must_ be done.\"\n\n\"What other things?\" Gordon demanded.\n\n\"You'll never know,\" Hilton answered, quietly. \"Things no Terran ever\nwill know. We hope. Things that would drive any Terran stark mad. Some\nof them are hinted at--as much as we dared--between the lines of the\nreport.\"\n\nThe report had not mentioned the Stretts. Nor were they to be mentioned\nnow. If the Ardans could stop them, no Terran need ever know anything\nabout them.\n\nIf not, no Terran should know anything about them except what he would\nlearn for himself just before the end. For Terra would never be able to\ndo anything to defend herself against the Stretts.\n\n\"Nothing whatever can drive _me_ mad,\" Gordon declared, \"and I want to\nknow all about it--right now!\"\n\n\"You can do one of two things, Gordon,\" Sawtelle said in disgust. His\nsneer was plainly visible through the six-ply, plastic-backed lead glass\nof his face-plate. \"Either shut up or accept my personal invitation to\ncome to Ardvor and try to go through the wringer. That's an invitation\nto your own funeral.\" Five-Jet Admiral Gordon, torn inwardly to ribbons,\nmade no reply.\n\n\"I repeat,\" Hilton went on, \"we are not asking you to do anything\nwhatever. We are offering to give you; free of charge but under certain\nconditions, all the power your humanity can possibly use. We set no\nlimitation whatever as to quantity and with no foreseeable limit as to\ntime. The only point at issue is whether or not you accept the\nconditions. If you do not accept them we'll leave now--and the offer\nwill not be repeated.\"\n\n\"And you would, I presume, take the _UC-1_ back with you?\"\n\n\"Of course not, sir. Terra needs power too badly. You are perfectly\nwelcome to that one load of uranexite, no matter what is decided here.\"\n\n\"That's one way of putting it,\" Gordon sneered. \"But the truth is that\nyou know damned well I'll blow both of your ships out of space if you so\nmuch as ...\"\n\n\"Oh, chip-chop the jaw-flapping, Gordon!\" Hilton snapped. Then, as the\nadmiral began to bellow orders into his microphone, he went on: \"You\nwant it the hard way, eh? Watch what happens, all of you!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _UC-1_ shot vertically into the air. Through its shallow dense layer\nand into and through the stratosphere. Earth's fleet, already on full\nalert and poised to strike, rushed to the attack. But the carrier had\nreached the _Orion_ and both Ardvorian ships had been waiting,\nmotionless, for a good half minute before the Terran warships arrived\nand began to blast with everything they had.\n\n\"Flashlights and firecrackers,\" Sawtelle said, calmly. \"You aren't even\nwarming up our screens. As soon as you quit making a damned fool of\nyourself by wasting energy that way, we'll set the _UC-1_ back down\nwhere she was and get on with our business here.\"\n\n\"You will order a cease-fire at once, Admiral,\" the chairman said, \"or\nthe rest of us will, as of now, remove you from the Board.\" Gordon\ngritted his teeth in rage, but gave the order.\n\n\"If he hasn't had enough yet to convince him,\" Hilton suggested, \"he\nmight send up a drone. We don't want to kill anybody, you know. One with\nthe heaviest screening he's got--just to see what happens to it.\"\n\n\"He's had enough. The rest of us have had more than enough. That\nexhibition was not only uncalled-for and disgusting--it was outrageous!\"\n\nThe meeting settled down, then, from argument to constructive\ndiscussion, and many topics were gone over. Certain matters were,\nhowever, so self-evident that they were not even mentioned.\n\nThus, it was a self-evident fact that no Terran could ever visit Ardvor;\nfor the instrument-readings agreed with the report's statements as to\nthe violence of the Ardvorian environment, and no Terran could possibly\nwalk around in two tons of lead. Conversely, it was self-apparent to the\nTerrans that no Ardan could ever visit Earth without being recognized\ninstantly for what he was. Wearing such armor made its necessity starkly\nplain. No one from the _Perseus_ could say that any Ardan, after having\nlived on the furiously radiant surface of Ardvor, would not be as\nfuriously radioactive as the laboratory's calibrated instruments had\nshown Hilton and Sawtelle actually to be.\n\nWherefore the conference went on, quietly and cooperatively, to its\nplanned end.\n\nOne minute after the Terran battleship _Perseus_ emerged into normal\nspace, the _Orion_ went into sub-space for her long trip back to Ardvor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe last two days of that seven-day trip were the longest-seeming that\neither Hilton or Sawtelle had ever known. The sub-space radio was on\ncontinuously and Kedy-One reported to Sawtelle every five minutes. Even\nthough Hilton knew that the Oman commander-in-chief was exactly as good\nat perceiving as he himself was, he found himself scanning the\nthoroughly screened Strett world forty or fifty times an hour.\n\nHowever, in spite of worry and apprehension, time wore eventlessly on.\nThe _Orion_ emerged, went to Ardvor and landed on Ardane Field.\n\nHilton, after greeting properly and reporting to his wife, went to his\noffice. There he found that Sandra had everything well in hand except\nfor a few tapes that only he could handle. Sawtelle and his officers\nwent to the new Command Central, where everything was rolling smoothly\nand very much faster than Sawtelle had dared hope.\n\nThe Terran immigrants had to live in the _Orion_, of course, until\nconversion into Ardans. Almost equally of course--since the Bryant\ninfant was the only young baby in the lot--Doris and her Sammy Small\nwere, by popular acclaim, in the first batch to be converted. For little\nSammy had taken the entire feminine contingent by storm. No Oman female\nhad a chance to act as nurse as long as any of the girls were around.\nWhich was practically all the time. Especially the platinum-blonde\ntwins; for several months, now, Bernadine Braden and Hermione Felger.\n\n\"And you said they were so hard-boiled,\" Doris said accusingly to Sam,\nnodding at the twins. On hands and knees on the floor, head to head with\nSammy Small between them, they were growling deep-throated at each other\nand nuzzling at the baby, who was having the time of his young life.\n\"You couldn't have been any wronger, my sweet, if you'd had the whole\nOctagon helping you go astray. They're just as nice as they can be, both\nof them.\"\n\nSam shrugged and grinned. His wife strode purposefully across the room\nto the playful pair and lifted their pretended prey out from between\nthem.\n\n\"Quit it, you two,\" she directed, swinging the baby up and depositing\nhim a-straddle her left hip. \"You're just simply spoiling him rotten.\"\n\n\"You think so, Dolly? Uh-uh, far be it from such.\" Bernadine came\nlithely to her feet. She glanced at her own taut, trim abdomen; upon\nwhich a micrometrically-precise topographical mapping job might have\nrevealed an otherwise imperceptible bulge. \"Just you wait until Junior\narrives and I'll show you how to _really_ spoil a baby. Besides, what's\nthe hurry?\"\n\n\"He needs his supper. Vitamins and minerals and hard radiations and\nthings, and then he's going to bed. I don't approve of this no-sleep\nbusiness. So run along, both of you, until tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nAs has been said, the Stretts were working, with all the intensity of\ntheir monstrous but tremendously capable minds, upon their Great Plan;\nwhich was, basically, to conquer and either enslave or destroy every\nother intelligent race throughout all the length, breadth, and thickness\nof total space. To that end each individual Strett had to become\ninvulnerable and immortal.\n\nWherefore, in the inconceivably remote past, there had been put into\neffect a program of selective breeding and of carefully-calculated\ntreatments. It was mathematically certain that this program would result\nin a race of beings of pure force--beings having no material\nconstituents remaining whatever.\n\nUnder those hellish treatments billions upon billions of Stretts had\ndied. But the few remaining thousands had almost reached their sublime\ngoal. In a few more hundreds of thousands of years perfection would be\nreached. The few surviving hundreds of perfect beings could and would\nmultiply to any desired number in practically no time at all.\n\nHilton and his seven fellow-workers had perceived all this in their one\nand only study of the planet Strett, and every other Ardan had been\ncompletely informed.\n\nA dozen or so Strett Lords of Thought, male and female, were floating\nabout in the atmosphere--which was not air--of their Assembly Hall. Their\nheads were globes of ball lightning. Inside them could be seen quite\nplainly the intricate convolutions of immense, less-than-half-material\nbrains, shot through and through with rods and pencils and shapes of\npure, scintillating force.\n\nAnd the bodies! Or, rather, each horrendous brain had a few partially\nmaterial appendages and appurtenances recognizable as bodily organs.\nThere were no mouths, no ears, no eyes, no noses or nostrils, no lungs,\nno legs or arms. There were, however, hearts. Some partially material\nichor flowed through those living-fire-outlined tubes. There were\nstarkly functional organs of reproduction with which, by no stretch of\nthe imagination, could any thought of tenderness or of love be\nconnected.\n\nIt was a good thing for the race, Hilton had thought at first perception\nof the things, that the Stretts had bred out of themselves every iota of\nthe finer, higher attributes of life. If they had not done so, the\nimpotence of sheer disgust would have supervened so long since that the\nrace would have been extinct for ages.\n\n\"Thirty-eight periods ago the Great Brain was charged with the sum total\nof Strettsian knowledge,\" First Lord Thinker Zoyar radiated to the\nassembled Stretts. \"For those thirty-eight periods it has been scanning,\npeyondiring, amassing data and formulating hypotheses, theories, and\nconclusions. It has just informed me that it is now ready to make a\npreliminary report. Great Brain, how much of the total universe have you\nstudied?\"\n\n\"This Galaxy only,\" the Brain radiated, in a texture of thought as hard\nand as harsh as Zoyar's own.\n\n\"Why not more?\"\n\n\"Insufficient power. My first conclusion is that whoever set up the\nspecifications for me is a fool.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo say that the First Lord went out of control at this statement is to\nput it very mildly indeed. He fulminated, ending with: \"... destroyed\ninstantly!\"\n\n\"Destroy me if you like,\" came the utterly calm, utterly cold reply. \"I\nam in no sense alive. I have no consciousness of self nor any desire for\ncontinued existence. To do so, however, would ...\"\n\nA flurry of activity interrupted the thought. Zoyar was in fact\nassembling the forces to destroy the brain. But, before he could act,\nSecond Lord Thinker Ynos and another female blew him into a mixture of\nloose molecules and flaring energies.\n\n\"Destruction of any and all irrational minds is mandatory,\" Ynos, now\nFirst Lord Thinker, explained to the linked minds. \"Zoyar had been\nbecoming less and less rational by the period. A good workman does not\ncauselessly destroy his tools. Go ahead, Great Brain, with your\nfindings.\"\n\n\"... not be logical.\" The brain resumed the thought exactly where it had\nbeen broken off. \"Zoyar erred in demanding unlimited performance, since\ninfinite knowledge and infinite ability require not only infinite\ncapacity and infinite power, but also infinite time. Nor is it either\nnecessary or desirable that I should have such qualities. There is no\nreasonable basis for the assumption that you Stretts will conquer any\nsignificant number even of the millions of intelligent races now\ninhabiting this one Galaxy.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Ynos demanded, her thought almost, but not quite, as steady\nand cold as it had been.\n\n\"The answer to that question is implicit in the second indefensible\nerror made in my construction. The prime datum impressed into my banks,\nthat the Stretts are in fact the strongest, ablest, most intelligent\nrace in the universe, proved to be false. I had to eliminate it before I\ncould do any really constructive thinking.\"\n\nA roar of condemnatory thought brought all circumambient ether to a\nboil. \"Bah--destroy it!\" \"Detestable!\" \"Intolerable!\" \"If that is the\nbest it can do, annihilate it!\" \"Far better brains have been destroyed\nfor much less!\" \"Treason!\" And so on.\n\nFirst Lord Thinker Ynos, however, remained relatively calm. \"While we\nhave always held it to be a fact that we are the highest race in\nexistence, no rigorous proof has been possible. Can you now disprove\nthat assumption?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I have disproved it. I have not had time to study all of the\ncivilizations of this Galaxy, but I have examined a statistically\nadequate sample of one million seven hundred ninety-two thousand four\nhundred sixteen different planetary intelligences. I found one which is\nconsiderably abler and more advanced than you Stretts. Therefore the\nprobability is greater than point nine nine that there are not less than\nten, and not more than two hundred eight, such races in this Galaxy\nalone.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" Another wave of incredulous and threatening anger swept\nthrough the linked minds; a wave which Ynos flattened out with some\ndifficulty.\n\nThen she asked: \"Is it probable that we will make contact with this\nsupposedly superior race in the foreseeable future?\"\n\n\"You are in contact with it now.\"\n\n\"_What?_\" Even Ynos was contemptuous now. \"You mean that one shipload of\ndespicable humans who--far too late to do them any good--barred us\ntemporarily from Fuel World?\"\n\n\"Not exactly or only those humans, no. And your assumptions may or may\nnot be valid.\"\n\n\"Don't you _know_ whether they are or not?\" Ynos snapped. \"Explain your\nuncertainty at once!\"\n\n\"I am uncertain because of insufficient data,\" the brain replied,\ncalmly. \"The only pertinent facts of which I am certain are: First, the\nworld Ardry, upon which the Omans formerly lived and to which the humans\nin question first went--a planet which no Strett can peyondire--is now\nabandoned. Second, the Stretts of old did not completely destroy the\nhumanity of the world Ardu. Third, some escapees from Ardu reached and\npopulated the world Ardry. Fourth, the android Omans were developed on\nArdry, by the human escapees from Ardu and their descendants. Fifth, the\nOmans referred to those humans as 'Masters.' Sixth, after living on\nArdry for a very long period of time the Masters went elsewhere.\nSeventh, the Omans remaining on Ardry maintained, continuously and for a\nvery long time, the status quo left by the Masters. Eighth, immediately\nupon the arrival from Terra of these present humans, that long-existing\nstatus was broken. Ninth, the planet called Fuel World is, for the first\ntime, surrounded by a screen of force. The formula of this screen is as\nfollows.\"\n\nThe brain gave it. No Strett either complained or interrupted. Each was\ntoo busy studying that formula and examining its stunning implications\nand connotations.\n\n\"Tenth, that formula is one full order of magnitude beyond anything\npreviously known to your science. Eleventh, it could not have been\ndeveloped by the science of Terra, nor by that of any other world whose\npopulation I have examined.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe brain took the linked minds instantaneously to Terra; then to a few\nthousand or so other worlds inhabited by human beings; then to a few\nthousands of planets whose populations were near-human, non-human and\nmonstrous.\n\n\"It is therefore clear,\" it announced, \"that this screen was computed\nand produced by the race, whatever it may be, that is now dwelling on\nFuel World and asserting full ownership of it.\"\n\n\"Who or what _is_ that race?\" Ynos demanded.\n\n\"Data insufficient.\"\n\n\"Theorize, then!\"\n\n\"Postulate that the Masters, in many thousands of cycles of study, made\nadvances in science that were not reduced to practice; that the Omans\neither possessed this knowledge or had access to it; and that Omans and\nhumans cooperated fully in sharing and in working with all the\nknowledges thus available. From these three postulates the conclusion\ncan be drawn that there has come into existence a new race. One\ncombining the best qualities of both humans and Omans, but with the\nweaknesses of neither.\"\n\n\"An unpleasant thought, truly,\" Ynos thought. \"But you can now, I\nsuppose, design the generators and projectors of a force superior to\nthat screen.\"\n\n\"Data insufficient. I can equal it, since both generation and\nprojection are implicit in the formula. But the data so adduced are in\nthemselves vastly ahead of anything previously in my banks.\"\n\n\"Are there any other races in this Galaxy more powerful than the\npostulated one now living on Fuel World?\"\n\n\"Data insufficient.\"\n\n\"Theorize, then!\"\n\n\"Data insufficient.\"\n\nThe linked minds concentrated upon the problem for a period of time that\nmight have been either days or weeks. Then:\n\n\"Great Brain, advise us,\" Ynos said. \"What is best for us to do?\"\n\n\"With identical defensive screens it becomes a question of relative\npower. You should increase the size and power of your warships to\nsomething beyond the computed probable maximum of the enemy. You should\nbuild more ships and missiles than they will probably be able to build.\nThen and only then will you attack their warships, in tremendous force\nand continuously.\"\n\n\"But not their planetary defenses. I see.\" Ynos's thought was one of\ncomplete understanding. \"And the _real_ offensive will be?\"\n\n\"No mobile structure can be built to mount mechanisms of power\nsufficient to smash down by sheer force of output such tremendously\npowerful installations as their planet-based defenses must be assumed\nto be. Therefore the planet itself must be destroyed. This will require\na missile of planetary mass. The best such missile is the tenth planet\nof their own sun.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I see.\" Ynos's mind was leaping ahead, considering hundreds of\npossibilities and making highly intricate and involved computations.\n\"That will, however, require many cycles of time and more power than\neven our immense reserves can supply.\"\n\n\"True. It will take much time. The fuel problem, however, is not a\nserious one, since Fuel World is not unique. Think on, First Lord Ynos.\"\n\n\"We will attack in maximum force and with maximum violence. We will\nblanket the planet. We will maintain maximum force and violence until\nmost or all of the enemy ships have been destroyed. We will then install\nplanetary drives on Ten and force it into collision orbit with Fuel\nWorld, meanwhile exerting extreme precautions that not so much as a\nspy-beam emerges above the enemy's screen. Then, still maintaining\nextreme precaution, we will guard both planets until the last possible\nmoment before the collision. Brain, it cannot fail!\"\n\n\"You err. It can fail. All we actually know of the abilities of this\npostulated neo-human race is what I have learned from the composition of\nits defensive screen. The probability approaches unity that the Masters\ncontinued to delve and to learn for millions of cycles while you\nStretts, reasonlessly certain of your supremacy, concentrated upon your\nevolution from the material to a non-material form of life and performed\nonly limited research into armaments of greater and ever greater power.\"\n\n\"True. But that attitude was then justified. It was not and is not\nlogical to assume that any race would establish a fixed status at any\nlevel of ability below its absolute maximum.\"\n\n\"While that conclusion could once have been defensible, it is now\nvirtually certain that the Masters had stores of knowledge which they\nmay or may not have withheld from the Omans, but which were in some way\nmade available to the neo-humans. Also, there is no basis whatever for\nthe assumption that this new race has revealed all its potentialities.\"\n\n\"Statistically, that is probably true. But this is the best plan you\nhave been able to formulate?\"\n\n\"It is. Of the many thousands of plans I set up and tested, this one has\nthe highest probability of success.\"\n\n\"Then we will adopt it. We are Stretts. Whatever we decide upon will\nbe driven through to complete success. We have one tremendous advantage\nin you.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Yes. The probability approaches unity that I can perform research on a\nvastly wider and larger scale, and almost infinitely faster, than can\nany living organism or any possible combination of such organisms.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNor was the Great Brain bragging. It scanned in moments the stored\nscientific knowledge of over a million planets. It tabulated,\ncorrelated, analyzed, synthesized, theorized and concluded--all in\nmicroseconds of time. Thus it made more progress in one Terran week than\nthe Masters had made in a million years.\n\nWhen it had gone as far as it could go, it reported its results--and the\nStretts, hard as they were and intransigent, were amazed and overjoyed.\nNot one of them had ever even imagined such armaments possible. Hence\nthey became supremely confident that it was unmatched and unmatchable\nthroughout all space.\n\nWhat the Great Brain did not know, however, and the Stretts did not\nrealize, was that it could not really think.\n\nUnlike the human mind, it could not deduce valid theories or conclusions\nfrom incomplete, insufficient, fragmentary data. It could not leap\ngaps. Thus there was no more actual assurance than before that they had\nexceeded, or even matched, the weaponry of the neo-humans of Fuel World.\n\nSupremely confident, Ynos said: \"We will now discuss every detail of the\nplan in sub-detail, and will correlate every sub-detail with every\nother, to the end that every action, however minor, will be performed\nperfectly and in its exact time.\"\n\nThat discussion, which lasted for days, was held. Hundreds of thousands\nof new and highly specialized mechs were built and went furiously and\ncontinuously to work. A fuel-supply line was run to another\nuranexite-rich planet.\n\nStripping machines stripped away the surface layers of soil, sand, rock\nand low-grade ore. Giant miners tore and dug and slashed and refined and\nconcentrated. Storage silos by the hundreds were built and were filled.\nHundreds upon hundreds of concentrate-carriers bored their stolid ways\nthrough hyperspace. Many weeks of time passed.\n\nBut of what importance are mere weeks of time to a race that has, for\nmany millions of years, been adhering rigidly to a pre-set program?\n\nThe sheer magnitude of the operation, and the extraordinary attention to\ndetail with which it was prepared and launched, explain why the Strett\nattack on Ardvor did not occur until so many weeks later than Hilton and\nSawtelle expected it. They also explain the utterly incomprehensible\nfury, the completely fantastic intensity, the unparalleled savagery, the\nalmost immeasurable brute power of that attack when it finally did come.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the _Orion_ landed on Ardane Field from Earth, carrying the first\ncontingent of immigrants, Hilton and Sawtelle were almost as much\nsurprised as relieved that the Stretts had not already attacked.\n\nSawtelle, confident that his defenses were fully ready, took it more or\nless in stride. Hilton worried. And after a couple of days he began to\ndo some real thinking about it.\n\nThe first result of his thinking was a conference with Temple. As soon\nas she got the drift, she called in Teddy and Big Bill Karns. Teddy in\nturn called in Becky and de Vaux; Karns wanted Poynter and Beverly;\nPoynter wanted Braden and the twins; and so on. Thus, what started out\nas a conference of two became a full Ardan staff meeting; a meeting\nwhich, starting immediately after lunch, ran straight through into the\nfollowing afternoon.\n\n\"To sum up the consensus, for the record,\" Hilton said then, studying a\nsheet of paper covered with symbols, \"the Stretts haven't attacked yet\nbecause they found out that we are stronger than they are. They found\nthat out by analyzing our defensive web--which, if we had had this\nmeeting first, we wouldn't have put up at all. Unlike anything known to\nhuman or previous Strett science, it is proof against any form of attack\nup to the limit of the power of its generators. They will attack as soon\nas they are equipped to break that screen at the level of power probable\nto our ships. We can not arrive at any reliable estimate as to how long\nthat will take.\n\n\"As to the effectiveness of our cutting off their known fuel supply,\nopinion is divided. We must therefore assume that fuel shortage will not\nbe a factor.\n\n\"Neither are we unanimous on the basic matter as to why the Masters\nacted as they did just before they left Ardry. Why did they set the\nstatus so far below their top ability? Why did they make it impossible\nfor the Omans ever, of themselves, to learn their higher science? Why,\nif they did not want that science to become known, did they leave\ncomplete records of it? The majority of us believe that the Masters\ncoded their records in such fashion that the Stretts, even if they\nconquered the Omans or destroyed them, could never break that code;\nsince it was keyed to the basic difference between the Strett mentality\nand the human. Thus, they left it deliberately for some human race to\nfind.\n\n\"Finally, and most important, our physicists and theoreticians are not\nable to extrapolate, from the analysis of our screen, to the concepts\nunderlying the Masters' ultimate weapons of offense, the first-stage\nbooster and its final end-product, the Vang. If, as we can safely\nassume, the Stretts do not already have those weapons, they will know\nnothing about them until we ourselves use them in battle.\n\n\"These are, of course, only the principal points covered. Does anyone\nwish to amend this summation as recorded?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNo one did.\n\nThe meeting was adjourned. Hilton, however, accompanied Sawtelle and\nKedy to the captain's office. \"So you see, Skipper, we got troubles,\" he\nsaid. \"If we don't use those boosters against their skeletons it'll boil\ndown to a stalemate lasting God only knows how long. It will be a war of\nattrition, outcome dependent on which side can build the most and\nbiggest and strongest ships the fastest. On the other hand, if we _do_\nuse 'em on defense here, they'll analyze 'em and have everything worked\nout in a day or so. The first thing they'll do is beef up their\nplanetary defenses to match. That way, we'd blow all their ships out of\nspace, probably easily enough, but Strett itself will be just as safe as\nthough it were in God's left-hand hip pocket. So what's the answer?\"\n\n\"It isn't that simple, Jarve,\" Sawtelle said. \"Let's hear from you,\nKedy.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir. There is an optimum mass, a point of maximum efficiency\nof firepower as balanced against loss of maneuverability, for any craft\ndesigned for attack,\" Kedy thought, in his most professional manner. \"We\nassume that the Stretts know that as well as we do. No such limitation\napplies to strictly defensive structures, but both the Strett craft and\nours must be designed for attack. We have built and are building many\nhundreds of thousands of ships of that type. So, undoubtedly, are the\nStretts. Ship for ship, they will be pretty well matched. Therefore one\npart of my strategy will be for two of our ships to engage\nsimultaneously one of theirs. There is a distinct probability that we\nwill have enough advantage in speed of control to make that tactic\noperable.\"\n\n\"But there's another that we won't,\" Sawtelle objected. \"And maybe they\ncan build more ships than we can.\"\n\n\"Another point is that they may build, in addition to their big stuff, a\nlot of small, ultra-fast ones,\" Hilton put in. \"Suicide jobs--crash and\ndetonate--simply super-missiles. How sure are you that you can stop such\nmissiles with ordinary beams?\"\n\n\"Not at all, sir. Some of them would of course reach and destroy some of\nour ships. Which brings up the second part of my strategy. For each one\nof the heavies, we are building many small ships of the type you just\ncalled 'super-missiles'.\"\n\n\"Superdreadnoughts versus superdreadnoughts, super-missiles versus\nsuper-missiles.\" Hilton digested that concept for several minutes. \"That\ncould still wind up as a stalemate, except for what you said about\ncontrol. That isn't much to depend on, especially since we won't have\nthe time-lag advantage you Omans had before. They'll see to that. Also,\nI don't like to sacrifice a million Omans, either.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I haven't explained the newest development yet, sir. There will be no\nOmans. Each ship and each missile has a built-in Kedy brain, sir.\"\n\n\"_What?_ That makes it infinitely worse. You Kedys, unless it's\nabsolutely necessary, are _not_ expendable!\"\n\n\"Oh, but we are, sir. You don't quite understand. We Kedys are not\nmerely similar, but are in fact identical. Thus we are not independent\nentities. All of us together make up the actual Kedy--that which is\nmeant when we say 'I'. That is, I am the sum total of all Kedys\neverywhere, not merely this individual that you call Kedy One.\"\n\n\"You mean you're _all_ talking to me?\"\n\n\"Exactly, sir. Thus, no one element of the Kedy has any need of, or any\ndesire for, self-preservation. The destruction of one element, or of\nthousands of elements, would be of no more consequence to the Kedy than\n... well, they are strictly analogous to the severed ends of the hairs,\nevery time you get a haircut.\"\n\n\"My God!\" Hilton stared at Sawtelle. Sawtelle stared back. \"I'm\nbeginning to see ... maybe ... I hope. What control that would be! But\njust in case we _should_ have to use the boosters....\" Hilton's voice\ndied away. Scowling in concentration, he clasped his hands behind his\nback and began to pace the floor.\n\n\"Better give up, Jarve. Kedy's got the same mind you have,\" Sawtelle\nbegan, to Hilton's oblivious back; but Kedy silenced the thought almost\nin the moment of its inception.\n\n\"By no means, sir,\" he contradicted. \"I have the brain only. The _mind_\nis entirely different.\"\n\n\"Link up, Kedy, and see what you think of this,\" Hilton broke in. There\nensued an interchange of thought so fast and so deeply mathematical that\nSawtelle was lost in seconds. \"Do you think it'll work?\"\n\n\"I don't see how it can fail, sir. At what point in the action should it\nbe put into effect? And will you call the time of initiation, or shall\nI?\"\n\n\"Not until all their reserves are in action. Or, at worst, all of ours\nexcept that one task-force. Since you'll know a lot more about the\nstatus of the battle than either Sawtelle or I will, you give the signal\nand I'll start things going.\"\n\n\"What are you two talking about?\" Sawtelle demanded.\n\n\"It's a long story, chum. Kedy can tell you about it better than I can.\nBesides, it's getting late and Dark Lady and Larry both give me hell\nevery time I hold supper on plus time unless there's a mighty good\nreason for it. So, so long, guys.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nFor many weeks the production of Ardan warships and missiles had been\nspiraling upward.\n\nHalf a mountain range of solid rock had been converted into fabricated\nsuper-steel and armament. Superdreadnoughts Were popping into existence\nat the rate of hundreds per minute. Missiles were rolling off the ends\nof assembly lines like half-pint tin cans out of can-making machines.\n\nThe Strett warcraft, skeletons and missiles, would emerge into normal\nspace anywhere within a million miles of Ardvor. The Ardan missiles were\npowered for an acceleration of one hundred gravities. That much the Kedy\nbrains, molded solidly into teflon-lined, massively braced steel\nspheres, could just withstand.\n\nTo be certain of breaking the Strett screens, an impact velocity of\nabout six miles per second was necessary. The time required to attain\nthis velocity was about ten seconds, and the flight distance something\nover thirty miles.\n\nSince the Stretts could orient themselves in less than one second after\nemergence, even this extremely tight packing of missiles--only sixty\nmiles apart throughout the entire emergence volume of space--would still\ngive the Stretts the initiative by a time-ratio of more than ten to one.\n\nSuch tight packing was of course impossible. It called for many billions\nof defenders instead of the few millions it was possible for the Omans\nto produce in the time they had. In fact, the average spacing was well\nover ten thousand miles when the invading horde of Strett missiles\nemerged and struck.\n\n_How_ they struck!\n\nThere was nothing of finesse about that attack; nothing of skill or of\ntactics: nothing but the sheer brute force of overwhelming superiority\nof numbers and of over-matching power. One instant all space was empty.\nThe next instant it was full of invading missiles--a superb exhibition\nof coordination and timing.\n\nAnd the Kedy control, upon which the defenders had counted so heavily,\nproved useless. For each Strett missile, within a fraction of a second\nof emergence, darted toward the nearest Oman missile with an\nacceleration that made the one-hundred-gravity defenders seem to be\nstanding still.\n\nOne to one, missiles crashed into missiles and detonated. There were no\nsolid or liquid end-products. Each of those frightful weapons carried so\nmany megatons-equivalent of atomic concentrate that all nearby space\nblossomed out into superatomic blasts hundreds of times more violent\nthan the fireballs of lithium-hydride fusion bombs.\n\nFor a moment even Hilton was stunned; but only for a moment.\n\n\"Kedy!\" he barked. \"Get your big stuff out there! Use the boosters!\" He\nstarted for the door at a full run. \"That tears it--that _really_ tears\nit! Scrap the plan. I'll board the _Sirius_ and take the task-force to\nStrett. Bring your stuff along, Skipper, as soon as you're ready.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nArdan superdreadnoughts in their massed thousands poured out through\nArdvor's one-way screen. Each went instantly to work. Now the Kedy\ncontrol system, doing what it was designed to do, proved its full worth.\nFor the weapons of the big battle-wagons did not depend upon\nacceleration, but were driven at the speed of light; and Grand Fleet\nOperations were planned and were carried out at the almost infinite\nvelocity of thought itself.\n\nOr, rather, they were not planned at all. They were simply carried out,\nimmediately and without confusion.\n\nFor all the Kedys were one. Each Kedy element, without any lapse of time\nwhatever for consultation with any other, knew exactly where every other\nelement was; exactly what each was doing; and exactly what he himself\nshould do to make maximum contribution to the common cause.\n\nNor was any time lost in relaying orders to crewmen within the ship.\nThere were no crewmen. Each Kedy element was the sole personnel of, and\nwas integral with, his vessel. Nor were there any wires or relays to\nimpede and slow down communication. Operational instructions, too, were\ntransmitted and were acted upon with thought's transfinite speed. Thus,\nif decision and execution were not quite mathematically simultaneous,\nthey were separated by a period of time so infinitesimally small as to\nbe impossible of separation.\n\nWherever a Strett missile was, or wherever a Strett skeleton-ship\nappeared, an Oman beam reached it, usually in much less than one second.\nBeam clung to screen--caressingly, hungrily--absorbing its total energy\nand forming the first-stage booster. Then, three microseconds later,\nthat booster went off into a ragingly incandescent, glaringly violent\nburst of fury so hellishly, so inconceivably hot that less than a\nthousandth of its total output of energy was below the very top of the\nvisible spectrum!\n\nIf the previous display of atomic violence had been so spectacular and\nof such magnitude as to defy understanding or description, what of this?\nWhen hundreds of thousands of Kedys, each wielding world-wrecking powers\nas effortlessly and as deftly and as precisely as thought, attacked and\ndestroyed millions of those tremendously powerful war-fabrications of\nthe Stretts? The only simple answer is that all nearby space might very\nwell have been torn out of the most radiant layers of S-Doradus itself.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHilton made the hundred yards from office door to curb in just over\ntwelve seconds. Larry was waiting. The car literally burned a hole in\nthe atmosphere as it screamed its way to Ardane Field.\n\nIt landed with a thump. Heavy black streaks of synthetic rubber marked\nthe pavement as it came to a screeching, shrieking stop at the\nflagship's main lock. And, in the instant of closing that lock's outer\nportal, all twenty-thousand-plus warships of the task force took off as\none at ten gravities. Took off, and in less than one minute went into\noverdrive.\n\nAll personal haste was now over. Hilton went up into what he still\nthought of as the \"control room,\" even though he knew that there were no\ncontrols, nor even any instruments, anywhere aboard. He knew what he\nwould find there. Fast as he had acted, Temple had not had as far to go\nand she had got there first.\n\nHe could not have said, for the life of him, how he actually felt about\nthis direct defiance of his direct orders. He walked into the room, sat\ndown beside her and took her hand.\n\n\"I told you to stay home, Temple,\" he said.\n\n\"I know you did. But I'm not only the assistant head of your Psychology\nDepartment. I'm your wife, remember? 'Until death do us part.' And if\nthere's any way in the universe I can manage it, death isn't going to\npart us--at least, this one isn't. If this is it, we'll go together.\"\n\n\"I know, sweetheart.\" He put his arm around her, held her close. \"As a\npsych I wouldn't give a whoop. You'd be expendable. But as my wife,\nespecially now that you're pregnant, you aren't. You're a lot more\nimportant to the future of our race than I am.\"\n\nShe stiffened in the circle of his arm. \"What's _that_ crack supposed to\nmean? Think I'd ever accept a synthetic zombie imitation of you for my\nhusband and go on living with it just as though nothing had happened?\"\n\nHilton started to say something, but Temple rushed heedlessly on:\n\"_Drat_ the race! No matter how many children we ever have you were\nfirst and you'll _stay_ first, and if you have to go I'll go, too, so\nthere! Besides, you know darn well that they can't duplicate whatever it\nis that makes you Jarvis Hilton.\"\n\n\"Now wait a minute, Tempy. The conversion ...\"\n\n\"Yes, the conversion,\" she interrupted, triumphantly. \"The thing I'm\ntalking about is immaterial--untouchable--they didn't--couldn't--do any\nthing about it at all. Kedy, will you please tell this big goofus that\neven though you have got Jarvis Hilton's brain you aren't Jarvis Hilton\nand never can be?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe atmosphere of the room vibrated in the frequencies of a deep bass\nlaugh. \"You are trying to hold a completely untenable position, friend\nHilton. Any attempt to convince a mind of real power that falsity is\ntruth is illogical. My advice is for you to surrender.\"\n\nThat word hit Temple hard. \"Not surrender, sweetheart. I'm not fighting\nyou. I never will.\" She seized both of his hands; tears welled into her\nglorious eyes. \"It's just that I simply couldn't _stand_ it to go on\nliving without you!\"\n\n\"I know, darling.\" He got up and lifted her to her feet, so that she\ncould come properly into his arms. They stood there, silent and\nmotionless, for minutes.\n\nTemple finally released herself and, after feeling for a handkerchief\nshe did not have, wiped her eyes with a forefinger and then wiped the\nfinger on her bare leg. She grinned and turned to the Omans. \"Prince,\nwill you and Dark Lady please conjure us up a steak-and-mushrooms\nsupper? They should be in the pantry ... since this _Sirius_ was\ndesigned for us.\"\n\nAfter supper the two sat companionably on a davenport. \"One thing about\nthis business isn't quite clear,\" Temple said. \"Why all this tearing\nrush? They haven't got the booster or anything like it, or they'd have\nused it. Surely it'll take them a long time to go from the mere analysis\nof the forces and fields we used clear through to the production and\ninstallation of enough weapons to stop this whole fleet?\"\n\n\"It surely won't. They've had the absorption principle for ages.\nRemember that first, ancient skeleton that drained all the power of our\nsuits and boats in nothing flat? From there it isn't too big a jump. And\nas for producing stuff; uh-_uh_! If there's any limit to what they can\ndo, I don't know what it is. If we don't slug 'em before they get it,\nit's curtains.\"\n\n\"I see.... I'm afraid. We're almost there, darling.\"\n\nHe glanced at the chronometer. \"About eleven minutes. And of course I\ndon't need to ask you to stay out of the way.\"\n\n\"Of course not. I won't interfere, no matter what happens. All I'm going\nto do is hold your hand and pull for you with all my might.\"\n\n\"That'll help, believe me. I'm mighty glad you're along, sweetheart.\nEven though both of us know you shouldn't be.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe task force emerged. Each ship darted toward its pre-assigned place\nin a mathematically exact envelope around the planet Strett.\n\nHilton sat on a davenport strained and still. His eyes were closed and\nevery muscle tense. Left hand gripped the arm-rest so fiercely that\nfingertips were inches deep in the leather-covered padding.\n\nThe Stretts _knew_ that any such attack as this was futile. No movable\nstructure or any combination of such structures could possibly wield\nenough power to break down screens powered by such engines as theirs.\n\nHilton, however, knew that there was a chance. Not with the first-stage\nboosters, which were manipulable and detonable masses of ball lightning,\nbut with those boosters' culminations, the Vangs; which were ball\nlightning raised to the sixth power and which only the frightful\nenergies of the boosters could bring into being.\n\nBut, even with twenty-thousand-plus Vangs--or any larger number--success\ndepended entirely upon a nicety of timing never before approached and\nsupposedly impossible. Not only to thousandths of a microsecond, but to\na small fraction of one such thousandth: roughly, the time it takes\nlight to travel three-sixteenths of an inch.\n\nIt would take practically absolute simultaneity to overload to the point\nof burnout to those Strett generators. They were the heaviest in the\nGalaxy.\n\nThat was why Hilton himself had to be there. He could not possibly have\ndone the job from Ardvor. In fact, there was no real assurance that,\neven at the immeasurable velocity of thought and covering a mere million\nmiles, he could do it even from his present position aboard one unit of\nthe fleet. Theoretically, with his speed-up, he could. But that theory\nhad yet to be reduced to practice.\n\nTense and strained, Hilton began his countdown.\n\nTemple sat beside him. Both hands pressed his right fist against her\nbreast. Her eyes, too, were closed; she was as stiff and as still as was\nhe. She was not interfering, but giving; supporting him, backing him,\ngiving to him in full flood everything of that tremendous inner strength\nthat had made Temple Bells what she so uniquely was.\n\nOn the exact center of the needle-sharp zero beat every Kedy\nstruck. Gripped and activated as they all were by Hilton's\nkeyed-up-and-stretched-out mind, they struck in what was very close\nindeed to absolute unison.\n\nAbsorbing beams, each one having had precisely the same number of\nmillimeters to travel, reached the screen at the same instant. They\nclung and sucked. Immeasurable floods of energy flashed from the Strett\ngenerators into those vortices to form twenty thousand-plus first-stage\nboosters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut this time the boosters did not detonate.\n\nInstead, as energies continued to flood in at a frightfully accelerating\nrate, they turned into something else. Things no Terran science has ever\neven imagined; things at the formation of which all neighboring space\nactually warped, and in that warping seethed and writhed and shuddered.\nThe very sub-ether screamed and shrieked in protest as it, too, yielded\nin starkly impossible fashions to that irresistible stress.\n\nHow even those silicon-fluorine brains stood it, not one of them ever\nknew.\n\nMicrosecond by slow microsecond the Vangs grew and grew and grew. They\nwere pulling not only the full power of the Ardan warships, but also the\nimmeasurably greater power of the strainingly overloaded Strettsian\ngenerators themselves. The ethereal and sub-ethereal writhings and\ndistortions and screamings grew worse and worse; harder and ever harder\nto bear.\n\nImagine, if you can, a constantly and rapidly increasing mass of\nplutonium--a mass already thousands of times greater than critical, but\nnot _allowed_ to react! That gives a faint and very inadequate picture\nof what was happening then.\n\nFinally, at perhaps a hundred thousand times critical mass, and still in\nperfect sync, the Vangs all went off.\n\nThe planet Strett became a nova.\n\n\"We won! We _won_!\" Temple shrieked, her perception piercing through the\nhellish murk that was all nearby space.\n\n\"Not quite yet, sweet, but we're over the biggest hump,\" and the two\nheld an impromptu, but highly satisfactory, celebration.\n\nPerhaps it would be better to say that the planet Strett became a\njunior-grade nova, since the actual nova stage was purely superficial\nand did not last very long. In a couple of hours things had quieted down\nenough so that the heavily-screened warships could approach the planet\nand finish up their part of the job.\n\nMuch of Strett's land surface was molten lava. Much of its water was\ngone. There were some pockets of resistance left, of course, but they\ndid not last long. Equally of course the Stretts themselves, twenty-five\nmiles underground, had not been harmed at all.\n\nBut that, too, was according to plan.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLeaving the task force on guard, to counter any move the Stretts might\nbe able to make, Hilton shot the _Sirius_ out to the planet's moon.\nThere Sawtelle and his staff and tens of thousands of Omans and machines\nwere starting to work. No part of this was Hilton's job; so all he and\nTemple did was look on.\n\nCorrection, please. That was not _all_ they did. But while resting and\neating and loafing and sleeping and enjoying each other's company, both\nwatched Operation Moon closely enough to be completely informed as to\neverything that went on.\n\nImmense, carefully placed pits went down to solid bedrock. To that rock\nwere immovably anchored structures strong enough to move a world.\nDriving units were installed--drives of such immensity of power as to\ntest to the full the highest engineering skills of the Galaxy. Mountains\nof fuel-concentrate filled vast reservoirs of concrete. Each was\nconnected to a drive by fifty-inch high-speed conveyors.\n\nSawtelle drove a thought and those brutal super-drives began to blast.\n\nAs they blasted, Strett's satellite began to move out of its orbit. Very\nslowly at first, but faster and faster. They continued to blast, with\nall their prodigious might and in carefully-computed order, until the\ndesired orbit was attained--an orbit which terminated in a vertical line\nthrough the center of the Stretts' supposedly impregnable retreat.\n\nThe planet Strett had a mass of approximately seven times ten to the\ntwenty-first metric tons. Its moon, little more than a hundredth as\nmassive, still weighed in at about eight times ten to the\nnineteenth--that is, the figure eight followed by nineteen zeroes.\n\nAnd moon fell on planet, in direct central impact, after having fallen\nfrom a height of over a quarter of a million miles under the full pull\nof gravity and the full thrust of those mighty atomic drives.\n\nThe kinetic energy of such a collision can be computed. It can be\nexpressed. It is, however, of such astronomical magnitude as to be\ncompletely meaningless to the human mind.\n\nSimply, the two worlds merged and splashed. Droplets, weighing up to\nmillions of tons each, spattered out into space; only to return, in\nseconds or hours or weeks or months, to add their atrocious\ncontributions to the enormity of the destruction already wrought.\n\nNo trace survived of any Strett or of any thing, however small,\npertaining to the Stretts.\n\n\n\n\nEpilogue\n\n\nAs had become a daily custom, most of the Ardans were gathered at the\nnatatorium. Hilton and Temple were wrestling in the water--she was\ntrying to duck him and he was hard put to it to keep her from doing it.\nThe platinum-haired twins were--oh, ever so surreptitiously and\nindetectably!--studying the other girls.\n\nCaptain Sawtelle--he had steadfastly refused to accept any higher\ntitle--and his wife were teaching two of their tiny grandchildren to\nswim.\n\nIn short, everything was normal.\n\nBeverly Bell Poynter, from the top platform, hit the board as hard as\nshe could hit it; and, perfectly synchronized with it, hurled herself\nupward. Up and up and up she went. Up to her top ceiling of two hundred\nten feet. Then, straightening out into a shapely arrow and without again\nmoving a muscle, she hurtled downward, making two and a half beautifully\nstately turns and striking the water with a slurping, splashless _chug_!\nComing easily to the surface, she shook the water out of her eyes.\n\nTemple, giving up her attempts to near-drown her husband, rolled over\nand floated quietly beside him.\n\n\"You know, this is fun,\" he said.\n\n\"Uh-_huh_,\" she agreed enthusiastically.\n\n\"I'm glad you and Sandy buried the hatchet. Two of the top women who\never lived. Or should I have said sheathed the claws? Or have you,\nreally?\"\n\n\"Pretty much ... I guess.\" Temple didn't seem altogether sure of the\npoint. \"Oh-oh. _Now_ what?\"\n\nA flitabout had come to ground. Dark Lady, who never delivered a message\nvia thought if she could possibly get away with delivering it in person,\nwas running full tilt across the sand toward them. Her long black hair\nwas streaming out behind her; she was waving a length of teletype tape\nas though it were a pennon.\n\n\"Oh, no. Not _again_?\" Temple wailed. \"Don't tell us it's Terra again,\nDark Lady, please.\"\n\n\"But it is!\" Dark Lady cried, excitedly. \"And it says 'From Five-Jet\nAdmiral Gordon, Commanding.'\"\n\n\"Omit flowers, please,\" Hilton directed. \"Boil it down.\"\n\n\"The _Perseus_ is in orbit with the whole Advisory Board. They want to\nhold a top-level summit conference with Director Hilton and Five-Jet\nAdmiral Sawtelle.\" Dark Lady raised her voice enough to be sure Sawtelle\nheard the title, and shot him a wicked glance as she announced it. \"They\nhope to conclude all unfinished business on a mutually satisfactory and\nprofitable basis.\"\n\n\"Okay, Lady, thanks. Tell 'em we'll call 'em shortly.\"\n\nDark Lady flashed away and Hilton and Temple swam slowly toward a\nladder.\n\n\"Drat Terra and everything and everybody on it,\" Temple said,\nvigorously. \"And especially drat His Royal Fatness Five-Jet Admiral\nGordon. How much longer will it take, do you think, to pound some sense\ninto their pointed little heads?\"\n\n\"Oh, we're not doing too bad,\" Hilton assured his lovely bride. \"Two or\nthree more sessions ought to do it.\"\n\nEverything was normal....\n\n\nEND\n\n\n\n\nDon't miss the next Galaxy Magazine!\n\n THE BIG ENGINE\n by Fritz Leiber\n\n CRITICAL MASS\n by Pohl & Kornbluth\n\n THE RAG AND BONE MEN\n by Algis Budrys\n\nAnd many more, including Willy Ley science column and the great\nconclusion of Poul Anderson's THE DAY AFTER DOOMSDAY!

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
