One of whom is about to lobotomise himself through\nthe nostril with a pencil. Funny as hell and sharp as steel.\"\n\n- Warren Ellis,\nAuthor of Transmetropolitan\n\n\n--\n\n=======================\nA note about this book:\n=======================\n\nLast year, in January 2003, my first novel [ http://craphound.com/down ] came\nout. I was 31 years old, and I'd been calling myself a novelist since the age of\n12. It was the storied dream-of-a-lifetime, come-true-at-last. I was and am\nproud as hell of that book, even though it is just one book among many released\nlast year, better than some, poorer than others; and even though the print-run\n(which sold out very quickly!) though generous by science fiction standards,\nhardly qualifies it as a work of mass entertainment.\n\nThe thing that's extraordinary about that first novel is that it was released\nunder terms governed by a Creative Commons [ http://creativecommons.org ]\nlicense that allowed my readers to copy the book freely and distribute it far\nand wide. Hundreds of thousands of copies of the book were made and distributed\nthis way. *Hundreds* of *thousands*.\n\nToday, I release my second novel, and my third [\nhttp://www.argosymag.com/NextIssue.html ], a collaboration with Charlie Stross\nis due any day, and two [\nhttp://www.fantasticmetropolis.com/show.html?fn.preview_doctorow ] more [\nhttp://www.craphound.com/usrbingodexcerpt.txt ] are under contract. My career as\na novelist is now well underway -- in other words, I am firmly afoot on a long\nroad that stretches into the future: my future, science fiction's future,\npublishing's future and the future of the world.\n\nThe future is my business, more or less. I'm a science fiction writer. One way\nto know the future is to look good and hard at the present. Here's a thing I've\nnoticed about the present: MORE PEOPLE ARE READING MORE WORDS OFF OF MORE\nSCREENS THAN EVER BEFORE. Here's another thing I've noticed about the present:\nFEWER PEOPLE ARE READING FEWER WORDS OFF OF FEWER PAGES THAN EVER BEFORE. That\ndoesn't mean that the book is *dying* -- no more than the advent of the printing\npress and the de-emphasis of Bible-copying monks meant that the book was dying\n-- but it does mean that the book is changing. I think that *literature* is\nalive and well: we're reading our brains out! I just think that the complex\nsocial practice of \"book\" -- of which a bunch of paper pages between two covers\nis the mere expression -- is transforming and will transform further.\n\nI intend on figuring out what it's transforming into. I intend on figuring out\nthe way that some writers -- that *this writer*, right here, wearing my\nunderwear -- is going to get rich and famous from his craft. I intend on\nfiguring out how *this writer's* words can become part of the social discourse,\ncan be relevant in the way that literature at its best can be.\n\nI don't know what the future of book looks like. To figure it out, I'm doing\nsome pretty basic science. I'm peering into this opaque, inscrutable system of\npublishing as it sits in the year 2004, and I'm making a perturbation. I'm\nstirring the pot to see what surfaces, so that I can see if the system reveals\nitself to me any more thoroughly as it roils. Once that happens, maybe I'll be\nable to formulate an hypothesis and try an experiment or two and maybe -- just\nmaybe -- I'll get to the bottom of book-in-2004 and beat the competition to\nmaking it work, and maybe I'll go home with all (or most) of the marbles.\n\nIt's a long shot, but I'm a pretty sharp guy, and I know as much about this\nstuff as anyone out there. More to the point, trying stuff and doing research\nyields a non-zero chance of success. The alternatives -- sitting pat, or worse,\ngetting into a moral panic about \"piracy\" and accusing the readers who are\nblazing new trail of \"the moral equivalent of shoplifting\" -- have a *zero*\npercent chance of success.\n\nMost artists never \"succeed\" in the sense of attaining fame and modest fortune.\nA career in the arts is a risky long-shot kind of business. I'm doing what I can\nto sweeten my odds.\n\nSo here we are, and here is novel number two, a book called Eastern Standard\nTribe, which you can walk into shops all over the world and buy [\nhttp://craphound.com/est/buy.php ] as a physical artifact -- a very nice\nphysical artifact, designed by Chesley-award-winning art director Irene Gallo\nand her designer Shelley Eshkar, published by Tor Books, a huge, profit-making\narm of an enormous, multinational publishing concern. Tor is watching what\nhappens to this book nearly as keenly as I am, because we're all very interested\nin what the book is turning into.\n\nTo that end, here is the book as a non-physical artifact. A file. A bunch of\ntext, slithery bits that can cross the world in an instant, using the Internet,\na tool designed to copy things very quickly from one place to another; and using\npersonal computers, tools designed to slice, dice and rearrange collections of\nbits. These tools demand that their users copy and slice and dice -- rip, mix\nand burn! -- and that's what I'm hoping you will do with this.\n\nNot (just) because I'm a swell guy, a big-hearted slob. Not because Tor is run\nby addlepated dot-com refugees who have been sold some snake-oil about the\ne-book revolution. Because you -- the readers, the slicers, dicers and copiers\n-- hold in your collective action the secret of the future of publishing.\nWriters are a dime a dozen. Everybody's got a novel in her or him. Readers are a\nprecious commodity. You've got all the money and all the attention and you run\nthe word-of-mouth network that marks the difference between a little book, soon\nforgotten, and a book that becomes a lasting piece of posterity for its author,\nchanging the world in some meaningful way.\n\nI'm unashamedly exploiting your imagination. Imagine me a new practice of book,\nreaders. Take this novel and pass it from inbox to inbox, through your IM\nclients, over P2P networks. Put it on webservers. Convert it to weird, obscure\nebook formats. Show me -- and my colleagues, and my publisher -- what the future\nof book looks like.\n\nI'll keep on writing them if you keep on reading them. But as cool and wonderful\nas writing is, it's not half so cool as inventing the future.

You know who you are.\nSincerest thanks and most heartfelt apologies.\n\nCory\n\n--\n\n1.\n\nI once had a Tai Chi instructor who explained the difference between Chinese and\nWestern medicine thus: \"Western medicine is based on corpses, things that you\ndiscover by cutting up dead bodies and pulling them apart. Chinese medicine is\nbased on living flesh, things observed from vital, moving humans.\"\n\nThe explanation, like all good propaganda, is stirring and stilted, and not\nparticularly accurate, and gummy as the hook from a top-40 song, sticky in your\nmind in the sleep-deprived noontime when the world takes on a hallucinatory\nhypperreal clarity. Like now as I sit here in my underwear on the roof of a\nsanatorium in the back woods off Route 128, far enough from the perpetual\nconstruction of Boston that it's merely a cloud of dust like a herd of distant\nbuffalo charging the plains. Like now as I sit here with a pencil up my nose,\nthinking about homebrew lobotomies and wouldn't it be nice if I gave myself one.\n\nDeep breath.\n\nThe difference between Chinese medicine and Western medicine is the dissection\nversus the observation of the thing in motion. The difference between reading a\nstory and studying a story is the difference between living the story and\nkilling the story and looking at its guts.\n\nSchool! We sat in English class and we dissected the stories that I'd escaped\ninto, laid open their abdomens and tagged their organs, covered their genitals\nwith polite sterile drapes, recorded dutiful notes *en masse* that told us what\nthe story was about, but never what the story *was*. Stories are propaganda,\nvirii that slide past your critical immune system and insert themselves directly\ninto your emotions. Kill them and cut them open and they're as naked as a\nnightclub in daylight.\n\nThe theme. The first step in dissecting a story is euthanizing it: \"What is the\ntheme of this story?\"\n\nLet me kill my story before I start it, so that I can dissect it and understand\nit. The theme of this story is: \"Would you rather be smart or happy?\"\n\nThis is a work of propaganda. It's a story about choosing smarts over happiness.\nExcept if I give the pencil a push: then it's a story about choosing happiness\nover smarts. It's a morality play, and the first character is about to take the\nstage. He's a foil for the theme, so he's drawn in simple lines. Here he is:\n\n2.\n\nArt Berry was born to argue.\n\nThere are born assassins. Bred to kill, raised on cunning and speed, they are\nthe stuff of legend, remorseless and unstoppable. There are born ballerinas,\nconfectionery girls whose parents subject them to rigors every bit as intense as\nthe tripwire and poison on which the assassins are reared. There are children\nborn to practice medicine or law; children born to serve their nations and die\nheroically in the noble tradition of their forebears; children born to tread the\nboards or shred the turf or leave smoking rubber on the racetrack.\n\nArt's earliest memory: a dream. He is stuck in the waiting room of one of the\ninnumerable doctors who attended him in his infancy. He is perhaps three, and\nhis attention span is already as robust as it will ever be, and in his dream --\nwhich is fast becoming a nightmare -- he is bored silly.\n\nThe only adornment in the waiting room is an empty cylinder that once held toy\nblocks. Its label colorfully illustrates the blocks, which look like they'd be a\nhell of a lot of fun, if someone hadn't lost them all.\n\nNear the cylinder is a trio of older children, infinitely fascinating. They\nconfer briefly, then do *something* to the cylinder, and it unravels, extruding\ninto the third dimension, turning into a stack of blocks.\n\nAha! thinks Art, on waking. This is another piece of the secret knowledge that\nolder people possess, the strange magic that is used to operate cars and\nelevators and shoelaces.\n\nArt waits patiently over the next year for a grownup to show him how the\nblocks-from-pictures trick works, but none ever does. Many other mysteries are\nrevealed, each one more disappointingly mundane than the last: even flying a\nplane seemed easy enough when the nice stew let him ride up in the cockpit for a\nwhile en route to New York -- Art's awe at the complexity of adult knowledge\nfell away. By the age of five, he was stuck in a sort of perpetual terrible\ntwos, fearlessly shouting \"no\" at the world's every rule, arguing the morals and\nreason behind them until the frustrated adults whom he was picking on gave up\nand swatted him or told him that that was just how it was.\n\nIn the Easter of his sixth year, an itchy-suited and hard-shoed visit to church\nwith his Gran turned into a raging holy war that had the parishioners and the\nclergy arguing with him in teams and relays.\n\nIt started innocently enough: \"Why does God care if we take off our hats, Gran?\"\nBut the nosy ladies in the nearby pews couldn't bear to simply listen in, and\nthe argument spread like ripples on a pond, out as far as the pulpit, where the\npriest decided to squash the whole line of inquiry with some half-remembered\nphilosophical word games from Descartes in which the objective truth of reality\nis used to prove the beneficence of God and vice-versa, and culminates with \"I\nthink therefore I am.\" Father Ferlenghetti even managed to work it into the\nthread of the sermon, but before he could go on, Art's shrill little voice\nanswered from within the congregation.\n\nAmazingly, the six-year-old had managed to assimilate all of Descartes's fairly\ntricksy riddles in as long as it took to describe them, and then went on to use\nthose same arguments to prove the necessary cruelty of God, followed by the\nnecessary nonexistence of the Supreme Being, and Gran tried to take him home\nthen, but the priest -- who'd watched Jesuits play intellectual table tennis and\nrecognized a natural when he saw one -- called him to the pulpit, whence Art\ntook on the entire congregation, singly and in bunches, as they assailed his\nreasoning and he built it back up, laying rhetorical traps that they blundered\ninto with all the cunning of a cabbage. Father Ferlenghetti laughed and\nclarified the points when they were stuttered out by some marble-mouthed\nrhetorical amateur from the audience, then sat back and marveled as Art did his\nthing. Not much was getting done vis-a-vis sermonizing, and there was still the\nCommunion to be administered, but God knew it had been a long time since the\ncongregation was engaged so thoroughly with coming to grips with God and what\ntheir faith meant.\n\nAfterwards, when Art was returned to his scandalized, thin-lipped Gran, Father\nFerlenghetti made a point of warmly embracing her and telling her that Art was\nwelcome at his pulpit any time, and suggested a future in the seminary. Gran was\namazed, and blushed under her Sunday powder, and the clawed hand on his shoulder\nbecame a caress.\n\n3.\n\nThe theme of this story is choosing smarts over happiness, or maybe happiness\nover smarts. Art's a good guy. He's smart as hell. That's his schtick. If he\nwere a cartoon character, he'd be the pain-in-the-ass poindexter who is all the\ntime dispelling the mysteries that fascinate his buddies. It's not easy being\nArt's friend.\n\nWhich is, of course, how Art (\"not his real name\") ended up sitting 45 stories\nover the woodsy Massachusetts countryside, hot August wind ruffling his hair and\nblowing up the legs of his boxers, pencil in his nose, euthanizing his story\npreparatory to dissecting it. In order to preserve the narrative integrity, Art\n(\"not his real name\") may take some liberties with the truth. This is\nautobiographical fiction, after all, not an autobiography.\n\nCall me Art (\"not my real name\"). I am an agent-provocateur in the Eastern\nStandard Tribe, though I've spent most of my life in GMT-9 and at various\nlatitudes of Zulu, which means that my poor pineal gland has all but forgotten\nhow to do its job without that I drown it in melatonin precursors and treat it\nto multi-hour nine-kilolumen sessions in the glare of my travel lantern.\n\nThe tribes are taking over the world. You can track our progress by the rise of\nminor traffic accidents. The sleep-deprived are terrible, terrible drivers.\nDaylight savings time is a widowmaker: stay off the roads on Leap Forward day!\n\nHere is the second character in the morality play. She's the love interest. Was.\nWe broke up, just before I got sent to the sanatorium. Our circadians weren't\ncompatible.\n\n4.\n\nApril 3, 2022 was the day that Art nearly killed the first and only woman he\never really loved. It was her fault.\n\nArt's car was running low on lard after a week in the Benelux countries, where\nthe residents were all high-net-worth cholesterol-conscious codgers who guarded\ntheir arteries from the depredations of the frytrap as jealously as they\nsquirreled their money away from the taxman. He was, therefore, thrilled and\ndelighted to be back on British soil, Greenwich+0, where grease ran like water\nand his runabout could be kept easily and cheaply fuelled and the vodka could\nrun down his gullet instead of into his tank.\n\nHe was in the Kensington High Street on a sleepy Sunday morning, GMT0300h --\n2100h back in EDT -- and the GPS was showing insufficient data-points to even\ngauge traffic between his geoloc and the Camden High where he kept his rooms.\nWhen the GPS can't find enough peers on the relay network to color its maps with\ntraffic data, you know you've hit a sweet spot in the city's uber-circadian, a\nmoment of grace where the roads are very nearly exclusively yours.\n\nSo he whistled a jaunty tune and swilled his coffium, a fad that had just made\nit to the UK, thanks to the loosening of rules governing the disposal of heavy\nwater in the EU. The java just wouldn't cool off, remaining hot enough to\nguarantee optimal caffeine osmosis right down to the last drop.\n\nIf he was jittery, it was no more so than was customary for ESTalists at GMT+0,\nand he was driving safely and with due caution. If the woman had looked out\nbefore stepping off the kerb and into the anemically thin road, if she hadn't\nbeen wearing stylish black in the pitchy dark of the curve before the Royal\nGarden Hotel, if she hadn't stepped *right in front of his runabout*, he would\nhave merely swerved and sworn and given her a bit of a fright.\n\nBut she didn't, she was, she did, and he kicked the brake as hard as he could,\ntwisted the wheel likewise, and still clipped her hipside and sent her\nass-over-teakettle before the runabout did its own barrel roll, making three\ncomplete revolutions across the Kensington High before lodging in the Royal\nGarden Hotel's shrubs. Art was covered in scorching, molten coffium, screaming\nand clawing at his eyes, upside down, when the porters from the Royal Garden\nopened his runabout's upside-down door, undid his safety harness and pulled him\nout from behind the rapidly flacciding airbag. They plunged his face into the\nornamental birdbath, which had a skin of ice that shattered on his nose and\njangled against his jawbone as the icy water cooled the coffium and stopped the\nterrible, terrible burning.\n\nHe ended up on his knees, sputtering and blowing and shivering, and cleared his\neyes in time to see the woman he'd hit being carried out of the middle of the\nroad on a human travois made of the porters' linked arms of red wool and gold\nbrocade.\n\n\"Assholes!\" she was hollering. \"I could have a goddamn spinal injury! You're not\nsupposed to move me!\"\n\n\"Look, Miss,\" one porter said, a young chap with the kind of fantastic dentition\nthat only an insecure teabag would ever pay for, teeth so white and flawless\nthey strobed in the sodium streetlamps. \"Look. We can leave you in the middle of\nthe road, right, and not move you, like we're supposed to. But if we do that,\nchances are you're going to get run over before the paramedics get here, and\nthen you certainly *will* have a spinal injury, and a crushed skull besides,\nlike as not. Do you follow me?\"\n\n\"You!\" she said, pointing a long and accusing finger at Art. \"You! Don't you\nwatch where you're going, you fool! You could have killed me!\"\n\nArt shook water off his face and blew a mist from his dripping moustache.\n\"Sorry,\" he said, weakly. She had an American accent, Californian maybe, a\nlitigious stridency that tightened his sphincter like an alum enema and\nmiraculously flensed him of the impulse to argue.\n\n\"Sorry?\" she said, as the porters lowered her gently to the narrow strip turf\nout beside the sidewalk. \"Sorry? Jesus, is that the best you can do?\"\n\n\"Well you *did* step out in front of my car,\" he said, trying to marshal some\nspine.\n\nShe attempted to sit up, then slumped back down, wincing. \"You were going too\nfast!\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" he said. \"I'm pretty sure I was doing 45 -- that's five\nclicks under the limit. Of course, the GPS will tell for sure.\"\n\nAt the mention of empirical evidence, she seemed to lose interest in being\nangry. \"Give me a phone, will you?\"\n\nMortals may be promiscuous with their handsets, but for a tribalist, one's\nrelationship with one's comm is deeply personal. Art would have sooner shared\nhis underwear. But he *had* hit her with his car. Reluctantly, Art passed her\nhis comm.\n\nThe woman stabbed at the handset with the fingers of her left hand, squinting at\nit in the dim light. Eventually, she clamped it to her head. \"Johnny? It's\nLinda. Yes, I'm still in London. How's tricks out there? Good, good to hear.\nHow's Marybeth? Oh, that's too bad. Want to hear how I am?\" She grinned\ndevilishly. \"I just got hit by a car. No, just now. Five minutes ago. Of course\nI'm hurt! I think he broke my hip -- maybe my spine, too. Yes, I can wiggle my\ntoes. Maybe he shattered a disc and it's sawing through the cord right now.\nConcussion? Oh, almost certainly. Pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life,\nmissed wages...\" She looked up at Art. \"You're insured, right?\"\n\nArt nodded, miserably, fishing for an argument that would not come.\n\n\"Half a mil, easy. Easy! Get the papers going, will you? I'll call you when the\nambulance gets here. Bye. Love you too. Bye. Bye. Bye, Johnny. I got to go.\nBye!\" She made a kissy noise and tossed the comm back at Art. He snatched it out\nof the air in a panic, closed its cover reverentially and slipped it back in his\njacket pocket.\n\n\"C'mere,\" she said, crooking a finger. He knelt beside her.\n\n\"I'm Linda,\" she said, shaking his hand, then pulling it to her chest.\n\n\"Art,\" Art said.\n\n\"Art. Here's the deal, Art. It's no one's fault, OK? It was dark, you were\ndriving under the limit, I was proceeding with due caution. Just one of those\nthings. But *you* did hit *me*. Your insurer's gonna have to pay out -- rehab,\npain and suffering, you get it. That's going to be serious kwan. I'll go splits\nwith you, you play along.\"\n\nArt looked puzzled.\n\n\"Art. Art. Art. Art, here's the thing. Maybe you were distracted. Lost. Not\nlooking. Not saying you were, but maybe. Maybe you were, and if you were, my\nlawyer's going to get that out of you, he's going to nail you, and I'll get a\nbig, fat check. On the other hand, you could just, you know, cop to it. Play\nalong. You make this easy, we'll make this easy. Split it down the middle, once\nmy lawyer gets his piece. Sure, your premiums'll go up, but there'll be enough\nto cover both of us. Couldn't you use some ready cash? Lots of zeroes. Couple\nhundred grand, maybe more. I'm being nice here -- I could keep it all for me.\"\n\n\"I don't think --\"\n\n\"Sure you don't. You're an honest man. I understand, Art. Art. Art, I\nunderstand. But what has your insurer done for you, lately? My uncle Ed, he got\ncaught in a threshing machine, paid his premiums every week for forty years,\nwhat did he get? Nothing. Insurance companies. They're the great satan. No one\nlikes an insurance company. Come on, Art. Art. You don't have to say anything\nnow, but think about it, OK, Art?\"\n\nShe released his hand, and he stood. The porter with the teeth flashed them at\nhim. \"Mad,\" he said, \"just mad. Watch yourself, mate. Get your solicitor on the\nline, I were you.\"\n\nHe stepped back as far as the narrow sidewalk would allow and fired up his comm\nand tunneled to a pseudonymous relay, bouncing the call off a dozen mixmasters.\nHe was, after all, in deep cover as a GMTalist, and it wouldn't do to have his\nenciphered packets' destination in the clear -- a little traffic analysis and\nhis cover'd be blown. He velcroed the keyboard to his thigh and started\nchording.\n\nTrepan: Any UK solicitors on the channel?\n\nGink-Go: Lawyers. Heh. Kill 'em all.

Still, he was the more mobile of\nthe two, as Linda was swaddled in smartcasts that both immobilized her and\nmassaged her, all the while osmosing transdermal antiinflammatories and\npainkillers. He tottered the two steps to the chair at her bedside and shook her\nhand again.\n\n\"Don't take this the wrong way, but you look like hell,\" he said.\n\nShe smiled. Her jaw made an audible pop. \"Get a picture, will you? It'll be good\nin court.\"\n\nHe chuckled.\n\n\"No, seriously. Get a picture.\"\n\nSo he took out his comm and snapped a couple pix, including one with nightvision\nfilters on to compensate for the dimmed recovery room lighting. \"You're a cool\ncustomer, you know that?\" he said, as he tucked his camera away.\n\n\"Not so cool. This is all a coping strategy. I'm pretty shook up, you want to\nknow the truth. I could have died.\"\n\n\"What were you doing on the street at three AM anyway?\"\n\n\"I was upset, so I took a walk, thought I'd get something to eat or a beer or\nsomething.\"\n\n\"You haven't been here long, huh?\"\n\nShe laughed, and it turned into a groan. \"What the hell is wrong with the\nEnglish, anyway? The sun sets and the city rolls up its streets. It's not like\nthey've got this great tradition of staying home and surfing cable or anything.\"\n\n\"They're all snug in their beds, farting away their lentil roasts.\"\n\n\"That's it! You can't get a steak here to save your life. Mad cows, all of 'em.\nIf I see one more gray soy sausage, I'm going to kill the waitress and eat\n*her*.\"\n\n\"You just need to get hooked up,\" he said. \"Once we're out of here, I'll take\nyou out for a genuine blood pudding, roast beef and oily chips. I know a place.\"\n\n\"I'm drooling. Can I borrow your phone again? Uh, I think you're going to have\nto dial for me.\"\n\n\"That's OK. Give me the number.\"\n\nShe did, and he cradled his comm to her head. He was close enough to her that he\ncould hear the tinny, distinctive ringing of a namerican circuit at the other\nend. He heard her shallow breathing, heard her jaw creak. He smelled her\nshampoo, a free-polymer new-car smell, smelled a hint of her sweat. A cord stood\nout on her neck, merging in an elegant vee with her collarbone, an arrow\npointing at the swell of her breast under her paper gown.\n\n\"Toby, it's Linda.\"\n\nA munchkin voice chittered down the line.\n\n\"Shut up, OK. Shut up. Shut. I'm in the hospital.\" More chipmunk. \"Got hit by a\ncar. I'll be OK. No. Shut up. I'll be fine. I'll send you the FAQs. I just\nwanted to say. . .\" She heaved a sigh, closed her eyes. \"You know what I wanted\nto say. Sorry, all right? Sorry it came to this. You'll be OK. I'll be OK. I\njust didn't want to leave you hanging.\" She sounded groggy, but there was a sob\nthere, too. \"I can't talk long. I'm on a shitload of dope. Yes, it's good dope.\nI'll call you later. I don't know when I'm coming back, but we'll sort it out\nthere, all right? OK. Shut up. OK. You too.\"\n\nShe looked up at Art. \"My boyfriend. Ex-boyfriend. Not sure who's leaving who at\nthis point. Thanks.\" She closed her eyes. Her eyelids were mauve, a tracery of\npink veins. She snored softly.\n\nArt set an alarm that would wake him up in time to meet his lawyer, folded up\nhis comm and crawled back into bed. His circadians swelled and crashed against\nthe sides of his skull, and before he knew it, he was out.\n\n6.\n\nHospitals operate around the clock, but they still have their own circadians.\nThe noontime staff were still overworked and harried but chipper and efficient,\ntoo, without the raccoon-eyed jitters of the night before. Art and Linda were\nefficiently fed, watered and evacuated, then left to their own devices, blinking\nin the weak English sunlight that streamed through the windows.\n\n\"The lawyers've worked it out, I think,\" Art said.\n\n\"Good. Good news.\" She was dopamine-heavy, her words lizard-slow. Art figured\nher temper was drugged senseless, and it gave him the courage to ask her the\nquestion that'd been on his mind since they'd met.\n\n\"Can I ask you something? It may be offensive.\"\n\n\"G'head. I may be offended.\"\n\n\"Do you do. . .this. . .a lot? I mean, the insurance thing?\"\n\nShe snorted, then moaned. \"It's the Los Angeles Lottery, dude. I haven't done it\nbefore, but I was starting to feel a little left out, to tell the truth.\"\n\n\"I thought screenplays were the LA Lotto.\"\n\n\"Naw. A good lotto is one you can win.\"\n\nShe favored him with half a smile and he saw that she had a lopsided, left-hand\ndimple.\n\n\"You're from LA, then?\"\n\n\"Got it in one. Orange County. I'm a third-generation failed actor. Grandpa once\nhad a line in a Hitchcock film. Mom was the ditzy neighbor on a three-episode\nFox sitcom in the 90s. I'm still waiting for my moment in the sun. You live\nhere?\"\n\n\"For now. Since September. I'm from Toronto.\"\n\n\"Canadia! Goddamn snowbacks. What are you doing in London?\"\n\nHis comm rang, giving him a moment to gather his cover story. \"Hello?\"\n\n\"Art! It's Fede!\" Federico was another provocateur in GMT. He wasn't exactly\nArt's superior -- the tribes didn't work like that -- but he had seniority.\n\n\"Fede -- can I call you back?\"\n\n\"Look, I heard about your accident, and I wouldn't have called, but it's\nurgent.\"\n\nArt groaned and rolled his eyes in Linda's direction to let her know that he,\ntoo, was exasperated by the call, then retreated to the other side of his bed\nand hunched over.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"We've been sniffed. I'm four-fifths positive.\"\n\nArt groaned again. Fede lived in perennial terror of being found out and exposed\nas an ESTribesman, fired, deported, humiliated. He was always at least\nthree-fifths positive, and the extra fifth was hardly an anomaly. \"What's up\nnow?\"\n\n\"It's the VP of HR at Virgin/Deutsche Telekom. He's called me in for a meeting\nthis afternoon. Wants to go over the core hours recommendation.\" Fede was a\nMcKinsey consultant offline, producing inflammatory recommendation packages for\nFortune 100 companies. He was working the lazy-Euro angle, pushing for extra\ndaycare, time off for sick relatives and spouses. The last policy binder he'd\ndumped on V/DT had contained enough obscure leave-granting clauses that an\nemployee who was sufficiently lawyer-minded could conceivably claim 450 days of\npaid leave a year. Now he was pushing for the abolishment of \"core hours,\"\nCorporate Eurospeak for the time after lunch but before afternoon naps when\neveryone showed up at the office, so that they could get some face-time. Enough\nof this, and GMT would be the laughingstock of the world, and so caught up in\ninternecine struggles that the clear superiority of the stress-feeding EST ethos\nwould sweep them away. That was the theory, anyway. Of course, there were rival\nTribalists in every single management consulting firm in the world working\nagainst us. Management consultants have always worked on old-boys' networks,\nafter all -- it was a very short step from interning your frat buddy to\ninterning your Tribesman.\n\n\"That's it? A meeting? Jesus, it's just a meeting. He probably wants you to\nreassure him before he presents to the CEO, is all.\"\n\n\"No, I'm sure that's not it. He's got us sniffed -- both of us. He's been going\nthrough the product-design stuff, too, which is totally outside of his\nbailiwick. I tried to call him yesterday and his voicemail rolled over to a\nboardroom in O'Malley House.\" O'Malley House was the usability lab, a nice old\nrow of connected Victorian townhouses just off Picadilly. It was where Art\nconsulted out of. Also, two-hundred-odd usability specialists, product\ndesigners, experience engineers, cog-psych cranks and other tinkerers with the\nmind. They were the hairface hackers of Art's generation, unmanageable creative\ndarlings -- no surprise that the VP of HR would have cause to spend a little\nface-time with someone there. Try telling Fede that, though.\n\n\"All right, Fede, what do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Just -- Just be careful. Sanitize your storage. I'm pushing a new personal key\nto you now, too. Here, I'll read you the fingerprint.\" The key would be an\nunimaginably long string of crypto-gibberish, and just to make sure that it\nwasn't intercepted and changed en route, Fede wanted to read him a slightly less\nlong mathematical fingerprint hashed out of it. Once it arrived, Art was\nsupposed to generate a fingerprint from Fede's new key and compare it to the one\nthat Fede wanted him to jot down.\n\nArt closed his eyes and reclined. \"All right, I've got a pen,\" he said, though\nhe had no such thing.\n\nFede read him the long, long string of digits and characters and he repeated\nthem back, pretending to be noting them down. Paranoid bastard.\n\n\"OK, I got it. I'll get you a new key later today, all right?\"\n\n\"Do it quick, man.\"\n\n\"Whatever, Fede. Back off, OK?\"\n\n\"Sorry, sorry. Oh, and feel better, all right?\"\n\n\"Bye, Fede.\"\n\n\"What was *that*?\" Linda had her neck craned around to watch him.\n\nHe slipped into his cover story with a conscious effort. \"I'm a user-experience\nconsultant. My coworkers are all paranoid about a deadline.\"\n\nShe rolled her eyes. \"Not another one. God. Look, we go out for dinner, don't\nsay a word about the kerb design or the waiter or the menu or the presentation,\nOK? OK? I'm serious.\"\n\nArt solemnly crossed his heart. \"Who else do you know in the biz?\"\n\n\"My ex. He wouldn't or couldn't shut up about how much everything sucked. He was\nright, but so what? I wanted to enjoy it, suckitude and all.\"\n\n\"OK, I promise. We're going out for dinner, then?\"\n\n\"The minute I can walk, you're taking me out for as much flesh and entrails as I\ncan eat.\"\n\n\"It's a deal.\"\n\nAnd then they both slept again.\n\n7.\n\nMet cute, huh? Linda was short and curvy, dark eyes and pursed lips and an\nhourglass figure that she thought made her look topheavy and big-assed, but I\nthought she was fabulous and soft and bouncy. She tasted like pepper, and her\nhair smelled of the abstruse polymers that kept it hanging in a brusque bob that\nbrushed her firm, long jawline.\n\nI'm getting a sunburn, and the pebbles on the roof are digging into my ass. I\ndon't know if I'm going to push the pencil or not, but if I do, it's going to be\nsomewhere more comfortable than this roof.\n\nExcept that the roof door, which I had wedged open before I snuck away from my\nattendants and slunk up the firecode-mandated stairwell, is locked. The small\ncairn of pebbles that I created in front of it has been strewn apart. It is\nlocked tight. And me without my comm. Ah, me. I take an inventory of my person:\na pencil, a hospital gown, a pair of boxer shorts and a head full of bad cess. I\nam 450' above the summery, muggy, verdant Massachusetts countryside. It is very\nhot, and I am turning the color of the Barbie aisle at FAO Schwartz, a kind of\nlabial pink that is both painful and perversely cheerful.\n\nI've spent my life going in the back door and coming out the side door. That's\nthe way it is now. When it only takes two years for your job to morph into\nsomething that would have been unimaginable twenty-four months before, it's not\nreally practical to go in through the front door. Not really practical to get\nthe degree, the certification, the appropriate experience. I mean, even if you\nwent back to university, the major you'd need by the time you graduated would be\nin a subject that hadn't been invented when you enrolled. So I'm good at back\ndoors and side doors. It's what the Tribe does for me -- provides me with\nentries into places where I technically don't belong. And thank God for them,\nanyway. Without the Tribes, *no one* would be qualified to do *anything* worth\ndoing.\n\nGoing out the side door has backfired on me today, though.\n\nOh. Shit. I peer over the building's edge, down into the parking lot. The cars\nare thinly spread, the weather too fine for anyone out there in the real world\nto be visiting with their crazy relatives. Half a dozen beaters are parked down\nthere, methane-breathers that the ESTalists call fartmobiles. I'd been driving\nsomething much the same on that fateful Leap Forward day in London. I left\nsomething out of my inventory: pebbles. The roof is littered, covered with a\nlayer of gray, round riverstones, about the size of wasabi chickpeas. No one\ndown there is going to notice me all the way up here. Not without that I give\nthem a sign. A cracked windshield or two ought to do it.\n\nI gather a small pile of rocks by the roof's edge and carefully take aim. I have\nto be cautious. Careful. A pebble dropped from this height -- I remember the\nstories about the penny dropped from the top of the CN Tower that sunk six\ninches into the concrete below.\n\nI select a small piece of gravel and carefully aim for the windshield of a\nlittle blue Sony Veddic and it's bombs away. I can only follow the stone's\nprogress for a few seconds before my eyes can no longer disambiguate it from the\nsurrounding countryside. What little I do see of its trajectory is\ndisheartening, though: the wind whips it away on an almost horizontal parabola,\noff towards Boston. Forgetting all about Newton, I try lobbing and then hurling\nthe gravel downward, but it gets taken away, off to neverneverland, and the\nwindscreens remain whole.\n\nI go off to prospect for bigger rocks.\n\nYou know the sort of horror movie where the suspense builds and builds and\nbuilds, partially collapsed at regular intervals by something jumping out and\nyelling \"Boo!\" whereupon the heroes have to flee, deeper into danger, and the\ntension rises and rises? You know how sometimes the director just doesn't know\nwhen to quit, and the bogeymen keep jumping out and yelling boo, the wobbly\nbridges keep on collapsing, the small arms fire keeps blowing out more windows\nin the office tower?\n\nIt's not like the tension goes away -- it just get boring. Boring tension. You\nknow that the climax is coming soon, that any minute now Our Hero will face down\nthe archvillain and either kick his ass or have his ass kicked, the whole world\nriding on the outcome. You know that it will be satisfying, with much explosions\nand partial nudity. You know that afterward, Our Hero will retire to the\nspace-bar and chill out and collect kisses from the love interest and that we'll\nall have a moment to get our adrenals back under control before the hand pops\nout of the grave and we all give a nervous jump and start eagerly anticipating\nthe sequel.\n\nYou just wish it would *happen* already. You just wish that the little climaces\ncould be taken as read, that the director would trust the audience to know that\nOur Hero really does wade through an entire ocean of shit en route to the final\nshowdown.\n\nI'm bored with being excited. I've been betrayed, shot at, institutionalized and\nstranded on the roof of a nuthouse, and I just want the fucking climax to come\nby and happen to me, so that I can know: smart or happy.\n\nI've found a half-brick that was being used to hold down the tar paper around an\nexhaust-chimney. I should've used that to hold the door open, but it's way the\nhell the other side of the roof, and I'd been really pleased with my little\npebbly doorstop. Besides, I'm starting to suspect that the doorjamb didn't fail,\nthat it was sabotaged by some malevolently playful goon from the sanatorium. An\nobject lesson or something.\n\nI heft the brick. I release the brick. It falls, and falls, and falls, and hits\nthe little blue fartmobile square on the trunk, punching a hole through the\ncheap aluminum lid.\n\nAnd the fartmobile explodes. First there is a geyser of blue flame as the tank's\npuncture wound jets a stream of ignited assoline skyward, and then it blows back\ninto the tank and *boom*, the fartmobile is in one billion shards, rising like a\nparachute in an updraft. I can feel the heat on my bare, sun-tender skin, even\nfrom this distance.\n\nExplosions. Partial nudity. Somehow, though, I know that this isn't the climax.\n\n8.\n\nLinda didn't like to argue -- fight: yes, argue: no. That was going to be a\nproblem, Art knew, but when you're falling in love, you're able to rationalize\nall kinds of things.\n\nThe yobs who cornered them on the way out of a bloody supper of contraband,\nantisocial animal flesh were young, large and bristling with testosterone. They\nwore killsport armor with strategic transparent panels that revealed their\nsteroid-curdled muscles, visible through the likewise transparent insets they'd\nhad grafted in place of the skin that covered their abs and quads. There were\nthree of them, grinning and flexing, and they boxed in Art and Linda in the\ntiny, shuttered entrance of a Boots Pharmacy.\n\n\"Evening, sir, evening, miss,\" one said.\n\n\"Hey,\" Art muttered and looked over the yob's shoulder, trying to spot a secam\nor a cop. Neither was in sight.\n\n\"I wonder if we could beg a favor of you?\" another said.\n\n\"Sure,\" Art said.\n\n\"You're American, aren't you?\" the third said.\n\n\"Canadian, actually.\"\n\n\"Marvelous. Bloody marvelous. I hear that Canada's a lovely place. How are you\nenjoying England?\"\n\n\"I live here, actually. I like it a lot.\"\n\n\"Glad to hear that, sir. And you, Miss?\"\n\nLinda was wide-eyed, halfway behind Art. \"It's fine.\"\n\n\"Good to hear,\" the first one said, grinning even more broadly. \"Now, as to that\nfavor. My friends and I, we've got a problem. We've grown bored of our wallets.\nThey are dull and uninteresting.\"\n\n\"And empty,\" the third one interjected, with a little, stoned giggle.\n\n\"Oh yes, and empty. We thought, well, perhaps you visitors from abroad would\nfind them suitable souvenirs of England. We thought perhaps you'd like to trade,\nlike?\"\n\nArt smiled in spite of himself. He hadn't been mugged in London, but he'd heard\nof this. Ever since a pair of Manchester toughs had been acquitted based on the\nclaim that their robbery and menacing of a Pakistani couple had been a simple\ncross-cultural misunderstanding, crafty British yobs had been taking off\nincreasingly baroque scores from tourists.\n\nArt felt the familiar buzz that meant he was about to get into an argument, and\nbefore he knew it, he was talking: \"Do you really think that'd hold up in court?\nI think that even the dimmest judge would be able to tell that the idea of a\nCanadian being mistaken about trading two wallets full of cash for three empty\nones was in no way an error in cross-cultural communication. Really now. If\nyou're going to mug us --\"\n\n\"Mug you, sir? Dear oh dear, who's mugging you?\" the first one said.\n\n\"Well, in that case, you won't mind if we say no, right?\"\n\n\"Well, it would be rather rude,\" the first said. \"After all, we're offering you\na souvenir in the spirit of transatlantic solidarity. Genuine English leather,\nmine is. Belonged to my grandfather.\"\n\n\"Let me see it,\" Art said.\n\n\"Beg pardon?\"\n\n\"I want to see it. If we're going to trade, I should be able to examine the\ngoods first, right?\"\n\n\"All right, sir, all right, here you are.\"\n\nThe wallet was tattered and leather, and it was indeed made in England, as the\nfrayed tag sewn into the billfold attested. Art turned it over in his hands,\nthen, still smiling, emptied the card slot and started paging through the ID.\n\"Lester?\"\n\nLester swore under his breath. \"Les, actually. Hand those over, please -- they\ndon't come with the wallet.\"\n\n\"They don't? But surely a real British wallet is hardly complete without real\nBritish identification. Maybe I could keep the NHS card, something to show\naround to Americans. They think socialized medicine is a fairy tale, you know.\"\n\n\"I really must insist, sir.\"\n\n\"Fuck it, Les,\" the second one said, reaching into his pocket. \"This is stupid.\nGet the money, and let's push off.\"\n\n\"It's not that easy any more, is it?\" the third one said. \"Fellow's got your\nname, Les. 'Sbad.\"\n\n\"Well, yes, of course I do,\" Art said. \"But so what? You three are hardly\nnondescript. You think it'd be hard to pick your faces out of a rogues gallery?\nOh, and wait a minute! Isn't this a trade? What happened to the spirit of\ntransatlantic solidarity?\"\n\n\"Right,\" Les said. \"Don't matter if you've got my name, 'cos we're all friends,\nright, sir?\"\n\n\"Right!\" Art said. He put the tattered wallet in his already bulging jacket\npocket, making a great show of tamping it down so it wouldn't come loose. Once\nhis hand was free, he extended it. \"Art Berry. Late of Toronto. Pleased to\nmeetcha!\"\n\nLes shook his hand. \"I'm Les. These are my friends, Tony and Tom.\"\n\n\"Fuck!\" Tom, the second one, said. \"Les, you stupid cunt! Now they got our\nnames, too!\" The hand he'd put in his pocket came out, holding a tazer that\nsparked and hummed. \"Gotta get rid of 'em now.\"\n\nArt smiled, and reached very slowly into his pocket. He pulled out his comm,\ndislodging Les's wallet so that it fell to the street. Les, Tom and Tony stared\nat the glowing comm in his hand. \"Could you repeat that, Tom? I don't think the\n999 operator heard you clearly.\"\n\nTom stared dumbfounded at the comm, watching it as though it were a snake. The\nnumbers \"999\" were clearly visible on its display, along with the position data\nthat pinpointed its location to the meter. Les turned abruptly and began walking\nbriskly towards the tube station. In a moment, Tony followed, leaving Tom alone,\nthe tazer still hissing and spitting. His face contorted with frustrated anger,\nand he feinted with the tazer, barking a laugh when Art and Linda cringed back,\nthen he took off at a good run after his mates.\n\nArt clamped the comm to his head. \"They've gone away,\" he announced, prideful.\n\"Did you get that exchange? There were three of them and they've gone away.\"\n\nFrom the comm came a tight, efficient voice, a male emergency operator. The\nspeech was accented, and it took a moment to place it. Then Art remembered that\nthe overnight emergency call-centers had been outsourced by the English\ngovernment to low-cost cube-farms in Manila. \"Yes, Mr. Berry.\" His comm had\nalready transmitted his name, immigration status and location, creating a degree\nof customization more typical of fast-food delivery than governmental\nbureaucracies. That was bad, Art thought, professionally. GMT polezeidom was\nmeant to be a solid wall of oatmeal-thick bureaucracy, courtesy of some crafty,\nanonymous PDTalist. \"Please, stay at your current location. The police will be\non the scene shortly. Very well done, sir.\"\n\nArt turned to Linda, triumphant, ready for the traditional, postrhetorical\naccolades that witnesses of his verbal acrobatics were wont to dole out, and\nfound her in an attitude of abject terror. Her eyes were crazily wide, the\nwhites visible around the irises -- something he'd read about but never seen\nfirsthand. She was breathing shallowly and had gone ashen.\n\nThough they were not an actual couple yet, Art tried to gather her into his arms\nfor some manly comforting, but she was stiff in his embrace, and after a moment,\nplanted her palms on his chest and pushed him back firmly, even aggressively.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" he asked. He was adrenalized, flushed.\n\n\"*What if they'd decided to kill us*?\" she said, spittle flying from her lips.\n\n\"Oh, they weren't going to hurt us,\" he said. \"No guts at all.\"\n\n\"God*dammit*, you didn't know that! Where do you get off playing around with\n*my* safety? Why the hell didn't you just hand over your wallet, call the cops\nand be done with it? Macho fucking horseshit!\"\n\nThe triumph was fading, fast replaced by anger. \"What's wrong with you? Do you\nalways have to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory? I just beat off those\nthree assholes without raising a hand, and all you want to do is criticize?\nChrist, OK, next time we can hand over our wallets. Maybe they'll want a little\nrape, too -- should I go along with that? You just tell me what the rules are,\nand I'll be sure and obey them.\"\n\n\"You fucking *pig*! Where the fuck do you get off raising your voice to me? And\ndon't you *ever* joke about rape. It's not even slightly funny, you arrogant\nfucking prick.\"\n\nArt's triumph deflated. \"Jesus,\" he said, \"Jesus, Linda, I'm sorry. I didn't\nrealize how scared you must have been --\"\n\n\"You don't know what you're talking about. I've been mugged a dozen times. I\nhand over my wallet, cancel my cards, go to my insurer. No one's ever hurt me. I\nwasn't the least bit scared until you opened up your big goddamned mouth.\"\n\n\"Sorry, sorry. Sorry about the rape crack. I was just trying to make a point. I\ndidn't know --\" He wanted to say, *I didn't know you'd been raped*, but thought\nbetter of it -- \"it was so...*personal* for you --\"\n\n\"Oh, Christ. Just because I don't want to joke about rape, you think I'm some\nkind of *victim*, that *I've* been raped\" -- Art grimaced -- \"well, I haven't,\nshithead. But it's not something you should be using as a goddamned example in\none of your stupid points. Rape is serious.\"\n\nThe cops arrived then, two of them on scooters, looking like meter maids. Art\nand Linda glared at each other for a moment, then forced smiles at the cops, who\nhad dismounted and shed their helmets. They were young men, in their twenties,\nand to Art, they looked like kids playing dress up.\n\n\"Evening sir, miss,\" one said. \"I'm PC McGivens and this is PC DeMoss. You\ncalled emergency services?\" McGivens had his comm out and it was pointed at\nthem, slurping in their identity on police override.\n\n\"Yes,\" Art said. \"But it's OK now. They took off. One of them left his wallet\nbehind.\" He bent and picked it up and made to hand it to PC DeMoss, who was\ncloser. The cop ignored it.\n\n\"Please sir, put that down. We'll gather the evidence.\"\n\nArt lowered it to the ground, felt himself blushing. His hands were shaking now,\nwhether from embarrassment, triumph or hurt he couldn't say. He held up his\nnow-empty palms in a gesture of surrender.\n\n\"Step over here, please, sir,\" PC McGivens said, and led him off a short ways,\nwhile PC Blaylock closed on Linda.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" McGivens said, in a businesslike way, \"please tell me exactly what\nhappened.\"\n\nSo Art did, tastefully omitting the meat-parlor where the evening's festivities\nhad begun. He started to get into it, to evangelize his fast-thinking bravery\nwith the phone. McGivens obliged him with a little grin.\n\n\"Very good. Now, again, please, sir?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry?\" Art said.\n\n\"Can you repeat it, please? Procedure.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Can't really say, sir. It's procedure.\"\n\nArt thought about arguing, but managed to control the impulse. The man was a\ncop, he was a foreigner -- albeit a thoroughly documented one -- and what would\nit cost? He'd probably left something out anyway.\n\nHe retold the story from the top, speaking slowly and clearly. PC McGivens aimed\nhis comm Artwards, and tapped out the occasional note as Art spoke.\n\n\"Thank you sir. Now, once more, please?\"\n\nArt blew out an exasperated sigh. His feet hurt, and his bladder was swollen\nwith drink. \"You're joking.\"\n\n\"No sir, I'm afraid not. Procedure.\"\n\n\"But it's stupid! The guys who tried to mug us are long gone, I've given you\ntheir descriptions, you have their *identification* --\" But they didn't, not\nyet. The wallet still lay where Art had dropped it.\n\nPC McGivens shook his head slowly, as though marveling at the previously\nunsuspected inanity of his daily round. \"All very true, sir, but it's procedure.\nWorked out by some clever lad using statistics. All this, it increases our\nsuccess rate. 'Sproven.\"\n\nHere it was. Some busy tribalist provocateur, some compatriot of Fede, had\nstirred the oats into Her Majesty's Royal Constabulary. Art snuck a look at\nLinda, who was no doubt being subjected to the same procedure by PC DeMoss.\nShe'd lost her rigid, angry posture, and was seemingly -- amazingly -- enjoying\nherself, chatting up the constable like an old pal.\n\n\"How many more times have we got to do this, officer?\"\n\n\"This is the last time you'll have to repeat it to me.\"\n\nArt's professional instincts perked up at the weasel words in the sentence. \"To\nyou? Who else do I need to go over this with?\"\n\nThe officer shook his head, caught out. \"Well, you'll have to repeat it three\ntimes to PC DeMoss, once he's done with your friend, sir. Procedure.\"\n\n\"How about this,\" Art says, \"how about I record this last statement to you with\nmy comm, and then I can *play it back* three times for PC DeMoss?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure that won't do, sir. Not really the spirit of the thing, is it?\"\n\n\"And what *is* the spirit of the thing? Humiliation? Boredom? An exercise in raw\npower?\"\n\nPC McGivens lost his faint smile. \"I really couldn't say, sir. Now, again if you\nplease?\"\n\n\"What if I don't please? I haven't been assaulted. I haven't been robbed. It's\nnone of my business. What if I walk away right now?\"\n\n\"Not really allowed, sir. It's expected that everyone in England -- HM's\nsubjects *and her guests* -- will assist the police with their inquiries.\nRequired, actually.\"\n\nReminded of his precarious immigration status, Art lost his attitude. \"Once more\nfor you, three more times for your partner, and we're done, right? I want to get\nhome.\"\n\n\"We'll see, sir.\"\n\nArt recited the facts a third time, and they waited while Linda finished her\nthird recounting.\n\nHe switched over to PC DeMoss, who pointed his comm expectantly. \"Is all this\njust to make people reluctant to call the cops? I mean, this whole procedure\nseems like a hell of a disincentive.\"\n\n\"Just the way we do things, sir,\" PC DeMoss said without rancor. \"Now, let's\nhave it, if you please?\"\n\nFrom a few yards away, Linda laughed at something PC McGivens said, which just\nescalated Art's frustration. He spat out the description three times fast. \"Now,\nI need to find a toilet. Are we done yet?\"\n\n\"'Fraid not, sir. Going to have to come by the Station House to look through\nsome photos. There's a toilet there.\"\n\n\"It can't wait that long, officer.\"\n\nPC DeMoss gave him a reproachful look.\n\n\"I'm sorry, all right?\" Art said. \"I lack the foresight to empty my bladder\nbefore being accosted in the street. That being said, can we arrive at some kind\nof solution?\" In his head, Art was already writing an angry letter to the\n*Times*, dripping with sarcasm.\n\n\"Just a moment, sir,\" PC DeMoss said. He conferred briefly with his partner,\nleaving Art to stare ruefully at their backs and avoid Linda's gaze. When he\nfinally met it, she gave him a sunny smile. It seemed that she -- at least --\nwasn't angry any more.\n\n\"Come this way, please, sir,\" PC DeMoss said, striking off for the High Street.\n\"There's a pub 'round the corner where you can use the facilities.\"\n\n9.\n\nIt was nearly dawn before they finally made their way out of the police station\nand back into the street. After identifying Les from an online rogues' gallery,\nArt had spent the next six hours sitting on a hard bench, chording desultorily\non his thigh, doing some housekeeping.\n\nThis business of being an agent-provocateur was complicated in the extreme,\nthough it had sounded like a good idea when he was living in San Francisco and\nhating every inch of the city, from the alleged pizza to the fucking! drivers!\n-- in New York, the theory went, drivers used their horns by way of shouting\n\"Ole!\" as in, \"Ole! You changed lanes!\" \"Ole! You cut me off!\" \"Ole! You're\ndriving on the sidewalk!\" while in San Francisco, a honking horn meant, \"I wish\nyou were dead. Have a nice day. Dude.\"\n\nAnd the body language was all screwed up out west. Art believed that your entire\nunconscious affect was determined by your upbringing. You learned how to stand,\nhow to hold your face in repose, how to gesture, from the adults around you\nwhile you were growing up. The Pacific Standard Tribe always seemed a little\nbovine to him, their facial muscles long conditioned to relax into a kind of\nspacey, gullible senescence.\n\nBeauty, too. Your local definition of attractive and ugly was conditioned by the\npeople around you at puberty. There was a Pacific \"look\" that was indefinably\noff. Hard to say what it was, just that when he went out to a bar or got stuck\non a crowded train, the girls just didn't seem all that attractive to him.\nObjectively, he could recognize their prettiness, but it didn't stir him the way\nthe girls cruising the Chelsea Antiques Market or lounging around Harvard Square\ncould.\n\nHe'd always felt at a slight angle to reality in California, something that was\nreinforced by his continuous efforts in the Tribe, from chatting and gaming\nuntil the sun rose, dragging his caffeine-deficient ass around to his clients in\na kind of fog before going home, catching a nap and hopping back online at 3 or\n4 when the high-octane NYC early risers were practicing work-avoidance and\nclattering around with their comms.\n\nGradually, he penetrated deeper into the Tribe, getting invites into private\nchannels, intimate environments where he found himself spilling the most private\ndetails of his life. The Tribe stuck together, finding work for each other,\noffering advice, and it was only a matter of time before someone offered him a\ngig.\n\nThat was Fede, who practically invented Tribal agent-provocateurs. He'd been\nworking for McKinsey, systematically undermining their GMT-based clients with\nplausibly terrible advice, creating Achilles' heels that their East-coast\ncompetitors could exploit. The entire European trust-architecture for relay\nnetworks had been ceded by Virgin/Deutsche Telekom to a scrappy band of AT&T\nLabs refugees whose New Jersey headquarters hosted all the cellular reputation\ndata that Euros' comms consulted when they were routing their calls. The Jersey\nclients had funneled a nice chunk of the proceeds to Fede's account in the form\nof rigged winnings from an offshore casino that the Tribe used to launder its\nmoney.\n\nNow V/DT was striking back, angling for a government contract in Massachusetts,\na fat bit of pork for managing payments to rightsholders whose media was\nassessed at the MassPike's tollbooths. Rights-societies were a fabulous\nopportunity to skim and launder and spindle money in plenty, and Virgin's\nmassive repertoire combined with Deutsche Telekom's Teutonic attention to detail\nwas a tough combination to beat. Needless to say, the Route 128-based Tribalists\nwho had the existing contract needed an edge, and would pay handsomely for it.\n\nLondon nights seemed like a step up from San Francisco mornings to Art --\ninstead of getting up at 4AM to get NYC, he could sleep in and chat them up\nthrough the night. The Euro sensibility, with its many nap-breaks, statutory\nholidays and extended vacations seemed ideally suited to a double agent's life.\n\nBut Art hadn't counted on the Tribalists' hands-on approach to his work. They\nobsessively grepped his daily feed of spreadsheets, whiteboard-output, memos and\nconversation reports for any of ten thousand hot keywords, querying him for\ndeeper detail on trivial, half-remembered bullshit sessions with the V/DT's user\nexperience engineers. His comm buzzed and blipped at all hours, and his payoff\nwas dependent on his prompt response. They were running him ragged.\n\nFour hours in the police station gave Art ample opportunity to catch up on the\nbacklog of finicky queries. Since the accident, he'd been distracted and tardy,\nand had begun to invent his responses, since it all seemed so trivial to him\nanyway.\n\nFede had sent him about a thousand nagging notes reminding him to generate a new\nkey and phone with the fingerprint. Christ. Fede had been with McKinsey for most\nof his adult life, and he was superparanoid about being exposed and disgraced in\ntheir ranks. Art's experience with the other McKinsey people around the office\nsuggested that the notion of any of those overpaid buzzword-slingers sniffing\ntheir traffic was about as likely as a lightning strike. Heaving a dramatic sigh\nfor his own benefit, he began the lengthy process of generating enough\nrandomness to seed the key, mashing the keyboard, whispering nonsense syllables,\nand pointing the comm's camera lens at arbitrary corners of the police station.\nAfter ten minutes of crypto-Tourette's, the comm announced that he'd been\nsufficiently random and prompted him for a passphrase. Jesus. What a pain in the\nass. He struggled to recall all the words to the theme song from a CBC sitcom\nhe'd watched as a kid, and then his comm went into a full-on churn as it\nlaboriously re-ciphered all of his stored files with the new key, leaving Art to\nlogin while he waited.\n\nTrepan: Afternoon!\n\nColonelonic: Hey, Trepan. How's it going?\n\nTrepan: Foul. I'm stuck at a copshop in London with my thumb up my ass. I got\nmugged.\n\nColonelonic: Yikes! You OK?\n\nBallgravy: Shit!\n\nTrepan: Oh, I'm fine -- just bored. They didn't hurt me. I commed 999 while they\nwere running their game and showed it to them when they got ready to do the\ndeed, so they took off.\n\n##Colonelonic laughs\n\nBallgravy: Britain==ass. Lon-dong.\n\nColonelonic: Sweet!\n\nTrepan: Thanks. Now if the cops would only finish the paperwork...\n\nColonelonic: What are you doing in London, anyway?\n\nBallgravy: Ass ass ass\n\nColonelonic: Shut up, Bgravy\n\nBallgravy: Blow me\n\nTrepan: What's wrong with you, Ballgravy? We're having a grown-up conversation\nhere\n\nBallgravy: Just don't like Brits.\n\nTrepan: What, all of them?\n\nBallgravy: Whatever -- all the ones I've met have been tight-ass pricks\n\n##Colonelonic: (private) He's just a troll, ignore him\n\nprivate Colonelonic: Watch this\n\nTrepan: How many?\n\nBallgravy: How many what?\n\nTrepan: Have you met?\n\nBallgravy: Enough\n\nTrepan: > 100?\n\nBallgravy: No\n\nTrepan: > 50?\n\nBallgravy: No\n\nTrepan: > 10?\n\nBallgravy: Around 10\n\nTrepan: Where are you from?\n\nBallgravy: Queens\n\nTrepan: Well, you're not going to believe this, but you're the tenth person from\nQueens I've met -- and you're all morons who pick fights with strangers in\nchat-rooms\n\nColonelonic: Queens==ass\n\nTrepan: Ass ass ass\n\nBallgravy: Fuck you both\n\n##Ballgravy has left channel #EST.chatter\n\nColonelonic: Nicely done\n\nColonelonic: He's been boring me stupid for the past hour, following me from\nchannel to channel\n\nColonelonic: What are you doing in London, anyway?\n\nTrepan: Like I said, waiting for the cops\n\nColonelonic: But why are you there in the first place\n\nTrepan: /private Colonelonic It's a work thing.

He approached the desk sergeant and asked if he\nthought it would be much longer. The sergeant fiddled with a comm for a moment,\nthen said, \"Oh, we're quite done with you sir, thank you.\" Art repressed a\nvituperative response, counted three, then thanked the cop.\n\nHe commed Linda.\n\n\"What's up?\"\n\n\"They say we're free to go. I think they've been just keeping us here for shits\nand giggles. Can you believe that?\"\n\n\"Whatever -- I've been having a nice chat with Constable McGivens. Constable, is\nit all right if we go now?\"\n\nThere was some distant, English rumbling, then Linda giggled. \"All right, then.\nThank you so much, officer!\n\n\"Art? I'll meet you at the front doors, all right?\"\n\n\"That's great,\" Art said. He stretched. His ass was numb, his head throbbed, and\nhe wanted to strangle Linda.\n\nShe emerged into the dawn blinking and grinning, and surprised him with a long,\nfull-body hug. \"Sorry I was so snappish before,\" she said. \"I was just scared.\nThe cops say that you were quite brave. Thank you.\"\n\nArt's adrenals dry-fired as he tried to work up a good angry head of steam, then\nhe gave up. \"It's all right.\"\n\n\"Let's go get some breakfast, OK?\"\n\n10.\n\nThe parking-lot is aswarm with people, fire engines and ambulances. There's a\nsiren going off somewhere down in the bowels of the sanatorium, and still I\ncan't get anyone to look up at the goddamned roof.\n\nI've tried hollering myself hoarse into the updrafts from the cheery blaze, but\nthe wind's against me, my shouts rising up past my ears. I've tried dropping\nmore pebbles, but the winds whip them away, and I've learned my lesson about\nhalf-bricks.\n\nWeirdly, I'm not worried about getting into trouble. I've already been\ninvoluntarily committed by the Tribe's enemies, the massed and devious forces of\nthe Pacific Daylight Tribe and the Greenwich Mean Tribe. I am officially Not\nResponsible. Confused and Prone to Wandering. Coo-Coo for Coco-Puffs. It's not\nlike I hurt anyone, just decremented the number of roadworthy fartmobiles by\none.\n\nI got up this morning at four, awakened by the tiniest sound from the ward\ncorridors, a wheel from a pharmaceuticals tray maybe. Three weeks on medically\nprescribed sleepytime drugs have barely scratched the surface of the damage\nwrought by years of circadian abuse. I'd been having a fragile shadow of a\ndream, the ghost of a REM cycle, and it was the old dream, the dream of the\ndoctor's office and the older kids who could manage the trick of making a\npicture into reality.\n\nI went from that state to total wakefulness in an instant, and knew to a\ncertainty that I wouldn't be sleeping again any time soon. I paced my small\nroom, smelled the cheerful flowers my cousins brought last week when they\nvisited from Toronto, watched the horizon for signs of a breaking dawn. I wished\nfutilely for my comm and a nice private channel where I could sling some\nbullshit and have some slung in my direction, just connect with another human\nbeing at a nice, safe remove.\n\nThey chide me for arguing on the ward, call it belligerence and try to sidetrack\nme with questions about my motivations, a tactic rating barely above ad hominems\nin my book. No one to talk to -- the other patients get violent or nod off,\ndepending on their medication levels, and the staff just patronize me.\n\nFour AM and I'm going nuts, hamsters in my mind spinning their wheels at a\nthousand RPM, chittering away. I snort -- if I wasn't crazy to begin with, I'm\nsure getting there.\n\nThe hamsters won't stop arguing with each other over all the terrible errors of\njudgment I've made to get here. Trusting the Tribe, trusting strangers. Argue,\nargue, argue. God, if only someone else were around, I could argue the\ndefinition of sanity, I could argue the ethics of involuntary committal, I could\nargue the food. But my head is full of argument and there's nowhere to spill it\nand soon enough I'll be talking aloud, arguing with the air like the schizoids\non the ward who muttergrumbleshout through the day and through the night.\n\nWhy didn't I just leave London when I could, come home, move in with Gran, get a\nregular job? Why didn't I swear off the whole business of secrecy and\nprovocation?\n\nI was too smart for my own good. I could always argue myself into doing the\nsexy, futuristic thing instead of being a nice, mundane, nonaffiliated\nindividual. Too smart to settle down, take a job and watch TV after work, spend\ntwo weeks a year at the cottage and go online to find movie listings. Too smart\nis too restless and no happiness, ever, without that it's chased by obsessive\nmaundering moping about what comes next.\n\nSmart or happy?\n\nThe hamsters have hopped off their wheels and are gnawing at the blood-brain\nbarrier, trying to get out of my skull. This is a good sanatorium, but still,\nthe toilets are communal on my floor, which means that I've got an unlocked door\nthat lights up at the nurses' station down the corridor when I open the door,\nand goes berserk if I don't reopen it again within the mandated fifteen-minute\nmaximum potty-break. I figured out how to defeat the system the first day, but\nit was a theoretical hack, and now it's time to put it into practice.\n\nI step out the door and the lintel goes pink, deepens toward red. Once it's red,\nwhoopwhoopwhoop. I pad down to the lav, step inside, wait, step out again. I go\nback to my room -- the lintel is orange now -- and open it, move my torso across\nthe long electric eye, then pull it back and let the door swing closed. The\nlintel is white, and that means that the room thinks I'm inside, but I'm\noutside. You put your torso in, you take your torso out, you do the hokey-pokey\nand you shake it all about.\n\nIn the corridor. I pad away from the nurses' station, past the closed doors and\nthrough the muffled, narcotized groans and snores and farts that are the\ntwilight symphony of night on the ward. I duck past an intersection, head for\nthe elevator doors, then remember the tattletale I'm wearing on my ankle, which\nwill go spectacularly berserk if I try to leave by that exit. Also, I'm in my\nunderwear. I can't just walk nonchalantly into the lobby.\n\nThe ward is making wakeful sounds, and I'm sure I hear the soft tread of a\nwhite-soled shoe coming round the bend. I double my pace, begin to jog at random\n-- the hamsters, they tell me I'm acting with all the forethought of a crazy\nperson, and why not just report for extra meds instead of all this *mishegas*?\n\nThere's definitely someone coming down a nearby corridor. The tread of sneakers,\nthe squeak of a wheel. I've seen what they do to the wanderers: a nice chemical\nstraightjacket, a cocktail of pills that'll quiet the hamsters down for days.\nTime to get gone.\n\nThere's an EXIT sign glowing over a door at the far end of the corridor. I pant\ntowards it, find it propped open and the alarm system disabled by means of a\nstrip of surgical tape. Stepping through into the emergency stairwell, I see an\nashtray fashioned from a wadded up bit of tinfoil, heaped with butts -- evidence\nof late-night smoke breaks by someone on the ward staff. Massachusetts's harsh\nantismoking regs are the best friend an escaping loony ever had.\n\nThe stairwell is gray and industrial and refreshingly hard-edged after three\npadded weeks on the ward. Down, down is the exit and freedom. Find clothes\nsomewhere and out I go into Boston.\n\nFrom below, then: the huffing, laborious breathing of some goddamned overweight,\nmiddle-aged doc climbing the stairs for his health. I peer down the well and see\nhis gleaming pate, his white knuckles on the railing, two, maybe three flights\ndown.\n\nUp! Up to the roof. I'm on the twentieth floor, which means that I've got\ntwenty-five more to go, two flights per, fifty in total, gotta move. Up! I stop\ntwo or three times and pant and wheeze and make it ten stories and collapse. I'm\nsweating freely -- no air-conditioning in the stairwell, nor is there anything\nto mop up the sweat rolling down my body, filling the crack of my ass, coursing\ndown my legs. I press my face to the cool painted cinderblock walls, one cheek\nand then the other, and continue on.\n\nWhen I finally open the door that leads out onto the pebbled roof, the dawn cool\nis balm. Fingers of light are hauling the sunrise up over the horizon. I step\nonto the roof and feel the pebbles dig into the soft soles of my feet, cool as\nthe bottom of the riverbed whence they'd been dredged. The door starts to swing\nshut heavily behind me, and I whirl and catch it just in time, getting my\nfingers mashed against the jamb for my trouble. I haul it back open again\nagainst its pneumatic closure mechanism.\n\nUsing the side of my foot as a bulldozer, I scrape up a cairn of pebbles as high\nas the door's bottom edge, twice as high. I fall into the rhythm of the work,\nmaking the cairn higher and wider until I can't close the door no matter how I\npush against it. The last thing I want is to get stuck on the goddamn roof.\n\nThere's detritus mixed in with the pebbles: cigarette butts, burnt out matches,\na condom wrapper and a bright yellow Eberhard pencil with a point as sharp as a\nspear, the eraser as pink and softly resilient as a nipple.\n\nI pick up the pencil and twiddle it between forefinger and thumb, tap a nervous\nrattle against the roof's edge as I dangle my feet over the bottomless plummet\nuntil the sun is high and warm on my skin.\n\nThe hamsters get going again once the sun is high and the cars start pulling\ninto the parking lot below, rattling and chittering and whispering, yes o yes,\nput the pencil in your nose, wouldn't you rather be happy than smart?\n\n11.\n\nArt and Linda in Linda's miniscule joke of a flat. She's two months into a\nsix-month house-swap with some friends of friends who have a fourth-storey\nwalkup in Kensington with a partial (i.e. fictional) view of the park. The\nlights are on timers and you need to race them to her flat's door, otherwise\nthere's no way you'll fit the archaic key into the battered keyhole -- the\nwindows in the stairwell are so grimed as to provide more of a suggestion of\nlight than light itself.\n\nArt's ass aches and he paces the flat's three wee rooms and drinks\nhormone-enhanced high-energy liquid breakfast from the half-fridge in the\nefficiency kitchen. Linda's taken dibs on the first shower, which is fine by\nArt, who can't get the hang of the goddamned-English-plumbing, which delivers an\nenergy-efficient, eat-your-vegetables-and-save-the-planet trickle of scalding\nwater.\n\nArt has switched off his comm, his frazzled nerves no longer capable of coping\nwith its perennial and demanding beeping and buzzing. This is very nearly\nunthinkable but necessary, he rationalizes, given the extraordinary events of\nthe past twenty-four hours. And Fede can go fuck himself, for that matter, that\nparanoid asshole, and then he can fuck the clients in Jersey and the whole of\nV/DT while he's at it.\n\nThe energy bev is kicking in and making his heart race and his pulse throb in\nhis throat and he's so unbearably hyperkinetic that he turns the coffee table on\nits end in the galley kitchen and clears a space in the living room that's\nbarely big enough to spin around in, and starts to work through a slow, slow set\nof Tai Chi, so slow that he barely moves at all, except that inside he can feel\nthe moving, can feel the muscles' every flex and groan as they wind up release,\nmove and swing and slide.\n\nSingle whip slides into crane opens wings and he needs to crouch down low, lower\nthan his woolen slacks will let him, and they're grimy and gross anyway, so he\nundoes his belt and kicks them off. Down low as white crane opens wings and\nbrush knee, punch, apparent closure, then low again, creakingly achingly low\ninto wave hands like clouds, until his spine and his coccyx crackle and give,\nspringing open, fascia open ribs open smooth breath rising and falling with his\ndiaphragm smooth mind smooth and sweat cool in the mat of his hair.\n\nHe moves through the set and does not notice Linda until he unwinds into a slow,\nponderous lotus kick, closes again, breathes a moment and looks around slowly,\ngrinning like a holy fool.\n\nShe's in a tartan housecoat with a threadbare towel wrapped around her hair,\nwater beading on her bony ankles and long, skinny feet. \"Art! God*damn*, Art!\nWhat the hell was that?\"\n\n\"Tai chi,\" he says, drawing a deep breath in through his nostrils, feeling each\nrib expand in turn, exhaling through his mouth. \"I do it to unwind.\"\n\n\"It was beautiful! Art! Art. Art. That was, I mean, wow. Inspiring. Something.\nYou're going to show me how to do that, Art. Right? You're gonna.\"\n\n\"I could try,\" Art says. \"I'm not really qualified to teach it -- I stopped\ngoing to class ten years ago.\"\n\n\"Shut, shut up, Art. You can teach that, damn, you can teach that, I know you\ncan. That was, wow.\" She rushes forward and takes his hands. She squeezes and\nlooks into his eyes. She squeezes again and tugs his hands towards her hips,\nreeling his chest towards her breasts tilting her chin up and angling that long\njawline that's so long as to be almost horsey, but it isn't, it's strong and\nclean. Art smells shampoo and sandalwood talc and his skin puckers in a crinkle\nthat's so sudden and massive that it's almost audible.\n\nThey've been together continuously for the past five days, almost without\ninterruption and he's already conditioned to her smell and her body language and\nthe subtle signals of her face's many mobile bits and pieces. She is afire, he\nis afire, their bodies are talking to each other in some secret language of\nshifting centers of gravity and unconscious pheromones, and his face tilts down\ntowards her, slowly with all the time in the world. Lowers and lowers, week-old\nwhiskers actually tickling the tip of her nose, his lips parting now, and her\nbreath moistens them, beads them with liquid condensed out of her vapor.\n\nHis top lip touches her bottom lip. He could leave it at that and be happy, the\ntouch is so satisfying, and he is contented there for a long moment, then moves\nto engage his lower lip, moving, tilting.\n\nHis comm rings.\n\nHis comm, which he has switched off, rings.\n\nShit.\n\n\"Hello!\" he says, he shouts.\n\n\"Arthur?\" says a voice that is old and hurt and melancholy. His Gran's voice.\nHis Gran, who can override his ringer, switch on his comm at a distance because\nArt is a good grandson who was raised almost entirely by his saintly and frail\n(and depressive and melodramatic and obsessive) grandmother, and of course his\ncomm is set to pass her calls. Not because he is a suck, but because he is loyal\nand sensitive and he loves his Gran.\n\n\"Gran, hi! Sorry, I was just in the middle of something, sorry.\" He checks his\ncomm, which tells him that it's only six in the morning in Toronto, noon in\nLondon, and that the date is April 8, and that today is the day that he should\nhave known his grandmother would call.\n\n\"You forgot,\" she says, no accusation, just a weary and disappointed sadness. He\nhas indeed forgotten.\n\n\"No, Gran, I didn't forget.\"\n\nBut he did. It is the eighth of April, 2022, which means that it is twenty-one\nyears to the day since his mother died. And he has forgotten.\n\n\"It's all right. You're busy, I understand. Tell me, Art, how are you? When will\nyou visit Toronto?\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gran. I'm sorry I haven't called, I've been sick.\" Shit. Wrong lie.\n\n\"You're sick? What's wrong?\"\n\n\"It's nothing. I -- I put my back out. Working too hard. Stress. It's nothing,\nGran.\"\n\nHe chances to look up at Linda, who is standing where he left her when he dived\nreflexively for his comm, staring disbelievingly at him. Her robe is open to her\nnavel, and he sees the three curls of pubic hair above the knot in its belt that\ncurl towards her groin, sees the hourglass made by the edges of her breasts that\nare visible in the vee of the robe, sees the edge of one areole, the left one.\nHe is in a tee shirt and bare feet and boxers, crouching over his trousers,\ntalking to his Gran, and he locks eyes with Linda and shakes his head\napologetically, then settles down to sit cross-legged, hunched over an erection\nhe didn't know he had, resolves to look at her while he talks.\n\n\"Stress! Always stress. You should take some vacation time. Are you seeing\nsomeone? A chiropractor?\"\n\nHe's entangled in the lie. \"Yes. I have an appointment tomorrow.\"\n\n\"How will you get there? Don't take the subway. Take a taxi. And give me the\ndoctor's name, I'll look him up.\"\n\n\"I'll take a cab, it'll be fine, he's the only one my travel insurance covers.\"\n\n\"The only one? Art! What kind of insurance do you have? I'll call them, I'll\nfind you a chiropractor. Betty Melville, she has family in London, they'll know\nsomeone.\"\n\nGod. \"It's fine, Gran. How are you?\"\n\nA sigh. \"How am I? On this day, how am I?\"\n\n\"How is your health? Are you keeping busy?\"\n\n\"My health is fine. I keep busy. Father Ferlenghetti came to dinner last night\nat the house. I made a nice roast, and I'll have sandwiches today.\"\n\n\"That's good.\"\n\n\"I'm thinking of your mother, you know.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Do you think of her, Art? You were so young when she went, but you remember\nher, don't you?\"\n\n\"I do, Gran.\" He remembers her, albeit dimly. He was barely nine when she died.\n\n\"Of course -- of course you remember your mother. It's a terrible thing for a\nmother to live longer than her daughter.\"\n\nHis Gran says this every year. Art still hasn't figured out how to respond to\nit. Time for another stab at it. \"I'm glad you're still here, Gran.\"\n\nWrong thing. Gran is sobbing now. Art drops his eyes from Linda's and looks at\nthe crazy weft and woof of the faded old Oriental rug. \"Oh, Gran,\" he says. \"I'm\nsorry.\"\n\nIn truth, Art has mourned and buried his mother. He was raised just fine by his\nGran, and when he remembers his mother, he is more sad about not being sad than\nsad about her.\n\n\"I'm an old lady, you know that. You'll remember me when I go, won't you Art?\"\n\nThis, too, is a ritual question that Art can't answer well enough no matter how\nhe practices. \"Of course, Gran. But you'll be around for a good while yet!\"\n\n\"When are you coming back to Toronto?\" He'd ducked the question before, but\nGran's a master of circling back and upping the ante. *Now that we've\nestablished my imminent demise...*\n\n\"Soon as I can, Gran. Maybe when I finish this contract. September, maybe.\"\n\n\"You'll stay here? I can take the sofa. When do you think you'll arrive? My\nfriends all want to see you again. You remember Mrs. Tomkins? You used to play\nwith her daughter Alice. Alice is single, you know. She has a good job, too --\nworking at an insurance company. Maybe she can get you a better health plan.\"\n\n\"I don't know, Gran. I'll *try* to come back after I finish my contract, but I\ncan't tell what'll be happening then. I'll let you know, OK?\"\n\n\"Oh, Art. Please come back soon -- I miss you. I'm going to visit your mother's\ngrave today and put some flowers on it. They keep it very nice at Mount\nPleasant, and the trees are just blooming now.\"\n\n\"I'll come back as soon as I can, Gran. I love you.\"\n\n\"I love you too, Arthur.\"\n\n\"Bye, Gran.\"\n\n\"I'll call you once I speak to Betty about the chiropractor, all right?\"\n\n\"All right, Gran.\" He is going to have to go to the chiropractor now, even\nthough his back feels as good as it has in years. His Gran will be checking up\non it.\n\n\"Bye, Arthur. I love you.\"\n\n\"Bye, Gran.\"\n\n\"Bye.\"\n\nHe shakes his head and holsters the comm back in his pants, then rocks back and\nlies down on the rug, facing the ceiling, eyes closed. A moment later, the hem\nof Linda's robe brushes his arm and she lies down next to him, takes his hand.\n\n\"Everything OK?\"\n\n\"It's just my Gran.\" And he tells her about this date's significance.\n\n\"How did she die?\"\n\n\"It was stupid. She slipped in the tub and cracked her skull on the tap. I was\noff at a friend's place for the weekend and no one found her for two days. She\nlived for a week on life support, and they pulled the plug. No brain activity.\nThey wouldn't let me into the hospital room after the first day. My Gran\npractically moved in, though. She raised me after that. I think that if she\nhadn't had to take care of me, she would have just given up, you know? She's\npretty lonely back home alone.\"\n\n\"What about your dad?\"\n\n\"You know, there used to be a big mystery about that. Gran and Mom, they were\nalways tragic and secretive when I asked them about him. I had lots of stories\nto explain his absence: ran off with another woman, thrown in jail for running\nguns, murdered in a bar fight. I used to be a bit of a celeb at school -- lots\nof kids didn't have dads around, but they all knew where their fathers were. We\ncould always kill an afternoon making up his who and where and why. Even the\nteachers got into it, getting all apologetic when we had to do a genealogy\nproject. I found out the truth, finally, when I was nineteen. Just looked it up\nonline. It never occurred to me that my mom would be that secretive about\nsomething that was so easy to find out, so I never bothered.\"\n\n\"So, what happened to him?\"\n\n\"Oh, you know. He and mom split when I was a kid. He moved back in with his\nfolks in a little town in the Thousand Islands, near Ottawa. Four or five years\nlater, he got a job planting trees for a summer up north, and he drowned\nswimming in a lake during a party. By the time I found out about him, his folks\nwere dead, too.\"\n\n\"Did you tell your friends about him, once you found out?\"\n\n\"Oh, by then I'd lost touch with most of them. After elementary school, we moved\nacross town, to a condo my grandmother retired into on the lakeshore, out in the\nsuburbs. In high school, I didn't really chum around much, so there wasn't\nanyone to talk to. I did tell my Gran though, asked her why it was such a big\nsecret, and she said it wasn't, she said she'd told me years before, but she\nhadn't. I think that she and Mom just decided to wait until I was older before\ntelling me, and then after my mom died, she just forgot that she hadn't told me.\nWe got into a big fight over that.\"\n\n\"That's a weird story, dude. So, do you think of yourself as an orphan?\"\n\nArt rolls over on his side, face inches from hers, and snorts a laugh. \"God,\nthat's so -- *Dickensian*. No one ever asked me that before. I don't think so.\nYou can't really be an adult and be an orphan -- you're just someone with dead\nparents. And I didn't find out about my dad until I was older, so I always\nfigured that he was alive and well somewhere. What about your folks?\"\n\nLinda rolls over on her side, too, her robe slipping off her lower breast. Art\nis aroused by it, but not crazily so -- somewhere in telling his story, he's\nfigured out that sex is a foregone conclusion, and now they're just getting\nthrough some nice foreplay. He smiles down at her nipple, which is brown as a\nbar of Belgian chocolate, aureole the size of a round of individual cheese and\nnipple itself a surprisingly chunky square of crinkled flesh. She follows his\neyes and smiles at him, then puts his hand over her breast, covers it with hers.\n\n\"I told you about my mom, right? Wanted to act -- who doesn't? But she was too\nconscious of the cliche to mope about it. She got some little parts -- nothing\nfab, then went on to work at a Sony dealership. Ten years later, she bought a\nfranchise. Dad and second-wife run a retreat in West Hollywood for sexually\ndysfunctional couples. No sibs. Happy childhood. Happy adolescence. Largely\nunsatisfying adulthood, to date.\"\n\n\"Wow, you sound like you've practiced that.\"\n\nShe tweaks his nose, then drapes her arm across his chest. \"Got me. Always\nwriting my autobiography in my head -- gotta have a snappy opener when I'm\ncornered by the stalkerazzi.\"\n\nHe laces his fingers in hers, moves close enough to smell her toothpaste-sweet\nbreath. \"Tell me something unrehearsed about growing up.\"\n\n\"That's a stupid request.\" Her tone is snappish, and her fingers stiffen in his.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"It just is! Don't try to get under my skin, OK? My childhood was fine.\"\n\n\"Look, I don't want to piss you off. I'm just trying to get to know you.\nBecause... you know... I like you. A lot. And I try to get to know the people I\nlike.\"\n\nShe smiles her lopsided dimple. \"Sorry, I just don't like people who try to mess\nwith my head. My problem, not yours. OK, something unrehearsed.\" She closes her\neyes and treats him to the smooth pinkness of her eyelids, and keeps them closed\nas she speaks. \"I once stole a Veddic Series 7 off my mom's lot, when I was\nfifteen. It had all the girly safety features, including a tracker and a panic\nbutton, but I didn't think my mom would miss it. I just wanted to take it out\nfor a drive. It's LA, right? No wheels, no life. So I get as far as Venice\nBeach, and I'm cruising the Boardwalk -- this was just after it went topless, so\nI was swinging in the breeze -- and suddenly the engine dies, right in the\nmiddle of this clump of out-of-towners, frat kids from Kansas or something. Mom\nhad called in a dealer override and Sony shut down the engine by radio.\"\n\n\"Wow, what did you do?\"\n\n\"Well, I put my shirt back on. Then I popped the hood and poked randomly at the\nengine, pulling out the user-servicables and reseating them. The thing was newer\nthan new, right? How could it be broken already? The fratboys all gathered\naround and gave me advice, and I played up all bitchy, you know, 'I've been\nfixing these things since I was ten, get lost,' whatever. They loved it. I was\nall spunky. A couple of them were pretty cute even, and the attention was great.\nI felt safe -- lots of people hanging around, they weren't going to try anything\nfunny. Only I was starting to freak out about the car -- it was really dead. I'd\nreseated everything, self-tested every component, double-checked the fuel.\nNothing nothing nothing! I was going to have to call a tow and my mom was going\nto kill me.\n\n\"So I'm trying not to let it get to me, trying to keep it all cool, but I'm not\ndoing a great job. The frat guys are all standing too close and they smell like\nbeer, and I'm not trying to be perky anymore, just want them to stay! away! but\nthey won't back off. I'm trying not to cry.\n\n\"And then the cops showed up. Not real cops, but Sony's Vehicle Recovery Squad.\nAll dressed up in Vaio gear, stylish as a Pepsi ad, packing lots of semilethals\nand silvery aeorosol shut-up-and-be-still juice, ready to nab the bad, bad perp\nwho boosted this lovely Veddic Series 7 from Mom's lot. Part of the franchise\npackage, that kind of response. It took me a second to figure it out -- Mom\ndidn't know it was *me* who had the car, so she'd called in a theft and bam, I\nwas about to get arrested. The frat rats tried to run away, which is a bad idea,\nyou just don't ever run from cops -- stupid, stupid, stupid. They ended up\nrolling around on the ground, screaming and trying to pull their faces off. It\ntook, like a second. I threw my hands in the air. 'Don't shoot!' They gassed me\nanyway.\n\n\"So then *I* was rolling around on the ground, feeling like my sinuses were\ntrying to explode out of my face. Feeling like my eyeballs were melting. Feeling\nlike my lungs were all shriveled up into raisins. I couldn't scream, I couldn't\neven breathe. By the time I could even roll over and open my eyes, they had me\ncuffed: ankles and wrists in zapstraps that were so tight, they felt like piano\nwire. I was a cool fifteen year old, but not that cool. I started up the\nwaterworks, boohoohoo, couldn't shut it down, couldn't even get angry. I just\nwanted to die. The Sony cops had seen it all before, so they put a tarp down on\nthe Veddic's backseat upholstery, threw me in it, then rolled it into their\nrecovery truck and drove me to the police station.\n\n\"I puked on the tarp twice before they got me there, and almost did it a third\ntime on the way to booking. It got up my sinuses and down my throat, too. I\ncouldn't stop gagging, couldn't stop crying, but by now I was getting pissed.\nI'd been raised on the whole Sony message: 'A Car for the Rest of Us,' gone with\nMom to their Empowerment Seminars, wore the little tee shirts and the temporary\ntats and chatted up the tire-kickers about the Sony Family while Mom was busy.\nThis wasn't the Sony Family I knew.\n\n\"I was tied up on the floor beside the desk sergeant's counter, and a Sony cop\nwas filling in my paperwork, and so I spat out the crud from my mouth, stopped\nsniveling, hawked back my spit and put on my best voice. 'This isn't necessary,\nsir,' I said. 'I'm not a thief. My mother owns the dealership. It was wrong to\ntake the car, but I'm sure she didn't intend for this to happen. Certainly, I\ndon't need to be tied up in here. Please, take off the restraints -- they're\ncutting off my circulation.' The Sony cop flipped up his goofy little facemask\nand squinted at me, then shook his head and went back to his paperwork.\n\n\"'Look,' I said. 'Look! I'm not a criminal. This is a misunderstanding. If you\ncheck my ID and call my mother, we can work this all out. Look!' I read his name\noff his epaulettes. 'Look! Officer Langtree! Just let me up and we'll sort this\nout like adults. Come on, I don't blame you -- I'm glad! -- you were right to\ntake me in. This is my mom's merchandise; it's good that you went after the\nthief and recovered the car. But now you know the truth, it's my mother's car,\nand if you just let me up, I'm sure we can work this out. Please, Officer\nLangtree. My wallet's in my back pocket. Just get it out and check my ID before\nyou do this.'\n\n\"But he just went on filling in the paperwork. 'Why? Why won't you just take a\nsecond to check? Why not?'\n\n\"He turned around again, looked at me for a long time, and I was sure he was\ngoing to check, that it was all going to be fine, but then he said, 'Look, I've\nhad about as much of your bullshit as I'm going to take, little girl. Shut your\nhole or I'll gag you. I just want to get out of here and back to my job, all\nright?'\n\n\"'What?' I said, and it sounded like a shriek to me. 'What did you say to me?\nWhat the hell did you say to me? Didn't you hear what I said? That's my\n*mother's car* -- she owns the lot I took it off of. Do you honestly think she\nwants you to do this? This is the stupidest goddamned thing --'\n\n\"'That's it,' he said, and took a little silver micropore hood off his belt, the\nkind that you cinch up under the chin so the person inside can't talk? I started\nsquirming away then, pleading with him, and I finally caught the desk sergeant's\neye. 'He can't do this! Please! Don't let him do this! I'm in a *police station*\n-- why are you letting him do this?'\n\n\"And the cop smiled and said, 'You're absolutely right, little girl. That's\nenough of that.' The Sony cop didn't pay any attention. He grabbed my head and\nstuffed it into the hood and tried to get the chin strap in place. I shook my\nhead as best as I could, and then the hood was being taken off my head again,\nand the Sony cop looked like he wanted to nail the other cop, but he didn't. The\ndesk sergeant bent down and cut my straps, then helped me to my feet.\n\n\"'You're not going to give me any trouble, are you?' he said, as he led me\naround to a nice, ergo office chair.\n\n\"'No sir!'\n\n\"'You just sit there, then, and I'll be with you in a moment.'\n\n\"I sat down and rubbed my wrists and ankles. My left ankle was oozing blood from\nwhere it had been rubbed raw. I couldn't believe that the Sony Family could\ninflict such indignities on my cute little person. I was so goddamn\nself-righteous, and I know I was smirking as the desk sergeant chewed out the\nSony cop, taking down his badge number and so on so that I'd have it.\n\n\"I thanked the cop profusely, and I kept on thanking him as he booked me and\nprinted me and took my mug shots. I was joking and maybe even flirting a little.\nI was a cute fifteen-year-old and I knew it. After the nastiness with the Sony\ncops, being processed into the criminal justice system seemed mild and\ninoffensive. It didn't really occur to me that I was being *arrested* until my\ngood pal the cop asked me to turn out my pockets before he put me in the cell.\n\n\"'Wait!' I said. 'Sergeant Lorenzi, wait! You don't have to put me in a *cell*,\ndo you, Sergeant Lorenzi? Sergeant Lorenzi! I don't need to go into a cell! Let\nme call my mom, she'll come down and drop the charges, and I can wait here. I'll\nhelp out. I can get coffee. Sergeant Lorenzi!'\n\n\"For a second, it looked like he was going to go through with it. Then he\nrelented and I spent the next couple hours fetching and filing and even running\nout for coffee -- that's how much he trusted me -- while we waited for Mom to\nshow up. I was actually feeling pretty good about it by the time she arrived. Of\ncourse, that didn't last too long.\n\n\"She came through the door like Yosemite Sam, frothing at the chops and howling\nfor my blood. She wanted to press charges, see me locked up to teach me a\nlesson. She didn't care how the Sony cops had gassed and trussed me -- as far as\nshe was concerned, I'd betrayed her and nothing was going to make it right. She\nkept howling for the sergeant to give her the papers to sign, she wanted to\nswear out a complaint, and he just let her run out of steam, his face perfectly\nexpressionless until she was done.\n\n\"'All right then, Mrs. Walchuk, all right. You swear out the complaint, and\nwe'll hold her overnight until her bail hearing. We only got the one holding\ncell, though, you understand. No juvenile facility. Rough crowd. A couple of\nbiowar enthusiasts in there right now, caught 'em trying to thrax a bus\nterminal; a girl who killed her pimp and nailed his privates to the door of his\nhotel room before she took off; a couple of hard old drunks. No telling what\nelse will come in today. We take away their knives and boots and purses, but\nthose girls like to mess up fresh young things, scar them with the bars or their\nnails. We can't watch them all the time.' He was leaning right across the desk\nat my mom, cold and still, and then he nudged my foot with his foot and I knew\nthat he was yanking her chain.\n\n\"'Is that what you want, then, ma'am?'\n\n\"Mom looked like she wanted to tell him yes, go ahead, call his bluff, but he\nwas too good at it. She broke. 'No, it's not,' she said. 'I'll take her home and\ndeal with her there.'\n\n\"'That's fundamentally sound,' he said. 'And Linda, you give me a call if you\nwant to file a complaint against Sony. We have secam footage of the Boardwalk\nand the Station House if you need it, and I have that guy's badge ID, too.'\n\n\"Mom looked alarmed, and I held out my raw, bruisey wrists to her. 'They gassed\nme before they took me in.'\n\n\"'Did you run? You *never* run from the cops, Linda, you should have known\nbetter --'\n\n\"I didn't run. I put my arms in the air and they gassed me and tied me up and\ntook me in.'\n\n\"'That can't be, Linda. You must have done *something* --' Mom always was ready\nto believe that I deserved whatever trouble I got into. She was the only one who\ndidn't care how cute I was.\n\n\"'No mom. I put my hands in the air. I surrendered. They got me anyway. They\ndidn't care. It'll be on the tape. I'll get it from sergeant Lorenzi when I file\nmy complaint.'\n\n\"'You'll do no such thing. You stole a car, you endangered lives, and now you\nwant to go sniveling to the authorities because Sony played a little rough when\nthey brought you in? You committed a *criminal act*, Linda. You got treated like\na criminal.'\n\n\"I wanted to smack her. I knew that this was really about not embarrassing her\nin front of the Sony Family, the nosy chattery ladies with the other franchises\nthat Mom competed against for whuffie and bragging rights. But I'd learned\nsomething about drawing flies with honey that afternoon. The Sergeant could have\nmade things very hard on me, but by giving him a little sugar, I turned it into\nan almost fun afternoon.\n\n\"Mom took me home and screamed herself raw, and I played it all very contrite,\nthen walked over to the minimall so that I could buy some saline solution for my\neyes, which were still as red as stoplights. We never spoke of it again, and on\nmy sixteenth birthday, Mom gave me the keys to a Veddic Series 8, and the first\nthing I did was download new firmware for the antitheft transponder that killed\nit. Two months later, it was stolen. I haven't driven a Sony since.\"\n\nLinda smiles and then purses her lips. \"Unrehearsed enough?\"\n\nArt shakes his head. \"Wow. What a story.\"\n\n\"Do you want to kiss me now?\" Linda says, conversationally.\n\n\"I believe I do,\" Art says, and he does.\n\nLinda pulls the back of his head to hers with one arm, and with the other, she\nhalf-shrugs out of her robe. Art pulls his shirt up to his armpits, feels the\nscorching softness of her chest on his, and groans. His erection grinds into her\nmons through his Jockey shorts, and he groans again as she sucks his tongue into\nher mouth and masticates it just shy of hard enough to hurt.\n\nShe breaks off and reaches down for the waistband of his Jockeys and his whole\nbody arches in anticipation.\n\nThen his comm rings.\n\nAgain.\n\n\"Fuck!\" Art says, just as Linda says, \"Shit!\" and they both snort a laugh. Linda\npulls his hand to her nipple again and Art shivers, sighs, and reaches for his\ncomm, which won't stop ringing.\n\n\"It's me,\" Fede says.\n\n\"Jesus, Fede. What *is it*?\"\n\n\"What is it? Art, you haven't been to the office for more than four hours in a\nweek. It's going on noon, and you still aren't here.\" Fede's voice is hot and\nunreasoning.\n\nArt feels his own temper rise in response. Where the hell did Fede get off,\nanyway? \"So fucking *what*, Fede? I don't actually work for you, you know. I've\nbeen taking care of stuff offsite.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure. Art, if you get in trouble, I'll get in trouble, and you know\n*exactly* what I mean.\"\n\n\"I'm not *in* trouble, Fede. I'm taking the day off -- why don't you call me\ntomorrow?\"\n\n\"What the hell does that mean? You can't just 'take the day off.' I *wrote* the\ngoddamned procedure. You have to fill in the form and get it signed by your\nsupervisor. It needs to be *documented*. Are you *trying* to undermine me?\"\n\n\"You are so goddamned *paranoid*, Federico. I got mugged last night, all right?\nI've been in a police station for the past eighteen hours straight. I am going\nto take a shower and I am going to take a nap and I am going to get a massage,\nand I am *not* going into the office and I am *not* going to fill in any forms.\nThis is not about you.\"\n\nFede pauses for a moment, and Art senses him marshalling his bad temper for\nanother salvo. \"I don't give a shit, Art. If you're not coming into the office,\nyou tell me, you hear? The VP of HR is going berserk, and I know exactly what\nit's about. He is on to us, you hear me? Every day that you're away and I'm\ncovering for your ass, he gets more and more certain. If you keep this shit up,\nwe're both dead.\"\n\n\"Hey, fuck you, Fede.\" Art is surprised to hear the words coming out of his\nmouth, but once they're out, he decides to go with them. \"You can indulge your\nparanoid fantasies to your heart's content, but don't drag me into them. I got\nmugged last night. I had a near-fatal car crash a week ago. If the VP of HR\nwants to find out why I haven't been in the office, he can send me an email and\nI'll tell him exactly what's going on, and if he doesn't like it, he can toss my\ngoddamned salad. But I don't report to you. If you want to have a discussion,\nyou call me and act like a human goddamned being. Tomorrow. Good-bye, Fede.\" Art\nrings the comm off and snarls at it, then switches it off, switches off the\nemergency override, and briefly considers tossing it out the goddamned window\nonto the precious English paving stones below. Instead, he hurls it into the\nsoft cushions of the sofa.\n\nHe turns back to Linda and makes a conscious effort to wipe the snarl off his\nface. He ratchets a smile onto his lips. \"Sorry, sorry. Last time, I swear.\" He\ncrawls over to her on all fours. She's pulled her robe tight around her, and he\nslides a finger under the collar and slides it aside and darts in for a kiss on\nthe hollow of her collarbone. She shies away and drops her cheek to her\nshoulder, shielding the affected area.\n\n\"I'm not --\" she starts. \"The moment's passed, OK? Why don't we just cuddle,\nOK?\"\n\n12.\n\nArt was at his desk at O'Malley House the next day when Fede knocked on his\ndoor. Fede was bearing a small translucent gift-bag made of some cunning\ncombination of rough handmade paper and slick polymer. Art looked up from his\ncomm and waved at the door.\n\nFede came in and put the parcel on Art's desk. Art looked askance at Fede, and\nFede just waved at the bag with a go-ahead gesture. Art felt for the catch that\nwould open the bag without tearing the materials, couldn't find it immediately,\nand reflexively fired up his comm and started to make notes on how a revised\nversion of the bag could provide visual cues showing how to open it. Fede caught\nhim at it and they traded grins.\n\nArt probed the bag's orifice a while longer, then happened upon the release. The\nbag sighed apart, falling in three petals, and revealed its payload: a small,\nleather-worked box with a simple brass catch. Art flipped the catch and eased\nthe box open. Inside, in a fitted foam cavity, was a gray lump of stone.\n\n\"It's an axe-head,\" Fede said. \"It's 200,000 years old.\"\n\nArt lifted it out of the box carefully and turned it about, admiring the clean\ntool marks from its shaping. It had heft and brutal simplicity, and a thin spot\nwhere a handle must have been lashed once upon a time. Art ran his fingertips\nover the smooth tool marks, over the tapered business end, where the stone had\nbeen painstakingly flaked into an edge. It was perfect.\n\nNow that he was holding it, it was so obviously an axe, so clearly an axe. It\nneeded no instruction. It explained itself. I am an axe. Hit things with me. Art\ncouldn't think of a single means by which it could be improved.\n\n\"Fede,\" he said, \"Fede, this is incredible --\"\n\n\"I figured we needed to bury the hatchet, huh?\"\n\n\"God, that's awful. Here's a tip: When you give a gift like this, just leave\nhumor out of it, OK? You don't have the knack.\" Art slapped him on the shoulder\nto show him he was kidding, and reverently returned the axe to its cavity. \"That\nis really one hell of a gift, Fede. Thank you.\"\n\nFede stuck his hand out. Art shook it, and some of the week's tension melted\naway.\n\n\"Now, you're going to buy me lunch,\" Fede said.\n\n\"Deal.\"\n\nThey toddled off to Picadilly and grabbed seats at the counter of a South Indian\nplace for a businessmen's lunch of thali and thick mango lassi, which coated\ntheir tongues in alkaline sweetness that put out the flames from the spiced\nveggies. Both men were sweating by the time they ordered their second round of\nlassi and Art had his hands on his belly, amazed as ever that something as\ninsubstantial as the little platter's complement of veggies and naan could fill\nhim as efficiently as it had.\n\n\"What are you working on now?\" Fede asked, suppressing a curry-whiffing belch.\n\n\"Same shit,\" Art said. \"There are a million ways to make the service work. The\nrights-societies want lots of accounting and lots of pay-per-use. MassPike hates\nthat. It's a pain in the ass to manage, and the clickthrough licenses and\nwarnings they want to slap on are heinous. People are going to crash their cars\nfucking around with the 'I Agree' buttons. Not to mention they want to require a\nfirmware check on every stereo system that gets a song, make sure that this\nweek's copy-protection is installed. So I'm coopering up all these user studies\nwith weasels from the legal departments at the studios, where they just slaver\nall over this stuff, talking about how warm it all makes them feel to make sure\nthat they're compensating artists and how grateful they are for the reminders to\nkeep their software up to date and shit. I'm modeling a system that has a\nclickthrough every time you cue up a new song, too. It's going to be perfect:\nthe rights-societies are going to love it, and I've handpicked the peer review\ngroup at V/DT, stacked it up with total assholes who love manuals and following\nrules. It's going to sail through approval.\"\n\nFede grunted. \"You don't think it'll be too obvious?\"\n\nArt laughed. \"There is no such thing as too obvious in this context, man. These\nguys, they hate the end user, and for years they've been getting away with it\nbecause all their users are already used to being treated like shit at the post\noffice and the tube station. I mean, these people grew up with *coin-operated\nstoves*, for chrissakes! They pay television tax! Feed 'em shit and they'll ask\nyou for second helpings. Beg you for 'em! So no, I don't think it'll be too\nobvious. They'll mock up the whole system and march right into MassPike with it,\ngrinning like idiots. Don't worry about a thing.\"\n\n\"OK, OK. I get it. I won't worry.\"\n\nArt signalled the counterman for their bill. The counterman waved distractedly\nin the manner of a harried restaurateur dealing with his regulars, and said\nsomething in Korean to the busgirl, who along with the Vietnamese chef and the\nCongolese sous chef, lent the joint a transworld sensibility that made it a\nfavorite among the painfully global darlings of O'Malley House. The bus-girl\nfound a pad and started totting up numbers, then keyed them into a Point-of-Sale\nterminal, which juiced Art's comm with an accounting for their lunch. This\nbusiness with hand-noting everything before entering it into the PoS had driven\nArt to distraction when he'd first encountered it. He'd assumed that the\nterminal's UI was such that a computer-illiterate busgirl couldn't reliably key\nin the data without having it in front of her, and for months he'd cited it in\nnet-bullshit sessions as more evidence of the pervasive user-hostility that\ncharacterized the whole damned GMT.\n\nHe'd finally tried out his rant on the counterman, one foreigner to another,\njust a little Briton-bashing session between two refugees from the Colonial\nJackboot. To his everlasting surprise, the counterman had vigorously defended\nthe system, saying that he liked the PoS data-entry system just fine, but that\nthe stack of torn-off paper stubs from the busgirl's receipt book was a good\nvisualization tool, letting him eyeball the customer volume from hour to hour by\nchecking the spike beside the till, and the rubberbanded stacks of yellowing\npaper lining his cellar's shelves gave him a wonderfully physical evidence of\nthe growing success of his little eatery. There was a lesson there, Art knew,\nthough he'd yet to codify it. User mythology was tricky that way.\n\nEvery time Art scribbled a tip into his comm and squirted it back at the PoS, he\nconsidered this little puzzle, eyes unfocusing for a moment while his vision\nturned inwards. As his eyes snapped back into focus, he noticed the young lad\nsitting on the long leg of the ell formed by the counter. He had bully short\nhair and broad shoulders, and a sneer that didn't quite disappear as he shoveled\nup the dhal with his biodegradable bamboo disposable spork.\n\nHe knew that guy from somewhere. The guy caught him staring and they locked eyes\nfor a moment, and in that instant Art knew who the guy was. It was Tom, whom he\nhad last seen stabbing at him with a tazer clutched in one shaking fist, face\ntwisted in fury. Tom wasn't wearing his killsport armor, just nondescript\nathletic wear, and he wasn't with Lester and Tony, but it was him. Art watched\nTom cock his head to jog his memory, and then saw Tom recognize him. Uh-oh.\n\n\"We have to go. Now,\" he said to Fede, standing and walking away quickly, hand\ngoing to his comm. He stopped short of dialing 999, though -- he wasn't up for\nanother police-station all-nighter. He got halfway up Picadilly before looking\nover his shoulder, and he saw Fede shouldering his way through the lunchtime\ncrowd, looking pissed. A few paces behind him came Tom, face contorted in a\nsadistic snarl.\n\nArt did a little two-step of indecision, moving towards Fede, then away from\nhim. He met Tom's eyes again, and Tom's ferocious, bared teeth spurred him on.\nHe turned abruptly into the tube station, waved his comm at a turnstile and dove\ninto the thick of the crowd heading down the stairs to the Elephant and Castle\nplatform. His comm rang.\n\n\"What is *wrong* with you, man?\" Fede said.\n\n\"One of the guys who mugged me,\" he hissed. \"He was sitting right across from\nus. He's a couple steps behind you. I'm in the tube station. I'll ride a stop\nand catch a cab back to the office.\"\n\n\"He's behind me? Where?\"\n\nArt's comm lit up with a grainy feed from Fede's comm. It jiggled as Fede\nhustled through the crowd.\n\n\"Jesus, Fede, stop! Don't go to the goddamned tube station -- he'll follow you\nhere.\"\n\n\"Where do you want me to go? I got to go back to the office.\"\n\n\"Don't go there either. Get a cab and circle the block a couple times. Don't\nlead him back.\"\n\n\"This is stupid. Why don't I just call the cops?\"\n\n\"Don't bother. They won't do shit. I've been through this already. I just want\nto lose that guy and not have him find me again later.\"\n\n\"Christ.\"\n\nArt squeaked as Tom filled his screen, then passed by, swinging his head from\nside to side with saurian rage.\n\n\"What?\" Fede said.\n\n\"That was him. He just walked past you. He must not know you're with me. Go back\nto the office, I'll meet you there.\"\n\n\"That dipshit? Art, he's all of five feet tall!\"\n\n\"He's a fucking psycho, Fede. Don't screw around with him or he'll give you a\nTesla enema.\"\n\nFede winced. \"I hate tazers.\"\n\n\"The train is pulling in. I'll talk to you later.\"\n\n\"OK, OK.\"\n\nArt formed up in queue with the rest of the passengers and shuffled through the\ngas chromatograph, tensing up a little as it sniffed his personal space for\nblack powder residue. Once on board, he tore a sani-wipe from the roll in the\nceiling, ignoring the V/DT ad on it, and grabbed the stainless steel rail with\nit, stamping on the drifts of sani-wipe mulch on the train's floor.\n\nHe made a conscious effort to control his breathing, willed his heart to stop\npounding. He was still juiced with adrenaline, and his mind raced. He needed to\ndo something constructive with his time, but his mind kept wandering. Finally,\nhe gave in and let it wander.\n\nSomething about the counterman, about his slips of paper, about the MassPike. It\nwas knocking around in his brain and he just couldn't figure out how to bring it\nto the fore. The counterman kept his slips in the basement so that he could sit\namong them and see how his business had grown, every slip a person served, a\nring on the till, money in the bank. Drivers on the MassPike who used traffic\njams to download music from nearby cars and then paid to license the songs. Only\nthey didn't. They circumvented the payment system in droves, running bootleg\noperations out of their cars that put poor old Napster to shame for sheer\nvolume. Some people drove in promiscuous mode, collecting every song in every\ncar on the turnpike, cruising the tunnels that riddled Boston like mobile pirate\nradio stations, dumping their collections to other drivers when it came time to\nquit the turnpike and settle up for their music at the toll booth.\n\nIt was these war-drivers that MassPike was really worried about. Admittedly,\nthey actually made the system go. Your average fartmobile driver had all of ten\nsongs in his queue, and the short-range, broadband connection you had on\nMassPike meant that if you were stuck in a jam of these cars, your selection\nwould be severely limited. The war-drivers, though, were mobile jukeboxes. The\nhighway patrol had actually seized cars with over 300,000 tracks on their\ndrives. Without these fat caches on the highway, MassPike would have to spend a\nfortune on essentially replicating the system with their own mobile libraries.\n\nThe war-drivers were the collective memory of the MassPike's music-listeners.\n\nOoh, there was a tasty idea. The collective memory of MassPike. Like Dark Ages\nscholars, memorizing entire texts to preserve them against the depredations of\nbarbarism, passing their collections carefully from car to car. He'd\ninvestigated the highway patrol reports on these guys, and there were hints\nthere, shadowy clues of an organized subculture, one with a hierarchy, where\nnewbies tricked out their storage with libraries of novel and rare tuneage in a\nbid to convince the established elite that they were worthy of joining the\ncollective memory.\n\nThinking of war-drivers as a collective memory was like staring at an optical\nillusion and seeing the vase emerge from the two faces. Art's entire perception\nof the problem involuted itself in his mind. He heard panting and realized it\nwas him; he was hyperventilating.\n\nIf these guys were the collective memory of the MassPike, that meant that they\nwere performing a service, reducing MassPike's costs significantly. That meant\nthat they were tastemakers, injecting fresh music into the static world of\nBoston drivers. Mmmm. Trace that. Find out how influential they were. Someone\nwould know -- the MassPike had stats on how songs migrated from car to car. Even\nwithout investigating it, Art just *knew* that these guys were offsetting\nmillions of dollars in marketing.\n\nSo. So. So. So, *feed* that culture. War-drivers needed to be devoted to make it\ninto the subculture. They had to spend four or five hours a day cruising the\nfreeways to accumulate and propagate their collections. They couldn't *leave*\nthe MassPike until they found someone to hand their collections off to.\n\nWhat if MassPike *rewarded* these guys? What if MassPike charged *nothing* for\npeople with more than, say 50,000 tunes in their cache? Art whipped out his comm\nand his keyboard and started making notes, snatching at the silver rail with his\nkeyboard hand every time the train jerked and threatened to topple him. That's\nhow the tube cops found him, once the train reached Elephant and Castle and they\ndid their rounds, politely but firmly rousting him.\n\n13.\n\nI am already in as much trouble as I can be, I think. I have left my room, hit\nand detonated some poor cafeteria hash-slinger's fartmobile, and certainly\ndamned some hapless secret smoker to employee Hades for his security lapses.\nWhen I get down from here, I will be bound up in a chemical straightjacket. I'll\nbe one of the ward-corner droolers, propped up in a wheelchair in front of the\nvideo, tended twice daily for diaper changes, feeding and re-medication.\n\nThat is the worst they can do, and I'm in for it. This leaves me asking two\nquestions:\n\n1. Why am I so damned eager to be rescued from my rooftop aerie? I am sunburned\nand sad, but I am more free than I have been in weeks.\n\n2. Why am I so reluctant to take further action in the service of getting\nsomeone up onto the roof? I could topple a ventilator chimney by moving the\ncinderblocks that hold its apron down and giving it the shoulder. I could dump\nrattling handfuls of gravel down its maw and wake the psychotics below.\n\nI could, but I won't. Maybe I don't want to go back just yet.\n\nThey cooked it up between them. The Jersey customers, Fede, and Linda. I should\nhave known better.\n\nWhen I landed at Logan, I was full of beans, ready to design and implement my\nwar-driving scheme for the Jersey customers and advance the glorious cause of\nthe Eastern Standard Tribe. I gleefully hopped up and down the coast, chilling\nin Manhattan for a day or two, hanging out with Gran in Toronto.\n\nThat Linda followed me out made it all even better. We rented cars and drove\nthem from city to city, dropping them off at the city limits and switching to\ntop-grade EST public transit, eating top-grade EST pizza, heads turning to\nfollow the impeccably dressed, buff couples that strolled the\npedestrian-friendly streets arm in arm. We sat on stoops in Brooklyn with old\nladies who talked softly in the gloaming of the pollution-tinged sunsets while\ntheir grandchildren chased each other down the street. We joined a pickup game\nof street-hockey in Boston, yelling \"Car!\" and clearing the net every time a\nfartmobile turned into the cul-de-sac.\n\nWe played like kids. I got commed during working hours and my evenings were\nblissfully devoid of buzzes, beeps and alerts. It surprised the hell out of me\nwhen I discovered Fede's treachery and Linda's complicity and found myself\nflying cattle class to London to kick Fede's ass. What an idiot I am.\n\nI have never won an argument with Fede. I thought I had that time, of course,\nbut I should have known better. I was hardly back in Boston for a day before the\nmen with the white coats came to take me away.\n\nThey showed up at the Novotel, soothing and grim, and opened my room's keycard\nreader with a mental-hygiene override. There were four of them, wiry and fast\nwith the no-nonsense manner of men who have been unexpectedly hammered by\noutwardly calm psychopaths. That I was harmlessly having a rare cigarette on the\nbalcony, dripping from the shower, made no impression on them. They dropped\ntheir faceplates, moved quickly to the balcony and boxed me in.\n\nOne of them recited a Miranda-esque litany that ended with \"Do you understand.\"\nIt wasn't really a question, but I answered anyway. \"No! No I don't! Who the\nhell are you, and what are you doing in my fucking hotel room?\"\n\nIn my heart, though, I knew. I'd lived enough of my life on the hallucinatory\nedge of sleepdep to have anticipated this moment during a thousand freakouts. I\nwas being led away to the sanatorium, because someone, somewhere, had figured\nout about the scurrying hamsters in my brain. About time.\n\nAs soon as I said the f-word, the guns came out. I tried to relax. I knew\nintuitively that this could either be a routine and impersonal affair, or a\nscreaming, kicking, biting nightmare. I knew that arriving at the intake in a\ncalm frame of mind would make the difference between a chemical straightjacket\nand a sleeping pill.\n\nThe guns were nonlethals, and varied: two kinds of nasty aerosol, a dart-gun,\nand a tazer. The tazer captured my attention, whipping horizontal lightning in\nthe spring breeze. The Tesla enema, they called it in London. Supposedly\nclub-kids used them recreationally, but everyone I knew who'd been hit with one\ndescribed the experience as fundamentally and uniquely horrible.\n\nI slowly raised my hands. \"I would like to pack a bag, and I would like to see\ndocumentary evidence of your authority. May I?\" I kept my voice as calm as I\ncould, but it cracked on \"May I?\"\n\nThe reader of the litany nodded slowly. \"You tell us what you want packed and\nwe'll pack it. Once that's done, I'll show you the committal document, all\nright?\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\n\nThey drove me through the Route 128 traffic in the sealed and padded compartment\nin the back of their van. I was strapped in at the waist, and strapped over my\nshoulders with a padded harness that reminded me of a rollercoaster restraint.\nWe made slow progress, jerking and changing lanes at regular intervals. The\ntraffic signature of 128 was unmistakable.\n\nThe intake doctor wanded me for contraband, drew fluids from my various parts,\nand made light chitchat with me along the way. It was the last time I saw him.\nBefore I knew it, a beefy orderly had me by the arm and was leading me to my\nroom. He had a thick Eastern European accent, and he ran down the house rules\nfor me in battered English. I tried to devote my attention to it, to forget the\nslack-eyed ward denizens I'd passed on my way in. I succeeded enough to\nunderstand the relationship of my legcuff, the door frame and the elevators. The\norderly fished in his smock and produced a hypo.\n\n\"For sleepink,\" he said.\n\nPanic, suppressed since my arrival, welled up and burst over. \"Wait!\" I said.\n\"What about my things? I had a bag with me.\"\n\n\"Talk to doctor in morning,\" he said, gesturing with the hypo, fitting it with a\nneedle-and-dosage cartridge and popping the sterile wrap off with a thumbswitch.\n\"Now, for sleepink.\" He advanced on me.\n\nI'd been telling myself that this was a chance to rest, to relax and gather my\nwits. Soon enough, I'd sort things out with the doctors and I'd be on my way.\nI'd argue my way out of it. But here came Boris Badinoff with his magic needle,\nand all reason fled. I scrambled back over the bed and pressed against the\nwindow.\n\n\"It's barely three,\" I said, guessing at the time in the absence of my comm.\n\"I'm not tired. I'll go to sleep when I am.\"\n\n\"For sleepink,\" he repeated, in a more soothing tone.\n\n\"No, that's all right. I'm tired enough. Long night last night. I'll just lie\ndown and nap now, all right? No need for needles, OK?\"\n\nHe grabbed my wrist. I tried to tug it out of his grasp, to squirm away. There's\na lot of good, old-fashioned dirty fighting in Tai Chi -- eye-gouging, groin\npunches, hold-breaks and come-alongs -- and they all fled me. I thrashed like a\nfish on a line as he ran the hypo over the crook of my elbow until the\nvein-sensing LED glowed white. He jabbed down with it and I felt a prick. For a\nsecond, I thought that it hadn't taken effect -- I've done enough chemical sleep\nin my years with the Tribe that I've developed quite a tolerance for most\nvarieties -- but then I felt that unmistakable heaviness in my eyelids, the\nmelatonin crash that signalled the onslaught of merciless rest. I collapsed into\nbed.\n\nI spent the next day in a drugged stupor. I've become quite accustomed to\nfunctioning in a stupor over the years, but this was different. No caffeine, for\nstarters. They fed me and I had a meeting with a nice doctor who ran it down for\nme. I was here for observation pending a competency hearing in a week. I had\nseven days to prove that I wasn't a danger to myself or others, and if I could,\nthe judge would let me go.\n\n\"It's like I'm a drug addict, huh?\" I said to the doctor, who was used to non\nsequiturs.\n\n\"Sure, sure it is.\" He shifted in the hard chair opposite my bed, getting ready\nto go.\n\n\"No, really, I'm not just running my mouth. It's like this: *I* don't think I\nhave a problem here. I think that my way of conducting my life is perfectly\nharmless. Like a speedfreak who thinks that she's just having a great time,\nbeing ultraproductive and coming out ahead of the game. But her friends, they're\nconvinced she's destroying herself -- they see the danger she's putting herself\nin, they see her health deteriorating. So they put her into rehab, kicking and\nscreaming, where she stays until she figures it out.\n\n\"So, it's like I'm addicted to being nuts. I have a nonrational view of the\nworld around me. An *inaccurate* view. You are meant to be the objective\nobserver, to make such notes as are necessary to determine if I'm seeing things\nproperly, or through a haze of nutziness. For as long as I go on taking my drug\n-- shooting up my craziness -- you keep me here. Once I stop, once I accept the\nobjective truth of reality, you let me go. What then? Do I become a recovering\nnutcase? Do I have to stand ever-vigilant against the siren song of craziness?\"\n\nThe doctor ran his hands through his long hair and bounced his knee up and down.\n\"You could put it that way, I guess.\"\n\n\"So tell me, what's the next step? What is my optimum strategy for providing\ncompelling evidence of my repudiation of my worldview?\"\n\n\"Well, that's where the analogy breaks down. This isn't about anything\ndemonstrable. There's no one thing we look for in making our diagnosis. It's a\ncollection of things, a protocol for evaluating you. It doesn't happen\novernight, either. You were committed on the basis of evidence that you had made\nthreats to your coworkers due to a belief that they were seeking to harm you.\"\n\n\"Interesting. Can we try a little thought experiment, Doctor? Say that your\ncoworkers really *were* seeking to harm you -- this is not without historical\nprecedent, right? They're seeking to sabotage you because you've discovered some\nterrible treachery on their part, and they want to hush you up. So they provoke\na reaction from you and use it as the basis for an involuntary committal. How\nwould you, as a medical professional, distinguish that scenario from one in\nwhich the patient is genuinely paranoid and delusional?\"\n\nThe doctor looked away. \"It's in the protocol -- we find it there.\"\n\n\"I see,\" I said, moving in for the kill. \"I see. Where would I get more\ninformation on the protocol? I'd like to research it before my hearing.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" the doctor said, \"we don't provide access to medical texts to our\npatients.\"\n\n\"Why not? How can I defend myself against a charge if I'm not made aware of the\nmeans by which my defense is judged? That hardly seems fair.\"\n\nThe doctor stood and smoothed his coat, turned his badge's lanyard so that his\npicture faced outwards. \"Art, you're not here to defend yourself. You're here so\nthat we can take a look at you and understand what's going on. If you have been\nset up, we'll discover it --\"\n\n\"What's the ratio of real paranoids to people who've been set up, in your\nexperience?\"\n\n\"I don't keep stats on that sort of thing --\"\n\n\"How many paranoids have been released because they were vindicated?\"\n\n\"I'd have to go through my case histories --\"\n\n\"Is it more than ten?\"\n\n\"No, I wouldn't think so --\"\n\n\"More than five?\"\n\n\"Art, I don't think --\"\n\n\"Have *any* paranoids ever been vindicated? Is this observation period anything\nmore than a formality en route to committal? Come on, Doctor, just let me know\nwhere I stand.\"\n\n\"Art, we're on your side here. If you want to make this easy on yourself, then\nyou should understand that. The nurse will be in with your lunch and your meds\nin a few minutes, then you'll be allowed out on the ward. I'll speak to you\nthere more, if you want.\"\n\n\"Doctor, it's a simple question: Has anyone ever been admitted to this facility\nbecause it was believed he had paranoid delusions, and later released because he\nwas indeed the center of a plot?\"\n\n\"Art, it's not appropriate for me to discuss other patients' histories --\"\n\n\"Don't you publish case studies? Don't those contain confidential information\ndisguised with pseudonyms?\"\n\n\"That's not the point --\"\n\n\"What *is* the point? It seems to me that my optimal strategy here is to\nrepudiate my belief that Fede and Linda are plotting against me -- *even* if I\nstill believe this to be true, even if it *is* true -- and profess a belief that\nthey are my good and concerned friends. In other words, if they are indeed\nplotting against me, I must profess to a delusional belief that they aren't, in\norder to prove that I am not delusional.\"\n\n\"I read *Catch-22* too, Art. That's not what this is about, but your attitude\nisn't going to help you any here.\" The doctor scribbled on his comm briefly,\ntapped at some menus. I leaned across and stared at the screen.\n\n\"That looks like a prescription, Doctor.\"\n\n\"It is. I'm giving you a mild sedative. We can't help you until you're calmer\nand ready to listen.\"\n\n\"I'm perfectly calm. I just disagree with you. I am the sort of person who\nlearns through debate. Medication won't stop that.\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" the doctor said, and left, before I could muster a riposte.\n\nI was finally allowed onto the ward, dressed in what the nurses called \"day\nclothes\" -- the civilian duds that I'd packed before leaving the hotel, which an\norderly retrieved for me from a locked closet in my room. The clustered nuts\nwere watching slackjaw TV, or staring out the windows, or rocking in place,\nfidgeting and muttering. I found myself a seat next to a birdy woman whose long\noily hair was parted down the middle, leaving a furrow in her scalp lined with\ntwin rows of dandruff. She was young, maybe twenty-five, and seemed the least\nstuporous of the lot.\n\n\"Hello,\" I said to her.\n\nShe smiled shyly, then pitched forward and vomited copiously and noisily between\nher knees. I shrank back and struggled to keep my face neutral. A nurse hastened\nto her side and dropped a plastic bucket in the stream of puke, which was still\ngushing out of her mouth, her thin chest heaving.\n\n\"Here, Sarah, in here,\" the nurse said, with an air of irritation.\n\n\"Can I help?\" I said, ridiculously.\n\nShe looked sharply at me. \"Art, isn't it? Why aren't you in Group? It's after\none!\"\n\n\"Group?\" I asked.\n\n\"Group. In that corner, there.\" She gestured at a collection of sagging sofas\nunderneath one of the ward's grilled-in windows. \"You're late, and they've\nstarted without you.\"\n\nThere were four other people there, two women and a young boy, and a doctor in\nmufti, identifiable by his shoes -- not slippers -- and his staff of office, the\nalmighty badge-on-a-lanyard.\n\nThrobbing with dread, I moved away from the still-heaving girl to the sofa\ncluster and stood at its edge. The group turned to look at me. The doctor\ncleared his throat. \"Group, this is Art. Glad you made it, Art. You're a little\nlate, but we're just getting started here, so that's OK. This is Lucy, Fatima,\nand Manuel. Why don't you have a seat?\" His voice was professionally smooth and\nstultifying.\n\nI sank into a bright orange sofa that exhaled a cloud of dust motes that danced\nin the sun streaming through the windows. It also exhaled a breath of trapped\nancient farts, barf-smell, and antiseptic, the *parfum de asylum* that gradually\nnumbed my nose to all other scents on the ward. I folded my hands in my lap and\ntried to look attentive.\n\n\"All right, Art. Everyone in the group is pretty new here, so you don't have to\nworry about not knowing what's what. There are no right or wrong things. The\nonly rules are that you can't interrupt anyone, and if you want to criticize,\nyou have to criticize the idea, and not the person who said it. All right?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I said. \"Sure. Let's get started.\"\n\n\"Well, aren't you eager?\" the doctor said warmly. \"OK. Manuel was just telling\nus about his friends.\"\n\n\"They're not my friends,\" Manuel said angrily. \"They're the reason I'm here. I\nhate them.\"\n\n\"Go on,\" the doctor said.\n\n\"I already *told* you, yesterday! Tony and Musafir, they're trying to get rid of\nme. I make them look bad, so they want to get rid of me.\"\n\n\"Why do you think you make them look bad?\"\n\n\"Because I'm better than them -- I'm smarter, I dress better, I get better\ngrades, I score more goals. The girls like me better. They hate me for it.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, you're the cat's ass, pookie,\" Lucy said. She was about fifteen,\nvoluminously fat, and her full lips twisted in an elaborate sneer as she spoke.\n\n\"Lucy,\" the doctor said patiently, favoring her with a patronizing smile.\n\"That's not cool, OK? Criticize the idea, not the person, and only when it's\nyour turn, OK?\"\n\nLucy rolled her eyes with the eloquence of teenagedom.\n\n\"All right, Manuel, thank you. Group, do you have any positive suggestions for\nManuel?\"\n\nStony silence.\n\n\"OK! Manuel, some of us are good at some things, and some of us are good at\nothers. Your friends don't hate you, and I'm sure that if you think about it,\nyou'll know that you don't hate them. Didn't they come visit you last weekend?\nSuccessful people are well liked, and you're no exception. We'll come back to\nthis tomorrow -- why don't you spend the time until then thinking of three\nexamples of how your friends showed you that they liked you, and you can tell us\nabout it tomorrow?\"\n\nManuel stared out the window.\n\n\"OK! Now, Art, welcome again. Tell us why you're here.\"\n\n\"I'm in for observation. There's a competency hearing at the end of the week.\"\n\nLinda snorted and Fatima giggled.\n\nThe doctor ignored them. \"But tell us *why* you think you ended up here.\"\n\n\"You want the whole story?\"\n\n\"Whatever parts you think are important.\"\n\n\"It's a Tribal thing.\"\n\n\"I see,\" the doctor said.\n\n\"It's like this,\" I said. \"It used to be that the way you chose your friends was\nby finding the most like-minded people you could out of the pool of people who\nlived near to you. If you were lucky, you lived near a bunch of people you could\nget along with. This was a lot more likely in the olden days, back before, you\nknow, printing and radio and such. Chances were that you'd grow up so immersed\nin the local doctrine that you'd never even think to question it. If you were a\ngenius or a psycho, you might come up with a whole new way of thinking, and if\nyou could pull it off, you'd either gather up a bunch of people who liked your\nnew idea or you'd go somewhere else, like America, where you could set up a\nlittle colony of people who agreed with you. Most of the time, though, people\nwho didn't get along with their neighbors just moped around until they died.\"\n\n\"Very interesting,\" the doctor said, interrupting smoothly, \"but you were going\nto tell us how you ended up here.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lucy said, \"this isn't a history lesson, it's Group. Get to the point.\"\n\n\"I'm getting there,\" I said. \"It just takes some background if you're going to\nunderstand it. Now, once ideas could travel more freely, the chances of you\nfinding out about a group of people somewhere else that you might get along with\nincreased. Like when my dad was growing up, if you were gay and from a big city,\nchances were that you could figure out where other gay people hung out and go\nand --\" I waved my hands, \"be *gay*, right? But if you were from a small town,\nyou might not even know that there was such a thing as being gay -- you might\nthink it was just a perversion. But as time went by, the gay people in the big\ncities started making a bigger and bigger deal out of being gay, and since all\nthe information that the small towns consumed came from big cities, that\ninformation leaked into the small towns and more gay people moved to the big\ncities, built little gay zones where gay was normal.\n\n\"So back when the New World was forming and sorting out its borders and\nterritories, information was flowing pretty well. You had telegraphs, you had\nthe Pony Express, you had thousands of little newspapers that got carried around\non railroads and streetcars and steamers, and it wasn't long before everyone\nknew what kind of person went where, even back in Europe and Asia. People\nimmigrated here and picked where they wanted to live based on what sort of\npeople they wanted to be with, which ideas they liked best. A lot of it was\nreligious, but that was just on the surface -- underneath it all was aesthetics.\nYou wanted to go somewhere where the girls were pretty in the way you understood\nprettiness, where the food smelled like food and not garbage, where shops sold\ngoods you could recognize. Lots of other factors were at play, too, of course --\njobs and Jim Crow laws and whatnot, but the tug of finding people like you is\nlike gravity. Lots of things work against gravity, but gravity always wins in\nthe end -- in the end, everything collapses. In the end, everyone ends up with\nthe people that are most like them that they can find.\"\n\nI was warming to my subject now, in that flow state that great athletes get into\nwhen they just know where to swing their bat, where to plant their foot. I knew\nthat I was working up a great rant.\n\n\"Fast-forward to the age of email. Slowly but surely, we begin to mediate almost\nall of our communication over networks. Why walk down the hallway to ask a\ncoworker a question, when you can just send email? You don't need to interrupt\nthem, and you can keep going on your own projects, and if you forget the answer,\nyou can just open the message again and look at the response. There're all kinds\nof ways to interact with our friends over the network: we can play\nhallucinogenic games, chat, send pictures, code, music, funny articles, metric\nfuckloads of porn... The interaction is high-quality! Sure, you gain three\npounds every year you spend behind the desk instead of walking down the hall to\nask your buddy where he wants to go for lunch, but that's a small price to pay.\n\n\"So you're a fish out of water. You live in Arizona, but you're sixteen years\nold and all your neighbors are eighty-five, and you get ten billion channels of\nmedia on your desktop. All the good stuff -- everything that tickles you --\ncomes out of some clique of hyperurban club-kids in South Philly. They're making\ncool art, music, clothes. You read their mailing lists and you can tell that\nthey're exactly the kind of people who'd really appreciate you for who you are.\nIn the old days, you'd pack your bags and hitchhike across the country and move\nto your community. But you're sixteen, and that's a pretty scary step.\n\n\"Why move? These kids live online. At lunch, before school, and all night,\nthey're comming in, talking trash, sending around photos, chatting. Online, you\ncan be a peer. You can hop into these discussions, play the games, chord with\none hand while chatting up some hottie a couple thousand miles away.\n\n\"Only you can't. You can't, because they chat at seven AM while they're getting\nready for school. They chat at five PM, while they're working on their homework.\nTheir late nights end at three AM. But those are their *local* times, not yours.\nIf you get up at seven, they're already at school, 'cause it's ten there.\n\n\"So you start to f with your sleep schedule. You get up at four AM so you can\nchat with your friends. You go to bed at nine, 'cause that's when they go to\nbed. Used to be that it was stock brokers and journos and factory workers who\ndid that kind of thing, but now it's anyone who doesn't fit in. The geniuses and\nlunatics to whom the local doctrine tastes wrong. They choose their peers based\non similarity, not geography, and they keep themselves awake at the same time as\nthem. But you need to make some nod to localness, too -- gotta be at work with\neveryone else, gotta get to the bank when it's open, gotta buy your groceries.\nYou end up hardly sleeping at all, you end up sneaking naps in the middle of the\nday, or after dinner, trying to reconcile biological imperatives with cultural\nones. Needless to say, that alienates you even further from the folks at home,\nand drives you more and more into the arms of your online peers of choice.\n\n\"So you get the Tribes. People all over the world who are really secret agents\nfor some other time zone, some other way of looking at the world, some other\nzeitgeist. Unlike other tribes, you can change allegiance by doing nothing more\nthat resetting your alarm clock. Like any tribe, they are primarily loyal to\neach other, and anyone outside of the tribe is only mostly human. That may sound\nextreme, but this is what it comes down to.\n\n\"Tribes are *agendas*. Aesthetics. Ethos. Traditions. Ways of getting things\ndone. They're competitive. They may not all be based on time-zones. There are\nknitting Tribes and vampire fan-fiction Tribes and Christian rock tribes, but\nthey've always existed. Mostly, these tribes are little more than a sub-culture.\nIt takes time-zones to amplify the cultural fissioning of fan-fiction or\nknitting into a full-blown conspiracy. Their interests are commercial,\nindustrial, cultural, culinary. A Tribesman will patronize a fellow Tribesman's\nrestaurant, or give him a manufacturing contract, or hire his taxi. Not because\nof xenophobia, but because of homophilia: I know that my Tribesman's taxi will\nconduct its way through traffic in a way that I'm comfortable with, whether I'm\nin San Francisco, Boston, London or Calcutta. I know that the food will be\npalatable in a Tribal restaurant, that a book by a Tribalist will be a good\nread, that a gross of widgets will be manufactured to the exacting standards of\nmy Tribe.\n\n\"Like I said, though, unless you're at ground zero, in the Tribe's native time\nzone, your sleep sched is just *raped*. You live on sleepdep and chat and secret\nagentry until it's second nature. You're cranky and subrational most of the\ntime. Close your eyes on the freeway and dreams paint themselves on the back of\nyour lids, demanding their time, almost as heavy as gravity, almost as\nremorseless. There's a lot of flaming and splitting and vitriol in the Tribes.\nThey're more fractured than a potsherd. Tribal anthropologists have built up\nincredible histories of the fissioning of the Tribes since they were first\nrecognized -- most of 'em are online; you can look 'em up. We stab each other in\nthe back routinely and with no more provocation than a sleepdep hallucination.\n\n\"Which is how I got here. I'm a member of the Eastern Standard Tribe. We're\ncentered around New York, but we're ramified up and down the coast, Boston and\nToronto and Philly, a bunch of Montreal Anglos and some wannabes in upstate New\nYork, around Buffalo and Schenectady. I was doing Tribal work in London, serving\nthe Eastern Standard Agenda, working with a couple of Tribesmen, well, one\nTribesman and my girlfriend, who I thought was unaffiliated. Turns out, though,\nthat they're both double agents. They sold out to the Pacific Daylight Tribe,\nlameass phonies out in LA, slick Silicon Valley bizdev sharks, pseudo hipsters\nin San Franscarcity. Once I threatened to expose them, they set me up, had me\nthrown in here.\"\n\nI looked around proudly, having just completed a real fun little excursion\nthrough a topic near and dear to my heart. Mount Rushmore looked back at me,\nstony and bovine and uncomprehending.\n\n\"Baby,\" Lucy said, rolling her eyes again, \"you need some new meds.\"\n\n\"Could be,\" I said. \"But this is for real. Is there a comm on the ward? We can\nlook it up together.\"\n\n\"Oh, *that*'all prove it, all right. Nothing but truth online.\"\n\n\"I didn't say that. There're peer-reviewed articles about the Tribes. It was a\nlead story on the CBC's social science site last year.\"\n\n\"Uh huh, sure. Right next to the sasquatch videos.\"\n\n\"I'm talking about the CBC, Lucy. Let's go look it up.\"\n\nLucy mimed taking an invisible comm out of her cleavage and prodding at it with\nan invisible stylus. She settled an invisible pair of spectacles on her nose and\nnodded sagely. \"Oh yeah, sure, really interesting stuff.\"\n\nI realized that I was arguing with a crazy person and turned to the doctor. \"You\nmust have read about the Tribes, right?\"\n\nThe doctor acted as if he hadn't heard me. \"That's just fascinating, Art. Thank\nyou for sharing that. Now, here's a question I'd like you to think about, and\nmaybe you can tell us the answer tomorrow: What are the ways that your friends\n-- the ones you say betrayed you -- used to show you how much they respected you\nand liked you? Think hard about this. I think you'll be surprised by the\nconclusions you come to.\"\n\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"Just what I said, Art. Think hard about how you and your friends interacted and\nyou'll see that they really like you.\"\n\n\"Did you hear what I just said? Have you heard of the Tribes?\"\n\n\"Sure, sure. But this isn't about the Tribes, Art. This is about you and --\" he\nconsulted his comm, \"Fede and Linda. They care about you a great deal and\nthey're terribly worried about you. You just think about it. Now,\" he said,\nrecrossing his legs, \"Fatima, you told us yesterday about your mother and I\nasked you to think about how *she* feels. Can you tell the group what you found\nout?\"\n\nBut Fatima was off in med-land, eyes glazed and mouth hanging slack. Manuel\nnudged her with his toe, then, when she failed to stir, aimed a kick at her\nshin. The doctor held a hand out and grabbed Manuel's slippered toe. \"That's all\nright, let's move on to Lucy.\"\n\nI tuned out as Lucy began an elaborate and well-worn rant about her eating\nhabits, prodded on by the doctor. The enormity of the situation was coming home\nto me. I couldn't win. If I averred that Fede and Linda were my boon companions,\nI'd still be found incompetent -- after all, what competent person threatens his\nboon companions? If I stuck to my story, I'd be found incompetent, and medicated\nbesides, like poor little Fatima, zombified by the psychoactive cocktail. Either\nway, I was stuck.\n\nStuck on the roof now, and it's getting very uncomfortable indeed. Stuck because\nI am officially incompetent and doomed and damned to indefinite rest on the\nward. Stuck because every passing moment here is additional time for the\nhamsters to run their courses in my mind, piling regret on worry.\n\nStuck because as soon as I am discovered, I will be stupified by the meds,\nadministered by stern and loving and thoroughly disappointed doctors. I still\nhaven't managed to remember any of their names. They are interchangeable, well\nshod and endowed with badges on lanyards and soothing and implacable and\nentirely unappreciative of my rhetorical skills.\n\nStuck. The sheet-metal chimneys stand tall around the roof, unevenly distributed\naccording to some inscrutable logic that could only be understood with the\nassistance of as-built drawings, blueprints, mechanical and structural\nengineering diagrams. Surely though, they are optimized to wick hot air out of\nthe giant brick pile's guts and exhaust it.\n\nI move to the one nearest the stairwell. It is tarred in place, its apron lined\nwith a double-row of cinderblocks that have pools of brackish water and cobwebs\ngathered in their holes. I stick my hand in the first and drag it off the apron.\nI repeat it.\n\nNow the chimney is standing on its own, in the middle of a nonsensical\ncinderblock-henge. My hands are dripping with muck and grotendousness. I wipe\nthem off on the pea gravel and then dry them on my boxer shorts, then hug the\nchimney and lean forward. It gives, slowly, slightly, and springs back. I give\nit a harder push, really give it my weight, but it won't budge. Belatedly, I\nrealize that I'm standing on its apron, trying to lift myself along with the\nchimney.\n\nI take a step back and lean way forward, try again. It's awkward, but I'm making\nprogress, bent like an ell, pushing with my legs and lower back. I feel\nsomething pop around my sacrum, know that I'll regret this deeply when my back\nkacks out completely, but it'll be all for naught if I don't keep! on! pushing!\n\nThen, suddenly, the chimney gives, its apron swinging up and hitting me in the\nknees so that I topple forward with it, smashing my chin on its hood. For a\nmoment, I lie down atop it, like a stupefied lover, awestruck by my own inanity.\nThe smell of blood rouses me. I tentatively reach my hand to my chin and feel\nthe ragged edge of a cut there, opened from the tip and along my jawbone almost\nto my ear. The cut is too fresh to hurt, but it's bleeding freely and I know\nit'll sting like a bastard soon enough. I go to my knees and scream, then scream\nagain as I rend open my chin further.\n\nMy knees and shins are grooved with deep, parallel cuts, gritted with gravel and\ngrime. Standing hurts so much that I go back to my knees, holler again at the\npain in my legs as I grind more gravel into my cuts, and again as I tear my face\nopen some more. I end up fetal on my side, sticky with blood and weeping softly\nwith an exquisite self-pity that is more than the cuts and bruises, more than\nthe betrayal, more than the foreknowledge of punishment. I am weeping for\nmyself, and my identity, and my smarts over happiness and the thought that I\nwould indeed choose happiness over smarts any day.\n\nToo damned smart for my own good.\n\n14.\n\n\"I just don't get it,\" Fede said.\n\nArt tried to keep the exasperation out of his voice. \"It's simple,\" he said.\n\"It's like a car radio with a fast-forward button. You drive around on the\nMassPike, and your car automatically peers with nearby vehicles. It grabs the\ncurrent song on someone else's stereo and streamloads it. You listen to it. If\nyou don't hit the fast-forward button, the car starts grabbing everything it can\nfrom the peer, all the music on the stereo, and cues it up for continued play.\nOnce that pool is exhausted, it queries your peer for a list of its peers -- the\ncars that it's getting its music from -- and sees if any of them are in range,\nand downloads from them. So, it's like you're exploring a taste-network, doing\nan automated, guided search through traffic for the car whose owner has\ncollected the music you most want to listen to.\"\n\n\"But I hate your music -- I don't want to listen to the stuff on your radio.\"\n\n\"Fine. That's what the fast-forward button is for. It skips to another car and\nstarts streamloading off of its drive.\" Fede started to say something, and Art\nheld up his hand. \"And if you exhaust all the available cars, the system\nrecycles, but asks its peers for files collected from other sources. You might\nhate the songs I downloaded from Al, but the songs I got from Bennie are right\nup your alley.\n\n\"The war-drivers backstop the whole system. They've got the biggest collections\non the freeway, and they're the ones most likely to build carefully thought-out\nplaylists. They've got entire genres -- the whole history of the blues, say,\nfrom steel cylinders on -- on their drives. So we encourage them. When you go\nthrough a paypoint -- a toll booth -- we debit you for the stuff that you didn't\nfast-forward, the stuff you listened to and kept. Unless, that is, you've got\nmore than, say, 10,000 songs onboard. Then you go free. It's counterintuitive, I\nknow, but just look at the numbers.\"\n\n\"OK, OK. A radio with a fast-forward button. I think I get it.\"\n\n\"But?\"\n\n\"But who's going to want to use this? It's unpredictable. You've got no\nguarantee you'll get the songs you want to hear.\"\n\nArt smiled. \"Exactly!\"\n\nFede gave him a go-on wave.\n\n\"Don't you see? That's the crack-cocaine part! It's the thrill of the chase!\nNobody gets excited about beating traffic on a back road that's always empty.\nBut get on the M-5 after a hard day at work and drive it at 100 km/h for two\nhours without once touching your brakes and it's like God's reached down and\nparted the Red Seas for you. You get a sense of *accomplishment*! Most of the\ntime, your car stereo's gonna play the same junk you've always heard, just\nbackground sound, but sometimes, ah! Sometimes you'll hit a sweet spot and get\nthe best tunes you've ever heard. If you put a rat in a cage with a lever that\ndoesn't give food pellets, he'll push it once or twice and give up. Set the\nlever to always deliver food pellets and he'll push it when he gets hungry. Set\nit to *sometimes* deliver food pellets and he'll bang on it until he passes\nout!\"\n\n\"Heh,\" Fede said. \"Good rant.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"And it's cool.\" Fede looked off into the middle distance a while. \"Radio with a\nfast-forward button. That's great, actually. Amazing. Stupendous!\" He snatched\nthe axe-head from its box on Art's desk and did a little war dance around the\nroom, whooping. Art followed the dance from his ergonomic chair, swiveling\naround as the interface tchotchkes that branched from its undersides chittered\nto keep his various bones and muscles firmly supported.\n\nHis office was more like a three-fifths-scale model of a proper office, in\nLilliputian London style, so the war dance was less impressive than it might\nhave been with more room to express itself. \"You like it, then,\" Art said, once\nFede had run out of steam.\n\n\"I do, I do, I do!\"\n\n\"Great.\"\n\n\"Great.\"\n\n\"So.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"So what do we do with it? Should I write up a formal proposal and send it to\nJersey? How much detail? Sketches? Code fragments? Want me to mock up the\ninterface and the network model?\"\n\nFede cocked an eyebrow at him. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Well, we give this to Jersey, they submit the proposal, they walk away with the\ncontract, right? That's our job, right?\"\n\n\"No, Art, that's not our job. Our job is to see to it that V/DT submits a bad\nproposal, not that Jersey submits a good one. This is big. We roll this together\nand it's bigger than MassPike. We can run this across every goddamned toll road\nin the world! Jersey's not paying for this -- not yet, anyway -- and someone\nshould.\"\n\n\"You want to sell this to them?\"\n\n\"Well, I want to sell this. Who to sell it to is another matter.\"\n\nArt waved his hands confusedly. \"You're joking, right?\"\n\nFede crouched down beside Art and looked into his eyes. \"No, Art, I am serious\nas a funeral here. This is big, and it's not in the scope of work that we signed\nup for. You and me, we can score big on this, but not by handing it over to\nthose shitheads in Jersey and begging for a bonus.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about? Who else would pay for this?\"\n\n\"You have to ask? V/DT for starters. Anyone working on a bid for MassPike, or\nTollPass, or FastPass, or EuroPass.\"\n\n\"But we can't sell this to just *anyone*, Fede!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Jesus. Why not? Because of the Tribes.\"\n\nFede quirked him half a smile. \"Sure, the Tribes.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"Art, you know that stuff is four-fifths' horseshit, right? It's just a game.\nWhen it comes down to your personal welfare, you can't depend on time zones.\nThis is more job than calling, you know.\"\n\nArt squirmed and flushed. \"Lots of us take this stuff seriously, Fede. It's not\njust a mind-game. Doesn't loyalty mean anything to you?\"\n\nFede laughed nastily. \"Loyalty! If you're doing all of this out of loyalty, then\nwhy are you drawing a paycheck? Look, I'd rather that this go to Jersey. They're\nbasically decent sorts, and I've drawn a lot of pay from them over the years,\nbut they haven't paid for this. They wouldn't give us a free ride, so why should\nwe give them one? All I'm saying is, we can offer this to Jersey, of course, but\nthey have to bid for it in a competitive marketplace. I don't want to gouge\nthem, just collect a fair market price for our goods.\"\n\n\"You're saying you don't feel any fundamental loyalty to anything, Fede?\"\n\n\"That's what I'm saying.\"\n\n\"And you're saying that I'm a sucker for putting loyalty ahead of personal gain\n-- after all, no one else is, right?\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"Then how did this idea become 'ours,' Fede? I came up with it.\"\n\nFede lost his nasty smile. \"There's loyalty and then there's loyalty.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\n\"No, really. You and I are a team. I rely on you and you rely on me. We're loyal\nto something concrete -- each other. The Eastern Standard Tribe is an\nabstraction. It's a whole bunch of people, and neither of us like most of 'em.\nIt's useful and pleasant, but you can't put your trust in institutions --\notherwise you get Nazism.\"\n\n\"And patriotism.\"\n\n\"Blind patriotism.\"\n\n\"So there's no other kind? Just jingoism? You're either loyal to your immediate\ncircle of friends or you're a deluded dupe?\"\n\n\"No, that's not what I'm saying.\"\n\n\"So where does informed loyalty leave off and jingoism begin? You come on all\npatronizing when I talk about being loyal to the Tribe, and you're certainly not\nloyal to V/DT, nor are you loyal to Jersey. What greater purpose are you loyal\nto?\"\n\n\"Well, humanity, for starters.\"\n\n\"Really. What's that when it's at home?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"How do you express loyalty to something as big and abstract as 'humanity'?\"\n\n\"Well, that comes down to morals, right? Not doing things that poison the world.\nPaying taxes. Change to panhandlers. Supporting charities.\" Fede drummed his\nfingers on his thighs. \"Not murdering or raping, you know. Being a good person.\nA moral person.\"\n\n\"OK, that's a good code of conduct. I'm all for not murdering and raping, and\nnot just because it's *wrong*, but because a world where the social norms\ninclude murdering and raping is a bad one for me to live in.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"\n\n\"That's the purpose of morals and loyalty, right? To create social norms that\nproduce a world you want to live in.\"\n\n\"Right! And that's why *personal* loyalty is important.\"\n\nArt smiled. Trap baited and sprung. \"OK. So institutional loyalty -- loyalty to\na Tribe or a nation -- that's not an important social norm. As far as you're\nconcerned, we could abandon all pretense of institutional loyalty.\" Art dropped\nhis voice. \"You could go to work for the Jersey boys, sabotaging Virgin/Deutsche\nTelekom, just because they're willing to pay you to do it. Nothing to do with\nTribal loyalty, just a job.\"\n\nFede looked uncomfortable, sensing the impending rhetorical headlock. He nodded\ncautiously.\n\n\"Which means that the Jersey boys have no reason to be loyal to you. It's just a\njob. So if there were an opportunity for them to gain some personal advantage by\nselling you out, turning you into a patsy for them, well, they should just go\nahead and do it, right?\"\n\n\"Uh --\"\n\n\"Don't worry, it's a rhetorical question. Jersey boys sell you out. You take\ntheir fall, they benefit. If there was no institutional loyalty, that's where\nyou'd end up, right? That's the social norm you want.\"\n\n\"No, of course it isn't.\"\n\n\"No, of course not. You want a social norm where individuals can be disloyal to\nthe collective, but not vice versa.\"\n\n\"Yes --\"\n\n\"Yes, but loyalty is bidirectional. There's no basis on which you may expect\nloyalty from an institution unless you're loyal to it.\"\n\n\"I suppose.\"\n\n\"You know it. I know it. Institutional loyalty is every bit as much about\ninformed self-interest as personal loyalty is. The Tribe takes care of me, I\ntake care of the Tribe. We'll negotiate a separate payment from Jersey for this\n-- after all, this is outside of the scope of work that we're being paid for --\nand we'll split the money, down the middle. We'll work in a residual income with\nJersey, too, because, as you say, this is bigger than MassPike. It's a genuinely\ngood idea, and there's enough to go around. All right?\"\n\n\"Are you asking me or telling me?\"\n\n\"I'm asking you. This will require both of our cooperation. I'm going to need to\nmanufacture an excuse to go stateside to explain this to them and supervise the\nprototyping. You're going to have to hold down the fort here at V/DT and make\nsure that I'm clear to do my thing. If you want to go and sell this idea\nelsewhere, well, that's going to require my cooperation, or at least my silence\n-- if I turn this over to V/DT, they'll pop you for industrial espionage. So we\nneed each other.\"\n\nArt stood and looked down at Fede, who was a good ten centimeters shorter than\nhe, looked down at Fede's sweaty upper lip and creased brow. \"We're a good team,\nFede. I don't want to toss away an opportunity, but I also don't want to exploit\nit at the expense of my own morals. Can you agree to work with me on this, and\ntrust me to do the right thing?\"\n\nFede looked up. \"Yes,\" he said. On later reflection, Art thought that the *yes*\ncame too quickly, but then, he was just relieved to hear it. \"Of course. Of\ncourse. Yes. Let's do it.\"\n\n\"That's just fine,\" Art said. \"Let's get to work, then.\"\n\nThey fell into their traditional division of labor then, Art working on a\nvariety of user-experience plans, dividing each into subplans, then devising\nprotocols for user testing to see what would work in the field; Fede working on\nlogistics from plane tickets to personal days to budget and critical-path\ncharts. They worked side by side, but still used the collaboration tools that\nArt had grown up with, designed to allow remote, pseudonymous parties to fit\ntheir separate work components into the same structure, resolving schedule and\nplanning collisions where it could and throwing exceptions where it couldn't.\nThey worked beside each other and each hardly knew the other was there, and\nthat, Art thought, when he thought of it, when the receptionist commed him to\ntell him that \"Linderrr\" -- freakin' teabags -- was there for him, that was the\ndefining characteristic of a Tribalist. A norm, a modus operandi, a way of being\nthat did not distinguish between communication face-to-face and communication at\na distance.\n\n\"Linderrr?\" Fede said, cocking an eyebrow.\n\n\"I hit her with my car,\" Art said.\n\n\"Ah,\" Fede said. \"Smooth.\"\n\nArt waved a hand impatiently at him and went out to the reception area to fetch\nher. The receptionist had precious little patience for entertaining personal\nvisitors, and Linda, in track pants and a baggy sweater, was clearly not a\nprofessional contact. The receptionist glared at him as he commed into the lobby\nand extended his hand to Linda, who took it, put it on her shoulder, grabbed his\nass, crushed their pelvises together and jammed her tongue in his ear. \"I missed\nyou,\" she slurped, the buzz of her voice making him writhe. \"I'm not wearing any\nknickers,\" she continued, loud enough that he was sure that the receptionist\nheard. He felt the blush creeping over his face and neck and ears.\n\nThe receptionist. Dammit, why was he thinking about the receptionist? \"Linda,\"\nhe said, pulling away. Introduce her, he thought. Introduce them, and that'll\nmake it less socially awkward. The English can't abide social awkwardness.\n\"Linda, meet --\" and he trailed off, realizing he didn't actually know the\nreceptionist's name.\n\nThe receptionist glared at him from under a cap of shining candy-apple red hair,\nnarrowing her eyes, which were painted in high style with Kubrick action-figure\nfaces.\n\n\"My *name* is Tonaishah,\" she hissed. Or maybe it was *Tanya Iseah*, or\n*Taneesha*. He still didn't know her goddamned name.\n\n\"And this is Linda,\" he said, weakly. \"We're going out tonight.\"\n\n\"And won't you have a dirty great time, then?\" Tonaishah said.\n\n\"I'm sure we will,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Tonaishah said.\n\nArt commed the door and missed the handle, then snagged it and grabbed Linda's\nhand and yanked her through.\n\n\"I'm a little randy,\" she said, directly into his ear. \"Sorry.\" She giggled.\n\n\"Someone you have to meet,\" he said, reaching down to rearrange his pants to\nhide his boner.\n\n\"Ooh, right here in your office?\" Linda said, covering his hand with hers.\n\n\"Someone with *two* eyes,\" he said, moving her hand to his hip.\n\n\"Ahh,\" she said. \"What a disappointment.\"\n\n\"I'm serious. I want you to meet my friend Fede. I think you two will really hit\nit off.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Linda said. \"Isn't this a major step? Meeting the friends? Are we\ngetting that serious already?\"\n\n\"Oh, I think we're ready for it,\" Art said, draping an arm around her shoulders\nand resting his fingertips on the upper swell of her breast.\n\nShe ducked out from under his arm and stopped in her tracks. \"Well, I don't.\nDon't I get a say in this?\"\n\n\"What?\" Art said.\n\n\"Whether it's time for me to meet your friends or not. Shouldn't I have a say?\"\n\n\"Linda, I just wanted to introduce you to a coworker before we went out. He's in\nmy office -- I gotta grab my jacket there, anyway.\"\n\n\"Wait, is he a friend or a coworker?\"\n\n\"He's a friend I work with. Come on, what's the big deal?\"\n\n\"Well, first you spring this on me, then you change your story and tell me he's\na coworker, now he's a friend again. I don't want to be put on display for your\npals. If we're going to meet your friends, I'll dress for it, put on some\nmakeup. This isn't fair.\"\n\n\"Linda,\" Art said, placating.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"Screw it. I'm not here to meet your friends. I came all the way\nacross town to meet you at your office because you wanted to head back to your\nplace after work, and you play headgames with me like this?\"\n\n\"All right,\" Art said. \"I'll show you back out to the lobby and you can wait\nwith Tonaishah while I get my jacket.\"\n\n\"Don't take that tone with me,\" she said.\n\n\"What tone?\" Art said. \"Jesus Christ! You can't wait in the hall, it's against\npolicy. You don't have a badge, so you have to be with me or in the lobby. I\ndon't give a shit if you meet Fede or not.\"\n\n\"I won't tell you again, Art,\" she said. \"Moderate your tone. I won't be shouted\nat.\"\n\nArt tried to rewind the conversation and figure out how they came to this pass,\nbut he couldn't. Was Linda really acting *this* nuts? Or was he just reading her\nwrong or pushing her buttons or something?\n\n\"Let's start over,\" he said, grabbing both of her hands in his. \"I need to get\nmy jacket from my office. You can come with me if you want to, and meet my\nfriend Fede. Otherwise you can wait in the lobby, I won't be a minute.\"\n\n\"Let's go meet Fede,\" she said. \"I hope he wasn't expecting anything special,\nI'm not really dressed for it.\"\n\nHe stifled a snotty remark. After all that, she was going to go and meet Fede?\nSo what the hell were they arguing about? On the other hand, he'd gotten his\nway, hadn't he? He led her by the hand to his office, and beyond every doorway\nthey passed was a V/DT Experience Designer pretending not to peek at them as\nthey walked by, having heard every word through the tricky acoustics of O'Malley\nHouse.\n\n\"Fede,\" he said, stiffly, \"This is Linda. Linda, this is Fede.\"\n\nFede stood and treated Linda to his big, suave grin. Fede might be short and he\nmight have paranoid delusions, but he was trim and well groomed, with the sort\nof finicky moustache that looked like a rotting caterpillar if you didn't trim\nit every morning. He liked to work out, and had a tight waist and a gut you\ncould bounce a quarter off of, and liked to wear tight shirts that showed off\nhis overall fitness, made him stand out among the spongy mouse-potatoes of the\ncorporate world. Art had never given it much thought, but now, standing with\nFede and Linda in his tiny office, breathing in Fede's Lilac Vegetal and Linda's\nnew-car-smell shampoo, he felt paunchy and sloppy.\n\n\"Ah,\" Fede said, taking her hand. \"The one you hit with your car. It's a\npleasure. You seem to be recovering nicely, too.\"\n\nLinda smiled and gave him a peck on the cheek, a few strands of her bobbed hair\nsticking to his moustache like cobwebs as she pulled away.\n\n\"It was just a love tap,\" she said. \"I'll be fine.\"\n\n\"Fede's from New York,\" Art said. \"We colonials like to stick together around\nthe office. And Linda's from Los Angeles.\"\n\n\"Aren't there any, you know, British people in London?\" Linda said, wrinkling\nher nose.\n\n\"There's Tonaishah,\" Art said weakly.\n\n\"Who?\" Fede said.\n\n\"The receptionist,\" Linda said. \"Not a very nice person.\"\n\n\"With the eyes?\" Fede said, wriggling his fingers around his temples to indicate\nelaborate eye makeup.\n\n\"That's her,\" Linda said.\n\n\"Nasty piece of work,\" Fede said. \"Never trusted her.\"\n\n\"*You're* not another UE person, are you?\" Linda said, sizing Fede up and giving\nArt a playful elbow in the ribs.\n\n\"Who, me? Nah. I'm a management consultant. I work in Chelsea mostly, but when I\ncome slumming in Piccadilly, I like to comandeer Art's office. He's not bad, for\na UE-geek.\"\n\n\"Not bad at all,\" Linda said, slipping an arm around Art's waist, wrapping her\nfingers around the waistband of his trousers. \"Did you need to grab your jacket,\nhoney?\"\n\nArt's jacket was hanging on the back of his office door, and to get at it, he\nhad to crush himself against Linda and maneuver the door shut. He felt her\nbreasts soft on his chest, felt her breath tickle his ear, and forgot all about\ntheir argument in the corridor.\n\n\"All right,\" Art said, hooking his jacket over his shoulder with a finger,\nfeeling flushed and fluttery. \"OK, let's go.\"\n\n\"Lovely to have met you, Fede,\" Linda said, taking his hand.\n\n\"And likewise,\" Fede said.\n\n15.\n\nVigorous sex ensued.\n\n16.\n\nArt rolled out of bed at dark o'clock in the morning, awakened by circadians and\nendorphins and bladder. He staggered to the toilet in the familiar gloom of his\nshabby little rooms, did his business, marveled at the tenderness of his\nprivates, fumbled for the flush mechanism -- \"British\" and \"Plumbing\" being two\ncompletely opposite notions -- and staggered back to bed. The screen of his\ncomm, nestled on the end table, washed the room in liquid-crystal light. He'd\ntugged the sheets off of Linda when he got up, and there she was, chest rising\nand falling softly, body rumpled and sprawled after their gymnastics. It had\nbeen transcendent and messy, and the sheets were coarse with dried fluids.\n\nHe knelt on the bed and fussed with the covers some, trying for an equitable --\nif not chivalrously so -- division of blankets. He bent forward to kiss at a\nbite-mark he'd left on her shoulder.\n\nHis back went \"pop.\"\n\nSomewhere down in the lumbar, somewhere just above his tailbone, a deep and\nunforgiving *pop*, ominous as the cocking of a revolver. He put his hand there\nand it felt OK, so he cautiously lay back. Three-quarters of the way down, his\nentire lower back seized up, needles of fire raced down his legs and through his\ngroin, and he collapsed.\n\nHe *barked* with pain, an inhuman sound he hadn't known he could make, and the\nrapid emptying of his lungs deepened the spasm, and he mewled. Linda opened a\ngroggy eye and put her hand on his shoulder. \"What is it, hon?\"\n\nHe tried to straighten out, to find a position in which the horrible, relentless\npain returned whence it came. Each motion was agony. Finally, the pain subsided,\nand he found himself pretzelled, knees up, body twisted to the left, head\ntwisted to the right. He did not dare budge from this posture, terrified that\nthe pain would return.\n\n\"It's my back,\" he gasped.\n\n\"Whah? Your back?\"\n\n\"I -- I put it out. Haven't done it in years. I need an icepack, OK? There're\nsome headache pills in the medicine cabinet. Three of those.\"\n\n\"Seriously?\"\n\n\"Look, I'd get 'em myself, but I can't even sit up, much less walk. I gotta ice\nthis down now before it gets too inflamed.\"\n\n\"How did it happen?\"\n\n\"It just happens. Tai Chi helps. Please, I need ice.\"\n\nHalf an hour later, he had gingerly arranged himself with his knees up and his\nhips straight, and he was breathing deeply, willing the spasms to unclench.\n\"Thanks,\" he said.\n\n\"What now? Should I call a doctor?\"\n\n\"He'd just give me painkillers and tell me to lose some weight. I'll probably be\nlike this for a week. Shit. Fede's going to kill me. I was supposed to go to\nBoston next Friday, too.\"\n\n\"Boston? What for? For how long?\"\n\nArt bunched the sheets in his fists. He hadn't meant to tell her about Boston\nyet -- he and Fede hadn't worked out his cover story. \"Meetings,\" he said. \"Two\nor three days. I was going to take some personal time and go see my family, too.\nGoddamnit. Pass me my comm, OK?\"\n\n\"You're going to *work* now?\"\n\n\"I'm just going to send Fede a message and send out for some muscle-relaxants.\nThere's a twenty-four-hour chemist's at Paddington Station that delivers.\"\n\n\"I'll do it, you lie flat.\"\n\nAnd so it began. Bad enough to be helpless, weak as a kitten and immobile, but\nto be at the whim of someone else, to have to provide sufficient excuse for\nevery use of his comm, every crawl across the flat... Christ. \"Just give me my\ncomm, please. I can do it faster than I can explain how to do it.\"\n\nIn thirty-six hours, he was ready to tear the throat out of anyone who tried to\ncommunicate with him. He'd harangued Linda out of the flat and crawled to the\nkitchen floor, painstakingly assembling a nest of pillows and sofa cushions,\nclose to the icemaker and the painkillers and toilet. His landlady, an\nunfriendly Chinese lady who had apparently been wealthy beyond words in Hong\nKong and clearly resented her reduced station, agreed to sign for the supply\ndrops he commed to various retailers around London.\n\nHe was giving himself a serious crick in his neck and shoulder from working\nsupine, comm held over his head. The painkillers weighted his arms and churned\nhis guts, and at least twice an hour, he'd grog his way into a better position,\nforgetting the tenderness in his back, and bark afresh as his nerves shrieked\nand sizzled.\n\nTwo days later and he was almost unrecognizable, a gamey, unshaven lump in the\ntiny kitchen, his nest gray with sweat and stiff with spilled take-away curry.\nHe suspected that he was overmedicating, forgetting whether he'd taken his\ntablets and taking more. In one of his more lucid moments, he realized that\nthere was a feedback cycle at play here -- the more pills he took, the less\nequipped he was to judge whether he'd taken his pills, so the more pills he\ntook. His mind meandered through a solution to this, a timer-equipped pillcase\nthat reset when you took the lid off and chimed if you took the lid off again\nbefore the set interval had elapsed. He reached for his comm to make some notes,\nfound it wedged under one of his hocks, greasy with sweat, batteries dead. He\nhadn't let his comm run down in a decade, at least.\n\nHis landlady let Linda in on the fourth day, as he was sleeping fitfully with a\npillow over his face to shut out the light from the window. He'd tried to draw\nthe curtains a day -- two days? -- before, but had given up when he tried to\npull himself upright on the sill only to collapse in a fresh gout of writhing.\nLinda crouched by his head and stroked his greasy hair softly until he flipped\nthe pillow off his face with a movement of his neck. He squinted up at her,\nimpossibly fresh and put together and incongruous in his world of reduced\ncircumstances.\n\n\"Art. Art. Art. Art! You're a mess, Art! Jesus. Why aren't you in bed?\"\n\n\"Too far,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"What would your grandmother say? Dear-oh-dearie. Come on, let's get you up and\ninto bed, and then I'm going to have a doctor and a massage therapist sent in.\nYou need a nice, hot bath, too. It'll be good for you and hygienic besides.\"\n\n\"No tub,\" he said petulantly.\n\n\"I know, I know. Don't worry about it. I'll sort it out.\"\n\nAnd she did, easing him to his feet and helping him into bed. She took his house\nkeys and disappeared for some unknowable time, then reappeared with fresh linen\nin store wrappers, which she lay on the bed carefully, making tight hospital\ncorners and rolling him over, nurse-style, to do the other side. He heard her\nclattering in the kitchen, running the faucets, moving furniture. He reminded\nhimself to ask her to drop his comm in its charger, then forgot.\n\n\"Come on, time to get up again,\" she said, gently peeling the sheets back.\n\n\"It's OK,\" he said, waving weakly at her.\n\n\"Yes, it is. Let's get up.\" She took his ankles and gradually turned him on the\nbed so that his feet were on the floor, then grabbed him by his stinking armpits\nand helped him to his feet. He stumbled with her into his crowded living room,\ndimly aware of the furniture stacked on itself around him. She left him hanging\non the door lintel and then began removing his clothes. She actually used a\nscissors to cut away his stained tee shirt and boxer shorts. \"All right,\" she\nsaid, \"into the tub.\"\n\n\"No tub,\" he said.\n\n\"Look down, Art,\" she said.\n\nHe did. An inflatable wading pool sat in the middle of his living room, flanked\nby an upended coffee table and his sofa, standing on its ear. The pool was full\nof steaming, cloudy water. \"There's a bunch of eucalyptus oil and Epsom salts in\nthere. You're gonna love it.\"\n\nThat night, Art actually tottered into the kitchen and got himself a glass of\nwater, one hand pressed on his lower back. The cool air of the apartment fanned\nthe mentholated liniment on his back and puckered goose pimples all over his\nbody. After days of leaden limbs, he felt light and clean, his senses singing as\nthough he was emerging from a fever. He drank the water, and retrieved his comm\nfrom its cradle.\n\nHe propped several pillows up on his headboard and fired up his comm.\nImmediately, it began to buzz and hum and chatter and blink, throwing up alerts\nabout urgent messages, pages and calls pending. The lightness he'd felt fled\nhim, and he began the rotten business of triaging his in-box.\n\nOne strong impression emerged almost immediately: Fede wanted him in Boston.\n\nThe Jersey clients were interested in the teasers that Fede had forwarded to\nthem. The Jersey clients were obsessed with the teasers that Fede had forwarded\nto them. The Jersey clients were howling for more after the teasers that Fede\nhad forwarded to them. Fede had negotiated some big bucks on approval if only\nArt would go and talk to the Jersey clients. The Jersey clients had arranged a\nmeeting with some of the MassPike decision-makers for the following week, and\nnow they were panicking because they didn't have anything *except* the teasers\nFede had forwarded to them.\n\nYou should really try to go to Boston, Art. We need you in Boston, Art. You have\nto go to Boston, Art. Art, go to Boston. Boston, Art. Boston.\n\nLinda rolled over in bed and peered up at him. \"You're *not* working again, are\nyou?\"\n\n\"Shhh,\" Art said. \"It's less stressful if I get stuff done than if I let it pile\nup.\"\n\n\"Then why is your forehead all wrinkled up?\"\n\n\"I have to go to Boston,\" he said. \"Day after tomorrow, I think.\"\n\n\"Jesus, are you insane? Trying to cripple yourself?\"\n\n\"I can recover in a hotel room just as well as I can recover here. It's just\nrest from here on in, anyway. And a hotel will probably have a tub.\"\n\n\"I can't believe I'm hearing this. You're not going to *recover* in Boston.\nYou'll be at meetings and stuff. Christ!\"\n\n\"I've got to do this,\" Art said. \"I just need to figure out how. I'll go\nbusiness class, take along a lumbar pillow, and spend every moment that I'm not\nin a meeting in a tub or getting a massage. I could use a change of scenery\nabout now, anyway.\"\n\n\"You're a goddamned idiot, you know that?\"\n\nArt knew it. He also knew that here was an opportunity to get back to EST, to\nmake a good impression on the Jersey clients, to make his name in the Tribe and\nto make a bundle of cash. His back be damned, he was sick of lying around\nanyway. \"I've got to go, Linda.\"\n\n\"It's your life,\" she said, and tossed aside the covers. \"But I don't have to\nsit around watching you ruin it.\" She disappeared into the hallway, then\nreemerged, dressed and with her coat on. \"I'm out of here.\"\n\n\"Linda,\" Art said.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"Shut up. Why the fuck should I care if you don't, huh? I'm\ngoing. See you around.\"\n\n\"Come on, let's talk about this.\"\n\nEast-Coast pizza. Flat Boston twangs. The coeds rushing through Harvard Square\nand oh, maybe a side trip to New York, maybe another up to Toronto and a roti at\none of the halal Guyanese places on Queen Street. He levered himself painfully\nout of bed and hobbled to the living room, where Linda was arguing with a taxi\ndispatcher over her comm, trying to get them to send out a cab at two in the\nmorning.\n\n\"Come on,\" Art said. \"Hang that up. Let's talk about this.\"\n\nShe shot him a dirty look and turned her back, kept on ranting down the comm at\nthe dispatcher.\n\n\"Linda, don't do this. Come on.\"\n\n\"I am on the phone!\" she said to him, covering the mouthpiece. \"Shut the fuck\nup, will you?\" She uncovered the mouthpiece. \"Hello? Hello?\" The dispatcher had\nhung up. She snapped the comm shut and slammed it into her purse. She whirled to\nface Art, snorting angry breaths through her nostrils. Her face was such a mask\nof rage that Art recoiled, and his back twinged. He clasped at it and carefully\nlowered himself onto the sofa.\n\n\"Don't do this, OK?\" he said. \"I need support, not haranguing.\"\n\n\"What's there to say? Your mind's already made up. You're going to go off and be\na fucking idiot and cripple yourself. Go ahead, you don't need my permission.\"\n\n\"Sit down, please, Linda, and talk to me. Let me explain my plan and my reasons,\nOK? Then I'll listen to you. Maybe we can sort this out and actually, you know,\ncome to understand each other's point of view.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" she said, and slammed herself into the sofa. Art bounced and he seized\nhis back reflexively, waiting for the pain, but beyond a low-grade throbbing, he\nwas OK.\n\n\"I have a very large opportunity in Boston right now. One that could really\nchange my life. Money, sure, but prestige and profile, too. A dream of an\nopportunity. I need to attend one or two meetings, and then I can take a couple\ndays off. I'll get Fede to OK a first-class flight -- we get chits we can use to\nupgrade to Virgin Upper; they've got hot tubs and massage therapists now. I'll\ncheck into a spa -- they've got a bunch on Route 128 -- and get a massage every\nmorning and have a physiotherapist up to the room every night. I can't afford\nthat stuff here, but Fede'll spring for it if I go to Boston, let me expense it.\nI'll be a good lad, I promise.\"\n\n\"I still think you're being an idiot. Why can't Fede go?\"\n\n\"Because it's my deal.\"\n\n\"Why can't whoever you're meeting with come here?\"\n\n\"That's complicated.\"\n\n\"Bullshit. I thought you wanted to talk about this?\"\n\n\"I do. I just can't talk about that part.\"\n\n\"Why not? Are you afraid I'll blab? Christ, Art. Give me some credit. Who the\nhell would I blab *to*, anyway?\"\n\n\"Look, Linda, the deal itself is confidential -- a secret. A secret's only a\nsecret if you don't tell it to anyone, all right? So I'm not going to tell you.\nIt's not relevant to the discussion, anyway.\"\n\n\"Art. Art. Art. Art, you make it all sound so reasonable, and you can dress it\nup with whatever words you want, but at the end of the day, we both know you're\nfull of shit on this. There's no *way* that doing this is better for you than\nstaying here in bed. If Fede's the problem, let me talk to him.\"\n\n\"Jesus, no!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"It's not appropriate, Linda. This is a work-related issue. It wouldn't be\nprofessional. OK, I'll concede that flying and going to meeting is more\nstressful than not flying and not going to meetings, but let's take it as a\ngiven that I *really* need to go to Boston. Can't we agree on that, and then\ndiscuss the ways that we can mitigate the risks associated with the trip?\"\n\n\"Jesus, you're an idiot,\" she said, but she seemed to be on the verge of\nsmiling.\n\n\"But I'm *your* idiot, right?\" Art said, hopefully.\n\n\"Sure, sure you are.\" She *did* smile then, and cuddle up to him on the sofa.\n\"They don't have fucking *hot tubs* in Virgin Upper, do they?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Art said, kissing her earlobe. \"They really do.\"\n\n17.\n\nOnce the blood coursing from my shins slows and clots, I take an opportunity to\ninspect the damage more closely. The cuts are relatively shallow, certainly less\nserious than they were in my runamuck imagination, which had vivid slashes of\nwhite bone visible through the divided skin. I cautiously pick out the larger\ngrit and gravel and turn my attention spinewards.\n\nI have done a number on my back, that much is certain. My old friends, the\nsacroiliac joints, feel as tight as drumheads, and they creak ominously when I\nshift to a sitting position with my back propped up on the chimney's upended\nbutt, the aluminum skirting cool as a kiss on my skin. They're only just\nstarting to twinge, a hint of the agonies to come.\n\nMy jaw, though, is pretty bad. My whole face feels swollen, and if I open my\nmouth the blood starts anew.\n\nYou know, on sober reflection, I believe that coming up to the roof was a really\nbad idea.\n\nI use the chimney to lever myself upright again, and circle it to see exactly\nwhat kind of damage I've done. There's a neat circular hole in the roof where\nthe chimney used to be, gusting warm air into my face as I peer into its depths.\nThe hole is the mouth of a piece of shiny metal conduit about the circumference\nof a basketball hoop. When I put my head into it, I hear the white noise of a\nfan, somewhere below in the building's attic. I toss some gravel down the\nconduit and listen to the report as it *ping*s off the fan blades down below.\nThat's a good, loud sound, and one that is certain to echo through the building.\n\nI rain gravel down the exhaust tube by the handful, getting into a mindless,\nshuffling rhythm, wearing the sides of my hands raw and red as I scrape the\npebbles up into handy piles. Soon I am shuffling afield of the fallen chimney,\none hand on my lumbar, crouched over like a chimp, knees splayed in an effort to\nshift stress away from my grooved calves.\n\nI'm really beating the shit out of that poor fan, I can tell. The\nshooting-gallery rattle of the gravel ricocheting off the blades is dulling now,\nsometimes followed by secondary rattles as the pebbles bounce back into the\nblades. Not sure what I'll do if the fan gives out before someone notices me up\nhere.\n\nIt's not an issue, as it turns out. The heavy fire door beyond the chimney\nswings open abruptly. A hospital maintenance gal in coveralls, roly-poly and\ndraped with tool belts and bandoliers. She's red-faced from the trek up the\nstairs, and it gives her the aspect of a fairy tale baker or candy-seller. She\nreinforces this impression by putting her plump hands to her enormous bosom and\ngasping when she catches sight of me.\n\nIt comes to me that I am quite a fucking sight. Bloody, sunburnt, wild-eyed,\nwith my simian hunch and my scabby jaw set at a crazy angle to my face and\nreality both. Not to mention my near nudity, which I'm semipositive is not her\nidea of light entertainment. \"Hey,\" I say. \"I, uh, I got stuck on the roof. The\ndoor shut.\" Talking reopens the wound on my jaw and I feel more blood trickling\ndown my neck. \"Unfortunately, I only get one chance to make a first impression,\nhuh? I'm not, you know, really *crazy,* I was just a little bored and so I went\nexploring and got stuck and tried to get someone's attention, had a couple\naccidents... It's a long story. Hey! My name's Art. What's yours?\"\n\n\"Oh my Lord!\" she said, and her hand jumps to the hammer in its bandolier\nholster on her round tummy. She claws at it frantically.\n\n\"Please,\" I say, holding my hands in front of me. \"Please. I'm hurt is all. I\ncame up here to get some fresh air and the door swung shut behind me. I tripped\nwhen I knocked over the chimney to get someone's attention. I'm not dangerous.\nPlease. Just help me get back down to the twentieth floor -- I think I might\nneed a stretcher crew, my back is pretty bad.\"\n\n\"It's Caitlin,\" she says.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\"\n\n\"My name is Caitlin,\" she says.\n\n\"Hi, Caitlin,\" I said. I extend my hand, but she doesn't move the ten yards she\nwould have to cross in order to take it. I think about moving towards her, but\nthink better of it.\n\n\"You're not up here to jump, are you?\"\n\n\"Jump? Christ, no! Just stuck is all. Just stuck.\"\n\nLinda's goddamned boyfriend was into all this flaky Getting to Yes shit,\nsubliminal means of establishing rapport and so on. Linda and I once spent an\nafternoon at the Children's Carousel uptown in Manhattan, making fun of all his\nnewage theories. The one that stood out in my mind as funniest was synching your\nbreathing -- \"What you resist persists, so you need to turn resistance into\nassistance,\" Linda recounted. You match breathing with your subject for fifteen\nbreaths and they unconsciously become receptive to your suggestions. I have a\nsuspicion that Caitlin might bolt, duck back through the door and pound down the\nstairs on her chubby little legs and leave me stranded.\n\nSo I try it, match my breath to her heaving bosom. She's still panting from her\ntrek up the stairs and fifteen breaths go by in a quick pause. The silence\nstretches, and I try to remember what I'm supposed to do next. Lead the subject,\nthat's it. I slow my breathing down gradually and, amazingly, her breath slows\ndown along with mine, until we're both breathing great, slow breaths. It works\n-- it's flaky and goofy California shit, but it works.\n\n\"Caitlin,\" I say calmly, making it part of an exhalation.\n\n\"Yes,\" she says, still wary.\n\n\"Have you got a comm?\"\n\n\"I do, yes.\"\n\n\"Can you please call downstairs and ask them to send up a stretcher crew? I've\nhurt my back and I won't be able to handle the stairs.\"\n\n\"I can do that, yes.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Caitlin.\"\n\nIt feels like cheating. I didn't have to browbeat her or puncture her bad\nreasoning -- all it took was a little rapport, a little putting myself in her\nshoes. I can't believe it worked, but Caitlin flips a ruggedized comm off her\nhip and speaks into it in a calm, efficient manner.\n\n\"Thank you, Caitlin,\" I say again. I start to ease myself to a sitting position,\nand my back gives way, so that I crash to the rooftop, mewling, hands clutched\nto my spasming lumbar. And then Caitlin's at my side, pushing my hands away from\nmy back, strong thumbs digging into the spasming muscles around my iliac crests,\nsoothing and smoothing them out, tracing the lines of fire back to the nodes of\nthe joints, patiently kneading the spasms out until the pain recedes to a soft\nthrobbing.\n\n\"My old man used to get that,\" she said. \"All us kids had to take turns working\nit out for him.\" I'm on my back, staring up over her curves and rolls and into\nher earnest, freckled face.\n\n\"Oh, God, that feels good,\" I say.\n\n\"That's what the old man used to say. You're too young to have a bad back.\"\n\n\"I have to agree,\" I say.\n\n\"All right, I'm going to prop your knees up and lay your head down. I need to\nhave a look at that ventilator.\"\n\nI grimace. \"I'm afraid I did a real number on it,\" I say. \"Sorry about that.\"\n\nShe waves a chubby pish-tosh at me with her freckled hand and walks over to the\nchimney, leaving me staring at the sky, knees bent, waiting for the stretcher\ncrew.\n\nWhen they arrive, Caitlin watches as they strap me onto the board, tying me\ntighter than is strictly necessary for my safety, and I realize that I'm not\nbeing tied *down*, I'm being tied *up*.\n\n\"Thanks, Caitlin,\" I say.\n\n\"You're welcome, Art.\"\n\n\"Good luck with the ventilator -- sorry again.\"\n\n\"That's all right, kid. It's my job, after all.\"\n\n18.\n\nVirgin Upper's hot tubs were more theoretically soothing than actually so. They\nhad rather high walls and a rather low water level, both for modesty's sake and\nto prevent spills. Art passed through the miniature sauna/shower and into the\ntub after his massage, somewhere over Newfoundland, and just as the plane hit\nturbulence, buffeting him with chlorinated water that stung his eyes and got up\nhis nose and soaked the magazine on offshore investing that he'd found in the\nback of his seat pocket.\n\nHe landed at JFK still smelling of chlorine and sandalwood massage oil and the\ncantaloupe-scented lotion in the fancy toilets. Tension melted away from him as\nhe meandered to the shuttle stop. The air had an indefinable character of\nhomeliness, or maybe it was the sunlight. Amateur Tribal anthropologists were\nalways thrashing about light among themselves, arguing about the sun's character\nvarying from latitude to latitude, filtered through this city's pollution\nsignature or that.\n\nThe light or the air, the latitude or the smog, it felt like home. The women\nwalked with a reassuring, confident *clack clack clack* of heel on hard tile;\nthe men talked louder than was necessary to one another or to their comms. The\npeople were a riot of ethnicities and their speech was a riotous babel of\naccents, idioms and languages. Aggressive pretzel vendors vied with aggressive\npanhandlers to shake down the people waiting on the shuttle bus. Art bought a\nstale, sterno-reeking pretzel that was crusted with inedible volumes of\nyellowing salt and squirted a couple bucks at a panhandler who had been\npestering him in thick Jamaican patois but thanked him in adenoidal Brooklynese.\n\nBy the time he boarded his connection to Logan he was joggling his knees\nuncontrollably in his seat, his delight barely contained. He got an undrinkable\ncan of watery Budweiser and propped it up on his tray table alongside his\ninedible pretzel and arranged them in a kind of symbolic tableau of all things\nESTian.\n\nHe commed Fede from the guts of the tunnels that honeycombed Boston, realizing\nwith a thrill as Fede picked up that it was two in the morning in London, at the\nnominal GMT+0, while here at GMT-5 -- at the default, plus-zero time zone of his\nlife, livelihood and lifestyle -- it was only 9PM.\n\n\"Fede!\" Art said into the comm.\n\n\"Hey, Art!\" Fede said, with a false air of chipperness that Art recognized from\nany number of middle-of-the-night calls.\n\nThere was a cheap Malaysian comm that he'd once bought because of its hyped up\nde-hibernate feature -- its ability to go from its deepest power-saving\nsleepmode to full waking glory without the customary thirty seconds of\ndrive-churning housekeeping as it reestablished its network connection, verified\nits file system and memory, and pinged its buddy-list for state and presence\ninfo. This Malaysian comm, the Crackler, had the uncanny ability to go into\nsuspended animation indefinitely, and yet throw your workspace back on its\ndisplay in a hot instant.\n\nWhen Art actually laid hands on it, after it meandered its way across the world\nby slow boat, corrupt GMT+8 Posts and Telegraphs authorities, over-engineered\ncourier services and Revenue Canada's Customs agents, he was enchanted by this\nfeature. He could put the device into deep sleep, close it up, and pop its cover\nopen and poof! there were his windows. It took him three days and an interesting\ncrash to notice that even though he was seeing his workspace, he wasn't able to\ninteract with it for thirty seconds. The auspicious crash revealed the presence\nof a screenshot of his pre-hibernation workspace on the drive, and he realized\nthat the machine was tricking him, displaying the screenshot -- the illusion of\nwakefulness -- when he woke it up, relying on the illusion to endure while it\nperformed its housekeeping tasks in the background. A little stopwatch work\nproved that this chicanery actually added three seconds to the overall\nwake-time, and taught him his first important user-experience lesson: perception\nof functionality trumps the actual function.\n\nAnd here was Fede, throwing up a verbal screenshot of wakefulness while he\nchurned in the background, housekeeping himself into real alertness. \"Fede, I'm\nhere, I'm in Boston!\"\n\n\"Good Art, good. How was the trip?\"\n\n\"Wonderful. Virgin Upper was fantastic -- dancing girls, midget wrestling, hash\nbrownies...\"\n\n\"Good, very good.\"\n\n\"And now I'm driving around under Boston through a land-yacht regatta. The boats\nare mambo, but I think that banana patch the hotel soon.\"\n\n\"Glad to hear it.\" Art heard water running dimly, realized that Fede was taking\na leak.\n\n\"Meeting with the Jersey boys tomorrow. We're having brunch at a strip club.\"\n\n\"OK, OK, very funny,\" Fede said. \"I'm awake. What's up?\"\n\n\"Nothing. I just wanted to check in with you and let you know I arrived safe and\nsound. How're things in London?\"\n\n\"Your girlfriend called me.\"\n\n\"Linda?\"\n\n\"You got another girlfriend?\"\n\n\"What did she want?\"\n\n\"She wanted to chew me out for sending you overseas with your 'crippling back\ninjury.' She told me she'd hold me responsible if you got into trouble over\nthere.\"\n\n\"God, Fede, I'm sorry. I didn't put her up to it or anything --\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it. I'm glad that there's someone out there who cares about\nyou. We're getting together for dinner tonight.\"\n\n\"Fede, you know, I think Linda's terrific, but she's a little, you know,\nvolatile.\"\n\n\"Art, everyone in O'Malley House knows just how volatile she is. 'I won't tell\nyou again, Art. Moderate your tone. I won't be shouted at.'\"\n\n\"Christ, you heard that, too?\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it. She's cool and I like her and I can stand to be shouted\nat a little. When did you say you were meeting with Perceptronics?\"\n\nThe word shocked him. They never mentioned the name of the Jersey clients. It\nstarted as a game, but soon became woven into Fede's paranoid procedures.\n\nNow they had reached the endgame. Within a matter of weeks, they'd be turning in\ntheir resignations to V/DT and taking the final flight across the Atlantic and\nback to GMT-5, provocateurs no longer.\n\n\"Tomorrow afternoon. We're starting late to give me time to get a full night's\nsleep.\" The last conference call with Perceptronics had gone fantastically. His\nnormal handlers -- sour men with nasty minds who glommed onto irrelevancies in\nV/DT's strategy and teased at them until they conjured up shadowy and shrewd\nconspiracies where none existed -- weren't on that call. Instead, he'd spent a\nrollicking four hours on the line with the sharp and snarky product designers\nand engineers, bouncing ideas back and forth at speed. Even over the phone, the\nhomey voices and points of view felt indefinably comfortable and familiar.\nThey'd been delighted to start late in the day for his benefit, and had offered\nto work late and follow up with a visit to a bar where he could get a burger the\nsize of a baby's head. \"We're meeting at Perceptronics' branch office in Acton\ntomorrow and the day after, then going into MassPike. The Perceptronics guys\nsound really excited.\" Just saying the name of the company was a thrill.\n\n\"That's really excellent, Art. Go easy, though --\"\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about me. My back's feeling miles better.\" And it was, loose\nand supple the way it did after a good workout.\n\n\"That's good, but it's not what I meant. We're still closing this deal, still\ndickering over price. I need another day, maybe, to settle it. So go easy\ntomorrow. Give me a little leverage, OK?\"\n\n\"I don't get it. I thought we had a deal.\"\n\n\"Nothing's final till it's vinyl, you know that. They're balking at the royalty\nclause\" -- Fede was proposing to sell Perceptronics an exclusive license on the\nbusiness-model patent he'd filed for using Art's notes in exchange for jobs, a\nlump-sum payment and a royalty on every sub-license that Perceptronics sold to\nthe world's toll roads -- \"and we're renegotiating. They're just playing\nhardball, is all. Another day, tops, and I'll have it sorted.\"\n\n\"I'm confused. What do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Just, you know, *stall* them. Get there late. Play up your jetlag. Leave early.\nDon't get anything, you know, *done*. Use your imagination.\"\n\n\"Is there a deal or isn't there, Fede?\"\n\n\"There's a deal, there's a deal. I'll do my thing, you'll do your thing, and\nwe'll both be rich and living in New York before you know it. Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"Not really.\"\n\n\"OK, that'll have to be good enough for now. Jesus, Art, I'm doing my best here,\nall right?\"\n\n\"Say hi to Linda for me, OK?\"\n\n\"Don't be pissed at me, Art.\"\n\n\"I'm not pissed. I'll stall them. You do your thing. I'll take it easy, rest up\nmy back.\"\n\n\"All right. Have a great time, OK?\"\n\n\"I will, Fede.\"\n\nArt rang off, feeling exhausted and aggravated. He followed the tunnel signs to\nthe nearest up-ramp, wanting to get into the sunlight and architecture and warm\nhimself with both. A miniscule BMW Flea blatted its horn at him when he changed\nlanes. Had he cut the car off? He was still looking the wrong way, still\nanticipating oncoming traffic on the right. He raised a hand in an apologetic\nwave.\n\nIt wasn't enough for the Flea's driver. The car ran right up to his bumper, then\nzipped into the adjacent lane, accelerated and cut him off, nearly causing a\nwreck. As it was, Art had to swerve into the parking lane on Mass Ave -- how did\nhe get to Mass Ave? God, he was lost already -- to avoid him. The Flea backed\noff and switched lanes again, then pulled up alongside of him. The driver rolled\ndown his window.\n\n\"How the fuck do you like it, jackoff? Don't *ever* fucking cut me off!\" He was\na middle aged white guy in a suit, driving a car that was worth a year's wages\nto Art, purple-faced and pop-eyed.\n\nArt felt something give way inside, and then he was shouting back. \"When I want\nyour opinion, I'll squeeze your fucking head, you sack of shit! As it is, I can\nbarely contain my rage at the thought that a scumbag like you is consuming *air*\nthat the rest of us could be breathing! Now, roll up your goddamned window and\ndrive your fucking bourge-mobile before I smash your fucking head in!\"\n\nHe shut his mouth, alarmed. What the hell was he saying? How did he end up\nstanding here, outside of his car, shouting at the other driver, stalking\ntowards the Flea with his hands balled into fists? Why was he picking a fight\nwith this goddamned psycho, anyway? A year in peaceful, pistol-free London had\neased his normal road-rage defense systems. Now they came up full, and he\nwondered if the road-rager he'd just snapped at would haul out a\nSecond-Amendment Special and cap him.\n\nBut the other driver looked as shocked as Art felt. He rolled up his window and\nsped off, turning wildly at the next corner -- Brookline, Art saw. Art got back\ninto his rental, pulled off to the curb and asked his comm to generate an\noptimal route to his hotel, and drove in numb silence the rest of the way.\n\n19.\n\nThey let me call Gran on my second day here. Of course, Linda had already called\nher and briefed her on my supposed mental breakdown. I had no doubt that she'd\nmanaged to fake hysterical anxiety well enough to convince Gran that I'd lost it\ncompletely; Gran was already four-fifths certain that I was nuts.\n\n\"Hi, Gran,\" I said.\n\n\"Arthur! My God, how are you?\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Gran. It's a big mistake is all.\"\n\n\"A mistake? Your lady friend called me and told me what you'd done in London.\nArthur, you need help.\"\n\n\"What did Linda say?\"\n\n\"She said that you threatened to kill a coworker. She said you threatened to\nkill *her*. That you had a knife. Oh, Arthur, I'm so worried --\"\n\n\"It's not true, Gran. She's lying to you.\"\n\n\"She told me you'd say that.\"\n\n\"Of course she did. She and Fede -- a guy I worked with in London -- they're\ntrying to get rid of me. They had me locked up. I had a business deal with Fede,\nwe were selling one of my ideas to a company in New Jersey. Linda talked him\ninto selling to some people she knows in LA instead, and they conspired to cut\nme out of the deal. When I caught them at it, they got me sent away. Let me\nguess, she told you I was going to say this, too, right?\"\n\n\"Arthur, I know --\"\n\n\"You know that I'm a good guy. You raised me. I'm not nuts, OK? They just wanted\nto get me out of the way while they did their deal. A week or two and I'll be\nout again, but it will be too late. Do you believe that you know me better than\nsome girl I met a month ago?\"\n\n\"Of *course* I do, Arthur. But why would the hospital take you away if --\"\n\n\"If I wasn't crazy? I'm in here for observation -- they want to find *out* if\nI'm crazy. If *they're* not sure, then you can't be sure, right?\"\n\n\"All right. Oh, I've been sick with worry.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Gran. I need to get through this week and I'll be free and clear and\nI'll come back to Toronto.\"\n\n\"I'm going to come down there to see you. Linda told me visitors weren't\nallowed, is that true?\"\n\n\"No, it's not true.\" I thought about Gran seeing me in the ward amidst the\npukers and the screamers and the droolers and the *fondlers* and flinched away\nfrom the phone. \"But if you're going to come down, come for the hearing at the\nend of the week. There's nothing you can do here now.\"\n\n\"Even if I can't help, I just want to come and see you. It was so nice when you\nwere here.\"\n\n\"I know, I know. I'll be coming back soon, don't worry.\"\n\nIf only Gran could see me now, on the infirmary examination table, in four-point\nrestraint. Good thing she can't.\n\nA doctor looms over me. \"How are you feeling, Art?\"\n\n\"I've had better days,\" I say, with what I hope is stark sanity and humor.\nAren't crazy people incapable of humor? \"I went for a walk and the door swung\nshut behind me.\"\n\n\"Well, they'll do that,\" the doctor says. \"My name is Szandor,\" he says, and\nshakes my hand in its restraint.\n\n\"A pleasure to meet you,\" I say. \"You're a *doctor* doctor, aren't you?\"\n\n\"An MD? Yup. There're a couple of us around the place.\"\n\n\"But you're not a shrink of any description?\"\n\n\"Nope. How'd you guess?\"\n\n\"Bedside manner. You didn't patronize me.\"\n\nDr. Szandor tries to suppress a grin, then gives up. \"We all do our bit,\" he\nsays. \"How'd you get up on the roof without setting off your room alarm,\nanyway?\"\n\n\"If I tell you how I did it, I won't be able to repeat the trick,\" I say\njokingly. He's swabbing down my shins now with something that stings and cools\nat the same time. From time to time, he takes tweezers in hand and plucks loose\nsome gravel or grit and plinks it into a steel tray on a rolling table by his\nside. He's so gentle, I hardly feel it.\n\n\"What, you never heard of doctor-patient confidentiality?\"\n\n\"Is that thing still around?\"\n\n\"Oh sure! We had a mandatory workshop on it yesterday afternoon. Those are\nalways a lot of fun.\"\n\n\"So, you're saying that you've got professional expertise in the keeping of\nsecrets, huh? I suppose I could spill it for you, then.\" And I do, explaining my\nlittle hack for tricking the door into thinking that I'd left and returned to\nthe room.\n\n\"Huh -- now that you explain it, it's pretty obvious.\"\n\n\"That's my job -- figuring out the obvious way of doing something.\"\n\nAnd we fall to talking about my job with V/DT, and the discussion branches into\nthe theory and practice of UE, only slowing a little when he picks the crud out\nof the scrape down my jaw and tugs through a couple of quick stitches. It occurs\nto me that he's just keeping me distracted, using a highly evolved skill for\nplacating psychopaths through small talk so that they don't thrash while he's\nknitting their bodies back together.\n\nI decide that I don't care. I get to natter on about a subject that I'm nearly\nautistically fixated on, and I do it in a context where I know that I'm sane and\nsmart and charming and occasionally mind-blowing.\n\n\"...and the whole thing pays for itself through EZPass, where we collect the\npayments for the music downloaded while you're on the road.\" As I finish my\nspiel, I realize *I've* been keeping *him* distracted, standing there with the\ntweezers in one hand and a swab in the other.\n\n\"Wow!\" he said. \"So, when's this all going to happen?\"\n\n\"You'd use it, huh?\"\n\n\"Hell, yeah! I've got a good twenty, thirty thousand on my car right now! You're\nsaying I could plunder anyone else's stereo at will, for free, and keep it,\nwhile I'm stuck in traffic, and because I'm a -- what'd you call it, a\nsuper-peer? -- a super-peer, it's all free and legal? Damn!\"\n\n\"Well, it may be a while before you see it on the East Coast. It'll probably\nroll out in LA first, then San Francisco, Seattle...\"\n\n\"What? Why?\"\n\n\"It's a long story,\" I say. \"And it ends with me on the roof of a goddamned\nnuthouse on Route 128 doing a one-man tribute to the Three Stooges.\"\n\n20.\n\nThree days later, Art finally realized that something big and ugly was in the\noffing. Fede had repeatedly talked him out of going to Perceptronics's offices,\noffering increasingly flimsy excuses and distracting him by calling the hotel's\nfront desk and sending up surprise massage therapists to interrupt Art as he\nstewed in his juices, throbbing with resentment at having been flown thousands\nof klicks while injured in order to check into a faceless hotel on a faceless\nstretch of highway and insert this thumb into his asshole and wait for Fede --\n*who was still in fucking London!* -- to sort out the mess so that he could\npresent himself at the Perceptronics Acton offices and get their guys prepped\nfor the ever-receding meeting with MassPike.\n\n\"Jesus, Federico, what the fuck am I *doing* here?\"\n\n\"I know, Art, I know.\" Art had taken to calling Fede at the extreme ends of\ncircadian compatibility, three AM and eleven PM and then noon on Fede's clock,\nas a subtle means of making the experience just as unpleasant for Fede as it was\nfor Art. \"I screwed up,\" Fede yawned. \"I screwed up and now we're both paying\nthe price. You handled your end beautifully and I dropped mine. And I intend to\nmake it up to you.\"\n\n\"I don't *want* more massages, Fede. I want to get this shit done and I want to\ncome home and see my girlfriend.\"\n\nFede tittered over the phone.\n\n\"What's so funny?\"\n\n\"Nothing much,\" Fede said. \"Just sit tight there for a couple minutes, OK? Call\nme back once it happens and tell me what you wanna do, all right?\"\n\n\"Once what happens?\"\n\n\"You'll know.\"\n\nIt was Linda, of course. Knocking on Art's hotel room door minutes later,\nthrowing her arms -- and then her legs -- around him, and banging him stupid,\nhalf on and half off the hotel room bed. Riding him and then being ridden in\nturns, slurping and wet and energetic until they both lay sprawled on the hotel\nroom's very nice Persian rugs, dehydrated and panting and Art commed Fede, and\nFede told him it could take a couple weeks to sort things out, and why didn't he\nand Linda rent a car and do some sight-seeing on the East Coast?\n\nThat's exactly what they did. Starting in Boston, where they cruised Cambridge,\nwatching the cute nerdyboys and geekygirls wander the streets, having heated\ntechnical debates, lugging half-finished works of technology and art through the\nsopping summertime, a riot of townie accents and highbrow engineerspeak.\n\nThen a week in New York, where they walked until they thought their feet would\ngive out entirely, necks cricked at a permanent, upward-staring angle to gawp at\nthe topless towers of Manhattan. The sound the sound the sound of Manhattan rang\nin their ears, a gray and deep rumble of cars and footfalls and subways and\nsteampipes and sirens and music and conversation and ring tones and hucksters\nand schizophrenic ranters, a veritable Las Vegas of cacophony, and it made Linda\nuncomfortable, she who was raised in the white noise susurrations of LA's\nfreeway forests, but it made Art feel *wonderful*. He kept his comm switched\noff, though the underfoot rumble of the subway had him reaching for it a hundred\ntimes a day, convinced that he'd left it on in vibe-alert mode.\n\nThey took a milk-run train to Toronto, chuffing through sleepy upstate New York\ntowns, past lakes and rolling countryside in full summer glory. Art and Linda\ndrank ginger beer in the observation car, spiking it with rum from a flask that\nLinda carried in a garter that she wore for the express purpose of being able to\nreach naughtily up her little sundress and produce a bottle of body-temperature\nliquor in a nickel-plated vessel whose shiny sides were dulled by the soft oil\nof her thigh.\n\nCanada Customs and Immigration separated them at the border, sending Art for a\nfull inspection -- a privilege of being a Canadian citizen and hence perennially\nunder suspicion of smuggling goods from the tax havens of the US into the\ncountry -- and leaving Linda in their little Pullman cabin.\n\nWhen Art popped free of the bureaucracy, his life thoroughly peered into, he\nfound Linda standing on the platform, leaning against a pillar, back arched, one\nfoot flat against the bricks, corresponding dimpled knee exposed to the restless\nwinds of the trainyard. From Art's point of view, she was a gleaming vision\nskewered on a beam of late day sunlight that made her hair gleam like licorice.\nHer long and lazy jaw caught and lost the sun as she talked animatedly down her\ncomm, and Art was struck with a sudden need to sneak up behind her and run his\ntongue down the line that began with the knob of her mandible under her ear and\nran down to the tiny half-dimple in her chin, to skate it on the soft pouch of\nflesh under her chin, to end with a tasting of her soft lips.\n\nThought became deed. He crept up on her, smelling her new-car hair products on\nthe breeze that wafted back from her, and was about to begin his tonguing when\nshe barked, \"Fuck *off*! Stop calling me!\" and closed her comm and stormed off\ntrainwards, leaving Art standing on the opposite side of the pillar with a\nthoroughly wilted romantic urge.\n\nMore carefully, he followed her into the train, back to their little cabin, and\nreached for the palm-pad to open the door when he heard her agitated comm voice.\n\"No, goddamnit, no. Not yet. Keep calling me and not *ever*, do you understand?\"\n\nArt opened the door. Linda was composed and neat and sweet in her plush seat,\nshoulders back, smile winning. \"Hey honey, did the bad Customs man finally let\nyou go?\"\n\n\"He did! That sounded like a doozy of a phone conversation, though. What's\nwrong?\"\n\n\"You don't want to know,\" she said.\n\n\"All right,\" Art said, sitting down opposite her, knee-to-knee, bending forward\nto plant a kiss on the top of her exposed thigh. \"I don't.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nHe continued to kiss his way up her thigh. \"Only...\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I think I probably do. Curiosity is one of my worst failings of character.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" he said. He'd slid her sundress right up to the waistband of her\ncotton drawers, and now he worried one of the pubic hairs that poked out from\nthe elastic with his teeth.\n\nShe shrieked and pushed him away. \"Someone will see!\" she said. \"This is a\nborder crossing, not a bordello!\"\n\nHe sat back, but inserted a finger in the elastic before Linda straightened out\nher dress, so that his fingertip rested in the crease at the top of her groin.\n\n\"You are *naughty*,\" she said.\n\n\"And curious,\" Art agreed, giving his fingertip a playful wiggle.\n\n\"I give up. That was my fucking ex,\" she said. \"That is how I will refer to him\nhenceforth. 'My fucking ex.' My fucking, pain-in-the-ass, touchy-feely ex. My\nfucking ex, who wants to have the Talk, even though it's been months and months.\nHe's figured out that I'm stateside from my calling times, and he's offering to\ncome out to meet me and really Work Things Out, Once And For All.\"\n\n\"Oh, my,\" Art said.\n\n\"That boy's got too much LA in him for his own good. There's no problem that\ncan't be resolved through sufficient dialog.\"\n\n\"We never really talked about him,\" Art said.\n\n\"Nope, we sure didn't.\"\n\n\"Did you want to talk about him now, Linda?\"\n\n\"'Did you want to talk about him now, Linda?' Why yes, Art, I would. How\nperceptive of you.\" She pushed his hand away and crossed her arms and legs\nsimultaneously.\n\n\"Wait, I'm confused,\" Art said. \"Does that mean you want to talk about him, or\nthat you don't?\"\n\n\"Fine, we'll talk about him. What do you want to know about my fucking ex?\"\n\nArt resisted a terrible urge to fan her fires, to return the vitriol that\ndripped from her voice. \"Look, you don't want to talk about him, we won't talk\nabout him,\" he managed.\n\n\"No, let's talk about my fucking ex, by all means.\" She adopted a singsong tone\nand started ticking off points on her fingers. \"His name is Toby, he's\nhalf-Japanese, half-white. He's about your height. Your dick is bigger, but he's\nbetter in bed. He's a user-experience designer at Lucas-SGI, in Studio City. He\nnever fucking shuts up about what's wrong with this or that. We dated for two\nyears, lived together for one year, and broke up just before you and I met. I\nbroke it off with him: He was making me goddamned crazy and he wanted me to come\nback from London and live with him. I wanted to stay out the year in England and\ngo back to my own apartment and possibly a different boyfriend, and he made me\nchoose, so I chose. Is that enough of a briefing for you, Arthur?\"\n\n\"That was fine,\" Art said. Linda's face had gone rabid purple, madly pinched,\nspittle flecking off of her lips as she spat out the words. \"Thank you.\"\n\nShe took his hands and kissed the knuckles of his thumbs. \"Look, I don't like to\ntalk about it -- it's painful. I'm sorry he's ruining our holiday. I just won't\ntake his calls anymore, how about that?\"\n\n\"I don't care, Linda, Honestly, I don't give a rat's ass if you want to chat\nwith your ex. I just saw how upset you were and I thought it might help if you\ncould talk it over with me.\"\n\n\"I know, baby, I know. But I just need to work some things out all on my own.\nMaybe I will take a quick trip out west and talk things over with him. You could\ncome if you want -- there are some wicked bars in West Hollywood.\"\n\n\"That's OK,\" Art said, whipsawed by Linda's incomprehensible mood shifts. \"But\nif you need to go, go. I've got plenty of old pals to hang out with in Toronto.\"\n\n\"You're so understanding,\" she cooed. \"Tell me about your grandmother again --\nyou're sure she'll like me?\"\n\n\"She'll love you. She loves anything that's female, of childbearing years, and\nin my company. She has great and unrealistic hopes of great-grandchildren.\"\n\n\"Cluck.\"\n\n\"Cluck?\"\n\n\"Just practicing my brood-hen.\"\n\n21.\n\nDoc Szandor's a good egg. He's keeping the shrinks at bay, spending more time\nwith me than is strictly necessary. I hope he isn't neglecting his patients, but\nit's been so long since I had a normal conversation, I just can't bear to give\nit up. Besides, I get the impression that Szandor's in a similar pit of bad\nconversation with psychopaths and psychotherapists and is relieved to have a bit\nof a natter with someone who isn't either having hallucinations or attempting to\nprevent them in others.\n\n\"How the hell do you become a user-experience guy?\"\n\n\"Sheer orneriness,\" I say, grinning. \"I was just in the right place at the right\ntime. I had a pal in New York who was working for a biotech company that had\nmade this artificial erectile tissue.\"\n\n\"Erectile tissue?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Synthetic turtle penis. Small and pliable and capable of going large and\nrigid very quickly.\"\n\n\"Sounds delightful.\"\n\n\"Oh, it was actually pretty cool. You know the joke about the circumcisionist's\nwallet made from foreskins?\"\n\n\"Sure, I heard it premed -- he rubs it and it becomes a suitcase, right?\"\n\n\"That's the one. So these guys were thinking about making drawbridges, temporary\nshelters, that kind of thing out of it. They even had a cute name for it:\n'Ardorite.'\"\n\n\"Ho ho ho.\"\n\n\"Yeah. So they weren't shipping a whole lot of product, to put it mildly. Then I\nspent a couple of weeks in Manhattan housesitting for my friend while he was\nvisiting his folks in Wisconsin for Thanksgiving. He had a ton of this stuff\nlying around his apartment, and I would come back after walking the soles off my\nshoes and sit in front of the tube playing with it. I took some of it down to\nMadison Square Park and played with it there. I liked to hang out there because\nit was always full of these very cute Icelandic *au pairs* and their tots, and I\nwas a respectable enough young man with about 200 words of Icelandic I'd learned\nfrom a friend's mom in high school and they thought I was adorable and I thought\nthey were blond goddesses. I'd gotten to be friends with one named Marta, oh,\nMarta. Bookmark Marta, Szandor, and I'll come back to her once we're better\nacquainted.\n\n\"Anyway, Marta was in charge of Machinery and Avarice, the spoiled monsterkinder\nof a couple of BBD&O senior managers who'd vaulted from art school to VPdom in\none year when most of the gray eminences got power-thraxed. Machinery was three\nand liked to bang things against other things arythmically while hollering\natonally. Avarice was five, not toilet trained, and prone to tripping. I'd get\nMarta novelty coffee from the Stinkbucks on Twenty-third and we'd drink it\ntogether while Machinery and Avarice engaged in terrible, life-threatening play\nwith the other kids in the park.\n\n\"I showed Marta what I had, though I was tactful enough not to call it\n*synthetic turtle penis*, because while Marta was earthy, she wasn't *that*\nearthy and, truth be told, it got me kinda hot to watch her long, pale blue\nfingers fondling the soft tissue, then triggering the circuit that hardened it.\n\n\"Then Machinery comes over and snatches the thing away from Marta and starts\npounding on Avarice, taking unholy glee in the way the stuff alternately\nsoftened and stiffened as he squeezed it. Avarice wrestled it away from him and\ntore off for a knot of kids and by the time I got there they were all crowded\naround her, spellbound. I caught a cab back to my buddy's apartment and grabbed\nall the Ardorite I could lay hands on and brought it back to the park and spent\nthe next couple hours running an impromptu focus group, watching the kids and\ntheir bombshell nannies play with it. By the time that Marta touched my hand\nwith her long cool fingers and told me it was time for her to get the kids home\nfor their nap, I had twenty-five toy ideas, about eight different ways to use\nthe stuff for clothing fasteners, and a couple of miscellaneous utility uses,\nlike a portable crib.\n\n\"So I ran it down for my pal that afternoon over the phone, and he commed his\nboss and I ended up eating Thanksgiving dinner at his boss's house in\nWestchester.\"\n\n\"Weren't you worried he'd rip off your ideas and not pay you anything for them?\"\nSzandor's spellbound by the story, unconsciously unrolling and re-rolling an Ace\nbandage.\n\n\"Didn't even cross my mind. Of course, he tried to do just that, but it wasn't\nany good -- they were engineers; they had no idea how normal human beings\ninteract with their environments. The stuff wasn't self-revealing -- they added\na million cool features and a manual an inch thick. After prototyping for six\nmonths, they called me in and offered me a two-percent royalty on any products I\ndesigned for them.\"\n\n\"That musta been worth a fortune,\" says Szandor.\n\n\"You'd think so, wouldn't you? Actually, they folded before they shipped\nanything. Blew through all their capital on R&D, didn't have anything left to\nproductize their tech with. But my buddy *did* get another gig with a company\nthat was working on new kitchen stuff made from one-way osmotic materials and he\nshowed them the stuff I'd done with the Ardorite and all of a sudden I had a\nno-fooling career.\"\n\n\"Damn, that's cool.\"\n\n\"You betcha. It's all about being an advocate for the user. I observe what users\ndo and how they do it, figure out what they're trying to do, and then boss the\nengineers around, getting them to remove the barriers they've erected because\nengineers are all basically high-functioning autistics who have no idea how\nnormal people do stuff.\"\n\nThe doctor chuckles. \"Look,\" he says, producing a nicotine pacifier, one of\nthose fake cigs that gives you the oral fix and the chemical fix and the habit\nfix without the noxious smoke, \"it's not my area of specialty, but you seem like\na basically sane individual, modulo your rooftop adventures. Certainly, you're\nnot like most of the people we've got here. What are you doing here?\"\n\nDoctor Szandor is young, younger even than me, I realize. Maybe twenty-six. I\ncan see some fancy tattoo-work poking out of the collar of his shirt, see some\ntelltale remnant of a fashionable haircut in his grown-out shag. He's got to be\nthe youngest staff member I've met here, and he's got a fundamentally different\naffect from the zombies in the lab coats who maintain the zombies in the felt\nslippers.\n\nSo I tell him my story, the highlights, anyway. The more I tell him about Linda\nand Fede, the dumber my own actions sound to me.\n\n\"Why the hell did you stick with this Linda anyway?\" Szandor says, sucking on\nhis pacifier.\n\n\"The usual reasons, I guess,\" I say, squirming.\n\n\"Lemme tell you something,\" he says. He's got his feet up on the table now,\nhands laced behind his neck. \"It's the smartest thing my dad ever said to me,\njust as my high-school girl and me were breaking up before I went away to med\nschool. She was nice enough, but, you know, *unstable.* I'd gotten to the point\nwhere I ducked and ran for cover every time she disagreed with me, ready for her\nto lose her shit.\n\n\"So my dad took me aside, put his arm around me, and said, 'Szandor, you know I\nlike that girlfriend of yours, but she is crazy. Not a little crazy, really\ncrazy. Maybe she won't be crazy forever, but if she gets better, it won't be\nbecause of you. Trust me, I know this. You can't fuck a crazy girl sane, son.'\"\n\nI can't help smiling. \"Truer words,\" I say. \"But harsh.\"\n\n\"Harsh is relative,\" he says. \"Contrast it with, say, getting someone committed\non trumped-up evidence.\"\n\nIt dawns on me that Doc Szandor believes me. \"It dawns on me that you believe\nme.\"\n\nHe gnaws fitfully at his pacifier. \"Well, why not? You're not any crazier than I\nam, that much is clear to me. You have neat ideas. Your story's plausible\nenough.\"\n\nI get excited. \"Is this your *professional* opinion?\"\n\n\"Sorry, no. I am not a mental health professional, so I don't have professional\nopinions on your mental health. It is, however, my amateur opinion.\"\n\n\"Oh, well.\"\n\n\"So where are you at now, vis-a-vis the hospital?\"\n\n\"Well, they don't tell me much, but as near as I can make out, I am stuck here\nsemipermanently. The court found me incompetent and ordered me held until I was.\nI can't get anyone to explain what competency consists of, or how I achieve it\n-- when I try, I get accused of being 'difficult.' Of course, escaping onto the\nroof is a little beyond difficult. I have a feeling I'm going to be in pretty\ndeep shit. Do they know about the car?\"\n\n\"The car?\"\n\n\"In the parking lot. The one that blew up.\"\n\nDoc Szandor laughs hard enough that his pacifier shoots across the room and\nlands in a hazmat bucket. \"You son of a bitch -- that was you?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I say, and drum my feet against the tin cupboards under the examination\ntable.\n\n\"That was *my fucking car*!\"\n\n\"Oh, Christ, I'm sorry,\" I say. \"God.\"\n\n\"No no no,\" he says, fishing in his pocket and unwrapping a fresh pacifier.\n\"It's OK. Insurance. I'm getting a bike. Vroom, vroom! What a coincidence,\nthough,\" he says.\n\nCoincidence. He's making disgusting hamster-cage noises, grinding away at his\npacifier. \"Szandor, do you sometimes sneak out onto the landing to have a\ncigarette? Use a bit of tinfoil for your ashtray? Prop the door open behind\nyou?\"\n\n\"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"'Cause that's how I got out onto the roof.\"\n\n\"Oh, shit,\" he says.\n\n\"It's our secret,\" I say. \"I can tell them I don't know how I got out. I'm\nincompetent, remember?\"\n\n\"You're a good egg, Art,\" he says. \"How the hell are we going to get you out of\nhere?\"\n\n\"Hey what?\"\n\n\"No, really. There's no good reason for you to be here, right? You're occupying\nvaluable bed space.\"\n\n\"Well, I appreciate the sentiment, but I have a feeling that as soon as you turn\nme loose, I'm gonna be doped up to the tits for a good long while.\"\n\nHe grimaces. \"Right, right. They like their meds. Are your parents alive?\"\n\n\"What? No, they're both dead.\"\n\n\"Aha. Died suddenly?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Dad drowned, Mom fell --\"\n\n\"Ah ah ah! Shhh. Mom died suddenly. She was taking Haldol when it happened, a\nlow antianxiety dose, right?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Probably she was. Probably she had a terrible drug interaction. Sudden Death\nSyndrome. It's hereditary. And you say she fell? Seizure. We'll sign you up for\na PET scan, that'll take at least a month to set up. You could be an epileptic\nand not even know it. Shaking the radioisotopes loose for the scan from the AEC,\nwoah, that's a week's worth of paperwork right there! No Thorazine for you young\nman, not until we're absolutely sure it won't kill you dead where you stand. The\nhospital counsel gave us all a very stern lecture on this very subject not a\nmonth ago. I'll just make some notes in your medical history.\" He picked up his\ncomm and scribbled.\n\n\"Never woulda thought of that,\" I say. \"I'm impressed.\"\n\n\"It's something I've been playing with for a while now. I think that psychiatric\ncare is a good thing, of course, but it could be better implemented. Taking away\nprescription pads would be a good start.\"\n\n\"Or you could keep public stats on which doctors had prescribed how much of what\nand how often. Put 'em on a chart in the ward where the patients' families could\nsee 'em.\"\n\n\"That's *nasty*!\" he says. \"I love it. We're supposed to be accountable, right?\nWhat else?\"\n\n\"Give the patients a good reason to wear their tracking bracelets: redesign them\nso they gather stats on mobility and vitals and track them against your meds and\nother therapies. Create a dating service that automatically links patients who\nrespond similarly to therapies so they can compare notes. Ooh, by comparing with\nlocation data from other trackers, you could get stats on which therapies make\npeople more sociable, just by counting the frequency with which patients stop\nand spend time in proximity to other patients. It'd give you empirical data with\nwhich you track your own progress.\"\n\n\"This is great stuff. Damn! How do you do that?\"\n\nI feel a familiar swelling of pride. I like it when people understand how good I\nam at my job. Working at V/DT was hard on my ego: after all, my job there was to\ndo a perfectly rotten job, to design the worst user experiences that\nplausibility would allow. God, did I really do that for two whole goddamned\nyears?\n\n\"It's my job,\" I say, and give a modest shrug.\n\n\"What do you charge for work like that?\"\n\n\"Why, are you in the market?\"\n\n\"Who knows? Maybe after I figure out how to spring you, we can go into biz\ntogether, redesigning nuthatches.\"\n\n22.\n\nLinda's first meeting with Art's Gran went off without a hitch. Gran met them at\nUnion Station with an obsolete red cap who was as ancient as she was, a vestige\nof a more genteel era of train travel and bulky luggage. Just seeing him made\nArt's brain whir with plans for conveyor systems, luggage escalators, cart\ndispensers. They barely had enough luggage between the two of them to make it\nworth the old man's time, but he dutifully marked their bags with a stub of\nchalk and hauled them onto his cart, then trundled off to the service elevators.\n\nGran gave Art a long and teary hug. She was less frail than she'd been in his\nmemory, taller and sturdier. The smell of her powder and the familiar acoustics\nof Union Station's cavernous platform whirled him back to his childhood in\nToronto, to the homey time before he'd gotten on the circadian merry-go-round.\n\n\"Gran, this is Linda,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, it's so *nice* to meet you,\" Gran said, taking Linda's hands in hers. \"Call\nme Julie.\"\n\nLinda smiled a great, pretty, toothy smile. \"Julie, Art's told me all about you.\nI just *know* we'll be great friends.\"\n\n\"I'm sure we will. Are you hungry? Did they feed you on the train? You must be\nexhausted after such a long trip. Which would you rather do first, eat or rest?\"\n\n\"Well, *I'm* up for seeing the town,\" Linda said. \"Your grandson's been yawning\nhis head off since Buffalo, though.\" She put her arm around his waist and\nsqueezed his tummy.\n\n\"What a fantastic couple you make,\" Gran said. \"You didn't tell me she was so\n*pretty*, Arthur!\"\n\n\"Here it comes,\" Art said. \"She's going to ask about great-grandchildren.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" Gran said, cuffing him gently upside the head. \"You're always\nexaggerating.\"\n\n\"Well *I* think it's a splendid idea,\" Linda said. \"Shall we have two? Three?\nFour?\"\n\n\"Make it ten,\" Art said, kissing her cheek.\n\n\"Oh, I couldn't have ten,\" Linda said. \"But five is a nice compromise. Five it\nwill be. We'll name the first one Julie if it's a girl, or Julius if it's a\nboy.\"\n\n\"Oh, we *are* going to get along,\" Gran said, and led them up to the curb, where\nthe red cap had loaded their bags into a cab.\n\nThey ate dinner at Lindy's on Yonge Street, right in the middle of the sleaze\nstrip. The steakhouse had been there for the better part of a century, and its\ncracked red-vinyl booths and thick rib eyes smothered in horseradish and HP\nSauce were just as Art had remembered. Riding up Yonge Street, the city lights\nhad seemed charming and understated; even the porn marquees felt restrained\nafter a week in New York. Art ate a steak as big as his head and fell into a\npostprandial torpor whence he emerged only briefly to essay a satisfied belch.\nMeanwhile, Gran and Linda nattered away like old friends, making plans for the\nweek: the zoo, the island, a day trip to Niagara Falls, a ride up the CN Tower,\nall the touristy stuff that Art had last done in elementary school.\n\nBy the time Art lay down in his bed, belly tight with undigested steak, he was\nfeeling wonderful and at peace with the world. Linda climbed in beside him,\nwrestled away a pillow and some covers, and snuggled up to him.\n\n\"That went well,\" Art said. \"I'm really glad you two hit it off.\"\n\n\"Me too, honey,\" Linda said, kissing his shoulder through his tee shirt. He'd\nbeen able to get his head around the idea of sharing a bed with his girlfriend\nunder his grandmother's roof, but doing so nude seemed somehow wrong.\n\n\"We're going to have a great week,\" he said. \"I wish it would never end.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" she said, and began to snore into his neck.\n\nThe next morning, Art woke stiff and serene. He stretched out on the bed, dimly\nnoted Linda's absence, and padded to the bathroom to relieve his bladder. He\nthought about crawling back into bed, was on the verge of doing so, when he\nheard the familiar, nervewracking harangue of Linda arguing down her comm. He\nopened the door to his old bedroom and there she was, stark naked and beautiful\nin the morning sun, comm in hand, eyes focused in the middle distance, shouting.\n\n\"No, goddamnit, no! Not here. Jesus, are you a moron? I said *no*!\"\n\nArt reached out to touch her back, noticed that it was trembling, visibly tense\nand rigid, and pulled his hand back. Instead, he quietly set about fishing in\nhis small bag for a change of clothes.\n\n\"This is *not* a good time. I'm at Art's grandmother's place, all right? I'll\ntalk to you later.\" She threw her comm at the bed and whirled around.\n\n\"Everything all right?\" Art said timidly.\n\n\"No, goddamnit, no it isn't.\"\n\nArt pulled on his pants and kept his eyes on her comm, which was dented and\nscratched from a hundred thousand angry hang ups. He hated it when she got like\nthis, radiating anger and spoiling for a fight.\n\n\"I'm going to have to go, I think,\" she said.\n\n\"Go?\"\n\n\"To California. That was my fucking ex again. I need to go and sort things out\nwith him.\"\n\n\"Your ex knows who I am?\"\n\nShe looked blank.\n\n\"You told him you were at my grandmother's place. He knows who I am?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" she said. \"He does. I told him, so he'd get off my back.\"\n\n\"And you have to go to California?\"\n\n\"Today. I have to go to California today.\"\n\n\"Jesus, today? We just got here!\"\n\n\"Look, you've got lots of catching up to do with your Gran and your friends\nhere. You won't even miss me. I'll go for a couple days and then come back.\"\n\n\"If you gotta go,\" he said.\n\n\"I gotta go.\"\n\nHe explained things as best as he could to Gran while Linda repacked her\nbackpack, and then saw Linda off in a taxi. She was already savaging her comm,\nbooking a ticket to LA. He called Fede from the condo's driveway.\n\n\"Hey, Art! How's Toronto?\"\n\n\"How'd you know I was in Toronto?\" Art said, but he knew, he *knew* then, though\nhe couldn't explain how he knew, he knew that Linda and Fede had been talking.\nHe *knew* that Linda had been talking to Fede that morning, and not her fucking\nex (God, he was thinking of the poor schmuck that way already, \"fucking ex\").\nChrist, it was *five in the morning* on the West Coast. It couldn't be the ex.\nHe just knew.\n\n\"Lucky guess,\" Fede said breezily. \"How is it?\"\n\n\"Oh, terrific. Great to see the old hometown and all. How're things with\nPerceptronics? When should I plan on being back in Boston?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's going all right, but slow. Hurry up and wait, right? Look, don't worry\nabout it, just relax there, I'll call you when the deal's ready and you'll go\nback to Boston and we'll sort it out and it'll all be fantastic and don't worry,\nreally, all right?\"\n\n\"Fine, Fede.\" Art wasn't listening any more. Fede had gone into bullshit mode,\nand all Art was thinking of was why Linda would talk to Fede and then book a\nflight to LA. \"How're things in London?\" he said automatically.\n\n\"Fine, fine,\" Fede said, just as automatically. \"Not the same without you, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Art said. \"Well, bye then.\"\n\n\"Bye,\" Fede said.\n\nArt felt an unsuspected cunning stirring within him. He commed Linda, in her\ncab. \"Hey, dude,\" he said.\n\n\"Hey,\" she said, sounding harassed.\n\n\"Look, I just spoke to my Gran and she's really upset you had to go. She really\nliked you.\"\n\n\"Well, I liked her, too.\"\n\n\"Great. Here's the thing,\" he said, and drew in a breath. \"Gran made you a\nsweater. She made me one, too. She's a knitter. She wanted me to send it along\nafter you. It looks pretty good. So, if you give me your ex's address, I can\nFedEx it there and you can get it.\"\n\nThere was a lengthy pause. \"Why don't I just pick it up when I see you again?\"\nLinda said, finally.\n\n*Gotcha*, Art thought. \"Well, I know that'd be the *sensible* thing, but my\nGran, I dunno, she really wants me to do this. It'd make her so happy.\"\n\n\"I dunno -- my ex might cut it up or something.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure he wouldn't do that. I could just schedule the delivery for after\nyou arrive, that way you can sign for it. What do you think?\"\n\n\"I really don't think --\"\n\n\"Come on, Linda, I know it's nuts, but it's my Gran. She *really* likes you.\"\n\nLinda sighed. \"Let me comm you the address, OK?\"\n\n\"Thanks, Linda,\" Art said, watching the address in Van Nuys scroll onto his\ncomm's screen. \"Thanks a bunch. Have a great trip -- don't let your ex get you\ndown.\"\n\nNow, armed with Linda's fucking ex's name, Art went to work. He told Gran he had\nsome administrative chores to catch up on for an hour or two, promised to have\nsupper with her and Father Ferlenghetti that night, and went out onto the\ncondo's sundeck with his keyboard velcroed to his thigh.\n\nTrepan: Hey!\n\nColonelonic: Trepan! Hey, what's up? I hear you're back on the East Coast!\n\nTrepan: True enough. Back in Toronto. How's things with you?\n\nColonelonic: Same as ever. Trying to quit the dayjob.\n\nTrepan: /private Colonelonic Are you still working at Merril-Lynch?\n\n## Colonelonic (private): Yeah.\n\nTrepan: /private Colonelonic Still got access to Lexus-Nexus?\n\n## Colonelonic (private): Sure -- but they're on our asses about abusing the\naccounts.

I think she's\nscrewing this guy. I just wanna get an idea of who he is, what he does, you\nknow.\n\n## Colonelonic (private): Heh. That sucks. OK -- check back in a couple hours.\nThere's a guy across the hall who never logs out of his box when he goes to\nlunch. I'll sneak in there and look it up on his machine.\n\nTrepan: /private Colonelonic Kick ass. Thanks.\n\n##Transferring addressbook entry \"Toby Ginsburg\" to Colonelonic. Receipt\nconfirmed.\n\nTrepan: /private Colonelonic Thanks again!\n\n## Colonelonic (private): Check in with me later -- I'll have something for you\nthen.\n\nArt logged off, flushed with triumph. Whatever Fede and Linda were cooking up,\nhe'd get wise to it and then he'd nail 'em. What the hell was it, though?\n\n23.\n\nMy cousins visited me a week after I arrived at the nuthouse. I'd never been\nvery close to them, and certainly our relationship had hardly blossomed during\nthe week I spent in Toronto, trying to track down Linda and Fede's plot.\n\nI have two cousins. They're my father's sister's kids, and I didn't even meet\nthem until I was about twenty and tracking down my family history. They're\nOttawa Valley kids, raised on government-town pork, aging hippie muesli, and\ncountry-style corn pone. It's a weird mix, and we've never had a conversation\nthat I would consider a success. Ever met a violent, aggressive hippie with an\nintimate knowledge of whose genitals one must masticate in order to get a\nbuilding permit or to make a pot bust vanish? It ain't pretty.\n\nCousin the first is Audie. She's a year older than me, and she's the smart one\non that side of the family, the one who ended up at Queen's University for a BS\nin Electrical Engineering and an MA in Poli Sci, and even so finished up back in\nOttawa, freelancing advice to clueless MPs dealing with Taiwanese and Sierra\nLeonese OEM importers. Audie's married to a nice fella whose name I can never\nremember and they're gonna have kids in five years; it's on a timetable that she\nactually showed me once when I went out there on biz and stopped in to see her\nat the office.\n\nCousin the second is Alphie -- three years younger than me, raised in the shadow\nof his overachieving sister, he was the capo of Ottawa Valley script kiddies, a\nlow-rent hacker who downloaded other people's code for defeating copyright\nuse-control systems and made a little biz for himself bootlegging games, porn,\nmusic and video, until the WIPO bots found him through traffic analysis and\nbusted his ass, bankrupting him and landing him in the clink for sixty days.\n\nAudie and Alfie are blond and ruddy and a little heavyset, all characteristics\nthey got from their father's side, so add that to the fact that I grew up\nwithout being aware of their existence and you'll understand the absence of any\nreal fellow-feeling for them. I don't dislike them, but I have so little in\ncommon with them that it's like hanging out with time travelers from the\nleast-interesting historical era imaginable.\n\nBut they came to Boston and looked me up in the nuthatch.\n\nThey found me sitting on the sofa in the ward, post-Group, arms and ankles\ncrossed, dozing in a shaft of sunlight. It was my habitual napping spot, and I\nfound that a nap between Group and dinner was a good way to sharpen my appetite\nand anasthetize my taste buds, which made the mealtime slop bearable.\n\nAudie shook my shoulder gently. I assumed at first that she was one of the\ninmates trying to get me involved in a game of Martian narco-checkers, so I\nbrushed her hand away.\n\n\"They've probably got him all doped up,\" Audie said. The voice was familiar and\nunplaceable and so I cracked my eyelid, squinting up at her silhouette in the\nafternoon sun. \"There he is,\" she said. \"Come on, up and at 'em, tiger.\"\n\nI sat up abruptly and scrubbed at my eyes. \"Audie?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yup. And Alphie.\" Alphie's pink face hove into view.\n\n\"Hi, Art,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"Jesus,\" I said, getting to my feet. Audie put out a superfluous steadying hand.\n\"Wow.\"\n\n\"Surprised?\" Audie said.\n\n\"Yeah!\" I said. Audie thrust a bouquet of flowers into my arms. \"What are you\ndoing here?\"\n\n\"Oh, your grandmother told me you were here. I was coming down to Boston for\nwork anyway, so I flew in a day early so I could drop in. Alphie came down with\nme -- he's my assistant now.\"\n\nI almost said something about convicted felons working for government\ncontractors, but I held onto my tongue. Consequently, an awkward silence\nblossomed.\n\n\"Well,\" Audie said, at last. \"Well! Let's have a look at you, then.\" She\nactually took a lap around me, looking me up and down, making little noises.\n\"You look all right, Art. Maybe a little skinny, even. Alphie's got a box of\ncookies for you.\" Alphie stepped forward and produced the box, a family pack of\nPresident's Choice Ridiculous Chocoholic Extra Chewies, a Canadian store brand\nI'd been raised on. Within seconds of seeing them, my mouth was sloshing with\nsaliva.\n\n\"It's good to see you, Audie, Alphie.\" I managed to say it without spitting, an\nimpressive feat, given the amount of saliva I was contending with. \"Thanks for\nthe care package.\"\n\nWe stared at each other blankly.\n\n\"So, Art,\" Alphie said, \"So! How do you like it here?\"\n\n\"Well, Alphie,\" I said. \"I can't say as I do, really. As far as I can tell, I'm\nsane as I've ever been. It's just a bunch of unfortunate coincidences and bad\njudgment that got me here.\" I refrain from mentioning Alphie's propensity for\nlapses in judgment.\n\n\"Wow,\" Alphie said. \"That's a bummer. We should do something, you know, Audie?\"\n\n\"Not really my area of expertise,\" Audie said in clipped tones. \"I would if I\ncould, you know that, right Art? We're family, after all.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" I say magnanimously. But now that I'm looking at them, my cousins\nwho got into a thousand times more trouble than I ever did, driving drunk,\npirating software, growing naughty smokables in the backyard, and got away from\nit unscathed, I feel a stirring of desperate hope. \"Only...\"\n\n\"Only what?\" Alphie said.\n\n\"Only, maybe, Audie, do you think you could, that is, if you've got the time, do\nyou think you could have a little look around and see if any of your contacts\ncould maybe set me up with a decent lawyer who might be able to get my case\nreheard? Or a shrink, for that matter? Something? 'Cause frankly it doesn't\nreally seem like they're going to let me go, ever. Ever.\"\n\nAudie squirmed and glared at her brother. \"I don't really know anyone that fits\nthe bill,\" she said at last.\n\n\"Well, not *firsthand,* sure, why would you? You wouldn't.\" I thought that I was\nstarting to babble, but I couldn't help myself. \"You wouldn't. But maybe there's\nsomeone that someone you know knows who can do something about it? I mean, it\ncan't hurt to ask around, can it?\"\n\n\"I suppose it can't,\" she said.\n\n\"Wow,\" I said, \"that would just be fantastic, you know. Thanks in advance,\nAudie, really, I mean it, just for trying, I can't thank you enough. This place,\nwell, it really sucks.\"\n\nThere it was, hanging out, my desperate and pathetic plea for help. Really,\nthere was nowhere to go but down from there. Still, the silence stretched and\nsnapped and I said, \"Hey, speaking of, can I offer you guys a tour of the ward?\nI mean, it's not much, but it's home.\"\n\nSo I showed them: the droolers and the fondlers and the pukers and my horrible\nlittle room and the scarred ping-pong table and the sticky decks of cards and\nthe meshed-in TV. Alphie actually seemed to dig it, in a kind of horrified way.\nHe started comparing it to the new Kingston Pen, where he'd done his six-month\nbit. After seeing the first puker, Audie went quiet and thin-lipped, leaving\nnothing but Alphie's enthusiastic gurgling as counterpoint to my tour.\n\n\"Art,\" Audie said finally, desperately, \"do you think they'd let us take you out\nfor a cup of coffee or a walk around the grounds?\"\n\nI asked. The nurse looked at a comm for a while, then shook her head.\n\n\"Nope,\" I reported. \"They need a day's notice of off-ward supervised\nexcursions.\"\n\n\"Well, too bad,\" Audie said. I understood her strategy immediately. \"Too bad.\nNothing for it, then. Guess we should get back to our hotel.\" I planted a dry\nkiss on her cheek, shook Alphie's sweaty hand, and they were gone. I skipped\nsupper that night and ate cookies until I couldn't eat another bite of rich\nchocolate.\n\n#\n\n\"Got a comm?\" I ask Doc Szandor, casually.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Wanna get some of this down. The ideas for the hospital. Before I go back out\non the ward.\" And it *is* what I want to do, mostly. But the temptation to just\nlog on and do my thing -- oh!\n\n\"Sure,\" he says, checking his watch. \"I can probably stall them for a couple\nhours more. Feel free to make a call or whatever, too.\"\n\nDoc Szandor's a good egg.\n\n24.\n\nFather Ferlenghetti showed up at Art's Gran's at 7PM, just as the sun began to\nset over the lake, and Art and he shared lemonade on Gran's sunporch and watched\nas the waves on Lake Ontario turned harshly golden.\n\n\"So, Arthur, tell me, what are you doing with your life?\" the Father said. He\nhad grown exquisitely aged, almost translucent, since Art had seen him last. In\nhis dog collar and old-fashioned aviator's shades, he looked like a waxworks\nfigure.\n\nArt had forgotten all about the Father's visit until Gran stepped out of her\nsuperheated kitchen to remind him. He'd hastily showered and changed into fresh\nslacks and a mostly clean tee shirt, and had agreed to entertain the priest\nwhile his Gran finished cooking supper. Now, he wished he'd signed up to do the\ncooking.\n\n\"I'm working in London,\" he said. \"The same work as ever, but for an English\nfirm.\"\n\n\"That's what your grandmother tells me. But is it making you happy? Is it what\nyou plan to do with the rest of your life?\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" Art said. \"Sure.\"\n\n\"You don't sound so sure,\" Father Ferlenghetti said.\n\n\"Well, the *work* part's excellent. The politics are pretty ugly, though, to\ntell the truth.\"\n\n\"Ah. Well, we can't avoid politics, can we?\"\n\n\"No, I guess we can't.\"\n\n\"Art, I've always known that you were a very smart young man, but being smart\nisn't the same as being happy. If you're very lucky, you'll get to be my age and\nyou'll look back on your life and be glad you lived it.\"\n\nGran called him in for dinner before he could think of a reply. He settled down\nat the table and Gran handed him a pen.\n\n\"What's this for?\" he asked.\n\n\"Sign the tablecloth,\" she said. \"Write a little something and sign it and date\nit, nice and clear, please.\"\n\n\"Sign the tablecloth?\"\n\n\"Yes. I've just started a fresh one. I have everyone sign my tablecloth and then\nI embroider the signatures in, so I have a record of everyone who's been here\nfor supper. They'll make a nice heirloom for your children -- I'll show you the\nold ones after we eat.\"\n\n\"What should I write?\"\n\n\"It's up to you.\"\n\nWhile Gran and the Father looked on, Art uncapped the felt-tip pen and thought\nand thought, his mind blank. Finally, he wrote, \"For my Gran. No matter where I\nam, I know you're thinking of me.\" He signed it with a flourish.\n\n\"Lovely. Let's eat now.\"\n\nArt meant to log in and see if Colonelonic had dredged up any intel on Linda's\nex, but he found himself trapped on the sunporch with Gran and the Father and a\nsmall stack of linen tablecloths hairy with embroidered wishes. He traced their\nbraille with his fingertips, recognizing the names of his childhood. Gran and\nthe Father talked late into the night, and the next thing Art knew, Gran was\nshaking him awake. He was draped in a tablecloth that he'd pulled over himself\nlike a blanket, and she folded it and put it away while he ungummed his eyes and\nstaggered off to bed.\n\nAudie called him early the next morning, waking him up.\n\n\"Hey, Art! It's your cousin!\"\n\n\"Audie?\"\n\n\"You don't have any other female cousins, so yes, that's a good guess. Your Gran\ntold me you were in Canada for a change.\"\n\n\"Yup, I am. Just for a little holiday.\"\n\n\"Well, it's been long enough. What do you do in London again?\"\n\n\"I'm a consultant for Virgin/Deutsche Telekom.\" He has this part of the\nconversation every time he speaks with Audie. Somehow, the particulars of his\njob just couldn't seem to stick in her mind.\n\n\"What kind of consultant?\"\n\n\"User experience. I help design their interactive stuff. How's Ottawa?\"\n\n\"They pay you for that, huh? Well, nice work if you can get it.\"\n\nArt believed that Audie was being sincere in her amazement at his niche in the\nworking world, and not sneering at all. Still, he had to keep himself from\nsaying something snide about the lack of tangible good resulting from keeping\nMPs up to date on the poleconomy of semiconductor production in PacRim\nsweatshops.\n\n\"They sure do. How's Ottawa?\"\n\n\"Amazing. And why London? Can't you find work at home?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I suppose I could. This just seemed like a good job at the time. How's\nOttawa?\n\n\"Seemed, huh? You going to be moving back, then? Quitting?\"\n\n\"Not anytime soon. How's Ottawa?\"\n\n\"Ottawa? It's beautiful this time of year. Alphie and Enoch and I were going to\ngo to the trailer for the weekend, in Calabogie. You could drive up and meet us.\nSwim, hike. We've built a sweatlodge near the dock; you and Alphie could bake up\ntogether.\"\n\n\"Wow,\" Art said, wishing he had Audie's gift for changing the subject. \"Sounds\ngreat. But. Well, you know. Gotta catch up with friends here in Toronto. It's\nbeen a while, you know. Well.\" The image of sharing a smoke-filled dome with\nAlphie's naked, cross-legged, sweat-slimed paunch had seared itself across his\nwaking mind.\n\n\"No? Geez. Too bad. I'd really hoped that we could reconnect, you and me and\nAlphie. We really should spend some more time together, keep connected, you\nknow?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Art said. \"Sure. Yes.\" Relations or no, Audie and Alphie were basically\nstrangers to him, and it was beyond him why Audie thought they should be\nspending time together, but there it was. *Reconnect, keep connected.* Hippies.\n\"We should. Next time I'm in Canada, for sure, we'll get together, I'll come to\nOttawa. Maybe Christmas. Skating on the canal, OK?\"\n\n\"Very good,\" Audie said. \"I'll pencil you in for Christmas week. Here, I'll send\nyou the wish lists for Alphie and Enoch and me, so you'll know what to get.\"\n\nXmas wishlists in July. Organized hippies! What planet did his cousins grow up\non, anyway?\n\n\"Thanks, Audie. I'll put together a wishlist and pass it along to you soon, OK?\"\nHis bladder nagged at him. \"I gotta run now, all right?\"\n\n\"Great. Listen, Art, it's been, well, great to talk to you again. It really\nmakes me feel whole to connect with you. Don't be a stranger, all right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, OK! Nice to talk to you, too. Bye!\"\n\n\"Safe travels and wishes fulfilled,\" Audie said.\n\n\"You too!\"\n\n25.\n\nNow I've got a comm, I hardly know what to do with it. Call Gran? Call Audie?\nCall Fede? Login to an EST chat and see who's up to what?\n\nHow about the Jersey clients?\n\nThere's an idea. Give them everything, all the notes I built for Fede and his\ndamned patent application, sign over the exclusive rights to the patent for one\ndollar and services rendered (i.e., getting me a decent lawyer and springing me\nfrom this damned hole).\n\nMy last lawyer was a dickhead. He met me at the courtroom fifteen minutes before\nthe hearing, in a private room whose fixtures had the sticky filthiness of a\nbus-station toilet. \"Art, yes, hello, I'm Allan Mendelson, your attorney. How\nare you?\n\nHe was well over 6'6\", but weighed no more than 120 lbs and hunched over his\nskinny ribs while he talked, dry-washing his hands. His suit looked like the\nkind of thing you'd see on a Piccadilly Station homeless person, clean enough\nand well-enough fitting, but with an indefinable air of cheapness and falsehood.\n\n\"Well, not so good,\" I said. \"They upped my meds this morning, so I'm pretty\nlogy. Can't concentrate. They said it was to keep me calm while I was\ntransported. Dirty trick, huh?\"\n\n\"What?\" he'd been browsing through his comm, tapping through what I assumed was\nmy file. \"No, no. It's perfectly standard. This isn't a trial, it's a hearing.\nWe're all on the same side, here.\" He tapped some more. \"Your side.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Art said. \"My grandmother came down, and she wants to testify on my\nbehalf.\"\n\n\"Oooh,\" the fixer said, shaking his head. \"No, not a great idea. She's not a\nmental health professional, is she?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"But she's known me all my life. She knows I'm not a danger to\nmyself or others.\"\n\n\"Sorry, that's not appropriate. We all love our families, but the court wants to\nhear from people who have qualified opinions on this subject. Your doctors will\nspeak, of course.\"\n\n\"Do I get to speak?\"\n\n\"If you *really* want to. That's not a very good idea, either, though, I'm\nafraid. If the judge wants to hear from you, she'll address you. Otherwise, your\nbest bet is to sit still, no fidgeting, look as sane and calm as you can.\"\n\nI felt like I had bricks dangling from my limbs and one stuck in my brain. The\nnew meds painted the world with translucent whitewash, stuffed cotton in my ears\nand made my tongue thick. Slowly, my brain absorbed all of this.\n\n\"You mean that my Gran can't talk, I can't talk, and all the court hears is the\ndoctors?\"\n\n\"Don't be difficult, Art. This is a hearing to determine your competency. A\ngroup of talented mental health professionals have observed you for the past\nweek and they've come to some conclusions based on those observations. If\neveryone who came before the court for a competency hearing brought out a bunch\nof irrelevant witnesses and made long speeches, the court calendar would be\nbacklogged for decades. Then other people who were in for observation wouldn't\nbe able to get their hearings. It wouldn't work for anyone. You see that,\nright?\"\n\n\"Not really. I really think it would be better if I got to testify on my behalf.\nI have that right, don't I?\"\n\nHe sighed and looked very put-upon. \"If you insist, I'll call you to speak. But\nas your lawyer, it's my professional opinion that you should *not* do this.\"\n\n\"I really would prefer to.\"\n\nHe snapped his comm shut. \"I'll meet you in the courtroom, then. The bailiff\nwill take you in.\"\n\n\"Can you tell my Gran where I am? She's waiting in the court, I think.\"\n\n\"Sorry. I have other cases to cope with -- I can't really play messenger, I'm\nafraid.\"\n\nWhen he left the little office, I felt as though I'd been switched off. The\ndrugs weighted my eyelids and soothed my panic and outrage. Later, I'd be livid,\nbut right then I could barely keep from folding my arms on the grimy table and\nresting my head on them.\n\nThe hearing went so fast I barely even noticed it. I sat with my lawyer and the\ndoctors stood up and entered their reports into evidence -- I don't think they\nread them aloud, even, just squirted them at the court reporter. My Gran sat\nbehind me, on a chair that was separated from the court proper by a banister.\nShe had her hand on my shoulder the whole time, and it felt like an anvil there\nto my dopey muscles.\n\n\"All right, Art,\" my jackass lawyer said, giving me a prod. \"Here's your turn.\nStand up and keep it brief.\"\n\nI struggled to my feet. The judge was an Asian woman about my age, a small round\nhead set atop a shapeless robe and perched on a high seat behind a high bench.\n\n\"Your Honor,\" I said. I didn't know what to say next. All my wonderful rhetoric\nhad fled me. The judge looked at me briefly, then went back to tapping her comm.\nMaybe she was playing solitaire or looking at porn. \"I asked to have a moment to\naddress the Court. My lawyer suggested that I not do this, but I insisted.\n\n\"Here's the thing. There's no way for me to win here. There's a long story about\nhow I got here. Basically, I had a disagreement with some of my coworkers who\nwere doing something that I thought was immoral. They decided that it would be\nbest for their plans if I was out of the way for a little while, so that I\ncouldn't screw them up, so they coopered this up, told the London police that\nI'd gone nuts.\n\n\"So I ended up in an institution here for observation, on the grounds that I was\ndangerously paranoid. When the people at the institution asked me about it, I\ntold them what had happened. Because I was claiming that the people who had me\nlocked up were conspiring to make me look paranoid, the doctors decided that I\n*was* paranoid. But tell me, how could I demonstrate my non-paranoia? I mean, as\nfar as I can tell, the second I was put away for observation, I was guaranteed\nto be found wanting. Nothing I could have said or done would have made a\ndifference.\"\n\nThe judge looked up from her comm and gave me another once-over. I was wearing\nmy best day clothes, which were my basic London shabby chic white shirt and gray\nwool slacks and narrow blue tie. It looked natty enough in the UK, but I knew\nthat in the US it made me look like an overaged door-to-door Mormon. The judge\nkept looking at me. *Call to action,* I thought. *End your speeches with a call\nto action*. It was another bit of goofy West Coast Vulcan Mind Control, courtesy\nof Linda's fucking ex.\n\n\"So here's what I wanted to do. I wanted to stand up here and let you know what\nhad happened to me and ask you for advice. If we assume for the moment that I'm\n*not* crazy, how should I demonstrate that here in the court?\"\n\nThe judge rolled her head from shoulder to shoulder, making glossy black\nwaterfalls of her hair. The whole hearing is very fuzzy for me, but that hair!\nWho ever heard of a civil servant with good hair?\n\n\"Mr. Berry,\" she said, \"I'm afraid I don't have much to tell you. It's my\nresponsibility to listen to qualified testimony and make a ruling. You haven't\npresented any qualified testimony to support your position. In the absence of\nsuch testimony, my only option is to remand you into the custody of the\nDepartment of Mental Health until such time as a group of qualified\nprofessionals see fit to release you.\" I expected her to bang a gavel, but\ninstead she just scritched at her comm and squirted the order at the court\nreporter and I was led away.\n\nI didn't even have a chance to talk to Gran.\n\n26.\n\n##Received address book entry \"Toby Ginsburg\" from Colonelonic.\n\n## Colonelonic (private): This guy's up to something.

He Federally incorporated last week,\nsomething called \"TunePay, Inc.\" He's the Chairman, but he's only a minority\nshareholder. The rest of the common shares are held by a dummy corporation in\nLondon. Couldn't get any details on that without using a forensic accounting\npackage, and that'd get me fired right quick.\n\nTrepan: /private Colonelonic It's OK. I get the picture. I owe you one, all\nright?\n\n## Colonelonic (private): sweat.value==0 Are you going to tell me what this is\nall about someday? Not some bullshit about your girlfriend?\n\nTrepan: /private Colonelonic Heh. That part was true, actually. I'll tell you\nthe rest, maybe, someday. Not today, though. I gotta go to London.\n\nArt's vision throbbed with his pulse as he jammed his clothes back into his\nbackpack with one hand while he booked a ticket to London on his comm with the\nother. Sweat beaded on his forehead as he ordered the taxi while scribbling a\nnote to Gran on the smart-surface of her fridge.\n\nHe was verging on berserk by the time he hit airport security. The guard played\nthe ultrasound flashlight over him and looked him up and down with his goggles,\nthen had him walk through the chromatograph twice. Art tried to breathe calmly,\nbut it wasn't happening. He'd take two deep breaths, think about how he was yup,\ncalming down, pretty good, especially since he was going to London to confront\nFede about the fact that his friend had screwed him stabbed him in the back\nusing his girlfriend to distract him and meanwhile she was in Los Angeles\nsleeping with her fucking ex who was going to steal his idea and sell it as his\nown that fucking prick boning his girl right then almost certainly laughing\nabout poor old Art, dumbfuck stuck in Toronto with his thumb up his ass, oh Fede\nwas going to pay, that's right, he was -- and then he'd be huffing down his\nnose, hyperventilating, really losing his shit right there.\n\nThe security guard finally asked him if he needed a doctor.\n\n\"No,\" Art said. \"That's fine. I'm just upset. A friend of mine died suddenly and\nI'm flying to London for the funeral.\" The guard seemed satisfied with this\nexplanation and let him pass, finally.\n\nHe fought the urge to get plastered on the flight and vibrated in his seat\ninstead, jiggling his leg until his seatmate -- an elderly businessman who'd\nspent the flight thus far wrinkling his brow at a series of spreadsheets on his\ncomm -- actually put a hand on Art's knee and said, \"Switch off the motor, son.\nYou're gonna burn it out if you idle it that high all the way to Gatwick.\"\n\nArt nearly leapt out of his seat when the flight attendant wheeled up the\nduty-free cart, bristling with novelty beakers of fantastically old whiskey\nshaped like jigging Scotchmen and drunken leprechauns swinging from lampposts.\n\nBy the time he hit UK customs he was supersonic, ready to hammer an entire\npacket of Player's filterless into his face and light them with a blowtorch. It\nwasn't even 0600h GMT, and the Sikh working the booth looked three-quarters\nasleep under his turban, but he woke right up when Art stepped past the red line\nand slapped both palms on the counter and used them as a lever to support him as\nhe pogoed in place.\n\n\"Your business in England, sir?\"\n\n\"I work for Virgin/Deutsche Telekom. Let me beam you my visa.\" His hands were\nshaking so badly he dropped his comm to the hard floor with an ominous clatter.\nHe snatched it up and rubbed at the fresh dent in the cover, then flipped it\nopen and stabbed at it with a filthy fingernail.\n\n\"Thank you, sir. Door number two, please.\"\n\nArt took one step towards the baggage carousel when the words registered.\nCustoms search! Godfuckingdammit! He jittered in the private interview room\nuntil another Customs officer showed up, overrode his comm and read in his ID\nand credentials, then stared at them for a long moment.\n\n\"Are you quite all right, sir?\"\n\n\"Just a little wound up,\" Art said, trying desperately to sound normal. He\nthought about telling the dead friend story again, but unlike a lowly airport\nsecurity drone, the Customs man had the ability and inclination to actually\nverify it. \"Too much coffee on the plane. Need to have a slash like you wouldn't\nbelieve.\"\n\nThe Customs man grimaced slightly, then chewed a corner of his little moustache.\n\"Everything else is all right, though?\"\n\n\"Everything's fine. Back from a business trip to the States and Canada, all\njetlagged. You know. Can you believe the bastards actually expect me at the\noffice today?\" This might work. Piss and moan about the office until he gets\nbored and lets him go. \"I mean, you work your guts out, fly halfway around the\nworld and do it some more, get strapped into a torture seat -- you think Virgin\nsprings for business-class tickets for its employees? Hell no! -- for six hours,\nthen they want you at the goddamned office.\"\n\n\"Virgin?\" the Customs man said, eyebrows going up. \"But you flew in on BA, sir.\"\n\nShit. Of course he hadn't booked a Virgin flight. That's what Fede'd be\nexpecting him to do, he'd be watching for Art to use his employee discount and\nhop a flight back. \"Yes, can you believe it?\" Art thought furiously. \"They\ncalled me back suddenly, wouldn't even let me wait around for one of their own\ndamned planes. One minute I'm eating breakfast, the next I'm in a taxi heading\nfor the airport. I forgot half of my damned underwear in the hotel room! You'd\nthink they could cope with *one little problem* without crawling up my cock,\nwouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Sir, please, calm down.\" The Customs man looked alarmed and Art realized that\nhe'd begun to pace.\n\n\"Sorry, sorry. It just sucks. Bad job. Time to quit, I think.\"\n\n\"I should think so,\" the Customs man said. \"Welcome to England.\"\n\nTraffic was early-morning light and the cabbie drove like a madman. Art kept\nflinching away from the oncoming traffic, already unaccustomed to driving on the\nwrong side of the road. England seemed filthy and gray and shabby to him now,\ntiny little cars with tiny, anal-retentive drivers filled with self-loathing,\nvegetarian meat-substitutes and bad dentistry. In his rooms in Camden Town, Art\ntook a hasty and vengeful census of his stupid belongings, sagging rental\nfurniture and bad art prints hanging askew (not any more, not after he smashed\nthem to the floor). Bad English clothes (toss 'em onto the floor, looking for\none thing he'd be caught dead wearing in NYC, and guess what, not a single\nthing). Stupid keepsakes from the Camden market, funny novelty lighters, retro\nrave flyers preserved in glassine envelopes.\n\nHe was about to overturn his ugly little pressboard coffee table when he\nrealized that there was something on it.\n\nA small, leather-worked box with a simple brass catch. Inside, the axe-head. Two\nhundred thousand years old. Heavy with the weight of the ages. He hefted it in\nhis hand. It felt ancient and lethal. He dropped it into his jacket pocket,\ninstantly deforming the jacket into a stroke-y left-hanging slant. He kicked the\ncoffee table over.\n\nTime to go see Fede.\n\n27.\n\nI have wished for a comm a hundred thousand times an hour since they stuck me in\nthis shithole, and now that I have one, I don't know who to call. Not smart. Not\nhappy.\n\nI run my fingers over the keypad, think about all the stupid, terrible decisions\nthat I made on the way to this place in my life. I feel like I could burst into\ntears, like I could tear the hair out of my head, like I could pound my fists\nbloody on the floor. My fingers, splayed over the keypad, tap out the old\nnervous rhythms of the phone numbers I've know all my life, my first house, my\nMom's comm, Gran's place.\n\nGran. I tap out her number and hit the commit button. I put the phone to my\nhead.\n\n\"Gran?\"\n\n\"Arthur?\"\n\n\"Oh, Gran!\"\n\n\"Arthur, I'm so worried about you. I spoke to your cousins yesterday, they tell\nme you're not doing so good there.\"\n\n\"No, no I'm not.\" The stitches in my jaw throb in counterpoint with my back.\n\n\"I tried to explain it all to Father Ferlenghetti, but I didn't have the details\nright. He said it didn't make any sense.\"\n\n\"It doesn't. They don't care. They've just put me here.\"\n\n\"He said that they should have let you put your own experts up when you had your\nhearing.\"\n\n\"Well, of *course* they should have.\"\n\n\"No, he said that they *had* to, that it was the law in Massachusetts. He used\nto live there, you know.\"\n\n\"I didn't know.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, he had a congregation in Newton. That was before he moved to Toronto.\nHe seemed very sure of it.\"\n\n\"Why was he living in Newton?\"\n\n\"Oh, he moved there after university. He's a Harvard man, you know.\"\n\n\"I think you've got that wrong. Harvard doesn't have a divinity school.\"\n\n\"No, this was *after* divinity school. He was doing a psychiatry degree at\nHarvard.\"\n\nOh, my.\n\n\"Oh, my.\"\n\n\"What is it, Arthur?\"\n\n\"Do you have Father Ferlenghetti's number, Gran?\"\n\n28.\n\nTonaishah's Kubrick-figure facepaint distorted into wild grimaces when Art\nbanged into O'Malley House, raccoon-eyed with sleepdep, airline crud crusted at\nthe corners of his lips, whole person quivering with righteous smitefulness. He\ncommed the door savagely and yanked it so hard that the gas-lift snapped with a\npopping sound like a metal ruler being whacked on a desk. The door caromed back\ninto his heel and nearly sent him sprawling, but he converted its momentum into\na jog through the halls to his miniature office -- the last three times he'd\nspoken to Fede, the bastard had been working out of his office -- stealing his\npapers, no doubt, though that hadn't occurred to Art until his plane was\nsomewhere over Ireland.\n\nFede was halfway out of Art's chair when Art bounded into the office. Fede's\nface was gratifyingly pale, his eyes thoroughly wide and scared. Art didn't\nbother to slow down, just slammed into Fede, bashing foreheads with him. Art\nsmelled a puff of his own travel sweat and Fede's spicy Lilac Vegetal, saw blood\nwelling from Fede's eyebrow.\n\n\"Hi, pal!\" he said, kicking the door shut with a crash that resounded through\nthe paper-thin walls.\n\n\"Art! Jesus fucking Christ, what the hell is wrong with you?\" Fede backed away\nto the far corner of the office, sending Art's chair over backwards, wheels\nspinning, ergonomic adjustment knobs and rods sticking up in the air like the\nlegs of an overturned beetle.\n\n\"TunePay, Inc.?\" Art said, booting the chair into Fede's shins. \"Is that the\nbest fucking name you could come up with? Or did Toby and Linda cook it up?\"\n\nFede held his hands out, palms first. \"What are you talking about, buddy? What's\nwrong with you?\"\n\nArt shook his head slowly. \"Come on, Fede, it's time to stop blowing smoke up my\ncock.\"\n\n\"I honestly have no idea --\"\n\n\"*Bullshit!*\" Art bellowed, closing up with Fede, getting close enough to see\nthe flecks of spittle flying off his lips spatter Fede's face. \"I've had enough\nbullshit, Fede!\"\n\nAbruptly, Fede lurched forward, sweeping Art's feet out from underneath him and\nlanding on Art's chest seconds after Art slammed to the scratched and splintered\nhardwood floor. He pinned Art's arms under his knees, then leaned forward and\ncrushed Art's windpipe with his forearm, bearing down.\n\n\"You dumb sack of shit,\" he hissed. \"We were going to cut you in, after it was\ndone. We knew you wouldn't go for it, but we were still going to cut you in --\nyou think that was your little whore's idea? No, it was mine! I stuck up for\nyou! But not anymore, you hear? Not anymore. You're through. Jesus, I gave you\nthis fucking job! I set up the deal in Cali. Fuck-off heaps of money! I'm\nthrough with you, now. You're done. I'm ratting you out to V/DT, and I'm flying\nto California tonight. Enjoy your deportation hearing, you dumb Canuck\nboy-scout.\"\n\nArt's vision had contracted to a fuzzy black vignette with Fede's florid face in\nthe center of it. He gasped convulsively, fighting for air. He felt his bladder\ngo, and hot urine stream down his groin and over his thighs.\n\nAn instant later, Fede sprang back from him, face twisted in disgust, hands\nbrushing at his urine-stained pants. \"Damn it,\" he said, as Art rolled onto his\nside and retched. Art got up on all fours, then lurched erect. As he did, the\naxe head in his pocket swung wildly and knocked against the glass pane beside\nhis office's door, spiderwebbing it with cracks.\n\nMoving with dreamlike slowness, Art reached into his pocket, clasped the axe\nhead, turned it in his hand so that the edge was pointing outwards. He lifted it\nout of his pocket and held his hand behind his back. He staggered to Fede, who\nwas glaring at him, daring him to do something, his chest heaving.\n\nArt windmilled his arm over his head and brought the axe head down solidly on\nFede's head. It hit with an impact that jarred his arm to the shoulder, and he\ndropped the axe head to the floor, where it fell with a thud, crusted with blood\nand hair for the first time in 200,000 years.\n\nFede crumpled back into the office's wall, slid down it into a sitting position.\nHis eyes were open and staring. Blood streamed over his face.\n\nArt looked at Fede in horrified fascination. He noticed that Fede was breathing\nshallowly, almost panting, and realized dimly that this meant he wasn't a\nmurderer. He turned and fled the office, nearly bowling Tonaishah over in the\ncorridor.\n\n\"Call an ambulance,\" he said, then shoved her aside and fled O'Malley House and\ndisappeared into the Piccadilly lunchtime crowd.\n\n29.\n\nI am: sprung.\n\nFather Ferlenghetti hasn't been licensed to practice psychiatry in Massachusetts\nfor forty years, but the court gave him standing. The judge actually winked at\nme when he took the stand, and stopped scritching on her comm as the priest said\na lot of fantastically embarrassing things about my general fitness for human\nconsumption.\n\nThe sanitarium sent a single junior doc to my hearing, a kid so young I'd\nmistaken him for a hospital driver when he climbed into the van with me and\ngunned the engine. But no, he was a doctor who'd apparently been briefed on my\ncase, though not very well. When the judge asked him if he had any opinions on\nFather Ferlenghetti's testimony, he fumbled with his comm while the Father\nstared at him through eyebrows thick enough to hide a hamster in, then finally\nstammered a few verbatim notes from my intake interview, blushed, and sat down.\n\n\"Thank you,\" the judge said, shaking her head as she said it. Gran, seated\nbeside me, put one hand on my knee and one hand on the knee of Doc Szandor's\nbrother-in-law, a hotshot Harvard Law post-doc whom we'd retained as corporate\ncounsel for a new Limited Liability Corporation. We'd signed the articles of\nincorporation the day before, after Group. It was the last thing Doc Szandor did\nbefore resigning his post at the sanitarium to take up the position of Chief\nMedical Officer at HumanCare, LLC, a corporation with no assets, no employees,\nand a sheaf of shitkicking ideas for redesigning mental hospitals using\noff-the-shelf tech and a little bit of UE mojo.\n\n30.\n\nArt was most of the way to the Tube when he ran into Lester. Literally.\n\nLester must have seen him coming, because he stepped right into Art's path from\nout of the crowd. Art ploughed into him, bounced off of his dented armor, and\nwould have fallen over had Lester not caught his arm and steadied him.\n\n\"Art, isn't it? How you doin', mate?\"\n\nArt gaped at him. He was thinner than he'd been when he tried to shake Art and\nLinda down in the doorway of the Boots, grimier and more desperate. His tone was\njust as bemused as ever, though. \"Jesus Christ, Lester, not now, I'm in a hurry.\nYou'll have to rob me later, all right?\"\n\nLester chuckled wryly. \"Still a clever bastard. You look like you're having some\nhard times, my old son. Maybe that you're not even worth robbing, eh?\"\n\n\"Right. I'm skint. Sorry. Nice running into you, now I must be going.\" He tried\nto pull away, but Lester's fingers dug into his biceps, emphatically, painfully.\n\n\"Hear you ran into Tom, led him a merry chase. You know, I spent a whole week in\nthe nick on account of you.\"\n\nArt jerked his arm again, without effect. \"You tried to rob me, Les. You knew\nthe job was dangerous when you took it, all right? Now let me go -- I've got a\ntrain to catch.\"\n\n\"Holidays? How sweet. Thought you were broke, though?\"\n\nA motorized scooter pulled up in the kerb lane beside them. It was piloted by a\nsmart young policewoman with a silly foam helmet and outsized pads on her knees\nand elbows. She looked like the kid with the safety-obsessed mom who inflicts\ncriminally dorky fashions on her daughter, making her the neighborhood\nlaughingstock.\n\n\"Everything all right, gentlemen?\"\n\nLester's eyes closed, and he sighed a put-upon sigh that was halfway to a groan.\n\n\"Oh, yes, officer,\" Art said. \"Peter and I were just making some plans to see\nour auntie for supper tonight.\"\n\nLester opened his eyes, then the corners of his mouth incremented upwards.\n\"Yeah,\" he said. \"'Sright. Cousin Alphonse is here all the way from Canada and\nAuntie's mad to cook him a proper English meal.\"\n\nThe policewoman sized them up, then shook her head. \"Sir, begging your pardon,\nbut I must tell you that we have clubs in London where a gentleman such as\nyourself can find a young companion, legally. We thoroughly discourage making\nsuch arrangements on the High Street. Just a word to the wise, all right?\"\n\nArt blushed to his eartips. \"Thank you, Officer,\" he said with a weak smile.\n\"I'll keep that in mind.\"\n\nThe constable gave Lester a hard look, then revved her scooter and pulled into\ntraffic, her arm slicing the air in a sharp turn signal.\n\n\"Well,\" Lester said, once she was on the roundabout, \"*Alphonse*, seems like\nyou've got reason to avoid the law, too.\"\n\n\"Can't we just call it even? I did you a favor with the law, you leave me be?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. P'raps I should put in a call to our friend PC McGivens. He\nalready thinks you're a dreadful tosser -- if you've reason to avoid the law,\nMcGivens'd be bad news indeed. And the police pay very well for the right\ninformation. I'm a little financially embarrassed, me, just at this moment.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Art said. \"Fine. How about this: I will pay you 800 Euros, which I\nwill withdraw from an InstaBank once I've got my ticket for the Chunnel train to\nCalais in hand and am ready to get onto the platform. I've got all of fifteen\nquid in my pocket right now. Take my wallet and you'll have cabfare home.\nAccompany me to the train and you'll get a month's rent, which is more than the\npolice'll give you.\"\n\n\"Oh, you're a villain, you are. What is it that the police will want to talk to\nyou about, then? I wouldn't want to be aiding and abetting a real criminal --\ncould mean trouble.\"\n\n\"I beat the piss out of my coworker, Lester. Now, can we go? There's a plane in\nParis I'm hoping to catch.\"\n\n31.\n\nI have a brand-new translucent Sony Veddic, a series 12. I bought it on credit\n-- not mine, mine's sunk; six months of living on plastic and kiting\nbalance-payments with new cards while getting the patents filed on the eight new\ngizmos that constitute HumanCare's sole asset has blackened my good name with\nthe credit bureaus.\n\nI bought it with the company credit card. The *company credit card*. Our local\nBaby Amex rep dropped it off himself after Doc Szandor faxed over the signed\ncontract from the Bureau of Health. Half a million bucks for a proof-of-concept\ninstall at the very same Route 128 nuthatch where I'd been \"treated.\" If that\nworks, we'll be rolling out a dozen more installs over the next year: smart\ndoors, public drug-prescription stats, locator bracelets that let \"clients\" --\nI've been learning the nuthouse jargon, and have forcibly removed \"patient\" from\nmy vocabulary -- discover other clients with similar treatment regimens on the\nward, bells and whistles galore.\n\nI am cruising the MassPike with HumanCare's first-ever employee, who is, in\nturn, holding onto HumanCare's first-ever paycheck. Caitlin's husband has been\nvery patient over the past six months as she worked days fixing the ailing\nmachinery at the sanitarium and nights prototyping my designs. He's been\nlikewise patient with my presence on his sagging living-room sofa, where I've\nhad my nightly ten-hour repose faithfully since my release. Caitlin and I have\nactually seen precious little of each other considering that I've been living\nunder her roof. (Doc Szandor's Cambridge apartment is hardly bigger than my room\nat the hospital, and between his snoring and the hard floor, I didn't even last\na whole night there.) We've communicated mostly by notes commed to her fridge\nand prototypes left atop my suitcase of day-clothes and sharp-edged toiletries\nat the foot of my makeshift bed when she staggered in from her workbench while I\nsnored away the nights. Come to think of it, I haven't really seen much of Doc\nSzandor, either -- he's been holed up in his rooms, chatting away on the EST\nchannels.\n\nI am well rested. I am happy. My back is loose and my Chi is flowing. I am\ndriving my few belongings to a lovely two-bedroom -- one to sleep in, one to\nwork in -- flat overlooking Harvard Square, where the pretty co-eds and their\nshaggy boyfriends tease one another in the technical argot of a dozen abstruse\ndisciplines. I'm looking forward to picking up a basic physics, law, medicine\nand business vocabulary just by sitting in my window with my comm, tapping away\nat new designs.\n\nWe drive up to a toll plaza and I crank the yielding, human-centric steering\nwheel toward the EZPass lane. The dealer installed the transponder and gave me a\nbrochure explaining the Sony Family's approach to maximum driving convenience.\nBut as I approach the toll gate, it stays steadfastly down.\n\nThe Veddic's HUD flashes an instruction to pull over to the booth. A bored\nattendant leans out of the toll booth and squirts his comm at me, and the HUD\ncomes to life with an animated commercial for the new, improved TunePay service,\nnow under direct MassPike management.\n\nThe TunePay scandal's been hot news for weeks now. Bribery, corruption, patent\ndisputes -- I'd been gratified to discover that my name had been removed from\nthe patent applications, sparing me the nightly hounding Fede and Linda and her\nfucking ex had been subjected to on my comm as the legal net tightened around\nthem.\n\nI end up laughing so hard that Caitlin gets out of the car and walks around to\nmy side, opens the door, and pulls me bodily to the passenger side. She serenely\nignores the blaring of the horns from the aggravated, psychotic Boston drivers\nstacked up behind us, walks back to the driver's side and takes the wheel.\n\n\"Thanks,\" I tell her, and lay a hand on her pudgy, freckled arm.\n\n\"You belong in a loony bin, you know that?\" she says, punching me in the thigh\nharder than is strictly necessary.\n\n\"Oh, I know,\" I say, and dial up some music on the car stereo.\n\n--\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis novel was workshopped by the Cecil Street Irregulars, the Novelettes and\nthe Gibraltar Point gang, and received excellent feedback from the first readers\non the est-preview list (especially Pat York).

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
