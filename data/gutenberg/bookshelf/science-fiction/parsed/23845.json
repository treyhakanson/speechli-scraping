He'd ripped\naway the cord about a thick parcel of documents and heaved them into the\nfireplace of the office of the Minister for Diplomatic Affairs. A fire\nburned there, and already there were many ashes. The carpet and the\nchairs of the cabinet officer's sanctum were coated with fine white\ndust. As the communicator buzzed again, Captain Bors took a fireplace\ntool and stirred the close-packed papers to looseness. They caught and\nburned instead of only smouldering.\n\nThe communicator buzzed yet again. He brushed off his hands and pressed\nthe answer-stud.\n\nHe said bleakly: \"Diplomatic Affairs. Bors speaking.\"\n\nThe communicator relayed a voice from somewhere else with an astonishing\nfidelity of tone.\n\n\"_Spaceport, sir. A ship just broke out of overdrive. We don't identify\nits type. One ship only, sir._\"\n\nBors said grimly;\n\n\"You'd recognize a liner. If it's a ship from the Mekinese fleet and\nstays alone, it could be coming to receive our surrender. In that case\nplay for time and notify me.\"\n\n\"_Yes, sir.--One moment! It's calling, sir! Here it is--._\"\n\nThere was a clicking, and then there came a voice which had the curious\nquality of a loudspeaker sound picked up and relayed through another\nloudspeaker.\n\n\"_Calling ground! Calling ground! Space-yacht_ Sylva _reports arrival\nand asks coordinates for landing. Our mass is two hundred tons standard.\nPurpose of visit, pleasure-travel._\"\n\nA pause. The voice from the spaceport:\n\n\"_Sir?_\"\n\nCaptain Bors said impatiently, \"Oh, let him down and see if he knows\nanything about the Mekinese. Then advise him to go away at once. Tell\nhim why.\"\n\n\"_Yes, sir._\"\n\nA click. Young Captain Bors returned to his task of burning papers.\nThese were the confidential records of the Ministry for Diplomatic\nAffairs. Captain Bors wore the full-dress uniform of the space navy of\nthe planet Kandar. It was still neatly pressed but was now smudged with\nsoot and smeared with ashes. He had burned a great many papers today.\nElsewhere in the Ministry other men were burning other documents. The\nother papers were important enough; they were confidential reports from\nvolunteer- and paid-agents on twenty planets. In the hands of\nill-disposed persons, they could bring about disaster and confusion and\ninterplanetary tension. But the ones Captain Bors made sure of were\ndeadly.\n\nHe burned papers telling of conditions on Mekin itself. The authors of\nsuch memoranda would be savagely punished if they were found out. Then\nthere were papers telling of events on Tralee. If it could be said that\nhe were more painstakingly destructive than average about anything,\nCaptain Bors was about them. He saw to it that they burned to ashes. He\ncrushed the ashes. He stirred them. It would be unthinkable that such\nmorsels could ever be pieced together and their contents even guessed\nat.\n\nHe went on with the work. His jaunty uniform became more smeared and\nsmudged. He gave himself no rest. There were papers from other planets\nnow under the hegemony of Mekin. Some were memoranda from citizens of\nthis planet, who had traveled upon the worlds which Mekin dominated as\nit was about to dominate Kandar. They, especially had to be pulverized.\nEvery confidential document in the Ministry for Diplomatic Affairs was\nin the process of destruction, but Captain Bors in person destroyed\nthose which would cause most suffering if read by the wrong persons.\n\nIn other ministries and other places similar holocausts were under way.\nThere was practically nothing going on on Kandar which was not related\nto the disaster for which the people of that world waited. The feel of\nbitterness and despair was everywhere. Broadcasting stations stayed on\nthe air only to report monotonously that the tragic event had not yet\nhappened. The small space-navy of Kandar waited, aground, to take the\nking and some other persons on board at the last moment. When the\nMekinese navy arrived--or as much of it as was needed to make resistance\nhopeless--the end for Kandar would have come. That was the impending\ndisaster. If it came too soon, Bors's task of destruction couldn't be\ncompleted as was wished. In such a case this Ministry and all the others\nwould hastily be doused with incendiary material and fired, and it would\ndesperately be hoped that all the planet's records went up in the\nflames.\n\nCaptain Bors flung more and more papers on the blaze. He came to an end\nof them.\n\nThe communicator buzzed, again. He answered once more.\n\n\"_Sir, the space-yacht_ Sylva _is landed. It comes from Norden and has\nno direct information about the Mekinese. But there's a man named Morgan\nwith a very important letter for the Minister for Diplomatic Affairs.\nIt's from the Minister for Diplomatic Affairs on Norden._\"\n\nBors said sardonically, \"Maybe he should wait a few days or hours and\ngive it to the Mekinese! Send him over if he wants to take the chance,\nbut warn him not to let anybody from his yacht leave the spaceport!\"\n\n\"_Yes, sir._\"\n\nBors made a quick circuit of the Ministry building to make sure the rest\nof the destruction was thoroughly carried out. He glanced out of a\nwindow and saw the other ministries. From their chimneys thick smoke\npoured out--the criminal records were being incinerated in the Ministry\nof Police. Tax records were burning in the Ministry of Finance.\nEducational information about Kandarian citizens flamed and smoked in\nthe Ministry of Education. Even voting and vehicle-registry lists were\nbeing wiped out of existence by flames and the crushing of ashes at\nappropriate agencies. The planet's banks were completing the\ndistribution of coin and currency, with promissory notes to those\ndepositors they could not pay in full, and the real-estate registers\nwere open so individuals could remove and hide or destroy their titles\nto property. The stockholders' books of corporations were being burned.\nSmall ships parted with their wares and took promises of payment in\nreturn. The planet Kandar, in fact, made ready to receive its\nconquerors.\n\nIt was not conquered yet, but there could be no hope.\n\nBors was in the act of brushing off his hands again, in a sort of\nsymbolic gesture of completion, when a ground-car stopped before the\nMinistry. A stout man got out. A rather startlingly pretty girl\nfollowed. They advanced to the door of the Ministry.\n\nPresently, Captain Bors received the two visitors. His once-jaunty\nuniform looked like a dustman's. He was much more grim than anybody his\nage should ever be.\n\n\"Your name is Morgan,\" he said formidably to the stout man. \"You have a\nletter for the Minister. He's not here. He's gathering up his family. If\nanyone's in charge, I am.\"\n\nThe stout man cheerfully handed over a very official envelope.\n\nBors said caustically, \"I don't ask you to sit down because everything's\ncovered with ash-dust. Excuse me.\"\n\nHe tore open the envelope and read its contents. His impatience\nincreased.\n\n\"In normal times,\" he said, \"I'm sure this would be most interesting.\nBut these are not normal times. I'm afraid--\"\n\n\"I know! I know!\" said the stout man exuberantly. \"If times were normal\nI wouldn't be here! I'm president and executive director of Talents,\nIncorporated. From that letter you'll see that we've done very\nremarkable things for different governments and businesses. I'd like to\ntalk to someone with the authority to make a policy decision. I want to\nshow what we can do for you.\"\n\n\"It's too late to do anything for us,\" said Bors. \"Much too late. We\nexpect the Mekinese fleet at any instant. You'd better go back to the\nspaceport and take off in your yacht. They're going to take over this\nplanet after a slight tumult we expect to arrange. You won't want to be\nhere when they come.\"\n\nMorgan waved a hand negligently.\n\n\"They won't arrive for four days,\" he said confidently. \"That's Talents,\nIncorporated information. You can depend on it! There's plenty of time\nto prepare before they get here!\" He smiled, as if at a joke.\n\nYoung Captain Bors was not impressed. He and all the other officers of\nthe Kandarian defense forces had searched desperately for something that\ncould be done to avert the catastrophe before them. They'd failed to\nfind even the promise of a hope. He couldn't be encouraged by the\nconfidence of a total stranger,--and a civilian to boot. He'd taken\nrefuge in anger.\n\nThe pretty girl said suddenly, \"Captain, at least we can reassure you on\none thing. Your government chartered four big liners to remove\ngovernment officials and citizens who'll be on the Mekinese black list.\nYou're worried for fear they won't get here in time. But my father--\"\n\nThe stout man looked at his watch.\n\n\"Ah, yes! You don't want the fleet cluttered up with civilians when it\ntakes to space! I'm happy to tell you it won't be. The first of your\nfour liners will break out of overdrive in--hm--three minutes, twenty\nseconds. Two others will arrive tomorrow, one at ten minutes after noon,\nthe other three hours later. The last will arrive the day after, at\nabout sunrise here.\"\n\nBors went a trifle pale.\n\n\"I doubt it. It's supposed to be a military secret that such ships are\non the way. Since you know it, I assume that the Mekinese do, too. In\neffect, you seem to be a Mekinese spy. But you can hardly do any more\nharm! I advise you to go back to your yacht and leave Kandar\nimmediately. If our citizens find out you are spies, they will literally\ntear you to pieces.\"\n\nHe looked at them icily. The stout man grinned.\n\n\"Listen, your h-- Captain, listen to me! The first liner will report\ninside of five minutes. That'll be a test. Here's another. There's a\nMekinese heavy cruiser aground on Kandar right now! It's on the sea\nbottom fifty fathoms down, five miles magnetic north-north-east from\nCape Farnell! You can check that! The cruiser's down there to lob a\nfusion bomb into your space-fleet when it starts to take off for the\nflight you're planning--to get all the important men on Kandar in one\nsmash! That's Talents, Incorporated information! It's a free sample. You\ncan verify it without it costing you anything, and when you want more\nand better information--why--we'll be at the spaceport ready to give it\nto you. And you will want to call on us! That's Talents, Incorporated\ninformation, too!\"\n\nHe turned and marched confidently--almost grandly--out of the room. The\ngirl smiled faintly at Bors.\n\n\"He left out something, Captain. That cruiser-- It could hardly act\nwithout information on when to act. So there's a pair of spies in a\nlittle shack on the cape. They've got an underwater cable going under\nthe sand beach and out and down to the space-cruiser. They're watching\nthe fleet on the ground with telescopes. When they see activity around\nit, they'll tell the cruiser what to do.\" Then she smiled more broadly.\n\"Honestly, it's true! And don't forget about the liner!\"\n\nShe followed her father out of the room. Outside, as they got into the\nwaiting ground-car, she said to her father, \"If he smiled, I think I'd\nlike him.\"\n\nBut Bors did not know that at the time. He would probably not have paid\nany attention if he had. Kandar was about to be taken over by the\nMekinese, as his own Tralee had been ten years before, and other planets\nbefore that. Mekin was making an empire after an ancient tradition,\nwhich scorned the idea of incorporating other worlds into its own\ngovernmental system--which was appalling--but merely made them subjects\nand satellites and tributaries.\n\nBors had been born on Tralee, which he remembered as a tranquil world of\nglamor and happiness. But he was on Kandar now. He served in its\nspace-navy, and he foresaw Kandar becoming what Tralee had become. He\nfelt such hatred and rebellion toward Mekin, that he could not notice a\npretty girl. He was getting ready for the savage last battle of the\nspace-fleet of Kandar, which would fight in the great void until it was\nannihilated. There was nothing else to do if one was not to submit to\nthe arrogant tyranny that already lorded it over twenty-two subject\nplanets and might extend itself indefinitely throughout the galaxy.\n\nHe moved to verify again the complete pulverizing of the ashes in the\nfireplace.\n\nThe communicator buzzed. He pressed the answer button. A voice said,\n\"_Sir, the space-liner_ Vestis _reports breakout from overdrive. Now\ndriving for port. Message ends._\"\n\nBors's eyes popped wide. He'd heard exactly that only minutes ago! It\ncould be coincidence, but it was a very remarkable one. The man Morgan\nhad come to him to tell him that. If he'd come for some other reason,\nand merely made a guess, it could be coincidence. But he'd come only to\ntell Bors that he could be useful! And it was impossible, at a\ndestination-port, to know when a ship would break out of overdrive!\nEinstein's data on the anomalies of time at speeds near that of light\nnaturally did not apply to overdrive speeds above it. Nobody could\nconceivably predict when a ship from many light-years away would arrive!\nBut Morgan had! It was impossible!\n\nHe'd said something else that was impossible, too. He'd said there was a\nMekinese cruiser on the sea-floor of Kandar, where it could blast all\nthe local fleet--which was ready to fight but vulnerable to a single\nfusion-bomb. If such a thing happened, the impending disaster would be\nworse than intolerable. To Bors it would mean dying without a chance to\nstrike even the most futile of blows at the enemy.\n\nHe hesitated a long minute. Morgan's errand had been to make a\nprediction and give a warning, to gain credence for what he could do\nlater. The prediction was fulfilled. But the warning....\n\nAn enemy cruiser in ambush on Kandar was a possibility that simply\nhadn't been considered--hadn't even occurred to anyone. But once it was\nmentioned it seemed horribly likely. There was no time for a search at\nrandom, but if Morgan had been right about one thing he might have some\nway to know about another.\n\nBors gave curt orders to his subordinates in the work of\nrecord-destruction. He went out of the building to the greensward mall\nthat lay between the ministries of the government, and headed for the\npalace at its end. The government of Kandar was not one of great pomp\nand display. There was a king, to be sure, but nobody could imagine the\nperspiringly earnest King Humphrey the Eighth as a tyrant. There were\ntitles, it was true, but they were life appointments to the planet's\nlegislative Upper House. Kandar was a tranquil, quaint, and very happy\nworld. There were few industries, and those were small. Nobody was\nunduly rich, and most of its people were contented. It was a world with\nno history of bloodshed--until now.\n\nBors brushed absently at his uniform as he walked the two hundred yards\nto the palace. He abstractedly acknowledged the sentries' salutes as he\nentered. Much of the palace guard had been sent away, and most of the\npalace's small staff would hide from the Mekinese. The aggressors had a\nnasty habit of imposing special humiliations upon citizens who'd been\nprominent before they were conquered.\n\nHe went unannounced into King Humphrey's study, where the monarch\nconferred dispiritedly with Captain Bors's uncle, the exiled Pretender\nof Tralee, who listened with interest. The king was talking doggedly to\nhis old friend.\n\n\"No. You're mistaken. You'll have my written order to distribute the\nbullion in the Treasury to all the cities, to be shared as evenly as\npossible by all the people. The Mekinese can't blame you for obeying an\norder of your lawful king before they unlawfully seize the kingdom!\"\n\nCaptain Bors said curtly, \"Majesty, the first of the four liners is in.\nTwo more will arrive tomorrow and the last at sunrise the day after. The\nMekinese will be here two days later.\"\n\nKing Humphrey and Captain Bors's uncle stared at him.\n\n\"And,\" said Bors, \"the same source of information says there's a\nMekinese cruiser waiting underwater off Cape Farnell to lob a fusion\nbomb at the fleet as it's ready to lift.\"\n\nKing Humphrey said, \"But nobody can possibly know that two liners will\ncome tomorrow! One hopes so, of course. But one can't know! As for a\ncruiser, submerged, there's been no report of it.\"\n\n\"The information,\" said Captain Bors, \"came from Talents, Incorporated.\nIt's sample information, given free. The first item has checked. He came\nwith a letter from a cabinet minister on Norden.\"\n\nBors handed it to the Pretender of Tralee.\n\n\"Mmmm,\" he said thoughtfully. \"I've heard of this Talents, Incorporated.\nAnd on Norden, too! Phillip of Norden mentioned it to me. A man named\nMorgan had told him that Talents, Incorporated had secured information\nthat an atom bomb--a fission bomb as I remember, and quite small--had\nbeen set to assassinate him as he laid a cornerstone. The information\nturned out to be correct. Phillip of Norden and some thousands of his\nsubjects would have been killed. The assassins were really going to\nextremes. As I remember, Morgan wouldn't accept money for the warning.\nHe _did_ accept a medal.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Bors, \"I think I shall investigate what he said about a\nMekinese ship in hiding. You've no objection, Majesty?\"\n\nKing Humphrey the Eighth looked at the Pretender. One was remarkably\nunlike the other. The King was short and stocky and resolute, as if to\novercome his own shortcomings. The pretender was lean and gray, with the\nmild look of a man who has schooled himself to patience under\nfrustration. He nodded. King Humphrey shook his head.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Bors. \"I'll borrow a flier and see about it.\"\n\nHe left the palace. There was already disorganization everywhere. The\nplanetary government was in process of destroying all the machinery by\nwhich Kandar had been governed, as if to make the Mekinese improvise a\ngovernment anew. They would make many blunders, of course, which would\nbe resented by their new subjects. There would be much fumbling, which\nwould keep the victims of their conquest from regarding them with\nrespect. And there would be the small tumult Bors had said was in\npreparation. The king and the Kandarian fleet would fight, quite\nhopelessly and to their own annihilation, when the Mekinese fleet\nappeared. It would be something Kandar would always remember. It was\nlikely that she would not be the most docile of the worlds conquered by\nMekin. The Mekinese would always and everywhere be resented. But on\nKandar they would also be despised.\n\nBors found the ground-cars which waited to carry the king and those who\nwould accompany him, to the fleet when the time came. He commandeered a\nground-car and a driver. He ordered himself driven to the\natmosphere-flier base of the fleet.\n\nOn the way the driver spoke apologetically. \"Captain, sir, I'd like to\nsay something.\"\n\n\"Say it,\" said Bors.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir, but I've got a wife and children. Even for their sakes,\nsir. I mean, if it wasn't for them I'd--I'd be going with the fleet.\nI--wanted to explain--\"\n\n\"Why you're staying alive?\" asked Bors. \"You shouldn't feel apologetic.\nGetting killed in the fleet ought to follow at least the killing of a\nfew Mekinese. There should be some satisfaction in that! But if you stay\nhere your troubles still won't be over, and there'll be very little\nsatisfaction in what you'll go through. What the fleet will do will be\ndramatic. What you'll do won't. You'll have the less satisfying role. I\nthink the fleet is taking the easy way out.\"\n\nThe driver was silent for a long time as he drove along the strangely\nunfrequented highways. Just before the ground-car reached the air base,\nhe said awkwardly, \"Thank you, sir.\"\n\nWhen he brought the car to a stop, he got out quickly to offer a very\nstiff military salute.\n\nBors went inside. He found men with burning eyes conferring feverishly.\nAn air force colonel said urgently, \"Sir, please advise us! We have our\norders, but there's nearly a mutiny. We don't want to turn anything over\nto the Mekinese--after all, no matter what the king has commanded, once\nthe fleet had lifted off, there can be no punishment if we destroy our\nplanes and blast our equipment! Will you give us an unofficial--\"\n\nBors broke in quickly.\n\n\"I may be able to give you a chance at a Mekinese cruiser. Can you lend\nme a plane with civilian markings and a pilot who's a good photographer?\nI'll need a magnetometer to trail, too. There's a rather urgent\nsituation coming up.\"\n\nThe men stared at him.\n\nHe explained the possibility of a Mekinese space-cruiser lying in fifty\nfathoms off Cape Farnell. He did not say where the information came\nfrom. Even to men as desperate as these, Talents, Incorporated\ninformation would not seem credible without painstaking explanation.\nBors was by no means sure that he believed it himself, but he wanted to\nso fiercely that he sounded as if some Mekinese spy or traitor had\nconfessed it.\n\nThe feeling of tenseness multiplied, but voices grew very quiet. No man\nspoke an unnecessary word. In minutes they had made complete\narrangements.\n\nWhen the atmosphere-flier took off down the runway, wholly deceptive\nexplanations were already being made. It was said that the\natmosphere-fliers were to load bombs for demolition because the king was\nbeing asked for permission to bomb all mines and bridges and railways\nand docks that would make Kandar a valuable addition to the Mekinese\nempire. Everything was to be destroyed before the conquerors came to\nground. The destruction would bring hardship to the citizens--so the\nstory admitted--but the Mekinese would bring that anyhow. And they\nshouldn't profit by what Kandar's people had built for themselves.\n\nThe point was, of course, to get bombloads aboard planes with no chance\nof suspicion by spy or traitor of the actual use intended for them.\nMeanwhile, Bors flew in an atmosphere-flier which looked like a private\nship and explained his intentions to the pilot, so that the small plane\ndid not go directly to the spot five miles offshore that the mysterious\nvisitors had mentioned, to make an examination of the sea bottom.\nInstead, it flew southward. It did not swing out to sea for nearly fifty\nmiles. It went out until it was on a line between a certain small island\nwhere many well-to-do people had homes, and the airport of the planet's\ncapital city. Then it headed for that airport.\n\nIt flew slowly, as civilian planes do. By the time the sandy beaches of\na cape appeared, it was quite convincingly a private plane bringing\nsomeone from a residential island to the airport of Kandar City. If a\nsmall object trailed below it, barely above the waves, suspended by the\nthinnest of wires, it was invisible. If the plane happened to be on a\ncourse that would pass above a spot north-northeast from the tip of the\ncape, a spot calculated from information given by Talents, Incorporated,\nit seemed entirely coincidental. Nobody could have suspected anything\nunusual; certainly nothing likely to upset the plans of a murderous\ntotalitarian enemy. One small and insignificant civilian plane shouldn't\nbe able to prevent the murder of a space-fleet, a king and the most\nresolute members of a planet's population!\n\nCaptain Bors flew the ship. The official pilot used an electron camera,\ngiving a complete and overlapping series of pictures of the shore five\nmiles away with incredible magnification and detail.\n\nThe magnetometer-needle flicked over. Its findings were recorded. As\nthe plane went on it returned to a normal reading for fifty fathoms of\nseawater.\n\nHalf an hour later the seemingly private plane landed at the capital\nairport. Another half-hour, and its record and pictures were back at the\nair base, being examined and computed by hungry-eyed men.\n\nJust as the pretty Morgan girl had said, there was a shack on the very\ntip of the cape. It was occupied by two men. They loafed. And only an\nelectron camera could have used enough magnification to show one man\nlaughing, as if at something the other had said. The camera proved--from\nfive miles away--that there was no sadness afflicting them. One man\nlaughed uproariously. But the rest of the planet was in no mood for\nlaughter.\n\nThe magnetometer recording showed that a very large mass of magnetic\nmaterial lay on the ocean bottom, fifty fathoms down. Minute\nmodifications of the magnetic-intensity curve showed that there was\nelectronic machinery in operation down below.\n\nBors made no report to the palace. King Humphrey was a conscientious and\ndoggedly resolute monarch, but he was not an imaginative one. He would\nwant to hold a cabinet meeting before he issued orders for the\ndestruction of a space-ship that was only technically and not actually\nan enemy. Kandar had received an ultimatum from Mekin. An answer was\nrequired when a Mekinese fleet arrived off Kandar. Until that moment\nthere was, in theory, no war. But, in fact, Kandar was already conquered\nin every respect except the landing of Mekinese on its surface. King\nHumphrey, however, would want to observe all the rules. And there might\nnot be time.\n\nThe air force agreed with Bors. So squadron after squadron took off from\nthe airfield, on courses which had certain things in common. None of\nthem would pass over a fisherman's shack on Cape Farnell. None could\npass over a spot five miles north-north-east magnetic from that cape's\ntip, where the bottom was fifty fathoms down and a suspicious magnetic\ncondition obtained. One more thing unified the flying squadrons: At a\ngiven instant, all of them could turn and dive toward that fifty-fathom\ndepth at sea, and they would arrive in swift and orderly succession.\nThis last arrangement was a brilliant piece of staff-work. Men had\nworked with impassioned dedication to bring it about.\n\nBut only these men knew. There was no sign anywhere of anything more\nremarkable than winged squadrons sweeping in a seemingly routine\nexercise about the heavens. Even so they were not visible from the cape.\nThe horizon hid them.\n\nFor a long time there was only blueness overhead, and the salt smell of\nthe sea, and now and again flights of small birds which had no memory of\nthe flight of their ancestors from ancient Earth. The planet Kandar\nrolled grandly in space, awaiting its destiny. The sun shone, the sun\nset; in another place it was midnight and at still another it was early\ndawn.\n\nBut from the high blue sky near the planet's capital, there came a\nstuttering as of a motor going bad. If anyone looked, a most minute\nangular dot could be seen to be fighting to get back over the land from\nwhere it had first appeared, far out at sea. There were moments when the\nstuttering ceased, and the engine ran with a smooth hum. Then another\nstutter.\n\nThe plane lost altitude. It was clear that its pilot fought to make\nsolid ground before it crashed. Twice it seemed definitely lost. But\neach time, at the last instant, the motor purred--and popped--and the\nplane rose valiantly.\n\nThen there was a detonation. The plane staggered. Its pilot fought and\nfought, but his craft had no power at all. It came down fluttering, with\nthe pilot gaining every imaginable inch toward the sandy shore. It\nseemed certain that he would come down on the white beach unharmed, a\ngood half-mile from the fisherman's shack on the cape. But--perhaps it\nwas a gust of wind. It may have been something more premeditated. One\nwing flew wildly up. The flier seemed to plunge crazily groundward. At\nthe last fraction of a second, the plane reeled again and crashed into\nthe fisherman's shack before which, from a distance of five miles, a man\nhad been photographed, laughing.\n\nTimbers splintered. Glass broke musically. Then there were thuds as men\nleaped swiftly from the plane and dived under the still-falling\nroof-beams. There were three, four, half a dozen men in fleet uniforms,\nwith blasters in their hands. They used the weapons ruthlessly upon a\ncivilian who flung himself at an incongruously brand-new signalling\napparatus in a corner of the shattered house. A second man snarled and\nsavagely lunged at his attackers; he was also blasted as he tried to\nreach the same device.\n\nThere was no pause. Over the low ground to the west a flight of bombers\nappeared, bellowing. In mass formation they rushed out above the sea.\nFar to the right and high up, a second formation of man-made birds\nappeared suddenly. It dived steeply from invisibility toward the water.\nOver the horizon to the left there came V's of bomber-planes, one after\nanother, by dozens and by hundreds. More planes roared above the\nshattered shack. They came in columns. They came in masses. From the\nheavens above and over the ground below and from the horizon that rimmed\nthe world, the planes came. Planes from one direction crossed a certain\npatch of sea.\n\nThey were not wholly clear of it when planes from another part of the\nhorizon swept over the same area, barely wave-tip high. Planes from the\nwest raced over this one delimited space, and planes from the north\nalmost shouldered them aside, and then planes from the east covered that\nsame mile-square patch of sea, and then more planes from the south....\n\nThey followed each other in incredible procession, incredibly precise.\nThe water on that mile-square space developed white dots, which always\nvanished but never ceased. Spume-spoutings leaped up three feet, or ten,\nor twenty and disappeared, and then there were others which spouted up\none yard, or two, or ten. There were innumerable temporary whitecaps.\nThe surface became pale from the constant churning of new foam-patches\nbefore the old foam died.\n\nThen, with absolute abruptness, the planes flew away from the one square\nmile of sea. The late-comers climbed steeply. Abruptly, behind them,\nthere were warning booms. Then monstrous masses of spray and bubbles\nand blue water leaped up three hundred feet, four hundred feet, five....\n\nA square mile of ocean erupted as the planes climbed up and away from\nit. There were bombs in the ocean--some had sunk down deep. Others\nfollowed in close succession. Many, many burdens of bombs had been\ndropped into the sea as plane-fleet after plane-fleet went by.\n\nThe sea exploded in monstrous columns. Ton, half-ton and two-ton bombs\nbegan to detonate, fifty fathoms down. The Mekinese duty-officer below\nhad just learned that the spies' signalling device was cut off, when a\ndetonation lifted the hull of the Mekinese cruiser and shook it\nviolently. Another twisted its tail and crushed it. A bomb hit sea\nbottom a quarter-mile away. More bombs exploded still nearer, in close\ncontact with the giant hull. A two-ton bomb clanked into contact with\nits metal plating and burst.\n\nThe cruiser's duty-officer, cowering, thrust over the emergency-lever\nwhich would put the ship through pre-recorded commands faster than\norders could be spoken.\n\nRockets flared, deep under water. But the flames set off bombs and the\nrocket-nozzles cracked and were useless. A midship compartment was\nflooding. A forward compartment's wall caved in, and still bombs\nburst.... The skipper of the assassin cruiser screamed an order to fire\nall missiles. They were already set on target. They were pre-set for the\nspot where the space-navy of Kandar waited to rise.\n\nThey did not. One missile was blasted as the cover of its launcher-tube\nopened. Another was blown in half when partly out of its tube and a\nthird actually rammed a sinking bomb and vanished with it when it\nexploded.\n\nThe huge thing under the sea heaved itself up blindly. It reached the\nsurface. But it was shattered and rent and dying, and planes dived\nvengefully upon it and blasted apart whatever could be seen in the\nroaring foam. So the blinded, suffering thing of metal only emptied\nitself of air and went down to the bottom again, where more bombs ripped\nand tore it.\n\nThe atmosphere-fliers of Kandar swung in a gigantic, ballooning circle\nabout the spot where they had dropped a good fraction of a ton of bombs\nto the square yard. But nothing stirred there any more. Still, the\nplanes flew in a great, deadly band about it until a flitterboat came\nout from shore and lowered a camera and a light by long, long cords.\n\nThere was no space-cruiser at the bottom of the sea. There was evidence\nof one, yes. There were patches of plating, and there were naked,\ntwisted girders. The dangling underwater camera faithfully reported what\nit saw by the light that was lowered with it. But there was no\nspace-cruiser. There were only the rather small fragments of what had\nbeen one a little while before.\n\nCaptain Bors went back to the palace. He was savagely pleased. He and\nthe air-fleet men had done something. They'd had some satisfaction.\nThey'd killed some Mekinese and ruined a plan to assassinate the Kandar\nfleet. But they'd only gotten an immediate satisfaction. Kandar was\nstill to be conquered. Nothing important had changed.\n\nBors made his way to the king's study. He entered. King Humphrey the\nEighth and the Pretender of Tralee were listening doubtfully to a stout\nman. The man was Morgan.\n\nHe stopped talking and blinked at Captain Bors. The captain ignored\nroyal etiquette and spoke to him without first greeting the king.\n\n\"The ship was there, as you said. We smashed it. Thank you. Is there any\nmore information you can give us?\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\nAt the spaceport, carefully selected persons filed onto the space-liner\n_Vestis_. It was not officially believed that the other three great\nchartered ships would arrive before the Mekinese fleet. It was, in fact,\nrather likely that none of the information given by Talents,\nIncorporated was ever believed until the event confirmed the prediction.\nIn the case of the first liner, those who went on board had been chosen\nby a strict principle of priority. Men who would merely be imprisoned\nwhen Mekin took over had no privilege of escape. Not yet. Those who were\ndestined for execution as soon as a quisling government was formed, were\nalso not entitled to depart on the liner. But those who had\nconspicuously supported King Humphrey in his resistance to intimidation;\nthose who had encouraged others to object to concessions which could\nonly be forerunners of other concessions; those who had spoken and\nwritten and labored to spread information about the facts of life under\nMekin, would not merely be imprisoned or executed. They would be\ntortured. So they were entitled to first chance at escape.\n\nThe space-liner blasted off some six hours after its arrival. It\nvanished blessedly into overdrive where it could not be intercepted. It\nheaded for the far-away world of Trent, where its passengers would be\nallowed to land as refugees and where, doubtless, they would speak\nbitterly about Mekin for all the rest of their lives. But the government\nof Mekin would not care.\n\nMekin was a phenomenon so improbable that only those who were students\nof past civilizations could really believe it. There were innumerable\nreferences to such r\u00e9gimes in the histories of ancient Earth. There was,\nfor example, Napoleon, said people informed about such matters. With a\nfraction of a fraction of one per cent of the French people actively\ncooperating, he overawed the rest and then took over a nation which was\nnot even his own. Then he took over other nations where less than a\nfraction of a fraction of one per cent concurred. Then he took soldiers\nfrom those second-order conquests to make third-order conquests, and\nthen soldiers from the third to make fourth.\n\nThere was Mussolini, said the learned men. He had organized a group of\nrowdies and gangsters, and began by levying protection-money on\ngambling-houses and even less reputable resorts, and with the money\nincreased his following. He had murdered those who opposed him and\npresently he collected protection money from even the great business\ncorporations of his country, financing more political gangsterism until\nhe ruled his nation for himself and his confederates.\n\nAnd there was Hitler, said the historically-minded. In the beginning his\nfollowers never dared show themselves in the uniforms they adopted,\nbecause their fellow-countrymen hated everything they stood for. But\nbefore the end came they worshipped him. They murdered millions at his\ncommand, but they died because of him, too.\n\nThere was Lenin, and there was Stalin. Specialists in history could talk\nvery learnedly about the developments on Mekin which paralleled the\ncabals headed by Lenin, and later, Stalin. Theirs was a much more\ndurable organization than those of Napoleon and Mussolini and Hitler.\n\nThe ruling clique on Mekin had begun in this manner.\n\nMekin had once had a cause to which all its officials paid lip-service\nand some possibly believed in. Because of this cause it was the\norganization and not the individual who was apotheosized. Therefore,\nthere could be fierce battles among members of the ruling class. There\ncould be conspiracies. The last three dictators of Mekin had been\nmurdered in palace revolutions, and the current dictator was more\nelaborately protected from his confreres than any mere hereditary tyrant\never needed to be. But Mekin remained a strong and dynamic world,\nengaged in the endless subjugation of other worlds for a purpose nobody\nreally remembered any more.\n\nAgainst such a society, a planet like Kandar was helpless. Mekin could\nnot be placated nor satisfied with less than the subjugation and the\nruin of its neighbors. For a time, Kandar had tried to arm for its own\ndefense. It had a space-fleet which in quality was probably equal to\nMekin's, but in quantity was hopelessly less. Also it had a defensive\npolicy. It did not dream of any but a defensive war. And no war was ever\nwon by mere defense. There could be no defense against the building-up\nof tensions, the contriving of incidents, the invention of insults. It\nhad been proved often enough. Eventually there was an ultimatum, and\nthere was surrender, and then the installation of a puppet government\nand the ruthless bleeding of another captured planet for the benefit of\nthe rulers of Mekin.\n\nThe process was implacable. There was nothing to be done but submit,\nflee or die. Various parts of Kandar's population chose one or another\ncourse. Four great liners would carry away those who could be helped to\nflee. The mass of the people must submit, the fighting forces savagely\nmade ready to die.\n\nBut in the cabinet meeting after the destruction of the hidden enemy\ncruiser, the tone was set by highly practical men. Bors was present at\nthe meeting. He'd destroyed the cruiser. He was to be questioned about\nit. He had Morgan standing by to explain the part of Talents,\nIncorporated if required.\n\nKing Humphrey said heavily, \"This is probably the last cabinet meeting\nbefore the coming of the Mekinese. I do not think oratory is called for.\nI put the situation as it stands. A fleet will come from Mekin for our\nanswer to their ultimatum. Our space-fleet will not surrender. Our air\nforce is openly mutinous at the idea of submission. It has been said\nthat if we fight, our planet will be bombed from space until all its air\nis poison, so that every living creature here will die. If this is true,\nI do not think that even we who plan to fight have the right to bring\nsuch a bombing about. But I doubt if that is true. There has been one\nincident. Whether one likes it or not, it has happened. Captain Bors has\nreason to hope that the space-fleet, by fighting to the death, can\nactually benefit the rest of our people.\"\n\nBors spoke, excitement coloring his words.\n\n\"It's perfectly simple. There are only two kinds of people, slaves and\nfree men. Slaves can be tortured and killed without concern. With free\nmen a bargain has always to be struck. If there is no resistance to the\nMekinese, they will despise us. We will be worse off than if we fight.\nBecause if we fight, at least our people will be respected. They may be\noppressed because they are conquered, but they won't be treated with\nthe contempt and doubled oppression given to slaves.\"\n\nA bearded man said querulously, \"That's theory. It's psychology. It even\nsmacks of idealism! Let us be realistic! As a practical man, I am\nconcerned with getting the best possible terms for our population. After\nall, the dictator of Mekin must be a reasonable man! He must be a\npractical man! I believe that we should negotiate until the very last\ninstant.\"\n\nBors said indignantly, \"Negotiate? You haven't anything to negotiate\nwith! I am not a citizen of Kandar, though I serve in its fleet. I am\nstill a national of Tralee. But I have talked to the officers of the\nfleet. They won't surrender. You can't negotiate for them to do so. You\ncan't negotiate for them to go quietly away and pretend that nothing has\nhappened and that there never was a fleet. When the Mekinese arrive, the\nfleet will fight. It doesn't hope to win; it doesn't expect\nanything--except getting killed honorably when its enemy would like to\nhave it grovel. But it's going to fight!\"\n\nKing Humphrey said doggedly, \"My influence does not extend to the\ndisgrace of our fighting forces. The fleet will fight. I believe it\nunwise. But since it will fight I shall be in the flagship and it _will\nnot surrender_.\"\n\nThere was a pause. The bearded man said peevishly, \"But it should fight\non its own! It should not compromise Kandar!\"\n\nThere was a murmur. King Humphrey looked about him from under lowered\nbrows.\n\n\"That can be arranged,\" he said heavily. \"I will constitute a caretaker\ngovernment by royal proclamation. I will appoint you,\" he looked\nsteadily at the bearded man, \"to be head of it and make such terms as\nyou can. If you like, when the Mekinese come you can warn them that the\nfleet has mutinied under me, its king, and may offer battle, but that\nyou are ready to lead the people of Kandar in--\"\n\n\"In licking the boots of all Mekinese,\" said Bors in an icy tone.\n\nThere was a small rumble of protest. Bors stood up.\n\n\"I'd better leave,\" he said coldly. \"I'm not entitled to speak. If you\nwant me, I can be reached.\"\n\nHe strode from the council-chamber. As the door closed behind him, he\nground his teeth. The stout man, Morgan, of the space-yacht _Sylva_,\npaced up and down the room where he waited to be called. His daughter\nsat tranquilly in a chair. She smiled pleasantly at Bors when he came\nin. Morgan turned to face him.\n\n\"Here's some Talents, Incorporated information,\" he said zestfully. \"The\ncabinet is scared. A few are willing to fight, but most are already\ntrying to think how they can make terms with the Mekinese.\"\n\nBors opened his mouth to swear, then checked himself.\n\n\"Gwenlyn,\" said Morgan, \"will pardon an expression of honest\nindignation. It's a dirty shame, eh?\"\n\n\"If I were a native of Kandar,\" said Bors bitterly, \"I'd be even more\nashamed than I am as a native of Tralee. The people of Tralee\nsurrendered, but they didn't realize what they were getting into. These\nmen do!\"\n\nThe girl Gwenlyn said quietly, \"I'm sorry for King Humphrey.\"\n\n\"He's miscast,\" said Morgan briskly. \"He should be king of a calm and\npeaceful world in calm and peaceful times. You're going to have trouble\nwith him, Captain Bors!\" Then he said; \"Perhaps we can work out a plan\nor two, eh? While you're waiting for the cabinet to call you back?\"\n\n\"I've no authority,\" said Bors. \"My uncle's the Pretender of Tralee, and\nI was originally commissioned in the fleet as a sort of courtesy to him.\nI can't speak for anybody but myself.\"\n\n\"You can speak for common sense,\" said Gwenlyn. \"After all, you know\nwhat the people really want. You could try to arrange things so that the\nfleet can fight well.\"\n\n\"It'll fight well,\" said Bors curtly. \"It'll give a good account of\nitself! But that won't do any good!\"\n\nMorgan struck an attitude, beaming.\n\n\"Ah! But you've got Talents, Incorporated on your side! You don't\nrealize yet, Captain, what a difference that can make! While there's\nlife and Talents, Incorporated, there's hope!\"\n\nBors shrugged. Suddenly he found that he, too, drearily accepted defeat.\nThere was no more hope of accomplishment. There was nothing to be\nachieved. He would serve no purpose by straining against the impossible.\n\nHe said tiredly, \"I'll agree that Talents, Incorporated cost the\nMekinese one cruiser.\"\n\n\"A trifle,\" said Morgan, waving his hand, \"mere soup\u00e7on of\naccomplishment. We're prepared to do vastly more.\"\n\nIt occurred to Bors to be curious.\n\n\"Why? You're risking your life and your daughter's by staying here. If\nMekin ever finds out about its cruiser on the sea bottom and your share\nin that affair, you'll be in a fix! And certainly you can't expect to\nmake a profit here? We couldn't even pay you for what you've already\ndone!\"\n\n\"I'm right now,\" said Morgan placidly, \"quite as rich as I want to be.\nI've another ambition--but let's not go into that. I want to show you\nwhat Talents, Incorporated can do in the four days--\" he looked at his\nwatch--\"three hours and some odd minutes that remain before the Mekinese\nfleet turns up. You've checked up on Talents, Incorporated?\"\n\n\"My uncle says,\" Bors told him, \"that you kept Phillip of Norden from\nbeing assassinated by a fission-bomb at a cornerstone laying. He also\nsays you wouldn't accept a reward, only a medal.\"\n\n\"I collect them,\" said Morgan modestly. \"You'd be surprised how many\norders and decorations a man can acquire by industry and\norganization--and Talents, Incorporated.\"\n\nGwenlyn said, \"Four days, three hours and some odd minutes--\"\n\n\"True,\" said Morgan. \"Let's get at it. Captain Bors, have you ever heard\nof a lightning calculator--a person who can do complicated sums in his\nhead as fast as he can hear or read the numbers involved?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bors. \"It's quite phenomenal, I believe.\"\n\n\"It's a form of genius,\" said Morgan. \"Only I call it a talent because\nit tends to make itself useless. Have you ever heard of a dowser?\"\n\n\"If you mean a man who finds places for wells, and locates mines by\nmeans of a hazel twig--\"\n\n\"The hazel twig is immaterial,\" Morgan told him. \"The point is that\nyou've heard of them, and you know that they can actually do such\nthings. Right?\"\n\nBors frowned. \"It's not proven,\" he said. \"At least I think it isn't\nconsidered proven because it isn't understood. But I believe it's\nconceded that such things are done. I believe, in fact, that dowsing has\nbeen done on photographs and maps, in an office, and not on the spot at\nall. I admit that that seems impossible. But I'm told it happens.\"\n\nMorgan nodded rapidly, very well pleased.\n\n\"One more. Have you heard of precognition?\"\n\nBors nodded. Then he shrugged.\n\n\"I have a Talent,\" said Morgan. \"I have a man in my employ with a talent\nfor precognizing when ships are going to arrive. His gift is strictly\nlimited. He used to work in a spaceport office. He always knew when a\nship was coming in. He didn't know how he knew. He doesn't know now. But\nhe always knows when a ship will arrive at the planet where he is.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" said Bors, only half listening.\n\n\"He was discharged,\" Morgan went on, \"because he allowed a maintenance\ncrew to disassemble, for repair, a vital relay in a landing-grid on the\nvery day when three space-ships were scheduled for arrival. There was\npandemonium, of course, because nothing could have landed there. So when\nmy Talent let the relay be dismantled, with three ships expected.... But\none ship was one day late, another two days, and the third, four. He\nknew it. He didn't know how, but he knew! He was discharged anyway.\"\n\nBors did not answer. The cabinet meeting in the other room went on.\n\n\"He told me,\" said Morgan, matter-of-factly, \"that four ships would\narrive on Kandar, and when. One of them has arrived. The others will\ncome as predicted. He knows that a fleet will get here two days after\nthe last of the four. One can guess it will be the Mekinese fleet.\"\n\nBors frowned. He was interested now.\n\n\"I've another Talent,\" pursued Morgan. \"He ought to be a paranoiac. He\nhas all the tendencies to suspicion that a paranoid personality has. But\nhis suspicions happen to be true. He'll read an item in a newspaper or\nwalk past, oh, say a bank. Darkly and suspiciously, he guesses that the\nnewspaper item will suggest a crime to someone. Or that someone will\nattempt to rob the bank in this fashion or that, at such-and-such a\ntime. And someone does!\"\n\n\"He'd be an uncomfortable companion,\" Bors observed wryly.\n\n\"I found him in jail,\" said Morgan cheerfully. \"He'd been warning the\npolice of crimes to come. They happened. So the police jailed him and\ndemanded that he name his accomplices so they could break up the\ncriminal gang whose feats he knew in advance. I got him out of jail and\nhired him as a Talent in Talents, Incorporated.\"\n\nBors blinked.\n\n\"Before we landed here,\" said Morgan, \"I'd told him about the political\nsituation, the events you expect. He immediately suspected that the\nMekinese would have a ship down somewhere, to blast the fleet of Kandar\nif it should dare to resist. In fact, he said positively that such a\ncruiser was waiting word to fire fusion-bombs.\"\n\nBors blinked again.\n\n\"And I spread out maps,\" said Morgan, \"and my dowser went over them--not\nwith a hazel twig, but something equally unscientific--his instinct--and\nhe assured me that the cruiser was under water five miles\nnorth-north-east magnetic from Cape Farnell. The map said the depth\nthere was fifty fathoms. Then my paranoid Talent observed that there'd\nbe spies on shore with means to signal to the submerged cruiser. My\ndowser then found a small shack on the map where a communicator to the\nship would be. With the information about the arrival of the liners, and\nthe facts about the cruiser--and I had other information too--I went to\nthe Ministry for Diplomatic Affairs and told you. As you know, the\ninformation I gave you was accurate.\"\n\nBors felt as if he'd been hit over the head. This was ridiculous! He'd\nhunted for the space-cruiser under the sea because the prediction of the\nliner's arrival was so uncannily correct. He'd helped plan and carry out\nthe destruction of that warship because its existence and location were\nverified by a magnetometer. But if he'd known how the information was\nobtained, if he'd known it was guessed at by a discharged spaceport\nemployee, and a paranoid personality, and a man who used a hazel twig or\nsomething similar.... If he'd known that, he'd never have dreamed of\naccepting it. He'd have flatly dismissed the ship-arrival prediction!\n\nBut, if he hadn't trusted the information enough to check on it, why,\nthe small space-fleet of Kandar would vanish in atomic flame when it\ntried to take off to fight. With it would vanish Bors, and his uncle,\nand the king and many resolute haters of Mekin.\n\nGwenlyn said, \"You're perfectly right, Captain.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Bors, numbly.\n\n\"It is stark-raving lunacy,\" said Gwenlyn pleasantly. \"Just like it\nwould have seemed stark-raving lunacy, once upon a time, to think of\npeople talking to each other when they were a thousand miles apart. Like\nit seemed insane to talk about flying machines. And again when they said\nthere could be a space-drive in which the reaction would be at a right\nangle to the action, and especially when somebody said that a way would\nbe found to drive ships faster than light. It's lunacy, just like those\nthings!\"\n\n\"Y-yes,\" agreed Bors, his thoughts crowding one another. \"It's all of\nthat!\"\n\nMorgan nodded his head rapidly.\n\n\"I felt that way about it,\" he observed, \"when I first got the idea of\nfinding and organizing Talents for practical purposes. But I said to\nmyself, 'Lots of great fortunes have been made by people assuming that\nother people are idiots.' In some ways they are, you know. And then I\nsaid to myself, 'Possibly a fortune can be made by somebody assuming\nthat _he_ is an idiot.' So I assumed it was idiotic to doubt something\nthat visibly happened, merely because I couldn't understand it. And\nTalents, Incorporated was born. It's done quite well.\"\n\nBors shook his head as if to clear it.\n\n\"It seems to have worked,\" he admitted. \"But if I'd known--\" He spread\nout his hands. \"I'll play along! What more can you do for us?\"\n\n\"I've no idea,\" said Morgan placidly. \"Such things have to work\nthemselves out, with a little prodding, of course. But one of my Talents\nsays the lightning-calculator Talent is the one who'll do you the most\ngood soonest. I'd suggest--\"\n\nThere was a murmur of voices from the cabinet room. The door opened and\nKing Humphrey came out. He looked baffled, which was not unusual. But he\nlooked enraged, which was.\n\n\"Bors!\" he said thickly. \"I've always thought I was a practical man! But\nif being practical means what some members of my cabinet think, I would\nrather be a poet! Bors, do something before my cabinet dethrones me and\ntricks the fleet into disbanding!\"\n\nHe stumbled across the room, not noticing Morgan or Gwenlyn. Bors came\nto attention.\n\n\"Majesty,\" he said, not knowing whether he spoke in irony or\nbewilderment, \"I take that as an order.\"\n\nThe king did not answer. When the door on the other side of the room\nclosed behind his unregal figure, Bors turned to Morgan.\n\n\"I think I've been given authority,\" he said in a sort of baffled calm.\n\"Suppose we go, Mr. Morgan, and find out what your lightning calculator\ncan do in the way of mental arithmetic, to change the situation of the\nkingdom?\"\n\n\"Fine!\" said Morgan cheerfully. \"D'you know, Captain Bors, he can solve\na three-body problem in his head? He hasn't the least idea how he does\nit, but the answer always comes out right!\" Then he said exuberantly,\n\"He'll tell you something useful, though! That's Talents, Incorporated\ninformation!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\nThere was a fleet on the way to Kandar. It could not be said to be\ntraveling in space, of course. If there had been an observer somewhere,\nhe could not conceivably have detected the ships. There would be no\noccultations of stars; no blotting out of any of the hundreds and\nthousands of millions of bright specks which filled all the firmament.\nThere would be no drive-radiation which even the most sensitive of\ninstruments could pick up. The fleet might be at one place to an\nobserver's right--where it was imperceptible--and then it might be at a\nplace to the observer's left--where it was undetectable--and nobody\ncould have told the difference.\n\nActually, each ship of the Mekinese fleet was in overdrive, which meant\nthat each had stressed the space immediately around it so that it was\nlike a cocoon of other-space; as if it were out of this cosmos\naltogether and in another. In sober fact, of course, nothing of the sort\nhad happened. An overdrive field changed the physical constants of\nspace. The capacity of a condenser in an overdrive field was different\nfrom that of a condenser out of it. The self-induction of a coil in an\noverdrive field was not the same as in normal space. Magnetic and\ngravitational fields also did not follow the same laws in stressed space\nas in unstressed extension. The speed of light was different. Inertia\nwas different. In short, a ship could drive at many hundreds of times\nthe velocity of light and the laws of Einstein did not apply, because\nhis laws referred to space that men had not tampered with.\n\nBut though ships in overdrive had to be considered as in motion, and\nthough their speed had to be considered as beyond the astronomical,\nthere were such incredible distances to be covered that time piled up.\nAside from double stars, there were no suns yet discovered which were\nless than light-years apart. The time required for travel between\ninhabited planets was still comparable to the time needed for\nsurface-travel between continents on a world. So the fleet of Mekin,\njourneying faster than the mind could imagine, nevertheless drove and\ndrove and drove in the blackness and darkness and isolation of each\nship's overdrive field. They had so driven for days. They would continue\nto do so for days to come.\n\nWhen Captain Bors burned the documents in the Ministry for Diplomatic\nAffairs, the enemy fleet might have been said to be at one place. When a\nsubmerged space-cruiser, planning assassination, was itself blown to\nbits with no chance to strike back, the Mekinese fleet was approximately\nsomewhere else. When a cabinet meeting disheartened King Humphrey, the\nfleet was much nearer to Kandar. But days of highly-tedious\neventlessness were still ahead of the war-fleet.\n\nSo Bors and Gwenlyn and Morgan got a ground-car and were driven to\nKandar's commercial spaceport. There they found the _Sylva_. It was far\nlarger than the usual space-yachts. There were commercial space-craft\nwhich were no larger. But it was a workmanlike sort of ship, at that. It\nhad two lifeboat blisters, and there were emergency rockets for landings\nwhere no landing-grids existed. The armored bands of overdrive-coil\nshielding were massive. The _Sylva_, in fact, looked more like a service\nship than either a commercial vessel or a yacht. It was obviously\nunarmed, but it had the look of a craft that could go very nearly\nanywhere.\n\n\"You'll find the Talents a bit odd,\" said Gwenlyn, as they drove up\nunder the hull's wide bulge. \"When they meet new people they like to\nshow off. Most of them were pretty well frustrated before Father found a\nuse for them. But they're quite pleasant people if you don't treat them\nlike freaks. They're not, you know.\"\n\nBors had nothing to say. Until he was fifteen he'd lived on Tralee,\nwhich was then a quiet, pacific world, as Kandar had been. As the nephew\nof a monarch at least as resolutely constitutional as King Humphrey,\nhe'd been raised in a very matter-of-fact fashion. The atmosphere had\nbeen that of a comfortable, realistic adjustment to facts. He was taught\na great respect for certain facts without being made fanatically opposed\nto anything else. He'd been trained to require reasonable evidence\nwithout demanding that all proofs come out of test tubes and electronic\napparatus. He was specifically taught that arithmetic cannot be proved\nby experimental evidence, but that sound experimental evidence agrees\nwith arithmetic. So he was probably better qualified than most to deal\nwith something like Talents, Incorporated. But it was not easy for him.\n\nThe ground-car stopped. An exit-port in the space yacht opened and an\nextension-stair came down. The three of them mounted it. The inner\nlock-door opened and they entered the _Sylva_.\n\nAn incredibly fat woman regarded Bors with warm and sentimental eyes. A\nman no older than Bors, but with prematurely gray hair, nodded at him. A\nman in a chair lifted a hand in highly dignified greeting. Everyone\nseemed to know who he was. There was a blonde woman who might be in her\nlate thirties, a short, scowling man with several jewelled rings on his\nfingers, and a gangling, skinny adolescent. There were still others.\n\nMorgan addressed them with enthusiasm. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he said.\n\"I present Captain Bors! He's come to arrange to use your talents in the\ngravest of all possible situations for his world!\"\n\nThere were nods. There were bows. The dignified man in the chair said\nconfidently, \"The ship was where I specified.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" said Morgan, beaming. \"Exactly! A magnificent piece of work!\nWhich is what I expected of you!\"\n\nHe made individual introductions all around. Bors did not begin to catch\nthe names. This was so-and-so, said Morgan, \"our Telepath.\" Still\nanother, \"our ship-arrival Precognizer--he predicted the coming of the\nliner, you remember.\" He came to the scowling man with rings. \"Captain\nBors, this is our Talent for Predicting Dirty Tricks. You've reason to\nthank him for disclosing that Mekinese cruiser underwater.\"\n\nBors followed the lead given him.\n\n\"There are many of us,\" he said, \"with reason to thank you for a most\nsatisfying operation. We smashed that cruiser!\"\n\nThe scowling man nodded portentously. The introductions went on. The\nskinny adolescent was \"our Talent for Locating Individuals.\" The\nenormously fat woman: \"our Talent for Propaganda.\"\n\nBors was confused. He had to steel himself not to decide flatly that all\nthis was nonsense. Morgan and Gwenlyn took him away from what appeared\nlike a sort of social hall for these externally commonplace persons.\n\nThey arrived at a smaller compartment. It was a much more personal sort\nof place. Morgan waved his hand.\n\n\"Gwenlyn and I live here,\" he observed. \"Our cabins are yonder and you\nmight call this our family room. Gwenlyn finds the undiluted society of\nTalents a bit wearing. Of course, handling them is my profession, though\nI have some plans for retirement. We'll see our Mathematics Talent in a\nminute or two. He knows it's expected that he'll be the most useful of\nall our Talents at the moment. He will make an entrance.\"\n\nGwenlyn sat down. She regarded Bors with amusement.\n\n\"I think the Captain's halfway unconvinced again, Father.\"\n\n\"I'm not unconvinced,\" said Bors grimly. \"I'm desperate. It's not easy\neither to ignore what's happened or to believe that it will continue.\nAnd I--well--if the Mekinese fleet does arrive, I don't want to miss\ngoing with our fleet to meet it.\"\n\n\"You won't miss anything, Captain,\" said Morgan happily. \"Have a cigar.\nGwenlyn, do you think I should--\"\n\n\"Let me,\" said Gwenlyn. \"I know how the Captain feels. I'm an outsider,\ntoo. I haven't any talent--fortunately! Sit down, Captain.\"\n\nBors seated himself. Morgan offered a cigar. He seemed too impatient and\nmuch too pleased to be able to sit down himself. Bors lighted the\ncigar; at the first puff he removed it and looked at it respectfully.\nSuch cigars were not easy to come by.\n\n\"I think,\" said Gwenlyn amiably, \"that Father himself has a talent,\nwhich makes him not too easy to get along with. But it has had some good\nresults. I hope it will have more here. The whole business is\nunbelievable, though, unless you think of some very special facts.\"\n\nBors nodded. He puffed again and waited.\n\n\"He told you some of it,\" said Gwenlyn. \"About the ship arrival Talent\nand the dowser. There've always been such people with gifts that\nnobody's ever understood, but that are real. Only they've always been\nconsidered freaks. They feel that they're remarkable--and they are--and\nthey want people to recognize this. But they've never had a function in\nsociety. They've been _denied_ all function. Take the Mathematical\nTalent! He can do any sort of mathematics in his head. Any sort! He used\nto hire out to work computers, and he always got discharged because he\ndid the computations in his head instead of using the machines. He was\nalways right, and he was proud of his ability. He wanted to use it! But\nnobody'd let him. He was a miserable misfit until Father found him and\nhired him.\"\n\nBors nodded again, but his forehead wrinkled.\n\n\"Talents, Incorporated is merely an organization, created by my father,\nto make use of people who can do things ordinarily impossible, and\nprobably unexplainable, but which exist nevertheless. There are more\ntalents than Father has gathered, of course. But what good are their\ngifts to them? No good at all! They're considered freaks. So Father\ngathered them together as he found them. First, of course, he needed\ncapital. So he used them to make money. Then he began to do useful\nthings with them, since nobody else did. Now he's brought them here to\nhelp.\"\n\nBors said painfully, \"They don't all have the same gift.\"\n\n\"No,\" agreed Gwenlyn.\n\n\"And there are limits to their talents?\"\n\n\"Naturally!\"\n\nMorgan broke in, amused. \"Gwenlyn insists that I have the talent of\nfinding and using talents.\"\n\n\"A mild talent, Father,\" said Gwenlyn. \"Not enough to make you\nrevolting. But--\"\n\nA door opened. A tweedy man with a small mustache stood in the doorway.\n\n\"I believe I'm wanted?\" he said offhandedly.\n\nMorgan introduced him. His name was Logan. He was the lightning\ncalculator, the mathematical talent of Talents, Incorporated. Bors shook\nhis hand. The tweedy man sat down. He drew out a pipe and began to fill\nit with conscious exactitude. He looked remarkably like a professor of\nmathematics who modestly pretended to be just another commuter. He\ndressed the part: slightly untidy hair; bulldog pipe; casual, expensive\nsports shoes.\n\n\"I understand,\" he said negligently, \"that you want some calculations\nmade.\"\n\n\"I'm told I do,\" said Bors, harassedly. \"But I don't know what they\nare.\"\n\n\"Then how can I make them?\" asked Logan with lifted eyebrows.\n\n\"Naturally,\" said Morgan, \"you'll find out the kind of calculations he\nneeds, that he can't get anywhere else. That'll be the kind he needs\nfrom you.\"\n\n\"Hm,\" said Logan. He blew a smoke-ring, thoughtfully. \"Where do you use\ncalculations in space-travel?\"\n\n\"Everywhere,\" said Bors. \"But we've computers for it. And they're quite\nadequate.\"\n\nLogan shrugged. \"Then what do you need me for?\"\n\n\"You tell me!\" said Bors, nettled. \"Certainly we don't need calculations\nfor space-travel. We've no long journey in mind. We're simply going to\ngo out and do some fighting when the Mekinese fleet gets here.\"\n\nLogan blew another smoke-ring.\n\n\"What calculations do you use in space-fighting?\"\n\n\"Courses and distances,\" said Bors. He could see no sense in this, but\nhe went on. \"Allowing for acceleration and deceleration in setting our\nmissiles on targets. Allowing for the motion of the targets. Again we\nhave computers for this. In practice they're too good! If we send a\nmissile at a Mekinese ship, they set a computer on it, and it computes a\ncourse for a counter-missile which explodes and destroys our missile\nwhen it's within a certain distance of it.\"\n\n\"Then your missile doesn't hit,\" said Logan.\n\n\"All too often, it doesn't,\" admitted Bors.\n\n\"Then their missiles don't hit either.\"\n\n\"If they send a hundred missiles at us, they're cancelled out if we send\na hundred to destroy them. Unfortunately, if they send more than we can\ncounter, we get wiped out.\"\n\nBors found his throat going dry. This, of course, was what he'd\ndesperately been denying to himself. It was the fundamental reason for a\ntotal lack of hope. The history of warfare is the history of rivalry\nbetween attack and defense. In the matter of missiles in space, there\nwas a stalemate. One missile fired in attack could always be destroyed\nby another fired in defense. It was an arithmetic balance. But it meant\nthat three ships could always destroy two, and four ships three. In the\nspace-fight ahead, there would be at least ten Mekinese ships to every\none from Kandar. The sally of Kandar's fleet would not be a rush into\nbattle, but an advance into annihilation. \"What we need,\" said Bors\ndesperately, \"is a means to compute courses for our missiles so they'll\nhit, and that the enemy can't counter-compute--so that his missiles\ncan't compute how to change course in order to cancel ours out.\"\n\nHe was astonished as the words left his mouth. This was what was needed,\nof course. But then he realized that it couldn't be done.\n\nLogan blew a smoke-ring.\n\n\"Mechanical computers,\" he said, \"have limits. They're designed to\ncalculate a trajectory with constant acceleration or no acceleration.\nBut that's all.\"\n\nBors frowned. \"What else could there be?\"\n\n\"Changing acceleration,\" said Logan condescendingly. \"A mechanical\ncomputer can't compute that. But I can.\"\n\nBors continued to frown. One part of his mind assured him that the\nstatement that mechanical computers could not calculate trajectories of\nmissiles with changing acceleration was incorrect. But the rest of his\nmind tried to imagine such a trajectory. He couldn't. In practice, men\ndo not have to handle the results of variable acceleration as cumulative\neffects.\n\n\"I think,\" said Bors carefully, \"that if you can do that--\"\n\nLogan blew a smoke-ring more perfect than any that had gone before.\n\n\"I'll calculate some tables,\" he said modestly. \"You can use them on\nyour computer-results. Then if you arrange your missiles to change their\nacceleration as they go, the Mekinese missiles can't intercept them.\"\n\nHe waved his hand with the grand air of someone assuring a grammar-grade\npupil that multiplication tables were quite reliable and could be used\nwith confidence. But his eyes fixed themselves on Bors's face. As the\nCaptain realized the implications of his statement, the eyes of the\nMathematical Talent of Talents, Incorporated shone with gratified\nvanity.\n\n\"We'll go out in a couple of tin cans,\" said Bors fiercely, \"and try\nthis out with dummy warheads!\"\n\nGwenlyn said quickly, \"Marvelous! Marvelous, Logan!\"\n\n\"It's nothing,\" said Logan modestly.\n\nBut it was a very great deal. Bors, impatient to try it out,\nnevertheless realized that Logan hadn't made the suggestion out of a\nbrilliant perception of a solution to a problem in ballistics, but\nbecause he thought in terms of mathematical processes. He didn't think\nof a new missile operation, but a new kind of computation. And he\nreveled in the fact that he had showed off his brilliance.\n\nIn the ground-car on the way to the fleet, Bors said helplessly to\nGwenlyn, \"I'm not the right man to be the liaison with you people. But\nthis might make us a pretty costly conquest for Mekin! With luck, we may\ntrade them ship for ship! They won't miss the ships they lose, but\nit'll be a lot of satisfaction to us!\"\n\n\"You expect to be killed,\" Gwenlyn said flatly.\n\n\"My uncle,\" explained Bors, \"considers that he should have gotten killed\nwhen Mekin took over Tralee. It would have set a good example. Since we\ndidn't do it for Tralee, we'll do it for Kandar. The king's going along\ntoo. After all, that's one of the things kings are for.\"\n\n\"To get killed?\"\n\n\"When necessary,\" Bors told her. \"Kandar shouldn't surrender even though\nthere will be at least ten Mekinese to one Kandarian.\"\n\nShe smiled at him, very oddly.\n\n\"I suspect,\" she said, \"that not everybody on the fleet will be killed.\nI'm sure of it. In fact, as my father would say, that's Talents,\nIncorporated information!\"\n\nBors frowned worriedly.\n\nThe fleet of Mekin continued in overdrive, heading for Kandar. Each\nsecond it traversed a distance equal to the span of a solar system, out\nto its remotest planet. A heartbeat that would begin where a pulsing\nCepheid, had it been possible to see, would have seemed at its greatest\nbrilliance, and would end where the light from that same giant star\nseemed dimmed almost to extinction. Of course no such observation could\nbe made from any ship in overdrive. Each one of the many, many ugly\nwar-machines was sealed in its own cocoon of overdrive-stressed space.\nEven in the armed transports that carried officials and bureaucrats and\nexperienced police organizers to set up a puppet government on Kandar,\nthere was not the faintest hint of anything that happened outside the\nindividual ship. But, what might be termed the position of the fleet,\nchanged with remarkable swiftness. It traveled light-hours between\nbreaths. Light-days between sentences. Light-months and light-years....\n\nBut it would not arrive on Kandar for a long while yet. Not for three\nwhole days.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n\nThe small fighting ship lifted swiftly from the surface of Kandar. As it\nrose, the sky turned dark and the sun's brilliant disk, far too bright\nto be looked at with unshielded eyes, became a blazing furnace that\ncould roast unshielded flesh. Stars appeared, shining myriads despite\nthe sun, with every one vivid against a background of black. The\nplanet's surface became a half-ball, of which a part lay in darkness.\n\n\"_Co-o-ntact!_\" said a voice through many speakers placed throughout the\nfighting ship's hull.\n\nThere was the rushing sound of compartment doors closing. Then a\ncushioned silence everywhere, save for the faint, standby scratching\nsounds that loudspeakers always emit.\n\nScreens lighted. A speck moved among the stars.\n\n\"_Prepare counter-missiles_,\" said the voice. \"_Proximity and track.\nFire only as missiles appear._\"\n\nThe moving speck flamed and was again only a moving speck. It ejected\nsomething which hurtled toward the ship just up from Kandar.\n\n\"_Intercept one away!_\" said a confident voice.\n\nThe last-launched missile fled toward the first moving speck,\ndiminishing as it went. It swung suddenly, off course.\n\n\"_Fire two!_\" snapped somebody somewhere.\n\nAnother object hurtled away toward the stars.\n\n\"_Fire three! Fire four!_\"\n\nFar away, something came plunging toward the ship. It did not travel in\na straight line. It curved. It was not reasonable for a missile to\ntravel in a curved line. The interceptor missiles had to detect it,\nswing to intercept, to accelerate furiously. The first interceptor\nmissed. Worse, it had lost its target. It went wandering vaguely among\nthe stars and was gone.\n\nThe second missed. The voice in the speaker seemed to crack.\n\n\"_Fire all missiles! They're turning too late! Pull 'em up ahead of the\ndamned thing!_\"\n\nThe deadly contrivances plunged away and further away into emptiness.\nThe third interceptor missed. The fourth. Tiny specks moved gracefully\non the radar screen. There was something coming toward the ship that had\nrisen from Kandar. The tracer-trails of missiles appeared against the\nstars. They made very pretty parabolas. That was all. The thing that was\ncoming left a tracer-trail too. It curved preposterously. The just-risen\nship furiously flung missiles at it. It did not dodge. But none of the\ntracer-trails intersected its own. All of them passed to its rear.\n\nFor the fraction of a second it was visible as an object instead of a\nspeck. That object swelled.\n\nIt went by. Bors's voice, relayed, said,\n\n\"_Coup! You're out of action. Right?_\"\n\nThe skipper of the ship just up from Kandar said grudgingly, \"Hell, yes!\nWe threw fifteen missiles at it, and missed with every one! This is\nmagic! Can we all have this before the Mekinese get here?\"\n\n\"_I hope so_,\" said Bors's voice. \"_We're trying hard, anyhow. Will you\nreport to ground?_\"\n\n\"_Right_,\" said the speakers in the ship which had just fired fifteen\nmissiles without a hit or interception. \"_Off._\"\n\nAnd then the compartment doors opened again and the normal sounds of a\nsmall fighting ship in space began again.\n\nAn hour later, aground, Bors said impatiently, \"Half a dozen ships have\nchecked out with me. I sent a single dummy-warhead missile at each one.\nThey knew I was trying something new. They tried interceptors. Not one\nworked. Worse, my missiles drew the interceptors off-course so they lost\ntheir original aim on the _Isis_. Missiles set for variable acceleration\nnot only can't be intercepted but they draw interceptors off-course and\nare super-interceptors themselves. I fired one dummy warhead at each\ntarget-ship. I got six hits with six missiles. They fired an average of\ntwelve missiles against each of mine. They got no intercepts or hits\nwith seventy-two tries! This appears to me a very gratifying development\nfor the situation we're in.\"\n\nThe bearded man who'd plumped for negotiation, earlier, now spoke\nindignantly in the War Council.\n\n\"Why wasn't this revealed earlier? We could have made a demonstration\nand Mekin would have been wary of issuing an ultimatum! Why was this\nconcealed until it was too late to use in negotiations with them?\"\n\n\"It wasn't available until today,\" Bors answered. \"It was tried, and it\nworked.\"\n\nAn admiral said slowly, \"As I understand it, this is a proposal of\nthe--hm--Talents, Incorporated people.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bors. \"We got the idea but couldn't do the math. Talents,\nIncorporated did the computations to make the missiles hit.\"\n\n\"Why? Why let them do the math? There may be a counter to this device.\nPerhaps Talents, Incorporated, was sent to us to get us to adopt this\nfreakish trick.\"\n\n\"Talents, Incorporated,\" said Bors, \"enabled us to smash a submerged\nMekinese cruiser. In giving us the necessary information, Talents,\nIncorporated kept the Mekinese from wiping out our space-fleet. Talents,\nIncorporated-- Oh, the devil!\"\n\nThe admiral gazed about him.\n\n\"This--device,\" he said precisely, \"is not a tried and standard weapon.\nOn the other hand, the sally of our fleet is not war. Because of our\ncivilian population we cannot make war on Mekin! The defiance of our\nfleet will be a gesture only--a splendid gesture, but no more. It should\nbe a dignified gesture. It would be most inappropriate for our fleet to\ntake to space, ostensibly to say that it prefers death to surrender, and\nfor it then to unveil a new and eccentric device which would say that\nthe fleet was foolish enough to hope that a gadget would save it from\ndying and Kandar from conquest. The fleet action should be fought with\nscorn of odds. It should end its existence in a manner worthy of its\ntraditions!\"\n\nBors exploded, \"Damnit--\"\n\nKing Humphrey held up his hand and said fretfully, \"As I remember it,\nAdmiral, you have been assigned to hold together the defense\nforces--those who either did not insist on going with the fleet, or for\nwhom there was no room--who have to be surrendered. You talk of\ngestures. But the young men who will go out in the fleet are not going\nthere to make gestures! They simply and furiously hate Mekin for what it\nis about to do. They are going out to kill as many Mekinese as they can\nbefore they, themselves, are killed. They would call your speech\nnonsense. And I would agree with them.\"\n\nBors said respectfully, \"Yes, Majesty. It may also be said that copies\nof the first Talents, Incorporated launching-data tables have already\nbeen distributed to the missile crews throughout the fleet. More are\nbeing distributed as fast as Logan calculates them. I don't think you\ncan keep our ships from trying the new missiles when the fighting\nstarts!\"\n\nIndignantly, the bearded man said, \"I protest! This is a War Council! If\nthe council is to be lectured by strangers and if its orders won't be\nobeyed, why hold it?\"\n\n\"Why, indeed?\" King Humphrey looked sternly about the council-table.\nSternness did not become him, but dignity did. He said with dignity,\n\"You who are to stay here have to think of dealing with a victorious\nMekin. We who are to go have to think of making our defeat count. There\nis no point in further discussion. The fleet will take off immediately.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat. The bearded man protested, \"But the Mekinese\naren't here yet! They won't arrive until day after tomorrow!\"\n\n\"You're using Talents, Incorporated information,\" objected Bors. \"And it\nis wise for the fleet to move off-planet at once! You are reasonable\nmen. Too reasonable! Nothing can destroy a nation so quickly as for it\nto fall into the hands of practical, hard-headed, reasonable men who act\nupon the best scientific data and the opinions of the best experts! That\nhappened on Tralee, and my uncle and myself are exiles and Tralee is\nsubjugated in consequence. But I am beginning to have hope for Kandar!\"\n\nHe followed King Humphrey out of the council-room. Fleet admirals\nbrought up the rear. The stodgy, dumpy figure of the king tramped\nonward. It became obvious that he was bound for the ground-cars that\nwaited to take him and those who would follow him to the launching area\nof the fleet.\n\nA lean, gray, vice-admiral fell into step beside Bors.\n\n\"You don't think things are hopeless, Captain?\" he asked curiously. \"I\ndon't see the shred of a chance for us. But my whole life's been in the\nfleet. Under Mekin I'd be drafted to work in a factory or serve as an\nunder-officer on a guard-ship, one or the other! I'd rather end in a\ngood fight. How can you have hope?\"\n\nBors said grimly, \"I'm not sure that I have. But I can't believe that\nnations can be saved by reasonable, practical men. They aren't made by\nthem! I've no hope except that acting foolishly may be wisdom. Sometimes\nit is.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" The vice-admiral grinned wryly. \"But fortunes are made by\nbusinessmen, and only history by heroes. No sensible man is ever a hero.\nBut, like you, I don't like practical men.\"\n\nThey went out-of-doors. The king climbed sturdily into a ground-car. It\nhummed away. There was a sort of ordered confusion, and then other\nground-cars began to stream away from the palace.\n\nMorgan appeared and waved to Bors. He hesitated, and Morgan pointed to\nan unofficial vehicle. Inside, Gwenlyn was smiling cheerfully at Bors.\nHe found himself returning the smile, and allowed himself to be guided\nto her. The ground-car rolled swiftly after the others.\n\n\"I've a little more Talents, Incorporated information,\" said Morgan.\n\"It's written down for you to read when you get to wherever you're\ngoing. It's rather important. Please be sure to read it fairly soon, it\nmay affect the fight.\"\n\n\"I'm headed for the fleet,\" said Bors. \"Take me there, will you? I\nwanted to say something before I left, anyhow.\"\n\nMorgan waved his hand.\n\n\"I can guess,\" he said blandly. \"Deepest gratitude and all that, but the\nrush of events blocked any way to arrange a suitable recompense for what\nTalents, Incorporated has done.\"\n\nBors blinked. \"That's the substance of what I meant to say,\" he\nadmitted.\n\n\"We'll take it up later,\" Morgan told him. \"We'll get in touch with you\nafter the battle.\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" said Bors. \"I'm not likely to be around.\"\n\nGwenlyn laughed a little.\n\n\"What's so amusing?\" asked Bors. \"I don't mean to strike an attitude,\nbut I do hate everything Mekin stands for, and I've a chance to throw a\nbrick at it. The price may be high but throwing the brick is necessary!\"\n\n\"We,\" said Gwenlyn, \"have Talents, Incorporated information, some of\nwhich is in that letter Father gave you. Our Department for Predicting\nDirty Tricks has been busy. You'll see. But we've other information,\ntoo.\"\n\nBors frowned at her. He put the letter away.\n\n\"More information--and you'll see me after the fight. You're not telling\nme you know the future?\"\n\nMorgan waved a cigar.\n\n\"Of course not! That's nonsense! If one knew the future, one could\nchange it, and then it wouldn't be what one knew! You haven't had any\nprophecies from me! Prophecy's absurd! All we've told you is about\nevents whose probability approaches unity.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"What Father means,\" Gwenlyn told him, \"is that you can't be told\nbeforehand about anything you can prevent, because if you can prevent it\nyou can make your knowledge false. So it isn't knowledge. What we want\nto say, though, is that we aren't through.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I'm going to retire,\" said Morgan blandly. \"But I want to do something\nfirst that I can gloat over later.\"\n\n\"He wants,\" added Gwenlyn, \"to repose in the satisfaction of his\nvanity.\" She laughed again at her father's expression.\n\n\"Seriously, Captain, we wanted to give you the letter and to ask you not\nto be surprised if we turn up somewhere. There's a Talent,\" she added,\n\"a young boy who can find people. He doesn't know how he does it,\nbut.... We'll find you!\"\n\nThe ground-car turned in at the fleet's take-off ground. The normal\ninterstellar traffic of a planet, of course, was handled by a spaceport,\nwith ships brought down to ground and lifted out to space again by the\nforce-fields generated in a giant landing-grid. But a war-fleet could\nnot depend solely on ground installations. The fighting ships of Kandar\nwere allowed to use the planet's spaceport only for special reasons.\nEmergency rocket take-offs and landings were necessary training for war\nconditions anyhow. So the take-off ground was pitted and scarred with\nburnt-over circles, where no living thing grew and where very often the\nclay beneath the humus top-layer was vitrified by rocket-flames.\n\nA guard at the gate brought the ground-car to a halt.\n\n\"War alert,\" said Bors. \"Only known officers and men admitted here. It's\nnot worth arguing about.\"\n\nHe got out of the car and shook hands.\n\n\"I still regret,\" he told Morgan, \"that we've had no chance to do\nsomething in return for the information you've given us.\" To Gwenlyn he\nsaid obscurely, \"I'm glad I didn't know you sooner.\"\n\nHe turned and walked briskly into the fenced-off area. Behind him,\nMorgan looked inquisitively at his daughter.\n\n\"What was that he just said?\"\n\n\"He's glad he didn't know me sooner,\" said Gwenlyn. She looked smugly\npleased. \"Considering everything, it was a very nice thing to say. I\nlike him even if he doesn't smile.\"\n\nMorgan did not seem enlightened. \"It doesn't make sense to me.\"\n\n\"That's because you are my father,\" said Gwenlyn. She stirred\nrestlessly. She was no longer smiling. \"I hope Talents, Incorporated\ninformation isn't wrong this time! Remember, we heard on Norden that the\ndictator of Mekin consults fortune-tellers!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said her father. \"But they're only fortune-tellers!\"\n\n\"One could be a Talent,\" said Gwenlyn worriedly, \"maybe without even\nknowing it.\"\n\nThere came a far-distant, roaring sound. Something silvery and\nglistening rose swiftly toward the sky. It dwindled to a speck. There\nwere more roarings. Three more silvery, glistening objects flung\nthemselves heavenward, leaving massive trails of seemingly solid smoke\nbehind them. Then there were bellowings. Larger ships rose up. As the\ndin of their rising began to diminish, there were louder, booming\nuproars and other silvery objects seemed to fling themselves toward the\nsky.\n\nThen thunder rolled, and huge shapes plunged in their turn toward the\nheavens. The space-fleet of Kandar left its native world. It departed in\nthe formation used for space maneuvering, much like the tactical\ndisposition of a column of marching soldiers in doubtful territory.\nThere was a \"point\" in advance of all the rest, to be the first to\ndetect or be fired on by an enemy. Then flankers reached straight out,\nand to the right and left, and then an advance-guard, and then the main\nforce with a rear-guard behind it.\n\nThe take-off area became invisible under a monstrous, roiling mountain\nof smoke, from which threads of vapor reached to emptiness. It became\nimpossible to hear oneself talk; it was unlikely that one could have\nheard a shot, as the heavy ships took off. But presently there were only\nlesser clamors and then mere roarings after them, and the last of the\nrocket-boomings died away. The smoke remained, rolling very slowly\naside. Then there were unexpected detonations. As the rocket-fume mist\ndissolved, the detonations were explained. Every building in the fleet's\nhome area, the sunken fuel-tanks, the giant rolling gantries--every bit\nof ground equipment for the servicing of the fleet was methodically and\ncarefully being blown to bits. The fleet was not expected back.\n\nThe ships rose above the atmosphere, and rose still higher, and the\nplanet Kandar became a gigantic ball which filled an enormous part of\nthe firmament. Then there were cracklings of communicators, and orders\nflittered through emptiness in scrambled and re-scrambled broadcasts of\ngibberish which came out as lucid commands in the control-rooms of the\nships. Then, first, the point, then the advanced flankers, and then the\nmain fleet, line by line and rank by rank--every ship drove on outward\nunder top-speed solar-system drive.\n\nThe last of the four chartered space-liners, come to take refugees away\nbefore the Mekinese arrived, saw the disappearance of the ships in the\nrear of the fleet's formation. The liner was lowered to the ground by\nthe landing-grid. It reported what it had seen. Those who were entitled\nto depart on it crowded aboard. With the fleet gone, panic began.\n\nMorgan had to spend lavishly to get copies of the news reports that the\nliner had brought along as a matter of course. He took them back to the\n_Sylva_, where a frowning man with rings on his fingers read them with\ndark suspicion. Presently, triumphantly, he dictated predictions of\ndirty tricks from indications in the news.\n\nMorgan returned to what he'd called the family room of the yacht. He\nrelaxed. Gwenlyn tried to read. She did not succeed. She was excessively\nnervous.\n\nBors was not. The fleet re-formed itself well out from Kandar. It made\nfor a rendezvous over a pole of the gas-giant planet which was the\nfourth planet from Kandar's sun. It was almost, but not quite in line\nwith that yellow star toward the base, from which the Mekinese flotilla\nwould come. The fleet went into a polar orbit around that gigantic\nplanet, which was useless to mankind because its atmosphere was partly\ngaseous ammonia and partly methane.\n\nThe cosmos paid no attention. An unstable sol-type star in Cygnus\ncollapsed abruptly and a number of otherwise promising planets became\nunfit for human exploitation. In Andromeda, a super-nova flared. The\nlight of its explosion would not reach Kandar for very many thousands of\nyears. The largest comet in the galaxy reached perihelion, and\npractically outshone the sun it circled. Nobody saw it, because nobody\nlived there. On a dreary, red-sky planet in Mousset, a thing squirmed\nheavily out of a stagnant sea and blinked stupidly at the remarkable\nabove-water cosmos it had discovered. Suns flamed and spouted flares.\nSmall dark stars became an infinitesimal fraction of a degree colder.\nThere was a magnetic storm in the photosphere of a sun which was not\nsupposed to have such things.\n\nThe war-fleet of Kandar, in very fine formation, flowed in its polar\norbit around the fourth planet out from Kandar's sun. In carefully\nscrambled and re-scrambled communications, certain ships were authorized\nto modify the settings of Mark 13 missiles in this exact fashion, to\nremove their warheads, and to diverge in pairs from the fleet proper.\nThey were to familiarize themselves with the results of making the\nacceleration of such missiles variable during flight. They would use the\nsupplied data-tables to compute firing constants for given ranges and\nrelative speeds. They would, of course, return to formation to permit\nother ships the same practice with the new method of missile handling.\n\nBors read the letter from Talents, Incorporated. It gave an exact time\nfor the breakout of the Mekinese fleet. The rest consisted mostly of\nspecific warnings from the Talents, Incorporated Department for\nPredicting Dirty Tricks. It listed certain things to be looked for among\nthe ships of the fleet. The information was like the news of an enemy\nship aground on Kandar; it was self-evidently plausible once one thought\nof it. Mekin was ruled and its military practices governed by men with\nthe instincts of conspirators, using other men with the\npsychopathological impulses which make for spies. They thought of\ndevices neither statesmen nor fighting men would have invented. But a\nparanoid Talent could think of them, and know that they were true.\n\nAs a result of the warnings, the flagship was found to have been somehow\nequipped, by Mekin, with a tiny, special microwave transmitter which\nused a frequency not usual on Kandar. It was, in effect, a radio beacon\non which enemy missiles could home. Also, the lead ship of a\ncruiser-squadron had been mysteriously geared to reveal its exact\nposition, course and speed while in space. There were other concealed\ndevices. Some would make the controls of predetermined ships useless\nwhen beams of specific frequency and form were trained upon them.\n\nOnce the basic idea was discovered, it was possible to make sure that\nall such enemy-supplied equipment was out of operation. The fleet was\nstill in no promising situation, with a ten-to-one disadvantage. But it\ncould not have put up even the beginning of a fight, had these\nspy-installed devices remained undiscovered.\n\nBors said carefully, by scrambled and re-scrambled communicator,\n\"Majesty, I'm beginning to be less than despairing. If they expect our\nships either to have been destroyed aground, or to be made helpless the\ninstant combat begins, we may give them a shock. We hoped to smash them\nship for ship. Finding out their tricks in advance may give us that! And\nif our missiles work as they've promised, we may get two for one!\"\n\nKing Humphrey's voice was dogged. \"_I will settle for anything but\nsurrender! From an honorable enemy I would take severe terms rather than\nsee my spacemen die. But I would do nobody any good by yielding to\nMekin!_\"\n\nBors clicked off. He looked at a clock. The prediction from Talents,\nIncorporated was that the Mekinese fleet would break out of overdrive at\n11.19 hours astronomical time.\n\nHe went over his ship. His crew was by no means depressed. There had\nbeen a terrific lift in spirits when dummy-warheaded missiles made\ntheoretic hits, though fifteen interceptors tried to stop them. The\ncrewmen now tended elaborately to explain the process. A part of the\ntrick was the curved path along which the re-set missiles flashed. Such\ncourses alone could never be computed by an unwarned enemy under battle\nconditions. But the all-important thing was that the missiles changed\ntheir acceleration as they drove. That couldn't be solved and the\nsolution put into practice during one fleet-action. Once the enemy had\nexperienced it, they could later duplicate it without doubt, but it\nwould still be impossible to counter.\n\nSo Bors's men were cheerful to the point of gaiety. They would fight\nmagnificently because they were thinking of what they would do to the\nenemy instead of what the enemy might do to them. If enemy crews had\nbeen assured that the fleet was half defeated before the fight began, to\nfind the fleet not crippled by spy-set devices would be startling. To\nfind them fighting like fiends would be alarming. And if--Bors grimly\nrepeated to himself, _if_--the modified missiles worked as well in\nbattle as in target practice....\n\nHe turned in and, despite his tensions, fell asleep immediately and\nslept soundly. When he awoke he felt curiously relaxed. It took him a\nmoment to realize he had dreamed about Gwenlyn. He couldn't remember\nwhat he had dreamed, but he knew it was comfortable and good. He\nwouldn't let himself dwell on it, however. There was work to be done.\n\nIt was singularly like morning on a planet. The ship was spotless,\nimmaculate. There was the fresh smell of growing things in the air. To\nsave tanked oxygen the air-room used vegetation to absorb CO{2} and\nexcess moisture from the breathing of the crew. There was room to spare\neverywhere, because unlike aircraft and surface ships, the size of a\nspace-ship made no difference in its speed. There was no resistance due\nto size. Only the mass counted. So there was spaciousness and freshness\nand something close to elation on Bors's ship on the day it was to fight\nfor the high satisfaction of getting killed.\n\nBors saw to it that his men breakfasted heartily.\n\n\"We've got a party ahead,\" he told the watch at mess. \"Eat plenty but\ngive the other watch a chance to fill up, too.\"\n\nSomebody said cheerfully, \"The condemned men ate a hearty breakfast,\nsir?\"\n\nBors grinned.\n\n\"The breakfast we can be sure of. The condemned part--we'll have\nsomething to say about that. Some Mekinese wouldn't have good appetites\nif they knew what's ahead of them. One word! Don't waste missiles! There\nare a lot of Mekin ships. We've got to make each missile count!\"\n\nThere was laughter. He went to the control room. He checked with the\nclock. Shortly after the other watch was back at its stations he\ncalculated carefully. The enemy fleet would break out of overdrive\nshort of Kandar, of course. It would have broken out once before, to\ncorrect its line and estimate the distance to its destination. It would\nhave assembled itself at that breakout point, but it would still arrive\nin a disorderly mob. One's point of arrival could not be too closely\nfigured at the high speeds of overdrive. So when the Mekinese came, they\nwould not be in formation.\n\nBors called the flagship, when the gas-giant planet was in line and a\nbarrier against the radio waves. King Humphrey's voice came from the\nspeaker by Bors's side.\n\n\"_Bors? What?_\"\n\n\"Majesty,\" said Bors. \"Talents, Incorporated says the enemy fleet will\nbreak out of overdrive in just about ten minutes. We're out here waiting\nfor it, instead of aground as they'll expect. They'll break out in\ncomplete confusion. Even with great luck, they'll lose time assembling\ninto combat formation. Being out here, we may be able to hit them before\nthey're organized.\"\n\nA pause.\n\n\"_I've been discussing tactics with the high command_,\" said the king's\nvoice. \"_There's some dispute. The classic tactic is to try for\nenglobement._\"\n\n\"I want to point out, Majesty,\" Bors interrupted urgently, \"that when we\ncross the north pole again, we're apt to detect the fleet signalling\nfrantically to itself, sorting itself out, trying to get into some sort\nof order. It'll be stirred up as if with a spoon. But if we come around\nthe planet's pole--and they don't expect us to be out here waiting for\nthem--we'll be in combat-ready formation. We may be able to tear into\nthem as an organized unit before they can begin to co-operate with each\nother.\"\n\nA longer pause. Then King Humphrey said grimly;\n\n\"_There is one weak point in your proposal, Bors. Only one. It is that\nTalents, Incorporated may be wrong about the time of breakout. The more\nI think, the less I believe in what they have done, or even what I saw!\nBut we'll be prepared, however unlikely your idea. We'll be ready._\"\n\nHe clicked off. Only minutes later, the combat-alert order came through.\nIn the next ten minutes, Bors's ship hummed for five, was quiet for\nthree, and then, two minutes early, all inner compartment doors closed\nquietly and there was that muffled stillness which meant that everybody\nwas ready for anything that might happen.\n\nIn the control room, Bors watched out of a direct-vision port, giving\noccasional glances to the screens. There were flecks of light from\ninnumerable stars. Then the shining cloud-bank of the gas-giant planet\nwent black. Screens showed all of the fleet--each blip with a nimbus\nabout it which identified it as a friend, not a foe. There was the blip\nof the leading ship, the \"point\" of the formation. There were the\nflanking ships and all the martial array of the fleet.\n\nThen the screens sparkled with seemingly hundreds of blips which seemed\nto swirl and spin and whirl again in total and disordered confusion.\n\nGongs clanged. A voice said, \"_Co-o-ntact! Enemy fleet ahead. Wide\ndispersion. They're milling about like gnats on a sunny day!_\"\n\nA curt and authoritative and well-recognized voice snapped, \"_All ships\nkeep formation on flagship. Course coordinates...._\" The voice gave\nthem. \"_There's a clump of enemy ships beginning to organize! We hit\nthem!_\"\n\nThe fleet of Kandar came around the gas-giant world and flung itself at\nthe fleet of Mekin. It seemed that everything was subject to intolerable\ndelay. For long, sweating, unbearable minutes nothing happened except\nthat the fleet of Kandar went hurtling through space with no sensation\nor direct evidence of motion. The gas-giant planet dwindled, but not\nvery fast. The bright specks on the screens which were enemy ships\nseemed to separate as they drew nearer. But all happened with infinite\nand infuriating deliberation.\n\nIt was worth waiting for. There was truly a clumping of enemy ships\nahead. Some of them were less than ten miles apart. In a\ntwo-hundred-mile sphere there were forty ships. They'd been moving to\nconsolidate themselves into a mutually assisting group. What they\naccomplished was the provision of a fine accumulation of targets. Before\nthey could organize themselves, the Kandarian fleet swept through them.\nIt vastly outnumbered them in this area.\n\nIt smashed them. Bombs flashed in emptiness. There were gas-clouds and\nsmoke-clouds which stayed behind in space as the fleet went on.\n\n\"_New coordinates_,\" said the familiar authoritative voice. It gave\nthem. \"_There's another enemy condensation. We hit it!_\"\n\nThe fleet swung in space. It drove on and on and on. Interminable time\npassed. Then there were flashes brighter than the stars. A Kandar\ncruiser blew up soundlessly. But far, far away other things detonated,\nand what had been proud structures of steel and beryllium, armed and\nmanned, became mere incandescent vapor.\n\nA third clumping of Mekinese ships. The Kandarian fleet overwhelmed it;\noverrode it; used exactly the tactics the Mekinese might have used. It\nruthlessly made use of its local, concentrated strength. It was\noutnumbered in the whole battle area by not less than ten to one. But\nthe Mekinese fleet was scattered. Where it struck, the Kandarian fleet\nwas four and five, and sometimes twenty, ships to one.\n\nIt was a smaller fleet in every class of ships, but it was compact and\ncontrolled and it made slashing plunges through the dispersed and\nconfused enemy. With ordinary missiles three ships could always destroy\ntwo, and four could destroy three. But in the battle of the gas-giant\nplanet, where there was fighting the Kandarians were never less than two\nto one. They were surrounded by enemies, but when those enemies tried to\ngather together for strength, the mass of murderously-fighting ships of\nKandar swung upon the incipient group and blasted it.\n\nNearly half the Mekinese fleet was out of action before Bors's ship\nfired a single missile. He'd sat in the skipper's chair, and from time\nto time, the course of all the fleet was changed, and he saw that his\nship kept its place rigidly in formation. But he had given not one order\nout of routine before the enemy strength was half gone. Then the\ncommunicator said coldly:\n\n\"_All ships attention! With old-style missiles we could do everything\nwe've accomplished so far. But the Mekinese are refusing battle now.\nThey'll begin to slip away in overdrive if we keep chopping them down in\ngroups. We have to give them a chance or they'll run away. The new\nmissile system works perfectly. All ships break formation. Find your own\nMekinese. Blast them!_\"\n\nBors said in a conversational voice, \"There are three Mekin ships\nyonder. They look like they're willing to start something. We'll take\nthem on.\"\n\nHe pointed carefully to a spot on the screen. His small ship swung away\nfrom the rest of the fleet. It plunged toward a battleship and two heavy\ncruisers who had joined forces and appeared to attempt to rally the\nstill-stronger-than-Kandar invaders.\n\nThey became objects rather than specks upon the screens. They were\nvisible things on the direct-vision ports. Something flashed, and rushed\ntoward the little Kandarian space-can.\n\n\"Fire one, two, three,\" Bors ordered.\n\nThings hurtled on before him. A screen showed that the missiles first\nfired by the enemy went off-course, chasing the later-fired missiles\nfrom the _Isis_. The Mekinese shots had automatically become\ninterceptors when Kandarian missiles attacked their parent ships. But\nthey couldn't anticipate a curved course and their built-in computers\nweren't designed to handle a rate of change of acceleration. The three\nMekinese ships ceased to exist.\n\n\"Let's head yonder,\" said Bors.\n\nHe pointed again, on the screen. Within the radar's range there were\nhundreds of tiny blips. Some were marked with a nimbus apiece. They were\nfriends. Many, many more were not.\n\nThe Mekinese fleet, too, could determine its own numbers in comparison\nto the defending fleet. Pride and rage swept through Mekinese\ncommanders, as they saw the Kandarians deliberately break up their\nformation to get their ships down to the level of the enemy. It was\nunthinkable for a Mekinese ship to refuse single combat! And when two\nand three could combine against a single ship of Kandar....\n\nThe invaders had reason to fight, rather than slip into overdrive. They\nstill outnumbered the ships from Kandar. And for a Mekinese commander to\nflee the battle area without having engaged or fired on an antagonist\nwould be treason. No man who fled without fighting would stay alive.\nThere had to be a recording of battle offered or accepted, or the\nespecially merciless court-martial system of Mekin would take over.\n\nThere was one problem, however, for the Mekinese skippers. When they\nengaged a ship from Kandar, they died. Still, no ship left the scene of\nthe battle to report defeat.\n\nIt was absolute and complete. It was not only a defeat. It was\nannihilation. The Mekinese fleet was destroyed to the last ship, even to\nthe armed transports carrying bureaucrats and police to set up a new\ngovernment on Kandar. Those ships which dared not run away without a\ntoken fight, discovered the fleet of Kandar wasn't fighting a token\nbattle. It had started out to be just that, but somehow the plans had\nchanged when the fighting started. For the aggressors, it was disaster.\n\nWhen his fleet reassembled, King Humphrey issued a general order to all\nships. He read it in person, his voice strained and dead and hopeless.\n\n\"_I have to express my admiration for the men of my fleet_,\" he said\ndrearily. \"_An unexampled victory over unexampled odds is not only in\nkeeping with the best traditions of the armed forces of Kandar, but\nraises those traditions to the highest possible level of valor and\ndevotion. If it were not that in winning this victory we have doomed our\nhome world to destruction, I would be as happy as I am, reluctantly,\nproud...._\"\n\n\n\n\n_Part Two_\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n\nNobody had ever found any use for the Glamis solar system. There was a\nsun of highly irregular variability. There were two planets, of which\nthe one farther out might have been useful for colonization except that\nit was subject to extreme changes of climate as its undependable sun\nburned brightly or dimly. The nearer planet was so close to its primary\nthat it had long ceased to rotate. One hemisphere, forever in sunshine,\nremained in a low, red heat. Its night hemisphere, in perpetual\ndarkness, had radiated away its heat until there were mountains of\nfrozen atmosphere piled above what should have been a mineral surface.\nIt was a matter of record that a hundred standard years before, a ship\nhad landed there and mined oxygen-containing snow, which its air\napparatus was able to refine so the crew could breathe while they\nfinished some rather improbable repairs and could go on to more\nhospitable worlds.\n\nThe farther-out planet was sometimes a place of green vegetation and\nsprawling seas, and sometimes of humid jungles with most of its oceans\nturned to a cloud-bank of impenetrable thickness. Also, sometimes, it\nwas frozen waste from pole to pole. The vegetation of that planet had\nbeen studied with interest, but the world itself was simply of no use to\nanybody. Even the sun of the Glamis system was regarded with suspicion.\n\nThe fleet of Kandar made rendezvous at the galactic-north pole of the\nsecond planet. On arrival the massed cruisers and battleships went into\norbit. The smaller craft went on a scouting mission, verifying that\nthere was no new colony planted, that there was no man-made radiation\nanywhere in the system, that there was no likelihood of the fleet's\npresence--or for that matter its continued existence--becoming known to\nanybody not of its ship-crews.\n\nThe scout-ships came back, reporting all clear. The great ships drew\nclose to one another and small space-boats shuttled back and forth,\ntaking commanders and captains and vice-admirals to the ship, which, by\nconvention, was commanded by King Humphrey VIII of Kandar.\n\nCaptain Bors got to the conference late. There were some grave faces\nabout the conference room, but there were also some whose expressions\nwere unregenerate and grimly satisfied. As he entered the room the king\nwas speaking.\n\n\"I don't deny that it was a splendid victory, but I'm saying that our\nvictory was a catastrophe! To begin with, we happened to hit the\nMekinese fleet when it was dispersed and disorganized. That was great\ngood fortune--_if_ we'd wanted a victory. The enemy was scattered over\nlight-minutes of space. His ships could not act as a massed,\nmaneuverable force. They were simply a mob of fighting ships who had to\nfight as individuals against our combat formation.\"\n\n\"Yes, Majesty,\" said the gray vice-admiral, \"but even when we broke\nformation--\"\n\n\"Again,\" said the king, more fretfully still, \"I do not deny that the\nfighting ability of our ships was multiplied by the new way of using\nmissiles. What I do say is that if we'd come upon the Mekinese fleet in\ncombat formation instead of dispersed; if we'd attacked them when they\nwere ready for us, it would be doubtful that we'd have been so\ndisastrously successful! Say that the new missile settings gave each of\nour ships fire-power as effective as two or three or five of the enemy.\nThe enemy was ten to one! If we hadn't hit them when they were in\nconfusion, we'd have been wiped out. And if we'd hit their fleet anyhow,\nwe'd be dead. We did not hit the main fleet. We annihilated a division\nof it, a small part. We are still hopelessly inferior to the vast\nMekinese fleet.\"\n\nBors took a seat at the rear of the room.\n\nA stout rear-admiral said somberly, \"We hope we annihilated it, Majesty.\nThere's no report of any ship fleeing in overdrive. But if any did\nescape, its report would lead to an immediate discovery of the exact\nimprovement in our missiles. I am saying, Majesty, that if one enemy\nship escaped that battle, we can look for all the enemy ships to be\nequipped with revised missiles like ours.\"\n\nBors raised his voice. \"May I speak?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the king. \"Bors. By all means.\"\n\n\"I make two points,\" said Bors with reserve. \"One is that the Mekinese\nare as likely to think our missiles captured theirs as that they were\nuncomputable. Missile designers have been trying for years to create\ninterceptors which capture enemy missiles. The Mekinese may decide we've\naccomplished something they've failed at, but they're not likely to\nthink we've accomplished something they never even thought of!\"\n\nVoices babbled. A pompous voice said firmly that nobody would be so\nabsurd. Several others said urgently that it was very likely. All\ndefense departments had research in progress, working on the capture of\nenemy missiles. If it were accomplished, ships could be destroyed as a\nmatter of routine.\n\nBors waited until the king thumped on the table for silence.\n\n\"The second thing I have to say, Majesty, is that there can be no plans\nmade until we know what we have to do. And that depends on what Mekin\nthinks has happened. Maybe no enemy ship got home. Maybe some ships took\nback inaccurate reports. It would be very uncomfortable for them to\nreport the truth. Maybe they said we had some new and marvellous weapon\nwhich no fleet could resist. In that case, we are in a very fine\nposition.\"\n\nThe king said gloomily, \"You think of abominably clever things, Captain.\nBut I am afraid we've been too clever. If Mekin masses its entire fleet\nto destroy us, they can do it, new missile-system or no new\nmissile-system! We have somehow to keep them from resolving to do just\nthat!\"\n\n\"Which,\" said Bors, \"may mean negotiation. But there's no point in\nnegotiating unless you know what your enemy thinks you've got. We could\nhave Mekin scared!\"\n\nThere was a murmur, which could not be said to be either agreement or\ndisagreement. The king looked about him.\n\n\"We cannot continue to fight!\" he said sternly, \"not unless we can\ndefend Kandar--which we can't as against the Mekinese main fleet. We\nwere prepared to sacrifice our lives to earn respect for our world, and\nto leave a tradition behind us. We must still be prepared to sacrifice\neven our vanity.\"\n\nThe vice-admiral said, \"But one sacrifices, Majesty, to achieve. Do you\nbelieve that Mekin will honor any treaty one second after it ceases to\nbe profitable to Mekin?\"\n\n\"That,\" said the king, \"has to be thought about. But Bors is right on\none point. We should come to no final conclusion without information--\"\n\n\"Majesty,\" Bors interrupted. His words came slowly, as if an idea were\nforming as he spoke. \"The enemy may have no news at all. They may know\nthey've been defeated, but they'd _never_ expect _our_ freedom from\nloss. Why couldn't a single Kandarian ship turn up at some port where\nits appearance would surely be reported to Mekin? It could pose as the\nsole survivor of our fleet, which would indicate that the rest of us\nwere wiped out in the battle. If we _had_ all been wiped out, there'd be\nno point in their fusion-bombing Kandar. Certainly they expected us to\nbe destroyed. One surviving ship can prove that we _have_ been!\"\n\nThe king's expression brightened.\n\n\"Ah! And we can go and intern ourselves--\"\n\nThere was a growl. The pompous voice said, \"We would gain time, Majesty.\nOur fear is that Mekin may feel it must avenge a defeat. But if one ship\nclaims to be the sole survivor of our fleet, it announces a Mekinese\nvictory. That is a highly desirable thing!\"\n\nThe king nodded.\n\n\"Yes-s-s.... We were unwise to survive the battle. We can hide our\nunwisdom. Captain Bors, I will give you orders presently. As of now, I\nwill accept reports on battle-damage given and received.\" As Bors\nsaluted and turned to the door, the king added, \"I will be with the\nPretender presently.\"\n\nIt was an order and Bors obeyed it. He went to find his uncle. He found\nthe former monarch in the king's cabin of this, the largest ship of the\nfleet. The Pretender greeted Bors unhappily.\n\n\"A very bad business,\" he observed.\n\n\"Bad,\" agreed Bors. \"But for the two of us, a defeat for Mekin is not\nbad news.\"\n\n\"For us and Tralee,\" the old man said reprovingly, \"there is some\npleasure. But it is still bad. Every ship we destroyed must be replaced.\nLike every other subject planet, Tralee will be required to build--how\nmany ships? Ten? Twenty? We have increased the burden Mekin lays on\nTralee. And worse--much worse--\"\n\n\"There's such a thing,\" protested Bors, \"as using a microscope on\ntroubles! We did something we badly wanted to! If we can keep it up--\"\n\nThe Pretender said, \"How is the food-supply on your ship? How long can\nyou feed your crew without supplies from some base?\"\n\nBors swore. The question had the impact of a blow. His _Isis_, like the\nrest of the fleet, had taken off from Kandar to fight and be destroyed.\nThere were emergency rations on board, of course. But the food-storage\ncompartments hadn't been filled. The fleet did not expect to go on\nliving, so it did not prepare to go on eating. It would have been absurd\nto carry stores for months when they expected to live only hours. It\nsimply hadn't occurred to anyone to load provisions for a long operation\naway from base.\n\n\"That's what the king is worrying about,\" said the Pretender. \"We've\nsome thousands of men who will be hungry presently. If we reveal that we\nsurvived the battle, Mekin's tributaries will begin to think. They might\neven hope--which Mekin would have to stop immediately. If we do not\nreveal that we still exist, what can be done about starving ship-crews?\nIt is a bad business. It would have been much better if the fleet had\nbeen destroyed, as we expected, in a gesture of pure fury over its own\nhelplessness.\"\n\nBors said sardonically, \"We can all commit suicide, of course!\"\n\nThe Pretender did not answer. His nephew sank into a chair and glowered\nat the wall. The situation was contrary to all the illusions cherished\nby the human race. To act decently and with honor is somehow fitting to\na man and consistent with the nature of the universe, so that decency\nand honor may prosper. But recent events denied it. Men who were willing\nto die for their countrymen only injured them by the attempt. And now\nthe conduct which honor would approve turned upon them to bring the\nconsequences of treason and villainy.\n\nA long time passed. Bors sat with clenched hands. It was the barbaric\ninsistence of Mekin upon conquest that was at fault, of course. But this\nhappens everywhere, as it has throughout all history. There are, really,\nthree kinds of people in every community, as there have always been.\nThere are the barbarians, and there are the tribesmen, and there are the\ncivilized. This was true when men lived on only one planet, and\ndoubtless was true when the first village was built. There were\ncivilized men even then. If there was progress, they brought it about.\nAnd in every village there were, and are, tribesmen, men who placidly\naccept the circumstances into which they are born, and who wish no\nchange at all. And everywhere and at all times there are barbarians.\nThey seek personal triumphs. They thrive on high emotional victories.\nAnd at no time will barbarians ever leave either civilized men or\ntribesmen alone. They crave triumphs over them and each other, and they\ncreate disaster everywhere, until they are crushed.\n\nBors said evenly, \"If the king's planning to surrender the fleet to\nMekin as ransom for Kandar, it won't work.\"\n\n\"He's considering it,\" said his uncle. \"It will be a way of giving them\nthe victory we cheated them of, though we didn't intend to win.\"\n\n\"It won't work,\" repeated Bors. \"It won't do a bit of good. They'll want\nto punish Kandar because it wasn't beaten. They feed on destruction and\nbrutality. They're barbarians. The economic interpretation of history\ndoesn't apply here! The Mekinese who run things _want_ to be evil. They\nwill be until they're crushed.\"\n\n\"Crushed?\" asked the Pretender bitterly. \"Is there a chance of that?\"\n\nBors considered gravely. Then he said, \"I think so.\"\n\nThe door opened and the king came in. Bors rose and the king nodded. He\nspoke to the Pretender.\n\n\"Somebody raised the question of food,\" he said. \"There isn't any to\nspeak of, of course. You'd think grown men would face facts! There's not\na man willing to accept what is, and work from that! Lunatics!\"\n\nHe flung himself into a chair.\n\n\"Suggested,\" he continued, \"that a part of the fleet go to Norden to buy\nfood and bring it back. Of course Mekin wouldn't hear about it, wouldn't\nguess at the survival of the fleet because food was bought in such\nquantities! Suggested, that a part of the fleet go to some uncolonized\nplanet and hunt meat. Try to imagine success in that venture! Suggested,\nthat we travel a long distance, pick out a relatively small world, land\nand seize its spaceport and facilities and equip ourselves to bomb Mekin\nto extinction. And do it in a surprise attack! Suggested--\"\n\nThe king shook his head angrily. He did not look royal. He did not look\nconfident. He looked embittered and even helpless. But he still looked\nlike a very honest man trying to make up for his admitted deficiencies.\n\n\"Majesty,\" said Bors.\n\nThe king turned his eyes.\n\n\"You're going to send me off for news,\" said Bors. \"I suggested earlier\nthat my ship pretend to be the sole survivor of the fleet. I suggest\nnow that the ship add the wild and desperate boast that since there's no\nlonger a world which will sponsor it, it's turned pirate. It will take\nvengeance on its own. It defies the might of Mekin and it dares the\nMekinese fleet to do something about it.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the king.\n\n\"Pirates,\" Bors answered, controlling his enthusiasm, \"have to be hunted\ndown. It takes many ships to hunt down a pirate. I should be able to\nkeep a good-sized slice of the Mekinese navy busy simply lying in wait\nfor me here and there.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"There are tribute-ships which carry food from the subject worlds to\nMekin. Hating Mekin as befits the sole survivor of this fleet, Majesty,\nit would be natural for me to capture such ships, even if I could do\nnothing better with them than send them out to space to be wasted. They\nwouldn't be wasted, naturally. They'd come here.\"\n\nThe king said, \"But you couldn't supply the fleet indefinitely!\"\n\nBors nodded agreement. But he waited.\n\n\"You may try,\" said the king querulously. \"Have you something else up\nyour sleeve?\"\n\nBors nodded in his turn.\n\n\"Don't tell me what it is,\" said the king. \"So long as the fleet gets\nsome food and its existence isn't known.... If I knew what you're up to,\nI might feel I had to object.\"\n\n\"I think not, Majesty,\" Bors said, showing a rare smile. \"I'll need some\nextra men. If I do capture food-ships, they'll be useful.\"\n\n\"I can't imagine that anything would be useful,\" said the king bitterly.\n\"Tell the admiral to give them to you.\"\n\nBors saluted and left the room. He went directly to the admiral who in\ntheory was second in command only while the king was aboard. He\nexplained his mission and some of his intentions. The admiral listened\nstonily.\n\n\"I'll give you fifty men,\" he said. \"I think you'll be killed, of\ncourse. But if you live long enough to convince them that the fleet's\nbeen destroyed, you'll be of service.\"\n\n\"What,\" Bors asked, with a trace of humor, \"can possibly be done about\nthe fact that we wiped out a Mekinese fleet instead of letting it\nexterminate us?\"\n\n\"The matter,\" the admiral answered seriously, \"is under consideration.\"\n\nBors shrugged and went to his own ship, the _Isis_. He was excessively\nuncomfortable. He'd said to his uncle, and implied to the king, that he\nhad some plan in mind. He did, but it angered him to know that he\ncounted on assistance; that, in theory, he could not possibly accomplish\nit alone. It was irritating to realize that he expected Gwenlyn and her\nfather to turn up, with their Talents, when absolutely nobody outside of\nthe fleet could possibly imagine where the fleet had gone. On Kandar it\nmust be assumed, by now, that it was dead.\n\nHis ship's boat clanked into position in the lifeboat blister. The\nvalves closed on it. A moment later there was a whistling murmur, and\nthe boat's vision-ports clouded over outside and then cleared. He\nstepped out into the ship's atmosphere. His second-in-command greeted\nhim in the control-room.\n\n\"I was trying to reach you at the flagship, sir,\" he said. \"The yacht\n_Sylva_ is lying a few miles off. Her owner has forwarded news reports\nto the flagship. He asks that you receive him when you can, sir.\"\n\nBors's apparent lack of surprise was real. He wasn't surprised. But he\nwas annoyed with himself for expecting something so impossible as the\n_Sylva_ tracing the fleet through an overdrive voyage of days to a most\nunlikely destination like Glamis.\n\n\"Tell him to come aboard,\" he commanded.\n\nHe went to talk to the mess officer, reflecting that he would ask the\nMorgans how the _Sylva_ had known where to come, and they'd tell him,\nand it would be extremely unlikely, and he would accept the explanation.\nThe mess-officer looked harassed at the news of fifty additional crewmen\nto be fed.\n\n\"Principles of prudence and common sense,\" said Bors, \"don't apply any\nmore. We'll feed them somehow.\"\n\nHe went back to the control-room. When Morgan appeared, beaming\nexpansively, Bors was again unsurprised to see Gwenlyn with him. Logan,\nthe Mathematics Talent, followed in their wake, looking indifferently\nabout him.\n\n\"We wiped out the fleet headed for Kandar,\" Bors observed. \"I don't\nsuppose that's news, to you?\"\n\nMorgan cheerfully shook his head.\n\n\"And we're in considerably more trouble than before. Is that news?\"\n\n\"No,\" admitted Morgan. \"It's reasonable for you to be.\"\n\n\"Then, damnit, I'm going off on a pirating-news-gathering-food-raiding\ncruise alone,\" said Bors. \"Is that news?\"\n\n\"We brought Logan,\" said Morgan, \"to go with you. He'll be useful.\nThat's Talents--\"\n\n\"--Incorporated information and I can depend on it,\" said Bors dourly.\n\"In plain common sense the odds are rather high against my accomplishing\nanything, such as coming back.\"\n\nMorgan looked at his daughter. He grinned.\n\n\"We heard gloom from him the other day before a certain space-battle,\ndidn't we?\" He turned back to Bors. \"Look, Captain. Our Talents don't\nprophesy. Precognition simply says that when there are so many thousand\nways an event in the future can happen, then, in one of those several\nthousand ways, it will. Precognition doesn't say which way. It doesn't\nsay how. Especially, it doesn't say why. But we have a very firm\nprecognition by a very reliable Talent that you'll be alive and doing\nsomething very specific a year from now. So we assume you won't be\npermanently killed in the meantime.\"\n\n\"But anything else can happen?\"\n\n\"More or less,\" admitted Morgan.\n\n\"What will happen?\"\n\n\"We don't know!\" said Morgan again. \"Someday I may take you aside and\nexplain the facts of precognition and other talents as I understand\nthem. I'm probably quite wrong. But I do know better than to try to pry\ncertain kinds of information from my Talents. Right now--\"\n\n\"I'm going to try to capture a, what you might call a tribute-ship,\nloaded with food for Mekin.\"\n\n\"Tralee,\" said Morgan with finality. \"You'll try there.\"\n\n\"Will I capture a food-ship there?\" asked Bors.\n\n\"How the devil would I know?\" Morgan snapped.\n\n\"You asked the wrong question,\" said Gwenlyn cheerfully. \"If you asked\nif there's a cargo-ship down on Tralee, loading foodstuffs for Mekin,\nthere can be an answer to that.\"\n\n\"Is there?\"\n\n\"At the moment, yes,\" Morgan answered. \"So the dowsing Talent says.\"\n\n\"Then I'll go there,\" said Bors.\n\n\"I thought you might,\" said Morgan. He looked at his daughter.\n\n\"May I come along?\" asked Gwenlyn. \"With an assortment of Talents? My\nfather's going to have long conferences with the king. He'll need some\nTalents here to work out things. But I could go along on your ship with\na few of the others. We could help a lot.\"\n\n\"No!\" said Bors grimly.\n\n\"I thought not,\" said Morgan. \"Very well. Logan, you'll help Captain\nBors, I'm sure.\"\n\nThe math Talent said offhandedly;\n\n\"Any calculations he needs, of course.\"\n\nHe looked about him with a confident, modestly complacent air.\n\nBors walked with Morgan and his daughter to the airlock. He turned to\nGwenlyn. \"I don't mean to be ungallant, refusing to let you run risks.\"\n\n\"I'm flattered but annoyed,\" Gwenlyn answered. \"It means I'll have to\ntake drastic measures. Luck!\"\n\nShe and her father went into the _Sylva's_ space-boat. The blister doors\nclosed. Bors went back to the control room. He began to set up the\ncomputations for astrogation from the sun of Glamis to the sun of\nTralee. He shortly heard the sound of arrivals via the _Isis's_\nairlock. Presently, his second-in-command reported fifty additional\nhands aboard. They included astrogators, drive-engineers and assorted\nspecialists.\n\nAfter clearance with the flagship, the little warship aimed with\npainstaking exactitude at Tralee's sun, making due allowance for its\nproper motion, Glamis's proper motion, the length of time the light he\naimed by had been on its way, the distance, and the _Isis's_ travel-rate\nin overdrive.\n\nPresently Bors said, \"Overdrive coming!\" and counted down. After \"one\"\nhe pressed a button. There was the singularly unpleasant sensation of\ngoing into overdrive. Then the small fighting ship was alone in its\ncocoon of warped and twisted space. Until it came out again, there was\nno possible way by which any message could reach it or its existence be\ndetected or proved. Theory said, in fact, that the cosmos could explode\nand a ship in overdrive would be unaware of the fact so long as it\nstayed in overdrive.\n\nBut Bors's light cruiser came out where the sun of Tralee was a disk of\nintolerable brilliance, and all the stars in every direction looked\nexactly as usual.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\nThe _Isis_ approached Tralee from the night side, and at a time when the\nplanet's spaceport faced the sun. Tralee was not a base for Mekinese\nwar-craft. To the contrary, it was strictly a conquered world. It was\ndesirable for Mekinese ships to be able to appear as if magically and\nwithout warning in its skies. There would be no far-ranging radars on\nthe planet except at its solitary spaceport. Mekinese ships could come\nout of overdrive, time a solar-system-drive approach to arrive at\nTralee's atmosphere in darkness, and be hovering menacingly overhead\nwhen dawn broke. Such an appearance had strong psychological effects\nupon the population.\n\nBors used the same device with modifications.\n\nHis ship plunged out of the sunrise and across half a continent,\ndescending as it flew. When it reached the planet's capital city, there\nhad been less than a minute between the first notification by radar and\nits naked-eye visibility. When it came into sight at the spaceport it\nwas less than four thousand feet high and it went sweeping for the\nlanding-grid at something over mach one. Its emergency-rockets roared.\nIt decelerated smoothly and crossed the upper rim of the great, lacy\nmetal structure with less than a hundred feet to spare. In fractions of\nan additional minute it was precisely aground some fifty yards from the\nspaceport office. Steam and smoke rose furiously from where its\nrocket-flames had played.\n\nLock-doors opened. Briskly moving landing-parties trotted across the\nground toward the grid-control building. There were two ships already in\nthe spaceport. One was a Mekinese guard-ship of approximately the\narmament of the _Isis_. Weapons trained swiftly upon it. Missiles roared\nacross the half-mile of distance. They detonated, chemical explosives\nonly. The Mekinese guard-ship flew apart. What remained was not truly\nidentifiable as a former ship. It was fragments.\n\nBors asked curtly, \"Grid office?\"\n\nThe landing-party was inside. A small tumult came out of a speaker. A\nvoice said:\n\n\"_All secure in the grid office, sir._\"\n\n\"Hook in to planetary broadcast, declare a first-priority emergency, and\nrun your tape,\" commanded Bors.\n\nHe said over the ship's speakers, \"Everything going well so far. Prize\ncrew, take the cargo-ship. Keep the crew aboard. Then report.\"\n\nTen men poured out of the grounded light cruiser's starboard port and\ntrotted on the double toward the other ship aground. The weapons on\nBors's ship did not bear upon it.\n\nThe sun shone. Clouds drifted tranquilly across the sky. Masses of smoke\nfrom the demolition-missiles that had smashed the guard-ship rose,\ncurled and very slowly dissipated. Ten men entered the bulbous\ncargo-ship.\n\nUp to now the entire affair had consumed not more than five minutes,\nfrom the appearance of a blip on a spaceport radar screen, to the\nbeginning of a full-volume broadcast. Bors turned on the receiver and\nlistened to the harsh voice--especially chosen from among the\ncrew--which now came out of every operating broadcast receiver on the\nplanet.\n\n\"_Notice to the people of Tralee! There is aground on Tralee a ship with\nno home planet nor any loyalty except to its hatred of Mekin. We were\npart of the fleet of Kandar until that fleet was destroyed. Now we fight\nMekin alone! We are pirates. We are outcasts. But we still have arms to\ndefend ourselves with! We demand...._\"\n\nA voice said curtly in Bors's ear, \"Cargo-ship secured, sir.\"\n\n\"Take off on rockets and maneuver as ordered,\" said Bors. \"Then\nrendezvous as arranged.\"\n\nHe returned his attention to the broadcast. It was a deliberately\nsavage, painstakingly desperate, carefully terrifying message to the\npeople of Tralee. It demanded supplies and arms on threat of destroying\nthe city around it. A single one of its combat-missiles, as a matter of\nfact, could have done a good job of destruction on this metropolis.\n\nThe broadcast would be a shattering experience to men who had reconciled\nthemselves to subjugation by the rulers of Mekin. The planet Tralee was\nnow governed for the benefit of Mekin by the kind of men who would do\nsuch work. They knew that they could stay in office only so long as\nMekin upheld them. To hear their protectors denounced if only by a\nsingle voice....\n\nThere was a monstrous roaring outside. The cargo-ship took off for the\nskies. It was a thousand feet high before the weapons on the _Isis_\nstirred. It seemed to those below that the pirate crew was taken\nunawares by the cargo-ship's escape. That was part of Bors's plan.\n\nA weapon of the grounded _Isis_ roared. A missile hurtled after the\nfugitive, and missed. It went on past its apparent target and did not\neven detonate at nearest proximity, as it should have done. It vanished,\nand the cargo-ship continued to rise in seemingly panicky fashion. It\nslanted from its headlong lift, and curved away and darted for emptiness\nat its maximum acceleration. A second missile from the fighting-ship\nmissed. The cargo-ship dwindled, and dwindled, and now the _Isis_\nappeared to take deliberate measurements of the distance and\nacceleration of its target. It might be assumed that its radars needed\nto be readjusted from the long-range-finding required in space, to the\nshorter-range measurements called for now.\n\nSomething plunged after the fleeing cargo-boat, by now merely a\npin-point in the blue. The rising object moved so swiftly that it was\ninvisible. Then it detonated, and the fumes of the explosion blotted out\nthe fugitive. When they cleared, the sky was empty.\n\nThere had now been a lapse of less than ten minutes from the first\nsighting of the _Isis_ screaming toward the spaceport. The guard-ship\nhad been destroyed and the cargo-ship which seemed to flee had\napparently been destroyed. When someone had leisure to think, it would\nappear that the cargo-boat's crew had overcome the armed party which\nentered it and then taken the foolish course of flight.\n\nBors waited, listening absently. A voice:\n\n\"_All clear on board the prize, sir. The cargo seems to be mostly\nfoodstuffs, sir. Proceeding to rendezvous as ordered. Off._\"\n\nBors nodded automatically and resumed listening to the broadcast.\nMatters were going well. Everything had gone through with the precision\nof clockwork, which meant simply that Bors had planned in detail\nsomething that had never been anticipated and so had not been\ncounter-planned. Before anyone on Tralee realized that anything had\nhappened, everything had happened--the _Isis_ aground, the guard-ship\ndemolished, the grid taken over, and a fleeing cargo-ship apparently\ndestroyed in the upper atmosphere. And a harsh voice now rasped out of\nloudspeakers everywhere, uttering threats, cursing Mekin--few could\nbelieve their ears--and rousing hopes which Bors knew regretfully were\nbound to be disappointed.\n\nThe rasping broadcast cut off in the middle of a syllable. Somebody had\ncome to believe that he really heard what he thought he heard. Now there\nwould be reaction. At the sunrise-line on Tralee only a handful of\npeople were awake. They were dumbfounded. Where people breakfasted, the\nintentionally savage voice made food seem unimportant. Where it was\nmidday, waves of violent emotion swept over the land.\n\n\"Call the defense forces,\" Bors commanded the grid office, by\ntransmitter. \"They'll be Mekinese--Mekinese-officered, anyhow. We don't\nwant them to get ideas of attacking us, so identify us as the pirate\nship _Isis_ and order all police and garrison troops to stay exactly\nwhere they are. Say we've got all our fusion-bombs armed to go off in\ncase of an artillery-fire hit.\"\n\nThis was the most valid of all possible threats against the most\nprobable form of attack. Fusion-bombs could be used against enemies in\nspace, or for the annihilation of a population, but they could not be\nused in police operations against a subject people. To coerce people one\nmust avoid destroying them. So while a ship the size of the _Isis_\ncould--and did--carry enough confined hellfire in its missile warheads\nto destroy an area hundreds of miles across, the occupation troops of\nMekin could not use such weapons. They needed blast-rifles for minor\nthreats and artillery for selective destruction. In any case no sane man\nwould try to destroy the _Isis_ aground after an announcement that its\nbombs were armed, and that they were fused to explode.\n\n\"Now repeat the demand for stores,\" ordered Bors. \"We might as well\nstock up. Speed is essential. We can't use stores they've time to\nbooby-trap or poison. Give them twenty minutes to start the stuff\narriving. Demand fuel, extra rocket-fuel especially. Remind them about\nour bombs.\"\n\nHe waited. Speakers beside him could inform him of any action anywhere\noutside or inside the ship. The landing-party in the spaceport building\nreported as it went through the spaceport records, picking up such\ninformation concerning Mekinese commercial regulations,\nidentification-calls and anticipated ship-movements as might prove\nuseful elsewhere. The rasping voice began to broadcast again. It went on\nfor fifteen seconds and cut off.\n\n\"Tell the government broadcasting system that if they stop relaying our\nbroadcast,\" said Bors, \"we'll heave a bomb into the police barracks and\nthe supply-depots.\"\n\nHe heard the threat issued and very soon thereafter an agitated voice\nannounced to the people of Tralee that a pirate ship was in possession\nof the planet's spaceport and that it insisted upon broadcasting to the\nplanet's people. It was considered unwise to refuse. Therefore the\nbroadcast would continue, but of course citizens could turn off their\nsets.\n\nThere came a roar of anger and the harsh-voiced broadcaster returned to\nthe air. His taped broadcast had run out. Now he bellowed such\nsubversive profanity directed at the officials of Tralee-under-Mekin\nthat Bors smiled sourly. It was not good for Mekinese prestige to have a\nsubject people know that one ship could defy the empire, even for\nminutes. It was still less desirable to have the members of the puppet\ngovernment described as dogs of particularly described breeds, of\nparticularly described characteristics, and particular lack of\nlegitimacy. Bors had chosen for his broadcast a man of vivid imagination\nand large vocabulary. He did not want the _Isis_ to appear under\ndiscipline, lest it seem to act under orders. He wanted to create the\nimpression of men turned pirates because everything they lived for had\nbeen destroyed, and who now were running amok among the planets Mekin\nhad subjugated.\n\nThe broadcast was not incitement to revolt, because Bors's ship was\nposing as the only survivor of a planet's fleet. But it conveyed such\ncontempt and derision and hatred of all things Mekinese that for months\nto come men would whisper jokes based on what an _Isis_ crewman had said\non Tralee's air. The respect the planet's officials craved would drop\nbelow its former low level.\n\nTime passed. Bors, of course, could not send a landing-party anywhere,\nlest it be sniped. He had actually accomplished the purpose for which\nhe'd landed, the getting of a shipload of food out to space, the\nannouncement of the destruction of Kandar's fleet and the spreading of\ncontempt and derision for Mekin in Tralee. Now he had to keep anyone\nfrom suspecting the importance of the cargo-ship. The demand for stores\nwas a cover-up for things already done. But that cover-up had to be\ncompleted.\n\nVehicles appeared at the edge of the landing-grid. Figures advanced\nindividually, waving white flags. Bors sent men out with small arms to\nget their messages. These were the supplies he'd demanded. Food.\nRocket-fuel. More food.\n\nThe vehicles trundled into the open and stopped. Men from the _Isis_\nwaved away the drivers and took over the trucks. They brought most of\nthem to the ship's side. A petty-officer came into the control room and\nsaluted.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said briskly. \"One of the drivers told me his load of grub had\ntime-bombs in it. The secret police use time-bombs and booby-traps here,\nsir, to keep the people terrified. He says the bombs will go off after\nwe're out in space, sir.\"\n\n\"What did you do?\" asked Bors.\n\n\"I pretended the truck stalled and I couldn't start it. Two other\ndrivers tipped off our men. We left those trucks and some others out on\nthe field, so the drivers wouldn't be suspected of alerting us.\"\n\n\"Good work,\" said Bors. \"Better put detectors on all parcels from all\ntrucks before bringing them aboard.\"\n\n\"Booby-traps can be made very tricky indeed, but when they are used by\nsecret police....\" Bors allowed himself to rage for a moment only, at\nthe idea of that kind of terrorism practiced by a government on its\nsupposed citizens. It would be intended to enforce the totalitarian idea\nthat what is not commanded for the ordinary citizen to do is forbidden\nto him. But secret-police booby-traps and time-bombs would be\nstandardized. He hadn't allowed time for complex, detection-proof\ndevices to be made. Detectors would pick out any ordinary trickery.\n\nThe harsh-voiced broadcaster continued to harangue the population of\nTralee, of which the least of his words was high treason. They enjoyed\nthe broadcast very much.\n\nPresently Bors began to fidget. The _Isis_ had been aground for\nthirty-five minutes. He had sat in the control room that whole time,\nsupervising a smoothly-running operation. He had had to supervise it.\nNobody else could have planned and carried it out. But it was not\nheroic. He had the line officer's inherent scorn for administrative\nofficers, who are necessary but not glamorous or admired. He was stuck\nwith just that kind of duty now. But he fretted. The local officials\nwere given time to get over their panic. They ought to be planning some\ncounter-measure by this time.\n\nHe called the spaceport office.\n\n\"There should be a map of the city somewhere about,\" he said crisply.\n\"Send it along special. Bring a communicator call-book. If you find any\nnews-reports, new or old, we want them.\"\n\n\"_Yes, sir_,\" said a brisk voice. \"_The broadcast's right, sir?_\"\n\n\"It is,\" said Bors. \"You're mining the grid set-up. We'll blow it before\nwe leave. There's no point in letting Mekin set down transports loaded\nwith troops to punish innocent people because they heard the Mekinese\naccurately described. Make 'em land on rockets and there won't be so\nmany landing.\"\n\n\"_Yes, sir. Will do, sir._\"\n\nA click. Bors heard heavy materials being loaded aboard. Each object was\nbeing examined by a detector. The loading process stopped. Bors pressed\na button.\n\n\"What happened?\" he demanded.\n\n\"_Looks like a booby-trapped box, sir_,\" said a voice. \"_Among the\nsupplies, sir._\"\n\n\"Take it off a hundred yards and riddle it,\" ordered Bors. \"This may\nsettle a problem for us.\"\n\n\"_Yes, sir._\"\n\nBors fidgeted again. A messenger from the grid-control building arrived.\nHe had a map of the capital city of Tralee.\n\nThere was an explosion. A violent one. Bors looked out a port and saw\nwhere the suspected parcel had been set up as a target a hundred yards\nfrom the ship. It had been riddled with blast-rifle bolts, and had\nexploded. It might not have destroyed the _Isis_ if it had exploded in\nspace, but it would not have done it any good.\n\nBors pushed the button for the loading-port compartment.\n\n\"Throw out all the stuff loaded so far,\" he commanded. \"Some of it may\nbe booby-trapped like that last one. We won't take a chance. Heave it\nall out again.\"\n\n\"_Yes, sir._\"\n\nBors gave other orders. The harsh-voiced broadcast stopped. Bors's own\nvoice went out on the air, steely-hard.\n\n\"Captain Bors, pirate ship _Isis_ speaking,\" he said coldly. \"We\ndemanded supplies. They were sent us--government-supplied. We have found\none booby-trap included. In retaliation for this attempted\nassassination, we are going to lob chemical-explosive missiles into the\nprincipal government buildings of this city. We give three minutes'\nleeway for clerks and other persons to get clear of those buildings. The\nthree minutes start now!\"\n\nThe sun shone tranquilly on the planet Tralee. White clouds floated with\ninfinite leisureliness across the blue sky. There was no motion of any\nsort within the wide, open area of the landing-grid. Over a large part\nof this world's surface all activity had stopped while men listened to a\nbroadcast.\n\n\"Fifteen seconds gone,\" said Bors icily.\n\nHe wrote out an order and passed it for execution.\n\n\"Thirty seconds gone.\"\n\nFrom twenty giant buildings in the city, a black tide of running figures\nbegan to pour. When they reached the street, they went on running. They\nwanted to get as far as possible from the buildings Bors had said would\nbe destroyed.\n\n\"Forty-five seconds gone,\" said Bors implacably.\n\nA voice spoke from the grid-control building, where men were now\nplacing explosives with precisely calculated effects. The voice came on\nmicrowaves to the ship.\n\n\"_Sir_,\" said the voice, \"_landing-grid reporting. Space-yacht_ Sylva\n_reports breakout from overdrive and asks coordinates for landing.\nPurpose of visit, pleasure-travel._\"\n\nBors swore, then smiled to himself. Gwenlyn had threatened to do\nsomething drastic!\n\n\"Say landing's forbidden,\" he commanded an instant later. \"Advise\nimmediate departure.\"\n\nHe pressed a button and said evenly:\n\n\"One minute gone! In two minutes more we send our bombs and take off.\"\n\nStreets outside the government buildings were filled from building-wall\nto building-wall by clerks drafted to staff the incredible, arbitrary\ngovernment set up on its tributary worlds by Mekin. Bors scribbled a\nlist of buildings to be ranged on. The map from the spaceport office\nwould help. He marked the Ministry of Police, which would contain the\nrecords essential to the operation of the planet-wide police system.\nAnything that happened to those records would be so much good fortune\nfor Tralee, and so much bad for the master race and its quislings. He\nmarked the Ministry of the Interior, which would house the machinery for\nrequisitions of tribute to Mekin. The Ministry of Public Order would be\nthe headquarters of the secret and the political police. It ran the\nforced-labor camps. It filed all anonymous accusations. It kept records\non all persons suspected of the crime of patriotism. If anything\nhappened to those records, it would be all to the good.\n\n\"Two minutes gone,\" said Bors.\n\nThe voice from the spaceport control building said briskly:\n\n\"_Demolition charges placed, sir. Ready to evacuate and fire. Sir, the\nspace-yacht_ Sylva _sends a message to the captain of the pirate ship.\nIt says they'll wait._\"\n\nBors said, \"Damn! All right.\" Then into the broadcast-microphone,\n\"Two-and-a-half minutes. There will be no further count-down. In thirty\nseconds we fire missiles into government buildings, in retaliation for\nan attempt to assassinate us with time-bombs. The next sound you hear\nwill be our missiles arriving.\" He cut back to the grid-control\nbuilding. \"Fire all charges and report to the ship.\"\n\nAlmost instantly curt, crisp reports sounded nearby. The landing-party\ncame smartly back to the airlock, while explosions continued in the\nbuilding they'd left.\n\n\"Launcher-tubes train on targets,\" Bors commanded. He pressed another\nbutton. \"Rocket-room, make ready for lift.\" Back to the launcher-tube\ncommunicator. \"Fire missiles one, two, three, four, five, six.\"\n\nThere were boomings, which rose to bellowings as devastation tore away\nfrom the _Isis's_ launching-tubes. Bors said irritably to the\nrocket-room:\n\n\"Take her up!\"\n\nAnd then the ship lifted on her rockets--they were not solely for\nemergency use, as on cargo-ships--and rushed toward the sky. As the ship\nmounted on its column of writhing smoke, other smoky columns spouted up.\nSix of them. But they were limited. They went up two thousand feet and\nthen tended to mushroom. Bits of debris went higher and spread more\nwidely, and for a time there were fragments of buildings and their\ncontents flying wildly about.\n\nBut the ship went straight upward. The city and the open country beyond\nit shrank swiftly. The spouted smokes of explosions in the city were\nleft behind. Mountains appeared at one horizon and a sea at another.\nThen the vast expanse of the planet suddenly acquired a curved edge, and\nthe ship again went up and up--while the sky turned dark and some stars\nappeared in futile competition with the sun--and the surface of Tralee\nbecame visibly the near side of an enormous globe.\n\nThen the planet became plainly what it was, a great ball floating in\nspace, one-half of it brilliant in the sunshine and one part of it\nbathed in night.\n\nBors put on the solar-system drive and changed course. A voice came\nthrough:\n\n\"_Calling pirate ship ... calling pirate ship.... Space yacht_ Sylva\n_calling pirate ship...._\"\n\nBors growled into a microphone, \"What the devil are you doing in this\nplace. What's happened?\"\n\nGwenlyn's voice, bland and amused. \"_Nothing happened. But we've got\nsome news for you. Make rendezvous at the fourth planet?_\"\n\nBors swore again. That was where he was to meet the cargo-ship captured\nand sent aloft, supposedly destroyed on Tralee. But he drove on out,\naround and away from Tralee.\n\nHe was reasonably satisfied with his landing on Tralee. With some luck,\nthe news of the landing of a lone survivor of the Kandarian fleet might\nreach Mekin before it was aware of what had happened to its occupation\nforce. With a little more luck, the attention of Mekin would be devoted\nmore to a ship which dared to turn pirate than to Kandar itself. With\nunlimited favorable fortune, Mekin might actually send ships to hunt the\n_Isis_ instead of asking questions on Kandar.\n\nBut Bors made a mental note. The more time that passed before Mekin knew\nwhat had happened, the better. So a ship or two or three might be\ndetached from the fleet and sent back to hang off Kandar. If a single\nship came inquiringly, it might be sniped and the news of Kandar\nsuppressed for a while longer. And it was conceivable that Mekin might\ncome to worry more about other matters than the success or failure of a\nroutine expansion of its empire.\n\nThe fourth planet loomed up on schedule. Bors was irritated, as often\nbefore, by the relatively slow solar-system drive. Overdrive was\nsometimes not fast enough--but solar-system drive was infuriatingly\nslow. Yet one couldn't use overdrive in a solar system. Approaching a\nplanet on overdrive would be like trying to garage a ground-car at sixty\nmiles an hour. One couldn't stop where one wanted to. He wondered\nvaguely if Logan, the math Talent, could handle such a problem, and\ndismissed the idea. One could break a circuit with an accuracy of\nmicroseconds, but that wouldn't be close enough for overdrive. It\nwouldn't be practical.\n\nThen the ice-sheet of Tralee's nearest neighbor planet spread out in the\nvision-port's range of view. Bors called for the cargo-ship. It answered\nalmost immediately. It was standard practice, of course, that the site\nof a meeting planned at a given planet would be wherever its poles\npointed nearest to galactic north. The cargo-ship had just arrived. It\nbarely responded before the _Sylva_ began to call again.\n\nThe three ships, then, joined their orbits and went swinging about the\nglacier-world beneath them while they conferred.\n\nThe report from the cargo-ship was unexpectedly satisfactory. It had\nbeen almost completely loaded, and its cargo was largely foodstuffs\nintended for Mekin. Kandar's fleet-in-hiding was already subsisting on\nemergency rations. This cargo of assorted frozen foods would be welcome.\nBors gave orders for it to head for Glamis immediately, in overdrive.\n\nCommunication had been three-way, and Gwenlyn said quickly;\n\n\"_Just a moment! Did you pick up any news-reports on Tralee?_\"\n\n\"Hm. Yes. I'd better send them--\"\n\n\"_You'd better?_\" echoed Gwenlyn, scolding. \"_My father stayed with the\nfleet to try to explain what Talents, Incorporated can do! He kept most\nof the Talents with him, for demonstrations! The Department for\nPredicting Dirty Tricks is there! Don't you remember what that\nDepartment works on? Of course you've got to send those news-reports!_\"\n\nBors ordered a space-boat to come from the cargo-ship for the reports.\n\n\"_Would you like to come to dinner on the yacht?_\" asked Gwenlyn.\n\"_You're all living on emergency rations. Nobody asked us to divide our\nsupplies with the fleet. I can give you a nice meal._\"\n\n\"Better not,\" said Bors curtly, and mumbled thanks.\n\nHe ordered the cargo-ship to send as much of its stores as the\nspace-boat could conveniently carry.\n\n\"_Then how about some cigars?_\" asked Gwenlyn. She seemed at once amused\nand approving, because Bors would not indulge himself in a really\nsatisfying meal while his crew lived on far from appetizing emergency\nfoodstuffs.\n\n\"No,\" said Bors. \"No cigars either. You said you had some news for me.\nWhat is it?\"\n\n\"_I brought along our ship-arrival Talent_,\" said Gwenlyn blandly. \"_He\ncan only tell when a ship will arrive at the solar system where he is,\nso he had to come here to precognize._\"\n\nBors felt again that stubborn incredulity which Talents, Incorporated\nwould always rouse in a mind like his.\n\n\"_There'll be a ship arriving here in two days, four hours, sixteen\nminutes from now_,\" said Gwenlyn matter-of-factly. \"_He thinks it's a\nfighting ship, though he can't be sure. It could be a cruiser or\nsomething like that doing mail duty, coming to deliver orders and\nreceive reports. You can't run an empire without a regular news system,\nand Mekin wouldn't depend on commercial ships for government business._\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Bors. \"Thanks!\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"_What will you do now?_\"\n\n\"Try to raise the devil somewhere else,\" said Bors. \"Try to pick up\nanother food-ship, probably. Maybe I ought to let this ship alone, to\ncarry news of the pirate ship _Isis_ back to Mekin, but-- No. They use\nbooby-traps as police devices!\"\n\nIt was not reasonable, but Bors could not think of missing a Mekinese\nwarship. The idea of a government using booby-traps to enforce its\norders somehow put it beyond forgiveness, and with the government all\nthose who served it willingly.\n\n\"_You'll go to Garen then?_\" asked Gwenlyn.\n\nBors felt a sharp sting of annoyance. He had carefully kept secret the\nchoice of Garen Three as the next planet to be invaded by the\npseudo-pirate ship. It was upsetting to find that Gwenlyn knew about it.\nBlast Talents, Incorporated!\n\n\"_The dowsing Talent_,\" said Gwenlyn, \"_says there's a battleship\naground there. There've been some riots. The people of Garen don't like\nMekin, either. Strange? The battleship is to overawe them._\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" demanded Bors.\n\n\"_The Department for Predicting Dirty Tricks was reading old\nnews-reports_,\" she told him. \"_We're leaving now. 'Bye._\"\n\n\"Goodbye,\" said Bors, and sighed, not knowing whether he felt regret or\nrelief.\n\nThe space-yacht _Sylva_ flicked out of sight. It had gone into\noverdrive. Bors realized that he hadn't noticed which way it pointed. He\nshould have taken note. But he shook his head. He gave the cargo-ship\ndetailed orders, receiving its space-boat and what food it had been able\nto bring. He sent it off to meet his fleet at Glamis.\n\nHe stayed in orbit around the fourth planet to wait for a Mekinese\nfighting-ship. He began, too, to make long-range plans.\n\n\n\n\n_Part Three_\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\nThe Mekinese ship was a cruiser, and it broke out of overdrive within\nthe Tralee solar system just two days, four hours, and some odd minutes\nafter Gwenlyn predicted its coming. Presumably, it had made the\ncustomary earlier breakout to correct its course and measure the\ndistance remaining to be run. In overdrive there was not as yet a way to\nknow accurately one's actual speed, and at astronomical distances small\nerrors piled up. Correction of line was important, too, because a course\nthat was even a second off arc could mount up to hundreds of thousands\nof miles. But even with that usual previous breakout, the Mekinese\ncruiser did not turn up conveniently close to its destination. It needed\na long solar-system drive to make its planetfall.\n\nBors's long-range radar picked it up before it was near enough to notify\nits arrival to the planet--if it intended to notify at all. Most likely\nits program was simply and frighteningly to appear overhead and\narrogantly demand the services of the landing-grid to lower it to the\nground.\n\nBors's radar detected the cruiser and instantly cut itself off. The cry\nof \"_Co-o-ntact!_\" went through the ship and all inner doors closed,\nsealing the ship into sections. Bors was already at the board in the\ncontrol room. He did not accept the predictions of Talents, Incorporated\nas absolute truth. It bothered him that such irrational means of\nsecuring information should be so accurate. So he compromised in his own\nmind to the point where, when Talents, Incorporated gave specific\ninformation, it was possible; no more. Then, having admitted so much, he\nacted on the mere possibility, and pretended to be surprised when it\nturned out to be a fact.\n\nThat was the case now. A ship had appeared in this solar system at the\ntime the ship-arrival Talent on the _Sylva_ predicted. Bors scowled, and\nswung the _Isis_ in line between Tralee and the new arrival. He turned,\nthen, and drove steadily out toward it. The other ship's screens would\nshow a large blip which was the planet, and in direct line a very much\nsmaller blip which was the _Isis_. The small blip might not be noticed\nbecause it was in line with the larger. If it were noticed, it would be\nconfusing, because such things should not happen. But the cruisers of\nMekin were not apt to be easily alarmed. They represented a great\nempire, all of whose landing-grids were safely controlled, and though\nthere was disaffection everywhere there was no reason to suspect\nrebellion at operations in space.\n\nFor a long time nothing happened. The _Isis_ drove to meet the cruiser.\nThe two vessels should be approaching each other at a rate which was the\ntotal of their speeds. Bors punched computer-keys and got the\ngravitational factor at this distance from Tralee's sun. He set the\n_Isis's_ solar-system drive to that exact quantity. He waited.\n\nHis own radar was now non-operative. Its first discovery-pulse would\nhave been observed by the Mekinese duty-officer. The fact that it did\nnot repeat would be abnormal. The duty-officer would wonder why it\ndidn't come again.\n\nThe astrogation-radar cut off. Then a single strong pulse came. It would\nbe a ranging-pulse. Cargo-ship radars sacrificed high accuracy for wide\nand deep coverage. But war-vessels carried pulse instruments which could\nmeasure distances within feet up to thousands of miles, and by\nphase-scrambling among the echoes even get some information about the\nsize and shape of the object examined. Not much, but some.\n\nBors relaxed. Things were going well. When four other ranging-pulses\narrived at second intervals, he nodded to himself. This was a warship's\nreaction. It could be nothing else. That officer knew that something was\ncoming out from Tralee. It was on approximately a collision course. But\na ship traveling under power should gain velocity as long as its drive\nwas on. When traveling outward from the sun and not under power, it\nshould lose velocity by so many feet per second to the sun's\ngravitational pull. Bors's ship did neither. It displayed the remarkably\nunlikely characteristic of absolutely steady motion. It was not normal.\nIt was not possible. It could not have any reasonable explanation, in\nthe mind of a Mekinese.\n\nWhich was its purpose. It would arouse professional curiosity on the\ncruiser, which would then waste some precious time attempting to\nidentify it. There wouldn't be suspicion because it didn't act\nsuspiciously. Still, it couldn't be dismissed, because it didn't behave\nin any recognizable fashion. The cruiser would want to know more about\nit; it shouldn't move at a steady velocity going outward from a sun.\n\nIn consequence, Bors got in the first shot.\n\nHe said, \"Fire one!\" when the Mekinese would be just about planning to\nturn their electron-telescope upon it. A missile leaped away from the\n_Isis_. It went off at an angle, and it curved madly, and the\ninstrumentation of the cruiser could spot it as now there, now here, now\nnearer, and now nearer still. But the computers could not handle an\nobject which not only changed velocity but changed the rate at which its\nvelocity changed.\n\nMissiles came pouring out of the Mekinese ship. They were infinitesimal,\nbright specks on the radar-screen. They curved violently in flight\ntrying to intercept the _Isis's_ missile. They failed.\n\nThere was a flash of sun-bright flame very, very far away. There was a\nlittle cloud of vapor which dissipated swiftly. Then there was nothing\nbut two or three specks moving at random, their target lost, their\npurpose forgotten. The fact of victory was an anticlimax.\n\n\"All clear,\" said Bors grimly.\n\nThe inner-compartment doors opened. The normal sounds of the ship were\nheard again. Bors began to calculate the data needed for the journey to\nGaren. There was the angle and the distance and the proper motions and\nthe time elapsed.... He found it difficult to think in such terms. He\nwas discontented. He'd ambushed a Mekinese cruiser. True, he'd let his\nown ship be seen, and the Mekinese had warning enough to launch missiles\nin their own defense. It was not even faintly like the ambush of a\ncruiser on the bottom of a Kandarian sea, waiting to assassinate a fleet\nwhen its complement went on board. But Bors didn't like what he'd just\ndone.\n\nThe figures wouldn't come out right. Impatiently, he sent for Logan. The\nmathematical Talent came into the control room.\n\n\"Will you calculate this for me?\" Bors asked irritably.\n\nLogan glanced casually at the figures and wrote down the answer.\nInstantly. Without thought or reflection. Instantly!\n\nBors couldn't quite believe it. The distance between the two stars was a\nrounded-off number, of course. The relative proper motion of the two\nstars had a large plus-or-minus bugger factor. The time-lapse due to\ndistance had a presumed correction and there was a considerable probable\nerror in the speed of translation of the ship during overdrive. It was a\nmoderately complicated equation, and the computation of the probable\nerror was especially tricky. Bors stared at it, and then stared at\nLogan.\n\n\"That's the answer to what you have written there,\" said Logan\ncondescendingly, \"but your figures are off. I've been talking to your\ncomputer men. They've given me the log figures on past overdrive jumps\nand the observed errors on arrival. They're systematic. I noticed it at\nonce.\"\n\nBors said, \"What?\"\n\n\"There's a source of consistent error,\" Logan said patiently. \"I found\nthe values to correct it, then I found the source. It's in your\noverdrive speed.\"\n\nBors blinked. Speed in overdrive could not be computed exactly. The\napproximation was very close--within a fraction of a tenth of one per\ncent--but when the distance traveled was light-years the uncertainty\npiled up.\n\n\"If you use these figures,\" said Logan complacently--and he scribbled\nfigures swiftly--\"you'll get it really accurate.\"\n\nHaving finished writing the equation, he wrote the solution. Bors asked\nsuspicious questions. Logan answered absently. He knew nothing about\noverdrive. He didn't understand anything but numbers and he didn't know\nhow he did what he did with them. But he'd worked backward from observed\nerrors in calculation and found a way to keep them out of the answer.\nAnd he'd done it all in his head. It was unbelievable--yet Bors\nbelieved.\n\n\"I'll try your figures,\" he said. \"Thanks.\"\n\nLogan went proudly away, past an orderly bringing cups of coffee to the\ncontrol room. Bors aimed the ship according to the calculation Logan had\ngiven him, scrupulously setting the breakout timer to the exact figure\nlisted.\n\nHe was still uncomfortable about the destruction of the Mekinese cruiser\nwhen he said curtly, \"Overdrive coming!\" He'd have preferred a more\nsportsmanlike type of warfare. He faced the old, deplorable fact that\nfighting men had had to adjust to throughout the ages; one can fight an\nhonorable enemy honorably, but against some men scruples count as\nhandicaps.\n\n\"Swine!\" growled Bors. \"They'll make us like them!\" Then into the\nmicrophone he said, \"Five, four, three, two, one....\"\n\nHe pressed the overdrive button. The sensation of going into overdrive\nwas acutely uncomfortable, as always. Bors swallowed squeamishly and\ntook his cup of coffee.\n\nThe _Isis_, then, lay wrapped in a cocoon of stressed space. Its\nproperties included the fact that its particular type of stress could\ntravel much more swiftly than the stresses involved in the propagation\nof radiation, of magnetism, or gravity. And this state of stress--this\noverdrive field--did not have a position. It _was_ a position. The ship\ninside it could not be said to be in the real cosmos at all, but when\nthe field collapsed it would be somewhere, and the way it pointed, and\nhow long before collapse, determined in what particular somewhere it\nwould be when it came out. But travel in overdrive was tedious.\n\nAs civilization increases man's control of the cosmos, it takes the fun\nout of it. In prehistoric days a man who had to hunt animals or go\nhungry may often have gone hungry, but he was never bored by the\nsameness of his meals. A man who traveled on horseback often got to his\ndestination late, but he was not troubled with ennui on the way. In\noverdrive, Bors's ship traveled almost with the speed of thought, but\nthere was absolutely nothing to think about while journeying. Not about\nthe journey, anyhow.\n\nWhile the ship drove on, however, the cargo-ship seized on Tralee made\nits way toward Glamis and a meeting with the fleet, then gloomily\nsweeping in orbit around Glamis Two. The food it carried would raise\nmen's spirits a little, but it would not solve the problem of what the\nfleet was to do. Morgan, on the flagship, expounded the ability of his\nTalents to perform the incredible, but nobody could find any application\nof the incredible to the fix the fleet was in. On Kandar, the population\nknew that there had been a battle off the gas-giant planet, but they did\nnot know the result. The Mekinese fleet had not come. The fleet of\nKandar had not returned. The caretaker government met in council and\ndesperately made guesses. It arrived at no hopeful conclusion whatever.\nThe most probable--because most hopeless--conviction seemed to be that\nthe fleet of Mekin had been met and fought, but that it was victorious,\nand in retaliation for resistance it had gone away to send back swarms\nof grisly bomb-carriers which would drop atomic bombs in such quantity\nthat for a thousand years to come there would be no life on Kandar.\n\nThe light cruiser, the _Isis_, was unaware of these frustrations. It\nremained in overdrive, where absolutely nothing happened.\n\nBors reviewed his actions and could not but approve of them tepidly.\nHe'd sent food to the fleet, he'd destroyed two enemy fighting ships and\nhe'd done what he could to harm the Mekinese puppets on Tralee. He'd had\nthem publicly humiliated with well-chosen epithets. He'd destroyed the\nrecords and archives of the secret political police.... Many people on\nTralee already blessed him, without knowing who he was. There might yet\nbe hope of better days.\n\nBut all things end, even journeys at excessively great multiples of the\nspeed of light. The overdrive timer rang warning bells. Taped breakout\nnotifications sounded from speakers throughout the ship. There was a\ncount-down of seconds, and the abominably unpleasant sensation of\nbreakout, and the ship was in normal space again.\n\nThere was the sun of Garen, burning peacefully in a vast void with\nmillions of minute, unwinking lights in the firmament all about it.\nThere was a gas-giant planet, a mere fifteen million miles away. Further\nout there were the smaller, frozen worlds. Nearer the sun, on the far\nside of its orbit, there was the planet Garen.\n\nThe _Isis_ drove for that planet, while Bors tried to decide whether the\nremarkable accuracy of this breakout was due to accident or to Logan's\ncomputations.\n\nLogan appeared as Bors was gloomily contemplating the days needed to\nreach Garen on solar system drive, because overdrive was too fast. Logan\nlooked offhand and elaborately casual, but he fairly glowed with\ntriumph.\n\n\"I found out the fact behind the bugger factor, Captain,\" he said\ncondescendingly. \"The speed of a ship in overdrive varies as the change\nin mass to the minus fourth. Your computers couldn't tell that! Here's a\ntable for calculating the speed of a ship in overdrive according to its\nmass and the strength of the overdrive field.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said Bors without enthusiasm.\n\n\"And to go with it,\" said Logan, his voice indifferent, but his eyes\nshining proudly, \"just for my own amusement, I computed a complete table\nof overdrive speeds for this particular ship, with different strengths\nof field. They run from one point five light-speeds up to the maximum\nyour equipment will give. You have to correct for changes of mass, of\ncourse.\"\n\nBors was not quite capable of enthusiasm over the computation of tables\nof complex figures. He simply could not share Logan's thrill of\nachievement in the results of the neat rows of numerals. Nor had he\nstruggled unduly to grasp the implication of Logan's explanation.\n\nInstead, he said politely, \"Very nice. Thank you very much.\"\n\nLogan's eyes ceased to shine. His wounded pride made him defiant.\n\n\"Nobody else anywhere could have worked out that table!\" he said\nstridently. \"Nobody! Morgan said you'd appreciate my work! He said you\nneeded my talent! But what good do you see in it? You think I'm a\nfreak!\"\n\nBors realized that he'd been tactless. Logan's experiences before\nTalents, Incorporated had made him unduly sensitive. He'd done something\nof which he was proud, but Bors didn't appreciate its magnitude. Logan\nreacted to the frustration of his vanity.\n\n\"Hold it!\" said Bors. \"I'm not unappreciative. I'm stupid and worried\nabout something. You just figured an overdrive jump for me that's the\nmost accurate I ever heard of! But I'm desperate for time and we've got\nto spend two days in solar-system drive because we can't make an\noverdrive hop of less than light-days! So we're losing forty-eight hours\nor more.\"\n\nLogan said as stridently as before:\n\n\"But I just showed you you don't have to! Cut the field-strength\naccording to that table.\"\n\nBors was jolted. It was suddenly self-evident. Logan had said he'd\nfigured a table of overdrive fields for the _Isis_ which would work for\nanything between one point five light-speeds to maximum. One point five\nlight-speeds!\n\nIt was one of those absurdities in technology that so often go so long\nbefore they are noticed. During the development of overdrive, it had\nbeen the effort of every technician to get the fastest possible drive.\nIt was known that with a given mass and a given field-strength, one\ncould get an effective speed of an unbelievable figure. Men had spent\ntheir lives trying to increase that figure. But nobody'd ever tried to\nfind out how _slowly_ one could travel in overdrive, because\nsolar-system drive took care of _short_ distances!\n\n\"Wait a minute!\" said Bors, staring. \"Do you really mean I can drive\nthis ship under two light-speeds in overdrive?\"\n\n\"Look at the table!\" said Logan, trembling with anger. \"Look at it!\nYou'll find the figures right there!\"\n\nBors looked. Then he stood up quickly. He left the ship in the care of\nhis second-in-command and plunged into a highly technical discussion\nwith its engineers.\n\nHe ran into violent objections. The whole purpose of overdrive was high\nspeed between stars. The engineers insisted that one had to use the\nstrongest possible field. If the field were made feeble, it would become\nunstable. Everybody knew that the field had to be of maximum strength.\n\n\"We'll try minimum,\" said Bors coldly. \"Now let's get to work!\"\n\nHe had to do much of the labor himself, because the engineers found it\nnecessary to stop at each stage of the effort to explain why it should\nnot be done. He had almost to battle to get an auxiliary circuit\nparalleling the main overdrive unit, with a transformer to bring down\nvoltage, and a complete new power-supply unit to be cut into the\noverdrive line while leaving the standard ready for use without delay.\n\nHe went back to the control room. He took a distance-reading on the huge\nplanet off to port. He threw on the new, low-power overdrive field. He\nheld it for seconds and broke out. It was still in sight.\n\nThe speed of the _Isis_, with the adjusted overdrive, was one point\nseven lights.\n\nNow, instead of spending days in solar-system drive for planetary\napproach, Bors went into the new-speed drive and broke out in eleven\nminutes twenty seconds, and was within a hundred thousand miles of\nGaren. He'd saved two days and secured the promise of many more such\nvaluable feats.\n\nAs soon as the _Isis_ broke to normal space near Garen, there was a call\non the communicator. A familiar voice;\n\n\"_Calling_ Isis! _Calling_ Isis! Sylva _calling_ Isis!\"\n\nBors said softly, \"Damnation! For the second time, what are you doing in\nthis place?\"\n\nGwenlyn's voice laughed.\n\n\"_Traveling for pleasure, Captain Bors! I've news for you. We were\nallowed to land and then told to leave again. There's a warship down\nbelow. I told you about it before. It's still there. There's a huge\ncargo-ship, too, and there are riots because it's almost finished\nloading with requisitioned foodstuffs for Mekin. Mekin is--would you\nbelieve it?--unpopular on Garen!_\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Bors. \"I'll see what can be done. Will you carry a\nmessage for me?\"\n\n\"_Happy to oblige, Captain!_\"\n\n\"Tell them that--\" Then Bors stopped short. It was not probable that the\nfleet wave-form and frequency were known to Mekinese ships. But the\npossibility of low-speed overdrive travel was much too important a\nmilitary secret to risk under any circumstances. He said, \"I'll be along\nvery shortly with some highly encouraging news.\"\n\n\"_Who do I tell this to?_\"\n\n\"I name no names on microwaves,\" he told her. \"Get going, will you?\"\n\n\"_To hear_,\" said Gwenlyn cheerfully, \"_is to obey_.\"\n\nHer communicator clicked off. The _Sylva_ showed on a radar-screen, but\nhad not been near enough to be sighted direct. The blip shot out from\nthe planet.\n\nBors growled to himself. The _Isis_ floated a hundred thousand miles off\nGaren. There was no challenge. There was no query from the planet. But\nGwenlyn said that there were riots down below. They could be serious\nenough to absorb the attention usually given to routine. But there was\nanother reason for this inattention. Garen was a part of the Mekinese\nempire which was not encouraged to trade off-planet except through\nMekin. Very few non-Mekinese ships would ever land there, and therefore\nwouldn't be watched for. It was unlikely that a long-range radar\nhabitually swept space off Garen. The battleship should be more alert,\nbut again there was no danger of space-borne rebellion, and the affair\nof Kandar might not have been bruited so far away.\n\nBut the spaceport would respond to calls, certainly. Bors considered\nthese circumstances. A large cargo-ship loaded with foodstuffs\nrequisitioned to be sent to Mekin. A population which had been\nrebellious before--witness the battleship aground to overawe\nresistance--and now was rioting.\n\nBors called for the extra members of his crew. He uncomfortably outlined\nthe action he had in mind. There was one part that he disliked. He had\nto stay on board ship. The important action, as he saw it, would take\nplace elsewhere. It was so obviously painful for him to outline a course\nof action in which other men must take risks he couldn't share, that his\nmen regarded him with pleased affection which he did not guess at. In\nthe end he asked for twenty volunteers, and got fifty.\n\nHe swung the _Isis_ around to the night side of the planet. Its two port\nblisters opened and two boats floated free in the orbit Bors had\nestablished. The ship moved on ahead.\n\nJust at sunup where the spaceport stood, a voice growled down from outer\nspace.\n\n\"_Calling ground!_\" it said contemptuously. \"_Calling ground! This is\nthe last ship left of the fleet of Kandar. We're pirates now and we're\nlooking for trouble! There's a battleship down there. Come up and fight\nor we blast you in your spaceport! Just to prove we can do it--watch!_\"\n\nBors said, \"Fire one,\" and a missile went off toward the planet. It was\nfused to detonate at the very tip of the fringes of the planet's\natmosphere.\n\nIt did. There was light more brilliant than a thousand suns. The long\nlow shadows of sunrise vanished. The new-rising sun turned dim by\ncomparison.\n\nThe voice from space spoke with intolerable levity. \"_Come up with your\nmissiles ready! We'll give you ten thousand miles of height. And if you\ntry to duck out in overdrive...._\"\n\nThe voice was explicit about what it would do to the Mekinese-occupied\nareas of Garen if the battleship fled.\n\nIt came up to fight. It could do nothing else.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\n\nThe trick, of course, was in the timing, and the secret was that Bors\nknew what he was doing, while those who opposed him did not. Bors had\ndeclared himself a pirate on Tralee, and here off Garen he'd claimed the\nsame status. But no Mekinese, as yet, knew why he'd outlawed himself,\nnor his purpose in challenging a line battleship to fight. It seemed\nlike the raving, hysterical hatred of men with no motive but hate. But\nit wasn't. The _Isis_ could have sent down a missile with a\nlimited-yield warhead if its only purpose had been to kill or to\ndestroy. He could have blasted the warship without warning and it was\nunlikely that it was alert enough to send up counter-missiles in its own\ndefense. But he'd have had to smash everything else in the spaceport at\nthe same time.\n\nTherefore he'd left his two space-boats in low orbit on the night side\nof the planet. In thirty minutes or so they'd arrive near the spaceport,\nwhere there was a large cargo-ship loaded with foodstuffs, for Mekin.\nBors wanted that cargo.\n\nSo when the Mekinese battlewagon came lumbering up to space, with her\nmissile-tubes armed and bristling, Bors withdrew the _Isis_. It was not\nflight. It was a move designed to make sure that when the fight began\nthere would be no stray missiles falling on the planet.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnseen, the _Isis's_ space-boats floated in darkness. They carried ten\nmen each, equipped with small arms and light bombs. They listened to\nsuch bits of broadcast information as came from the night beneath them.\nBoat Number One picked up a news broadcast, and when it was finished,\nthe petty officer in command pulled free the tape that had recorded it\nand tucked it in his pocket. There were items of interest on it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe _Isis_ came to a stop in space. The battleship rose and rose. It did\nnot drive toward the _Isis_. There was a maximum distance beyond which\nspace-combat was impractical; beyond which missiles became mere blind\nprojectiles moving almost at random and destroying each other without\nregard to planetary loyalties. There was also a minimum distance, below\nwhich missiles were again mere projectiles and could not greatly modify\nthe courses on which they were launched.\n\nBut there was a wide area in between, in which combat was practical. The\nMekinese battleship reached a height where it could maneuver on\nsolar-system drive without rockets. It might, of course, flick into\noverdrive and be gone thousands of millions of miles within seconds. But\nthat would be flight. It would not return accurately to the scene of the\nfight. So overdrive could not be used as a battle tactic. It could be\nused only for escape.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNear the planet, where the two space-boats floated, the dawnline\nappeared at the world's edge. The space-boats swung about, facing\nbackward, and applied power for deceleration. They dropped into the\natmosphere and bounced out again, and in again--more deeply--and then\nswung once more to face along their course. They began a long, shallow,\nscreaming descent from the farthest limits of the planet's atmosphere.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOut where the sun of Garen was a disk of intolerable brilliance and\nheat, the battleship bumbled on its way. It would seem that its\ncommander scornfully accepted the _Isis's_ terms of combat and moved\ncontemptuously to the position where his weapons would be most deadly.\nHis ship's launching-tubes were at the ready. It should be able to pour\nout a cloud of missiles. In fact, a sardonic voice came from the\nbattleship.\n\n\"_Calling pirate_,\" said the voice.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bors.\n\n\"_If you wish to surrender--_\"\n\n\"We don't,\" said Bors.\n\n\"_I was about to say_,\" said the sardonic voice, \"_that it is now too\nlate._\"\n\nThe radar-screen showed tiny specks darting out from that larger speck\nwhich was the battleship. They came hurtling toward the _Isis_. Bors\ncounted them. A ship of the _Isis's_ class mounted eighteen\nlaunching-tubes. She should be able to fire eighteen missiles at a time.\nThe Mekinese ship had fired nineteen. If the _Isis_ opened fire, by all\nthe previous rules of space-combat, she would need to use one missile to\ncounter every one of the battleship's, there would still be one left\nover to destroy the _Isis_--unless she fired a second spread of\nmissiles, which was virtually impossible before she would be hit.\n\nIt was mockery by the skipper of the battleship. He was doubtless much\namused at the idea of toying with this small, insolent vessel. But Bors\ndid not try to match him missile for missile. He said evenly,\n\n\"Fire one. Fire two. Fire three. Fire four.\"\n\nHe stopped at four. His four missiles went curving wildly, in the\ngeneral direction, only, of the enemy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the planet Garen two shrieking objects came furiously to ground. Men\nleaped swiftly out of them and trotted toward a small town, a\nsettlement, a group of houses hardly larger than a village. One man\ndelayed by each grounded space-boat, and then ran to overtake the\nothers. Local inhabitants appeared, to stare and to wonder. The two\nlanding-parties, ten men in each, did not pause. They swarmed into the\nvillage's single street. There were ground-cars at the street-sides. The\nmen of the landing-parties established themselves briskly. One of them\nseized a staring civilian by the arm.\n\n\"To hell with Mekin,\" he said conversationally. \"Where's the\ncommunicator office?\"\n\n\"Wha--what--?\"\n\n\"To hell with Mekin,\" repeated the man from the _Isis_, impatiently.\n\"Where's the communicator office?\"\n\nThe civilian, trembling suddenly, pointed. Some of the landing-party\nrushed to it. Four went in. There were the reports of blast-rifles.\nSmoke and the smell of burnt insulation drifted out. Others of the\nmagically arrived men went methodically down the street, examining each\nground-car in turn. One of them cupped his hands and bellowed for the\ninformation of alarmed citizens:\n\n\"Attention, please! We're from the pirate ship _Isis_. You have nothing\nto fear from us. We're survivors of Mekin's invasion of Kandar. You will\nplease co-operate with us, and no harm will come to you. Your\nground-cars will be disabled so you can't report us. You will not be\npunished for this! Repeat: you will not be punished!\"\n\nHe repeated the announcement. Others of the swiftly-moving\nlanding-parties drove the chosen ground-cars away from the streets. The\nremaining cars received a blaster-bolt apiece. In seven minutes and\nthirty seconds from the landing of the small space-craft, a motley\nassortment of cars roared out of the village, heading for the capital\ncity of Garen. As the last car cleared the houses, there was a monstrous\nexplosion. One of the space-boats flew to bits. Before the cars had\nvanished, there was a second explosion. Another space-boat vanished in\nflame and debris. The landing-party had no way to return to space. The\ninhabitants of the village had no way to report their coming except in\nperson and by traveling some considerable distance on foot. They were\nsingularly slow in making that report. The men of the space-boats had\nsaid they were pirates. The people of Garen felt no animosity toward\npirates. They only hated Mekinese.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOut in space, missiles hurtled away from the small ship _Isis_. They did\nnot plunge directly at the battleship. They swung crazily in wide arcs.\nThe already-launched Mekinese missiles swerved to intercept them. They\nfailed. More missiles erupted from the battleship, aimed to intercept.\nThey also failed. The battleship began to fling out every missile it\npossessed, in a frantic effort to knock out the _Isis's_ erratic\nmissiles, which neither instruments nor eyes were able to follow\naccurately enough to establish a pattern of destination.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHalf a dozen ground-cars roared through the streets of the capital city\nof Garen. They did not seem to be crowded. One man or at most, two,\ncould be seen in each car, but they drove as a unit, one close behind\nanother, at a furious pace. When they needed a clear way, the first\nsounded its warning-note and the others joined in as a chorus. Half a\ndozen sirens blaring together have an authoritative, emergency sound.\nThe way was cleared when that imperative clarion demanded it.\n\nThey swerved under the landing-grid. They raced and bounced across the\nclear surface which was the spaceport. There stood a giant, rotund\ncargo-ship, pointing skyward. There were ground-trucks still supplying\ncargo for its nearly filled-up holds.\n\nThe six ground-cars braked, making clouds of dust. And suddenly there\nwas not one or two men in each, but an astonishing number. They knew\nexactly what they were about. Five of them plunged into the ship. Others\ndrove off the ground-trucks. Uniformed men ran from the side of the\nspaceport toward the ship, yelling. One ground-car started up again,\nrushed to the control-building, swerved sharply as a crash into it\nseemed inevitable, and dumped something out on the ground. It raced back\nto the other cars about the cargo-ship. The hold-doors were closing.\n\nThe object dumped by the control-building went off. It was a\nchemical-explosive bomb, but its power was adequate. The wall of the\nbuilding caved in. Flames leaped crazily out of the collapsed heap. The\nlanding-field would be out of operation.\n\nThe last car skidded to a stop. The two men in it ran for the\nboarding-stair of the cargo-boat. There was nobody of their party\noutside now. The landing-stair withdrew after them.\n\nThen monstrous, incredible masses of flame and steam burst from the\nbottom of the rotund space-ship. It lifted, slowly at first, but then\nmore and more swiftly. It climbed to the sky. It became a speck, and\nthen a mote at the crawling end of a trail of opaque white\nemergency-rocket fumes. Then it vanished.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFar out in space, there was an explosion brighter than the sun, and then\na second and a third. There was a cloud of incandescent metal vapor.\nPresently a missile found its target-seeking microwaves reflected by the\nionized metal steam. It plunged into collision with that glowing stuff.\nIt exploded. Two or three more exploded, like the first. Others burned\nharmlessly.\n\nA voice said, \"_Cargo-ship reporting. Clear of ground. Everything going\nwell. No casualties._\"\n\n\"Report again when in clear space,\" said Bors.\n\nHe waited. Several long minutes later a second report came.\n\n\"_Cargo-ship reporting. In clear space._\"\n\n\"Very good work!\" said Bors. \"You know where to go now. Go ahead!\"\n\n\"_Yes, sir_,\" said the voice from space. Then it asked apologetically,\n\"_You got the battleship, sir?_\"\n\nThe voice from space sounded as if the man who spoke were grinning.\n\n\"_We'll celebrate that, sir! Good to have served with you, sir._\"\n\nBors swung the _Isis_ and drove on solar-system drive to get well away\nfrom Garen. He watched the blip which was the captured ship as it seemed\nto hesitate a very, very long time. It was aiming, of course, for\nGlamis, that totally useless solar system around a planet where the\nfleet of Kandar orbited in bitter frustration.\n\nBors got up from his seat to loosen his muscles. He had sat absolutely\ntense and effectively motionless for a very long time. He ached. But he\nfelt a sour sort of satisfaction. For a ship of the _Isis's_ class to\nhave challenged a battleship to combat, to have deliberately and\ninsultingly waited for it to choose its own battle-distance, and then to\nlet it launch its missiles first.... It was no ambush! Bors did not\nfeel ashamed of this fight. He'd acted according to the instincts of a\nfighting man who gives his enemy the chance to use what weapons the\nenemy has chosen, and then defeats him.\n\nHis second-in-command said, \"Sir, the cargo-boat blip is gone. It should\nbe in overdrive now, sir, heading for Glamis.\"\n\n\"Then we'll follow it,\" said Bors. Suddenly he realized how his\nsecond-in-command must feel. The landing-party'd seen action--for which\nBors envied them--and he'd felt ashamed because he stayed in the ship in\nwhat he considered safety while they risked their lives. But his\nsecond-in-command had had no share in the achievement at all. Bors had\nhandled all controls and given all orders, even the routine ones, since\nbefore Tralee.\n\n\"I think,\" said Bors, \"I'll have a cup of coffee. Will you take over and\nhead for Glamis?\"\n\nHe left the control-room, to let his subordinate handle things for a\ntime. He'd seated himself in the mess-room when the voice of his\nsecond-in-command came through the speakers.\n\n\"_Going into overdrive_,\" said the voice. \"_All steady. Five, four,\nthree, two--_\"\n\nBors prepared to wince. He put down his coffee cup and held himself\nready for the sickening sensation.\n\nSuddenly there was the rasping, snaring crackling of a high-voltage\nspark. There were shouts. There were explosions and the reek of\noverheated metal and smoldering insulation. Then the compartment-doors\nclosed.\n\nWhen Bors had examined the damage, and the emergency-purifiers had taken\nthe smoke and smell out of the air, his second-in-command looked\nsuicidally gloomy.\n\n\"It's bad business,\" said Bors wryly. \"Very bad business! But I should\nhave mentioned it to you. I didn't think of it. I wouldn't have thought\nof it if I'd been doing the overdrive business myself.\"\n\nThe second-in-command said bitterly;\n\n\"But I knew you'd tried the new low-power overdrive! I knew it!\"\n\n\"I left it switched in,\" said Bors, \"because I thought we might use it\nin the fight with the battleship. But we didn't.\"\n\n\"I should have checked that it was off!\" protested his second. \"It's my\nfault!\"\n\nBors shrugged. Deciding whose fault it was wouldn't repair the damage.\nThere'd been a human error. Bors had approached Garen on the low-power\noverdrive that Logan had computed for him. There was a special switch to\ncut it in, instead of the standard overdrive. It should have been cut\nout when the standard overdrive was used. But somebody in the\nengine-room had simply thrown the main-drive switch when preparations\nfor overdrive travel began. When the ship should have gone into\noverdrive, it didn't. The two parallel circuits amounted to an effective\nshort-circuit. Generators, condensers--even the overdrive field coils in\ntheir armored mounts outside the hull--everything blew.\n\nSo the _Isis_ was left with a solar-system drive and rockets and nothing\nelse. If the drive used only in solar systems were put on full, and the\n_Isis_ headed for Glamis, and if the food and water held out, it would\narrive at that distant world in eighty-some years. It could reach Tralee\nin fifty. But there were emergency rations for a few weeks only. It was\nnot conceivable that repairs could be made. This was no occasion calling\nfor remarkable ingenuity to make some sort of jury-rigged drive. This\nwas final.\n\n\"I've got to think,\" said Bors heavily.\n\nHe went to his own cabin.\n\nTalents, Incorporated couldn't improvise or precognize or calculate an\nanswer to this! And all previous plans had to be cancelled. Absolutely.\nHe dismissed at once and for all time the idea that the _Isis_ could be\nrepaired short of months in a well-equipped space-yard on a friendly\nplanet. She should be blown up, after adequate pains were taken to\ndestroy any novelties in her make-up. There were the tables of Logan's\ncalculation. Bors found himself thinking sardonically that Logan should\nbe shot because he had no obligation of loyalty to Kandar, and could as\nreadily satisfy his hunger for recognition in the Mekinese service as\nin Kandar's. The crew....\n\nThat was the heart of the situation. The _Isis_ could not be salvaged.\nShe should be destroyed. There was only one world within reach on which\nhuman beings could live. That world was Garen. The _Isis_ could sit down\non Garen, disembark her crew, and be blown up before Mekinese\nauthorities could interfere. Perhaps--possibly--her crew could try to\nfunction on Garen as marooned pirates, as outlaws, as rebels against the\npuppet planetary government. But they knew too much. Every man aboard\nknew how the interceptor-proof missiles worked. Logan might be the only\nman who had ever calculated the tables for their use, but if any member\nof the _Isis's_ crew were captured and made to talk, he could tell\nenough for Mekinese mathematicians to start work with. If Logan were\ncaptured he could tell more. He could re-compute not only the tables for\nthe missiles, but the data for low-power overdrive which would make any\nfleet invincible.\n\nAnd there was the Kandarian fleet. If its existence became known, it\nwould mean the destruction of Kandar. Every soul of all its millions\nwould die with every tree and blade of grass, every flower, beast and\nsinging bird, even the plankton in its seas.\n\nBors had arrived at the grimmest decision of his life when his cabin\nspeaker said curtly:\n\n\"_Captain Bors, sir. Space-yacht_ Sylva _calling. Asks for you._\"\n\n\"I'm here,\" said Bors.\n\nGwenlyn's voice came out of the speaker.\n\n\"_Are you in trouble, Captain? One of our Talents insists that you\nare._\"\n\nBors swallowed.\n\n\"I thought you'd gone on as you were supposed to do. Yes. There is\ntrouble. It amounts to shipwreck. How many of my men can you take off?\"\n\n\"_We've lots of room!_\" said Gwenlyn. \"_My father kept most of the\nTalents with him. We're heading your way, Captain._\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Bors. \"Thank you.\" He was grateful, but help from a\nwoman--from Gwenlyn!--galled him.\n\nHe heard her click off, and shivered.\n\nPresently the _Sylva_ was alongside. The transfer of the _Isis's_ crew\nbegan. Bors went over the ship for the last time. The ship's log went\naboard the _Sylva_, as did Logan's calculated tables for low-power\noverdrive. Bors made quite sure that nothing else could be recovered\nfrom the _Isis_. He looked strained and irritable when he finally went\ninto one of the lifeboat blisters on the _Isis_ left vacant by the\nsacrifice of two space-boats in the Garen cutting-out expedition. A boat\nfrom the _Sylva_ was there to receive him.\n\n\"Technically,\" said Bors, \"I should go down with my ship, or fly apart\nwith it. But there's no point in being romantic!\"\n\n\"I'm the one,\" said his second-in-command, \"who will stand\ncourt-martial!\"\n\n\"I doubt it very much,\" said Bors. \"They can't court-martial you for\npartly accomplishing something they're in trouble for failing at. Into\nthe boat with you!\"\n\nHe threw a switch and entered the boat. The blister opened. The small\nspace-boat floated free. Its drive hummed and it drove far and away from\nthe seemingly unharmed but completely helpless _Isis_. Bors looked\nregretfully back at the abandoned light cruiser. Sunlight glinted on its\nhull. Somehow a slow rotary motion had been imparted to it during the\nprocess of abandoning ship. The little fighting ship pointed as though\nwistfully at all the stars about her, to none of which she would ever\ndrive again.\n\nThe _Sylva_ loomed up. The last space-boat nestled into its blister and\nthe grapples clanked. The leaves closed. When the blister air-pressure\nshowed normal and green lights flashed and flashed, Bors got out of the\nboat and went to the _Sylva's_ control-room. Gwenlyn was there, quite\ncasually controlling the operation of the yacht by giving suggestions to\nits official skipper. She turned and beamed at Bors.\n\n\"We'll pull off a way,\" she observed, \"and make sure your time-bomb\nworks. You wouldn't want her discovered and salvaged.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bors.\n\nHe stood by a viewport as the _Sylva_ drove away. The _Isis_ ceased to\nbe a shape and became the most minute of motes. Bors looked at his\nwatch.\n\n\"Not far enough yet,\" he said depressedly. \"Everything will go.\"\n\nThe yacht drove on. Fifteen--twenty minutes at steadily increasing\nsolar-system speed.\n\n\"It's about due,\" said Bors.\n\nGwenlyn came and stood beside him. They looked together out at the\nstars. There were myriads upon myriads of them, of all the colors of the\nspectrum, of all degrees of brightness, in every possible asymmetric\ndistribution.\n\nThere was a spark in remoteness. Instantly it was vastly more than a\nspark. It was a globe of deadly, blue-white incandescence. It flamed\nbrilliantly as all the _Isis's_ fuel and the warheads on all its\nunexpended missiles turned to pure energy in the hundred-millionth of a\nsecond. It was many times brighter than a sun. Then it was not. And the\nviolence of the explosion was such that there was not even glowing\nmetal-vapor where it had been. Every atom of the ship's substance had\nbeen volatilized and scattered through so many thousands of cubic miles\nof emptiness that it did not show even as a mist.\n\n\"A good ship,\" said Bors grimly. Then he growled. \"I wonder if they saw\nthat on Garen and what they thought about it!\" He straightened himself.\n\"How did you know we were in trouble?\"\n\n\"There's a Talent,\" said Gwenlyn matter-of-factly, \"who can always tell\nhow people feel. She doesn't know what they think or why. But she can\ntell when they're uneasy and so on. Father uses her to tell him when\npeople lie. When what they say doesn't match how they feel, they're\nlying.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Bors, \"that I'll stay away from her. But that won't do\nany good, will it?\"\n\nGwenlyn smiled at him. It was a very nice smile.\n\n\"She could tell that things had gone wrong with the ship,\" she observed,\n\"because of the way you felt. But I've forbidden her ever to tell when\nsomeone lies to me or anything like that. I don't want to know people's\nfeelings when they want to hide them.\"\n\n\"Fine!\" said Bors. \"I feel better.\" Standing so close to Gwenlyn, he\nalso felt light-headed.\n\nShe smiled at him again, as if she understood.\n\n\"We'll head for Glamis now,\" she said. \"The situation there should have\nchanged a great deal because of what you've done.\"\n\n\"It would be my kind of luck,\" said Bors half joking, \"for it to have\nchanged for the worse.\"\n\nIt had.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\n\"The decision,\" said King Humphrey the Eighth, stubbornly, \"is exactly\nwhat I have said. In full war council it has been agreed that the fleet,\nthrough a new use of missiles, is a stronger fighting force than ever\nbefore. This was evidenced in the late battle and no one questions it.\nBut it is also agreed that we remain hopelessly outnumbered. We are in a\nposition where we simply cannot fight! For us to have fought would\nprobably have been forgiven if we had been wiped out in the recent\nbattle--preferably with only slight loss to the Mekinese. We offered\nbattle expecting exactly that. Unfortunately, we annihilated the fleet\nthat was to have occupied Kandar. In consequence we have had to pretend\nthat we were destroyed along with them. And if we are discovered to be\nalive, and certainly if we offer to fight, Kandar will be exterminated\nas a living world, to punish us and as a warning to future victims of\nthe Mekinese.\"\n\n\"Yes, Majesty,\" Bors said through tight lips. \"But may I point out--\"\n\n\"I know what you want to point out,\" the king broke in irritably. \"With\nthe help of these Talents, Incorporated people, you've worked out a new\nbattle tactic you want to put into practice. You've explained it to the\nWar Council. The War Council has decided that it is too risky. We cannot\ngamble the lives of the people on Kandar. We have not the right to\nexpose them to Mekinese vengeance!\"\n\n\"I agree, Majesty,\" said Bors, \"but at the same time--\"\n\nThe king leaned back in his chair.\n\n\"I don't like it any better than you do,\" he said peevishly. \"I expected\nto get killed in a space-battle--not very gloriously, but at least with\nself-respect. Unfortunately we had bad luck. We won the fight. I do not\nlike what we have to do in consequence, but we have to do it!\"\n\nBors bit his lips. He liked and respected King Humphrey, as he had\nrespect and affection for his uncle, the Pretender of Tralee. Both were\nhonest and able men who'd been forced to learn the disheartening lesson\nthat some things are impossible. But Bors believed that King Humphrey\nhad learned the lesson too well.\n\n\"You plan, Majesty,\" he said after a moment, \"to send me out again to\ncapture food-ships if I can.\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" said the king.\n\n\"The idea being,\" Bors went on, \"that if I can get enough food for the\nfleet so it can make a journey of several hundreds of light-years--\"\n\n\"It is necessary to go a long way,\" the king confirmed unhappily. \"We\nneed to take the fleet to where Mekin is only a name and Kandar not even\nthat.\"\n\n\"Where you will disband the fleet--\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And hope that Mekin will not take vengeance anyhow for the fight the\nfleet has already put up.\"\n\nThe king said heavily, \"It will be a very long time before word drifts\nback that the fleet of Kandar did not die in battle. It may never come.\nIf it does, it will come as a vague rumor, as an idle tale, as absurd\ngossip about a fleet whose home planet may not even be remembered when\nthe tales are told. There will be trivial stories about a fleet which\nabandoned the world it should have defended, and fled so far that its\nenemies did not bother to follow it. If the tale reaches Mekin, it may\nnot be believed. It may not ever be linked to Kandar. And if some day it\nis believed, by then Kandar will be long occupied. Perhaps it will be\nresigned to its status. It will be a valuable subject world. Mekin will\nnot destroy it merely to punish scattered, forgotten men who will never\nknow that they have been punished.\"\n\n\"And you want me,\" repeated Bors, \"to find the stores of food that will\nlet the fleet travel to--oblivion.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the king again. He looked very weary. \"In a sense, of\ncourse, we will simply be doing what we set out to do--to throw away our\nlives. We intended to do that. We are doing no more now.\"\n\nBors said grimly, \"I'm not sure. But I will obey orders, Majesty. Do you\nobject if I pass out the details of the new device among some junior\nofficers? I speak of the way to compute overdrive speed exactly and how\nto vary it. It could help the fleet to stay together, even in\noverdrive.\"\n\nThe king shrugged. \"That would be desirable. I do not object.\"\n\n\"I'll do it then, Majesty,\" said Bors. \"I'll be assigned a new ship. I'd\nlike the same crew. I'll do my best, in a new part of the Mekinese\nempire, this time.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the king drearily. \"Don't make a pattern of raids that would\nsuggest that you have a base. You understand, it is impossible to use\nmore than one ship....\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" agreed Bors. \"One more suggestion, Majesty. A ship could be\nsent back to Kandar--not to land but to watch. If a single Mekinese ship\nwent there to ask questions, it could be destroyed, perhaps. Which would\ngain us time.\"\n\n\"I will think about it,\" said the king doubtfully. \"Maybe it has\noccurred to someone else. I will see. Meantime you will go to the\nadmiral for a new ship. And then do what you can to find provisions for\nthe fleet. It is not good for us to merely stay here waiting for\nnothing. Even action toward our own disappearance is preferable.\"\n\nBors saluted. He went to the office of the admiral. The\ncommander-in-chief of the Kandarian fleet was making an inspection, to\nmaintain tight discipline in the absence of hope. A young vice-admiral\nwas on duty in the admiral's stead. He regarded Bors with approval. He\nlistened with attention, and agreed with most of what Bors had to say.\n\n\"I'll push the idea of a sentry over Kandar,\" he said confidentially.\n\"I'll make it two ships or three and take command. I want to send some\nof my engineer officers to get the details of that low-power overdrive.\nA very pretty tactical idea! It should be spread throughout the fleet.\"\n\n\"It will help,\" Bors said with irony, \"when we go so far away that we'll\nnever be heard of any more.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" The vice-admiral looked at him blankly. \"Oh. Perhaps. You wouldn't\nbe likely to pick up a cargo-ship loaded with Mekinese missiles, would\nyou? We could adapt them to our use.\"\n\n\"If I did,\" Bors answered, \"I suspect that somehow that ship would land\nitself on Mekin and blow up as it touched ground.\"\n\nThe vice-admiral raised his eyebrows. Bors saluted quickly and left.\n\nPresently he was back on the _Sylva_. His new command would be supplied\nwith extra missiles from other ships. Despite the fleet action against\nthe Mekinese, there was not yet a shortage of such ammunition. When a\nmissile could not be intercepted and itself did not try to intercept,\nthe economy of missiles was great. In the battle of the gas-giant\nplanet, the fleet had fired no more than three or four missiles for\nevery enemy ship destroyed.\n\nMorgan took Bors aside.\n\n\"I'm going to keep Logan here this trip. I'm working on the commanders.\nI need him. And our Talent for Detecting Lies,--she was the one who knew\nyou were in trouble, Gwenlyn tells me--is very necessary. I was hampered\nby not having her while Gwenlyn was away. But she did a good job for\nyou!\"\n\nBors shrugged. He did not like depending upon Talents. He still wasn't\ninclined toward acceptance of what he considered the occult. Now he\nsaid, \"I'm duly grateful, but it's just as well. My mind doesn't work in\na way to understand these Talents of yours. I admit everything, but I'm\nafraid I don't really accept anything.\"\n\n\"It's perfectly reasonable,\" protested Morgan. \"The facts fit together!\nI'm no hand at working out theories; I deal in facts. But the facts do\nmake sense!\"\n\nBors found himself looking at the door of the family room, where Morgan\nhad taken him. He realized that he was waiting for Gwenlyn to enter. He\nturned back to Morgan.\n\n\"They don't make sense to me,\" he said dourly. \"You have a precognizer,\nyou say. He foresees the future. I admit that he has. But the future is\nuncertain. It can't be foreseen unless it's pre-ordained, and in that\ncase we're only puppets imagining that we're free agents. But there\nwould be no reason in such a state of things!\"\n\nMorgan settled himself luxuriously in a self-adjusting chair. He thrust\na cigar on Bors and lighted up zestfully.\n\n\"I've been wanting to spout about that,\" he observed, \"even if I'm no\ntheoretician. Look here! What is true? What is truth? What's the\ndifference between a false statement and a true one?\"\n\nBors's eyes wandered to the door again. He drew them back.\n\n\"One's so and the other isn't,\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" said Morgan. \"Truth is an accordance--an agreement--between an\nidea and a fact. If I toss a coin, I can make two statements. I can say\nit will come up heads, or I can say that it will come up tails. One\nsentence is true and one is false. A precognizer simply knows which\nstatement is true. I don't, but he does.\"\n\n\"It's still prophecy,\" objected Bors.\n\n\"Oh, no!\" protested Morgan. \"A precognizer-talent doesn't prophesy! All\nhe can do is recognize that an idea he has now matches an event that\nwill happen presently. He can't extract ideas from the future! He can\nonly judge the truth or falsity of ideas that occur to him. He has to\nthink something before he can know it is true. He _does not get\ninformation from the future!_ He can only know that the idea he has now\nmatches something that will happen later. He can detect a matching--an\nagreement--perhaps it's a mental vibration of some sort. But that's\nall!\"\n\n\"I asked if I would capture a cargo-ship on Tralee--\"\n\n\"And I said I didn't know! Of course I said so! How could anybody know\nsuch a thing except by pure accident? A precognizer might think of nine\nhundred and ninety-nine ways in which you might try to capture that\nship. They could all be wrong. He might say you wouldn't capture it. But\nyou might try a thousandth way that he hadn't thought of! All he can\nknow is that some idea he has concocted matches--some instinct stirs,\nand he _knows_ it's true! That's why one man can precognize dirty\ntricks. His mind works that way! We've got a woman who knows,\ninfallibly, who's going to marry whom! That's why the ship-arrival\nprecognizer can say a ship's coming in. His mind works on such things,\nand he has a talent besides!\"\n\n\"There are definite limits, then.\"\n\n\"What is there that's real and hasn't limits?\" demanded Morgan.\n\nThe door opened and Gwenlyn came in. Bors rose, looking pleased.\n\n\"I'm telling him the facts of life about precognition,\" Morgan told her.\n\"I think he understands now.\"\n\n\"I don't agree,\" said Bors.\n\nGwenlyn said amusedly, \"Two of our Talents want to talk to you, Captain.\nYou might say that they want to measure you for rumors.\"\n\n\"They what?\" demanded Bors, startled.\n\n\"The Talent who predicts dirty tricks,\" said Gwenlyn, \"is going to work\nwith the woman who broadcasts daydreams. They'll be our Department of\nPropaganda.\"\n\nBors said uncertainly, \"But there's no point in propaganda! It's\ndetermined.\"\n\n\"I know!\" said Morgan complacently. \"The high brass has made a decision.\nA perfectly logical decision, too, once you grant their premises. But\nthey assume that Talents, Incorporated, given some co-operation, of\ncourse, lacks the ability to change the situation. In that they're\nmistaken.\"\n\n\"Father hopes,\" said Gwenlyn amiably, \"to modify the situation so their\nassumptions will lead logically to a different conclusion. Apparently\nthey're going to change their minds!\"\n\nBors objected. \"But you can't know the future!\"\n\n\"Our precognizer--our Precognizer for Special Events,\" said Gwenlyn,\n\"got the notion that a year from now King Humphrey should open\nparliament on Kandar, if everything is straightened out. The notion\nbecame a precognition. We don't know how it can come about, but it does\nseem to imply a change of plans somewhere!\"\n\nBors found himself indomitably skeptical. But he said, \"Ah! That's the\nprecognition you mentioned on Kandar--that the fleet wouldn't be wiped\nout and everybody killed.\"\n\n\"No-o-o,\" said Gwenlyn. \"That was another one. I'd rather not tell you\nabout it. It might be--unpleasant. I'll tell you later.\"\n\nBors shrugged.\n\n\"All right. You said I'm to be measured for rumors? Bring on your\ntape-measures!\"\n\nMorgan beamed at him. Gwenlyn went to the door and opened it. An\nenormously fat woman came in, moving somehow sinuously in spite of her\nbulk. She gave Bors a glance he could not fathom. It was sentimental,\nlanguishing and wholly and utterly approving. He felt a momentary\nappalled suspicion which he dismissed in something close to panic. It\ncouldn't be that he was fated--\n\nThen the arrogant man with rings came in. He'd been identified as the\nTalent for Predicting Dirty Tricks. Bors remembered that he had a\nparanoid personality, inclined toward infinite suspiciousness, and that\nhe'd been in jail for predicting crimes that were later committed.\n\n\"Gwenlyn says propaganda,\" said Morgan, \"but I prefer to think of these\ntwo Talents as our Department for Disseminating Truthful Seditious\nRumors. You've met Harms.\" The man waved his hand, his rings glittering.\n\"But I didn't tell you about Madame Porvis. She has the extraordinary\ntalent of contagious fantasy. It is remarkably rare. She can daydream,\nand others contract her dreamings as if they were spread by germs.\"\n\nThe fat woman bridled. She still regarded Bors with a melting gaze.\nAgain he felt startled unease.\n\n\"It's been a great trial to me,\" she said in a peculiarly childish\nvoice. \"I had such trouble, before I knew what it was!\"\n\n\"Er--trial?\" asked Bors apprehensively.\n\n\"When I was just an overweight adolescent,\" she told him archly, \"I\ndaydreamed about my school's best athlete. Presently I found that my\nshocked fellow-students were gossiping to each other that he'd acted as\nI daydreamed. Other girls wouldn't look at him because they said he was\nmadly in love with me.\"\n\nThe arrogant man with the rings made a scornful sound.\n\n\"He hated me,\" said Madame Porvis, ruefully, \"because the gossip made\nhim ridiculous, and it was only people picking up my daydreams!\"\n\nShe looked at Morgan. He nodded encouragement.\n\n\"Years later,\" she said to Bors, \"I grew romantic about an actor. He was\nnot at all talented, but I daydreamed that he was, and also brilliant\nand worshipped by millions. Soon everybody seemed to believe it was\ntrue! Because I daydreamed it! He was given tremendous contracts,\nand--then I dared to daydream that he met and was fascinated by me!\nImmediately there was gossip that it had happened! When he denied that\nhe knew me,--and he didn't--and when he saw my picture and said he\ndidn't _want_ to, I was crushed. I wove beautifully tragic fantasies\nabout myself as pining away and dying because of his cruelty,--and soon\nit was common gossip that I had!\" She sighed. \"He was considered a\nvillain, because I daydreamed of him that way. His career was ruined.\nI've had to be very careful about my daydreams ever since.\"\n\n\"Madame Porvis's talent,\" Morgan said proudly, \"is all the more\nremarkable because she realized herself that she had it. She lets ideas\npop into her head and presently they pop into other people's heads and\nyou have first-class rumors running madly about. When her fantasies\ncontain elements of truth, so do the rumors. You see?\"\n\n\"It's most interesting,\" admitted Bors. \"But--\"\n\n\"Now Harms,\" said Morgan, \"reads news-reports. He's specialized on those\nbrought back by Gwenlyn and by you. He guesses at the news behind the\nnews--and he knows when he's hit it. He'll tell Madame Porvis the facts,\nshe'll weave them into a fantasy and they'll spread like wildfire. Of\ncourse she can't plant new subjects in people's minds. But anybody who's\never heard of Mekin will pick up her fantasies about graft and\ninefficiency in its government. Riots against Mekin, and so on. However,\none wants not only to spread seditious rumors about villains, but also\nabout--say--pirates who go about fighting Mekin. Tell her stories about\nyour men, if you like. Anything that's material for heroic\ndefiance-fantasies against Mekin.\"\n\nBors found himself stubbornly resisting the idea. It might be that there\nwas such a thing as precognition in the form Morgan had described. There\nmight be such a thing as contagious fantasy. But on the other hand--\n\n\"I give up,\" he said. \"I won't deny it and I can't believe it. I'll go\nabout my business of piracy. But you, sir,\" he turned to Morgan, \"you've\ngot to keep Gwenlyn from taking risks!\"\n\n\"True,\" said Morgan. \"She could have some very unpleasant experiences.\nI'll be more stern with her.\"\n\nGwenlyn did not seem alarmed.\n\n\"One more thing,\" Bors added. \"They say the dictator of Mekin is\nsuperstitious, that he patronizes fortune-tellers. Suppose one of _them_\nis a Talent? Suppose _he_ gets precognized information?\"\n\n\"I worry about that,\" admitted Morgan. \"But I know that I have effective\nTalents. There's no evidence that _he_ has.\"\n\n\"He might have a Talent whose talent is confusing our Talents,\" Bors\nsaid with some sarcasm.\n\nMorgan grinned tolerantly.\n\n\"Talk to these two. We've got some firm precognitions that make things\nlook bad for Mekin.\"\n\nHe left the room. Gwenlyn remained, listening with interest when the\nconversation began, and now and then saying something of no great\nimportance. But her presence kept Bors from feeling altogether like a\nfool. Madame Porvis looked at him with languishing, sentimental eyes.\nHarms watched him accusingly.\n\nTheir questions were trivial. Bors told about the landings on Tralee and\non Garen. The woman asked for details that would help her picture feats\nof derring-do. Bors hesitated, and did not quite tell her about the\ntruck drivers on Tralee who volunteered the information that their loads\nwere booby-trapped. But he did stress the fact that the populations of\ndominated planets were on the thin edge of revolt. The suspicious Talent\nasked very little. He listened, frowning.\n\nWhen it was over and they'd gone--the fat woman again somehow managing a\ngait which could only be called sinuous--Bors said abruptly, \"What's\nthis event you know of, a year ahead?\"\n\n\"King Humphrey opening parliament on Kandar,\" said Gwenlyn pleasantly.\n\n\"There's another,\" said Bors, \"which implies specifically that I'll\nstill be alive.\"\n\n\"That?\" said Gwenlyn. \"That's another one. I won't talk about it. It\nimplies that my father's going to retire from Talents, Incorporated.\"\n\nBors fumed.\n\n\"I don't like this prediction business,\" he said. \"It still seems to\nhint that we're not free agents. Tell me,\" he said apprehensively. \"That\nprecognition about me, it doesn't include Madame Porvis?\"\n\nGwenlyn laughed. \"No. Definitely no!\"\n\nBors grunted. Then he managed to grin.\n\n\"In that case I'll go pilfer some provisions so the fleet will be\nprepared to do what you tell me it won't, but which it has to be\nprepared to do. I suppose I'll be back?\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Gwenlyn, smiling.\n\nShe gave him her hand. He left. He shook his head as he made his way to\nthe _Sylva's_ space-boat blister. He had it immediately taken to his new\nship. It was a light cruiser of the same class as the _Isis_. It would,\nof course, seem to be the same ship, and it had nearly the same crew\naboard. No one of Morgan's freakish Talents was included this time, and\nBors felt more than a little relieved. He inspected everything and made\nsure his drive-engineers were more tractable than they'd been on the\n_Isis_. He meant to build another low-power overdrive at once.\n\nHe cleared for departure with the flagship. He was swinging the ship\ntoward his first destination when a call came from the _Sylva_. He was\nasked for. He went to a screen. He preferred to see Gwenlyn when he\ntalked to her. She was there.\n\n\"_I've a memo for you_,\" she said briskly. \"_There are cargo-ships\naground on Cassis and Dover. There is a sort of patrol-squadron of\nwarships aground on Meriden. Nothing on Avino. Are you recording this?_\"\n\n\"I won't forget it,\" he said.\n\n\"_Then here's the situation on each of the subject worlds so far as\ncargo-ships and fighting ships are concerned. Our dowser can tell about\nthem. Remember, this doesn't apply to ships in overdrive! We can't\nprecognize anything about them unless we're at the destination they're\nheading for, and then only the time of arrival. And the dowser's\ninformation is strictly as of this moment._\"\n\nBors nodded. Her tone was absolutely matter-of-fact. Bors was almost\nconvinced.\n\nShe read off a list of statements with painstaking clarity. She'd\nevidently had the dowser go over the list of twenty-two dominated\nplanets. Bors told himself that the events she reported were\npossibilities that might somehow be true.\n\n\"_Most of the Mekinese grand fleet_,\" she finished, \"_is aground on\nMekin itself. It's probably there for inspection and review or some such\nceremony. There's no way to tell. But it's there. And that's the latest\nTalents, Incorporated information. As my father says, you can depend on\nit._\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Bors. \"Thanks.\" Then he added gruffly, \"Take care of\nyourself.\"\n\nShe smiled at him and clicked off. Bors was confused because he couldn't\nquite believe that other matters could be predicted.\n\nThe new ship, the _Horus_, sped away in overdrive, leaving the fleet in\norbit around the useless planet Glamis. Glamis was in a favorable state\njust now. It was a lush green almost from pole to pole, save where its\nseas showed a darker, muddy, bottom-color. It would look inviting to\ncolonists. But at any time its sun could demonstrate its variability and\nturn it into a cloud-covered world of steaming prospective jungle, or in\na slightly shorter time turn it to a glacier-world. The vegetation on\nGlamis was remarkable. The planet, though, was of no use to humanity\nbecause it was unpredictable.\n\nThe _Horus_ ran in overdrive for two days while a low-power unit was\nbuilt in its engine-room, to go in parallel to the normal overdrive. But\nthere was a double-throw switch in the line, now. Either the standard,\nmultiple light-speed overdrive could be used, or the newer and vastly\nslower one, but not both together. The ship came out of overdrive in\nabsolute emptiness with no sun anywhere nearby. She was surrounded on\nevery hand by uncountable distant stars. The new circuit was brazed in.\nIt had a micro-timer included in its design. Within its certain, limited\ntiming-capacity, it could establish or break a contact within the\nthousandth of a microsecond.\n\nBors made tests, target-practice of a sort. He let out a metal-foil\nballoon which inflated itself, making a sphere some forty feet in\ndiameter. In the new low-speed overdrive he drew away from it for a\nlimited number of microseconds. He measured the distance run. He made\nother runs, again measuring. From ten thousand miles away he made a\nreturn-hop to the target-balloon and came out within a mile of it.\n\nHe cheered up. This was remarkably accurate. He sent the ship into\nstandard overdrive again. Twice more, however, he stopped between stars\nand practiced the trick of breaking out of the new overdrive--in which\nhis ship was undetectable--at a predetermined point. The satisfaction of\nsuccessful operation almost made up for the extremely disagreeable\nsensations involved.\n\nBut on the eighth ship-day out from Glamis, the _Horus_ came back to\nunstressed space with a very, very bright star burning almost straight\nahead. The spectroscope confirmed that it was the sun of Meriden.\n\nBors sounded the action alert. Gongs clanged. Compartment-doors hissed\nshut.\n\n\"You know,\" said Bors conversationally into the all-speaker microphone\nand in the cushioned stillness which obtained, \"you all know what we're\naiming at. A food-supply for the fleet. But we've got what looks like a\nvery useful gadget for fighting purposes. We need to test it. There's a\nsmall squadron on Meriden, ahead, so we'll take them on. It is necessary\nthat we get _all of them_, so they can't report anything to Mekin that\nMekin doesn't already know. All hands ready for action!\"\n\nIn twenty minutes by the ship's clocks the _Horus_ was a bare thirty\nthousand miles off the planet Meriden. The new drive worked perfectly\nfor planetary approach, at any rate. It even worked more perfectly than\nthe twenty-minute interval implied. It had been off Meriden for five\nminutes then.\n\nMekinese fighting ships were boiling up from the atmosphere of Meriden\nand plunging out to space to offer battle. They were surprisingly ready,\nreacting like hair-triggered weapons. Bors hadn't completed his\nchallenge before they were streaking toward Meriden's sky. They\ncouldn't have been more prompt if, say, Meriden seethed with rumors\nabout a pirate ship in space, which it was their obligation to fight.\n\nAccording to the radar screens, there were not less than fifteen ships\nstreaking out to destroy the _Horus_. Fifteen to one--interesting odds.\n\nBors sent the _Horus_ roaring ahead to meet them.\n\n\n\n\nPart Four\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\n\nThe Mekinese did not display a sporting spirit. There were four heavy\ncruisers and eleven lighter ships of the _Horus's_ size and armament.\nAccording to current theories of space-battle tactics, two of the light\ncruisers should have disposed of the _Horus_ with ease and dispatch. It\nmight have seemed sportsmanlike and certainly sufficient to give the\n_Horus_ only two antagonists at a time, which would have been calculated\nto provide odds of six hundred to one against it. Two light cruisers\nwould have fired eighteen missiles apiece per salvo, which would have\ndemanded thirty-six missiles from the _Horus_ to meet and destroy them.\nShe couldn't put thirty-six missiles into space at one firing. She would\nhave disappeared in atomic flame at the first exchange of fire. But the\nMekinese were not so generous. They came up in full force loaded for\nbear. They obviously intended not a fight but an execution. Mekinese\ntactics depended heavily on fire-power of such superiority that any\nenemy was simply overwhelmed.\n\nTheir maneuvering proved that they intended to follow standard operation\nprocedure. Light ships reached space and delayed until all were aloft.\nThey formed themselves into a precise half-globe and plunged at top\nsolar-system drive toward the _Horus_. This was strictly according to\nthe book. If the _Horus_ chose, of course, she could refuse battle by\nfleeing into overdrive--which would be expected to be the regulation\nmany-times-faster-than-light variety. If she dared fight, the fifteen\nships drove on. Mekinese ships never struck lightly. The fifteen of them\ncould launch four hundred missiles per salvo. No single ship could\ncounter such an attack. But even Mekinese would not use such stupendous\nnumbers of missiles against one ship unless that ship was famous; unless\nrumors and reports said that it was invincible and dangerous and the\nhope of oppressed peoples under Mekin.\n\nThe _Horus_ received very special attention.\n\nThen she vanished. At one instant she was in full career toward the\nfleet of enemies. The next instant she had wrapped an overdrive field\nabout herself and then no radar could detect her, nor could any missile\npenetrate her protection.\n\nWhen she vanished, the speck which indicated her position disappeared\nfrom the Mekinese radar-screens. The hundredth of a second in overdrive\nas known to the Mekinese should have put her hundreds of millions of\nmiles away. But something new had been added to the _Horus_. The\nhundredth of a second did not mean millions of miles of journeying. It\nmeant something under three thousand, and a much more precise interval\nof time could be measured and used by her micro-timer.\n\nTherefore, at one instant the _Horus_ was some two thousand miles from\nthe lip of the half-globe of enemy ships. Then she was not anywhere.\nThen, before the mind could grasp the fact of her vanishing, she was in\nthe very center, the exact focus of the formation of Mekinese\nbattle-craft. She was at the spot a Mekinese commander would most\ndevoutly wish, because it was equidistant from all his ships, and all\ntheir missiles should arrive at the same instant when their overwhelming\nnumber could not conceivably be parried.\n\nBut it was more than an ideal position from a Mekinese standpoint. It\nwas also a point which was ideal for the _Horus_, because all her\nmissiles would arrive at the encircling ships at the same instant. Each\nMekinese would separately learn--without information from any\nother--that those projectiles could not be intercepted. No Mekinese\nwould have the advantage of watching the tactic practiced on a\ncompanion-ship, to guide his own actions.\n\nThe _Horus_ appeared at that utterly vulnerable and wholly advantageous\nposition. She showed on the Mekinese screens. They launched missiles.\nThe _Horus_ launched missiles.\n\nThe _Horus_ disappeared.\n\nShe reappeared, beyond and behind the half-globe formation. Again she\nshowed on the Mekinese screens. The Mekinese could not believe their\ninstruments. A ship which fled in overdrive could not reappear like\nthis! Having vanished and reappeared once, it could not duplicate the\ntrick. Having duplicated it....\n\nThere was more, and worse. The _Horus_ missiles were not being\nintercepted. Mekinese missiles were swerving crazily to try to\nanticipate and destroy the curving, impossibly-moving objects that went\nout from where the _Horus_ had ceased to be. They failed. Clouds of new\ntrajectiles appeared....\n\nA flare like a temporary sun. Another. Another. Others....\n\nBors turned from the viewport and glanced at the radar-screens. There\nwere thirteen vaporous glowings where ships had been. There were two\ndistinct blips remaining. It could be guessed that some targets had been\nfired on by more than one launching-tube, leaving two ships unattacked\nby the _Horus's_ missiles.\n\nBoth of those ships--one a heavy cruiser--now desperately flung the\ncontents of their magazines at the _Horus_.\n\nBors heard his voice snapping coordinates.\n\n\"Launch all missiles at those two targets,\" he commanded. \"Fire!\nOverdrive coming! Five, four, three, two....\"\n\nThe intolerable discomfort of entry and immediate breakout from\noverdrive was ever present. But the _Horus_ had shifted position five\nthousand miles. Bors saw one of his just-launched missiles--now a\ncontinent away--as it went off. It accounted for one of the two Mekinese\nsurvivors. The radar-blip which told of that ship's existence changed to\nthe vaguely vaporous glow of incandescent gas. The other blip went out.\nNo flare of a bomb. Nothing. It went out.\n\nSo the last Mekinese ship was gone in overdrive. It was safe! It could\nnot possibly be overtaken or attacked. It had seen the _Horus's_\nmissiles following an unpredictable course, which was duly recorded. It\nhad seen the _Horus_ go into overdrive and move only hundreds of miles\ninstead of hundreds of millions. It had seen the _Horus_ vanish from one\nplace and appear at another in the same combat area, launch missiles and\nvanish again before it could even be ranged.\n\nThe last Mekinese ship certainly carried with it the _Horus's_ tactics\nand actions recorded on tape. The technicians of Mekin would set to work\ninstantly to duplicate them. Once they were considered possible--once\nthey were recognized--they could be achieved. The combat efficiency of\nthe Mekinese fleet would be increased as greatly as that of the fleet of\nKandar had been,--and the overwhelming superiority of numbers would\nagain become decisive. The hopeless situation of the Kandarian fleet\nwould become a hundred times worse. And Mekinese counter-intelligence\nwould make a search for the origin of such improvements. Since Kandar\nwas to have been attacked and occupied, it would be a place of special\nsearch.\n\nThe only unsuspected source, of course, would be Talents, Incorporated.\n\nFor a full minute after the enemy ship's disappearance, Bors sat rigid,\nhis hands clenched, facing the disaster the escape of the Mekinese\nconstituted. Sweat appeared on his forehead.\n\nThen he pressed the engine-room button and said evenly, \"Prepare for\nstandard overdrive, top speed possible.\"\n\nHe swung the ship. He lined it up with Mekin itself, which, of course,\nwas the one place where it would be most fatal for a ship from Kandar to\nbe discovered.\n\nVery shortly thereafter, the _Horus_ was in overdrive.\n\nTraveling in such unthinkable haste, it is paradoxic that there is much\ntime to spare. Bors had to occupy it. He prepared a careful and detailed\naccount of exactly how the low-speed overdrive had worked, and its\neffectiveness as a combat tactic. He'd distributed instructions and\nLogan's tables on the subject before leaving Glamis. He would be, of\ncourse, most bitterly blamed for having taken on a whole squadron of\nenemy ships, with the result that one had gotten away. It could be the\nmost decisive of catastrophes. But he made his report with precision.\n\nFor seven successive ship-days there was no event whatever on the\n_Horus_, as she drove toward Mekin. Undoubtedly the one survivor of the\nenemy squadron was fleeing for Mekin, too, to report to the highest\npossible authority what it had seen and experienced. It would not be\nmuch, if at all, slower than the _Horus_. It might be faster, and might\nreach the solar system of Mekin before the _Horus_ broke out there. It\nhad every advantage but one. It had solar-system drive, for use within a\nplanetary group, and it had overdrive for use between the stars. But the\n_Horus_ had an intermediate drive as well, which was faster than the\nenemy's slow speed and slower than the fast.\n\nBors depended on it for the continued existence of Kandar and the fleet.\nAs the desperately tedious ship-days went by he began to have ideas--at\nwhich he consciously scoffed--concerning Tralee. But if anything as\nabsurd as those ideas came to be, there were a score of other planets\nwhich would have to be considered too.\n\nHe sketched out in his own mind a course of action that would be\npossible to follow after breakout off Mekin. It did not follow the rules\nfor sound planning, which always assume that if things can go wrong they\nwill. Bors could only plan for what might be done if things went right.\nBut he could not hope. Not really. Still, he considered every\npossibility, however far-fetched.\n\nHe came to first-breakout, a light-week short of Mekin. The yellow sun\nflamed dead ahead. He determined his distance from it with very great\ncare. The _Horus_ went back into overdrive and out again, and it was\nwell within the system, though carefully not on the plane of its\necliptic.\n\nThen the _Horus_ waited. She was twenty millions of miles from the\nplanet Mekin. Bors ordered that for intervals of up to five minutes no\nelectronic apparatus on the ship should be in operation. In those\nperiods of electronic silence, his radars swept all of space except\nMekin. He had no desire to have Mekin pick up radar-pulses and wonder\nwhat they came from. The rest of the system, though, he mapped. He found\ntwo meteor-streams, and a clump of three planetoids in a nearly circular\norbit, and he spotted a ship just lifted from Mekin by its landing-grid.\nIt went out to five planetary diameters and flicked out of existence so\nfar as radar was concerned.\n\nIt had gone into overdrive and away. Another ship came around Mekin, in\norbit. It reached the spot from which the first ship had vanished. It\nbegan to descend; the landing-grid had locked onto it with projected\nforce-fields and was drawing it down to ground.\n\nBors growled to himself. It was not likely that this ship was the one\nhe'd pursued, sight unseen, since the end of the fight off Meriden. But\nit was a possibility. If it were true, then everything that mattered to\nBors was lost forever.\n\nThen a blip appeared. It was at the most extreme limit of the radar's\nrange. A ship had come out of overdrive near the fourth planetary orbit\nof this solar system.\n\nBors and the yeoman computer-operator figured its distance to six places\nof decimals. Bors set the microsecond timer. The _Horus_ went into\nlow-speed overdrive and out again. Then the electron telescope revealed\na stubby, rotund cargo-ship, about to land on Mekin.\n\nBors swore. It would be days before this tub reached Mekin on\nsolar-system drive. But it must not report that an armed vessel had\ninspected it in remoteness.\n\n\"We haul alongside,\" said Bors angrily. \"Boarding-parties ready in the\nspace-boats.\"\n\nAnother wrenching flicker into overdrive and through breakout without\npause. The cargo-boat was within ten miles.\n\n\"Calling cargo-boat!\" rasped Bors, in what would be the arrogant tones\nof a Mekinese naval officer hailing a mere civilian ship. \"Identify\nyourself!\"\n\nA voice answered apologetically, \"_Cargo-ship_ Empress, _sir, bound from\nLoral to Mekin with frozen foods._\"\n\n\"Cut your drive,\" snapped Bors. \"Stand by for inspection! Muster your\ncrews. There's a criminal trying to get ashore on Mekin. We'll check\nyour hands. Acknowledge!\"\n\n\"_Yes, sir_,\" said the apologetic voice. \"_Obeying, sir._\"\n\nBors fretted. The space-boats left the _Horus's_ side. One clamped onto\nthe airlock of the rounded, bulging tramp-ship. The second lifeboat\nhovered nearby. The first boat broke contact and the second hooked on.\nThe second boat broke contact. Both came back to the _Horus_.\n\nThe screen before Bors lighted up. One of his own crewmen nodded out of\nit.\n\n\"_All clear, sir_,\" said his voice briskly. \"_They behaved like lambs,\nsir. No arms. We've locked them in a cargo hold._\"\n\n\"You know what to do now,\" said Bors.\n\n\"_Yes, sir. Off._\"\n\nTen miles away the cargo-boat swung itself about. Suddenly it was gone.\nIt was on the way to Glamis and the fleet.\n\nAnother hour of watching. Another blip. It was another cargo-carrier\nlike the first. As the other had done, it meekly permitted itself to be\nboarded by what it believed were mere naval ratings of the Mekinese\nspace-fleet, searching for a criminal who might be on board. Like the\nfirst ship, it was soon undeceived. Again like the first, it vanished\nfrom emptiness, and it would be heading for the fleet in its monotonous\ncircling of Glamis.\n\nThe third blip, though, was a light cruiser. The _Horus_ appeared from\nnowhere close beside it and its communicator began to scream in\ngibberish. It would be an official report, scrambled and taped, to be\ntransmitted to ground on the first instant there was hope of its\nreception.\n\n\"Fire one,\" said Bors. \"The skipper there is on his toes.\"\n\nHe watched bleakly as the _Horus's_ missile arched in its impossible\ntrajectory, as the light cruiser flung everything that could be gotten\nout to try to stop it, while its transmitter shrieked gibberish to the\nstars.\n\nThere was a blinding flash of light. Then nothing.\n\n\"He got out maybe fifteen seconds of transmission,\" said Bors somberly,\n\"which may or may not be picked up from this distance, and may or may\nnot tell anything. He got a tape ready while he was in overdrive, with\nplenty of time for the job. My guess is that he'd take at least fifteen\nseconds to identify his ship, give her code number, her skipper, and\nsuch things. I hope so....\"\n\nBut for minutes he was irresolute. He'd send his own minutely detailed\nreport back to Glamis on the second captured ship. He did not need to\nreturn to report in person. He hadn't yet sent back provisions enough\nfor the intended voyage of the fleet. The solar system of Mekin was an\nespecially well-stocked hunting-ground for such marauders as Bors and\nhis crew declared themselves to be--so long as word did not get to\nground on Mekin.\n\nBut it did not get down. From time to time--at intervals of a few\nhours--specks appeared in emptiness. Mekin monopolized the off-planet\ntrade of its satellite world. There would be many times the\nspace-traffic here that would be found off any other planet in the\nMekinese empire.\n\nOne ship got to ground unchallenged. By pure accident it came out of\noverdrive within half a million miles of Mekin. To have attacked it\nwould have been noted. But he got two more cargo-ships. Then he found\nthe _Horus_ alongside a passenger-ship. But it couldn't be allowed to\nground, to report that it had been stopped by an armed ship. A\nprize-crew took it off to Glamis.\n\nBors made a formal announcement to his crew. \"I think,\" he told them\nover the all-speaker circuit, \"that we got the ship which could have\nreported our action off Meriden. I'm sure we've sent four shiploads of\nfood back to the fleet, besides the passenger-ship we'd rather have\nmissed. But there's still something to be done. To confuse Mekin and\nkeep it busy, and therefore off Kandar's neck, we have to start trouble\nelsewhere. From now on we are pirates pure and simple.\"\n\nAnd he headed the _Horus_ for the planet Cassis, which was another\nvictim of the Mekinese. It was a rocky, mountainous world with many\nmines. Mekin depended on it for metal in vast quantities. The _Horus_\nhovered over it and sent down a sardonic challenge. One missile came up\nin defiance. But it was badly aimed and Bors ignored it. Then voices\ncalled to him, sharp with excitement. He heard shots and shouting and a\nvoice said feverishly that rebels on Cassis, who had been fighting in\nthe streets, had rushed a transmitter to welcome the enemies of Mekin.\n\nBors had one light cruiser and merely a minimum crew for it. He couldn't\nbe of much help to insurrectionists. Then he heard artillery-fire over\nthe communicator, and voices gasped that the Mekinese garrison was\ncharging out of its highly-fortified encampment. Bors sent down a\nmissile to break the back of the counter-attack. Then the communicator\ngave off the sound of gunfire and men in battle, and presently yells of\ntriumph.\n\nHe took the _Horus_ away. Its arrival and involvement in the revolt was\npure accident. It was no part of any thought-out plan. But he was wryly\nrelieved when he had convinced himself that Mekin needed the products of\nthis world too much to exterminate its population with fusion-bombs.\n\nMore days of travel in overdrive tedium. Bors was astounded and\nappalled. Interference here would only make matters worse. The _Horus_\nwent on.\n\nThere was a cargo-ship aground on Dover, and the _Horus_ threatened\nbombs and a space-boat went down and brought it up. That ship also went\naway to Glamis where the fleet was accumulating an inconvenient number\nof prisoners. The fact that the capture of this ship only added to that\nnumber made Bors realize that King Humphrey would be especially\ndisturbed about the passengers on the liner sent back from Mekin. Unless\nthey were murdered, sooner or later they would reveal the facts about\nthe Fleet. And King Humphrey was a highly conscientious man.\n\nThere was dissention even on Dover. The landing-party was cheered from\nthe edge of the spaceport. Bors could not understand. He tried to guess\nwhat was going on in the Mekinese empire. He could not know whether or\nnot disaster had yet struck Kandar. He could only hope that there were\nships lurking near it, ready to use the recent technical combat\nimprovements against any single Mekinese ship that might appear, so no\nreport would be carried back. But it seemed to him that utter and\ncomplete catastrophe was inevitable.\n\nHe reflected unhappily about Tralee, and wondered what the Pretender,\nhis uncle, really thought about his loosing of chemical-explosive\nmissiles against puppet government buildings there. He found himself\nworrying again about the truck drivers who'd warned his men of\nbooby-traps in the supplies they delivered. He hoped they hadn't been\ncaught.\n\nThe _Horus_ arrived at Deccan, and called down the savage message of\nchallenge.\n\nThere came a tumultuous, roaring reply.\n\n\"_Captain Bors!_\" cried a voice from the ground exultantly. \"_Land and\nwelcome! We didn't hope you'd come here, but you're a thousand times\nwelcome! We've smashed the garrison here, Captain! We rose days ago and\nwe hold the planet! We'll join you! Come to ground, sir! We can supply\nyou!_\"\n\nBors went tense all over. He'd been called by name! If he was known by\nname on _this_ world--twenty light-years from Mekin and thirty-five from\nKandar--then everything was lost.\n\n\"Can you send up a space-boat?\" he asked in a voice he did not\nrecognize. \"I'd like to have your news.\"\n\nIt must be a trap. It was possible that there'd been revolt on Deccan;\nhe'd found proof of rebellion elsewhere. There'd been claims of revolt\non Cassis, but he hadn't been suspicious then. He'd sent down a missile\nto help the self-proclaimed rebels there. Now he wondered desperately if\nhe'd been tricked there as, it was all too likely, he would be here.\nThere'd been reported fighting on Avino. There was cheering for his men\non Dover, and he might have landed there. But there were too many\ncoincidences, far too many.\n\nHe waited, fifty thousand miles high, with the ship at combat-alert. He\nfelt cold all over. Somehow, news had preceded him. It was garbled\ntruth, but there was enough to make his spine feel like ice.\n\nHe spoke over the all-speaker hook-up, in a voice he could not keep\nsteady by any effort of will.\n\n\"All hands attention,\" he said heavily. \"I just called ground. We have\nhad a reply calling me by name. You will see the implication. It looks\nlike somehow the Mekinese have managed to send word ahead of us. They've\nfound out that no one can stand against us. They know we have new and\ndeadly weapons. Probably there have been orders given to lure us to\nground by the pretense of a successful revolt. It would be hoped that we\ncan be fooled to the point where we will land and our ship can be\ncaptured _undestroyed_.--That's the way it looks.\"\n\nHe swallowed, with difficulty.\n\n\"If that's so,\" he said after an instant, \"you can guess what's been\ndone about Kandar. The grand fleet was assembled on Mekin. It could have\ngone to Kandar....\"\n\nHe swallowed again. Then he said savagely, \"Well make sure first. If the\nworst has happened we'll take our fleet and head for Mekin and pour down\nevery ounce of atomic explosive we've got. We may not be able to turn\nits air to poison, but if there are survivors, they won't celebrate what\nthey did to Kandar!\"\n\nHe clicked off. His fists clenched. He paced back and forth in the\ncontrol room. He almost did not wait to make sure. Almost. But he had\nnever seen a Mekinese fighting man face to face. He'd gone into exile\nwith his uncle when that unhappily reasonable man let Tralee surrender\nrather than be bombed to depopulation. He'd served in the Kandarian navy\nwithout ever managing to be in any port when a Mekinese ship was in.\nHe'd fought in the battle off Kandar, he'd destroyed a Mekinese cruiser\noff Tralee, another in the Mekinese system itself and a squadron off\nMeriden. But he had never seen a Mekinese fighting-man face to face.\nFilled with such hatred as he felt, he meant to do so now.\n\nA space-boat came up from the ground. The _Horus_ trained weapons on it.\nBors painstakingly arranged for its occupants to board the _Horus_ in\nspace-suits, which could not conceal bombs.\n\nThere were six men in the space-boat. They came into the _Horus's_\ncontrol room and he saw that they were young, almost boys. When they\nlearned that he was Captain Bors, they looked at him with shining,\nadmiring, worshipping eyes. It could not be a trick. It could not be a\ntrap. He was incredulous.\n\nThe message from the ground was true.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 11\n\n\nThe news as Bors got it from the men of Deccan was remarkable for two\nreasons: that so much of it was true, and that all of it was glamorized\nand romanticized and garbled. It was astonishing to find any relation at\nall between such fabulously romantic tales and the facts, because there\nwas no way for news to travel between solar systems except on ships, and\nno ships had carried stories like these!\n\nHere on Deccan, the shining-eyed young men _knew_ that Bors had landed\non Tralee and on Garen. They _knew_ that there was a fleet in being\nwhich had fought and annihilated a Mekinese task-force many times its\nsize.\n\nTo the Captain, their knowledge was undiluted catastrophe!\n\nThey admired Bors because they believed he commanded that fleet, which\nhe now had in hiding while he flashed splendidly about the subjugated\nworlds, performing prodigious feats of valor and destruction, half\npirate and half hero. The story had it that he'd been driven from his\nnative Tralee by the invaders, and that now he fought Mekin in\nmagnificent knight-errantry, and that it was _he_ who'd set alight the\nflame of rebellion on so many worlds.\n\nBors listened, and was numbed. He heard references to the fight off\nMeriden, and the temporary escape of one of his enemies, and that he'd\npursued it to the solar system of Mekin itself and there destroyed it\nwhile Mekin watched, helpless to interfere.\n\nThe distortion of facts was astounding. But the mere existence of facts\nat this distance was impossible! Then Bors found himself thinking that\nthese tales sounded like fantasies or daydreams, and he went white. He\nknew what had happened.\n\nJust before he'd left the fleet, he'd talked to a fat woman and a\nscowling man who, together, made up the Talents, Incorporated brand new\nDepartment for Disseminating Truthful Seditious Rumors, so that rumors\nof a high degree of detail got started, nobody knew how. If such rumors\nspread, and everybody heard them, nobody would doubt them. It was\nappallingly probable that the fighting on Cassis and Avino and Deccan\nhad no greater justification in reason than that an enormously fat woman\nromantically pictured such things as resulting from the derring-do of\none Captain Bors, of whom she thought sentimentally and glamorously and\nwithout much discrimination.\n\nBut she'd daydreamed about the fleet, too! And that it had destroyed a\nMekinese squadron many times its size....\n\nHe heard the leader of the young men from Deccan speaking humorously.\n\"Your revolt, sir,\" he told Bors, \"is spreading everywhere! On Cela,\nsir, there are great space-ship yards, where they build craft for the\nMekinese navy. Not long ago they finished one and it went out to space\nfor a trial run. It didn't come back. Sabotage. Everybody knew it. The\nMekinese raged. A little while later they finished another ship. But the\nMekinese were smart! They sent it off for its trial run with only Celans\non board. If there were sabotage this time, it wouldn't be Mekinese who\ndied in space! But that ship didn't come back either! It touched down\nhere, sir, three weeks ago, and we supplied it with food and missiles\nand some of us joined it. It went off to try to find you.\"\n\n\"I'd better--go after it,\" said Bors, dry-throated. \"It could blunder\ninto trouble. At best--\"\n\nThe youthful leader of Deccan's revolt grinned widely.\n\n\"It's got plenty of missiles,\" he told Bors. \"It can take care of\nitself! And it has plenty of food. We even gave them target-balloons to\npractice launching missiles on. We've been storing up missiles to lay an\nambush for a Mekinese squadron if one comes by. A lot of us joined the\nship, though.\"\n\n\"In any case,\" said Bors, with the feel of ashes in his throat, \"I'll\ntrack it down so it can join the fleet.\"\n\nHe could not bring himself to tell these confident and admiring young\nmen that there was no hope and never had been; that the tales of his\nachievements were only partly true and that they had popped into\npeople's minds because a very fat woman far away indulged in daydreams\nand fantasies.\n\nThey wouldn't have understood. If they had, they wouldn't have believed.\nHe found that he savagely resisted the conviction himself. But there was\nno other way for such garbled tales with such a substratum of fact to be\nspread among the stars. And whoever spread them knew of events up to the\nlast news sent back by Bors, but nothing after that. Undoubtedly,\nTalents, Incorporated's Department for Disseminating Truthful Seditious\nRumors had been at work on Mekin, but the damage done elsewhere was a\nthousand times greater than any benefit done there.\n\nIt was too late to repair the damage, here or anywhere else. This planet\nand all the rest were too far committed to rebellion ever to be forgiven\nby Mekin. Mekin would take revenge. It was not pleasant to think about.\n\nSo the _Horus_ departed, and traveled in high-speed overdrive for\nship-days seemingly without end, toward Glamis. It knew nothing that\nhappened outside its own cocoon of overdrive field. It knew nothing of\nany of the thousands of myriads of stars, whose planetary systems\noffered unlimited room for humanity to live in freedom and without fear.\n\nDuring the journey Bors only endured being alive. All this disaster was\nultimately his fault. The fleet's survival was due to his work with\nTalents, Incorporated. The raids of a single ship--which now would have\nsuch disastrous results--were the fruits of his suggestion, the\nconsequence of his actions.\n\nTalents, Incorporated was involved, to be sure, but only because he'd\nallowed it to be. He should have realized that Madame Porvis would work\nhavoc if her talent was as described. No mere romantic daydreamer would\nfashion fantasies with military secrecy in mind and security as a\nprinciple. Everything was betrayed. Everything was ruined. And if he,\nBors, had only been properly skeptical, the fleet would have been\ndestroyed and Kandar now occupied by the Mekinese--doomed to servitude\nbut not necessarily to annihilation--and other worlds would also be\nsafely servile. They'd still be resentful and they'd bitterly hate\nMekin, but they would not have before them the monstrous vengeance now\nin store.\n\nBors, in fact, felt guilty because he was still alive.\n\nThere was only one small thing he could still try to set aright. He\ncould insist that Morgan take Gwenlyn far away from the dangerous\npossibility that Mekin might somehow find her. He _had_ to make Morgan\nsee the need for it. If necessary, he would convince King Humphrey that\na royal order must be issued to send the _Sylva_ light-centuries away,\nbefore the Mekinese empire began to restore itself to devastated\ncalm--if that process hadn't already begun.\n\nMekin had its grand fleet assembled and ready. If convincing and,\nunfortunately, truthful rumors ran about Mekin, as elsewhere, concerning\nthe fleet and Bors's attempts to hide it, then their dictator need only\ngive a single order and the grand fleet would lift off. When it found\nKandar unoccupied it would leave Kandar dead. Then it would seek out the\nfleet, and destroy it, and then it would move from one to another of\nits rebellious tributaries and take revenge upon them....\n\nAnd Bors could only hope to salvage the life of one girl from the\nwreckage of everything that human beings prefer to believe in. He could\nonly hope to send Gwenlyn away--if he was not already too late.\n\nThe _Horus_ broke out into normal space twelve days after leaving\nDeccan. The untrustworthy sun of Glamis still shone brightly. The inner\nplanet revolved about it with one side glowing low red heat and the\nother side piled high with frozen atmosphere. The useless outer planet\nremained a lush green, save for its seas. And the fleet still circled it\nfrom pole to pole.\n\nBors had himself ferried to the flagship by space-boat, because what he\nhad to report was too disheartening to be spoken where all the fleet\nmight hear. Gwenlyn met him at the flagship's airlock. She looked very\nglad, as if she'd been uneasy about him.\n\n\"Call for a boat,\" Bors commanded her curtly, \"to take you to the\n_Sylva_. Go on board with anybody else who belongs on it, your father,\nanybody. I'm going to ask the king to insist that the _Sylva_ get away\nfrom here--fast! Before the Mekinese turn up.\"\n\nGwenlyn shook her head, her eyes searching his face.\n\n\"The _Sylva's_ not here. It's gone to Kandar as a sort of\ndispatch-boat.\"\n\nBors groaned.\n\n\"Then I'll try to get another ship assigned to take you away,\" he said\nformidably. \"Maybe one of the captured cargo-ships I sent back.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Gwenlyn. \"They're going to be released. They'll go to Mekin,\nand we _couldn't_ go there!\"\n\nBors groaned again. Then he said savagely, \"Wait here for me. I'll\narrange something as soon as I've seen the king.\"\n\nHe strode down the corridor to King Humphrey's cabin. A sentry came to\nattention. Bors passed through a door. The king and half a dozen of the\ntop-ranking officers of the fleet were listening apathetically to\nMorgan, at once vexed and positive and uncertain.\n\n\"But you can't ignore it!\" protested Morgan. \"I don't understand it\neither, but you'll agree that since my precognizer said no ship but\nBors's is coming here--and he precognized every one of the prizes before\nthey arrived--you'll concede that the Mekinese aren't coming here. So\nyou're going out to meet them.\"\n\nHe saw Bors, and breathed an audible sigh of relief.\n\n\"Bors!\" he said in a changed tone. \"I'm glad you're back!\"\n\nBors said grimly, \"Majesty, I've very bad news.\"\n\nKing Humphrey shrugged. He spoke in a listless voice.\n\n\"I doubt it differs from ours. You captured a passenger-liner off Mekin,\nyou will remember. You sent it here. When it arrived we found that all\nits passengers knew that Kandar was not occupied and that the fleet sent\nto capture it had not reported back.\"\n\n\"My news is worse,\" said Bors. \"The continued existence of our fleet,\nand the fact that it defeated a Mekinese force, is common knowledge on\nat least five planets--all of them now in revolt against Mekin.\"\n\nThe king's expression had reached the limit of reaction to disaster. It\ndid not change. He looked almost apathetic.\n\n\"Mekin,\" he said dully, \"sent a second squadron to Kandar to investigate\nthe rumors of defeat. We have a very tiny force there--three ships. Of\ncourse our ships won't attack the Mekinese, but they might as well.\nKnowing that we destroyed their first fleet and that we still live,\nMekin will assuredly retaliate.\"\n\n\"And not only on Kandar,\" said Bors. \"On Tralee and Garen and Cassis and\nMeriden--\"\n\nMorgan interrupted.\n\n\"Majesty! All this is more reason to listen to me! I've been telling you\nthat all my Talents agree--\"\n\nKing Humphrey interrupted tonelessly, \"We've made our final\narrangements, Bors. We are going to release the cargo-ships and the\npassenger-ship you sent us. We will use them as messengers. We are\ngoing to send a message of surrender, to Mekin.\"\n\nBors swallowed. His most dismal forebodings had produced nothing more\nhopeless than this moment.\n\n\"Majesty--\"\n\n\"We have to sacrifice,\" said the king in a leaden voice, \"not only our\nlives but our self-respect, to try to gain something less than the total\nannihilation of Kandar. We shall tell the Mekinese that we will return\nto Kandar and form up in space. If they send a small force to accept our\nsurrender, they shall have it. If they prefer to destroy us, they can do\nthat also. But we submit ourselves to punishment for having resisted the\noriginal fleet. We admit our guilt. And we beg Mekin not to avenge that\nresistance upon our people, who are not guilty.\"\n\nBors tried to speak, and could not. There was a sodden, utterly\nunresilient stillness in the room, as if all the high officers of the\nfleet were corpses and the king himself, though he spoke, was not less\ndead.\n\nThen Morgan moved decisively. He moved away from the spot where he had\nbeen engaged in impassioned argument. He took Bors by the arm, and\nhustled him through the door.\n\n\"Come along!\" he said urgently. \"Something's got to be done! You have\nthe knack of thinking of things to do! The king's intentions--\"\n\nThe door closed behind him and he broke off. He wiped sweat from his\nforehead with one hand while he thrust Bors on with the other. They came\nto a cabin evidently assigned to him. Gwenlyn waited there.\n\n\"Craziness!\" said Morgan bitterly. \"Craziness! I get the finest group of\nTalents that ever existed! I teach them to think! I instruct them! And\nthey can't think of what is going to happen. And everything depends on\nit! Everything!\"\n\n\"When will the _Sylva_ be back?\" demanded Bors.\n\nMorgan automatically looked at his watch. Gwenlyn opened her mouth to\nspeak. Morgan shook his head impatiently. Gwenlyn was silent.\n\n\"My ship-arrival Talent's with the _Sylva_,\" said Morgan harassedly. \"We\nsent him to Kandar to find out if the Mekinese fleet's coming there, and\nwhen. It isn't coming here. He said so.\"\n\n\"It'll go to Kandar,\" said Bors bitterly, \"to destroy it. I imagine\nwe'll go there too, to be destroyed.\"\n\n\"But it's insane!\" protested Morgan. \"Look! You captured a\npassenger-ship off Mekin. Right?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You sent it here with all its passengers. Right?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"One of the passengers said he was a clairvoyant. Hah!\" Morgan expressed\nthe ultimate of disgust. \"He was a fortune-teller! He didn't know there\nwas anything better than that! A fortune-teller! But he's a Talent! He's\na born charlatan, but he's an authentic Talent, and he doesn't know what\nthat is! He thinks predictions as Madame Porvis thinks scandals! And\nthey're just as crazy! But he _is_ a Talent and they have to be right!\"\n\nBors said, \"You're going to take Gwenlyn away from here,--and fast!\"\n\nMorgan paid no attention. He was embittered, and agitated, and in\nparticular, he was frustrated.\n\n\"It's all madness!\" he protested almost hysterically. \"Here we've got a\nfirm precognition that King Humphrey's going to open parliament on\nKandar next year, and there's another one--\"\n\nGwenlyn said quickly, \"Which you won't tell!\"\n\n\"Which I won't tell. But something's got to happen! Something's got to\nbe done! And this crazy Talent gives me a crazy precognition and looks\nproud because I can't make sense of it! What the hell can you make out\nof a precognition that Mekin will be defeated when an enemy fleet\nsubmits to destruction, lying still in space? There's no sense to it!\n_My_ Talents wouldn't think of anything idiotic like that! They've got\nbetter sense! But when this lunatic said it, they could precognize it\ntoo! It's so! They couldn't think of it themselves, but when this\nMekinese Talent does, they know it's true. But it can't be!\"\n\nBors said coldly, \"The fleet's going to be destroyed, certainly. If that\nwill defeat Mekin. But Gwenlyn is not to stay aboard to be destroyed\nwith it! How are you going to get her away?\"\n\n\"The king's waiting for the _Sylva_ to come back,\" Morgan said\nindignantly, \"so he'll know--my ship-arrival Talent went to find out--if\nthe Mekin fleet's going to Kandar, and when. He insists that if they\nknow the fleet exists, they know where it is and will come here looking\nfor it. But Madame Porvis couldn't have told that in her daydreaming.\nShe didn't _know_ what planet we're circling! She couldn't have spread\nthat fact by contagion!\"\n\n\"She spread plenty more!\" said Bors. \"Her daydreams were too damned\ntrue!\"\n\nGwenlyn said, \"It's a contradiction in terms for a fleet to win a battle\nby letting itself be destroyed. Perhaps the Captain--\"\n\n\"It's also a contradiction in terms,\" said Bors bitterly, \"for all our\ntroubles to come because we won a victory. Now we regret that we weren't\nall killed. But it's madness for the king to propose to get us all\nslaughtered in hope of rousing the Mekinese better nature!\"\n\n\"Maybe you can resolve it, Captain,\" said Gwenlyn thoughtfully. \"Could\nit be that it isn't a contradiction but only a paradox?\"\n\nBors spread his hands helplessly. Of all times and circumstances, this\nparticular moment and situation seemed the least occasion for quibbling\nover words.\n\nThen he said, \"Yes.... It could be a paradox. If this prediction by that\nwild Talent is true, there is a way it could win a fight. I don't\nbelieve it, but I'm going to put something in motion. Nothing can make\nmatters worse!\"\n\nHe turned and strode back to the council room where King Humphrey and\nthe high commanders of his fleet sat like dead men, waiting for the\nmoment to be killed, to no purpose.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 12\n\n\nBors got nowhere, of course. His proposal had all the ear-marks of\nlunacy of purest ray serene. He proposed urgently to equip all the ships\nof the fleet with the low-power overdrive fields. It could be done in\ndays. Instructions were already distributed and would have been studied\nand understood. The fleet would then go to Kandar--if it appeared that\nthe Mekinese grand fleet would go there--and set up a dummy fleet of\ntarget-globes in war array. This would be a fleet, but not of fighting\nships. It would be a fleet of metal-foil inflated balloons.\n\nOne actual fighting ship, he stipulated, would form part of this\nillusory space-navy. He volunteered the _Horus_ for it. That ship would\nsignal to the Mekinese when they arrived. It would make the king's\nproposal to surrender, on the Mekinese promise to spare the civilian\npopulation of Kandar. If the enemy admiral agreed to these terms and the\nking believed him, then the true Kandarian fleet could appear and yield\nto its overwhelmingly-powerful enemy. If the admiral arrogantly refused\nto pledge safety to Kandar's population, then the dummy formation might\nbe destroyed, but the fleet would fight. Hopelessly and\nuselessly--though the new low-power drive worked well in action--but it\nwould fight.\n\nThe First Admiral said stonily, \"If I were in the position of the\nMekinese admiral, and I agreed to terms of capitulation, and if it were\nthen shown to me that the basis of the terms was a deceit, I would not\nfeel bound by my promise. When the actual fleet appeared, I would blast\nit for questioning my honor.\"\n\nBors looked at him with hot eyes. The king said drearily, \"No, Bors. We\nmust act in good faith. We cannot question the Mekinese good faith as\nyou propose, and then expect them to believe in ours. The admiral is\nright. We can fight and bring destruction on our people, or we can place\nourselves at the mercy of Mekin. There can be only one choice. We\nsacrifice ourselves, but we keep our honor.\"\n\n\"I deny,\" said Bors savagely, \"that any man keeps his honor who enslaves\nhis fellows, as you will do in surrendering. I resign my commission in\nyour service, Majesty.\"\n\nKing Humphrey nodded wearily.\n\n\"Very well. You have served us admirably, Bors. I wish I thought you\nwere right in this matter. I would rather follow your advice than my\nconvictions. Your resignation is accepted.\"\n\nAn hour later, fuming, Bors paced back and forth across the floor of a\ncabin in the flagship. The Pretender of Tralee entered. The older man\nlooked wryly amused.\n\n\"It was a most improper thing to do. You resigned your commission and\nthen ordered the low-power fields built on all ships.\"\n\n\"To the contrary,\" said Bors, \"I spread the news that I had resigned my\ncommission _because_ the low-power fields were _not_ to be installed to\ngive us a fighting chance!\"\n\nThe Pretender sat down and regarded his nephew quizzically.\n\n\"But is it so important? To use tables of calculations instead of\ncomputers?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bors. \"It is important. I should know. I've used the\nlow-power fields in combat. Nobody else has.\"\n\nThe old man said without reproof, \"The First Admiral is indignant. The\nfields were not ordered on the ground that they're an untested device\nand that at least once such a field blew out, leaving your ship, the\n_Isis_, so helpless that it had to be abandoned.\"\n\n\"True,\" agreed Bors. He made no defense. The attitude of the First\nAdmiral would have been perfectly logical in ordinary times. Anything\nlike the new intermediate, low-power overdrive field should have been\nproposed through channels, examined by a duly-appointed commission of\nofficers, reported on, the report evaluated, and then painstaking and\nlengthy tests made and the report on the tests evaluated. Then it should\nhave been submitted to another commission of officers of higher rank,\nwho would estimate the kind and amount of modification of standard\nequipment the new device required, its susceptibility to accident and/or\nobsolescence, the ease of repair, the cost of installation and the\nlength of time in-port required to install it. Somewhere along the line\nthere should also have been a report on the ease with which it could be\nintegrated into other apparatus and standard operational procedures, and\nthere should have been reports on its possible tactical value, the\nprobable number of times it would be useful, the degree of its utility\nand whether the excessive discomfort of going into and out of overdrive\nat extremely short intervals would have an adverse effect on crew\nmorale. Under normal circumstances a ship might have been equipped, for\ntesting purposes, in six to ten years, and in ten years more all new\nships might be equipped. But it would be well over a generation before\nits use was general.\n\nThe older man said, \"Since your resignation's been accepted, you'll be\nput on the _Sylva_ when it comes back. You won't be taken to Kandar with\nthe fleet.\"\n\nBors's hands clenched.\n\n\"They'll say I resigned to stay out of the fight!\"\n\n\"No,\" said his uncle mildly. \"They'll say you resigned to avoid\nsurrender. I'm being evicted with you. I'm to be dumped on the\nhospitality of your friend, Morgan, too. Humphrey is a very kindly man.\nAbominably so. But I am tired of being an exile. I'd really rather stay\nwith the fleet. But he stands on his dignity to preserve our lives. I'm\nnot sure what for, in a universe where such things as Mekin can happen.\"\n\n\"They happen,\" growled Bors, \"because we value peace and quiet as much\nas the Mekinese do power, and much less than freedom. We compromise.\"\n\nHe paced up and down.\n\n\"Up to now,\" he said harshly, \"every effort made against Mekin has been\ndefensive. Twenty-two worlds, in turn, have fallen because they only\nwanted to _stop_ Mekin. It's time for some world to resolve very solidly\nto _smash_ Mekin, to act with honest anger against a thing that should\nbe hated. It's got to be done!\"\n\n\"The time for such a resolution,\" said his uncle, gently, \"went by long\nago.\"\n\nThere was sudden voice from the compartment speaker.\n\n\"_Co-o-o-ntact!_\"\n\nThere was the hissing sound of doors closing. The peculiarly-muffled\nsilence of a closed compartment fell. The Pretender said quietly, \"If\nthis is the Mekinese fleet, everything is solved. But your friends of\nTalents, Incorporated will have to be wrong. They insist the grand fleet\nwill not come here.\"\n\nBors rasped, \"I wish I were in that control room! But at least we've got\nmissiles they can't intercept!\"\n\n\"Except that they won't be fired, they're a great improvement,\" the\nPretender said mildly.\n\nHe sat at ease. Time passed. Presently the tiny compartment\nair-refresher hummed, bringing down the CO{2} content of the air. It cut\noff. Bors paced up and down, up and down. He pictured what might be\nhappening outside. It could be that the grand fleet of Mekin had\nappeared and now drove proudly toward Glamis. It could be that the fleet\nwas offering surrender. There would be near-mutiny on many of its ships.\nThere would be monumental frustration. Junior officers, in particular,\nwould have examined the low-power overdrive tables, and would have\nstudied longingly the reports of Bors's use of low-power overdrive\nagainst an enemy squadron off Meriden. They would yearn passionately to\nhave their ships equipped with apparatus by which it could vanish from a\nplace where it was a target to reappear elsewhere, unharmed, and make\nthe enemy its target. Two fleets equipped with the new device might\ncheckmate each other. But one fleet....\n\nThe speaker said curtly:\n\n\"_Captain Bors, a single ship has broken out of overdrive. It\nidentifies itself as the ship_ Liberty, _of Cela. It declares that it\nhas come to place itself under your command._\"\n\nBors stared. He had forgotten about the two Cela-built ships which the\nDeccan rebels told him about--the first of which had gone on a trial run\nwith a Mekinese crew and failed to return, and the second of which, with\na Celan crew, had gone off to look for Bors and his marauders.\n\nSomehow, it had found him. It seemed totally improbable. Bors instantly\nthought of Talents, Incorporated. The Talents on the ship had spread\nrebellion on worlds unthinkable distances apart. It was conceivable that\nin some way they'd brought this ship to Glamis.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Bors coldly, in the cabin to which he was confined. \"I\nrequest to be put on board.\"\n\n\"I'll come with you,\" said his uncle. He smiled at Bors, who noted, but\nwas not surprised at, the genuineness of the smile. \"This is the ship\nyou mentioned as hoping to emulate the _Horus_. I don't think you'll\nsurrender it. But I've surrendered once and I don't like it. I'd rather\nnot do it again.\"\n\nCompartment-doors went back to normal, as combat-alert went off. Morgan\nappeared, agitated and upset.\n\n\"What's this?\" he demanded. \"What's happened?\"\n\nBors told him curtly as much as he knew, all that he'd been told on\nDeccan. It was the only ship technically in actual rebellion against\nMekin. It had heard rumors of Bors, and it wanted his leadership.\n\n\"But you can't go now!\" insisted Morgan. \"You've got to wait until the\n_Sylva_ gets back! You have to have Talents, Incorporated information to\nact on! You need my Talents!\"\n\n\"I'm going to get moving as fast as I can,\" said Bors. \"I don't think we\ncan wait. If the _Liberty's_ what I think, and her crew what I believe,\nthey'll crave action.\"\n\nThere was a space-boat at the flagship's lock. Bors and his uncle\nentered. Those already in the boat were young men in the nondescript\nclothing of ship-workers. They grinned proudly at Bors when he took his\nseat.\n\n\"I don't know whether you know, sir,\" said the young man at the\nspace-boat's controls, \"but we heard about your revolt, sir, and we were\nabout at the limit so we--\"\n\n\"I stopped at Deccan,\" Bors said briefly. \"They told me about you. Do\nyou want action against Mekin?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir!\" It was a chorus.\n\n\"You'll get it,\" said Bors. \"I'll try you out on a concentration of\nMekin ships that should be turning up at Kandar. How are you equipped\nfor repairs and changes?\"\n\n\"We left Cela for a test trip, sir,\" said the young man at the controls.\nThere were grins behind him. He chuckled. \"Naturally we had materials to\nrepair anything that went wrong on a trial run!\"\n\n\"I've got some new settings for missiles,\" said Bors, \"which make them\nhard to dodge. And we'll want to set up a special overdrive control,\nwhich makes it easy to dodge Mekinese ones. We can attend to it on the\nway to Kandar. How many aboard?\"\n\nHe asked other curt questions. They answered. What Bors asked was what a\ncommanding officer would need to know about a new ship, and his new\nfollowers realized it. They had been exultant and triumphant when he\nentered the space-boat. In the brief time needed to get to the _Liberty_\nthey became ardently confident.\n\nHis reception was undisciplined but enthusiastic. He made a hurried\ninspection. The _Liberty_ had started out with a skeleton crew of\nshipyard workers and no stores or arms. The ranks were now filled with\nvolunteers from Deccan and elsewhere, and its storage-rooms fairly\nbulged with foodstuffs. Bors, however, really relaxed only once. That\nwas when he saw the filled racks of missiles. On Deccan they'd been\nlavish in their gifts to the rebel space-ship.\n\nBors went into the control room, glanced about, and spoke crisply into\nthe all-speaker microphone.\n\n\"All hands attention! Bors speaking. A concentration of Mekinese ships\nis expected at Kandar. We shall head for that planet immediately. On the\nway I shall arrange for some changes in the settings of the missiles we\nhave on board. We will fix and distribute aiming-tables for their use.\nWe will stop twice on the way for target practice. Much more than your\nlives or mine depends on how well you do your work. We'll also modify\nthe overdrive to make this ship able to do everything my other ships\ndid--and more. You will work much harder on the way to Kandar than you\never worked before, but we have to accomplish more than usual. That's\nall.\"\n\nHe stood by while the ship was aimed for Kandar. The young astrogator\nsaid enthusiastically, \"Prepare for overdrive. Five, four, three--\"\n\nA voice out of a speaker:\n\n\"_Calling_ Liberty! _Calling_ Liberty! _Morgan calling_ Liberty!\"\n\n\"Hold it,\" said Bors.\n\nHe answered the call. Morgan's voice, in a high state of agitation,\n\"_Bors! The_ Sylva's _just back! Just broke out! The grand fleet will\nget to Kandar in five days, four hours, twenty minutes! My Talent on\nthe_ Sylva _is sure of it. It's Talents, Incorporated information!_\"\n\n\"We haven't any time to spare, then,\" said Bors.\n\n\"_Bors!_\" panted Morgan's voice. \"_There were three ships of our fleet\nhanging about, on watch for Mekinese. They expected one. Twelve came.\nThe observation-ships attacked. They got eleven of the twelve. The last\none went into overdrive and got away! Bors! Do you see what that\nmeans?_\"\n\n\"It means,\" said Bors coldly, \"that Mekin won't be accepting surrenders\nthis week. Destroying the first division was bad enough. I got one off\nMeriden. Now that a third squadron's wiped out, Mekin will insist on\nsomebody getting punished--and plenty! All right! We're leaving for\nKandar now.\"\n\nHe nodded to the young man at the control board. He noted with approval\nthat he'd kept the _Liberty's_ aim exact while Bors talked to Morgan.\n\n\"Proceed,\" Bors ordered.\n\nThe young man said, \"Five, four, three, two, one--\"\n\nThere was the familiar dizzying sensation of going into overdrive. The\n_Liberty_ wrapped stressed space about itself and went hurtling into\ninvisibility.\n\nThis was one voyage in overdrive which was not tedious. Bors had to\norganize the ship for combat. He had to train launching-crews to work\nlike high-speed machinery. He had to teach the setting of missiles for\nranges he had to show how to measure. Once he stopped the ship between\nstars and all the launching-crews took shots at an inflated metal-foil\ntarget. The Pretender of Tralee displayed an unexpected gift for\norganization. He divided all space outside the ship into sectors,\nassigning one launcher to each sector. If an order to fire came, the\nseparate crews would cover targets in their own areas first. There would\nbe no waste of missiles on one target.\n\nThe Pretender would have made an excellent officer. He was patient with\nthose who did not understand immediately. He had dignity that was not\narrogance. In five days the _Liberty_ was a fighting ship and a\ndedicated one. There were rough edges, of course. Man for man and weapon\nfor weapon the ship would not compare with a longer-trained and more\nexperienced fighting instrument. But the morale on board was superb and\nthe weapons were--to put it mildly--inspiring of hope.\n\nThe _Liberty_ broke out of overdrive and the sun of Kandar shone fiery\nyellow in emptiness. The gas-giant planet had moved in its orbit. It was\nmore evenly in line than before with a direct arrival-path for a fleet\nfrom Mekin. Bors was worn out from his unremitting efforts to turn the\nship into a smooth-running unit. He looked at a ship's clock.\n\n\"The Mekinese,\" he said over the all-speaker circuit, \"will break out in\ntwo hours, forty minutes. And we're going to set up a dummy fleet for\nthem to deal with.\"\n\nHis uncle said gently, \"I suggest some rest, to be fresh for the\nhandling of the ship. I'll set up the dummy fleet.\"\n\nBors resisted the idea, but it was not sensible to humor his own vanity\nby insisting on his indispensability. He flung himself down on a bunk.\nHe was much better satisfied with the ship and crew than he would have\nadmitted. And he was dead-tired.\n\nAround him, young men of Cela and Deccan prepared target-globes for\nlaunching. The Pretender gently pointed out that the formation was to\nremain perfectly still and in ranks. Therefore, each globe had to be\nlaunched with no velocity at all, so it would remain in fixed position\nwith relation to the others, to convincingly appear to be a fleet of\nships.\n\nFar away the _Sylva_ hurtled through space with a much-agitated Morgan\non board. Gwenlyn, too, was frightened. For the first time, both of them\nseemed doubtful of the value of Talents, Incorporated information.\n\nAgain, far away, the fleet of Kandar rushed through emptiness. On its\nvarious ships, junior officers had come threateningly close to mutiny.\nThere was now a sullen, resigned submission to discipline and what\norders might be given, but the fleet was fighting angry. The _Sylva_ had\nbrought back news of a third defeat of Mekinese by Kandar ships and hot\nblood longed to make a full-scale test of its own deadliness. There were\nfew ships of the fleet which did not have a low-power overdrive field\nunit ready to be spliced into circuit if the occasion arose. If the king\ncould not make acceptable terms for surrender, the junior officers were\nprepared to make a victory by Mekin a very costly matter.\n\nStretched out on his bunk, Bors thought of all these things. Finally he\nslept--and--dreamed. It was odd that anyone so weary should dream. It\nwas more strange that he did not dream of the matters in the forefront\nof his mind. He dreamed of Gwenlyn. She was crying, in the dream, and it\nwas because she thought he was killed. And Bors was astonished at her\ngrief, and then unbelievably elated. And he moved toward her and she\nraised her head at some sound he made. The expression of incredulous joy\non her face made him put his arms around her with an enormous and\nunbelieving satisfaction. And he kissed her and the sensation was\nremarkable.\n\nHalf-awake, he blinked at the ceiling of the control room of the\n_Liberty_. His uncle was saying amiably to the young man at the\ncontrol-board, \"That's a very pretty fleet-formation, if we do say so\nourselves!\"\n\nBors stood up, one-half of his mind still startled by his dream, but the\nother half reverting instantly to business.\n\nBut all matters of business had been attended to. Out the viewports he\ncould see the dummy fleet in an apparently defensive formation. Its\nships were only miles apart, and if they had been fighting ships, every\none could have launched missiles at any point of attack from the pattern\nthey constituted. At a hundred miles they could be seen only as specks\nof reflected sunlight. At greater distances a radar would identify them\nonly as dots which must be enemy ships because the radar-blips they made\nlacked the nimbus of friendly craft.\n\n\"Hm,\" said Bors. He looked at the clock. \"The Mekinese should have\nbroken out five minutes ago.\"\n\n\"They did,\" said his uncle. \"They're yonder. They're heading straight\nfor this fleet.\"\n\nHe pointed, not out a port but at a screen where a boiling mass of\nbright specks showed the Mekinese fleet just out of overdrive and\nspeeding toward the dummy formation, sorting itself into attack\nformation as it moved.\n\n\"The king's not here on time,\" observed Bors grimly. \"We have to play\nhis hand for him, Uncle. We haven't the right to commit Kandar by\nbeginning to fight ourselves. Offer surrender, as he'd wish it to be\ndone. If they accept, he can carry out his part when he arrives. He'll\nbe here!\"\n\nThe former monarch spoke gently into a beam transmitter.\n\n\"Calling Mekinese fleet,\" he said. \"Defending fleet calling Mekinese\nfleet!\"\n\nIn seconds a reply came back.\n\n\"_Mekinese Grand Admiral calling Kandar_,\" the voice answered\narrogantly. \"_What do you want?_\"\n\n\"We will discuss capitulation on behalf of Kandar,\" said the old man.\n\"Will you give us terms?\"\n\nHe grimaced, and said, aside, to Bors, \"I'm speaking for Humphrey as I\nknow he'd speak. But I am ashamed!\"\n\nThere was a pause. It took time for the Pretender's voice to reach the\nenemy and as long for the reply to come back. The reply was ironic and\narrogant and amused.\n\n\"_What terms can you hope for?_\" it demanded. \"_You attacked our ships.\nYou indulged in destruction! How can you hope for terms?_\"\n\nThe Pretender scratched his ear thoughtfully. He regarded the radar\nscreen with regret.\n\n\"We ask life for the people of our planet,\" he said steadily. He was\nannoyed that he had to speak for the tardy King of Kandar. \"We ask that\nthey not be punished for our resistance.\"\n\nThe young men in the control room looked astonished. Then they saw\nBors's expression, and grinned.\n\nA long pause. The boiling, shifting specks on the radar-screen began to\nhave a definite order. The Mekinese voice, when it came, was triumphant\nand overbearing.\n\n\"_We will spare your planet_,\" it said contemptuously, \"_but not you.\nYou have dared to fight us. Stand and be destroyed, and there will be no\npunishment for your world. There are no other terms._\"\n\nThe Pretender looked at Bors. He shrugged.\n\n\"_Now_ what would the king do?\" He looked puzzled.\n\n\"What can our dummy fleet do?\" asked Bors.\n\nThe Pretender nodded. \"We will offer no resistance,\" he said into the\ntransmitter.\n\nThere was a long silence. Bors looked at the radar-screen. The mass of\nbright specks at the edge of the screen seemed to have sent a shining\nwave before it. It was actually a swarm of missiles. They were so far\naway that they could not be picked up as individuals on the screen. They\nwere a glow, a shine, a wave of pale luminosity.\n\n\"We shift to low-power overdrive readiness,\" said Bors. \"That is an\norder.\"\n\nA ship-voice murmured, \"_Low-power overdrive in circuit, sir._\"\n\nHe watched the screen. The Mekinese missiles accelerated at a terrific\nrate. They left their parent ships far behind. They were a third of the\nway to the drone-fleet and the _Liberty_ before Bors spoke again.\n\n\"Launch and inflate another target-globe,\" he ordered drily. \"We could\nspeak for the king since he was late. But we won't stay here to be\nkilled as his proxy! Not without fighting first!\"\n\nA voice, crisp: \"_Target globe launched, sir._\"\n\n\"Low-power overdrive toward the gas-giant planet. One-twentieth second.\nFive, four, three, two, one!\"\n\nThere was the unbearable double sensation of going into, and breakout\nfrom, overdrive simultaneously. The _Liberty_ vanished from its place in\nthe formation of the dummy fleet, but left a metal-foil dummy where it\nhad been. It reappeared a full five thousand miles away.\n\nThe rushing missiles now were brighter. They were individual,\nmicroscopic specks like stars. They began visibly to converge upon the\nspace occupied by the dummy fleet.\n\n\"They'll be counting the ships,\" said the Pretender mildly, \"to make\nsure that all stay for their execution. This would be a tragic sight if\nit were Humphrey's real fleet. He is just obstinate enough to let\nhimself be killed, on the word of a treacherous Mekinese!\"\n\nThe cloud of radar-blips grew bright and came near. The dummy fleet also\nappeared on the screens in the _Liberty's_ control room. Bors and the\nothers could see the rushing, shining flood of missiles as it poured\nthrough space upon the motionless targets.\n\n\"There!\" Bors pointed. \"The king's ship's breaking out! Away over at the\nedge. I wonder if the Mekinese will notice!\"\n\nThere were very tiny sparkles off at the side of the radar-screen. They\nincreased in number.\n\nThere was a flash, like the sun brought near for the tenth of a second.\nAnother. Yet another. Then an overwhelming spout of brilliance as tens\nand twenties and fifties of the trajectiles went off together. It was an\nunbelievable sight against the stars. Missiles flamed and flashed and\nthere seemed to be an actual sun there, now flashing brighter and now\nfainter, but intolerably hot and shining.\n\nIt went out, and left a vague and shining vapor behind. Then, belated\nmissiles entered it and detonated. Their flares ceased. Then there was\nnothing where there had seemed to be a fleet.\n\n\"Which,\" said Bors, \"is that!\"\n\nThen a voice spoke coldly from space.\n\n\"_Connect all speakers for a message in clear_,\" it commanded. \"_Alert\nall personnel for a general order._\"\n\nThere was a pause. The voice spoke again.\n\n\"_Spacemen of Mekin_,\" it said icily. \"_The fleet of Kandar is now\ndestroyed. Kandar itself will be destroyed also as an example of the\nconsequences of perfidy toward Mekin. But it should be a warning to\nothers who would conspire against our world. Therefore, in part as\npenalty and in part as a reward to the men of the Grand Fleet, you will\nbe allowed to land during a period of two weeks. You will be armed. You\nmay confiscate, for yourself, anything of value you find. You are not\nrequired to exercise restraint in your actions toward the people of\nKandar. They will be destroyed with their planet and no protests from\nsuch criminals will be listened to. You will be landed in groups, each\non a fresh area of the planet. That is all._\"\n\nThere was silence in the control room of the _Liberty_. After a long\ntime the Pretender said very quietly, \"I will not live while such beasts\nlive. From this moment I will kill them until I am killed!\"\n\n\"I suspect King Humphrey heard that,\" Bors said, and drew a deep breath.\n\"Combat alert!\" he ordered crisply. \"We're attacking the Mekinese fleet.\nHandle your missiles smoothly and don't try to fire while we're in\noverdrive! We'll be going in and out.... Choose your targets and fire as\nwe come out and while I count down. Overdrive point nine seconds. Five,\nfour, three, two, one!\"\n\nThe cosmos reeled and stomachs retched when the _Liberty_ came out in\nnine-tenths of a second. She was in the very midst of a concentration\nof the Mekinese fleet. Missiles streaked away, furiously, as Bors\ncounted down. \"Two-fifths second, five, four, three, two, one!\"\n\nMore missiles shot away. Bors almost chanted, while with gestures toward\nthe radar-screen he picked out the objects near which breakout should\nfall.\n\n\"Point oh five seconds.\" The ship went into overdrive and out. It seemed\nas if the universe dissolved from one appearance to another outside the\nviewports. \"Five, four, three, two, one! Hold fire!\"\n\nThe _Liberty_ came out a good ten thousand miles from its starting-point\nand beyond the area occupied by the enemy fleet. Three thousand miles\naway a flare burst among the distant stars. A second. A third. Six\nthousand miles away there were flashings in emptiness.\n\n\"We're doing very well,\" said Bors calmly into the all-speaker\nmicrophone. \"A little more care with the aiming, though. And read your\nranges closer! They're not intercepting our missiles. We're not aiming\nthem right. We try it again now....\"\n\nThe universe seemed to reel and one felt queasy, but there was work to\nbe done, while a voice chanted, \"Five, four, three, two, one!\" Then it\nreeled again and the same voice continued to chant. Sometimes the crews\nsaw where missiles hit, but they could never be sure they were their\nown. Then, suddenly, the number of hits increased. They doubled and\ntripled and quadrupled.\n\n\"All hands!\" barked Bors. \"The fleet of Kandar is wading into this\nfight. Be careful to pick your targets! No Kandar ships! Save your\nmissiles for the enemy!\"\n\nSomeone, man-handling missiles for faster and more long-continued firing\nthan any ship-designer ever expected, gasped, \"Come on boys! Missiles\nfor Mekin!\"\n\nIt became a joke, which seemed excruciatingly funny at the time.\n\nNobody saw all the battle, or even a considerable part. There was a\nperiod when the _Liberty_, alone, fought like the deadliest of\ngadflies. It appeared in the middle of a Mekinese sub-formation, loosed\nmissiles and vanished before anything could be intercepted. There was no\ntarget for Mekinese bombs to home on when they got to where the\n_Liberty_ had been.\n\nThen the fleet of Kandar appeared. It broke out in single ships and in\npairs, and then in groups of fives and tens. The general order for the\nMekinese fleet had been picked up, and the fleet of Kandar seemed to\nhave gone mad.\n\nThe flagship tried to fight in orthodox fashion, for a time. It depended\non the attraction its missiles had for Mekinese to keep it in space. But\npresently it was alone, and the battle was raging confusion scattered\nover light-minutes, and somebody went down in to the engine room and\nbrazed in a low-power overdrive unit--providentially made by a junior\nofficer--and the flagship of the Kandarian fleet waded in erratically,\nnever knowing where it would come out, but rarely failing to find a\nMekinese ship to launch at.\n\nThe third phase of the battle was much more of an open fight, ship\nagainst ship, except that more and more Kandarian ships were using\nlow-power overdrive--clumsily and inefficiently, but to the very great\ndetriment of Mekin's grand fleet. The Mekinese officers could not quite\ngrasp that their antagonists were doing the impossible. They became\nconfused.\n\nThe fourth phase of the battle consisted of mopping-up operations in\nwhich individual ships were hunted down and destroyed by the simple\nprocess of a Kandarian ship seeming to materialize from nowhere a mile\nor half a mile from an enemy, launching one missile and seeming to\ndematerialize again and vanish.\n\nVery few Mekinese ships went into overdrive. Probably most of them\ndidn't believe what was happening. Perhaps four ships, out of the entire\ngrand fleet, escaped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLater, of course, there was embarrassment all around. King Humphrey the\nEighth landed on Kandar to assure his people that they were no longer in\ndanger. He was embarrassed because he was a victor in spite of himself.\nThe fleet officers were embarrassed because Bors had been forced out of\nthe fleet, and had literally tricked them into battle.\n\nBors, too, was embarrassed. There was the admiration displayed by junior\nofficers of the fleet. He had become, very unwillingly, a model for\nyoung space-navy officers. They tried to pattern themselves after him in\nall ways, even to the angle at which they wore their hats. He squirmed\nwhen they looked at him with shining-eyed respect.\n\nHe was embarrassed, also, by the necessary revelation to the _Liberty's_\ncrew that he was neither the leader of a rebellion nor in command of a\nfleet; nor that he had performed quite all the fabulous feats credited\nto him. He had to explain that he'd only commanded two ships, the _Isis_\nand the _Horus_, one of which had to be destroyed, and that when the\n_Liberty_ placed itself under his command he'd just been forced to\nresign his commission from King Humphrey. The young men who'd fought\nunder him were unimpressed.\n\nThe fleet was re-supplied with food and missiles, and in one day more\nthe major part of it would take off for Mekin. Other ships would\njourney, of course, to the twenty-odd, once-subject worlds. There they\nwould--they were calmly confident about it--mop up any surviving\nMekinese ships and enforce the surrender of Mekinese garrisons. And they\nwould gather emissaries to be carried to the fleet as it rode in orbit\nabout Mekin. The fleet and the representatives of the twenty-two worlds,\ntogether, would firmly rearrange the government and the policies and the\nambitions of Mekin.\n\nThere was still the matter of Gwenlyn. The _Sylva_ came down on Kandar,\nof course, where Morgan swaggered happily, pointing out the\nindispensable help given to Kandar by Talents, Incorporated. Bors\nreminded King Humphrey that Morgan collected medals, and he was duly\ninvested with sundry glittering decorations, which would have staggered\na lesser man.\n\nGwenlyn found Bors secluded in the palace, waiting until it was time to\nboard ship and head for Mekin. Her father accompanied her.\n\n\"I've come to say goodbye,\" she said gently. \"We've done what we came\nfor.\"\n\n\"I still don't understand why you came,\" said Bors, who would much\nrather have said something else. \"We can't possibly do anything adequate\nin return. Why _did_ you come?\"\n\nHe turned to Morgan, who answered blandly, \"One of our Talents\nprecognized an event. We had to come here and help it to happen. Gwenlyn\nwas doubtful, but she's come around.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"It hasn't happened yet,\" said Morgan. He produced a cigar and lighted\nit. \"Gwenlyn, shall I tell him?\"\n\n\"Don't you dare!\" said Gwenlyn hotly.\n\nBors said unhappily, \"I'm sorry you're going away, Gwenlyn. If things\nwere--different, I--I--\"\n\n\"You what?\" asked Morgan. \"By the way! One of our Talents has\nprecognized that your uncle's going back to Tralee as its king again.\nLargely on your account. You're his heir, aren't you?\"\n\nBors blinked.\n\n\"Hero,\" said Morgan, waving his hand. \"Twenty-two planets adoring you,\nbelieving you brought Mekin down single-handed. Aching to work with you,\nfollow you, admire you. Naturally, Tralee wants your uncle back. Then\nthey'll have you. Of course,\" he added complacently, \"our Department for\nDisseminating Truthful Seditious Rumors had something to do with it. But\nthat was necessary wartime propaganda. And you didn't let anybody down.\"\nThen he said peevishly, \"Not until now!\"\n\nBors gaped. He looked at Gwenlyn. Her cheeks were crimson. Revelation\nstruck Bors like a blow.\n\n\"I don't believe it!\" he said, staring at her. He said more loudly, \"I\ndon't believe it!\"\n\n\"Damnit,\" said Morgan indignantly. \"She didn't believe it either! She\nsaid she'd come here because she was curious, nothing more. But that\nparticular Talent's never missed yet! She just plain _knows_ every time\nwho--\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Gwenlyn fiercely. \"Goodbye.\"\n\nBors moved toward her, not to shake hands. She ran out of the door. She\nran fast, for a girl. He ran faster.\n\nMorgan puffed contentedly. Presently the completely unreal figure of\nKing Humphrey the Eighth came to where Morgan had surrounded himself\nwith aromatic smoke.\n\n\"Where's Bors?\" asked the king.\n\n\"Yonder,\" said Morgan. He waved his hand. \"Kissing my daughter, I think.\nD'you know, Majesty, I've known this would happen all along? One of our\nTalents precognized you opening parliament next year. So I knew things\nhad to come out right.\"\n\n\"Y-yes,\" said the king, dubiously. \"I suppose so. But there had to be\nefforts, too, to bring it about. Otherwise it wouldn't seem right.\"\n\n\"Naturally!\" said Morgan. \"When one of my Talents precognized that\nGwenlyn was going to marry the heir of the Pretender of Tralee and be\nQueen of Tralee some day, why, it didn't seem a bit likely. But once I\nknew about that precognition, I put in a little effort....\"\n\nKing Humphrey was thoughtful.\n\n\"Things look good,\" said Morgan expansively. \"My Talents are\nprecognizing all over the place. They tell me that this planet's going\nto be a fine place to live. Quiet and peaceful, and serene.... Gwenlyn\nwill be living on Tralee, most likely, and I don't want to be underfoot.\nI'll probably settle down here. Retire, you know.\"\n\n\"Splendid,\" said the king, politely, his mind occupied with the prospect\nof a warless future.\n\n\"And as for Gwenlyn and Bors,\" Morgan added, confidentially, \"I'll tell\nyou something. My Talents've been working on her future. I wouldn't tell\nher all of it. Some of it should be a surprise. But she and Bors are\ngoing to be what you call happy ever after! And that's Talents,\nIncorporated information! You can depend on it!\"\n\n\n\n\nTWO MORE AVON S-F HITS YOU'RE SURE TO ENJOY\n\n\nLITTLE FUZZY\n\n _by H.

At worst, it would be annihilated without a\nchance. To young Captain Bors, either course was unthinkable.\n\nThe ruthless Dictator of Mekin had already subjugated twenty-two\nhelpless planets. Now he wanted Kandar's unconditional surrender, or his\nvastly superior forces would blast it out of existence.\n\nIt took a lot of guts, and the hope that is frequently born of despair,\nfor a military man like Bors to throw in his lot with TALENTS,\nINCORPORATED, an untried, unscientific organization. Through peculiar\ngifts of extra-sensory perception, its personnel could, their leader\ninsisted, out-think and out-guess even the most deadly dictator in the\nhistory of mankind. Could it?

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
