But nothing like\n    the weird twenty-one-day liquid test devised by the invading\n    Steel-Blues._\n\n\nJon Karyl was bolting in a new baffle plate on the stationary rocket\nengine. It was a tedious job and took all his concentration. So he\nwasn't paying too much attention to what was going on in other parts of\nthe little asteroid.\n\nHe didn't see the peculiar blue space ship, its rockets throttled down,\nas it drifted to land only a few hundred yards away from his plastic\nigloo.\n\nNor did he see the half-dozen steel-blue creatures slide out of the\npeculiar vessel's airlock.\n\nIt was only as he crawled out of the depths of the rocket power plant\nthat he realized something was wrong.\n\nBy then it was almost too late. The six blue figures were only fifty\nfeet away, approaching him at a lope.\n\nJon Karyl took one look and went bounding over the asteroid's rocky\nslopes in fifty-foot bounds.\n\nWhen you're a Lone Watcher, and strangers catch you unawares, you don't\nstand still. You move fast. It's the Watcher's first rule. Stay alive.\nAn Earthship may depend upon your life.\n\nAs he fled, Jon Karyl cursed softly under his breath. The automatic\nalarm should have shrilled out a warning.\n\nThen he saved as much of his breath as he could as some sort of power\nwave tore up the rocky sward to his left. He twisted and zig-zagged in\nhis flight, trying to get out of sight of the strangers.\n\nOnce hidden from their eyes, he could cut back and head for the\nunderground entrance to the service station.\n\nHe glanced back finally.\n\nTwo of the steel-blue creatures were jack-rabbiting after him, and\nrapidly closing the distance.\n\nJon Karyl unsheathed the stubray pistol at his side, turned the oxygen\ndial up for greater exertion, increased the gravity pull in his\nspace-suit boots as he neared the ravine he'd been racing for.\n\nThe oxygen was just taking hold when he hit the lip of the ravine and\nbegan sprinting through its man-high bush-strewn course.\n\nThe power ray from behind ripped out great gobs of the sheltering\nbushes. But running naturally, bent close to the bottom of the ravine,\nJon Karyl dodged the bare spots. The oxygen made the tremendous exertion\neasy for his lungs as he sped down the dim trail, hidden from the two\nsteel-blue stalkers.\n\nHe'd eluded them, temporarily at least, Jon Karyl decided when he\nfinally edged off the dim trail and watched for movement along the route\nbehind him.\n\nHe stood up, finally, pushed aside the leafy overhang of a bush and\nlooked for landmarks along the edge of the ravine.\n\nHe found one, a stubby bush, shaped like a Maltese cross, clinging to\nthe lip of the ravine. The hidden entrance to the service station wasn't\nfar off.\n\nHis pistol held ready, he moved quietly on down the ravine until the old\nwater course made an abrupt hairpin turn.\n\nInstead of following around the sharp bend, Jon Karyl moved straight\nahead through the overhanging bushes until he came to a dense thicket.\nDropping to his hands and knees he worked his way under the edge of the\nthicket into a hollowed-out space in the center.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere, just ahead of him, was the lock leading into the service station.\nSlipping a key out of a leg pouch on the space suit, he jabbed it into\nthe center of the lock, opening the lever housing.\n\nHe pulled strongly on the lever. With a hiss of escaping air, the lock\nswung open. Jon Karyl darted inside, the door closing softly behind.\n\nAt the end of the long tunnel he stepped to the televisor which was\nfixed on the area surrounding the station.\n\nJon Karyl saw none of the steel-blue creatures. But he saw their ship.\nIt squatted like a smashed-down kid's top, its lock shut tight.\n\nHe tuned the televisor to its widest range and finally spotted one of\nthe Steel-Blues. He was looking into the stationary rocket engine.\n\nAs Karyl watched, a second Steel-Blue came crawling out of the ship.\n\nThe two Steel-Blues moved toward the center of the televisor range.\nThey're coming toward the station, Karyl thought grimly.\n\nKaryl examined the two creatures. They were of the steel-blue color from\nthe crown of their egg-shaped heads to the tips of their walking\nappendages.\n\nThey were about the height of Karyl--six feet. But where he tapered from\nbroad shoulders to flat hips, they were straight up and down. They had\nno legs, just appendages, many-jointed that stretched and shrank\nindependent of the other, but keeping the cylindrical body with its four\npairs of tentacles on a level balance.\n\nWhere their eyes would have been was an elliptical-shaped lens, covering\nhalf the egg-head, with its converging ends curving around the sides of\nthe head.\n\nRobots! Jon gauged immediately. But where were their masters?\n\nThe Steel-Blues moved out of the range of the televisor. A minute later\nJon heard a pounding from the station upstairs.\n\nHe chuckled. They were like the wolf of pre-atomic days who huffed and\npuffed to blow the house down.\n\nThe outer shell of the station was formed from stelrylite, the toughest\nmetal in the solar system. With the self-sealing lock of the same\nresistant material, a mere pounding was nothing.\n\nJon thought he'd have a look-see anyway. He went up the steel ladder\nleading to the station's power plant and the televisor that could look\ninto every room within the station.\n\nHe heaved a slight sigh when he reached the power room, for right at his\nhand were weapons to blast the ship from the asteroid.\n\nJon adjusted one televisor to take in the lock to the station. His\nteeth suddenly clamped down on his lower lip.\n\nThose Steel-Blues were pounding holes into the stelrylite with\nround-headed metal clubs. But it was impossible. Stelrylite didn't break\nup that easily.\n\nJon leaped to a row of studs, lining up the revolving turret which\ncapped the station so that its thin fin pointed at the squat ship of the\ninvaders.\n\nThen he went to the atomic cannon's firing buttons.\n\nHe pressed first the yellow, then the blue button. Finally the red one.\n\nThe thin fin--the cannon's sight--split in half as the turret opened and\nthe coiled nose of the cannon protruded. There was a soundless flash.\nThen a sharp crack.\n\nJon was dumbfounded when he saw the bolt ricochet off the ship. This was\nno ship of the solar system. There was nothing that could withstand even\nthe slight jolt of power given by the station cannon on any of the Sun's\nworlds. But what was this? A piece of the ship had changed. A bubble of\nmetal, like a huge drop of blue wax, dripped off the vessel and struck\nthe rocket of the asteroid. It steamed and ran in rivulets.\n\nHe pressed the red button again.\n\nThen abruptly he was on the floor of the power room, his legs strangely\ncut out from under him. He tried to move them. They lay flaccid. His\narms seemed all right and tried to lever himself to an upright position.\n\nDamn it, he seemed as if he were paralyzed from the waist down. But it\ncouldn't happen that suddenly.\n\nHe turned his head.\n\nA Steel-Blue stood facing him. A forked tentacle held a square black\nbox.\n\nJon could read nothing in that metallic face. He said, voice muffled by\nthe confines of the plastic helmet, \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I am\"--there was a rising inflection in the answer--\"a Steel-Blue.\"\n\nThere were no lips on the Steel-Blue's face to move. \"That is what I\nhave named you,\" Jon Karyl said. \"But what are you?\"\n\n\"A robot,\" came the immediate answer. Jon was quite sure then that the\nSteel-Blue was telepathic. \"Yes,\" the Steel-Blue answered. \"We talk in\nthe language of the mind. Come!\" he said peremptorily, motioning with\nthe square black box.\n\nThe paralysis left Karyl's legs. He followed the Steel-Blue, aware that\nthe lens he'd seen on the creature's face had a counterpart on the back\nof the egg-head.\n\nEyes in the back of his head, Jon thought. That's quite an innovation.\n\"Thank you,\" Steel-Blue said.\n\nThere wasn't much fear in Jon Karyl's mind. Psychiatrists had proved\nthat when he had applied for this high-paying but man-killing job as a\nLone Watcher on the Solar System's starways.\n\nHe had little fear now, only curiosity. These Steel-Blues didn't seem\ninimical. They could have snuffed out my life very simply. Perhaps they\nand Solarians can be friends.\n\nSteel-Blue chuckled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJon followed him through the sundered lock of the station. Karyl stopped\nfor a moment to examine the wreckage of the lock. It had been punched\nfull of holes as if it had been some soft cheese instead of a metal\nwhich Earthmen had spent nearly a century perfecting.\n\n\"We appreciate your compliment,\" Steel-Blue said. \"But that metal also\nis found on our world. It's probably the softest and most malleable we\nhave. We were surprised you--earthmen, is it?--use it as protective\nmetal.\"\n\n\"Why are you in this system?\" Jon asked, hardly expecting an answer.\n\nIt came anyway. \"For the same reason you Earthmen are reaching out\nfarther into your system. We need living room. You have strategically\nplaced planets for our use. We will use them.\"\n\nJon sighed. For 400 years scientists had been preaching preparedness as\nEarth flung her ships into the reaches of the solar system, taking the\nfirst long step toward the conquest of space.\n\nThere are other races somewhere, they argued. As strong and smart as\nman, many of them so transcending man in mental and inventive power that\nwe must be prepared to strike the minute danger shows.\n\nNow here was the answer to the scientists' warning. Invasion by\nextra-terrestrials.\n\n\"What did you say?\" asked Steel-Blue. \"I couldn't understand.\"\n\n\"Just thinking to myself,\" Jon answered. It was a welcome surprise.\nApparently his thoughts had to be directed outward, rather than inward,\nin order for the Steel-Blues to read it.\n\nHe followed the Steel-Blue into the gaping lock of the invaders' space\nship wondering how he could warn Earth. The Space Patrol cruiser was due\nin for refueling at his service station in 21 days. But by that time he\nprobably would be mouldering in the rocky dust of the asteroid.\n\nIt was pitch dark within the ship but the Steel-Blue seemed to have no\ntrouble at all maneuvering through the maze of corridors. Jon followed\nhim, attached to one tentacle.\n\nFinally Jon and his guide entered a circular room, bright with light\nstreaming from a glass-like, bulging skylight. They apparently were near\ntopside of the vessel.\n\nA Steel-Blue, more massive than his guide and with four more pair of\ntentacles, including two short ones that grew from the top of its head,\nspoke out.\n\n\"This is the violator?\" Jon's Steel-Blue nodded.\n\n\"You know the penalty? Carry it out.\"\n\n\"He also is an inhabitant of this system,\" Jon's guide added.\n\n\"Examine him first, then give him the death.\"\n\nJon Karyl shrugged as he was led from the lighted room through more\ncorridors. If it got too bad he still had the stubray pistol.\n\nAnyway, he was curious. He'd taken on the lonely, nerve-wracking job of\nservice station attendant just to see what it offered.\n\nHere was a part of it, and it was certainly something new.\n\n\"This is the examination room,\" his Steel-Blue said, almost\ncontemptuously.\n\nA green effulgence surrounded him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a hiss. Simultaneously, as the tiny microphone on the outside\nof his suit picked up the hiss, he felt a chill go through his body.\nThen it seemed as if a half dozen hands were inside him, examining his\ninternal organs. His stomach contracted. He felt a squeeze on his heart.\nHis lungs tickled.\n\nThere were several more queer motions inside his body.\n\nThen another Steel-Blue voice said:\n\n\"He is a soft-metal creature, made up of metals that melt at a very low\ntemperature. He also contains a liquid whose makeup I cannot ascertain\nby ray-probe. Bring him back when the torture is done.\"\n\nJon Karyl grinned a trifle wryly. What kind of torture could this be?\n\nWould it last 21 days? He glanced at the chronometer on his wrist.\n\nJon's Steel-Blue led him out of the alien ship and halted expectantly\njust outside the ship's lock.\n\nJon Karyl waited, too. He thought of the stubray pistol holstered at his\nhip. Shoot my way out? It'd be fun while it lasted. But he toted up the\ndisadvantages.\n\nHe either would have to find a hiding place on the asteroid, and if the\nSteel-Blues wanted him bad enough they could tear the whole place to\npieces, or somehow get aboard the little life ship hidden in the service\nstation.\n\nIn that he would be just a sitting duck.\n\nHe shrugged off the slight temptation to use the pistol. He was still\ncurious.\n\nAnd he was interested in staying alive as long as possible. There was a\nremote chance he might warn the SP ship. Unconsciously, he glanced\ntoward his belt to see the little power pack which, if under ideal\nconditions, could finger out fifty thousand miles into space.\n\nIf he could somehow stay alive the 21 days he might be able to warn the\npatrol. He couldn't do it by attempting to flee, for his life would be\nsnuffed out immediately.\n\nThe Steel-Blue said quietly:\n\n\"It might be ironical to let you warn that SP ship you keep thinking\nabout. But we know your weapon now. Already our ship is equipped with a\nforce field designed especially to deflect your atomic guns.\"\n\nJon Karyl covered up his thoughts quickly. They can delve deeper than\nthe surface of the mind. Or wasn't I keeping a leash on my thoughts?\n\nThe Steel-Blue chuckled. \"You get--absent-minded, is it?--every once in\na while.\"\n\nJust then four other Steel-Blues appeared lugging great sheets of\nplastic and various other equipment.\n\nThey dumped their loads and began unbundling them.\n\nWorking swiftly, they built a plastic igloo, smaller than the living\nroom in the larger service station igloo. They ranged instruments\ninside--one of them Jon Karyl recognized as an air pump from within the\nstation--and they laid out a pallet.\n\nWhen they were done Jon saw a miniature reproduction of the service\nstation, lacking only the cannon cap and fin, and with clear plastic\nwalls instead of the opaqueness of the other.\n\nHis Steel-Blue said: \"We have reproduced the atmosphere of your station\nso that you be watched while you undergo the torture under the normal\nconditions of your life.\"\n\n\"What is this torture?\" Jon Karyl asked.\n\nThe answer was almost caressing: \"It is a liquid we use to dissolve\nmetals. It causes joints to harden if even so much as a drop remains on\nit long. It eats away the metal, leaving a scaly residue which crumbles\neventually into dust.\n\n\"We will dilute it with a harmless liquid for you since No. 1 does not\nwish you to die instantly.\n\n\"Enter your\"--the Steel-Blue hesitated--\"mausoleum. You die in your own\natmosphere. However, we took the liberty of purifying it. There were\ndangerous elements in it.\"\n\nJon walked into the little igloo. The Steel-Blues sealed the lock,\nfingered dials and switches on the outside. Jon's space suit deflated.\nPressure was building up in the igloo.\n\nHe took a sample of the air, found that it was good, although quite rich\nin oxygen compared with what he'd been using in the service station and\nin his suit.\n\nWith a sigh of relief he took off his helmet and gulped huge draughts of\nthe air.\n\nHe sat down on the pallet and waited for the torture to begin.\n\nThe Steel Blues crowded about the igloo, staring at him through\nelliptical eyes.\n\nApparently, they too, were waiting for the torture to begin.\n\nJon thought the excess of oxygen was making him light-headed.\n\nHe stared at a cylinder which was beginning to sprout tentacles from the\ncircle. He rubbed his eyes and looked again. An opening, like the\nadjustable eye-piece of a spacescope, was appearing in the center of the\ncylinder.\n\nA square, glass-like tumbler sat in the opening disclosed in the\nfour-foot cylinder that had sprouted tentacles. It contained a yellowish\nliquid.\n\nOne of the tentacles reached into the opening and clasped the glass. The\nopening closed and the cylinder, propelled by locomotor appendages,\nmoved toward Jon.\n\nHe didn't like the looks of the liquid in the tumbler. It looked like an\nacid of some sort. He raised to his feet.\n\nHe unsheathed the stubray gun and prepared to blast the cylinder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe cylinder moved so fast Jon felt his eyes jump in his head. He\nbrought the stubray gun up--but he was helpless. The pistol kept on\ngoing up. With a deft movement, one of the tentacles had speared it from\nhis hand and was holding it out of his reach.\n\nJon kicked at the glass in the cylinder's hand. But he was too slow. Two\ntentacles gripped the kicking leg. Another struck him in the chest,\nknocking him to the pallet. The same tentacle, assisted by a new one,\npinioned his shoulders.\n\nFour tentacles held him supine. The cylinder lifted a glass-like cap\nfrom the tumbler of liquid.\n\nLying there helplessly, Jon was remembering an old fairy tale he'd read\nas a kid. Something about a fellow named Socrates who was given a cup of\nhemlock to drink. It was the finis for Socrates. But the old hero had\nbeen nonchalant and calm about the whole thing.\n\nWith a sigh, Jon Karyl, who was curious unto death, relaxed and said,\n\"All right, bub, you don't have to force-feed me. I'll take it like a\nman.\"\n\nThe cylinder apparently understood him, for it handed him the tumbler.\nIt even reholstered his stubray pistol.\n\nJon brought the glass of liquid under his nose. The fumes of the liquid\nwere pungent. It brought tears to his eyes.\n\nHe looked at the cylinder, then at the Steel-Blues crowding around the\nplastic igloo. He waved the glass at the audience.\n\n\"To Earth, ever triumphant,\" he toasted. Then he drained the glass at a\ngulp.\n\nIts taste was bitter, and he felt hot prickles jab at his scalp. It was\nlike eating very hot peppers. His eyes filled with tears. He coughed as\nthe stuff went down.\n\nBut he was still alive, he thought in amazement. He'd drunk the hemlock\nand was still alive.\n\nThe reaction set in quickly. He hadn't known until then how tense he'd\nbeen. Now with the torture ordeal over, he relaxed. He laid down on the\npallet and went to sleep.\n\nThere was one lone Steel-Blue watching him when he rubbed the sleep out\nof his eyes and sat up.\n\nHe vanished almost instantly. He, or another like him, returned\nimmediately accompanied by a half-dozen others, including the\nmulti-tentacled creature known as No. 1.\n\nOne said,\n\n\"You are alive.\" The thought registered amazement. \"When you lost\nconsciousness, we thought you had\"--there was a hesitation--\"as you say,\ndied.\"\n\n\"No,\" Jon Karyl said. \"I didn't die. I was just plain dead-beat so I\nwent to sleep.\" The Steel-Blues apparently didn't understand.\n\n\"Good it is that you live. The torture will continue,\" spoke No. 1\nbefore loping away.\n\nThe cylinder business began again. This time, Jon drank the bitter\nliquid slowly, trying to figure out what it was. It had a familiar,\ntantalizing taste but he couldn't quite put a taste-finger on it.\n\nHis belly said he was hungry. He glanced at his chronometer. Only 20\ndays left before the SP ship arrived.\n\nWould this torture--he chuckled--last until then? But he was growing\nmore and more conscious that his belly was screaming for hunger. The\nliquid had taken the edge off his thirst.\n\nIt was on the fifth day of his torture that Jon Karyl decided that he\nwas going to get something to eat or perish in the attempt.\n\nThe cylinder sat passively in its niche in the circle. A dozen\nSteel-Blues were watching as Jon put on his helmet and unsheathed his\nstubray.\n\nThey merely watched as he pressed the stubray's firing stud. Invisible\nrays licked out of the bulbous muzzle of the pistol. The plastic\nsplintered.\n\nJon was out of his goldfish bowl and striding toward his own igloo\nadjacent to the service station when a Steel-Blue accosted him.\n\n\"Out of my way,\" grunted Jon, waving the stubray. \"I'm hungry.\"\n\n\"I'm the first Steel-Blue you met,\" said the creature who barred his\nway. \"Go back to your torture.\"\n\n\"But I'm so hungry I'll chew off one of your tentacles and eat it\nwithout seasoning.\"\n\n\"Eat?\" The Steel-Blue sounded puzzled.\n\n\"I want to refuel. I've got to have food to keep my engine going.\"\n\nSteel-Blue chuckled. \"So the hemlock, as you call it, is beginning to\naffect you at last? Back to the torture room.\"\n\n\"Like R-dust,\" Jon growled. He pressed the firing stud on the stubray\ngun. One of Steel-Blue's tentacles broke off and fell to the rocky\nsward.\n\nSteel-Blue jerked out the box he'd used once before. A tentacle danced\nover it.\n\nAbruptly Jon found himself standing on a pinnacle of rock. Steel-Blue\nhad cut a swath around him 15 feet deep and five feet wide.\n\n\"Back to the room,\" Steel-Blue commanded.\n\nJon resheathed the stubray pistol, shrugged non-committally and leaped\nthe trench. He walked slowly back and reentered the torture chamber.\n\nThe Steel-Blues rapidly repaired the damage he'd done.\n\nAs he watched them, Jon was still curious, but he was getting mad\nunderneath at the cold egoism of the Steel-Blues.\n\nBy the shimmering clouds of Earth, by her green fields, and dark\nforests, he'd stay alive to warn the SP ship.\n\nYes, he'd stay alive till then. And send the story of the Steel-Blues'\ncorrosive acid to it. Then hundreds of Earth's ships could equip\nthemselves with spray guns and squirt citric acid and watch the\nSteel-Blues fade away.\n\nIt sounded almost silly to Jon Karyl. The fruit acid of Earth to repel\nthese invaders--it doesn't sound possible. That couldn't be the answer.\n\nCitric acid wasn't the answer, Jon Karyl discovered a week later.\n\nThe Steel-Blue who had captured him in the power room of the service\nstation came in to examine him.\n\n\"You're still holding out, I see,\" he observed after poking Jon in every\nsensitive part of his body.\n\n\"I'll suggest to No. 1 that we increase the power of the--ah--hemlock.\nHow do you feel?\"\n\nBetween the rich oxygen and the dizziness of hunger, Jon was a bit\ndelirious. But he answered honestly enough: \"My guts feel as if they're\nchewing each other up. My bones ache. My joints creak. I can't\ncoordinate I'm so hungry.\"\n\n\"That is the hemlock,\" Steel-Blue said.\n\nIt was when he quaffed the new and stronger draught that Jon knew that\nhis hope that it was citric acid was squelched.\n\nThe acid taste was weaker which meant that the citric acid was the\ndiluting liquid. It was the liquid he couldn't taste beneath the tang of\nthe citric acid that was the corrosive acid.\n\nOn the fourteenth day, Jon was so weak he didn't feel much like moving\naround. He let the cylinder feed him the hemlock.\n\nNo. 1 came again to see him, and went away chuckling, \"Decrease the\ndilution. This Earthman at last is beginning to suffer.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStaying alive had now become a fetish with Jon.\n\nOn the sixteenth day, the Earthman realized that the Steel-Blues also\nwere waiting for the SP ship.\n\nThe extra-terrestrials had repaired the blue ship where the service\nstation atomic ray had struck. And they were doing a little target\npractice with plastic bubbles only a few miles above the asteroid.\n\nWhen his chronometer clocked off the beginning of the twenty-first day,\nJon received a tumbler of the hemlock from the hands of No. 1 himself.\n\n\"It is the hemlock,\" he chuckled, \"undiluted. Drink it and your torture\nis over. You will die before your SP ship is destroyed.\n\n\"We have played with you long enough. Today we begin to toy with your SP\nship. Drink up, Earthman, drink to enslavement.\"\n\nWeak though he was Jon lunged to his feet, spilling the tumbler of\nliquid. It ran cool along the plastic arm of his space suit. He changed\nhis mind about throwing the contents on No. 1.\n\nWith a smile he set the glass at his lips and drank. Then he laughed at\nNo. 1.\n\n\"The SP ship will turn your ship into jelly.\"\n\nNo. 1 swept out, chuckling. \"Boast if you will, Earthman, it's your last\nchance.\"\n\nThere was an exultation in Jon's heart that deadened the hunger and\nwashed away the nausea.\n\nAt last he knew what the hemlock was.\n\nHe sat on the pallet adjusting the little power-pack radio. The SP ship\nshould now be within range of the set. The space patrol was notorious\nfor its accuracy in keeping to schedule. Seconds counted like years.\nThey had to be on the nose, or it meant disaster or death.\n\nHe sent out the call letters.\n\n\"AX to SP-101 ... AX to SP-101 ... AX to SP-101 ...\"\n\nThree times he sent the call, then began sending his message, hoping\nthat his signal was reaching the ship. He couldn't know if they\nanswered. Though the power pack could get out a message over a vast\ndistance, it could not pick up messages even when backed by an SP ship's\npower unless the ship was only a few hundred miles away.\n\nThe power pack was strictly a distress signal.\n\nHe didn't know how long he'd been sending, nor how many times his weary\nvoice had repeated the short but desperate message.\n\nHe kept watching the heavens and hoping.\n\nAbruptly he knew the SP ship was coming, for the blue ship of the\nSteel-Blues was rising silently from the asteroid.\n\nUp and up it rose, then flames flickered in a circle about its curious\nshape. The ship disappeared, suddenly accelerating.\n\nJon Karyl strained his eyes.\n\nFinally he looked away from the heavens to the two Steel-Blues who stood\nnegligently outside the goldfish bowl.\n\nOnce more, Jon used the stubray pistol. He marched out of the plastic\nigloo and ran toward the service station.\n\nHe didn't know how weak he was until he stumbled and fell only a few\nfeet from his prison.\n\nThe Steel-Blues just watched him.\n\nHe crawled on, around the circular pit in the sward of the asteroid\nwhere one Steel-Blue had shown him the power of his weapon.\n\nHe'd been crawling through a nightmare for years when the quiet voice\npenetrated his dulled mind.\n\n\"Take it easy, Karyl. You're among friends.\"\n\nHe pried open his eyes with his will. He saw the blue and gold of a\nspace guard's uniform. He sighed and drifted into unconsciousness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was still weak days later when Capt. Ron Small of SP-101 said,\n\n\"Yes, Karyl, it's ironical. They fed you what they thought was sure\ndeath, and it's the only thing that kept you going long enough to warn\nus.\"\n\n\"I was dumb for a long time,\" Karyl said. \"I thought that it was the\nacid, almost to the very last. But when I drank that last glass, I knew\nthey didn't have a chance.\n\n\"They were metal monsters. No wonder they feared that liquid. It would\nrust their joints, short their wiring, and kill them. No wonder they\nstared when I kept alive after drinking enough to completely annihilate\na half-dozen of them.\n\n\"But what happened when you met the ship?\"\n\nThe space captain grinned.\n\n\"Not much. Our crew was busy creating a hollow shell filled with _water_\nto be shot out of a rocket tube converted into a projectile thrower.\n\n\"These Steel-Blues, as you call them, put traction beams on us and\nstarted tugging us toward the asteroid. We tried a couple of atomic\nshots but when they just glanced off, we gave up.\n\n\"They weren't expecting the shell of water. When it hit that blue ship,\nyou could almost see it oxidize before your eyes.\n\n\"I guess they knew what was wrong right away. They let go the traction\nbeams and tried to get away. They forgot about the force field, so we\njust poured atomic fire into the weakening ship. It just melted away.\"\n\nJon Karyl got up from the divan where he'd been lying. \"They thought I\nwas a metal creature, too. But where do you suppose they came from?\"\n\nThe captain shrugged. \"Who knows?\"\n\nJon set two glasses on the table.\n\n\"Have a drink of the best damn water in the solar system?\" He asked\nCapt.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
