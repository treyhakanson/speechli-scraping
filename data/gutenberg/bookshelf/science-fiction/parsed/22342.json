Burris, Director\nof the FBI. He threw his hands in the air and looked baffled and\nconfused.\n\nKenneth J. Malone tried to appear sympathetic. \"What what is?\" he\nasked.\n\nBurris frowned and drummed his fingers on his big desk. \"Malone,\" he\nsaid, \"make sense. And don't stutter.\"\n\n\"Stutter?\" Malone said. \"You said you didn't know what it was. What\nthe hell it was. And I wanted to know what it was.\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" Burris said. \"I don't know.\"\n\nMalone sighed and repressed an impulse to scream. \"Now wait a minute,\nChief--\" he started.\n\nBurris frowned again. \"Don't call me Chief,\" he said.\n\nMalone nodded. \"Okay,\" he said. \"But if you don't know what it is, you\nmust have some idea of what you don't know. I mean, is it larger than\na breadbox? Does it perform helpful tasks? Is it self-employed?\"\n\n\"Malone,\" Burris sighed, \"you ought to be on television.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Let me explain,\" Burris said. His voice was calmer now, and he spoke\nas if he were enunciating nothing but the most obvious and eternal\ntruths. \"The country,\" he said, \"is going to hell in a handbasket.\"\n\nMalone nodded again. \"Well, after all, Chief--\"\n\n\"Don't call me Chief,\" Burris said wearily.\n\n\"Anything you say,\" Malone agreed peacefully. He eyed the Director of\nthe FBI warily. \"After all, it isn't anything new,\" he went on. \"The\ncountry's always been going to hell in a handbasket, one way or\nanother. Look at Rome.\"\n\n\"Rome?\" Burris said.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Rome was always going to hell in a handbasket,\nand finally it--\" He paused. \"Finally it did, I guess,\" he said.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Burris said. \"And so are we. Finally.\" He passed a hand\nover his forehead and stared past Malone at a spot on the wall. Malone\nturned and looked at the spot, but saw nothing of interest. \"Malone,\"\nBurris said, and the FBI agent whirled around again.\n\n\"Yes, Ch--Yes?\" he said.\n\n\"This time,\" Burris said, \"it isn't the same old story at all. This\ntime it's different.\"\n\n\"Different?\" Malone said.\n\nBurris nodded. \"Look at it this way,\" he said. His eyes returned to\nthe agent. \"Suppose you're a congressman,\" he went on, \"and you find\nevidence of inefficiency in the government.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said agreeably. He had the feeling that if he\nwaited around a little while everything would make sense, and he was\nwilling to wait. After all, he wasn't on assignment at the moment, and\nthere was nothing pressing waiting for him. He was even between\nromances.\n\nIf he waited long enough, he told himself, Andrew J. Burris might say\nsomething worth hearing. He looked attentive and eager. He considered\nleaning over the desk a little, to look even more eager, but decided\nagainst it; Burris might think he looked threatening. There was no\ntelling.\n\n\"You're a congressman,\" Burris said, \"and the government is\ninefficient. You find evidence of it. What do you do?\"\n\nMalone blinked and thought for a second. It didn't take any longer\nthan that to come up with the old, old answer. \"I start an\ninvestigation,\" he said. \"I get a committee and I talk to a lot of\nnewspaper editors and magazine editors and maybe I go on television\nand talk some more, and my committee has a lot of meetings--\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Burris said.\n\n\"And we talk a lot at the meetings,\" Malone went on, carried away,\n\"and get a lot of publicity, and we subpoena famous people, just as\nfamous as we can get, except governors or presidents, because you\ncan't--they tried that back in the Fifties, and it didn't work very\nwell--and that gives us some more publicity, and then when we have all\nthe publicity we can possibly get--\"\n\n\"You stop,\" Burris said hurriedly.\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said. \"We stop. And that's what I'd do.\"\n\n\"Of course, the problem of inefficiency is left exactly where it\nalways was,\" Burris said. \"Nothing's been done about it.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" Malone said. \"But think of all the lovely publicity. And\nall the nice talk. And the subpoenas and committees and everything.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Burris said wearily. \"It's happened a thousand times. But,\nMalone, that's the difference. It isn't happening this time.\"\n\nThere was a short pause. \"What do you mean?\" Malone said at last.\n\n\"This time,\" Burris said, in a tone that sounded almost awed, \"they\nwant to keep it a secret.\"\n\n\"A secret?\" Malone said, blinking. \"But that's--that's not the\nAmerican way.\"\n\nBurris shrugged. \"It's un-congressman-like, anyhow,\" he said. \"But\nthat's what they've done. Tiptoed over to me and whispered softly that\nthe thing has to be investigated quietly. Naturally, they didn't give\nme any orders--but only because they know they can't make one stick.\nThey suggested it pretty strongly.\"\n\n\"Any reasons?\" Malone said. The whole idea interested him strangely.\nIt was odd--and he found himself almost liking odd cases, lately. That\nis, he amended hurriedly, if they didn't get _too_ odd.\n\n\"Oh, they had reasons, all right,\" Burris said. \"It took a little\ncoaxing, but I managed to pry some loose. You see, every one of them\nfound inefficiency in his own department. And every one knows that\nother men are investigating inefficiency.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said.\n\n\"That's right,\" Burris said. \"Every one of them came to me to get me\nto prove that the goof-ups in his particular department weren't his\nfault. That covers them in case one of the others happens to light\ninto the department.\"\n\n\"Well, it must be _somebody's_ fault,\" Malone said.\n\n\"It isn't theirs,\" Burris said wearily, \"I ought to know. They told\nme. At great length, Malone.\"\n\nMalone felt a stab of honest pity. \"How many so far?\" he asked.\n\n\"Six,\" Burris said. \"Four representatives, and two senators.\"\n\n\"Only two?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Well,\" Burris said, \"the Senate is so much smaller. And, besides, we\nmay get more. As a matter of fact, Senator Lefferts is worth any six\nrepresentatives all by himself.\"\n\n\"He is?\" Malone said, puzzled. Senator Lefferts was not one of his\nfavorite people. Nor, as far as he knew, did the somewhat excitable\nsenator hold any place of honor in the heart of Andrew J. Burris.\n\n\"I mean his story,\" Burris said. \"I've never heard anything like it--\nat least, not since the Bilbo days. And I've only heard about those,\"\nhe added hurriedly.\n\n\"What story?\" Malone said. \"He talked about inefficiency--\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Burris said carefully. \"He said that somebody was out\nto get him--him, personally. He said somebody was trying to discredit\nhim by sabotaging all his legislative plans.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, feeling that some comment was called for, \"three\ncheers.\"\n\n\"That isn't the point,\" Burris snapped. \"No matter how we feel about\nSenator Lefferts or his legislative plans, we're sworn to protect him.\nAnd he says 'they' are out to get him.\"\n\n\"They?\" Malone said.\n\n\"You know,\" Burris said, shrugging. \"The great 'they.' The invisible\nenemies all around, working against him.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Paranoid?\" He had always thought Senator Lefferts\nwas slightly on the batty side, and the idea of real paranoia didn't\ncome as too much of a surprise. After all, when a man was batty to\nstart out with ... and he even _looked_ like a vampire, Malone thought\nconfusedly.\n\n\"As far as paranoia is concerned,\" Burris said, \"I checked with one of\nour own psych men, and he'll back it up. Lefferts has definite\nparanoid tendencies, he says.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" Malone said, \"that's that.\"\n\nBurris shook his head. \"It isn't that simple,\" he said. \"You see,\nMalone, there's some evidence that somebody _is_ working against him.\"\n\n\"The American public, with any luck at all,\" Malone said.\n\n\"No,\" Burris said. \"An enemy. Somebody sabotaging his plans. Really.\"\n\nMalone shook his head. \"You're crazy,\" he said.\n\nBurris looked shocked. \"Malone, I'm the Director of the FBI,\" he said.\n\"And if you insist on being disrespectful--\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Malone murmured. \"But--\"\n\n\"I am perfectly sane,\" Burris said slowly. \"It's Senator Lefferts\nwho's crazy. The only trouble is, he has evidence to show he's not.\"\n\nMalone thought about odd cases, and suddenly wished he were somewhere\nelse. Anywhere else. This one showed sudden signs of developing into\nsomething positively bizarre. \"I see,\" he said, wondering if he did.\n\n\"After all,\" Burris said, in a voice that attempted to sound\nreasonable, \"a paranoid has just as much right to be persecuted as\nanybody else, doesn't he?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Everybody has rights. But what do you want me to\ndo about that?\"\n\n\"About their rights?\" Burris said. \"Nothing, Malone. Nothing.\"\n\n\"I mean,\" Malone said patiently, \"about whatever it is that's going\non.\"\n\nBurris took a deep breath. His hands clasped behind his head, and he\nlooked up at the ceiling. He seemed perfectly relaxed. That, Malone\nknew, was a bad sign. It meant that there was a dirty job coming, a\njob nobody wanted to do, and one Burris was determined to pass off on\nhim. He sighed and tried to get resigned.\n\n\"Well,\" the FBI director said, \"the only actual trouble we can\npinpoint is that there seem to be a great many errors occurring in the\npaperwork. More than usual.\"\n\n\"People get tired,\" Malone said tentatively.\n\n\"But computer-secretary calculating machines don't,\" Burris said. \"And\nthat's where the errors are, in the computer-secretaries down in the\nSenate Office Building. I think you'd better start out there.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said sadly.\n\n\"See if there's any mechanical or electrical defect in any of those\ncomputers,\" Burris said. \"Talk to the computer technicians. Find out\nwhat's causing all these errors.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said. He was still trying to feel resigned, but he\nwasn't succeeding very well.\n\n\"And if you don't find anything--\" Burris began.\n\n\"I'll come right back,\" Malone said instantly.\n\n\"No,\" Burris said. \"You keep on looking.\"\n\n\"I do?\"\n\n\"You do,\" Burris said. \"After all, there has to be _something_ wrong.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said, \"if you say so. But--\"\n\n\"There are the interview tapes,\" Burris said, \"and the reports the\nCongressmen brought in. You can go through those.\"\n\nMalone sighed. \"I guess so,\" he said.\n\n\"And there must be thousands of other things to do,\" Burris said.\n\n\"Well--\" Malone began cautiously.\n\n\"You'll be able to think of them,\" Burris said heartily. \"I know you\nwill. I have confidence in you, Malone. Confidence.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone said sadly.\n\n\"You just keep me posted from time to time on what you're doing, and\nwhat ideas you get,\" Burris said. \"I'm leaving the whole thing in your\nhands, Malone, and I'm sure you won't disappoint me.\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I know you will,\" Burris said warmly. \"And no matter how long it\ntakes, I know you'll succeed.\"\n\n\"No matter how long it takes?\" Malone said hesitantly.\n\n\"That's right!\" Burris said. \"You can do it, Malone! You can do it.\"\n\nMalone nodded slowly. \"I hope so,\" he said. \"Well, I--Well, I'll start\nout right away, then.\"\n\nHe turned. Before he could make another move Burris said, \"Wait!\"\n\nMalone turned again, hope in his eyes. \"Yes, sir?\" he said.\n\n\"When you leave--\" Burris began, and the hope disappeared. \"When you\nleave,\" he went on, \"please do one little favor for me. Just one\nlittle favor, because I'm an old, tired man and I'm not used to things\nany more.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Anything, Chief.\"\n\n\"Don't call me--\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Malone said.\n\nBurris breathed heavily. \"When you leave,\" he said, \"please, please\nuse the door.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Malone,\" Burris said, \"I've tried. I've really tried. Believe me.\nI've tried to get used to the fact that you can teleport. But--\"\n\n\"It's useful,\" Malone said, \"in my work.\"\n\n\"I can see that,\" Burris said. \"And I don't want you to, well, to stop\ndoing it. By no means. It's just that it sort of unnerves me, if you\nsee what I mean. No matter how useful it is for the FBI to have an\nagent who can go instantaneously from one place to another, it\nunnerves me.\" He sighed. \"I can't get used to seeing you disappear\nlike an overdried soap bubble, Malone. It does something to me, here.\"\nHe placed a hand directly over his sternum and sighed again.\n\n\"I can understand that,\" Malone said. \"It unnerved me, too, the first\ntime I saw it. I thought I was going crazy, when that kid--Mike\nFueyo--winked out like a light. But then we got him, and some FBI\nagents besides me have learned the trick.\" He stopped there, wondering\nif he'd been tactful. After all, it took a latent ability to learn\nteleportation, and some people had it, while others didn't. Malone,\nalong with a few other agents, did. Burris evidently didn't, so he\ncouldn't teleport, no matter how hard he tried or how many lessons he\ntook.\n\n\"Well,\" Burris said, \"I'm still unnerved. So please, Malone, when you\ncome in here, or go out, use the door. All right?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said. He turned and went out. As he opened the\ndoor, he could almost hear Burris' sigh of relief. Then he banged it\nshut behind him and, feeling that he might as well continue with his\nspacebound existence, walked all the way to the elevator, and rode it\ndownstairs to the FBI laboratories.\n\nThe labs, highly efficient and divided into dozens of departments,\ncovered several floors. Malone passed through the Fingerprint section,\nfilled with technicians doing strange things to great charts and\nslides, and frowning over tiny pieces of material and photographs.\nThen came Forgery Detection, involving many more technicians, many\nmore slides and charts and tiny pieces of things and photographs, and\neven a witness or two sitting on the white bench at one side and\nlooking lost and somehow civilian. Identification Classified was next,\na great barn of a room filled with index files. The real indexes were\nin the sub-basement; here, on microfilm, were only the basic\ndivisions. A man was standing in front of one of the files, frowning\nat it. Malone went on by without stopping.\n\nCosmetic Surgery Classification came next. Here there were more\nindexes, and there were also charts and slides. There was an agent\nsitting on a bench looking bored while two female technicians--\nclassified as O&U for Old and Ugly in Malone's mind--fluttered around\nhim, deciding what disguises were possible, and which of those was\nindicated for the particular job on hand. Malone waved to the agent,\nwhom he knew very slightly, and went on. He felt vaguely regretful\nthat the FBI couldn't hire prettier girls for Cosmetic Surgery, but\nthe trouble was that pretty girls fell for the Agents, and vice versa,\nand this led to an unfortunate tendency toward only handsome and\nvirile-looking disguises. The O&U division was unfortunate, he\ndecided, but a necessity.\n\nChemical Analysis (III) was next. The Chemical Analysis Section was\nscattered over several floors, with the first stages up above.\nDivision III, Malone remembered, was devoted to nonpoisonous\nsubstances, like clay or sand found in boots or trouser cuffs, cigar\nashes and such. They were placed on the same floor as Fingerprints to\nallow free and frequent passage between the sections on the problems\nof plastic prints, made in putty or like substances, and visible\nprints, made when the hand is covered with a visible substance like\nblood, ketchup or glue.\n\nMalone found what he was looking for at the very end of the floor. It\nwas the Computer Section, a large room filled with humming, clacking\nand buzzing machines of an ancient vintage, muttering to themselves as\nthey worked, and newer machines which were smaller and more silent.\nLights were lighting and bells were ringing softly, relays were\nrelaying and the whole room was a gigantic maze of calculating and\ncontrol machines. What space wasn't filled by the machines themselves\nwas filled by workbenches, all littered with an assortment of gears,\ntubes, spare relays, transistors, wires, rods, bolts, resistors and\nall the other paraphernalia used in building the machines and\nrepairing them. Beyond the basic room were other, smaller rooms, each\nassigned to a particular kind of computer work.\n\nThe narrow aisles were choked here and there with men who looked up as\nMalone passed by, but most of them gave him one quick glance and went\nback to work. A few didn't even do that, but went right on\nconcentrating on their jobs. Malone headed for a man working all alone\nin front of a workbench, frowning down at a complicated-looking\nmechanism that seemed to have neither head nor tail, and prodding at\nit with a long, thin screwdriver. The man was thin, too, but not very\nlong; he was a little under average height, and he had straight black\nhair, thick-lensed glasses and a studious expression, even when he was\nfrowning. He looked as if the mechanism were a student who had cut too\nmany classes, and he was being kind but firm with it.\n\nMalone managed to get to the man's side, and coughed discreetly. There\nwas no response.\n\n\"Fred?\" he said.\n\nThe screwdriver waggled a little. Malone wasn't quite sure that the\nman was breathing.\n\n\"Fred Mitchell,\" he said.\n\nMitchell didn't look up. Another second passed.\n\n\"Hey,\" Malone said. Then he closed his eyes and took a deep breath.\n\"Fred,\" he said in a loud, reasonable-sounding voice, \"the State\nDepartment's translator has started to talk pig-Latin.\"\n\nMitchell straightened up as if somebody had jabbed him with a pin. The\nscrewdriver waved wildly in the air for a second, and then pointed at\nMalone. \"That's impossible,\" Mitchell said in a flat, precise voice.\n\"Simply impossible. It doesn't have a pig-Latin circuit. It can't\npossibly--\" He blinked and seemed to see Malone for the first time.\n\"Oh,\" he said. \"Hello, Malone. What can I do for you?\"\n\nMalone smiled, feeling a little victorious at having got through the\nMitchell armor, which was almost impregnable when there was a job in\nhand. \"I've been standing here talking to you for some time.\"\n\n\"Oh, have you?\" Mitchell said. \"I was busy.\" That, obviously,\nexplained that. Malone shrugged.\n\n\"I want you to help me check over some calculators, Fred,\" he said.\n\"We've had some reports that some of the government machines are out\nof kilter, and I'd like you to go over them for me.\"\n\n\"Out of kilter?\" Fred Mitchell said. \"No, you can forget about it.\nIt's absolutely unnecessary to make a check, believe me. Absolutely.\nForget it.\" He smiled suddenly. \"I suppose it's some kind of a joke,\nisn't it?\" he said, just a trifle uncertainly. Fred Mitchell's world,\nwhile pleasant, did not include much humor, Malone knew. \"It's\nsupposed to be funny,\" he said in the same flat, precise voice.\n\n\"It isn't funny,\" Malone said.\n\nFred sighed. \"Then they're obviously lying,\" he said, \"and that's all\nthere is to it. Why bother me with it?\"\n\n\"Lying, Fred?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Certainly,\" Fred said. He looked at the machinery with longing.\n\nMalone took a breath. \"How do you know?\" he said.\n\nFred sighed. \"It's perfectly obvious,\" he said in a patient tone.\n\"Since the State Department translator has no pig-Latin circuit, it\ncan't possibly be talking pig-Latin. I will admit that such a circuit\nwould be relatively easy to build, though it would have no utility as\nfar as I can see. Except, of course, for a joke.\" He paused. \"Joke?\"\nhe said, in a slightly uneasy tone.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Joke.\"\n\nMitchell looked relieved. \"Very well, then,\" he began. \"Since--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"The pig-Latin is a joke. That's right.\nBut I'm not talking about the pig-Latin.\"\n\n\"You're not?\" Mitchell asked, surprised.\n\n\"No,\" Malone said.\n\nMitchell frowned. \"But you said--\" he began.\n\n\"A joke,\" Malone said. \"You were perfectly right. The pig-Latin is a\njoke.\" He waited for Fred's expression to clear, and then added: \"But\nwhat I want to talk to you about isn't.\"\n\n\"It sounds very confused,\" Fred said after a pause. \"Not at all the\nsort of thing that--that usually goes on.\"\n\n\"You have no idea,\" Malone said. \"It's about the political machines,\nall right, but it isn't anything as simple as pig-Latin.\" He\nexplained, taking his time over it.\n\nWhen he had finished, Fred was nodding his head slowly. \"I see,\" he\nsaid. \"I understand just what you want me to do.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I'll take a team over to the Senate Office Building,\" Fred said, \"and\ncheck the computer-secretaries there. That way, you see, I'll be able\nto do a full running check on them without taking any one machine out\nof operation for too long.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And it shouldn't take long,\" Fred went on, \"to find out just what the\ntrouble is.\" He looked very confident.\n\n\"How long?\" Malone asked.\n\nFred shrugged. \"Oh,\" he said, \"five or six days.\"\n\nMalone repressed an impulse to scream. \"Days?\" he said. \"I mean--well,\nlook, Fred, it's important. Very important. Can't you do the job any\nfaster?\"\n\nFred gave a little sigh. \"Checking and repairing all those machines,\"\nhe said, \"is an extremely complex job. Sometimes, Malone, I don't\nthink you realize quite how complex and how delicate a job it is to\ndeal with such a high-order machine. Why--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"Check and repair them?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Fred said.\n\n\"But I don't want them repaired,\" Malone said. Seeing the look of\nhorror on Fred's face, he added hastily, \"I only want a report from\nyou on what's wrong, whether they are actually making errors or not.\nAnd if they are making errors, just what's making them do it. And just\nwhat kind of errors. See?\"\n\nFred nodded very slowly. \"But I can't just leave them there,\" he said\npiteously. \"In pieces and everything. It isn't right, Malone. It just\nisn't right.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" Malone said with energy, \"you go right ahead and repair\nthem, if you want to. Fix 'em all up. But you can do that after you\nmake the report to me, can't you?\"\n\n\"I--\" Fred hesitated. \"I had planned to check and repair each machine\non an individual basis.\"\n\n\"The Congress can allow for a short suspension,\" Malone said. \"Anyhow,\nthey can now, or as soon as I get the word to them. Suppose you check\nall the machines first, and then get around to the repair work.\"\n\n\"It's not the best way,\" Fred demurred.\n\nMalone discovered that it was his turn to sigh. \"Is it the fastest?\"\nhe said.\n\nFred nodded.\n\n\"Then it's the best,\" Malone said. \"How long?\"\n\nFred rolled his eyes to the ceiling and calculated silently for a\nsecond. \"Tomorrow morning,\" he announced, returning his gaze to\nMalone.\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"Fine.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Never mind the buts,\" Malone said hurriedly. \"I'll count on hearing\nfrom you tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"And if it looks like sabotage,\" Malone added, \"if the errors aren't\ncaused by normal wear and tear on the machines, you let me know right\naway. Phone me. Don't waste an instant.\"\n\n\"I'll--I'll start right away,\" Fred said heavily. He looked sadly at\nthe mechanism he had been working on, and put his screwdriver down\nnext to it. It looked to Malone as if he were putting flowers on the\ngrave of a dear departed. \"I'll get a team together,\" Fred added. He\ngave the mechanism and screwdriver one last fond parting look, and\ntore himself away.\n\nMalone looked after him for a second, thinking of nothing in\nparticular, and then turned in the opposite direction and headed back\ntoward the elevator. As he walked, he began to feel more and more\npleased with himself. After all, he'd gotten the investigation\nstarted, hadn't he?\n\nAnd now all he had to do was go back to his office and read some\nreports and listen to some interview tapes, and then he could go home.\n\nThe reports and the interview tapes didn't exactly sound like fun,\nMalone thought, but at the same time they seemed fairly innocent. He\nwould work his way through them grimly, and maybe he would even\nindulge his most secret vice and smoke a cigar or two to make the work\npass more pleasantly. Soon enough, he told himself, they would be\nfinished.\n\nSometimes, though, he regretted the reputation he'd gotten. It had\nbeen bad enough in the old days, the pre-1971 days when Malone had\nthought he was just lucky. Burris had called him a Boy Wonder then,\nwhen he'd cracked three difficult cases in a row. Being just lucky had\nmade it a little tough to live with the Boy Wonder label. After all,\nMalone thought, it wasn't actually as if he'd done anything.\n\nBut since 1971 and the case of the Telepathic Spy, things had gotten\nworse. Much worse. Now Malone wasn't just lucky any more. Instead, he\ncould teleport and he could even foretell the future a little, in a\ndim sort of way. He'd caught the Telepathic Spy that way, and when the\ncase of the Teleporting Juvenile Delinquents had come up he'd been\nassigned to that one too, and he'd cracked it. Now Burris seemed to\nthink of him as a kind of God, and gave him all the tough dirty jobs.\n\nAnd if he wasn't just lucky any more, Malone couldn't think of himself\nas a fearless, heroic FBI agent, either. He just wasn't the type. He\nwas ... well, talented. That was the word, he told himself: talented.\nHe had all these talents and they made him look like something\nspectacular to Burris and the other FBI men. But he wasn't, really. He\nhadn't done anything really tough to get his talents; they'd just\nhappened to him.\n\nNobody, though, seemed to believe that. He heaved a little sigh and\nstepped into the waiting elevator.\n\nThere were, after all, he thought, compensations. He'd had some good\ntimes, and the talents did come in handy. And he did have his pick of\nthe vacation schedule lately. And he'd met some lovely girls...\n\nAnd besides, he told himself savagely as the elevator shot upward, he\nwasn't going to do anything except return to his office and read some\nreports and listen to some tapes. And then he was going to go home and\nsleep all night, peacefully. And in the morning Mitchell was going to\ncall him up and tell him that the computer-secretaries needed nothing\nmore than a little repair. He'd say they were getting old, and he'd be\na little pathetic about it; but it wouldn't be anything serious.\nMalone would send out orders to get the machines repaired, and that\nwould be that. And then the next case would be something both normal\nand exciting, like a bank robbery or a kidnapping involving a gorgeous\nblonde who would be so grateful to Malone that...\n\nHe had stepped out of the elevator and gone down the corridor without\nnoticing it. He pushed at his own office door and walked into the\nouter room. The train of thought he had been following was very nice,\nand sounded very attractive indeed, he told himself.\n\nUnfortunately, he didn't believe it. His prescient ability,\nfunctioning with its usual efficient aplomb, told Malone that things\nwould not be better, or simpler, in the morning. They would be worse,\nand more complicated.\n\nThey would be quite a lot worse.\n\nAnd, as usual, that prescience was perfectly accurate.\n\n\n2\n\nThe telephone, Malone realized belatedly, had had a particularly\nnasty-sounding ring. He might have known it would be bad news.\n\nAs a matter of fact, he told himself sadly, he had known.\n\n\"Nothing at all wrong?\" he said into the mouthpiece. \"Not with any of\nthe computers?\" He blinked. \"Not even one of them?\"\n\n\"Not a thing,\" Mitchell said. \"I'll be sending a report up to you in a\nlittle while. You read it; we put them through every test, and it's\nall detailed there.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you were very thorough,\" Malone said helplessly.\n\n\"Of course we were,\" Mitchell said. \"Of course. And the machines\npassed every single test. Every one. Malone, it was beautiful.\"\n\n\"Goody,\" Malone said at random. \"But there's got to be something--\"\n\n\"There is, Malone,\" Fred said. \"There is. I think there's definitely\nsomething odd going on. Something funny. I mean peculiar, not\nhumorous.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" Malone put in.\n\n\"Right,\" Fred said. \"Malone, try and relax. This is a hard thing to\nsay, and it must be even harder to hear, but--\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" Malone said. \"Who's dead? Who's been killed?\"\n\n\"I know it's tough, Malone,\" Fred went on.\n\n\"Is everybody dead?\" Malone said. \"It can't be just one person, not\nfrom that tone in your voice. Has somebody assassinated the entire\nsenate? Or the president and his cabinet? Or--\"\n\n\"It's nothing like that, Malone,\" Fred said, in a tone that implied\nthat such occurrences were really rather minor. \"It's the machines.\"\n\n\"The machines?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Fred said grimly. \"After we checked them over and\nfound they were in good shape, I asked for samples of both the input\nand the output of each machine. I wanted to do a thorough job.\"\n\n\"Congratulations,\" Malone said. \"What happened?\"\n\nFred took a deep breath. \"They don't agree,\" he said.\n\n\"They don't?\" Malone said. The phrase sounded as if it meant something\nmomentous, but he couldn't quite figure out what. In a minute, he\nthought confusedly, it would come to him. But did he want it to?\n\n\"They definitely do not agree,\" Fred was saying. \"The correlation is\nerratic; it makes no statistical sense. Malone, there are two\npossibilities.\"\n\n\"Tell me about them,\" Malone said. He was beginning to feel relieved.\nTo Fred, the malfunction of a machine was more serious than the murder\nof the entire Congress. But Malone couldn't quite bring himself to\nfeel that way about things.\n\n\"First,\" Fred said in a tense tone, \"it's possible that the\ntechnicians feeding information to the machines are making all kinds\nof mistakes.\"\n\nMalone nodded at the phone. \"That sounds possible,\" he said. \"Which\nones?\"\n\n\"All of them,\" Fred said. \"They're all making errors--and they're all\nmaking about the same number of errors. There don't seem to be any\nreal peaks or valleys, Malone; everybody's doing it.\"\n\nMalone thought of the Varsity Drag and repressed the thought. \"A bunch\nof fumblebums,\" he said. \"All fumbling alike. It does sound unlikely,\nbut I guess it's possible. We'll get after them right away, and--\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Fred said. \"There is a second possibility.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Maybe they aren't mistakes,\" Fred said. \"Maybe the technicians are\ndeliberately feeding the machine with wrong answers.\"\n\nMalone hated to admit it, even to himself, but that answer sounded a\nlot more probable. Machine technicians weren't exactly picked off the\nstreets at random; they were highly trained for their work, and the\nidea of a whole crew of them starting to fumble at once, in a big way,\nwas a little hard to swallow.\n\nThe idea of all of them sabotaging the machines they worked on, Malone\nthought, was a tough one to take, too. But it had the advantage of\nmaking some sense. People, he told himself dully, will do nutty things\ndeliberately. It's harder to think of them doing the same nutty things\nwithout knowing it.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"however it turns out, we'll get to the\nbottom of it. Frankly, I think it's being done on purpose.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" Fred said. \"And when you find out just who's making the\ntechnicians do such things--when you find out who gives them their\norders--you let me know.\"\n\n\"Let you know?\" Malone said. \"But--\"\n\n\"Any man who would give false data to a perfectly innocent computer,\"\nFred said savagely, \"would--would--\" For a second he was apparently\nlost for comparisons. Then he finished: \"Would kill his own mother.\"\nHe paused a second and added, in an even more savage voice, \"And then\nlie about it!\"\n\nThe image on the screen snapped off, and Malone sat back in his chair\nand sighed. He spent a few minutes regretting that he hadn't chosen,\nearly in life, to be a missionary to the Fiji Islands, or possibly\nsimply a drunken bum without any troubles, but then the report\nMitchell had mentioned arrived. Malone picked it up without much\neagerness, and began going through it carefully.\n\nIt was beautifully typed and arranged; somebody on Mitchell's team had\nobviously been up all night at the job. Malone admired the work,\nwithout being able to get enthusiastic about the contents. Like all\ntechnical reports, it tended to be boring and just a trifle obscure to\nsomeone who wasn't completely familiar with the field involved. Malone\nand cybernetics were not exactly bosom buddies, and by the time he\nfinished reading through the report he was suffering from an extreme\ncase of ennui.\n\nThere were no new clues in the report, either; Mitchell's phone\nconversation had covered all of the main points. Malone put the sheaf\nof papers down on his desk and looked at them for a minute as if he\nexpected an answer to leap out from the pile and greet him with a glad\ncry. But nothing happened. Unfortunately, he had to do some more work.\n\nThe obvious next step was to start checking on the technicians who\nwere working on the machines. Malone determined privately that he\nwould give none of his reports to Fred Mitchell; he didn't like the\nidea of being responsible for murder, and that was the least Fred\nwould do to someone who confused his precious calculators.\n\nHe picked up the phone, punched for the Records Division, and waited\nuntil a bald, middle-aged face appeared. He asked the face to send up\nthe dossiers of the technicians concerned to his office. The face\nnodded.\n\n\"You want them right away?\" it said in a mild, slightly scratchy\nvoice.\n\n\"Sooner than right away,\" Malone said.\n\n\"They're coming up by messenger,\" the voice said.\n\nMalone nodded and broke the connection. The technicians had, of\ncourse, been investigated by the FBI before they'd been hired, but it\nwouldn't do any harm to check them out again. He felt grateful that he\nwouldn't have to do all that work himself; he would just go through\nthe dossiers and assign field agents to the actual checking when he\nhad a picture of what might need to be checked.\n\nHe sighed again and leaned back in his chair. He put his feet up on\nthe desk, remembered that he was entirely alone, and swung them down\nagain. He fished in a private compartment in his top desk drawer, drew\nout a cigar and unwrapped it. Putting his feet back on the desk, he\nlit the cigar, drew in a cloud of smoke, and lapsed into deep thought.\n\nCigar smoke billowed around him, making strange, fantastic shapes in\nthe air of the office. Malone puffed away, frowning slightly and\ntrying to force the puzzle he was working on to make some sense.\n\nIt certainly looked as though something were going on, he thought.\nBut, for the life of him, he couldn't figure out just what it was.\nAfter all, what could be anybody's purpose in goofing up a bunch of\ncalculators the way they had? Of course, the whole thing could be a\nseries of accidents, but the series was a pretty long one, and made\nMalone suspicious to start with. It was easier to assume that the\ngoof-ups were being done deliberately.\n\nUnfortunately, they didn't make much sense as sabotage, either.\n\nSenator Deeds, for instance, had sent out a ten-thousand-copy form\nletter to his constituents, blasting an Administration power bill in\nextremely strong language, and asking for some comments on the\nDeeds-Hartshorn Air Ownership Bill, a pending piece of legislation\nthat provided for private, personal ownership, based on land title, to\nthe upper stratosphere, with a strong hint that rights of passage no\nlonger applied without some recompense to the owner of the air.\nNaturally, Deeds had filed the original with a computer-secretary to\nturn out ten thousand duplicate copies, and the machine had done so,\nfolding the copies, slipping them into addressed envelopes and sending\nthem out under the Senator's franking stamp.\n\nThe addresses on the envelopes, however, had not been those of the\nSenator's supporters. The letter had been sent to ten thousand\nstockholders in major airline companies, and the Senator's head was\nstill ringing from the force of the denunciatory letters, telegrams\nand telephone calls he'd been getting.\n\nAnd then there was Representative Follansbee of South Dakota. A set of\nnews releases on the proposed Follansbee Waterworks Bill contained the\nstatement that the artificial lake which Follansbee proposed in the\nBlack Hills country \"be formed by controlled atomic power blasts, and\nfilled with water obtained from collecting the tears of widows and\norphans.\"\n\nNewsmen who saw this release immediately checked the bill. The wording\nwas exactly the same. Follansbee claimed that the \"widows and orphans\"\nphrase had appeared in his speech on the bill, and not in the proposed\nbill itself. \"It's completely absurd,\" he said, with commendable calm,\n\"to consider this method of filling an artificial lake.\"\nUnfortunately, the absurdity was now contained in the bill, which\nwould have to go back to committee for redefinition, and probably\nwouldn't come up again in the present session of Congress. Judging\nfrom the amount of laughter that had greeted the error when it had\ncome to light, Malone privately doubted whether any amount of\nredefinition was going to save it from a landslide defeat.\n\nRepresentative Keller of Idaho had made a speech which contained so\nmany errors of fact that newspaper editorials, and his enemies on the\nfloor of Congress, cut him to pieces with ease and pleasure. Keller\ncomplained of his innocence and said he'd gotten his facts from a\ncomputer-secretary, but this didn't save him. His re-election was a\nmatter for grave concern in his own party, and the opposition was,\nnaturally, tickled. They would not, Malone thought, dare to be tickled\npink.\n\nAnd these were not the only casualties. They were the most blatant\nfoul-ups, but there were others, such as the mistake in numbering of a\nHouse Bill that resulted in a two-month delay during which the\nopposition to the bill raised enough votes to defeat it on the floor.\nCommunications were diverted or lost or scrambled in small ways that\nmade for confusion--including, Malone recalled, the perfectly horrible\nmixup that resulted when a freshman senator, thinking he was talking\nto his girlfriend on a blanked-vision circuit, discovered he was\ntalking to his wife.\n\nThe flow of information was being blocked by bottlenecks that suddenly\nexisted where there had never been bottlenecks before.\n\nAnd it wasn't only the computers, Malone knew. He remembered the\nreports the senators and representatives had made. Someone forgot to\nsend an important message here, or sent one too soon over there. Both\ncourses were equally disturbing, and both resulted in more snarl-ups.\nReports that should have been sent in weeks before arrived too late;\nreports meant for the eyes of only one man were turned out in\ntriplicate and passed all over the offices of Congress.\n\nEach snarl-up was a little one. But, together, they added up to\ninefficiency of a kind and extent that hadn't been seen, Malone told\nhimself with some wonder, since the Harding administration fifty years\nbefore.\n\nAnd there didn't seem to be anyone to blame anything on.\n\nMalone thought hopefully of sabotage, infiltration and mass treason,\nbut it didn't make him feel much better. He puffed out some more smoke\nand frowned at nothing.\n\nThere was a knock at the door of his office.\n\nSpeedily and guiltily, he swung his feet off the desk and snatched the\ncigar out of his mouth. He jammed it into a deep ashtray and put the\nashtray back into his desk drawer. He locked the drawer, waved\nineffectively at the clouds of smoke that surrounded him, and said in\na resigned voice: \"Come in.\"\n\nThe door opened. A tall, solidly-built man stood there, wearing a\nfringe of beard and a cheerful expression. The man had an enormous\namount of muscle distributed more or less evenly over his chunky body,\nand a pot-belly that looked as if he had swallowed a globe of the\nworld. In addition, he was smoking a cigarette and letting out little\npuffs of smoke, rather like a toy locomotive.\n\n\"Well, well,\" Malone said, brushing feebly at the smoke that still\nwreathed him faintly. \"If it isn't Thomas Boyd, the FBI's answer to\nNero Wolfe.\"\n\n\"And if the physique holds true, you're Sherlock Holmes, I suppose,\"\nBoyd said.\n\nMalone shook his head, thinking sadly of his father and the cigar.\n\"Not exactly,\" he said. \"Not ex--\" And then it came to him. It wasn't\nthat he was ashamed of smoking cigars like his father, exactly, but\ncigars just weren't right for a fearless, dedicated FBI agent. And he\nhad just thought of a way to keep Boyd from knowing what he'd been\ndoing. \"That's a hell of a cigarette you're smoking, by the way,\" he\nsaid.\n\nBoyd looked at it. \"It is?\" he said.\n\n\"Sure is,\" Malone said, hoping he sounded sufficiently innocent.\n\"Smells like a cigar or something.\"\n\nBoyd sniffed the air for a second, his face wrinkled. Then he looked\ndown at his cigarette again. \"By God,\" he said, \"you're right, Ken. It\n_does_ smell like a cigar.\" He came over to Malone's desk, looked\naround for an ashtray and didn't find one, and finally went to the\nwindow and tossed the cigarette out into the Washington breeze. \"How\nare things, anyhow, Ken?\" he said.\n\n\"Things are confused,\" Malone said. \"Aren't they always?\"\n\nBoyd came back to the desk and sat down in a chair at one side of it.\nHe put his elbow on the desk. \"Sure they are,\" he said. \"I'm confused\nmyself, as a matter of fact. Only I think I know where I can get some\nhelp.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd nodded. \"Burris told me I might be able to get some information\nfrom a certain famous and highly respected person,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, well,\" Malone said. \"Who?\"\n\n\"You,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said, trying to look disappointed, flattered and modest\nall at the same time. \"Well,\" he went on after a second, \"anything I\ncan do--\"\n\n\"Burris thought you might have some answers,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Burris is getting optimistic in his old age,\" Malone said. \"I don't\neven have many questions.\"\n\nBoyd nodded. \"Well,\" he said, \"you know this California thing?\"\n\n\"Sure I do,\" Malone said. \"You're looking into the resignation out\nthere, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Senator Burley,\" Boyd said. \"That's right But Senator Burley's\nresignation isn't all of it, by any means.\"\n\n\"It isn't?\" Malone said, trying to sound interested.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Boyd said. \"It goes a lot deeper than it looks on the\nsurface. In the past year, Ken, five senators have announced their\nresignations from the Senate of the United States. It isn't exactly a\nrecord--\"\n\n\"It sounds like a record,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Well,\" Boyd said, \"there was 1860 and the Civil War, when a whole lot\nof senators and representatives resigned all at once.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"But there isn't any Civil War going on now. At\nleast,\" he added, \"I haven't heard of any.\"\n\n\"That's what makes it so funny,\" Boyd said. \"Of course, Senator Burley\nsaid it was ill health, and so did two others, while Senator Davidson\nsaid it was old age.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"people do get old. And sick.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Boyd said. \"The only trouble is--\" He paused. \"Ken,\" he said,\n\"do you mind if I smoke? I mean, do you mind the smell of cigars?\"\n\n\"Mind?\" Malone said. \"Not at all.\" He blinked. \"Besides,\" he added,\n\"maybe this one won't smell like a cigar.\"\n\n\"Well, the last one did,\" Boyd said. He took a cigarette out of a pack\nin his pocket, and lit it. He sniffed. \"You know,\" he said, \"you're\nright. This one doesn't.\"\n\n\"I told you,\" Malone said. \"Must have been a bad cigarette. Spoiled or\nsomething.\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" Boyd said vaguely. \"But about these retirements--the FBI\nwanted me to look into it because of Burley's being mixed up with the\nspace program scandal last year. Remember?\"\n\n\"Vaguely,\" Malone said. \"I was busy last year.\"\n\n\"Sure you were,\" Boyd said. \"We were both busy getting famous and well\nknown.\"\n\nMalone grinned. \"Go on with the story,\" he said.\n\nBoyd puffed at his cigarette. \"Anyhow, we couldn't find anything\nreally wrong,\" he said. \"Three senators retiring because of ill\nhealth, one because of old age. And Farnsworth, the youngest, had a\nnervous breakdown.\"\n\n\"I didn't hear about it,\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd shrugged \"We hushed it up,\" he said. \"But Farnsworth's got\ndelusions of persecution. He apparently thinks somebody's out to get\nhim. As a matter of fact, he thinks _everybody's_ out to get him.\"\n\n\"Now that,\" Malone said, \"sounds familiar.\"\n\nBoyd leaned back a little more in his chair. \"Here's the funny thing,\nthough,\" he said. \"The others all act as if they're suspicious of\neverybody who talks to them. Not anything obvious, you understand.\nJust worried, apprehensive. Always looking at you out of the corners\nof their eyes. That kind of thing.\"\n\nMalone thought of Senator Lefferts, who was also suffering from\ndelusions of persecution, delusions that had real evidence to back\nthem up. \"It does sound funny,\" he said cautiously.\n\n\"Well, I reported everything to Burris,\" Boyd went on. \"And he said\nyou were working on something similar, and we might as well pool our\nresources.\"\n\n\"Here we go again,\" Malone said. He took a deep breath, filling his\nnostrils with what remained of the cigar odor in the room, and felt\nmore peaceful. Quickly, he told Boyd about what had been happening in\nCongress. \"It seems pretty obvious,\" he finished, \"that there is some\nkind of a tie-up between the two cases.\"\n\n\"Maybe it's obvious,\" Boyd said, \"but it is just a little bit odd. Fun\nand games. You know, Ken, Burris was right.\"\n\n\"How?\" Malone said.\n\n\"He said everything was all mixed up,\" Boyd went on. \"He told me the\ncountry was going to Rome in a handbasket, or something like that.\"\n\nWondering vaguely if Burris had really been predicting mass religious\nconversions, Malone nodded silently.\n\n\"And he's right,\" Boyd said. \"Look at the newspapers. Everything's\nscrewy lately.\"\n\n\"Everything always is screwy,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Not like now,\" Boyd said. \"So many big-shot gangsters have been\nkilled lately we might as well bring back Prohibition. And the labor\nunions are so busy with internal battles that they haven't had time to\ngo on strike for over a year.\"\n\n\"Is that bad?\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd shrugged. \"God knows,\" he said. \"But it's sure confusing as all\nhell.\"\n\n\"And now,\" Malone said, \"with all that going on--\"\n\n\"The Congress of the United States decides to go off its collective\nrocker,\" Boyd finished. \"Exactly.\" He stared down at his cigarette for\na minute with a morose and pensive expression on his face. He looked,\nMalone thought, like Henry VIII trying to decide what to do about all\nthese here wives.\n\nThen he looked up at Malone. \"Ken,\" he said in a strained voice,\n\"there seem to be a lot of nutty cases lately.\"\n\nMalone considered. \"No,\" he said at last. \"It's just that when a nutty\none comes along, we get it.\"\n\n\"That's what I mean,\" Boyd said. \"I wonder why that is.\"\n\nMalone shrugged. \"It takes a thief to catch a thief,\" he said.\n\n\"But these aren't thieves,\" Boyd said. \"I mean, they're just nutty.\"\nHe paused. \"Oh,\" he said.\n\n\"And two thieves are better than one,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" Boyd said with a small, gusty sigh, \"it's company.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd looked for an ashtray, failed again to find one, and walked over\nto flip a second cigarette out onto Washington. He came back to his\nchair, sat down, and said, \"What's our next step, Ken?\"\n\nMalone considered carefully. \"First,\" he said finally, \"we'll start\nassuming something. We'll start assuming that there is some kind of\norganization behind all this, behind all the senators' resignations\nand everything like that.\"\n\n\"It sounds like a big assumption,\" Boyd said.\n\nMalone shook his head. \"It isn't really,\" he said. \"After all, we\ncan't figure it's the work of one person: it's too widespread for\nthat. And it's silly to assume that everything's accidental.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Boyd said equably. \"It's an organization.\"\n\n\"Trying to subvert the United States,\" Malone went on. \"Reducing\neverything to chaos. And that brings in everything else, Tom. That\nbrings in the unions and the gang wars and everything.\"\n\nBoyd blinked. \"How?\" he said.\n\n\"Obvious,\" Malone said. \"Strife brought on by internal confusion,\nthat's what's going on all over. It's the same pattern. And if we\nassume an organization trying to jam up the United States, it even\nmakes sense.\" He leaned back and beamed.\n\n\"Sure it makes sense,\" Boyd said. \"But who's the organization?\"\n\nMalone shrugged.\n\n\"If I were doing the picking,\" Boyd said, \"I'd pick the Russians. Or\nthe Chinese. Or both. Probably both.\"\n\n\"It's a possibility,\" Malone said. \"Anyhow, if it's sabotage, who else\nwould be interested in sabotaging the United States? There's some\nRussian or Chinese organization fouling up Congress, and the unions,\nand the gangs. Come to think of it, why the gangs? It seems to me that\nif you left the professional gangsters strong, it would do even more\nto foul things up.\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" Boyd said. \"Maybe they're trying to get rid of American\ngangsters so they can import some of their own.\"\n\n\"That doesn't make any sense,\" Malone said, \"but I'll think about it.\nIn the meantime, we have one more interesting question.\"\n\n\"We do?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Sure we do,\" Malone said. \"The question is: how?\"\n\nBoyd said: \"Mmm.\" Then there was silence for a little while.\n\n\"How are the saboteurs doing all this?\" Malone said. \"It just doesn't\nseem very probable that _all_ the technicians in the Senate Office\nBuilding, for instance, are spies. It makes even less sense that the\nlabor unions are composed mostly of spies. Or, for that matter, the\nMafia and the organizations like it. What would spies be doing in the\nMafia?\"\n\n\"Learning Italian,\" Boyd said instantly.\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" Malone said. \"If there were that many spies in this\ncountry, the Russians wouldn't have to fight at all. They could _vote_\nthe Communists into power, and by a nice big landslide, too.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Boyd said. \"If there aren't so many spies, then how\nis all this getting done?\"\n\nMalone beamed. \"That's the question,\" he said. \"And I think I have an\nanswer.\"\n\n\"You do?\" Boyd said. After a second he said: \"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"Suppose you tell me,\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd opened his mouth. Nothing emerged. He shut it. A second passed\nand he opened it again. \"Magic?\" he said weakly.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Malone said cheerfully. \"But you're getting warm.\"\n\nBoyd shut his eyes. \"I'm not going to stand for it,\" he announced.\n\"I'm not going to take any more.\"\n\n\"Any more what?\" Malone said. \"Tell me what you have in mind.\"\n\n\"I won't even consider it,\" Boyd said. \"It haunts me. It gets into my\ndreams. Now, look, Ken, I can't even see a pitchfork any more without\nthinking of Greek letters.\"\n\nMalone took a breath. \"Which Greek letter?\" he said.\n\n\"You know very well,\" Boyd said. \"What a pitchfork looks like. _Psi._\nAnd I'm not even going to think about it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said equably, \"you won't have to. If you'd rather start\nwith the Russian-spy end of things, you can do that.\"\n\n\"What I'd rather do,\" Boyd said, \"is resign.\"\n\n\"Next year,\" Malone said instantly. \"For now, you can wait around\nuntil the dossiers come up--they're for the Senate Office Building\ntechnicians, and they're on the way. You can go over them, and start\nchecking on any known Russian agents in the country for contacts. You\ncan also start checking on the dossiers, and in general for any\nhanky-panky.\"\n\nBoyd blinked. \"Hanky-panky?\" he said.\n\n\"It's a perfectly good word,\" Malone said, offended. \"Or two words.\nAnyhow, you can start on that end, and not worry about anything else.\"\n\n\"It's going to haunt me,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"eat lots of ectoplasm and get enough sleep, and\neverything will be fine. After all, I'm going to have to do the real\nend of the work, the psionics end. I may be wrong, but--\"\n\nHe was interrupted by the phone. He flicked the switch and Andrew J.\nBurris' face appeared on the screen.\n\n\"Malone,\" Burris said instantly, \"I just got a complaint from the\nState Department that ties in with your work. Their translator has\nbeen acting up.\"\n\nMalone couldn't say anything for a minute.\n\n\"Malone,\" Burris went on. \"I said--\"\n\n\"I heard you,\" Malone said. \"And it doesn't have one.\"\n\n\"It doesn't have one what?\" Burris said.\n\n\"A pig-Latin circuit,\" Malone said. \"What else?\"\n\nBurris' voice was very calm. \"Malone,\" he said, \"what does pig-Latin\nhave to do with anything?\"\n\n\"You said--\"\n\n\"I said one of the State Department translators was acting up,\" Burris\nsaid. \"If you want details--\"\n\n\"I don't think I can stand them,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Some of the Russian and Chinese releases have come through with the\nmeaning slightly altered,\" Burris went on doggedly. \"And I want you to\ncheck on it right away. I--\"\n\n\"Thank God,\" Malone said.\n\nBurris blinked. \"What?\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Malone said. \"Never mind. I'm glad you told me, Chief.\nI'll get to work on it right away, and--\"\n\n\"You do that, Malone,\" Burris said. \"And for God's sake stop calling\nme Chief! Do I look like an Indian? Do I have feathers in my hair?\"\n\n\"Anything,\" Malone said grandly, \"is possible.\" He broke the\nconnection in a hurry.\n\n\n3\n\nThe summer sun beat down on the white city of Washington, D. C, as if\nit had mistaken its instructions slightly and was convinced that the\ncity had been put down somewhere in the Sahara. The sun seemed\nconfused, Malone thought. If this were the Sahara, obviously there was\nno reason whatever for the Potomac to be running through it. The sun\nwas doing its best to correct this small error, however, by exerting\neven more heat in a valiant attempt to dry up the river.\n\nIts attempt was succeeding, at least partially. The Potomac was still\nthere, but quite a lot of it was not in the river bed any more.\nInstead, it had gone into the air, which was so humid by now that\nMalone was willing to swear that it was splashing into his lungs at\nevery inhalation. Resisting an impulse to try the breaststroke, he\nstood in the full glare of the straining sun, just outside the Senate\nOffice Building. He looked across at the Capitol, just opposite,\nsquinting his eyes manfully against the glare of its dome in the\nbrightness.\n\nThe Capitol was, at any rate, some relief from the sight of Thomas\nBoyd and a group of agents busily grilling two technicians. That was\ngoing on in the Senate Office Building, and Malone had come over to\nwatch the proceedings. Everything had been set up in what Malone\nconsidered the most complicated fashion possible. A big room had been\nturned into a projection chamber, and films were being run off over\nand over. The films, taken by hidden cameras watching the\ncomputer-secretaries, had caught two technicians red-handed punching\nerrors into the machines. Boyd had leaped on this evidence, and he and\nhis crew were showing the movies to the technicians and questioning\nthem under bright lights in an effort to break down their resistance.\n\nBut it didn't look as though they were going to have any more success\nthan the sun was having, turning Washington into the Sahara. After\nall, Malone told himself, wiping his streaming brow, there were no\nPyramids in Washington. He tried to discover whether that made any\nsense, but it was too much work. He went back to thinking about Boyd.\n\nThe technicians were sticking to their original stories that the\nmistakes had been honest ones. It sounded like a sensible idea to\nMalone; after all, people did make mistakes. And the FBI didn't have a\nsingle shred of evidence to prove that the technicians were engaged in\ndeliberate sabotage. But Boyd wasn't giving up. Over and over he got\nthe technicians to repeat their stories, looking for discrepancies or\nslips. Over and over he ran off the films of their mistakes, looking\nfor some clue, some shred of evidence.\n\nEven the sight of the Capitol, Malone told himself sadly, was better\nthan any more of Boyd's massive investigation techniques.\n\nHe had come out to do some thinking. He believed, in spite of a good\ndeal of evidence to the contrary, that his best ideas came to him\nwhile walking. At any rate, it was a way of getting away from four\nwalls and from the prying eyes and anxious looks of superiors. He\nsighed gently, crammed his hat onto his head and started out.\n\nOnly a maniac, he reflected, would wear a hat on a day like the one he\nwas swimming through. But the people who passed him as he trudged\nonward to no particular destination didn't seem to notice; they gave\nhim a fairly wide berth, and seemed very polite, but that wasn't\nbecause they thought he was nuts, Malone knew. It was because they\nknew he was an FBI man.\n\nThat was the result of an FBI regulation. All agents had to wear hats.\nMalone wasn't sure why, and his thinking on the matter had only\ndredged up the idea that you had to have a hat in case somebody asked\nyou to keep something under it. But the FBI was firm about its\nrulings. No matter what the weather, an agent wore a hat. Malone\nthought bitterly that he might just as well wear a red, white and blue\nluminous sign that said _FBI_ in great winking letters, and maybe a\nhooting siren too. Still, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was not\nsupposed to be a secret organization, no matter what occasional\ncritics might say. And the hats, at least as long as the weather\nremained broiling, were enough proof of that for anybody.\n\nMalone could feel water collecting under his hat and soaking his head.\nHe removed the hat quickly, wiped his head with a handkerchief and\nreplaced the hat, feeling as if he had become incognito for a few\nseconds. The hat was back on now, feeling official but terrible, and\nabout the same was true of the fully-loaded Smith & Wesson .44\nMagnum revolver which hung in his shoulder holster. The harness chafed\nat his shoulder and chest and the weight of the gun itself was an\nadded and unwelcome burden.\n\nBut even without the gun and the hat, Malone did not feel exactly\nchipper. His shirt and undershirt were no longer two garments, but\none, welded together by seamless sweat and plastered heavily and not\ntoo skillfully to his skin. His trouser legs clung damply to calves\nand thighs, rubbing as he walked, and at the knees each trouser leg\nattached and detached itself with the unpleasant regularity of a wet\nbastinado. Inside Malone's shoes, his socks were completely awash, and\nhe seemed to squish as he walked. It was hard to tell, but there\nseemed to be a small fish in his left shoe. It might, he told himself,\nbe no more than a pebble or a wrinkle in his sock. But he was willing\nto swear that it was swimming upstream.\n\nAnd the forecast, he told himself bitterly, was for continued warm.\n\nHe forced himself to take his mind off his own troubles and get back\nto the troubles of the FBI in general, such as the problem at hand. It\nwas an effort, but he frowned and kept walking, and within a block he\nwas concentrating again on the _psi_ powers.\n\n_Psi_, he told himself, was behind the whole mess. In spite of Boyd's\nhorrified refusal to believe such a thing, Malone was sure of it.\nThree years ago, of course, he wouldn't have considered the notion\neither. But since then a great many things had happened, and his\nhorizons had widened. After all, capturing a double handful of totally\ninsane, if perfectly genuine telepaths, from asylums all over the\ncountry, was enough by itself to widen quite a few stunned horizons.\nAnd then, later, there had been the gang of juvenile delinquents. They\nhad been perfectly normal juvenile delinquents, stealing cars and\nbopping a stray policeman or two. It happened, though, that they had\nsolved the secret of instantaneous teleportation, too. This made them\njust a trifle unusual.\n\nIn capturing them, Malone, too, had learned the teleportation secret.\nUnlike Boyd, he thought, or Burris, the idea of psionic power didn't\nbother him much. After all, the psionic spectrum (if it was a spectrum\nat all) was just as much a natural phenomenon as gravity or magnetism.\n\nIt was just a little hard for some people to get used to.\n\nAnd, of course, he didn't fully understand _how_ it worked, or _why_.\nThis put him in the position, he told himself, of an Australian\naborigine. He tried to imagine an Australian aborigine in a hat on a\nhot day, decided the aborigine would have too much sense, and got back\noff the subject again.\n\nHowever, he thought grimly, there was this Australian aborigine. And\nhe had a magnifying glass, which he'd picked up from the wreck of some\nship. Using that--assuming that experience, or a friendly missionary,\ntaught him how--he could manage to light a fire, using the sun's\nthermonuclear processes to do the job. Malone doubted that the\naborigine knew anything about thermonuclear processes, but he could\nstart a fire with them.\n\nAs a matter of fact, he told himself, the aborigine didn't understand\noxidation, either. But he could use that fire, when he got it going.\nIn spite of his lack of knowledge, the aborigine could use that nice,\nhot, burning fire...\n\nHurriedly, Malone pried his thoughts away from aborigines and heat,\nand tried to focus his mind elsewhere. He didn't understand psionic\nprocesses, he thought; but then, nobody did, really, as far as he\nknew. But he could use them.\n\nAnd, obviously, somebody else could use them too.\n\nOnly what kind of force was being used? What kind of psionic force\nwould it take to make so many people in the United States goof up the\nway they were doing?\n\nThat, Malone told himself, was a good question, a basic and an\nimportant question. He was proud of himself for thinking of it.\n\nUnfortunately, he didn't have the answer.\n\nBut he thought he knew a way of getting one.\n\nIt was perfectly true that nobody knew much about how psionics worked.\nFor that matter, nobody knew very much about how gravity worked. But\nthere was still some information, and, in the case of psionics, Malone\nknew where it was to be found.\n\nIt was to be found in Yucca Flats, Nevada.\n\nIt was, of course, true that Nevada would probably be even hotter than\nWashington, D. C. But there was no help for that, Malone told himself\nsadly; and, besides, the cold chill of the expert himself would\nprobably cool things off quite rapidly. Malone thought of Dr. Thomas\nO'Connor, the Westinghouse psionics expert and frowned. O'Connor was\nnot exactly what might be called a friendly man.\n\nBut he did know more about psionics than anyone else Malone could\nthink of. And his help had been invaluable in solving the two previous\npsionic cases Malone had worked on.\n\nFor a second he thought of calling O'Connor, but he brushed that\nthought aside bravely. In spite of the heat of Yucca Flats, he would\nhave to talk to the man personally. He thought again of O'Connor's\ncongealed personality, and wondered if it would really be effective in\ncombating the heat. If it were, he told himself, he would take the man\nright back to Washington with him, and plug him into the\nair-conditioning lines.\n\nHe sighed deeply, thought about a cigar and decided regretfully\nagainst it, here on the public street where he would be visible to\nanyone. Instead, he looked around him, discovered that he was only a\nblock from a large, neon-lit drugstore and headed for it. Less than a\nminute later he was in a phone booth.\n\nThe operators throughout the country seemed to suffer from heat\nprostration, and Malone was hardly inclined to blame them. But, all\nthe same, it took several minutes for him to get through to Dr.\nO'Connor's office, and a minute or so more before he could convince a\nsecurity-addled secretary that, after all, he would hardly blow\nO'Connor to bits over the long-distance phone.\n\nFinally the secretary, with a sigh of reluctance, said she would see\nif Dr. O'Connor were available. Malone waited in the phone booth,\nopening the door every few seconds to breathe. The booth was\nair-conditioned, but remained for some mystical reason an even ten\ndegrees above the boiling point of Malone's temper.\n\nFinally Dr. O'Connor's lean, pallid face appeared on the screen. He\nhad not changed since Malone had last seen him. He still looked, and\nacted, like one of Malone's more disliked law professors.\n\n\"Ah,\" the scientist said in a cold, precise voice. \"Mr. Malone. I am\nsorry for our precautions, but you understand that security must be\nserved.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Being an FBI man, of course you would,\" Dr. O'Connor went on, his\nface changing slightly and his voice warming almost to the boiling\npoint of nitrogen. It was obvious that the phrase was Dr. O'Connor's\nidea of a little joke, and Malone smiled politely and nodded. The\nscientist seemed to feel some friendliness toward Malone, though it\nwas hard to tell for sure. But Malone had brought him some fine\nspecimens to work with--telepaths and teleports, though human, being\nno more than specimens to such a very precise scientific mind--and he\nseemed grateful for Malone's diligence and effort in finding such\nfascinating objects of study.\n\nThat Malone certainly hadn't started out to find them made, it\nappeared, very little difference.\n\n\"Well, then,\" O'Connor said, returning to his normal, serious tone.\n\"What can I do for you, Mr. Malone?\"\n\n\"If you have the time, Doctor,\" Malone said respectfully, \"I'd like to\ntalk to you for a few minutes.\" He had the absurd feeling that\nO'Connor was going to tell him to stop by after class, but the\nscientist only nodded.\n\n\"Your call is timed very well,\" he said. \"As it happens, Mr. Malone, I\ndo have a few seconds to spare just now.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I should be glad to talk with you,\" O'Connor said, without looking\nany more glad than ever.\n\n\"I'll be right there,\" Malone said. O'Connor nodded again, and blanked\nout. Malone switched off and took a deep, superheated breath of phone\nbooth air. For a second he considered starting his trip from outside\nthe phone booth, but that was dangerous--if not to Malone, then to\ninnocent spectators. Psionics was by no means a household word, and\nthe sight of Malone leaving for Nevada might send several citizens\nstraight to the wagon. Which was not a place, he thought judiciously,\nfor anybody to be on such a hot day.\n\nHe closed his eyes for a fraction of a second. In that time he\nreconstructed from memory a detailed, three-dimensional, full-color\nimage of Dr. O'Connor's office in his mind. It was perfect in detail;\nhe checked it over mentally and then, by a special effort of will, he\ngave himself the psychic push that made the transition possible.\n\nWhen he opened his eyes, he was in O'Connor's office, standing in\nfront of the scientist's wide desk. He hoped nobody had been looking\ninto the phone booth at the instant he had disappeared, but he was\nreasonably sure he'd been unobserved. People didn't go around peering\ninto phone booths, after all, and he had seen no one.\n\nO'Connor looked up without surprise. \"Ah,\" he said. \"Sit down, Mr.\nMalone.\" Malone looked around for the chair, which was an\nuncomfortably straight-backed affair, and sat down in it gingerly.\nRemembering past visits to O'Connor, he was grateful for even the\nsmall amount of relaxation the hard wood afforded him. O'Connor had\nonly recently unbent to the point of supplying a spare chair in his\noffice for visitors, and, apparently, especially for Malone. Perhaps,\nMalone thought, it was more gratitude for the lovely specimens.\n\nMalone still felt uncomfortable, but tried bravely not to show it. He\nfelt slightly guilty, too, as he always did when he popped into\nO'Connor's office without bothering to stay space-bound. By law, after\nall, he knew he should check in and out at the main gate of the huge,\nultra-top-secret Government reservation whenever he visited Yucca\nFlats. But that meant wasting a lot of time and going through a lot of\ntrouble. Malone had rationalized it out for himself that way, and had\ngotten just far enough to do things the quick and easy way and not\nquite far enough to feel undisturbed about it. After all, he told\nhimself grimly, anything that saved time and trouble increased the\nefficiency of the FBI, so it was all to the good.\n\nHe swallowed hard. \"Dr. O'Connor--\" he began.\n\nO'Connor looked up again. \"Yes?\" he said. He'd had plenty of practice\nin watching people appear and disappear, between Malone and the\nspecimens Malone had brought him; he was beyond surprise or shock by\nnow.\n\n\"I came here to talk to you,\" Malone began again.\n\nO'Connor nodded, a trifle impatiently. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I know that.\"\n\n\"Well--\" Malone thought fast. Presenting the case to O'Connor was\nimpossible; it was too complicated, and it might violate governmental\nsecrecy somewhere along the line. He decided to wrap it up in a\nhypothetical situation. \"Doctor,\" he said, \"I know that all the\nvarious manifestations of the _psi_ powers were investigated and named\nlong before responsible scientists became interested in the subject.\"\n\n\"That,\" O'Connor said with some reluctance, \"is true.\" He looked sad,\nas if he wished they'd waited on naming some of the psionic\nmanifestations until he'd been born and started investigating them.\nMalone tried to imagine a person doing something called O'Connorizing,\nand decided he was grateful for history.\n\n\"Well, then--\" he said.\n\n\"At least,\" O'Connor cut in, \"it is true in a rather vague and general\nway. You see, Mr. Malone, any precise description of a psionic\nmanifestation must wait until a metalanguage has grown up to encompass\nit; that is, until understanding and knowledge have reached the point\nwhere careful and accurate description can take place.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said helplessly. \"Sure.\" He wondered if what O'Connor had\nsaid meant anything, and decided that it probably did, but he didn't\nwant to know about it.\n\n\"While we have not yet reached that point,\" O'Connor said, \"we are\napproaching it in our experiments. I am hopeful that, in the near\nfuture--\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone cut in desperately, \"sure. Of course. Naturally.\"\n\nDr. O'Connor looked miffed. The temperature of the room seemed to drop\nseveral degrees, and Malone swallowed hard and tried to look\ningratiating and helpful, like a student with nothing but A's on his\nrecord.\n\nBefore O'Connor could pick up the thread of his sentence, Malone went\non: \"What I mean is something like this. Picking up the mental\nactivity of another person is called telepathy. Floating in the air is\ncalled levitation. Moving objects around is psychokinesis. Going from\none place to another instantaneously is teleportation. And so on.\"\n\n\"The language you use,\" O'Connor said, still miffed, \"is extremely\nloose. I might go so far as to say that the statements you have made\nare, essentially, meaningless as a result of their lack of rigor.\"\n\nMalone took a deep breath. \"Dr. O'Connor,\" he said, \"you know what I\nmean, don't you?\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" O'Connor said, with the air of a king granting a\npardon to a particularly repulsive-looking subject in the lowest\nincome brackets.\n\n\"Well, then,\" Malone said. \"Yes or no?\"\n\nO'Connor frowned. \"Yes or no what?\" he said.\n\n\"I--\" Malone blinked. \"I mean, the things have names,\" he said at\nlast. \"All the various psionic manifestations have names.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" O'Connor said. \"Well. I should say--\" He put his fingertips\ntogether and stared at a point on the white ceiling for a second.\n\"Yes,\" he said at last.\n\nMalone breathed a sigh of relief. \"Good,\" he said. \"That's what I\nwanted to know.\" He leaned forward. \"And if they all do have names,\"\nhe went on, \"what is it called when a large group of people are forced\nto act in a certain manner?\"\n\nO'Connor shrugged. \"Forced?\" he said.\n\n\"Forced by mental power,\" Malone said.\n\nThere was a second of silence.\n\n\"At first,\" O'Connor said, \"I might think of various examples: the\nactions of a mob, for example, or the demonstrations of the Indian\nRope Trick, or perhaps the sale of a useless product through\ntelevision or through other advertising.\" Again his face moved, ever\nso slightly, in what he obviously believed to be a smile. \"The usual\nname for such a phenomenon is 'mass hypnotism,' Mr. Malone,\" he said.\n\"But that is not, strictly speaking, a _psi_ phenomenon at all.\nStudies in that area belong to the field of mob psychology; they are\nnot properly in my scope.\" He looked vastly superior to anything and\neverything that was outside his scope. Malone concentrated on looking\nreceptive and understanding.\n\n\"Yes?\" he said.\n\nO'Connor gave him a look that made Malone feel he'd been caught\ncribbing during an exam, but the scientist said nothing to back up the\nlook. Instead he went on: \"I will grant that there may be an\namplification of the telepathic faculty in the normal individual in\nsuch cases.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said doubtfully.\n\n\"Such an amplification,\" O'Connor went on, as if he hadn't heard,\n\"would account for the apparent--ah--mental linkage that makes a mob\nappear to act as a single organism during certain periods of--ah--\nstress.\" He looked judicious for a second, and then nodded. \"However,\"\nhe said, \"other than that, I would doubt that there is any psionic\nforce involved.\"\n\nMalone spent a second or two digesting O'Connor's reply.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"I'm not sure that's what I meant. I mean,\nI'm not sure I meant to ask that question.\" He took a breath and\ndecided to start all over. \"It's not like a mob,\" he said, \"with\neverybody all doing the same thing at the same time. It's more like a\ngroup of men, all separated, without any apparent connections between\nany of the men. And they're all working toward a common goal. All\ndoing different things, but all with the same objective. See?\"\n\n\"Of course I do,\" O'Connor said flatly. \"But what you're suggesting--\"\nHe looked straight at Malone. \"Have you had any experience of this\n... phenomenon?\"\n\n\"Experience?\" Malone said.\n\n\"I believe you have had,\" O'Connor said. \"Such a concept could not\nhave come to you in a theoretical manner. You must be involved with an\nactual situation very much like the one you describe.\"\n\nMalone swallowed. \"Me?\" he said.\n\n\"Mr. Malone,\" O'Connor said. \"May I remind you that this is Yucca\nFlats? That the security checks here are as careful as anywhere in the\nworld? That I, myself, have top-security clearance for many special\nprojects? You do not need to watch your words here.\"\n\n\"It's not security,\" Malone said. \"Anyhow, it's not only security. But\nthings are pretty complicated.\"\n\n\"I assure you,\" O'Connor said, \"that I will be able to understand even\nevents which you feel are complex.\"\n\nMalone swallowed again, hard. \"I didn't mean--\" he started.\n\n\"Please, Mr. Malone,\" O'Connor said. His voice was colder than usual.\nMalone had the feeling that he was about to take the extra chair away.\n\"Go on,\" O'Connor said. \"Explain yourself.\"\n\nMalone took a deep breath. He started with the facts he'd been told by\nBurris, and went straight through to the interviews of the two\ncomputer-secretary technicians by Boyd and Company.\n\nIt took quite awhile. By the time he had finished, O'Connor wasn't\nlooking frozen any more; he'd apparently forgotten to keep the freezer\ncoils running. Instead, his face showed frank bewilderment, and great\ninterest. \"I never heard of such a thing,\" he said. \"Never. Not at any\ntime.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\nO'Connor shook his head. \"I have never heard of a psionic\nmanifestation on that order,\" he said. It seemed to be a painful\nadmission. \"Something that would make a random group of men co-operate\nin that manner--why, it's completely new.\"\n\n\"It is?\" Malone said, wondering if, when it was all investigated and\ndescribed, it might be called O'Connorizing. Then he wondered how\nanybody was going to go about investigating it and describing it, and\nsank even deeper into gloom.\n\n\"Completely new,\" O'Connor said. \"You may take my word.\" Then, slowly,\nhe began to brighten again, with all the glitter of newly-formed ice.\n\"As a matter of fact,\" he said, in a tone more like his usual one, \"as\na matter of fact, Mr. Malone, I don't think it's possible.\"\n\n\"But it happened,\" Malone said. \"It's still happening. All over.\"\n\nO'Connor's lips tightened. \"I have given my opinion,\" he said. \"I do\nnot believe that such a thing is possible. There must be some other\nexplanation.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said agreeably. \"I'll bite. What is it?\"\n\nO'Connor frowned. \"Your levity,\" he said, \"is uncalled-for.\"\n\nMalone shrugged. \"I didn't mean to be--\" He paused. \"Anyhow, I didn't\nmean to be funny,\" he went on. \"But I would like to have another idea\nof what's causing all this.\"\n\n\"Scientific theories,\" O'Connor said sternly, \"are not invented on the\nspur of the moment. Only after long, careful thought.\"\n\n\"You mean you can't think of anything,\" Malone said.\n\n\"There must be some other explanation,\" O'Connor said. \"Naturally,\nsince the facts have only now been presented to me, it is impossible\nfor me to display at once a fully-constructed theory.\"\n\nMalone nodded slowly. \"Okay,\" he said. \"Have you got any hints, then?\nAny ideas at all?\"\n\nO'Connor shook his head. \"I have not,\" he said. \"But I strongly\nsuggest, Mr. Malone, that you recheck your data. The fault may very\nwell lie in your own interpretations of the actual facts.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Malone said.\n\nO'Connor grimaced. \"I do,\" he said firmly.\n\nMalone sighed, very faintly. He shifted in the chair and began to\nrealize, for the first time, just how uncomfortable it really was. He\nalso felt a little chilly, and the chill was growing. That, he told\nhimself, was the effect of Dr. O'Connor. He no longer regretted\nwearing his hat. As a matter of fact, he thought wistfully for a\nsecond of a small, light overcoat.\n\nO'Connor, he told himself, was definitely not the warm, friendly type.\n\n\"Well, then,\" he said, conquering the chilly feeling for a second,\n\"maybe there's somebody else. Somebody who knows something more about\npsionics, and who might have some other ideas about--\"\n\n\"Please, Mr. Malone,\" O'Connor said. \"The United States Government\nwould hardly have chosen me had I not been uniquely qualified in my\nfield.\"\n\nMalone sighed again. \"I mean, maybe there are some books on the\nsubject,\" he said quietly, hoping he sounded tactful. \"Maybe there's\nsomething I could look up.\"\n\n\"Mr. Malone.\" The temperature of the office, Malone realized, was\ndefinitely lowering. O'Connor's built-in freezer coils were working\novertime, he told himself. \"The field of psionics is so young that I\ncan say, without qualification, that I am acquainted with everything\nwritten on the subject. By that, of course, I mean scientific works. I\ndo not doubt that the American Society for Psychical Research, for\ninstance, has hundreds of crackpot books which I have never read, or\neven heard of. But in the strictly scientific field, I must say\nthat--\"\n\nHe broke off, looking narrowly at Malone with what might have been\nconcern, but looked more like discouragement and boredom.\n\n\"Mr. Malone,\" he said, \"are you ill?\"\n\nMalone thought about it. He wasn't quite sure, he discovered. The\nchill in the office was bothering him more and more, and as it grew he\nbegan to doubt that it was all due to the O'Connor influence. Suddenly\na distinct shudder started somewhere in the vicinity of his shoulders\nand rippled its way down his body.\n\nAnother one followed it, and then a third.\n\n\"Mr. Malone,\" O'Connor said.\n\n\"Me?\" Malone said. \"I'm--I'm all right.\"\n\n\"You seem to have contracted a chill,\" O'Connor said.\n\nA fourth shudder followed the other three.\n\n\"I--guess so,\" Malone said. \"I d-d--I do s-seem to be r-r-rather\nchilly.\"\n\nO'Connor nodded. \"Ah,\" he said. \"I thought so. Although a chill is\ncertainly odd at seventy-two degrees Fahrenheit.\" He looked at the\nthermometer just outside the window of his office, then turned back to\nMalone. \"Pardon me,\" he said. \"Seventy-one point six.\"\n\n\"Is--is that all it is?\" Malone said. Seventy-one point six degrees,\nor even seventy-two, hardly sounded like the broiling Nevada desert\nhe'd expected.\n\n\"Of course,\" O'Connor said. \"At nine o'clock in the morning, one would\nhardly expect great temperatures. The desert becomes quite hot during\nthe day, but cools off rapidly; I assume you are familiar with the\nlaws covering the system.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"S-sure.\"\n\nThe chills were not getting any better. They continued to travel up\nand down his body with the dignified regularity of Pennsylvania\nRailroad commuter trains.\n\nO'Connor frowned for a second. It was obvious that his keen scientific\neye was sizing up the phenomenon, and reporting events to his keen\nscientific brain. In a second or less, the keen scientific brain had\ncome up with an answer, and Dr. O'Connor spoke in his very keenest\nscientific voice.\n\n\"I should have warned you,\" he said, without an audible trace of\nregret. \"The answer is childishly simple, Mr. Malone. You left\nWashington at noon.\"\n\n\"Just a little before noon,\" Malone said. Remembering the burning sun,\nhe added: \"High noon. Very high.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" O'Connor said. \"And not only the heat was intense; the\nhumidity, I assume, was also high.\"\n\n\"Very,\" Malone said, thinking back. He shivered again.\n\n\"In Washington,\" O'Connor said, \"it was noon. Here it is nine o'clock,\nand hardly as warm. The atmosphere is quite arid, and about twenty\ndegrees below that obtaining in Washington.\"\n\nMalone thought about it, trying to ignore the chills. \"Oh,\" he said at\nlast. \"And all the time I thought it was you.\"\n\n\"What?\" O'Connor leaned forward.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Malone said hastily. \"Nothing at all.\"\n\n\"My suggestion,\" O'Connor said, putting his fingertips together again,\n\"is that you take off your clothes, which are undoubtedly damp, and--\"\n\nNaturally, Malone had not brought any clothes to Yucca Flats to change\ninto. And when he tried to picture himself in a spare suit of Dr.\nO'Connor's, the picture just wouldn't come. Besides, the idea of doing\na modified striptease in, or near, the O'Connor office was thoroughly\nunattractive.\n\n\"Well,\" he said slowly, \"thanks a lot, Doctor, but no thanks. I really\nhave a better idea.\"\n\n\"Better?\" O'Connor said.\n\n\"Well, I--\" Malone took a deep breath and shut his eyes.\n\nHe heard Dr. O'Connor say: \"Well, Mr. Malone, goodbye. And good luck.\"\n\nThen the office in Yucca Flats was gone, and Malone was standing in\nthe bedroom of his own apartment, on the fringes of Washington, D.C.\n\n\n4\n\nHe walked over to the wall control and shut off the air-conditioning\nin a hurry. He threw open a window and breathed great gulps of the\nhot, humid air from the streets. In a small corner at the back of his\nmind, he wondered why he was grateful for the air he had suffered\nunder only a few minutes before. But that, he reflected, was life. And\na very silly kind of life, too, he told himself without rancor.\n\nIn a few minutes he left the window, somewhat restored, and headed for\nthe shower. When it was running nicely and he was under it, he started\nto sing. But his voice didn't sound as much like the voice of Lauritz\nMelchior as it usually did, not even when he made a brave, if\nfoolhardy stab at the Melchior accent. Slowly, he began to realize\nthat he was bothered.\n\nHe climbed out of the shower and started drying himself. Up to now, he\nthought, he had depended on Dr. Thomas O'Connor for edifying,\ntrustworthy and reasonably complete information about psionics and\n_psi_ phenomena in general. He had looked on O'Connor as a sort of\nliving version of an extremely good edition of the Britannica, always\navailable for reference.\n\nAnd now O'Connor had failed him. That, Malone thought, was hardly\nfair. O'Connor had no business failing him, particularly when there\nwas no place else to go.\n\nThe scientist had been right, of course, Malone knew. There was no\nother scientist who knew as much about psionics as O'Connor, and if\nO'Connor said there were no books, then that was that: there were no\nbooks.\n\nHe reached for a drawer in his dresser, opened it and pulled out some\nunderclothes, humming tunelessly under his breath as he dressed. If\nthere was no one to ask, he thought, and if there were no books...\n\nHe stopped with a sock in his hand, and stared at it in wonder.\nO'Connor hadn't said there were no books. As a matter of fact, Malone\nrealized, he'd said exactly the opposite.\n\nThere were books. But they were \"crackpot\" books. O'Connor had never\nread them. He had, he said, probably never even heard of many of them.\n\n\"Crackpot\" was a fighting word to O'Connor. But to Malone it had all\nthe sweetness of flattery. After all, he'd found telepaths in insane\nasylums, and teleports among the juvenile delinquents of New York.\n\"Crackpot\" was a word that was rapidly ceasing to have any meaning at\nall in Malone's mind.\n\nHe realized that he was still staring at the sock, which was black\nwith a pink clock. Hurriedly, he put it on, and finished dressing. He\nreached for the phone and made a few fast calls, and then teleported\nhimself to his locked office in FBI Headquarters, on East 69th Street\nin New York. He let himself out, and strolled down the corridor. The\nagent-in-charge looked up from his desk as Malone passed, blinked, and\nsaid, \"Hello, Malone. What's up now?\"\n\n\"I'm going prowling,\" Malone said. \"But there won't be any work for\nyou, as far as I can see.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"Just relax,\" Malone said. \"Breathe easy.\"\n\n\"I'll try to,\" the agent-in-charge said, a little sadly. \"But every\ntime you show up, I think about that wave of red Cadillacs you\nstarted. I'll never feel really secure again.\"\n\n\"Relax,\" Malone said. \"Next time it won't be Cadillacs. But it might\nbe spirits, blowing on ear-trumpets. Or whatever it is they do.\"\n\n\"Spirits, Malone?\" the agent-in-charge said.\n\n\"No, thanks,\" Malone said sternly. \"I never drink on duty.\" He gave\nthe agent a cheery wave of his hand and went on out to the street.\n\nThe Psychical Research Society had offices in the Ravell Building, a\nlarge structure composed mostly of plate glass and anodized aluminum\nthat looked just a little like a bright blue transparent crackerbox\nthat had been stood on end for purposes unknown. Having walked all the\nway down to this box on 56th Street, Malone had recovered his former\nsensitivity range to temperature and felt pathetically grateful for\nthe coolish sea breeze that made New York somewhat less of an\nunbearable Summer Festival than was normal.\n\nThe lobby of the building was glittering and polished, as if human\nbeings could not possibly exist in it. Malone took an elevator to the\nsixth floor, stepped out into a small, equally polished hall, and\nhurriedly looked off to his right. A small door stood there, with a\nlegend engraved in elegantly small letters. It said:\n\n     _The Psychical Research Society_\n                  _Push_\n\nMalone obeyed instructions. The door swung noiselessly open, and then\nclosed behind him.\n\nHe was in a large square-looking room which had a couch and chair set\nat one corner, and a desk at the far end. Behind the desk was a brass\nplate, on which was engraved:\n\n     _The Psychical Research Society_\n               _Main Offices_\n\nTo Malone's left was a hall that angled off into invisibility, and to\nthe left of the desk was another one, going straight back past doors\nand two radiators until it ran into a right-angled turn and also\ndisappeared.\n\nMalone took in the details of his surroundings almost automatically,\nfiling them in his memory just in case he ever needed to use them.\n\nOne detail, however, required more than automatic attention. Sitting\nbehind the desk, her head just below the brass plaque, was a redhead.\nShe was, Malone thought, positively beautiful. Of course, he could not\nsee the lower two-thirds of her body, but if they were half as\ninteresting as the upper third and the face and head, he was willing\nto spend days, weeks or even months on their investigation. Some jobs,\nhe told himself, feeling a strong sense of duty, were definitely worth\ntaking time over.\n\nShe was turned slightly away from Malone, and had obviously not heard\nhim come in. Malone wondered how best to announce himself, and\nregretfully gave up the idea of tiptoeing up to the girl, placing his\nhands over her eyes, kissing the back of her neck and crying:\n\"Surprise!\" It was elegant, he felt, but it just wasn't _right_.\n\nHe compromised at last on the old established method of\nthroat-clearing to attract her attention. He was sure he could take it\nfrom there, to an eminently satisfying conclusion.\n\nHe tiptoed on the deep-pile rug right up to her desk. He took a deep\nbreath.\n\nAnd the expected happened.\n\nHe sneezed.\n\nThe sneeze was loud and long, and it echoed through the room and\nthroughout the corridors. It sounded to Malone like the blast of a\nsmall bomb, or possibly a grenade. Startled himself by the volume of\nsound he had managed to generate, he jumped back.\n\nThe girl had jumped, too, but her leap had been straight upward, about\nan inch and a half. She came down on her chair and reached up a hand.\nThe hand wiped the back of her neck with a slow, lingering motion of\ncomplete loathing. Then, equally slowly, she turned.\n\n\"That,\" she said in a low, sweet voice, \"was a hell of a dirty trick.\"\n\n\"It was an accident,\" Malone said. \"The Will of God.\"\n\n\"God has an exceedingly nasty mind,\" the girl said. \"Something, by the\nway, which I have often suspected.\" She regarded Malone darkly. \"Do\nyou always do that to strangers? Is it some new sort of perversion?\"\n\n\"I have never done such a thing before,\" Malone said sternly.\n\n\"Oh,\" the girl said. \"An experimenter. Avid for new sensations.\nProbably a jaded scion of a rich New York family.\" She paused. \"Tell\nme,\" she said, \"is it fun?\"\n\nMalone opened his mouth, but nothing came out. He shut it, thought for\na second and then tried again. He got as far as: \"I--\" before Nemesis\novertook him. The second sneeze was even louder and more powerful than\nthe first had been.\n\n\"It must be fun,\" the girl said acidly, producing a handkerchief from\nsomewhere and going to work on her face. \"You just can't seem to wait\nto do it again. Would it do any good to tell you that the fascination\nwith this form of greeting is not universal? Or don't you care?\"\n\n\"Damn it,\" Malone said, goaded, \"I've got a cold.\"\n\n\"And you feel you should share it with the world,\" the girl said. \"I\nquite understand. Tell me, is there anything I can do for you? Or has\nyour mission been accomplished?\"\n\n\"My mission?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Having sneezed twice at me,\" the girl said, \"do you feel satisfied?\nWill you vanish softly and silently away? Or do you want to sneeze at\nsomebody else?\"\n\n\"I want the president of the Society,\" Malone said. \"According to my\ninformation, his name is Sir Lewis Carter.\"\n\n\"And if you sneeze at him,\" the girl said, \"yours is going to be mud.\nHe isn't much on novelty.\"\n\n\"I--\"\n\n\"Besides which,\" she said, \"he's extremely busy. And I don't think\nhe'll see you at all. Why don't you go and sneeze at somebody else?\nThere must be lots of people who would consider themselves honored to\nbe noticed, especially in such a startling way. Why don't you try and\nfind one somewhere? Somewhere very far away.\"\n\nMalone was beyond speech. He fumbled for his wallet, flipped it open\nand showed the girl his identification.\n\n\"My, my,\" she said. \"And hasn't the FBI anything better to do? I mean,\ncan't you go and sneeze at counterfeiters in their lairs, or wherever\nthey might be?\"\n\n\"I want to see Sir Lewis Carter,\" Malone said doggedly.\n\nThe girl shrugged and picked up the phone on the desk. It was a\nblank-vision device, of course; many office intercoms were. She\ndialed, waited and then said, \"Sir Lewis, please.\" Another second went\nby. Then she spoke again. \"Sir Lewis,\" she said, \"this is Lou, at the\nfront desk. There's a man here named Malone, who wants to see you.\"\n\nShe waited a second. \"I don't know what he wants,\" she told the phone.\n\"But he's from the FBI.\" A second's pause. \"That's right, the FBI,\"\nshe said. \"All right, Sir Lewis. Right away.\" She hung up the phone\nand turned to watch Malone warily.\n\n\"Sir Lewis,\" she said, \"will see you. I couldn't say why. But take the\nside corridor to the rear of the suite. His office has his name on it,\nand I won't tell you you can't miss it because I have every faith that\nyou will. Good luck.\"\n\nMalone blinked. \"Look,\" he said. \"I know I startled you, but I didn't\nmean to. I--\" He started to sneeze, but this time he got his own\nhandkerchief out in time and muffled the explosion slightly.\n\n\"Good work,\" the girl said approvingly. \"Tell me, Mr. Malone, have you\nbeen toilet-trained, too?\"\n\nThere was nothing at all to say to that remark, Malone reflected as he\nwended his way down the side corridor. It seemed endless, and kept\nbranching off unexpectedly. Once he blundered into a large open room\nfilled with people at desks. A woman who seemed to have a great many\nteeth and rather bulbous eyes looked up at him. \"Can I help you?\" she\nsaid in a fervent whine.\n\n\"I sincerely hope not,\" Malone said, backing away and managing to find\nthe corridor once more. After what seemed like a long time, and two\nmore sneezes, he found a small door which was labeled in capital\nletters:\n\n     THE PSYCHICAL RESEARCH SOCIETY\n             SIR LEWIS CARTER\n                PRESIDENT\n\nMalone sighed. \"Well,\" he muttered, \"they certainly aren't hiding\nanything.\" He pushed at the door, and it swung open.\n\nSir Lewis was a tall, solidly-built man with a kindly expression. He\nwore grey flannel trousers and a brown tweed jacket, which made an\ninteresting color contrast with his iron-grey hair. His teeth were\nclenched so firmly on the bit of a calabash pipe with a meerschaum\nbowl that Malone wondered if he could ever get loose. Malone shut the\ndoor behind him, and Sir Lewis rose and extended a hand.\n\nMalone went to the desk and reached across to take the hand. It was\nfirm and dry. \"I'm Kenneth Malone,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" Sir Lewis said. \"Pleased to meet you. Always happy, of\ncourse, to do whatever I can for your FBI. Not only a duty, so to\nspeak, but a pleasure. Sit down. Please do sit down.\"\n\nMalone found a chair at the side of the desk, and sank into it. It was\nsoft and comfortable. It provided such a contrast to O'Connor's\nfurnishings that Malone began to wish it was Sir Lewis who was\nemployed at Yucca Flats. Then he could tell Sir Lewis everything about\nthe case.\n\nNow, of course, he could only hedge and try to make do without stating\nvery many facts. \"Sir Lewis,\" he said, \"I trust you'll keep this\nconversation confidential.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" Sir Lewis said. He removed the pipe, stared at it, and\nreplaced it.\n\n\"I can't give you the full details,\" Malone went on, \"but the FBI is\npresently engaged in an investigation which requires the specialized\nknowledge your organization seems to have.\"\n\n\"FBI?\" Sir Lewis said. \"Specialized investigation?\" He seemed pleased,\nbut a trifle puzzled. \"Dear boy, anything we have is at your disposal,\nof course. But I quite fail to see how you can consider us--\"\n\n\"It's rather an unusual problem,\" Malone said, feeling that that was\nthe understatement of the year. \"But I understand that your records go\nback nearly a century.\"\n\n\"Quite true,\" Sir Lewis murmured.\n\n\"During that time,\" Malone said, \"the Society investigated a great\nmany supposedly supernatural or supernormal incidents.\"\n\n\"Many of them,\" Sir Lewis said, \"were discovered to be fraudulent, I'm\nafraid. The great majority, in fact.\"\n\n\"That's what I'd assume,\" Malone said. He fished in his pockets, found\na cigarette and lit it. Sir Lewis went on chewing at his unlit pipe.\n\"What we're interested in,\" Malone said, \"is some description of the\nvarious methods by which these frauds were perpetrated.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Sir Lewis said. \"The tricks of the trade, so to speak?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Well, then,\" Sir Lewis said. \"The luminous gauze, for instance, that\npasses for ectoplasm; the various methods of table-lifting; control of\nthe Ouija board--things like that?\"\n\n\"Not quite that elementary,\" Malone said. He puffed on the cigarette,\nwishing it was a cigar. \"We're pretty much up to that kind of thing.\nBut had it ever occurred to you that many of the methods used by phony\nmind-reading acts, for instance, might be used as communication\nmethods by spies?\"\n\n\"Why, I believe some have been,\" Sir Lewis said. \"Though I don't know\nmuch about that, of course; there was a case during the First World\nWar--\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Malone said. He took a deep breath. \"It's things like that\nwe're interested in,\" he said, and spent the next twenty minutes\nslowly approaching his subject. Sir Lewis, apparently fascinated, was\nperfectly willing to unbend in any direction, and jotted down notes on\nsome of Malone's more interesting cases, murmuring: \"Most unusual,\nmost unusual,\" as he wrote.\n\nThe various types of phenomena that the Society had investigated came\ninto the discussion, and Malone heard quite a lot about the Beyond,\nthe Great Summerland, Spirit Mediums and the hypothetical existence of\nfairies, goblins and elves.\n\n\"But, Sir Lewis--\" he said.\n\n\"I make no claims personally,\" Sir Lewis said. \"But I understand that\nthere is a large and somewhat vocal group which does make rather\nsolid-sounding claims in that direction. They say that they have seen\nfairies, talked with goblins, danced with the elves.\"\n\n\"They must be very unusual people,\" Malone said, understating heavily.\n\n\"Oh,\" Sir Lewis said, without a trace of irony, \"they certainly are.\"\n\nTalk like this passed away nearly a half-hour, until Malone finally\nfelt that it was the right time to introduce some of his real\nquestions. \"Tell me, Sir Lewis,\" he said. \"Have you had many instances\nof a single man, or a small group of men, controlling the actions of a\nmuch larger group? And doing it in such a way that the larger group\ndoesn't even know it is being manipulated?\"\n\n\"Of course I have,\" Sir Lewis said. \"And so have you. They call it\nadvertising.\"\n\nMalone flicked his cigarette into an ashtray. \"I didn't mean exactly\nthat,\" he said. \"Suppose they're doing it in such a way that the\nlarger group doesn't even suspect that manipulation is going on?\"\n\nSir Lewis removed his pipe and frowned at it. \"I may be able to give\nyou a little information,\" he said slowly, \"but not much.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" Malone said, trying to sound only mildly interested.\n\n\"Outside of mob psychology,\" Sir Lewis said, \"and all that sort of\nthing, I really haven't seen any record of a case of such a thing\nhappening. And I can't quite imagine anyone faking it.\"\n\n\"But you have got some information?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Certainly,\" Sir Lewis said. \"There is always spirit control.\"\n\n\"Spirit control?\" Malone blinked.\n\n\"Demoniac intervention,\" Sir Lewis said. \"'My name is Legion,' you\nknow.\"\n\nSir Lewis Legion, Malone thought confusedly, was a rather unusual\nname. He took a breath and caught hold of his revolving mind. \"How\nwould you go about that?\" he said, a little hopelessly.\n\n\"I haven't the foggiest,\" Sir Lewis admitted cheerfully. \"But I will\nhave it looked up for you.\" He made a note. \"Anything else?\"\n\nMalone tried to think. \"Yes,\" he said at last. \"Can you give me a\ncondensed report on what is known--and I mean _known_--on telepathy\nand teleportation?\"\n\n\"What you want,\" Sir Lewis said, \"are those cases proven genuine, not\nthe ones in which we have established fraud, or those still in doubt.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" Malone said. If he got no other use out of the data, it\nwould provide a measuring-stick for the Society. The general public\ndidn't know that the Government was actually using psionic powers, and\nthe Society's theories, checked against actual fact, would provide a\nrough index of reliability to use on the Society's other data.\n\nBut spirits, somehow, didn't seem very likely. Malone sighed and stood\nup.\n\n\"I'll have copies made of all the relevant material,\" Sir Lewis said,\n\"from our library and research files. Where do you want the material\nsent? I do want to warn you of its bulk; there may be quite a lot of\nit.\"\n\n\"FBI Headquarters, on 69th Street,\" Malone said. \"And send a statement\nof expenses along with it. As long as the bill's within reason, don't\nworry about itemizing; I'll see that it goes through Accounting\nmyself.\"\n\nSir Lewis nodded. \"Fine,\" he said. \"And, if you should have any\ndifficulties with the material, please let me know. I'll always be\nglad to help.\"\n\n\"Thanks for your co-operation,\" Malone said. He went to the door, and\nwalked on out.\n\nHe blundered back into the same big room again, on his way through the\ncorridors. The bulbous-eyed woman, who seemed to have inherited a full\nset of thirty-two teeth from each of her parents, gave him a friendly\nif somewhat crowded smile, but Malone pressed on without a word. After\nawhile, he found the reception room again.\n\nThe girl behind the desk looked up. \"How did he react?\" she said.\n\nMalone blinked. \"React?\" he said.\n\n\"When you sneezed at him,\" she said. \"Because I've been thinking it\nover, and I've got a new theory. You're doing a survey on how people\nact when encountering sneezes. Like Kinsey.\"\n\nThis girl--Lou something, Malone thought, and with difficulty\nrefrained from adding \"Gehrig\"--had an unusual effect, he decided. He\nwondered if there were anyone in the world she couldn't reduce to\nparalyzed silence.\n\n\"Of course,\" she went on, \"Kinsey was dealing with sex, and you\naren't. At least, you aren't during business hours.\" She smiled\npolitely at Malone.\n\n\"No,\" he said helplessly, \"I'm not.\"\n\n\"It is sneezing, then,\" she said. \"Will I be in the book when it's\npublished?\"\n\n\"Book?\" Malone said, feeling more and more like a rather low-grade\nmoron.\n\n\"The book on sneezing, when you get it published,\" she said. \"I can\nsee it now: _The Case of Miss X, a Receptionist_.\"\n\n\"There isn't going to be any book,\" Malone said.\n\nShe shook her head. \"That's a shame,\" she said. \"I've always wanted to\nbe a Miss X. It sounds exciting.\"\n\n\"X,\" Malone said at random, \"marks the spot.\"\n\n\"Why, that's the sweetest thing that's been said to me all day,\" the\ngirl said. \"I thought you could hardly talk, and here you come out\nwith lovely things like that. But I'll bet you say it to all the\ngirls.\"\n\n\"I have never said it to anybody before,\" Malone said flatly. \"And I\nnever will again.\"\n\nThe girl sighed. \"I'll treasure it,\" she said. \"My one great moment.\nGoodbye, Mr.--Malone, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Ken,\" Malone said. \"Just call me Ken.\"\n\n\"And I'm Lou,\" the girl said. \"Goodbye.\"\n\nAn elevator arrived and Malone ducked into it. Louie? he thought.\nLouise? Luke? Of course, there was Sir Lewis Carter, who might be\ncalled Lou. Was he related to the girl?\n\nNo, Malone thought wildly. Relations went by last names. There was no\nreason for Lou to be related to Sir Lewis. They didn't even look\nalike. For instance, he had no desire whatever to make a date with Sir\nLewis Carter, or to take him to a glittering nightclub, or to make him\nany whispered propositions. And the very idea of Sir Lewis Carter\nsitting on the Malone lap was enough to give him indigestion and spots\nbefore the eyes.\n\nSternly, he told himself to get back to business. The elevator stopped\nat the lobby and he got out and started down the street, feeling that\nconsideration of the lady known as Lou was much more pleasant. After\nall, what did he have to work with, as far as his job was concerned?\n\nSo far, two experts had told him that his theory was full of lovely\nlittle holes. Worse than that, they had told him that mass control of\nhuman beings was impossible, as far as they knew.\n\nAnd maybe it was impossible, he told himself sadly. Maybe he should\njust junk his whole theory and think up a new one. Maybe there was no\npsionics involved in the thing at all, and Boyd and O'Connor were\nright.\n\nOf course, he had a deep-seated conviction that psionics was somewhere\nat the root of everything, but that didn't necessarily mean anything.\nA lot of people had deep-seated convictions that they were beetles, or\nthat the world was flat And then again, murderers often suffered as a\nresult of deep-seated convictions of one sort or another.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he had invented a whole new psionic theory\nor, at least, observed some new psionic facts. Maybe they would call\nthe results Malonizing, instead of O'Connorizing. He tried to picture\na man opening a door and saying: \"Come out quick, Mr. Frembits is\nMalonizing again.\"\n\nIt didn't sound very plausible. But, after all, he did have a\ndeep-seated conviction. He tried to think of a shallow-seated\nconviction, and failed. Didn't convictions ever stand up, anyhow, or\nlie down?\n\nHe shook his head, discovered that he was on 69th Street, and headed\nfor the FBI Headquarters. His convictions, he had found, were\nsometimes an expression of his precognitive powers; he determined to\nride with them, at least for awhile.\n\nBy the time he came to the office of the agent-in-charge, he had\nfigured out the beginnings of a new line of attack.\n\n\"How about the ghosts?\" the agent-in-charge asked as he passed.\n\n\"They'll be along,\" Malone said. \"In a big bundle, addressed to me\npersonally. And don't open the bundle.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" the agent-in-charge asked.\n\n\"Because I don't want the things to get loose and run around saying\nboo to everybody,\" Malone said brightly, and went on.\n\nHe opened the door of his private office, went inside and sat down at\nthe desk there. He took his time about framing a thought, a single,\nclear, deliberate thought:\n\n_Your Majesty, I'd like to speak to you._\n\nHe hardly had time to finish it. A flash of color appeared in the\nroom, just a few feet from his desk. The flash resolved itself into a\ntiny, grandmotherly-looking woman with a coronal of white hair and a\nkindly, twinkling expression. She was dressed in the full court\ncostume of the First Elizabethan period, and this was hardly\nsurprising to Malone. The little old lady believed, quite firmly, that\nshe was Queen Elizabeth I, miraculously preserved over all these\ncenturies. Malone, himself, had practically forgotten that the woman's\nreal name was Rose Thompson, and that she had only been alive for\nsixty-five years or so. For most of that time, she had been insane.\n\nFor all of that time, however, she had been a genuine telepath. She\nhad been discovered during the course of Malone's first psionic case,\nand by now she had even learned to teleport by \"reading\" the process\nin Malone's mind.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Sir Kenneth,\" she said in a regal, kindly voice. She\nwas mad, he knew, but her delusion was nicely kept within bounds. All\nof her bright world hinged on the single fact that she was unshakably\ncertain of her royalty. As long as the FBI catered to that notion--\nwhich included a Royal dwelling for her in Yucca Flats, and the\nprivilege of occasionally knighting FBI agents who had pleased her\nunpredictable fancy--she was perfectly rational on all other points.\nShe co-operated with Dr. O'Connor and with the FBI in the\ninvestigation of her psionic powers, and she had given her Royal word\nnot to teleport except at Malone's personal request.\n\n\"I'd like to talk to you,\" Malone said, \"Your Majesty.\"\n\nThere was an odd note in the Queen's voice, and an odd, haunted\nexpression on her face. \"I've been hoping you'd ask me to come,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"I had a hunch you were following me telepathically,\" Malone said.\n\"Can you give me any help?\"\n\n\"I--I really don't know,\" she said. \"It's something new, and something\ndisturbing. I've never come across anything like it before.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" Malone asked.\n\n\"It's the--\" She made a gesture that conveyed nothing at all to\nMalone. \"The--the static,\" she said at last.\n\nMalone blinked. \"Static?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"You're not telepathic, so I can't tell you what it's\nreally like. But--well, Sir Kenneth, have you ever seen disturbance on\na TV screen, when there's some powerful electric output nearby? The\nbright, senseless snowstorms, the meaningless hash?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said.\n\n\"It's like that,\" she said. \"It's a sudden, meaningless, disturbing\nblare of telepathic energy.\"\n\nThe telephone rang once. Malone ignored it.\n\n\"What's causing these disturbances?\" he asked.\n\nShe shook her head. \"I don't know, Sir Kenneth. I don't know,\" she\nsaid. \"I can't pick up a person's mind over a distance unless I know\nhim, and I can't see what's causing this at all. It's--frankly, Sir\nKenneth, it's rather terrifying.\"\n\nThe phone rang again.\n\n\"How long have you been experiencing this disturbance?\" Malone asked.\nHe looked at the phone.\n\n\"The telephone isn't important,\" Her Majesty said. \"It's only Sir\nThomas, calling to tell you he's arrested three spies, and that\ndoesn't matter at all.\"\n\n\"It doesn't?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Her Majesty said. \"What does matter is that I've only\nbeen picking up these flashes since you were assigned to this new\ncase, Sir Kenneth. And...\" She paused.\n\n\"Well?\" Malone said.\n\n\"And they only appear,\" Her Majesty said, \"when I'm tuned to _your_\nmind!\"\n\n\n5\n\nMalone stared. He tried to say something but he couldn't find any\nwords. The telephone rang again and he pushed the switch with a sense\nof relief. The beard-fringed face of Thomas Boyd appeared on the\nscreen.\n\n\"You're getting hard to find,\" Boyd said. \"I think you're letting fame\nand fortune go to your head.\"\n\n\"I left word at the office that I was coming here,\" Malone said\naggrievedly.\n\n\"Sure you did,\" Boyd said. \"How do you think I found you? Am I\ntelepathic? Do I have strange powers?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't surprise me in the least,\" Malone said. \"Now, about those\nspies--\"\n\n\"See what I mean?\" Boyd said. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\"Just lucky, I guess,\" Malone murmured. \"But what about them?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Boyd said, \"we picked up two men working in the Senate Office\nBuilding, and another one working for the State Department.\"\n\n\"And they are spies?\" Malone said. \"Real spies?\"\n\n\"Oh, they're real enough,\" Boyd said. \"We've known about 'em for\nyears, and I finally decided to pick them up for questioning. God\nknows, but maybe they have something to do with all this mess that's\nbothering everybody.\"\n\n\"You haven't the faintest idea what you mean,\" Malone said. \"Mess is\nhardly the word.\"\n\nBoyd snorted. \"You go on getting yourself confused,\" he said, \"while\nsome of us do the real work. After all--\"\n\n\"Never mind the insults,\" Malone said. \"How about the spies?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Boyd said, a trifle reluctantly, \"they've been working as\njanitors and maintenance men, and of course we've made sure they\nhaven't been able to get their hands on any really valuable\ninformation.\"\n\n\"So they've suddenly turned into criminal masterminds,\" Malone said.\n\"After being under careful surveillance for years.\"\n\n\"Well, it's possible,\" Boyd said defensively.\n\n\"Almost anything is possible,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Some things,\" Boyd said carefully, \"are more possible than others.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Charles W. Aristotle,\" Malone said. \"I hope you realize\nwhat you've done, picking up those three men. We might have been able\nto get some good lines on them, if you'd left them where they were.\"\n\nThere is an old story about a general who went on an inspection tour\nof the front during World War I, and, putting his head incautiously up\nout of a trench, was narrowly missed by a sniper's bullet. He turned\nto a nearby sergeant and bellowed: \"Get that sniper!\"\n\n\"Oh, we've got him spotted, sir,\" the sergeant said. \"He's been there\nfor six days now.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" the general said, \"why don't you blast him out of\nthere?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, it's this way,\" the sergeant explained. \"He's fired about\nsixty rounds since he's been out there, and he hasn't hit anything\nyet. We're afraid if we get rid of him they'll put up somebody who\n_can_ shoot.\"\n\nThis was standard FBI policy when dealing with minor spies. A great\nmany had been spotted, including four in the Department of Fisheries.\nBut known spies are easier to keep track of than unknown ones. And, as\nlong as they're allowed to think they haven't been spotted, they may\nlead the way to other spies or spy networks.\n\n\"I thought it was worth the risk,\" Boyd said. \"After all, if they have\nsomething to do with the case--\"\n\n\"But they don't,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Damn it,\" Boyd exploded, \"let me find out for myself, will you?\nYou're spoiling all the fun.\"\n\n\"Well, anyhow,\" Malone said, \"they don't.\"\n\n\"You can't afford to take any chances,\" Boyd said. \"After all, when I\nthink about William Logan, I tell myself we'd better take care of\nevery lead.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said finally, \"you may be right. And then again, you\nmay be normally wrong.\"\n\n\"What is that supposed to mean?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"How should I know?\" Malone said. \"I'm too busy to go around and\naround like this. But since you've picked the spies up, I suppose it\nwon't do any harm to find out if they know anything.\"\n\nBoyd snorted again. \"Thank you,\" he said, \"for your kind permission.\"\n\n\"I'll be right down,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I'll be waiting,\" Boyd said. \"In Interrogation Room 7. You'll\nrecognize me by the bullet hole in my forehead and the strange South\nAmerican poison, hitherto unknown to science, in my esophagus.\"\n\n\"Very funny,\" Malone said. \"Don't give up the ship.\"\n\nBoyd switched off without a word. Malone shrugged at the blank screen\nand pushed his own switch. Then he turned slowly back to Her Majesty,\nwho was standing, waiting patiently, at the opposite side of the desk.\nInterference, he thought, located around him...\n\n\"Why yes,\" she said. \"That's exactly what I did say.\"\n\nMalone blinked. \"Your Majesty,\" he said, \"would you mind terribly if I\nasked you questions before you answered them? I know you can see them\nin my mind, but it's simpler for me to do things the normal way, just\nnow.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said sincerely. \"I do agree that matters are confused\nenough already. Please go on.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Your Majesty,\" Malone said. \"Well, then. Do you mean that\n_I'm_ the one causing all this mental static?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she said. \"Not at all. It's definitely coming from somewhere\nelse, and it's beamed at you, or beamed around you.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"It's just that I can only pick it up when I'm tuned to your mind,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"Like now?\" Malone said.\n\nShe shook her head. \"Right now,\" she said, \"there isn't any. It only\nhappens every once in awhile, every so often, and not continuously.\"\n\n\"Does it happen at regular intervals?\" Malone asked.\n\n\"Not as far as I've been able to tell,\" Her Majesty said. \"It just\nhappens, that's all. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to\nit. Except that it did start when you were assigned to this case.\"\n\n\"Lovely,\" Malone said. \"Perfectly lovely. And what is it supposed to\nmean?\"\n\n\"Interference,\" she said. \"Static. Jumble. That's all it means. I just\ndon't know any more than that, Sir Kenneth; I've never experienced\nanything like it in my life. It really does disturb me.\"\n\nThat, Malone told himself, he could believe. It must be an experience,\nhe told himself, like having someone you were looking at suddenly\ndissolve into a jumble of meaningless shapes and lights.\n\n\"That's a very good analogy,\" Her Majesty said. \"If you'll pardon me\nspeaking before you've voiced your thought.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Malone said. \"Go right ahead.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" Her Majesty said. \"The analogy you use is a good one.\nIt's just as disturbing and as meaningless as that.\"\n\n\"And you don't know what's causing it?\" Malone said.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said.\n\n\"Nor what the purpose of it is?\" he said.\n\nHer Majesty shook her head slowly. \"Sir Kenneth,\" she said, \"I don't\neven know whether or not there _is_ any purpose.\"\n\nMalone sighed deeply. Nothing in the case seemed to make any sense. It\nwasn't that there were no clues, or no information for him to work\nwith. There were a lot of clues, and there was a lot of information.\nBut nothing seemed to link up with anything else. Every new fact was a\nbright, shiny arrow pointing nowhere in particular.\n\n\"Well, then--\" he started.\n\nThe intercom buzzed. Malone jabbed ferociously at the button. \"Yes?\"\nhe said.\n\n\"The ghosts are here,\" the agent-in-charge's voice said.\n\nMalone blinked. \"What?\" he said.\n\n\"You said you were going to get some ghosts,\" the agent-in-charge\nsaid. \"From the Psychical Research Society, in a couple of large\nbundles. And they're here now. Want me to exorcise 'em for you?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said wearily. \"Just send them in to join the crowd. Got a\nmessenger?\"\n\n\"I'll send them down,\" the agent-in-charge said. \"About one minute.\"\n\nMalone nodded, realized the man couldn't see him, said: \"Fine,\" and\nswitched off. He looked at his watch. A little over half an hour had\npassed since he had left the Psychical Research Society offices. That,\nhe told himself, was efficiency.\n\nNot that the books would mean anything, he thought. They would just\ntake their places at the end of the long row of meaningless,\ndisturbing, vicious facts that cluttered up his mind. He wasn't an FBI\nagent any more; he was a clown and a failure, and he was through. He\nwas going to resign and go to South Dakota and live the life of a\nhermit. He would drink goat's milk and eat old shoes or something, and\nwhenever another human being came near he would run away and hide.\nThey would call him Old Kenneth, and people would write articles for\nmagazines about The Twentieth Century Hermit.\n\nAnd that would make him famous, he thought wearily, and the whole\ncircle would start all over again.\n\n\"Now, now, Sir Kenneth,\" Queen Elizabeth said. \"Things aren't quite\nthat bad.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, they are,\" Malone said. \"They're even worse.\"\n\n\"I'm sure we can find an answer to all your questions,\" Her Majesty\nsaid.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Even I can find an answer. But it isn't the\nright one.\"\n\n\"You can?\" Her Majesty said.\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said. \"My answer is: to hell with everything.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nMalone's Washington offices didn't look any different. He sighed and\nput the two big packages from the Psychical Research Society down on\nhis desk, and then turned to Her Majesty.\n\n\"I wanted you to teleport along with me,\" he said, \"because I need\nyour help.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"I know.\"\n\nHe blinked. \"Oh. Sure you do. But let me go over the details.\"\n\nHer Majesty waved a gracious hand. \"If you like, Sir Kenneth,\" she\nsaid.\n\nMalone nodded. \"We're going on down to Interrogation Room 7 now,\" he\nsaid. \"Next door to it, there's an observation room, with a one-way\npanel in the wall. You'll be able to see us, but we won't be able to\nsee you.\"\n\n\"I really don't require an observation panel,\" Her Majesty said. \"If I\nenter your mind, I can see through your eyes.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" Malone said. \"But the observation room was built for more\nnormal people--saving your presence, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she said.\n\n\"Now,\" Malone went on, \"I want you to watch all three of the men we're\ngoing to bring in, and dig everything you can out of their minds.\"\n\n\"Everything?\" she said.\n\n\"We don't know what might be useful,\" Malone said. \"Anything you can\nfind. And if you want any questions asked--if there's anything you\nthink I ought to ask the men, or say to them--there's a non-vision\nphone in the observation room. Just lift the receiver. That\nautomatically rings the one in the interrogation room and I'll pick it\nup. Understand?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, Sir Kenneth,\" she said.\n\n\"Okay, then,\" Malone said. \"Let's go.\" They headed for the door.\nMalone stopped as he opened it. \"And by the way,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"If you get any more of those disturbances, let me know.\"\n\n\"At once,\" Her Majesty promised.\n\nThey went on down the hall and took the elevator down to Interrogation\nRoom 7, on the lowest level. There was no particular reason for\nputting the interrogation section down there, except that it tended to\nmake prisoners more nervous. And a nervous prisoner, Malone knew, was\nvery possibly a confessing prisoner.\n\nMalone ushered Her Majesty through the unmarked door of the\nobservation chamber, made sure that the panel and phone were in\nworking order, and went out. He stepped into Interrogation Room 7\ntrying hard to look bored, businesslike and unbeatable. Boyd and four\nother agents were already there, all standing around and talking\ndesultorily in low tones. None of them looked as if they had a\nmoment's worry in their lives. It was all part of the same technique,\nof course, Malone thought. Make the prisoner feel resistance is\nuseless, and you've practically got him working for you.\n\nThe prisoner was a hulking, flabby fat man in work coveralls. He had\nblack hair that spilled all over his forehead, and tiny button eyes.\nHe was the only man in the room who was sitting down, and that was\nmeant to make him feel even more inferior and insecure. His hands were\nclasped fatly in his lap, and he was staring down at them in a\nregretful manner. None of the agents paid the slightest attention to\nhim. The general impression was that something really tough was coming\nup, but that they were in no hurry for it. They were willing to wait\nfor the third degree, it seemed, until the blacksmith had done a\nreally good job with the new spikes for the Iron Maiden.\n\nThe prisoner looked up apprehensively as Malone shut the door. Malone\npaid no attention to him, and the prisoner unclasped his hands, rubbed\nthem on his coveralls and then reclasped them in his lap. His eyes\nfell again.\n\nBoyd looked up too. \"Hello, Ken,\" he said. He tapped a sheaf of papers\non the single table in the room. Malone went over and picked them up.\n\nThey were the abbreviated condensations of three dossiers. All three\nof the men covered in the dossiers were naturalized citizens, but all\nhad come in as \"political refugees\" from Hungary, from Czechoslovakia,\nand from East Germany. Further checking had turned up the fact that\nall three were actually Russians. They had been using false names\nduring their stay in the United States, but their real ones were\nappended to the dossiers.\n\nThe fat one in the interrogation room was named Alexis Brubitsch. The\nother two, who were presumably waiting separately in other rooms, were\nIvan Borbitsch and Vasili Garbitsch. The collection sounded, to\nMalone, like a seedy musical-comedy firm of lawyers: Brubitsch,\nBorbitsch and Garbitsch. He could picture them dancing gaily across a\nstage while the strains of music followed them, waving legal forms and\ntelephones and singing away.\n\nBrubitsch did not, however, look very gay. Malone went over to him\nnow, walking slowly, and looked down. Boyd came and stood next to him.\n\n\"This is the one who won't talk, eh?\" Malone said, wondering if he\nsounded as much like Dick Tracy as he thought he did. It was a\nstandard opening, meant to make the prisoner think his fellows had\nalready confessed.\n\n\"That's him,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Mmm,\" Malone said, trying to look as if he were deciding between the\nrack and the boiling oil. Brubitsch fidgeted slightly, but he didn't\nsay anything.\n\n\"We didn't know whether we had to get this one to talk, too,\" Boyd\nsaid. \"What with the others, and all. But we did think you ought to\nhave a look at him.\" He sounded very bored. It was obvious from his\ntone that the FBI didn't care in the least if Alexis Brubitsch never\nopened his mouth again, in what was likely to be a very short\nlifetime.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, equally bored, \"we might be able to get a few\ncorroborative details.\"\n\nBrubitsch swallowed hard. Malone ignored him.\n\n\"Now, just look at him,\" Boyd said. \"He certainly doesn't _look_ like\nthe head of a spy ring, does he?\"\n\n\"Of course he doesn't,\" Malone said. \"That's probably why the Russians\nused him. They figured nobody would ever look twice at a fat slob like\nthis. Nobody would ever suspect him of being the head man.\"\n\n\"I guess you're right,\" Boyd said. He yawned, which Malone thought was\noveracting a trifle. Brubitsch saw the yawn, and one hand came up to\njerk at his collar.\n\n\"Who'd ever think,\" Malone said, \"that he plotted those killings in\nRedstone--all three of them?\"\n\n\"It is surprising,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"But, then,\" Malone said, \"we know he did. There isn't any doubt of\nthat.\"\n\nBrubitsch seemed to be turning a pale green. It was a fascinating\ncolor, unlike any other Malone had ever seen. He watched it with\ninterest.\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" Boyd said. \"We've got enough evidence from the other two\nto send this one to the chair tomorrow, if we want to.\"\n\n\"More than enough,\" Malone agreed.\n\nBrubitsch opened his mouth, shut it again and closed his eyes. His\nlips moved silently.\n\n\"Tell me,\" Boyd said conversationally, leaning down to the fat man.\n\"Did your orders on that job come from Moscow, or did you mastermind\nit all by yourself?\"\n\nBrubitsch's eyes stirred, then snapped open as if they'd been pulled\nby a string. \"Me?\" he said in a hoarse bass voice. \"I know nothing\nabout this murder. What murder? I know nothing about it.\"\n\nThere were no such murders, of course. But Malone was not ready to let\nBrubitsch know anything about that. \"Oh, the ones you shot in\nRedstone,\" he said in an offhand way.\n\n\"The what?\" Brubitsch said. \"I shot people? Never.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure you did,\" Boyd said. \"The others say you did.\"\n\nBrubitsch's head seemed to sink into his neck. \"Borbitsch and\nGarbitsch, they tell you about a murder? It is not true. Is a lie.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Malone said. \"We think it's true.\"\n\n\"Is a lie,\" Brubitsch said, his little eyes peering anxiously from\nside to side. \"Is not true,\" he went on hopefully. \"I have alibi.\"\n\n\"You do?\" Boyd said. \"For what time?\"\n\n\"For time when murder happened,\" Brubitsch said. \"I was someplace\nelse.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" Malone said, \"how do you know when the murders were\ndone? They were kept out of the newspapers.\" That, he reflected, was\nquite true, since the murders had never happened. But he watched\nBrubitsch with a wary eye.\n\n\"I know nothing about time,\" Brubitsch said, jerking at his collar. \"I\ndon't know when they happened.\"\n\n\"Then how can you have an alibi?\" Boyd snapped.\n\n\"Because I didn't do them!\" Brubitsch said tearfully. \"If I didn't,\nthen I _must_ have alibi!\"\n\n\"You'd be surprised,\" Malone said. \"Now, about these murders--\"\n\n\"Was no murder, not by me,\" Brubitsch said firmly. \"Was never any\nkilling of anybody, not even by accident.\"\n\n\"But your two friends say--\" Boyd began.\n\n\"My two friends are not my friends,\" Brubitsch said firmly. \"If they\ntell you about murder and say it was me, they are no friends. I did\nnot murder anybody, I have alibi. I did not even murder anybody a\nlittle bit. They are no friends. This is terrible.\"\n\n\"There,\" Malone said reflectively, \"I agree with you. It's positively\nawful. And I think we might as well give it up. After all, we don't\nneed your testimony. The other two are enough; they'll get maybe ten\nyears apiece, but you're going to get the chair.\"\n\n\"I will not sit down,\" Brubitsch said firmly. \"I am innocent. I am\ninnocent like a small child. Does a small child commit a murder? It is\nridiculous.\"\n\nBoyd picked up his cue with ease. \"You might as well give us your side\nof the story, then,\" he said easily. \"If you didn't commit any\nmurders--\"\n\n\"I am a small child,\" Brubitsch announced.\n\n\"Okay,\" Boyd said. \"But if you didn't commit any murders, just what\n_have_ you been doing since you've been in this country as a Soviet\nagent?\"\n\n\"I will say nothing,\" Brubitsch announced. \"I am a small child. It is\nenough.\" He paused, blinked, and went on, \"I will only tell you this:\nno murders were done by our group in any of our activities.\"\n\n\"And what were your activities?\" Malone asked.\n\n\"Oh, many things,\" Brubitsch said. \"Many, many things. We--\"\n\nThe telephone rang loudly, and Malone scooped it up with a practiced\nhand. \"Malone here,\" he said.\n\nHer Majesty's voice was excited. \"Sir Kenneth!\" she said. \"I just got\na tremendous burst of static!\"\n\nMalone blinked. _Is my mind acting up again?_ he thought, knowing she\nwould pick it up. _Am I being interfered with?_\n\nHe didn't feel any different. But then, how was he supposed to feel?\n\n\"It's not _your_ mind, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said. \"Not this time.\nIt's _his_ mind. That sneaky-thinking Brubitsch fellow.\"\n\n_Brubitsch?_ Malone thought. _Now what is that supposed to mean?_\n\n\"I don't know, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said. \"But get on back to\nyour questioning. He's ready to talk now.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Malone said aloud. \"Fine.\" He hung up and looked back to the\nRussian sitting on his chair. Brubitsch was ready to talk, and that\nwas one good thing, anyhow. But what was all the static about?\n\nWhat was going on?\n\n\"Now, then,\" Malone said. \"You were telling us about your group\nactivities.\"\n\n\"True,\" Brubitsch said. \"I did not commit any murders. It is possible\nthat Borbitsch committed murders. It is maybe even possible that\nGarbitsch committed murders. But I do not think so.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"They are my friends,\" Brubitsch said. \"Even if they tell lies. They\nare also small children. Besides, I am not even the head of the\ngroup.\"\n\n\"Who is?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Garbitsch,\" Brubitsch said instantly. \"He worked in the State\nDepartment, and he told us what to look for in the Senate Office\nBuilding.\"\n\n\"What were you supposed to look for?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"For information,\" Brubitsch said. \"For scraps of paper, or things we\noverheard. But it was very bad, very bad.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, bad?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Everything was terrible,\" Brubitsch said mournfully. \"Sometimes\nBorbitsch heard something and forgot to tell Garbitsch about it.\nGarbitsch did not like this. He is a very inflamed person. Once he\nthreatened to send Borbitsch to the island of Yap as a spy. That is a\nvery bad place to go to. There are no enjoyments on the island of Yap,\nand no ones likes strangers there. Borbitsch was very sad.\"\n\n\"What did you do with your information?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"We remembered it,\" Brubitsch said. \"Or, if we had a scrap of paper,\nwe saved it for Garbitsch and gave it to him. But I remember once that\nI had some paper. It had a formula on it. I do not know what the\nformula said.\"\n\n\"What was it about?\" Malone said.\n\nBrubitsch gave a massive shrug. \"It was about an X and some numbers,\"\nhe said. \"It was not very interesting, but it was a formula, and\nGarbitsch would have liked it. Unfortunately, I did not give it to\nhim.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"I am ashamed,\" Brubitsch said, looking ashamed. \"I was lighting a\ncigarette in the afternoon, when I had the formula. It is a very\nrelaxing thing to smoke a cigarette in the afternoon. It is soothing\nto the soul.\" He looked very sad. \"I was holding the piece of paper in\none hand,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the match and the paper came into\ncontact. I burned my finger. Here.\" He stuck out a finger toward\nMalone and Boyd, who looked at it without much interest for a second.\n\"The paper is gone,\" he said. \"Don't tell Garbitsch. He is very\ninflamed.\"\n\nMalone sighed. \"But you remember the formula,\" he said. \"Don't you?\"\n\nBrubitsch shook his massive head very slowly. \"It was not very\ninteresting,\" he said. \"And I do not have a mathematical mind.\"\n\n\"We know,\" Malone said. \"You are a small child.\"\n\n\"It was terrible,\" Brubitsch said. \"Garbitsch was not happy about our\nactivities.\"\n\n\"What did Garbitsch do with the information?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"He passed it on,\" Brubitsch said. \"Every week he would send a\nshort-wave message to the homeland, in code. Some weeks he did not\nsend the message.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" Malone said.\n\n\"The radio did not work,\" Brubitsch said simply. \"We received orders\nby short-wave, but sometimes we did not receive the orders. The radio\nwas of very poor quality, and some weeks it refused to send any\nmessages. On other weeks, it refused to receive any messages.\"\n\n\"Who was your contact in Russia?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"A man named X,\" Brubitsch said. \"Like in the formula.\"\n\n\"But what was his real name?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Who knows?\" Brubitsch said. \"Does it matter?\"\n\n\"What else did you do?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"We met twice a week,\" Brubitsch said. \"Sometimes in Garbitsch's home,\nsometimes in other places. Sometimes we had information. At other\ntimes, we were friends, having a social gathering.\"\n\n\"Friends?\" Malone said.\n\nBrubitsch nodded. \"We drank together, talked, played chess. Garbitsch\nis the best chess player in the group. I am not very good. But once we\nhad some trouble.\" He paused. \"We had been drinking Russian liquors.\nThey are very strong. We decided to uphold the honor of our country.\"\n\n\"I think,\" Malone murmured sadly, \"I know what's coming.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" Brubitsch said, interested. \"At any rate, we decided to honor\nour country in song. And a policeman came and talked to us. He took us\ndown to the police station.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"He was suspicious,\" Brubitsch said. \"We were singing the\n_Internationale_, and he was suspicious. It is unreasonable.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" Boyd said. \"What happened then?\"\n\n\"He took us to the police station,\" Brubitsch said, \"and then after a\nlittle while he let us go. I do not understand this.\"\n\n\"It's all right,\" Malone said. \"I do.\" He drew Boyd aside for a\nsecond, and whispered to him: \"The cops were ready to charge these\nthree clowns with everything in the book. We had a hell of a time\nspringing them so we could go on watching them. I remember the\nstir-up, though I never did know their names until now.\"\n\nBoyd nodded, and they returned to Brubitsch, who was staring up at\nthem with surly eyes.\n\n\"It is a secret you are telling him,\" Brubitsch said. \"That is not\nright.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, it's not right?\" Malone said.\n\n\"It is wrong,\" Brubitsch went on. \"It is not the American way.\"\n\nHe went on, with some prodding, to tell about the activities of the\nspy ring. It did not seem to be a very efficient spy ring; Brubitsch's\nlong sad tale of forgotten messages, mixed orders, misplaced documents\nand strange mishaps was a marvel and a revelation to the listening\nofficers. \"I've never heard anything like it,\" one of them whispered\nin a tone of absolute wonder. \"They're almost working on our side.\"\n\nOver an hour later, Malone turned wearily away from the prisoner. \"All\nright, Brubitsch,\" he said. \"I guess that pretty much covers things\nfor the moment. If we want any more information, though--\"\n\n\"Call on me,\" Brubitsch said sadly. \"I am not going anyplace. And I\nwill give you all the information you desire. But I did not commit any\nmurders.\"\n\n\"Goodbye, small child,\" Malone said, as two agents led the fat man\naway. The other two left soon afterward, and Malone and Boyd were\nalone.\n\n\"Think he was telling the truth?\" Boyd said.\n\nMalone nodded. \"Nobody,\" he said, \"could make up a story like that.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Boyd said, and the phone rang. Malone picked it up.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked.\n\n\"He was telling the truth, all right,\" Her Majesty said. \"There are a\nfew more details, of course, like the girl Brubitsch was involved\nwith, Sir Kenneth. But she doesn't seem to have anything to do with\nthe spy ring, and besides, she isn't a very nice person. She always\nwants money.\"\n\n\"Sounds perfectly lovely,\" Malone said. \"As a matter of fact, I think\nI know her. I know a lot of girls who always want money. It seems to\nbe in fashion.\"\n\n\"You don't know this one, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said, \"and\nbesides, she wouldn't be a good influence on you.\"\n\nMalone sighed. \"How about the static explosions?\" he said. \"Pick up\nany more?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"Just that one.\"\n\nMalone nodded at the receiver. \"All right,\" he said. \"We're going to\nbring in the second one now. Keep up the good work.\"\n\nHe hung up.\n\n\"Who've you got in the observation room?\" Boyd asked.\n\n\"Queen Elizabeth I,\" Malone said. \"Her Royal Majesty.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Boyd said without surprise. \"Well, was Brubitsch telling the\ntruth?\"\n\n\"He wasn't holding back anything important,\" Malone said, thinking\nabout the girl. It would be nice to meet a bad influence, he thought\nmournfully. It would be nice to go somewhere with a bad influence (a\nbad influence, he amended, with a good figure) and forget all about\nhis job, about the spies, about telepathy, teleportation, psionics and\neverything else. It might be restful.\n\nUnfortunately, it was impossible.\n\n\"What's this business about a static explosion?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Don't ask silly questions,\" Malone said. \"A static explosion is a\ncontradiction in terms. If something is static, it doesn't move--\nwhoever heard of a motionless explosion?\"\n\n\"If it is a contradiction in terms,\" Boyd said, \"they're your terms.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But I don't know what they mean. I don't even\nknow what I mean.\"\n\n\"You're in a bad way,\" Boyd said, looking sympathetic.\n\n\"I'm in a perfectly terrible way,\" Malone said, \"and it's going to get\nworse. You wait and see.\"\n\n\"Of course I'll wait and see,\" Boyd said. \"I wouldn't miss the end of\nthe world for anything. It ought to be a great spectacle.\" He paused.\n\"Want them to bring in the next one?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"What have we got to lose but our minds? And who\nis the next one?\"\n\n\"Borbitsch,\" Boyd said. \"They're saving Garbitsch for a big finish.\"\n\nMalone nodded wearily. \"Onward,\" he said, and picked up the phone. He\npunched a number, spoke a few words and hung up.\n\nA minute later, the four FBI agents came back, leading a man. This one\nwas tall and thin, with the expression of a gloomy, degenerate and\nslightly nauseated bloodhound. He was led to the chair and he sat down\nin it as if he expected the worst to start happening at once.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said in a bored, tired voice. \"So this is the one who\nwon't talk.\"\n\n\n6\n\nMidnight.\n\nKenneth J. Malone sat at his desk, in his Washington office,\nsurrounded by piles of papers covering the desk, spilling off onto the\nfloor and decorating his lap. He was staring at the papers as if he\nexpected them to leap up, dance round him and shout the solution to\nall his problems at him in trained choral voices. They did nothing at\nall.\n\nSeated cross-legged on the rug in the center of the room, and looking\nlike an impossible combination of the last Henry Tudor and Gautama\nBuddha, Thomas Boyd did nothing either. He was staring downward, his\nhands folded on his ample lap, wearing an expression of utter, burning\nfrustration. And on a nearby chair sat the third member of the\ncompany, wearing the calm and patient expression of the gently-born\nunder all vicissitudes: Queen Elizabeth I.\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said into the silence. \"Now let's see what we've\ngot.\"\n\n\"I think we've got cerebral paresis,\" Boyd said. \"It's been coming on\nfor years.\"\n\n\"Don't be funny,\" Malone said.\n\nBoyd gave a short, mirthless bark. \"Funny?\" he said. \"I'm absolutely\nhysterical with joy and good humor. I'm out of my mind with\nhappiness.\" He paused. \"Anyway,\" he finished, \"I'm out of my mind.\nWhich puts me in good company. The entire FBI, Brubitsch, Borbitsch,\nGarbitsch, Dr. Thomas O'Connor and Sir Lewis Carter--we're all out of\nour minds. If we weren't, we'd all move away to the moon.\"\n\n\"And drink to forget,\" Malone added. \"Sure. But let's try and get some\nwork done.\"\n\n\"By all means, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said. Boyd had not included\nher in his list of insane people, and she looked slightly miffed. It\nwas hard for Malone to tell whether she was miffed by the mention of\ninsanity, or at being left out.\n\n\"Let's review the facts,\" Malone said. \"This whole thing started with\nsome inefficiency in Congress.\"\n\n\"And some upheavals elsewhere,\" Boyd said. \"Labor unions, gangster\norganizations.\"\n\n\"Just about all over,\" Malone said. \"And though we've found three\nspies, it seems pretty obvious that they aren't causing this.\"\n\n\"They aren't causing much of anything,\" Boyd said. \"Except a lot of\nunbelieving laughter further up the FBI line. I don't think anybody is\ngoing to believe our reports of those interviews.\"\n\n\"But they're true,\" Her Majesty said.\n\n\"Sure they're true,\" Boyd said. \"That's the unbelievable part. They\nread like farce, and not very good farce at that.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" Malone said. \"I think they're pretty funny.\"\n\n\"Shall we get back to the business at hand?\" Her Majesty said gently.\n\n\"Ah,\" Malone said. \"Anyhow, it isn't the spies. And what we now have\nis confusion even worse compounded.\"\n\n\"Confounded,\" Boyd said. \"John Milton. _Paradise Lost_, I heard it\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"I don't mean confounded,\" Malone said. \"I mean confusion. Anyhow, the\nRussian espionage rings in this country seem to be in as bad a state\nas the Congress, the labor unions, the syndicates, and all the rest.\nAnd all of them seem to have some sort of weird tie-in to these\nflashes of telepathic interference. Right, Your Majesty?\"\n\n\"I believe so, Sir Kenneth,\" she said. The old woman looked tired and\nconfused. Somehow, a lot of the brightness seemed to have gone out of\nher life. \"That's right,\" she said. \"I didn't realize there was so\nmuch of it going on. You see, Sir Kenneth, you're the only one I can\npick up at a distance who has been having these flashes. But now that\nI'm here in Washington, I can feel it going on all around me.\"\n\n\"It may not have anything to do with everything else,\" Boyd said.\n\nMalone shook his head. \"If it doesn't,\" he said, \"it's the weirdest\ncoincidence I've ever even dreamed about, and my dreams can be pretty\nstrange. No, it's got to be tied in. There's some kind of mental\nstatic that is somehow making all these people goof up.\"\n\n\"But why?\" Boyd said. \"What is it being done for? Just fun?\"\n\n\"God only knows,\" Malone said. \"But we're going to have to find out.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" Boyd said, \"I suggest lots and lots of prayers.\"\n\nHer Majesty looked up. \"That's a fine idea,\" she said.\n\n\"But God helps those,\" Malone said, \"who help themselves. And we're\ngoing to help ourselves. Mostly with facts.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Boyd said. \"So far, all the facts have been a great\nhelp.\"\n\n\"Well, here's one,\" Malone said. \"We got one flash each from\nBrubitsch, Borbitsch and Garbitsch while we were questioning them. And\nin each case, that flash occurred just before they started to blab\neverything they knew. Before the flash, they weren't talking. They\nwere behaving just like good spies and keeping their mouths shut.\nAfter the flash, they couldn't talk fast enough.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Boyd said reflectively. \"They did seem to give up\npretty fast, even for amateurs.\"\n\nMalone nodded. \"So the question is this,\" he said. \"Just what happens\nduring those crazy bursts of static?\"\n\nHe looked expectantly at Her Majesty, but she shook her head sadly. \"I\ndon't know,\" she said. \"I simply don't know. It's just noise to me,\nmeaningless noise.\" She put her hands slowly over her face. \"People\nshouldn't do things like that to their Sovereign,\" she said in a\nmuffled voice.\n\nMalone got up and went over to her. She wasn't crying, but she wasn't\nfar from it. He put an arm around her thin shoulders. \"Now, look, Your\nMajesty,\" he said in gentle tones, \"this will all clear up. We'll find\nout what's going on, and we'll find a way to put a stop to it.\"\n\n\"Sure we will,\" Boyd said. \"After all, Your Majesty, Sir Kenneth and I\nwill work hard on this.\"\n\n\"And the Queen's own FBI,\" Malone said, \"won't stop until we've\nfinished with this whole affair, once and for all.\"\n\nHer Majesty brought her hands down from her face, very slowly. She was\nforcing a smile, but it didn't look too well. \"I know you won't fail\nyour Queen,\" she said. \"You two have always been the most loyal of my\nsubjects.\"\n\n\"We'll work hard,\" Malone said. \"No matter how long it takes.\"\n\n\"Because, after all,\" Boyd said in a musing, thoughtful tone, \"it is a\nserious crime, you know.\"\n\nThe words seemed to have an effect on Her Majesty, like a tonic. For a\nsecond her face wore an expression of Royal anger and indignance, and\nthe accustomed strength flowed back into her aged voice. \"You're quite\ncorrect, Sir Thomas!\" she said. \"The security of the Throne and the\nCrown are at stake!\"\n\nMalone blinked. \"What?\" he said. \"Are you two talking about something?\nWhat crime is this?\"\n\n\"An extremely serious one,\" Boyd said in a grave voice. He rose\nunsteadily to his feet, planted them firmly on the carpet, and\nfrowned.\n\n\"Go on,\" Malone said, fascinated. Her Majesty was watching Boyd with\nan intent expression.\n\n\"The crime,\" Boyd said, \"the very serious crime involved, is that of\nThreatening the Welfare of the Queen. The criminal has committed the\ncrime of Causing the Said Sovereign, Baselessly, Reasonlessly and\nWithout Consent or Let, to Be in a State of Apprehension for Her Life\nor Her Well-Being. And this crime--\"\n\n\"Aha,\" Malone said. \"I've got it. The crime is--\"\n\n\"High treason,\" Boyd intoned.\n\n\"High treason,\" Her Majesty said with satisfaction and fire in her\nvoice.\n\n\"Very high treason,\" Malone said. \"Extremely high.\"\n\n\"Stratospheric,\" Boyd agreed. \"That is, of course,\" he added, \"if the\nperpetrators of this dastardly crime are Her Majesty's subjects.\"\n\n\"My goodness,\" the Queen said. \"I never thought of that. Suppose\nthey're not?\"\n\n\"Then,\" Malone said in his most vibrant voice, \"it is an Act of War.\"\n\n\"Steps,\" Boyd said, \"must be taken.\"\n\n\"We must do our utmost,\" Malone said. \"Sir Thomas--\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir Kenneth?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"This task requires our most fervent dedication,\" Malone said. \"Please\ncome with me.\"\n\nHe went to the desk. Boyd followed him, walking straight-backed and\ntall. Malone bent and removed from a drawer of the desk a bottle of\nbourbon. He closed the drawer, poured some bourbon into two handy\nwater-glasses from the desk, and capped the bottle. He handed one of\nthe water-glasses to Boyd, and raised the other one aloft.\n\n\"Sir Thomas,\" Malone said, \"I give you Her Majesty, the Queen!\"\n\n\"To the Queen!\" Boyd echoed.\n\nThey downed their drinks and turned, as one man, to hurl the glasses\ninto the wastebasket.\n\nIn thinking it over later, Malone realized that he hadn't considered\nanything about that moment silly at all. Of course, an outsider might\nhave been slightly surprised at the sequence of events, but Malone was\nno outsider. And, after all, it was the proper way to treat a Queen,\nwasn't it?\n\nAnd...\n\nWhen Malone had first met Her Majesty, he had wondered why, although\nshe could obviously read minds, and so knew perfectly well that\nneither Malone nor Boyd believed she was Queen Elizabeth I, she\ninsisted on an outward show of respect and dedication. He'd asked her\nabout it at last, and her reply had been simple, reasonable and to the\npoint.\n\nAccording to her--and Malone didn't doubt it for an instant--most\npeople simply didn't think their superiors were all they claimed to\nbe. But they acted as if they did, at least while in the presence of\nthose superiors. It was a common fiction, a sort of handy oil on the\nwheels of social intercourse.\n\nAnd all Her Majesty had ever insisted on was the same sort of\ntreatment.\n\n\"Bless you,\" she'd said, \"I can't help the way you _think_, but, as\nQueen, I do have some control over the way you _act_.\"\n\nThe funny thing, as far as Malone was concerned, was that the two\nparts of his personality were becoming more and more alike. He didn't\nactually believe that Her Majesty was Queen Elizabeth I, and he hoped\nfervently that he never would. But he did have a great deal of respect\nfor her, and more affection than he had believed possible at first.\nShe was the grandmother Malone had never known; she was good, and\nkind, and he wanted to keep her happy and contented. There had been\nnothing at all phony in the solemn toast he had proposed, nor in the\nrighteous indignation he had felt against anyone who was giving Her\nMajesty even a minute's worth of discomfort.\n\nAnd Boyd, surprisingly enough, seemed to feel the same way. Malone\nfelt good about that; Her Majesty needed all the loyal supporters she\ncould get.\n\nBut all of this was later. At the time, Malone was doing nothing\nexcept what came naturally. Nor, apparently, was Boyd. After the\nglasses had been thrown, with a terrifying crash, into the metal\nwastebasket, and the reverberations of that second had stopped ringing\nin their ears, a moment of silence had followed.\n\nThen Boyd turned, briskly rubbing his hands. \"All right,\" he said.\n\"Let's get back to work.\"\n\nMalone looked at the proud, happy look on Her Majesty's face; he saw\nthe glimmer of a tear in the corner of each eye. But he gave no\nindication that he had noticed anything at all out of the ordinary.\n\n\"Fine,\" he said. \"Now, getting on back to the facts, we've established\nsomething, anyhow. Some agency is causing flashes of telepathic static\nall over the place. And those flashes are somehow connected with the\nconfusion that's going on all around us. Somehow, these flashes have\nan effect on the minds of people.\"\n\n\"And we know at least one manifestation of that effect,\" Boyd said.\n\"It makes spies blab all their secrets when they're exposed to it.\"\n\n\"These three spies, anyhow,\" Malone said.\n\n\"If spies is the right word,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Okay,\" Malone said. \"And now we've got another obvious question.\"\n\n\"It seems to me we've got about twelve,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"I mean, who's doing it?\" Malone said. \"Who is causing these\ntelepathic flashes?\"\n\n\"Maybe it's just happening,\" Boyd said. \"Out of thin air.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Malone said. \"But let's go on the assumption that there's a\nhuman cause. The other way, we can't do a thing except sit back and\nwatch the world go to hell.\"\n\nBoyd nodded. \"It doesn't seem to be the Russians,\" he said. \"Although,\nof course, it might be a Red herring.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Well,\" Boyd said, \"they might have known we were on to Brubitsch,\nBorbitsch and Garbitsch--\" He stopped. \"You know,\" he said, \"every\ntime I say that name I have to reassure myself that we're not all\nwalking around in the world of Florenz Ziegfeld.\"\n\n\"Likewise,\" Malone said. \"But go on.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Boyd said. \"Anyhow, they might have set the three of them up\nas patsies, just in case we stumbled on to this mess. We can't\noverlook this possibility.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Malone said. \"It's faint, but it is a possibility. In other\nwords, the agency behind the flashes might be Russian, and it might\nnot be Russian.\"\n\n\"That clears that up nicely,\" Boyd said. \"Next question?\"\n\n\"The next one,\" Malone said grimly, \"is, what's behind the flashes?\nSome sort of psionic power is causing them, that much is obvious.\"\n\n\"I'll go along with that,\" Boyd said. \"I have to go along with it. But\ndon't think I like it.\"\n\n\"Nobody likes it,\" Malone said. \"But let's go on. O'Connor isn't any\nhelp; he washes his hands of the whole business.\"\n\n\"Lucky man,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"He says that it can't be happening,\" Malone said, \"and if it is we're\nall screwy. Now, right or wrong, that isn't an opinion that gives us\nany handle to work with.\"\n\n\"No,\" Boyd said reflectively. \"A certain amount of comfort, to be\nsure, but no handles.\"\n\n\"Sir Lewis Carter, on the other hand--\" Malone said. He fumbled\nthrough some of the piles of paper until he had located the ones the\npresident of the Psychical Research Society had sent. \"Sir Lewis\nCarter,\" he went on, \"does seem to be doing some pretty good work. At\nleast, some of the more modern stuff he sent over looks pretty solid.\nThey've been doing quite a bit of research into the subject, and their\ntheories seem to be all right, or nearly all right, to me. Of course,\nI'm not an expert.\"\n\n\"Who is?\" Boyd said. \"Except for O'Connor, of course.\"\n\n\"Well, somebody is,\" Malone said. \"Whoever's doing all this, for\ninstance. And the theories do seem okay. In most cases, for instance,\nthey agree with O'Connor's work, though they're not in complete\nagreement.\"\n\n\"I should think so,\" Boyd said. \"O'Connor wouldn't recognize an astral\nplane if TWA were putting them into service.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that sort of thing,\" Malone said. \"There's lots about\nastral bodies and ghosts, ectoplasm, Transcendental Yoga, theosophy,\nderos, the Great Pyramid, Atlantis, Mu, norns, and other such\nridiculous pets. That's just silly, as far as I can see. But what they\nhave to say about parapsychology and psionics as such does seem to be\nreasonably accurate.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Boyd said tiredly.\n\n\"Okay, then,\" Malone said. \"Did anybody notice anything in that pile\nof stuff that might conceivably have any bearing whatever on our\nproblems?\"\n\n\"I did,\" Boyd said. \"Or I think I did.\"\n\n\"You both did,\" Her Majesty said. \"And so did I, when I looked through\nit. But I didn't bother with it. I dismissed it.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Because I don't think it's true,\" she said. \"However, my opinion is\nreally only an opinion.\" She smiled around at the others.\n\nMalone picked up a thick sheaf of papers from one of the piles of his\ndesk. \"Let's get straight what it is we're talking about,\" he said.\n\"All right?\"\n\n\"Anything's all right with me,\" Boyd said. \"I'm easy to please.\"\n\nMalone nodded. \"Now, this writer--what's his name?\" he said. He\nglanced at the copy of the cover page. _\"Minds and Morons,\"_ he read.\n\"By Cartier Taylor.\"\n\n\"Great title,\" Boyd said. \"Does he say which is which?\"\n\n\"Let's get back to serious business,\" Malone said, giving Boyd a\nsingle look. There was silence for a second, and then Malone said, \"He\nmentions something, in the book, that he calls 'telepathic\nprojection.' As far as I understand what he's talking about, that's\nsome method of forcing your thoughts on another person.\" He glanced\nover at the Queen. \"Now, Your Majesty,\" he said, \"you don't think it's\ntrue--and that may only be an opinion, but it's a pretty informed one.\nIt seems to me as if Taylor makes a good case for this 'telepathic\nprojection' of his. Why don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Because,\" Her Majesty said flatly, \"it doesn't work.\"\n\n\"You've tried it?\" Boyd put in.\n\n\"I have,\" she said. \"And I have had no success with it at all. It's a\ncomplete failure.\"\n\n\"Now, wait a minute,\" Boyd said. \"Just a minute.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Malone said. \"Have you tried it, and made it\nwork?\"\n\nBoyd snorted. \"Fat chance,\" he said. \"I just want to look at the\nthing, that's all.\" He held out his hand, and Malone gave him the\nsheaf of papers. Boyd leafed through them slowly, stopping every now\nand again to consult a page, until he found what he was looking for.\n\"There,\" he said.\n\n\"There what?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Listen to this,\" Boyd said. \"'For those who draw the line at demonic\npossession, I suggest trying telepathic projection. Apparently, it is\npossible to project one's own thoughts directly into the mind of\nanother--even to the point of taking control of the other's mind.\nHypnotism? You tell me, and we'll both know. Ever since the orthodox\nscientists have come around to accepting hypnotism, I'm been chary of\nit. Maybe there really is an astral body or a soul that a person has\nstashed about him somewhere--something that he can send out to take\ncontrol of another human being. But I, personally, prefer the\ntelepathic projection theory. All you have to do is squirt your\nthoughts across space and spray them all over the other fellow's\nbrain. Presto-bingo, he does pretty much what you want him to do.'\"\n\n\"That's the quote I was thinking of,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Of course it is,\" Her Majesty said. \"But it really doesn't work. I've\ntried it.\"\n\n\"How have you tried it?\" Malone said.\n\n\"There were many times, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said, \"when I wanted\nsomeone to do something particular for me or for some other person.\nAfter all, you must remember that I was in a hospital for a long time.\nOf course, that represents only a short segment of my life-span, but\nit seemed long to me.\"\n\nMalone, who was trying to view the years from age fifteen to age\nsixty-odd as a short segment of anybody's lifetime, remembered with a\nshock that this was not Rose Thompson speaking. It was Queen Elizabeth\nI, who had never died.\n\n\"That's right, Sir Kenneth,\" she said kindly. \"And in that hospital,\nthere were a number of times when I wanted one of the doctors or\nnurses to do what I wanted them to. I tried many times, but I never\nsucceeded.\"\n\nBoyd nodded his head. \"Well--\" he began.\n\n\"Oh, yes, Sir Thomas,\" Her Majesty said. \"What you're thinking is\ncertainly possible. It may even be true.\"\n\n\"What _is_ he thinking?\" Malone said.\n\n\"He thinks,\" Her Majesty said, \"that I may not have the talent for\nthis particular effect--and perhaps I don't. But, talent or not, I\nknow what's possible and what isn't. And the way Mr. Taylor describes\nit is simply silly, that's all. And unladylike. Imagine any\nself-respecting lady 'squirting' her thoughts about in space!\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said carefully, \"aside from its being unladylike--\"\n\n\"Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said, \"you are not telepathic. Neither is\nSir Thomas.\"\n\n\"I'm nothing,\" Boyd said. \"I don't even exist.\"\n\n\"And it is very difficult to explain to the non-telepath just what Mr.\nTaylor is implying,\" Her Majesty went on imperturbably. \"Before you\ncould inject any thoughts into anyone else's mind, you'd have to be\nable to see into that mind. Is that correct?\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And in order to do that, you'd have to be telepathic,\" Her Majesty\nsaid. \"Am I correct?\"\n\n\"Correct,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Well, then,\" Her Majesty said with satisfaction, and beamed at him.\n\nA second passed.\n\n\"Well, then, what?\" Malone said in confusion.\n\n\"Telepathy,\" Her Majesty said patiently, \"is an extremely complex\naffair. It involves a sort of meshing with the mind of this other\nperson. It has nothing, absolutely nothing, in common with this simple\n'squirting' of thoughts across space, as if they were orange pips you\nwere trying to put into a wastebasket. No, Sir Kenneth, I cannot\nbelieve in what Mr. Taylor says.\"\n\n\"But it's still possible,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Her Majesty said, \"it's certainly possible. But I should think\nthat if any telepaths were around, and if they were changing people's\nminds by 'squirting' at them, I would know it.\"\n\nMalone frowned. \"Maybe you would at that,\" he said. \"I guess you\nwould.\"\n\n\"Not to mention,\" Boyd put in, \"that if you were going to control\neverything we've come across like that you'd need an awful lot of\ntelepathic operators.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Malone admitted. \"And the objections seem to make some\nsense. But what else is there to go on?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Boyd said. \"I haven't the faintest idea. And I'm\nrapidly approaching the stage where I don't care.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, heaving a sigh, \"let's keep looking.\"\n\nHe bent down and picked up another sheaf of copies from the Psychical\nResearch Society.\n\n\"After all,\" he said, without much hope, \"you never know.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nMalone looked around the office of Andrew J. Burris as if he'd never\nseen it before. He felt tired, and worn out, and depressed; it had\nbeen a long night, and here it was morning and the head of the FBI was\ngiving him instructions. It was, Malone told himself, a hell of a\nlife.\n\n\"Now, Malone,\" Burris said, \"this is a very ticklish situation. You've\ngot to handle it with great care.\"\n\n\"I can see that,\" Malone said apprehensively. \"It certainly looks\nticklish. And unusual.\"\n\n\"Well, we don't want any trouble,\" Burris said. \"We have enough\ntrouble now.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I think we have too much,\" Malone said.\n\n\"That's our job,\" Burris said, looking grim.\n\nMalone blinked. \"What is?\" he said.\n\n\"Having trouble,\" Burris said.\n\nThere was a short silence. Malone broke it. \"Anyhow,\" he said, \"you\nfeel we have enough trouble, so we're trying to make things easy for\neverybody.\"\n\nBurris nodded. \"I've talked with the president,\" he said, \"and he\nfeels this is the best way to handle matters.\"\n\nMalone tried to imagine Burris explaining the incredible complexities\nof the situation to the president, and was torn between relief that he\nhadn't been there and a curious wish to have heard the scrambled\nconversation that must have taken place. \"The way it seems to me,\" he\nsaid cautiously, \"shipping those spies back to Russia is a worse\npunishment than sending them to the federal pen.\"\n\n\"Maybe it is,\" Burris said. \"Maybe it is. How would you feel if you\nwere being sent to jail?\"\n\n\"Innocent,\" Malone said instantly.\n\n\"But that isn't the point,\" Burris went on. \"You see, Malone, we don't\nreally have much damaging evidence against those spies, except for\ntheir confessions. During all the time we were watching them, we took\ncare that they never did come up with anything dangerous; we weren't\nfishing for them but for their superiors, for the rest of the\nnetwork.\"\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be any more network,\" Malone said. \"Not in this\ncountry, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Burris said. \"We know that now, thanks to the confessions, and\nto Her Majesty. But we can't prosecute on that sort of evidence. You\nknow what a good defense attorney could do with unsupported\nconfessions--and even if we wanted to take the lid off telepathy for\nthe general public, it would be absolute hell bringing it into court.\"\n\n\"So,\" Malone said, \"we can't put them in prison, even if we want to.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't say that,\" Burris said hastily. \"We could probably win,\neven against a good defense. But they wouldn't get much time in\nprison, and we'd only end up deporting them in any case.\"\n\nMalone fished for a cigarette, lit it and blew out smoke. \"So we're\ngoing to save the taxpayers some money,\" he said. \"That'll be nice for\na change.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Burris said, beaming. \"We're going to save Federal\nfunds by shipping them back to their motherland now. After all, they\ndid take out their naturalization papers under false names, and their\ndeclarations are chockfull of false information. So all it takes is a\ncourt order to declare their citizenships null and void, and hand all\nthree of them back to the Soviets.\"\n\n\"A nice, simple housecleaning,\" Malone said. \"All open and\nabove-board. And the confessions will certainly stand up in a\ndeportation hearing.\"\n\n\"No question of it,\" Burris said. \"But the reason I called you here,\nMalone, is that there's still one thing bothering me.\"\n\nMalone blew out some more smoke, thought wistfully about cigars, and\nsaid: \"What? Everything seems simple enough to me.\"\n\nBurris frowned and leaned back in his chair. \"It's this notion of\nyours, Malone,\" he said.\n\n\"Notion?\"\n\n\"About going over there,\" Burris said. \"Now, I can understand your\nwanting some facts on Moscow, current background and all that sort of\nthing. So far, everything makes sense.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said warily.\n\n\"But, after all, Malone,\" Burris said, \"we do have such a thing as the\nCentral Intelligence Agency. They send us reports. That's what they're\nfor. And why you want to ignore the reports and make a trip over there\nto walk around and see for yourself--\"\n\n\"It's because of everything that's happening,\" Malone said.\n\nBurris looked puzzled. \"What?\" he said.\n\n\"Because of all the confusion,\" Malone said. \"Frankly, I can't trust\nthe CIA, or any other branch of the government. I've got to see for\nmyself.\"\n\nBurris considered this for a second. \"It's going to look very\npeculiar,\" he said.\n\nMalone shrugged. \"Everything looks peculiar,\" he said. \"A little more\nwon't hurt anything. And if I do turn up anything we can use, the\nwhole trip will be worth it.\"\n\n\"But sending an FBI man along with Brubitsch, Borbitsch and Garbitsch\nis a little strange,\" Burris said. \"Not to mention Her Majesty.\"\n\n\"There is that,\" Malone said. \"I wonder what our Red friends are going\nto think of the Queen.\"\n\n\"God knows,\" Burris said. \"If they take her seriously, they're liable\nto call her some sort of capitalist deviationist.\"\n\n\"And if they don't take her seriously?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Then they're going to wonder why she's _pretending_ to be a\ncapitalist deviationist,\" Burris said.\n\nMalone flicked his cigarette at an ashtray. \"You can't win,\" he said.\n\n\"Frankly,\" Burris said, \"I wouldn't allow Her Majesty to go along\nunder any circumstances--except that there is an excuse for having an\nolder woman around.\"\n\n\"There is?\" Malone said.\n\nBurris nodded. \"As a chaperone,\" he said.\n\n\"Now, wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"Brubitsch, Borbitsch and\nwhat's-his-name don't need a chaperone.\"\n\n\"I didn't say it was for them,\" Burris said.\n\n\"Me?\" Malone asked in a tone of absolute wonder. \"Now, Chief, I don't\nneed a chaperone. I'm a grown man. I know my way around. And the idea\nof having Her Majesty along to chaperone me is going to make\neverything look even stranger. After all, Chief--\"\n\n\"Malone,\" Burris said, in a voice of steel.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Malone mumbled. \"But, really, I'm not some young, innocent\ngirl in a Victorian novel.\"\n\n\"No,\" Burris said, a trifle sadly, \"you're not. But there is one going\nalong on the trip with the rest of you.\"\n\n\"There is?\" Malone said. \"Who is she? Rebecca?\"\n\n\"Her name's Luba,\" Burris said. \"Luba Garbitsch.\"\n\n\"Garbitsch's wife?\" Malone said.\n\nBurris shook his head. \"His daughter,\" he said. \"And don't tell me\nthere isn't any such name as Luba. I know there isn't. But what would\nyou pick to go with Garbitsch?\"\n\n\"Wastepaper basket,\" Malone said instantly. \"Grapefruit rinds. Lemon\npeels. Coffee grounds.\"\n\n\"Damn it, Malone,\" Burris said, \"this is serious.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"it doesn't sound serious. What are we doing,\ndeporting the entire family?\"\n\n\"I suppose we could,\" Burris said, \"if we really wanted to get\ncomplicated about it. What with Garbitsch's false declaration, I\nhaven't the faintest idea what his daughter's status would be--but she\n_was_ born here, Malone, and as far as we can tell she's perfectly\nloyal to the United States.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"So you're sending her to Russia. This is making\nless and less sense, you know.\"\n\nBurris rubbed a hand over his face. \"Malone,\" he said in a quiet,\npatient voice, \"why don't you wait for me to finish? Then everything\nwill make sense. I promise.\"\n\n\"Well, all right,\" Malone said doubtfully. \"Luba Garbitsch is going\nalong to Russia, in spite of the fact that she's perfectly loyal.\"\n\n\"True,\" Burris said. \"You see, Malone, she loves her traitorous old\ndaddy just the same. Family affection. Very touching.\"\n\n\"And if he's going to Moscow--\"\n\n\"She wants to go along,\" Burris said. \"That's right.\"\n\n\"And you're going to send her along,\" Malone said, \"out of the\ngoodness of your kindly old heart. Just like Santa Claus. Or the\nEaster bunny.\"\n\nBurris looked acutely uncomfortable. \"Now, Malone,\" he said. \"It's not\nexactly that, and you know it.\"\n\n\"It isn't?\" Malone said, trying to look surprised.\n\nBurris shook his head. \"If we send Luba Garbitsch along,\" he said,\n\"that gives us a good excuse for Her Majesty. As a chaperone.\"\n\n\"Are you sure,\" Malone asked slowly, \"that anybody with a name like\nLuba Garbitsch could plausibly need a chaperone? Even in a den of\nvice? Because somehow it doesn't sound right: Luba Garbitsch,\nchaperoned by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth I.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Burris said, \"it won't be the Queen. I mean, she won't be\nknown as the Queen.\"\n\n\"Incognito?\" Malone said.\n\nBurris shrugged. \"In away,\" he said. \"What do you think would be a\ngood name for her to travel under?\"\n\nMalone considered. \"I don't know,\" he said at last. \"But no more\nLubas.\"\n\n\"I was thinking,\" Burris said carefully. \"How about Rose Thompson?\"\n\nThere was a long silence.\n\n\"I don't know whether she'll go for the idea,\" Malone said. \"But I'll\ntry it.\"\n\n\"You can do it, Malone,\" Burris said instantly. \"I know you can. I\njust know it.\"\n\n\"Your faith,\" Malone said with a sigh, \"is going to be too much for me\none of these days.\"\n\nBurris shrugged. \"Just take it easy, Malone,\" he said. \"You said you\nwanted to have Her Majesty over there to read a few minds, and you've\ngot her. But remember, don't get involved in anything complicated.\nDon't start any fireworks.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Stay out of political arguments,\" Burris said.\n\nMalone blinked. \"What do you think I'm going to do?\" he said. \"Bring\nalong a soapbox?\"\n\n\"You never know,\" Burris said. \"Just keep quiet, and don't go prowling\naround where you're not wanted.\"\n\n\"That,\" Malone said decisively, \"would keep me out of Russia\nentirely.\"\n\n\"Damn it,\" Burris said, \"you know what I mean. We don't want any\ninternational incidents, understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said.\n\nBurris nodded. \"All right, then,\" he said. \"Your plane leaves from the\nairport in an hour. You'd better go and talk to Her Majesty first.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And I hope you know what you're doing,\" Burris said.\n\n_So do I,_ Malone thought privately. Aloud, he said, \"I just want to\nget the feel of things over there, that's all, sir. I won't cause any\nmore trouble than an ordinary tourist.\"\n\n\"Malone,\" Burris said, \"don't be an ordinary tourist. They're\nempty-headed morons and they do make trouble. Be an invisible tourist.\nBe nice to everybody. Be polite and kind. Don't step on any toes, no\nmatter whose and no matter why.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Remember, they're going to know who you are,\" Burris said.\n\n\"It's not as if we could keep it a secret.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Malone said. \"I'll remember.\"\n\n\"All right.\" Burris extended his hand. \"Good luck, Malone,\" he said,\nwith a deeper feeling of sincerity than Malone had experienced from\nhim in months.\n\nMalone shook the hand. \"Thank you, sir,\" he said.\n\n* * * * *\n\nA little less than an hour later, Malone sat on the steps of the\nlanding ramp that led up to the open door of the big Air Force\ntransport plane on the runway. The plane was waiting, and so was\nMalone. He didn't feel confident, or even excited. He felt just a\nlittle bit frightened. Burris' complicated warnings had had some\neffect, and Malone was fighting down a minor case of the shakes.\n\nNext to him, her face wreathed in happy smiles, sat a smartly-dressed\ngrey-haired woman in her sixties. She wore an unobtrusive tailored\nsuit and a light jacket, and she looked as if she might be one of the\nelder matrons of the society set, very definitely an upper-crust type.\nIn spite of the normality of her clothing, Her Majesty looked every\ninch a Queen, Malone thought.\n\n\"And that, Sir Kenneth, is only natural,\" she said sweetly. \"Even when\ntraveling incognito, one must retain one's dignity. And I don't object\nat all to using the name of Rose Thompson in a good cause; it was used\nfor so many years it almost feels like part of me.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't be at all surprised,\" Malone said mildly.\n\nA voice from above and behind him interrupted his worried thoughts.\n\"Mr. Malone!\" it said. \"Mr. Malone?\"\n\nMalone screwed his head around and looked up. An Air Force colonel was\nstanding in the doorway of the plane, looking down with a stern,\nworried expression. \"Yes?\" Malone said. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Takeoff, Mr. Malone,\" the colonel said. \"We're due to go in fifteen\nminutes, and our clearance has been established.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said.\n\n\"But your passengers,\" the colonel said. \"Where are they?\"\n\nMalone tried to look calm, cool and collected. \"They'll be here,\" he\nsaid. \"Don't worry about a thing.\" Privately, he hoped he was right.\nBoyd hadn't shown up yet, and Boyd was bringing the musical-comedy spy\ntrio. It wasn't, Malone thought, that Boyd was usually late. But with\nBrubitsch, Borbitsch and Garbitsch in tow, almost anything could\nhappen, he thought. He hoped fervently that it wouldn't.\n\n\"It won't,\" Her Majesty said. \"At least, it hasn't so far. They're all\nin a car, and they're driving right here. Boyd is thinking that he\nought to be here within five minutes.\"\n\nMalone nodded, wiping his forehead. \"Five minutes, Colonel,\" he called\nback to the figure at the door. The colonel nodded efficiently at him,\nturned and disappeared inside the plane. Malone looked at his watch.\nThe second hand was going around awfully fast, he thought. He wondered\nif it were possible for time to speed up while he waited, so that by\nthe time Boyd arrived he would be an old, old man. He felt about eight\nyears older already, he told himself, and a minute hadn't even passed.\n\nHe forced his eyes away from the moving second hand. Looking at it, he\nknew, would only make him more nervous. Maybe there was some scenery\naround that he could stare at. He raised his eyes and looked out\ntoward the gates that led to the interior of the air terminal.\n\nScenery, he told himself in sudden wonder, was no word for it.\n\nHe stared. He wanted to blink, but at the same time he felt that it\nwould be a shame to close his eyes for even a tenth of a second. He\nheld his eyelids apart by main force and went right on staring.\n\nThe girl walking toward him across the field was absolutely beautiful.\nShe seemed to make everything light up and start singing. Malone was\nsure that, somewhere, he could hear birds plugging their favorite\nnumbers, and the soft rustle of the wind through pine branches. He\ncould feel the soft caress of the wind on his face, and he could smell\nthe odor of lilacs and honeysuckles and violets and whatever all those\nother flowers were. They had all different colors and shapes, and he\ncouldn't remember many of their names, but he could tell they were all\naround him. They had to be all around him. Especially all the red\nones.\n\nThe girl had red hair that tossed gently in the wind. The bottom\ntwo-thirds of her figure, Malone was happy to note, was not only as\ngood as the top third but a good deal better. It took him several\nseconds to reach this conclusion, because at first he was willing to\nswear that he had never seen such a beautiful girl before.\n\nBut, he told himself with a shade of apprehension, he had.\n\nAs she approached, he stood up. \"Well, well,\" he said brightly. \"If it\nisn't the Lady That's Known as Lou. Did the Psychical Research Society\ngive you the day off, or are you here to see about a misplaced broom?\"\n\nThe girl beamed at him. \"My, my,\" she said. \"How are you?\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"And--\"\n\n\"And how are the others?\" she said.\n\nMalone blinked. \"Others?\" he said.\n\nShe nodded. \"Grumpy, Sleepy, Happy, Dopey, Bashful and Doc,\" she said.\n\nMalone opened his mouth, shut it again, and thought for a second.\n\"Now, wait a minute,\" he said at last. \"That's not fair. I--\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"And I nearly forgot. I owe you one from last time:\n_gesundheit_.\"\n\n\"And many happy returns,\" Malone said. \"Seriously, what are you doing\nout here?\"\n\n\"Talking,\" the girl said. \"To you. Or hadn't you noticed?\"\n\n\"I mean in general,\" Malone said desperately.\n\n\"In general,\" she said agreeably, \"I'm here to take a little trip.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"By plane?\"\n\nShe smiled sweetly and shook her head. \"Not at all,\" she said. \"I'm\nwaiting for the next scheduled broomstick.\"\n\nMalone took a deep breath. \"When does your plane leave?\" he said\ndoggedly.\n\n\"In ten minutes or so,\" she said.\n\n\"Then you'd better hurry and get on,\" he said.\n\nShe nodded. \"That's what I thought,\" she said.\n\nA second passed.\n\n\"Did you want to say something?\" Malone said uncomfortably.\n\nShe shook her head. \"Not particularly,\" she said.\n\n\"Well, then--\"\n\n\"The time _is_ growing short,\" she said.\n\n\"Isn't it, though?\" Malone said, feeling a little mystified. \"Well,\nnow. Goodbye. I'll see you soon.\"\n\n\"Goodbye,\" she said.\n\nAnother second passed.\n\n\"Your plane--\" Malone started.\n\n\"How about yours?\" she said.\n\n\"I'm all right,\" Malone said nervously. \"But if your plane's leaving\nin ten minutes you'd better get on it.\"\n\n\"I intend to,\" she said, without moving.\n\n\"Well--\" Malone started.\n\n\"As soon as you quit blocking the ramp,\" she said. \"Would you mind\nterribly if I climbed over your head? Because I do have to get on\nboard.\"\n\n\"Now wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"This isn't your plane.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" she said. \"Do you own it? Are you flying it away?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said helplessly, \"it's my plane, and there's nobody\ngoing on it but--\"\n\nHe paused. A great light seemed to burst in his mind, shedding a\nperfectly horrible glow over the wreck of his mental processes. \"You\nknow,\" he said in a tentative tone, \"we never have been properly\nintroduced. I only know your name is Lou.\"\n\n\"That's what people call me,\" the girl said. \"For short. I'm Luba\nGarbitsch.\"\n\n\"And I'm Kenneth Malone,\" Malone said. \"Kenneth J. Malone. Of the\nFBI.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I know.\"\n\n\"Your father--\"\n\n\"My father is going to Russia,\" she said, \"and I am going along with\nhim.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Sure. Sure. Oh.\"\n\nThere was a longer silence.\n\n\"Can I get on board now?\" Luba said.\n\n\"There isn't any hurry,\" Malone said. \"We're still waiting for--for\npassengers. And this is one of them.\" He turned and indicated the\nQueen. \"This is Her--Rose Thompson. She'll be traveling along with\nus.\"\n\nHer Majesty was wearing a broad, broad grin, Malone noticed nervously\nas he turned. Undoubtedly she had been tuned in to the whole\nconversation, and knew just what had gone on in both minds. But she\nonly said, \"I'm very pleased to meet you, my dear.\"\n\nLou blinked, smiled and stretched out her hand. \"Well, then,\" she\nsaid. \"Hello. And let's all have a happy trip.\"\n\n\"By all means,\" Malone said. \"And the trip seems to be about to\nstart.\"\n\nHe could hear the tramping of a lot of feet coming across the field\ntoward them. He looked and saw that the feet were all neatly attached\nto bodies, two to a body. There were Thomas Boyd's feet, the assorted\ntwelve feet of six FBI agents, and three pairs that belonged to Alexis\nBrubitsch, Ivan Borbitsch and Vasili Garbitsch. Brubitsch looked even\nfatter than ever, Borbitsch even thinner. Garbitsch was of an\nindeterminate middling shape; he had grey hair and a pair of\npince-nez, and he walked a trifle unevenly, like a duck, with his\nhands clasped low in front of him. He was looking down at the ground\nas the crowd shoved him along.\n\nWhen the crowd neared the steps, Luba went over to him. Garbitsch\nlooked up, with a pleasant, somehow wistful smile on his face. \"Hello,\nLuba, my child,\" he said.\n\nLuba smiled, too. \"Hello, Dad,\" she said. \"All ready to go?\"\n\n\"Certainly I am ready,\" he said. \"I am all packed. We take off in a\nfew minutes. And you, Luba, my child?\"\n\n\"Fine, Dad,\" she said.\n\nShe looked down. \"They've got handcuffs on you,\" she said. \"Why,\nthat's--\"\n\nGarbitsch shrugged. He looked even more wistful. \"A formality,\" he\nsaid. \"It makes no difference.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Boyd said suddenly. \"We've got to get out of here pretty soon,\nand you'll be taking off. Let's break it up. Miss Thompson, you and\nLuba go aboard. Malone, you follow with the others.\"\n\nMalone rounded up Brubitsch, Borbitsch and Garbitsch and followed the\nladies aboard.\n\nHe came back to the door then, and stuck his head out. \"The keys,\" he\nsaid.\n\nBoyd stared. \"What?\"\n\n\"The keys to the handcuffs,\" Malone said. \"I'll need 'em.\"\n\n\"You're going to take them off when they get to Russia?\" Boyd said.\n\nMalone shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"Now.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I think we'll have plenty of warning if they decide to try anything,\nTom,\" Malone said quietly. \"Her Majesty, after all, is keeping them\nunder surveillance.\"\n\nWithout another word, Boyd tossed up the keys. Malone caught and\npocketed them. \"I'll be back as soon as possible,\" he said.\n\"Meanwhile, you can keep digging on other stuff--what we've discussed\nand anything it seems to lead into.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Boyd said. \"Stay out of trouble, Ken. So long.\"\n\nMalone nodded and ducked back into the plane. He unlocked the\nhandcuffs, and Brubitsch and Borbitsch immediately went and sat down\nmournfully together at the back of the plane. Malone looked for Lou,\nbut she was already seated--with Her Majesty, naturally. He sighed\nbriefly and sat down, at last, next to the wistful Garbitsch.\n\n\"It will be nice to see Russia again,\" Garbitsch said. \"I hardly hoped\nto do so.\"\n\nThe plane shuddered, roared and took off. Then it settled down to its\nnormal state of unnatural quiet. Malone sat back and tried to relax.\n\nIt was impossible.\n\n\n7\n\nRed Square was, somehow, disappointing. It was crowded with men and\nwomen, all looking very Russian in an undefined sort of way, and the\nbig glass windows sparkled from every side. \"I know it's silly,\" Luba\nsaid in a baffled voice, \"but, somehow, I always expected Red Square\nto be red.\"\n\n\"And why should that be?\" the MVD man next to her said. He was a burly\nman with a sour expression, as if he had eaten too many onions the day\nbefore.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"it is Red Square, after all.\"\n\n\"But red is symbolic only,\" the MVD man said surlily. \"Is not color.\nOnly symbol of glorious Russia.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Luba said. \"But it's still disappointing.\"\n\n\"You expect, perhaps, that we recruit our glorious Red Army from\nAmerican Indian tribes?\" the MVD man said sourly. \"You are\nliteral-minded bourgeois intellectual. This is not good thing to be.\"\n\n\"Somehow,\" Malone mused, \"I didn't think it was.\"\n\n\"But this is different,\" Luba said. \"The Red Army is made up of\nRussians. But this is just a square. You could paint it.\"\n\n\"After all,\" Malone offered, \"the White House is white, isn't it?\"\n\n\"White is cowardly color,\" the MVD man pointed out with satisfaction.\n\n\"Never mind that,\" Malone said. \"We call it a white house, and it is a\nwhite house. You call this a red square, and it isn't even pink. Not\neven a little bit pink. It's just--just--\"\n\n\"Just building-colored,\" Luba put in. Malone turned to her and\nexecuted a small bow.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he said.\n\n\"Think nothing of it,\" Luba said.\n\n\"Oh, don't worry,\" Malone said. \"I will.\"\n\nThe MVD man hissed like a teakettle and both heads swung round to look\nat him again. Her Majesty, who had been admiring some dresses in a\nshop window, also turned. \"My goodness,\" she said. \"That's a terrible\nwheeze. Do you take something for it?\"\n\n\"Is not wheeze,\" the MVD man said. \"Is noise representing impatience\nwith arrogance and stupidity of capitalist warmonger conversation.\"\n\n\"Arrogance?\" Luba said.\n\n\"Stupidity?\" Malone said.\n\nHer Majesty drew herself to her full height. \"We do not monger war,\"\nshe said. \"Not in the least. We are not mongers.\"\n\nThe MVD man looked at her, blinked, sighed and looked away. \"This\ncolor discussion,\" he said, \"it is very silly. Look at the Blue Ridge\nMountains, in your country. Are they blue?\"\n\n\"Well--\" Malone said.\n\n\"What color, for example, is the Golden Gate Bridge?\" the MVD man\ncontinued, with heavy sarcasm. \"Is not even a gate. Is a bridge. Is\nnot golden. But you say we disappoint. No. You disappoint.\"\n\nThere seemed to be no immediate answer to that, so Malone didn't try\nfor one. Instead, he went back to looking at the Square, and beyond it\nto where the inverted turnips of the Kremlin gleamed in the moonlight.\nThe turnips were very pretty, if a little odd for building-tops. But\nRed Square, in spite of all its historic associations, seemed to be a\nlittle dull. The buildings were just buildings, and the streets were\nfilled with Russians. They were not bomb-throwing Russians, bearded\nRussians or even \"Volga Boatman\"-singing Russians. They were just\nordinary, dull Russians of every sort, shade, race, color and previous\ncondition of servitude.\n\nIt was just about what he'd expected after the trip. That hadn't been\nexciting either, he told himself. There had been no incident of any\nkind. None of the three spies seemed to be exactly overjoyed about\nbeing sent back to good old Mother Russia, but none seemed inclined to\nmake much fuss about the matter, either. Malone had blandly told them\nthat they were being deported, instead of tried, because there was no\nevidence that was worth the expense of a trial. And, besides that, he\nhad particularly emphasized that the FBI did not believe any of the\nstories the three men had told.\n\n\"They just don't match up,\" he said. \"You all told different stories,\nand there's too much disagreement between them. Frankly, we don't\nbelieve any of them--not yet, we don't. But mark my words. We'll find\nout the truth some day.\"\n\nHe'd thought it was a good speech, and Her Majesty had agreed with\nhim. It had its desired effect, since the plane was the first place\nthe three had had a chance to meet since their arrest. \"Each one knows\nthat he told the truth,\" Her Majesty said, \"but nobody knows what the\nother two said.\"\n\n\"That's what I figured,\" Malone said. \"They didn't have a chance to\ntalk to each other.\"\n\n\"And so each one is lying his head off to the others,\" Her Majesty\nsaid, \"and telling them all about how he, too, lied gloriously and\nbravely in defense of the Motherland. It's really very funny.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"it makes them happy. And why not?\"\n\nLuba, too, had chatted with her father quite a lot of the time. Her\nMajesty reported that none of this conversation could possibly be\nunderstood as dangerous or harmful. It was just simple conversation.\n\nOf course, Luba and her father hadn't talked all the time, and Malone\ndid have a chance to get a few words in edgewise. Her Majesty made no\nreport on those conversations, but Malone was comfortably aware that\nthey did not belong in the harmless class. His relationship with the\ngirl seemed, he told himself happily, to be improving slightly. Now\nand again, he even won a round from her.\n\nAs the American plane crossed the border, it was picked up by an\nescort of Russian fighter craft, which stuck with them all the way\ninto Moscow. The fighters didn't do anything; they were just there,\nMalone figured, for insurance. But they made him nervous when he\nlooked out the window. The trip from the border to Moscow seemed to\ntake a long time.\n\nThen, at the airfield, a group of MVD men had almost elbowed the\nAmerican Embassy delegation out of the way in greeting the\ndisembarking little band. There was a lot of palaver, in Russian,\nEnglish and various scrambled mixtures which nobody understood. The\nAmerican delegation greeted Malone, Luba and Her Majesty formally, and\nthe MVD concentrated on Brubitsch, Borbitsch and Garbitsch. The three\nspies were hustled away, apparently to MVD Headquarters, without much\nfuss. Luba said goodbye to her father calmly enough, and Vasili\nGarbitsch seemed almost entirely unaffected by his surroundings. As\nthe plane touched ground, he had said: \"Ah, the soil of Mother\nRussia,\" but, outside of a goodbye or two, those were his last words\nbefore leaving.\n\nOne MVD man stayed behind, even after the American delegation had\nleft. His name, he explained, was Vladimir Josefovitch Petkoff. \"It\nwill be my pleasure to show your group the many historic and\ninteresting sights of Moskva,\" he announced to Malone.\n\n\"Pleasure?\" Malone said. Petkoff was tall and heavy, and wore a row of\nmedals that strung out across his chest like a newspaper headline.\n\n\"My duty,\" Petkoff said flatly, \"is my pleasure. That is how we\narrange matters in Russia.\"\n\nAnd so the tour had started, with Red Square. Malone told himself he\ndidn't really mind if it weren't red, but he did think it could at\nleast look sinister. Unfortunately, the Square did not seem\nparticularly willing to oblige.\n\n\"So this is Red Square,\" Malone said, after a long silence.\n\n\"You do not sound interested,\" Petkoff said in what sounded like a\nvaguely ominous voice. \"Because it is not painted in capitalistic and\nobvious colors, it bores you?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Malone said. \"But when you've seen one Square, you've\nseen them all, is how I feel about it. There must be somewhere else to\nsight-see.\"\n\n\"Somewhere?\" Petkoff said. \"There is everywhere. This is Moskva, the\ncapital and the greatest city in Mother Russia. That is what we are\ntold to say.\" He lowered his voice. \"Personally,\" he added, \"I come\nfrom Leningrad. I prefer it. But in Moskva one talks only of Moskva.\"\n\n\"I know just how you feel,\" Malone assured him. \"I've been to San\nFrancisco.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" Petkoff said, almost smiling at him. \"What is there you\nwould like to see?\"\n\nMalone fished in his pocket for an American cigarette. He'd brought a\ncarton with him, having once tried Russian makes. They seemed to be\nmostly cardboard, both the long filter and the tobacco. He lit the\ncigarette and thought for a second. \"I don't suppose,\" he said\ncautiously, \"that we could take a look around inside the Kremlin,\ncould we?\"\n\n\"Aha,\" Petkoff said. \"I see what is in your mind.\"\n\n\"You do?\" Malone said, startled.\n\n\"Naturally,\" Petkoff said. \"You wish to see the tomb of Lenin. It is\nfamous throughout the world.\"\n\nMalone considered that for a minute. \"Somehow,\" he said cautiously,\n\"the coffin of Lenin doesn't exactly sound like a gay start for\nsight-seeing.\"\n\nPetkoff looked pleased instantly. \"I understand,\" he said. \"Truly I\nunderstand. You, too, feel sad over the death of the great Lenin. How\nbeautiful! How cultured!\"\n\nMalone wondered whether or not to disillusion the man, and decided\nagainst it. \"Well, something like that,\" he said vaguely.\n\n\"I'll tell you what: is there a restaurant around here where we could\nget something to eat?\"\n\n\"To eat?\" Petkoff said, still looking pleased. \"You wish to eat?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I'm rather hungry, and I guess the ladies must\nbe, too.\"\n\n\"What?\" Luba said, returning to the group. She had joined Her Majesty\nin viewing the display of dresses. The Queen came scurrying over, too,\nthrough the silent and jostling Russian crowds.\n\n\"I was suggesting a restaurant,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Best idea anybody's had all day,\" Lou said. Her Majesty graciously\nconsented to agree, and Petkoff beamed like the rising sun.\n\n\"My friends,\" he said. \"My very fine friends--although you are\ncapitalistic bourgeois intellectuals, thrown aside by the path of\nprogress--in Moskva we have the finest restaurants in all the world.\"\n\n\"How about ... oh, Leningrad?\" Malone said in a low voice.\n\n\"In Leningrad,\" Petkoff admitted, \"the restaurants are better. But in\nMoskva, the restaurants are very good indeed. Much better than one\nmight expect, if one knows Leningrad.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I suppose we've just got to put up with Moscow.\"\n\nThey went back to the corner, and hailed the long, black,\nsleek-looking limousine that had brought them in from the airport. The\ntwo silent men in the front seat of the gleaming Volga sedan were\nwaiting patiently. Malone, Her Majesty and Lou got into the back,\nPetkoff in front. The two men were as still as statues--and rather\nunpleasant-looking statues, Malone thought--until Petkoff snapped\nsomething in Russian. Then one of them, at the wheel, said: _\"Da,\nTovarishch.\"_\n\nThe car started down the Moscow streets.\n\nHer Majesty was silent and somewhat abstracted during the ride, just\nas she had been during the entire trip so far. She was, Malone knew,\nprying into every mind she could touch. He smiled inwardly when he\nthought about that.\n\nThe MVD, all unbeknownst to itself, was busily carrying around and\nprotecting the single most dangerous spy in Moscow.\n\nNobody else spoke, either, until the car was moving along at a good\nclip. Petkoff began some small talk then, but it wasn't very\ninteresting until he finally managed to edge it around to the subject\nhe really wanted to talk about.\n\n\"By the way, Mr. Malone,\" he said, in a voice that sounded as if\nPetkoff were trying to establish an offhand manner, and not succeeding\nin the least. \"It was thoughtful, very thoughtful, of American\ngovernment, to return to us those men. Very kind.\"\n\nMalone's expression conveyed nothing but the sheerest good will.\n\"Well, you know how it is,\" he said. \"Anything we can do to preserve\npeace and amity between our countries--we'll do it. You know that.\nGetting along, coexistence, that sort of thing. Oh, we're glad to\noblige.\"\n\n\"I am sure,\" Petkoff said darkly. \"You realize, of course, that they\nare criminals? Deserters from Red Army, embezzlers. Embezzlers of\nmoney.\"\n\nWondering vaguely what else you could be an embezzler of, Malone\nnodded. \"That's what your ambassador in Washington said, when we told\nhim about the deportation order.\"\n\n\"But Dad's not an embezzler,\" Luba broke in. \"Or a deserter, either.\nHe--\"\n\n\"We have the records,\" Petkoff said.\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Ordinarily, Mr. Malone,\" Petkoff said pointedly, \"we do not find it\nthe policy of the American government to send back political\nrefugees.\"\n\n\"Now, listen,\" Lou said. \"If you think you can shut me up--\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I think,\" Petkoff said. \"Let me assure you that\nno offense has been intended.\"\n\nLou opened her mouth and started to say something. Then she shut it\nagain. \"Well,\" she said, \"I guess this isn't the time to argue about\nit. I'm sorry, Mr. Petkoff.\"\n\nThe MVD man beamed back at her. \"Call me Vladimir,\" he said.\n\nMalone broke in hastily. \"You see, Major,\" he said, \"these men are all\nembezzlers, as you've said yourself. We have the word of your\ngovernment on that.\"\n\nPetkoff took his eyes off Lou with what seemed real reluctance. \"Oh,\"\nhe said. \"Yes. Of course you do.\"\n\n\"Therefore,\" Malone said smoothly, \"the three are criminals and not\npolitical refugees.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Petkoff said blandly. \"Very interesting. Your government has\ndone a good deal of thinking in this matter.\"\n\n\"Sure we have,\" Malone said. \"After all, we don't want to cause any\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"No,\" Petkoff said, and frowned. \"Of course not.\"\n\n\"Naturally,\" Malone said.\n\nAfter that, there was silence for almost a full minute. Then Major\nPetkoff turned to Malone again with a frown. \"Wait,\" he said.\n\n\"Wait?\" Malone said.\n\n\"The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,\" Petkoff said, \"has no\nextradition treaty with your capitalist warmongering country.\"\n\n\"We're not warmongers,\" Her Majesty put in. Both men ignored her.\n\n\"True,\" Malone admitted.\n\n\"Then there was no reason to send these men back to us,\" Petkoff said.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" Malone said. \"There was a very good reason. You see, we\ndidn't want them in our country, either.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"And when we found that they'd lied on their naturalization papers,\nwhy, naturally, we took immediate steps. The only steps we could take,\nas a matter of fact.\"\n\n\"The only steps?\" Petkoff said. \"You could have preferred charges.\nThis was not done. Why was it not done?\"\n\n\"That,\" Malone said, sidestepping neatly, \"is a matter of governmental\npolicy, Major Petkoff. And I can't provide any final answer.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" Petkoff said.\n\n\"But, after all, a trial would not make sense,\" Malone said, now\nbusily attacking from the side. \"You see, at first we thought they\nwere espionage agents.\"\n\n\"A foolish conclusion,\" Petkoff said uneasily.\n\nMalone nodded. \"That's what we finally realized,\" he said. \"We\nquestioned them, but their stories were nonsense, absolute nonsense.\nOf course, we had no idea of what foreign government might have\nemployed them.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Petkoff said, shifting slightly in his seat. The car\ntook a wide curve and swayed slightly, and Malone found himself nearly\nin Lou's lap. The sensation was so pleasant that all conversation was\ndelayed for a couple of seconds, until the car had righted itself.\n\n\"So,\" Malone went on when he had straightened out, \"we decided to save\nourselves the expense of a trial.\"\n\n\"Very natural,\" Petkoff said. The slight delay had apparently allowed\nhim to recover his own mental balance. \"The capitalist countries think\nonly of money.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said agreeably. \"Well, anyhow, that's the way it was.\nThere was no point, really, in putting them in prison--what for? What\ngood could it do us?\"\n\n\"Who knows?\" Petkoff said.\n\n\"Exactly,\" Malone said. \"So, since all we wanted to do was get rid of\nthem, and since we had an easy way to do that, why, we took it, that's\nall, and shipped them here.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Petkoff said. \"And the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is\nproperly grateful.\"\n\n\"My goodness,\" Her Majesty put in, apparently out of an irrepressible\nsense of fun. \"Maybe we'll get medals.\"\n\n\"Medals,\" Petkoff said sternly, \"are not given to capitalist\nagitators.\"\n\n\"We are not agitated,\" Her Majesty said, and folded her hands in her\nlap, looking quite satisfied with herself.\n\nPetkoff thought for a second. \"And why,\" he said, \"did you feel that\nsuch elaborate precautions were necessary in returning these men to\nus?\"\n\nMalone shrugged. \"Well, we couldn't have them just running around all\nover the world, could we?\" he said. \"We felt that here they'd be\nproperly housed and fed, in their own homeland, even if they didn't\nget a job.\"\n\n\"They will be properly taken care of,\" Petkoff prophesied darkly.\n\n\"Now, wait a minute--\" Lou began, and then stopped. \"Sorry,\" she said.\n\nMalone felt sorry for her, but there was nothing he could say to make\nthings any better. \"Exactly,\" he told Petkoff with what he hoped was a\nsmile.\n\n\"Ah, well,\" Petkoff said. \"My friend and colleague, we should cease\nthis shoptalk. Shoptalk?\"\n\n\"Quite correct,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I have studied English a long time,\" Petkoff said. \"It is not a\nlogical language.\"\n\n\"You're doing very well,\" Malone said. Petkoff gave him a military\nduck of the head.\n\n\"I appreciate your compliments,\" he said. \"But I fear we are boring\nthe ladies.\"\n\nThe major had timed his speech well. At that moment, the ornate Volga\npulled up to a smooth stop before a large, richly decorated building\nthat glowed brightly under the electric lights of a large sign. The\nsign said something incomprehensible in Cyrillic script. Under it, the\nbuilding entrance was gilded and carved into fantastic rococo shapes.\nMalone stared at the sign, and was about to ask a question about it\nwhen Petkoff spoke.\n\n\"Trotkin's,\" he said. \"The finest restaurant in all the world--in\nMoskva, this is what they say of it.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Come,\" Petkoff said grandly, and got out of the car. One of the two\nsilent men leaped out and opened the back door, and Her Majesty, Lou\nand Malone climbed out and stood blinking on the sidewalk under the\nsign.\n\nPetkoff leaned over and said something to the driver. The second\nsilent man got back into the car, and it drove away down the street,\nturned a corner and disappeared. The party of four started toward the\nentrance of the restaurant.\n\nThe door swung open before Major Petkoff reached it. A doorman was\nholding it, and bowing to each of the four as they passed. He was\ndressed in Victorian livery, complete to knee-breeches and lace, and\nMalone thought this was rather odd for the classless Russian society.\nBut the doorman was only the opening note of a great symphony.\n\nInside, there were tables and chairs--or at least, Malone told\nhimself, that's what he thought they were. They were massive wood\naffairs, carved into tortuous shapes and gilded or painted in all\nsorts of colors that glittered madly under the barrage of several\nelectric chandeliers.\n\nThe chandeliers hung from a frescoed ceiling, and looked much too\nheavy. They swayed and tinkled in time to the music that filled the\nroom, but for a second Malone looked past them at the ceiling. It\nappeared to represent some sort of Russian heaven, at the end of the\nFive-Year Plan. There were officers and ladies eating grapes,\nwaltzing, strolling on white puffy clouds, singing, drinking, making\nlove. There was an awful lot of activity going on up on the ceiling,\nand it wasn't until Malone lowered his gaze that he realized that none\nof this activity had been exaggerated.\n\nTrue, there were no white puffy clouds, and he couldn't immediately\nlocate a bunch of grapes anywhere. But there were the musicians, in\nthe same Victorian outfits as the doorman: three fiddlers, a cellist,\nand a man who played piano. \"Just like in night-clubs in bourgeois\nParis,\" Petkoff said, following Malone's gaze with every evidence of\npride.\n\nBetween the musicians and Malone were a lot of tables and chairs and\nancient, proud-looking waiters who appeared to have been hired when\nTrotkin's had opened--and that, Malone thought, had been a long, long\ntime ago. He felt like those two ladies, whose names he couldn't\nremember, who said they'd slipped back in time. Officers and their\nladies, the men in glittering uniforms, the ladies in ball dresses of\nevery imaginable shade, cut, material and degree of exposure, were\nwaltzing around the room looking very polite and old-world. Others\nwere sitting at the tables, where candles fluttered, completely\nuseless in the electric glare. The noise was something terrific, but,\nsomehow, it was all very well-bred.\n\nThe headwaiter was suddenly next to them. He hadn't walked there, at\nleast not noticeably; he appeared to have perfected the old-world\nmanner of the silent servant. Or, of course, Malone thought, the man\nmight be a teleport.\n\n\"Ah, Major Petkoff,\" he said, in a silken voice. \"It is so good to see\nyou again. And your friends?\"\n\n\"Americans,\" Petkoff said. \"They have come to see the glorious Soviet\nUnion.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" the headwaiter said. \"Your usual table, Major?\"\n\nPetkoff nodded. The headwaiter led the party through the dancers,\nsnaking slowly along until they reached a large table near the\nmusicians and at the edge of the dance floor. Her Majesty\nautomatically took the seat nearest the musicians, which she imagined\nto be the head of the table. Lou sat at her left hand, and Malone at\nher right, his back against a wall. Petkoff took the foot of the\ntable, called a waiter over, and ordered for the party. He did a\nmassive job of it, with two waiters, at last, taking down what seemed\nto be his entire memoirs, plus the list of all soldiers in the Red\nArmy below the rank of Grand Exalted Elk, or whatever it might have\nbeen. Malone had no idea what the major was ordering, except that it\nsounded extensive and very, very Russian.\n\nFinally the waiter went on his way. Major Petkoff turned to Malone and\nsmiled. \"Naturally,\" he said, \"we will begin with vodka, _nyet_?\"\n\nMalone considered saying _nyet,_ but he didn't feel that this was the\ntime or the place. Besides, he told himself grimly, it would be a sad\nday when a Petkoff could drink a Malone under the table. His proudest\nheritage from his father was an immense capacity, he told himself. Now\nwas his chance to test it.\n\n\"And, naturally, a little caviar to go with it,\" Petkoff added.\n\n\"Certainly,\" Malone said, as if caviar were the most common thing in\nthe world in his usual Washington saloons.\n\nIt wasn't long before the waiter reappeared, bringing four glasses and\nthree bottles of vodka chilled in an ice-bucket, like a bouquet of\nchampagne. Petkoff bowed him out after one bottle had been opened, set\nthe glasses up and began to pour.\n\n\"Oh, goodness,\" Her Majesty started to say.\n\n\"None for me, thanks,\" Lou chimed in.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" Her Majesty said. \"I don't think I'll have any either. An\nold lady has to be very careful of her system, you know.\"\n\n\"You do not look like an old lady,\" Petkoff said gallantly.\n\"Middle-aged, perhaps, to be cruel. But certainly not old. Not over\n... oh, perhaps forty.\"\n\nHer Majesty smiled politely at him. Malone began to wonder if it had\nbeen gallantry, after all. From what he'd seen of the Russian women,\nit was likely, after all, that Petkoff really thought Her Majesty\nwasn't much over forty at that.\n\n\"You're very flattering, Major,\" Her Majesty said. \"But I assure you\nthat I'm a good deal older than I look.\"\n\nMalone tried to tell himself that no one else had noticed the stifled\ngulp that had followed that remark. It had been his own stifled gulp.\nAnd his face, he felt sure, had aged one hundred and twelve years\nwithin a second or so. He waited for Her Majesty to tell Major Petkoff\njust how old she really was...\n\nBut she said nothing else. After a second she turned and smiled at\nMalone.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, you're quite welcome,\" she said.\n\nPetkoff frowned at both of them, shrugged, and readied the bottle.\n\"Well, then,\" he said. \"It seems as if the drinking will be done by\nmen--and that is right. Vodka is the drink for men.\"\n\nHe had filled his own glass full of the cold, clear liquid. Now he\nfilled Malone's. He stood, glass in hand. Malone also climbed to his\nfeet.\n\n\"To the continued friendship of our two countries!\" Petkoff said. He\nraised his glass for a second, then downed the contents. Malone\nfollowed suit. The vodka burned its merry way into his stomach. They\nsat.\n\nA waiter arrived with a large platter. \"Ah,\" Petkoff said, turning.\n\"Try some of this caviar, Mr. Malone. You will find it the finest in\nthe world.\"\n\nMalone, somehow, had never managed to develop a taste for caviar. He\nwas willing to admit, if pressed, that this made him an uncultured\nslob, but caviar always made him think of the joke about the country\nbumpkin who thought it was marvelous that you could soften up buckshot\njust by soaking it in fish oil.\n\nNow, though, he felt he had to be polite, and he tried some of the\nstuff. All things considered, it wasn't quite as bad as he'd thought\nit was going to be. And it did make a pretty good chaser for the\nvodka.\n\nHer Majesty also helped herself to some caviar. \"My goodness,\" she\nsaid. \"This reminds me of the old days.\"\n\nMalone waited, once again, with bated breath. But, though Her Majesty\nmay have been crazy, she wasn't stupid. She said nothing more.\n\nPetkoff, meanwhile, refilled the glasses and looked expectantly at\nMalone. This time it was his turn to propose the toast. He thought for\na second, then stood up and raised his glass.\n\n\"To the most beautiful woman in all the world,\" he said, feeling just\na little like a character in _War and Peace_. \"Luba Vasilovna\nGarbitsch.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Petkoff said, smiling approvingly. Malone executed a little bow\nin Lou's direction and followed Petkoff in downing the drink. Two more\nglasses of vodka wended their tortuous ways into the interior.\n\n\"Tell me, colleague,\" Petkoff said as be spooned up some more caviar,\n\"how are things in the United States?\"\n\nMalone shot a glance at Her Majesty, but she was concentrating on\nsomething else, and her eyes seemed far away. \"Oh, all right,\" he said\nat last.\n\n\"Of course, you must say so,\" Petkoff murmured. \"But, as one colleague\nto another, tell me: how much longer do you think it will be before\nthe proletarian uprising in your country?\"\n\nThere were a lot of answers to that, Malone told himself. But he chose\none without too much difficulty. \"Well, that's hard to judge,\" he\nsaid. \"I'd hate to make any prediction. I don't have enough\ninformation.\"\n\n\"Not enough information?\" Petkoff said. \"I don't understand.\"\n\nMalone shrugged. \"Since our proletariat,\" he said, \"have shown no sign\nof wanting any rebellion at all, how can I predict when they're going\nto rebel?\"\n\nPetkoff gave him an unbelieving smile. \"Well,\" he said. \"We must have\npatience, eh, colleague?\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" Malone said, watching Petkoff pour more vodka.\n\nBy the time the meal came, Malone was feeling a warm glow in his\ninterior, but no real fogginess. The dance floor had been cleared by\nthis time, and a group of six costumed professionals glided out and\ntook places. The musicians broke out into a thunderous and bumpy\npiece, and the dancers began some sort of Slavic folk dance that\nlooked like a combination of a _kazotska_ and a shivaree. Malone\nwatched them with interest. They looked like good dancers, but they\nseemed to be plagued with clumsiness; they were always crashing into\none another. On the other hand, Malone thought, maybe it was part of\nthe dance. It was hard to tell.\n\nThe dinner was as extensive as anything Malone had ever dreamed of:\n_borshcht_, beef Stroganoff, smoked fish, vegetables in gigantic\ntureens, ices and cheeses and fruits. And always, between the courses,\nduring the courses and at every available moment, there was vodka.\n\nThe drinking didn't bother him too much. But the food was too much.\nUnbelieving, he watched Petkoff polish off a large red apple, a pear\nand a small wedge of white, creamy-looking cheese at the end of the\ntowering meal. Her Majesty was staring, too, in a very polite manner.\nLou simply looked glassy-eyed and overstuffed. Malone felt a good deal\nof sympathy for her.\n\nPetkoff finished the wedge of cheese and ripped off a belch of\nincredible magnitude and splendor. Malone felt he should applaud, but\nmanaged to restrain himself. Her Majesty looked startled for a second,\nand then regained her composure. Only Lou seemed to take the event as\na matter of course, which set Malone to wondering about her home-life.\nSomehow he couldn't picture her wistful little father ever producing a\nsound of such awesome magnitude.\n\n\"My dear colleague,\" Petkoff was saying. Malone turned to him and\ntried to look interested. \"There is one thing I have wondered for many\nyears.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Malone said politely.\n\n\"That is right,\" Petkoff said. \"For years, there has never been a\nchange of name in your organization of secret police.\"\n\n\"We're not secret police,\" Malone said.\n\nPetkoff gave a massive shrug. \"Naturally,\" he said, \"one must say\nthis. But surely, one tires of being called FBI all the time.\"\n\n\"One does?\" Malone said. \"I don't know. It gives a person a sort of\nsense of security.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Petkoff said. \"But take us, for instance. We pride ourselves on\nour ability to camouflage ourselves. GPU, and then OGPU--which were, I\nunderstand, subject for many capitalist jokes.\"\n\nMalone tried to look as if he couldn't imagine such a thing. \"I\nsuppose they might have been,\" he said.\n\n\"Then we were NKVD,\" Petkoff said, \"and now MVD. And I understand,\nquite between us, Mr. Malone, that there is talk of further change.\"\n\nThere was a sudden burst of applause. Malone wondered what for, looked\nat the dance floor and realized that the six Slavic dancers were\ntaking bows. As he watched, one of them slipped and nearly fell. The\nmusicians obliged with a final series of chords and the dancers\ntrotted away. A waltz began, and couples from the tables began\ncrowding the floor.\n\n\"How can you manage the proletariat,\" Petkoff asked, \"if you do not\nkeep them confused?\"\n\n\"We don't, exactly,\" Malone said. \"They more or less manage us.\"\n\n\"Ha,\" Petkoff said, dismissing this with a wave of his hand.\n\"Propaganda.\" And then he, too, turned to watch the dancers. The waltz\nwas finishing, and a fox-trot had begun. \"With your permission, Mr.\nMalone,\" he said, rising, \"I should like to ask so-lovely Miss\nGarbitsch to dance with me.\"\n\nMalone glanced at the girl. She gave him a quick smile, with just a\nhint of nervousness or strain in it, and turned to Petkoff. \"I'd be\ndelighted, Major,\" she said. Malone shut his own mouth. As the girl\nrose, he got to his feet and gave the couple a small, Victorian bow.\nPetkoff and Lou walked to the floor, and Malone, sitting down again,\nwatched enviously as he took her in his arms and began to guide her\nexpertly across the floor in time to the music.\n\nMalone sighed. Some men, he told himself, had all the luck. But, of\ncourse, Lou had to be polite, too. She didn't really like Petkoff, he\ntold himself; she was just being diplomatic. And he had made some\nprogress with her on the plane, he thought.\n\nHe looked over at Her Majesty, but the Queen was staring abstractedly\nat a crystal chandelier. Malone sighed again, took a little caviar and\nwashed it down with vodka. The vodka felt nice and warm, he thought\nvaguely. Vodka was good. It was too bad that the people who made such\ngood vodka had to be enemies. But that was the way things were, he\ntold himself philosophically.\n\nTerrible. That's how things were.\n\nThe fox-trot went to its conclusion. Malone saw Petkoff, chatting\nanimatedly with Lou, lead her off to a small bar at the opposite side\nof the room. \"Some people,\" he muttered, \"have too much luck. Or too\nmuch diplomacy.\"\n\nHer Majesty was tugging at his arm. That, Malone thought, was going to\nbe more bad news.\n\nIt was.\n\n\"Sir Kenneth,\" she said softly, \"do you realize that this place is\nfull of MVD men? Of course you don't; I haven't told you yet.\"\n\nMalone opened his mouth, shut it again, and thought in a hurry. If the\nplace were full of MVD men, that meant they probably had it bugged.\nAnd that meant several things, all of them unpleasant. Her Majesty\nshouldn't have said anything--she shouldn't have shown any nervousness\nor anxiety in the first place, she shouldn't have known there were so\nmany MVD men in the second place--because there was no way for her to\nknow, except through her telepathy, a little secret Malone did not\nwant the Russians to find out about. And she should definitely, most\ndefinitely, not have called him \"Sir Kenneth.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Her Majesty said. \"I am sorry, Sir--er--Mr. Malone. You're quite\nright, you know.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Well. My goodness.\" He thought of something to\nsay, and said it at once. \"Of course there are MVD men here. This is\njust the place for good old MVD men to come when they go off duty. A\nnice, relaxing place full of fun and dancing and food and vodka...\"\nAnd he was thinking, at the same time: _Are they doing anything odd?_\n\n\"Russian, you know,\" Her Majesty said, almost conversationally, \"is an\nextremely difficult language. It takes a great deal of practice to\nlearn to think in it really fluently.\"\n\n\"Yes, I should think it would,\" Malone said absently. _You mean you\nhaven't been able to pick up what these people are thinking?_\n\n\"Oh, one can get the main outlines,\" Her Majesty went on, \"but a\nreally full knowledge is nearly impossible. Though, of course, it\nisn't quite as bad as all that. A man who speaks both languages, like\nour dear Major Petkoff, for instance--so charming, so full of _joie de\nvivre_--could be an invaluable assistant to anyone interested in\nlearning exactly how Russians really think.\" She smiled nervously. Her\nface was suddenly set and strained. \"I find that--\"\n\nShe stopped then, very suddenly. Her eyes widened, and her right hand\nreached out to grasp Malone's arm more strongly than he had thought\nshe ever could. \"Sir Kenneth!\" Her voice, all restraint gone, was a\nhissing whisper. Malone started to say something, but Her Majesty went\non, her eyes wide. \"Do something quickly!\" she said.\n\n\"What?\" Malone said.\n\n\"They've put something in Lou's drink!\" Her Majesty hissed.\n\nMalone was on his feet before she'd finished, and he took a step\nacross the room.\n\n\"She's already swallowed it!\" the Queen said. \"Do something! Quickly!\"\n\nThe dancers on the floor were no concern of his, Malone told himself\ngrimly. He didn't decide to move; he was on his way before any thought\nfiltered through into his mind. Officers and their ladies looked after\nhim with shocked stupor as he plowed his way across the dance floor,\nusing legs, elbows, shoulders and anything else that allowed him free\npassage. Sometimes the dancers managed to get out of his way.\nSometimes they didn't. It was all the same to Kenneth J. Malone.\n\nHer Majesty followed in his wake, silent and stricken, scurrying after\nhim like a small destroyer following a battleship, or like a\nball-carrying grandmother following up her interference.\n\nMalone caught sight of Lou, standing at the bar. In that second, she\nseemed to realize for the first time that something was wrong. She\npushed herself violently away from the bar, and looked frantically\naround, her mouth opening to call. Petkoff was a blur next to her;\nMalone didn't look at him clearly. Lou took a step...\n\nAnd two men with broken, lumpy faces came through a door somewhere in\nthe rear of the restaurant, closer to her than Malone. Petkoff\nsuddenly swam into sight; he was standing very still and looking\nentirely baffled.\n\nMalone pushed through a pair of dancers, ignored their glares and the\nman's hissed insult, which he didn't understand anyhow, and found his\nview suddenly blocked by a large expanse of dark grey.\n\nIt was somebody's chest, in a uniform. Malone shifted his gaze half an\ninch and saw a row of gold buttons. He looked upward.\n\nThere, towering above him, was a face. It stared down, looking heavy\nand cruel and stupid. Malone, his legs still carrying him forward,\nbounced off the chest and staggered back a step or two. He heard a\nhissed curse behind him, and realized without thinking about it that\nhe had managed to collide with the same pair of dancers again. He\ndidn't look around to see them. Instead, he looked ahead, at the giant\nwho blocked his path.\n\nThe man was about six feet six inches tall, a great Mongol who weighed\nabout a sixth of a ton. But he didn't look fat; he looked strong\ninstead, and enormously massive. Malone sidestepped, and the Mongol\nmoved slightly to block him. To one side, Malone saw Her Majesty\nscurrying by. The Mongol was apparently more interested in Malone than\nin trying to stop sweet little old ladies. Malone saw Her Majesty\nheading for the bar, and forgot about her for the second.\n\nThe Mongol shifted again to block Malone's forward progress.\n\n\"What seems to be such great hurry, _Tovarishch_?\" he said in a voice\nthat sounded like an earthquake warning. \"Have you no culture? Why you\nrun across floor in such impolite manner?\"\n\nThe man might have been blocking his way because of Lou, or might\nsimply want to teach an uncultured _Amerikanski_ a lesson. Malone\ncouldn't tell which, and it didn't seem to matter. He whirled and\nreached for a glass of vodka standing momentarily unattended on a\nnearby table.\n\nHe tossed the vodka at the giant's eyes, and scooted around the\nmountain of flesh before it erupted with a volcanic succession of\nRussian curses that shook the room with their volume and sincerity.\n\nBut Lou and Her Majesty were nowhere in sight. Major Petkoff was\nstaring, and Malone followed his line of sight.\n\nA door in the rear of the restaurant was just closing. Behind it\nMalone saw Her Majesty and Lou, disappearing from sight.\n\nMalone knocked over a waiter and headed for Petkoff. \"What's going on\nhere?\" he bellowed over the crash of dishes and the rising wave of\nRussian profanity.\n\nPetkoff shrugged magnificently. \"I have no ideas, colleague,\" he said.\n\"I have no ideas.\"\n\n\"But she--\"\n\n\"Miss Garbitsch was taken suddenly ill,\" Petkoff said.\n\n\"Damn sudden,\" Malone growled.\n\n\"Her friend, Miss Thompson, has taken her to the ladies' room,\"\nPetkoff said. He gestured, narrowly missing a broken, lumpy face\nMalone had seen before.\n\n\"You are under arrest,\" the face said. Its partner peered over\nPetkoff's shoulder.\n\n\"I?\" Petkoff said.\n\n\"Not you,\" the face said. \"Him.\" He started for Malone and Petkoff\nthrew out both arms.\n\n\"Hold!\" he said. \"My orders are to see that this man is not molested.\"\n\nThe guests had suddenly and silently melted away. Malone backed off a\nstep, looking for something to stage a fight with.\n\n\"On the other hand, Comrade,\" one of the lumpy-faced men said, \"we\nhave orders also.\"\n\n\"My orders--\" Petkoff began.\n\n\"Your orders do not exist,\" the other lumpy man said. \"We are to\narrest this man. Our orders say so.\"\n\n\"You are fools,\" Petkoff said. He spread his arms wider, blocking both\nof them. Malone edged back against the bar, feeling behind him for a\nbottle or maybe a bungstarter. Instead, his hand touched a sleeve.\n\nA voice behind him bellowed: \"Cease!\"\n\nThe two lumpy-faced men goggled. Petkoff did not move.\n\nMalone turned, and saw a tall, thin civilian with dark glasses.\n\"Cease,\" the civilian repeated. \"It is the girl we are to arrest! The\ngirl!\"\n\n\"This is not a girl,\" one of the lumpy men said. \"Sir. We are to\narrest this man. Our orders say distinctly--\"\n\n\"Never mind your orders!\" Petkoff said. \"Go and reduce your orders to\nshreds and stuff them up your nostrils and die of suffocation! My\norders say--\"\n\n\"The girl!\" the civilian said. \"Where is the girl?\"\n\nMalone darted forward. Petkoff caught him neatly with one arm as he\nwent by. \"Until we decide what to do,\" the MVD man said, \"you stay\nhere.\" Malone bucked against him, but could get nowhere. \"Meanwhile,\"\nPetkoff said, \"I am for letting you go.\"\n\n\"I appreciate it,\" Malone said through his teeth. \"How about proving\nit?\"\n\n\"If you let him go,\" a lumpy man said, \"you will answer to our group\nhead.\"\n\nPetkoff tightened his hold protectively. Meanwhile, the civilian was\nclimbing up into a stratospheric rage.\n\n\"You are dolts, imbeciles, worms without brains and walking bellies\nfilled with carrion!\" he said magnificently. \"I have orders which I am\nsworn to carry out!\"\n\n\"You are not alone,\" Petkoff said.\n\nMalone took another try at a getaway, and failed.\n\n\"We take precedence,\" a lumpy man said. \"We can talk later. Arrest\ncomes first.\"\n\n\"But who?\" the civilian snapped. \"I insist--\"\n\n\"There shall be no arrest!\" Petkoff screamed. \"No one is to be\narrested at all!\"\n\n\"I swear by the bones of Stalin that my orders state--\" the tall man\nbegan.\n\n\"The bones of Stalin are with us!\" a lumpy man said. \"Go and die in a\nkennel filled with fleas and old newspaper! Go and freeze to the\nlikeness of an obscene statue of a bourgeois deity! Go and hang by the\nears from a monument four thousand feet high in the center of the\ngreat desert!\"\n\nInspired, the other lumpy man screamed \"Charge!\" and came for Petkoff\nand the civilian. Petkoff whirled, letting go of Malone in order to\nbeat back this wave of maddened attackers, and Malone took the\nadvantage. He ducked free under Petkoff's left arm and started around\nthe gesticulating, screaming, fighting group for the door at the back\nof the restaurant. He took exactly four steps.\n\nThen he stopped. The Mongol, his eyes red with a combination of vodka\nand bull-roaring rage, was charging toward him, his hands outflung and\nhis fingers grasping at the air. \"Warmonger!\" he was shouting.\n\"Capitalist slave-owner! Leprous and ancient cannibal without culture!\nYou have begun a war you can not finish!\"\n\n\"Ha!\" Malone said, feeling inadequate to the occasion. As the Mongol\ncharged, he felt a wave of intense pragmatism come over him. He\nreached back toward the bar, grabbed a bottle of vodka and tossed\nseveral glassfuls into the giant's face. The Mongol, deluged and\nscreaming, clawed wildly at his eyes and spun round several times,\ncursing Malone and all his kin for the next twenty-seven generations,\nand grabbing thin air in his attempt to reach the _Amerikanski_.\n\nAll of the customers appeared to have discovered urgent engagements\nelsewhere. There was little for the Mongol to collide with except\nempty tables and chairs. But he did manage to swipe one of the\nlumpy-faced men on the side of the head with one flail of his arms.\nThe lumpy-faced man said \"Yoop!\" and went staggering away into\nPetkoff, who spun him around and threw him away in the general\ndirection of the bandstand. The diversion provided Malone with just\nenough time to start moving again.\n\nFour uniformed men were making their way toward the ladies' room from\nthe opposite side of the restaurant. They were carrying a stretcher,\nwhich seemed pitifully inadequate for the carnage Malone had just\nleft.\n\nHe blocked their path. \"Where are you going?\" he said.\n\n\"You are American?\" one of them said. \"I speak English good, no?\"\n\nBehind him, Malone heard a yowl and a crunch, as of a body striking\nwood. It sounded as if somebody had fetched up against the bar. \"You\nspeak English fine,\" he said, feeling wildly out of place. \"Have you\nbeen taking lessons?\"\n\n\"Me?\" the man said. \"It is no time for talk. We got to get lady for\nhospital.\"\n\n\"Lady?\" Malone said. \"For hospital?\"\n\n\"Miss Garbitsch her name is,\" the stretcher-man said, trying to get\npast Malone. The FBI agent shifted slightly, blocking the path. \"We\nwait outside one revolution--\"\n\n\"One what?\"\n\n\"When hands revolve once,\" the man said. \"One hour. Now we get call so\nwe take her to hospital.\"\n\nIt sounded suspicious to Malone. He heard more yells behind him, and\nthey sounded a little closer. The sound of running men came to his\nears. \"Well,\" he said happily, \"goodbye all.\"\n\nThe stretcher-bearer said, \"Vot?\" Malone shoved him backward into the\napproaching mob, grabbed the stretcher away from the other three men,\nwho were acting a little dazed, and swung it in a wide arc. He caught\nan MVD man in the stomach, and the man doubled up with a weird\nwhistling groan, turned slightly in agony, and hit another MVD man\nwith his bowed head. The second man fell; Malone heard more crashes\nand screaming, but he didn't find out any details. Instead, he threw\nthe stretcher at the milling mob and turned, already in motion, racing\nfor the ladies' room.\n\nHe had no notion of what he was going to do when he got there, or what\nhe was going to find. Her Majesty and Lou were in there, all right,\nbut how were they going to get out without being arrested, clubbed,\ndisemboweled or taken to a Russian hospital for God alone knew what\nnovel purposes?\n\nHis mind was still a little foggy from the vast amounts of vodka he\nhad poured down, and he wasn't in the least sure that teleportation\nwould even work. He tried to figure out whether Her Majesty had\nalready carried Lou off that way--but he doubted it. Lou was quite a\nburden for the old woman. And besides, he wasn't at all sure whether\nit was possible to teleport a human being. A lump of inanimate matter\nis one thing; an intelligent woman with a mind of her own is\ndefinitely something else.\n\nIt seemed to take forever for him to reach the door, and he was\npanting heavily when he reached for it. Suddenly, another hand shot in\nfront of his, turning the doorknob. Malone looked up.\n\nIt was impossible to figure out where she had come from, or what she\nthought she was doing, but a bulging, slightly intoxicated Russian\nmatron with bluish hair piled high on her head, a rusty orange dress\nand altogether too many jewels scattered here and there about her\nample person, stood regarding him with a mixture of scorn, surprise\nand shock.\n\nMalone crowded her aside without a thought and jerked the door open.\nBehind her he could see the melee still continuing, though it looked\nby now as if the Russians weren't very sure who they were supposed to\nbe fighting. The Mongol's great head rose for a second above the\nstorm, shouting something unintelligible, and dropped again into the\ncrowd.\n\nMalone focused on the matron, who was standing with her mouth open\nstaring at him.\n\n\"Madam,\" he said with stern dignity, \"wait your turn!\"\n\nHe ducked inside and slammed the door behind him. There was a small\nknob to bolt the door with, and he used it. But it wasn't going to\nhold long, he knew. If the mob outside ever got straightened out, the\ndoor would go down like a piece of cardboard, bolt or no bolt.\nUndoubtedly the gigantic Mongol could do the job with one hand tied\nbehind his back.\n\nMalone turned around and put his own back to the door. Women were\nlooking up and making up their minds whether or not to scream. Time\nstood absolutely still, and nobody seemed to be moving--not even the\ntwo directly before him: a frightened-looking little old lady, who was\ntrying to hold up a semiconscious redhead.\n\nAnd, somewhere behind him, he knew, was a howling mob of thoroughly\nmaddened Russians.\n\n\n8\n\nThe door rattled against Malone's back as a hand twisted the knob and\nshook it. He braced himself for the next assault, and it came: the\nshudder of a heavy body slamming up against it. Miraculously, the door\nheld, at least for the moment. But the roars outside were growing\nlouder and louder as the second team came up.\n\nWhere was the Mongol? he wondered. But there was no time for idle\ncontemplation. The scene inside the room demanded his immediate\nattention.\n\nHe was in the anteroom, a gilded and decorated parlor filled with\noverstuffed chairs and couches. There was a door at the far side of\nthe room, and a woman suddenly came out of it holding a pocketbook in\none hand and a large powder-puff in the other. She saw Malone and\nreacted instantly.\n\nHer scream seemed to be a signal. The two other women sitting on\ncouches screamed, too, and jumped up with their hands to their faces.\nMalone shouted something unintelligible but very loud at them and\nbrandished a fist menacingly. They shrieked again and ran for the\ninterior room.\n\nMalone heard the roaring outside, and pressed his back tighter against\nthe door. Then, suddenly, he broke away from it and ran over to Her\nMajesty and Lou. He looked down. Lou was apparently completely\nunconscious by this time, and there was a peaceful look on her face.\nThe Queen looked down at her, then up at Malone.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Sir Kenneth,\" she said, \"but we really haven't time for\nromantic thoughts just now.\"\n\nMalone passed a hand over his brow. \"We haven't got time for\nanything,\" he said. \"You can see what's going on outside.\"\n\n\"My goodness,\" Her Majesty said. \"Oh, yes. My goodness, yes.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Malone said. \"We've got to teleport out, if we can--and if we\ncan take Lou with us.\"\n\n\"I don't know, Sir Kenneth,\" the Queen said.\n\n\"We've got to try,\" Malone said grimly, looking down. There was a\ncrash as something hit the door. It shuddered, creaked, and held.\nMalone took a breath. Lou was too beautiful to leave behind, no matter\nwhat.\n\n\"I'll mesh my mind with yours,\" Her Majesty said, \"so we'll be\nsynchronized.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Malone said. \"The plane. Let's go.\"\n\nThere was another crash, but he hardly heard it. He closed his eyes\nand tried to visualize the interior of the plane that was waiting for\nthem at the airfield. He wasn't sure he could do it; the vodka might\nhave clouded his mental processes just enough to make teleporting\nimpossible. He concentrated. The crash came again, and a shout. He\nalmost had it ... he almost had it...\n\nThe last sound he heard was the splintering of the door, and a great\nshout that was cut off in the middle.\n\nMalone opened his eyes.\n\n\"We made it,\" he said softly. \"And I wonder what the MVD is going to\nthink.\"\n\nHer Majesty took a deep breath. \"My goodness,\" she said. \"That _was_\nexciting, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Not half as exciting as it's going to be if we don't hurry now,\"\nMalone said. \"If you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"I do,\" Her Majesty said.\n\n\"That's good,\" Malone said at random. \"I don't.\" He helped the Queen\nease the unconscious body of Luba Garbitsch into one of the padded\nseats, and Malone pushed a switch. The seat gave a tiny squeak of\nprotest, and then folded back into a flat bedlike arrangement. Lou was\narranged on this comfortable surface, and Malone took a deep breath.\n\"Take care of her for a minute, Your Majesty,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course,\" the Queen said.\n\nMalone nodded. \"I'm going to see who's up front,\" he said. He walked\nthrough the corridors of the plane and rapped authoritatively on the\ndoor of the pilot's cabin. A second passed, and he raised his hand to\nknock again.\n\nIt never reached the door, which opened very suddenly. Malone found\nhimself facing a small black hole.\n\nIt was the muzzle and the bore of the barrel of an M-2 .45 revolver,\nand it was pointing somewhere in the space between Malone's eyes.\nBehind the gun was a hard-eyed air force colonel with a grim\nexpression.\n\n\"You know,\" Malone said pleasantly, \"they're good guns, but they\nreally can't compare to the .44 Magnum.\"\n\nThe pilot blinked, and his gun wavered just a little. \"What?\" he said.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"if you'd only join the FBI, like me, you'd have\na .44 Magnum, and you could compare the guns.\"\n\nThe pilot blinked again. \"You're--\"\n\n\"Malone,\" Malone said. \"Kenneth J. Malone, FBI. My friends call me\nSnookums, but don't try it. Why not let's put the gun away and be\nfriends?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the colonel said weakly. \"Mr.--sure. I'm sorry, Mr. Malone.\nDidn't recognize you for a second there.\"\n\n\"Perfectly all right,\" Malone said. The gun was still pointing at him,\nand in spite of the fact that he felt pleasantly like Philip Marlowe,\nor maybe the Saint, he was beginning to get a little nervous. \"The\ngun,\" he said.\n\nThe colonel stared at it for a second, then reholstered it in a hurry.\n\"I am sorry,\" he said. \"But we've been worried about Russians coming\naboard. I've got my copilot and navigator outside, guarding the plane,\nand they were supposed to let me know if anybody came in. When they\ndidn't let me know, and you knocked, I assumed you were Russians. But,\nof course, you--\"\n\nConversation came to a sudden dead stop.\n\n\"About these Russians--\" Malone said desperately. But the pilot's eyes\ngot a little glazed. He wasn't listening.\n\n\"Now, wait a minute,\" he said. \"Why _didn't_ they notify me?\"\n\n\"Maybe they didn't see me,\" Malone said. \"I mean us.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"I'm not very noticeable,\" Malone said hopefully, trying to look small\nand undistinguished. \"They could just have ... not noticed me. Okay?\"\nHe gave the pilot his most friendly smile.\n\n\"They'd have noticed you,\" the pilot said. \"If they're still out\nthere. If nothing's happened to them.\" He leaned forward. \"Did you see\nthem, Malone?\"\n\nMalone shrugged. \"How would I know?\" he said.\n\n\"How would you--\" The pilot seemed at a loss for words. Malone waited\npatiently, trying to look as if everything were completely and\nperfectly normal. \"Mr. Malone,\" the pilot said at last, \"how _did_ you\nget aboard this aircraft?\"\n\nHe didn't wait for an answer, and Malone was grateful for that.\nInstead, he stepped over to a viewport and looked out. On the field,\ntwo air force officers were making lonely rounds about the plane.\nFifty yards farther away, a squad of Russian guards also patrolled the\nbrightly-lit area. There was nothing else in sight.\n\n\"There isn't any way you could have done it,\" the pilot said without\nturning.\n\n\"That's the FBI for you,\" Malone said. \"We've got our little trade\nsecrets, you know.\" Somehow, the pilot's back looked unconvinced.\n\"Disguise,\" Malone added. \"We're masters of disguise.\"\n\nThe pilot turned very slowly. \"Now what the hell would you disguise\nyourself as?\" he said. \"A Piper Cub?\"\n\n\"It's a military secret,\" Malone said hurriedly.\n\nThe pilot didn't say anything for what seemed a long time. \"A military\nsecret?\" he asked at last, in a hushed voice. \"And you can't tell me?\nYou're a civilian, and I'm a colonel in the United States Air Force,\nand you can't tell me a military secret?\"\n\nMalone didn't hesitate a second. \"Well, Colonel,\" he said cheerfully,\n\"that's the way things are.\"\n\nThe pilot threw up his hands. \"It's none of my business,\" he said\nloudly. \"I'm not even going to think about it. Because if I do, you'll\nhave a mad pilot on your hands, and you wouldn't like that, would\nyou?\"\n\n\"I would hate it,\" Malone said sincerely, \"like hell. Particularly\nsince I've got a sick woman aboard.\"\n\n\"Disguised,\" the pilot offered, \"as Lenin, I suppose.\"\n\nMalone shook his head. \"I'm not kidding now,\" he said. \"She is sick,\nand I want a doctor for her.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you bring one with you?\" the pilot said. \"Or wasn't the\ndisguise big enough for three?\"\n\n\"Four,\" Malone said. \"We've got three now; me and Miss Garbitsch and\nMiss Thompson. Lou--Miss Garbitsch is the one who's sick. But I want a\ndoctor from the American Embassy.\"\n\n\"I think we could all use one,\" the pilot said judiciously. \"But you'd\nbetter tell me what's the matter with the girl.\"\n\nMalone gave him a brief and highly censored version of the melee at\nTrotkin's, particularly omitting the details of the final escape from\nthe MVD men.\n\nWhen he had finished, the pilot gave a long, low whistle. \"You have\nbeen having fun,\" he said. \"Can I go on your next adventure, or is it\nonly for accredited Rover Boys?\"\n\n\"You have to buy a pin and a special compass that works in the dark,\"\nMalone said. \"I don't think you'd like it. How about that doctor?\"\n\nThe pilot nodded wearily. \"I'll send my navigator over to the airfield\nphone,\" he said. \"As a matter of fact, I'll tell him to tell the\ndoctor I'm the one who's sick, so the Russians don't get suspicious.\nIt may even be true.\"\n\n\"Just so he gets here,\" Malone said. The pilot was flagging his\nnavigator through the viewport as Malone went out, closing the door\ngently behind him. He went back down the plane corridor to Her Majesty\nand Lou.\n\nLou was still lying on the makeshift bed, her eyes closed. She looked\nmore beautiful and defenseless than ever, and Malone wanted to do\nsomething big and terrible to all the Russians who had tried to take\nher away or dope her. With difficulty, he restrained himself. \"How is\nshe?\" he asked.\n\n\"She seems to be all right,\" the Queen said. \"The substance they put\nin her drink doesn't appear to have had any other effect than putting\nher to sleep and making her a little sick--and that was a good thing.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" Malone said. \"That was fine.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Her Majesty said, \"she did get rid of quite a bit of the drug\nin the ladies' room.\" She smiled, just a trifle primly. \"I think\nshe'll be all right,\" she said.\n\n\"There's a doctor on the way, anyhow,\" Malone said, staring down at\nher. He tried to think of something he could do for her--fan her, or\nbring her water, or cool her fevered brow. But she didn't look very\nfevered. She just looked helpless and beautiful. He felt sorry for all\nthe nasty things he had said to her, and all the nasty things she had\nsaid to him. If she got well--and of course she was going to get well,\nhe told himself firmly--things would be different. They'd be sweet and\nkind to each other all the time, and do nice things for each other.\n\nAnd she was definitely going to get well. He wouldn't even think about\nanything else. She was going to be fine again, and very soon. Why, she\nwas hardly hurt at all, he told himself, hardly hurt at all.\n\n\"Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said. \"I've been thinking: while we were\nabout it, why didn't we just teleport all the way back home?\"\n\nMalone turned. \"Because,\" he said, \"we'd have had the devil of a time\nexplaining just how we managed to do it.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"I see. Of course.\"\n\n\"This teleportation gimmick is supposed to be a secret,\" Malone went\non. \"We don't want to let out anything more about it than we have to.\nAs it is, there's going to be some fierce wondering among the Russians\nabout how we got out of that restaurant.\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" the Queen said, entirely unexpectedly, \"a bourgeois\ncapitalistic trick.\"\n\n\"Obviously,\" Malone agreed. \"But we don't want to start up any more\nquestions than we have to.\"\n\n\"And how about the plane itself?\" Her Majesty went on. \"Do you think\nthey'll let us take off?\"\n\n\"I don't know how they can stop us,\" Malone said.\n\n\"You don't?\"\n\n\"Well, they don't want to cause any incidents now,\" Malone said. \"At\nleast, I don't think they do. If they could have captured us--me, or\nLou, or both of us, depending on which side of the argument you want\nto take--anyhow, if they could have grabbed us on their own home\ngrounds, they'd have had an excuse. Lou got sick, they'd say, and they\njust took her to the hospital. They wouldn't have to call it an arrest\nat all.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" Her Majesty said. \"But now we're not on their home\ngrounds.\"\n\n\"Not so long as we stay in this plane, we're not,\" Malone said. \"And\nwe're going to stay here until we take off.\"\n\nHer Majesty nodded.\n\n\"I wish I knew what they thought they were doing, though,\" Malone\nmused. \"They certainly couldn't have held us for very long, no matter\nhow they worked things.\"\n\n\"I know what was on their minds,\" Her Majesty said. \"At least partly.\nIt was all so confused it was difficult to get anything really\ndetailed or complete.\"\n\n\"There,\" Malone said fervently, \"I agree with you.\"\n\n\"The whole trouble was,\" the Queen said, \"that nobody knew about\nanybody else.\"\n\n\"I'd gathered something like that,\" Malone said. \"But what exactly was\nit all about?\"\n\n\"Well,\" the Queen said, \"Major Petkoff was supposed to tell Lou, in\neffect, that if she didn't agree to do espionage work for the Soviet\nUnion, things would go hard with her father.\"\n\n\"Nice,\" Malone said. \"Very friendly gentleman.\"\n\n\"Well,\" the Queen continued, \"he was supposed to tell her about that\nat the bar, when he had her alone. But she got that drugged drink\nbefore he could begin to say anything.\"\n\n\"Then who drugged it?\" Malone said. \"Lou?\"\n\nThe Queen shrugged. \"Someone else,\" she said. \"Major Petkoff didn't\nknow anything about the drugged drink.\"\n\n\"A nice surprise for him, anyhow,\" Malone said.\n\n\"It was a surprise for everybody,\" the Queen said. \"You see, the\ndrugged drink was meant to get her to the hospital, where they'd have\nher alone for a long time and could really put some pressure on her.\"\n\n\"And then,\" Malone said, \"there were the men who wanted to arrest me.\nAnd the ones who wanted to take Lou to jail. And the mad Mongol who\njust wanted to fight, I guess.\"\n\n\"There were so many different things, all going on at once,\" the Queen\nsaid.\n\nMalone nodded. \"There seems to be quite a lot of confusion in the\nSoviet Union, too,\" he said. \"That does not sound to me like an\nefficient operation.\"\n\n\"It wasn't, very,\" the Queen said. \"You see, they have Garbitsch now,\nbut they can't do anything to him because they can't get to Lou. And\nit doesn't do them any good to do anything to her father, unless she\nknows about it first.\"\n\n\"It sounds,\" Malone said, \"as if the USSR is going along the same\nconfused road as the good old United States.\"\n\nThe Queen nodded agreement. \"It's terrible,\" she said. \"I get those\nsame flashes of telepathic static, too.\"\n\n\"You do?\" Malone said, leaning forward.\n\n\"Just the same,\" the Queen said. \"Whatever is operating in the United\nStates is operating over here, too.\"\n\nMalone sat down in a seat on the aisle. \"Everything,\" he announced,\n\"is now perfectly lovely. The United States is being confused and\nmixed up by somebody, and the Somebody looked like a Russian spy. But\nnow Russia is being confused, too.\"\n\n\"Do you think there are some American spies working here?\" the Queen\nsaid.\n\n\"If they're using psionics,\" Malone said, \"as they obviously are--and\nI don't know about them, Burris doesn't know about them, O'Connor\ndoesn't know about them and nobody else I can find knows about them--\nthen they don't exist. That's flat.\"\n\n\"How about outer space?\" the Queen said. \"I mean, spies from outer\nspace trying to take over the Earth.\"\n\n\"It's a nice idea,\" Malone said sourly. \"I wish they'd hurry up and do\nit.\"\n\n\"Then you don't think--\"\n\n\"I don't know what to think,\" Malone said. \"There's some perfectly\nsimple explanation for all this. And somewhere, in all the running\naround and looking here and there I've been doing, I've got all the\nfacts I need to come up with that answer.\"\n\n\"Oh, my,\" the Queen said. \"That's wonderful.\"\n\n\"Sure it is,\" Malone said. \"There's only one trouble, as a matter of\nfact. I don't know what the explanation is, and I don't know which\nfacts are important and which ones aren't.\"\n\nThere was a short silence.\n\n\"I wish Tom Boyd were here,\" Malone said wistfully.\n\n\"Really?\" the Queen said. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Because,\" Malone said, \"I feel like hearing some really professional\ncursing.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nThree-quarters of an hour passed, each and every minute draped in some\nblack and gloomy material. Malone sat in his seat, his head supported\nby both hands, and stared at the back of the seat ahead of him. No\ngreat messages were written on it. The Queen, respecting his need for\nsilent contemplation, sat and watched Lou and said nothing at all.\n\nIt was always possible, of course, Malone thought, that he would fall\nasleep and dream of an answer. That kind of thing kept happening to\ndetectives in books. Or else a strange man in a black trenchcoat would\nsidle up to him and hand him a slip of paper. The words: \"Five\no'clock, watch out, the red snake, doom,\" would be written on the\npaper and these words would provide him with just the clues he needed\nto solve the whole case. Or else he would go and beat somebody up, and\nthe exercise would stimulate his brain and he would suddenly arrive at\nthe answer in a blinding flash.\n\nWondering vaguely if a blinding flash were anything like a dungeon,\nbecause people kept being in them and never seemed to come out, Malone\nsighed. Detectives in books were great, wonderful people who never had\nany doubts or worries. Particularly if they were with the FBI. Only\nKenneth J. Malone was different.\n\nMaybe someday, he thought, he would be a real detective, instead of\njust having a few special gifts that he hadn't really worked for,\nanyhow. Maybe someday, in the distant future, he would be the equal of\nNick Carter.\n\nRight now, though, he had a case to solve. Nick Carter wasn't around\nto help.\n\nAnd Kenneth J. Malone, FBI, was getting absolutely nowhere.\n\nFinally, his reverie was broken by the sounds of argument outside the\nplane door. There were voices speaking both English and Russian, very\nloudly. Malone went to the door and opened it. A short, round,\ngrey-haired man who looked just a little like an over-tired bear who\nhad forgotten to sleep all winter almost fell into his arms. The man\nwas wearing a grey overcoat that went nicely with his hair, and\ncarrying a small black bag.\n\nMalone said: \"Oog,\" replaced the man on his own feet and looked past\nhim at the group on the landing ramp outside. The navigator was there,\narguing earnestly with two men in the uniform of the MVD.\n\n\"Damn it,\" the navigator said, \"you can't come in here. Nobody comes\nin but the doctor. This is United States territory.\"\n\nThe MVD men said something in Russian.\n\n\"No,\" the navigator said. \"Definitely no.\"\n\nOne of the MVD men spat something that sounded like an insult.\n\nThe navigator shrugged. \"I don't understand Russian,\" he told them.\n\"All I know is one word. No. _Nyet_ Definitely, absolutely irrevocably\n_nyet_.\"\n\n_\"Sikin sin Amerikanyets!\"_\n\nThe MVD men turned, as if they'd been a sister act, and went down the\nsteps. The navigator followed them, wiping his forehead and breathing\ndeeply. Malone shut the door.\n\n\"Well, well, well,\" the doctor said, in a burbling sort of voice.\n\"Somehow, we thought it might be you. Anyhow, the ambassador did.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Malone said, trying to sound surprised.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" the doctor assured him. \"You have raised something of a\nstench in and around good old Moscow, you know.\"\n\n\"I'm innocent,\" Malone said.\n\nThe doctor nodded. \"Undoubtedly,\" he said judiciously. \"Who isn't? And\nwhere, by the way, is the girl?\"\n\n\"Over there.\" Malone pointed. News apparently traveled with great\nspeed in Moscow, MVD and censorship notwithstanding. At any rate, he\nthought, it traveled with great speed to the ears of the Embassy\nstaff.\n\nThe doctor lifted Lou's limp wrist to time her pulse, his lips pursed\nand his eyes focused on a far wall.\n\n\"What have you heard?\" Malone said.\n\n\"The MVD boys are extremely worried,\" the doctor said. \"Extremely.\" He\ndidn't let go of the wrist, a marvel of which Malone had never grown\ntired. Doctors always seemed to be able, somehow, to examine a patient\nand carry on a conversation about totally different things, without\neven showing the strain. This one was no exception. Malone watched in\nawe.\n\n\"According to the reports we got from them,\" the doctor said, \"you\nwandered off from _Trotkin's_ without your escort.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said at random, \"I didn't think to leave them a\nfarewell note. I hope they don't think I disliked their company.\"\n\n\"Officially,\" the doctor said, lifting Lou's left eyelid and gazing\nthoughtfully into the blue iris thus exposed, \"they're afraid you're\nlost, and they were apologetic as all hell about it to the\nambassador.\" The iris appeared to lose its fascination; the doctor\ndropped the eyelid and fished in his black bag, which he had put on\nthe seat next to Lou.\n\n\"And unofficially?\" Malone asked.\n\n\"Unofficially,\" the doctor said, \"we've got news of a riot at\n_Trotkin's_ tonight, in which you seem to have been involved. Mr.\nMalone, you must be quite a barroom brawler when you're at home.\"\n\n\"Frankly,\" Malone said, \"I'm a little out of practice. And I hope I\nnever have the chance to get back _into_ practice.\"\n\nThe doctor nodded, removing a stethoscope from the bag and applying it\nto Lou's chest. He waited a second, frowned and then took the plugs\nout of his ears. \"I know just what you mean,\" he said. \"You might be\ninterested to know the first unofficial score of that little match.\"\n\n\"Score?\" Malone said.\n\nThe doctor nodded again. \"Three concussions,\" he said, \"one possible\nskull fracture, a broken arm, two bitten hands, and a large and varied\nassortment of dental difficulties and plain hysteria. No dead,\nhowever. I really don't understand why not.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"nobody wanted to create an international\nincident.\"\n\n\"Hmf,\" the doctor said. \"I see. Or I think I do, which is as far as I\ncare to go in the matter. The Russians suspect, by the way, that\nyou've managed to get aboard the plane. They do know, of course, about\nthe girl, and when the pilot called for me they put two and two\ntogether. In spite of his story about being sick. What they can't\nfigure out is how you managed to _get_ aboard the plane.\"\n\n\"Neither can I,\" Malone said at random. The doctor gave him a single\nbright stare.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"I suppose you know your own business best.\nBy the way, my examination accords pretty well with our unofficial\ninformation about the girl--that she was given some sort of drug in a\ndrink. Is that what happened?\"\n\nMalone nodded. \"As far as we know,\" he said. \"She did get rid of a lot\nof it within a few minutes, though.\"\n\n\"Good,\" the doctor said. \"Very sensible.\"\n\n\"Sense had nothing to do with it,\" Malone said.\n\n\"In any case,\" the doctor went on doggedly, \"there can't be too much\nleft in her system. Her pulse is good, she's breathing easily and\nthere don't seem to be any complications, so I should doubt strongly\nthat there's been much damage done. Besides all which, of course, the\nRussians would hardly have wanted to hurt her; what they gave her\nwould probably have done little more harm even if she'd ingested it\nall, and kept it down.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said sincerely.\n\n\"I'll give you some pills,\" the doctor said, fishing in his bag again,\n\"and you can give them to her when she wakes up.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" Malone said, vaguely disappointed.\n\nThe doctor eyed him keenly. \"Well,\" he said, \"I could give her an\ninjection, but I'd be a little afraid to. If it had a synergistic\naction with the drug, she might be worse off than before.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"By all means. Just the pills.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you agree,\" the doctor said. \"Oh, and about leaving--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Malone said. \"We want to get out of here in a hurry, if we\ncan.\"\n\n\"I think you can,\" the doctor said. \"The ambassador mentioned that\nhe'd try to arrange it with the Russians. I don't know what he'll tell\nthem--but then, that's why he's an ambassador, and I'm a doctor.\" He\nstraightened up and handed Malone an envelope containing three green\ncapsules. \"Give her these if she wakes up with a headache,\" he said.\n\"If she feels all right, just forget all about them.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"And thanks, Doctor. Tell the ambassador we'd\nappreciate it if he got us out of here as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" the doctor said. \"After all, I might as well take on the\njob of a diplomatic courier.\"\n\nMalone nodded. \"Well,\" he said, \"goodbye, Mr. Courier.\"\n\nThe doctor went to the door, opened it and turned.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" he said, \"Mr. Ives.\"\n\n\n9\n\nLou didn't wake up until the plane was dropping toward the Washington\nairfield, and when she did awaken it was as if she had merely come out\nof an especially deep sleep. Malone was standing over her, which was\nfar from a coincidence; he had been waiting and watching virtually\nevery minute since takeoff.\n\nDuring his brief periods of rest, Her Majesty had taken over, and she\nwas now peacefully asleep at the back of the plane, looking a little\nmore careworn, but just as regal as ever. She looked to Malone as if\nshe had weathered a small revolution against her rule, but had managed\nto persuade the populace (by passing out cookies to the children,\nprobably) that all was, in the last analysis, for the best in this\nbest of all possible worlds. She looked, he thought, absolutely\nwonderful.\n\nSo did Lou. She blinked her eyes open and moved one hand at her side,\nand then she came fully awake. \"Well,\" she said. \"And a bright hello\nto you, Sleuth. If it's not being too banal, where am I?\"\n\n\"It is,\" Malone said, \"but you're in an airplane, coming into\nWashington. We ought to be there in a few minutes.\"\n\nLou shook her head slowly from side to side. \"I have never heard any\nnews that sounded better in my entire life,\" she said. \"How long ago\ndid we leave Moscow?\"\n\n\"Our trip to Beautiful Moskva,\" Malone said, \"ended right after they\ntried to get you to the hospital, by giving you a drugged drink. Do\nyou remember that?\"\n\n\"I remember it, all right,\" she said. \"I'm never going to forget that\nmoment.\"\n\n\"How do you feel?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Fine,\" Lou said. \"And how are _you_?\"\n\n\"Me?\" Malone said. \"I'm all right. I've _been_ all right. Don't worry\nabout _me_.\"\n\n\"Well, one never knows,\" Lou said. \"With your cold and all.\"\n\n\"I think that's better,\" Malone said hastily. \"But you're sure you\nfeel fine?\"\n\nLou nodded. \"A little tired, maybe, but that's all.\" She paused. \"I\nremember Miss Thompson taking me to the ladies' room. I got pretty\nsick. But from there on, I'm not sure what happened.\"\n\n\"I came in,\" Malone said, \"and got you out.\"\n\n\"How brave!\" Lou said.\n\n\"Not very,\" Malone said casually. \"After all, what could happen to me\nin a ladies' room?\"\n\n\"You'd be surprised,\" Lou murmured. \"And you came and got me, and took\nme to the plane and all. And I--\" She hesitated, and for a second she\nlooked very small and wistful. \"Do you--do you think they'll do\nanything to Dad?\" she said.\n\n\"I don't see why,\" Malone said confidently. \"After all, the only thing\nhe did wrong was to get caught, and that's an occupational risk if\nyou're in the spy business. Lots of people get caught. Happens all the\ntime. Don't worry about it.\"\n\n\"I--all right,\" she said. \"I won't, then.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said. He fished in his pocket. \"I've got some pills\nhere,\" he said, \"in case you have a headache. The doctor said I could\ngive them to you if you had a headache, but otherwise I should just\nforget about them.\"\n\nLou smiled. \"I think you'd better just forget about them,\" she said.\n\nMalone's hand came out of his pocket empty. \"I just want to make sure\nyou're okay,\" he said. \"Probably very silly. Of course you're okay.\"\n\n\"Of course I am,\" she said. \"But I don't think you're silly.\" She\nsmiled again, a very warm smile. Malone took a deep breath and\ndiscovered that he hadn't been breathing at all regularly for several\nminutes. Lou's smile increased a trifle in intensity and he stopped\nbreathing all over again. \"All things considered,\" she said, \"I think\nyou're pretty wonderful, Ken.\"\n\nMalone's voice sounded to him as if it were coming from a great\ndistance. He wondered if the strange feeling in his stomach were the\npangs of love, or the descent of the plane. Then he realized that he\ndidn't care. \"Well, well,\" he said airily. \"Well, well, well. Frankly,\nLou, I'm inclined to agree with you. Though I'm not sure about the\nqualification.\"\n\n\"Fine thing,\" she said. \"Tell a man he's wonderful and he just nods\nhis head as if he knew it all along.\"\n\nMalone swallowed hard. \"Maybe I did,\" he said. \"And how did you come\nto this startling conclusion?\"\n\nIt was Lou who broke the light mood of their speech first. \"Look,\nKen,\" she said seriously, \"I'm the daughter of an enemy spy. You know\nthat. You're an FBI agent.\"\n\n\"So what?\" he said.\n\n\"So,\" she said, \"you don't treat me like the daughter of a spy. You\ntreat me just like anybody else.\"\n\n\"I do not,\" Malone said instantly.\n\n\"All right,\" she said, and shrugged. \"But I'm sure none of this is in\nthe FBI manual for daughters of convicted spies.\"\n\n\"Now, you look,\" Malone said. \"Just what do you think this is? The\nMcCarthy era? Any way I treat you, it has nothing to do with your\nfather. He's a spy, and we caught him and we sent him back to Moscow.\nThat's our job. But all this about the sins of the fathers being\nvisited on the heads of the children, even unto the seventh\ngeneration--this is just plain silly. You're you; you're not your\nfather. You haven't done anything--why should I treat you as if you\nhave?\"\n\n\"How do you know I'm not a spy, too?\" she said.\n\n\"Because,\" Malone said flatly, \"I know.\"\n\n\"Really?\" she said softly. \"Do you really?\"\n\nMalone opened his mouth, shut it and then started again. \"Strictly\nspeaking,\" he said carefully, \"I don't know. But we're in the United\nStates now, where a person is considered innocent until proven\nguilty.\"\n\n\"And that,\" Lou said, \"is all you're going on, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Not all,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I didn't think so,\" Lou said, still smiling.\n\n\"Don't ask me how,\" Malone said, \"but we're pretty sure you knew\nnothing about your father's activities. Forget it.\"\n\nLou looked suddenly slightly disappointed. Malone wondered why. Of\ncourse, there was one more reason, and maybe she'd thought of that.\n\"It does make it easier,\" he said, \"that you happen to be a beautiful\ngirl.\"\n\nShe smiled again, and started to say something, but she never got the\nchance. The landing gear of the aircraft bumped gently against the\nrunway, and the ship rolled slowly in to a stop.\n\nA second passed. From the back of the plane a voice said: \"Are we back\nin Washington, S--Mr. Malone?\"\n\n\"That's right, Miss Thompson,\" Malone told the Queen.\n\n\"And Miss Garbitsch--\"\n\n\"I'm fine, Miss Thompson,\" Luba said. She swung her feet around to the\ndeck.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"Do you think you ought to get up?\"\n\nLou's smile seemed to reduce him to small, very hot ashes. \"Ken,\" she\nsaid, \"the doctor said I was fine, so what are you worrying about? I\ncan get up. I'll be all right.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay,\" he said, and stepped back. Her Majesty had already left\nthe plane. Lou got up, and wavered just a little. Malone held out his\narms, and found her in them before he had thought about it.\n\nA long time seemed to pass. Malone wasn't sure whether he was standing\nstill because he wanted to, or because he was absolutely incapable of\nmotion. Lou didn't seem in any hurry to break away, either.\n\nThen she put her arms around his neck.\n\n\"Sleuth,\" she said, \"don't you ever follow up a hint?\"\n\n\"Hint?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Damn it,\" Lou said in a soft, sweet voice, \"kiss me, Ken.\"\n\nMalone had no answer to that--at least, no verbal answer.\n\nOne didn't seem to be needed.\n\nWhen he finally came up for air, he said: \"Lou...\"\n\n\"Yes, Ken?\"\n\n\"Lou, where are you going from here?\"\n\nLou stepped back a pace. \"What?\" she said.\n\n\"I mean, back to New York?\" Malone said. \"Or someplace else? I mean--\nwell, what are you going to do?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Lou said. \"Oh, yes. I'll be going back to New York. After all,\nKen, I do have a living to make, such as it is, and Sir Lewis is\nexpecting me.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Malone said, \"but it still sounds funny. A girl like\nyou working for--well, for the Psychical Research people. Ghosts and\nectoplasm and all that.\"\n\nLou stepped back another pace. \"Now, wait a minute,\" she said. \"You\nseemed to need their information, all right.\"\n\n\"But that was--oh, well,\" Malone said. \"Never mind. Maybe I'm silly.\nIt really doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"I guess it doesn't, now,\" she said. \"Except that it does mean I've\ngot to leave for New York almost at once.\"\n\n\"Can you cut out that 'almost'?\" Malone said. \"Because I've got to be\nthere myself, and right away. If you hurry, we can get the same\nplane.\"\n\n\"That would be great,\" she said.\n\n\"Okay, then,\" Malone said. \"Don't you worry about a thing, I'll take\ncare of reservations and everything.\"\n\n\"My, my,\" Lou said. \"What it must be like to have all that pull and\ninfluence.\"\n\n\"What?\" Malone said.\n\nLou grinned. \"Nothing,\" she said. \"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Then it's all settled. I'll take care of the reservations, and we'll\ngo in together,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Fair enough,\" Lou said, \"my fine feathered Fed.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nActually, it took Malone nearly three hours to get everything set in\nWashington for his New York departure. He had to make a verbal report\nto Andrew J. Burris first, and that consumed quite a lot of time,\nsince Burris was alternately shocked, horrified, gleeful and confused\nabout the whole trip, and spent most of his time interrupting Malone\nand crying out for God's vengeance, mercy, justice or understanding.\n\nThen Malone had to dictate a longer report for the written record.\nThis didn't take quite as long, since there were no interruptions, but\nby the time it was over he felt as if he were going out to become a\nCarthusian monk. He felt, as he rubbed his raw throat, that it\nwouldn't be a bad idea at all to take a nice vow of silence for\nawhile. He could write people little notes, and they would all treat\nhim kindly and gently. He would be pointed out to strangers, and\npeople would try to do him favors.\n\nUnfortunately, he couldn't take the vow at once. During his absence,\nhis desk log showed, several calls had come in, all of which had to be\ntaken care of at once. Some of them dealt with evidence or statements\nfrom old cases, some were just nuisances. The most urgent was from Dr.\nO'Connor at Yucca Flats.\n\n\"If you're not too busy,\" O'Connor said in his icily polite tone, \"I\nwould like to have Miss Thompson back as soon as possible.\" He sounded\nas if Malone had borrowed his scalpel.\n\n\"I'll see what I can do,\" Malone said carefully.\n\n\"There is a new series of tests,\" O'Connor said, \"on which I am now at\nwork; the assistance of Miss Thompson would be invaluable to me at\nthis time.\"\n\nAfter he'd hung up, Malone called Her Majesty at her Washington hotel.\nShe was very glad of the chance to return to Yucca Flats, she said.\nThere, Malone knew, she would be able to return to her accustomed\ndignity as Queen of the Greater English Commonwealth, a district\nwhich, in her mind, seemed to include the greater part of the Western\nworld. On her present mission, she was plain Miss Thompson and, though\nthe idea of going about incognito had its charms, it became a little\ndull after awhile. The adventuring was fine, although a little rougher\nthan she'd thought it would be; the sight of the Queen's Own FBI in\naction was still a powerful attraction for Her Majesty. But the peace\nand quiet and dignity of Her Own Royal Palace won out without too much\ntrouble.\n\n\"Of course,\" Malone said, \"you'll be on call in case I need you.\"\n\n\"I am always in touch with my subjects,\" Her Majesty said with\ndignity, \"and most especially with you, Sir Kenneth. I shall so\nremain.\"\n\nAnd then there was a little paperwork to take care of. By the time\nMalone had finished, he would have been glad to teleport to New York\non his own. But on reflection he decided that he would much rather\ntravel with Lou, and hurried down to the airport.\n\nBy the time the plane landed at La Guardia, and they'd taken\na 'copter to the East Side Terminal and a taxi to the big\nblue-aluminum-and-glass Ravell Building, Malone had reached a new\ndecision. It would be nothing short of wonderful, he felt, if he\ncould spend the rest of his life traveling around with Luba Garbitsch.\n\nOf course, that name was something of a handicap. It was hardly a\nromantic one. He wondered, very briefly, whether or not \"Luba Malone\"\nwere an improvement. But he buried the thought before it got any\nfurther. Enough, he told himself firmly, was enough.\n\n\"It's been a nice trip,\" Lou said. She, too, sounded subdued, as if\nshe were thinking about something terribly serious.\n\n\"Great,\" Malone said happily. \"A wonderful trip.\"\n\n\"I enjoyed being with you,\" Lou said.\n\n\"Me, too,\" Malone said. He paid off the taxi-driver and they got out\nat the corner. Malone went to the newsstand there and picked up a copy\nof the _Post_.\n\n\"That,\" Lou said over his shoulder, \"is one whole hell of a headline.\"\n\nIt filled the entire page, four lines of thick black capitals:\n\n     JUDGE\n     DROPS\n     UNION\n     SUIT!\n\n\"Well, well,\" Malone said. \"Let's see what this is all about.\" He\nflipped to page three. Lou craned her neck over his shoulder and they\nread the start of the story together.\n\n     DISTRICT COURT RULES UNION HAS NO CASE\n\n     New York [AP], August 23. Judge James Lefkowitz\n     of the New York Supreme Court ruled today that\n     the International Truckers' Brotherhood had no\n     grounds for their suit against the United Transport\n     Corp. and its officers. The action, a bitterly\n     fought contest, involved a complaint by the\n     Brotherhood that UTC had violated their contract\n     with the Brotherhood by hiring \"unqualified drivers\"\n     to work for the corporation.\n\n     In a statement made immediately after the ruling,\n     Judge Lefkowitz said: \"It is obvious that a man with\n     a state-certified chauffeur's license is not an\n     'unqualified driver.'\"\n\n     Effects of this ruling are thought to be\n     far-reaching. Comment from the international\n     Truckers' Brotherhood...\n\nThere was more to it, a lot more, but Malone didn't feel like reading\nit. It sounded just as confused as he expected news to sound these\ndays, but it also sounded a little dull. He could feel Lou's breathing\nagainst his ear as he read, and he lost interest in the paper almost\nat once.\n\n\"My, my,\" she said. \"And I expected a real expos\u00e9 of a story, after\nthat headline.\"\n\n\"This is an expos\u00e9,\" Malone said. \"But I'm not sure what of.\"\n\n\"It sounds pretty confused,\" Lou said.\n\n\"Everything seems to, these days,\" Malone said. \"Including any story\nof what's been happening during the last little while.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Lou said. \"Without argument.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" Malone said suddenly. \"Would it help if I went up and told\nSir Lewis that there's no mark against your record?\"\n\n\"Mark?\" Lou said. \"Against my record?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said, \"I mean--well, he isn't the sort of man who'd\nfire somebody, because of--because of something like this?\"\n\n\"You mean because I know an FBI man?\" Lou said.\n\n\"I--\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" she said. \"I know what you mean. And he won't. He'll\nunderstand.\" She came round to face him, and patted his cheek.\n\"Thanks,\" she said. \"Thanks a lot, anyway.\"\n\n\"If there's anything I can do--\"\n\n\"There won't be,\" Lou said. \"You'll call me, though, about tonight?\"\n\n\"Sure I will,\" Malone said. He hoped that the tentative date he'd made\nwith her for that evening wouldn't be broken up because of a sudden\nonslaught of work. \"I'll let you know before five, for sure.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Lou said. \"I'll wait to hear from you.\"\n\nShe turned to walk away.\n\n\"Hey,\" Malone said. \"Wait a minute.\"\n\n\"What?\" she said, turning again.\n\nMalone looked judicious. \"I think,\" he said weightily, \"that,\nconsidering all the fun we've had, and all the adventuring and\neverything else, the least you could do would be to kiss me goodbye.\"\n\n\"On Fifth Avenue?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said. He tapped his lips. \"Here.\"\n\nShe laughed, bent closer and pecked him on the cheek. Then, before he\ncould say anything else, she was gone.\n\n\n10\n\nOn the way to FBI Headquarters on 69th Street, he read the _Post_ a\nlittle more carefully. The judge and his union suit weren't the only\nthings that were fouled up, he saw. Things were getting pretty bad all\nover.\n\nOne story dealt with the recent factional fights inside the American\nAssociation for the Advancement of Medicine. A new group, the United\nStates Medical-Professional Society, appeared to be forming as a\ncompetitor to the AAAM, and Malone wasn't quite so sure, when he\nthought about it, that this news was as bad as it appeared on the\nsurface. Fights between doctors, of course, were reasonably rare, at\nleast on the high hysterical level the story appeared to pinpoint. But\nthe AAAM had held a monopoly in the medical field for a long time;\nmaybe it was about time some competition showed itself. From what he\ncould find out in the story, the USMPS seemed like a group of fairly\nsensible people.\n\nBut that was one of the few rays of light Malone could discern amid\nthe encircling bloom of the news. The gang wars had reached a new\nhigh; the _Post_ was now publishing what it called a Daily Scoreboard,\nwhich consisted in this particular paper of six deaths, two\ndisappearances and ten hospitalizations. The six deaths were evenly\nscattered throughout the country: two in New York, one each in Chicago\nand Detroit, and two more in San Francisco. The disappearances were in\nLos Angeles and in Miami, and the hospitalizations were pretty much\nall over.\n\nThe unions had been having trouble, too. Traditional forms of\ncontroversy appeared to have gone out the window, in favor of\nstartling disclosures, beatings, wild cries of foul and great masses\nof puzzling evidence. How, for instance, Malone wondered, had the\npresident of Local 7574 of the Fishermen's Fraternal Brotherhood\nmanaged to mislay a pile of secret records, showing exactly how the\nmembership was being bilked of dues, on a Boston subway train? But,\nsomehow, he had, and the records were now causing shakeups, denials\nand trouble among the fishermen.\n\nOf course, the news was not all bad. There were always the comic\nstrips. Pogo was busily staving off an approaching wedding between\nAlbert Alligator and a new character named Tranquil Portly, who\nappeared to be a brown bear. He was running into some resistance,\nthough, from a wolflike character who planned to abscond with Albert's\ncigars while Albert was honeymooning. This character, Don Coyote by\nname, looked like a trouble-maker, and Malone vowed to keep a careful\neye on him.\n\nAnd then there were other headlines:\n\n     FUSION POWER SOON COMMERCIALLY\n     AVAILABLE SAYS AEC HEAD\n     Sees Drastic Cut in Power Rates\n\n     UN POLICE CONTINGENT OKAYED:\n     MILLION MEN TO FORM 1ST GROUP\n     Member Countries Pledge $20\n     Billion in Support Moneys\n\n     OFFICIAL STATES: \"WE'RE AHEAD AFTER 17 YEARS!\"\n     US Space Program Tops Russian Achievements\n\n     ARMED FORCES TO TOUGHEN TRAINING PROGRAM IN 1974\n     Gen. Foote: \"Our aim is to train fighting men,\n     not to run a country club.\"\n\n     GOVERNMENT TO SAVE $1 BILLION ANNUALLY?\n     Senator Hits Duplication of Effort in Government,\n     Vows Immediate Reform\n\nMalone read that one a little more carefully, because it looked, at\nfirst sight, like one of the bad-news items. There had been\ngovernment-spending reforms before, almost all of which had resulted\nin confusion, panic, loss of essential services--and twice as many men\non the payroll, since the government now had to hire useless\nefficiency experts, accountants and other such supernumerary workers.\n\nBut this time, the reform looked as if it might do some good. Of\ncourse, he told himself sadly, it was still too early to tell.\n\nThe senator involved was Deeks, of Massachusetts, who was also in the\nnews because of a peculiar battle he had had with Senator Furbisher of\nVermont. Congress, Malone noted, was still acting up. Furbisher\nclaimed that the moneys appropriated for a new Vermont dam were really\nbeing used for the dam. But Deeks had somehow come into possession of\nseveral letters written by a cousin of Furbisher's, detailing some of\nthe graft that was going on in the senator's home state. Furbisher was\nbusily denying everything, but his cousin was just as busy confessing\nall to anybody who would listen. It was building up into an extremely\ninteresting fracas, and, Malone thought, it would have been even\nfunnier than Pogo except that it was happening in the Congress of the\nUnited States.\n\nHe heaved a sigh, folded up the paper and entered the building that\nhoused the New York contingent of the FBI.\n\nBoyd was waiting in his office when he arrived.\n\n\"Well, there, Kenneth,\" he said. \"And how are all our little Slavic\nbrothers?\"\n\n\"Unreasonable,\" Malone said, \"and highly unpleasant.\"\n\n\"You refer, no doubt,\" Boyd said, \"to the _Meeneestyerstvoh\nVnootrenikh Dyehl_?\"\n\n_\"Gesundheit,\"_ Malone said kindly.\n\n\"The MVD,\" Boyd said. \"I've been studying for days to pull it on you\nwhen you got back.\"\n\nMalone nodded. \"Very well, then,\" he said in a stately, orotund tone.\n\"Say it again.\"\n\n\"Damn it,\" Boyd said, \"I _can't_ say it again.\"\n\n\"Cheer up,\" Malone said. \"Maybe some day you'll learn. Meantime,\nThomas, did you get the stuff we talked about?\"\n\nBoyd nodded. \"I think I got enough of it,\" he said. \"Anyhow, there is\na definite trend developing. Come on into the private office, and I'll\nshow you.\"\n\nThere, on Boyd's massive desk, were several neat piles of paper.\n\n\"It looks like enough,\" Malone said. \"As a matter of fact, it looks\nlike too much. Haven't we been through all this before?\"\n\n\"Not like this, we haven't,\" Boyd said. \"Information from all over,\nout of the everywhere, into the here.\" He picked up a stack of papers\nand handed them to Malone.\n\n\"What's this?\" Malone said.\n\n\"That,\" Boyd said, \"is a report on the Pacific Merchant Sailors'\nBrotherhood.\"\n\n\"Goody,\" Malone said doubtfully.\n\nBoyd came over, pulling at his beard thoughtfully, and took the top\nfew sheets out of Malone's hands. \"The report,\" he said, looking down\nat the sheets, \"includes the checks we made on the office of the\npresident of the Brotherhood, as well as the Los Angeles local and the\nSan Francisco local.\"\n\n\"Only two?\" Malone said. \"That seems as if you've been lying down on\nthe job.\"\n\n\"They're the top two in membership,\" Boyd said. \"But listen to this:\nthe president and three of his underlings resigned day before\nyesterday, and not quite in time. The law--by which I mean us, and a\ngood many other people--is hot on their tails. It seems somebody\naccidentally mixed up a couple of envelopes.\"\n\n\"Sounds like a case for the Post Office,\" Malone said brightly.\n\n\"Not these envelopes,\" Boyd said. \"There was a letter that was\nsupposed to go to the head of the San Francisco local, dealing with a\nsecond set of books--not the ones used for tax purposes, but the real\nMcCoy. The letter didn't get to the San Francisco man. Instead, it\nwent to the attorney general of the state of California.\"\n\n\"Lovely,\" Malone said. \"Meanwhile, what was San Francisco doing?\"\n\nBoyd smiled. \"San Francisco was getting confused,\" he said. \"Like\neverybody else. The San Francisco man got a copy of an affidavit\ndealing with merchant-ship tonnage. That was supposed to go to the\nattorney general.\"\n\n\"Good work,\" Malone said. \"So when the Frisco boys woke up to what was\nhappening--\"\n\n\"They called the head man, and he put two and two together, resigned\nand went into hiding. Right now, he's probably living an undercover\nlife as a shoe salesman in Paris, Kentucky.\"\n\n\"And, after all,\" Malone added, \"why not? It's a peaceful life.\"\n\n\"The attorney general, of course, impounded the second set of books,\"\nBoyd went on. \"A grand jury is hearing charges now.\"\n\n\"You know,\" Malone said reflectively, \"I almost feel sorry for the\nman. Almost, but not quite.\"\n\n\"I see what you mean,\" Boyd said. \"It is a hell of a thing to happen.\"\n\n\"On the other hand--\" Malone leafed through the papers in a hurry,\nthen put them back on Boyd's desk with a sigh of relief. \"I've got the\nmain details now,\" he said. \"I can go through the thing more\nthoroughly later. Anything else?\"\n\n\"Oh, lots,\" Boyd said. \"And all in the same pattern. The FPM, for\ninstance, literally dropped one in our laps.\"\n\n\"Literally?\" Malone said. \"What was the Federation of Professional\nMusicians doing in your lap?\"\n\n\"Not mine,\" Boyd said hastily. \"Not mine. But it seems that some\nsecretary put a bunch of file folders on the windowsill of their\nsecond-floor offices, and they fell off. At the same time, an agent\nwas passing underneath, slipped on a banana peel and sat down on the\nsidewalk. Bingo, folders in lap.\"\n\n\"Wonderful,\" Malone said. \"The hand of God.\"\n\n\"The hand of something, for sure,\" Boyd said. \"Those folders contain\nall the ammunition we've ever needed to get after the FPM. Kickbacks,\nillegal arrangements with nightclubs, the whole works. We're putting\nit together now, but it looks like a long, long term ahead for our\nfriends from the FPM.\"\n\nAnd Boyd went to his desk, picked up a particularly large stack of\npapers. \"This,\" he said, \"is really hot stuff.\"\n\n\"What do you call the others?\" Malone said. \"Crime on ice?\"\n\n\"The new show at the Winter Garden,\" Boyd said blithely. \"Don't miss\nit if you can.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"So what's so hot?\"\n\nBoyd smiled. \"The police departments of seven major cities,\" he said.\n\"They're all under attack either by the local prosecuting attorney or\nthe state's attorney general. It seems there's a little graft and\ncorruption going on.\"\n\n\"This,\" Malone said, \"is not news.\"\n\n\"It is to the people concerned,\" Boyd said. \"Four police chiefs have\nresigned, along with great handfuls of inspectors, captains and\nlieutenants. It's making a lovely wingding all over the country, Ken.\"\n\n\"I'll bet,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And I checked back on every one,\" Boyd went on. \"Your hunch was\nabsolutely right, Ken. The prosecuting attorneys and the attorneys\ngeneral are all new men--all the ones involved in this stuff. Each one\nreplaced a previous incumbent in a recent election. In two cases, the\ngovernor was new, too--elected last year.\"\n\n\"That figures,\" Malone said. \"What about the rest?\"\n\nBoyd's grandiose wave of a hand took in all the papers on the desk.\n\"It's all the same,\" he said. \"They all follow a pattern, Ken, _the_\npattern. The one you were looking for.\"\n\nMalone blinked. \"I'll be damned,\" he said. \"I'll be doubly damned.\"\n\n\"And how about the Russians?\" Boyd said.\n\n\"You mean the _Meeneestyerstvoh Vnootrenikh Dyehl_?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Now,\" Boyd said, \"I'll be damned. And after I practiced for days.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Malone said. \"But I was _there_. The Russians are about as mixed\nup as a group of Transylvanian villagers with two vampires to track\ndown and not enough flambeaux for all. Here, for instance, is just one\nexample: the conflicting sets of orders that were given about me and\nHer Majesty and L--Miss Garbitsch.\"\n\nBriefly, he outlined what had happened.\n\n\"Sounds like fun,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"They were so busy arguing with each other,\" Malone finished, \"that I\nhave a feeling we hardly needed the teleportation to escape. It would\njust have taken longer, that's all.\" He paused. \"By the way, Tom,\nabout the stakeout--\"\n\n\"Luba Garbitsch is being protected as if she were Fort Knox,\" Boyd\nsaid. \"If any Soviet agent tries to approach her with a threat of any\nkind, we'll have him nabbed before he can say Ivan Robinovitch.\"\n\n\"Or,\" Malone suggested, \"_Meeneestyerstvoh_--\"\n\n\"If we waited for that one,\" Boyd said, \"we might have to wait all\nday.\" He paused. \"But who's doing it?\" he went on. \"That's still the\nquestion. Martians? Venerians? Or is that last one Venusians?\"\n\n\"Aphrodisiacs,\" Malone suggested diplomatically.\n\n\"Thank you, no,\" Boyd said politely. \"I never indulge while on duty.\"\n\n\"Thomas,\" Malone said, \"you are a Rover Boy First-Class.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Boyd said. \"But, meanwhile, who is doing all this? Would you\nprefer Evil Beings from the Planet Ploor?\"\n\n\"I would not,\" Malone said firmly.\n\n\"But I have a strange feeling,\" Boyd said, \"that, in spite of all the\nevidence to the contrary, you do not hold with the Interplanetary\nAlien Theory.\"\n\n\"Frankly,\" Malone said, \"I'm not sure of anything. Not really. But I\ndo want to know why, if it's interplanetary aliens doing this stuff,\nthey're picking such a strange way of going about it.\"\n\n\"Strange?\" Boyd said. \"What's strange about it? You wouldn't expect\nThings from Ploor to come right out and _tell_ us what they want,\nwould you? It's against custom. It may even be against the law.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe,\" Malone said. \"But it is pretty strange. The difference\nbetween what's happening in Russia and what's happening here--\"\n\n\"What difference?\" Boyd said. \"Everybody's confused. Here, and over\nthere. It all looks the same to me.\"\n\n\"Well, it isn't,\" Malone said. \"Take a look at the paper, for\ninstance.\" He tossed the _Post_ at Boyd, who caught it with a\nspasmodic clutching motion and reassembled it slowly.\n\n\"Why throw things?\" Boyd said. \"You sore or something?\"\n\n\"I guess I am,\" Malone said. \"But not at you. It's--somebody or\nsomething. Person or persons unknown.\"\n\n\"Or Ploorians,\" Boyd said.\n\n\"Whatever,\" Malone said. \"But take a look at the paper and see if you\nsee what I see.\" He paused. \"Does that mean anything?\" he said.\n\n\"Probably,\" Boyd said. \"We'll figure it out later.\" He leafed through\nthe newspaper slowly, pulling thoughtfully at his beard from time to\ntime. Malone watched him in breathless silence.\n\n\"See it?\" he said at last.\n\nBoyd looked up and, very slowly, nodded. \"You're right, Ken,\" he said\nin a quiet voice. \"You're absolutely right. It's as plain as the nose\non your face.\"\n\n\"And that,\" Malone said, \"sounds like an insult. It's much plainer\nthan that. Suppose you tell me.\"\n\nBoyd considered. \"Over here,\" he said at last, \"there are a lot of\nconfused jerks and idiots. Right?\"\n\n\"Correct,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And in Russia,\" Boyd went on, \"there's a lot of confusion. Right?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Boyd said. \"It's perfectly clear. I wonder why I didn't see it\nbefore.\"\n\n\"That's it!\" Malone cried. \"That's the difference!\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Boyd said. \"It's perfectly clear. I wonder why I didn't see it\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Because you weren't looking for it,\" Malone said. \"Because nobody\nwas. But there's one more check I want to make. There's one area I'm\nnot sure of, simply because I don't have enough to go on.\"\n\n\"What area is that?\" Boyd said. \"It seems to me we did a pretty good\njob--\"\n\n\"The Mafia,\" Malone said. \"We know they're having trouble, but--\"\n\n\"But we don't know what kind of trouble,\" Boyd finished. \"Right you\nare.\"\n\nMalone nodded. \"I want to talk to Manelli,\" he said. \"Can we set it\nup?\"\n\n\"I don't see why not,\" Boyd said. \"The A-in-C can give us the latest\non him. You want me with you?\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said after some thought. \"No. You go and see Mike Sand,\nheading up the International Truckers' Union. We know he's tied up\nwith the Syndicate, and maybe you can get some information from him.\nYou know what to dig for?\"\n\n\"I do now,\" Boyd said. He reached for the intercom phone.\n\n* * * * *\n\nCesare Antonio Manelli was a second-generation Prohibition mobster,\nwhose history can most easily be described by reference to the various\naffairs of State which coincided with his development. Thus:\n\nWhen Cesare was a small toddler of uncertain gait and chubby visage,\nthe Twenty-First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States\ncanceled out not only the Eighteenth Amendment, but the thriving\nenterprises conducted by Manelli, Sr., and many of his friends.\n\nWhen Cesare was a young schoolboy, poring over the multiplication\ntables, his father and his father's friends were busy dividing. They\nwere dividing, to put it more fully, husbands from families as a means\nof requesting ransom, and money from banks as a means of getting the\nsame cash without use of the middleman, or victim. This was the period\nof the Great Readjustment, and the frenzied search among gangland's\nhigher echelons for a substitute for bootlegging.\n\nAnd when Cesare was an innocent high-schooler, sporting a Paleolithic\nswitchblade knife and black leather jacket, his father and his\nfather's friends had reached a new plateau. They consolidated into a\nSyndicate, and began to concentrate on gambling and the whole,\ncomplex, profitable network of unions.\n\nAnd then World War II had come along, and it was time for Cesare to do\nhis part. Bidding a fond farewell to his father and such of his\nfather's friends as had survived the disagreements of Prohibition, the\npainful legal processes of the early Thirties and the even more\npainful consolidations of the years immediately before the war, young\nCesare went off to foreign lands, where he distinguished himself by\ncreating and running the largest single black-market ring in all of\nSouthern Europe.\n\nCesare had followed in his father's footsteps. And, before his sudden\ndeath during a disagreement in Miami, Giacomo \"Jack the Ripper\"\nManelli was proud of his son.\n\n\"Geez,\" he often said. \"Whattakid, huh? Whattakid!\"\n\nAt the war's end, young Cesare, having proven himself a man, took unto\nhimself a nickname and a shotgun. He did not have to use the shotgun\nvery much, after the first few lessons; soon he was on his way to the\ntop.\n\nThere was nowhere for Cesare \"Big Cheese\" Antonio Manelli to go,\nexcept up.\n\nStraight up.\n\nNow, in 1973, he occupied a modestly opulent office on Madison Avenue,\nwhere he did his modest best to pretend to the world at large that he\nwas only a small cog--indeed, an almost invisible cog--in a large\nadvertising machine. His best was, for all practical purposes, good\nenough.\n\nThough it was common knowledge among the spoil-sport law enforcement\nofficers who cared to look into the matter that Manelli was the real\nowner of the agency, there was no way to prove this. He didn't even\nhave a phone under his own name. The only way to reach him was by\ngoing through his front man in the agency, a blank-faced, truculent\nArab named Atif Abdullah Aoud.\n\nAccording to the agent-in-charge of the New York office, Malone had\nhis choice of two separate methods of getting to Manelli. One, more\ndirect, was to walk in, announce that he was an agent of the FBI, and\ninsist on seeing Manelli. If he had a search warrant, the A-in-C told\nhim, he might even get in. But, even if he did, he would probably not\nget anything out of Manelli.\n\nThe second and more diplomatic way was to call up Atif Abdullah Aoud\nand arrange for an appointment.\n\nMalone made his decision in a flash. He flipped on the phone and\npunched for a PLaza exchange.\n\nThe face that appeared on the screen was that of a fairly pretty, if\nsomewhat vapid, brunette. \"Rodger, Willcoe, O'Vurr and Aoud, good\nafternoon,\" she said.\n\nMalone blinked.\n\n\"Who is calling, please?\" the girl said. She snapped gum at the screen\nand Malone winced and drew away.\n\n\"This is Kenneth J. Malone,\" he said from what he considered a safe\ndistance. \"I want to talk to Mr. Aoud.\"\n\n\"Mr. Aoud?\" she said in a high, unhelpful whine.\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said patiently. \"You can tell him that there\nmay be some government business coming his way.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"But Mr. Aoud isn't in.\"\n\nMr. Aoud wasn't in. Mr. Aoud was out. Malone turned that over in his\nmind a few times, and decided to try and forget it just as quickly as\npossible. \"Then,\" he said, \"let me talk to one of the other partners.\"\n\n\"Partners?\" the girl said. She popped her gum again. Malone moved back\nanother inch.\n\n\"You know,\" he said. \"The other people he works with. Rodger, or\nWillcoe, or O'Vurr.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" the girl said. \"Them.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said patiently.\n\n\"How about Mr. Willcoe?\" the girl said after a second of deep and\nearnest thought. \"Would he do?\"\n\n\"Why not let's try him and see?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Okay,\" the girl said brightly. \"Let's.\" She flashed Malone a dazzling\nsmile, only slightly impeded by the gum, and flipped off. Malone\nstared at the blank screen for a few seconds, and then the girl's\nvoice said, invisibly: \"Mr. Willcoe will speak to you now, Mr. Melon.\nThank you for waiting.\"\n\n\"I'm not--\" Malone started to say, and then the face of Frederick\nWillcoe appeared on the screen.\n\nWillcoe was a thin, wrinkle-faced man with very pale skin. He seemed\nto be in his sixties, and he looked as if he had just lost an\nall-night bout with Count Dracula. Malone looked interestedly for\npuncture marks, but failed to find any.\n\n\"Ah,\" Willcoe said, in a voice that sounded like crinkled paper. \"Mr.\nMelon. Good afternoon.\"\n\n\"I'm not Mr. Melon,\" Malone said testily.\n\nWillcoe looked gently surprised, like a man who has discovered that\nhis evening sherry contains cholesterol. \"Really?\" he said. \"Then I\nmust be on the wrong line. I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"You're not on the wrong line,\" Malone said. \"I am Mr. Melon in a\nway.\" That didn't sound very clear when he got it out, so he added:\n\"Your secretary got my name wrong. She thinks I'm Mr. Melon--Kenneth\nJ. Melon.\"\n\n\"But you're not,\" Willcoe said.\n\nMalone resisted an impulse to announce that he was really Lamont\nCranston. \"I'm Kenneth J. Malone,\" he said.\n\n\"Ah,\" Willcoe said. \"Quite amusing. Imagine my mistaking you for a Mr.\nMelon, when you're really Mr. Malone.\" He paused, and his face got\neven more wrinkled. \"But I don't know you under either name,\" he said.\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I want to talk to Mr. Manelli,\" Malone said.\n\n\"But Mr. Aoud--\"\n\n\"Mr. Aoud,\" Malone said, wondering if it sounded as silly to Willcoe\nas it did to him, \"isn't in. So I thought you might be able to arrange\nan appointment for this afternoon.\"\n\nWillcoe bit his lip. \"Mr. Manelli isn't in just now,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Malone said. \"I didn't think he would be. That's why I want to\narrange an appointment for later, when he _will_ be in.\"\n\n\"Does Mr. Manelli know you?\" Willcoe said suspiciously, the wrinkles\ndeepening again.\n\n\"He knows my boss,\" Malone said carefully. \"You just tell him that\nthis is something that ought to be worth time and money to him. His\ntime, and his money.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" Willcoe said. \"I see. Would you wait a moment, Mr. Mel--Mr.\nMalone?\"\n\nThe screen blanked out immediately. The wait this time was slightly\nlonger.\n\nAnd the next face that appeared on the screen was that of Cesare \"Big\nCheese\" Antonio Manelli, the nearly invisible cog.\n\nFor a cog, the face was not a bad one. It was strong and well-muscled,\nand it had dark, wavy hair running along the top. At the sides of the\nface, the hair was greying slightly, and behind the grey two large\nears stuck out. Manelli's nose was a long, faintly aquiline affair and\nhis eyes were very pleasant and candid. They were light grey.\n\n\"Aha,\" Manelli said. \"You are Mr. Malone, right?\" His voice was\nguttural, but it was obvious that he was trying for control. \"I regret\nannouncing that I was out, Mr. Malone,\" he said. \"But a man in my\nposition--I like privacy, Mr. Malone, and I try to keep privacy for\nmyself. Let me request you to answer a question, Mr. Malone: do I know\nyou, Mr. Malone?\"\n\n\"Not personally,\" Malone said. \"I--\"\n\n\"But I'm supposed to know your boss,\" Manelli said. \"I don't know him,\neither, so far.\"\n\nMalone shrugged. \"I'm sure you do,\" he said, and dropped the name\nalmost casually: \"Andrew J. Burris.\"\n\nManelli raised his eyebrows. \"So that's who you are,\" he said. \"I\nought to have known, Mr. Malone. And you want to talk to me a little\nbit, right?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said.\n\n\"But this is no way to act, Mr. Malone,\" Manelli said reproachfully.\n\"After all, we understand each other, you and me. What you should do,\nyou should come in through channels, in the correct way, so everything\nit would be open and above the board.\"\n\n\"Through channels?\" Malone said.\n\nManelli regarded him with a pitying glance. \"You must be new on your\njob, Mr. Malone,\" he said. \"Because there is an entire system built\nup, and you don't know about it. The way things work, we sit around\nand we don't see people. And then somebody comes and presents his\ncredentials, you might say--search warrants, for instance, or\nsubpoenas. And then we know where we are.\"\n\nMalone shook his head. \"This isn't that kind of call,\" he said. \"It's\nmore a friendly type of call.\"\n\n\"Mr. Malone,\" Manelli said. The reproach was stronger in his voice.\n\"You must be very new at your job.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" Malone said.\n\nManelli hesitated only a second. \"Because I like you,\" he said, \"and\nto teach you how things operate around here, I could do you a favor.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said patiently.\n\n\"In an hour,\" Manelli said. \"My place. Here.\"\n\nThe screen blanked out before Malone could even say goodbye.\n\nMalone got up, went out to the corridor, and decided that, since he\nhad time to kill, he might as well walk on down to Manelli's office.\nThat, he told himself, would give him time to decide what he wanted to\nsay.\n\nHe toyed at first with the idea of a nice bourbon and soda in a\nMadison Avenue bar, but he discarded that idea in a hurry. It was\nalways possible for him to get into a tight spot and have to teleport\nhis way out, and he didn't want to be fuzzy around the edges in case\nthat happened. _Trotkin's_ had showed him that, under enough stress,\nhe could manage the job with quite a lot of vodka in him. But there\nwas absolutely no sense, he told himself sadly, in taking chances.\n\nHe started off downtown along Fifth. Soon he was standing in front of\nthe blue-and-crystal tower of the Ravell Building.\n\nThat made up his mind for him. He checked his watch, mentally flipped\na coin and then cheated a little to make the answer come out right. He\nwent inside and stepped into an elevator.\n\n\"Six,\" he said with decision.\n\nLou was sitting at the Psychical Research Society desk, talking to the\ntweedy Sir Lewis Carter. Malone waved at Carter, decided that\nconversation with Lou was out, and started to walk away. Then he\nrealized that he couldn't have Carter thinking he was crazy. He had to\nfigure out something to tell the man--and in a hurry, too.\n\nCarter smiled and gestured to him. \"Ah, Mr. Malone,\" he said. \"I'm\nglad you brought our Lou home safely. I've heard a little about your--\nah--escapade. Astounding, really.\"\n\n\"Not for the FBI,\" Malone said modestly. \"We've been through too\nmuch.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"No, really,\" Malone said. \"We never call anything astounding any\nmore.\"\n\n\"I can well imagine,\" Carter said. \"Is there anything I can do for\nyou?\"\n\nMalone thought fast. He had to have something, and he didn't have much\ntime. \"Why--uh--\" he said, and then it came to him. \"Yes, as a matter\nof fact you can,\" he said.\n\n\"Glad to be of service,\" Carter said. \"I'm sure we can do anything you\nrequest.\"\n\n\"Have you got any more data on telepathic projection?\" Malone said.\n\nSir Lewis Carter frowned. \"Telepathic projection?\" he said.\n\n\"The stuff--the phenomenon Cartier Taylor mentioned,\" Malone said, \"in\n_Minds and Morons_. I think it was page eighty-four.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Carter said. \"Oh, yes. Of course. Well, Mr. Malone, we'll see\nwhat we can do for you.\"\n\nMalone sighed. \"Thanks,\" he said mournfully. \"I guess--I guess that's\nall, then.\" He smiled at Lou, and turned the smile into a terrifying\nscowl when his eye caught Carter's. \"Oh,\" Malone said. \"So long. So\nlong, everybody.\"\n\n\"Ken--\"\n\nThis was not, he told himself sadly, either the time or the place.\n\"Goodbye, Sir Lewis,\" he said. \"Goodbye, Lou.\"\n\nThe elevator opened its doors and received him.\n\n* * * * *\n\nExactly fifty-nine minutes after Cesare Manelli had hung up on him,\nMalone showed up in the stately and sumptuous suite that belonged, for\na stiff fee every month, to the firm of Rodger, Willcoe, O'Vurr and\nAoud. The girl at the desk was his old Spearmint friend.\n\n\"Mr. Manelli,\" Malone said. \"I've got an appointment. My name is\nMalone and his is Manelli. He works here.\" That, he told himself, was\nan understatement; but at least he had a chance of getting his point\nacross.\n\n\"Oh,\" the girl said. Her gum popped. \"Certainly. Right away, Mr.\nMaloney.\"\n\nMalone opened his mouth, then shut it again. It just wasn't worth the\ntrouble, he thought.\n\nThe girl did things with a switchboard, then turned to him again. \"Mr.\nManelli's office is right down there in back,\" she said, pointing\nvaguely. \"Think you can find it, Mr. Maloney?\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" Malone promised. He went down the long corridor and\nstopped at an unmarked door. It was at least an even chance, he told\nhimself, and opened the door.\n\nThe room inside appeared to be mostly desk. The gigantic slab of wood\nsat against the far wall of the room, in the right-hand corner and\nspreading over toward the center. It appeared, in the soft half-light\nof the room, to be waiting for somebody to walk into its lair. Malone\nwas sure, at first sight, that this desk ate people; it was just the\ntype: big and dark and glowering and massive.\n\nThere wasn't anybody seated behind it, which reinforced his belief.\nThe desk had eaten its master. Now it was out of control and they\nwould have to have it shot. Malone took a deep breath and tried not to\nveer.\n\nThen he heard a voice.\n\n\"Sit down, Mr. Malone,\" the voice said. \"How about you having a drink\nwhile we talk? If this is going to be so friendly.\"\n\nThe voice didn't belong to the desk. It belonged, unmistakably, to Big\nCheese himself. Malone turned and saw him, sitting in the left-hand\ncorner of the room behind a low table. There was another empty chair\nfacing Manelli, and Malone went over and sat in it.\n\n\"A drink?\" he said. \"Okay. Sure.\"\n\n\"Bourbon and soda, isn't it?\" Manelli said. He stood up.\n\n\"Your research department gets fast answers,\" Malone said. \"Bourbon\nand soda it is.\"\n\n\"After all,\" Manelli said, shrugging slightly, \"a person in my\nposition, he has to make sure he knows what is what, and all the time.\nIt's routine, what you call S. O. P. Standard Operating Procedure,\nthey call it.\"\n\n\"I'm sure they do,\" Malone murmured politely.\n\n\"And besides,\" Manelli said, \"you are a well-known type. I thought I\nknew the name when old Fred mentioned it, or I would never talk to\nyou. You know how it is.\"\n\nMalone nodded. \"Well,\" he said, as Manelli went over to a small\nportable bar at the back of the room and got busy, \"we're being frank,\nanyway.\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't we be frank, Mr. Malone?\" Manelli said. \"It's a\nnice, friendly conversation, and what have we got on our minds?\"\n\nFor the first time, as he turned, Malone got a glimpse of something\nbehind the structured and muscular face. There was panic there, just a\ntiny seed under iron control, but it showed in the eyes and in the\nmuscles of the cheek.\n\n\"Just a nice, friendly conversation,\" Malone said. Manelli brought the\ndrinks over and set them on the table.\n\n\"Take your pick,\" he said. \"That's not what a good host should do, ask\nthe guest to pick one, like a game; but I got into the habit. People\nget nervous about arsenic in the drinks. Which is silly.\"\n\n\"Sure it is,\" Malone agreed. He picked up the left-hand glass and\nregarded it carefully. \"If you wanted to kill me, you'd need a motive\nand an opportunity, and you don't have either at the moment. Besides,\nyou'd make sure to be far away when it happened.\" He hoped he sounded\nconfident. He took a sip of the drink, but it tasted like bourbon and\nsoda.\n\n\"Mr. Malone,\" Manelli said, \"you say these things about me, and it\nhurts. It hurts me, right here.\" He pressed a hand over the checkbook\nside of his jacket. \"I'm a legitimate businessman, and no different\nfrom any other legitimate businessman. You can't prove anything else.\"\n\n\"I know I can't,\" Malone said. \"But I want to talk to you about your\nreal business.\"\n\n\"This is my real business,\" Manelli said. \"The advertising agency. I\nwork here. Advertising is in my blood. And I don't understand the\nleast little bit why you have to do things to me all the time.\"\n\n\"Do things?\" Malone said. \"What did I do?\"\n\n\"Now, Mr. Malone,\" Manelli said. He took a swallow of his drink. \"You\nsaid let's be frank, so I'm frank. Why not you?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about,\" Malone said, telling part of\nthe truth.\n\nManelli took another swallow of his drink, fished in a jacket pocket\nand brought out two cigars. \"Smoke, Mr. Malone?\" he said. \"The very\nbest, from Havana, Cuba. Cost me a dollar and a half each.\"\n\nMalone looked with longing at the cigar. But it was okay for Manelli\nto smoke cigars, he thought bitterly. Manelli was a gangster, and who\ncared how he looked? Malone was an FBI man, and FBI men didn't smoke\ncigars. Particularly Havana cigars. That, he told himself with\nregretful firmness, was that.\n\n\"No, thanks,\" he said. \"I never smoke on duty.\"\n\nManelli shrugged and put one cigar away. He lit the other one and\ndense clouds of smoke began to rise in the room. Malone breathed\ndeeply.\n\n\"I understand you've been having troubles,\" he said.\n\nManelli nodded. \"Now, you see, Mr. Malone?\" he said. \"You tell me you\ndon't know what's happening, but you know I got troubles. How come,\nMr. Malone? How come?\"\n\n\"Because you have got troubles,\" Malone said. \"But I have nothing to\ndo with them.\" He hesitated, thought of adding: \"Yet,\" and decided\nagainst it.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Malone,\" Manelli said. \"You know better than that.\"\n\n\"I do?\" Malone said.\n\nManelli sighed, took another swallow of his drink and dragged deeply\non the cigar. \"Let's take a for-instance,\" he said. \"Now, you\nunderstand my business is advertising, Mr. Malone?\"\n\n\"It's in your blood,\" Malone said, involuntarily.\n\n\"Right,\" Manelli said. \"But I think about things. I like to figure\nthings out. In a sort of a theoretical way, like a for-instance.\nUnderstand?\"\n\n\"What sort of theoretical story are you going to tell me?\" Malone\nsaid.\n\nManelli leaned back in his chair. \"Let's take, for instance, some\nnumbers runners who had some trouble the other day, got beat up and\nmoney taken from them. Maybe you read about it in the papers.\"\n\n\"I haven't been following the papers much,\" Malone said.\n\n\"That's all right,\" Manelli said grandly. \"Maybe it wasn't _in_ the\npapers. But anyhow, I figured out maybe that happened. I had nothing\nto do with this, Mr. Malone; you understand that? But I figured out\nhow maybe it happened.\"\n\n\"How?\" Malone said.\n\nManelli took another puff on his cigar. \"Maybe there was an error at a\nracetrack--we could say Jamaica, for instance, just for laughs. And\nmaybe two different totals were published for the pari-mutuel numbers,\nand both got given out. So the numbers runners got all fouled up, so\nthey got beat up and money taken from them.\"\n\n\"It could have happened that way,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I figure maybe the FBI had something to do with this,\" Manelli said.\n\n\"We didn't,\" Malone said. \"Frankly.\"\n\n\"And that's not all,\" Manelli said. \"Let's say at Jamaica one day\nthere was a race.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said agreeably. \"That doesn't require a whole lot\nof imagination.\"\n\n\"And let's say,\" Manelli went on, \"that the bookies--if there are any\nbookies in this town; who knows?--that they got the word about who\ncame in, win, place and show.\"\n\n\"Sounds natural,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Sure it does,\" Manelli said. \"But there was a foul-up someplace,\nbecause the win animal was disqualified and nobody heard about it\nuntil after a lot of payoffs were made. That costs money.\" He stopped.\n\"I mean it would cost money, if it happened,\" he finished.\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Certainly would.\"\n\n\"And you tell me it's not the FBI?\" Manelli said.\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said. \"As a matter of fact, we're investigating\nthings like these confusions and inefficiencies all over.\"\n\nManelli finished his drink in one long, amazed swallow. \"Now, wait a\nminute,\" he said. \"Let's say for a joke, like, for laughs, that I am\nsome kind of a wheel in these things, in bookies and numbers boys and\nlike that.\"\n\n\"Let's call it a syndicate,\" Malone said. \"Just for laughs.\"\n\n\"Okay, then,\" Manelli said, with a suspicious gaze at Malone.\n\"Whatever you call it, a man like me today, he wouldn't be some\ntwo-bit chiseler without brains. He would be a businessman, a\nsmooth-operating smart businessman. Right?\"\n\n\"Right,\" Malone said. \"And what I want to know is: how's business?\"\n\n\"You're kidding?\" Manelli said.\n\n\"I'm not kidding,\" Malone said. \"I mean it. The FBI's investigating\nmix-ups just like the ones you're telling me about. We want to stop\nthem.\"\n\nManelli blinked. \"You know, Mr. Malone,\" he said softly, \"I heard\nabout government interference in private enterprise, but don't you\nthink this is a little too far out?\"\n\nMalone shrugged. \"That's what I'm here for,\" he said. \"Take it or\nleave it.\"\n\n\"Just so it's understood,\" Manelli said, \"that we're talking about\nimaginary things. Theoretical.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"Imagine away.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Manelli said slowly, \"you heard about this wrecked night-club\nin Florida? It happened maybe a month ago, in Miami?\"\n\n\"I heard about it,\" Malone said.\n\n\"This is just a for-instance, you know,\" Manelli said. \"But suppose\nthere was a roulette wheel in that club. Just a wheel.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And suppose the wheel was rigged a little bit,\" Manelli said. \"Not\nseriously, just a little bit.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"This is going to explain a wrecked club?\"\n\n\"Well, sure,\" Manelli said. \"Because something went wrong with the\nmachinery, or maybe the operator goofed up. And number seven came up\neight times in a row.\"\n\n\"Good old lucky seven,\" Malone said.\n\n\"So there was a riot,\" Manelli said. \"Because some people had money on\nthe number, and some people got suspicious, and like that. And there\nwas a riot.\"\n\n\"And the club got wrecked,\" Malone said. \"That's what I call bad\nluck.\"\n\n\"Luck?\" Manelli said. \"What does luck have to do with roulette?\nSomebody goofed, that's all.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Sure.\"\n\n\"And that's the way it's been going,\" Manelli said. He puffed on his\ncigar, put it in a nearby ashtray, and blew out a great Vesuvian spout\nof smoke.\n\n\"Too bad,\" Malone said sympathetically.\n\n\"It's all over,\" Manelli said. \"Mistakes and people making the\nmistakes, goofing up here and there and everyplace. There have been\nguys killed because they made mistakes, and nobody can afford guys\nbeing killed all the time.\"\n\n\"It does run into expense,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And time, and hiring guys to do the killing, and then they goof up,\ntoo,\" Manelli said. \"It's terrible. Some guys have even been killed\nwithout they made any mistakes at all. Just by accident, sort of.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said carefully, \"you can depend on the government to do\neverything in its power to straighten things out.\"\n\nManelli frowned. \"You mean that, Mr. Malone?\"\n\n\"Of course I do,\" Malone said honestly. He hadn't, he reminded\nhimself, promised to help Manelli. He had only promised to straighten\nthings out. And he could figure out what that might mean later, when\nhe had the time.\n\n\"All I say is, it's funny,\" Manelli said. \"It's crazy.\"\n\n\"That's the way it is,\" Malone said.\n\nManelli looked at him narrowly. \"Mr. Malone,\" he said at last, \"maybe\nyou mean it at that. Maybe you do.\"\n\n\"Sure I do,\" Malone said. \"After all, the government is supposed to\nhelp its citizens.\"\n\nManelli shook his head. \"Mr. Malone,\" he said, \"you can call me\nCesare. Everybody does.\"\n\n\"No, they don't,\" Malone said. \"They call you Cheese. I've got a\nresearch staff too.\"\n\n\"So call me Cheese,\" Manelli said. \"I don't mind.\"\n\n\"There's only one little trouble,\" Malone said. \"If I called you\nCheese, you'd call me Ken. And word would get around.\"\n\n\"I see what you mean,\" Manelli said.\n\n\"I don't think either one of us wants his associates to think we're\nfriends,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I guess not,\" Manelli said. \"It would cause uneasiness.\"\n\n\"And a certain lack of confidence,\" Malone said. \"So suppose I go on\ncalling you Mr. Manelli?\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Manelli said. \"And I'll call you Mr. Malone, like always.\"\n\nMalone smiled and stood up. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"good-bye, Mr.\nManelli.\"\n\nManelli rose, too. \"Goodbye, Mr. Malone,\" he said. \"And good luck, if\nyou really mean what you said.\"\n\n\"Oh, I do,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Because things are terrible,\" Manelli said. \"And they're getting\nworse every day. You should only know.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Malone said. \"Things will be straightened out pretty\nsoon.\" He hoped, as he went out the door and down the corridor, that\nhe was telling the truth there, at least. He'd sounded fairly\nconfident, he thought, but he didn't feel quite so confident. The\nsecretary was busy on the switchboard when he came out into the\nanteroom, and he went by without a greeting, his mind busy, churning\nand confused.\n\nHe felt as if his head were on just a little crooked. Or as if, maybe,\nhe had a small hole in it somewhere and facts were leaking out onto\nthe sidewalk.\n\nIf he only looked at the problem in the right way, he told himself, he\nwould see just what was going on.\n\nBut what was the right way?\n\n\"That,\" Malone murmured as he hailed a cab for the ride back to 69th\nStreet, \"is the big, sixty-four-thousand-dollar question. And how much\ntime do I have for an answer?\"\n\n\n11\n\n\"Boyd?\" the agent-in-charge said. \"He went out to talk to Mike Sand\ndown at the ITU a while ago, and he hasn't come back yet.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"I'll be in my office if he wants me.\"\n\nThe agent-in-charge picked up a small package. \"A messenger brought\nthis,\" he said. \"It's from the Psychical Research Society, and if it's\nghosts, they're much smaller than last time.\"\n\n\"Dehydrated,\" Malone said. \"Just add ectoplasm and out they come,\nshouting _boo_ at everybody and dancing all over the world.\"\n\n\"Sounds wonderful,\" the agent-in-charge said. \"Can I come to the\nparty?\"\n\n\"First,\" Malone said judiciously, \"you'd have to be dead. Of course, I\ncan arrange that--\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" the agent-in-charge said, leaving in a hurry. Malone went on\ndown to his office and opened the package. It contained more\nfacsimiles from Sir Lewis Carter, all dealing with telepathic\nprojection. He spent a few minutes looking them over and trying to\nmake some connected sense out of them, and then he just sat and\nthought for awhile.\n\nFinally he picked up the phone. In a few minutes he was talking to Dr.\nThomas O'Connor, at Yucca Flats.\n\n\"Telepathic projection?\" O'Connor said when Malone asked him the\nquestion he'd thought of. \"Well, now. I should say that--no. First,\nMr. Malone, tell me what evidence you have for this phenomenon.\"\n\nMalone felt almost happy, as if he had done all his homework before\nthe instructor called on him. \"According to what I've been able to get\nfrom the PRS,\" he said, \"ordinary people--people who aren't\ntelepaths--occasionally receive some sort of messages from other\npeople.\"\n\n\"I assume,\" O'Connor said frostily, \"that you are speaking of\ntelepathic messages?\"\n\nMalone nodded guiltily. \"I didn't mean the phone,\" he said, \"or\nletters or things like that. Telepathic messages, or something very\nlike it.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" O'Connor said. \"Mr. Malone, I believe you will find that\nsuch occurrences, when accurately reported, are confined to close\nrelatives or loved ones of the person projecting the message.\"\n\nMalone thought back. \"That's right,\" he said.\n\n\"And, further,\" O'Connor went on, \"I think you'll find that the--ah--\nmessage so received is one indicating that the projector of such a\nmessage is in dire peril. He has, for instance, been badly injured, or\nis rapidly approaching death, or else he has narrowly escaped death.\"\n\n\"True,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Under such circumstances,\" O'Connor said coldly, \"it is possible that\nthe mind of the person projecting the communication might be capable\nof generating immense psionic power, thereby forcing even a\nnon-telepath to recognize the content of the message.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said. \"That's wonderful, Doctor, and I--\"\n\n\"But,\" O'Connor said sharply, \"the amount of psionic energy necessary\nfor such a feat is tremendous. Usually, it is the final burst of\nenergy, the outpouring of all the remaining psionic force immediately\nbefore death. And if death does not occur, the person is at the least\ngreatly weakened; his mind, if it ever does recover, needs time and\nrest to do so.\"\n\nMalone let that sink in slowly. \"Then a person couldn't do it very\noften,\" he said.\n\n\"Hardly,\" O'Connor said.\n\nMalone nodded. \"It's like--like giving blood to a blood bank. Giving,\nsay, three quarts of blood. It might not kill you. But if it didn't,\nyou'd be weak for a long time.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" O'Connor said. \"A good analogy, Mr. Malone.\"\n\nMalone hated himself for it, but he felt pleased when O'Connor praised\nhim. \"Well,\" he said, \"that winds up Cartier Taylor's theory pretty\nthoroughly.\"\n\n\"I should think so,\" O'Connor said. \"I am surprised, Mr. Malone, that\nyou would put any credence whatever in that man's theories. His\nfactual data, I will admit, is fairly reliable. But his theories are--\nwell, they are hardly worth the time it takes to read them.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Malone said. \"It did seem like a good answer, though.\"\n\n\"It undoubtedly is a good one,\" O'Connor said. \"It is clever and has\nthe advantage of being simple. It is contradicted, Mr. Malone, only by\nthe facts.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said sadly. \"But--hey. Wait a minute.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" O'Connor said.\n\n\"One person couldn't do this alone, at least, not very often and not\nwithout serious harm to himself. Right?\"\n\n\"That is what I said,\" O'Connor agreed. \"Yes, Mr. Malone.\"\n\n\"But how about several people?\" Malone said. \"I mean, well, let's look\nat that blood bank again. You need three quarts of blood. But one\nperson doesn't have to give it. Suppose twelve people gave half a pint\neach. Suppose twenty-four people gave a quarter of a pint each.\nSuppose--\"\n\n\"There is,\" O'Connor said, \"a point of diminishing returns. But I do\nsee your point, Mr. Malone.\" He thought for a second. \"It might just\nbe possible,\" he said. \"At least theoretically. But it would take a\ngreat deal of mental co-ordination among the participants. They would\nhave to be telepathic themselves, for one thing.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Malone said, feeling stupid.\n\n\"Because they would have to mesh their thoughts closely enough to\ndirect them properly and at the correct time.\" O'Connor nodded. \"But,\ngiven that, I imagine that it could be done.\"\n\n\"Wonderful,\" Malone said.\n\n\"However,\" O'Connor said, apparently glad to throw even a little cold\nwater on the notion, \"it could not be done for very long periods of\ntime, you realize.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said happily.\n\n\"By the way, Mr. Malone,\" O'Connor said. \"Does this have anything to\ndo with the hypothesis you presented to me some time ago? Mass\nhypnotism, as I recall--\"\n\n\"No,\" Malone said. \"I've given that idea up for good. I think this is\nbeing done on an individual basis--working on one person at a time.\"\nThen another idea hit him. \"You say these people would have to be\ntelepaths?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" O'Connor said.\n\n\"Then wouldn't Her Majesty know about them? If they're telepaths? Or\nis there some kind of a mind shield or something that a telepath could\nwork out?\"\n\n\"Mind shield?\" O'Connor said. \"Ah, yes. Miss Thompson might be fooled\nby such a shield. It would have to be an exceptional one, but such\nthings do seem to be possible. They belong to the realm of mental\ndisciplines, of course, rather than psionics.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But there could be that kind of shield?\"\n\n\"There could,\" O'Connor said. \"The mind which created the shield for\nitself would have to be of tremendous power and a really high order of\ncontrol. A strong, sane mind might conceivably create such a block\nthat even Miss Thompson, let us say, might believe that she was\npicking up a real mind, when she was only picking up surface thoughts,\nwith the real thought hidden behind the telepathic block.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said. \"Thanks. Thanks a lot, Dr. O'Connor.\"\n\n\"I am always happy to put my extensive knowledge of science at your\ndisposal, Mr. Malone,\" O'Connor said.\n\nMalone watched the image collapse without really seeing it. Instead,\nhe was busily talking to himself, or rather to his other self.\n\n\"Well, now, Sir Kenneth,\" he said. \"Let's pull all the facts together\nand see what happens.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Mr. Malone,\" said Sir Kenneth Malone, \"it is time that we\ndid. Proceed, Sirrah. I shall attend.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Let's start from the beginning,\" Malone said. \"We know there's\nconfusion in all parts of the country, in all parts of the world, I\nguess. And we know that confusion is being caused by carefully timed\naccidents and errors. We also know that these errors appear to be\naccompanied by violent bursts of psionic static--violent energy. And\nwe know, further, that on three specific occasions, these bursts of\nenergy were immediately followed by a reversal of policy in the mind\nof the person on the receiving end.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" Sir Kenneth put in, \"that they changed their minds.\"\n\n\"Correct,\" Malone said. \"I refer, of course, to the firm of Brubitsch,\nBorbitsch and Garbitsch, Spying Done Cheap.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" Sir Kenneth said. \"Then the operators of this force,\nwhatever it may be, have some interest in allowing these spies to\nconfess?\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Malone said. \"Let's leave that for later. To get back to the\nbeginning of all this: it seems to me to follow that the accidents and\nerrors which have caused all the confusion through the United States\nand Russia are caused by somebody's mind being changed at exactly the\nright moment. A man does something just a little differently than he\ndecided to--or else he forgets to do it at all.\"\n\n\"Correct,\" Sir Kenneth said. \"And you feel, Mr. Malone, that a\ntelepathic command is the cause of this confusion?\"\n\n\"A series of them,\" Malone said. \"But we also know, from Dr. O'Connor,\nthat it takes a great deal of psychic energy to perform this\nparticular trick--more than a person can normally afford to expend.\"\n\n\"Marry, now,\" Sir Kenneth exclaimed, \"such a statement does not seem\nto have reason in it. Changing the mind of a man seems a small thing\nin comparison to teleportation, or psychokinesis, or levitation. And\nyet it takes more power than any of these?\"\n\nMalone thought for a second. \"Sure it does,\" he said. \"I'd say it was\na matter of resistance. Moving an inanimate object is pretty simple--\ncomparatively, anyhow--because inert matter has no mental resistance.\"\n\n\"And moving yourself?\" Sir Kenneth said.\n\n\"There is some resistance there, probably,\" Malone said. \"But you'll\nremember that part of the Fueyo training system for teleportation\ninvolved overcoming your own mental resistance to the idea.\"\n\n\"True,\" Sir Kenneth said. \"Quite true. Then let us say that it\nrequires enormous power to effect these changes. What is our next\nstep, Mr. Malone?\"\n\n\"Next, Sir Kenneth,\" Malone said, \"We have to do a little supposing.\nThis project must be handled by a fairly large group, since no\nindividual can work it. This large group has to be telepathic, and not\nonly for the precise timing O'Connor specified.\"\n\n\"There is another reason?\" Sir Kenneth said.\n\n\"There is,\" Malone said. \"They've also got to know exactly when to\nmake their victim change his mind. Right?\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" said Sir Kenneth. \"Now, Sirrah, where does all this\nleave us? We have had the orderly presentation of the case; where,\nSirrah, is your summation?\"\n\n\"Coming up,\" Malone said. \"We've got to look for a widespread\norganization of telepaths, with enough mental discipline to hold a\nmental shield that Her Majesty can't crack, and can't even recognize\nthe existence of. We thought she'd found all the telepaths. She said\nso, and she obviously thought so. But she didn't. These are strong,\ntrained--and sane.\"\n\n\"Aha,\" said Sir Kenneth.\n\n\"Her Majesty,\" Malone said, \"found us only the crazy telepaths, the\nweak ones, the nuts.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said Sir Kenneth. \"And this, Mr. Malone, leaves us with only\none question. Her Majesty--may God bless her--stated that she first\nspotted these flashes of telepathic static by listening in on our\nminds.\"\n\n\"Our mind,\" Malone said. \"I hope.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Sir Kenneth said. \"This means that some force is being\ndirected in this way, toward us. And how do we know that all the\ndeduction, all the careful case-building we have done, hasn't been\ninfluenced by this group? That might mean, of course, that we are\nmiles, or even light-years, from the solution.\"\n\nMalone said: \"Yeep.\" The sound was echoed by Sir Kenneth, and the two\nhalves of the coruscating mind of Kenneth J. Malone were once more\none.\n\n_Your Majesty,_ the minds thought, _I'd like to talk to you._\n\nNothing happened. Evidently, Her Majesty was temporarily out of mental\ncontact with him.\n\n\"Hell,\" Malone said. \"Not to mention od's blood.\" He flipped on the\nvisiphone and dialed Yucca Flats.\n\nThe figure that appeared on the screen was that of a tall,\nsolidly-built man with a red face and the uniform of a Beefeater. This\nTower Warder had the British royal crest embroidered on his chest, and\nthe letters: \"E. R.\"\n\n\"Good evening, Sir Kenneth,\" he said politely.\n\nMalone had sometimes wondered what it would be like to be on the\nQueen's permanent, personal staff. Evidently, it soaked in so\nthoroughly that one began to stay in character all the time. The\nlittle old lady's delusion was such a pleasant one that it was\npainlessly infectious.\n\n\"I'd like to speak to Her Majesty, Colonel Fairfax,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Her Majesty,\" Colonel Fairfax said with regret, \"is asleep, sir. I\nunderstand that she has had rather a trying time, of late.\"\n\n\"Then I must ask you to wake her,\" Malone said. \"I don't want to\ndisturb her any more than you do, Colonel, but this is important.\"\n\n\"Her Majesty's rest,\" Colonel Fairfax said gently, \"is also important,\nSir Kenneth.\"\n\n\"This is more important,\" Malone said. \"I know how you feel, but it's\nnecessary to wake her.\"\n\nThe screen blanked out.\n\nMalone sighed and began to sing softly to himself while he waited:\n\n\"The soldiers of the Queen are linked in friendly tether--\nAnd if she's off her bean, we'll all go nuts together...\"\n\nHer Majesty appeared at this point, dressed in a silken robe bearing\nher crest and initials (E. R., rather than R. T., of course), and\nwearing a silken Mother Hubbard cap on her head. \"Oh, dear,\" she said\ninstantly. \"Are you still worried about them?\"\n\n\"The flashes?\" Malone said. \"That's right. You tuned in on my mind\nright away, didn't you?\"\n\n\"As soon as I got your message,\" she said. \"I like your little song,\nat least, I think I do.\"\n\nMalone blushed faintly. \"Sorry,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, don't be, Sir Kenneth,\" Her Majesty said. \"After all, I do allow\nmy subjects a good deal of liberty; it is theirs to make use of.\" She\nsmiled at him. \"Actually, I should have told you, Sir Kenneth. But it\nseemed so natural that I--that I forgot it.\"\n\n_Oh, no,_ Malone thought.\n\n\"I'm afraid so,\" Her Majesty said. \"When I told you about the\ninterference, your mind quite automatically began to build what I\nthink of as a--as a defense against it. A shield, so to speak.\"\n\n_Me?_ Malone thought.\n\n\"Most certainly,\" Her Majesty said. \"You know, Sir Kenneth, you have a\nvery strong mind.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" Malone said aloud. \"Sometimes I don't feel so\nbright.\"\n\n\"I'm not talking about intelligence,\" Her Majesty said. \"The two\nproperties are interconnected, of course, but they are not identical.\nAfter all ... well, never mind. But you have strength of will, Sir\nKenneth, and strength of purpose. As a matter of fact, you have been\nbuilding your strength in the last few days.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Malone said, surprised.\n\n\"It's become more and more difficult,\" Her Majesty said, \"to see into\nthe depths of your mind, during the past few days. The surface of your\nmind is as easy to read as ever, but it's hard to see what's going on\nin the depths.\"\n\n\"I'm not doing it deliberately,\" Malone said.\n\n\"In any case,\" Her Majesty said, \"this process has been going on ever\nsince you knew that telepathy was possible, two years ago. But in the\npast forty-eight hours matters have accelerated tremendously.\"\n\n\"That sounds good,\" Malone said. \"Does it mean these mind-changers\nI've been thinking about can't get through to me?\"\n\n\"What mind-changers?\" the Queen said. \"Oh. I see.\" She paused. \"Well,\nI can't be positive about this, Sir Kenneth; it's all so new, you\nknow. All I can tell you is that there haven't been any flashes of\ntelepathic energy in your mind in the last forty-eight hours.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said doubtfully, \"that's something. And I am sorry I\nhad to wake you, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's perfectly all right,\" she said. \"I know you're working\nhard to restore order to the realm, and it is the duty of any\nSovereign to give such aid as she can to her Royal subjects.\"\n\nMalone cleared his throat. \"I trust,\" he said, \"Your Majesty will ever\nfind me a faithful servant.\"\n\nHer Majesty smiled. \"I'm sure I shall,\" she said. \"Good night, Sir\nKenneth.\"\n\n\"Good night,\" he said, and flipped off. At once, the phone chimed\nagain.\n\nHe flipped the switch on. \"Malone here,\" he said.\n\nBoyd's face appeared on the screen. \"Ken,\" he said fervently, \"I am\nvery glad you're still in town.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone said politely. \"But what about Mike Sand? Any\ninformation?\"\n\n\"Plenty,\" Boyd said. \"I damn near didn't believe it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, you didn't believe it?\" Malone said. \"Isn't the\ninformation any good?\"\n\n\"It's good, all right,\" Boyd said. \"It's great. He practically talked\nhis head off to me. Gave me all his books, including secret sets. And\nI've put him under arrest as a material witness--at his own request.\"\n\n\"It sounds,\" Malone said, \"as if Mike Sand has had a sudden and\nsurprising change of heart.\"\n\n\"Doesn't it, though,\" Boyd said. \"We can crack the ITU wide open now,\nand I mean really wide open.\"\n\n\"Same pattern?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Of course it is,\" Boyd said. \"What does it sound like? Same pattern.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said. \"Get on up here. I'll talk to you later.\"\n\nHe cut off in a hurry, leaned back in his chair and started to think.\nAt first, he thought of a cigar. Boyd, he figured, couldn't be back in\nthe office for some time, and nobody else would come in. He locked the\ndoor, drew out the cigar-laden box he kept in his desk in New York,\nand lit up with great satisfaction.\n\nWhen the cloud of smoke around his head was dense enough to cut with a\nknife, he went back to more serious subjects. He didn't have to worry\ntoo much about his mind being spied on; if Her Majesty couldn't read\nhis deepest thoughts, and the mind-changers weren't throwing any bolts\nof static in his direction, he was safe.\n\nNow, then, he told himself--and sneezed.\n\nHe shook his head, cursed slightly, and went on.\n\nNow, then...\n\nThere was an organization, spread all over the Western world, and with\nsecret branches, evidently, in the Soviet Union. The organization had\nto be an old one, because it had to have trained telepaths of such a\nhigh degree of efficiency that they could evade Her Majesty's probing\nwithout her even being aware of the evasion. And training took time.\n\nThere was something else to consider, too. In order to organize to\nsuch a degree that they could wreak the efficient, complete havoc they\nwere wreaking, the organization couldn't be completely secret; there\nare always leaks, always suspicious events, and a secret society that\ncovered all of those up would have no time for anything else.\n\nSo the organization had to be a known one, a known group, masquerading\nas something else.\n\nSo far, everything made sense. Malone took another deep, grateful puff\non the cigar, and frowned. Where, he wondered, did he go from here?\n\nHe reached for a pencil and a piece of paper. He headed the paper:\n_Organization._ Then he started putting down what he knew about it,\nand what he'd figured out.\n\n     1. Large\n     2. Old\n     3. Disguised\n\nIt sounded just a little like Frankenstein's Monster, so far. But what\nelse did he know about it?\n\nAfter a second's thought, he murmured: \"Nothing,\" and took another\npuff.\n\nBut that wasn't quite true.\n\nHe knew one more thing about the organization. He knew they'd probably\nbe immune to the confusion everybody else was suffering from. The\norganization would be--had to be--efficient. It would be composed of\nintelligent, superbly cooperative people, who could work together as a\nunit without in the least impairing their own individuality.\n\nHe reached for the list again, put down:\n\n     4. Efficient\n\nAnd looked at it. Now it didn't remind him quite so much of the\nMonster. But it didn't look familiar, either. Who did he know, he\nthought, who was large, old, disguised and efficient?\n\nIt sounded like an improbable combination. He set the list down again,\nclearing off some of the papers the PRS had sent him to make room for\nit.\n\nThen he stopped.\n\nThe papers the PRS had sent him...\n\nAnd he'd gotten them so quickly, so efficiently...\n\nThey were a large organization...\n\nAnd an old one...\n\nHe tossed the cigar in the general direction of the ashtray, grabbed\nthe phone and jabbed at buttons.\n\nThe girl who answered the phone looked familiar. She did not look very\nold, but she was large and she had to be disguised, Malone thought.\nNobody could naturally have that many teeth.\n\n\"Psychical Research Society,\" she said. \"Oh, Mr. Malone, good\nevening.\"\n\n\"Sir Lewis,\" Malone said. \"Sir Lewis Carter. President. I want to talk\nto him. Hurry.\"\n\n\"Sir Lewis?\" the girl said slowly. \"Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Malone, but the\noffice is closed now for the day. And Sir Lewis has gone already. It's\nafter six o'clock, Mr. Malone, and the office is closed.\"\n\n\"Home number,\" Malone said desperately. \"I've got to.\"\n\n\"Well, I can do that, Mr. Malone,\" she said, \"but it wouldn't do you\nany good, really. Because he went away on his vacation, and when he\ngoes on his vacation he never tells us where. You know? He won't be\nback for two or three weeks.\"\n\n\"Oog,\" Malone said, and thought for less than a second. \"Miss\nGarbitsch,\" he said. \"Lou. Got to talk to her. Now.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can't do that, either, Mr. Malone,\" the toothy girl said. \"All\nof the executive officers, they left already on their vacation. And\nthat includes Miss Garbitsch, too. They just left a skeleton force\nhere at the office.\"\n\n\"They're all gone?\" Malone said hollowly.\n\n\"That's right,\" she said cheerfully. \"As a matter of fact, I'm in\ncharge now, and that's why I'm staying so late. To sort of catch up on\nthings. You know?\"\n\n\"It's very important,\" Malone said tensely. \"You don't know where any\nof them went? You don't have any address?\"\n\n\"None at all,\" she said. \"I'm sorry, but that's how it is. Maybe it's\nstrange, and maybe you'd ask questions, but I obey orders, and\nthose're my orders. To take over until they get back. They didn't tell\nme where they went, and I didn't ask.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Malone said. He wanted to shoot himself.\n\nLou was one of them. Of course she was; that was obvious now, when he\nthought about it. Lou was one of the secret group that was sabotaging\npractically everything.\n\nAnd now they'd all gone. For two weeks--or for good.\n\nThe girl's voice broke in on his thoughts.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Malone,\" she said, \"I'm sorry, but I just remembered. They\nleft a note for you.\"\n\n\"A note?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Sir Lewis said you might call,\" the girl said, \"and he left a\nmessage. If you'll hold on a minute I'll read it to you.\"\n\nMalone waited tensely. The girl found a slip of paper, blinked at it\nand read:\n\n\"My dear Malone, I'm afraid you are perfectly correct in your\ndeductions; and, as you can see, that leaves us no alternative. Sorry.\nMiss G. sends her apologies to you, as do I.\" The girl looked up.\n\"It's signed by Sir Lewis,\" she said. \"Does that mean anything to you,\nMr. Malone?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it does,\" Malone said bleakly. \"It means entirely too\nmuch.\"\n\n\n12\n\nAfter the great mass of teeth, vaguely surrounded by a face, had faded\nfrom Malone's screen, he just sat there, looking at the dead, grey\nscreen of the visiphone and feeling about twice as dead and at least\nthree times as grey.\n\nThings, he told himself, were terrible. But even that sentence, which\nwas a good deal more cheerful than what he actually felt, didn't do\nanything to improve his mood. All of the evidence, after all, had been\npractically living on the tip of his nose for nearly twenty-four\nhours, and not only had he done nothing about it, but he hadn't even\nseen it.\n\nTwo or three times, for instance, he'd doubted the possibility of\nteleporting another human being. All his logic had told him it wasn't\nso. But, he'd thought, he and Her Majesty had teleported Lou, and so,\nobviously, his logic was wrong.\n\nNo, it wasn't, he thought now. There _would_ be too much mental\nresistance, even if the person were unconscious. Teleportation of\nanother human being _would_ be impossible.\n\nUnless, of course, the other human being was able to teleport on her\nown.\n\nTrue, she had been no more than semiconscious. She probably couldn't\nhave teleported on her own. But Malone and Her Majesty had, ever so\nkindly and ever so mistakenly, helped her, and Lou had managed to\nteleport to the plane.\n\nAnd that wasn't all, he thought dismally. That was far from all.\n\n\"Let's take another for-instance,\" he said savagely, in what he\nthought was a caricature of the Manelli voice. In order for all three\nto teleport, there had to be perfect synchronization.\n\nOtherwise, they'd have arrived either at different places, or at the\nsame place but at different times.\n\nAnd perfect synchronization on a psionic level meant telepathy. At\nleast two of the three had to be telepathic. Her Majesty was, of\ncourse. Malone wasn't.\n\nSo Lou had to be telepathic, too.\n\nMalone told himself bitterly to quit calling the girl Lou. After the\nway she'd deceived him, she didn't deserve it. Her name was Luba\nGarbitsch, and from now on he was going to call her Luba Garbitsch. In\nhis own mind, anyway.\n\nFacts came tumbling in on him like the side of a mountain, falling on\na hapless traveler during a landslide. And, Malone told himself, he\nhad never had less help in all of his ill-starred life.\n\nHer Majesty had never, never suspected that Luba Garbitsch was\nanything other than the girl she pretended to be. That was negative\nevidence, true, and taken alone it meant nothing at all. But when you\nadded the other facts to it, it showed, with perfect plainness, that\nLuba Garbitsch was the fortunate possessor of a mind shield as tough,\nas strong and as perfect as any Malone, O'Connor or good old Cartier\nTaylor had ever even thought of dreaming up.\n\nAnd then, very suddenly, another fact arrived, and pushed the rest out\ninto the black night of Malone's bitter mind. He punched hard on the\nintercom button and got the desk of the agent-in-charge.\n\n\"Now what's wrong?\" the A-in-C said. \"Ghosts got loose? Or do you want\nsome help with a beautiful blonde heiress?\"\n\n\"What would I be doing,\" Malone snapped, \"with a beautiful blonde\nheiress?\"\n\nThe agent-in-charge looked thoughtful. It was obvious that he had been\nsaving his one joke up for several hours. \"You might be holding her,\"\nhe suggested, \"for ransom, of course.\"\n\n\"That's not funny,\" Malone said. \"Nothing is funny any more.\"\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" the A-in-C said. \"You Washington boys are just too\ngood for the rest of us. What's on your mind?\"\n\n\"You've got a twenty-four-hour watch on Luba Garbitsch, haven't you?\"\nMalone said.\n\n\"Sure we have,\" the A-in-C said. \"Boyd said--\"\n\n\"Yes, I know what he said,\" Malone cut in. \"Give me a check on those\nmen. I want to find out where she is right now. Right this minute.\"\n\nThe agent-in-charge shrugged. \"Sure,\" he said. \"It's none of my\nbusiness. Hang on a second.\"\n\nThe screen went blank, but it didn't go silent. Each of the agents, on\na stakeout job like the Garbitsch one, would be carrying personal\ncommunicators, and Malone could hear the voice of the agent-in-charge\nas he spoke to them.\n\nHe couldn't make out all the words, and it wasn't important anyhow.\nHe'd know soon enough, he kept telling himself; just as soon as the\nA-in-C came back and reported.\n\nIt seemed like about twelve years before he did.\n\n\"She's all right,\" he said. \"Nothing to worry about; she's probably\nworking late at her office, that's all. She hasn't gone home yet.\"\n\n\"Want to bet?\" Malone snapped.\n\n\"Don't tempt me,\" the A-in-C said. \"I wouldn't take your money--it's\nprobably counterfeit, printed in Washington.\"\n\n\"I'll give you ten to one,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Ten to one, I'll take,\" the A-in-C said rapidly. \"Ten to one is like\ntaking candy from a traffic cop. I'm no amateur, even if I am stuck\naway in dull little old New York--and I know the boys I've got on\nstakeout. I'll check, and--\"\n\n\"Let me know when you do,\" Malone said. \"I've got some long-distance\ncalls to make.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nForty-five minutes later, he had all the news he needed. Spot checks\non PRS offices on the West Coast, where it wasn't closing time yet,\nshowed that all the executive officers had suddenly felt the need of\nextended vacations to parts unknown.\n\nThat, if not exactly cheering news, was still welcome; Malone had more\nbacking for his theory.\n\nAn overseas call to New Scotland Yard in London took a little more\ntime, and several arguments with bored overseas operators who,\napparently, had nothing better to do than to confuse the customers.\nBut Malone finally managed to get Assistant Commissioner C. E. Teal,\nwho promised to check on Malone's inquiry at once.\n\nIt seemed like years before he called back, and Malone leaped to the\nphone.\n\n\"Yes?\" he said.\n\nTeal, red-faced and apparently masticating a stick of gum, said: \"I\ngot C. I. D. Commander Gideon to follow up on that matter, Mr. Malone.\nIt is rather late here, as you must realize--\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Malone said. \"And they've all gone?\"\n\n\"Why, no,\" Teal said, surprised. \"A spot check shows that most of the\nexecutives of the London branch of the Psychical Research Society are\nspending quiet evenings in their homes. Our Inspector Ottermole\nactually spoke to Dr. Carnacki, the head of the office here.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said.\n\n\"They haven't skipped,\" Teal went on. \"Is this in connection with\nanything serious, Mr. Malone?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" Malone said. \"But I'll let you know at once if there are\nany further developments. Thanks very much, Mr. Teal.\"\n\n\"A pleasure, Mr. Malone,\" Teal said. \"A pleasure.\" And then, still\nmasticating, he switched off.\n\nAnd that, Malone told himself, was definitely that. Of course the\nBritish PRS hadn't gone underground; why should they? The British\npolice weren't on to them, as Scotland Yard showed. And, no matter\nwhat opinions Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth I might hold in the matter,\nthe FBI had absolutely no jurisdiction in the British Isles.\n\nMalone buried his face in his hands, thought about a cigar and decided\nthat even a cigar might make him feel worse. Where were they? What\nwere they doing now? What did they plan to do?\n\nWhere had they gone?\n\n\"Out of the everywhere,\" he said in a hollow, sepulchral voice, \"into\nthe here.\"\n\nBut where was the here?\n\nHe tried to make up his mind whether or not that made sense.\nSuperficially, it sounded like plain bad English, but he wasn't sure\nof anything any more. Things were getting much too confused.\n\nThere was a knock at the door.\n\nMalone, without any hope at all, called: \"Come in,\" and the door\nopened.\n\nThe agent-in-charge came in, and dropped a dollar on Malone's desk.\n\n\"So you checked,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I checked,\" the A-in-C said sadly. \"The boys went through the entire\ndamned building. Not a sign of her. Not even a trace.\"\n\n\"There wouldn't be one,\" Malone said, shoving the dollar back to\nwaiting hands. \"Take the money; I knew what would happen. It was a\nsucker bet.\"\n\n\"Well, I feel like the sucker, all right,\" the A-in-C said. \"I don't\nknow how she did it.\"\n\n\"I do,\" Malone said quietly. \"Teleportation.\"\n\nThe A-in-C whistled. \"Well,\" he said, \"it was a great secret as long\nas it was FBI property. But now, friend, all hell is going to bust\nloose.\"\n\n\"It already has,\" Malone said hollowly.\n\n\"Great,\" the A-in-C said. \"What now?\"\n\n\"Now,\" Malone said, \"I am going to go back to Washington. Take care of\npoor little old New York for me.\"\n\nHe closed his eyes, and vanished.\n\nWhen he opened them, he was in his Washington apartment. He went over\nto the big couch and sat down, feeling that if he were going to curse\nhe might as well be comfortable while he did it. But when the air was\nbright blue, some minutes later, he didn't feel any better. Cursing\nwas not the answer.\n\nNothing seemed to be.\n\nWhat was his next move?\n\nWhere did he go from here?\n\nThe more he thought about it, the more his mind spun. He was, he\nrealized, at an absolute, total, dead end.\n\nOh, there were things he could do. Malone knew that very well. He\ncould make a lot of noise and go through a lot of waste motion--that\nwas what it would amount to. He could have all the homes of all the\nmissing PRS members checked. That would result, undoubtedly, in the\ndiscovery that the PRS members involved weren't in their homes. He\ncould have their files impounded, which would clutter everything with\na great many more pieces of paper, and none of the pieces of paper\nwould do any good to him. In general, he could have the entire FBI\nchasing all over hell and gone--and finding nothing whatever.\n\nNo, it would be a waste of time, he told himself. That much was\ncertain.\n\nAnd, though he probably had enough evidence to get the FBI in motion,\nhe had nowhere near enough to carry the case into court, much less\nmake a try at getting the case to stand up in court. That was one\nthing he couldn't do, even if he wanted to: issue warrants for arrest\non any basis whatever.\n\nBut Malone was an FBI agent, and his motto was: \"There's always a\nway.\" No normal method of tracking down the PRS members, and finding\ntheir present whereabouts, was going to work. They'd been covering\nthemselves for such an emergency, undoubtedly, for a good many years\nand, due to telepathy, they certainly knew enough not to leave any\nclues around, of any kind.\n\nBut nobody, Malone told himself, was perfect. There were clues lying\naround somewhere, he was sure of that; there had to be. The problem\nwas, simply, to figure out where to look, and what to look for.\n\nSomewhere, the clues were sitting quietly and waiting for him to find\nthem. The thought cheered him slightly, but not very much. Instead, he\nwent into the kitchen and started heating water for coffee. He thought\nthere might be a long night ahead of him, and sighed gently. But there\nwas no help for it. The work had to be done, and done quickly.\n\nBut when eight cigars had been reduced to ash, and what seemed like\nseveral gallons of coffee had sloshed their way into Malone's interior\nworkings, his mind was as blank as a baby's. The lovely, opalescent\ndawn began to show in the East, and Malone swore at it. Then, haggard,\nred-eyed, confused, violently angry, and not one inch closer to a\nsolution, he fell into a fitful doze on his couch.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen he awoke the sun was high in the sky, and outside his window the\ncheerful sound of traffic floated in the air. Downstairs somebody was\nplaying a television set too loudly, and the voice reached Malone's\nsemi-aware mind in a great tinny shout:\n\n\"And now, the makers of Bon-Ton B-Complex Bolsters--the blanket of\nhealth--present Mother Kohler's Chit-Chat Hour!\"\n\nThe invisible audience screamed and howled. Malone ripped out a\nparticularly foul oath and sat up on the couch. \"That,\" he muttered,\n\"is a fine thing to wake up to.\" He focused his eyes, with only\nslight difficulty, on his watch. The time was exactly noon.\n\n\"But first,\" the announcer burbled downstairs, \"a word from Mother\nKohler herself, about the brand new special B-Complex _Irradiated_\nBolster you can get at your neighborhood stores...\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" Malone said. He had wasted a lot of time doing nothing but\nsleeping, he told himself. This was no time to be listening to\ntelevision. He got up and found, to his vague surprise, that he felt a\nlot better and more clear-headed than he'd been feeling. Maybe the\nsleep had done him some good.\n\nHe yawned, blinked and stretched, and then he padded into the\nbathroom, showered and shaved and put on fresh clothes. He thought\nabout having a morning cup of coffee, but last night's dregs appeared\nto have taken up permanent residence in his digestive tract, and he\ndecided against it at last. He swallowed some orange juice and toast\nand then, heaving a great sigh of resignation and brushing crumbs off\nhis shirt, he teleported himself over to his office.\n\nHe was going to have to face Burris eventually, he knew.\n\nAnd now was just as good, or as bad, a time as any.\n\nMalone didn't hesitate. He punched the button on his intercom for\nBurris' office and then sat back, with his eyes closed, for the\nwell-known voice.\n\nIt didn't come.\n\nInstead, Wolf, the director's secretary, spoke up.\n\n\"Burris isn't in, Malone,\" he said. \"He had to fly to Miami. I can get\na call through to him on the plane, if it's urgent, but he'll be\nlanding in about fifteen minutes. And he did say he'd call this\nafternoon.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Sure. Okay. It isn't urgent.\" He was just as glad\nof the reprieve; it gave him one more chance to work matters through\nto a solution, and report success instead of failure. \"But what's\ngoing on in Miami?\" he added.\n\n\"Don't you read the papers?\" Wolf asked.\n\nEverybody, Malone reflected, seemed to be asking him that lately. \"I\nhaven't had time,\" he said.\n\n\"The governor of Mississippi was assassinated yesterday, at Miami\nBeach,\" Wolf said.\n\n\"Ah,\" Malone said. He thought about it for a second. \"Frankly,\" he\nsaid, \"this does not strike me as an irreparable loss to the nation.\nNot even to Mississippi.\"\n\n\"You express my views precisely,\" Wolf said.\n\n\"How about the killer?\" Malone said. \"I gather they haven't got him\nyet, or Burris wouldn't be on his way down.\"\n\n\"No,\" Wolf said. \"The killer would be on his way here instead. They\nhaven't got him, Malone. It seems Governor Flarion was walking along\nCollins Avenue when somebody fired at him, using a high-powered rifle\nwith, I guess, a scope sight.\"\n\n\"Professional,\" Malone commented.\n\n\"It looks like it,\" Wolf said. \"Nobody even heard the sniper's shot;\nthe governor just fell over, right there in the street. And by the\ntime his bodyguards found out what had happened, it was impossible\neven to be sure just which way he was facing when the shot had been\nfired.\"\n\n\"And, as I remember Collins Avenue--\" Malone started.\n\n\"Right,\" Wolf said. \"Out where Governor Flarion was taking his stroll,\nthere's an awful lot of it to search. The boys are trying to find\nsomebody who might have seen a man acting suspicious in any of the\nnearby buildings, or heard a shot, or seen anybody at all lurking or\nloitering anywhere remotely close to the scene.\"\n\n\"Lovely,\" Malone said. \"Sounds like a nice complicated job.\"\n\n\"You don't know the half of it,\" Wolf said. \"There's also the Miami\nBeach Chamber of Commerce. According to them, Flarion died of a heart\nattack, and not even in Miami Beach. The bullet and the body are\nsupposed to be written off as just coincidences, to keep the fair name\nof Miami Beach unsullied.\"\n\n\"All I can say,\" Malone offered, \"is good luck. This is the saddest\nday in American history since the assassination of Huey P. Long.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Wolf said. \"Want me to tell Burris you called?\"\n\n\"Right,\" Malone said. He flicked off.\n\nNow, he asked himself, how did the assassination of Governor Nemours\nP. Flarion fit in with anything? Granted, good old Nemours P. had been\na horrible mistake, a paranoid, self-centered, would-be dictator whose\ntalents as a rabble-rouser and a fearmonger had somehow managed to get\nhim elected to a governorship. Certainly nobody felt particularly\nunhappy about his death. But he wouldn't fit into the pattern. Malone\nreminded himself that that was one more thing he had to find out when\nhe got the chance.\n\nThe trouble lay in finding an opportunity, he thought--and then he\ncorrected himself.\n\nNot _finding_ it--_making_ it. Nobody was going to hand him anything\non a silver serving salver.\n\nHe punched the intercom again and got the Records office.\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" a familiar voice said.\n\n\"Potter?\" Malone said. \"This is Malone. I want facsimiles of\neverything we have on the Psychical Research Society, on Sir Lewis\nCarter, and on Luba Vasilovna Garbitsch. Both of those last are\nconnected with the Society.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Potter said. \"They'll be up at once.\"\n\nThen he punched again, and asked for the latest copy of the Washington\n_Post_. He gave the article on Governor Flarion one quick glance, but\nit didn't contain anything in the way of facts that he hadn't already\nhad from Wolf. After that, he left it and concentrated on the more\nprosaic, human-interest news, the smaller stories.\n\n     FIFTH SPLINTER GROUP FORMS IN DCA BATTLE\n\nThat was an interesting one, he thought. The Daughters of Colonial\nAmericans had about reached the point of diminishing returns in their\nbattle over the claims of Rose Carswell Elder, a descendant of a Negro\nfreedman named William Elder who had lived in Boston in 1776 and\nfought on the side of the Colonies during the Revolution. One more\nsplinter group, Malone thought, and there'd be as many splinters as\nmembers. Rose Carswell Elder was pressing her claim for membership,\nand the ladies were replying by throwing crockery and hard words at\neach other.\n\nThen there was the Legion of American War Veterans. The headline on\nthis one read:\n\n     LAWV OUSTS 'ROWDIES': AID MEETING CONTINUES\n\nThe \"rowdies,\" Malone discovered, were a large minority group that\nwanted the good old days of electric canes, paper hats, whistles and\npretty girls. \"The Legion has grown up,\" a spokesman told them. \"This\nconvention is being held to discuss the possibility of increased\ntechnological aid to India and Africa. There is no place for\ntomfoolery or high jinks.\"\n\nThe expulsion order had been carried by a record majority.\n\nAnd then there were two items, on different pages, that seemed to\ncontradict each other. The first was a small headline on page\nfourteen:\n\n     RESIGNATIONS REACH NEW HIGH IN U.S. COLLEGE FACULTIES\n\nTeachers were apparently resigning all over the place, in virtually\nevery department of virtually every college. That made sense. And the\nother item, on page three, made just as much sense:\n\n     HIGHER TAXES VOTED THROUGHOUT U.S.\n     FOR TEACHER INCOME RISE\n     State and Federal Aid Also Promised\n     in Drive to Raise Salaries Now\n\nApparently, teachers were resigning just as they were about to get\nmore money than they'd ever seen before. But Malone could fit that\ninto the pattern easily enough; it was perfectly obvious, once he\nthought about it.\n\nMalone didn't have time to go through much more of the paper; the\nfacsimile records he'd been waiting for arrived, and he put the _Post_\naside and concentrated on them instead. Maybe somewhere in the records\nwas the clue he desperately needed.\n\nThe PRS was widely spread, all right. It had branches in almost every\nmajor city in the United States, in Europe, South Africa, South\nAmerica and Australia. There was even a small branch society in\nGreenland. True, the Communist disapproval of such non-materialistic,\nun-Marxian objectives as Psychical Research showed up in the fact that\nthere were no registered branches in the Sino-Soviet bloc. But that,\nMalone thought, didn't really matter. Maybe in Russia they called\nthemselves the Lenin Study Group, or the Better Borshcht League. He\nwas fairly sure, from what he'd experienced, that the PRS had some\nkind of organization even behind the Iron Curtain.\n\nMoney didn't seem to be much of a problem, either. Malone checked for\nthe supporters of the organization and found a microfilmed list that\nran into the hundreds of thousands of names, most of them ordinary\npeople who seemed to be interested in spiritualism and the like, and\nwho donated a few dollars apiece each year to the PRS. Besides this\nmass of small donations, of course, there were a few large ones, from\nindependently wealthy men who gave support to the organization and\nseemed actively interested in its aims.\n\nIt wasn't an unusual picture; it was just an exceptionally big one.\n\nMalone sighed and went on to the personal dossiers.\n\nSir Lewis Carter himself was a well-known astronomer and\nmathematician. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society, the Royal\nAstronomical Society and the Royal Mathematical Society. He had been\nknighted for his contributions in higher mathematics only two years\nbefore he had come to live in the United States. Malone went over the\npapers dealing with his entry into the country carefully, but they\nwere all in order and they contained absolutely no clues he could use.\n\nSir Lewis' books on political and historical philosophy had been\nwell-received, and he had also written a novel, _But Some Are More\nEqual,_ which, for a few weeks after publication, had managed to reach\nthe bottom of the best-seller list.\n\nAnd that was that. Malone tried to figure out whether all this\ninformation did him any good at all, and he didn't have to think for\nvery long. The answer was no. He opened the next dossier.\n\nLuba Vasilovna Garbitsch had been born in New York. Her mother had\nbeen a woman of Irish descent named Mary O'Keefe, and had died in '68.\nHer father, of course, had now been revealed as a Russian agent, and\nwas at present making his home, such as it probably was, in good old\nMoscow.\n\nMalone sighed. Somewhere in the dossiers, he was sure, there was a\nclue, the basic clue that would tell him everything he needed to know.\nHis prescience had never been so strong; he knew perfectly well that\nhe was staring at the biggest, most startling and most complete\ndisclosure of all. And he couldn't see it.\n\nHe stared at the folders for a long minute. What did they tell him?\nWhat was the clue?\n\nAnd then, very slowly, the soft light of a prodigal sun illuminated\nhis mind.\n\n\"Mr. Malone,\" Malone said gently, \"you are a damned fool. There are\ntimes when it is necessary to discard the impossible after you have\nseen that the obscure is the obvious.\"\n\nHe wasn't sure whether that meant anything, or even whether he knew\nwhat he was saying. He was sure of only one thing: the final answer.\n\nAnd it _was_ obvious. Obvious as all hell.\n\n\n13\n\nThere was, of course, only one thing to do, and only one place to go.\nMalone went downstairs without even stopping to wave farewell to the\nagent-in-charge, and climbed into the big, specially-built FBI Lincoln\nthat waited for him.\n\n\"Want a driver?\" one of the mechanics asked.\n\n\"No, thanks,\" Malone said. \"This one's a solo job.\"\n\nThat was for sure. He drove out onto the streets and into the heavy\nlate afternoon traffic of Washington, D. C. The Lincoln handled\nsmoothly, but Malone didn't press his luck among the rushing cars. He\nwasn't in any hurry. He had all the time in the world, and he knew it.\nThey--and, for once, Malone knew just who \"they\" were--would still be\nwaiting for him when he got there.\n\n_If_ he got there, he thought suddenly, dodging a combination\nroadblock consisting of a green Plymouth making an illegal turn, a\nfourteen-year-old boy on a bicycle and a sweet young girl pushing a\nbaby carriage. He managed to get past and wiped his forehead with one\nhand. He continued driving, even more carefully, until he was out of\nthe city.\n\nIt took quite a lot of time. Washington traffic was getting worse and\nworse with every passing month, and the pedestrians were as nonchalant\nas ever. As Malone turned a corner, a familiar face popped into view,\npractically in front of his car. He swerved and got by without\ncommitting homicide, and a cheerful voice said: \"Thanks, sorry.\"\n\n\"It's okay, Chester,\" Malone said. The big man skipped back to the\nsidewalk and watched the car go by. Malone knew him slightly, a\nprivate eye who did some work on the fringes of Washington crime;\nbasically a nice guy, but a little too active for Malone's taste.\n\nFor a second he thought of asking the man to accompany him, but the\nlast thing Malone needed was muscle. What he wanted was brains, and he\neven thought he might be developing some of those.\n\nHe was nearly sure of it by the time he finally did leave the city and\nget out onto the highway that went south into the depths of Virginia.\nAnd, while he drove, he began to use that brain, letting his reflexes\ntake over most of the driving problems now that the Washington traffic\ntangle was behind him.\n\nHe took all his thoughts from behind the shield that had sheltered\nthem and arrayed them neatly before him. Everything was perfectly\nclear; all he had to do now was explain it.\n\nMalone had wondered, over the years, about the detectives in books.\nThey always managed to wrap everything up in the last chapter--and\nthat was all right. But they always had a whole crowd of suspects\nlistening to them, too. And Malone knew perfectly well that he could\nnever manage a set-up like that. People would be interrupting him.\nThings would happen. Dogs would rush in and start a fight on the\nfloor. There would be earthquakes, or else somebody would suddenly\nfaint and interrupt him.\n\nBut now, at long last, he realized, he had his chance.\n\nNobody, he thought happily, could interrupt him. And he could explain\nto his heart's content.\n\nBecause the members of the PRS were telepathic. And Malone, he thought\ncheerfully, was not.\n\nSomebody, he was sure, would be tuned in on him as he drove toward\ntheir Virginia hiding place. And he hoped that that somebody would\nalert everybody else, so they could all tune in and hear his grand\nfinal explanation of everything.\n\n_And a hearty good afternoon to everybody,_ he thought. _A very hearty\nand happy and sunny good afternoon to all--and most especially to Miss\nLuba Garbitsch. I hope she's the one who's tuned in--or that somebody\nhas alerted her by now, because I'd rather talk to her than to anyone\nelse I can think of out there._\n\n_Nothing personal, you understand. It's just that I'd like to show off\na little. I don't need to hide anything from you--as a matter of\nplain, simple fact, I can't. Not with my shield down._\n\nHe paused then, and, in his imagination, he could almost hear Lou's\nvoice.\n\n\"I'm listening, Kenneth,\" the voice said. \"Go on.\"\n\n_Well, then,_ he thought. He fished around in his mind for a second,\nwondering exactly where to start. Then he decided, in the best\ntraditions of the detective story, not to mention _Alice in\nWonderland,_ to start at the beginning.\n\n_The dear old Psychical Research Society,_ he thought, _had been going\nalong for a good many years now--since the 1880's, as a matter of\nfact, or somewhere near there. That's a long time and a lot of\nresearch. A lot of famous and intelligent men and women have belonged\nto the Society. And in all that time, they've worked hard, and worked\nsincerely, in testing every kind of psychic phenomenon. They've worked\nimpartially and scientifically to find out whether a given unusual\nincident was explicable in terms of known natural laws, or was the\nresult of some unknown force._\n\n_And it's hardly surprising that, after about a hundred years of work,\nsomething finally came of it._\n\n\"Not surprising at all,\" he imagined Lou's voice saying. \"You're\nmaking things very clear, Kenneth.\"\n\nOr had that been \"Sir Kenneth\"? Malone wasn't sure, but it didn't\nreally matter. He spun the car around a curve in the highway, smiled\ngently to himself, and went on.\n\n_Naturally, to the average man in the street, the Society was just a\nbunch of crackpots, and the more respected and famous the people who\nbelonged to it, the happier he was; it just proved his superiority to\nthem. He didn't deal with crackpot notions, did he?_\n\n_No, the Society did. And nobody except the members paid much\nattention to what was going on._\n\n_I remember one of the book facsimiles you gave me, for instance. Some\nman, whose name I can't recall, wrote a great \"expos\u00e9\" of the Society,\nin which he tried to prove that Sir Lewis Carter and certain other\nmembers were trying to take over the world and run it to suit\nthemselves, making a sort of horrible dictatorship out of their power\nand position. At that, he wasn't really far from the truth, though he\nhad it turned around a little. But the book shows that he has no\nknowledge whatever of what psionics is, or how it works. He seems to\nme to be just a little afraid of it, which probably adds to his\nignorance. And, as a result, he got a twisted idea of what the PRS is\nactually doing._\n\nHe could almost hear Lou's voice again. \"Yes,\" she was saying. \"I\nremember the book. It was put in our reference library for its\nhumorous aspects.\"\n\n_That's right,_ Malone thought. _It would be only funny to you. But it\nwould be frightening and terrible to an awful lot of people simply\nbecause they wouldn't understand what the Society was all about._\n\n\"All right,\" Lou's voice said helpfully. \"And what _is_ it all about?\"\n\nMalone settled back in the driver's seat as the car continued to spin\nalong the road. _It seems to me,_ he thought carefully, _that any\ntelepath has to go one of two ways. Either, like Her Majesty or the\nothers we found when we discovered her two years ago, the telepath\nends up insane--or perhaps commits suicide, which is simply one step\nfurther in retreat--or else he learns to understand and control his\nown powers, and to understand other human beings so well that, if he\nactually did control the world, everyone would benefit in the long\nrun._\n\n_The difference between the two kinds is the difference between Her\nMajesty and the PRS._\n\n\"That's good thinking,\" he could hear Lou say.\n\n_No, it isn't,_ he thought; _it's no more than guessing, and it could\nbe just as wild as you please. But there is one thing I do know: the\nway to get a better world, or anyhow the first step, is to clear the\nroad ahead. And that means getting rid of the fools, idiots, maniacs,\nblockheads, morons, psychopaths, paranoids, timidity-ridden,\nfear-worshipers, fanatics, thieves, criminals and a whole lot more._\n\n\"Get rid of them?\" Lou's voice said.\n\n_Well,_ Malone thought, _I don't mean they've got to be killed or\ndriven out of the civilized world. You've just got to get them out of\nany place where their influence is heavily felt on society as a\nwhole._\n\n\"All right,\" Lou's voice said pleasantly. \"And how could we go about\nthat? Do we write nasty letters to the editor?\"\n\n_There's a much more effective way,_ Malone thought. _There's no\ntrouble in getting rid of a man if you can make him expose himself.\nAnd you've managed that pretty well. You've thwarted their idiotic\nplans, made them stumble over their own fumble-mindedness, played on\ntheir neuroses, concocted errors for them to fight and, in general,\nrigged things in any possible way so that they'd quit, or get fired,\nor lose elections, or get arrested, or just generally get put out of\ncirculation somehow._\n\n_It's extremely effective--and it works very well._\n\n_Sometimes, you've only had to put the blocks to individuals.\nSometimes whole nations have had to go. And sometimes it's been\nin-between, and you've managed to foul up whole organizations with\nmisplaced papers missent messages, error, and changed minds and\neverything else you can think of._\n\n_As a matter of fact, it sounds like fun._\n\n\"Well,\" he imagined Lou saying, \"it is fun, in away. But it's a deadly\nserious business, too.\"\n\n_Sure it is,_ Malone thought. _I think the first time that came home\nto me was when I saw what was happening in Russia, and compared it to\nwhat had been going on over here. Tom Boyd saw that, too, when I\npointed it out to him--as you probably know if you were spying on my\nmind at the time._\n\n_Not that I mind that in the least._\n\n_Come more often, by all means._\n\n_But Tom, in case you weren't listening, said: \"Over here there are a\nlot of confused jerks and idiots... And in Russia there's a lot of\nconfusion.\"_\n\n_Now, that's perfectly true, and it spells out the difference. Over\nhere, you've been confusing the jerks and the idiots, getting rid of\nthem so the system can work properly. Over in Russia, on the other\nhand, you've left the jerks and the idiots all alone to do their dirty\nwork, and you've just added to the confusion where necessary, so that\nthe system will break down of its own weight._\n\n\"But, after all,\" Lou said, \"things look pretty bad over here, too.\nLook at the papers.\"\n\n_Everybody,_ Malone thought, _has been telling me to go and look at\nthe newspapers. And when I do look at them I find all sorts of\nevidence of confusion. Teachers resigning, senators and\nrepresentatives goofing up bills on Congress, gang wars cluttering up\nthe streets with cadavers and making things tough for the Sanitation\nDepartment, factional fights in various organizations. Now, all of\nthat looks pretty horrible in the papers, but do you know something?\nIt isn't horrible at all._\n\n_It's pretty damn good, as a matter of fact._\n\n_The teachers who are resigning, for instance, are the nincompoops\nwho've got to be pruned out so that competent teachers can come in.\nAnd, with the higher salaries, more and more competent men and women\nare going to be attracted to the job. The universities are going to be\nfreer and better places to work in; they won't be monopolies any\nmore._\n\n\"Monopolies?\" Lou said.\n\n_In restraint of knowledge,_ Malone thought. _The old monopoly was in\nrestraint of trade, and legal action helped to kill that kind. The\nmonopoly in restraint of knowledge took a little more killing, but\nyou're doing the job quite nicely. And not only in the schools._\n\n_The factional fights are having the same result. Look at the AAAM,\nfor instance. That organization is a monopoly, pure and simple.\nSimple, anyhow. And what the factional fights are doing to it is just\nbreaking up the monopoly and letting knowledge free again._\n\n_And then we come to Congress. Senators and representatives are having\na terrible time, some of them. There's a fight going on between\nFurbisher and Deeks because Deeks has discovered some evidence against\nFurbisher. Who's having the terrible time?_\n\n_All of them?_\n\n_Nope. Furbisher is. Deeks isn't._\n\n_And that's the way it's going all over. The useful, necessary\nlegislation is going through Congress now without being cluttered up\nby stupid dam bills and water bills and other idiocies that simply\nclog the works._\n\n_And then, of course, there are the gang wars. Now, I feel as sorry\nfor the Sanitation Department as anybody, but at least they're\ncleaning the streets for good now. The boys who are dying off and\ngetting sent to hospitals and jails are just the ones who should have\nbeen sent away long ago. Everybody knows that, but nobody can prove\nit._\n\n_Except the PRS._\n\n_And the PRS is busy doing just what it can about that proof._\n\n_And all it takes is a few of you. I don't know how many--I don't know\nhow many of you there really are, for that matter. But it must be a\nfair number to stock all your branches with \"top-level\" executives and\nthe lower-level men and women who really believe in the PRS blind, and\ndo their best to keep it working._\n\n_There are probably a lot of ways it might work, but the simplest and\nbest way I can think of is this one: there's a clearing-house sort of\nset-up, and information comes in from various telepathic spies working\nfor the PRS, about various projected activities of the imbecile\ncontingent._\n\n_And, from this information, you figure out the best time and place\nfor lightning to strike, and you select the kind of lightning it's\ngoing to be. Here it's a misplaced letter, there some \"facts\" that\naren't facts, and somewhere else a dropped package of secret records.\nSomebody goofs--and is exposed._\n\n_Maybe it works on the local-organization level. Maybe there are teams\nall over the country, all ready to synchronize their minds and jab\nsomebody in the thought processes at just the right time, in just the\nright way, as soon as they get the word. That's one way of doing it,\nmaybe the best way._\n\n_There are others, but it doesn't really matter how that end of it\nworks. The important thing is that it does work._\n\n_And, when it works, it can certainly create quite a mess. Yes-sirree,\nBob. Or Lou, as the case may be._\n\n_I sure hope somebody's picking all this up, because I'd hate to have\nto explain it again when I get there._\n\n_Are you there, anybody?_\n\nMalone imagined he heard Lou's voice. \"Yes, Ken,\" she said. \"Yes, I'm\nhere.\"\n\nBut, of course, there was no way for them to get through to him. They\nwere telepathic, but Kenneth J. Malone wasn't he told himself sadly.\n\n_Hello, out there,_ he thought. _I hope you've been listening so far,\nbecause there isn't going to be too much more. But there are a couple\nof things that still need to be cleared up. I've got some answers, but\nthere are others I'm going to need._\n\n_There's Russia, for instance. It does seem to me as if your teams in\nRussia, whatever they're calling themselves, are having a lot more fun\nthan the U. S. teams. For one thing they've got an easier job._\n\n_In this country, the teams are looking for ways to get rid of the\nblockheads, and there are a lot of them. In Russia, you don't have to\nget rid of the blockheads. All you have to do is clear the road for\nthem. And you can do that by fouling up the more intelligent people._\n\n\"Intelligent people?\" he could hear Lou say.\n\n_Intelligence doesn't mean good sense,_ Malone thought. _I don't doubt\nthat the men who are maintaining Russia's power are intelligent men--\nbut what they're doing is bad for the world as a whole, in the long\nrun._\n\n_So you foul them up, and leave the blockheads a clear field to run\nthe country into the ground. And that's easier than fouling up the\nblockheads._\n\n_Sure it is._\n\n_There are fewer intelligent, active people around than there are\nblockheads._\n\n_Always were._\n\n_And maybe there always will be--but not if the PRS can help it._\n\n_Oh, and by the way,_ Malone thought. _You do know how I spotted you,\ndon't you? You were tuned in then, weren't you?_\n\n_And I don't mean just Lou. I mean all of you._\n\n_In a world of blind men, the man who can see stands out. In a world\nof the insane, the sane man stands out._\n\n_And in a world where organizations are regularly being confused and\nfouled up--either as whole organizations, or through your attempts to\nget rid of individual members--a smooth-running, efficient\norganization stands out like a sore thumb._\n\n_Frankly, it took me longer to see it than it should have._\n\n_But I've got the answer at last--the main answer. Though, as I say,\nthere are some others I'd like to have._\n\n_Like, for instance, Russia. And exactly what did happen that night in\nMoscow._\n\n\n14\n\nAt this point Malone suddenly became aware of a sound that was not\ncoming from his own mind. It was coming from somewhere behind his car,\nand it was a very loud sound. It was, he discovered when he looked\nback, the siren of a highway patrolman on a motorcycle, coming toward\nhim at imminent risk of life and limb and waving frantically with an\nunbelievably free hand.\n\nMalone glanced down at the speedometer. With a sigh, he realized that\nhis reflexes had allowed him a little leeway, and that he was going\nslightly over the legal speed limit for this Virginia highway. He\nshook his head, eased up on the accelerator, and began to apply the\nbrakes.\n\nBy the time he had pulled over to the side of the road, the highway\npatrolman was coming to a halt behind the big Lincoln. Malone watched\nhim check the number on the rear plate and then walk slowly around to\nthe window on the driver's side. \"Can't you hurry?\" Malone muttered\nunder his breath. \"All this Virginian ease is okay in its place,\nbut--\" In the meanwhile he was getting out his identification, and by\nthe time the patrolman reached him he had it in his hand.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said.\n\n\"Sorry?\" the patrolman said, frowning. He had an open, boyish face\nwith freckles and a pug nose. He looked like somebody's kid brother,\nvery dependable but just a little cute. \"What for?\" he said.\n\nMalone shrugged. \"What else?\" he said. \"Speeding.\"\n\n\"Oh, that,\" the patrolman said. \"Why, don't you worry about that.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it?\" Malone said. This particular kid brother was\nobviously a little nuts, and should have been put away years ago. He\nground his teeth silently, but he didn't make any complaints. It was\nnever wise, he knew, to irritate a traffic cop of any sort.\n\n\"Sure not,\" the patrolman said. \"Why, we don't pay any attention out\nhere until a fella hits ten miles over the posted limit. That's okay.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said cheerily. \"Then I can drive on?\"\n\n\"Now, just hold it a second there,\" the patrolman said. \"Let's see\nyour identification if you don't mind.\"\n\nMalone held it out wordlessly. The patrolman, obviously intent on\nfinding out just what kind of paper the card was made of, who had\nprinted it and whether there were any germs on it, gave it a long,\ncareful scrutiny. Malone shifted slightly in his seat, counted to ten\nand managed to say nothing.\n\nThen the patrolman started reading the card aloud. \"Kenneth J.\nMalone,\" he said in a tone of some surprise. \"Special Agent of the\nFBI.\" He looked up. \"That right?\" he said. \"What it says here?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Malone said. \"And you can have my autograph later.\" He\nregretted the last sentence as soon as it was out of his mouth, but\nthe patrolman didn't seem to notice.\n\n\"Then you're the man, all right,\" he said happily. \"I caught your\nplate number as you went on by me, back there.\"\n\n\"Plate number?\" Malone said. \"What am I supposed to have done?\" He'd\noverslept, he knew, but that was the only violation of even his\npersonal code that he could think of. And it didn't seem likely that\nthe Virginia Highway Patrol was sending out its men to arrest people\nwho overslept.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Malone,\" the patrolman said with honest surprise written all\nover his Norman Rockwell face, \"as far as I know you didn't do a thing\nwrong.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"They just told us to be on the watch for a black 1973 Lincoln with\nyour number, and see if you were driving it. They did say you'd\nprobably be driving it.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said. \"And I am. And I'd like to continue doing so.\" He\npaused and then added, \"But what happened?\"\n\n\"Well,\" the patrolman said, in exactly the manner of a man starting\nout to tell a long, interesting story about the Wars of the Spanish\nSuccession, \"well, sir, it seems FBI Headquarters in Washington, they\ngot in touch with the Highway Patrol Headquarters, down in Richmond,\nand Highway Patrol Headquarters--\"\n\n\"Down in Richmond,\" Malone muttered resignedly.\n\n\"That's right,\" the patrolman said in a pleased voice. \"Well, they\ncalled all the local barracks, and then we got the message on our\nradios.\" He stopped, exactly as if he thought he had finished.\n\nMalone counted to ten again, made it twenty and then found that he was\ncapable of speech. \"What?\" he said in a calm, patient voice, \"was the\nmessage about?\"\n\n\"Well,\" the patrolman said, \"it seems some fella down in Washington,\nfella name of Thomas Boyd, they said it was, wants to talk to you\npretty bad.\"\n\n\"He could have called me on the car phone,\" Malone said in what he\nthought was a reasonable tone of voice. \"He didn't have to--\"\n\n\"There's no call for yelling at me, Mr. Malone,\" the patrolman said\nreproachfully. \"I only obeyed my orders, which were to locate your\nblack 1973 Lincoln and see if you were driving it, and give you a\nmessage. That's all.\"\n\n\"It's enough,\" Malone muttered. \"He didn't have to send out the\nmilitia to round me up.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Mr. Malone,\" the patrolman said. \"Not the militia. Highway\nPatrol. We don't rightly have any connection with the militia at all.\"\n\n\"Glad to hear it,\" Malone said. He picked up the receiver of the car\nphone and waited for the buzz that would show that he was connected\nwith Communications Central in Washington.\n\nIt didn't come.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" the patrolman said suddenly. \"I suppose that's why this Mr.\nBoyd, he couldn't call you on the car telephone, Mr. Malone. The\nmessage we got, it also says that the fella at the FBI garage in\nWashington just forgot to plug in that phone there.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Well, thanks for telling me.\"\n\n\"You're right welcome, Mr. Malone,\" the patrolman said \"You can plug\nit in now.\"\n\n\"I intend to,\" Malone said through his teeth. He closed his eyes for a\nlong second, and then opened them again. He saw the interested face of\nthe patrolman looking down at him. Hurriedly, he turned away, felt\nunderneath the dashboard until he found the dangling plug, and\ninserted it into its socket.\n\nThe buzz now arrived.\n\nMalone heaved a great sigh and punched for Boyd's office. Then he\nlooked around.\n\nThe patrolman was still standing at the car window. He was looking\ndown at Malone with an interested, slightly blank expression.\n\nMalone thought of several things to say, and chose the most harmless.\n\"Thanks a lot,\" he told the patrolman. \"I appreciate your stopping off\nto let me know.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right, Mr. Malone,\" the patrolman said. \"That was my\norders, to do that. And even if they weren't, it was no trouble at\nall. Any time. I'd always be glad to do anything for the FBI.\"\n\n\"Boyd here,\" a tinny voice from the phone said.\n\nMalone eyed the patrolman sourly. \"Malone here,\" he said. \"What's the\ntrouble, Tom? I--No, wait a minute.\"\n\n\"Ken!\" Boyd's voice said. \"I've been trying to--\"\n\n\"Hold it a second,\" Malone said. He opened his mouth, and then he saw\na car go by. The patrolman hadn't seen it. Malone felt sorry for the\ndriver, but not too sorry. \"Say!\" he said to the patrolman.\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" the patrolman said.\n\n\"That boy was really going, wasn't he?\" Malone said. \"He must have\nbeen doing at least ninety.\"\n\nThe patrolman jerked his head around to stare at the disappearing car.\n\"Well--\" he said, and then: \"Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Malone. Thanks.\nI'll see you later.\" He raced for his machine, swung aboard and roared\ndown the road, guiding with one hand and manipulating the controls of\nhis radar set with the other.\n\nMalone waved him a cheery farewell, and got back to the phone.\n\n\"Okay, Tom,\" he said. \"Go ahead.\"\n\n\"Who was that you were talking to?\" Boyd asked.\n\n\"Oh, just a motorcycle patrolman,\" Malone said. \"He wanted to be\nhelpful, so I told him to go chase a Buick.\"\n\n\"Why a Buick?\" Boyd said, interestedly.\n\n\"Why not?\" Malone said. \"There happened to be one handy at the time.\nNow, what's on your mind?\"\n\n\"I've been searching all over hell for you,\" Boyd said. \"I wish you'd\njust leave some word where you were going, and then I wouldn't have\nto--\"\n\n\"Damn it,\" Malone cut in. \"Tom, just tell me what you want. In\nstraightforward, simple language. It just took me ten minutes to pry a\nfew idiotic facts out of a highway patrolman. Don't make me go through\nit all over again with you.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay,\" Boyd said. \"Keep your pants on. But here's the dope: I\njust flew in from New York, and I brought all the files on the case--\nthe stuff you left in your office in New York, remember?\"\n\n\"Right,\" Malone said. \"Thanks.\"\n\n\"And I think we may be able to get the Big Cheese,\" Boyd went on.\n\n\"Manelli?\" Malone said.\n\n\"None other than the famous Cesare Antonio,\" Boyd said. \"It seems two\nof his most valued lieutenants were found in a garage in Queens,\npractically weighted down with machine-gun bullets.\"\n\nMalone thought of Manelli, complaining sadly about the high overhead\nof murder. \"And where does that get us?\" he said.\n\n\"Well,\" Boyd said, \"whoever did the job forgot to search the bodies.\"\n\n\"Oh-oh,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Very much oh-oh,\" Boyd said. \"They're loaded down, not only with\nlead, but with paper. There are documents linking Manelli right up to\nthe International Truckers' Union--a direct tie-in with Mike Sand. And\nSand now says he's tied in with the Great Lakes Transport Union in\nChicago.\"\n\n\"This sounds like a big one,\" Malone said.\n\n\"You have no idea,\" Boyd said. \"And in the middle of all this, Burris\ncalled.\"\n\n\"Burris?\" Malone said.\n\n\"That's right,\" Boyd said. \"He wants me to go on down to Florida and\ntake over the investigation of the Flarion assassination. So it looks\nas if I'm going to miss most of the fun.\"\n\n\"Too bad,\" Malone said.\n\n\"But maybe not all,\" Boyd said. \"It may tie in with the case we're\nworking on. At least, that's what Burris thinks.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Malone said. \"I can see why he thinks so. Did he have any\nmessage for me, by the way?\"\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Boyd said.\n\nMalone blinked. \"Not exactly?\" he said. \"What's that supposed to\nmean?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Boyd said, \"he says he does have something to tell you, but\nit'll wait until he sees you. Then, he says, he'll tell you\npersonally.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Maybe it's a surprise,\" Boyd said. \"Maybe you're fired.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't have the luck,\" Malone said. \"But if I get any leads on\nthe Flarion job, I'll let you know right away.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Boyd said. \"Thanks. And--by the way, what are you doing now?\"\n\n\"Me?\" Malone said. \"I'm driving.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" Boyd said patiently. \"To where, and why? Or is this\nanother secret? Sometimes I think nobody loves me any more.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be silly,\" Malone said. \"The entire city of Miami Beach is\nawaiting your arrival with bated breath.\"\n\n\"But what are you doing?\" Boyd said.\n\nMalone chose his words carefully. \"I'm just checking a lead,\" he said\nat last. \"I don't know if it's going to pan out or not, but I thought\nI'd drive down to Richmond and check on a name I've got. I'll call you\nabout it in the morning, Tom, and let you know what the result is.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Boyd said. \"Okay. Sure. So long, Ken.\"\n\n\"So long,\" Malone said. He hung up the phone, put the car into gear\nagain and roared off down U. S. Highway Number One. He didn't feel\nentirely happy about the way things had gone; he'd been forced to lie\nto Tom Boyd, and that just wasn't right.\n\nHowever, there was no help for it. It was actually better this way, he\ntold himself hopefully. After all, the less Tom knew from now on, the\nbetter off he was going to be. The better off everyone would be.\n\nHe went on through Fredericksburg without incident, but he didn't\ncontinue on to Richmond. Instead, he turned off U. S. 1 when he\nreached a little town called Thornburg, which was smaller than he had\nbelieved a town could be and live. He began following a secondary road\nout into the countryside.\n\nThe countryside, of course, was filled with country, in the shape of\nhills, birds, trees, flowers, grass and other distractions to the\npassing motorist. It took Malone quite a bit longer than he expected\nto find the place he was looking for, and he finally came to the sad\nconclusion that country estates are just as difficult to find as\nhouses in Brooklyn. In both cases, he thought, there was the same\nfrantic search down what seemed to be a likely route, the same\ndisappointment when the route turned out to lead nowhere, and the same\ndiscovery that no one had ever heard of the place and, in fact,\ndoubted very strongly whether it even existed.\n\nBut he found it at last, rounding a curve in a narrow black-top road\nand spotting the house beyond a grove of trees. He recognized it\ninstantly.\n\nHe had seen it so often that he felt as if he knew it intimately.\n\nIt was a big, rambling, Colonial-type mansion, painted a blinding and\nbeautiful white, with a broad, pillared porch and a great carved front\ndoor. The front windows were curtained in rich purples, and before the\nhouse was a great front garden, and tall old trees. Malone\nhalf-expected Scarlett O'Hara to come tripping out of the house at any\nmoment.\n\nInside it, however, if Malone were right, was not the magnetic\nScarlett. Inside the house were some of the most important members of\nthe Psychical Research Society.\n\nBut it was impossible to tell from the outside. Nothing moved on the\nwell-kept grounds, and the windows didn't show so much as the flutter\nof a purple curtain. There was no sound. No cars were parked around\nthe house, nor, Malone thought as he remembered _Gone With the Wind,_\nwere there any horses or carriages.\n\nThe place looked deserted.\n\nMalone thought he knew better, but it took a few minutes for him to\nget up enough courage to go up the long driveway. He stared at the\nhouse. It was an old one, he knew, built long before the Civil War and\noriginally commanding a huge plantation. Now, all that remained of\nthat vast parcel of land was the few acres that surrounded the house.\n\nBut the original family still inhabited it, proud of the house and of\ntheir part in its past. Over the years, Malone knew, they had kept it\nup scrupulously, and the place had been both restored and modernized\non the inside without harming the classic outlines of the\nhundred-and-fifty-year-old structure.\n\nA fence surrounded the estate, but the front gate was swinging open.\nMalone saw it and took a deep breath. Now, he told himself, or never.\nHe drove the Lincoln through the opening slowly, alert for almost\nanything.\n\nThere was no disturbance. Thirty yards from the front door he pulled\nthe car to a cautious stop and got out. He started to walk toward the\nbuilding. Each step seemed to take whole minutes, and everything he\nhad thought raced through his mind again.\n\nNothing seemed to move anywhere, except Malone himself.\n\nWas he right? Were the PRS people really here? Or had he been led\nastray by them? Had he been manipulated as easily as they had\nmanipulated so many others?\n\nThat was possible. But it wasn't the only possibility.\n\nSuppose, he thought, that he was perfectly right, and that the PRS\nmembers were waiting inside. And suppose, too, that he'd misunderstood\ntheir motives.\n\nSuppose they were just waiting for him to get a little closer.\n\nMalone kept walking.\n\nIn just a few steps, he would be close enough so that a bullet aimed\nat him from the house hadn't a real chance of missing him.\n\nAnd it didn't have to be bullets, either. They might have set a trap,\nhe thought, and were waiting for him to walk right into it. Then they\nwould hold him prisoner while they devised ways to...\n\nTo what? He didn't know. And that was even worse; it called up\nhorrible terrors from the darkest depths of Malone's mind. He\ncontinued to walk forward, feeling about as exposed as a restaurant\nlamb chop caught with its panty down.\n\nHe reached the steps that led up to the porch, and took them one at a\ntime.\n\nHe stood on the porch. A long second passed.\n\nHe took a step toward the high, wide and handsome oaken door. Then he\ntook another step, and another.\n\nWhat was waiting for him inside?\n\nHe took a deep breath, and pressed the doorbell button.\n\nThe door swung open immediately, and Malone involuntarily stepped\nback.\n\nThe owner of the house smiled at him from the doorway. Malone let out\nhis breath in one long sigh of relief.\n\n\"I was hoping it would be you,\" he said weakly. \"May I come in?\"\n\n\"Why, certainly, Malone. Come on in. We've been expecting you, you\nknow,\" said Andrew J. Burris, director of the FBI.\n\n\n15\n\nMalone sat, quietly relaxed and almost completely at ease, in the\ndepths of a huge, comfortable, old-fashioned Morris chair. Three\nsimilar chairs were clustered with his, around a squat, massive coffee\ntable made of a single slab of dark wood set on short, curved legs.\nMalone looked around at the other three with a relaxed feeling of\nrecognition: Andrew J. Burris, Sir Lewis Carter, and Luba Vasilovna\nGarbitsch.\n\n\"That mind shield of yours,\" Burris was saying, \"is functioning very\nwell. We weren't entirely sure you had actually located us until you\npulled into that driveway.\"\n\n\"I wasn't entirely sure what I was locating,\" Malone said.\n\n\"And so it's over,\" Burris said with a satisfied air. \"Everything's\nover.\"\n\n\"And just beginning,\" Sir Lewis put in. He drew a pipe from an inside\npocket and began to fill it.\n\n\"And, of course,\" Burris said, \"just beginning. Things do that; they\ngo round and round in circles. It's what makes everything so\nconfusing.\"\n\n\"And so much fun,\" Lou said, leaning back in her chair. She didn't\nlook hostile now, Malone thought; she looked like a cat, wary but\ncontent. He decided that he liked this Lou even better than the old\none. Lou, at home among her psionic colleagues, was even more than\nhe'd ever thought she could be.\n\n\"More what?\" she said suddenly. Burris jerked upright a trifle.\n\n\"What's more what?\" he said. \"Damn it, let's stick to one thing or the\nother. As soon as this thing starts mixing talk and thought it\nconfuses me.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" Lou said. She smiled across the table at Malone.\n\nMalone jerked a finger under his collar.\n\n\"What made you decide to come here?\" Sir Lewis said. He had the pipe\nlit now, and blew a cloud of fragrant smoke over the table.\n\nMalone wondered where to start. \"One of the clues,\" he said at last,\n\"was the efficiency of the FBI. It hit me the same way the efficiency\nof the PRS had hit me, while I was looking at the batch of reports\nthat had been run off so rapidly.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Sir Lewis said. \"The dossiers.\"\n\n\"Dossiers?\" Burris said.\n\nSir Lewis puffed at his pipe. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I thought you had\nbeen tuned in for that.\"\n\n\"I was busy,\" Burris said. \"I can't tune into everything. After all,\nI've only got one mind.\"\n\n\"And two hands,\" Malone said at random.\n\n\"At least,\" Lou said. Their eyes met in a glance of perfect\nunderstanding.\n\n\"What the hell do hands have to do with it?\" Burris said.\n\nSir Lewis shrugged. \"Tune in and see,\" he said. \"It's an old joke; but\nyou'll never really adjust to telepathy unless you practice.\"\n\n\"Damn it,\" Burris said, \"I practice. I'm always practicing. This and\nthat and the other thing--after all, I am the director of the FBI.\nThere's a lot to be done.\"\n\nSir Lewis puffed at his pipe again. \"At any rate,\" he said smoothly,\n\"Mr. Malone had requested some dossiers on us. On the PRS, myself, and\nLuba. They arrived very quickly. The efficiency of that arrival, and\nthe efficiency he'd been noting about the FBI ever since he began work\non this case, finally struck home to him.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" Burris said. \"You see? The FBI's a full-time job. It's got to be\nefficient.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Sir Lewis said soothingly.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" Malone said, \"Sir Lewis is right. While every other branch\nof the government was having its troubles with the Great Confusion,\nthe FBI was ticking along like a transistorized computer.\"\n\n\"A good start,\" Sir Lewis said.\n\n\"Darn good,\" Burris said. \"Malone, I knew I could depend on you.\nYou're a good man.\"\n\nMalone swallowed hard. \"Well, anyway,\" he said after a pause, \"when I\nsaw that I began to remember a few other things. Starting with a\ncouple of years ago, when we first found Her Majesty, remember?\"\n\n\"I'll never forget it,\" Burris said fervently. \"She knighted me.\nKnight Commander of the Queen's Own FBI. What a moment.\"\n\n\"Thrilling,\" Malone said. \"But you got to Yucca Flats for your\nknighting awfully quickly, a little too fast even for a modern plane.\"\n\n\"It had to be done,\" Burris said. \"Anyhow, I've never really liked\nplanes. Basically unsafe. People crash in them.\"\n\n\"But you wouldn't,\" Malone said. \"You could always teleport yourself\nout.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Burris said. \"But that's troublesome. Why bother? Anyhow, I'd\nbeen to Yucca Flats before, so I could teleport there--a little way\ndown the road, where I could meet my car--without any trouble.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, that was one thing,\" Malone said. \"And then there was Her\nMajesty, when she pointed at that visiphone screen and accused you of\nbeing the telepathic spy. Remember?\"\n\n\"She wasn't pointing at me,\" Burris said. \"She was pointing at the man\nin the next room. How about you doing some remembering?\"\n\n\"Sure she was,\" Malone said. \"But it was just a little coincidence.\nAnd I have a hunch she felt, subconsciously, that there was something\nnot quite right about you.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Burris conceded. \"But that doesn't answer my question.\"\n\n\"It doesn't?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Now look, Malone,\" Burris said. \"None of this is proof. Not real\nproof. Not the kind the FBI has trained you to look for.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"What I want to know,\" Burris said, \"is why you came here, to my home?\nAnd in spite of everything you've said, that hasn't been tied down.\"\n\nMalone frowned. After a second's thought he said, \"Well...  All I know\nis that it just seemed obvious. That's all.\"\n\n\"Indeed it is,\" Sir Lewis said. \"But one of the things we'll have to\nteach you, my boy, is how to distinguish between a deduction from\nobserved fact and a psionic intuition. You've been confusing them for\nsome years now.\"\n\n\"I have?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Sure you have,\" Burris said. \"And, what's more--\"\n\n\"Well, he's no worse than you are, Andrew,\" Lou said.\n\nBurris turned. \"Me?\" he said in a voice of withering scorn.\n\n\"Certainly,\" Lou said. \"After all, you've never really become used to\nmixtures of thought and speech. And, what's more, you've been using\ntelepathy so long that when you try to communicate with nothing but\nwords you only confuse yourself.\"\n\n\"And everybody else,\" Sir Lewis added.\n\n\"Hmpf,\" Burris said. \"I'm busy all the time. I haven't got any extra\ntime for practice.\"\n\nMalone nodded, comparatively unsurprised. He'd wondered for years how\na man so obviously unable to express himself clearly could run an\norganization like the FBI as well as he did. Having psionic abilities\nevidently led to drawbacks as well as advantages.\n\n\"Actually,\" he said, \"my prescience made one mistake.\"\n\n\"Really?\" Burris said, looking both worried and pleased about it.\n\n\"I expected the place to be full of people,\" Malone said. \"I thought\nthe elite corps of the PRS would be here.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Burris said, looking crestfallen.\n\n\"Why, that was no mistake,\" Sir Lewis said. \"As a matter of fact, they\nare all here. But they're quite busy at the moment; things are coning\nto a head, you know, and they must work quite undisturbed.\"\n\n\"And this,\" Burris added, \"is a good place for it. There are sixty\nrooms in this house. Sixty.\"\n\n\"That's a lot of rooms,\" Malone said politely.\n\n\"A mansion,\" Burris said. \"A positive mansion. And my family has lived\nhere ever since--\"\n\n\"I'm sure Ken isn't very interested in your family just now,\" Lou\nbroke in.\n\n\"My family,\" Burris said with dignity, \"is a very interesting family.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it must be,\" Lou said demurely. Sir Lewis choked with\nlaughter suddenly and began waving his pipe. After a minute, Malone\njoined in.\n\n\"Damn it,\" Burris said. \"Let's stick to one thing or the other. Did I\nsay that?\"\n\n\"Twice,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Sixty rooms,\" Burris said. \"All built by my family. And local\ncontractors, of course. That's enough to house sixty rooms full of\npeople. And that number of people is a large houseful, I should\nthink.\"\n\n\"It sounds like a lot,\" Malone said.\n\n\"It is a lot,\" Burris said. \"All in my house. The house my family\nbuilt.\"\n\n\"And we're grateful for it,\" Sir Lewis said soothingly. \"We truly\nare.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Burris said.\n\n\"You must have had a large family,\" Lou said.\n\n\"A large family,\" Burris said, \"and many guests. Many, many guests.\nFrom all over. Including famous people. General Hood slept in this\nhouse, and he slept very well indeed.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact,\" Lou added, \"he's still sleeping. They call it\nbeing dead.\"\n\n\"That's not funny,\" Burris snapped.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Lou said. \"It was meant to be.\"\n\n\"I--\" Burris shut his mouth and glared.\n\nMalone was far away, thinking of the sixty rooms full of people,\nsitting quietly, their minds ranging into the distance, meshed\ntogether in small units. It was a picture that frightened and\ncomforted him at the same time. He wasn't sure he liked it, but he\ncertainly didn't dislike it, either.\n\nAfter all, he told himself confusedly, too many cooks save a stitch in\ntime.\n\nHe veered away from that sentence quickly. \"Tell me,\" he said, \"were\nyou receiving my broadcast on the way here?\"\n\nBurris and Sir Lewis nodded. Lou started to nod, too, but stopped and\nlooked surprised. \"You mean you didn't know we were?\" she said.\n\n\"How could I know?\" Malone said. \"After all, I was just tossing it out\nand hoping that somebody was on the listening end.\"\n\n\"But of course somebody was,\" Lou said. \"I was.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said. \"But I still don't see how I was supposed to know\nthat you--\"\n\n\"I answered you, silly,\" Lou said. \"I kept on answering you.\nRemember?\"\n\nMalone blinked, focused and then said, very slowly, \"That was my\nimagination. Please tell me it was my imagination before I go nuts.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Lou said. \"It wasn't.\"\n\n\"But that kind of thing,\" Malone said, \"it takes a tremendous amount\nof power, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Not when the receiver is a telepath,\" Lou said sweetly.\n\nMalone nodded slowly. \"That,\" he said, \"is exactly what I'm afraid of.\nDon't tell me--\"\n\nThere was silence.\n\n\"Well?\" Malone said.\n\n\"You said not to tell you,\" Lou said instantly.\n\n\"All right,\" Malone said. \"I rescind the order. Am I a telepath, or am\nI not?\"\n\nLou's lips didn't move. But then, they didn't have to.\n\nThe message came, unbidden, into Malone's mind.\n\n_Of course you are. That was the whole reason for Andrew's assigning\nyou to this type of case._\n\n\"My God,\" Malone said softly.\n\nSir Lewis laid down his pipe in a handy ashtray. \"Of course,\" he said,\n\"you will find it difficult to pick up anyone but Lou, at first. The\nrapport between you two is really quite strong.\"\n\n\"Very strong indeed,\" Lou murmured. Malone found himself beginning to\nblush.\n\n\"It will be some time yet,\" Sir Lewis went on, \"before you can really\ncall yourself a telepath, my boy.\"\n\n\"I'll bet it will,\" Malone said. \"Before I can call myself a telepath\nI'm going to have to get thoroughly used to the idea. And that's going\nto take a long, long time indeed.\"\n\n\"You only think that,\" Sir Lewis said. \"Actually, you're used to the\nidea now. That was Andrew's big job.\"\n\n\"His big job?\" Malone said. \"Now, wait a minute--\"\n\n\"You don't think I picked you for our first psionics case out of thin\nair, do you?\" Burris said. \"Before anything else, you had to be forced\nto accept the fact that such things as telepaths really existed.\"\n\n\"Oh, they do,\" Malone said. \"They certainly do.\"\n\n\"There's me, for instance,\" Burris said. \"But you had to be convinced.\nSo I ordered you to go out and find one.\"\n\n\"Like the Bluebird of Happiness,\" Malone said.\n\nBurris frowned. \"What's like the Bluebird of Happiness?\" he said.\n\n\"You are,\" Malone said.\n\n\"I am not,\" Burris said indignantly. \"Bluebirds eat worms. My God,\nMalone.\"\n\n\"But the Bluebird,\" Malone said doggedly, \"was right at home all the\ntime, while everyone searched for it far away. And I had to go far\naway to find a telepath, when you were the one who ordered me to do\nit.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Burris said. \"So you went and found Her Majesty. And, when\nyou did find her, she forced acceptance on you simply by being Her\nMajesty and proving to you, once and for all, that she could read\nminds.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Malone said. \"Of course, I could have got myself killed\ntaking these lessons--\"\n\n\"We were watching you,\" Burris said. \"If anything had happened, we'd\nhave been right on the spot.\"\n\n\"In time to bury the body,\" Malone said. \"I think that's very\nthoughtful of you.\"\n\n\"We would have arrived in time to save you,\" Burris said. \"Don't\nquibble. You're alive, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said slowly, \"if you're not sure, I don't know how I\ncan convince you.\"\n\n\"There,\" Burris said triumphantly. \"You see?\"\n\nMalone sighed wearily. \"Okay,\" he said. \"So you sent me out to find a\ntelepath and to prove to me that there were such things. And I did.\nAnd then what happened?\"\n\n\"You had a year,\" Burris said, \"to get used to the idea of somebody\nreading your mind.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Malone said. \"Of course, I didn't know it was you.\"\n\n\"It was Her Majesty too,\" Burris said. \"Everybody.\"\n\n\"Good old Malone,\" Malone said. \"The human peep-show.\"\n\n\"Now, that's what we mean,\" Sir Lewis broke in. \"Subconsciously, you\ndisliked the idea of leaving your thoughts bare to anyone, even a\nsweet little old lady. To some extent, you still do. But that will\npass.\"\n\n\"Goody,\" Malone said.\n\n\"The residue is simply not important,\" Sir Lewis went on. \"Your\ntelepathic talents prove that.\"\n\n\"Oh, fine,\" Malone said. \"Here I am reading minds and teleporting and\nall sorts of things. What will the boys back at Headquarters think\nnow?\"\n\n\"We'll get to that,\" Burris said. \"But that first case did one more\nthing for you. Because you didn't like the idea of leaving your mind\nopen, you began to develop a shield. That allowed you some sort of\nmental privacy.\"\n\n\"And then,\" Malone said, \"I met Mike Fueyo and his little gang of\nteleporting juvenile delinquents.\"\n\n\"So that you could develop a psionic ability of your own,\" Burris\nsaid. \"That completed your acceptance. But it took a threat to\nsolidify that shield. That was step three. When you discovered your\nmind was being tampered with--\"\n\n\"The shield started growing stronger,\" Malone said. \"Sure. Her Majesty\ntold me that, though she didn't know why.\"\n\n\"Right,\" Burris said.\n\n\"But, wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"How could I do all that without\nknowing it? How would I know that some of my thoughts were safe behind\na shield if I didn't know the shield existed and couldn't even tell if\nmy mind were being read?\" He paused. \"Does that make sense?\" he asked.\n\n\"It does,\" Burris said, \"but it shouldn't.\"\n\n\"What?\" Malone said.\n\n\"Two years ago, you had the answer to that one,\" Burris said. \"Dr.\nO'Connor's machine. Remember why it did detect when a person's mind\nwas being read?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"Oh, sure. He said that any human being would know,\nsubconsciously, whether his mind was being read.\"\n\n\"He did, indeed,\" Burris said. \"And then we came to the fourth step:\nto put you in rapport with some psionicist who could teach you how to\ncontrol the shield, how to raise and lower it, you might say. To learn\nto accept other thoughts, as well as reject them. To learn to accept\nyour full telepathic talent. That was Lou's job.\"\n\n\"Lou's ... job?\" Malone said. He felt his own shield go up. The\nthoughts behind it weren't pleasant. Lou had been ... well, hired to\nstay with him. She had pretended to like him; it was part of her job.\n\nThat was perfectly clear now.\n\nHorribly clear.\n\n\"You are now on your way,\" Sir Lewis said, \"to being a real\npsionicist.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Malone said dully. \"But why me? Why not, oh, Wolfe Wolf? I'd\nthink he'd have a better chance than I would.\"\n\n\"My secretary,\" Burris said, \"has talents enough of his own. But you,\nyou're something brand-new. It's wonderful, Malone. It's exciting.\"\n\n\"It's a new taste thrill,\" Malone murmured. \"Try Bon-Ton B-Complex\nBolsters. Learn to eat your blanket as well as sleep with it.\"\n\n\"What?\" Burris said.\n\n\"Never mind,\" Malone said. \"You wouldn't understand.\"\n\n\"But I--\"\n\n\"I know you wouldn't,\" Malone said, \"because I don't.\"\n\nSir Lewis cleared his throat \"My dear boy,\" he said, \"you represent a\nbreakthrough. You are an adult.\"\n\n\"That,\" Malone said testily, \"is not news.\"\n\n\"But you are a telepathic adult,\" Sir Lewis said. \"Many of them are\ncapable of developing it into a useful ability. Children who have the\ntalent may accidentally develop the ability to use it, but that almost\ninvariably results in insanity. Without proper guidance, a child is no\nmore capable of handling the variety of impressions it receives from\nadult minds than it is capable of understanding a complex piece of\nmodern music. The effort to make a coherent whole out of the\nimpression overstrains the mind, so to speak, and the damage is\npermanent.\"\n\n\"So here I am,\" Malone said, \"and I'm not nuts. At least I don't think\nI'm nuts.\"\n\n\"Because you are an adult,\" Sir Lewis went on. \"Telepathy seems to be\nalmost impossible to develop in an adult, even difficult to test for\nit. A child may be tested comparatively simply; an adult, seldom or\nnever.\"\n\nHe paused to relight his pipe.\n\n\"However,\" he went on, \"the Psychical Research Society's executive\nboard discovered a method of bringing out the ability in a talented\nchild as far back as 1931. All of us who are sane telepaths today owe\nour ability to that process, which was applied to us, in each case,\nbefore the age of sixteen.\"\n\n\"How about me?\" Malone said.\n\n\"You,\" Sir Lewis said, \"are the first adult ever to learn the use of\npsionic powers from scratch.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Malone said. \"And that's why Mike Fueyo, for instance, could\nlearn to teleport, though his older sister couldn't.\"\n\n\"Mike was an experiment,\" Sir Lewis said. \"We decided to teach him\nteleportation without teaching him telepathy. You saw what happened.\"\n\n\"Sure I did,\" Malone said. \"I had to stop it.\"\n\n\"We were forced to make you stop him,\" Sir Lewis said. \"But we also\nlet him teach you his abilities.\"\n\n\"So I'm an experiment,\" Malone said.\n\n\"A successful experiment,\" Sir Lewis added.\n\n\"Well,\" Malone said dully, \"bully for me.\"\n\n\"Don't feel that way,\" Sir Lewis said. \"We have--\"\n\nHe stopped suddenly, and glanced at the others. Burris and Lou stood\nup, and Sir Lewis followed them.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Sir Lewis said in a different tone. \"There's something\nimportant that we must take care of. Something quite urgent, I'm\nafraid.\"\n\n\"You can go on home, Malone,\" Burris said. \"We'll talk later, but\nright now there's a crisis coming and we've got to help. Leave the\ncar. I'll take care of it.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said, without moving.\n\nLou said, \"Ken--\" and stopped. Then the three of them turned and\nstarted up the long, curving staircase that led to the upstairs rooms.\n\nMalone sat in the Morris chair for several long minutes, wishing that\nhe were dead. Nobody made a sound. He rubbed his hands over the soft\nleather and tried to tell himself that he was lucky, and talented, and\nsuccessful.\n\nBut he didn't care.\n\nHe closed his eyes at last, and took a deep breath.\n\nThen he vanished.\n\n\n16\n\nTwo hours passed, somehow. Bourbon and soda helped them pass, Malone\ndiscovered; he drank two highballs slowly, trying not to think about\nanything, and kept staring around at the walls of his apartment\nwithout really seeing anything. He felt terrible.\n\nHe made himself a third bourbon and soda and started in on it. Maybe\nthis one would make him feel better. Maybe, he thought, he ought to\nbreak out the cigars and celebrate.\n\nBut there didn't seem to be very much to celebrate, somehow.\n\nHe felt like a guinea pig being congratulated on having successfully\nresisted a germ during an experiment.\n\nHe drank some more of the bourbon and soda. Guinea pigs didn't drink\nbourbon and soda, he told himself. He was better off than a guinea\npig. He was happier than a guinea pig. But he couldn't imagine any\nguinea pig in the world, no matter how heartbroken, feeling any worse\nthan Kenneth J. Malone.\n\nHe looked up. There was another guinea pig in the room.\n\nThen he frowned. She wasn't a guinea pig. She was one off the\nexperimenters. She was the one the guinea pig was supposed to fall in\nlove with, so the guinea pig could be nice and telepathic and all the\nother experimenters could congratulate themselves. But whoever heard\nof a scientist falling in love with a guinea pig? It was fate. And\nfate was awful. Malone had often suspected it, but now he was sure.\nNow he saw things from the guinea pig's side, and fate was terrible.\n\n\"But Ken,\" the experimenter said. \"It isn't like that at all.\"\n\n\"It is, too,\" Malone said. \"It's even worse, but that'll have to wait.\nWhen I have some more to drink it will get worse. Watch and see.\"\n\n\"But Ken--\" Lou hesitated, and then went on. \"Don't feel sad about\nbeing an experiment. We're all experiments.\"\n\n\"I'm the guinea pig,\" Malone said. \"I'm the only guinea pig. You said\nso.\"\n\n\"No, Ken,\" she said. \"Remember, all of us in the PRS got early\ntraining when it was new and untried. Some of those methods weren't as\ngood as we now have them; that's why a man like your boss sometimes\ntends to have a little trouble.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But I'm your guinea pig. You made me dance\nthrough hoops and do tricks and everything just for an experiment.\nThat's what.\" He took another swallow of his drink. \"See?\" he said.\n\"It's getting worse already.\"\n\n\"No, it's not,\" Lou said. \"It's getting better, if you'll only listen.\nI wasn't given this job, Ken. I volunteered for it.\"\n\n\"That isn't any better,\" Malone said morosely.\n\n\"I volunteered because I--because I liked you,\" Lou said. \"Because I\nwanted to work with you, wanted to be with you.\"\n\n\"It's more experimenting,\" Malone said flatly. \"More guinea-pigging\naround.\"\n\n\"It isn't, Ken,\" Lou said. \"Believe me. Look into my mind. Believe\nme.\"\n\nMalone tried. A second passed...\n\nAnd then a long time passed, without any words at all.\n\n\"Well, well,\" Malone said at last. \"If this is the life of a guinea\npig, I'm all for it.\"\n\n\"I'm all for guinea pigs' rights,\" Lou said. \"Life, Liberty and the\nPursuit of Me.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" Malone said. \"How about that crisis, by the way? Are you\ngoing to have to leave suddenly again?\"\n\nLou stretched lazily on the couch. \"That's all over with, thank God,\"\nshe said. \"We had to get our agent out of Miami Beach, and cover his\ntracks at the same time.\"\n\n\"Tricky,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Very,\" Lou said.\n\n\"But--\" Malone blinked. \"Wait a minute,\" he said. \"Your agent? You\nmean you had Governor Flarion killed?\"\n\nLou nodded soberly. \"We had to,\" she said. \"That paranoid mind of his\nhad built up a shield we simply couldn't get through. He had plans for\nmaking himself president, you know--and all the terrifying\npotentialities of an embryonic Hitler.\" She grimaced. \"We don't like\nbeing forced to kill,\" she said, \"but sometimes we've got to.\"\n\nMalone thought of his own .44 Magnum, and the times he had used it,\nand nodded very slowly.\n\n\"There are still a couple of questions, though,\" he said. \"For\ninstance, there's that trip to Russia. Why _did_ you make it? Was it\nyour father?\"\n\n\"Of course it was,\" Lou said. \"We had to get him back in and make sure\nhe was safe.\"\n\n\"You mean that Vasili Garbitsch is a PSR member?\" Malone said,\nstunned.\n\n\"Well, really,\" Lou said. \"Did you think my father would really be a\nspy? We had to get him back to Russia; he was needed for work in the\nKremlin. That's why we nudged Boyd into making the arrest.\"\n\n\"And the others?\" Malone said. \"Brubitsch and Borbitsch?\"\n\n\"Real spies,\" Lou said. \"Bad ones, but real. Any more questions?\"\n\n\"Some,\" Malone said. \"Were you kidding about that drink in Moscow?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I wish I had been,\" she said. \"But I was\nconcentrating on Petkoff, who didn't know a thing about the drugged\ndrink. I didn't catch anything else until after I'd swallowed it. And\nthen it was too late.\"\n\n\"Good old Petkoff,\" Malone said. \"Always helpful. But he was right\nabout one thing, anyway.\"\n\n\"What?\" Lou said.\n\n\"The FBI,\" Malone said. \"He told us it was a secret police\norganization. And, by God, in a way it is!\"\n\nLou grinned. Malone started to laugh outright. They found themselves\nvery close and the laughter stopped, and there was some more time\nwithout words. When Malone broke free, he had a suddenly sobered\nexpression on his face.\n\n\"Hey,\" he said. \"What about Tom Boyd? He knows a lot but he hasn't got\nany talents, as far as I know, and--\"\n\n\"He'll be all right,\" Lou said. \"Andrew and the others have thought of\nthat.\"\n\n\"But he knows an awful lot about the evidence I dug up.\"\n\n\"Andrew will give him a cover-up explanation they're working out,\" Lou\nsaid. \"That will convince Boyd there's nothing more to worry about. Of\ncourse, we may have to change his mind about a few things, but we can\ndo that, probably through you, since you know him best. There's\nnothing for you to worry over, Ken. Nothing at all.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Malone said. He leaned over and kissed her. \"Because I'm not\nin the least worried.\"\n\nLou sighed deeply, looking off into space.\n\n\"Luba Malone,\" she said. \"It sounds nice. And, after all, my mother\nwas Irish. At least it sounds better than Garbitsch.\"\n\n\"What doesn't?\" Malone said automatically. Then he blinked. \"Hey,\n_I'm_ Malone!\" he said. \"How could you be Malone?\"\n\n\"Me?\" Lou said. She caroled happily. \"I'm Malone because I love you,\nlove you with all my heart.\"\n\n\"That,\" Malone said, \"does it. A woman after my own heart.\"\n\nLou made a low curtsy.\n\n\"And a woman of grace and breeding,\" Malone said. \"Eftsoons, if that\nmeans anything.\"\n\n\"You know,\" Lou said, \"I like you even better when you're being Sir\nKenneth. Especially when you're talking to yourself.\"\n\n\"My innate gallantry and all my good qualities come out,\" Malone said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Lou said. \"Indeed they do. All over the place. It's nice to go\nback to Elizabethan times, anyhow, in the middle of all these\ntroubles.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" Malone said. \"There's always been trouble. In the\nMiddle Ages, it was witches. In the Seventeenth Century, it was\ndemons. In the Nineteenth it was revolutions. In--\"\n\nLou cut him off with a kiss. When she broke away Malone raised his\neyebrows.\n\n\"I prithee,\" he said, \"interrupt me not. I am developing a scheme of\nphilosophy. There have always been troubles. In the 1890's there was a\nDepression and panic, and the Spanish-American War--\"\n\n\"All right, Sirrah,\" Lou said. \"And then what?\"\n\n\"Let's see,\" Malone said, reverting to 1973 for a second. \"In 1903\nthere was the airplane, and troubles abroad.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Lou said. \"Do go on, Sirrah. Your liege awaits your slightest\nword.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" Malone said.\n\n\"That, Milord, was a very slight word indeed,\" Lou said. \"What's after\n1903?\"\n\nMalone smiled and went back to the days of the First Elizabeth\nhappily.\n\n\"In 1914, it was enemy aliens,\" said Sir Kenneth Malone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Supermind, by \nGordon Randall Garrett and Laurence Mark Janifer\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SUPERMIND ***\n\n***** This file should be named 22342-8.txt or 22342-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/2/3/4/22342/\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
