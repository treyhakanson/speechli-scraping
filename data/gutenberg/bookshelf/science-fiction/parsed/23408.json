A. TAYLOR\n\nIllustrated by Emsh\n\n     _\"Far\" is strictly a relative term. Half a world away from home is,\n     sometimes, no distance at all!_\n\n\nSomeone must have talked over the fence because the newshounds were\nclamoring on the trail within an hour after it happened.\n\nThe harassed Controller had lived in an aura of \"Restricteds,\"\n\"Classifieds\" and \"Top Secrets\" for so long it had become a mental\nconditioning and automatically hedged over information that had been\npublic property for years via the popular technical mags; but in time\nthey pried from him an admittance that the Station Service Lift rocket\nA. J. \"Able Jake\" Four had indeed failed to rendezvous with Space\nStation One, due at 9:16 Greenwich that morning.\n\nThe initial take-off and ascent had gone to flight plan and the pilot,\nin the routine check-back after entering free flight had reported no\nmotor or control faults. At this point, unfortunately, a fault in the\ntracking radar transmitter had resulted in it losing contact with the\ntarget. The Controller did not, however, mention the defection of the\nhungover operator in fouling up the signal to the standby unit, or the\nconsequent general confusion in the tracking network with no contact at\nall thereafter, and fervently hoped that gentlemen of the press were not\ntoo familiar with the organization of the tracking system.\n\nAt least one of the more shrewd looking reporters appeared as though he\nwere mentally baiting a large trap so the Controller, throwing caution\nto the winds, plunged headlong into a violent refutal of various\nerroneous reports already common in the streets.\n\nAble Jake did not carry explosives or highly corrosive chemicals, only\nsome Waste Disposal cylinders, dry foodstuffs and sundry Station\nHousehold supplies.\n\nFurthermore there was no truth in the oft-revived rumors of weaknesses\nin the so-called \"spine-and-rib\" construction of the Baur and Hammond\nType Three vessel under acceleration strain. The type had been\ndiscontinued solely because the rather complicated structure raised\ncertain stowage difficulties in service with overlong turnabout times\nresulting.\n\nThere may have been a collision with a meteor he conceded, but, it was\nthought, highly unlikely. And now, the urgent business of the search\ncalled, the Controller escaped, perspiring gently.\n\nAble Jake was sighted a few minutes later but it was another three hours\nbefore a service ship could be readied and got away without load to\nallow it as much operating margin as possible. Getting a man aboard was\nyet another matter. At this stage of space travel no maneuver of this\nnature had ever been accomplished outside of theory. Fuel-thrust-mass\nratios were still a thing of pretty close reckoning, and the service\nlift ships were simply not built for it.\n\nThe ship was in an elliptical orbit and a full degree off its normal\ncourse. A large part of the control room was demolished and there was a\nlengthy split in the hull. There was no sign of the pilot and some of\nthe cargo was missing also. The investigating crew assumed the obvious\nand gave it as their opinion that the pilot had been literally\ndisintegrated by the intense heat of the collision.\n\nThe larger part of the world's population made it a point to listen in\non the first space burial service in history over the absent remains of\nJohnny Melland.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuch a small thing to cause such a fury. A mere twenty Earth pounds of\nan indifferent grade of rock and a little iron, an irregular, ungraceful\nlump, spawned somewhere a billion years before as a star died. But it\nstill had most of the awesome velocity and inertia of its birth.\n\nAble Jake, with the controlling influence of the jets cut, had yawed\nslightly and was now traveling crabwise. The meteor on its own course, a\ntrifle oblique to that of the ship, struck almost directly the slender\nspring steel spine, the frightful energy of the impact transmuted on the\ninstant into a heat that vaporized several feet of the nose and spine\nbefore the dying shock caused an anguished flexing of the ship's\nbackbone; thrust violently outward along the radial members and so\nagainst the ribs and hull sheathing on that side. Able Jake's hull split\nopen like a pea pod for fully half its length and several items of its\ncargo burst from their lashings, erupted from the wound.\n\nJohnny was not inboard at the time, but floating, spacesuited alongside,\nfreeing a fouled lead to the radar bowl, swearing occasionally but\nwithout any real passion at the stupidity of the unknown maintenance man\nwho failed to secure it properly. For some odd reason he had never quite\nlost the thrill of his first trip \"outside,\" and, donning pressure suit\nwith the speed of long practice, sneaked as many \"inspections\" as\npossible, with or without due cause.\n\nThe second's fury that reduced the third stage of a $5,000,000 rocket to\njunk was evident to him only as a brilliant blue-white flash, a\nhammer-like shock through the antennae support that left his wrist and\nforearm numb. Then a violent wrench as a long cylinder, expelled from\nthe split hull, caught the loop of his life line and dragged him in till\nhe clashed hard against it, the suddenly increased tension or a sharp\nedge parting the line close to the anchored end. He clawed blindly for a\nhold, found something he could not at that moment identify and hung on.\n\nFor a short time his vision seemed dulled and that part of his mind,\ntrained to the quick analysis of sudden situations groped but feebly\nthrough a haze of shock to understand what had happened. Orienting\nhimself he found he was gripping a brace of the open-mounted motor on\none of the Waste Disposal Cylinders. About him he could see other odd\nitems of the cargo, some clustering fairly closely, others just\nperceptibly drifting farther away. To one side, or \"downwards\" the Earth\nrolling vastly, pole over pole, and with her own natural rotation\ngiving an odd illusion of slipping sideways from under him.\n\nOnly a sudden sun glint on the stubby swept-back wings showed him where\nAble Jake was. Far away--too far, spinning slowly end over end. His\nsideways expulsion from the ship then had been enough to give him and\nhis companion debris a divergent course.\n\nSpacemen accept without question the fact of a ship or a station always\nat hand with a safety man on watch at all times over those outside and a\n\"bug\" within signaling distance constantly. They do not conceive of any\nother state of affairs.\n\nNow Johnny had to face the fact that he was in such a position--entirely\nand utterly alone, except for the useless flotsam that came with him. He\nmight have flung himself into a mad chase after the ship on his suit\njets except that the thought of leaving his little island, cold comfort\nthough it was, to plunge into those totally empty depths was suddenly\nhorrible.\n\nThe tide of panic rose within him. He knew the sickening bodily revolt\nof blind unreasoning terror--the terror of the lost, the terror of\ncertain untimely death, but mostly of death so dreadfully alone.\n\nHe might have gone insane. In the face of the insoluble problem his mind\nmight have retreated into a shadow world of its own, perhaps to prattle\nhappily the last few hours away. But there was something else there. The\npre-flight school psychiatrist had recognized it, Johnny himself\nprobably wouldn't have and it wasn't their policy to tell him. It saved\nhim. The labored heart pounding and the long shuddering gasps slowed in\ntime and with the easing of his physical distress he found enough heart\nto muster a wry little smile at the thought that of the castaways of\nhistory he at least stood fair to be named the most unique.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd after a while, shaking himself mentally, a little ashamed of his\ntemporary fall from grace, he followed the example of the more\nintelligent of his predecessors and settled down to itemize his assets,\nanalyze his position and conjecture the chances of survival.\n\nItem: He was encased in a Denby Bros. spacesuit, Mark III, open space\nusage, meant for no gravity use. Therefore it had no legs as such, the\nlower half being a rigid cylinder allowing considerable movement within\nand having a swivel mounted rocket motor at its base controlled by toe\npedals inside.\n\nThe upper half, semiflexible with jointed arms ending in gloves from\nwhich by contorting the shoulders the hands could be withdrawn into the\nsleeves when not in use.\n\nA metal and tinted plastic helmet with earphones, mike and chin switch.\nAn oxy air-conditioning and reprocessing unit with its spare pure oxygen\ntank; on this he could possibly depend for twelve hours given no undue\nexertion and with the most rigid economy all the time.\n\nThe power pack for suit operation and radio had a safety margin of one\nhour over the maximum air supply, if the radio wasn't used. At this time\nJohnny couldn't see much use for it.\n\nItem: One Waste Disposal Cylinder, expendable, complete with motor and\nfull fuel tanks, packed, according to his loading manifest with sundry\nsupplies to avoid dead stowage space. Seldom used, since most station\nwaste was ferried down in the otherwise empty service ships, they\noccasionally handled certain laboratory refuse it was considered best to\ndestroy in space. The cylinders were decelerated and allowed to fall\ninto atmosphere where the friction of the unchecked plunge burned up\nwhat the magnesium charge inside had not already. The rest of the\nshipwrecked material had by now drifted beyond easy reach and Johnny did\nnot feel like wasting fuel rounding it up.\n\nPosition? A matter of memory and some guesswork by now. Some ten minutes\nout of powered flight at the time of collision, coasting up to station\norbit where a quick boost from the jets would have made up his lost\nvelocity to orbit standard. But there would be no boost now. So he'd\njust fall off around the other side, falling around and into Mother\nEarth, to skim atmosphere and climb on past and up to touch orbit\naltitude--and down again. A nice elliptical orbit, apogee a thousand odd\nmiles, perigee, sixty-seventy--perhaps. How much speed had he left? How\nlong would it be before he brushed the fringe of atmosphere once too\noften and too deep? Just another meteor.\n\nAnd survival. A comparatively simple problem since the mechanics of it\nwere restricted by a simple formula in which his role would seem to be a\npassive one. To survive he must be rescued by his own kind in twelve\nhours or less. To be rescued he must be seen or heard. Since his radio\nwas a simple short-range intercom it followed that he must be seen first\nand heard later. Being seen meant making a sufficiently distinguishable\n_blip_ on somebody's radar screen to arouse comment over a _blip_ where,\naccording to schedule no orbiting _blip_ should be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJohnny was painfully aware that the human body is very small in space.\nThe cylinder would be a help but he doubted it would be enough. Then he\nthought of the material inside the cylinder. He pried back the lugs\nholding the cover in place with the screwdriver from his belt kit. He\nstarted pulling out packages, bags, boxes, thrusting them behind him,\nabove him, downwards; cereals, ready mixed pastries, bundles of\ndisposable paper overalls--toilet paper! He worked furiously, now stuck\nhalfway down the cylinder, kicking the bundles behind him. He emerged\nfinally in a flurry of articles clutching a large plastic bag that had\nfilled the entire lower end of the tank.\n\nAbout him drifted a sizable cloud of station supplies, stirring\nsluggishly after his emergence. He pushed them a bit more, distributing\nthem as much as possible without losing them altogether.\n\nJohnny tore open the big bag and was instantly enveloped in clinging\nfolds of ribbon released from the pressure of its packing. He knew what\nit was now, the big string of ribbon chutes for the Venus Expedition,\nintended for dropping a remote controlled mobile observer to the as yet\nunseen and unknown surface. Johnny had ferried parts of the crab-like\nmechanical monster on the last run, and illogically found himself\nworrying momentarily over the set-back to the Probe his mischance would\ncause.\n\nBut in the next minute he was making fast the lower end of the string to\nthe WD cylinder, then, finding the top chute he toed his pedals and\njetted himself out, trailing the string out to its full extent.\n\nNow the period of action was over and he had done all he could, Johnny\nfound himself dreading the time of waiting to follow. He would have time\nfor thinking, and thinking wasn't profitable under the circumstances\nunless it were something definitely constructive and applicable to his\npresent and future well-being. Waiting was always bad.\n\nSurely they would find him soon. Surely they would press the search\nfarther even when they found Able Jake as they couldn't fail to in time.\n\nA tightness started in his throat. Johnny quickly drowned the thought in\na flood of inconsequential nonsense, a trick he had learned as a green\npilot. He might sleep though, if sleep were a possible thing in this\ncold emptiness. No one, to his recollection, had ever done so outside a\nship or station--the space psychology types would be interested\ndoubtless.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJohnny tied his life line to the WD cylinder and then jetted clear of\nhis artificial cloud, positioning himself so that it formed a partial\nscreen between himself and the sun. He turned his oxygen down to the\nbare minimum and the thermostat as low as he dared. He commenced a\nrelaxation exercise and was pleased when it worked after a fashion--a\nmental note for Beaufort at the station. A drowsiness crept over him,\ndulling a little the thin edge of fear that probed his consciousness.\n\nFace down towards the earth he hung. The slow noise of his breathing\nonly intensified the complete silence outside. The well padded suit\nencompassed him so gently there was no sense of pressure on his body to\nmake up for the weightlessness. Johnny felt as though he were bodiless,\na naked brain with eyes only hanging in nothingness.\n\nBeneath, Earth rolled over with slow majesty, once every two hours. His\naltered course was evident now, passing almost directly over the\ngeographic poles proper instead of paralleling the twilight zone where\nnight and day met. Sometimes he caught the faint glow of a big city on\nthe night side but the sight only stirred the worm of anxiety and he\nclosed his eyes.\n\nJohnny was beginning to feel very comfortable. He supposed sleepily\nthat this was the way you were assumed to feel while freezing to death\nin a snowbank, or so he'd heard. Air and heat too low perhaps. He should\nreally turn it up a notch.\n\nOn the other hand it was perhaps a solution to the problem of dying--a\ngentle sleep while the stomach was still full enough from the last meal\nto be reasonably comfortable and the throat yet unparched. Would it be\nthe act of an unbalanced mind or one of the most supreme sanity?\n\nHe dozed and dreamed a bit in fragments and snatches but it was not a\ngood sleep--there was no peace in it. At one time he seemed to be\nstanding outside the old fretworked boarding house he lived in--looking\nin at the window of the \"sitting room\" where the ancient, wispy landlady\nsat among her antimacassared chairs and the ridiculous tiny seashell\nashtrays that overflowed after two butts. He wanted desperately to get\nin and sprawl in the huge bat-winged chair by the fire and stroke the\nenormous old gray cat that would leap up and trample and paw his stomach\nbefore settling down to grumble to itself asthmatically for hours.\n\nIt was cold and dark out here and he wanted to get in to the\nfriendliness and the warmth and the peaceful, familiar security, but he\ndidn't dare go around to the door because he knew if he did the vision\nwould vanish and he'd never find it again.\n\nHe scratched and beat at the window but his fingers made no sound, he\ntried to shout but his cries were only strangled whispers and the old\nlady sat and rocked and talked to the big gray cat and never turned her\nhead.\n\nThe fire seemed to be flaring up suddenly, it was filling the whole\nroom--a monstrous furnace; it shouldn't do that he knew, but the old\nlady didn't seem to mind sitting there rocking amid the flames--and it\nwas so nice and warm. The fire kept growing and swelling though--soon it\nburst through the window and engulfed him. Too hot. Too hot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJohnny swam hazily back to consciousness with an aching head and thick\nmouth. He saw that he had drifted clear of his protective screen somehow\nand the sun beat full on him. With clumsy, fumbling hands that seemed to\nbelong to somebody else he managed the air valve; the increased oxygen\nreviving him enough to find the pedals and jet erratically about till he\ngained the shadow once more.\n\nNow he was entering upon the worst phase of the living nightmare. Awake,\nthe doubts and fears of his position tormented him; wearied, he feared\nto sleep, yet continually he found himself nodding only to jerk awake\nwith that suddenness that is like a physical blow. Each one of these\nawakenings took away a little more of his self-control till he was\nreduced to near hysteria, muttering abstractly, sometimes whimpering\nlike a lost child; now seized with a feverish concern for his air\nsupply. He would at one instant cut it down to a dangerous minimum,\nthen, remembering the near disaster of his first attempt at economy,\nfrantically turn it up till he was in danger of an oxygen jag. In a\nmoment he would forget and start all over again.\n\nIn addition, he was now realizing bitterly what he had subconsciously\ndenied to himself for so long, that they had found Able Jake and drawn\nthe obvious conclusion. That he had been obliterated or blown out\nthrough the hull by the collision without warning or preparation. That\nhe was undoubtedly dead if not vaporized altogether and, as they must,\nconsidering the expense of a probably fruitless search, abandon him.\n\nThere came the moment when Johnny accepted this in full. This was\ndirectly after the time when, sliding down the long hill to the perigee\nof his orbit, he turned on his radio and cried for help. It was a bare\nhundred miles or less to that wonderful world below, but there was the\nHeaviside layer, and the weak signals beat but feebly against it. All\nthat seeped through by some instant's freak of transmission was a\nfragment of incoherent babble to reach the uncomprehending ear of an\nArkansas ham and give that gentleman uneasy sleep for some time to come.\n\nHe kept calling mechanically even after perigee was long past, praying\nfor an answer from the powerful transmitters below or from a searching\nship. But when there was no slightest whisper in his phones or answering\nflare among the stars, Johnny came to the end of faith. Even of\nawareness, for his own ears did not register the transition of his calls\nto an insane howling of intermixed pleas, threats, condemnation--a sewer\nflood of foul vilification against those who had betrayed him.\n\nBright and beautiful, Earth rolled blandly beneath him, the sun was a\nremote impersonal thing and the stars mocked silently. After a while the\nradio carried only the agonized sounds of a man who had forgotten how to\ncry and must learn again. There were times after this when he observed\nincuriously a parade of mind pictures, part memory, part pure\nhallucination and containing nothing of reason; other times when he\nthought not at all. The sun appeared to dwindle, retreating and fading\nfar away into a remote place where there were no stars at all. It became\na feeble candle, guttered unsteadily a moment and suddenly winked out.\nAbruptly Johnny was asleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe opened his eyes and surveyed the scene with an oddly calm and\ndispassionate curiosity, not that he expected to find his status changed\nin any way but because he had awakened with a queer sense of unreality\nabout the whole business. He knew vaguely that he'd had a bad time in\nthe last few hours but could remember little of the details save that it\nwas like one of those fragmentary nightmares in the instant between\nsleeping and waking when it is difficult to divide the fact from the\ndream. Now he must reassure himself that this facet of it was real and\nwhen he had done so, realized with a faint shock that he was no longer\nafraid.\n\nFear, it seemed, had by its incessant pressure dulled its own edge. The\nacceptance of inevitable death was still there, but now it seemed to\nhave little more significance than the closing of a book at the last\npage.\n\nIt is possible that Johnny was not wholly sane at this point, but there\nis no one to witness this and Johnny, not given to introspection at any\ntime, felt no spur to self-analysis, beyond a brief mental registration\nof the fact.\n\nSo he made his visual survey, saw that it was real, nothing had changed;\nnoted with mild surprise that he'd somehow remained in the shadow of his\nscreen this time. He had lost track of time entirely but the suit's air\nsupply telltale was in the yellow indicating about two hours more or\nless to go on breathing. In quick succession he reviewed the events,\naccepted the probability of the abandoned search without a qualm and\nmade his decision. There was no need to wait about any longer.\n\nA quick flip of the helmet lock, a moment's unpleasantness perhaps, and\nout. As for the rest--a spaceman needs no sanctified ground, the\nincorruptible vault of space is as good a place as any and perhaps the\nmore fitting for one of the first to travel its ways.\n\nWell then--quickly. Johnny raised his hands.\n\nBut still--\n\nMan has his pride and his vanity. Johnny, though not necessarily prone\nto inflated valuation of himself still has just enough vanity left to\nresent the thought of this anonymous snuffing out in the dark. There\nshould be, he thought, at least some outward evidence of his passing,\nsomething like--a flare of light perhaps, that would in effect say, if\nonly to one solitary star gazer: \"Here at this position, at this\ninstant, Johnny Melland, Spaceman, had his time.\"\n\nThe whimsy persisted. Johnny, casting about mentally for some means to\nthe end recalled the thermite bomb for the WD cylinder and was hauling\nhimself in to it when he remembered the charges for this lot had gone up\nwith Sally Uncle One two days before. But now he'd actually touched the\nmetal cylinder and, as though the brief contact had completed some\nobscure mental circuit, the mad idea was conceived, flared up into an\nirrepressible brilliance and exploded in a harsh bark of laughter.\n\nOne last push to his luck then, hardly worse than a gambler's last chip\nexcept that the consequences of failure were somewhat more certain.\nEither way he'd have what he wanted--survival or, in the brief\nincandescence of friction's heat, a declaration of his passing.\n\nA waste disposal cylinder will carry the equivalent of about three tons\nof refuse. Its motor is designed to decelerate that mass by 1,075 mph in\norder to allow it to assume a descending orbit.\n\nLess the greater part of the customary mass, it should be considerably\nmore effective, and since he was already in what constituted a descent\npath, but for a few miles and a little extra velocity, there would not\nbe the long fall afterwards to pick up what he'd lost.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\nFrom there on his plan entered the realm of pure hypothesis; except for\nthe broad detail the rest depended on luck and whatever freakish\nconditions might arise in his favor during the operation. These, too,\nwould be beyond his control and any move to take advantage of them would\nhave to be instinctive, providing he was in any shape to do so.\n\nThe tendency to gnaw worriedly at a thousand disturbing possibilities\ndrowned quickly in a rapidly rising sense of reckless abandon that\npossessed him. The prospect of positive action of any sort served to\nrelease any tension left in him and almost gayly he moved to set his\nplan in action.\n\nHe jimmied the timer on the rocket motor so it would fire to the last\ndrop. The string of ribbon chutes he reeled in hand over hand stuffing\nit into the cylinder, discovering in the process why the chute Section\nhands at Base wore that harried look. The mass of slithering,\nincompressible white-and-yellow ribbon and its shrouds resisted him like\na live thing; in the end Johnny managed to bat and maul the obstreperous\nstuff down the length of the tank. Even so, it filled it to within a\ncouple of inches of the opening.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nNow he cut off a length of his life line and attached one end to the\nspring-loaded trigger release on the motor control, leaving enough to\ntrail the length of the cylinder and double back inside when he wanted\nit. He blessed the economically minded powers that insisted on manual\nfiring control on these one-shot units instead of the complex radio\ntriggers beloved of the technical brains.\n\nMaking fast to the chutes was a major problem but eventually he managed\na makeshift harness of the remainder of the safety line. He wound it\nawkwardly around himself with as many turns as possible, each returned\nagain and again through, the ring at the end of the master shroud.\n\nBy now he was casting anxious glances at the Earth below, aware that he\nmust have passed apogee several minutes before and that not more than\nsome twenty minutes were left before the low point of this swing would\nbe near. He was grimly aware also that it must be this time or not at\nall. The air telltale was well through the yellow band and the next\npossible chance after this one was an hour's time away, when conditions\ninside the suit would be getting pretty sticky.\n\nJockeying the unwieldy cylinder into line of flight and making it stay\nthere took a lot longer than Johnny counted on. With no other manual\npurchase than that afforded by his own lesser mass, the job proved\nalmost impossible and he had to use his suit motor. This caused some\nconcern over his meager fuel supply since his plan called for some\nflat-out jetting later on. In the frantic flurry of bending, twisting,\nover and under--controlling, the veneer of aplomb began to wear. Johnny\nwas sweating freely by the time he had the cylinder stabilized as best\nhe could judge and had gingerly worked himself into the open end as far\nas he could against the cushioning mass of ribbon chute. He took the\ntrigger lanyard loosely in hand and craning his neck to see past the\nbulk of the cylinder he watched and waited.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo the experienced lift pilot there are certain subtle changes in color\nvalues over the Earth's surface as one approaches more closely the outer\nfringe of atmosphere. While braking approaches are auto-controlled, the\npilot taking over only after his ship is in atmosphere, the\nconscientious man makes himself familiar with the \"feel\" of a visually\ntimed approach--just in case--and Johnny was a good pilot.\n\nWatching Equatorial Africa sliding obliquely towards him Johnny suddenly\ngave thought to a possible landing spot for the first time. Not that he\nhad any choice but a picture of a cold, wet immersion in any of several\npossible bodies of water was not encouraging. The suit would probably\nfloat but which end first was a matter for conjecture and out of it he\nwould be as badly off for Johnny could not swim a stroke.\n\nNor had he any clear idea how long it would take to slow down to a\nvertical drop. Able Jake made a full half swing of the globe to brake\ndown but Able Jake was an ultra-streamlined object with many times the\nmass and weight of Johnny and his rig; furthermore the ships were\ncontrollable to a certain degree while Johnny was not. Beyond the\ncertain knowledge that the effect of the chutes would be quite violent\nand probably short-lived, the rest was unpredictable.\n\nHe tried to shake off gloomy speculation, uneasily aware that much of\nthe carefree confidence of the last hour had deserted him. In a more\nnormal state of mind again he became prey to tension once more, a\npounding heart and dry mouth recalling mercilessly the essential\nfrailties of his kind. So, with aching neck and burning eyes he strained\nfor a clear view past the length of the cylinder and--\n\nThere! The preliminary to the visual changes, a sudden sweep of\ndistortion over the landscape as his angle of sight through the\nrefracting particles became more shallow. Now was the time he had judged\nthe throat vane gyros should begin their run-up.\n\nHe worked the lanyard back carefully, fearful an awkward movement might\nupset the cylinder's line-up, pulling the trigger lever over to\nhalf-cock where the micro switch should complete circuit with the dry\npower pack. There should be approximately one minute before the major\ncolor changes began, which was also the minimum time for gyro run up.\nJohnny resumed the watching and the waiting.\n\nHow long is a minute?\n\nIs it the time it takes the fear-frozen trainee, staring glass-eyed at\nthe fumbled grenade to realize that this one at his feet is a dud?\n\nOr is it the time before the rock-climber, clinging nail and toe to the\nrock face with the rope snapped suddenly taut, feels it at last slacken\nand sees the hands gripping safely come into sight?\n\nPerhaps the greenhorn, rifle a-waver, watching the glimpse of tawny\ncolor in the veldt-grass and waiting the thunder and the charge, could\nsay.\n\nThey'd all be wrong. It's much longer.\n\nLong enough for Johnny to think of a dozen precautions he could have\ntaken, a dozen better ways to rig this or that. Long enough to worry\nabout whether the gyros were really running up as they should. A\nthousand queries and doubts piled mountainously upward to an almost\nunbearable peak of tension till suddenly the browns and greens below\nflashed a shade lighter and it was time, and the savage snap on the\nlanyard a blessed relief and total committal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the few seconds after the firing of the prime and before the busy\nlittle timer snapped the valves wide open Johnny managed to slip his\ntoes under the jet pedals to avoid accidental firing. At the same time\nhe braced himself as rigidly as possible with aching arms against the\nwalls of the cylinder.\n\nHe saw briefly the flare of the jet reflected off the remnants of his\ncloud of station stores before deceleration with all its unpleasantness\nbegan.\n\nThe lip of the cylinder's mouth swept up past his helmet as he was\nrammed deep into the absorbent mass of ribbon chute. This wasn't a\npadded contour chair under a mild 3G lift. The chutes took the first\nshock, but Johnny took the rest the hard way, standing bolt upright.\n\nHe found with some surprise his head was right down through the neck\nring and inside the suit proper, his arms half withdrawn from the\nsleeves, knees buckled to an almost unbelievable angle considering the\ndimensions of the lower case.\n\nHe had time to hope fervently the cheap expendable motor wouldn't burn\nout its throat and send him cart-wheeling through space, or blow the\nsurrounding tanks before the blackout came down.\n\nHe came out of it sluggishly, to find the relief from the dreadful\npressure almost as stupefying as the deceleration itself. While his\nconscious mind screamed the urgency of immediate action, his bruised and\ntwisted body answered but feebly. The condition of complete\nweightlessness and the springy reaction of the ribbon mass was all that\nallowed him finally to claw himself out of the cylinder to where he\ncould use the suit jet without fear of burning the precious chutes.\n\nHe was so tired. His muscles of their own accord seemed to relax\nintermittently, interfering with the control of his movements. Only the\nsudden sight of the Earth, transformed by a weird illusion of position\nfrom a bright goal to an enormous, distorted thing, looming, apparently,\nover him with glowing menace, spurred his flagging resolution to frantic\nactivity.\n\nHe jetted straight back trailing his string of chutes behind him, then,\nbefore the last was free of the cylinder, kicked himself around to\nassume the original course once more.\n\nAt this stage it was no longer possible, even granted the time, to judge\nvisually how near he was to the atmosphere. The uneasy feeling that he\nmust already be brushing the Troposphere jarred his nerve so that he\nmerely gave himself a short flat-out boost in the right direction before\nspinning bodily one hundred eighty degrees so that he was traveling feet\nfirst.\n\nReflected in the curved helmet face, the string of chutes obediently\nfollowed-my-leader around a ragged U-shape, the last--the small\npilot-chute trailed limply around as he watched.\n\nThere could surely be but a few seconds left before the grand finale.\nJohnny found he was unconsciously holding his breath, and, as he\ndeliberately inhaled long slow draughts of his already staling air,\nrealized abstractly that he seemed to be attempting to meet his possible\nend with some degree of dignity if not with resignation, and wondered\nif he were the exception or the rule.\n\nPossibly, he thought sardonically, because there is so little room for\ndignity in our living years, and was mildly surprised at an\nuncharacteristic excursion into the realm of philosophy.\n\nThere was a faintly perceptible tug on the harness. It was sustained and\nnow there came a definite strain. Reflected for a moment in the helmet\nface was a glimpse of the lead chute slowly opening out like a gigantic\nflower.\n\nThen swiftly, in half a breath the harness coils were tightening about\nhim like steel fingers, the heavy ring at the end of the master shroud\nclashed against the back of his helmet and began a sickening, thrumming\nvibration there.\n\nThe harness encompassed his torso like a vise but his legs were\nunsupported and weighed what seemed a thousand tons. He could feel them\nstretching. Somewhere a coil slipped a fraction. His arms were jerked\nsuddenly upwards and Johnny knew a sensation he'd never believed\npossible. At the same time his leaden feet crashed down on the jet\npedals. For a few, brief, blessed moments the intolerable extension\neased a fraction with the firing of the suit jets.\n\nHe cringed mentally from the thought of what was to come and thought\nhazily: \"This is what the rack was like. This is going to be bad, bad,\nbad!\"\n\nIt was impossible and Johnny went out with the last drop of fuel.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSomewhere there was a queer coughing sound like wind through a crevice.\nHe strained to identify it but an awful agony swamped him and he fled\nbefore it back into the darkness.\n\nAnd later still a thumping and a rushing, gurgling sound.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDim, grotesque figures moved about him or swooped and hovered over him.\nHe felt an unreasoning fear of them and tried to shut them out. They\nwere holding him down, hurting him. One was pulling and twisting at his\narm. He shouted and swore at it telling it to leave him alone, but it\nignored him or didn't seem to hear. There was a sudden dull snapping\nsound and a little of the pain abated.\n\nThe figures flowed together and swirled around like some great oily\nvortex but never quite left him.\n\nThen there was a time when they separated jerkily and became the hazy\nbut definable figures of men in rough seaman's clothes. Johnny had never\nheard Breton French before; in his dazed condition the apparently insane\ngabble might well have been the tongue of another world and gave him\nlittle assurance. He hurt so badly and so generally that he could not\nhave determined that he was lying down save for a view of white clouds\nscudding overhead.\n\nSome of the men were holding up what looked like a crumpled parody of a\nman. He recognized it without surprise as the soaking remains of his\nspacesuit, battered and with tattered shreds of outer cover and\ninsulation hanging in festoons.\n\nA sharp, bearded face shot into focus abruptly, waving a hypodermic\nneedle. It spoke English and observed passionately either to Johnny or\nitself that: \"Name of a Spanish cow! What is it in men that they must\nabuse themselves so? Now here is one who was both squeezed and stretched\nalternately as well as hammered, dehydrated and almost asphyxiated, is\nit not? This will bear watching. It is alive but there will have to be\nX-rays in profusion.\"\n\nIt danced long sensitive fingers over the welts and bruises and\ncommented bluntly that it was well the fishermen had returned his arms\nand legs into their sockets before he fully regained consciousness. It\nmuttered and clucked to itself as it used the hypo which Johnny could\nnot feel. \"Formidable!\"\n\nThe pleasant drowsiness came down just as he was identifying the queer\nsmell as ozone, brine and good fresh air.\n\nAfter a while they moved him to a small hospital in an upcoast town,\nwhere he slept much, suffered not a little and, even waking, viewed the\nworld incuriously through drug-laden eyes. Finally they allowed him to\nwaken fully and the sharp-faced doctor, together with half a dozen\nothers from various parts of the world decided that, after all, he\nseemed to be surviving.\n\nJohnny lay and itched intolerably in the cast that covered him from nape\nto thigh and listened to the bustling of the elderly nursing sister who,\ngood soul, having never been more than ten miles from her town in her\nlife, reminded him that it wanted but two days to Christmas and opined\nthat: \"Such a tragedy for M'sieu. To be so far from home!\"\n\nJohnny smiled at the ceiling, not daring to laugh yet, and sniffed at\nthe salt sea air with its undertone of rank seaweed and gloried in it;\neven a chance whiff of that particular cigarette tobacco that only a\nFrenchman can appreciate. He thought that here, as across the water,\nnight and day followed each other in their proper order and the ground\nwas a solid thing beneath the feet.\n\nWhy--he could never be closer.\n\n\nFIN.\n\n\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\n  |                      Transcriber's Note                      |\n  |                                                              |\n  | This etext was produced from Astounding Science Fiction,     |\n  | December 1955.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
