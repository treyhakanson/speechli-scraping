Nourse\n\n\nThe letter came down the slot too early that morning to be the regular\nmail run. Pete Greenwood eyed the New Philly photocancel with a dreadful\npremonition. The letter said:\n\n    PETER:\n    Can you come East chop-chop, urgent?\n    Grdznth problem getting to be a PRoblem, need expert\n    icebox salesman to get gators out of hair fast.\n    Yes? Math boys hot on this, citizens not so hot.\n    Please come.\n                                                TOMMY\n\nPete tossed the letter down the gulper with a sigh. He had lost a bet to\nhimself because it had come three days later than he expected, but it\nhad come all the same, just as it always did when Tommy Heinz got\nhimself into a hole.\n\nNot that he didn't like Tommy. Tommy was a good PR-man, as PR-men go. He\njust didn't know his own depth. PRoblem in a beady Grdznth eye! What\nTommy needed right now was a Bazooka Battalion, not a PR-man. Pete\nsettled back in the Eastbound Rocketjet with a sigh of resignation.\n\nHe was just dozing off when the fat lady up the aisle let out a scream.\nA huge reptilian head had materialized out of nowhere and was hanging in\nair, peering about uncertainly. A scaly green body followed, four feet\naway, complete with long razor talons, heavy hind legs, and a whiplash\ntail with a needle at the end. For a moment the creature floated upside\ndown, legs thrashing. Then the head and body joined, executed a\nhorizontal pirouette, and settled gently to the floor like an eight-foot\ncircus balloon.\n\nTwo rows down a small boy let out a muffled howl and tried to bury\nhimself in his mother's coat collar. An indignant wail arose from the\nfat lady. Someone behind Pete groaned aloud and quickly retired behind a\nnewspaper.\n\nThe creature coughed apologetically. \"Terribly sorry,\" he said in a\ncoarse rumble. \"So difficult to control, you know. Terribly sorry....\"\nHis voice trailed off as he lumbered down the aisle toward the empty\nseat next to Pete.\n\nThe fat lady gasped, and an angry murmur ran up and down the cabin. \"Sit\ndown,\" Pete said to the creature. \"Relax. Cheerful reception these days,\neh?\"\n\n\"You don't mind?\" said the creature.\n\n\"Not at all.\" Pete tossed his briefcase on the floor. At a distance the\nhuge beast had looked like a nightmare combination of large alligator\nand small tyrannosaurus. Now, at close range Pete could see that the\n\"scales\" were actually tiny wrinkles of satiny green fur. He knew, of\ncourse, that the Grdznth were mammals--\"docile, peace-loving mammals,\"\nTommy's PR-blasts had declared emphatically--but with one of them\nsitting about a foot away Pete had to fight down a wave of horror and\nrevulsion.\n\nThe creature was most incredibly ugly. Great yellow pouches hung down\nbelow flat reptilian eyes, and a double row of long curved teeth\nglittered sharply. In spite of himself Pete gripped the seat as the\nGrdznth breathed at him wetly through damp nostrils.\n\n\"Misgauged?\" said Pete.\n\nThe Grdznth nodded sadly. \"It's horrible of me, but I just can't help\nit. I _always_ misgauge. Last time it was the chancel of St. John's\nCathedral. I nearly stampeded morning prayer--\" He paused to catch his\nbreath. \"What an effort. The energy barrier, you know. Frightfully hard\nto make the jump.\" He broke off sharply, staring out the window. \"Dear\nme! Are we going _east_?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid so, friend.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear. I wanted _Florida_.\"\n\n\"Well, you seem to have drifted through into the wrong airplane,\" said\nPete. \"Why Florida?\"\n\nThe Grdznth looked at him reproachfully. \"The Wives, of course. The\nclimate is so much better, and they mustn't be disturbed, you know.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Pete. \"In their condition. I'd forgotten.\"\n\n\"And I'm told that things have been somewhat unpleasant in the East just\nnow,\" said the Grdznth.\n\nPete thought of Tommy, red-faced and frantic, beating off hordes of\nindignant citizens. \"So I hear,\" he said. \"How many more of you are\ncoming through?\"\n\n\"Oh, not many, not many at all. Only the Wives--half a million or\nso--and their spouses, of course.\" The creature clicked his talons\nnervously. \"We haven't much more time, you know. Only a few more weeks,\na few months at the most. If we couldn't have stopped over here, I just\ndon't know _what_ we'd have done.\"\n\n\"Think nothing of it,\" said Pete indulgently. \"It's been great having\nyou.\"\n\nThe passengers within earshot stiffened, glaring at Pete. The fat lady\nwas whispering indignantly to her seat companion. Junior had half\nemerged from his mother's collar; he was busy sticking out his tongue at\nthe Grdznth.\n\nThe creature shifted uneasily. \"Really, I think--perhaps Florida would\nbe better.\"\n\n\"Going to try it again right now? Don't rush off,\" said Pete.\n\n\"Oh, I don't mean to rush. It's been lovely, but--\" Already the Grdznth\nwas beginning to fade out.\n\n\"Try four miles down and a thousand miles southeast,\" said Pete.\n\nThe creature gave him a toothy smile, nodded once, and grew more\nindistinct. In another five seconds the seat was quite empty. Pete\nleaned back, grinning to himself as the angry rumble rose around him\nlike a wave. He was a Public Relations man to the core--but right now he\nwas off duty. He chuckled to himself, and the passengers avoided him\nlike the plague all the way to New Philly.\n\nBut as he walked down the gangway to hail a cab, he wasn't smiling so\nmuch. He was wondering just how high Tommy was hanging him, this time.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe lobby of the Public Relations Bureau was swarming like an upturned\nanthill when Pete disembarked from the taxi. He could almost smell the\ndesperate tension of the place. He fought his way past scurrying clerks\nand preoccupied poll-takers toward the executive elevators in the rear.\n\nOn the newly finished seventeenth floor, he found Tommy Heinz pacing the\ncorridor like an expectant young father. Tommy had lost weight since\nPete had last seen him. His ruddy face was paler, his hair thin and\nragged as though chunks had been torn out from time to time. He saw Pete\nstep off the elevator, and ran forward with open arms. \"I thought you'd\nnever get here!\" he groaned. \"When you didn't call, I was afraid you'd\nlet me down.\"\n\n\"Me?\" said Pete. \"I'd never let down a pal.\"\n\nThe sarcasm didn't dent Tommy. He led Pete through the ante-room into\nthe plush director's office, bouncing about excitedly, his words\ntumbling out like a waterfall. He looked as though one gentle shove\nmight send him yodeling down Market Street in his underdrawers. \"Hold\nit,\" said Pete. \"Relax, I'm not going to leave for a while yet. Your\ngirl screamed something about a senator as we came in. Did you hear\nher?\"\n\nTommy gave a violent start. \"Senator! Oh, dear.\" He flipped a desk\nswitch. \"What senator is that?\"\n\n\"Senator Stokes,\" the girl said wearily. \"He had an appointment. He's\nready to have you fired.\"\n\n\"All I need now is a senator,\" Tommy said. \"What does he want?\"\n\n\"Guess,\" said the girl.\n\n\"Oh. That's what I was afraid of. Can you keep him there?\"\n\n\"Don't worry about that,\" said the girl. \"He's growing roots. They swept\naround him last night, and dusted him off this morning. His appointment\nwas for _yesterday_, remember?\"\n\n\"Remember! Of course I remember. Senator Stokes--something about a riot\nin Boston.\" He started to flip the switch, then added, \"See if you can\nget Charlie down here with his giz.\"\n\nHe turned back to Pete with a frantic light in his eye. \"Good old Pete.\nJust in time. Just. Eleventh-hour reprieve. Have a drink, have a\ncigar--do you want my job? It's yours. Just speak up.\"\n\n\"I fail to see,\" said Pete, \"just why you had to drag me all the way\nfrom L.A. to have a cigar. I've got work to do.\"\n\n\"Selling movies, right?\" said Tommy.\n\n\"Check.\"\n\n\"To people who don't want to buy them, right?\"\n\n\"In a manner of speaking,\" said Pete testily.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Tommy. \"Considering some of the movies you've been\nselling, you should be able to sell anything to anybody, any time, at\nany price.\"\n\n\"Please. Movies are getting Better by the Day.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. And the Grdznth are getting worse by the hour. They're\ncoming through in battalions--a thousand a day! The more Grdznth come\nthrough, the more they act as though they own the place. Not nasty or\nanything--it's that infernal politeness that people hate most, I think.\nCan't get them mad, can't get them into a fight, but they do anything\nthey please, and go anywhere they please, and if the people don't like\nit, the Grdznth just go right ahead anyway.\"\n\nPete pulled at his lip. \"Any violence?\"\n\nTommy gave him a long look. \"So far we've kept it out of the papers, but\nthere have been some incidents. Didn't hurt the Grdznth a bit--they have\npersonal protective force fields around them, a little point they didn't\nbother to tell us about. Anybody who tries anything fancy gets thrown\nlike a bolt of lightning hit him. Rumors are getting wild--people saying\nthey can't be killed, that they're just moving in to stay.\"\n\nPete nodded slowly. \"Are they?\"\n\n\"I wish I knew. I mean, for sure. The psych-docs say no. The Grdznth\nagreed to leave at a specified time, and something in their cultural\nbackground makes them stick strictly to their agreements. But that's\njust what the psych-docs think, and they've been known to be wrong.\"\n\n\"And the appointed time?\"\n\nTommy spread his hands helplessly. \"If we knew, you'd still be in L.A.\nRoughly six months and four days, plus or minus a month for the time\ndifferential. That's strictly tentative, according to the math boys.\nIt's a parallel universe, one of several thousand already explored,\naccording to the Grdznth scientists working with Charlie Karns. Most of\nthe parallels are analogous, and we happen to be analogous to the\nGrdznth, a point we've omitted from our PR-blasts. They have an\neight-planet system around a hot sun, and it's going to get lots hotter\nany day now.\"\n\nPete's eyes widened. \"Nova?\"\n\n\"Apparently. Nobody knows how they predicted it, but they did. Spotted\nit coming several years ago, so they've been romping through parallel\nafter parallel trying to find one they can migrate to. They found one,\nsort of a desperation choice. It's cold and arid and full of impassable\nmountain chains. With an uphill fight they can make it support a\nfraction of their population.\"\n\nTommy shook his head helplessly. \"They picked a very sensible system for\ngetting a good strong Grdznth population on the new parallel as fast as\npossible. The males were picked for brains, education, ability and\nadaptability; the females were chosen largely according to how pregnant\nthey were.\"\n\nPete grinned. \"Grdznth in utero. There's something poetic about it.\"\n\n\"Just one hitch,\" said Tommy. \"The girls can't gestate in that climate,\nat least not until they've been there long enough to get their glands\nadjusted. Seems we have just the right climate here for gestating\nGrdznth, even better than at home. So they came begging for permission\nto stop here, on the way through, to rest and parturiate.\"\n\n\"So Earth becomes a glorified incubator.\" Pete got to his feet\nthoughtfully. \"This is all very touching,\" he said, \"but it just doesn't\nwash. If the Grdznth are so unpopular with the masses, why did we let\nthem in here in the first place?\" He looked narrowly at Tommy. \"To be\nvery blunt, what's the parking fee?\"\n\n\"Plenty,\" said Tommy heavily. \"That's the trouble, you see. The fee is\nso high, Earth just can't afford to lose it. Charlie Karns'll tell you\nwhy.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCharlie Karns from Math Section was an intense skeleton of a man with a\nlong jaw and a long white coat drooping over his shoulders like a\nshroud. In his arms he clutched a small black box.\n\n\"It's the parallel universe business, of course,\" he said to Pete, with\nTommy beaming over his shoulder. \"The Grdznth can cross through. They've\nbeen able to do it for a long time. According to our figuring, this must\ninvolve complete control of mass, space and dimension, all three. And\ntime comes into one of the three--we aren't sure which.\"\n\nThe mathematician set the black box on the desk top and released the\nlid. Like a jack-in-the-box, two small white plastic spheres popped out\nand began chasing each other about in the air six inches above the box.\nPresently a third sphere rose up from the box and joined the fun.\n\nPete watched it with his jaw sagging until his head began to spin. \"No\nwires?\"\n\n\"_Strictly_ no wires,\" said Charlie glumly. \"No nothing.\" He closed the\nbox with a click. \"This is one of their children's toys, and\ntheoretically, it can't work. Among other things, it takes null-gravity\nto operate.\"\n\nPete sat down, rubbing his chin. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I'm beginning to see.\nThey're teaching you this?\"\n\nTommy said, \"They're trying to. He's been working for weeks with their\ntop mathematicians, him and a dozen others. How many computers have you\nburned out, Charlie?\"\n\n\"Four. There's a differential factor, and we can't spot it. They have\nthe equations, all right. It's a matter of translating them into\nconstants that make sense. But we haven't cracked the differential.\"\n\n\"And if you do, then what?\"\n\nCharlie took a deep breath. \"We'll have inter-dimensional control, a\npractical, utilizable transmatter. We'll have null-gravity, which means\nthe greatest advance in power utilization since fire was discovered. It\nmight give us the opening to a concept of time travel that makes some\nkind of sense. And power! If there's an energy differential of any\nmagnitude--\" He shook his head sadly.\n\n\"We'll also know the time-differential,\" said Tommy hopefully, \"and how\nlong the Grdznth gestation period will be.\"\n\n\"It's a fair exchange,\" said Charlie. \"We keep them until the girls have\ntheir babies. They teach us the ABC's of space, mass and dimension.\"\n\nPete nodded. \"That is, if you can make the people put up with them for\nanother six months or so.\"\n\nTommy sighed. \"In a word--yes. So far we've gotten nowhere at a thousand\nmiles an hour.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I can't do it!\" the cosmetician wailed, hurling himself down on a chair\nand burying his face in his hands. \"I've failed. Failed!\"\n\nThe Grdznth sitting on the stool looked regretfully from the cosmetician\nto the Public Relations men. \"I say--I _am_ sorry....\" His coarse voice\ntrailed off as he peeled a long strip of cake makeup off his satiny\ngreen face.\n\nPete Greenwood stared at the cosmetician sobbing in the chair. \"What's\neating _him_?\"\n\n\"Professional pride,\" said Tommy. \"He can take twenty years off the face\nof any woman in Hollywood. But he's not getting to first base with\nGorgeous over there. This is only one thing we've tried,\" he added as\nthey moved on down the corridor. \"You should see the field reports.\nWe've tried selling the advances Earth will have, the wealth, the power.\nNo dice. The man on the street reads our PR-blasts, and then looks up to\nsee one of the nasty things staring over his shoulder at the newspaper.\"\n\n\"So you can't make them beautiful,\" said Pete. \"Can't you make them\ncute?\"\n\n\"With those teeth? Those eyes? Ugh.\"\n\n\"How about the 'jolly company' approach?\"\n\n\"Tried it. There's nothing jolly about them. They pop out of nowhere,\nanywhere. In church, in bedrooms, in rush-hour traffic through Lincoln\nTunnel--look!\"\n\nPete peered out the window at the traffic jam below. Cars were snarled\nup for blocks on either side of the intersection. A squad of traffic\ncops were converging angrily on the center of the mess, where a stream\nof green reptilian figures seemed to be popping out of the street and\nlumbering through the jammed autos like General Sherman tanks.\n\n\"Ulcers,\" said Tommy. \"City traffic isn't enough of a mess as it is. And\nthey don't _do_ anything about it. They apologize profusely, but they\nkeep coming through.\" The two started on for the office. \"Things are\ngetting to the breaking point. The people are wearing thin from sheer\nannoyance--to say nothing of the nightmares the kids are having, and the\ntrouble with women fainting.\"\n\nThe signal light on Tommy's desk was flashing scarlet. He dropped into a\nchair with a sigh and flipped a switch. \"Okay, what is it now?\"\n\n\"Just another senator,\" said a furious male voice. \"Mr. Heinz, my\narthritis is beginning to win this fight. Are you going to see me now,\nor aren't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, come right in!\" Tommy turned white. \"Senator Stokes,\" he\nmuttered. \"I'd completely forgotten--\"\n\nThe senator didn't seem to like being forgotten. He walked into the\noffice, looked disdainfully at the PR-men, and sank to the edge of a\nchair, leaning on his umbrella.\n\n\"You have just lost your job,\" he said to Tommy, with an icy edge to his\nvoice. \"You may not have heard about it yet, but you can take my word\nfor it. I personally will be delighted to make the necessary\narrangements, but I doubt if I'll need to. There are at least a hundred\nsenators in Washington who are ready to press for your dismissal, Mr.\nHeinz--and there's been some off-the-record talk about a lynching.\nNothing official, of course.\"\n\n\"Senator--\"\n\n\"Senator be hanged! We want somebody in this office who can manage to\n_do_ something.\"\n\n\"Do something! You think I'm a magician? I can just make them vanish?\nWhat do you want me to do?\"\n\nThe senator raised his eyebrows. \"You needn't shout, Mr. Heinz. I'm not\nthe least interested in _what_ you do. My interest is focused completely\non a collection of five thousand letters, telegrams, and visiphone calls\nI've received in the past three days alone. My constituents, Mr. Heinz,\nare making themselves clear. If the Grdznth do not go, I go.\"\n\n\"That would never do, of course,\" murmured Pete.\n\nThe senator gave Pete a cold, clinical look. \"Who is this person?\" he\nasked Tommy.\n\n\"An assistant on the job,\" Tommy said quickly. \"A very excellent\nPR-man.\"\n\nThe senator sniffed audibly. \"Full of ideas, no doubt.\"\n\n\"Brimming,\" said Pete. \"Enough ideas to get your constituents off your\nneck for a while, at least.\"\n\n\"Indeed.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Pete. \"Tommy, how fast can you get a PR-blast to\npenetrate? How much medium do you control?\"\n\n\"Plenty,\" Tommy gulped.\n\n\"And how fast can you sample response and analyze it?\"\n\n\"We can have prelims six hours after the PR-blast. Pete, if you have an\nidea, tell us!\"\n\nPete stood up, facing the senator. \"Everything else has been tried, but\nit seems to me one important factor has been missed. One that will take\nyour constituents by the ears.\" He looked at Tommy pityingly. \"You've\ntried to make them lovable, but they aren't lovable. They aren't even\npassably attractive. There's one thing they _are_ though, at least half\nof them.\"\n\nTommy's jaw sagged. \"Pregnant,\" he said.\n\n\"Now see here,\" said the senator. \"If you're trying to make a fool out\nof me to my face--\"\n\n\"Sit down and shut up,\" said Pete. \"If there's one thing the man in the\nstreet reveres, my friend, it's motherhood. We've got several hundred\nthousand pregnant Grdznth just waiting for all the little Grdznth to\narrive, and nobody's given them a side glance.\" He turned to Tommy. \"Get\nsome copywriters down here. Get a Grdznth obstetrician or two. We're\ngoing to put together a PR-blast that will twang the people's\nheart-strings like a billion harps.\"\n\nThe color was back in Tommy's cheeks, and the senator was forgotten as a\ndozen intercom switches began snapping. \"We'll need TV hookups, and\nplenty of newscast space,\" he said eagerly. \"Maybe a few photographs--do\nyou suppose maybe _baby_ Grdznth are lovable?\"\n\n\"They probably look like salamanders,\" said Pete. \"But tell the people\nanything you want. If we're going to get across the sanctity of Grdznth\nmotherhood, my friend, anything goes.\"\n\n\"It's genius,\" chortled Tommy. \"Sheer genius.\"\n\n\"If it sells,\" the senator added, dubiously.\n\n\"It'll sell,\" Pete said. \"The question is: for how long?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe planning revealed the mark of genius. Nothing sudden, harsh, or\ncrude--but slowly, in a radio comment here or a newspaper story there,\nthe emphasis began to shift from Grdznth in general to Grdznth as\nmothers. A Rutgers professor found his TV discussion on \"Motherhood as\nan Experience\" suddenly shifted from 6:30 Monday evening to 10:30\nSaturday night. Copy rolled by the ream from Tommy's office, refined\ncopy, hypersensitively edited copy, finding its way into the light of\nday through devious channels.\n\nThree days later a Grdznth miscarriage threatened, and was averted. It\nwas only a page 4 item, but it was a beginning.\n\nDetermined movements to expel the Grdznth faltered, trembled with\nindecision. The Grdznth were ugly, they frightened little children, they\n_were_ a trifle overbearing in their insufferable stubborn\npoliteness--but in a civilized world you just couldn't turn expectant\nmothers out in the rain.\n\nNot even expectant Grdznth mothers.\n\nBy the second week the blast was going at full tilt.\n\nIn the Public Relations Bureau building, machines worked on into the\nnight. As questionnaires came back, spot candid films and street-corner\ninterview tapes ran through the projectors on a twenty-four-hour\nschedule. Tommy Heinz grew thinner and thinner, while Pete nursed sharp\npost-prandial stomach pains.\n\n\"Why don't people _respond_?\" Tommy asked plaintively on the morning the\nthird week started. \"Haven't they got any feelings? The blast is washing\nover them like a wave and there they sit!\" He punched the private wire\nto Analysis for the fourth time that morning. He got a man with a\nhag-ridden look in his eye. \"How soon?\"\n\n\"You want yesterday's rushes?\"\n\n\"What do you think I want? Any sign of a lag?\"\n\n\"Not a hint. Last night's panel drew like a magnet. The D-Date tag you\nsuggested has them by the nose.\"\n\n\"How about the President's talk?\"\n\nThe man from Analysis grinned. \"He should be campaigning.\"\n\nTommy mopped his forehead with his shirtsleeve. \"Okay. Now listen: we\nneed a special run on all response data we have for tolerance levels.\nGot that? How soon can we have it?\"\n\nAnalysis shook his head. \"We could only make a guess with the data so\nfar.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" said Tommy. \"Make a guess.\"\n\n\"Give us three hours,\" said Analysis.\n\n\"You've got thirty minutes. Get going.\"\n\nTurning back to Pete, Tommy rubbed his hands eagerly. \"It's starting to\nsell, boy. I don't know how strong or how good, but it's starting to\nsell! With the tolerance levels to tell us how long we can expect this\nprogram to quiet things down, we can give Charlie a deadline to crack\nhis differential factor, or it's the ax for Charlie.\" He chuckled to\nhimself, and paced the room in an overflow of nervous energy. \"I can see\nit now. Open shafts instead of elevators. A quick hop to Honolulu for an\nafternoon on the beach, and back in time for supper. A hundred miles to\nthe gallon for the Sunday driver. When people begin _seeing_ what the\nGrdznth are giving us, they'll welcome them with open arms.\"\n\n\"Hmmm,\" said Pete.\n\n\"Well, why won't they? The people just didn't trust us, that was all.\nWhat does the man in the street know about transmatters? Nothing. But\ngive him one, and then try to take it away.\"\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" said Pete. \"It sounds great. Just a little bit _too_\ngreat.\"\n\nTommy blinked at him. \"Too great? Are you crazy?\"\n\n\"Not crazy. Just getting nervous.\" Pete jammed his hands into his\npockets. \"Do you realize where _we're_ standing in this thing? We're out\non a limb--way out. We're fighting for time--time for Charlie and his\ngang to crack the puzzle, time for the Grdznth girls to gestate. But\nwhat are we hearing from Charlie?\"\n\n\"Pete, Charlie can't just--\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said Pete. \"_Nothing_ is what we're hearing from\nCharlie. We've got no transmatter, no null-G, no power, nothing except a\nwhole lot of Grdznth and more coming through just as fast as they can.\nI'm beginning to wonder what the Grdznth _are_ giving us.\"\n\n\"Well, they can't gestate forever.\"\n\n\"Maybe not, but I still have a burning desire to talk to Charlie.\nSomething tells me they're going to be gestating a little too long.\"\n\nThey put through the call, but Charlie wasn't answering. \"Sorry,\" the\noperator said. \"Nobody's gotten through there for three days.\"\n\n\"Three days?\" cried Tommy. \"What's wrong? Is he dead?\"\n\n\"Couldn't be. They burned out two more machines yesterday,\" said the\noperator. \"Killed the switchboard for twenty minutes.\"\n\n\"Get him on the wire,\" Tommy said. \"That's orders.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. But first they want you in Analysis.\"\n\nAnalysis was a shambles. Paper and tape piled knee-deep on the floor.\nThe machines clattered wildly, coughing out reams of paper to be gulped\nup by other machines. In a corner office they found the Analysis man,\npale but jubilant.\n\n\"The Program,\" Tommy said. \"How's it going?\"\n\n\"You can count on the people staying happy for at least another five\nmonths.\" Analysis hesitated an instant. \"If they see some baby Grdznth\nat the end of it all.\"\n\nThere was dead silence in the room. \"Baby Grdznth,\" Tommy said finally.\n\n\"That's what I said. That's what the people are buying. That's what\nthey'd better get.\"\n\nTommy swallowed hard. \"And if it happens to be six months?\"\n\nAnalysis drew a finger across his throat.\n\nTommy and Pete looked at each other, and Tommy's hands were shaking. \"I\nthink,\" he said, \"we'd better find Charlie Karns right now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMath Section was like a tomb. The machines were silent. In the office at\nthe end of the room they found an unshaven Charlie gulping a cup of\ncoffee with a very smug-looking Grdznth. The coffee pot was floating\ngently about six feet above the desk. So were the Grdznth and Charlie.\n\n\"Charlie!\" Tommy howled. \"We've been trying to get you for hours! The\noperator--\"\n\n\"I know, I know.\" Charlie waved a hand disjointedly. \"I told her to go\naway. I told the rest of the crew to go away, too.\"\n\n\"Then you cracked the differential?\"\n\nCharlie tipped an imaginary hat toward the Grdznth. \"Spike cracked it,\"\nhe said. \"Spike is a sort of Grdznth genius.\" He tossed the coffee cup\nover his shoulder and it ricochetted in graceful slow motion against the\nfar wall. \"Now why don't you go away, too?\"\n\nTommy turned purple. \"We've got five months,\" he said hoarsely. \"Do you\nhear me? If they aren't going to have their babies in five months, we're\ndead men.\"\n\nCharlie chuckled. \"Five months, he says. We figured the babies to come\nin about three months--right, Spike? Not that it'll make much difference\nto us.\" Charlie sank slowly down to the desk. He wasn't laughing any\nmore. \"We're never going to see any Grdznth babies. It's going to be a\nlittle too cold for that. The energy factor,\" he mumbled. \"Nobody\nthought of that except in passing. Should have, though, long ago. Two\ncompletely independent universes, obviously two energy systems.\nIncompatible. We were dealing with mass, space and dimension--but the\nenergy differential was the important one.\"\n\n\"What about the energy?\"\n\n\"We're loaded with it. Super-charged. Packed to the breaking point and\nway beyond.\" Charlie scribbled frantically on the desk pad. \"Look, it\ntook energy for them to come through--immense quantities of energy.\nEvery one that came through upset the balance, distorted our whole\nenergy pattern. And they knew from the start that the differential was\nall on their side--a million of them unbalances four billion of us. All\nthey needed to overload us completely was time for enough crossings.\"\n\n\"And we gave it to them.\" Pete sat down slowly, his face green. \"Like a\nrubber ball with a dent in the side. Push in one side, the other side\npops out. And we're the other side. When?\"\n\n\"Any day now. Maybe any minute.\" Charlie spread his hands helplessly.\n\"Oh, it won't be bad at all. Spike here was telling me. Mean temperature\nin only 39 below zero, lots of good clean snow, thousands of nice jagged\nmountain peaks. A lovely place, really. Just a little too cold for\nGrdznth. They thought Earth was much nicer.\"\n\n\"For them,\" whispered Tommy.\n\n\"For them,\" Charlie said.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from \"Tiger by the Tail and Other Science\n    Fiction Stories by Alan E.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
