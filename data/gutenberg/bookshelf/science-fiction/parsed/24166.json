For a\n     way of life--good, bad, or indifferent--exists because it is dearly\n     loved...._\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIllustrated by van Dongen\n\n\n\n\nAnketam stretched his arms out as though he were trying to embrace the\nwhole world. He pushed himself up on his tiptoes, arched his back, and\ngave out with a prodigious yawn that somehow managed to express all the\ncontentment and pleasure that filled his soul. He felt a faint twinge in\nhis shoulders, and there was a dull ache in the small of his back, both\nof which reminded him that he was no longer the man he had been twenty\nyears before, but he ignored them and stretched again.\n\nHe was still strong, Anketam thought; still strong enough to do his\nday's work for The Chief without being too tired to relax and enjoy\nhimself afterwards. At forty-five, he had a good fifteen years more\nbefore he'd be retired to minor make-work jobs, doing the small chores\nas a sort of token in justification of his keep in his old age.\n\nHe settled his heels back to the ground and looked around at the fields\nof green shoots that surrounded him. That part of the job was done, at\nleast. The sun's lower edge was just barely touching the western\nhorizon, and all the seedlings were in. Anketam had kept his crew\nsweating to get them all in, but now the greenhouses were all empty and\nready for seeding in the next crop while this one grew to maturity. But\nthat could wait. By working just a little harder, for just a little\nlonger each day, he and his crew had managed to get the transplanting\ndone a good four days ahead of schedule, which meant four days of\nfishing or hunting or just plain loafing. The Chief didn't care how a\nman spent his time, so long as the work was done.\n\nHe thumbed his broad-brimmed hat back from his forehead and looked up at\nthe sky. There were a few thin clouds overhead, but there was no threat\nof rain, which was good. In this part of Xedii, the spring rains\nsometimes hit hard and washed out the transplanted seedlings before they\nhad a chance to take root properly. If rain would hold off for another\nten days, Anketam thought, then it could fall all it wanted. Meanwhile,\nthe irrigation reservoir was full to brimming, and that would supply all\nthe water the young shoots needed to keep them from being burnt by the\nsun.\n\nHe lowered his eyes again, this time to look at the next section over\ntoward the south, where Jacovik and his crew were still working. He\ncould see their bent figures outlined against the horizon, just at the\nbrow of the slope, and he grinned to himself. He had beaten Jacovik out\nagain.\n\nAnketam and Jacovik had had a friendly feud going for years, each trying\nto do a better, faster job than the other. None of the other supervisors\non The Chief's land came even close to beating out Anketam or Jacovik,\nso it was always between the two of them, which one came out on top.\nSometimes it was one, sometimes the other.\n\nAt the last harvest, Jacovik had been very pleased with himself when\nthe tallies showed that he'd beaten out Anketam by a hundred kilos of\ncut leaves. But The Chief had taken him down a good bit when the report\ncame through that Anketam's leaves had made more money because they were\nbetter quality.\n\nHe looked all around the horizon. From here, only Jacovik's section\ncould be seen, and only Jacovik's men could be seen moving.\n\nWhen Anketam's gaze touched the northern horizon, his gray eyes narrowed\na little. There was a darkness there, a faint indication of cloud\nbuild-up. He hoped it didn't mean rain. Getting the transplants in early\nwas all right, but it didn't count for anything if they were washed out.\n\nHe pushed the thought out of his mind. Rain or no rain, there was\nnothing could be done about it except put up shelters over the rows of\nplants. He'd just have to keep an eye on the northern horizon and hope\nfor the best. He didn't want to put up the shelters unless he absolutely\nhad to, because the seedlings were invariably bruised in the process and\nthat would cut the leaf yield way down. He remembered one year when\nJacovik had gotten panicky and put up his shelters, and the storm had\nbeen a gentle thing that only lasted a few minutes before it blew over.\nAnketam had held off, ready to make his men work in the rain if\nnecessary, and when the harvest had come, he'd beaten Jacovik hands\ndown.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnketam pulled his hat down again and turned to walk toward his house in\nthe little village that he and his crew called home. He had warned his\nwife to have supper ready early. \"I figure on being finished by\nsundown,\" he'd said. \"You can tell the other women I said so. But don't\nsay anything to them till after we've gone to the fields. I don't want\nthose boys thinking about the fishing they're going to do tomorrow and\nthen get behind in their work because they're daydreaming.\"\n\nThe other men were already gone; they'd headed back to the village as\nfast as they could move as soon as he'd told them the job was finished.\nOnly he had stayed to look at the fields and see them all finished, each\nshoot casting long shadows in the ruddy light of the setting sun. He'd\nwanted to stand there, all by himself feeling the glow of pride and\nsatisfaction that came over him, knowing that he was better than any\nother supervisor on The Chief's vast acreage.\n\nHis own shadow grew long ahead of him as he walked back, his steps still\nbrisk and springy, in spite of the day's hard work.\n\nThe sun had set and twilight had come by the time he reached his own\nhome. He had glanced again toward the north, and had been relieved to\nsee that the stars were visible near the horizon. The clouds couldn't be\nvery thick.\n\nOverhead, the great, glowing cloud of the Dragon Nebula shed its soft\nlight. That's what made it possible to work after sundown in the\nspring; at that time of year, the Dragon Nebula was at its brightest\nduring the early part of the evening. The tail of it didn't vanish\nbeneath the horizon until well after midnight. In the autumn, it wasn't\nvisible at all, and the nights were dark except for the stars.\n\nAnketam pushed open the door of his home and noted with satisfaction\nthat the warm smells of cooking filled the air, laving his nostrils and\npalate with fine promises. He stopped and frowned as he heard a man's\nvoice speaking in low tones in the kitchen.\n\nThen Memi's voice called out: \"Is that you, Ank?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said, walking toward the kitchen. \"It's me.\"\n\n\"We've got company,\" she said. \"Guess who.\"\n\n\"I don't claim to be much good at guessing,\" said Anketam. \"I'll have to\npeek.\"\n\nHe stopped at the door of the kitchen and grinned widely when he saw who\nthe man was. \"Russat! Well, by heaven, it's good to see you!\"\n\nThere was a moment's hesitation, then a minute or two of handshaking and\nbackslapping as the two brothers both tried to speak at the same time.\nAnketam heard himself repeating: \"Yessir! By _heaven_, it's good to see\nyou! Real good!\"\n\nAnd Russat was saying: \"Same here, Ank! And, gee, you're looking great.\nI mean, real great! Tough as ever, eh, Ank?\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure, tough as ever. Sit down, boy. Memi! Pour us something hot\nand get that bottle out of the cupboard!\"\n\nAnketam pushed his brother back towards the chair and made him sit down,\nbut Russat was protesting: \"Now, wait a minute! Now, just you hold on,\nAnk! Don't be getting out your bottle just yet. I brought some _real_\nstuff! I mean, _expensive_--stuff you can't get very easy. I brought it\njust for you, and you're going to have some of it before you say another\nword. Show him, Memi.\"\n\nMemi was standing there, beaming, holding the bottle. Her blue eyes had\nfaded slowly in the years since she and Anketam had married, but there\nwas a sparkle in them now. Anketam looked at the bottle.\n\n\"Bedamned,\" he said softly. The bottle was beautiful just as it was. It\nwas a work of art in itself, with designs cut all through it and pretty\ntracings of what looked like gold thread laced in and out of the\nsurface. And it was full to the neck with a clear, red-brown liquid.\nAnketam thought of the bottle in his own cupboard--plain, translucent\nplastic, filled with the water-white liquor rationed out from the\ncommissary--and he suddenly felt very backwards and countryish. He\nscratched thoughtfully at his beard and said: \"Well, Well. I don't know,\nRuss--I don't know. You think a plain farmer like me can take anything\nthat fancy?\"\n\nRussat laughed, a little embarrassed. \"Sure you can. You mean to say\nyou've never had brandy before? Why, down in Algia, our Chief--\" He\nstopped.\n\nAnketam didn't look at him. \"Sure, Russ; sure. I'll bet Chief Samas\ngives a drink to his secretary, too, now and then.\" He turned around and\nwinked. \"But this stuff is for brain work, not farming.\"\n\nHe knew Russat was embarrassed. The boy was nearly ten years younger\nthan Anketam, but Anketam knew that his younger brother had more brains\nand ability, as far as paper work went, than he, himself, would ever\nhave. The boy (Anketam reminded himself that he shouldn't think of\nRussat as a boy--after all, he was thirty-six now) had worked as a\nspecial secretary for one of the important chiefs in Algia for five\nyears now. Anketam noticed, without criticism, that Russat had grown\nsoft with the years. His skin was almost pink, bleached from years of\nindoor work, and looked pale and sickly, even beside Memi's sun-browned\nskin--and Memi hadn't been out in the sun as much as her husband had.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnketam reached out and took the bottle carefully from his wife's hands.\nHer eyes watched him searchingly; she had been aware of the subtleties\nof the exchange between her rough, hard-working, farmer husband and his\nyounger, brighter, better-educated brother.\n\nAnketam said: \"If this is a present, I guess I'd better open it.\" He\npeeled off the seal, then carefully removed the glass stopper and\nsniffed at the open mouth of the beautiful bottle. \"Hm-m-m! Say!\" Then\nhe set the bottle down carefully on the table. \"You're the guest, Russ,\nso you can pour. That tea ready yet, Memi?\"\n\n\"Coming right up,\" said his wife gratefully. \"Coming right up.\"\n\nAnketam watched Russat carefully pour brandy into the cups of hot, spicy\ntea that Memi set before them. Then he looked up, grinned at his wife,\nand said: \"Pour yourself a cup, honey. This is an occasion. A big\noccasion.\"\n\nShe nodded quickly, very pleased, and went over to get another cup.\n\n\"What brings you up here, Russ?\" Anketam asked. \"I hope you didn't just\ndecide to pick up a bottle of your Chief's brandy and then take off.\" He\nchuckled after he said it, but he was more serious than he let on. He\nactually worried about Russat at times. The boy might just take it in\nhis head to do something silly.\n\nRussat laughed and shook his head. \"No, no. I'm not crazy, and I'm not\nstupid--at least, I think not. No; I got to go up to Chromdin. My Chief\nis sending word that he's ready to supply goods for the war.\"\n\nAnketam frowned. He'd heard that there might be war, of course. There\nhad been all kinds of rumors about how some of the Chiefs were all for\nfighting, but Anketam didn't pay much attention to these rumors. In the\nfirst place, he knew that it was none of his business; in the second\nplace, he didn't think there would be any war. Why should anyone pick on\nXedii?\n\nWhat war would mean if it did come, Anketam had no idea, but he didn't\nthink the Chiefs would get into a war they couldn't finish. And, he\nrepeated to himself, he didn't believe there would be a war.\n\nHe said as much to Russat.\n\nHis brother looked up at him in surprise. \"You mean you haven't heard?\"\n\n\"Heard what?\"\n\n\"Why, the war's already started. Sure. Five, six days ago. We're at war,\nAnk.\"\n\nAnketam's frown grew deeper. He knew that there were other planets\nbesides Xedii; he had heard that some of the stars in the sky were\nplanets and suns. He didn't really understand how that could be, but\neven The Chief had said it was true, so Anketam accepted it as he did\nthe truth about God. It was so, and that was enough for Anketam. Why\nshould he bother himself with other people's business?\n\nBut--_war_?\n\nWhy?\n\n\"How'd it happen?\" he asked.\n\nRussat sipped at his hot drink before answering. Behind him, Memi moved\nslowly around the cooker, pretending to be finishing the meal,\npretending not to be listening.\n\n\"Well, I don't have all the information,\" Russat said, pinching his\nlittle short beard between thumb and forefinger. \"But I do know that the\nChiefs didn't want the embassy in Chromdin.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Anketam. \"I suppose not.\"\n\n\"I understand they have been making all kinds of threats,\" Russat said.\n\"Trying to tell everybody what to do. They think they run all of\nCreation, I guess. Anyway, they were told to pull out right after the\nlast harvest. They refused to do it, and for a while nobody did\nanything. Then, last week, the President ordered the Army to throw 'em\nout--bag and baggage. There was some fighting, I understand, but they\ngot out finally. Now they've said they're going to smash us.\" He\ngrinned.\n\nAnketam said: \"What's so funny?\"\n\n\"Oh, they won't do anything,\" said Russat. \"They fume and fuss a lot,\nbut they won't do anything.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" said Anketam. He finished the last of his spiked tea, and\nMemi poured him another one. \"I don't see how they have any right to\ntell us how to live or how to run our own homes. They ought to mind\ntheir own business and leave us alone.\"\n\n\"You two finish those drinks,\" said Memi, \"and quit talking about wars.\nThe food will be ready pretty quickly.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Anketam. \"I'm starved.\" And, he admitted to himself, the\nbrandy and hot tea had gone to his head. A good meal would make him feel\nbetter.\n\nRussat said: \"I don't get much of a chance to eat Memi's cooking; I'll\nsure like this meal.\"\n\n\"You can stay for breakfast in the morning, can't you?\" Anketam asked.\n\n\"Oh, I wouldn't want to put you to all that trouble. I have to be up to\nyour Chief's house before sunrise.\"\n\n\"We get up before sunrise,\" Anketam said flatly. \"You can stay for\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\nII\n\nThe spring planting did well. The rains didn't come until after the\nseedlings had taken root and anchored themselves well into the soil, and\nthe rows showed no signs of heavy bruising. Anketam had been watching\none section in particular, where young Basom had planted. Basom had a\ntendency to do a sloppy job, and if it had showed up as bruised or\npoorly planted seedlings, Anketam would have seen to it that Basom got\nwhat was coming to him.\n\nBut the section looked as good as anyone else's, so Anketam said nothing\nto Basom.\n\nRussat had come back after twenty days and reported that there was an\nawful lot of fuss in Chromdin, but nothing was really developing. Then\nhe had gone on back home.\n\nAs spring became summer, Anketam pushed the war out of his mind.\nEvidently, there wasn't going to be any real shooting. Except that two\nof The Chief's sons had gone off to join the Army, things remained the\nsame as always. Life went on as it had.\n\nThe summer was hot and almost windless. Work became all but impossible,\nexcept during the early morning and late afternoon. Fortunately, there\nwasn't much that had to be done. At this stage of their growth, the\nplants pretty much took care of themselves.\n\nAnketam spent most of his time fishing. He and Jacovik and some of the\nothers would go down to the river and sit under the shade trees, out of\nthe sun, and dangle their lines in the water. It really didn't matter if\nthey caught much or not; the purpose of fishing was to loaf and get away\nfrom the heat, not to catch fish. Even so, they always managed to bring\nhome enough for a good meal at the end of the day.\n\nThe day that the war intruded on Anketam's consciousness again had\nstarted off just like any other day. Anketam got his fishing gear\ntogether, including a lunch that Memi had packed for him, and gone over\nto pick up Blejjo.\n\nBlejjo was the oldest man in the village. Some said he was over a\nhundred, but Blejjo himself only admitted to eighty. He'd been retired a\nlong time back, and his only duties now were little odd jobs that were\neasy enough, even for an old man. Not that there was anything feeble\nabout old Blejjo; he still looked and acted spry enough.\n\nHe was sitting on his front porch, talking to young Basom, when Anketam\ncame up.\n\nThe old man grinned. \"Hello, Ank. You figure on getting a few more fish\ntoday?\"\n\n\"Why not? The river's full of 'em. Come along.\"\n\n\"Don't see why not,\" said Blejjo. \"What do you think, Basom?\"\n\nThe younger man smiled and shook his head. \"I'll stay around home, I\nthink. I'm too lazy today to go to all that effort.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Too lazy to loaf,\" said Blejjo, laughing. \"That's as lazy as I ever\nheard.\"\n\nAnketam smiled, but he didn't say anything. Basom _was_ lazy, but\nAnketam never mentioned it unless the boy didn't get his work done.\nLeave that sort of kidding up to the others; it wasn't good for a\nsupervisor to ride his men unless it was necessary for discipline.\n\nBasom was a powerful young man, tall and well-proportioned. If the truth\nwere known, he probably had the ability to get a good job from The\nChief--become a secretary or something, like Russat. But he was sloppy\nin his work, and, as Blejjo had said, lazy. His saving grace was the\nfact that he took things as they came; he never showed any resentment\ntowards Anketam if he was rebuked for not doing his work well, and he\nhonestly tried to do better--for a while, at least.\n\n\"Not too lazy to loaf,\" Basom said in self-defense. \"Just too lazy to\nwalk four miles to loaf when I can do it here.\"\n\nOld Blejjo was taking his fishing gear down from the rack on the porch.\nWithout looking around, he said: \"Cooler down by the river.\"\n\n\"By the time I walked there,\" said Basom philosophically, \"walking\nthrough all that sun, I'd be so hot it would take me two hours to cool\ndown to where I am now, and another two hours to cool down any more.\nThat's four hours wasted. Now--\" He looked at Anketam with a sly grin.\n\"Now, if you two wanted to carry me, I'd be much obliged. Anketam, you\ncould carry me piggyback, while Blejjo goes over to fetch my pole. If\nyou'd do that, I believe I could see my way clear to going fishing with\nyou.\"\n\nAnketam shook his head positively. \"I'm afraid the sun would do you in,\nanyway.\"\n\n\"Maybe you'd like The Chief to carry you,\" said Blejjo. There was a bite\nin his voice.\n\n\"Now, wait,\" Basom said apprehensively, \"I didn't say anything like\nthat. I didn't mean it that way.\"\n\nBlejjo pointed his fishing pole at the youth. \"You ought to be thankful\nyou've got Anketam for a supervisor. There's some supers who'd boot you\ngood for a crack like that.\"\n\nBasom cast appealing eyes at Anketam. \"I _am_ thankful! You know I am!\nWhy, you're the best super in the barony! Everybody knows that. I was\nonly kidding. You know that.\"\n\nBefore Anketam could say anything, the old man said: \"You can bet your\nlife that no other super in this barony would put up with your\nlaziness!\"\n\n\"Now, Blejjo,\" said Anketam, \"leave the boy alone. He meant no harm. If\nhe needs talking to, I'll do the talking.\"\n\nBasom looked gratefully reprieved.\n\n\"Sorry, Ank,\" said Blejjo. \"It's just that some of these young people\nhave no respect for their elders.\" He looked at Basom and smiled.\n\"Didn't mean to take it out on you, Bas. There's a lot worse than you.\"\nThen, changing his tone: \"Sure you don't want to come with us?\"\n\nBasom looked apologetic, but he stuck to his guns. \"No. Thanks again,\nbut--\" He grinned self-consciously. \"To be honest, I was thinking of\ngoing over to see Zillia. Her dad said I could come.\"\n\nAnketam grinned at the boy. \"Well, now, that's an excuse I'll accept.\nCome on, Blejjo, this is not a sport for old men like us. Fishing is\nmore our speed.\"\n\nChuckling, Blejjo shouldered his fishing pole, and the two men started\ndown the dusty village street toward the road that led to the river.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey walked in silence for a while, trying to ignore the glaring sun\nthat brought the sweat out on their skins, soaking the sweatbands of\ntheir broad-brimmed hats and running in little rivulets down their\nbodies.\n\n\"I kind of feel sorry for that boy,\" old Blejjo said at last.\n\n\"Oh?\" said Anketam. \"How so? He'll get along. He's improving. Why, he\ndid as good a job of transplanting as any man this spring. Last year, he\nbruised the seedlings, but I gave him a good dressing down and he\nremembered it. He'll be all right.\"\n\n\"I'm not talking about that, Ank,\" said the old man, \"I mean him and\nZillia. He's really got a case on with that girl.\"\n\n\"Anything wrong with that? A young fellow's got a right to fall in love,\nhasn't he? And Zillia seems pretty keen on him, too. If her father\ndoesn't object, everything ought to go along pretty smoothly.\"\n\n\"Her father might not object,\" said Blejjo, looking down at his feet as\nthey paced off the dusty road. \"But there's others who might object.\"\n\n\"Who, for instance?\"\n\nBlejjo was silent for several steps. Then he said: \"Well, Kevenoe, for\none.\"\n\nAnketam thought that over in silence. Kevenoe was on The Chief's staff\nat the castle. Like many staff men--including, Anketam thought wryly,\nhis own brother Russat, on occasion--he tended to lord it over the\nfarmers who worked the land. \"Kevenoe has an eye on Zillia?\" he asked\nafter a moment.\n\n\"I understand he's asked Chief Samas for her as soon as she's eighteen.\nThat would be this fall, after harvest.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Anketam said thoughtfully. He didn't ask how the old man had\ncome about his knowledge. Old Blejjo had little to do, and on the\noccasions that he had to do some work around The Chief's castle, he made\nit a point to pick up gossip. But he was careful with his information;\nhe didn't go spreading it around for all to hear, and he made it a point\nto verify his information before he passed it on. Anketam respected the\nold man. He was the only one in the village who called him \"Ank,\"\noutside of Memi.\n\n\"Do you think The Chief will give her to Kevenoe?\" he asked.\n\nBlejjo nodded. \"Looks like it. He thinks a great deal of Kevenoe.\"\n\n\"No reason why he shouldn't,\" said Anketam. \"Kevenoe's a good man.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know that,\" said the old man. \"But Basom won't like it at all.\nAnd I don't think Zillia will, either.\"\n\n\"That's the way things happen,\" said Anketam. \"A man can't expect to go\nthrough life having everything his own way. There's other girls around\nfor Basom. If he can't have the prettiest, he'll have to be satisfied\nwith someone else.\" He chuckled. \"That's why I picked Memi. She's not\nbeautiful and never was, but she's a wonderful wife.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" said Blejjo. \"A wise man is one who only wants what he\nknows he can have. Right now\"--he took off his hat and wiped his bald\nhead--\"all I want is a dip in that river.\"\n\n\"Swim first and then fish?\"\n\n\"I think so, don't you? Basom was right about this hot sun.\"\n\n\"I'll go along with you,\" agreed Anketam.\n\nThey made their way to the river, to the shallow place at the bend where\neveryone swam. There were a dozen and more kids there, having a great\ntime in the slow moving water, and several of the older people soaking\nthemselves and keeping an eye on the kids to make sure they didn't\nwander out to where the water was deep and the current swift.\n\nAnketam and Blejjo took off their clothes and cooled themselves in the\nwater for a good half hour before they dressed again and went on upriver\nto a spot where Blejjo swore the fish were biting.\n\nThey were. In the next four hours, the two men had caught six fish\napiece, and Blejjo was trying for his seventh. Here, near the river,\nthere was a slight breeze, and it was fairly cool beneath the\noverhanging branches of the closely bunched trees.\n\nBlejjo had spotted a big, red-and-yellow striped beauty loafing quietly\nin a back eddy, and he was lowering his hook gently to a point just in\nfront of the fish when both men heard the voice calling.\n\n\"Anketam! Anketam! Blejjo! Where you at?\"\n\nBlejjo went on with his careful work, knowing that Anketam would take\ncare of whatever it was.\n\nAnketam recognized the voice. He stood up and called: \"Over here, Basom!\nWhat's the trouble?\"\n\nA minute later, Basom came running through the trees, his feet crashing\nthrough the underbrush.\n\nBlejjo sat up abruptly, an angry look on his face. \"Basom, you scared my\nfish away.\"\n\n\"Fish, nothing,\" said Basom. \"I ran all the way here to tell you!\" He\nwas grinning widely and panting for breath at the same time.\n\n\"You suddenly got an awful lot of energy,\" Blejjo said sourly.\n\n\"What happened?\" Anketam asked.\n\n\"The invasion!\" Basom said between breaths. \"Kevenoe himself came down\nto tell us! They've started the invasion! The war's on!\"\n\n\"Than what are you looking so happy about?\" Anketam snapped.\n\n\"That's what I came to tell you.\" Basom's grin didn't fade in the least.\n\"They landed up in the Frozen Country, where our missiles couldn't get\n'em, according to Kevenoe. Then they started marching down on one of the\nbig towns. Tens of thousands of 'em! And we whipped 'em! Our army cut\n'em to pieces and sent 'em running back to their base! We won! We\n_won_!\"\n\n\nIII\n\nThe battle had been won, but the war wasn't won yet. The invaders had\nmanaged to establish a good-sized base up in the Frozen Country. They'd\nsneaked their ships in and had put up a defensive system that stopped\nany high-speed missiles. Not that Xedii had many missiles. Xedii was an\nagricultural planet; most manufactured articles were imported. It had\nnever occurred to the government of Xedii that there would be any real\nneed for implements of war.\n\nThe invaders seemed to be limiting their use of weapons, too. They\nwanted to control the planet, not destroy it. Through the summer and\ninto the autumn, Anketam listened to the news as it filtered down from\nthe battlegrounds. There were skirmishes here and there, but nothing\ndecisive. Xedii seemed to be holding her own against the invaders.\n\nAfter the first news of the big victory, things settled back pretty much\nto normal.\n\nThe harvest was good that year, but after the leaves were shredded and\ndried, they went into storage warehouses. The invaders had set up a\npatrol system around Xedii which prevented the slow cargo ships from\ntaking off or landing. A few adventurous space officers managed to get a\nship out now and then, but those few flights could hardly be called\nregular trade shipments.\n\nThe cool of winter had come when Chief Samas did something he had never\ndone before. He called all the men in the barony to assemble before the\nmain gate of the castle enclosure. He had a speech to make.\n\nFor the first time, Anketam felt a touch of apprehension. He got his\ncrew together, and they walked to the castle in silence, wondering what\nit was that The Chief had to say.\n\nAll the men of the barony, except those who couldn't be spared from\ntheir jobs, were assembled in front of Chief Samas' baronial castle.\n\nThe castle itself was not a single building. Inside the four-foot-high\nthorn hedge that surrounded the two-acre area, there were a dozen\nbuildings of hard, irridescent plastic shining in the sun. They all\nlooked soft and pleasant and comfortable. Even the thorn hedge, filled\nas it was by the lacy leaves that concealed the hard, sharp thorns,\nlooked soft and inviting.\n\nAnketam listened to the soft murmur of whispered conversation from the\nmen around him. They stood quietly outside the main gate that led into\nthe castle area, waiting for The Chief to appear, and wondering among\nthemselves what it was that The Chief had to say.\n\n\"You think the invaders have won?\"\n\nAnketam recognized the hoarse whisper from the man behind him. He turned\nto face the dark, squat, hard-looking man who had spoken. \"It couldn't\nbe, Jacovik. It couldn't be.\"\n\nThe other supervisor looked down at his big, knuckle-scarred hands\ninstead of looking at Anketam. He was not a handsome man, Jacovik; his\ngreat, beaklike nose was canted to one side from a break that had come\nin his teens; his left eye was squinted almost closed by the scar tissue\nthat surrounded it, and the right only looked better by comparison. His\neyebrows, his beard, and the fringe of hair that outlined his bald head\nmade an incongruous pale yellow pattern against the sunburnt darkness of\nhis face. In his youth, Jacovik had been almost pathologically devoted\nto boxing--even to the point of picking fights with others in his\nvillage for no reason at all, except to fight. Twice, he had been\nbrought up before The Chief's court because of the severe beating he had\ngiven to men bigger than he, and he had finally killed a man with his\nfists.\n\nChief Samas had given him Special Punishment for that, and a final\nwarning that the next fight would be punished by death.\n\nAnketam didn't know whether it was that threat, or the emotional\nreaction Jacovik had suffered from killing a man, or simply that he had\nhad some sense beaten into his head, but from that moment on Jacovik was\na different man. He had changed from a thug into a determined, ambitious\nman. In twenty-two years, he had not used his fists except to discipline\none of his crew, and that had only happened four times that Anketam knew\nof. Jacovik had shown that he had ability as well as strength, that he\ncould control men by words as well as by force, and The Chief had made\nhim a supervisor. He had proved himself worthy of the job; next to\nAnketam, he was the best supervisor in the barony.\n\nAnketam had a great deal of respect for the little, wide-shouldered,\nbarrel-chested man who stood there looking at the scars on the backs of\nhis hands.\n\nJacovik turned his hands over and looked at the calloused palms. \"How do\nwe know? Maybe the Council of Chiefs has given up. Maybe they've\nauthorized the President to surrender. After all, we're not fighters;\nwe're farmers. The invaders outnumber us. They've got us cut off by a\nblockade, to keep us from sending out the harvest. They've got machines\nand weapons.\" He looked up suddenly, his bright blue eyes looking\nstraight into Anketam's. \"How do we know?\"\n\nAnketam's grin was hard. \"Look, Jac; the invaders have said that they\nintend to smash our whole society, haven't they? Haven't they?\"\n\nJacovik nodded.\n\n\"And they want to break up the baronies--take everything away from the\nChiefs--force us farmers to give up the security we've worked all our\nlives for. That's what they've said, isn't it?\"\n\nJacovik nodded again.\n\n\"Well, then,\" Anketam continued remorselessly, \"do you think the Chiefs\nwould give up easily? Are they going to simply smile and shake hands\nwith the invaders and say: 'Go ahead, take all our property, reduce us\nto poverty, smash the whole civilization we've built up, destroy the\nsecurity and peace of mind of millions of human beings, and then send\nyour troops in to rule us by martial law.' Are they going to do that?\nAre they?\"\n\nJacovik spread his big, hard hands. \"I don't know. I'm not a Chief. I\ndon't know how their minds work. Do you? Maybe they'll think surrender\nwould be better than having all of Xedii destroyed inch by inch.\"\n\nAnketam shook his head. \"Never. The Chiefs will fight to the very end.\nAnd they'll win in the long run because right is on their side. The\ninvaders have no right to change our way of living; they have no right\nto impose their way of doing things on us. No, Jac--the Chiefs will\nnever give up. They haven't surrendered yet, and they never will.\nThey'll win. The invaders will be destroyed.\"\n\nJacovik frowned, completely closing his left eye. \"You've always been\nbetter at thinking things out that I, Ank.\" He paused and looked down at\nhis hands again. \"I hope you're right, Ank. I hope you're right.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn spite of his personal conviction that he was right, Anketam had to\nadmit that Jacovik had reason for his own opinion. He knew that many of\nthe farmers were uncertain about the ultimate outcome of the war.\n\nAnketam looked around him at the several hundred men who made up the\nfarming force of the barony. His own crew were standing nearby, mixing\nwith Jacovik's crew and talking in low voices. In the cool winter air,\nAnketam could still detect the aroma of human bodies, the smell of sweat\nthat always arose when a crowd of people were grouped closely together.\nAnd he thought he could detect a faint scent of fear and apprehension in\nthat atmosphere.\n\nOr was that just his imagination, brought on by Jacovik's pessimism?\n\nHe opened his lips to say something to Jacovik, but his words died\nunborn. The sudden silence in the throng around him, the abrupt\ncessation of whispering, told him, more definitely than a chorus of\ntrumpets could have done, that The Chief had appeared.\n\nHe turned around quickly, to face the Main Gate again.\n\nThe Main Gate was no higher than the thorn-bush hedge that it pierced.\nIt was a heavily built, intricately decorated piece of polished\ngoldwood, four feet high and eight feet across, set in a sturdy goldwood\nframe. The arch above the gate reached a good ten feet, giving The Chief\nplenty of room to stand.\n\nHe was just climbing up to stand on the gate itself as Anketam turned.\n\nChief Samas was a tall man, lean of face and wide of brow. His\nsmooth-shaven chin was long and angular, and his dark eyes were deeply\nimbedded beneath heavy, bushy eyebrows.\n\nAnd he was dressed in clothing cut in a manner that Anketam had never\nseen before.\n\nHe stood there, tall and proud, a half smile on his face. It was several\nseconds before he spoke. During that time, there was no sound from the\nassembled farmers.\n\n\"Men,\" he said at last, \"I think that none of you have seen this uniform\nbefore. I look odd in it, do I not?\"\n\nThe men recognized The Chief's remark as a joke, and a ripple of\nlaughter ran through the crowd.\n\nThe Chief's smile broadened. \"Odd indeed. Yes. And do you perceive the\ngolden emblems, here at my throat? They, and the uniform, indicate that\nI have been chosen to help lead the armed forces--a portion of them, I\nshould say.\"\n\nHe smiled around at the men. \"The Council of Chiefs has authorized the\nPresident to appoint me a Colonel of Light Tank. I am expected to lead\nour armored forces into battle against the damned Invaders.\"\n\nA cheer came from the farmers, loud and long. Anketam found himself\nyelling as loud as anyone. The pronunciation and the idiom of the speech\nof the Chiefs was subtly different from those of the farmers, but\nAnketam could recognize the emphasis that his Chief was putting on the\nwords of his speech. \"Invaders.\" With a capital \"I.\"\n\nThe Chief held up his hands, and the cheering died. At the same time,\nthe face of Chief Samas lost its smile.\n\n\"I will be gone for some time,\" he said somberly. \"The Council feels\nthat it will be two or three years before we have finally driven the\nInvaders from our planet. This will not be a simple war, nor an easy\none. The blockade of orbital ships which encircle Xedii keep us from\nmaking proper contact with any friends that we may have outside the\ncircle of influence of the damned Invaders. We are, at the moment,\nfighting alone. And yet, in spite of that--in _spite_ of that, I say--we\nhave thus far held the enemy at a standstill. And, in the long run, we\nshall win.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath then, and his baritone voice thundered out when he\nspoke.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"_Shall_ win? No! We _must_ win! None of you want to become slaves in\nthe factories of the Invaders. I know that, and you know it. Who among\nyou would slave your life away in the sweatshops of the Invaders,\nknowing that those for whom you worked might, at any time, simply\ndeprive you of your livelihood at their own whim, since they feel no\nsense of responsibility toward you as individuals?\"\n\nAgain The Chief stopped, and his eyes sought out each man in turn.\n\n\"If there are any such among you, I renounce you at this moment. If\nthere are any such, I ask ... nay, I plead ... I _order_ ... I order you\nto go immediately to the Invaders.\"\n\nAnother deep breath. No one moved.\n\n\"You have all heard the propaganda of the Invaders. You know that they\nhave offered you--well, what? Freedom? Yes, that's the way they term it.\nFreedom.\" Another pause. \"Freedom. _Hah!_\"\n\nHe put his hands on his hips. \"None of you have ever seen a really\nregimented society--and I'm thankful that you haven't. I hope that you\nnever will.\"\n\nChief Samas twisted his lips into an expression of hatred. \"Freedom?\nFreedom from _what_! Freedom to _do_ what?\n\n\"I'll tell you. Freedom to work in their factories for twelve hours a\nday! Freedom to work until you are no longer of any use to them, and\nthen be turned out to die--with no home, and no food to support you.\nFreedom to live by yourselves, with every man's hand against you, with\nevery pittance that you earn taxed to support a government that has no\nthought for the individual!\n\n\"Is that what you want? Is that what you've worked for all your lives?\"\n\nA visual chorus of shaken heads accompanied the verbal chorus of \"No.\"\n\nChief Samas dropped his hands to his sides. \"I thought not. But I will\nrepeat: If any of you want to go to the Invaders, you may do so now.\"\n\nAnketam noticed a faint movement to his right, but it stopped before it\nbecame decisive. He glanced over, and he noticed that young Basom was\nstanding there, half poised, as though unable to make up his mind.\n\nThen The Chief's voice bellowed out again. \"Very well. You are with me.\nI will leave the work of the barony in your hands. I ask that you\nproduce as much as you can. Next year--next spring--we will not plant\n_cataca_.\"\n\nThere was a low intake of breath from the assembled men. Not plant\n_cataca_? That was the crop that they had grown since--well, since\n_ever_. Anketam felt as though someone had jerked a rug from beneath\nhim.\n\n\"There is a reason for this,\" The Chief went on. \"Because of the\nblockade that surrounds Xedii, we are unable to export _cataca_ leaves.\nThe rest of the galaxy will have to do without the drug that is\nextracted from the leaves. The incident of cancer will rise to the level\nit reached before the discovery of _cataca_. When they understand that\nwe cannot ship out because of the Invader's blockade, they will force\nthe Invader to stop his attack on us. What we need now is not _cataca_,\nbut food. So, next spring, you will plant food crops.\n\n\"Save aside the _cataca_ seed until the war is over. The seedlings now\nin the greenhouses will have to be destroyed, but that cannot be\nhelped.\"\n\nHe stopped for a moment, and when he began again his voice took on a\nnote of sadness.\n\n\"I will be away from you until the war is won. While I am gone, the\nbarony will be run by my wife. You will obey her as you would me. The\nfinances of the barony will be taken care of by my trusted man,\nKevenoe.\" He gestured to one side, and Kevenoe, who was standing there,\nsmiled quickly and then looked grim again.\n\n\"As for the actual running of the barony--as far as labor is\nconcerned--I think I can leave that in the hands of one of my most\ncapable men.\"\n\nHe raised his finger and pointed. There was a smile on his face.\n\nAnketam felt as though he had been struck an actual blow; the finger was\npointed directly at him.\n\n\"Anketam,\" said The Chief, \"I'm leaving the barony in your hands until I\nreturn. You will supervise the labor of all the men here. Is that\nunderstood?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Anketam weakly. \"Yes, sir. I understand.\"\n\n\nIV\n\nNever, for the rest of his life, would the sharp outlines of that moment\nfade from his memory. He knew that the men of the barony were all\nlooking at him; he knew that The Chief went on talking afterwards. But\nthose things impressed themselves but lightly on his mind, and they\nblurred soon afterwards. Twenty years later, in retelling the story, he\nwould swear that The Chief had ended his speech at that point. He would\nswear that it was only seconds later that The Chief had jumped down from\nthe gate and motioned for him to come over; his memory simply didn't\nregister anything between those two points.\n\nBut The Chief's words after the speech--the words spoken to him\nprivately--were bright and clear in his mind.\n\nThe Chief was a good three inches shorter than Anketam, but Anketam\nnever noticed that. He just stood there in front of The Chief, wondering\nwhat more his Chief had to say.\n\n\"You've shown yourself to be a good farmer, Anketam,\" Chief Samas said\nin a low voice. \"Let's see--you're of Skebbin stock, I think?\"\n\nAnketam nodded. \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"The Skebbin family has always produced good men. You're a credit to the\nSkebbins, Anketam.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"You've got a hard job ahead of you,\" said The Chief. \"Don't fail me.\nPlant plenty of staple crops, make sure there's enough food for\neveryone. If you think it's profitable, add more to the animal stock.\nI've authorized Kevenoe to allow money for the purchase of breeding\nstock. You can draw whatever you need for that purpose.\n\n\"This war shouldn't last too long. Another year, at the very most, and\nwe'll have forced the Invaders off Xedii. When I come back, I expect to\nfind the barony in good shape, d'you hear?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. It will be.\"\n\n\"I think it will,\" said The Chief. \"Good luck to you, Anketam.\"\n\nAs The Chief turned away, Anketam said: \"Thank you, sir--and good luck\nto you, sir.\"\n\nChief Samas turned back again. \"By the way,\" he said, \"there's one more\nthing. I know that men don't always agree on everything. If there is any\ndispute between you and Kevenoe, submit the question to my wife for\narbitration.\" He hesitated. \"However, I trust that there will not be\nmany such disputes. A woman shouldn't be bothered with such things any\nmore than is absolutely necessary. It upsets them. Understand?\"\n\nAnketam nodded. \"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well. Good-by, Anketam. I hope to see you again before the next\nharvest.\" And with that, he turned and walked through the gate, toward\nthe woman who was standing anxiously on the porch of his home.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnketam turned away and started towards his own village. Most of the\nothers had already begun the trek back. But Jacovik, Blejjo, and Basom\nwere waiting for him. They fell into step beside him.\n\nAfter a while, Jacovik broke the silence. \"Well, Ank, it looks like\nyou've got a big job on your hands.\"\n\n\"That's for sure,\" said Anketam. He knew that Jacovik envied him the\njob; he knew that Jacovik had only missed the appointment by a narrow\nmargin.\n\n\"Jac,\" he said, \"have you got a man on your crew that you can trust to\ntake over your job?\"\n\n\"Madders could do it, I think,\" Jacovik said cautiously. \"Why?\"\n\n\"This is too big a job for one man,\" said Anketam quietly. \"I'll need\nhelp. I want you to help me, Jac.\"\n\nThere was a long silence while the men walked six paces. Then Jacovik\nsaid: \"I'll do whatever I can, Ank. Whatever I can.\" There was honest\nwarmth in his voice.\n\nAgain there was a silence.\n\n\"Blejjo,\" Anketam said after a time, \"do you mind coming out of\nretirement for a while?\"\n\n\"Not if you need me, Ank,\" said the old man.\n\n\"It won't be hard work,\" Anketam said. \"I just want you to take care of\nthe village when I'm not there. Settle arguments, assign the village\nwork, give out punishment if necessary--things like that. As far as the\nvillage is concerned, you'll be supervisor.\"\n\n\"What about the field work, Ank?\" Blejjo asked. \"I'm too old to handle\nthat. Come spring, and--\"\n\n\"I said, as far as the village is concerned,\" Anketam said. \"I've got\nanother man in mind for the field work.\"\n\nAnd no one was more surprised than Basom when Anketam said: \"Basom, do\nyou think you could handle the crew in the field?\"\n\nBasom couldn't even find his tongue for several more paces. When he\ndiscovered at last that it was still in his mouth, where he'd left it,\nhe said: \"I ... I'll try, Ank. I sure will try, if you want me to. But\n... well ... I mean, why pick _me_?\"\n\nOld Blejjo chuckled knowingly. Jacovik, who hardly knew the boy, just\nlooked puzzled.\n\n\"Why not you?\" Anketam countered.\n\n\"Well ... you've always said I was lazy. And I am, I guess.\"\n\n\"Sure you are,\" said Anketam. \"So am I. Always have been. But a smart\nlazy man can figure out things that a hard worker might overlook. He can\nfind the easy, fast way to get a job done properly. And he doesn't\noverwork his men because he knows that when he's tired, the others are,\ntoo. You want to try it, Basom?\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" said Basom earnestly. \"I'll try real hard.\" Then, after a\nmoment's hesitation. \"Just one thing, Anketam--\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Kevenoe. I don't want him coming around me. Not at all. If he ever said\none word to me, I'd probably break his neck right there.\"\n\nAnketam nodded. The Chief had given Zillia to Kevenoe only two months\nbefore, and the only one who liked the situation was Kevenoe himself.\n\n\"I'll deal with Kevenoe, Basom,\" Anketam said. \"Don't you worry about\nthat.\"\n\n\"All right, then,\" Basom said. \"I'll do my best, Anketam.\"\n\n\"You'd better,\" said Anketam. \"If you don't, I'll just have to give the\njob to someone else. You hear?\"\n\n\"I hear,\" said Basom.\n\n\nV\n\nThe war dragged on. In the spring of the following year, over a hundred\nthousand Invader troops landed on the seacoast a hundred miles from\nChromdin and began a march on the capital. But somebody had forgotten to\ntell the Invader general that it rained in that area in the spring and\nthat the mud was like glue. The Invader army bogged down, and,\nfloundering their way toward Chromdin, they found themselves opposed by\nan army of nearly a hundred thousand Xedii troops under General Jojon,\nand the invasion came to a standstill at that point.\n\nFarther to the west, another group of forty thousand Invader troops came\ndown from the Frozen Country, and a Xedii general named Oljek trounced\nthem with a mere seventeen thousand men.\n\nAll in all, the Invaders were getting nowhere, but they seemed\ndetermined to keep on plugging.\n\nThe news only filtered slowly into the areas which were situated well\naway from the front. A thousand miles to the west of Chief Samas'\nbarony, the Invaders began cutting deeply into Xedii territory, but they\nwere nowhere near the capital, so no one was really worried.\n\nAnketam worked hard at keeping the barony going during the absence of\nThe Chief. Instead of _cataca_, he and Jacovik planted food crops,\ndoing on a larger scale just what they had always done in the selected\nsections around the villages. They had always grown their own food, and\nnow they were doing it on a grand scale.\n\nNo news came from off-planet, except for unreliable rumors. What the\nrest of the galaxy was doing about the war on Xedii, no one knew.\n\nYoung Basom proved to be a reasonably competent supervisor. He was\nnowhere near as good as Anketam or Jacovik, but there were worse supers\nin the barony.\n\nAnketam found that the biggest worry was not in the handling of the\nfarmers, but in obtaining manufactured goods. The staff physician\ncomplained to Kevenoe that drugs were getting scarce. Shoes and clothing\nwere almost impossible to obtain. Rumor had it that arms and ammunition\nwere running short in the Xedii armies. For two centuries, Xedii had\ndepended on other planets to provide manufactured goods for her, and now\nthose supplies were cut off, except for a miserably slow trickle that\ncame in via the daring space officers who managed to evade the orbital\nforts that the Invaders had set up around the planet.\n\nEven so, Anketam's faith in the power of Xedii remained constant. The\ninvading armies were still being held off from Chromdin, weren't they?\nThe capital would not fall, of that he was sure.\n\nWhat Anketam did not and could not know was the fact that the Invaders\nwere growing tired of pussy-footing around. Instead of fighting Xedii on\nXedii's terms, the Invaders decided to fight it on their own.\n\nEveryone on Chief Samas' barony and the others around it expected\ntrouble to come from the north, from the Frozen Country, if and when it\ncame. They didn't look to the west, where the real trouble was brewing.\n\nAnketam was shocked when he heard the news that the Invaders had reached\nTana L'At, having cut down through the center of the continent, dividing\nthe inhabited part of Xedii into two almost equal parts. They knocked\nout Tana L'At with a heavy shelling of paralysis gas, evacuated the\ninhabitants, and dusted the city with radioactive powder to make it\nuninhabitable for several years.\n\nThen they began to march eastward.\n\n\nVI\n\nFor the first time in his life, Anketam was feeling genuine fear. He had\nfeared for his life before, yes. And he had feared for his family. But\nnow he feared for his world, which was vaster by far.\n\nHe blinked at the tall, gangling Kevenoe, who was still out of breath\nfrom running. \"Say that again.\"\n\n\"I said that the Invader troops are crossing Benner Creek,\" Kevenoe said\nangrily. \"They'll be at the castle within an hour. We've got to do\nsomething.\"\n\n\"What?\" Anketam asked dazedly.\n\n\"Fight them? With what? We have no weapons.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Kevenoe admitted. \"I just don't know. I thought maybe\nyou'd know. Maybe you could think of something. What about Lady Samas?\"\n\n\"What about her?\" Anketam still couldn't force his mind to function.\n\n\"Haven't you heard? The Invaders have been looting and burning every\ncastle in their path! And the women--\"\n\nLady Samas in danger! Something crystallized in Anketam's mind. He\npointed in the direction of the castle. \"Get back there!\" he snapped.\n\"Get everyone out of the castle! Save all the valuables you can! Get\neveryone down to the river and tell them to hide in the brush at the Big\nSwamp. The Invaders won't go there. Move!\"\n\nKevenoe didn't even pause to answer. He ran back toward the saddle\nanimal he had tethered at the edge of the village.\n\nAnketam was running in the opposite direction, toward Basom's quarters.\n\nHe didn't bother to knock. He flung open the door and yelled, \"_Basom_!\"\n\nBasom, who had been relaxing on his bed, leaped to his feet. \"What is\nit?\"\n\nAnketam told him rapidly. Then he said: \"Get moving! You're a fast\nrunner. Spread the news. Tell everyone to get to the Swamp. We have less\nthan an hour, so run for all you're worth!\"\n\nBasom, like Kevenoe, didn't bother to ask questions. He went outside and\nstarted running toward the south.\n\n\"That's right!\" Anketam called after him. \"Tell Jacovik first! And get\nmore runners to spread the word!\"\n\nAnd then Anketam headed for his own home. Memi had to be told. On the\nway, he pounded on the doors of the houses, shouting the news and\ntelling the others to get to the Big Swamp.\n\nBy the time the Invader troops came, they found the entire Samas barony\nempty. Not a single soul opposed their march; there was no voice to\nobject when they leveled their beam projectors and melted the castle and\nthe villages into shapeless masses of blackened plastic.\n\n\nVII\n\nThe wooden shelter wasn't much of a home, but it was all Anketam could\nprovide. It had been difficult to cut down the trees and make a shack of\nthem, but at least there were four walls and a roof.\n\nAnketam stood at the door of the rude hut, looking blindly at the ruins\nof the village a hundred yards away. In the past few months, weeds had\ngrown up around the charred blobs that had once been the homes of\nAnketam's crew. Anketam stared, not at, but past and through them,\nseeing the ghosts of the houses that had once been there.\n\nBehind him, Memi was speaking in soft tones to Lady Samas.\n\n\"Now you go ahead and eat, Lady. You can't starve yourself to death.\nThings won't always be this bad, you'll see. When that oldest boy of\nyours comes back, he'll fix the barony right back up like it was. Just\nyou see. Now, here; try some of this soup.\"\n\nLady Samas said nothing. She seemed to be entirely oblivious of her\nsurroundings these days. Nothing mattered to her any more. Word had come\nback that Chief Samas had accompanied General Eeler in the fatal\nexpedition towards the Invader base, and The Chief had been buried there\nin the Frozen Country.\n\nLady Samas had nowhere else to stay. Kevenoe was dead, his skull crushed\nby--by someone. Anketam refused, in his own mind, to see any connection\nbetween Kevenoe's death and the fact that Basom and Zillia had\ndisappeared the same day, probably to give themselves over to the\nInvader troops.\n\nA movement at the corner of his eye caught Anketam's attention. He\nturned his head to look. Then he spun on his heel and went into the hut.\n\n\"Lady Samas,\" he said quickly, \"they're coming. There's a ground-car\ncoming down the road with four Invaders in it.\"\n\nLady Samas looked up at him, her fine old face calm and emotionless.\n\"Let them come,\" she said. \"We can't stop them, Anketam. And we have\nnothing to lose.\"\n\nThree minutes later, the ground-car pulled up in front of the hut.\nAnketam watched silently as one of the men got out. The other three\nstayed in the car, their handguns ready.\n\nThe officer, very tall and straight in his blue uniform, strode up to\nthe door of the hut. He stopped and addressed Anketam. \"I understand\nLady Samas is living here.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Anketam said.\n\n\"Would you tell her that Colonel Fayder would like to speak to her.\"\n\nBefore Anketam could say anything, Lady Samas spoke. \"Tell the colonel\nto come in, Anketam.\"\n\nAnketam stepped aside to let the officer enter.\n\n\"Lady Samas?\" he asked.\n\nShe nodded. \"I am.\"\n\nThe colonel removed his hat. \"Madam, I am Colonel Jamik Fayder, of the\nUnion army. You are the owner of this land?\"\n\n\"Until my son returns, yes,\" said Lady Samas evenly.\n\n\"I understand.\" The colonel licked his lips nervously. He was obviously\nill at ease in the presence of the Lady Samas. \"Madam,\" he said, \"it\nwould be useless for me to apologize for the destructions of war.\nApologies are mere words.\"\n\n\"They are,\" said Lady Samas. \"None the less, I accept them.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I have come to inform you that the Xedii armies formally\nsurrendered near Chromdin early this morning. The war is over.\"\n\n\"I'm glad,\" said Lady Samas.\n\n\"So am I,\" said the colonel. \"It has not been a pleasant war. Xedii\nwas--and still is--the most backward planet in the galaxy. Your Council\nof Chiefs steadfastly refused to allow the\"--he glanced at\nAnketam--\"workers of Xedii to govern their own lives. They have lived\nand died without proper education, without the medical care that would\nsave and lengthen their lives, and without the comforts of life that any\nhuman being deserves. That situation will be changed now, but I am\nheartily sorry it took a war to do it.\"\n\nAnketam looked at the man. What was he talking about? He and his kind\nhad burned and dusted cities and villages, and had smashed the lives of\nmillions of human beings on the pretense that they were trying to help.\nWhat sort of insanity was that?\n\nThe colonel took a sheaf of papers from his pocket.\n\n\"I have been ordered to read to you the proclamation of the Union\nPresident.\"\n\nHe looked down at the papers and began to read:\n\n\"Henceforth, all the peoples of Xedii shall be free and equal. They\nshall have the right to change their work at will, to be paid in lawful\nmoney instead of--\"\n\nAnketam just stood there, his mind glazed. He had worked hard all his\nlife for the security of retirement, and now all that was gone. What was\nhe to do? Where was he to go? If he had to be paid in money, who would\ndo it? Lady Samas? She had nothing. Besides, Anketam knew nothing about\nthe handling of money. He knew nothing about how to get along in a\nsociety like that.\n\nHe stood there in silence as his world dissolved around him. He could\nhear, dimly, the voice of the blue-clad Union officer as he read off the\ndeath warrant for Xedii. And for Anketam.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Destroyers, by Gordon Randall Garrett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE DESTROYERS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 24166.txt or 24166.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/1/6/24166/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Geetu Melwani, Bruce Albrecht and\nthe Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
