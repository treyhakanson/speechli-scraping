With their\nacquisition it becomes the most powerful nation on earth. The Ziegler\nplans are at present in the Arvanian Embassy, but they will be smuggled\nout of the country soon. Within a month of their landing in Arvania, war\nwill be declared against us. That means\"--he glanced at the tense faces\naround the conference table--\"that we have about three months to live as\na nation--unless we can get those plans!\"\n\nThere was a hushed, appalled silence, broken at last by General Forsyte.\n\n\"Nonsense! How can a postage-stamp country like Arvania really threaten\nus?\"\n\n\"The day has passed, General,\" said the Secretary, \"when a nation's\npower is reckoned by its size. The Ziegler heat ray is the deadliest\nweapon yet invented. A thousand men with a dozen of the ray-projectors\ncan reduce us to smoking ruins while remaining far outside the range of\nour guns. No! I tell you that declaration of war by Arvania will be\nfollowed by the downfall of the United States inside of three months!\"\n\nAgain the hushed, strained silence descended over the conference table,\nwhile one white-faced man gazed at another and all speculated on the\nincredible possibility of a world in which there was no United States of\nAmerica.\n\n\"We must get the plans,\" nodded Forsyte, convinced at last. \"But how?\nMarch openly on the Arvanian Embassy?\"\n\n\"No, that would be declaration of war on _our_ part. The World Court,\nwhich knows nothing of the Ziegler plans, would set the League at our\nthroats.\"\n\n\"Send volunteers unofficially to raid the place?\"\n\n\"Impossible. There is a heavy guard in the Arvanian Embassy; and I more\nthan suspect the place bristles with machine guns.\"\n\n\"What _are_ we to do?\" demanded Forsyte.\n\nThe Secretary seemed to have been waiting for that final question.\n\n\"I have had an odd and desperate plan submitted me from an outside\nsource. I could not pass it without your approval. I will let you hear\nit from the lips of the planner.\"\n\nHe pressed a buzzer. \"Bring Mr. Winter in,\" he told his secretary.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man who presently appeared in the doorway was an arresting figure. A\nman of thirty-odd with the body of an athlete, belied somewhat by the\npallor of an indoor worker, with acid stained, delicate hands offset by\nforearms that might have belonged to a blacksmith, with coal black hair\nand gray eyes so light as to look like ice-gray holes in the deep\ncaverns of his eye-sockets. This was Thorn Winter.\n\n\"Gentlemen, the scientist, Mr. Winter,\" announced the Secretary. \"He\nthinks he can get the Ziegler plans.\"\n\nThorn Winter cleared his throat. \"My scheme is simple enough,\" he said\ntersely. \"I believe I can walk right into the Embassy, get the\nplans--and then walk right out again. It sounds kind of impossible, but\nI think I can work it by making myself invisible.\"\n\n\"Invisible?\" echoed Forsyte. \"Invisible!\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" said Thorn in a matter-of-fact tone. \"I have just turned\nout a camouflage which is the most perfect yet discovered. It was\ndesigned for application to guns and equipment only. I'd never thought\nof trying to cover a human body with it, but I am sure it can be done.\"\n\n\"But ... invisible ...\" muttered Forsyte, glancing askance at Winter.\n\n\"There's no time for argument,\" said the Secretary crisply. \"The\nquestion is, shall we give this man permission to try the apparently\nimpossible?\"\n\nAll heads nodded, though in all eyes was doubt. The Secretary turned to\nthe scientist.\n\n\"You are aware of the risk you run? You realize that if you are caught,\nwe cannot recognize you--that we must disclaim official knowledge of\nyour work, and leave you to your fate?\"\n\nThorn nodded.\n\n\"Then,\" said the Secretary, his voice vibrant, \"yours is the mission.\nAnd on your effort hangs the fate of your country. Now--what help will\nyou require?\"\n\n\"Only the assistance of one man,\" said Thorn. \"And, since secrecy is\nvital, I'm going to ask you, sir, to be that man.\"\n\nThe Secretary smiled; and with that smile he seemed to be transformed\nfrom a great leader of affairs into a kindly, human individual. \"I am\nhonored, Mr. Winter,\" he said. \"Shall we go at once to your laboratory?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the great laboratory room, the Secretary glanced about almost\nuneasily at the crowding apparatus that was such an enigma to one\nuntrained in science. Then his gaze returned to Winter's activities.\n\nThorn was carefully stirring fluids, poured drop by drop from various\nretorts, in a mixing bowl. All the fluids were colorless; and they\ncombined in a mixture that had approximately the consistency of thin\nsyrup. To this, Thorn added a carefully weighted pinch of glittering\npowder. Then he lit a burner under the bowl, and thrust into the mixture\na tiny, specially constructed thermometer.\n\n\"You can really make yourself invisible?\" breathed the Secretary.\n\n\"I can,\" said Thorn, \"if the blisters don't upset my calculations by\nmaking my body surfaces too moist for this stuff to stick to. I'm going\nto have you paint me with it, you see, and it was never intended to\ncover flesh.\"\n\nHe regulated the burner anxiously, and then began to take off his\nclothes.\n\n\"Ready,\" he said at last, glancing at the thermometer and turning off\nthe burner. He stood before the wondering Secretary, a fine, muscular\nfigure. \"Take this brush and cover me with the stuff. And be sure not to\nmiss any of me!\"\n\nAnd then the Secretary saw why Thorn had said the colorless paint was\nnever intended to be applied to human flesh. For it was still seething\nand smoking in the cauldron.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" he said. \"Don't you want to wait till it cools a\nlittle?\"\n\n\"Can't,\" said Thorn. \"It has to be applied hot or it loses its\nflexibility.\"\n\nThe Secretary dipped the brush and began to paint the naked flesh of the\nscientist. Not a quiver touched that flesh as an almost microscopically\nthin, colorless layer formed into a film after the brush strokes. But\nthe Secretary's fingers shook a little.\n\n\"My God, man!\" he said finally. \"Doesn't it hurt?\"\n\n\"It's a little like being boiled in oil,\" replied Thorn grimly. \"Outside\nof that it's all right. Hurry, before the stuff gets too cool.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe clinging thin shell covered him to his chest, then to his throat. At\nthat point he reached into a drawer in a workbench beside him and drew\nout two small, hollow hemispheres of glass. These he cupped over his\neyes.\n\n\"What are those for?\" asked the Secretary.\n\n\"So my eyes can be covered with the film. If they weren't, I'd present\nthe somewhat remarkable spectacle of a pair of disembodied eyes walking\ndown the street.\"\n\nPainfully, agonizingly, the hot film was applied to throat and face;\nover the glass spheres that cupped around the eyes; over a tight leather\ncap covering the scientist's hair; and over a sort of football\nnose-guard which extended down an inch below the end of Thorn's nose in\na sort of overhanging offset that would allow him to breathe and still\nkeep his nostrils hidden. The Secretary stepped back.\n\nBefore him stood a figure that looked not unlike a glazed statue of a\nman. The effect was that of a body encased in clear ice--and like clear\nice, the encasing shell sparkled and glittered radiantly in the sunlight\nthat poured in at the windows.\n\nThorn moved. His glazed arms and legs and torso glistened with all the\ncolors in the spectrum; while under the filmed bulges of glass his eyes\nlooked as large as apples. The Secretary felt a chill of superstitious\nfear as he gazed at that weird and glittering figure with its enormous\nglazed eyes.\n\n\"But you aren't invisible,\" he said at length.\n\n\"That comes now,\" said Thorn, walking ahead of the Secretary while on\nthe ceiling above him danced red and yellow and blue rainbows of\nrefracted light.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stepped onto a big metal plate. Suspended above was a huge metal\nring, with its hole directly over the spot on which he stood.\n\n\"Soft magnets,\" explained Thorn. \"As simply as I can put it, my process\nfor rendering an object invisible is this: I place the object, coated\nwith the film, on this plate. Then I start in motion the overhead ring,\ncreating an immensely powerful, rapidly rotating magnetic field. The\nrotating field rearranges the atoms of this peculiarly susceptible film\nof mine so that they will transmit light rays with the least possible\nresistance. It combs the atoms into straight lines, you might say. With\nthat straight-line, least-resistance arrangement comes invisibility.\"\n\n\"I don't quite see--\" began the Secretary.\n\n\"Refraction of light,\" said Thorn hurriedly. \"The light rays strike this\nfilm, hurtle around the object, it coats--at increased speed, probably,\nbut there are no instruments accurate enough to check that--and emerge\non the other side. Thus, you can look at a body so filmed, and not see\nit: your gaze travels _around_ it and rests on objects in a straight\nline behind it. But you'll see for yourself in a moment. Pull that\nswitch, there, will you? And leave it on for two full minutes after you\nhave ceased to see me.\"\n\nStraight and tall, a figure encased in shimmering crystal, the scientist\nstood on the metal plate. Hesitant, with the superstitious dread growing\nin his heart, the Secretary stood with his hand on the switch. That hand\npulled the switch down....\n\nSoundlessly the overhead metal ring began to whirl, gathering speed with\nevery second. And then, though he had known in advance something of what\nwas coming, the Secretary could not suppress a shout of surprise.\n\nThe man before him on the metal plate was vanishing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSlowly he disappeared from view--slowly, as an object sinking deeper and\ndeeper into clear water disappears. Now the face was but a white blob.\nNow the entire body was but a misty blur. And now a shade, a wavering\nshadow, alone marked Winter's presence.\n\nThe Secretary could not have told the exact instant when that last faint\nblur oozed from sight. He only knew that at one second he was gazing at\nit--and at the next second his eyes rested on a rack of test-tubes on\nthe wall beyond the plate.\n\nHe looked at his watch. Sweat glistened in tiny points on the hand that\nheld the switch. It was all so like death, this disappearance--as if he\nhad thrown the switch that electrocuted a man.\n\nThe specified two minutes passed. He cut off the power. The great ring\nlost speed, stopped whirling. And on the plate was--nothing.\n\nAt least it seemed there was nothing. But a moment later a deep voice\nsounded out: \"I guess I'm invisible, all right, according to the\nexpression on your face.\"\n\n\"You are,\" said the Secretary, mopping his forehead, \"except when you\nspeak. Then I have the bizarre experience of seeing glimpses of teeth,\ntongue and throat hanging in mid-air. I'd never have believed it if I\nhadn't witnessed it myself! That paint of yours is miraculous!\"\n\n\"A little complicated, but hardly miraculous. It has a cellulose base,\nand there is in it a small per cent of powdered crystal--but the rest\nI'll keep locked in my brain alone till my country has need of it.\"\n\nThe glimpses of teeth and tongue and throat ceased. In spite of himself,\nthe Secretary started as an unseen hand touched his shoulder.\n\n\"Now,\"--there was ringing resolution in the deep voice--\"for the\nArvanian Embassy. Please drive me there--and be as quick as you can\nabout it. I can't last very long with this film sealing most of the\npores of my body.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Secretary started for the laboratory door. Beside him sounded the\npatter of bare feet. He opened the door and walked into the hallway.\nBehind him, apparently of itself, the door clicked shut; and the\nfootsteps again sounded beside him.\n\nThe Secretary walked to the curb where his limousine waited. His\nchauffeur jumped out and opened the door. The Secretary paused a moment,\none foot on the running board, to draw a cigar from his pocket and light\nit. During that moment the car pressed down on that side, and as\nsuddenly rocked back up again.\n\nThe chauffeur stared wide-eyed at his employer.\n\n\"Did you do that, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\"Do what?\" said the Secretary.\n\n\"Push down on the running board with your foot.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said the Secretary, his eyebrows raising. \"You could\nhave seen my leg move if I had. But why do you ask?\"\n\n\"It felt like somebody got into this car,\" mumbled the man.\n\n\"Did you see anybody get in?\" said the Secretary with a shrug. And,\nshaking his head, with a fuddled look in his eyes, the chauffeur turned\naway and got into the driver's seat.\n\nThe Secretary glanced at the rear seat. On the far side, the cushion was\nheavily depressed. He sat on the near side, feeling his knee strike\nanother, unseen knee.\n\n\"Drive to the Bulgarian Embassy,\" he told his man.\n\nUp Sixteenth Street the car swung, past the various embassies which\nlooked more like palatial private villas than offices of foreign\nnations. Toward the end of the line, a smaller building than most of the\nothers, was the Arvanian Embassy. Next to it was the Bulgarian.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe car stopped in front of the Bulgarian Embassy, and the Secretary got\nout. Again he paused, while the chauffeur held the door open, to hold a\nmatch to his cigar. Again the car sagged down on that side, and slowly\nswayed up again.\n\n\"Hey--\" said the chauffeur. But meeting the Secretary's calmly inquiring\ngaze, he stopped. Scratching his head, he went back to the wheel, while\nthe Secretary walked toward the building entrance.\n\nBehind him, moving on soundless bare feet along the sidewalk, Thorn\nWinter hastened, cloaked in invisibility, toward the Arvanian\nEmbassy--and the plans that spelled America's destruction if they\nremained in Arvanian hands.\n\nThe embassy building was a three-storied oblong house of white stone\ntopping a terrace that started its climb from the sidewalk of Sixteenth\nStreet. The doors at the head of the wide stone staircase were of\nbronze; and they were closed, and, Thorn surmised, efficiently barred.\nThe windows at front and sides were also closed, in spite of the warmth\nof the sunny spring afternoon.\n\nBeside the building, leading up in a short steep hill, was the driveway.\nUp this Thorn started. The front of the house was hopelessly barred; but\nat the rear entrance there might be a chance.\n\nUp the driveway, then, he walked, a little startled at the fact that he\ncast no shadow--feeling as a ghost might feel. The pavement was hot to\nhis thinly filmed feet. A little dubious as to the effect of heat on the\nvital shell that hid him, he stepped off into the cool grass beside the\ndrive; and came soon to the rear of the embassy.\n\nThere was no porch or veranda, simply two stone steps leading up to a\nstout oak door which opened onto the embassy kitchens. From behind this\ndoor came the sound of crockery and the hum of voices. The Arvanian chef\nevidently was preparing afternoon tea.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWalking boldly to the very steps, Thorn began the vigil that should end\nwhen someone came in or out of that door, allowing him to slip inside\nthe building before the portal was barred shut again.\n\nFor nearly half an hour Thorn stood there before something happened that\nat once helped him, and, at the same time, nearly proved his undoing.\n\nA light delivery van sped up the driveway. The wheels stirred up a cloud\nof dust. It was a very small cloud of very fine dust. Thorn at first\nthought nothing of it, because he was so engrossed in the conviction\nthat here ought to be provided an entrance into the house.\n\nThe truck driver got out, took a crate from the body of the van, and\nwent with it to the back door. After a moment of waiting, the door\nopened. Thorn noticed that it was opened very cautiously, only an inch\nor so. He caught a glimpse of a heavy chain stretched across the inch\nopening, and saw a strip of bearded, resolute face.\n\nThe door was unchained. The driver walked in, while the door stood open.\nThorn started to glide in after him....\n\nMere chance made him glance at a window near the door. This window\nframed another bearded, resolute face. And the eyes in that face were\nlike saucers as they stared full at Thorn!\n\nFor an instant Thorn knew icy fear. His invisibility! Had something\nhappened to strip him of that concealing mantle? But what _could_ have\nhappened?\n\nHe glanced down at himself and saw the reason for the guard's\nsaucer-eyed expression.\n\nA little of the light cloud of dust stirred up by the truck wheels had\nsettled over him and clung to the encasing shell. As he moved, these\ndust specks moved. The effect to the staring guard, Thorn realized, must\nbe that of seeing a queer, fine dust column moving eccentrically over a\ngrassy lawn where no dust column had any business to be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nQuickly Thorn moved toward the garage, with the eyes of the amazed guard\nfollowing him. The scientist was savage at the delay; but it was vital\nthat he rid himself of that clinging dust.\n\nBehind the garage he broke off a feathery spray from a vine, and stroked\nit lightly over himself. That, too, presented a curious spectacle: a\nleafy branch suddenly detaching itself from the parent vine and dancing\nhere and there in mid-air.\n\nWhen the all-important task was done, Thorn raced back to the rear\ndoorway. By great good luck it was still open. He stole in, just making\nit as the truck driver, staggering under a load of empty crates, came up\nthe cellar stairs and went out to his truck.\n\nThorn drew a deep breath. He was inside the Arvanian Embassy. The place\nwas a three-storied stone trap in which, if the slightest slip revealed\nhim to its tenants, he would surely meet his death. But, anyway, he was\ninside! And the threatening Ziegler plans waited somewhere near at hand\nfor him to find and take!\n\nEven had Thorn not known in advance that trouble was brewing, he could\nhave surmised that something sinister was being hatched in the Arvanian\nEmbassy. For, in this big sunny kitchen five men lounged about in\naddition to the white-coated chef and his beardless stripling of an\nassistant. And each of the five had a holster strapped openly over his\ncoat with the butt of an automatic protruding in plain sight.\n\nThorn looked about. Across from the great range, beside which he was\nstanding and holding his breath for fear some one of the seven men\nshould become aware of his presence, was the door leading to the front\npart of the house. He started toward that door, walking on tiptoe. A\nshudder crept up his spine as he tiptoed across the floor directly in\nfront of the armed guards who would have shot him down without\ncompunction could they have seen him. He was not yet used to his\ninvisibility; knowing himself to be substantial, feeling his feet\ndescend solidly on the floor, he still could hardly credit the fact that\nhuman eyes could not observe him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe got to the door. He put out his hand to open it, then realized just\nin time that he could not do that. A door stealthily opening and closing\nagain, with no apparent hand to manipulate it? Such a spectacle would\nstart a riot!\n\nIn a frenzy of impatience, he stood beside the door, waiting till\nsomeone else should swing it open. And in a moment it chanced that the\nstripling assistant chef came toward him with a tray. The boy pushed the\nswinging door with his foot, and walked into the butler's pantry. After\nhim, treading almost on the lad's heels, came Thorn.\n\nThe boy sat the tray down, and turned to reach into an upper shelf. The\nspace in the pantry was constricted, and he turned abruptly. The result\nwas that he suddenly drew back as though a hot iron had seared him, and\nwent white as chalk. Then he dashed back into the kitchen.\n\n\"A hand!\" Thorn heard him gibbering in Arvanian. \"A hand! I touched it\nwith mine! Something horrible is in there!\"\n\nWith his heart pounding in his throat, Thorn leaned close to the\nswing-door to hear what happened next. Would there be a rush for the\nbutler's pantry? An investigation? He eyed the farther door--the dining\nroom door. But he dared not flee through that save as a last resort. In\nthe dining room sounded voices; and again the sight of a door opening\nand closing of itself would lead to uproar.\n\n\"A hand?\" he heard one of the guards say in the kitchen. \"An unseen\nhand? Thou art empty in the head, young Gova.\"\n\nThere followed some jeering sentences in colloquial Arvanian that were\ntoo idiomatic for Thorn's knowledge of the language to let him\nunderstand. A general guffaw came from the rest; and, as no move was\nmade toward the pantry, Thorn decided he was saved for another few\nmoments.\n\nGasping, he raised his hand to wipe the perspiration off his forehead,\nthen realized there was no perspiration there. His film-clogged pores\ncould exude nothing; he had only the sensation of perspiring.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow the problem was to get through the next door. Thoughtfully, Thorn\ngazed at it. He saw that this, too, was a swing-door. Further, he saw\nthat now and then it creaked open a few inches, and swung sluggishly\nback. Beyond it somewhere a window was open, and spasmodic gusts moved\nthe swinging slab of wood.\n\nThe next time the door moved with the wind, Thorn caught it and\naugmented the movement a bit. Twice he did that, each time swinging it\nback a trifle further. Next time, he figured, he could open it enough to\nslide into the room.\n\nTwo glimpses he had had, with the openings of the door, into the room\nbeyond. These glimpses had showed him a great oval table on which was\nset the debris of afternoon tea, and around which were grouped tense,\neager men. Dark of hair and complexion were these men, with the arrogant\nhawk noses and ruthless small eyes of the typical Arvanian. Several of\nthem were garbed in military uniforms and armed with swords. They were\ntalking in tones too low for Thorn to distinguish words through the film\nover his ears. He would have to get in there to hear them.\n\nFor the third time the wind pushed at the door. For the third time Thorn\ncaught its edge and swung it--six inches, eight, almost enough to slip\nthrough....\n\n\"Shut thou the window!\" crackled a voice suddenly. \"Fool! What if some\nof these documents blew away?\"\n\nThere was a slam, and the breeze was cut off. Thorn quickly let go of\nthe door, and watched it fall back in place again.\n\nHe was cursing his luck when he heard the same commanding voice say:\n\"Kori, see if there be one who listens in the butler's pantry. It seemed\nthe door opened wider than the wind would warrant.\"\n\nThere was the scrape of a chair. Then the door was abruptly thrust open\nand coldly alert eyes in a hostile, wary face, swept over the pantry.\n\n\"No one here, Excellency,\" said Kori; and he returned to his place at\nthe table.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut with him came another, unseen, to stand against the wall beside a\ngreat mahogany buffet, and to listen and watch. Kori had, not\nunnaturally, held the door open while he glanced around the pantry. And\nunder Kori's outstretched arm, so close as almost to brush against his\nuniformed legs, had stolen Thorn.\n\n\"Then, gentlemen, it is all arranged?\" said the man at the head of the\noval table--a spare, elderly individual with bristling gray mustachios\nand smoldering dark eyes. \"The plans leave for Arvania to-morrow night,\nto arrive in our capital city in ten days. Then day and night\nmanufacture of the Ziegler projectors--and declaration of war. Following\nthat, this great city of Washington, and the even greater cities of New\nYork and Chicago, and all, this fine land from Atlantic to Pacific,\nshall become an Arvanian possession to exploit as we like!\"\n\nThere was an audible \"Ah!\" from the score of men around the\ntable--broken by a voice in the main double doorway of the dining room:\n\"Gentlemen, your pardon, I am late.\"\n\nThorn looked at the speaker. He was a young fellow with an especially\nelaborate uniform and a face that appeared weak and dissipated in spite\nof the arrogant Arvanian nose. Then a bark came to Thorn's ears--and a\ncold feeling to the pit of Thorn's stomach. The newcomer had brought a\ndog with him!\n\nEven as he gazed apprehensively at the dog--a rangy wolfhound--the brute\ngrowled deep in its throat and stared at the corner by the buffet where\nThorn was instinctively trying to make himself smaller.\n\nThe dog growled again, and stalked warily toward the buffet.\n\n\"Grego, down,\" said his master absently. Then, to the spare man at the\nhead of the table: \"I have been next door, talking to the American\nSecretary of War. A dull fellow. Convinced, is he, that Arvania harbors\nonly kind thoughts for this great stupid nation. They shall be utterly\nunprepared for our attack--Grego! What ails the brute?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe wolfhound had evaded several outstretched hands and got to the\nbuffet. There it crouched and cowered, fangs showing in a snarl, eyes\nreddening wickedly, while the growl rattled louder in its shaggy throat.\n\n\"Perhaps the heat has affected him,\" said one.\n\nAll were looking at the dog now, marveling at its odd behavior. But of\nall the eyes that observed it a pair of unseen eyes watched with the\nutmost agitation.\n\nThorn stared, almost hypnotized, at the creature. A dog! What rotten\nluck! Men might be fooled by the masking invisibility, but there was no\ndeceiving a dog's keen nose!\n\nThe wolfhound started forward as though to leap, then settled back.\nPlainly it longed to spring. Equally plainly it was afraid of the being\nthat so impossibly was revealed to its nostrils but not to its eyes.\nMeanwhile, one tearing sweep of blunt claws or sharp fangs--and a fatal\nrent would appear in Thorn's encasing shell!\n\nThe dog snapped tentatively. Thorn flattened still harder against the\nwall, with discovery and death hovering very closely about him. Then the\nbeast's master intervened.\n\n\"Grego! Here, sir! A council room is no place, for thee, anyway. Here, I\nsay! So, then--\"\n\nHe hastened to the dog and caught its collar. Twisting the leather\ncruelly, he dragged the protesting, snarling brute to the doors and slid\nthem shut with the wolfhound barking and growling on the outside.\n\"Someone put him in his kennel,\" he said through the panels. A scuffling\nin the hall told of the execution of the order. The council room became\nquiet again, and Thorn leaned against the wall and closed his eyes for\nan instant.\n\n\"We were saying, Soyo,\" the leader addressed the dog's owner, \"that the\nZiegler plans start for Arvania to-morrow night. All is arranged. These\ninnocent looking bits of paper\"--he thumped a small packet of documents\nlying before him--\"shall deliver mighty America to us!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA subdued cheer answered the man's words--while Thorn stared at the\npacket of papers with unbelieving eyes. It had never occurred to him\nthat the Ziegler plans might be in that very room, on the table with the\nrest of the welter of letters, thumbed documents, and cups and saucers.\nAnd there they were--the vital projector plans--not in a safe or hidden\nin some fantastic place, but right before his eyes!\n\nInvoluntarily his hand extended eagerly toward the packet, then was\nwithdrawn. Not now. _He_ was invisible--but the papers, if he grasped\nthem, would not be. Clenched in his unseen hand, they would be perfectly\nvisible, moving in jerks and starts as he raced for the door.\n\nLike lightning his mind turned over one plan after another for making\naway with that precious packet. Each scheme seemed impossible of\nfulfilment.\n\n\"The biggest difficulty is in getting them out of the country,\" the\nspare, elderly man was saying. \"But we have solved that. Solved it\nsimply. I myself shall bear them, sewn in my clothes, to our native\nland. The American authorities could search, on some pretext, any other\nof our number who tried to smuggle them out. But _me_ they dare not lay\na finger on. That would be an overt act.\"\n\nThorn's thoughts whirled desperately on. Wait till later and follow\nwhoever left the room with the plans? But he hated to let them get out\nof his sight.\n\nAnd at this point he became suddenly aware that the man named Kori was\ngazing fixedly at him.\n\nThorn was between the section of the table where Kori sat, and the\nangular buffet-end. Kori could not possibly see anything but the shining\nmahogany, thought Thorn. And yet the man's eyes were narrowing to\nominous slits as he started in his direction.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThorn held his breath. Was the shielding film changing in structure?\nWere the repolarized atoms slowly losing their straight-line\narrangement, allowing light rays to penetrate through to his body\ninstead of diverting them to form a pocket of invisibility around him?\nThe film had never acted like that before--but never before had Thorn\napplied it to living flesh with its disintegrating heat and moisture.\n\n\"Excellency,\" said Kori at last, a hard edge to his voice, \"look thou at\nthat buffet. No, no--the end nearest my chair.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said the elderly man. \"I see nothing.\"\n\nThorn breathed a sigh of relief. But the relief was to be of short\nduration.\n\n\"Come to my place, if thou wilt, and see from here,\" said Kori.\n\nThe leader got up and came to Kori's place. Kori pointed straight at\nThorn.\n\n\"There--seest thou anything out of the ordinary?\"\n\n\"I see nothing,\" said the leader, after a moment. \"Thine eyes, Kori, are\nnot good.\"\n\n\"They are the eyes of a hawk,\" said Kori stubbornly. \"And they see\nthis--the vertical line of the end of that buffet does not continue\nstraightly up and down. At its middle, the line is broken, then\ncontinues up--a fraction of an inch to the side! Like an object seen\nunder water, distorted by the sun-rays that strike the surface!\"\n\nThorn fairly jumped away from the buffet and stood against bare wall.\nFool! Of course the light refraction would not be perfect! Why hadn't he\nthought of that--thought to stand clear of revealing vertical lines!\n\n\"There, it is gone,\" said Kori, blinking. \"But something, Excellency,\nmade that distortion of line. And something made Soyo's wolfhound act as\nit did! Something--\"\n\n\"Art thou attempting to say a spy listens unseen in this room?\" demanded\nthe gray-mustachioed Arvanian.\n\n\"Something is odd--that is all I say.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll eyes were ranging along the wall against which Thorn leaned his\nback. All eyes finally turned to Kori. \"It is nonsense.\" \"I see nothing\nwhatever.\" \"Kori has drunk of champagne in place of tea!\" were some of\nthe exclamations.\n\nAnd then occurred the thing that, in Thorn's perilous position, was like\nthe self-signing of his own death warrant.\n\nHe sneezed.\n\nThat agony of helplessness, as a man's nose wrinkles and twitches\nand--in spite of the most desperate attempts at repression--the\nbetraying sound forces its way out! How many men have lost their lives\nbecause of that insistent soft nasal explosion which can be smothered,\nbut not entirely hushed!\n\nThorn had felt the sneeze coming on for seconds. He had fought it\nfrantically, with life itself at stake. But he could not hold it back.\nIn his naked body, beginning to burn with fever from the long-clogged\npores and insulated not at all by the film from the coolness of the\nroom, the seeds of that soft explosion had been planted--and they\n_would_ bear fruit!\n\nSo he had sneezed!\n\nInstantly there was chaos. Men looked at each other, and back at the\nblank wall from which had come the painfully muffled sound. Then all\nsprang to their feet.\n\n\"Champagne, is it!\" Kori exulted savagely. \"Did I not say my eyes were\nthose of a hawk?\"\n\n\"Double guard all doors!\" roared the Arvanian leader, to the guards\noutside. \"Someone is in the house! And you in here,\" he went on in a\nlower tone, \"see that this unseen one dies!\"\n\nSoyo and several other men whipped out automatics and pointed them at\nthe wall. Thorn dropped to the floor. But with his quick action came\nKori's voice.\n\n\"No, no! The sword, gentlemen. It is not so noisy, and covers a wider\nsweep.\"\n\nThorn shivered. Far rather would he have had bullets as his lot than\ncold steel. The prospect of being hacked to pieces, of gradually\nemerging from invisibility as a lump of gashed and bleeding flesh,\nturned him faint.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Arvanians split up into orderly formation. Two went to guard the\ndoor to the butler's pantry, and two to cover the closed sliding doors\nto the outer hall. Six, with drawn swords sweeping back and forth before\nthem, walked slowly toward the wall from which the sneeze had come.\n\nThorn set his jaws--only just catching himself in time to prevent his\nlips from opening in the half-snarl instinctive to the most civilized of\nmen when danger is threatening. That lip motion would have revealed his\nteeth for an instant!\n\nThe sensation of perspiring heavily flamed over him again. There were so\nmany trifling things to keep in mind! And each, if neglected, meaning\ncertain death!\n\nThe nearest of the marching six stopped with his foot almost touching\nThorn's hand. The dancing sword the man carried almost grazed the\nscientist's shoulder on its down sweep.\n\nThorn could not stay there. Lying flat along the baseboard, he would be\nstabbed at any instant by an inquiring sword point.\n\nThe six spread a little. A very little. But there was room enough for\nThorn to slide between the two men nearest him and roll soundlessly\nunder the table.\n\nThere was no sanctuary for him there. The cursed Kori, with his hawk\neyes, glanced under the table after stabbing vainly along the wall.\n\n\"The carpet!\" he bellowed. \"See how the nap is pressed down! He is under\nthere, comrades!\"\n\nThe thrusting swords raked under the table a half second or so after\nThorn had rolled out the other side, upsetting a chair in his hurry.\n\n\"After him!\" panted Soyo. \"By the living God, this is wizardry! But he\nmust not get away--\"\n\n\"He won't!\" snapped the elderly leader. \"Men, form a line at the far end\nof the room and march slowly, shoulder to shoulder, to this end. The spy\nmust be caught!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe move was executed. All the men in the room, save the four guarding\nthe doors, lined up and advanced slowly, swerving and slashing their\nswords. Like a line of workers hand-harvesting a wheat field they\ncame--foot by foot toward the corner where Thorn turned this way and\nthat in a vain effort to escape.\n\nThe line reached the table. Over and under and around it the swords\nslashed viciously, leaving no space unprobed.\n\nThorn clenched his fists. He gazed at the packet containing the Ziegler\nplans. He gazed at the guarded door leading back to the kitchen. Then he\ntensed himself and leaped.\n\n\"The plans!\" shouted Kori hoarsely. \"Look--\"\n\nThe vital packet, as far as the eye could see, had suddenly grown wings,\nsoared from the table top, and was floating rapidly, convulsively,\ntoward the door.\n\n\"Stop him!\" yelled Soyo. \"Stop--\"\n\nAt that instant the heads of the two who guarded the door were dashed\ntogether. The door itself slammed open. The Ziegler plans sped into the\nbutler's pantry.\n\nThe door to the kitchen began to open just as Kori reached the pantry.\nAn oath burst from the Arvanian's lips. He flung his sword. In the air,\nshoulder high, appeared suddenly a small fountain of blood. Kori yelled\ntriumphantly.\n\nThorn, feeling the warm drip following the glancing slash in his\nshoulder, knew the veil of invisibility had at last been rent.\nAbandoning efforts at noiselessness, knowing that his whereabouts was\nconstantly marked by the packet in his hand, anyway, he fled through the\nkitchen to the rear door.\n\nThe bolt jerked back, under the astonished eyes of the five guards who\nhad not yet realized precisely what the commotion was all about--and who\nonly saw a packet of papers waving in mid-air, a trickle of blood\nappearing out of nothing, and a bolt banging open in its slot for no\nreason whatever.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThorn's fingers worked feverishly at the chain. But before he could\nbegin to get it undone, the guards had recovered from their surprise and\nhad joined the Arvanians who poured in from the dining room under Kori's\nlead.\n\nWith a score of men crowding the kitchen, Thorn looped back in his\ntracks like a hunted creature, and sought the cellar door. Four men he\nupset, one after another, aided by the fact that his twisting body could\nbe only approximately placed by the papers and the wound.\n\nThen Kori's hand swept through the air above the waving packet, to clamp\nover Thorn's wrist.\n\nWith an effort--that bulged the muscles of that blacksmith's fore-arm of\nhis till it seemed they must burst through the film, Thorn whirled Kori\nclear off his feet and sent him stumbling into the charge of three\nguards. But in the meantime the cellar was barred to him by a double\nline of men.\n\nFighting for his life--and, far more important, the existence of his\ncountry--Thorn lashed out with his invisible right fist while his left\nclutched the plans.\n\nA score of men arrayed in a death struggle against one! But the odds\nwere not twenty to one. Not quite. The score could mark Thorn's general\nwhereabouts--but they could not see his flying right fist! That was an\ninvisible weapon that did incredible damage.\n\nBut if they could not see the fist to guard against it, they could see\nthe results of the fist's impacts. Here a nose suddenly crumpled and an\ninstant later gushed red. There a head was snapped back and up, while\nits owner slowly sagged to the floor. And all the while the still\ndripping wound and the packet of documents kept with devilish ingenuity\nbetween the body of some swordless guard and the impatient blades of the\nArvanian nobles.\n\nAlmost, it seemed to Thorn, he would win free. Almost, it appeared to\nthe Arvanians, the unseen one would reach the big window near the\ndoor--which the path of his wreckage indicated was his goal. But one of\nthe wildly swinging fists of a guard caught Thorn at last.\n\nIt landed on the glass cup over his right eye, cutting a perfect circle\nin the skin around the eyesocket, and tearing the film over the glass!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow there were three things about the lithe, invisible body that the\nArvanians could see: the crumpled papers, a slowly drying patch of blood\nthat moved shoulder high in the air, and a blood-rimmed, ice-gray eye\nthat glared defiance at them from apparently untenanted atmosphere.\n\nThen came what seemed must be the end. Soyo appeared in the pantry\ndoorway with a machine gun.\n\n\"Everybody to the end of the kitchen by the window!\" he cried. \"To the\ndevil with silence--we'll spray this room with lead, and let the sound\nof shots bring what consequences it may!\"\n\nThe men scattered. The machine gun muzzle swept toward the place where\nthe eye, the papers, and the blood spot were to be seen.\n\nThat spot was now at one end of the great kitchen range on which a few\ncopper pots simmered over white-hot electric burners. At the other end\nof the range, in the end wall of the kitchen, was a second window. It\nwas small, less than a yard square, and had evidently been punched\nthrough the wall as an afterthought to carry off some of the heat of the\nhuge stove.\n\nSoyo's face twisted exultantly. The machine gun belched flame. Chasing\nrelentlessly after the dodging, shifting blood spot, a line of holes\nappeared in the wall following instantly on the tap--tap--tap of the\ngun.\n\nEye and papers and blood spot appeared to float through the air. One of\nthe copper pots on the range flew off onto the floor. The glass of the\nsmall ventilating window smashed to bits. In the jagged frame its broken\nedges presented, the Arvanians saw for a flashing instant the seared,\nblistered soles of a pair of human feet.\n\n\"Outside!\" bawled Kori. \"He jumped onto the range and dove through the\nwindow! After him!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter precious seconds had been wasted, the rear door was unchained and\nwrenched open. The Arvanians, swords and guns drawn, raced out to the\nrear yard.\n\nHis Excellency's town car, that had been standing in front of the open\ngarage doors, leaped into life. With motor roaring wide open, it tore\ntoward the Arvanians, some of whom leaped aside and some of whom were\nhurled to right and left by the heavy fenders....\n\nStartled people on Sixteenth Street saw a great town car swaying down\nthe asphalt seemingly guided by no hand other than that of fate; some\nsaid afterward they saw a single eye gleaming through the windshield,\nbut no one believed that. Equally startled people saw the car screech to\na stop in front of the home of the Secretary of War. After it, scarcely\na full minute later, three motors with the Arvanian coat of arms on them\ncame to a halt.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" said the Secretary blandly to the livid Arvanian\nAmbassador, \"no one has come in here with papers or anything else. I saw\na man jump out of your town car and run south on Connecticut Avenue.\nThat's all I know.\"\n\n\"But I tell you--\" shrieked the Arvanian.\n\nHe stopped, impaled on the Secretary's icy cold glance.\n\n\"Your story is rather incredible,\" murmured the Secretary. \"Valuable\nplans stolen from your Embassy by an invisible man? Come, come!\"\n\nDark Arvanian eyes glared into light American ones.\n\n\"By the way,\" said the Secretary affably, \"I am thinking of giving a\nsemi-official banquet to celebrate future, friendly relations between\nour two countries. Do you approve?\"\n\nThe Arvanian Ambassador tugged at his collar to straighten it. World\ndominion had been in his fingers--and had slipped through--but he would\nnot have been a diplomat had he let his face continue to express the\nbitterness in his heart.\n\n\"I think such a banquet would be a splendid idea,\" he said suavely.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Radiant Shell, by Paul Ernst\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RADIANT SHELL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 22171.txt or 22171.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/2/1/7/22171/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
