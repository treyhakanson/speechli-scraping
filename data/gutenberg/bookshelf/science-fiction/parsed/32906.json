They had just packed\ntheir bags and left._]\n\n\n[Sidenote: _Women of earth had finally attained their objective: a new\nworld all their own and--without men! But was it?_]\n\n\nAfter the Doctor gave him the hypo and left the ship, Bowren lay\nin absolute darkness wondering when the change would start. There\nwould be pain, the Doctor had said. \"Then you won't be aware of\nanything--anything at all.\"\n\nThat was a devil of a thing, Bowren thought, not to be aware of the\ngreatest adventure any man ever had. He, Eddie Bowren, the first to\nescape the Earth into space, the first man to Mars!\n\nHe was on his back in a small square steel cubicle, a secretly\nconstructed room in the wall of the cargo bin of the big spaceship\ncradled at the New Chicago Port. He was not without fear. But before the\nship blasted he wouldn't care--he would be changed by then. He would\nstart turning any minute now, becoming something else; he didn't know\nexactly what, but that wouldn't matter. After it was over, he wouldn't\nremember because the higher brain centers, the cortex, the analytical\nmind, would be completely cut off, short-circuited, during the\nalteration.\n\nThe cubicle was close, hot, sound-proofed, like a tomb. \"You will\nprobably make loud unpleasant noises,\" the Doctor had said, \"but no one\nwill hear you. Don't worry about anything until you get to Mars.\"\n\nThat was right, Bowren thought. My only problem is to observe, compute,\nand get back into this dungeon without being observed, and back to\nEarth.\n\nThe idea was to keep it from the women. The women wouldn't go for this\nat all. They would object. The women would be able to bring into effect\nseveral laws dealing with spaceflight, among them the one against\nstowaways, and especially that particular one about aberrated males\nsneaking into space and committing suicide.\n\nA lot of men had tried it, in the beginning. Some of them had managed\nit, but they had all died. For a long time, the men's egos hadn't been\nable to admit that the male organism was incapable of standing the\nrigors of acceleration. Women had had laws passed, and if the women\ncaught him doing this, the punishment would be extreme for him,\npersonally, and a lot more extreme for Earth civilization in general. If\nyou could call it a civilization. You could call it anything, Bowren\ngroaned--but it didn't make sense. A world without women. A birthrate\nreduced to zero.\n\nA trickle of sweat slid past Bowren's eyes, loosening a nervous flush\nalong his back that prickled painfully. His throat was tense and his\nheart pounded loud in the hot dark.\n\nA sharp pain ran up his body and exploded in his head. He tried to\nswallow, but something gagged in his throat. He was afraid of retching.\nHe lay with his mouth open, spittle dribbling over his lips. The pain\nreturned, hammered at his entrails. He fought the pain numbly, like a\nman grappling in the dark.\n\nThe wave subsided and he lay there gasping, his fists clenched.\n\n\"The pain will come in increasingly powerful waves,\" the Doctor had\nsaid. \"At a certain point, it will be so great, the analytical mind will\ncompletely short-circuit. It will stay that way enroute to Mars, and\nmeanwhile your body will rapidly change into that of a beast. Don't\nworry about it. A catalytic agent will return you to normal before you\nreach the planet. If you live, you'll be human again.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA male human couldn't stand the acceleration. But a woman could. Animals\ncould. They had experimented on human males and animals in the giant\ncentrifuges, and learned what to do. Animals could stand 25 \"G\"\nconsistently, or centrifugal forces as high as 120 revolutions a minute.\nAbout 10 \"G\" was the limit of female endurance. Less for men.\n\nIt had never been thoroughly determined why women had been able to stand\nhigher acceleration. But human females had the same physical advantages\nover men as female rats, rabbits, and cats over males of the same\nspecies. A woman's cellular structure was different; her center of\ngravity was different, the brain waves given off during acceleration\nwere different. It was suspected that the autonomic nervous system in\nwomen could function more freely to protect the body during emergency\nsituations. The only certainty about it was that no man had ever been\nable to get into space and live.\n\nBut animals could so they had worked on it and finally they decided to\nchange a man into an animal, at least temporarily. Geneticists and\nbiochemists and other specialists had been able to do a lot with\nhormones and hard radiation treatment. Especially with hormones. You\ncould shoot a man full of some fluid or another, and do almost anything\nto his organism. You could induce atavism, regression to some lower form\nof animal life--a highly speeded up regression. When you did that,\nnaturally the analytical mind, the higher thought centers of a more\nrecent evolutionary development, blanked out and the primal mind took\nover. The body changed too, considerably.\n\nBowren was changing. Then the pain came and he couldn't think. He felt\nhis mind cringing--giving way before the onslaught of the pain. Dimly he\ncould feel the agony in his limbs, the throbbing of his heart, the\nfading power of reason.\n\nHe retched, languished through flaccid minutes. There were recurring\nspasms of shivering as he rolled his thickened tongue in the arid cavity\nof his mouth. And then, somewhere, a spark exploded, and drowned him in\na pool of streaming flame.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nConsciousness returned slowly--much as it had gone--in waves of pain. It\ntook a long time. Elements of reason and unreason fusing through\ndistorted nightmares until he was lying there able to remember, able to\nwonder, able to think.\n\nInside the tiny compartment were supplies. A hypo, glucose, a durolene\nsuit neatly folded which he put on. He gave himself a needle, swallowed\nthe tablets, and waited until energy and a sense of well-being gave him\nsome degree of confidence.\n\nIt was very still. The ship would be cradled on Mars now. He lay there,\nrelaxing, preparing for the real challenge. He thought of how well the\nEarth Investigation Committee had planned the whole thing.\n\nThe last desperate attempt of man to get into space--to Mars--a woman's\nworld. At least it was supposed to be. Whatever it was, it wasn't a\nman's world.\n\nThe women didn't want Earth anymore. They had something better. But\nwhat? There were other questions, and Bowren's job was to find the\nanswers, remain unobserved and get back aboard this ship. He would then\nhypo himself again, and when the ship blasted off to Earth, he would go\nthrough the same transition all over again.\n\nHe put on the soft-soled shoes as well as the durolene suit and crawled\nthrough the small panel into the big cargo bin. It was empty. Only a dim\nyellow light shone on the big cargo vices along the curved walls.\n\nHe climbed the ladders slowly, cautiously, through a gnawing silence of\nsuspense, over the mesh grid flooring along the tubular corridors. He\nwondered what he would find.\n\nCould the women have been influenced by some alien life form on Mars?\n\nThat could explain the fact that women had divorced themselves\ncompletely from all men, from the Earth. Something had to explain it.\n\nThere was one other possibility. That the women had found human life on\nMars. That was a very remote possibility based on the idea that perhaps\nthe Solar system had been settled by human beings from outer space, and\nhad landed on two worlds at least.\n\nBowren remembered how his wife, Lora, had told him he was an idiot and a\nbore, and had walked out on him five years before; taken her three\nmonths course in astrogation, and left Earth. He hadn't heard of her or\nfrom her since. It was the same with every other man, married or not.\nThe male ego had taken a beating for so long that the results had been\npsychologically devastating.\n\nThe ship seemed to be empty of any human being but Bowren. He reached\nthe outer lock door. It was ajar. Thin cold air came through and sent a\nchill down his arms, tingling in his fingers. He looked out. It was\nnight on Mars, a strange red-tinted night, the double moons throwing\nstreaming color over the land.\n\nAcross the field, he saw the glowing Luciferin-like light of a small\ncity. Soaring spherical lines. Nothing masculine about its architecture.\nBowren shivered.\n\nHe climbed down the ladder, the air biting into his lungs. The silence\ndown there on the ground under the ship was intense.\n\nHe stood there a minute. The first man on Mars. Man's oldest dream\nrealized.\n\nBut the great thrill he had anticipated was dulled somewhat by fear. A\nfear of what the women had become, and of what might have influenced\ntheir becoming.\n\nHe took out a small neurogun and walked. He reached what seemed to be a\nhuge park that seemed to surround the city. It grew warmer and a soft\nwind whispered through the strange wide-spreading trees and bushes and\nexotic blossoms. The scent of blossoms drifted on the wind and the sound\nof running water, of murmuring voices.\n\nThe park thickened as Bowren edged into its dark, languid depth. It\nseemed as though the city radiated heat. He dodged suddenly behind a\ntree, knelt down. For an instant he was embarrassed seeing the two\nshadowy figures in each others arms on a bench in the moonlight. This\nemotion gave way to shock, anger, fear.\n\nOne of them was a--man!\n\nBowren felt the perspiration start from his face. An intense jealousy\nsurrendered to a start of fearful curiosity. Where had the man come\nfrom?\n\nBowren's long frustration, the memory of his wife, the humiliation, the\nrejection, the abandonment, the impotent rage of loneliness--it all came\nback to him.\n\nHe controlled his emotion somehow. At least he didn't manifest it\nphysically. He crept closer, listened.\n\n\"This was such a sweet idea,\" the woman was whispering. \"Bringing me\nhere to the park tonight. That's why I love you so, Marvin. You're\nalways so romantic.\"\n\n\"How else could I think of you, darling,\" the man said. His voice was\ncultured, precise, soft, thick with emotion.\n\n\"You're so sweet, Marvin.\"\n\n\"You're so beautiful, darling. I think of you every minute that you're\naway on one of those space flights. You women are so wonderful to have\nconquered space, but sometimes I hate the ships that take you away from\nme.\"\n\nThe woman sighed. \"But it's so nice to come back to you. So exciting, so\ncomfortable.\"\n\nThe kiss was long and deep. Bowren backed away, almost smashing into the\ntree. He touched his forehead. He was sweating heavily. His beard\ndripped moisture. There was a hollow panicky feeling in his stomach. Now\nhe was confused as well as afraid.\n\nAnother couple was sitting next to a fountain, and a bubbling brook ran\npast them, singing into the darkness. Bowren crouched behind a bush and\nlistened. It might have been the man he had just left, still talking.\nThe voice was slightly different, but the dialogue sounded very much the\nsame.\n\n\"It must be wonderful to be a woman, dear, and voyage between the stars.\nBut as I say, I'm glad to stay here and tend the home and mind the\nchildren, glad to be here, my arms open to you when you come back.\"\n\n\"It's so wonderful to know that you care so much. I'm so glad you never\nlet me forget that you love me.\"\n\n\"I love you, every minute of every day. Just think--two more months and\none week and we will have been married ten years.\"\n\n\"It's so lovely,\" she said. \"It seems like ten days. Like those first\nthrilling ten days, darling, going over and over again.\"\n\n\"I'll always love you, darling.\"\n\n\"Always?\"\n\n\"Always.\"\n\nThe man got up, lifted the woman in his arms, held her high. \"Darling,\nlet's go for a night ride across the desert.\"\n\n\"Oh, you darling. You always think of these little adventures.\"\n\n\"All life with you is an adventure.\"\n\n\"But what about little Jimmie and Janice?\"\n\n\"I've arranged a sitter for them.\"\n\n\"But darling--you mean you--Oh, you're so wonderful. You think of\neverything. So practical, yet so romantic ... so--\"\n\nHe kissed her and ran away, holding her high in the air, and her\nlaughter bubbled back to where Bowren crouched behind the bush. He kept\non crouching there, staring numbly at the vacancy the fleeing couple had\nleft in the shadows. \"Good God,\" he whispered. \"After ten years--\"\n\nHe shook his head and slowly licked his lips. He'd been married five\nyears.\n\nIt hadn't been like this. He'd never heard of any marriage maintaining\nsuch a crazy high romantic level of manic neuroticism as this for very\nlong. Of course the women had always expected it to. But the men--\n\nAnd anyway--_where did the men come from?_\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBowren moved down a winding lane between exotic blossoms, through air\nsaturated with the damp scent of night-blooming flowers. He walked\ncautiously enough, but in a kind of daze, his mind spinning. The\nappearance of those men remained in his mind. When he closed his eyes\nfor a moment, he could see them.\n\nPerfectly groomed, impeccably dressed, smiling, vital, bronze-skinned,\ndelicate, yet strong features; the kind of male who might be considered,\nBowren thought, to be able to assert just the right degree of\naggressiveness without being indelicate.\n\nWhy, he thought, they've found perfect men, their type of men.\n\nHe dodged behind a tree. Here it was again. Same play, same scene\npractically, only the players were two other people. A couple standing\narm in arm beside a big pool full of weird darting fish and throwing\nupward a subdued bluish light. Music drifted along the warm currents of\nair. The couple were silhouetted by the indirect light. The pose is\nperfect, he thought. The setting is perfect.\n\n\"You're so wonderful, darling,\" the man was saying, \"and I get so lonely\nwithout you. I always see your face, hear your voice, no matter how long\nyou're away.\"\n\n\"Do you? Do you?\"\n\n\"Always. Your hair so red, so dark it seems black in certain lights.\nYour eyes so slanted, so dark a green they seem black usually too. Your\nnose so straight, the nostrils flaring slightly, the least bit too much\nsometimes. Your mouth so red and full. Your skin so smooth and dark. And\nyou're ageless, darling. Being married to you five years, it's one\nexciting adventure.\"\n\n\"I love you so,\" she said. \"You're everything any woman could want in a\nhusband. Simply everything, yet you're so modest with it all. I still\nremember how it used to be. Back there ... with the other men I mean?\"\n\n\"You should forget about _them_, my dear.\"\n\n\"I'm forgetting, slowly though. It may take a long time to forget\ncompletely. Oh, he was such an unpleasant person, so uninteresting after\na while. So inconsiderate, so self-centered. He wasn't romantic at all.\nHe never said he loved me, and when he kissed me it was mere routine. He\nnever thought about anything but his work, and when he did come home at\nnight, he would yell at me about not having ordered the right dinner\nfrom the cafelator. He didn't care whether he used hair remover on his\nface in the mornings or not. He was surly and sullen and selfish. But I\ncould have forgiven everything else if he had only told me every day\nthat he loved me, that he could never love anyone else. The things that\nyou do and say, darling.\"\n\n\"I love you,\" he said. \"I love you, I love you. But please, let's not\ntalk about _him_ anymore. It simply horrifies me!\"\n\nBowren felt the sudden sickening throbbing of his stomach. The\ndescription. Now the slight familiarity of voice. And then he heard the\nman say, murmuring, \"Lois ... darling Lois....\"\n\nLois! LOIS!\n\nBowren shivered. His jowls darkened, his mouth pressed thin by the\npowerful clamp of his jaws. His body seemed to loosen all over and he\nfell into a crouch. Tiredness and torn nerves and long-suppressed\nemotion throbbed in him, and all the rage and suppression and\nfrustration came back in a wave. He yelled. It was more of a sound, a\nharsh prolonged animal roar of pain and rage and humiliation.\n\n\"Lois ...\" He ran forward.\n\nShe gasped, sank away as Bowren hit the man, hard. The man sighed and\ngyrated swinging his arms, teetering and flipped backward into the pool\namong the lights and the weird fish. A spray of cold water struck\nBowren, sobering him a little, sobered his burst of mindless passion\nenough that he could hear the shouts of alarm ringing through the trees.\nHe turned desperately.\n\nLois cringed. He scarcely remembered her now, he realized. She was\ndifferent. He had forgotten everything except an image that had changed\nwith longing. She hadn't been too impressive anyway, maybe, or maybe she\nhad. It didn't matter now.\n\nHe tried to run, tried to get away. He heard Lois' voice, high and\nshrill. Figures closed in around him. He fought, desperately. He put a\nfew temporarily out of the way with the neurogun, but there were always\nmore. Men, men everywhere. Hundreds of men where there should be no men\nat all. Well-groomed, strong, bronzed, ever-smiling men. It gave him\nintense pleasure to crack off a few of the smiles. To hurl the gun,\nsmash with his fists.\n\nThen the men were swarming all over him, the clean faces, the smiling\nfragrant men, and he went down under the weight of men.\n\nHe tried to move. A blow fell hard and his head smashed against the\nrocks. He tried to rise up, and other blows beat him down and he was\nglad about the darkness, not because it relieved the pain, but because\nit curtained off the faces of men.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a time it was as though he was being carried through a dim\nhalf-consciousness, able to think, too tired to move or open his eyes.\nHe remembered how the men of Earth had rationalized a long time, making\na joke out of it. Laughing when they hadn't wanted to laugh, but to\nhate. It had never been humorous. It had been a war between the sexes,\nand the women had finally won, destroying the men psychologically, the\nrace physically. Somehow they had managed to go on with a culture of\ntheir own.\n\nThe war between the sexes had never really been a joke. It had been\ndeadly serious, right from the beginning of the militant feminist\nmovements, long before the last big war. There had always been basic\npsychological and physiological differences. But woman had refused to\nadmit this, and had tried to be the \"equal\" if not the better of men.\nFor so long woman had made it strictly competitive, and in her\nsubconscious mind she had regarded men as wonderful creatures, capable\nof practically anything, and that woman could do nothing better than to\nemulate them in every possible way. There was no such thing as a woman's\nrole unless it had been the same as a man's. That had gone on a long\ntime. And it hadn't been a joke at all.\n\nHow ironic it was, there at the last! All of man's work through the ages\nhad been aimed at the stars. And the women had assumed the final phase\nof conquest!\n\nFor a long time women had been revolting against the masculine symbols,\nthe levers, pistons, bombs, torpedoes and hammers, all manifestations of\nman's whole activity of overt, aggressive power.\n\nThe big H-bombs of the last great war had seemed to be man's final\nsymbol, destructive. And after that, the spaceships, puncturing space,\nroaring outward, the ultimate masculine symbol of which men had dreamed\nfor so long, and which women had envied.\n\nAnd then only the women could stand the acceleration. It was a\nphysiological fact. Nothing could change it. Nothing but what they had\ndone to Bowren.\n\nAll of man's evolutionary struggle, and the women had assumed the\nclimax, assumed all the past wrapped up in the end, usurped the effect,\nand thereby psychologically assuming also all the thousands of years of\ncausation.\n\nFor being held down, being made neurotic by frustration and the\nimpossibility of being the \"equal\" of men, because they were\nfundamentally psychologically and physiologically different, women had\ntaken to space with an age-old vengeance. Personal ego salvation.\n\nBut they hadn't stopped there. What had they done? What about the men? A\nman for every woman, yet no men from Earth. That much Bowren knew.\nNative Martians? What?\n\nHe had been transported somewhere in a car of some kind. He didn't\nbother to be interested. He couldn't get away. He was held fast. He\nrefused to open his eyes because he didn't want to see the men who held\nhim, the men who had replaced him and every other man on Earth. The men\nwho were destroying the civilization of Earth.\n\nThe gimmicks whereby the women had rejected Earth and left it to wither\nand die in neglect and bitter, bitter wonderment.\n\nHe was tired, very tired. The movement of the car lulled him, and he\ndrifted into sleep.\n\nHe opened his eyes and slowly looked around. Pretty pastel ceiling. A\nbig room, beautiful and softly furnished, with a marked absence of\nmetal, of shiny chrome, of harshness or brittle angles. It was something\nof an office, too, with a desk that was not at all business-like, but\nstill a desk. A warm glow suffused the room, and the air was pleasantly\nscented with natural smelling perfumes.\n\nA woman stood in the middle of the room studying him with detached\ninterest. She was beautiful, but in a hard, mature, withdrawn way. She\nwas dark, her eyes large, liquid black and dominating her rather small\nsharply-sculptured face. Her mouth was large, deeply red. She had a\nstrong mouth.\n\nHe looked at her a while. He felt only a deep, bitter resentment. He\nfelt good though, physically. He had probably been given something, an\ninjection. He sat up. Then he got to his feet.\n\nShe kept on studying him. \"A change of clothes, dry detergent, and hair\nremover for your face are in there, through that door,\" she said.\n\nHe said: \"Right now I'd rather talk.\"\n\n\"But don't you want to take off that awful--beard?\"\n\n\"The devil with it! Is that so important? It's natural isn't it for a\nman to have hair on his face? I like hair on my face.\"\n\nShe opened her mouth a little and stepped back a few steps.\n\n\"And anyway, what could be less important right now than the way I\nlook?\"\n\n\"I'm--I'm Gloria Munsel,\" she said hesitantly. \"I'm President of the\nCity here. And what is your name, please?\"\n\n\"Eddie Bowren. What are you going to do with me?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"You act like a mad man. I'd almost forgotten what you men\nof Earth were like. I was pretty young then. Well, frankly, I don't know\nwhat we're going to do with you. No precedent for the situation. No laws\nconcerning it. It'll be up to the Council.\"\n\n\"It won't be pleasant for me,\" he said, \"I can be safe in assuming\nthat.\"\n\nShe shrugged again and crossed her arms. He managed to control his\nemotions somehow as he looked at the smooth lines of her body under the\nlong clinging gown. She was so damn beautiful! A high proud body in a\nsmooth pink gown, dark hair streaming back and shiny and soft.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was torture. It had been for a long time, for him, for all the\nothers. \"Let me out of here!\" he yelled harshly. \"Put me in a room by\nmyself!\"\n\nShe moved closer to him and looked into his face. The fragrance of her\nhair, the warmth of her reached out to him. Somehow, he never knew how,\nhe managed to grin. He felt the sweat running down his dirty, bearded,\nbattered face. His suit was torn and dirty. He could smell himself, the\nstale sweat, the filth. He could feel his hair, shaggy and long, down\nhis neck, over his ears.\n\nHer lips were slightly parted, and wet, and she had a funny dark look in\nher eyes, he thought. She turned quickly as the door opened, and a man\ncame in. He was only slightly taller than Gloria and he nodded, smiled\nbrightly, bowed a little, moved forward. He carried a big bouquet of\nflowers and presented them to her.\n\nShe took the flowers, smiled, thanked him, and put them on the table.\nThe man said. \"So sorry, darling, to intrude. But I felt I had to see\nyou for a few minutes. I left the children with John, and dashed right\nup here. I thought we might have lunch together.\"\n\n\"You're so thoughtful, dear,\" she said.\n\nThe man turned a distasteful look upon Bowren. He said. \"My dear, what\nis _this_?\"\n\n\"A man,\" she said, and then added. \"From Earth.\"\n\n\"What? Good grief, you mean they've found a way--?\"\n\n\"I don't know. You'd better go back home and tend the yard today, Dale.\nI'll tell you all about it when I come home this evening. All right?\"\n\n\"Well I--oh, oh yes, of course, if you say so, darling.\"\n\n\"Thank you, dear.\" She kissed him and he bowed out.\n\nShe turned and walked back toward Bowren. \"Tell me,\" she said. \"How did\nyou get here alive?\"\n\nWhy not tell her? He was helpless here. They'd find out anyway, as soon\nas they got back to Earth on the cargo run. And even if they didn't find\nout, that wouldn't matter either. They would be on guard from now on. No\nman would do again what Bowren had done. The only chance would be to\nbuild secret spaceships of their own and every time one blasted, have\nevery member of the crew go through what Bowren had. It couldn't last.\nToo much injury and shock.\n\nAs he talked he studied the office, and he thought of other things. An\noffice that was like a big beautiful living room. A thoroughly feminine\noffice. Nor was it the type of office a woman would fix for a man. It\nwas a woman's office. Everything, the whole culture here, was feminine.\nWhen he had finished she said, \"Interesting. It must have been a very\nunpleasant experience for you.\"\n\nHe grinned. \"I suffered. But even though I've failed, it's worth all the\nsuffering, if you'll tell me--where did all the ah--men come from?\"\n\nShe told him. It was, to say the least, startling, and then upon\nreflection, he realized how simple it all was. No aliens. No native\nMartians. A very simple and thoroughly logical solution, and in a way,\ntypically feminine.\n\nHormone treatment and genetic manipulation, plus a thorough\nreconditioning while the treatment was taking place.\n\n_And the women had simply turned approximately half of their number into\nmen!_\n\nShe paused, then went on. \"It was the only way we could see it, Mr.\nBowren. Earth was a man's world, and we could never have belonged in it,\nnot the way we wanted to. Men wouldn't stand it anyway, down there,\nhaving us going into space, usurping their masculine role. And\nanyway--you men of Earth had become so utterly unsatisfactory as\ncompanions, lovers, and husbands, that it was obvious nothing could ever\nbe done about it. Not unless we set up our own culture, our own\ncivilization, our way.\"\n\n\"But meanwhile we die down there,\" Bowren said. \"Logic is nice. But mass\nmurder, and the death of a whole world civilization seems pretty cold\nfrom where I'm standing. It's pathological, but it's too late to think\nabout that. It's done now.\"\n\n\"But we're happy here,\" she said. \"For the first time in a long, long\ntime, we women feel like ourselves. We feel truly independent. The men\naround us are the kind of men we want, instead of us being what they\nwant us to be, or even worse, the men being what we want them to be but\nresenting it and making life unbearable for both. All through the\nprocess of being changed into men, our women undergo such a thorough\nconditioning that they can never be anything else but model men in every\nsense. Their attitude as women with which they started treatment helped.\nThey knew what they wanted in men, and they became what we wanted them\nto be, as men.\"\n\n\"Very logical,\" Bowren said. \"It smells to heaven it's so logical.\" It\nwas purely impulse, what he did then. He couldn't help it. It wasn't\nlogical either. It was emotional and he did it because he had to do it\nand because he didn't see any reason why he shouldn't.\n\nHe put his arm out suddenly, hooked her slim waist, and pulled her to\nhim. Her face flushed and his eyes were very wide and dark as she looked\nup at him.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said. \"The whole thing's insane. The lot of you are mad,\nand though I can't help it, I hate to see it happen this way. What kind\nof men are these? These smiling robots, these goons who are nothing else\nbut reflections in a woman's mirror? Who'd want to be a man like that.\nWho would really want a man like that? And who would want a woman who\nwas just what a man wanted her to be? Where's the fire? Where's the\nindividuality? Where's the conflict, the fighting and snarling and\nraging that makes living. All this is apathy, this is death! You don't\ngrow by being agreeable, but by conflict.\"\n\n\"What are you trying to sell now?\" she whispered.\n\nHe laughed. It was wild sounding to him, not very humorous really, but\nstill it was laughter. \"Selling nothing, buying nothing.\" He pulled her\ncloser and kissed her. Her lips parted slightly and he could feel the\nwarmth of her and the quick drawing of breath. Then she pushed him away.\nShe raised her hand and brushed it over his face.\n\nShe shook her head slowly. \"It feels rather interesting,\" she said,\n\"your face. I've never felt a man's face before, that wasn't smooth, the\nway it should be.\"\n\nHe laughed again, more softly this time. \"Why reform your men? You women\nalways wanted to do that.\"\n\n\"We don't reform men here,\" she said. \"We start them out right--from the\nbeginning.\"\n\nShe backed away from him. She raised her hand to her face and her\nfingers touched her lips. Wrinkles appeared between her eyes and she\nshook her head again. Not at him, but at something, a thought perhaps,\nhe couldn't tell.\n\nFinally she said. \"That was an inexcusable, boorish thing to do. A\ntypical thoughtless egomanical Earth-male action if there ever was one.\nOur men are all perfect here, and in comparison to them, you're a pretty\nmiserable specimen. I'm glad you showed up here. It's given me, and\nother women, a good chance for comparison. It makes our men seem so much\nbetter even than they were to us before.\"\n\nHe didn't say anything.\n\n\"Our men are perfect! Perfect you understand? What are you smiling\nabout? Their character is good. They're excellent conversationalists,\nwell informed, always attentive, moderate, sympathetic, interested in\nlife, and always interested in _us_.\"\n\n\"And I suppose they are also--human?\"\n\n\"This is nonsense,\" she said, her voice rising slightly. \"You will take\nthat door out please. The Council will decide what's to be done with\nyou.\"\n\nHe nodded, turned, and went through the door. There were two men there\nwaiting for him. They were both blond, with light blue eyes, just medium\nheight, perfectly constructed physically, perfectly groomed, impeccably\ndressed. They smiled at him. Their teeth had been brushed every morning.\nOne of them wrinkled his nose, obviously as a reaction to Bowren. The\nother started to reach, seemed reluctant to touch him.\n\n\"Then don't touch me, brother,\" Bowren said. \"Put a hand on me, and I'll\nslug you.\" The man reached away, and it gave Bowren an ecstatic\nsensation to send his fist against the man's jaw. It made a cracking\nsound and the man's head flopped back as his knees crumbled and he swung\naround and stretched out flat on his face on the long tubular corridor.\n\n\"Always remember your etiquette,\" Bowren said. \"Keep your hands off\npeople. It isn't polite.\"\n\nThe other man grunted something, still managing to smile, as he rushed\nat Bowren. Bowren side-stepped, hooked the man's neck in his arm and ran\nhim across the hall and smashed his head into the wall.\n\nHe turned, opened the door into Munsel's office, dragged both of them in\nand shut the door again. He walked down the corridor several hundred\nfeet before a woman appeared, in some kind of uniform, and said. \"Will\nyou come this way please?\"\n\nHe said he would.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a small room, comfortably furnished. Food came through a panel in\nthe wall whenever he pressed the right button. A telescreen furnished\nentertainment when he pushed another button. Tasty mixed drinks\nresponded to other buttons.\n\nHe never bothered to take advantage of the facilities offered for\nremoving his beard, bathing, or changing clothes. Whatever fate was\ngoing to befall him, he would just as soon meet it as the only man on\nMars who looked the part--according to Bowren's standards, at least--at\nleast by comparison.\n\nHe thought of trying to escape. If he could get away from the city and\ninto the Martian hills, he could die out there with some dignity. It was\na good idea, but he knew it was impossible. At least so far, it was\nimpossible. Maybe something would come up. An opportunity and he would\ntake it. That was the only thing left for him.\n\nHe was in there for what seemed a long time. It was still, the light\nremaining always the same. He slept a number of times and ate several\ntimes. He did a lot of thinking too. He thought about the men on Earth\nand finally he decided it didn't matter much. They had brought it on\nthemselves in a way, and if there was anything like cause and effect\noperating on such a scale, they deserved no sympathy. Man had expressed\nhis aggressive male ego until he evolved the H-bombs and worse, and by\nthen the whole world was neurotic with fear, including the women. Women\nhad always looked into the mirror of the future (or lack of it), of the\nrace, and the more she had looked, the more the insecurity. The atomic\nwars had created a kind of final feeling of insecurity as far as men\nwere concerned, forced them to become completely psychologically and\nphysiologically self-sufficient. They had converted part of their own\nkind into men, their own kind of men, and theoretically there wouldn't\nbe any more insecurity brought on by the kind of male psychology that\nhad turned the Earth around for so long.\n\nAll right, drop it right there then, he thought. It's about all over.\nIt's all over but the requiem. Sometime later he was in a mood where he\ndidn't mind it when an impersonal face appeared on the screen and looked\nright at him and told him the Council's verdict. It was a woman, and her\nvoice was cold, very cold.\n\n\"Mr. Eddie Bowren. The Council has reached a verdict regarding what is\nto be done with you. You are to be exterminated. It is painless and we\nwill make it as pleasant as possible.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Bowren said. A woman's world was so polite, so mannerly, so\nremembering of all the social amenities. It would be so difficult after\na while to know when anyone was speaking, or doing anything real.\n\"Thanks,\" he said again. \"I will do all in my power to make my\nextermination a matter of mutual pleasure.\" By now he was pretty drunk,\nhad been drunk for some time. He raised his glass. \"Here's to a real\nhappy time of it, baby.\"\n\nThe screen faded. He sat there brooding, and he was still brooding when\nthe door unlocked and opened softly. He sat there and looked at Gloria\nMunsel for a while, wondering why she was here. Why she would look so\nprovocative, so enchanting, so devastating, whatever other words you\ncared to dream up.\n\nShe moved toward him with a slight swaying motion that further disturbed\nhim. He felt her long white fingers rubbing over the stiff wiry beard of\nhis face. \"I dreamed about the way that beard felt last night,\" she\nsaid. \"Silly of me wasn't it? I heard of the way you smell, of the way\nyou yelled at me, so impolitely. Why did I dream of it, I said this\nmorning, so now I'm here to find out why.\"\n\n\"Get out and let me alone,\" Bowren yelled. \"I'm going to be\nexterminated. So let me alone to my own company.\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard about that verdict,\" she said. She looked away from him.\n\"I don't know why they made that choice. Well, I do in a way, they're\nafraid of you, your influence. It would be very disruptive socially.\nSeveral of our men--\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter why,\" Bowren said. \"What matters is that it will be\nas pleasant as possible. If you're going to kill a man, be nice about\nit.\"\n\nShe stared down at him. Chills rippled down his back as her warm soft\nfingers continued to stroke his bearded chin and throat. He got up. It\nwas too uncomfortable and it was torture. He said, \"Get out of here.\nMaybe I'm not a conformist, but I'm damn human!\"\n\nShe backed away. \"But--but what do you mean?\"\n\nHe got up and put the flat of his hands cupping her shoulder blades. Her\neyes stared wildly, and her lips were wet and she was breathing heavily.\nHe could see the vein pulsing faster in her slim throat. She had an\nexciting body.\n\nHe saw it then, the new slow smile that crept across her face. His left\nhand squirmed at the thick piled hair on her shoulders and he tugged and\nher face tilted further and he looked at the parted pouting lips. The\npalm of his right hand brushed her jaw and his fingers took her cheeks\nand brought her face over and he spread his mouth hard over her mouth.\nHer lips begged. Hammers started banging away in his stomach.\n\nMusic from the screen was playing a crescendo into his pulse. They\nswayed together to the music, her head thrown back, her eyes closed. She\nstepped back, dropped her arms limply at her sides. There was the clean\nsweet odor of her hair.\n\n\"I'd better go now,\" she whispered. \"Before I do something that would\nresult in my not being President anymore.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe wiped his face. Don't beg, he thought. The devil with her and the\nrest. A man could lose everything, all the women, not one, but all of\nthem. He could live alone, a thousand miles from nowhere, at the North\nPole like Amundsen, and it didn't matter. He could be killed pleasantly\nor unpleasantly, that didn't matter either. All that mattered was that\nhe maintain some dignity, as a man.\n\nHe stood there, not saying anything. He managed to grin. Finally he\nsaid, \"Goodbye, and may your husband never say a harsh word to you or do\nanything objectionable as long as you both shall live, and may he love\nyou every hour of every day, and may he drop dead.\"\n\nShe moved in again, put her arms around him. There were tears in her\neyes. She placed her cheek on his shoulder. \"I love you,\" she whispered.\n\"I know that now.\"\n\nHe felt a little helpless. Tears, what could you do with a woman's\ntears?\n\nShe sobbed softly, talking brokenly. Maybe not to him, but to someone,\nsomewhere. A memory, a shadow out of a long time back....\n\n\"Maybe it's ... it's all a mistake after all ... maybe it is. I've never\nbeen too sure, not for a while now. And then you--the way you talked and\nlooked--the excitement. I don't know why. But the touch of your\nbeard--your voice. I don't know what happened. We've carried it to\nextremes, extremes, Eddie. It was always this way with us--once we were\nsure of our man, and even before, when he was blinded by new love, we\ntried to make him over, closer to _our_ idea of what was right. But now\nI know something ... those faults and imperfections, most of them were\nmen's, the real men's chief attractions. Individuality, that's the\nthing, Eddie, that's it after all. And it's imperfections too, maybe\nmore than anything else. Imperfections.... Oh, Eddie, you're close, much\ncloser to human nature, to real vitality, through _your_ imperfections.\nNot imperfections. Eddie--your beard is beautiful, your dirt is lovely,\nyour yelling insults are wonderful--and....\"\n\nShe stopped a minute. Her hands ran through his hair. \"When you get a\nman made over, he's never very nice after that, Eddie. Never--\"\n\nShe sobbed, pulled his lips down. \"Eddie--I can't let them kill you.\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" he said. \"No one can do anything. Don't get yourself in a\njam. You'll forget this in a little while. There's nothing here for a\nguy like me, and I'm not for you.\"\n\nShe stepped way, her hands still on his shoulders. \"No--I didn't mean\nthat. I've got to go on living in the world I helped make, among the men\nwe all decided we would always want. I've got to do that. Listen, Eddie,\nhow did you intend to get back to Earth?\"\n\nHe told her.\n\n\"Then it's just a matter of getting back aboard that same ship, and into\nthis secret room unobserved?\"\n\n\"That's all, Gloria. That and keep from being exterminated first.\"\n\n\"I can get you out of here. We'll have to do it right now. Take that\nbeard off, and get that hair smoothed down somehow. I hate to see it\nhappen, but I've got to get you out of here, and the only way to do it\nis for you to be like one of the men here.\"\n\nHe went to work on his face and hair. She went out and returned with a\nsuit like the other men wore. He got into it. She smiled at him, a\nhesitant and very soft smile, and she kissed him before they left the\nroom and cautiously went out of the City.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe way was clear across the moonlit field and under the deep dark\nshadow of the ship. He kissed her and then took hold of the ladder. She\nslipped a notebook of velonex, full of micro-film, into his hands.\n\"Goodbye, Eddie,\" she said. \"Take this with you. It may give you men\ndown there a way out. I never thought much before of how mad it must be\nfor you.\"\n\nHe took the folder. He looked up at the double moons painting the night\na fantastic shifting wave of changing light. And then he looked down at\nGloria Munsel again, at the glinting shine of her hair.\n\n\"Goodbye,\" he said. \"I might stay after all--except that a lot of men on\nEarth are waiting for me to tell them something. They'll be surprised.\nI--\" He hesitated. Her eyes widened. Warmth of emotion moved him and he\nsaid, or started to say, \"I love you,\" and many other things, but she\ninterrupted him.\n\n\"Don't please, Eddie. Anything you said now would sound just like what\nmy devoted husband says, every day. I'd rather you wouldn't say anything\nat all now, Eddie, just goodbye.\"\n\n\"Goodbye then,\" he said again.\n\nHe looked back from the opened door in the ship's cargo bin. Her face\nwas shining up at him, her lips slightly parted, her cheeks wet. It was\na picture he would never be able to forget, even if he wanted to.\n\n\"When you forget to shave in the mornings, Eddie, think of me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBowren stood up and addressed the investigation committee which had sent\nhim to Mars. He hadn't made any statements at all up to this moment. The\nten members of the Committee sat there behind the half-moon table. None\nof them moved. Their faces were anxious. Some of them were perspiring.\n\nEddie told them what he had seen, what he had heard, his own impressions\nabout the whole thing, about his escape. He left out certain personal\ndetails that were, to him, unnecessary to this particular report.\n\nThe Committee sat there a while, then started to talk. They talked at\nonce for a while, then the Chairman rapped for order and stood up. His\nface had an odd twist to it, and his bald head was pocked with\nperspiration.\n\nEddie Bowren took the book of micro-film from under his arm, the one\nGloria Munsel had given him. He put it on the table. \"That has been\nthoroughly checked by scientists, and their report is included. I\nthought it surely was a false report, until they checked it. The first\npage there gives a brief outline of what the micro-film contains.\"\n\nThe Chairman read, then looked up. He coughed. He mopped at his head.\n\nEddie said. \"As I saw it up there, this is the way it's going to stay.\nWe'll never get into space, not without using the methods that were used\nwith me. And they're too destructive. I've been examined. I could never\ngo through it again and live. And that's the only way Earth men can ever\nget into space. The women aren't coming back to us. They have husbands\nof their own now. Believe me, those women aren't going to leave their\nperfect husbands. They've set up a completely feminine culture. It's\ntheirs, all theirs. They'll never give it up to return to a masculine\nworld, and that's what Earth will always be to them. There are only a\nfew women left on Earth, and they're of such subnormal intelligence as\nto be only a menace to any possible future progeny. Our birthrate has\nstopped. We are living under extremely abnormal circumstances without\nwomen. I have, as I said before, but one recommendation to this\nCommittee, and you take it for what it's worth. I personally don't\ncare--much--and that isn't important either.\"\n\n\"What is your recommendation, Bowren?\"\n\n\"I assure you that the formulas in that book will work for us, Mr.\nChairman. Will you accept the reports of the scientists who investigated\nthose formulas?\"\n\n\"I will,\" the Chairman said hoarsely. \"I'll accept it. Why not--?\"\n\nBowren grinned thinly at the ten men. \"There's the secret of doing what\nthe women have done. It'll work for us too. Our only chance for survival\nis to follow their procedure. We've got to start turning at least a\npercentage of ourselves into women.\"\n\nOne man leaned forward and put his head on his arms. The others sat\nthere, in a kind of stunned numb attitude, their eyes drifting vaguely.\n\nThe Chairman coughed and looked around the silent hall, and at the other\nten men in it.\n\n\"Any volunteers?\" he whispered.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Thy Name Is Woman, by Bryce Walton\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THY NAME IS WOMAN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 32906.txt or 32906.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/2/9/0/32906/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Meehan and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
