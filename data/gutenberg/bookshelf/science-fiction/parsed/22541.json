But a misplaced battleship--in\n the wrong hands!--can be most dangerous._\n\n Illustrated by Schoenherr\n\n\nWhen it comes to picking locks and cracking safes I admit to no master.\nThe door to Inskipp's private quarters had an old-fashioned tumbler drum\nthat was easier to pick than my teeth. I must have gone through that\ndoor without breaking step. Quiet as I was though, Inskipp still heard\nme. The light came on and there he was sitting up in bed pointing a .75\ncaliber recoilless at my sternum.\n\n\"You should have more brains than that, diGriz,\" he snarled. \"Creeping\ninto my room at night! You could have been shot.\"\n\n\"No I couldn't,\" I told him, as he stowed the cannon back under his\npillow. \"A man with a curiosity bump as big as yours will always talk\nfirst and shoot later. And besides--none of this pussyfooting around in\nthe dark would be necessary if your screen was open and I could have got\na call through.\"\n\nInskipp yawned and poured himself a glass of water from the dispenser\nunit above the bed. \"Just because I head the Special Corps, doesn't\nmean that I _am_ the Special Corps,\" he said moistly while he drained\nthe glass. \"I have to sleep sometime. My screen is open only for\nemergency calls, not for every agent who needs his hand held.\"\n\n\"Meaning I am in the hand-holding category?\" I asked with as much\nsweetness as I could.\n\n\"Put yourself in any category you please,\" he grumbled as he slumped\ndown in the bed. \"And also put yourself out into the hall and see me\ntomorrow during working hours.\"\n\nHe was at my mercy, really. He wanted sleep so much. And he was going to\nbe wide awake so very soon.\n\n\"Do you know what this is?\" I asked him, poking a large glossy pic under\nhis long broken nose. One eye opened slowly.\n\n\"Big warship of some kind, looks like Empire lines. Now for the last\ntime--go away!\" he said.\n\n\"A very good guess for this late at night,\" I told him cheerily. \"It is\na late Empire battleship of the Warlord class. Undoubtedly one of the\nmost truly efficient engines of destruction ever manufactured. Over a\nhalf mile of defensive screens and armament, that could probably turn\nany fleet existent today into fine radioactive ash--\"\n\n\"Except for the fact that the last one was broken up for scrap over a\nthousand years ago,\" he mumbled.\n\nI leaned over and put my lips close to his ear. So there would be no\nchance of misunderstanding. Speaking softly, but clearly.\n\n\"True, true,\" I said. \"But wouldn't you be just a _little_ bit\ninterested if I was to tell you that one is being built today?\"\n\nOh, it was beautiful to watch. The covers went one way and Inskipp went\nthe other. In a single unfolding, in concerted motion he left the\nhorizontal and recumbent and stood tensely vertical against the wall.\nExamining the pic of the battleship under the light. He apparently did\nnot believe in pajama bottoms and it hurt me to see the goose-bumps\nrising on those thin shanks. But if the legs were thin, the voice was\nmore than full enough to make up for the difference.\n\n\"Talk, blast you diGriz--_talk_!\" he roared. \"What is this nonsense\nabout a battleship? Who's building it?\"\n\nI had my nail file out and was touching up a cuticle, holding it out for\ninspection before I said anything. From the corner of my eye I could see\nhim getting purple about the face--but he kept quiet. I savored my small\nmoment of power.\n\n\"Put diGriz in charge of the record room for a while, you said, that way\nhe can learn the ropes. Burrowing around in century-old, dusty files\nwill be just the thing for a free spirit like Slippery Jim diGriz. Teach\nhim discipline. Show him what the Corps stands for. At the same time it\nwill get the records in shape. They have been needing reorganization for\nquite a while.\"\n\nInskipp opened his mouth, made a choking noise, then closed it. He\nundoubtedly realized that any interruption would only lengthen my\nexplanation, not shorten it. I smiled and nodded at his decision, then\ncontinued.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"So you thought you had me safely out of the way. Breaking my spirit\nunder the guise of 'giving me a little background in the Corps'\nactivities.' In this sense your plan failed. Something else happened\ninstead. I nosed through the files and found them most interesting.\nParticularly the C & M setup--the Categorizer and Memory. That building\nfull of machinery that takes in and digests news and reports from all\nthe planets in the galaxy, indexes it to every category it can possibly\nrelate, then files it. Great machine to work with. I had it digging out\nspaceship info for me, something I have always been interested in--\"\n\n\"You should be,\" Inskipp interrupted rudely. \"You've stolen enough of\nthem in your time.\"\n\nI gave him a hurt look and went on--slowly. \"I won't bore you with all\nthe details, since you seem impatient, but eventually I turned up this\nplan.\" He had it out of my fingers before it cleared my wallet.\n\n\"What are you getting at?\" he mumbled as he ran his eyes over the\nblueprints. \"This is an ordinary heavy-cargo and passenger job. It's no\nmore a Warlord battleship than I am.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is hard to curl your lips with contempt and talk at the same time,\nbut I succeeded. \"Of course. You don't expect them to file warship plans\nwith the League Registry, do you? But, as I said, I know more than a\nlittle bit about ships. It seemed to me this thing was just too big for\nthe use intended. Enough old ships are fuel-wasters, you don't have to\nbuild new ones to do that. This started me thinking and I punched for a\ncomplete list of ships that size that had been constructed in the past.\nYou can imagine my surprise when, after three minutes of groaning, the C\n& M only produced six. One was built for self-sustaining colony attempt\nat the second galaxy. For all we know she is still on the way. The other\nfive were all D-class colonizers, built during the Expansion when large\npopulations were moved. Too big to be practical now.\n\n\"I was still teased, as I had no idea what a ship this large could be\nused for. So I removed the time interlock on the C & M and let it pick\naround through the entire history of space to see if it could find a\ncomparison. It sure did. Right at the Golden Age of Empire expansion,\nthe giant Warlord battleships. The machine even found a blueprint for\nme.\"\n\nInskipp grabbed again and began comparing the two prints. I leaned over\nhis shoulder and pointed out the interesting parts.\n\n\"Notice--if the engine room specs are changed slightly to include this\ncargo hold, there is plenty of room for the brutes needed. This\nsuperstructure--obviously just tacked onto the plans--gets thrown away,\nand turrets take its place. The hulls are identical. A change here, a\nshift there, and the stodgy freighter becomes the fast battlewagon.\nThese changes could be made during construction, then plans filed. By\nthe time anyone in the League found out what was being built the ship\nwould be finished and launched. Of course, this could all be\ncoincidence--the plans of a newly built ship agreeing to six places with\nthose of a ship built a thousand years ago. But if you think so, I will\ngive you hundred-to-one odds you are wrong, any size bet you name.\"\n\nI wasn't winning any sucker bets that night. Inskipp had led just as\ncrooked a youth as I had, and needed no help in smelling a fishy deal.\nWhile he pulled on his clothes he shot questions at me.\n\n\"And the name of the peace-loving planet that is building this bad\nmemory from the past?\"\n\n\"Cittanuvo. Second planet of a B star in Corona Borealis. No other\ncolonized planets in the system.\"\n\n\"Never heard of it,\" Inskipp said as we took the private drop chute to\nhis office. \"Which may be a good or a bad sign. Wouldn't be the first\ntime trouble came from some out-of-the-way spot I never even knew\nexisted.\"\n\nWith the automatic disregard for others of the truly dedicated, he\npressed the scramble button on his desk. Very quickly sleepy-eyed clerks\nand assistants were bringing files and records. We went through them\ntogether.\n\nModesty prevented me from speaking first, but I had a very short wait\nbefore Inskipp reached the same conclusion I had. He hurled a folder the\nlength of the room and scowled out at the harsh dawn light.\n\n\"The more I look at this thing,\" he said, \"the fishier it gets. This\nplanet seems to have no possible motive or use for a battleship. But\nthey are building one--_that_ I will swear on a stack of one thousand\ncredit notes as high as this building. Yet what will they do with it\nwhen they have it built? They have an expanding culture, no\nunemployment, a surplus of heavy metals and ready markets for all they\nproduce. No hereditary enemies, feuds or the like. If it wasn't for this\nbattleship thing, I would call them an ideal League planet. I have to\nknow more about them.\"\n\n\"I've already called the spaceport--in your name of course,\" I told him.\n\"Ordered a fast courier ship. I'll leave within the hour.\"\n\n\"Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself, diGriz,\" he said. Voice\nchill as the icecap. \"I still give the orders and I'll tell you when\nyou're ready for an independent command.\"\n\nI was sweetness and light because a lot depended on his decision. \"Just\ntrying to help, chief, get things ready in case you wanted more info.\nAnd this isn't really an operation, just a reconnaissance. I can do that\nas well as any of the experienced operators. And it may give me the\nexperience I need, so that some day, I, too, will be qualified to join\nthe ranks....\"\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Stop shoveling it on while I can still breathe.\nGet out there. Find out what is going on. Then get back. Nothing\nelse--and that's an order.\"\n\nBy the way he said it, I knew he thought there was little chance of its\nhappening that way. Since my forced induction into the Corps six months\nearlier I had been stuck on this super-secret planetoid that was its\nheadquarters and main base. I had very little sitting-down patience\nanyway, and it had been long since exhausted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt had been interesting at first. Particularly since up until the time\nI was drafted into the Special Corps I wasn't even certain it really\nexisted. It was too much like a con man's nightmare to be real. A secret\nworry. After a few happy years of successful crime you begin to wonder\nhow long it will last. Planetary police are all pushovers and you start\nto feel you can go on forever if they're your only competition. What\nabout the League though? Don't they take any interest in crime? Just\nabout that time you hear your first rumor of the Special Corps and it\nfits the bad dreams. A shadowy, powerful group that slip silently\nbetween the stars, ready to bring the interstellar lawbreaker low.\nSounds like TV drama stuff. I had been quite surprised to find they\nreally existed.\n\nI was even more surprised when I joined them. Of course there was a\nlittle pressure at the time. I had the alternative choice of instant\ndeath. But I still think it was a wise move. Under the motto \"Set a\nthief to catch one,\" the Corps supposedly made good use of men like\nmyself to get rid of the more antisocial types that infest the universe.\n\nThis was still all hearsay to me. I had been pulled into headquarters\nand given routine administration work for training. Six months of this\nhad me slightly ga-ga and I wanted out. Since no one seemed to be in a\nhurry to give me an assignment I had found one for myself. I had no idea\nof what would come if it, but I also had no intention of returning until\nthe job was done.\n\nA quick stop at supply and record sections gave me everything I needed.\nThe sun was barely clear of the horizon when the silver needle of my\nship lifted in the gray field, then blasted into space.\n\nThe trip took only a few days, more than enough time to memorize\neverything I needed to know about Cittanuvo. And the more I knew the\nless I could understand their need for a battleship. It didn't fit.\nCittanuvo was a secondary settlement out of the Cellini system, and I\nhad run into these settlements before. They were all united in a loose\nalliance and bickered a lot among themselves, but never came to blows.\nIf anything, they shared a universal abhorrence of war.\n\nYet they were secretly building a battleship.\n\nSince I was only chasing my tail with this line of thought, I put it out\nof my mind and worked on some tri-di chess problems. This filled the\ntime until Cittanuvo blinked into the bow screen.\n\nOne of my most effective mottoes has always been, \"Secrecy can be an\nobviousity.\" What the magicians call misdirection. Let people very\nobviously see what you want them to see, then they'll never notice what\nis hidden. This was why I landed at midday, on the largest field on the\nplanet, after a very showy approach. I was already dressed for my role,\nand out of the ship before the landing braces stopped vibrating.\nBuckling the fur cape around my shoulders with the platinum clasp, I\nstamped down the ramp. The sturdy little M-3 robot rumbled after me with\nmy bags. Heading directly towards the main gate, I ignored the scurry of\nactivity around the customs building. Only when a uniformed\nunder-official of some kind ran over to me, did I give the field any\nattention.\n\nBefore he could talk I did, foot in the door and stay on top.\n\n\"Beautiful planet you have here. Delightful climate! Ideal spot for a\ncountry home. Friendly people, always willing to help strangers and all\nthat I imagine. That's what I like. Makes me feel grateful. Very pleased\nto meet you. I am the Grand Duke Sant' Angelo.\" I shook his hand\nenthusiastically at this point and let a one hundred credit note slip\ninto his palm.\n\n\"Now,\" I added, \"I wonder if you would ask the customs agents to look at\nmy bags here. Don't want to waste time, do we? The ship is open, they\ncan check that whenever they please.\"\n\nMy manner, clothes, jewelry, the easy way I passed money around and the\nluxurious sheen of my bags, could mean only one thing. There was little\nthat was worth smuggling into or out of Cittanuvo. Certainly nothing a\nrich man would be interested in. The official murmured something with a\nsmile, spoke a few words into his phone, and the job was done.\n\nA small wave of custom men hung stickers on my luggage, peeked into one\nor two for conformity's sake, and waved me through. I shook hands all\naround--a rustling hand-clasp of course--then was on my way. A cab was\nsummoned, a hotel suggested. I nodded agreement and settled back while\nthe robot loaded the bags about me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe ship was completely clean. Everything I might need for the job was\nin my luggage. Some of it quite lethal and explosive, and very\nembarrassing if it was discovered in my bags. In the safety of my hotel\nsuite I made a change of clothes and personality. After the robot had\nchecked the rooms for bugs.\n\nAnd very nice gadgets too, these Corps robots. It looked and acted like\na moron M-3 all the time. It was anything but. The brain was as good as\nany other robot brain I have known, plus the fact that the chunky body\nwas crammed with devices and machines of varying use. It chugged slowly\naround the room, moving my bags and laying out my kit. And all the time\nfollowing a careful route that covered every inch of the suite. When it\nhad finished it stopped and called the all-clear.\n\n\"All rooms checked. Results negative except for one optic bug in that\nwall.\"\n\n\"Should you be pointing like that?\" I asked the robot. \"Might make\npeople suspicious, you know.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" the robot said with mechanical surety. \"I brushed against\nit and it is now unserviceable.\"\n\nWith this assurance I pulled off my flashy clothes and slipped into the\nmidnight black dress uniform of an admiral in the League Grand Fleet. It\ncame complete with decorations, gold bullion, and all the necessary\ndocuments. I thought it a little showy myself, but it was just the thing\nto make the right impression on Cittanuvo. Like many other planets, this\none was uniform-conscious. Delivery boys, street cleaners, clerks--all\nhad to have characteristic uniforms. Much prestige attached to them, and\nmy black dress outfit should rate as high as any uniform in the galaxy.\n\nA long cloak would conceal the uniform while I left the hotel, but the\ngold-encrusted helmet and a brief case of papers were a problem. I had\nnever explored all the possibilities of the pseudo M-3 robot, perhaps it\ncould be of help.\n\n\"You there, short and chunky,\" I called. \"Do you have any concealed\ncompartments or drawers built into your steel hide? If so, let's see.\"\n\nFor a second I thought the robot had exploded. The thing had more\ndrawers in it than a battery of cash registers. Big, small, flat, thin,\nthey shot out on all sides. One held a gun and two more were stuffed\nwith grenades; the rest were empty. I put the hat in one, the brief case\nin another and snapped my fingers. The drawers slid shut and its metal\nhide was as smooth as ever.\n\nI pulled on a fancy sports cap, buckled the cape up tight, and was ready\nto go. The luggage was all booby-trapped and could defend itself. Guns,\ngas, poison needles, the usual sort of thing. In the last resort it\nwould blow itself up. The M-3 went down by a freight elevator. I used a\nback stairs and we met in the street.\n\nSince it was still daylight I didn't take a heli, but rented a groundcar\ninstead. We had a leisurely drive out into the country and reached\nPresident Ferraro's house after dark.\n\nAs befitted the top official of a rich planet, the place was a mansion.\nBut the security precautions were ludicrous to say the least. I took\nmyself and a three hundred fifty kilo robot through the guards and\nalarms without causing the slightest stir. President Ferraro, a\nbachelor, was eating his dinner. This gave me enough undisturbed time to\nsearch his study.\n\nThere was absolutely nothing. Nothing to do with wars or battleships\nthat is. If I had been interested in blackmail I had enough evidence in\nmy hand to support me for life. I was looking for something bigger than\npolitical corruption, however.\n\nWhen Ferraro rolled into his study after dinner the room was dark. I\nheard him murmur something about the servants and fumble for the switch.\nBefore he found it, the robot closed the door and turned on the lights.\nI sat behind his desk, all his personal papers before me--weighted down\nwith a pistol--and as fierce a scowl as I could raise smeared across my\nface. Before he got over the shock I snapped an order at him.\n\n\"Come over here and sit down, _quick_!\"\n\nThe robot hustled him across the room at the same time, so he had no\nchoice except to obey. When he saw the papers on the desk his eyes\nbulged and he just gurgled a little. Before he could recover I threw a\nthick folder in front of him.\n\n\"I am Admiral Thar, League Grand Fleet. These are my credentials. You\nhad better check them.\" Since they were as good as any real admiral's I\ndidn't worry in the slightest. Ferraro went through them as carefully as\nhe could in his rattled state, even checking the seals under UV. It gave\nhim time to regain a bit of control and he used it to bluster.\n\n\"What do you mean by entering my private quarters and burglaring--\"\n\n\"You're in very bad trouble,\" I said in as gloomy a voice as I could\nmuster.\n\nFerraro's tanned face went a dirty gray at my words. I pressed the\nadvantage.\n\n\"I am arresting you for conspiracy, extortion, theft, and whatever other\ncharges develop after a careful review of these documents. Seize him.\"\nThis last order was directed at the robot who was well briefed in its\nrole. It rumbled forward and locked its hand around Ferraro's wrist,\nhandcuff style. He barely noticed.\n\n\"I can explain,\" he said desperately. \"Everything can be explained.\nThere is no need to make such charges. I don't know what papers you have\nthere, so I wouldn't attempt to say they are all forgeries. I have many\nenemies you know. If the League knew the difficulties faced on a\nbackward planet like this....\"\n\n\"That will be entirely enough,\" I snapped, cutting him off with a wave\nof my hand. \"All those questions will be answered by a court at the\nproper time. There is only one question I want an answer to now. Why are\nyou building that battleship?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe man was a great actor. His eyes opened wide, his jaw dropped, he\nsank back into the chair as if he had been tapped lightly with a hammer.\nWhen he managed to speak the words were completely unnecessary; he had\nalready registered every evidence of injured innocence.\n\n\"What battleship!\" he gasped.\n\n\"The Warlord class battleship that is being built at the Cenerentola\nSpaceyards. Disguised behind these blueprints.\" I threw them across the\ndesk to him, and pointed to one corner. \"Those are your initials there,\nauthorizing construction.\"\n\nFerraro still had the baffled act going as he fumbled with the papers,\nexamined the initials and such. I gave him plenty of time. He finally\nput them down, shaking his head.\n\n\"I know nothing about any battleship. These are the plans for a new\ncargo liner. Those are my initials, I recall putting them there.\"\n\nI phrased my question carefully, as I had him right where I wanted him\nnow. \"You deny any knowledge of the Warlord battleship that is being\nbuilt from these modified plans.\"\n\n\"These are the plans for an ordinary passenger-freighter, that is all I\nknow.\"\n\nHis words had the simple innocence of a young child's. Was he ever\ncaught. I sat back with a relaxed sigh and lit a cigar.\n\n\"Wouldn't you be interested in knowing something about that robot who is\nholding you,\" I said. He looked down, as if aware for the first time\nthat the robot had been holding him by the wrist during the interview.\n\"That is no ordinary robot. It has a number of interesting devices built\ninto its fingertips. Thermocouples, galvanometers, things like that.\nWhile you talked it registered your skin temperature, blood pressure,\namount of perspiration and such. In other words it is an efficient and\nfast working lie detector. We will now hear all about your lies.\"\n\nFerraro pulled away from the robot's hand as if it had been a poisonous\nsnake. I blew a relaxed smoke ring. \"Report,\" I said to the robot. \"Has\nthis man told any lies?\"\n\n\"Many,\" the robot said. \"Exactly seventy-four per cent of all statements\nhe made were fake.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" I nodded, throwing the last lock on my trap. \"That means he\nknows all about this battleship.\"\n\n\"The subject has no knowledge of the battleship,\" the robot said coldly.\n\"All of his statements concerning the construction of this ship were\ntrue.\"\n\nNow it was my turn for the gaping and eye-popping act while Ferraro\npulled himself together. He had no idea I wasn't interested in his other\nhanky-panky, but could tell I had had a low blow. It took an effort, but\nI managed to get my mind back into gear and consider the evidence.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIf President Ferraro didn't know about the battleship, he must have\nbeen taken in by the cover-up job. But if he wasn't responsible--who\nwas? Some militaristic clique that meant to overthrow him and take\npower? I didn't know enough about the planet, so I enlisted Ferraro on\nmy side.\n\nThis was easy--even without the threat of exposure of the documents I\nhad found in his files. Using their disclosure as a prod I could have\nmade him jump through hoops. It wasn't necessary. As soon as I showed\nhim the different blueprints and explained the possibilities he\nunderstood. If anything, he was more eager than I was to find out who\nwas using his administration as a cat's-paw. By silent agreement the\ndocuments were forgotten.\n\nWe agreed that the next logical step would be the Cenerentola\nSpaceyards. He had some idea of sniffing around quietly first, trying to\nget a line to his political opponents. I gave him to understand that the\nLeague, and the League Navy in particular, wanted to stop the\nconstruction of the battleship. After that he could play his politics.\nWith this point understood he called his car and squadron of guards and\nwe made a parade to the shipyards. It was a four-hour drive and we made\nplans on the way down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe spaceyard manager was named Rocca, and he was happily asleep when we\narrived. But not for long. The parade of uniforms and guns in the middle\nof the night had him frightened into a state where he could hardly walk.\nI imagine he was as full of petty larceny as Ferraro. No innocent man\ncould have looked so terror stricken. Taking advantage of the situation,\nI latched my motorized lie detector onto him and began snapping the\nquestions.\n\nEven before I had all the answers I began to get the drift of things.\nThey were a little frightening, too. The manager of the spaceyard that\nwas building the ship had no idea of its true nature.\n\nAnyone with less self-esteem than myself--or who had led a more honest\nearly life--might have doubted his own reasoning at that moment. I\ndidn't. The ship on the ways _still_ resembled a warship to six places.\nAnd knowing human nature the way I do, that was too much of a\ncoincidence to expect. Occam's razor always points the way. If there are\ntwo choices to take, take the simpler. In this case I chose the natural\nacquisitive instinct of man as opposed to blind chance and accident.\nNevertheless I put the theory to the test.\n\nLooking over the original blueprints again, the big superstructure hit\nmy eye. In order to turn the ship into a warship that would have to be\none of the first things to go.\n\n\"Rocca!\" I barked, in what I hoped was authentic old space-dog manner.\n\"Look at these plans, at this space-going front porch here. Is it still\nbeing built onto the ship?\"\n\nHe shook his head at once and said, \"No, the plans were changed. We had\nto fit in some kind of new meteor-repelling gear for operating in the\nplanetary debris belt.\"\n\nI flipped through my case and drew out a plan. \"Does your new gear look\nanything like this?\" I asked, throwing it across the table to him.\n\nHe rubbed his jaw while he looked at it. \"Well,\" he said hesitatingly,\n\"I don't want to say for certain. After all these details aren't in my\ndepartment, I'm just responsible for final assembly, not unit work. But\nthis surely looks like the thing they installed. Big thing. Lots of\npower leads--\"\n\nIt was a battleship all right, no doubt of that now. I was mentally\nreaching around to pat myself on the back when the meaning of his words\nsank in.\n\n\"Installed!\" I shouted. \"Did you say installed?\"\n\nRocca collapsed away from my roar and gnawed his nails. \"Yes--\" he said,\n\"not too long ago. I remember there was some trouble....\"\n\n\"And what else!\" I interrupted him. Cold moisture was beginning to\ncollect along my spine now. \"The drives, controls--are they in, too?\"\n\n\"Why, yes,\" he said. \"How did you know? The normal scheduling was\nchanged around, causing a great deal of unnecessary trouble.\"\n\nThe cold sweat was now a running river of fear. I was beginning to have\nthe feeling that I had been missing the boat all along the line. The\noriginal estimated date of completion was nearly a year away. But there\nwas no real reason why that couldn't be changed, too.\n\n\"Cars! Guns!\" I bellowed. \"To the spaceyard. If that ship is anywhere\nnear completion, we are in big, _big_ trouble!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll the bored guards had a great time with the sirens, lights,\naccelerators on the floor and that sort of thing. We blasted a screaming\nhole through the night right to the spaceyard and through the gate.\n\nIt didn't make any difference, we were still too late. A uniformed\nwatchman frantically waved to us and the whole convoy jerked to a stop.\n\nThe ship was gone.\n\nRocca couldn't believe it, neither could the president. They wandered up\nand down the empty ways where it had been built. I just crunched down in\nthe back of the car, chewing my cigar to pieces and cursing myself for\nbeing a fool.\n\nI had missed the obvious fact, being carried away by the thought of a\nplanetary government building a warship. The government was involved for\nsure--but only as a pawn. No little planet-bound political mind could\nhave dreamed up as big a scheme as this. I smelled a rat--a stainless\nsteel one. Someone who operated the way I had done before my conversion.\n\nNow that the rodent was well out of the bag I knew just where to look,\nand had a pretty good idea of what I would find. Rocca, the spaceyard\nmanager, had staggered back and was pulling at his hair, cursing and\ncrying at the same time. President Ferraro had his gun out and was\nstaring at it grimly. It was hard to tell if he was thinking of murder\nor suicide. I didn't care which. All he had to worry about was the next\nelection, when the voters and the political competition would carve him\nup for losing the ship. My troubles were a little bigger.\n\nI had to find the battleship before it blasted its way across the\ngalaxy.\n\n\"Rocca!\" I shouted. \"Get into the car. I want to see your records--_all_\nof your records--and I want to see them right now.\"\n\nHe climbed wearily in and had directed the driver before he fully\nrealized what was happening. Blinking at the sickly light of dawn\nbrought him slowly back to reality.\n\n\"But ... admiral ... the hour! Everyone will be asleep....\"\n\nI just growled, but it was enough. Rocca caught the idea from my\nexpression and grabbed the car phone. The office doors were open when we\ngot there.\n\nNormally I curse the paper tangles of bureaucracy, but this was one time\nwhen I blessed them all. These people had it down to a fine science. Not\na rivet fell, but that its fall was noted--in quintuplicate. And later\nfollowed up with a memo, _rivet, wastage, query_. The facts I needed\nwere all neatly tucked away in their paper catacombs. All I had to do\nwas sniff them out. I didn't try to look for first causes, this would\nhave taken too long. Instead I concentrated my attention on the recent\nmodifications, like the gun turret, that would quickly give me a trail\nto the guilty parties.\n\nOnce the clerks understood what I had in mind they hurled themselves\ninto their work, urged on by the fires of patriotism and the burning\nvoices of their superiors. All I had to do was suggest a line of search\nand the relevant documents would begin appearing at once.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBit by bit a pattern started to emerge. A delicate webwork of forgery,\nbribery, chicanery and falsehood. It could only have been conceived by a\nmind as brilliantly crooked as my own. I chewed my lip with jealousy.\nLike all great ideas, this one was basically simple.\n\nA party or parties unknown had neatly warped the ship construction\nprogram to their own ends. Undoubtedly they had started the program for\nthe giant transport, that would have to be checked later. And once the\nprogram was underway, it had been guided with a skill that bordered on\ngenius. Orders were originated in many places, passed on, changed and\nshuffled. I painfully traced each one to its source. Many times the\nsource was a forgery. Some changes seemed to be unexplainable, until I\nnoticed the officers in question had a temporary secretary while their\nnormal assistants were ill. All the girls had food poisoning, a regular\nepidemic it seemed. Each of them in turn had been replaced by the same\ngirl. She stayed just long enough in each position to see that the\nbattleship plan moved forward one more notch.\n\nThis girl was obviously the assistant to the Mastermind who originated\nthe scheme. He sat in the center of the plot, like a spider on its web,\npulling the strings that set things into motion. My first thought that a\ngang was involved proved wrong. All my secondary suspects turned out to\nbe simple forgeries, not individuals. In the few cases where forgery\nwasn't adequate, my mysterious _X_ had apparently hired himself to do\nthe job. _X_ himself had the permanent job of Assistant Engineering\nDesigner. One by one the untangled threads ran to this office. He also\nhad a secretary whose \"illnesses\" coincided with her employment in other\noffices.\n\nWhen I straightened up from my desk the ache in my back stabbed like a\nhot wire. I swallowed a painkiller and looked around at my drooping,\nsack-eyed assistants who had shared the sleepless seventy-two hour task.\nThey sat or slumped against the furniture, waiting for my conclusions.\nEven President Ferraro was there, his hair looking scraggly where he had\npulled out handfuls.\n\n\"You've found them, the criminal ring?\" he asked, his fingers groping\nover his scalp for a fresh hold.\n\n\"I have found them, yes,\" I said hoarsely. \"But not a criminal ring. An\ninspired master criminal--who apparently has more executive ability in\none ear lobe than all your bribe-bloated bureaucrats--and his female\nassistant. They pulled the entire job by themselves. His name, or\nundoubtedly pseudoname, is Pepe Nero. The girl is called Angelina....\"\n\n\"Arrest them at once! Guards ... guards--\" Ferraro's voice died away as\nhe ran out of the room. I talked to his vanishing back.\n\n\"That is just what we intend to do, but it's a little difficult at the\nmoment since they are the ones who not only built the battleship, but\nundoubtedly stole it as well. It was fully automated so no crew is\nnecessary.\"\n\n\"What do you plan to do?\" one of the clerks asked.\n\n\"I shall do nothing,\" I told him, with the snapped precision of an old\nspace dog. \"The League fleet is already closing in on the renegades and\nyou will be informed of the capture. Thank you for your assistance.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI threw them as snappy a salute as I could muster and they filed out.\nStaring gloomily at their backs I envied for one moment their simple\nfaith in the League Navy. When in reality the vengeful fleet was just as\nimaginary as my admiral's rating. This was still a job for the Corps.\nInskipp would have to be given the latest information at once. I had\nsent him a psigram about the theft, but there was no answer as yet.\nMaybe the identity of the thieves would stir some response out of him.\n\nMy message was in code, but it could be quickly broken if someone wanted\nto try hard enough. I took it to the message center myself. The psiman\nwas in his transparent cubicle and I locked myself in with him. His eyes\nwere unfocused as he spoke softly into a mike, pulling in a message\nfrom somewhere across the galaxy. Outside the rushing transcribers\ncopied, coded and filed messages, but no sound penetrated the insulated\nwall. I waited until his attention clicked back into the room, and\nhanded him the sheets of paper.\n\n\"League Central 14--rush,\" I told him.\n\nHe raised his eyebrows, but didn't ask any questions. Establishing\ncontact only took a few seconds, as they had an entire battery of psimen\nfor their communications. He read the code words carefully, shaping them\nwith his mouth but not speaking aloud, the power of his thoughts\ncarrying across the light-years of distance. As soon as he was finished\nI took back the sheet, tore it up and pocketed the pieces.\n\nI had my answer back quickly enough, Inskipp must have been hovering\naround waiting for my message. The mike was turned off to the\ntranscribers outside, and I took the code groups down in shorthand\nmyself.\n\n\"... xybb dfil fdno, and if you don't--don't come back!\"\n\nThe message broke into clear at the end and the psiman smiled as he\nspoke the words. I broke the point off my stylus and growled at him not\nto repeat _any_ of this message, as it was classified, and I would\npersonally see him shot if he did. That got rid of the smile, but didn't\nmake me feel any better.\n\nThe decoded message turned out not to be as bad as I had imagined. Until\nfurther notice I was in charge of tracking and capturing the stolen\nbattleship. I could call on the League for any aid I needed. I would\nkeep my identity as an admiral for the rest of the job. I was to keep\nhim informed of progress. Only those ominous last words in clear kept my\nhappiness from being complete.\n\nI had been handed my long-awaited assignment. But translated into simple\nterms my orders were to get the battleship, or it would be my neck.\nNever a word about my efforts in uncovering the plot in the first place.\nThis is a heartless world we live in.\n\nThis moment of self-pity relaxed me and I immediately went to bed. Since\nmy main job now was waiting, I could wait just as well asleep.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd waiting was all I could do. Of course there were secondary tasks,\nsuch as ordering a Naval cruiser for my own use, and digging for more\ninformation on the thieves, but these really were secondary to my main\npurpose. Which was waiting for bad news. There was no place I could go\nthat would be better situated for the chase than Cittanuvo. The missing\nship could have gone in any direction. With each passing minute the\nsphere of probable locations grew larger by the power of the squared\ncube. I kept the on-watch crew of the cruiser at duty stations and\nconfined the rest within a one hundred yard radius of the ship.\n\nThere was little more information on Pepe and Angelina, they had\ncovered their tracks well. Their origin was unknown, though the fact\nthey both talked with a slight accent suggested an off-world origin.\nThere was one dim picture of Pepe, chubby but looking too grim to be a\nhappy fat boy. There was no picture of the girl. I shuffled the meager\nfindings, controlled my impatience, and kept the ship's psiman busy\npulling in all the reports of any kind of trouble in space. The\nnavigator and I plotted their locations in his tank, comparing the\npositions in relation to the growing sphere that enclosed all the\npossible locations of the stolen ship. Some of the disasters and\napparent accidents hit inside this area, but further investigation\nproved them all to have natural causes.\n\nI had left standing orders that all reports falling inside the danger\narea were to be brought to me at any time. The messenger woke me from a\ndeep sleep, turning on the light and handing me the slip of paper. I\nblinked myself awake, read the first two lines, and pressed the _action\nstation_ alarm over my bunk. I'll say this, the Navy boys know their\nbusiness. When the sirens screamed, the crew secured ship and blasted\noff before I had finished reading the report. As soon as my eyeballs\nunsquashed back into focus I read it through, then once more, carefully,\nfrom the beginning.\n\nIt looked like the one we had been waiting for. There were no witnesses\nto the tragedy, but a number of monitor stations had picked up the\ndischarge static of a large energy weapon being fired. Triangulation had\nlead investigators to the spot where they found a freighter, _Ogget's\nDream_, with a hole punched through it as big as a railroad tunnel. The\nfreighter's cargo of plutonium was gone.\n\nI read _Pepe_ in every line of the message. Since he was flying an\nundermanned battleship, he had used it in the most efficient way\npossible. If he attempted to negotiate or threaten another ship, the\nelement of chance would be introduced. So he had simply roared up to the\nunsuspecting freighter and blasted her with the monster guns his\nbattleship packed. All eighteen men aboard had been killed instantly.\nThe thieves were now murderers.\n\nI was under pressure now to act. And under a greater pressure not to\nmake any mistakes. Roly-poly Pepe had shown himself to be a ruthless\nkiller. He knew what he wanted--then reached out and took it. Destroying\nanyone who stood in his way. More people would die before this was over,\nit was up to me to keep that number as small as possible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIdeally I should have rushed out the fleet with guns blazing and dragged\nhim to justice. Very nice, and I wished it could be done that way.\nExcept where was he? A battleship may be gigantic on some terms of\nreference, but in the immensity of the galaxy it is microscopically\ninfinitesimal. As long as it stayed out of the regular lanes of\ncommerce, and clear of detector stations and planets, it would never be\nfound.\n\nThen how _could_ I find it--and having found it, catch it? When the\ninfernal thing was more than a match for any ship it might meet. That\nwas my problem. It had kept me awake nights and talking to myself days,\nsince there was no easy answer.\n\nI had to construct a solution, slowly and carefully. Since I couldn't be\nsure where Pepe was going to be next, I had to make him go where I\nwanted him to.\n\nThere were some things in my favor. The most important was the fact I\nhad forced him to make his play before he was absolutely ready. It\nwasn't chance that he had left the same day I arrived on Cittanuvo. Any\nplan as elaborate as his certainly included warning of approaching\ndanger. The drive on the battleship, as well as controls and primary\narmament had been installed weeks before I showed up. Much of the\nsubsidiary work remained to be done when the ship had left. One witness\nof the theft had graphically described the power lines and cables\ndangling from the ship's locks when she lifted.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMy arrival had forced Pepe off balance. Now I had to keep pushing until\nhe fell. This meant I had to think as he did, fall into his plan, think\nahead--then trap him. Set a thief to catch a thief. A great theory, only\nI felt uncomfortably on the spot when I tried to put it into practice.\n\nA drink helped, as did a cigar. Puffing on it, staring at the smooth\nbulkhead, relaxed me a bit. After all--there aren't that many things\nyou can do with a battleship. You can't run a big con, blow safes or\nmake burmedex with it. It is hell-on-jets for space piracy, but that's\nabout all.\n\n\"Great, great--but why a battleship?\"\n\nI was talking to myself, normally a bad sign, but right now I didn't\ncare. The mood of space piracy had seized me and I had been going along\nfine. Until this glaring inconsistency jumped out and hit me square in\nthe eye.\n\nWhy a battleship? Why all the trouble and years of work to get a ship\nthat two people could just barely manage? With a tenth of the effort\nPepe could have had a cruiser that would have suited his purposes just\nas well.\n\nJust as good for space piracy, that is--but not for _his_ purposes. He\nhad wanted a battleship, and he had gotten himself a battleship. Which\nmeant he had more in mind than simple piracy. What? It was obvious that\nPepe was a monomaniac, an egomaniac, and as psychotic as a shorted\ncomputer. Some day the mystery of how he had slipped through the screen\nof official testing would have to be investigated. That wasn't my\nconcern now. He still had to be caught.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA plan was beginning to take shape in my head, but I didn't rush it.\nFirst I had to be sure that I knew him well. Any man that can con an\nentire world into building a battleship for him--then steal it from\nthem--is not going to stop there. The ship would need a crew, a base for\nrefueling and a mission.\n\nFuel had been taken care of first, the gutted hull of _Ogget's Dream_\nwas silent witness to that. There were countless planets that could be\nused as a base. Getting a crew would be more difficult in these peaceful\ntimes, although I could think of a few answers to that one, too. Raid\nthe mental hospitals and jails. Do that often enough and you would have\na crew that would make any pirate chief proud. Though piracy was, of\ncourse, too mean an ambition to ascribe to this boy. Did he want to rule\na whole planet--or maybe an entire system? Or more? I shuddered a bit as\nthe thought hit me. Was there really anything that could stop a plan\nlike this once it got rolling? During the Kingly Wars any number of\ntypes with a couple of ships and less brains than Pepe had set up just\nthis kind of empire. They were all pulled down in the end, since their\nsuccess depended on one-man rule. But the price that had to be paid\nfirst!\n\nThis was the plan and I felt in my bones that I was right. I might be\nwrong on some of the minor details, they weren't important. I knew the\ngeneral outline of the idea, just as when I bumped into a mark I knew\nhow much he could be taken for, and just how to do it. There are natural\nlaws in crime as in every other field of human endeavor. I _knew_ this\nwas it.\n\n\"Get the Communications Officer in here at once,\" I shouted at the\nintercom. \"Also a couple of clerks with transcribers. And fast--this is\na matter of life or death!\" This last had a hollow ring, and I realized\nmy enthusiasm had carried me out of character. I buttoned my collar,\nstraightened my ribbons and squared my shoulders. By the time they\nknocked on the door I was all admiral again.\n\nActing on my orders the ship dropped out of warpdrive so our psiman\ncould get through to the other operators. Captain Steng grumbled as we\nfloated there with the engines silent, wasting precious days, while half\nhis crew was involved in getting out what appeared to be insane\ninstructions. My plan was beyond his understanding. Which is, of course,\nwhy he is a captain and I'm an admiral, even a temporary one.\n\nFollowing my orders, the navigator again constructed a sphere of\nspeculation in his tank. The surface of the sphere contacted all the\nstar systems a days flight ahead of the maximum flight of the stolen\nbattleship. There weren't too many of these at first and the psiman\ncould handle them all, calling each in turn and sending by news releases\nto the Naval Public Relations officers there. As the sphere kept growing\nhe started to drop behind, steadily losing ground. By this time I had a\ngeneral release prepared, along with directions for use and follow up,\nwhich he sent to Central 14. The battery of psimen there contacted the\nindividual planets and all we had to do was keep adding to the list of\nplanets.\n\nThe release and follow-ups all harped on one theme. I expanded on it,\nwaxed enthusiastic, condemned it, and worked it into an interview. I\nwrote as many variations as I could, so it could be slipped into as many\ndifferent formats as possible. In one form or another I wanted the basic\ninformation in every magazine, newspaper and journal inside that\nexpanding sphere.\n\n\"What in the devil does this nonsense _mean_?\" Captain Steng asked\npeevishly. He had long since given up the entire operation as a futile\none, and spent most of the time in his cabin worrying about the affect\nof it on his service record. Boredom or curiosity had driven him out,\nand he was reading one of my releases with horror.\n\n\"Billionaire to found own world ... space yacht filled with luxuries to\nlast a hundred years,\" the captain's face grew red as he flipped through\nthe stack of notes. \"What connection does this tripe have with catching\nthose murderers?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen we were alone he was anything but courteous to me, having assured\nhimself by not-too-subtle questioning that I was a spurious admiral.\nThere was no doubt I was still in charge, but our relationship was\nanything but formal.\n\n\"This tripe and nonsense,\" I told him, \"is the bait that will snag our\nfish. A trap for Pepe and his partner in crime.\"\n\n\"Who is this mysterious billionaire?\"\n\n\"Me,\" I said. \"I've always wanted to be rich.\"\n\n\"But this ship, the space yacht, where is it?\"\n\n\"Being built now in the naval shipyard at Udrydde. We're almost ready to\ngo there now, soon as this batch of instructions goes out.\"\n\nCaptain Steng dropped the releases onto the table, then carefully wiped\nhis hands off to remove any possible infection. He was trying to be fair\nand considerate of my views, and not succeeding in the slightest.\n\n\"It doesn't make sense,\" he growled. \"How can you be sure this killer\nwill ever read one of these things. And if he does--why should he be\ninterested? It looks to me as if you are wasting time while he slips\nthrough your fingers. The alarm should be out and every ship notified.\nThe Navy alerted and patrols set on all spacelanes--\"\n\n\"Which he could easily avoid by going around, or better yet not even\nbother about, since he can lick any ship we have. That's not the\nanswer,\" I told him. \"This Pepe is smart and as tricky as a fixed\ngambling machine. That's his strength--and his weakness as well.\nCharacters like that never think it possible for someone else to\noutthink them. Which is what _I'm_ going to do.\"\n\n\"Modest, aren't you,\" Steng said.\n\n\"I try not to be,\" I told him. \"False modesty is the refuge of the\nincompetent. I'm going to catch this thug and I'll tell you how I'll do\nit. He's going to hit again soon, and wherever he hits there will be\nsome kind of a periodical with my plant in it. Whatever else he is\nafter, he is going to take all of the magazines and papers he can find.\nPartly to satisfy his own ego, but mostly to keep track of the things he\nis interested in. Such as ship sailings.\"\n\n\"You're just guessing--you don't know all this.\"\n\nHis automatic assumption of my incompetence was beginning to get me\nannoyed. I bridled my temper and tried one last time.\n\n\"Yes, I'm guessing--an informed guess--but I do know some facts as well.\n_Ogget's Dream_ was cleaned out of all reading matter, that was one of\nthe first things I checked. We can't stop the battleship from attacking\nagain, but we can see to it that the time after that she sails into a\ntrap.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" the captain said, \"it sounds to me like....\"\n\nI never heard what it sounded like, which is all right since he was\ngetting under my skin and might have been tempted to pull my\npseudo-rank. The alarm sirens cut his sentence off and we foot-raced to\nthe communications room.\n\nCaptain Steng won by a nose, it was his ship and he knew all the\nshortcuts. The psiman was holding out a transcription, but he summed it\nup in one sentence. He looked at me while he talked and his face was\nhard and cold.\n\n\"They hit again, knocked out a Navy supply satellite, thirty-four men\ndead.\"\n\n\"If your plan doesn't work, _admiral_,\" the captain whispered hoarsely\nin my ear, \"I'll personally see that you're flayed alive!\"\n\n\"If my plan doesn't work, _captain_--there won't be enough of my skin\nleft to pick up with a tweezer. Now if you please, I'd like to get to\nUdrydde and pick up my ship as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe easy-going hatred and contempt of all my associates had annoyed me,\nthrown me off balance. I was thinking with anger now, not with logic.\nForcing a bit of control, I ordered my thoughts, checking off a mental\nlist.\n\n\"Belay that last command,\" I shouted, getting back into my old space-dog\nmood. \"Get a call through first and find out if any of our plants were\npicked up during the raid.\"\n\nWhile the psiman unfocused his eyes and mumbled under his breath I\nriffled some papers, relaxed and cool. The ratings and officers waited\ntensely, and made some slight attempt to conceal their hatred of me. It\ntook about ten minutes to get an answer.\n\n\"Affirmative,\" the psiman said. \"A store ship docked there twenty hours\nbefore the attack. Among other things, it left newspapers containing the\narticle.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" I said calmly. \"Send a general order to suspend all future\nactivity with the planted releases. Send it by psimen only, no mention\non any other Naval signaling equipment, there's a good chance now it\nmight be 'overheard.'\"\n\nI strolled out slowly, in command of the situation. Keeping my face\nturned away so they couldn't see the cold sweat.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a fast run to Udrydde where my billionaire's yacht, the\n_Eldorado_, was waiting. The dockyard commander showed me the ship, and\nmade a noble effort to control his curiosity. I took a sadistic revenge\non the Navy by not telling him a word about my mission. After checking\nout the controls and special apparatus with the technicians, I cleared\nthe ship. There was a tape in the automatic navigator that would put me\non the course mentioned in all the articles, just a press of a button\nand I would be on my way. I pressed the button.\n\nIt was a beautiful ship, and the dockyard had been lavish with their\nattention to detail. From bow to rear tubes she was plated in pure gold.\nThere are other metals with a higher albedo, but none that give a richer\neffect. All the fittings, inside and out, were either machine-turned or\nplated. All this work could not have been done in the time allotted, the\nNavy must have adapted a luxury yacht to my needs.\n\nEverything was ready. Either Pepe would make his move--or I would sail\non to my billionaire's paradise planet. If that happened, it would be\nbest if I stayed there.\n\nNow that I was in space, past the point of no return, all the doubts\nthat I had dismissed fought for attention. The plan that had seemed so\nclear and logical now began to look like a patched and crazy makeshift.\n\n\"Hold on there, sailor,\" I said to myself. Using my best admiral's\nvoice. \"Nothing has changed. It's still the best and _only_ plan\npossible under the circumstances.\"\n\nWas it? Could I be sure that Pepe, flying his mountain of a ship and\neating Navy rations, would be interested in some of the comforts and\nluxuries of life? Or if the luxuries didn't catch his eye, would he be\ninterested in the planetary homesteading gear? I had loaded the cards\nwith all the things he might want, and planted the information where he\ncould get it. He had the bait now--but would he grab the hook?\n\nI couldn't tell. And I could work myself into a neurotic state if I kept\nrunning through the worry cycle. It took an effort to concentrate on\nanything else, but it had to be made. The next four days passed very\nslowly.\n\nWhen the alarm blew off, all I felt was an intense sensation of relief.\nI might be dead and blasted to dust in the next few minutes, but that\ndidn't seem to make much difference.\n\nPepe had swallowed the bait. There was only one ship in the galaxy that\ncould knock back a blip that big at such a distance. It was closing\nfast, using the raw energy of the battleship engines for a headlong\napproach. My ship bucked a bit as the tug-beams locked on at maximum\ndistance. The radio bleeped at me for attention at the same time. I\nwaited as long as I dared, then flipped it on. The voice boomed out.\n\n\"... That you are under the guns of a warship! Don't attempt to run,\nsignal, take evasive action, or in any other way....\"\n\n\"Who are you--and what the devil do you want?\" I spluttered into the\nmike. I had my scanner on, so they could see me, but my own screen\nstayed dark. They weren't sending any picture. In a way it made my act\neasier, I just played to an unseen audience. They could see the rich cut\nof my clothes, the luxurious cabin behind me. Of course they couldn't\nsee my hands.\n\n\"It doesn't matter who we are,\" the radio boomed again. \"Just obey\norders if you care to live. Stay away from the controls until we have\ntied on, then do exactly as I say.\"\n\nThere were two distant clangs as magnetic grapples hit the hull. A\nlittle later the ship lurched, drawn home against the battleship. I let\nmy eyes roll in fear, looking around for a way to escape--and taking a\npeek at the outside scanners. The yacht was flush against the\nspace-filling bulk of the other ship. I pressed the button that sent the\ntorch-wielding robot on his way.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now let me tell you something,\" I snapped into the mike, wiping away\nthe worried billionaire expression. \"First I'll repeat your own\nwarning--obey orders if you want to live. I'll show you why----\"\n\nWhen I threw the big switch a carefully worked out sequence took place.\nFirst, of course, the hull was magnetized and the bombs fused. A light\nblinked as the scanner in the cabin turned off, and the one in the\ngenerator room came on. I checked the monitor screen to make sure, then\nstarted into the spacesuit. It had to be done fast, at the same time it\nwas necessary to talk naturally. They must still think of me as sitting\nin the control room.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"That's the ship's generators you're looking at,\" I said. \"Ninety-eight\nper cent of their output is now feeding into coils that make an\nelectromagnet of this ship's hull. You will find it very hard to\nseparate us. And I would advise you not to try.\"\n\nThe suit was on, and I kept the running chatter up through the mike in\nthe helmet, relaying to the ship's transmitter. The scene in the monitor\nreceiver changed.\n\n\"You are now looking at a hydrogen bomb that is primed and aware of the\nmagnetic field holding our ships together. It will, of course, go off if\nyou try to pull away.\"\n\nI grabbed up the monitor receiver and ran towards the air lock.\n\n\"This is a different bomb now,\" I said, keeping one eye on the screen\nand the other on the slowly opening outer door. \"This one has receptors\non the hull. Attempt to destroy any part of this ship, or even gain\nentry to it, and this one will detonate.\"\n\nI was in space now, leaping across to the gigantic wall of the other\nship.\n\n\"What do you want?\" These were the first words Pepe had spoken since his\nfirst threats.\n\n\"I want to talk to you, arrange a deal. Something that would be\nprofitable for both of us. But let me first show you the rest of the\nbombs, so you won't get any strange ideas about co-operating.\"\n\nOf course I _had_ to show him the rest of the bombs, there was no\ngetting out of it. The scanners in the ship were following a planned\nprogram. I made light talk about all my massive armament that would\ncarry us both to perdition, while I climbed through the hole in the\nbattleship's hull. There was no armor or warning devices at this spot,\nit had been chosen carefully from the blueprints.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah ... I take your word for it, you're a flying bomb. So stop\nwith this roving reporter bit and tell me what you have in mind.\"\n\nThis time I didn't answer him, because I was running and panting like a\ndog, and had the mike turned off. Just ahead, if the blueprints were\nright, was the door to the control room. Pepe should be there.\n\nI stepped through, gun out, and pointed it at the back of his head.\nAngelina stood next to him, looking at the screen.\n\n\"The game's over,\" I said. \"Stand up slowly and keep your hands in\nsight.\"\n\n\"What do you mean,\" he said angrily, looking at the screen in front of\nhim. The girl caught wise first. She spun around and pointed.\n\n\"He's _here_!\"\n\nThey both stared, gaped at me, caught off guard and completely\nunprepared.\n\n\"You're under arrest, crime-king,\" I told him. \"And your girl friend.\"\n\nAngelina rolled her eyes up and slid slowly to the floor. Real or faked,\nI didn't care. I kept the gun on Pepe's pudgy form while he picked her\nup and carried her to an acceleration couch against the wall.\n\n\"What ... what will happen now?\" He quavered the question. His pouchy\njaws shook and I swear there were tears in his eyes. I was not impressed\nby his acting since I could clearly remember the dead men floating in\nspace. He stumbled over to a chair, half dropping into it.\n\n\"Will they do anything to me?\" Angelina asked. Her eyes were open now.\n\n\"I have no idea of what will happen to you,\" I told her truthfully.\n\"That is up to the courts to decide.\"\n\n\"But he _made_ me do all those things,\" she wailed. She was young, dark\nand beautiful, the tears did nothing to spoil this.\n\nPepe dropped his face into his hands and his shoulders shook. I flicked\nthe gun his way and snapped at him.\n\n\"Sit up, Pepe. I find it very hard to believe that you are crying. There\nare some Naval ships on the way now, the automatic alarm was triggered\nabout a minute ago. I'm sure they'll be glad to see the man who....\"\n\n\"Don't let them take me, please!\" Angelina was on her feet now, her back\npressed to the wall. \"They'll put me in prison, do things to my mind!\"\nShe shrunk away as she spoke, stumbling along the wall. I looked back at\nPepe, not wanting to have my eyes off him for an instant.\n\n\"There's nothing I can do,\" I told her. I glanced her way and a small\ndoor was swinging open and she was gone.\n\n\"Don't try to run,\" I shouted after her, \"it can't do any good!\"\n\nPepe made a strangling noise and I looked back to him quickly. He was\nsitting up now and his face was dry of tears. In fact he was laughing,\nnot crying.\n\n\"So she caught you, too, Mr. Wise-cop, poor little Angelina with the\nsoft eyes.\" He broke down again, shaking with laughter.\n\n\"What do you mean,\" I growled.\n\n\"Don't you catch yet? The story she told you was true--except she\ntwisted it around a bit. The whole plan, building the battleship, then\nstealing it, was _hers_. She pulled me into it, played me like an\naccordion. I fell in love with her, hating myself and happy at the same\ntime. Well--I'm glad now it's over. At least I gave her a chance to get\naway, I owe her that much. Though I thought I would explode when she\nwent into that innocence act!\"\n\nThe cold feeling was now a ball of ice that threatened to paralyze me.\n\"You're lying,\" I said hoarsely, and even I didn't believe it.\n\n\"Sorry. That's the way it is. Your brain-boys will pick my skull to\npieces and find out the truth anyway. There's no point in lying now.\"\n\n\"We'll search the ship, she can't hide for long.\"\n\n\"She won't have to,\" Pepe said. \"There's a fast scout we picked up,\nstowed in one of the holds. That must be it leaving now.\" We could feel\nthe vibration, distantly through the floor.\n\n\"The Navy will get her,\" I told him, with far more conviction than I\nfelt.\n\n\"Maybe,\" he said, suddenly slumped and tired, no longer laughing. \"Maybe\nthey will. But I gave her her chance. It is all over for me now, but she\nknows that I loved her to the end.\" He bared his teeth in sudden pain.\n\"Not that she will care in the slightest.\"\n\nI kept the gun on him and neither of us moved while the Navy ships\npulled up and their boots stamped outside. I had captured my battleship\nand the raids were over. And I couldn't be blamed if the girl had\nslipped away. If she evaded the Navy ships, that was their fault, not\nmine.\n\nI had my victory all right.\n\nThen why did it taste like ashes in my mouth?\n\nIt's a big galaxy, but it wasn't going to be big enough to hide Angelina\nnow. I can be conned once--but only once. The next time we met things\nwere going to be _very_ different.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note\n\nThis etext was produced from _Astounding Science Fiction_ April 1960.\nExtensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright\non this publication was renewed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
