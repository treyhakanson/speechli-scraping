B. FYFE\n\n                       ILLUSTRATED BY EMSH\n\n\n      The Dome of Eyes made it almost impossible for Terrans\n      to reach the world of Tepokt. For those who did land\n      there, there was no returning--only the bitterness of\n      respect--and justice!\n\n\nThe Tepoktan student, whose blue robe in George Kinton's opinion clashed\nwith the dull purple of his scales, twiddled a three-clawed hand for\nattention. Kinton nodded to him from his place on the dais before the\ngroup.\n\n\"Then you can give us no precise count of the stars in the galaxy,\nGeorge?\"\n\nKinton smiled wrily, and ran a wrinkled hand through his graying hair.\nIn the clicking Tepoktan speech, his name came out more like \"Chortch.\"\n\nQuestions like this had been put to him often during the ten years since\nhis rocket had hurtled through the meteorite belt and down to the\nsurface of Tepokt, leaving him the only survivor. Barred off as they\nwere from venturing into space, the highly civilized Tepoktans\nconstantly displayed the curiosity of dreamers in matters related to the\nuniverse. Because of the veil of meteorites and satellite fragments\nwhirling about their planet, their astronomers had acquired torturous\nskills but only scraps of real knowledge.\n\n\"As I believe I mentioned in some of my recorded lectures,\" Kinton\nanswered in their language, \"the number is actually as vast as it seems\nto those of you peering through the Dome of Eyes. The scientists of my\nrace have not yet encountered any beings capable of estimating the\ntotal.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe leaned back and scanned the faces of his interviewers, faces that\nwould have been oddly humanoid were it not for the elongated snouts and\npointed, sharp-toothed jaws. The average Tepoktan was slightly under\nKinton's height of five-feet-ten, with a long, supple trunk. Under the\nrobes their scholars affected, the shortness of their two bowed legs was\nnot obvious; but the sight of the short, thick arms carried high before\ntheir chests still left Kinton with a feeling of misproportion.\n\nHe should be used to it after ten years, he thought, but even the reds\nor purples of the scales or the big teeth seemed more natural.\n\n\"I sympathize with your curiosity,\" he added. \"It is a marvel that your\nscientists have managed to measure the distances of so many stars.\"\n\nHe could tell that they were pleased by his admiration, and wondered yet\nagain why any little show of approval by him was so eagerly received.\nEven though he was the first stellar visitor in their recorded history,\nKinton remained conscious of the fact that in many fields he was unable\nto offer the Tepoktans any new ideas. In one or two ways, he believed,\nno Terran could teach their experts anything.\n\n\"Then will you tell us, George, more about the problems of your first\nspace explorers?\" came another question.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore Kinton had formed his answer, the golden curtains at the rear of\nthe austerely simple chamber parted. Klaft, the Tepoktan serving the\ncurrent year as Kinton's chief aide, hurried toward the dais. The\ntwenty-odd members of the group fell silent on their polished stone\nbenches, turning their pointed visages to follow Klaft's progress.\n\nThe aide reached Kinton and bent to hiss and cluck into the latter's ear\nin what he presumably considered an undertone. The Terran laboriously\nspelled out the message inscribed on the limp, satiny paper held before\nhis eyes. Then he rose and took one step toward the waiting group.\n\n\"I regret I shall have to conclude this discussion,\" he announced. \"I\nam informed that another ship from space has reached the surface of\nTepokt. My presence is requested in case the crew are of my own planet.\"\n\nKlaft excitedly skipped down to lead the way up the aisle, but Kinton\nhesitated. Those in the audience were scholars or officials to whom\nattendance at one of Kinton's limited number of personal lectures was\nawarded as an honor.\n\nThey would hardly learn anything from him directly that was not\navailable in recordings made over the course of years. The Tepoktan\nscientists, historians, and philosophers had respectfully but eagerly\ngathered every crumb of information Kinton knowingly had to offer--and\nsome he thought he had forgotten. Still ... he sensed the disappointment\nat his announcement.\n\n\"I shall arrange for you to await my return here in town,\" Kinton said,\nand there were murmurs of pleasure.\n\nLater, aboard the jet helicopter that was basically like those Kinton\nremembered using on Terra twenty light years away, he shook his head at\nKlaft's respectful protest.\n\n\"But George! It was enough that they were present when you received the\nnews. They can talk about that the rest of their lives! You must not\nwaste your strength on these people who come out of curiosity.\"\n\nKinton smiled at his aide's earnest concern. Then he turned to look out\nthe window as he recalled the shadow that underlay such remonstrances.\nHe estimated that he was about forty-eight now, as nearly as he could\ntell from the somewhat longer revolutions of Tepokt. The time would come\nwhen he would age and die. Whose wishes would then prevail?\n\nMaybe he was wrong, he thought. Maybe he shouldn't stand in the way of\ntheir biologists and surgeons. But he'd rather be buried, even if that\nleft them with only what he could tell them about the human body.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo help himself forget the rather preoccupied manner in which some of\nthe Tepoktan scientists occasionally eyed him, he peered down at the big\ndam of the hydro-electric project being completed to Kinton's design.\nPower from this would soon light the town built to house the staff of\nscientists, students, and workers assigned to the institute organized\nabout the person of Kinton.\n\nNow, there was an example of their willingness to repay him for whatever\nhelp he had been, he reflected. They hadn't needed that for themselves.\n\nIn some ways, compared to those of Terra, the industries of Tepokt were\nunderdeveloped. In the first place, the population was smaller and had\ndifferent standards of luxury. In the second, a certain lack of drive\nresulted from the inability to break out into interplanetary space.\nKinton had been inexplicably lucky to have reached the surface even in\na battered hulk. The shell of meteorites was at least a hundred miles\nthick and constantly shifting.\n\n\"We do not know if they have always been meteorites,\" the Tepoktans had\ntold Kinton, \"or whether part of them come from a destroyed satellite;\nbut our observers have proved mathematically that no direct path through\nthem may be predicted more than a very short while in advance.\"\n\nKinton turned away from the window as he caught the glint of Tepokt's\nsun upon the hull of the spaceship they had also built for him. Perhaps\n... would it be fair to encourage the newcomer to attempt the barrier?\n\nFor ten years, Kinton had failed to work up any strong desire to try it.\nThe Tepoktans called the ever-shifting lights the Dome of Eyes, after\na myth in which each tiny satellite bright enough to be visible was\nsupposed to watch over a single individual on the surface. Like their\nbrothers on Terra, the native astronomers could trace their science back\nto a form of astrology; and Kinton often told them jokingly that he felt\nno urge to risk a physical encounter with his own personal Eye.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe helicopter started to descend, and Kinton remembered that the city\nnamed in his message was only about twenty miles from his home. The\nbrief twilight of Tepokt was passing by the time he set foot on the\nlanding field, and he paused to look up.\n\nThe brighter stars visible from this part of the planet twinkled back at\nhim, and he knew that each was being scrutinized by some amateur or\nprofessional astronomer. Before an hour had elapsed, most of them would\nbe obscured by the tiny moonlets, some of which could already be seen.\nThese could easily be mistaken for stars or the other five planets of\nthe system, but in a short while the tinier ones in groups would cause\na celestial haze resembling a miniature Milky Way.\n\nKlaft, who had descended first, leaving the pilot to bring up the rear,\nnoticed Kinton's pause.\n\n\"Glory glitters till it is known for a curse,\" he remarked, quoting a\nTepoktan proverb often applied by the disgruntled scientists to the Dome\nof Eyes.\n\nKinton observed, however, that his aide also stared upward for a long\nmoment. The Tepoktans loved speculating about the unsolvable. They had\neven founded clubs to argue whether two satellites had been destroyed or\nonly one.\n\nHalf a dozen officials hastened up to escort the party to the vehicle\nawaiting Kinton. Klaft succeeded in quieting the lesser members of the\ndelegation so that Kinton was able to learn a few facts about the new\narrival. The crash had been several hundred miles away, but someone had\nthought of the hospital in this city which was known to have a doctor\nrating as an expert in human physiology. The survivor--only one occupant\nof the wreck, alive or dead, had been discovered--had accordingly been\nflown here.\n\nWith a clanging of bells, the little convoy of ground cars drew up in\nfront of the hospital. A way was made through the chittering crowd\naround the entrance. Within a few minutes, Kinton found himself looking\ndown at a pallet upon which lay another Terran.\n\nA man! he thought, then curled a lip wrily at the sudden, unexpected\npang of disappointment. Well, he hadn't realized until then what he was\nreally hoping for!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe spaceman had been cleaned up and bandaged by the native medicos.\nKinton saw that his left thigh was probably broken. Other dressings\nsuggested cracked ribs and lacerations on the head and shoulders. The\nman was dark-haired but pale of skin, with a jutting chin and a nose\nthat had been flattened in some earlier mishap. The flaring set of his\nears somehow emphasized an overall leanness. Even in sleep, his mouth\nwas thin and hard.\n\n\"Thrown across the controls after his belt broke loose?\" Kinton guessed.\n\n\"I bow to your wisdom, George,\" said the plump Tepoktan doctor who\nappeared to be in charge.\n\nKinton could not remember him, but everyone on the planet addressed the\nTerran by the sound they fondly thought to be his first name.\n\n\"This is Doctor Chuxolkhee,\" murmured Klaft.\n\nKinton made the accepted gesture of greeting with one hand and said,\n\"You seem to have treated him very expertly.\"\n\nChuxolkhee ruffled the scales around his neck with pleasure.\n\n\"I have studied Terran physiology,\" he admitted complacently. \"From your\nrecords and drawings, of course, George, for I have not yet had the good\nfortune to visit you.\"\n\n\"We must arrange a visit soon,\" said Kinton. \"Klaft will--\"\n\nHe broke off at the sound from the patient.\n\n\"A Terran!\" mumbled the injured man.\n\nHe shook his head dazedly, tried to sit up, and subsided with a groan.\n\n_Why, he looked scared when he saw me_, thought Kinton.\n\n\"You're all right now,\" he said soothingly. \"It's all over and you're in\ngood hands. I gather there were no other survivors of the crash?\"\n\nThe man stared curiously. Kinton realized that his own language\nsputtered clumsily from his lips after ten years. He tried again.\n\n\"My name is George Kinton. I don't blame you if I'm hard to understand.\nYou see, I've been here ten years without ever having another Terran to\nspeak to.\"\n\nThe spaceman considered that for a few breaths, then seemed to relax.\n\n\"Al Birken,\" he introduced himself laconically. \"Ten years?\"\n\n\"A little over,\" confirmed Kinton. \"It's extremely unusual that anything\ngets through to the surface, let alone a spaceship. What happened to\nyou?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBirken's stare was suspicious.\n\n\"Then you ain't heard about the new colonies? Naw--you musta come here\nwhen all the planets were open.\"\n\n\"We had a small settlement on the second planet,\" Kinton told him. \"You\nmean there are new Terran colonies?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Jet-hoppers spreadin' all over the other five. None of the\nland-hungry poops figured a way to set down here, though, or they'd be\ncreepin' around this planet too.\"\n\n\"How did you happen to do it? Run out of fuel?\"\n\nThe other eyed him for a few seconds before dropping his gaze. Kinton\nwas struck with sudden doubt. The outposts of civilization were followed\nby less desirable developments as a general rule--prisons, for instance.\nHe resolved to be wary of the visitor.\n\n\"Ya might say I was explorin',\" Birken replied at last. \"That's why I\ncome alone. Didn't want nobody else hurt if I didn't make it. Say, how\nbad am I banged up?\"\n\nKinton realized guiltily that the man should be resting. He had lost\ntrack of the moments he had wasted in talk while the others with him\nstood attentively about.\n\nHe questioned the doctor briefly and relayed the information that\nBirken's leg was broken but that the other injuries were not serious.\n\n\"They'll fix you up,\" he assured the spaceman. \"They're quite good at\nit, even if the sight of one does make you think a little of an iguana.\nRest up, now; and I'll come back again when you're feeling better.\"\n\nFor the next three weeks, Kinton flew back and forth from his own town\nnearly every day. He felt that he should not neglect the few meetings\nwhich were the only way he could repay the Tepoktans for all they did\nfor him. On the other hand, the chance to see and talk with one of his\nown kind drew him like a magnet to the hospital.\n\nThe doctors operated upon Birken's leg, inserting a metal rod inside the\nbone by a method they had known before Kinton described it. The new\narrival expected to be able to walk, with care, almost any day; although\nthe pin would have to be removed after the bone had healed. Meanwhile,\nBirken seemed eager to learn all Kinton could tell him about the planet,\nTepokt.\n\nAbout himself, he was remarkably reticent. Kinton worried about this.\n\n\"I think we should not expect too much of this Terran,\" he warned Klaft\nuneasily. \"You, too, have citizens who do not always obey, your laws,\nwho sometimes ... that is--\"\n\n\"Who are born to die under the axe, as we say,\" interrupted Klaft, as if\nto ease the concern plain on Kinton's face. \"In other words, criminals.\nYou suspect this Albirken is such a one, George?\"\n\n\"It is not impossible,\" admitted Kinton unhappily. \"He will tell me\nlittle about himself. It may be that he was caught in Tepokt's gravity\nwhile fleeing from justice.\"\n\nTo himself, he wished he had not told Birken about the spaceship. He\ndidn't think the man exactly believed his explanation of why there was\nno use taking off in it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYet he continued to spend as much time as he could visiting the other\nman. Then, as his helicopter landed at the city airport one gray dawn,\nthe news reached him.\n\n\"The other Terran has gone,\" Klaft reported, turning from the\nbreathless messenger as Kinton followed him from the machine.\n\n\"Gone? Where did they take him?\"\n\nKlaft looked uneasy, embarrassed. Kinton repeated his question,\nwondering about the group of armed police on hand.\n\n\"In the night,\" Klaft hissed and clucked, \"when none would think to\nwatch him, they tell me ... and quite rightly, I think--\"\n\n\"Get on with it, Klaft! Please!\"\n\n\"In the night, then, Albirken left the chamber in which he lay. He can\nwalk some now, you know, because of Dr. Chuxolkhee's metal pin. He--he\nstole a ground car and is gone.\"\n\n\"He did?\" Kinton had an empty feeling in the pit of his stomach. \"Is it\nknown where he went? I mean ... he has been curious to see some of\nTepokt. Perhaps--\"\n\nHe stopped, his own words braying in his ears. Klaft was clicking two\nclaws together, a sign of emphatic disagreement.\n\n\"Albirken,\" he said, \"was soon followed by three police constables in\nanother vehicle. They found him heading in the direction of our town.\"\n\n\"Why did he say he was traveling that way?\" asked Kinton, thinking to\nhimself of the spaceship! Was the man crazy?\n\n\"He did not say,\" answered Klaft expressionlessly. \"Taking them by\nsurprise, he killed two of the constables and injured the third before\nfleeing with one of their spears.\"\n\n\"_What?_\"\n\nKinton felt his eyes bulging with dismay.\n\n\"Yes, for they carried only the short spears of their authority, not\nexpecting to need fire weapons.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKinton looked from him to the messenger, noticing for the first time\nthat the latter was an under-officer of police. He shook his head\ndistractedly. It appeared that his suspicions concerning Birken had been\nonly too accurate.\n\nWhy was it one like him who got through? he asked himself in silent\nanguish. After ten years. The Tepoktans had been thinking well of\nTerrans, but now--\n\nHe did not worry about his own position. That was well enough\nestablished, whether or not he could again hold up his head before the\npurple-scaled people who had been so generous to him.\n\nEven if they had been aroused to a rage by the killing, Kinton told\nhimself, he would not have been concerned about himself. He had reached\na fairly ripe age for a spaceman. In fact, he had already enjoyed a\ndecade of borrowed time.\n\nBut they were more civilized than that wanton murderer, he realized.\n\nHe straightened up, forcing back his early-morning weariness.\n\n\"We must get into the air immediately,\" he told Klaft. \"Perhaps we may\nsee him before he reaches--\"\n\nHe broke off at the word \"spaceship\" but he noticed a reserved\nexpression on Klaft's pointed face. His aide had probably reached a\nconclusion similar to his own.\n\nThey climbed back into the cabin and Klaft gave brisk orders to the lean\nyoung pilot. A moment later, Kinton saw the ground outside drop away.\n\nOnly upon turning around did he realize that two armed Tepoktans had\nmaterialized in time to follow Klaft inside.\n\nOne was a constable but the other he recognized for an officer of\nsome rank. Both wore slung across their chests weapons resembling\nlong-barreled pistols with large, oddly indented butts to fit Tepoktan\nclaws. The constable, in addition, carried a contraption with a\nquadruple tube for launching tiny rockets no thicker than Kinton's\nthumb. These, he knew, were loaded with an explosive worthy of respect\non any planet he had heard of.\n\nTo protect him, he wondered. Or to get Birken?\n\nThe pilot headed the craft back toward Kinton's town in the brightening\nsky of early day. Long before the buildings of Kinton's institute came\ninto view, they received a radio message about Birken.\n\n\"He has been seen on the road passing the dam,\" Klaft reported soberly\nafter having been called to the pilot's compartment. \"He stopped to\ndemand fuel from some maintenance workers, but they had been warned and\nfled.\"\n\n\"Couldn't they have seized him?\" demanded Kinton, his tone sharp with\nthe worry he endeavored to control. \"He has that spear, I suppose; but\nhe is only one and injured.\"\n\nKlaft hesitated.\n\n\"Well, couldn't they?\"\n\nThe aide looked away, out one of the windows at some sun-dyed clouds\nranging from pink to orange. He grimaced and clicked his showy teeth\nuncomfortably.\n\n\"Perhaps they thought you might be offended, George,\" he answered at\nlast.\n\nKinton settled back in the seat especially padded to fit the contours\nof his Terran body, and stared silently at the partition behind the\npilot.\n\nIn other words, he thought, he was responsible for Birken, who was a\nTerran, one of his own kind. Maybe they really didn't want to risk\nhurting his feelings, but that was only part of it. They were leaving\nit up to him to handle what they considered his private affair.\n\nHe wondered what to do. He had no actual faith in the idea that Birken\nwas delirious, or acting under any influence but that of a criminally\nself-centered nature.\n\n\"I _shouldn't_ have told him about the ship!\" Kinton muttered, gnawing\nthe knuckle of his left thumb. \"He's on the run, all right. Probably\nscared the colonial authorities will trail him right down through the\nDome of Eyes. Wonder what he did?\"\n\nHe caught himself and looked around to see if he had been overheard.\nKlaft and the police officers peered from their respective windows, in\ncalculated withdrawal. Kinton, disturbed, tried to remember whether he\nhad spoken in Terran or Tepoktan.\n\nWould Birken listen if he tried reasoning, he asked himself. Maybe if\nhe showed the man how they had proved the unpredictability of openings\nthrough the shifting Dome of Eyes--\n\nAn exclamation from the constable drew his attention. He rose, and room\nwas made for him at the opposite window.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the distance, beyond the town landing field they were now\napproaching, Kinton saw a halted ground car. Across the plain which was\ncolored a yellowish tan by a short, grass-like growth, a lone figure\nplodded toward the upthrust bulk of the spaceship that had never flown.\n\n\"Never mind landing at the town!\" snapped Kinton. \"Go directly out to\nthe ship!\"\n\nKlaft relayed the command to the pilot. The helicopter swept in a\ndescending curve across the plain toward the gleaming hull.\n\nAs they passed the man below, Birken looked up. He continued to limp\nalong at a brisk pace with the aid of what looked like a short spear.\n\n\"Go down!\" Kinton ordered.\n\nThe pilot landed about a hundred yards from the spaceship. By the time\nhis passengers had alighted, however, Birken had drawn level with them,\nabout fifty feet away.\n\n\"Birken!\" shouted Kinton. \"Where do you think you're going?\"\n\nSeeing that no one ran after him, Birken slowed his pace, but kept\nwalking toward the ship. He watched them over his shoulder.\n\n\"Sorry, Kinton,\" he shouted with no noticeable tone of regret. \"I figure\nI better travel on for my health.\"\n\n\"It's not so damn healthy up there!\" called Kinton. \"I told you how\nthere's no clear path--\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, you told me. That don't mean I gotta believe it.\"\n\n\"Wait! Don't you think they tried sending unmanned rockets up? Every one\nwas struck and exploded.\"\n\nBirken showed no more change of expression than if the other had\ncommented on the weather.\n\nKinton had stepped forward six or eight paces, irritated despite his\nanxiety at the way Birken persisted in drifting before him.\n\nKinton couldn't just grab him--bad leg or not, he could probably break\nthe older man in two.\n\nHe glanced back at the Tepoktans beside the helicopter, Klaft, the\npilot, the officer, the constable with the rocket weapon.\n\nThey stood quietly, looking back at him.\n\nThe call for help that had risen to his lips died there.\n\n\"Not _their_ party,\" he muttered. He turned again to Birken, who still\nretreated toward the ship. \"But he'll only get himself killed _and_\ndestroy the ship! Or if some miracle gets him through, that's worse!\nHe's nothing to turn loose on a civilized colony again.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA twinge of shame tugged down the corners of his mouth as he realized\nthat keeping Birken here would also expose a highly cultured people to\nan unscrupulous criminal who had already committed murder the very first\ntime he had been crossed.\n\n\"Birken!\" he shouted. \"For the last time! Do you want me to send them to\ndrag you back here?\"\n\nBirken stopped at that. He regarded the motionless Tepoktans with a\nderisive sneer.\n\n\"They don't look too eager to me,\" he taunted.\n\nKinton growled a Tepoktan expression the meaning of which he had deduced\nafter hearing it used by the dam workers.\n\nHe whirled to run toward the helicopter. Hardly had he taken two steps,\nhowever, when he saw startled changes in the carefully blank looks of\nhis escort. The constable half raised his heavy weapon, and Klaft sprang\nforward with a hissing cry.\n\nBy the time Kinton's aging muscles obeyed his impulse to sidestep, the\nspear had already hurtled past. It had missed him by an error of over\nsix feet.\n\nHe felt his face flushing with sudden anger. Birken was running as best\nhe could toward the spaceship, and had covered nearly half the distance.\n\nKinton ran at the Tepoktans, brushing aside the concerned Klaft. He\nsnatched the heavy weapon from the surprised constable.\n\nHe turned and raised it to his chest. Because of the shortness of\nTepoktan arms, the launcher was constructed so that the butt rested\nagainst the chest with the sighting loops before the eyes. The little\nrocket tubes were above head height, to prevent the handler's catching\nthe blast.\n\nThe circles of the sights weaved and danced about the running figure.\nKinton realized to his surprise that the effort of seizing the weapon\nhad him panting. Or was it the fright at having a spear thrown at him?\nHe decided that Birken had not come close enough for that, and wondered\nif he was afraid of his own impending action.\n\nIt wasn't fair, he complained to himself. The poor slob only had a\nspear, and a man couldn't blame him for wanting to get back to his own\nsort. He was limping ... hurt ... how could they expect him to\nrealize--?\n\nThen, abruptly, his lips tightened to a thin line. The sights steadied\non Birken as the latter approached the foot of the ladder leading to the\nentrance port of the spaceship.\n\nKinton pressed the firing stud.\n\nAcross the hundred-yard space streaked four flaring little projectiles.\nKinton, without exactly seeing each, was aware of the general lines of\nflight diverging gradually to bracket the figure of Birken.\n\nOne struck the ground beside the man just as he set one foot on the\nbottom rung of the ladder, and skittered away past one fin of the ship\nbefore exploding. Two others burst against the hull, scattering metal\nfragments, and another puffed on the upright of the ladder just above\nBirken's head.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe spaceman was blown back from the ladder. He balanced on his heels\nfor a moment with outstretched fingers reaching toward the grips from\nwhich they had been torn. Then he crumpled into a limp huddle on the\nyellowing turf.\n\nKinton sighed.\n\nThe constable took the weapon from him, reloaded deftly, and proffered\nit again. When the Terran did not reach for it, the officer held out a\nclawed hand to receive it. He gestured silently, and the constable\ntrotted across the intervening ground to bend over Birken.\n\n\"He is dead,\" said Klaft when the constable straightened up with a curt\nwave.\n\n\"Will ... will you have someone see to him, please?\" Kinton requested,\nturning toward the helicopter.\n\n\"Yes, George,\" said Klaft. \"George...?\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"It would be very instructive--that is, I believe Dr. Chuxolkhee would\nlike to--\"\n\n\"All right!\" yielded Kinton, surprised at the harshness of his own\nvoice. \"Just tell him not to bring around any sketches of the various\norgans for a few months!\"\n\nHe climbed into the helicopter and slumped into his seat. Presently, he\nwas aware of Klaft edging into the seat across the aisle. He looked up.\n\n\"The police will stay until cars from town arrive. They are coming now,\"\nsaid his aide.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKinton stared at his hands, wondering at the fact that they were not\nshaking. He felt dejected, empty, not like a man who had just been at\na high pitch of excitement.\n\n\"Why did you not let him go, George?\"\n\n\"What? Why ... why ... he would have destroyed the ship you worked so\nhard to build. There is no safe path through the Dome of Eyes.\"\n\n\"No predictable path,\" Klaft corrected. \"But what then? We would have\nbuilt you another ship, George, for it was you who showed us how.\"\n\nKinton flexed his fingers slowly.\n\n\"He was just no good. You know the murder he did here; we can only guess\nwhat he did among my own ... among Terrans.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
