In this story he\ndisplays the finesse, artistry and imagination of an old pro. Here is\none of the tightest, tautest stories of interplanetary adventure in a\nlong while:\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n\nThe murmur of conversation around the conference table died as the World\nSecretary entered the room and took his place at the head of the table.\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen,\" he said. \"I'll not detain you with formalities\ntoday. The representative of the Navy Department is waiting outside to\npresent the case for his proposal. You all know something of the scheme;\nit has been heard and passed as feasible by the Advisory Group. It will\nnow be our responsibility to make the decision. I ask that each of you\nin forming a conclusion remember that our present situation can only be\ndescribed as desperate, and that desperate measures may be in order.\"\n\nThe Secretary turned and nodded to a braided admiral seated near the\ndoor who left the room and returned a moment later with a young\ngray-haired Naval Officer.\n\n\"Members of the Council,\" said the admiral, \"this is Lieutenant\nCommander Greylorn.\" All eyes followed the officer as he walked the\nlength of the room to take the empty seat at the end of the table.\n\n\"Please proceed, Commander,\" said the Secretary.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Secretary.\" The Commander's voice was unhurried and low,\nyet it carried clearly and held authority. He began without preliminary.\n\n\"When the World Government dispatched the Scouting Forces forty-three\nyears ago, an effort was made to contact each of the twenty-five worlds\nto which this government had sent Colonization parties during the\nColonial Era of the middle Twentieth Centuries. With the return of the\nlast of the scouts early this year, we were forced to realize that no\nassistance would be forthcoming from that source.\"\n\nThe Commander turned his eyes to the world map covering the wall. With\nthe exception of North America and a narrow strip of coastal waters, the\nentire map was tinted an unhealthy pink.\n\n\"The latest figures compiled by the Department of the Navy indicate that\nwe are losing area at the rate of one square mile every twenty-one\nhours. The organism's faculty for developing resistance to our chemical\nand biological measures appears to be evolving rapidly. Analyses of\natmospheric samples indicate the level of noxious content rising at a\nsteady rate. In other words, in spite of our best efforts, we are not\nholding our own against the Red Tide.\"\n\nA mutter ran around the table, as Members shifted uncomfortably in their\nseats.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"A great deal of thought has been applied to the problem of increasing\nour offensive ability. This in the end is still a question of manpower\nand raw resources. We do not have enough. Our small improvements in\neffectiveness have been progressively offset by increasing casualties\nand loss of territory. In the end, alone, we must lose.\"\n\nThe Commander paused, as the murmur rose and died again. \"There is\nhowever, one possibility still unexplored,\" he said. \"And recent work\ndone at the Polar Research Station places the possibility well within\nthe scope of feasibility. At the time the attempt was made to establish\ncontact with the colonies, one was omitted. It alone now remains to be\nsought out. I refer to the Omega Colony.\"\n\nA portly Member leaned forward and burst out, \"The location of the\ncolony is unknown!\"\n\nThe Secretary intervened. \"Please permit the Commander to complete his\nremarks. There will be ample opportunity for discussion when he has\nfinished.\"\n\n\"This contact was not attempted for two reasons,\" the Commander\ncontinued. \"First, the precise location was not known; second, the\ndistance was at least twice that of the earlier colonies. At the time,\nthere was a feeling of optimism which seemed to make the attempt\nsuperfluous. Now the situation has changed. The possibility of\ncontacting Omega Colony now assumes paramount importance.\n\n\"The development of which I spoke is a new application of drive\nprinciple which has given to us a greatly improved effective velocity\nfor space propulsion. Forty years ago, the minimum elapsed time of\nreturn travel to the presumed sector within which the Omega World should\nlie was about a century. Today we have the techniques to construct a\nsmall scouting vessel capable of making the transit in just over five\nyears. We cannot hold out here for a century, perhaps; but we can manage\na decade.\n\n\"As for location, we know the initial target point toward which Omega\nwas launched. The plan was of course that a precise target should be\nselected by the crew after approaching the star group closely enough to\npermit telescopic planetary resolution and study. There is no reason why\nthe crew of a scout could not make the same study and examination of\npossible targets, and with luck find the colony.\n\n\"Omega was the last colonial venture undertaken by our people, two\ncenturies after the others. It was the best equipped and largest\nexpedition of them all. It was not limited to one destination, little\nknown, but had a presumably large selection of potentials from which to\nchoose; and her planetary study facilities were extremely advanced. I\nhave full confidence that Omega made a successful planetfall and has by\nnow established a vigorous new society.\n\n\"Honorable Members of the Council, I submit that all the resources of\nthis Government should be at once placed at the disposal of a task force\nwith the assigned duty of constructing a fifty-thousand-ton scouting\nvessel, and conducting an exhaustive survey of a volume of space of one\nthousand A.U.'s centered on the so-called Omega Cluster.\"\n\nThe World Secretary interrupted the babble which arose with the\ncompletion of the officer's presentation.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, time is of the essence of our problem. Let's\nproceed at once to orderly interrogation. Mr. Klayle, lead off, please.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe portly Councillor glared at the Commander. \"The undertaking you\npropose, sir, will require a massive diversion of our capacities from\ndefense. That means losing ground at an increasing rate to the obscenity\ncrawling over our planet. That same potential applied to direct\noffensive measures may yet turn the balance in our favor. Against this,\nthe possibility of a scouting party stumbling over the remains of a\ncolony the location of which is almost completely problematical, and\nwhich by analogy with all of the earlier colonial attempts has at best\nmanaged to survive as a marginal foothold, is so fantastically remote as\nto be inconsiderable.\"\n\nThe Commander listened coolly, seriously. \"Mr. Councillor,\" he replied,\n\"as to our defensive measures, we have passed the point of diminishing\nreturns. We have more knowledge now than we are capable of employing\nagainst the plague. Had we not neglected the physical sciences as we\nhave for the last two centuries, we might have developed adequate\nmeasures before we had been so far reduced in numbers and area as to be\nunable to produce and employ the new weapons our laboratories have\nbelatedly developed. Now we must be realistic; there is no hope in that\ndirection.\n\n\"As to the location of the Omega World, our plan is based on the fact\nthat the selection was not made at random. Our scout will proceed along\nthe Omega course line as known to us from the observations which were\ncarried on for almost three years after its departure. We propose to\ncontinue on that line, carrying out systematic observation of each\npotential sun in turn. As we detect planets, we will alter course only\nas necessary to satisfy ourselves as to the possibility of suitability\nof the planet. We can safely assume that Omega will not have bypassed\nany likely target. If we should have more than one prospect under\nconsideration at any time, we shall examine them in turn. If the Omega\nWorld has developed successfully, ample evidence should be discernible\nat a distance.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKlayle muttered \"Madness,\" and subsided. The angular member on his left\nspoke gently, \"Mr. Greylorn, why, if this colonial venture has met with\nthe success you assume, has its government not reestablished contact\nwith the mother world during the last two centuries?\"\n\n\"On that score, Mr. Councillor, we can only conjecture,\" the Commander\nsaid. \"The outward voyage may have required as much as fifty or sixty\nyears. After that, there must have followed a lengthy period of\ndevelopment and expansion in building the new world. It is not to be\nexpected that the pioneers would be ready to expend resources in\nexpeditionary ventures for some time.\"\n\n\"I do not completely understand your apparent confidence in the ability\nof the hypothetical Omega culture to supply massive aid to us, even if\nits people should be so inclined,\" said a straight-backed woman member.\n\"The time seems very short for the mastery of an alien world.\"\n\n\"The population development plan, Madam, provided for an increase from\nthe original 10,000 colonists to approximately 40,000 within twenty\nyears, after which the rate of increase would of course rapidly grow.\nAssuming sixty years for planetfall, the population should now number\nover one hundred sixty millions. Given population, all else follows.\"\n\nTwo hours later, the World Secretary summed up. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\nwe have the facts before us. There still exist differences in\ninterpretation, which however will not be resolved by continued\nrepetition. I now call for a vote on the resolution proposed by the\nMilitary Member and presented by Commander Greylorn.\"\n\nThere was silence in the Council Chamber as the votes were recorded and\ntabulated. Then the World Secretary sighed softly.\n\n\"Commander,\" he said, \"the Council has approved the resolution. I'm\nsure that there will be general agreement that you will be placed at the\nhead of the project, since you were director of the team which developed\nthe new drive and are also the author of the plan. I wish you the best\nof luck.\" He rose and extended his hand.\n\nThe first keel plate of the Armed Courier Vessel _Galahad_ was laid\nthirty-two hours later.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\n\nI expected trouble when I left the bridge. The tension that had been\nbuilding for many weeks was ready for release in violence. The ship was\nsilent as I moved along the passageway. Oddly silent, I thought;\nsomething was brewing.\n\nI stopped before the door of my cabin, listening; then I put my ear to\nthe wall. I caught the faintest of sounds from within; a muffled click,\nvoices. Someone was inside, someone attempting to be very quiet. I was\nnot overly surprised. Sooner or later the trouble had had to come into\nthe open. I looked up the passage, dim in the green glow of the\nnightlights. There was no one in sight.\n\nI listened. There were three voices, too faint to identify. The clever\nthing for me to do now would be to walk back up to the bridge, and order\nthe Provost Marshall to clear my cabin, but I had an intuitive feeling\nthat that was not the way to handle the situation. It would make things\nmuch simpler all around if I could push through this with as little\ncommotion as possible.\n\nThere was no point in waiting. I took out my key and placed it\nsoundlessly in the slot. As the door slid back I stepped briskly into\nthe room. Kramer, the Medical Officer, and Joyce, Assistant\nCommunications Officer, stood awkwardly, surprised. Fine, the Supply\nOfficer, was sprawled on my bunk. He sat up quickly.\n\nThey were a choice selection. Two of them were wearing sidearms. I\nwondered if they were ready to use them, or if they knew just how far\nthey were prepared to go. My task would be to keep them from finding\nout.\n\nI avoided looking surprised. \"Good evening, gentlemen,\" I said\ncheerfully. I stepped to the liquor cabinet, opened it, poured Scotch\ninto a glass. \"Join me in a drink?\" I said.\n\nNone of them answered. I sat down. I had to move just a little faster\nthan they did, and by holding the initiative, keep them off balance.\nThey had counted on hearing my approach, having a few moments to get\nset, and using my surprise against me. I had reversed their play and\ntaken the advantage. How long I could keep it depended on how well I\nplayed my few cards. I plunged ahead, as I saw Kramer take a breath and\nwrinkle his brow, about to make his pitch.\n\n\"The men need a change, a break in the monotony,\" I said. \"I've been\nconsidering a number of possibilities.\" I fixed my eyes on Fine as I\ntalked. He sat stiffly on the edge of my bunk. Already he was regretting\nhis boldness in presuming to rumple the Captain's bed.\n\n\"It might be a good bit of drill to set up a few live missile runs on\nrandom targets,\" I said. \"There's also the possibility of setting up a\nsmall arms range and qualifying all hands.\" I switched my eyes to\nKramer. Fine was sorry he'd come, and Joyce wouldn't take the\ninitiative; Kramer was my problem. \"I see you have your Mark 9, Major,\"\nI said, holding out my hand. \"May I see it?\" I smiled pleasantly.\n\nI hoped I had hit him quickly and smoothly enough, before he had had\ntime to adjust to the situation. Even for a hard operator like Kramer,\nit took mental preparation to openly defy his Commander, particularly in\ncasual conversation. But possession of the weapon was more than\ncasual....\n\nI looked at him, smiling, my hand held out. He wasn't ready; he pulled\nthe pistol from its case, handed it to me.\n\nI flipped the chamber open, glanced at the charge indicator, checked the\naction. \"Nice weapon,\" I said. I laid it on the open bar at my right.\n\nJoyce opened his mouth to speak. I cut in in the same firm snappy tone I\nuse on the bridge. \"Let me see yours, Lieutenant.\"\n\nHe flushed, looked at Kramer, then passed the pistol over without a\nword. I took it, turned it over thoughtfully, and then rose, holding it\nnegligently by the grip.\n\n\"Now, if you gentlemen don't mind, I have a few things to attend to.\" I\nwas not smiling. I looked at Kramer with expressionless eyes. \"I think\nwe'd better keep our little chat confidential for the present. I think I\ncan promise you action in the near future, though.\"\n\nThey filed out, looking as foolish as three preachers caught in a raid\non a brothel. I stood without moving until the door closed. Then I let\nmy breath out. I sat down and finished off the Scotch in one drag.\n\n\"You were lucky, boy,\" I said aloud. \"Three gutless wonders.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI looked at the Mark 9's on the table. A blast from one of those would\nhave burned all four of us in that enclosed room. I dumped them into a\ndrawer and loaded my Browning 2mm. The trouble wasn't over yet, I knew.\nAfter this farce, Kramer would have to make another move to regain his\nprestige. I unlocked the door, and left it slightly ajar. Then I threw\nthe main switch and stretched out on my bunk. I put the Browning needler\non the little shelf near my right hand.\n\nPerhaps I had made a mistake, I reflected, in eliminating formal\ndiscipline as far as possible in the shipboard routine. It had seemed\nthe best course for a long cruise under the present conditions. But now\nI had a morale situation that could explode in mutiny at the first\nblunder on my part.\n\nI knew that Kramer was the focal point of the trouble. He was my senior\nstaff officer, and carried a great deal of weight in the Officer's Mess.\nAs a medic, he knew most of the crew better than I. I thought I knew\nKramer's driving motive, too. He had always been a great success with\nthe women. When he had volunteered for the mission he had doubtless\npictured himself as quite a romantic hero, off on a noble but hopeless\nquest. Now, after four years in deep space, he was beginning to realize\nthat he was getting no younger, and that at best he would have spent a\ndecade of his prime in monastic seclusion. He wanted to go back now, and\nsalvage what he could.\n\nIt was incredible to me that this movement could have gathered\nfollowers, but I had to face the fact; my crew almost to a man had given\nup the search before it was well begun. I had heard the first rumors\nonly a few weeks before, but the idea had spread through the crew like\nwildfire. Now, I couldn't afford drastic action, or risk forcing a\nblowup by arresting ringleaders. I had to baby the situation along with\nan easy hand and hope for good news from the Survey Section. A likely\nfind now would save us.\n\nThere was still every reason to hope for success in our search. To date\nall had gone according to plan. We had followed the route of Omega as\nfar as it had been charted, and then gone on, studying the stars ahead\nfor evidence of planets. We had made our first finds early in the fourth\nyear of the voyage. It had been a long tedious time since then of study\nand observation, eliminating one world after another as too massive, too\ncold, too close to a blazing primary, too small to hold an atmosphere.\nIn all we had discovered twelve planets, of four suns. Only one had\nlooked good enough for close observation. We had moved in to televideo\nrange before realizing it was an all-sea world.\n\nNow we had five new main-sequence suns ahead within six months' range. I\nhoped for a confirmation on a planet at any time. To turn back now to a\nworld that had pinned its last hopes on our success was unthinkable, yet\nthis was Kramer's plan, and that of his followers. They would not\nprevail while I lived. Still it was not my plan to be a party to our\nfailure through martyrdom. I intended to stay alive and carry through to\nsuccess. I dozed lightly and waited.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI awoke when they tried the door. It had swung open a few inches at the\ntouch of the one who had tried it, not expecting it to be unlatched. It\nstood ajar now, the pale light from the hall shining on the floor. No\none entered. Kramer was still fumbling, unsure of himself. At every\nsurprise with which I presented him, he was paralyzed, expecting a trap.\nSeveral minutes passed in tense silence; then the door swung wider.\n\n\"I'll be forced to kill the first man who enters this room,\" I said in a\nsteady voice. I hadn't picked up the gun.\n\nI heard urgent whispers in the hall. Then a hand reached in behind the\nshelter of the door and flipped the light switch. Nothing happened,\nsince I had opened the main switch. It was only a small discomfiture,\nbut it had the effect of interfering with their plan of action, such as\nit was. These men were being pushed along by Kramer, without a clearly\nthought out plan. They hardly knew how to go about defying lawful\nauthority.\n\nI called out, \"I suggest you call this nonsense off now, and go back to\nyour quarters, men. I don't know who is involved in this, yet. You can\nget away clean if you leave quietly, now, before you've made a serious\nmistake.\"\n\nI hoped it would work. This little adventure, abortive though it was,\nmight serve to let off steam. The men would have something to talk about\nfor a few precious days. I picked up the needler and waited. If the\nbluff failed, I would have to kill someone.\n\nDistantly I heard a metallic clatter. Moments later a tremor rattled the\nobjects on the shelf, followed a few seconds later by a heavy\nshuddering. Papers slid from my desk, fluttered across the floor. The\nwhiskey bottle toppled, rolled to the far wall. I felt dizzy, as my bunk\nseemed to tilt under me. I reached for the intercom key and flipped it.\n\n\"Taylor,\" I said, \"this is the Captain. What's the report?\"\n\nThere was a momentary delay before the answer came. \"Captain, we've\ntaken a meteor strike aft, apparently a metallic body. It must have hit\nus a tremendous wallop because it's set up a rotation. I've called out\nDamage Control.\"\n\n\"Good work, Taylor,\" I said. I keyed for Stores; the object must have\nhit about there. \"This is the Captain,\" I said. \"Any damage there?\"\n\nI got a hum of background noise, then a too-close transmission. \"Uh,\nCap'n, we got a hole in the aft bulkhead here. I slapped a seat pad over\nit. Man, that coulda killed somebody.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI flipped off the intercom and started aft at a run. My visitors had\nevaporated. In the passage men stood, milled, called questions. I keyed\nmy mike as I ran. \"Taylor, order all hands to emergency stations.\"\n\nIt was difficult running, since the floors had assumed an apparent tilt.\nLoose gear was rolling and sliding along underfoot, propelled forward by\ncentrifugal force. Aft of Stores, I heard the whistle of escaping air\nand high pressure gasses from ruptured lines. Vapor clouds fogged the\nair. I called for floodlights for the whole sector.\n\nClay appeared out of the fog with his damage control crew. \"Sir,\" he\nsaid, \"it's punctured inner and outer shells in two places, and\nfragments have riddled the whole sector. There are at least three men\ndead, and two hurt.\"\n\n\"Taylor,\" I called, \"let's have another damage control crew back here on\nthe triple. Get the medics back here, too.\" Clay and his men put on\nmasks and moved off. I borrowed one from a man standing by and followed.\nThe large exit puncture was in the forward cargo lock. The room was\nsealed off, limiting the air loss.\n\n\"Clay,\" I said, \"pass this up for the moment and get that entry puncture\nsealed. I'll put the extra crew in suits to handle this.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI moved back into clear air and called for reports from all sections.\nThe worst of the damage was in the auxiliary power control room, where\ncommunication and power lines were slashed and the panel cut up. The\ndanger of serious damage to essential equipment had been very close, but\nwe had been lucky. This was the first instance I had heard of\nencountering an object at hyper light speed.\n\nIt was astonishing how this threat to our safety cleared the air. The\nmen went about their duties more cheerfully than they had for months,\nand Kramer was conspicuous by his subdued air. The emergency had\nreestablished at least for the time the normal discipline; the men still\nrelied on the Captain in trouble.\n\nDamage control crews worked steadily for the next seventy-two hours,\nreplacing wiring, welding, and testing. Power Section jockeyed\nendlessly, correcting air motions. Meanwhile, I checked almost hourly\nwith Survey Section, hoping for good news to consolidate the improved\nmorale situation.\n\nIt was on Sunday morning, just after dawn relief that Lt. Taylor came up\nto the bridge looking sick.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, \"we took more damage than we knew with that meteor\nstrike.\" He stopped and swallowed hard.\n\n\"What have you got, Lieutenant?\" I said.\n\n\"We missed a piece. It must have gone off on a tangent through stores\ninto the cooler. Clipped the coolant line, and let warm air in. All the\nfresh frozen stuff is contaminated and rotten.\" He gagged. \"I got a\nwhiff of it, sir. Excuse me.\" He rushed away.\n\nThis was calamity.\n\nWe didn't carry much in the way of fresh natural food; but what we had\nwas vital. It was a bulky, delicate cargo to handle, but the chemists\nhadn't yet come up with synthetics to fill all the dietary needs of man.\nWe could get by fine for a long time on vitamin tablets and\nconcentrates; but there were nutritional elements that you couldn't get\nthat way. Hydroponics didn't help; we had to have a few ounces of fresh\nmeat and vegetables grown in sunlight every week, or start to die within\nmonths.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI knew that Kramer wouldn't let this chance pass. As Medical Officer he\nwould be well within his rights in calling to my attention the fact that\nour health would soon begin to suffer. I felt sure he would do so as\nloudly and publicly as possible at the first opportunity.\n\nMy best move was to beat him to the punch by making a general\nannouncement, giving the facts in the best possible light. That might\ntake some of the sting out of anything Kramer said later.\n\nI gave it to them, short and to the point. \"Men, we've just suffered a\nserious loss. All the fresh frozen stores are gone. That doesn't mean\nwe'll be going on short rations; there are plenty of concentrates and\nvitamins aboard. But it does mean we're going to be suffering from\ndeficiencies in our diet.\n\n\"We didn't come out here on a pleasure cruise; we're on a mission that\nleaves no room for failure. This is just one more fact for us to face.\nNow let's get on with the job.\"\n\nI walked into the wardroom, drew a cup of near-coffee, and sat down. The\nscreen showed a beach with booming surf. The sound track picked up the\ncrash and hiss of the breakers. Considering the red plague that now\ncovered the scene, I thought it was a poor choice. I dialed for a high\nview of rolling farmland.\n\nMannion sat at a table across the room with Kirschenbaum. They were\nhunched over their cups, not talking. I wondered where they stood.\nMannion, Communications Officer, was neurotic, but an old Armed Force\nman. Discipline meant a lot to him. Kirschenbaum, Power Chief, was a\njoker, with cold eyes, and smarter than he seemed. The question was\nwhether he was smart enough to idealize the stupidity of retreat now.\n\nKramer walked in, not wasting any time. He saw me and came over. He\nstopped a few feet from the table, and said loudly, \"Captain, I'd like\nto know your plans, now that the possibility of continuing is out.\"\n\nI sipped my near-coffee and looked at the rolling farmland. I didn't\nanswer him. If I could get him mad, I could take him at his game.\n\nKramer turned red. He didn't like being ignored. The two at the other\ntable were watching.\n\n\"Captain,\" Kramer said loudly. \"As Medical Officer I have to know what\nmeasures you're taking to protect the health of the men.\"\n\nThis was a little better. He was on the defensive now; explaining why he\nhad a right to question his Commander. I wanted him a little hotter\nthough.\n\nI looked up at him. \"Kramer,\" I said in a clear, not too loud voice,\n\"you're on watch. I don't want to find you hanging around the wardroom\nmaking light chit-chat until you're properly relieved from duty.\" I went\nback to my near-coffee and the farmland. A river was in view now, and\nbeyond it distant mountains.\n\nKramer was furious. \"Joyce has relieved me, Captain,\" he said,\ncontrolling his voice with an effort. \"I felt I'd better take this\nmatter up with you as soon as possible, since it affects the health of\nevery man aboard.\" He was trying to keep cool, in command of himself.\n\n\"I haven't authorized any changes in the duty roster, Major,\" I said\nmildly. \"Report to your post.\" I was riding the habit of discipline now,\nas far as it would carry me. I hoped that disobedience to a direct\norder, solidly based on regulations, was a little too big a jump for\nKramer at the moment. Tomorrow it might be different. But it was\nessential that I break up the scene he was staging.\n\nHe wilted. \"I'll see you at 1700 in the chart room, Kramer,\" I said as\nhe turned away. Mannion and Kirschenbaum looked at each other, then\nfinished their near-coffee hurriedly and left. I hoped their version of\nthe incident would help deflate Kramer's standing among the malcontents.\n\nI left the wardroom and took the lift up to the bridge and checked with\nClay and his survey team.\n\n\"I think I've spotted a slight perturbation in Delta 3, Captain,\" Clay\nsaid. \"I'm not sure, we're still pretty far out.\"\n\n\"All right, Clay,\" I said. \"Stay with it.\"\n\nClay was one of my more dependable men, dedicated to his work.\nUnfortunately, he was no man of action. He would have little influence\nin a show-down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was at the Schmidt when I heard the lift open. I turned; Kramer, Fine,\nTaylor, and a half a dozen enlisted crew chiefs crowded out, bunched\ntogether. They were all wearing needlers. At least they'd learned that\nmuch, I thought.\n\nKramer moved forward. \"We feel that the question of the men's welfare\nhas to be dealt with right away, Captain,\" he said smoothly.\n\nI looked at him coldly, glanced at the rest of his crew. I said nothing.\n\n\"What we're faced with is pretty grim, even if we turn back now. I can't\nbe responsible for the results if there's any delay,\" Kramer said. He\nspoke in an arrogant tone. I looked them over, let the silence build.\n\n\"You're in charge of this menagerie?\" I said, looking at Kramer. \"If so,\nyou've got thirty seconds to send them back to their kennels. We'll go\ninto the matter of unauthorized personnel on the bridge later. As for\nyou, Major, you can consider yourself under arrest in quarters. Now\n_Move_.\"\n\nKramer was ready to stare me down, but Fine gave me a break by tugging\nat his sleeve. Kramer shook him loose, snarling. At that the crew chiefs\nfaded back into the lift. Fine and Taylor hesitated, then joined them.\nKramer started to shout after them, then got hold of himself. The lift\nmoved down.\n\nKramer thought about going for his needler. I looked at him through\nnarrowed eyes. He decided to rely on his mouth, as usual. He licked his\nlips. \"All right, I'm under arrest,\" he said. \"But as Medical Officer of\nthis vessel it's my duty to remind you that you can't live without a\ncertain minimum of fresh organic food. We've got to start back now.\" He\nwas pale, but determined. He couldn't bear the thought of getting bald\nand toothless from dietary deficiency. The girls would never give him\nanother look.\n\n\"We're going on, Kramer,\" I said. \"As long as we have a man aboard still\nable to move. Teeth or no teeth.\"\n\n\"Deficiency disease is no joke, Captain,\" Kramer said. \"You can get all\nthe symptoms of leprosy, cancer and syphilis just by skipping a few\nnecessary elements in your diet. And we're missing most of them.\"\n\n\"Giving me your opinions is one thing, Kramer,\" I said. \"Mutiny is\nanother.\"\n\nClay stood beside the main screen, wide-eyed. I couldn't send Kramer\ndown under his guard. \"Let's go, Kramer,\" I said. \"I'm locking you up\nmyself.\"\n\nWe rode down in the lift. The men who had been with Kramer stood\nawkwardly, silent as we stepped out into the passage. I spotted two\nchronic trouble-makers among them. I thought I might as well call them\nnow as later. \"Williams and Nagle,\" I said, \"this officer is under\narrest. Escort him to his quarters and lock him in.\" As they stepped\nforward hesitantly, Kramer said, \"Keep your filthy hooks off me.\" He\nstarted down the passage.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIf I could get Kramer put away before anybody else started trouble, I\nmight be able to bluff it through. I followed him and his two sheepish\nguards down past the power section, and the mess. I hoped there would be\nno crowd there to see their hero Kramer under guard.\n\nI was out of luck. Apparently word had gone out of Kramer's arrest, and\nthe corridor was clogged with men. They stood unmoving as we approached.\nKramer stopped.\n\n\"Clear this passage, you men,\" I said.\n\nSlowly they began to move back, giving ground reluctantly.\n\nSuddenly Kramer shouted. \"That's right, you whiners and complainers,\nclear the way so the Captain can take me back to the missile deck and\nshoot me. You just want to talk about home; you haven't got the guts to\ndo anything about it.\"\n\nThe moving mass halted, milled. Someone shouted, \"Who's he think he is,\nanyway.\"\n\nKramer whirled toward me. \"He thinks he's the man who's going to let you\nall rot alive, to save his record.\"\n\n\"Williams, Nagle,\" I said loudly, \"clear this passage.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWilliams started half-heartedly to shove at the men nearest him. A fist\nflashed out and snapped his head back. That was a mistake; Williams\npulled his needler, and fired a ricochet down the passage.\n\n\"'Bout twelve a you yellow-bellies git outa my way,\" he yelled. \"I'm\ncomin' through.\"\n\nNagle moved close to Williams, and shouted something to him. The noise\ndrowned it. Kramer swung back to me, frantic to regain his sway over the\nmob.\n\n\"Once I'm out of the way, there'll be a general purge,\" he roared. The\nhubbub faded, as men turned to hear him.\n\n\"You're all marked men. He's gone mad. He won't let one of you live.\"\nKramer had their eyes now. \"Take him now,\" he shouted, and seized my arm\nto begin the action.\n\nHe'd rushed it a little. I hit him across the face with the back of my\nhand. No one jumped to his assistance. I drew my 2mm. \"If you ever lay a\nhand on your Commanding Officer again, I'll burn you where you stand,\nKramer.\"\n\nThen a voice came from behind me. \"You're not killing anybody without a\ntrial, Captain.\" Joyce stood there with two of the crew chiefs, needler\nin hand. Fine and Taylor were not in sight.\n\nI pushed Kramer out of my way and walked up to Joyce.\n\n\"Hand me that weapon, Junior, butt first,\" I said. I looked him in the\neye with all the glare I had. He stepped back a pace.\n\n\"Why don't you jump him,\" he called to the crowd.\n\nThe wall annunciator hummed and spoke.\n\n\"Captain Greylorn, please report to the bridge. Unidentified body on\nmain scope.\"\n\nEvery man stopped in his tracks, listening. The annunciator continued.\n\"Looks like it's decelerating, Captain.\"\n\nI holstered my pistol, pushed past Joyce, and trotted for the lift. The\nmob behind me broke up, talking, as men under long habit ran for action\nstations.\n\nClay was operating calmly under pressure. He sat at the main screen, and\nstudied the blip, making tiny crayon marks.\n\n\"She's too far out for a reliable scanner track, Captain,\" he said, \"but\nI'm pretty sure she's braking.\"\n\nIf that were true, this might be the break we'd been living for. Only\nmanned or controlled bodies decelerated in deep space.\n\n\"How did you spot it, Clay?\" I asked. Picking up a tiny mass like this\nwas a delicate job, even when you knew its coordinates.\n\n\"Just happened to catch my eye, Captain,\" he said. \"I always make a\ngeneral check every watch of the whole forward quadrant. I noticed a\nblip where I didn't remember seeing one before.\"\n\n\"You have quite an eye, Clay,\" I said. \"How about getting this object in\nthe beam.\"\n\n\"We're trying now, Captain,\" he said. \"That's a mighty small field,\nthough.\"\n\nJoyce called from the radar board, \"I think I'm getting an echo at\n15,000, sir. It's pretty weak.\"\n\nMiller, quiet and meticulous, delicately tuned the beam control. \"Give\nme your fix, Joyce,\" he said. \"I can't find it.\"\n\nJoyce called out his figures, in seconds of arc to three places.\n\n\"You're right on it, Joyce,\" Miller called a minute later. \"I got it.\nNow pray it don't get away when I boost it.\"\n\nClay stepped over behind Miller. \"Take it a few mags at a time,\" he said\ncalmly.\n\nI watched Miller's screen. A tiny point near the center of the screen\nswelled to a spec, and jumped nearly off the screen to the left. Miller\ncentered it again, and switched to a higher power. This time it jumped\nless, and resolved into two tiny dots.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStep by step the magnification was increased as ring after ring of the\nlens antenna was thrown into play. Each time the centering operation was\nmore delicate. The image grew until it filled a quarter of the screen.\nWe stared at it in fascination.\n\nIt showed up in stark silhouette, in the electronic \"light\" of the radar\nscope. Two perfect discs, joined by a fine filament. As we watched,\ntheir relative positions slowly shifted, one moving across, half\noccluding the other.\n\nAs the image drifted, Miller worked with infinite care at his console to\nhold it on center, in sharp focus.\n\n\"Wish you'd give me an orbit on this thing, Joyce,\" he said, \"so I could\nlock onto it.\"\n\n\"It ain't got no orbit, man,\" Joyce said. \"I'm trackin' it, but I don't\nunderstand it. That rock is on a closing curve with us, and slowin' down\nfast.\"\n\n\"What's the velocity, Joyce?\" I asked.\n\n\"Averagin' about 1,000 relative, Captain, but slowin' fast.\"\n\n\"All right, we'll hold our course,\" I said.\n\nI keyed for a general announcement.\n\n\"This is the Captain,\" I said. \"General Quarters. Man action stations\nand prepare for possible contact within one hour.\"\n\n\"Missile Section. Arm No. 1 Battery and stand by.\"\n\nThen I added, \"We don't know what we've got here, but it's not a natural\nbody. Could be anything from a torpedo on up.\"\n\nI went back to the Beam screen. The image was clear, but without detail.\nThe two discs slowly drew apart, then closed again.\n\n\"I'd guess that movement is due to rotation of two spheres around a\ncommon center,\" Clay said.\n\n\"I agree with you,\" I said. \"Try to get me a reading on the mass of the\nobject.\"\n\nI wondered whether Kramer had been locked up as I had ordered, but at\nthis moment it seemed unimportant. If this was, as I hoped, a contact\nwith our colony, all our troubles were over.\n\nThe object (I hesitated to call it a ship) approached steadily, still\ndecelerating. Now Clay picked it up on the televideo, as it paralleled\nour course forty-five hundred miles out.\n\n\"Captain, it's my guess the body will match speeds with us at about 200\nmiles, at his present rate of deceleration,\" Clay said.\n\n\"Hold everything you've got on him, and watch closely for anything that\nmight be a missile,\" I said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClay worked steadily over his chart table. Finally he turned to me.\n\"Captain, I get a figure of over a hundred million tons mass; and\ncalibrating the scope images gives us a length of nearly two miles.\"\n\nI let that sink in. I had a strong and very empty feeling that this\nship, if ship it were, was not an envoy from any human colony.\n\nThe annunciator hummed and spoke. \"Captain, I'm getting a very short\nwave transmission from a point out on the starboard bow. Does that sound\nlike your torpedo?\" It was Mannion.\n\n\"That's it, Mannion,\" I said. \"Can you make anything of it?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" he answered. \"I'm taping it, so I can go to work on it.\"\n\nMannion was our language and code man. I hoped he was good.\n\n\"What does it sound like,\" I asked. \"Tune me in.\"\n\nAfter a moment a high hum came from the speaker. Through it I could hear\nharsh chopping consonants, a whining intonation. I doubted that Mannion\nwould be able to make anything of that gargle.\n\nOur Bogie closed steadily. At four hundred twenty-five miles he reversed\nrelative directions, and began matching our speed, moving closer to our\ncourse. There was no doubt he planned to parallel us.\n\nI made a brief announcement to all hands describing the status of the\naction. Clay worked over his televideo, trying to clear the image. I\nwatched as the blob on the screen swelled and flickered. Suddenly it\nflashed into clear stark definition. Against a background of sparkling\nblack, the twin spheres gleamed faintly in reflected starlight.\n\nThere were no visible surface features; the iodine-colored forms and\ntheir connecting shaft had an ancient and alien look.\n\nWe held our course steadily, watching the stranger maneuver. Even at\nthis distance it looked huge.\n\n\"Captain,\" Clay said, \"I've been making a few rough calculations. The\ntwo spheres are about 800 yards in diameter, and at the rate the\nstructure is rotating it's pulling about six gravities.\"\n\nThat settled the question of human origin of the ship. No human crew\nwould choose to work under six gee's.\n\nNow, paralleling us at just over two hundred miles, the giant ship spun\nalong, at rest relative to us. It was visible now through the direct\nobservation panel, without magnification.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI left Clay in charge on the bridge, and I went down to the Com Section.\n\nJoyce sat at his board, reading instruments and keying controls. So he\nwas back on the job. Mannion sat, head bent, monitoring his recorder.\nThe room was filled with the keening staccato of the alien transmission.\n\n\"Getting anything on video?\" I asked. Joyce shook his head. \"Nothing,\nCaptain. I've checked the whole spectrum, and this is all I get. It's\ncoming in on about a dozen different frequencies; no FM.\"\n\n\"Any progress, Mannion?\" I said.\n\nHe took off his headset. \"It's the same thing, repeated over and over,\njust a short phrase. I'd have better luck if they'd vary it a little.\"\n\n\"Try sending,\" I said.\n\nJoyce tuned the clatter down to a faint clicking, and switched his\ntransmitter on. \"You're on, Captain,\" he said.\n\n\"This is Captain Greylorn, UNACV Galahad; kindly identify yourself.\" I\nrepeated this slowly, half a dozen times. It occurred to me that this\nwas the first known time in history a human being had addressed a\nnon-human intelligence. The last was a guess, but I couldn't interpret\nour guest's purposeful maneuverings as other than intelligent.\n\nI checked with the bridge; no change. Suddenly the clatter stopped,\nleaving only the carrier hum.\n\n\"Can't you tune that whine out, Joyce?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, sir,\" he replied. \"That's a very noisy transmission. Sounds like\nmaybe their equipment is on the blink.\"\n\nWe listened to the hum, waiting. Then the clatter began again.\n\n\"This is different,\" Mannion said. \"It's longer.\"\n\nI went back to the bridge, and waited for the next move from the\nstranger, or for word from Mannion. Every half hour I transmitted a call\nidentifying us, followed by a sample of our language. I gave them\nEnglish, Russian, and Standard Interlingua. I didn't know why, but\nsomehow I had a faint hope they might understand some of it.\n\nI stayed on the bridge when the watch changed. I had some food sent up,\nand slept a few hours on the OD's bunk.\n\nFine replaced Kramer on his watch when it rolled around. Apparently\nKramer was out of circulation. At this point I did not feel inclined to\npursue the point.\n\nWe had been at General Quarters for twenty-one hours when the wall\nannunciator hummed.\n\n\"Captain, this is Mannion. I've busted it....\"\n\n\"I'll be right there,\" I said, and left at a run.\n\nMannion was writing as I entered ComSection. He stopped his recorder and\noffered me a sheet. \"This is what I've got so far, Captain,\" he said.\n\nI read: INVADER; THE MANCJI PRESENCE OPENS COMMUNICATIONS.\n\n\"That's a highly inflected version of early Interlingua, Captain,\"\nMannion said. \"After I taped it, I compensated it to take out the\nrise-and-fall tone, and then filtered out the static. There were a few\nsound substitutions to figure out, but I finally caught on. It still\ndoesn't make much sense, but that's what it says.\"\n\n\"I wonder what we're invading,\" I said. \"And what is the 'Mancji\nPresence'?\"\n\n\"They just repeat that over and over,\" Mannion said. \"They don't answer\nour call.\"\n\n\"Try translating into old Interlingua, adding their sound changes, and\nthen feeding their own rise-and-fall routine to it,\" I said. \"Maybe that\nwill get a response.\"\n\nI waited while Mannion worked out the message, then taped it on top of\ntheir whining tone pattern. \"Put plenty of horse-power behind it,\" I\nsaid. \"If their receivers are as shaky as their transmitter, they might\nnot be hearing us.\"\n\nWe sent for five minutes, then tuned them back in and waited. There was\na long silence from their side, then they came back with a long\nspluttering sing-song.\n\nMannion worked over it for several minutes. \"They must have understood\nus, here's what I get,\" he said:\n\n     THAT WHICH SWIMS IN THE MANCJI SEA; WE ARE AWARE THAT YOU HAVE THIS\n     TRADE TONGUE. YOU RANGE FAR. IT IS OUR WHIM TO INDULGE YOU; WE ARE\n     AMUSED THAT YOU PRESUME HERE; WE ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR INSOLENT DEMANDS.\n\n\"It looks like we're in somebody's back yard,\" I said. \"They acknowledge\nour insolent demands, but they don't answer them.\" I thought a moment.\n\"Send this,\" I said. \"We'll out-strut them:\"\n\n     THE MIGHTY WARSHIP GALAHAD REJECTS YOUR JURISDICTION.\n\n     TELL US THE NATURE OF YOUR DISTRESS AND WE MAY CHOOSE TO OFFER AID.\n\nMannion raised an eyebrow. \"That ought to rock them,\" he said.\n\n\"They were eager to talk to us,\" I said. \"That means they want\nsomething, in my opinion. And all the big talk sounds like a bluff of\nour own is our best line.\"\n\n\"Why do you want to antagonize them, Captain?\" Joyce asked. \"That ship\nis over a thousand times the size of this can.\"\n\n\"Joyce, I suggest you let me forget you're around,\" I said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Mancji whine was added to my message, and it went out. Moments later\nthis came back:\n\n     MANCJI HONOR DICTATES YOUR SAFE-CONDUCT; TALK IS WEARYING; WE FIND\n     IT CONVENIENT TO SOLICIT A TRANSFER OF ELECTROSTATIC FORCE.\n\n\"What the devil does that mean?\" I said. \"Tell them to loosen up and\nexplain themselves.\"\n\nMannion wrote out a straight query, and sent it. Again we waited for a\nreply.\n\nIt came, in a long windy paragraph stating that the Mancji found\nelectro-static baths amusing, and that \"crystallization\" had drained\ntheir tanks. They wanted a flow of electrons from us to replenish their\nsupply.\n\n\"This sounds like simple electric current they're talking about,\nCaptain,\" Mannion said. \"They want a battery charge.\"\n\n\"They seem to have power to burn,\" I said. \"Why don't they generate\ntheir own juice? Ask them; and find out where they learned Interlingua.\"\n\nMannion sent again; the reply was slow in coming back. Finally we got\nit:\n\n     THE MANCJI DO NOT EMPLOY MASSIVE GENERATION-PIECE WHERE\n     ACCUMULATOR-PIECE IS SUFFICIENT. THIS SIMPLE TRADE SPEECH IS OF OLD\n     KNOWLEDGE. WE SELECT IT FROM SYMBOLS WE ARE PLEASED TO SENSE\n     EMPATTERNED ON YOUR HULL.\n\nThat made some sort of sense, but I was intrigued by the reference to\nInterlingua as a trade language. I wanted to know where they had learned\nit. I couldn't help the hope I started building on the idea that this\ngiant knew our colony, in spite of the fact that they were using an\nantique version of the language, predating Omega by several centuries.\n\nI sent another query, but the reply was abrupt and told nothing except\nthat Interlingua was of \"old knowledge.\"\n\nThen Mannion entered a long technical exchange, getting the details of\nthe kind of electric power they wanted.\n\n\"We can give them what they want, no sweat, Captain,\" he said after half\nan hour's talk. \"They want DC; 100 volt, 50 amp will do.\"\n\n\"Ask them to describe themselves,\" I directed. I was beginning to get an\nidea.\n\nMannion sent, got his reply. \"They're molluscoid, Captain,\" he said. He\nlooked shocked. \"They weigh about two tons each.\"\n\n\"Ask them what they eat,\" I said.\n\nI turned to Joyce as Mannion worked over the message. \"Get Kramer up\nhere, on the double,\" I said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKramer came in five minutes later, looking drawn and rumpled. He stared\nat me sullenly.\n\n\"I'm releasing you from arrest temporarily on your own parole, Major,\" I\nsaid. \"I want you to study the reply to our last transmission, and tell\nme what you can about it.\"\n\n\"Why me?\" Kramer said. \"I don't know what's going on.\" I didn't answer\nhim.\n\nThere was a long tense half hour wait before Mannion copied out the\nreply that came in a stuttering nasal. He handed it to me.\n\nAs I had hoped, the message, after a preliminary recital of the\nindifference of the Mancji to biological processes of ingestion, recited\na list of standard biochemical symbols.\n\n\"Can we eat this stuff?\" I asked Kramer, handing him the sheet.\n\nHe studied it, and some of his accustomed swagger began to return. \"I\ndon't know what the flowery phrases are all about, but the symbols refer\nto common proteins, lipins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and biomins,\" he\nsaid. \"What is this, a game?\"\n\n\"All right, Mannion,\" I said. I was trying to hold back the excitement.\n\"Ask them if they have fresh sources of these substances aboard.\"\n\nThe reply was quick; they did.\n\n\"Tell them we will exchange electric power for a supply of these foods.\nTell them we want samples of half a dozen of the natural substances.\"\n\nAgain Mannion coded and sent, received and translated, sent again.\n\n\"They agree, Captain,\" he said at last. \"They want us to fire a power\nlead out about a mile; they'll come in close and shoot us a specimen\ncase with a flare on it. Then we can each check the other's\nmerchandise.\"\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"We can use a ground-service cable; rig a pilot\nlight on it, and kick it out, as soon as they get in close.\"\n\n\"We'll have to splice a couple of extra lengths to it,\" Mannion said.\n\n\"Go to it, Mannion,\" I said. \"And send two of your men out to make the\npick-up.\" This wasn't a communications job, but I wanted a reliable man\nhandling it.\n\nI returned to the bridge and keyed for Bourdon, directed him to arm two\nof his penetration missiles, lock them onto the stranger, and switch\nover to my control. With the firing key in my hand, I stood at the\ntelevideo screen and watched for any signs of treachery. The ship moved\nin, came to rest filling the screen.\n\nMannion's men reported out. I saw the red dot of our power lead move\naway, then a yellow point glowed on the side of the vast iodine-colored\nwall looming across the screen.\n\nNothing else emerged from the alien ship. The red pilot drifted across\nthe face of the sphere. Mannion reported six thousand feet of cable out\nbefore the pilot disappeared abruptly.\n\n\"Captain,\" Mannion reported, \"they're drawing power.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" I said. \"Let them have a sample, then shut down.\"\n\nI waited, watching carefully, until Mannion reported the cannister\ninside.\n\n\"Kramer,\" I said. \"Run me a fast check on the samples in that\ncontainer.\"\n\nKramer was recovering his swagger. \"You'll have to be a little more\nspecific,\" he said. \"Just what kind of analysis do you have in mind? Do\nyou want a full....\"\n\n\"I just want to know one thing, Kramer,\" I said. \"Can we assimilate\nthese substances, yes or no. If you don't feel like co-operating, I'll\nhave you lashed to your bunk, and injected with them. You claim you're a\nmedical officer; let's see you act like one.\" I turned my back to him.\n\nMannion called. \"They say the juice we fed them was 'amusing,' Captain.\nI guess that means it's O.K.\"\n\n\n\"I'll let you know in a few minutes how their samples pan out,\" I said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKramer took half an hour before reporting back. \"I ran a simple check\nsuch as I normally use in a routine mess inspection,\" he began. He\ncouldn't help trying to take the center of the stage to go into his Wise\nDoctor and Helpless Patient routine.\n\n\"Yes or no,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, we can assimilate most of it,\" he said angrily. \"There were six\nsamples. Two were gelatinous substances, non-nutritive. Three were\nvegetable-like, bulky and fibrous, one with a high iodine content; the\nother was a very normal meaty specimen.\"\n\n\"Which should we take?\" I said. \"Remember your teeth when you answer.\"\n\n\"The high protein, the meaty one,\" he said. \"Marked '6'.\"\n\nI keyed for Mannion. \"Tell them that in return for 1,000 KWH we require\n3,000 kilos of sample six,\" I said.\n\nMannion reported back. \"They agreed in a hurry, Captain. They seem to\nfeel pretty good about the deal. They want to chat, now that they've got\na bargain. I'm still taping a long tirade.\"\n\n\"Good,\" I said. \"Better get ready to send about six men with an\nauxiliary pusher to bring home the bacon. You can start feeding them the\njuice again.\"\n\nI turned to Kramer. He was staring at the video image. \"Report yourself\nback to arrest in quarters, Kramer,\" I said. \"I'll take your services\ntoday into account at your court-martial.\"\n\nKramer looked up, with a nasty grin. \"I don't know what kind of talking\noysters you're trafficking with, but I'd laugh like hell if they\nvaporized your precious tub as soon as they're through with you.\" He\nwalked out.\n\nMannion called in again from ComSection. \"Here's their last, Captain,\"\nhe said. \"They say we're lucky they had a good supply of this protein\naboard. It's one of their most amusing foods. It's a creature they\ndiscovered in the wild state and it's very rare. The wild ones have died\nout, and only their domesticated herds exist.\"\n\n\"O.K., we're lucky,\" I said. \"It better be good or we'll step up the\namperage and burn their batteries for them.\"\n\n\"Here's more,\" Mannion said. \"They say it will take a few hours to\nprepare the cargo. They want us to be amused.\"\n\nI didn't like the delay, but it would take us about 10 hours to deliver\nthe juice to them at the trickle rate they wanted. Since the sample was\nO.K., I was assuming the rest would be too. We settled down to wait.\n\nI left Clay in charge on the bridge and made a tour of the ship. The\nmeeting with the alien had apparently driven the mood of mutiny into the\nbackground. The men were quiet and busy. I went to my cabin and slept\nfor a few hours.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was awakened by a call from Clay telling me that the alien had\nreleased his cargo for us. Mannion's crew was out making the pick-up.\nBefore they had maneuvered the bulky cylinder to the cargo hatch, the\nalien released our power lead.\n\nI called Kramer and told him to meet the incoming crew and open and\ninspect the cargo. If it was the same as the sample, I thought, we had\nmade a terrific trade. Discipline would recover if the men felt we still\nhad our luck.\n\nThen Mannion called again. \"Captain,\" he said excitedly, \"I think there\nmay be trouble coming. Will you come down, sir?\"\n\n\"I'll go to the bridge, Mannion,\" I said. \"Keep talking.\"\n\nI tuned my speaker down low and listened to Mannion as I ran for the\nlift.\n\n\"They tell us to watch for a little display of Mancji power. They ran\nout some kind of antenna. I'm getting a loud static at the top of my\nshort wave receptivity.\"\n\nI ran the lift up and as I stepped onto the bridge I said, \"Clay, stand\nby to fire.\"\n\nAs soon as the pick-up crew was reported in, I keyed course corrections\nto curve us off sharply from the alien. I didn't know what he had, but I\nliked the idea of putting space between us. My P-Missiles were still\narmed and locked.\n\nMannion called, \"Captain, they say our fright is amusing, and quite\njustified.\"\n\nI watched the televideo screen for the first sign of an attack. Suddenly\nthe entire screen went white, then blanked. Miller, who had been at the\nscanner searching over the alien ship at close range, reeled out of his\nseat, clutching at his eyes. \"My God, I'm blinded,\" he shouted.\n\nMannion called, \"Captain, my receivers blew. I think every tube in the\nshack exploded!\"\n\nI jumped to the direct viewer. The alien hung there, turning away from\nus in a leisurely curve. There was no sign of whatever had blown us off\nthe air. I held my key, but didn't press it. I told Clay to take Miller\ndown to Medic. He was moaning and in severe pain.\n\nKramer reported in from the cargo deck. The cannister was inside now,\ncoating up with frost. I told him to wait, then sent Chilcote, my\ndemolition man, in to open it. Maybe it was booby-trapped. I stood by at\nthe DVP and waited for other signs of Mancjo power to hit us. The\ngeneral feeling was tense.\n\nApparently they were satisfied with one blast of whatever it was; they\nwere dwindling away with no further signs of life.\n\nAfter half an hour of tense alertness, I ordered the missiles disarmed.\n\nI keyed for General. \"Men, this is the Captain,\" I said. \"It looks as\nthough our first contact with an alien race has been successfully\ncompleted. He is now at a distance of three hundred and moving off fast.\nOur screens are blown, but there's no real damage. And we have a supply\nof fresh food aboard; now let's get back to business. That colony can't\nbe far off.\"\n\nThat may have been rushing it some, but if the food supply we'd gotten\nwas a dud, we were finished anyway.\n\nWe watched the direct-view screen till the ship was lost; then followed\non radar.\n\n\"It's moving right along, Captain,\" Joyce said, \"accelerating at about\ntwo gee's.\"\n\n\"Good riddance,\" Clay said. \"I don't like dealing with armed maniacs.\"\n\n\"They were screwballs all right,\" I said, \"but they couldn't have\nhappened along at a better time. I only wish we had been in a position\nto squeeze a few answers out of them.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Clay said. \"Now that the whole thing's over, I'm beginning\nto think of a lot of questions myself.\"\n\nThe annunciator hummed. I heard what sounded like hoarse breathing. I\nglanced at the indicator light. It was the cargo deck mike that was\nopen.\n\nI keyed. \"If you have a report, Chilcote, go ahead,\" I said.\n\nSuddenly someone was shouting into the mike, incoherently. I caught\nwords, cursing. Then Chilcote's voice, \"Captain,\" he said. \"Captain,\nplease come quick.\" There was a loud clatter, noise, then only the hum\nof the mike.\n\n\"Take over, Clay,\" I said, and started back to the cargo deck at a dead\nrun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMen crowded the corridor, asking questions, milling. I forced my way\nthrough, found Kramer surrounded by men, shouting.\n\n\"Break this up,\" I shouted. \"Kramer, what's your report?\"\n\nChilcote walked past me, pale as chalk. I pushed through to Kramer.\n\n\"Get hold of yourself, and make your report, Kramer,\" I said. \"What\nstarted this riot?\"\n\nKramer stopped shouting, and stood looking at me, panting. The crowded\nmen fell silent.\n\n\"I gave you a job to do, Major,\" I said; \"opening a cargo can. Now you\ntake it from there.\"\n\n\"Yeah, Captain,\" he said. \"We got it open. No wires, no traps. We hauled\nthe load out of the can on to the floor. It was one big frozen mass,\nwrapped up in some kind of netting. Then we pulled the covering off.\"\n\n\"All right, go ahead,\" I said.\n\n\"That load of fresh meat your star-born pals gave us consists of about\nsix families of human beings; men, women, and children.\" Kramer was\ntalking for the crowd now, shouting. \"Those last should be pretty tender\nwhen you ration out our ounce a week, Captain.\"\n\nThe men milled, wide-eyed, open-mouthed, as I thrust through to the\ncargo lock. The door stood ajar and wisps of white vapor curled out into\nthe passage.\n\nI stepped through the door. It was bitter cold in the lock. Near the\nouter hatch the bulky cannister, rimed with white frost, lay in a pool\nof melting ice. Before it lay the half shrouded bulk that it had\ncontained. I walked closer.\n\nThey were frozen together into one solid mass. Kramer was right. They\nwere as human as I. Human corpses, stripped, packed together, frozen. I\npulled back the lightly frosted covering, and studied the glazed white\nbodies.\n\nKramer called suddenly from the door. \"You found your colonists,\nCaptain. Now that your curiosity is satisfied, we can go back where we\nbelong. Out here man is a tame variety of cattle. We're lucky they\ndidn't know we were the same variety, or we'd be in their food lockers\nnow ourselves. Now let's get started back. The men won't take 'no' for\nan answer.\"\n\nI leaned closer, studying the corpses. \"Come here, Kramer,\" I called. \"I\nwant to show you something.\"\n\n\"I've seen all there is to see in there,\" Kramer said. \"We don't want to\nwaste time; we want to change course now, right away.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI walked back to the door, and as Kramer stepped back to let me precede\nhim out the door, I hit him in the mouth with all my strength. His head\nsnapped back against the frosted wall. Then he fell out into the\npassage.\n\nI stepped over him. \"Pick this up and put it in the brig,\" I said. The\nmen in the corridor fell back, muttering. As they hauled Kramer upright\nI stepped through them and kept going, not running but wasting no time,\ntoward the bridge. One wrong move on my part now and all their misery\nand fear would break loose in a riot the first act of which would be to\ntear me limb from limb.\n\nI travelled ahead of the shock. Kramer had provided the diversion I had\nneeded. Now I heard the sound of gathering violence growing behind me.\n\nI was none too quick. A needler flashed at the end of the corridor just\nas the lift door closed. I heard the tiny projectile ricochet off the\nlift shaft.\n\nI rode up, stepped onto the bridge and locked the lift. I keyed for\nBourdon, and to my relief got a quick response. The panic hadn't\npenetrated to Missile Section yet.\n\n\"Bourdon, arm all batteries and lock onto that Mancji ship,\" I ordered.\n\"On the triple.\"\n\nI turned to Clay. \"I'll take over, Clay,\" I said. \"Alter course to\nintercept our late companion at two and one-half gee's.\"\n\nClay looked startled, but said only, \"Aye, sir.\"\n\nI keyed for a general announcement. \"This is the Captain,\" I said.\n\"Action station, all hands in loose acceleration harness. We're going\nafter Big Brother. You're in action against the enemy now, and from this\npoint on I'm remembering. You men have been having a big time letting\noff steam; that's over now. All sections report.\"\n\nOne by one the sections reported in, all but Med. and Admin. Well, I\ncould spare them for the present. The pressure was building now, as we\nblasted around in a hairpin curve, our acceleration picking up fast.\n\nI ordered Joyce to lock his radar on target, and switch over to\nautopilot control. Then I called Power Section.\n\n\"I'm taking over all power control from the bridge,\" I said. \"All\npersonnel out of the power chamber and control chamber.\"\n\nThe men were still under control, but that might not last long. I had to\nhave the entire disposition of the ship's power, control, and armament\nunder my personal direction for a few hours at least.\n\nMissile Section reported all missiles armed and locked on target. I\nacknowledged and ordered the section evacuated. Then I turned to Clay\nand Joyce. Both were plenty nervous now; they didn't know what was\nbrewing.\n\n\"Lieutenant Clay,\" I said. \"Report to your quarters; Joyce, you too. I\nwant to congratulate both of you on a soldierly performance these last\nfew hours.\"\n\nThey left without protest. I was aware that they didn't want to be too\nclosely identified with the Captain when things broke loose.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI keyed for a video check of the interior of the lift as it started back\nup. It was empty. I locked it up.\n\nNow we were steady on course, and had reached our full two and a half\ngees. I could hardly stand under that acceleration, but I had one more\njob to do before I could take a break.\n\nFeet dragging, I unlocked the lift and rode it down. I was braced for\nviolence as I opened the lift door, but I was lucky. There was no one in\nthe corridor. I could hear shouts in the distance. I dragged myself\nalong to Power Section and pushed inside. A quick check of control\nsettings showed everything as I had ordered it. Back in the passage, I\nslammed the leaded vault door to and threw in the combination lock. Now\nonly I could open it without blasting.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nControl Section was next. It, too, was empty, all in order. I locked it,\nand started across to Missiles. Two men appeared at the end of the\npassage, having as hard a time as I was. I entered the cross corridor\njust in time to escape a volley of needler shots. The mutiny was in the\nopen now, for sure.\n\nI kept going, hearing more shouting. I was sure the men I had seen were\nheading for Power and Control. They'd get a surprise. I hoped I could\nbeat them to the draw at Missiles, too.\n\nAs I came out in B corridor, twenty feet from Missiles, I saw that I had\ncut it a bit fine. Three men, crawling, were frantically striving\nagainst the multi-gee field to reach the door before me. Their faces\nwere running with sweat, purple with exertion.\n\nI had a slight lead; it was too late to make a check inside before\nlocking up. The best I could hope for was to lock the door before they\nreached it.\n\nI drew my Browning and started for the door. They saw me and one reached\nfor his needler.\n\n\"Don't try it,\" I called. I concentrated on the door, reached it, swung\nit closed, and as I threw in the lock a needler cracked. I whirled and\nfired. The man in the rear had stopped and aimed as the other two came\non. He folded. The other two kept coming.\n\nI was tired. I wanted a rest. \"You're too late,\" I said. \"No one but the\nCaptain goes in there now.\" I stopped talking, panting. I had to rest.\nThe two came on. I wondered why they struggled so desperately after they\nwere beaten. My thinking was slowing down.\n\nI suddenly realized they might be holding me for the crowd to arrive. I\nshuffled backwards towards the cross corridor. I barely made it. Two men\non a shuttle cart whirled around the corner a hundred feet aft. I\nlurched into my shelter in a hail of needler fire. One of the tiny slugs\nstung through my calf and ricocheted down the passage.\n\nI called to the two I had raced; \"Tell your boys if they ever want to\nopen that door, just see the Captain.\"\n\nI hesitated, considering whether or not to make a general statement.\n\n\"What the hell,\" I decided. \"They all know there's a mutiny now. It\nwon't hurt to get in a little life-insurance.\"\n\nI keyed my mike. \"This is the Captain,\" I said. \"This ship is now in a\nstate of mutiny. I call on all loyal members of the Armed Forces to\nresist the mutineers actively, and to support their Commander. Your\nship is in action against an armed enemy. I assure you this mutiny will\nfail, and those who took part in it will be treated as traitors to their\nService, their homes, and their own families who now rely on them.\n\n\"We are accelerating at two and one-half gravities, locked on a\ncollision course with the Mancji ship. The mutineers cannot enter the\nBridge, Power, Control, or Missiles Sections since only I have the\ncombination. Thus they're doomed to failure.\n\n\"I am now returning to the Bridge to direct the attack and destruction\nof the enemy. If I fail to reach the Bridge, we will collide with the\nenemy in less than three hours, and our batteries will blow.\"\n\nNow my problem was to make good my remark about returning to the Bridge.\nThe shuttle had not followed me, presumably fearing ambush. I took\nadvantage of their hesitation to cross back to corridor A at my best\nspeed. I paused once to send a hail of needles ricocheting down the\ncorridor behind me, and I heard a yelp from around the corner. Those\nneedles had a fantastic velocity, and bounced around a long time before\nstopping.\n\nAt the corridor, I lay down on the floor for a rest and risked a quick\nlook. A group of three men were bunched around the Control Section door,\npacking smashite in the hairline crack around it. That wouldn't do them\nany good, but it did occupy their attention.\n\nI faded back into the cross passage, and keyed the mike. I had to give\nthem a chance.\n\n\"This is the Captain,\" I said. \"All personnel not at their action\nstations are warned for the last time to report there immediately. Any\nman found away from his post from this point on is in open mutiny and\ncan expect the death penalty. This is the last warning.\"\n\nThe men in the corridor had heard, but a glance showed they paid no\nattention to what they considered an idle threat. They didn't know how\nnear I was.\n\nI drew my needler, set it for continuous fire, pushed into the corridor,\naimed, and fired. I shot to kill. All three sprawled away from the door,\nriddled, as the metal walls rang with the cloud of needles.\n\nI looked both ways, then rose, with effort, and went to the bodies. I\nrecognized them as members of Kirschenbaum's Power Section crew. I keyed\nagain as I moved on toward the lift at the end of the corridor, glancing\nback as I went.\n\n\"Corley, Mac Williams, and Reardon have been shot for mutiny in the face\nof the enemy,\" I said. \"Let's hope they're the last to insist on my\nenforcing the death penalty.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBehind me, at the far end of the corridor, men appeared again. I\nflattened myself in a doorway, sprayed needles toward them, and hoped\nfor the best. I heard the singing of a swarm past me, but felt no hits.\nThe mutineers offered a bigger target, and I thought I saw someone fall.\nAs they all moved back out of sight, I made another break for the lift.\n\nI was grateful they hadn't had time to organize. I kept an eye to the\nrear, and sent a hail of needles back every time a man showed himself.\nThey ducked out to fire every few seconds, but not very effectively. I\nhad an advantage over them; I was fighting for the success of the\nmission and for my life, with no one to look to for help; they were each\none of a mob, none eager to be a target, each willing to let the other\nman take the risk.\n\nI was getting pretty tired. I was grateful for the extra stamina and\nwind that daily calisthenics in a high-gee field had given me; without\nthat I would have collapsed before now; but I was almost ready to drop.\nI had my eyes fixed on the lift door; each step, inch by inch, was an\nalmost unbearable effort. With only a few feet to go, my knees gave; I\nwent down on all fours. Another batch of needles sang around me, and\nvivid pain seared my left arm. It helped. The pain cleared my head,\nspurred me. I rose and stumbled against the door.\n\nNow the combination. I fought a numbing desire to faint as I pressed the\nlock control; three, five, two, five ...\n\nI twisted around as I heard a sound. The shuttle was coming toward me,\nmen lying flat on it, protected by the bumper plate. I leaned against\nthe lift door, and loosed a stream of needles against the side of the\ncorridor, banking them toward the shuttle. Two men rolled off the\nshuttle in a spatter of blood. Another screamed, and a hand waved above\nthe bumper. I needled it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI wondered how many were on the shuttle. It kept coming. The closer it\ncame, the more effective my bank shots were. I wondered why it failed to\nreturn my fire. Then a hand rose in an arc and a choke bomb dropped in a\nshort curve to the floor. It rolled to my feet, just starting to spew. I\nkicked it back. The shuttle stopped, backed away from the bomb. A jet of\nbrown gas was playing from it now. I aimed my needler, and sent it\nspinning back farther. Then I turned to my lock.\n\nNow a clank of metal against metal sounded behind me; from the side\npassage a figure in radiation armor moved out. The suit was self-powered\nand needle proof. I sent a concentrated blast at the head, as the figure\nawkwardly tottered toward me, ungainly in the multi-gee field. The\nneedles hit, snapped the head back. The suited figure hesitated, arms\nspread, stepped back and fell with a thunderous crash. I had managed to\nknock him off balance, maybe stun him.\n\nI struggled to remember where I was in the code sequence; I went on,\nkeyed the rest. I pushed; nothing. I must have lost count. I started\nagain.\n\nI heard the armored man coming on again. The needler trick wouldn't work\ntwice. I kept working. I had almost completed the sequence when I felt\nthe powered grip of the suited man on my arm. I twisted, jammed the\nneedler against his hand, and fired. The arm flew back, and even through\nthe suit I heard his wrist snap. My own hand was numb from the recoil.\nThe other arm of the suit swept down and struck my wounded arm. I\nstaggered away from the door, dazed with the pain.\n\nI side-stepped in time to miss another ponderous blow. Under two and a\nhalf gees, the man in the suit was having a hard time, even with power\nassisted controls. I felt that I was fighting a machine instead of a\nman.\n\nAs he stepped toward me again, I aimed at his foot. A concentrated\nstream of needles hit, like a metallic fire hose, knocked the foot\naside, toppled the man again. I staggered back to my door.\n\nBut now I realized I couldn't risk opening it; even if I got in, I\ncouldn't keep my suited assailant from crowding in with me. Already he\nwas up, lurching toward me. I had to draw him away from the door.\n\nThe shuttle sat unmoving. The mob kept its distance. I wondered why no\none was shooting; I guessed they had realized that if I were killed\nthere would be no way to enter the vital control areas of the ship; they\nhad to take me alive.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI made it past the clumsy armored man and started down the corridor\ntoward the shuttle. I moved as slowly as I could while still eluding\nhim. He lumbered after me. I reached the shuttle; a glance showed no one\nalive there. Two men lay across it. I pulled myself onto it and threw in\nthe forward lever. The shuttle rolled smoothly past the armored man,\nstriking him a glancing blow that sent him down again. Those falls, in\nthe multi-gee field, were bone crushing. He didn't get up.\n\nI reached the door again, rolled off the shuttle, and reached for the\ncombination. I wished now I'd used a shorter one. I started again; heard\na noise behind me. As I turned, a heavy weight crushed me against the\ndoor.\n\nI was held rigid, my chest against the combination key. The pressure was\ncracking my ribs and still it increased. I twisted my head, gasping. The\nshuttle held me pinned to the door. The man I had assumed out of action\nwas alive enough to hold the lever down with savage strength. I tried to\nshout, to remind him that without me to open the doors, they were\npowerless to save the ship. I couldn't speak. I tasted blood in my\nmouth, and tried to breathe. I couldn't. I passed out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\nI emerged into consciousness to find the pressure gone, but a red haze\nof pain remained. I lay on my back and saw men sitting on the floor\naround me.\n\nA blow from somewhere made my head ring. I tried to sit up. I couldn't\nmake it. Then Kramer was beside me, slipping a needle into my arm. He\nlooked pretty bad himself. His face was bandaged heavily, and one eye\nwas purple. He spoke in a muffled voice through stiff jaws. His tone was\ndeliberate.\n\n\"This will keep you conscious enough to answer a few questions,\" he\nsaid. \"Now you're going to give me the combinations to the locks so we\ncan call off this suicide run; then maybe I'll doctor you up.\"\n\nI didn't answer.\n\n\"The time for clamming up is over, you stupid braggard,\" Kramer said. He\nraised his fist and drove a hard punch into my chest. I guess it was his\nshot that kept me conscious. I couldn't breathe for a while, until\nKramer gave me a few whiffs of oxygen. I wondered if he was fool enough\nto think I might give up my ship.\n\nAfter a while my head cleared a little. I tried to say something. I got\nout a couple of croaks, and then found my voice.\n\n\"Kramer,\" I said.\n\nHe leaned over me. \"I'm listening,\" he said.\n\n\"Take me to the lift. Leave me there alone. That's your only chance.\" It\nseemed to me like a long speech, but nothing happened. Kramer went away,\ncame back. He showed me a large scalpel from his medical kit. \"I'm going\nto start operating on your face. I'll make you into a museum freak.\nMaybe if you start talking soon enough I'll change my mind.\"\n\nI could see the watch on his wrist. My mind worked very slowly. I had\ntrouble getting any air into my lungs. We would intercept in one hour\nand ten minutes.\n\nIt seemed simple to me. I had to get back to the Bridge before we hit. I\ntried again. \"We only have an hour,\" I said.\n\nKramer lost control. He jabbed the knife at my face, screeching through\ngritted teeth. I jerked my head aside far enough that the scalpel grated\nalong my cheekbone instead of slashing my mouth. I hardly felt it.\n\n\"We're not dying because you were a fool,\" Kramer yelled. \"I've taken\nover; I've relieved you as unfit for command. Now open up this ship or\nI'll slice you to ribbons.\" He held the scalpel under my nose in a fist\ntrembling with fury. The chrome plated blade had a thin film of pink on\nit.\n\nI got my voice going again. \"I'm going to destroy the Mancji ship,\" I\nsaid. \"Take me to the lift and leave me there.\" I tried to add a few\nwords, but had to stop and work on breathing again for a while. Kramer\ndisappeared.\n\nI realized I was not fully in command of my senses. I was clamped in a\npadded claw. I wanted to roll over. I tried hard, and made it. I could\nhear Kramer talking, others answering, but it seemed too great an effort\nto listen to the words.\n\nI was lying on my face now, head almost against the wall. There was a\nblack line in front of me, a door. My head cleared a bit. It must have\nbeen Kramer's shot working on me. I turned my head and saw Kramer\nstanding now with half a dozen others, all talking at once. Apparently\nKramer's display of uncontrolled temper had the others worried. They\nwanted me alive. Kramer didn't like anyone criticizing him. The argument\nwas pretty violent. There was scuffling--and shouts.\n\nI saw that I lay about twenty feet from the lift; too far. The door\nbefore me, if I remembered the ship's layout, was a utility room, small\nand containing nothing but a waste disposal hopper. But it did have a\nbolt on the inside, like every other room on the ship.\n\nI didn't stop to think about it; I started trying to get up. If I'd\nthought I would have known that at the first move from me all seven of\nthem would land on me at once. I concentrated on getting my hands under\nme, to push up. I heard a shout, and turning my head, saw Kramer\nswinging at someone. I went on with my project.\n\nHands under my chest, I raised myself a little, and got a knee up. I\nfelt broken rib ends grating, but felt no pain, just the padded claw.\nThen I was weaving on all fours. I looked up, spotted the latch on the\ndoor, and put everything I had into lunging at it. My finger hit it, the\ndoor swung in, and I fell on my face; but I was half in. Another lunge\nand I was past the door, kicking it shut as I lay on the floor, reaching\nfor the lock control. Just as I flipped it with an extended finger,\nsomeone hit the door from outside, a second too late.\n\nIt was dark, and I lay on my back on the floor, and felt strange\nshort-circuited stabs of what would have been agonizing pain running\nthrough my chest and arm. I had a few minutes to rest now, before they\nblasted the door open.\n\nI hated to lose like this, not because we were beaten, but because we\nwere giving up. My poor world, no longer fair and green, had found the\nstrength to send us out as her last hope. But somewhere out here in the\nloneliness and distance we had lost our courage. Success was at our\nfingertips, if we could have found it; instead, in panic and madness, we\nwere destroying ourselves.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy mind wandered; I imagined myself on the Bridge, half-believed I was\nthere. I was resting on the OD bunk, and Clay was standing beside me. A\nlong time seemed to pass.... Then I remembered I was on the floor,\nbleeding internally, in a tiny room that would soon lose its door. But\nthere was someone standing beside me.\n\nI didn't feel too disappointed at being beaten; I hadn't hoped for much\nmore than a breather, anyway. I wondered why this fellow had abandoned\nhis action station to hide there. The door was still shut. He must have\nbeen there all along, but I hadn't seen him when I came in. He stood\nover me, wearing greasy overalls, and grinned down at me. He raised his\nhand. I was getting pretty indifferent to blows; I couldn't feel them.\n\nThe hand went up, the man straightened and held a fairly snappy salute.\n\"Sir,\" he said. \"Space'n first class Thomas.\"\n\nI didn't feel like laughing or cheering or anything else; I just took it\nas it came.\n\n\"At ease, Thomas,\" I managed to say. \"Why aren't you at your duty\nstation?\" I went spinning off somewhere after that oration.\n\nThomas was squatting beside me now. \"Cap'n, you're hurt, ain't you? I\nwas wonderin' why you was down here layin down in my 'Sposal station.\"\n\n\"A scratch,\" I said. I thought about it for a while. Thomas was doing\nsomething about my chest. This was Thomas' disposal station. Thomas\nowned it. I wondered if a fellow could make a living with such a small\nplace way out here, with just an occasional tourist coming by. I\nwondered why I didn't send one of them for help; I needed help for some\nreason....\n\n\"Cap'n, I been overhaulin' my converter units, I jist come in. How long\nyou been in here, Cap'n?\" Thomas was worried about something.\n\nI tried hard to think. I hadn't been here very long; just a few minutes.\nI had come here to rest.... Then suddenly I was thinking clearly again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhatever Thomas was, he was apparently on my side, or at least neutral.\nHe didn't seem to be aware of the mutiny. I realized that he had bound\nmy chest tightly with strips of shirt; it felt better.\n\n\"What are you doing in here, Thomas?\" I asked. \"Don't you know we're in\naction against a hostile ship?\"\n\nThomas looked surprised. \"This here's my action station, Cap'n,\" he\nsaid. \"I'm a Waste Recovery Technician, First Class, I keep the recovery\nsystem operatin'.\"\n\n\"You just stay in here?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, sir,\" Thomas said. \"I check through the whole system. We got three\nmain disposal points and lots a little ones, an' I have to keep\neverything operatin'. Otherwise this ship would be in a bad way, Cap'n.\"\n\n\"How did you get in here?\" I asked. I looked around the small room.\nThere was only one door, and the gray bulk of the converter unit which\nbroke down wastes into their component elements for re-use nearly filled\nthe tiny space.\n\n\"I come in through the duct, Cap'n,\" Thomas said. \"I check the ducts\nevery day. You know, Cap'n,\" he said shaking his head, \"they's some bad\nlaid-out ductin' in this here system. If I didn't keep after it, you'd\nbe gettin' clogged ducts all the time. So I jist go through the system\nand keep her clear.\"\n\nFrom somewhere, hope began again. \"Where do these ducts lead?\" I asked.\nI wondered how the man could ignore the mutiny going on around him.\n\n\"Well, sir, one leads to the mess; that's the big one. One leads to the\nwardroom, and the other one leads up to the Bridge.\"\n\nMy God, I thought, the Bridge.\n\n\"How big are they?\" I asked. \"Could I get through them?\"\n\n\"Oh, sure, Cap'n,\" Thomas said. \"You can get through 'em easy. But are\nyou sure you feel like inspectin' with them busted ribs?\"\n\nI was beginning to realize that Thomas was not precisely a genius. \"I\ncan make it,\" I said.\n\n\"Cap'n,\" Thomas said diffidently, \"it ain't none a my business, but\ndon't you think maybe I better get the doctor for ya?\"\n\n\"Thomas,\" I said, \"maybe you don't know; there's a mutiny under way\naboard this ship. The doctor is leading it. I want to get to the Bridge\nin the worst way. Let's get started.\"\n\nThomas looked very shocked. \"Cap'n, you mean you was hurt by somebody? I\nmean you didn't have a fall or nothin', you was beat up?\" He stared at\nme with an expression of incredulous horror.\n\n\"That's about the size of it,\" I said. I managed to sit up. Thomas\njumped forward and helped me to my feet. Then I saw that he was crying.\n\n\"You can count on me, Cap'n,\" he said. \"Jist lemme know who done it, an'\nI'll feed 'em into my converter.\"\n\nI stood leaning against the wall, waiting for my head to stop spinning.\nBreathing was difficult, but if I kept it shallow, I could manage.\nThomas was opening a panel on the side of the converter unit.\n\n\"It's O.K. to go in Cap'n,\" he said. \"She ain't operatin'.\"\n\nThe pull of the two and a half gees seemed to bother him very little. I\ncould barely stand under it, holding on. Thomas saw my wavering step and\njumped to help me. He boosted me into the chamber of the converter and\npointed out an opening near the top, about twelve by twenty-four inches.\n\n\"That there one is to the Bridge, Cap'n,\" he said. \"If you'll start in\nthere, sir, I'll follow up.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI thrust head and shoulders into the opening. Inside it was smooth\nmetal, with no handholds. I clawed at it trying to get farther in. The\npain stabbed at my chest.\n\n\"Cap'n, they're workin' on the door,\" Thomas said. \"They already been at\nit for a little while. We better get goin'.\"\n\n\"You'd better give me a push, Thomas,\" I said. My voice echoed hollowly\ndown the duct.\n\nThomas crowded into the chamber behind me then, lifting my legs and\npushing. I eased into the duct. The pain was not so bad now.\n\n\"Cap'n, you gotta use a special kinda crawl to get through these here\nducts,\" Thomas said. \"You grip your hands together out in front of ya,\nand then bend your elbows. When your elbows jam against the side of the\nduct, you pull forward.\"\n\nI tried it; it was slow, but it worked.\n\n\"Cap'n,\" Thomas said behind me. \"We got about seven minutes now to get\nup there. I set the control on the converter to start up in ten minutes.\nI think we can make it O.K., and ain't nobody else comin' this way with\nthe converter goin'. I locked the control panel so they can't shut her\ndown.\"\n\nThat news spurred me on. With the converter in operation, the first step\nin the cycle was the evacuation of the ducts to a near-perfect vacuum.\nWhen that happened, we would die instantly with ruptured lungs; then our\ndead bodies would be sucked into the chamber and broken down into useful\nraw materials. I hurried.\n\nI tried to orient myself. The duct paralleled the corridor. It would\ncontinue in that direction for about fifteen feet, and would then turn\nupward, since the Bridge was some fifteen feet above this level. I\nhitched along, and felt the duct begin to trend upward.\n\n\"You'll have to get on your back here, Cap'n,\" Thomas said. \"She widens\nout on the turn.\"\n\nI managed to twist over. Thomas was helping me by pushing at my feet. As\nI reached a near-vertical position, I felt a metal rod under my hand.\nThat was a relief; I had been expecting to have to go up the last\nstretch the way a mountain climber does a rock chimney, back against one\nwall and feet against the other.\n\nI hauled at the rod, and found another with my other hand. Below, Thomas\nboosted me. I groped up and got another, then another. The remaining\nslight slant of the duct helped. Finally my feet were on the rods. I\nclung, panting. The heat in the duct was terrific. Then I went on up.\nThat was some shot Kramer had given me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbove I could see the end of the duct faintly in the light coming up\nthrough the open chamber door from the utility room. I remembered the\nlocation of the disposal slot on the Bridge now; it had been installed\nin the small apartment containing a bunk and a tiny galley for the use\nof the Duty Officer during long watches on the Bridge.\n\nI reached the top of the duct and pushed against the slot cover. It\nswung out easily. I could see the end of the chart table, and beyond,\nthe dead radar screen. I reached through and heaved myself partly out. I\nnearly fainted at the stab from my ribs as my weight went on my chest.\nMy head sang. The light from below suddenly went out. I heard a muffled\nclank; then a hum began, echoing up the duct.\n\n\"She's closed and started cyclin' the air out, Cap'n,\" Thomas said\ncalmly. \"We got about half a minute.\"\n\nI clamped my teeth together and heaved again. Below me Thomas waited\nquietly. He couldn't help me now. I got my hands flat against the\nbulkhead and thrust. The air was whistling around my face. Papers began\nto swirl off the chart table. I twisted my body frantically, kicking\nloose from the grip of the slot, fighting the sucking pull of air. I\nfell to the floor inside the room, the slot cover slamming behind me. I\nstaggered to my feet. I pried at the cover, but I couldn't open it\nagainst the vacuum. Then it budged, and Thomas' hand came through. The\nmetal edge cut into it, blood started, but the cover was held open half\nan inch. I reached the chart table, almost falling over my leaden feet,\nseized a short permal T-square, and levered the cover up. Once started,\nit went up easily. Thomas face appeared, drawn and pale, eyes closed\nagainst the dust being whirled into his face. He got his arms through,\nheaved himself a little higher. I seized his arm and pulled. He\nscrambled through.\n\nI knocked the T-square out of the way and the cover snapped down. Then I\nslid to the floor, not exactly out, but needing a break pretty bad.\nThomas brought bedding from the OD bunk and made me comfortable on the\nfloor.\n\n\"Thomas,\" I said, \"when I think of what the security inspectors who\napproved the plans for this arrangement are going to say when I call\nthis little back door to their attention, it almost makes it worth the\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Thomas said. He sprawled on the deck and looked around the\nBridge, staring at the unfamiliar screens, indicator dials, controls.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom where I lay, I could see the direct vision screen. I wasn't sure,\nbut I thought the small bright object in the center of it might be our\ntarget. Thomas looked at the dead radar screen, then said, \"Cap'n, that\nthere radarscope out of action?\"\n\n\"It sure is, Thomas,\" I said. \"Our unknown friends blew the works before\nthey left us.\" I was surprised that he recognized a radarscope.\n\n\"Mind if I take a look at it, Cap'n?\" he said.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" I replied. I tried to explain the situation to Thomas. The\nelapsed time since we had started our pursuit was two hours and ten\nminutes; I wanted to close to no more than a twenty mile gap before\nlaunching my missiles; and I had better alert my interceptor missiles in\ncase the Mancji hit first.\n\nThomas had the cover off the radar panel and was probing around. He\npulled a blackened card out of the interior of the panel.\n\n\"Looks like they overloaded the fuse,\" Thomas said. \"Got any spares,\nCap'n?\"\n\n\"Right beside you in the cabinet,\" I said. \"How do you know your way\naround a radar set, Thomas?\"\n\nThomas grinned. \"I useta be a radar technician third before I got inta\nwaste disposal,\" he said. \"I had to change specialities to sign on for\nthis cruise.\"\n\nI had an idea there'd be an opening for Thomas a little higher up when\nthis was over.\n\nI asked him to take a look at the televideo, too. I was beginning to\nrealize that Thomas was not really simple; he was merely uncomplicated.\n\n\"Tubes blowed here, Cap'n,\" he reported. \"Like as if you was to set her\nup to high mag right near a sun; she was overloaded. I can fix her easy\nif we got the spares.\"\n\nI didn't take time to try to figure that one out. I could feel the\ndizziness coming on again.\n\n\"Thomas,\" I called, \"let me know when we're at twenty miles from\ntarget.\" I wanted to tell him more, but I could feel consciousness\ndraining away. \"Then ...\" I managed, \"first aid kit ... shot....\"\n\nI could still hear Thomas. I was flying away, whirling, but I could hear\nhis voice. \"Cap'n, I could fire your missiles now, if you was to want me\nto,\" he was saying. I struggled to speak. \"No. Wait.\" I hoped he heard\nme.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI floated a long time in a strange state between coma and consciousness.\nThe stuff Kramer had given me was potent. It kept my mind fairly clear\neven when my senses were out of action. I thought about the situation\naboard my ship.\n\nI wondered what Kramer and his men were planning now, how they felt\nabout having let me slip through their fingers. The only thing they\ncould try now was blasting their way into the Bridge. They'd never make\nit. The designers of these ships were not unaware of the hazards of\nspace life; the Bridge was an unassailable fortress. They couldn't\npossibly get to it.\n\nI guessed that Kramer was having a pretty rough time of it now. He had\nconvinced the men that we were rushing headlong to sure destruction at\nthe hands of the all-powerful Mancji, and that their Captain was a fool.\nNow he was trapped with them in the panic he had helped to create. I\nthought that in all probability they had torn him apart.\n\nI wavered in and out of consciousness. It was just as well; I needed the\nrest. Then I heard Thomas calling me. \"We're closin' now, Cap'n,\" he\nsaid. \"Wake up, Cap'n, only twenty-three miles now.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said. My body had been preparing itself for this, now it was\nready again. I felt the needle in my arm. That helped, too.\n\n\"Hand me the intercom, Thomas,\" I said. He placed the mike in my hand. I\nkeyed for a general announcement.\n\n\"This is the Captain,\" I said. I tried to keep my voice as steady as\npossible. \"We are now at a distance of twenty-one miles from the enemy.\nStand by for missile launching and possible evasive action. Damage\ncontrol crews on the alert.\" I paused for breath.\n\n\"Now we're going to take out the Mancji ship, men,\" I said. \"All two\nmiles of it.\"\n\nI dropped the mike and groped for the firing key. Thomas handed it to\nme.\n\n\"Cap'n,\" he said, bending over me. \"I notice you got the selector set\nfor your chemical warheads. You wouldn't want me to set up pluto heads\nfor ya, would ya, Cap'n?\"\n\n\"No, thanks, Thomas,\" I said. \"Chemical is what I want. Stand by to\nobserve.\" I pressed the firing key.\n\nThomas was at the radarscope. \"Missiles away, Cap'n. Trackin' O.K. Looks\nlike they'll take out the left half a that dumbbell.\"\n\nI found the mike again. \"Missiles homing on target,\" I said. \"Strike in\nthirty-five seconds. You'll be interested to know we're employing\nchemical warheads. So far there is no sign of offense or defense from\nthe enemy.\" I figured the news would shock a few mutineers. David wasn't\neven using his slingshot on Goliath. He was going after him bare-handed.\nI wanted to scare some kind of response out of them. I needed a few\nclues as to what was going on below.\n\nI got it. Joyce's voice came from the wall annunciator. \"Captain, this\nis Lt. Joyce reporting.\" He sounded scared all the way through, and\ndesperate. \"Sir, the mutiny has been successfully suppressed by the\nloyal members of the crew. Major Kramer is under arrest. We're prepared\nto go on with the search for the Omega Colony. But Sir ...\" he paused,\ngulping. \"We ask you to change course now before launching any effective\nattack. We still have a chance. Maybe they won't bother with us when\nthose firecrackers go off ...\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI watched the direct vision screen. Zero second closed in. And on the\nscreen the face of the left hand disk of the Mancji ship was lit\nmomentarily by a brilliant spark of yellow, then another. A\ndiscoloration showed dimly against the dark metallic surface. It spread,\nand a faint vapor formed over it. Now tiny specs could be seen moving\naway from the ship. The disk elongated, with infinite leisure, widening.\n\n\"What's happenin'? Cap'n?\" Thomas asked. He was staring at the scope in\nfascination. \"They launchin' scouts, or what?\"\n\n\"Take a look here, Thomas,\" I said. \"The ship is breaking up.\"\n\nThe disk was an impossibly long ellipse now, surrounded by a vast array\nof smaller bodies, fragments and contents of the ship. Now the stricken\nglobe moved completely free of its companion. It rotated, presenting a\ncrescent toward us, then wheeled farther as it receded from its twin,\nshowing its elongation. The sphere had split wide open. Now the\nshattered half itself separated into two halves, and these in turn\ncrumbled, strewing debris in a widening spiral.\n\n\"My God, Cap'n,\" Thomas said in awe. \"That's the greatest display I ever\nseen. And all it took to set her off was 200 kilos a PBL. Now that's\nsomethin'.\"\n\nI keyed the mike again. \"This is the Captain,\" I said. \"I want ten\nfour-man patrols ready to go out in fifteen minutes. The enemy ship has\nbeen put out of action and is now in a derelict condition. I want only\none thing from her; one live prisoner. All Section chiefs report to me\non the Bridge on the triple.\"\n\n\"Thomas,\" I said, \"go down in the lift and open up for the Chiefs.\nHere's the release key for the combination; you know how to operate it?\"\n\n\"Sure, Cap'n; but are you sure you want to let them boys in here after\nthe way they jumped you an' all?\"\n\nI opened my mouth to answer, but he beat me to it. \"Fergit I asked ya\nthat, Cap'n, pleasir. You ain't been wrong yet.\"\n\n\"It's O.K., Thomas,\" I said. \"There won't be any more trouble.\"\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE\n\n\nOn the eve of the twentieth anniversary of Reunion Day, a throng of\nwell-heeled celebrants filled the dining room and overflowed onto the\nterraces of the Star Tower Dining Room, from whose 5,700 foot height\nabove the beaches, the Florida Keys, a hundred miles to the south, were\nvisible on clear days.\n\nThe _Era_ reporter stood beside the vast glass entry way surveying the\ncrowd, searching for celebrities from whom he might elicit bits of color\nto spice the day's transmission.\n\nAt the far side of the room, surrounded by chattering admirers, stood\nthe Ambassador from the New Terran Federation; a portly, graying, jolly\nex-Naval officer. A minor actress passed at close range, looking the\nother way. A cabinet member stood at the bar talking earnestly to a ball\nplayer, ignoring a group of hopeful reporters and fans.\n\nThe _Era_ stringer, an experienced hand, passed over the hard pressed\nVIP's near the center of the room and started a face-by-face check of\nthe less gregarious diners seated at obscure tables along the sides of\nthe room.\n\nHe was in luck; the straight-backed gray-haired figure in the dark\ncivilian suit, sitting alone at a tiny table in an alcove, caught his\neye. He moved closer, straining for a clear glimpse through the crowd.\nThen he was sure. He had the biggest possible catch of the day in his\nsights; Admiral of Fleets Frederick Greylorn.\n\nThe reporter hesitated; he was well aware of the Admiral's reputation\nfor near-absolute silence on the subject of his already legendary\ncruise, the fabulous voyage of the _Galahad_. He couldn't just barge in\non the Admiral and demand answers, as was usual with publicity-hungry\npoliticians and show people. He could score the biggest story of the\ncentury today; but he had to hit him right.\n\nYou couldn't hope to snow a man like the Admiral; he wasn't somebody you\ncould push around. You could sense the solid iron of him from here.\n\nNobody else had noticed the solitary diner. The _Era_ man drifted\ncloser, moving unhurriedly, thinking furiously. It was no good trying\nsome tricky approach; his best bet was the straight-from-the-shoulder\nbit. No point in hesitating. He stopped beside the table.\n\nThe Admiral was looking out across the Gulf. He turned and glanced up at\nthe reporter.\n\nThe news man looked him squarely in the eye. \"I'm a reporter, Admiral,\"\nhe said. \"Will you talk to me?\"\n\nThe Admiral nodded to the seat across from him. \"Sit down,\" he said. He\nglanced around the room.\n\nThe reporter caught the look. \"I'll keep it light, sir,\" he said. \"I\ndon't want company either.\" That was being frank.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You want the answers to some questions, don't you?\" the Admiral said.\n\n\"Why, yes, sir,\" the reporter said. He started to inconspicuously key\nhis pocket recorder, but caught himself. \"May I record your remarks,\nAdmiral?\" he said. Frankness all the way.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" said the Admiral.\n\n\"Now, Admiral,\" the reporter began, \"the Terran public has of course\n...\"\n\n\"Never mind the patter, son,\" the Admiral said mildly. \"I know what the\nquestions are. I've read all the memoirs of the crew. They've been\ncoming out at the rate of about two a year for some time now. I had my\nown reasons for not wanting to add anything to my official statement.\"\n\nThe Admiral poured wine into his glass. \"Excuse me,\" he said. \"Will you\njoin me?\" He signalled the waiter.\n\n\"Another wine glass, please,\" he said. He looked at the golden wine in\nthe glass, held it up to the light. \"You know, the Florida wines are as\ngood as any in the world,\" he said. \"That's not to say the California\nand Ohio wines aren't good. But this Flora Pinellas is a genuine\noriginal, not an imitation Rhine; and it compares favorably with the\nbest of the old vintages, particularly the '87.\"\n\nThe glass arrived and the waiter poured. The reporter had the wit to\nremain silent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The first question is usually, how did I know I could take the Mancji\nship. After all, it was big, vast. It loomed over us like a mountain.\nThe Mancji themselves weighed almost two tons each; they liked six gee\ngravity. They blasted our communication off the air, just for practice.\nThey talked big, too. We were invaders in their territory. They were\namused by us. So where did I get the notion that our attack would be\nanything more than a joke to them? That's the big question.\" The Admiral\nshook his head.\n\n\"The answer is quite simple. In the first place, they were pulling six\ngees by using a primitive dumbbell configuration. The only reason for\nthat type of layout, as students of early space vessel design can tell\nyou, is to simplify setting up a gee field effect using centrifugal\nforce. So they obviously had no gravity field generators.\n\n\"Then their transmission was crude. All they had was simple\nold-fashioned short-range radio, and even that was noisy and erratic.\nAnd their reception was as bad. We had to use a kilowatt before they\ncould pick it up at 200 miles. We didn't know then it was all\norganically generated; that they had no equipment.\"\n\nThe Admiral sipped his wine, frowning at the recollection. \"I was pretty\nsure they were bluffing when I changed course and started after them. I\nhad to hold our acceleration down to two and a half gees because I had\nto be able to move around the ship. And at that acceleration we gained\non them. They couldn't beat us. And it wasn't because they couldn't take\nhigh gees; they liked six for comfort, you remember. No, they just\ndidn't have the power.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Admiral looked out the window.\n\n\"Add to that the fact that they apparently couldn't generate ordinary\nelectric current. I admit that none of this was conclusive, but after\nall, if I was wrong we were sunk anyway. When Thomas told me the nature\nof the damage to our radar and communications systems, that was another\nhint. Their big display of Mancji power was just a blast of radiation\nright across the communication spectrum; it burned tubes and blew fuses;\nnothing else. We were back in operation an hour after our attack.\n\n\"The evidence was there to see, but there's something about giant size\nthat gets people rattled. Size alone doesn't mean a thing. It's rather\nlike the bluff the Soviets ran on the rest of the world for a couple of\ndecades back in the war era, just because they sprawled across half the\nglobe. They were a giant, though it was mostly frozen desert. When the\nshowdown came they didn't have it. They were a pushover.\n\n\"All right, the next question is why did I choose H. E. instead of going\nin with everything I had? That's easy, too. What I wanted was\ninformation, not revenge. I still had the heavy stuff in reserve and\nready to go if I needed it, but first I had to try to take them alive.\nVaporizing them wouldn't have helped our position. And I was lucky; it\nworked.\n\n\"The, ah, confusion below evaporated as soon as the Section chiefs got a\nlook at the screens and realized that we had actually knocked out the\nMancji. We matched speeds with the wreckage and the patrols went out to\nlook for a piece of ship with a survivor in it. If we'd had no luck we\nwould have tackled the other half of the ship, which was still intact\nand moving off fast. But we got quite a shock when we found the nature\nof the wreckage.\" The Admiral grinned.\n\n\"Of course today everybody knows all about the Mancji hive intelligence,\nand their evolutionary history. But we were pretty startled to find that\nthe only wreckage consisted of the Mancji themselves, each two-ton slug\nin his own hard chitin shell. Of course, a lot of the cells were\nruptured by the explosions, but most of them had simply disassociated\nfrom the hive mass as it broke up. So there was no ship; just a cluster\nof cells like a giant bee hive, and mixed up among the slugs, the\ndamnedest collection of loot you can imagine. The odds and ends they'd\nstolen and tucked away in the hive during a couple hundred years of\ncamp-following.\n\n\"The patrols brought a couple of cells alongside, and Mannion went out\nto try to establish contact. Sure enough, he got a very faint\ntransmission, on the same bands as before. The cells were talking to\neach other in their own language. They ignored Mannion even though his\ntransmission must have blanketed everything within several hundred\nmiles. We eventually brought one of them into the cargo lock and started\ntrying different wave-lengths on it. Then Kramer had the idea of\nplanting a couple of electrodes and shooting a little juice to it. Of\ncourse, it loved the DC, but as soon as we tried AC, it gave up. So we\nhad a long talk with it and found out everything we needed to know.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"It was a four-week run to the nearest outpost planet of the New Terran\nFederation, and they took me on to New Terra aboard one of their fast\nliaison vessels. The rest you know. We, the home planet, were as lost\nto the New Terrans as they were to us. They greeted us as though we were\ntheir own ancestors come back to visit them.\n\n\"Most of my crew, for personal reasons, were released from duty there,\nand settled down to stay.\n\n\"The clean-up job here on Earth was a minor operation to their Navy. As\nI recall, the trip back was made in a little over five months, and the\nRed Tide was killed within four weeks of the day the task force arrived.\nI don't think they wasted a motion. One explosive charge per cell, of\njust sufficient size to disrupt the nucleus. When the critical number of\ncells had been killed, the rest died overnight.\n\n\"It was quite a different Earth that emerged from under the plague,\nthough. You know it had taken over all of the land area except North\nAmerica and a strip of Western Europe, and all of the sea it wanted. It\nwas particularly concentrated over what had been the jungle areas of\nSouth America, Africa, and Asia. You must realize that in the days\nbefore the Tide, those areas were almost completely uninhabitable. You\nhave no idea what the term Jungle really implied. When the Tide died, it\ndisintegrated into its component molecules; and the result was that all\nthose vast fertile Jungle lands were now beautifully levelled and\ncompletely cleared areas covered with up to twenty feet of the richest\ntopsoil imaginable. That was what made it possible for old Terra to\nbecome what she is today; the Federation's truck farm, and the sole\nsource of those genuine original Terran foods that all the rest of the\nworlds pay such fabulous prices for.\n\n\"Strange how quickly we forget. Few people today remember how we loathed\nand feared the Tide when we were fighting it. Now it's dismissed as a\nblessing in disguise.\"\n\nThe Admiral paused. \"Well,\" he said, \"I think that answers the questions\nand gives you a bit of homespun philosophy to go with it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Admiral,\" said the reporter, \"you've given the public some facts it's\nwaited a long time to hear. Coming from you, sir, this is the greatest\nstory that could have come out of this Reunion Day celebration. But\nthere is one question more, if I may ask it. Can you tell me, Admiral,\njust how it was that you rejected what seemed to be prima facie proof of\nthe story the Mancji told; that they were the lords of creation out\nthere, and that humanity was nothing but a tame food animal to them?\"\n\nThe Admiral sighed. \"I guess it's a good question,\" he said. \"But there\nwas nothing supernatural about my figuring that one. I didn't suspect\nthe full truth, of course. It never occurred to me that we were the\nvictims of the now well-known but still inexplicable sense of humor of\nthe Mancji, or that they were nothing but scavengers around the edges of\nthe Federation. The original Omega ship had met them and seen right\nthrough them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Well, when this hive spotted us coming in, they knew enough about New\nTerra to realize at once that we were strangers, coming from outside the\narea. It appealed to their sense of humor to have the gall to strut\nright out in front of us and try to put over a swindle. What a laugh for\nthe oyster kingdom if they could sell Terrans on the idea that they were\nthe master race. It never occurred to them that we might be anything but\nTerrans; Terrans who didn't know the Mancji. And they were canny enough\nto use an old form of Interlingua; somewhere they'd met men before.\n\n\"Then we needed food. They knew what we ate, and that was where they\nwent too far. They had, among the flotsam in their hive, a few human\nbodies they had picked up from some wreck they'd come across in their\ntravels. They had them stashed away like everything else they could lay\na pseudopod on. So they stacked them the way they'd seen Terran frozen\nfoods shipped in the past, and sent them over. Another of their little\njokes.\n\n\"I suppose if you're already overwrought and eager to quit, and you've\nbeen badly scared by the size of an alien ship, it's pretty\nunderstandable that the sight of human bodies, along with the story that\nthey're just a convenient food supply, might seem pretty convincing. But\nI was already pretty dubious about the genuineness of our pals, and when\nI saw those bodies it was pretty plain that we were hot on the trail of\nOmega Colony. There was no other place humans could have come from out\nthere. We had to find out the location from the Mancji.\"\n\n\"But, Admiral,\" said the reporter, \"true enough they were humans, and\npresumably had some connection with the colony, but they were naked\ncorpses stacked like cordwood. The Mancji had stated that these were\nslaves, or rather domesticated animals; they wouldn't have done you any\ngood.\"\n\n\"Well, you see, I didn't believe that,\" the Admiral said. \"Because it\nwas an obvious lie. I tried to show some of the officers, but I'm afraid\nthey weren't being too rational just then.\n\n\"I went into the locker and examined those bodies; if Kramer had looked\nclosely, he would have seen what I did. These were no tame animals. They\nwere civilized men.\"\n\n\"How could you be sure, Admiral? They had no clothing, no identifying\nmarks, nothing.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http://pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
