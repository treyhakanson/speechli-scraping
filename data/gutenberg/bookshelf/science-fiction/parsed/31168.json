It leads him to an island of unearthly peril.]\n\n\n\"S O S. S O S. S O S.\" Three short, three long, three short, the\nflashes winked from the dark headland. Dan McNally, master and owner\nof the small and ancient trading schooner, _Virginia_, caught the\nfeeble flickering light from the island as he strode across the\nfore-deck. He stopped, stared at the looming black line of land\nbeneath the tropical stars. Again light flashed from a point of rock\nfar above the dim white line of phosphorescent surf, spelling out the\nsignal of distress.\n\n\"Somebody bane callin' with a flashlight, I t'ank,\" the big Swede,\nLarsen, rumbled from the wheel.\n\nDan thought suddenly of a reply. He rushed into the charthouse, to\nreturn in a moment with a lighted lantern and a copy of the _Nautical\nAlmanac_ which would serve to hide the flame between flashes. He\nflashed an answer.\n\nAgain the pale light flickered from the dark mass of land, spelling\nwords out rather slowly, as if the sender were uncertain in his\nknowledge of Morse. Surprised as Dan had been by the signal from an\nisland marked on the charts as uninhabited, he was astonished at the\nmessage that now came to him.\n\n\"You are in terrible danger,\" he read in the flashes. \"Dreadful thing\nhere. Hurry away. Radio for warships. I am--\"\n\nThe winking light suddenly went out. Dan strained his eyes to watch\nthe point where it had been, and a few seconds later he saw a curious\nthing. A darting, stabbing lance of green fire flashed out across the\nbarren, rocky cliff, lighting it fleetingly with pale green radiance.\nIt leapt out and was gone in an instant, leaving the shoulder of the\nisland dark as before.\n\nDan watched for long minutes, but he saw nothing more brilliant than\nthe pale gleam of phosphorescence where the waves dashed against the\nsheer granite wall of the island.\n\n\"What you t'ank?\" Larsen broke in upon him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDan started, then answered slowly. \"I don't know. First I thought\nthere must be a lunatic at large. But that green light! I didn't like\nit.\"\n\nHe stared again at the looming mass of the island. Davis Island is one\nof the innumerable tiny islets that dot the South Pacific; merely the\nsummit of a dead volcano, projecting above the sea. Nominally claimed\nby Great Britain, it is marked on the charts as uninhabited.\n\n\"Radio for warships, eh?\" he muttered. A wireless transmitter was one\nof many modern innovations that the _Virginia_ did not boast. She had\nbeen gathering copra and shell among the islands long before such\nthings came into common use, though Dan had invested his modest\nsavings in her only a year before.\n\n\"What would anyone want with warships on Davis Island?\" The name\nroused a vague memory. \"Davis Island?\" he repeated, staring in\nconcentration at the black sea. \"Of course!\" It came to him suddenly.\nA newspaper article that he had read five years before, at about the\ntime he had abandoned college in the middle of his junior year, to\nfollow the call of adventure.\n\nThe account had dealt with an eclipse of the sun, visible only from\ncertain points on the Pacific. One Dr. Hunter, under the auspices of a\nWestern university, had sailed with his instruments and assistants to\nDavis Island, to study the solar corona during the few precious\nmoments when the shadow covered the sun, and to observe the\ndisplacement of certain stars as a test of Einstein's theory of\nrelativity.\n\nThe reporter had interviewed the party at San Francisco, on the eve of\nsailing. There had been photographs of the chartered vessel, of Dr.\nHunter and his instruments, and of his daughter, Helen, who acted as\nhis secretary. She looked not at all like a scientist, Dan recalled.\nIn fact, her face had seemed rather pretty, even in the blurred\nnewspaper half-tone.\n\nBut the memory cast no light upon the present puzzle. In the rambling\nyears that had led him to this spot upon the old _Virginia_, he had\nlost touch with the science that had interested him during his college\ndays. He had heard nothing of the results of the Hunter expedition.\nBut this island had been its destination.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned decisively to the man at the wheel. \"Larsen, we'll stand\nwell offshore till daylight,\" he said. \"Then, unless we see something\nunusual, we can sail in and land a boat to--\"\n\nThe sentence was never finished. Through the corner of his eye, Dan\nsaw a ray of green light darting toward them from the island. A line\nof green fire seemed to reach out and strike him a physical blow.\nGreen flame flared around him; and somehow he was hurled from the\nbridge, clear of the rail and into the sea.\n\nHis impression of the incident was very confused. He seemed to have\nstruck the water with such force that his breath was knocked out. He\nstruggled back to the surface, strangling, and coughing the bitter\nbrine from his lungs. It was several minutes before he was comfortably\ntreading water, and able to see what had happened.\n\nThe old schooner was then a hundred yards away, careening crazily, and\ndrifting aimlessly before the light breeze. The strange green fire had\nvanished. Parts of the ship apparently had been carried away or\ndisintegrated by the ray or the force of which it was a visible\neffect. The mainmast was down, and was hanging over the side in a\ntangle of rigging.\n\nBright yellow flames were dancing at a dozen points about the wreckage\non the listing deck. A grotesque broken thing, queerly illuminated by\nthe growing fires, was hanging over the wheel--the body of Larsen. No\nliving thing was visible; and Dan, after a second look at the wreck of\nthe bow, knew that he must be the sole survivor of the catastrophe.\n\n\"Too bad about the boys,\" he muttered through teeth that chattered,\nfor the cold water had already chilled him. \"And poor old Larsen.\"\n\nHe thought again of the warning flashed from the shore. \"Guess there\nmust be something hellish afoot after all,\" he muttered again. \"The\nflicker of green that stopped the signals, and the green fire that got\nus--what can they mean?\" He looked toward the looming black shadow of\nthe island, and began divesting himself of his clinging, sodden\ngarments. \"I don't wonder somebody wanted battleships. But even a\nbattleship, if that green ray hit it--\"\n\nHe drew a deep breath and ducked his head while he unlaced his shoes\nand kicked out of them. Then, with a final look at the burning wreck\nof the _Virginia_, he tore off the last bit of his underclothing and\nswam for the shore in an easy crawl.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rocky ramparts of Davis Island were three or four miles away. But\nthere was no wind; the black sea was calm save for a long, hardly\nperceptible swell. A strong swimmer and in superb condition, Dan felt\nno anxiety about being able to make the distance. There was danger,\nhowever, that a shark would run across him, or that he could not find\na landing place upon the rocky shore.\n\nFour bells had rung when he had seen the first flash; it had been just\nten o'clock. And it was some four hours later that Dan touched bottom\nand waded wearily up a bit of smooth hard beach, through palely\nglittering phosphorescent foam.\n\nHe rubbed the brine from his tired limbs, and sat down for a time, in\na spot where a fallen boulder sheltered his naked body from the cool\nmorning wind. In a few moments he rose, flexed his muscles and peered\nthrough the starlit darkness for a way up the cliff behind the beach.\nHe found it impossible to distinguish anything.\n\n\"Got to keep moving, or find some clothes,\" he muttered. \"And I may\nstumble onto what made the green light. Darn lucky I've been so far,\nanyhow. Larsen and the others--but I shan't think of them. Wonder who\nwas flashing the signals from the island. And did the green fire get\nhim?\"\n\nHe turned to look out over the black plain of the sea. Far out, the\n_Virginia_ lay low in the water, a pillar of yellow flame rising from\nher hull. As he watched, the flame flickered and vanished: the old\nschooner, he supposed, had sunk. Then he noticed a pale glow come into\nbeing among the stars on the eastern horizon.\n\n\"Hello,\" he muttered again. \"So we're going to have a moon? In the\nlast quarter, but still it ought to light me up from this beach.\"\n\nA moment later the horns of the crescent had come above the black rim\nof the sea. Dan waited, swinging his arms and tramping up and down on\nthe sand, until the silvery moon had cleared the horizon and\nilluminated the rugged face of the cliff with pale white radiance.\n\nHe chose a path to the top of the cliff and clambered up, emerging in\na jungle-like thicket of brush. Picking his way with the greatest\ncaution, yet scratching his naked skin most painfully, he made his way\nfor a few yards through the brush to a point of vantage from which he\ncould look about.\n\nHe was, he perceived, in a narrow valley or ravine, with rugged black\nwalls rising sheer on either side. The silvery light of the crescent\nmoon fell upon the rank jungle that covered the narrow floor of the\ncanyon, which rose and dwindled as it penetrated inland.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGazing up the canyon, Dan gasped in amazement at what he saw.\n\nMars, the red planet, hung bright and motionless, low in the western\nsky, gleaming with deep bloody radiance. Directly beneath it, bathed\nin the white light of the moon, was a bare, rocky peak that seemed the\nhighest point of the island. And upon that highest pinnacle, that\nchanced to be just below the ruddy star, was an astounding machine.\n\nThree slender towers, of a white metal that gleamed in the moonlight\nwith the silvery luster of aluminum, rose from the rocky peak. They\nsupported, in a horizontal position, an enormous metal ring. It must\nbe, Dan reckoned swiftly, at least a hundred feet in diameter, and\nheld a hundred feet above the summit of the mountain.\n\nThe huge ring gleamed with a strange purple radiance. A shimmering\nmist of red-violet light surrounded it. An unknown force seemed to\nthrob within the mighty ring, drawing the mantle of purple haze about\nit.\n\nAnd suspended inside the ring and below it was a long, slender needle\nof dazzling white light. To Dan, from where he stood in the canyon, it\nseemed a fine, sharp line, though he knew it must be some kind of\npointer, luminous with the strange force pulsing through it.\n\nThe strange needle wavered a little, with quick, uncertain motions.\nThe brilliance of its light varied oddly; it seemed to throb with a\nqueer, irregular rhythm.\n\nAnd the gleaming needle pointed straight at the planet Mars!\n\nDan stood a long time, watching the purple ring upon the silver\ntowers, with the shining white needle hanging below it. He stared at\nMars, glowing like a red and sinister eye above the incredible\nmechanism.\n\nHis mind was in a wild storm of wonder shot with fear. What was the\nmeaning of the gleaming ring and needle? What connection did this\ngreat device have with the signal of distress from the cliff, and the\ngreen fire that had destroyed the _Virginia_? And why did the glowing\nneedle point at Mars?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe did not know when he first began to hear the sound. For a time it\nwas merely part of the strange mystery of the island, only another\nelement in the atmosphere of fear and wonder that surrounded him. Then\nit rose a little, and he became suddenly sharply conscious of it as an\nadditional menace. The sound was not loud, but deep and vibrant. A\nwhir or hum, like that of a powerful, muffled motor, but deeper than\nthe sound of any motor man has ever made. It came down the gorge, from\nthe direction of the machine on the mountain.\n\nThat deep, throbbing noise frightened Dan as none of his previous\nexperiences had done. Shivering from fear as much as from cold, he\ncrouched down beside a huge boulder in the edge of the tangle of brush\nthat covered the bottom of the ravine. His heart pounded wildly. He\nwas in the clutches of an unreasoning fear that some terrible Thing\nhad seen him, and was about to seek him out. For a moment he had to\nuse all his will to keep himself from panic flight through the brush.\nThe unknown is always terrible, and he had invaded the domain of a\nforce he could not understand.\n\nIn a moment, however, he recovered himself. He would be as safe there\nin the jungle, he thought, as anywhere on the island. He thought of\nstarting a fire, then realized that he had no matches, and that he\nwould not dare to make a light if he were able. He pulled a few\nhandfuls of dry grass to make a sort of bed, upon which he huddled up,\nthanking his lucky stars that the island was in semi-tropical\nlatitudes.\n\nHis mind returned again to the riddles that confronted him: the green\nflash and the strange mechanism on the peak. He recalled fantastic\nstories he had read, of hermit scientists conducting amazing\nexperiments in isolated parts of the world. Presently he decided that\nsomething of the kind must be on foot here.\n\n\"The green flash is a sort of a death ray,\" he summed up, aloud. \"And\nthey shoot it from that bright needle. No wonder they don't want to be\nbothered! Somebody may be fixing to upset civilization!\n\n\"But it's queer that the needle points at Mars....\"\n\nOf this last fact, which might have been a clue to the most reasonable\nsolution of the mystery, if a rather astounding one, he was able to\nmake nothing. In fact, huddled up on his pile of grass in some degree\nof comfort, he presently went to sleep, still pondering in vain upon\nthis last clue.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was awakened by a soft, insistent purring sound, rather like that\nof a small electric motor run without load at very high speed.\nRecollection of the night's events came abruptly to him, and he sprang\nto his feet in alarm, finding his muscles sore and stiff from his\ncramped position.\n\nFrom one side Dan heard the rumble of thunder, and, glancing up, saw\nthat the sky above the sea was overcast with a rolling mass of dark,\nmenacing clouds. There was a strange portentous blackness about these\nstorm clouds that filled him with a nameless fear.\n\nSuddenly he was struck with the thought that it was not thunder that\nhad wakened him. The noise he had heard had not the rumbling or\nbooming quality of thunder. As he stood there he again became\nconscious of the low, whirring sound, behind him. He whirled around to\nface it. The shock of what he saw left him momentarily dizzy and\ntrembling--though undoubtedly his surroundings had much to do with its\neffect upon him.\n\nThe sound came from a glistening metal machine which stood half-hidden\nin the brush a dozen yards away _looking at him_!\n\nThe thing was made of a lustrous, silvery metal, which Dan afterwards\nsupposed to be aluminum, or some alloy of that metal. Its gleaming\ncase was shaped more like a coffin, or an Egyptian mummy-case, than\nany other object with which he was familiar, though rather larger than\neither.\n\nThat is, it was an oblong metal box, tapering toward the ends, with\nthe greatest width forward of the middle. Twin tubes projected from\nthe end of it, lenses in them glistening like eyes. Just below them\nsprang out steely, glistening tentacles several feet long, writhing\nand twitching as if they were alive. The tangle of green brush hid the\nthing's legs, so that Dan could not see them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly it sprang toward him, rising ten feet high and covering half\nthe distance between them. It alighted easily upon the two long,\njointed metal limbs upon which it had leapt, and continued to keep the\nlens-tubes turned toward Dan, so he knew that the grotesque metal\nthing was _watching him_.\n\nThe limbs, he observed, were similar to the hind legs of a\ngrasshopper, both in shape and position. And evidently the thing leapt\nupon them in about the same way. Then he noticed another curious thing\nabout it.\n\nThree little bars of metal projected above the thickest part of its\ncase, on the upper side. Their ends were joined by a little ring,\nthree inches across. The tiny metal ring glowed with purple\nluminosity. A purple haze seemed to cling about it, as to the huge\nring Dan had seen on the towers above the peak. And suspended inside\nthis ring was a tiny metal needle, shimmering with pulsating white\nfire.\n\nOn the back of this metal monster was a miniature replica of the\nstrange mechanism upon the pinnacle. The little needle pointed up the\ncanyon. A glance that way showed Dan that it pointed at the great\ndevice upon the mountain, which looked even more brilliant on this\ngloomy morning than in the uncertain radiance of the moon. The\ncolossal ring was shrouded in a splendid mantle of purple flame; and\nthe long, slender needle, which seemed to have swung on down to follow\nMars below the horizon, still throbbed with scintillating white fire.\n\nFor several minutes the two stood there, studying each other. A naked\nman, tense and bewildered in the presence of mysterious forces--and a\ngrotesque machine, cased in gleaming white metal, whose parts seemed\nto duplicate most of the functions of a living creature.\n\nThen one of the writhing tentacles that shot from the \"head\" of the\nmachine reached back under the metal case, and reappeared grasping\nwhat appeared to be a flat disk of emerald, two inches across and half\nan inch thick.\n\nThis green disk it held up, with a flat side toward Dan. There was no\nsound, but a flash of green light came from it, cutting a wide swath\ninto the jungle, and littering its path with smoking and flaming\ndebris.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut Dan, expecting something of the kind, had flung himself sidewise\ninto the shelter of the boulder beside which he had slept. Behind it,\nhe gathered his feet under him, picked up a rock of convenient size\nfor throwing, and waited, ready and alert.\n\nHe heard the soft humming sound on the other side of the boulder. A\nglittering object flashed above him. Crashing through the brush the\nmetal monster came to earth on the same side of the boulder with him.\n\nBut the metal thing had not turned in its flight: consequently its\nrear end was toward Dan. As it began cumberously to turn about, he\nhurled his rock with an accuracy that came of a boyhood on the farm.\nInstinct had made him try for the little ring and needle on the back\nof the monster, apparently its most vulnerable part.\n\nWhether by luck or skill, the rock struck the gleaming ring, crushing\nit against the needle--and instant paralysis overtook the metal thing.\nIts tentacles and limbs became fixed and rigid, and it toppled over in\nthe brush.\n\nDan walked over to it, and examined it briefly. The green disk had\nfallen on the ground, and he picked it up. It was made of emerald\ncrystal, it had a little knob of glistening metal set in one side.\nRather afraid of it, Dan forebore to twist the knob. But he still\nclutched it in his hand a few moments later, when, partly for fear\nthat others of its kind would come to succor the fallen monster, and\npartly to secure shelter from the threatening rain, he retired into\nthe shadows of the tangled jungle.\n\nHe spent perhaps half an hour in creeping back to what he supposed a\nplace of comparative safety. For some time he lay there in the cool\ngloom, brushing occasional insects off his bare skin, wishing by turns\nthat he had a cup of coffee and a good beefsteak, and that he could\npuzzle out a logical solution of all the astounding things he had met\nin the island. After the encounter with the metal monster, he felt his\ntheory of the hermit scientists a bit inadequate.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPresently his attention was attracted by the unmistakable mew of a\nkitten. Then he heard the padding sound of cautious human footsteps,\nand a clear feminine voice calling \"Kitty, kitty,\" in low tones. The\nsteps and the voice seemed coming toward him; since there was no sound\nof crackling brush, he supposed there was a trail which he had not\nfound.\n\n\"Hello,\" he ventured, when the voice seemed only a few yards away\nthrough the green tangle.\n\nAt the same instant a gray kitten appeared out of the underbrush, and\nfrisked trustfully across to him. He put out a hand, caressed it,\npicked it up. In a moment the feminine voice replied, \"Hello yourself.\nWho are you?\"\n\nA crackling sound came from the brush, as if the speaker were starting\ntoward him. Dan, abruptly conscious of his lack of attire, said\nquickly, \"Wait a minute! I haven't anything on, you see. I'm Dan\nMcNally. I owned the schooner that something happened to off the\nisland last night.\"\n\nA delicious, trilling laugh greeted the panic of his first words. Then\nthe clear, sweet voice, serious again, replied, \"So you swam ashore\nfrom the boat I signaled?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Gee, but I'm glad to find you! And you say you haven't any clothes? I\nwonder what....\" The voice paused reflectively, then resumed, \"Here's\na sheet that I got to signal with in the daytime, if I had a chance.\nYou might wrap it around you until we find something better.\"\n\nThe low, liquid laugh rang out again; again there was a rustling in\nthe brush, and presently an arm appeared, holding a rolled-up sheet.\n\n\"All right,\" he called. \"Throw it this way.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a moment, with the sheet draped around him like a Roman toga, and\nthe kitten on his arm, he advanced to meet the owner of the beautiful\nvoice.\n\nAt the trail he met a trim, active-looking young woman, clad in\nout-of-door attire and with a canvas knapsack on her back. Bareheaded,\nshe wore her brown hair closely shingled. Her face, Dan recognized\nfrom the photograph he had seen five years before, though it was more\nlovely than the splotched newspaper picture had hinted. Her brown eyes\nwere filled with laughter at his predicament and his present unusual\ngarb.\n\nHe bowed with mock gravity and said, \"How do you do, Miss Helen\nHunter?\"\n\nBrown eyes widened in surprise. \"You know me?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not half so well as I hope to,\" he grinned.\n\nThen, handing her the kitten, he spoke seriously. \"What about this\nisland? The green flashes? The big machine on the mountain? The metal\nthing that jumps about like a grasshopper? What's it all about? You\nknow anything about it?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know a good deal about it,\" she told him soberly. \"It's rather\na terrible story. And one you may not believe--no, you've seen them!\nBut the kitten is hungry, and you must be, too, if you swam ashore.\"\n\n\"Well, yes, I am.\" Dan admitted.\n\nThe storm clouds were drifting out to sea; the sun was beginning to\nassert itself, and it now lighted up the scene with a cheerful\nbrightness. She slung off her pack and sat down cross-legged at the\nside of the trail. Dan sat down opposite her as she opened the\nknapsack and produced a can of condensed milk, one of sardines, a\ncan-opener, and half a loaf of bread.\n\n\"I had to select my supplies rather at random,\" she said, \"and you'll\nhave to make the best of them.\"\n\nShe started to open the sardines. \"You'd better give it to me,\" Dan\nadvised. \"You might cut your hand.\"\n\n\"You think so?\" she asked, deftly lifting the lid, fishing out a fish\nfor the kitten, and presenting the can to Dan. Then with capable\nhands she broke off a large chunk of bread, which she handed him.\n\n\"Go ahead and finish this up,\" she said. \"I've already had breakfast.\"\nShe punched two holes in the end of the milk can, and poured some of\nthe thick yellow fluid into the palm of her left hand, from which she\nlet the kitten lap it.\n\n\"And now for the mystery of the island,\" Dan demanded, forgetting\nbread and sardines in his eagerness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl turned her face to him. \"I'm Helen Hunter, as you seem to\nknow,\" she began. \"I came here with my father five years ago to\nobserve an eclipse of the sun. When it was all over, and the ship\ncalled to take us off, he decided to send the results of our\nobservations by one of the other men. He wanted to stay here to carry\non another experiment--the one that led to that machine on the hill.\nPart of the other men were willing to stay. The yacht left us here,\nand has been back from San Francisco every six months since, with mail\nand supplies.\"\n\n\"And what was the experiment?\" Dan demanded eagerly.\n\n\"Have you ever looked at Mars through a good telescope?\" she\ncountered. \"Then you must have seen the canals--straight dark lines\nrunning from the white polar caps to the equatorial zone. All\nscientists did not agree as to what they were, but nobody could\nsuggest a natural origin for them.\n\n\"My father was one of those who thought that the canals were fertile,\ncultivated strips, irrigated with water brought down from the melting\nice-caps. Irrigation systems meant intelligent life upon the planet,\nand his experiment was an attempt to communicate with that\nintelligence.\"\n\n\"And he succeeded?\" Dan was astounded.\n\n\"Yes. The means was simple enough: other men had suggested it years\nbefore, in fact. Any fairly bright light on Mars--such as the beam of\na searchlight directed toward earth--would be visible in a good\ntelescope, when the planet is favorably situated: it follows that such\na light on earth should be visible to an observer with a similar\ninstrument on Mars.\n\n\"It was possible, of course, but unlikely, that Mars would have\nintelligent inhabitants still ignorant of the telescope. It was also\npossible that their senses would be different from ours--that, if they\nsaw at all, it would be with a different part of the spectrum. Father\ntook the chance. And he succeeded.\n\n\"The call was simple: merely three flashes of light, repeated again\nand again. We used a portable searchlight, mounted on a motor-truck,\nsuch as is used in the army. The three flashes meant that we were on\nthe third planet of the solar system. The answering call, from the\nfourth planet, should be four flashes, of course.\n\n\"For three nights we kept signaling. One of the men watched the\nmotor-generator, and I operated the searchlight, swinging it on Mars\nand off again, to make the flashes. Dad kept his eye screwed to the\ntelescope. Nothing happened and he got discouraged. I persuaded him to\nkeep on for another night, in case they hadn't seen us at first; or\nneeded more time to get their searchlight ready.\n\n\"And on the fourth night poor Dad came out of the observatory,\nshouting that he had seen four flashes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDan gasped, speechless with astonishment. \"Then that machine, with the\nneedle pointing at Mars, and the green flashes, and the thing that\njumped at me--\"\n\nHelen waved a white hand for silence. \"Just keep cool a minute! I'm\ncoming to them.\n\n\"The four flashes just began it. In a few days Dad and the Martians\nwere communicating by a sort of television process. He would mark off\na sheet of paper into squares, blacken some of the squares to make a\npicture or design, then have me send a flash for each black square,\nand miss an interval for each white one, taking them in regular order.\nThe Martians seemed to catch on pretty soon; in a few days Dad was\nreceiving pictures of the same sort.\n\n\"Rather a slow way of communication, perhaps. But it worked better\nthan one might think at first. In a month Dad had received\ninstructions for building a small machine like that big one on the\nhill. It is something like radio--at least it operates with vibrations\nin the ether--but it's as much ahead of our radio as an airplane is in\nadvance of a fire-balloon. I understand a good bit about it, but I\nwon't try to explain it now.\n\n\"And in the next three years Dad learned no end of things from the\npeople on Mars. One queer thing about it was, that they never let us\nsee them on the television apparatus, no matter how many of their\nscientific secrets they gave us. Dad and I exhibited ourselves, but I\ndon't know yet what the Martians look like--though I have made a\nguess.\n\n\"By the end of the third year they had showed Dad how to make one of\nthose metal things--\"\n\n\"Like that one that jumped at me?\" Dan broke in with a shudder.\n\n\"Yes. They seem almost alive; but they are machines, like our robots,\nand controlled by the radio apparatus. The eyes use photo-electric\ncells, and relay what is before them to the Master Intelligence.\" The\ngirl spoke these last words in a low tone, shrinking involuntarily.\nShe paused a moment, then shrugged and continued.\n\n\"The first machine did not obey my father. It was controlled by\nsignals that came from Mars, over the big station on the hill. And it\nwent to work, making more apparatus, building more machines, enlarging\nthe receiving station. It worked in obedience to the Master\nIntelligence on Mars!\n\n\"That was a year ago. The last time the yacht called, my father and\nthe other men still hoped to control the machines. They let her go\nback without us. The machines tolerated us a while; paid no attention\nto us; they were busy working mines and building huge, strange things\nthat must be flying machines; the plateau on the other side of the\npeak is crowded with them.\n\n\"For the machines are preparing to leave the island! They are going to\nconquer the world for the Master Intelligence on Mars!\n\n\"Months ago my father discovered this, and realized that he had loosed\ndoom upon the earth. He and the three other men planned to destroy\nthat big station on the peak. All the signals to the machines are\nrelayed through that, from Mars. The machines seemed to pay no heed as\nthey made their preparations.\n\n\"Then one night, about three weeks ago, they tried to dynamite the\nstation.\" The girl's shoulder trembled; she paused to brush a tear\nfrom her eye, then went on hastily, in a voice grown husky with\nemotion. Dan felt an odd desire to take her slight form in his arms\nand comfort her in her grief.\n\n\"The machines had seemed heedless, but they were ready. They had those\ndisks that throw the green fire: we had not seen them before.\nAnd--well, all four of them were killed.\"\n\nDan handed her the disk of green crystal he had taken from the thing\nthat had attacked him. She examined it silently, then went on.\n\n\"Dad had left me in bed, but I heard an explosion. I think the bombs\nwent off when the green fire struck them. I knew what had happened,\nand got out of the house just before the machines arrived. They\nwrecked the place with their green flashes.\n\n\"And for the last three weeks I've been hiding in the jungle, or\nwatching for ships. Three times I've raided the ruins of the house for\nsomething to eat: fortunately it didn't burn, like your ship. And\nthat's all, I suppose--except I'm awfully glad that you got ashore.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Dan said, earnestly. \"And what are we going to do now?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I don't know,\" Helen answered in a troubled tone. \"I'm afraid. Afraid\nfor all humanity. On the television, I've seen enough of Mars to be\nsure that it is a world of machines, controlled by one Master\nIntelligence. And even that may be a machine. We make machines that\ncompute the tides and carry out other computations that are almost\nbeyond the power of the human mind: why couldn't a machine think?\n\n\"The Master Intelligence of Mars plans to add the Earth to his domain.\nUnless we can do something to stop it, in a few years the world will\nbe overrun with gigantic robot-machines, controlled by force from\nacross the gulf of space. Humanity cannot resist them. Imagine a\nbattleship pitted against that green annihilating ray, and all the\nother science of an elder planet!\n\n\"Life is to be blotted out! The Master Intelligence of Mars will rule\ntwo worlds of mechanical monsters!\"\n\nDan sat in a dazed vision of horror to come, until Helen straightened\nup as if shaking off a mantle of fear, and smiled heroically, if a bit\nwanly.\n\n\"Now you must eat your bread and sardines, to give you strength to\nfight for humanity!\" she cried, with a laugh that she strived, not too\nsuccessfully, to make cheerful and gay.\n\nObediently, he began to eat, finding an excellent appetite....\n\nIt was several minutes later that he fancied he heard a whirring and\ncrackling in the brush behind them. He sprang to his feet in alarm.\n\n\"It can't be far back to where I left the machine,\" he cried. \"Do you\nsuppose there's danger that--\"\n\nThe mechanical ears of the metal things may have picked up the sound\nof his voice: but in any event, green flame flashed about them on the\ninstant. Feeling a sudden protective impulse, Dan started toward\nHelen. That was his last recollection, before what seemed a terrific\nconcussion swept him into the abyss of unconsciousness....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis first thought, when he awakened, was of the girl. But he was alone\nin the silence of the canyon. He sat up, realizing that many hours had\npassed, for the air was growing cool again, and the sun was low behind\nthe peak at the head of the ravine. The huge, mysterious machine of\nthe purple ring and the vibrating white needle were blazing\nsplendidly.\n\nHe took more detailed stock of his immediate surroundings. The tangle\nof brush that had sheltered them had been cut away by the green\nannihilating ray. Charred stumps remained to show where it had fired\nbushes beyond the trail. His own shoulder was blistered, a hole was\nburned in the sheet wound about him, and the hair was singed from the\nback of his head.\n\nSuddenly trembling with horror, he looked about for anything to show\nthat Helen had perished by the ray. Discovering nothing, he breathed a\nsigh of relief.\n\n\"She must be still alive, anyhow,\" he muttered. \"And I've had another\nlucky break! The ray was too high to get me. They must have left me\nfor dead.\"\n\nPresently he became conscious of torturing thirst. He retired through\nthe brush, along the rocky wall of the canyon. By sunset he came upon\na little natural basin in a rock, half full of rain water. It was none\ntoo clean, but he drank his fill of it, and felt relief.\n\nLooking up the canyon, he could see the great mechanism on the peak,\ngleaming in the dusk. Intensely-glowing purple mist clung about the\ngreat metal ring, and the slender, delicate needle swung below it,\nstill vibrating, still throbbing with brilliant, white radiance. It\npointed at the red eye of Mars, which had just winked into view.\n\nDan stared at it a long time.\n\n\"It all sounds crazy,\" he muttered, \"but it isn't! The Master\nIntelligence of Mars, she said, is controlling the mechanical things\nthrough that! The doom of the Earth is coming through that white\nneedle! If only I could smash it, somehow!\"\n\nHe looked down at the white folds of the sheet that draped him, and\nclenched his hands impotently. \"No gun! Not even a pocket-knife.\nNothing but my bare hands!\" He bit his lip.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStill he stared challengingly at the gleaming mechanism on the peak.\nAn idea slowly took form in his mind; an exclamation abruptly escaped\nhim. Narrowly he eyed the trussed girders of the silver towers which\nsupported the great ring, muttering to himself.\n\n\"Yes, I can do it! If I don't get caught! I can climb it, well enough.\nThe needle looks a bit frail. I should be able to smash it! I'd like\nto see Helen again, though.\"\n\nHe gathered the sheet around him, and began picking a cautious way up\nthe canyon, staying always in the cover of boulders or brush. A few\ntimes he disturbed a rock, or snapped a twig beneath his foot. Then he\nwaited out of sight for long minutes, though he had no reason to\nbelieve that the metal monsters were on the alert for him.\n\n\"I've got to do it! The world depends on it!\" he kept saying again and\nagain in his mind.\n\nThe quick darkness of the tropics had fallen almost before he started.\nBut he welcomed the night, for, if it made his own silent progress\nmore difficult, it reduced the hazard that he would be discovered.\n\nGauging the time by the slow wheeling of the diamond-like stars across\nthe velvet sky, he thought that two hours had passed when he reached\nthe head of the canyon. He stood up cautiously to survey the little\nplateau at the summit of the hill.\n\nIt was several acres in extent, quite level, and almost clear of\nvegetation. At the farther side was a pile of wreckage, which, he\nsupposed, had been the quarters of Dr. Hunter's party, before they had\nbeen destroyed.\n\nMany huge machines stood about the plateau, vast, dark masses looming\nin the starlight. Mostly they were either not running or very silent\nin operation; but a very deep, vibrant humming sound came from one\nnear him. Smaller shapes were moving about them, with long easy leaps.\nThese, he knew, were the mechanical monsters, though it was too dark\nto distinguish them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut by far the most prominent object upon the plateau was the enormous\ngleaming thing that Helen had said was the station over which came the\nsignals from the Master Intelligence on Mars. One of its three towers\nsprang up not far from where he stood. The huge, refulgent ring,\nswathed in its mist of purple fire, was a full hundred feet above him;\nand the slender needle, pulsing with white flame, swinging within and\nbelow the colossal ring, was itself a hundred feet in length.\n\nThe white needle, for all its length, seemed hardly thicker than a\nman's finger. It was mounted at the top of a curiously complex and\ndelicate-looking device that spread broadly out between the three\ntowers, below the center of the huge purple ring.\n\nDan looked at it and decided that his plan had at least a chance of\nsuccess--though he had no hope that it would not be fatal to him.\n\nQuickly and silently he ran to the base of the mighty silver towers\nnearest him and began to climb the side toward the ravine, where the\nmaze of girders would hide him, at least partially, from any watchers\nback on the plateau. The starlight and the faint weird radiance of the\npurple ring above sufficed to guide him.\n\nThe cross-braces on the girder he had chosen were spaced closely\nenough to serve as the rungs of a ladder. Dan climbed easily, pausing\ntwice for breath, and to look down at the dark plateau. The vast,\nhumming machines loomed up strangely in the pale purple light that\nfell from the gleaming ring.\n\nOnce he looked across toward the other side of the island. The surface\nthere was more level. He glimpsed tiny moving lights, and huge\nstationary masses, apparently as large as ocean liners. He had an\nimpression of a vast amount of mechanical activity, proceeding in the\ndarkness very rapidly, and in a silent and orderly fashion.\n\n\"The expeditionary force of the Master Intelligence of Mars,\" he\nthought, \"preparing to set out against humanity! And what I can do is\nthe only chance to stop it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe climbed again with renewed energy. A few yards more brought him to\nthe colossal metal ring. Resting upon the three towers, it was a\ncircular band of shining metal a foot thick and as wide as a road. The\nintense purple glow extended several feet from its surface.\n\nDan touched it tentatively. He felt a tingling electric shock. And he\nthought he could feel a radiation coming from it, giving him a curious\nsensation of cold. As he reached his hands up and grasped the upper\nedge of the great ring, he felt what seemed a physical current of\ncold.\n\nControlling his tendency to shiver, he climbed upon the last brace,\nand, lifting his weight with his hands, threw himself face down upon\nthe flat upper surface of the vast ring. He lay bathed in cold purple\nfire. He tingled with the chill of it. A frozen current seemed to\npenetrate his body. Involuntarily he trembled, lost his grip and\ndangled precariously from the rim.\n\nOnly a frantic scrambling restored his hold. Then, fighting the\nsensation of freezing cold that came from the mist of purple flame, he\ndrew himself forward and got to his feet upon the broad surface of the\nmetal ring. On both sides it curved away like a circular track.\nRed-violet fire shimmered about it, bathing him to the waist in a\nchilling torrent.\n\nThrough coruscating frozen flame he waded to the inner rim of the\ncolossal ring. Below him hung the needle, a mere straight line of\nwhite fire, a hundred feet in length. Eye-dazzling radiance\nscintillated along it, waxing and waning with a curious throbbing\nrhythm. The needle vibrated a little, but it pointed directly at the\nred point of Mars, now almost directly overhead.\n\nRepressing a shudder, Dan looked down at the complex and delicate\napparatus upon which the slender needle was mounted. It was a light\nframe of white metal bars, with spidery coils and huge glowing tubes\nand flimsy spinning disks mounted in it. The gleaming needle was\nmounted much like a telescope at the top of the device, fully fifty\nfeet below him.\n\n\"Looks flimsy enough,\" Dan muttered. \"I'll go through it like a\nsixteen-inch shell! Who would have thought I'd end this way!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stepped back for a moment, and stood on the polished metal, hidden\nto the waist in cold purple flame. Lest it impede his movements, he\ntore the sheet from him and threw it aside. He let his eyes sweep for\na last time over the familiar constellations blazing so splendidly in\nthe black sky above. He had a pang of heartache, as if the stars were\nold friends. His glance roved fondly over the dark, indistinct masses\nof the island, and across the black plain of the sea.\n\n\"Well, no good in waiting,\" he muttered again. \"Sorry I can't see\nHelen. Hope she gets off all right.\"\n\nHe backed to the outer rim and drew a deep breath, like one about to\ndive. Then, with set face, he sprinted forward. As he did so a\nblinding flash of green light flickered up before him. He ducked his\nhead and leapt from the inner edge of the vast glowing ring.\n\nFor long seconds, it seemed, he was plunging down through space, feet\nfirst. Air rushed screaming about his ears. But his mind was quite\ncalm, and registered an astonishingly large series of impressions.\n\nHe saw the delicate, gleaming machine rushing up to meet him, the\nshimmering white needle swung on its top.\n\nHe took in the silent, dark plateau, with the masses of the great\nmachines rising like ominous shadows here and there, and the\nmechanical monsters leaping busily about it, almost invisible in the\ndim, ghostly radiance that fell from the purple ring.\n\nHe saw a vivid flame of green reach up past him from somewhere below.\nHe knew, without emotion or alarm, that he had been discovered, and\nthat it was too late for his discoverers to stop him.\n\nHe found time, even, for a fleeting thought of death. His mind framed\nthe question, \"What will I be in a moment from now?\"\n\nThen he had struck the great white needle, and was crashing into the\ndelicate apparatus below it. Waves of pain beat upon his mind like\nflashes of blinding light. But his last mental image, as he passed\ninto oblivion, was a picture of Helen's face. Oddly, it was not her\nface as he had last seen it, but a reproduction of the old newspaper\nhalf-tone, curiously retouched with life and color.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere is little more to tell. It was some weeks later when Dan came\nback out of a world of delirium and dreams, to find himself lying on\nhis back in a tent, very much bandaged. He was alone at the moment,\nand at first could not recall that tremendous last day of his\nconscious life.\n\nThen he heard a thrillingly familiar feminine voice calling \"Kitty,\nkitty, kitty.\" He tried to move, a dull pain throbbed in his breast,\nand a groan escaped him. In a moment Helen appeared; the gray kitten\nwas forgotten. She looked very anxious and solicitous--and also, Dan\nthought, very beautiful.\n\n\"No, no!\" she cried. \"You are going to be all right! Dad made me learn\na little elementary medicine before we came here, and I know. But you\nmustn't speak! Not for days yet! I'll have to guess what you want. And\nyou can wink when I guess the right thing.\n\n\"Gee, but I'm glad you've come to! You'll be as well as ever, pretty\nsoon. The kitten was lots of comfort. Still--\"\n\nDan attempted to move. She leaned over him, shifted his weight and\nsmoothed the sheet with strong, capable hinds. \"You want to know about\nwhat happened to the machine monsters?\"\n\nHe winked.\n\n\"Well, you remember when they found us, and shot the green ray at us.\nThey left you there--I thought you were dead--and carried me up here\non the hill. Perhaps they wanted me for a laboratory subject to test\nthe green ray on, or something of the kind. Anyhow, they carried me\ninto a big shed filled with strange machines.\n\n\"They kept me there until that night. Then, all of a sudden, they\nall--stopped! They froze! They were dead!\n\n\"The tentacles of the one that was holding me were set about me. But I\nworked free, and got out of the shed. It took all night. And when I\ncame out, just at sunrise, I saw that the purple fire was gone from\nthe great ring. The needle was knocked down, and the apparatus\nsmashed.\n\n\"I found you there in the wreckage. You made a human bullet of\nyourself to smash it! The greatest thing a man ever did!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThough normally rather modest, Dan felt a glow of pride at the honest\nadmiration ringing in her clear voice, and shining from her warm brown\neyes.\n\n\"So I gathered up what was left of you,\" she went on, \"and tried to\nput you back together again. A good many bones were broken, and you\nhad more cuts and bruises than I could mention; but the apparatus had\nbroken the force of the fall, and you were still alive. You are\nremarkably well put together, I should say; and unusually lucky, as\nwell!\n\n\"And, well, the machines and apparatus are scattered about all over\nthe island. Every one of them stopped the instant you smashed the\nconnection with the directing intelligence on Mars. There'll be quite\na stir in the scientific world, I imagine, in about three weeks, when\nthe yacht comes and carries us back with a lot of plans and specimens.\nWe must send about a thousand engineers back here to study what we\nleave behind us.\n\n\"And do you want anything else?\" She bent over and watched his\nbandaged face. Looking up into her bright eyes, thrilling to the cool,\ncomforting pressure of her hand on his forehead, Dan reflected. Then\nhe winked.\n\n\"Something you want me to do?\"\n\nHe winked.\n\n\"When? Right now?\"\n\nNo response.\n\n\"After the yacht comes.\"\n\nHe winked.\n\n\"What is it?\" She looked him in the eye, blushed a little, and\nlaughed.\n\n\"You mean--\"\n\nDan winked.\n\n\n[Illustration: Advertisement.]\n\n\n\n\nThe Hands of Aten\n\nA COMPLETE NOVELETTE\n\n_By H. G. Winter_\n\n[Illustration: The sharp roar of an explosion thundered through the\nTemple.]\n\n[Sidenote: Out of solid ice Craig hews three long-frozen\nEgyptians--and is at once caught up into amazing adventure.]\n\n\nThe sleek black monoplane came scudding out of the south, flying low\nover fields of ice and snow that were thawing slowly under the heat of\nthe arctic sun. After a long time it wheeled, circled gradually, and\nthen, as if it had found what it had been looking for, came lightly\ndown and skidded to a graceful halt in a low flat area between some\nround-topped hillocks. A fur-clad figure emerged from the enclosed\ncockpit and climbed a low ridge into the wan sunlight above.\n\nFor a while the man looked around, getting his bearings. Miles on\nevery side stretched the great rough plains of ice--ice that became a\nbroad path of glittering diamonds where it led toward the low-hung\nsun, far in the south. Perhaps a quarter mile in that direction lay\nthe white rise of a hill much larger than its fellows, probably, the\nman thought, a volcano. Towards it he laboriously made his way. His\ntiny figure was only a speck on the far-flung, deserted landscape--a\nhuman mite, puny and futile against the giant, hostile white waste.\n\nThe sky was clear and cloudless, the sun unusually warm. So warm,\nindeed, that long clefts, caused by the unequal expansion of the ice,\nappeared here and there. The man from the plane had not gone more than\nfifty yards when he halted sharply. With a crack like thunder, a\ncleft had opened at his very feet--a rift ten feet deep in places,\napparently bottomless in others, and very long. Not wanting to go\naround it, he slid down one side and, with an ice pick, started to\nhack a foothold in the opposite bank.\n\nIt was then that the man saw the thing--something sticking from the\nice just above his head. As he stared at it, amazement appeared on his\nbronzed face. He looked around bewilderedly, then peered still more\nclosely into the bluish depths of the crystal wall.\n\nThe head of a spear was jutting from the ice. And the spear was held\nby a man entrapped within the wall.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe details of the ice-held figure were but slightly blurred, for it\nwas only a few feet from the surface. It was that of a man, and it was\nplain that he was not an Eskimo. He was locked in a distorted\nposition, as if caught unawares by a terrific weight of sliding snow.\nAnd he had been caught, seemingly, when in the act of hurling his\nweapon.\n\nFor a long time the man from the plane peered at his discovery. Then\nhis blue eyes followed slowly the direction in which the spear was\npointing, and he gasped, and took a few quick steps further down the\ncleft. There, in the opposite wall, were two more bodies.\n\nThese, though, were of man and woman. They were even closer to the\nsurface of the ice. Crouched over, the man's left hand was craned as\nif to protect his companion from some peril--from the cataclysm that\nhad trapped them, it might have been. Or perhaps from the spear of the\nother.\n\nThe fur-muffled figure stood motionless, gazing at them. His ice pick\nwas held limply, his eyes were wide. Then, suddenly, the pick was\ngrasped firmly, and flakes of ice flew under its level blows as he\nstarted to carve his find from their frozen tomb.\n\nThe man was trembling with wild excitement when at last the stiff form\nof the woman was extricated. She was not so much a woman as a girl,\nreally--and she was beautiful. But the man from the plane evidently\ndidn't care so much about that; nor even her almost miraculous state\nof preservation. He rubbed away some of the coating of ice from her\nface, and stared most intently at her forehead. Then he stood upright,\nand said, simply:\n\n\"Well, I'll be damned!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIf Wesley Craig had been merely what he was listed as on the roster of\nthe Somers Arctic Expedition of 1933--that is, a geologist--he would\nnot have been so astounded. But his life work, really, was\narchaeology. He had spent years delving in the ruins of ancient\ntemples, especially, those of old Egypt. He knew the ancient language\nas well as anyone knew it, and was familiar with every known detail of\nthe civilization of the Pharaohs. And, being so, he was now properly\nconfused. For every bit of his knowledge told him that this girl, whom\nhe had found in the wastes of the arctic, was of Egyptian stock.\n\nA certain tiny hieroglyph traced on her smooth forehead--the intricate\nband around her fine hair--the very cut of the frozen robe she\nwore--Egyptian--every one of them!\n\nYet, stubbornly, Wesley Craig wouldn't admit it. Not until he had cut\nthe two men from the ice and hauled all three laboriously up the side\nof the cleft and stretched them out on the level ice, did he have to.\nHe couldn't deny it, then. In some mysterious way, Egypt was connected\nwith the three rigid bodies.\n\nFor the two men were garbed as warriors, and their helmets and harness\nand sword-sheaths were indisputably of Egyptian design.\n\nThere, however, the similarity between the two ended. The one with the\nspear was big-muscled and burly; the other much slighter of build.\nThis latter, Craig guessed, had been fleeing with the girl when icy\ndeath had overwhelmed them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut he did not then try to go into that, the story that some sudden\ncataclysm had cut short. His fervor, as an Egyptologist, was afire. He\nwas burning with eagerness to get these bodies back to the main base\nof the Somers Expedition, some three hundred miles south. Into the\nlearned circles of Egyptology, of archaeology, they'd throw a\nbomb-shell that would make nitroglycerine seem like weak tea.\n\nCraig couldn't taxi his plane closer; he would have to carry them to\nit; and to do this he began to carefully massage all the larger pieces\nof ice from the girl's limbs and clothing, to make her lighter. At the\nSomers base they could all be re-frozen, to maintain their perfect\npreservation.\n\nIt was while he was diligently rubbing that he fully realized the\ngirl's beauty. Delicate, cleanly cut features; fine, large eyelids;\ntiny, slender hands. Save for her icy pallor, she might almost have\nbeen merely asleep as she lay on the snow.\n\nWes Craig finished massaging the girl and then went on and did the\nsame for the two warriors. For an hour he carefully and reverently\nreleased them from the reluctant fingers of their icy death, and he\nwas a little tired from his exertions and his great excitement when at\nlast he finished and stood erect, resting. But he did not stand quiet\nfor long. A sudden gleam lit his eyes: a mad idea had come to him.\n\n\"Won't hurt to try!\" he muttered excitedly, and the next moment his\nlithe figure was running over the slippery ice bank to his airplane,\nout of sight behind the nearby hillocks.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWes Craig worked from a sub-base on his sole expeditions to chart the\nvarious mountains and ranges in the islands off north-east King\nCharles Land, within the Arctic Circle. He had only one partner, a\nmechanic, who stayed behind on his shorter trips. And therefore all\nmanner of emergency devices were stowed in the cockpit of his plane: a\ntiny folding tent, an amazingly light sled, a large store of\ncompressed food--and a large vial of Kundrenaline and a hypodermic\nneedle.\n\nKundrenaline was still somewhat of an unknown quantity in 1933. Kund,\nthe German, had developed it but a year before. The fluid was already\nstandard beside the operating tables of the world's most modern\nhospitals, so valuable had its qualities proven to be. It had actually\nrestored life after hours of death. A complex mixture of concentrated\nadrenaline and highly compressed liquid food, it gave a tremendous\nstimulation to the heart, at the same time providing the body with\nenergy food to withstand the shock.\n\nIt was meant for emergency use on the Somers Expedition. But Wes Craig\nwasn't going to use it for that. He was going to use it for an\nexperiment--a crazy experiment, he told himself. Fish--many forms of\nlife--withstand freezing in solid ice without hurt. Human beings--? It\nwouldn't hurt to try, anyway, his mind kept repeating.\n\nFifteen minutes saw him back beside the rigid bodies, and kneeling\nover the girl. The sun had warmed her body somewhat, and the\nglistening rheum of frost had melted from all three. Hardly breathing\nfrom his suspense, Wes filled the needle's chamber full and plunged it\ninto the firm white flesh just above the girl's silent heart.\n\nA short laugh came from him--an ironic laugh. It seemed idiotic to\neven think of restoring her to life, even if she _had_ been dead only\na week or so. It was quite--\n\nAnd then his thoughts stopped.\n\n\"My God!\" he said suddenly.\n\nFor a tide of faintest color had surged through the girl's wan cheeks.\nAnd her slim figure had stirred perceptibly on the sheet of ice!\n\n\"By heaven, she's coming to!\" Craig muttered unbelievingly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPressing his ear to her chest, he detected a faint and labored beating\nof her heart, stirring from its cold sleep as the terrific stimulation\njolted it back to life. The girl's eyelids flickered; a tiny sigh\nescaped her full lips. Craig took off his heavy parka and laid it over\nher. Trembling with tremendous excitement, he tore himself away from\nthe miracle of re-created life, and strode to the body of the young\nman who was apparently her partner.\n\nAgain he administered the Kundrenaline. Then he went to his first\ndiscovery--the heavily built, powerful warrior whose spear had stuck\nout of the ice. The hypodermic was once more filled, and the fluid\nplunged into his body. Even as a faint moan came from the younger man,\nthe warrior's heart started to beat.\n\nPerspiring, breathing quickly, vial and needle still in his hands, Wes\nstood off and surveyed the three.\n\nThe girl's hands were moving fitfully; strange, racking gasps came\nfrom her throat. The other two were similarly affected. Almost\nfrightened, held motionless by the weirdness of it, the American\nwatched.\n\nThe heavily built warrior was tossing in a series of convulsions. His\nlegs kicked out spasmodically, arms jerked and clenched, and the\nhelmeted head rolled from side to side. Then the man lay still for as\nlong as a minute; but, just as Craig was about to go to him, his legs\ntensed once again, and, staggering drunkenly, he got to his feet.\n\nHe looked around wildly, but did not see the dumbfounded Craig, for\nhis eyes fell on the figure of the younger man. He too had risen,\nswaying on weak legs. And the girl was sitting up and staring at the\ntwo of them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then, grotesquely, preluded by a cry from the woman, the tragedy\nwhich death had once cut short was enacted out, there on the rough\nsheet of ice and snow.\n\nThe man with the spear fixed his eyes on the girl's young partner,\nraised his weapon, leveled it unsteadily, and tossed it weakly\nforward. The pointed end clipped its target and sent him reeling, with\na thin trickle of slow blood running from his right shoulder. The girl\nstaggered to her feet and ran between the two. But the big warrior's\nhand swept her aside, and a short sword leaped from its sheath at his\nwaist.\n\nWes was stupidly staring, unable to move. The combatants were utterly\nunconscious of him. The younger one, painfully wounded, drew his own\nsword and swayed forward to meet his enemy.\n\nThe fight was grotesque. Both were weak, unsteady. The short swords\nstabbed slowly, missing by yards in their drunken course. Hatred was\non the big man's dark face, and a fierce lust for blood. It was only\nwhen the weapons clashed loudly together that Craig came out of his\ndaze.\n\n\"Stop!\" he yelled, jumping forward. \"Wait! Stop!\"\n\nAll three turned and looked full at him. And then death, which had\nbeen banished for but a few minutes, swooped swiftly once more on the\nyoung man. While he stood peering, bewildered, at Craig, the huge\nwarrior steadied his blade and drove it home through his unguarded\nchest. The man slid over the edge of the ice into the cleft below.\n\nThe girl shrieked again and went down to his fallen figure, while the\nvictor waved his bloody sword aloft with a shout of triumph. Then,\nwithout hesitation, he leaped at the American.\n\nWes was taken wholly by surprise. He dropped the vial of Kundrenaline\nand the hypodermic, and he heard them crash and break at his feet as\nhe fumbled for his automatic, in a holster at his belt. But the\nwarrior was upon him. His crimsoned blade swung high, gleamed\ndownward, and smote Wesley Craig square on the side of the head.\n\nLucky for him, the flat of the sword had been used--but it was enough.\nThe American reeled under the terrific swipe. He had a last glimpse of\ntwo inflamed eyes, of a savage, contorted face; then the universal\nwhiteness went black, and he fell, and the whole incredible scene\npassed from his consciousness....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust how long he had remained unconscious, Wesley Craig had no means\nof determining. His head was hurting devilishly; for a moment he\nthought that his plane had crashed, and that he was lying in the\nwreckage. Then he tried to move his hands, and found that he couldn't.\nThey were bound. His eyes opened.\n\nHe discovered that he was lying flat on the ice, hands tied behind his\nback. Somebody was moaning softly. It was the girl. She too was tied.\nWes tried to sit up; and a hand grasped his shoulder tightly and\nyanked him to his feet.\n\nThe big warrior who had felled him, his bloody sword still in hand,\nstared closely at the American, and fingered his fur jacket curiously.\nPresently he muttered a few words in some strange tongue. When Craig\ndid not reply, he again spat out the words, his dark brows bunching\nmalevolently. And this time Wes understood part of what he said.\n\nHe was speaking ancient Egyptian!\n\nThat proved it. These three, who but half an hour before were dead and\nentombed in the ice, _were_ Egyptians. Trying to cope with his\nreturning bewilderment, Craig racked his brains for remnants of the\ndifficult language. And finally said laboriously:\n\n\"Who--who art thou?\"\n\nA torrent of words broke from the warrior. Only a few were\nunderstandable.\n\n\"Shabako--Pharaoh Shabako!\" And he repeated Craig's question: \"Who art\nthou?\"\n\nThe girl was sitting up now, and peering at the American. Her eyes\nwere still tear-filled, for the dead body of the young man was at her\nside. She cried out a warning, and Craig caught most of it.\n\n\"Be careful, Stranger! He will slay thee as he slew Inaros!\"\n\n\"Answer me! Who art thou?\" repeated the warrior angrily. His patience\nwas short; he played with the hilt of his sword.\n\n\"I come,\" said Wesley Craig slowly, groping for words, \"from a far\ncountry. I found the three of you in this ice--dead. I brought thee\nback to life.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was an astounded silence. Then the man who called himself\nShabako deliberately cuffed his prisoner on the cheek. \"Blasphemer!\"\nhe roared. \"To claim the powers of the gods! Thou shall die for that!\nYea, the ice entrapped me when I was about to slay the guilty\nInaros--but our mighty god Aten restored me to life! Enough! The\npriests shall deal with thee!\"\n\nHe jerked the trembling girl to Craig's side, and with a prick of his\nsword in their backs made them go forward. The American was too\nbewildered to think evenly. Why, the god Aten was the Sun God!--the\ndivinity Egypt worshipped in five hundred B.C.? How had these\nwarm-blooded people come to the far north? Where did they live? And\nwhat fate lay in store for him?\n\nHe felt none too optimistic about his position. He knew that it would\nbe two weeks before Somers, at the main base, would become alarmed at\nhis absence. Unless, of course, the mechanic at the sub-base tried to\nbeat his way back on foot, which was only barely possible.... Then he\ndiscovered that his automatic was still in its holster; it was\nslapping against his thighs; and he felt more hopeful.\n\nThe girl trudged tiredly at his side. Shabako was a few feet behind,\ngrumbling and urging his captives along.\n\n\"Where does he drive us?\" Craig asked softly. \"What is thy name--and\nwhy did he slay thy companion?\"\n\nHer frightened eyes slanted towards his face. \"To the Temple of the\nSun God, Stranger,\" she whispered. \"And there--\" She broke off, to get\ncontrol of the emotion she was feeling.\n\n\"There--what?\"\n\n\"The God's awful hands!... Taia is my name. I do not know how I am\nonce again alive, when a short while ago I was dead--but it matters\nnot. I am a priestess of Aten, a virgin of the Temple. Inaros, he--he\nwho lies behind--dared to love me. But a few hours gone he committed\nsacrilege, hiding in the Temple, so he could watch me. Pharaoh Shabako\nchanced on him, threatened death to us and pursued us out here. And\nthen of a sudden, when Shabako was hurling his spear, we were\nentrapped ... and died....\"\n\nIt was a strange story of forbidden love, one that might have been\nenacted in age-old times beneath the shadows of the pyramids. Craig\nbegan, \"How did--\" but a harsh voice cut his question short.\n\n\"Silence, infidel! Stir thy feet! This ice cools my blood!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe American's plane, hidden from view behind the hillock, was left\nfarther and farther in the rear, and Wes was surprised to find that he\nwas being driven up the very slopes of the ice-covered hill he had\ncome to investigate.\n\nAt the top, he saw that the hill was a volcano, as he had guessed.\nThere, in the center, was a wide gaping hole from which, in past ages,\nfiery streams of lava and ashes had belched forth. He was amazed to\nsee that rude steps had been hacked in one side of the great cleft,\nand that they led sharply downwards. A faint warmth reached him, and\nhe observed that there was but little ice in the crater cup, and none\non the rocky walls where the hewn steps led down. It was here that\nthese warm-blooded people lived!\n\nAs soon as Taia reached the steps she began to descend them, but Craig\nwasn't so docile. He told himself that this was his last chance; once\nbelow, surrounded by numbers, there might be no opportunity to strike\nfor freedom. His eyes narrowed as he groped for a plan. If he could\nbutt his brawny captor, strike him fairly in the solar plexus, and,\nwhile he lay helpless, cut his bonds with the sword....\n\nHe whirled around. Reverting to football tactics, he tensed his lean,\nhard body and plunged squarely at Shabako.\n\nThe Pharaoh was taken completely by surprise, and went sprawling; but\nthe sword did not pitch from his hand. He had received a stiff, shrewd\nblow, but only a glancing one, for he had twisted his body at the last\nsecond. Now, sputtering with wrath, he scrambled to his feet and\nwhipped back his blade for a killing slice at the American.\n\nIt was Taia who saved him, then. In a flash she threw herself against\nthe sword arm and deflected the sweep.\n\n\"Wait, O Pharaoh!\" she cried breathlessly. \"The priests will claim\nthis stranger; 'tis they who must decide his fate! Do not kill him\nhere!\"\n\nShabako's face was livid with wrath; rage choked him; but he paused.\nThe girl's aptly timed words had told. He was obviously not decided as\nto what to do. There was a pause, while the sword pointed straight at\nCraig's chest; then, grumbling, the Egyptian let down his weapon.\n\n\"But try no more of thy tricks, dog!\" he said harshly. \"Else thy death\ncome before its time!\"\n\nTaia glanced appealingly at Wes. Her eyes were half-frightened. Craig\nsmiled wryly. \"Lead on!\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nYears of time fell away with each of their descending steps. Egypt\nstirred under the dust of the centuries; Egypt lived again, though in\na sad mockery of her former glory. It was like a descent into a new\nworld, yet a world that was, at the same time, as old as man's\ncivilization....\n\nFifty or more steps they trudged down, then came suddenly to two dark\ncorridors, both of which slanted steeply into the bowels of the earth.\nThe one they took was mystic with deep shadows thrown by flaring oil\nlamps, cunningly imbedded in the walls of rock; and immediately into\nWes's mind came the memory of a corridor he had once walked through in\nold Egypt, a corridor that pierced to the heart of a pyramid and the\nsomber vault of a mummy who had once been revered as the Pharaoh\nAknahton. In his nostrils now there seemed to be that same, musty,\nage-old smell; the same hushed gloom was about him; his eyes saw dimly\non the walls the same rows of hieroglyphs telling of long-past deeds\nof warriors and priests.\n\nBut there the similarity ended. In Egypt it had been a dead Pharaoh;\nhere, though even yet he could hardly believe it, a living\none--living by grace of modern science--walked warily behind him, and\na living virgin of the temple at his side. The sword of the Pharaoh\nwas pricking his back.\n\nThe passageway they trudged down became one of many. Others angled\nfrom it frequently, all dark, all hushed, all seemingly devoid of\npeople. The volcano--extinct, almost surely, for the warmth was only\nthat of the earth--was honey-combed with corridors. The marvelous\ningenuity of the Egyptian race had come into play in fashioning this\nwarm home in the barren arctic wastes. But Craig's ever-alert eyes\nwarned him of what was to come. The characters, the hieroglyphs, the\nrude forms of Egyptian gods on the jagged walls were of degenerate\ncharacter--and always, when degeneration sets in, the cruellest form\nof worship has been chosen. The worship of Aten, the Sun God, Wes\nrecalled, was one that demanded human sacrifice....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStill they went down. Savage crevices, split in the days when the\nvolcano roared with fire and gushing lava, were skirted; crude\nladders reached down ever-recurring pits, beneath which there was\nalways another corridor, and always leading down. Craig could not\nreckon the depth they must be at; he knew that the heat was growing,\nthough, and that his skin was wet with perspiration beneath his furs.\nHe started to ask Taia the question that ceaselessly tormented\nhim--how her race had come to the arctic; but a prick from Shabako's\nsword silenced him.\n\nThen the passageway they were in widened. There was a bend just ahead.\nThrough the gloom came the sonorous chant of many voices.\n\n\"The Temple!\" whispered Taia.\n\nThey turned the bend, and saw, ahead, lit by a thick cluster of oil\nlamps which threw a broad swathe of yellowish light, two tall columns\nof corrupt Egyptian design. They framed the entrance to the Sun God's\nTemple. The full volume of a chant of worship from inside poured\nthrough them.\n\nShabako's sword brooked no pause. He drove his prisoners straight\nthrough.\n\nA host of impressions thronged Wes's bewildered eyes: a huge,\nmisty-dark room, columns lining it--the vague form of a great idol\nsquatting at the far end, massed people bowed before it--a weird chant\nrising into murmuring echoes along the high, dim ceiling. There were\npriests standing rigidly in front of the idol, their hands stretched\nhigh; and every eye was upon them. None saw the three in the doorway\nuntil a roar split the drone of worship.\n\n\"Way! Way for thy Pharaoh, Shabako the Fourth!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShabako had stepped for the moment in front of his prisoners. His\nsword blade was waved aloft; his bawl rudely interrupted the ceremony.\nThe chant stopped, and silence fell as the priests whirled around. The\nworshippers, too, turned and stared at the man who had broken the\nservice with his imperious command.\n\n\"Way!\" the vibrant voice cried again. \"Aside for thy Pharaoh, who\nreturns to the shrine of Aten, Father of Life!\"\n\nSome sixty bewildered faces peered at the man. The silence of the\nburied Temple was solid, awesome. Through the mist of wreathing\nincense-smoke and heavy shadows the giant head of the idol stared\ndown, cruel in the coldness of the rock it had been chiselled from.\n\nBut a pathway cleared in the thick of the crowd, and, without a glance\nto either side, Shabako's proud figure strode down it, driving his\nprisoners before him.\n\nCraig heard low gasps of astonishment, glimpsed the people fall back\nas he walked forward, saw the amazement in their eyes. The statue of\nthe god seemed to grow as he neared the altar; it was in squatting\nposture, with hands outstretched, one above the other. The American\nwas to learn the reason for that position later. Now he had only a\nfleeting impression of it, for a man stepped from his ceremonial\nposition beside the god's feet and met Shabako halfway.\n\nHis face was thin and cunning, with slanted rat's eyes. Ornate\nhead-dress and stiffly inlaid robes denoted him to be the High Priest.\nHe held a claw-like hand high.\n\n\"Hold!\" he bade shrilly. \"Who art thou to come thus into the Temple,\ncalling thyself Shabako--Shabako, who has been dead these twenty\nyears?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe words were a thunderbolt of surprise, both to the Pharaoh and\nTaia, and to Wes Craig. He could not see Shabako's face, but he saw\nhis tall form pause, and his tensed muscles relax.\n\n\"Dead ... these twenty years?\" the Egyptian at last repeated slowly,\nstruggling to overcome the shock. \"Why, 'twas but a few hours ago that\nI left this Temple, in pursuit of--\" He peered at the priest's sly\nface. \"Who art thou?\" he demanded suddenly.\n\n\"Hrihor, High Priest of Aten.\"\n\nCraig heard the girl whisper something, inaudible because of her\nsurprise, but Shabako's bewildered voice cut in:\n\n\"Hrihor! It cannot be! Thou art not Hrihor! When last I saw Hrihor, he\nwas an under-priest of twenty. Ay was High Priest of the Temple! Call\nhim! Where is Ay?\"\n\n\"Dust,\" said the priest. \"Dust these ten years and more.\"\n\nWes's senses were reeling. The bodies in the ice--he had taken it for\ngranted they had only lain there for days; a week at most. That they\nhad been entrapped for twenty years was incredible. Had he known that,\nhe would not even have thought of using the Kundrenaline. Twenty years\nago he had been a boy of eight; it meant--Lord!--it meant the youthful\ngirl beside him was twice her age; and Shabako an old man! Old--yet\nyoung! Fantastic, unimaginable--yet true!\n\nHe saw Shabako pass a hand over his face, as if his body were suddenly\ntired; but the next moment it tautened again and he swung around. His\nface was unreadable. A multitude of conflicting emotions struggled\nthere. He strode to a group of several of the older men.\n\n\"Look at me!\" he cried, facing them squarely. \"Look well at my\nfeatures! Am I not he who twenty years ago--as the High Priest\nsays--pursued the priestess and her lover into the land of ice? Am I\nnot the man who ruled thee? Am I not Shabako? Is this not the\npriestess, Taia?\"\n\nThey stared at him. Remembrance suddenly gleamed on their faces. A\nthin, cracked voice shrilled:\n\n\"Yea! Thou art Shabako! Thou art Shabako as he was twenty years\nago--old, yet without the lines of age on thy brow! And the\npriestess--well do I remember her. That is she!\"\n\nA hand pointed at the trembling girl; all eyes centered on her. The\nHigh Priest's mouth dropped open, and he believed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen Shabako breathed deeply, drew himself up and with kingly dignity\nfaced the ranks of his people, sword again held imperiously aloft.\n\n\"Thou hast seen!\" he cried. \"Thou hast heard! Here is the guilty\nTaia--and here am I, returned to thee, still with the strength of my\nprime! As I was about to slay the rash Inaros, the ice entrapped us,\nand for twenty years we lay thus, while my spirit pursued those two\nguilty ones across the River of Death. Then Aten aided me, filled my\nveins with His holy fire and melted the ice from our bodies. We lived\nand breathed again. With His divine help I slew Inaros and brought the\ntransgressing virgin back to the Temple. Twenty years have passed--but\nof years Aten thinks nothing. Give praise to our God!\"\n\nA breathless silence swallowed his shout. Then a mighty roar burst\nout, an exultant roar that soared up past the impassive image of the\ngod and rolled in thunderous echoes along the roof. \"Praise to Aten!\nPraise to Aten!\"\n\nWesley Craig smiled wryly. He could hardly credit the Kundrenaline's\npower in wiping twenty years away; but it was evidently true. Shabako,\nhe saw, really believed the superstition-conceived story he had just\nspun, so--now what?\n\nThe High Priest was staring at him malevolently, his slanted eyes\nfastened on his garb of furs. His weedy voice pierced through the\nechoes.\n\n\"O divine Shabako,\" he questioned shrilly, \"who is this stranger?\"\n\nThe Pharaoh's glance was contemptuous. \"A blasphemer,\" he said\nharshly. \"One who dares claim--\"\n\nBut Wes had understood the question. He stepped forward. Frankly and\nsimply, he told his story.\n\n\"I found thy ruler and the maid and her lover in the ice, entrapped,\"\nhe concluded. \"I cut them out and, with a fluid which is of common\nknowledge in my country, restored them to life. I told this to\nShabako, but he overpowered me and--\"\n\n\"Hear thou!\" bawled the Pharaoh, furiously breaking in. \"Blasphemy! He\nclaims the might of the God! Back, dog, lest I kill thee here myself!\"\n\nWes saw how hopeless it was; he shrugged and stepped back. He read all\ntoo plainly the hatred in Shabako's eyes; his frank story had also\napparently inflamed the High Priest against him. There was not a\nfriend in the whole Temple, save the girl--and the next moment Hrihor\nwalked to her.\n\nHis slanted eyes ran over her figure. A sneering smile appeared. \"So!\"\nhe observed mockingly. \"Taia is returned to the Temple! Yes, well do I\nremember thee now--the scornful cast of thy mouth, the proud bearing\nof thy head. Even Aten thou were scornful of, I remember. Aten\nremembers too!\" He turned slightly. \"Listen, O Shabako. Three days ago\nthy elected successor, Siptah, died. We had met to choose a new ruler.\nBut, by the will of the God, thou art returned and art again Pharaoh.\nThy people are grateful to Aten. In twelve hours a sacrifice shall\nproclaim our gratitude.\" His crafty eyes again swung to the girl.\n\"There!\" he shrilled, \"--she pays for her sin. She is the sacrifice!\"\n\nThere was a great shout from the crowd, but the words that Shabako\nthen cried savagely were plainly audible to Wes Craig.\n\n\"Aye. Taia. O High Priest--and the blasphemous stranger, too! Both\nshall die in the hands of Aten!\"\n\nThe priest nodded, smiling cruelly. \"'Tis well, Shabako. Both shall\ndie!\"\n\nTaia's frightened eyes met Craig's, then lifted to the form of the\nidol. He too peered up at it, and for the first time its hideousness\nand the cold-blooded cruelty of its design struck him.\n\nThe rudely carved figure was a full forty feet high. The impassive\nface, horrible in the lifelessness of rock, stared unseeingly down on\nits worshippers. One gross black hand was held some ten feet above the\npalm of the other, and, inserted in its palm, was a long, keen-pointed\nblade. The living sacrifice would be tied to the lower palm; the\nupper, by some trickery, would be made to slowly descend....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA surge of panic swept over Craig. In his mind he saw the slight,\nhelpless form of the girl strapped to that grim paw, saw the knife\ninch down, saw it touch and prick and finally drive through her heart.\nAnd it would be the same for him! A flame of blind fury burst in him,\nmaking him reckless; mad.\n\n\"The hell we die!\" he yelled, in English, and with a great bound he\nwas at Taia's side. A priest leaped for him, but Craig shot a foot out\nand sent him sprawling. Then, with eyes flaming and legs outthrust, he\nstood in front of the girl, facing the worshippers.\n\n\"Fools!\" he roared. \"Listen to me! My words are truthful! I do not\nlie, as does thy Pharaoh! I can prove that which I say! I can--\"\n\n\"Take him!\" the High Priest shrieked. \"Forward! Take him!\"\n\nCraig could handle one or two, but not a dozen. A mass of men, women,\nsoldiers, priests, swept at him. There was a brief moment of struggle,\nof oaths and shouts and excited yells from the crowd in the Temple,\ntill something thudded into the American's head and he went down. Feet\ntrampled him; men surged over him; then blessed unconsciousness\nen-wrapped him, and he knew no more.\n\nHe did not hear, as did Taia, Shabako's command:\n\n\"To a chamber with them! Guard them well, till the time of sacrifice!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA small party, led by the stocky figure of the captain of the\nPharaoh's guard, wound its way through a network of corridors, past\njagged walls down which water slowly dripped, across a swaying bridge\nof hides that spanned an awful chasm in the volcano's very heart, and\ncame at last to a large dark hole in the rock.\n\nThe captain turned. \"In there!\" he commanded harshly. The two figures,\nman and girl, were dumped like sacks of flour into the gloomy\nchamber. The men who had carried them turned and tramped away; the\ncaptain faced one who had stayed.\n\n\"Guard them with thy life, Sitah. Thou knowest the payment for\ncarelessness.\"\n\nSitah nodded grimly. He was fully armed, with spear and sword. He sat\ndown outside the dark hole, and the captain retraced his steps. The\npad of his feet on the floor died away, and then, for a long time,\nthere was silence.\n\nPerhaps every five minutes Sitah turned and stared down into the hole\nbehind, ears craned for the slightest sound. But none came. The two\ninside, no doubt, were asleep.\n\nIt was very hot, down in the deep-buried corridor, and though Sitah\nwas accustomed to the heat, he soon found his eyelids drooping and his\nwhole body crying out for sleep. But he did not go to sleep. He knew\ntoo well what would befall him in Aten's hands if he did. He had seen\nmany old men and women die in those hands, on ceremony days--old\npeople who croaked in helpless agony as the keen knife blade dropped\nslowly down toward them, paused a second, inches from their hearts,\nand then plunged in with a rush. Old men and women, useless, their\nyears of service gone. Yes, and many unwanted girl children....\n\nThat was what the Sun God demanded. His hands reached ever for human\nbodies. It was cruel, but he was a god; and who was to question the\nwill of a god?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSitah was very glad when, after six hours of lonely vigil, another\nguard relieved him and took his place outside the dark hole. Sitah\nspoke humorously to him, a grim kind of humor, as befitting one who\nhas seen much death.\n\n\"They sleep, Hapu,\" he said, nodding into the prison. \"But soon a\nlonger sleep will come for them--the sleep of the knife!\" He chuckled\nas he made his way far below, to his bed. A few hours of rest and he\nwould be in fine fettle for the ceremony.\n\nThe relieving guard grunted and peered into the cell. He saw two dark\nfigures outstretched, mere blobs of black, a little blacker than the\nshadows. Yes, they slept....\n\nHe sat down on the bench Sitah had just vacated. He had four hours to\nwait. Then the priests, led by Hrihor, would come, and the ceremony\nwould begin, and the god's hands would move together. It would be a\nfine show! He looked forward to it keenly. It would be delicious to\nsee that girl Taia bared to the knife. It would please the god: seldom\ndid his hands hold such a beautiful sacrifice. And the queer stranger,\ntoo--he would probably die very noisily. When he saw the knife sliding\ndown, he would regret his blasphemy and shriek for forgiveness!\n\nFor along time Hapu sat quite motionless. He was a good watchdog.\nHours passed; his vigil was nearing its end; the priests would soon\ncome. Soon--\n\nA slight noise came from the cell behind him.\n\nHe whirled around. The noise came again, louder. A voice cried out.\n\n\"Water! Water! I am dying!\"\n\nHapu grunted. It was the stranger's voice. The stranger must not die;\nit would spoil the ceremony; Aten would be wroth. He stared into the\nhole.\n\nOne of the figures was tossing, writhing painfully. The agonized cry\nechoed again. \"Water! Please! I am dying!\"\n\nHapu strode into the cell.\n\nFor a moment he stood still, peering down at the tossing figure. His\nbrain suddenly shouted alarm. This was no human body! \"What--\" he\nbegan.\n\nBut the question was never finished. Something hard crashed into the\nback of his skull; his spear dropped with a clank, and he slumped to\nthe floor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOut of the shadows, behind, a man emerged and bent down over the\noutstretched figure of the guard. A smile appeared on the man's lean\nface: the guard was out--cold. It took Wes Craig just a moment to\nascertain this; then he tiptoed over to a dark form that lay on the\nfloor--the girl, whose pale, anxious face peered up out of the\nshadows. Craig cut her bonds with the guard's sword and raised her to\nher feet. She stood close to him, clinging to him, trembling, almost\nnot believing she was free.\n\nHer eyes were filled with awe as she looked up into the American's\neyes. \"First thou didst restore me to life,\" she whispered, \"and now\nthou hast broken thy bonds. Surely, thou must be a god!\"\n\nWes smiled. \"It was simple, Taia. Look! This buckle on my belt--'tis\nsharp. I edged it round and cut the rope. It was slow work, else we\nwould have been free long before.\"\n\n\"But I saw thee toss and writhe on the floor, and cry out for water!\"\n\nCraig kicked a pile of furs that had been heaped one on top of the\nother, and tied together with thread from an unraveled woolen mitten.\n\"This was my body,\" he said coolly. \"Furs. The cell must be a\nstoreroom for them--lucky for us. I was standing with a rock in my\nhand near the door, when I cried out for water.... We shall not die in\nAten's hands, Taia! See--I have a sword. With luck--\"\n\nThere was a warmer quality than reverence in Taia's eyes when she\nspoke--though she did not realize it. \"Then come quickly, O Stranger!\"\nshe said. \"The guard has been changed once; the time for sacrifice\nnears!\"\n\nCraig nodded. Only a sword was in his hand; his automatic, he found,\nhad been taken from him while he lay unconscious in the Temple,\nprobably desired as a curious heathen object. The discovery, made when\nhe had cut his bonds, had been a serious blow to his hopes: with a\nsword, he was only a human being, but with a gun he might have passed\nas supernatural to this primitive race.\n\nBut it could not be helped. He peered to each side, gestured to the\ngirl, and together they started up the sloping incline of the\ncorridor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe heat of the earth was great, down where they were, and it made the\npassageway muggy and odorous. Fitful shadows were flung by widely\nseparated oil lamps as they pressed forward--grotesque splotches of\nblack that half a dozen times tightened the American's grasp on his\nsword, sure that a guard had come upon them. He knew that their margin\nof time in which to effect escape was small, and he gradually\nquickened their pace, sacrificing caution for speed. Taia's hand was\nin his left; and he had just turned to her to ask if they were taking\nthe best course up to the surface, when suddenly she stopped short.\n\n\"Hearken!\" she whispered, frightened.\n\nWes craned his ears. For a moment there was nothing but silence. Then\na faint sound trembled through the shadows. It could only have been\nthat of many approaching footsteps.\n\n\"The priests!\" Taia murmured, tightening her grip on his hand. \"They\ncome!\"\n\nThere was a sharp bend in the corridor fifty feet ahead; from behind\nit a growing clatter of sandals echoed through the rock-walled\npassageway. Craig paused, irresolute. \"Are we blocked, ahead?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Yes,\" her low voice hurriedly told him. \"But we can go back, cross\nthe bridge of the chasm and go up the other side. But others may be\nthere, and--\"\n\nA shout cut her words short. Dim figures appeared around the bend in\nthe passage. They were discovered!\n\nWes Craig's face set grimly; he worked his hand into a good grip on\nthe sword handle, looked levelly at the gathering crowd ahead and\nsaid:\n\n\"I think it best to face them now, Taia. I can hold them for minutes\nat least; thou canst perhaps escape. Rest assured I shall take that\nHigh Priest with me, when I cross thy River of Death!\"\n\n\"But where can I go?\" cried the girl. \"Nay, Divine One--I shall stay\nat thy side!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe excited yells of Hrihor, urging the others forward, came plainly\nto their ears. Swords glittered in the gloom of the corridor, and like\na foam-tipped wave that slowly gathers speed the group of priests and\nsoldiers charged down on the man and girl. Craig saw that she would\nnot run.\n\n\"Then come!\" he shouted, and swung her around. With desperate speed\nthey retraced their steps. They soon passed their cell, and recklessly\nleaped through the deceptive shadows on the far side, on down the\ncorridor.\n\nThe High Priest and the others followed close behind. His crafty face\nwas distorted with rage, and he kept screaming to his men: \"The wrath\nof the God on thee if they escape!\" Craig's ears caught that, and he\nfound time for a bitter smile. _If!_ If only they had left him his\nautomatic! A few bullets flung into them would even matters a trifle.\n\nThe corridor twisted and slanted ever downward. They panted around a\ncorner and came to the brink of a dark pit. \"Down!\" cried the girl.\nShe led the way, nimbly dropping down the fifteen-foot rawhide ladder\nthat was there. Halfway down the ladder Wes reached up with his sword\nand cut it from where it was fastened. He fell to the bottom of the\nhole with a grunt. As he extricated himself from the ladder's\nentangling meshes be yelled up, \"Come and get us, you cutthroats--if\nyou can!\" and was off after the lithe form of the girl.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the action helped them but little, and added only a few feet to\nthe distance between them and their pursuers, for they boldly made the\ndeep drop without sending for another ladder. Taia was sobbing for\nair, and Wes himself beginning to feel the bitter pang of hopelessness\nwhen they rounded a corner and came to a great chasm--a wide cleft in\nthe very heart of the volcano. A terrific heat came from its maw of\nunbroken black, and a peculiar, choking odor, sulphurous. Across it\nwas a slender framework of hides and thongs--a mere catwalk over the\nterrible depths below.\n\n\"You first!\" Craig snapped, and as Taia started across a spear came\nhurtling from the mob behind, and clanked against the rocky wall on\nthe far side. Nimbly Taia sped over the bridge, and Wes, the yells of\nHrihor and his men loud in his ears, followed.\n\nMidway a long spear snaked after him. It missed by inches, and went\npitching into the gulf. In his haste he caught his foot on the\ninterlaced thongs, stumbled and almost fell--which saved his life, for\nanother spear streaked through the very spot he had been a second\nbefore. Then he was across, and his sword was flashing in vicious\nhacks at one of the two main supporting thongs of the bridge.\n\nThe hide was tough, but Craig's strength was that of a desperate man,\nand in several mighty strokes he severed it. The framework slumped to\none side, held only by one thong. Hrihor, half across, croaked in\nsudden horror and sprang back as he saw the stranger raise his blade\nto carve through the other support. But even as the sword swept down a\nspear streamed from a warrior's hand and thudded against Wes's right\nshoulder.\n\nHis sword jarred loose. It fell into the chasm.\n\n\"Thou art hurt!\" cried the girl. Wes grinned wryly.\n\n\"Nay,\" he said, \"but weaponless. Lead on!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were now on the other side of the chasm in the tunneled volcano.\nThe priests had hesitated a moment when the bridge had slackened; but\nnow, seeing the weaponless man and girl disappear in a tortuous\ncorridor ahead, they sidled across the damaged catwalk after their\nfierce leader.\n\n\"They will go past the Temple!\" Hrihor shrilled. \"It is Taia who leads\nhim: again she tries to escape to the land of ice! Follow--up here!\"\n\nHis words were true. The corridor that led by the Temple was the one\nwhich led to the only other passage up to the crater of the volcano.\n\nBut Taia had guided Craig only a few steps past the place of worship,\nnow a silent vault of impenetrable blackness when, turning a corner,\nthe American felt her shrink back.\n\n\"Shabako comes!\" she told him faintly.\n\nQuickly he verified it. Led by the Pharaoh himself, a party of\nsoldiers was coming down the corridor some thirty yards away. Even as\nWes saw them, they saw him--and Shabako's roar of sudden alarm tingled\nhis ears.\n\nPriests behind, soldiers and the blood-lustful Pharaoh ahead. They\nwere cut off, blocked, trapped. There was no nearby branch passage to\nrun down; there was no way to turn. It was the end of the game.... But\nno, not quite, Craig told himself grimly. His sword was gone, but his\nfists would tell on them before he went down, before the paws of the\nidol finally claimed him....\n\nHe stepped before Taia, clenched his fists, and waited the shock of\nthe charge.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe could see the fury in Shabako's narrowed eyes, so close were they,\nwhen a soft hand pulled him back. It was Taia's.\n\n\"Come!\" she whispered, and darted swiftly back to the gloomy,\nshadow-filled entrance of the Temple. And wondering, Wes Craig\nfollowed.\n\nShe glided through the pillared portal and was immediately swallowed\nup by a shroud of silent, velvety darkness. Wes could not see her, but\nher soft hand touched his arm lightly to guide him forward, and he\nsensed the girl's warm body close to his. Where was she going?\nInevitably they would be trapped in the far end of the Temple, beneath\nthe very hands of the idol--or so he thought. But he trusted her, and\nwent on.\n\nA shout came from the entrance. \"They went in here!\" someone cried,\nand the two heard Shabako detailing swift instructions to his\nmen--instructions which were cut short by another clatter of feet and\nthe approaching voice of Hrihor. Priests and soldiers had joined, a\nconfusion of men, most of them hanging back, half afraid to venture\ninto the well of blackness that was Aten's abode on earth.\n\nBut the Pharaoh whipped them into discipline with the harsh tones of\nhis voice, and strung them into a close line, to advance slowly\nthrough the Temple. \"Have thy blades ready!\" he added. \"They cannot\nescape us now: they are trapped. Forward!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNothing could get through that line. It was like a fine-toothed comb,\nwith every tooth a man. Craig saw it coming, and knew that he and the\ngirl could not go much farther back, for already he sensed himself\ndirectly beneath the looming figure of Aten. Yet the gentle touch led\nhim on--around and past the idol into the furthermost corner of the\nTemple. It was then that Taia paused, felt around, and placed Craig's\nright hand upon some unseen knob in the wall. Her faint whisper\nhurriedly explained the purpose of the knob as Wes drank in her words\neagerly.\n\n\"There is a secret room behind the idol, from whence the priests ape\nthe God's voice and move his hands at sacrifice. A priest should be\nthere e'en now, ready for the ceremony. Thou must overcome him, Divine\nOne, and we too can hide therein. Hrihor dare not search for us there\nwhile others are present, for e'en Shabako knows not of the room.\nQuick, then--they come! Thy hand is on the latch of the secret panel.\nI follow thee!\"\n\nWes pressed the girl's hand tightly and his body tensed. Then, without\nhesitation, he jerked the secret panel back. A faint glow of light lay\nahead, and he plunged into the tiny room that lay revealed.\n\nAn alarmed face stared up--the priest! Wes leaped at him, his steely\nfingers thumbing into the man's throat and throttling its scream to a\ngasping choke. All the American's pent-up fury went into a lunge that\nthe priest could not begin to stand against. He was bowled sharply\nover and went down. Craig on top, and there the fight ended as\nsuddenly as it had begun. The priest's head thudded into the smooth\nrock floor; a convulsion quivered his body; he moaned and lay still.\n\nA grim flicker in his eyes, Craig got up and looked around for Taia.\nThen astonishment and cold fear swept through him.\n\nThe secret door was closed--but she was not inside!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now what--\" Wesley Craig gasped.\n\nHe did not dare finish the thought. He glared around, much as a\ntrapped tiger does, his brain a turmoil. His eyes fell on a ladder\nthat led up from the floor to a niche in the left wall--a slit about\nforty feet high, a pool of darkness, shadowed from the thin tongue of\nflame that lit the room. Only half realizing what the slit was, Wes\nsprang forward and leaped up the ladder. A platform was built high up\ninside the niche, a place for a man to stand on. The American reached\nit, pressed himself forward, and peered through a tiny hole that was\nin the rock ahead. He knew it ought to command a view of the Temple.\n\nBut if it did, Craig could see nothing, for there was no light in the\nhuge vault outside. For minutes the brooding silence was not broken,\nsave by an occasional scraping sound made by one of the searching line\nof men. There was no hint of the girl who waited beside the hideous\nfigure of the god, nor of the network that gradually closed in on her.\n\nBut suddenly the silence was shattered by a shout.\n\n\"I have her!\" someone yelled. Then came a multitude of sounds. The\npiercing voice of Hrihor was audible above them all.\n\n\"Light the lamps! Hast thou the other, too?\"\n\n\"Nay--he is not here.\"\n\n\"Not here? What--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA spark of light made an erratic course from the Temple door: someone\nwas bringing a flame to light the lamps. A moment later there was a\nflare of yellow light as the oil in a large wall lamp caught fire, and\nthen the darkness melted further before a wave of light from the\nopposite wall. Now could be seen the warriors who, with gleaming\noutdrawn swords, were clustered around the girl. Shabako was gripping\nher arm and shaking her roughly: the High Priest was drawing to a\nstop before her, to stand glaring at her with hate-inflamed eyes.\n\n\"Tell us!\" roared the Pharaoh. \"Where is the man?\"\n\nShe looked at him levelly. Her eyes were quite calm, and she breathed\nevenly. There was a glorious light in her eyes as she replied.\n\n\"I will tell thee,\" she said; \"though thou wilt not comprehend. He\nvanished. Vanished, even as a god. He was here beside me, in the\ndarkness and then suddenly he was gone. But why not? For he was a\ngod....\"\n\nThe soldiers gaped at her. Silence came down in the Temple. The High\nPriest did not break it, but only stared closely at the girl with eyes\nthat suddenly had something more than hate in them--comprehension, and\na trace of fear....\n\nBut the Pharaoh Shabako's eyes were only wrathful, and he shouted:\n\n\"A god? Vanished, sayest thou? Lies! Lies! But thou canst not lie to\nAten! The God knows of a way to loosen thy tongue!\"\n\nDespite herself, Taia shuddered. She knew that way.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGradually the Temple was filling with other worshippers come to see\nthe sacrifice, and soon there were sixty or seventy of them. The men\noutnumbered the women two to one, and none of them was very old. Fifty\nwas about their age limit--and those who were near this age were\nreluctant to let their eyes rest on the hands of the idol. When they\ndid glance at them, and at the cruel knife blade in the upper one,\nfear showed on their faces. There were also very few children....\n\nHrihor's thin features grew unreadable in the coldness that settled\nupon them. He was now in the role of High Priest: apart, separate from\nthe common mob before him; interpreter of Aten's divine mysteries:\nplaying his part of one who listened to a god's awful whisperings.\nImpassively he superintended the binding of Taia by a priestess, who\ntightened the cords around the girl's slim body with claw-like hands,\na gleam of unholy anticipation on her fleshless, soured face. Then the\nHigh Priest turned from the altar and faced the crowd of people.\n\n\"Silence!\" he commanded. \"Silence, before thy God Aten!\"\n\nA hush fell instantly. Their eyes centered on the bound figure of the\ngirl, standing just beside the lowermost hand of the idol that would\npresently claim her. Her face was very pale, but none could detect\nfear in it. There was an uneasy stir, a shifting of feet, a mumbling,\nas her fresh young beauty struck the watchers. Somewhere a man\nmuttered that she was very young to die. Aten had returned her once:\nperhaps the God did not wish her to perish.... His neighbor demurred.\nAnd the ceremony went on.\n\nOrnate but crude censers were in the hands of two priests; the incense\nwas lit by long tapers, and its acrid odor wound up in wavering purple\nspirals of smoke. On each side of Hrihor were five under-priests, eyes\nstiffly on their superior's impassive face. The soldiers had retreated\nfrom the altar and now were massed in the rear of the Temple, their\nspear blades glittering dully above their heads.\n\nThe High Priest raised his hands slowly, and stared with glazed eyes\ninto the gloom of the ceiling, high above. \"Praise!\" he shrilled.\n\"Praise to Aten!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe assembled worshippers joined him in the chant of sacrifice. It was\nlow and soft, and, at first, almost drowsy, like the slow stir of a\ntropical wind through palm leaves. But soon it quickened with rising\ntones from perfectly concerted voices; it soared up; its tenor\nchanged; it became fierce, lustful, eager for blood, eager for the\nsacrifice, a heathen chant shrilling for sight of a girl's body in the\ngod's, awful hands.\n\nAnd it died in a sad, discordant moan on an expectant note....\n\nHrihor's body, stiff and rigid in its ceremonial robes, did not seem\nhuman as he stretched his arms straight forward and wheeled silently\nto the huge idol of stone. A full two minutes he stood without so much\nas flicking an eyelash; then, not shifting his glazed stare, he\nharshly intoned:\n\n\"Ages ago our ancestors set out from the homeland of Egypt in a great\ngalley, bound for the barbarian countries of the north in quest of\nmetal. But storms seized upon them, drove them far from their course,\ntill at last, weak from hunger, they came to this land of ice, where\ntheir galley was wrecked and they were cast ashore. At first all was\ndark; then came the Sun God Aten's life giving rays, leading them to\nthis mountain, which they inhabited and in which they carved this\nTemple wherein to worship the God who had saved them. The lord of the\ngalley was the first Pharaoh; the priest of the galley was called High\nPriest; the Pharaoh took a concubine to wife--and thus was our\ncivilization begun.\n\n\"There were virgins of the Temple, holy, set apart from man, sacred to\nAten. Never did one betray her sacred trust--never, until Taia fled to\nthe land of ice with the sacrilegious Inaros. Our mighty Pharaoh\npursued them, and after twenty years, by Aten's special grace, slew\nthe man and brought the maid back to pay for her transgression. Never\nbefore has this happened.\"\n\nHe paused, waiting. An under-priest spoke; evidently following some\nritual.\n\n\"Here is the priestess, O High Priest of Aten! What penalty must she\npay?\"\n\n\"Death in Aten's hands!\" the cold voice shrilled instantly. \"The God\nwills it!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut now came an interruption, unexpected and disconcerting to the\nwell-laid plans of Hrihor. The voice of Pharaoh Shabako cried out:\n\n\"Another came with this priestess--a blasphemous stranger! He lies\nconcealed; the maid will not tell where! High Priest, let her be\ntortured in Aten's hands until she reveals where he is!\"\n\nFor a moment Hrihor lost his mask-like rigidity, of expression. His\neyes shifted nervously. But Shabako was not to be denied. Again be\nrepeated his demand.\n\n\"We must pray to Aten to make his hand descend on her, prick and gash\nher, till she divulges!\"\n\nA murmur arose from the people in the Temple: they approved the\ntorture. Hrihor, obviously reluctant, was forced to comply.\n\n\"O mighty Aten,\" he cried, turning to the idol, \"thou hast heard our\nPharaoh. We pray to thee to lay thy hand on the priestess Taia, till\nshe tells where the stranger lies concealed!\"\n\nShabako nodded in approval. While a mumbled prayer rose, four priests\nstrode to the girl, lifted her slight form and flung it on the\nupturned lower band of the idol. They strapped her there securely, her\nbreast but ten feet below the waiting knife. Even then she did not\nstruggle or cry out.\n\nShe did not know who had won the fight inside the secret room, but her\nheart told her it was the mysterious stranger, for was he not a\ngod?--She would not be afraid, for he would surely reveal his\ndivinity, and save her, even as he had from her twenty-year death, and\nfrom her bonds in the cell where they had been imprisoned....\n\nThe softly chanted prayer surged through the Temple. Hrihor's slitted\neyes were on the knife in the upper palm of the idol. Suddenly he\nflung up his arms, and cried:\n\n\"Now, O Aten!\"\n\nThe prayer stopped. With fearful interest the people stared at the\ndagger, at the inert figure of the girl--the more elderly seeing in\nher a hint of what was to come to them when their days of service were\nended.\n\nThe knife started downward.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTaia's eyes were closed. Her breathing was even and regular. She did\nnot seem at all aware of the shaft of steel that slowly, in the hushed\ngasp from the audience, stirred with the stone hand that held it and\nmoved deliberately downward.\n\nTo the silent crowd of worshippers it was a religious phenomenon, and\nwell calculated to strike fear and awe into their hearts. The moving\nidol seemed to be a living thing, motivated by the unseen spirit of\nthe god it represented, who caused the massive upper hand to execute\nhis will. Its movement was slow and clumsy, and close listeners would\nhave heard a slight creaking noise from somewhere behind it--but the\nears of the worshippers were deaf from the fear and the horror in\nwhich they were vicariously participating.\n\nSlowly the hands came together, until the long, wicked shear was but a\nfoot above the bound girl.... It dropped to within inches of her\nflesh....\n\nAnd there it stopped.\n\nThen, before the amazed crowd could realize what was happening, before\neven Hrihor could control the surprise that raised his brows\nincredulously, the palm in which the blade was implanted slowly\nretraced its course and returned to its original position.\n\nA breathless silence reigned in the Temple. The hand was motionless.\nIt did not stir again.\n\n\"The God will not touch his priestess!\"\n\nIt was a faint, awed whisper that came from someone amongst the\nworshippers. But Hrihor heard it, and so did the other priests. While\nthey stared at each other, utterly at a loss, the whisper was taken up\nand repeated on all sides.\n\n\"The God will not touch his priestess!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe High Priest sensed the crowd's conviction, and sensed them turning\nagainst him. His beady eyes glanced around nervously. His lips a thin\nline, he called to his second ranking priest in a tense whisper, and,\nwhen the other came to him, muttered in his ear:\n\n\"'Tis the stranger, hiding in the secret chamber, who does this! He\nhas overcome our brother there, and now controls the levers! And Taia\nknows it; and if she reveals it to the people our hold will be broken!\nShe must be killed!\"\n\n\"Yes! But how? We must be quick!\"\n\nHrihor's crafty face set cruelly. \"I know a way. Watch thou....\"\n\nHe strode to the fore of the altar and flung his hands high. A shrill\nshout from his thin lips cut the uneasy murmuring short.\n\n\"Hearken! Aten will not torture His own priestess! He will not maim\nthose who have sworn their lives to Him!\"\n\nThe silent crowd waited for his next words. He screamed savagely.\n\n\"His High Priest must perform the rite! Aten has appointed me to be\nHis instrument of vengeance!\"\n\nA gleam of unholy exultation was in his narrowed eyes. His face\nworked: he thrust a hand inside his ornate ceremonial vestment.\n\n\"By Divine Will,\" he cried, \"this knife in my hand is the knife in the\nGod's hand!\"\n\nAnd he whipped a long blade from the robe.\n\nNever before had such a ceremony been held in the Temple of Aten, the\nSun God. Never before had the hand of the god paused above the living\nsacrifice and deliberately risen again without tasting blood. It was\nmiracle upon miracle; half-bewildered, Pharaoh Shabako and the herd of\ncommon people alike waited for what would come next, their High\nPriest's savage words somewhat reassuring them that all was correct.\n\nThey saw him clench his dagger tightly and with slow steps advance to\nthe side of the helpless girl. Glaring down at her, he swung the blade\nhigh. It poised directly over her heart. It would not torture her,\nTaia knew: it was death that she read in the High Priest's eyes. She\nclosed her own, and thought of the stranger; she breathed a silent\nprayer to him. She waited.\n\n\"In Aten's name!\" screamed Hrihor, and brought the dagger down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt that second the sharp roar of a sudden explosion thundered through\nthe Temple, and the startled worshippers saw, slowly trickling from\nthe right eye of Aten, a curling streamer of gray smoke. They did not\nknow what had happened. And not until, after a moment of fearful\nsilence, they saw the expression on Hrihor's face change to great\nsurprise, and saw his right hand relax and drop the dagger to the\nfloor, did they comprehend that he had been struck down.\n\nHe clutched at his side, staggered, twisted round, and fell full\nlength before the feet of the god whose representative he was.\n\nA frightened woman close to the altar saw a dark red stain on his\nrobe, and a scream from her lips pierced out:\n\n\"He is dead! Killed by Aten--whose eyes have looked death! Oh!\"\n\nShe flung herself flat on the floor, and the others, back to the\nsoldiers in the rear, did likewise. The priests clustered together in\na scared group, staring fearfully at the right eye of the idol, from\nwhich a wisp of smoke was still trailing. None dared approach the\noutstretched figure of the High Priest. Only Shabako dared look at\nhim.\n\nThe Pharaoh clutched his sword tightly, muttering uneasily to himself.\nNot a sound came from the prostrate multitude. The slow echoes of the\nexplosion died away; again the heavy silence fell. Then Shabako\nsuddenly stared around, and peered up at the stone image of the god.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis ears had caught a sound. It was a panting and scuffling noise, as\nif men were fighting. It grew, even though muffled by apparently\nintervening rock. The beginning of a scream, cut short into a choke,\nadded to its volume. The worshippers far back in the Temple heard it,\nand looked up. There was a muffled crash--then another crash of\nthundering noise, similar to the one that had come from the god's eye.\n\nBut this time no smoke eddied from the eye. The explosion echoed\nthrough the Temple and died away, while all the time Pharaoh Shabako\nstared at the idol. Slow comprehension broke through the bewilderment\non his face. Suddenly he swung around and gripped the cowering form of\nthe second ranking priest, who stood near him.\n\n\"From whence came those sounds, Priest?\" he hissed. \"Tell me!\"\n\nThe frightened priest gibbered unintelligibly, but there was a guilty\nlook on his face which spurred Shabako on. He shook the man and roared\nthe question again. Then the priest spoke.\n\n\"They came--from--the secret chamber,\" he stammered.\n\nA gasp rose from the crowd behind. But before they could master their\nastonishment, Shabako had whipped his sword from its sheath and sprung\nup the altar.\n\n\"Show me this chamber!\" he cried.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUp on the platform in the secret room, his eye glued to the hole that\nwas the eye of Aten, Wes Craig had seen and heard everything that had\ntranspired. He had been shocked to see the brave thing Taia had\nsubmitted to, rather than divulge where he was hidden. Sacrificing\nherself, so that he, a stranger, might have a few more minutes of\nlife! It hurt.\n\nHe had climbed down from the platform and glared around the lower\nfloor of the secret room again, scanning shelves that were crowded\nwith scores of curious objects, sacred relics, properties to aid in\nthe manipulation of the idol and other unidentifiable things--looking\nfor a potential weapon. If the girl had to die--and he--it would be\nbetter to go out and meet his enemies, taking some of them with him in\nfull fight.\n\nAnd then his heart leaped madly at the sight of something lying on one\nof the shelves.\n\nA stumpy black shape, it was, with a short barrel of cold blue steel,\nand it looked as much out of place in that chamber as did the fur-clad\nman who stared half-unbelievingly at it. It was a foreigner, as he\nwas, in the gloomy corridors and chambers of the race that worshipped\nAten. It too was American. It was a friend--his automatic!\n\nTo Wes Craig, bewildered and tired and sadly without hope, it almost\nseemed to be alive, smiling at him with its wicked round mouth. He\npicked it up, and it bolstered his courage, his hope and his energy\nenormously. At once he leaped to the closed entrance-door and felt for\nthe lever that opened it. But there he paused a moment to think.\n\nThere was only the faintest chance of fighting free with Taia now.\nThere were at least thirty men outside, and he had only seven bullets.\nAnd then he remembered where he was, and what the purpose of the\nsecret room was. He remembered, also, a certain nervous expression on\nthe High Priest's face that he had just seen....\n\nHe swung around and inspected the levers and crude wheels of wood that\nled to a handle up in the niche, shoulder-high to whoever might stand\non the platform there. He had had experience with certain idols in\nEgypt. He remembered particularly one that had been worshipped in a\ndegenerate age--its hands, its eyes. And then he stepped over the\nsprawling body of the still unconscious priest and climbed to the\nplatform and his peep-hole again.\n\nAs he pressed himself forward in the niche, and applied his eye to the\nslit, he gently fingered the handle of the large lever right beside\nhim. And he also measured the size of the slit in the right eye of the\ngod....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nCraig had not minded shooting the murderous High Priest Hrihor, but he\ndid not want to kill the under-priest in the secret room. He had had\nno choice in the matter. At the tensest moment in the dramatic scene\nin the Temple, just when he had been hoping that the mysterious death\nhe had sent to Hrihor would frighten the worshippers away, he had\nheard a slight rustling sound behind him, and had turned just in time\nto see a hate-distorted face within feet of him, and a short\ncurved-knife upraised to strike him in the back. It was the priest,\nwhom he had left unconscious below, now revived and coming to kill\nhim.\n\nWes could have shot the man then and there, but he knew the thunder of\nhis gun would betray his presence; so, using the weapon as a club he\nhad struck out at his attacker and tried to block the thrust of the\nknife. For a moment he was successful; but the knife proved the better\nweapon in the close rough and tumble scuffle that ensued and, with its\npoint at his very throat, Wes had been forced to shoot.\n\nHe had killed the man instantly, but he felt no slightest relief. Like\na tiger--even before the crashing echoes had died away in the little\nroom--he sprang back to his peep-hole to see what the effect was\noutside. And just what he feared most was happening. The frightened\npriest in the Temple was telling the suspicious Shabako about the\nhidden chamber--and even then was leading him to the secret entrance!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe two passed the American's line of vision, and after a moment he\nheard them fumbling at the catch of the panel. He could shoot them\nboth down, easily, but there would still be a whole Temple full of\nwarriors and priests to be faced with only three bullets!\n\nThen, in a flash, came an inspiration.\n\nWes swung around, leveled the automatic's muzzle at the hole in the\nidol's eye, sighted carefully, and squeezed the trigger. And as the\nexplosion boomed through the vast chamber outside, he veered the gun\nin a different aim and fired again and again.\n\nThe two huge oil lamps, imbedded one in each side wall, splintered and\ncrashed.\n\n\"Now for it!\" Wes Craig muttered. He sprang for the ladder, snatching\nthe dagger of the dead priest as he passed, and half-slid,\nhalf-tumbled to the floor below. At once he was at the secret door and\ngrasping the lever that worked it; and, pausing only to take a deep\nbreath, he plunged out.\n\nHe came into a scene of wildest confusion. Panic-stricken screams rang\nin his ears; the oil from the cracked lamps, transformed into\nsplatters of flame, had splashed down from the walls and scattered\nfire over much of the floor. A tumult of shadows moiled through the\nflames as the crowd fought to get free. Shrieks and gasps and curses\ncut through the air: the worshippers were caught up in a mob panic\ncaused more by their superstitious frenzy than by the understandable\nfire. The flames pierced fantastically into the blackness, throwing a\nvivid glow on the frantic faces of the people who struggled to get out\nof their reach. The altar was deserted, save for the girl who still\nlay on the hand of the idol....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWes Craig, a blur in the wavering shadows, darted to her side. His\ndagger sped through the cords that bound her, and he lifted her slight\nform down. For a moment she clung to him.\n\n\"I knew thou wouldst come, Divine One!\" she whispered. \"I knew!\"\n\nHe smiled for answer, gripped her hand, and then swiftly led her along\nthe least crowded wall of the Temple towards the door, packed with a\nfrantic, struggling crowd of soldiers, people and priests.\n\nThe deceptive shadows thrown by the flames were kind to them; for some\ntime no one in the whole crowd recognized the two. Everyone was\nreacting in a blind panic of fear from the mysterious thunders that\nhad killed their High Priest, splintered the lamps, and caused the\nresultant inferno of leaping fire. But discovery was inevitable, and\nat last one did see the fleeing pair--one who had kept his head and\nwas looking for them. It was Shabako. He roared:\n\n\"The stranger escapes--and the girl! There, there! Hold them!\"\n\nHis imperative shout brought a measure of control to the soldiers, who\nwere fighting to get through the doorway. They grouped uncertainly\ntogether, gripping their swords and staring wildly around. They saw,\nin the ruddy light of the flames, a grim-faced man pressing into them,\nholding in one hand a stubby black object, and in the other the arm of\nthe sacrifice, Taia.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWes cursed, and, forgetting that the warriors understood no English,\nordered them in that tongue to make way for him. For answer, one of\nthem leaped out at him, his sword swinging up. Craig's face set; he\nlevelled the automatic and fired. The bullet caught the man in the\nmidst of his leap; he spun round, his sword clanked to the floor, and\nhe fell.\n\nWes fired again at the staring mob; then again; but the last time only\na sharp click answered his trigger finger. He flung the gun into the\nthick of the hesitating warriors, swept the dead soldier's sword off\nthe floor and pressed forward, intending to hack his way through.\n\nBut he did not have to. The other warriors were only human. They had\njust seen uncanny, instant death. They shrank back from the door; some\neven ran back from the stranger, preferring the flames to the\nthunder-death that he meted out. The doorway was cleared, and Craig\npulled the girl through.\n\n\"Back to the left!\" she gasped. \"Across the bridge! Quick--Shabako\ncomes!\"\n\nEven as they ran, they heard the Pharaoh's furious bawling as he\nstruggled up to the door of the Temple, which he had not been able to\nreach for the rolling tide of fear-stricken people around him. He was\nshouting:\n\n\"After them--after them! They cross the bridge! Follow them, everyone!\nI will take the other way up and trap them! Hurry!\"\n\nHe turned to the right, panting up the corridor in the direction from\nwhich he had first approached the Temple. And slowly, as they\ncollected their dazed wits, the swarm of warriors and priests and\ncommon people followed the fleeing pair toward the bridge.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWes Craig was tired, but the shouting pursuit lent strength to his\nnear-exhausted limbs. Spears snaked after Taia and him from the\nwarriors close behind; but, once across the dangerous bridge, he\ndisregarded them long enough to hack its supports through and see it\nfade into the blackness beneath. \"Get across now, damn you!\" he\nyelled, and ran again after the girl's leading figure.\n\nAll now depended on their speed in reaching the top of the extinct\nvolcano, and of that speed he was none too confident. He had gone\nthrough two strength-sapping fights in the last hour; his nerves were\nragged from the constant strain, and his breath came in racking sobs.\nHe wished passionately he had a loaded gun--even his smashed vial of\nKundrenaline. The fluid would have put marvelous new life in his weary\nlimbs.\n\n\"Hurry, Taia!\" he gasped: \"we must beat them! Shabako goes some other way\nto head us off! If only we can get to my bird-that-flies-in-the-air!\"\n\nOnce again they stumbled up the difficult passage, fighting for speed\nwith tired bodies, bodies which every twist and obstacle tried sorely.\nWithout the girl, Wes could never have made it: she led him unerringly\nthrough the branching, gloomily-lit corridors, up flights of rickety\nsteps, her knowledge of several short-cuts aiding measurably the speed\nof their progress. Tired as he was, admiration for the mighty fire of\ncourage that burned in Taia's frail figure, and drove it forward when\nall physical strength was gone, never left him. For she had been\nthrough as much as he--and even more!...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey did not know it then, but the Pharaoh had made good time on the\nother side. As they at last neared the cup of the crater, and passed\nthe place where the two diverging main corridors, each slanting\ndownwards, met, they heard Shabako's shouts and the rapid clatter of\nhis feet on the rock floor.\n\nIn a desperate sprint, they gained the flight of steps, stumbled up\nthem, and came again into the glorious fresh cold air, and the\nslanting rays of the setting sun....\n\nNew life surged through Craig's body; but, whereas he ran across the\nuneven cup of the crater with fresh speed, the girl seamed suddenly to\ntire. He had taken the lead; now he went back, took her hand and\npulled her forward, puzzled by her sudden exhaustion. He did not have\ntime to question her, however, for the rapid beat of footsteps grew\nquickly very loud, and with a shout Shabako burst up into the open and\ncaught sight of them.\n\nThe two went across the lip and slid down the slope of the volcano\nwith all the haste they could. Shabako only twenty yards behind, his\nsword waving aloft and his dark face lit with a savage hate. And he\nwas gaining--gaining steadily; and Taia was tiring more and more, and\nwas becoming almost a dead weight on Wes Craig's supporting arm....\n\nThis was the last stretch, over almost the same ground the girl and\nher dead lover, Inaros, had covered twenty years before--and with the\nsame pursuer behind. Again, by grace of the potent Kundrenaline,\nShabako and the girl were enacting the desperate chase of years\nbefore, the chase that had ended in death for Inaros....\n\nBut there was a stricken look in Taia's eyes now.\n\n\"I am suddenly so tired, Divine One!\" she gasped. She seemed hardly\nable to walk. Craig could not understand. Snatching a glance\nbackwards, he saw that the Pharaoh, too, seemed to be strangely\ntiring--but gaining nevertheless....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was practically carrying the suddenly exhausted girl when they came\nto the cleft in the ice from which he had dug her the day before.\nThere was no time to get across, for before they could climb the other\nside Shabako would be on them. Wes gripped the handle of his blade.\nHere the last fight would have to be made.\n\n\"Go down the cleft, out of the way!\" he told the girl rapidly. He did\nnot have time to help her; he swung round just in time to parry a\nslash of Shabako's sword with his own.\n\nThen Wes Craig stepped back and stared at his opponent, a peculiar\nlook in his eyes.\n\nIt might have been merely from the force of his first swipe, or he\nmight have slipped--but Shabako staggered drunkenly and barely avoided\nfalling. With an oath, he came erect and once more charged at the\nAmerican. It was easy for Wes to avoid his thrust; it would have been\nchildishly easy to drive his blade through the Pharaoh's unguarded\nchest. But somehow Craig withheld his attack, and only peered more\nclosely at the other. He rubbed his hand across his eyes. What he was\nseeing was incredible.\n\nFor Shabako's face was going a ghastly white; and, as Wes watched, he\ngroaned, tried to raise his sword arm for another blow--and could not.\nHe staggered, legs askew, lurched crazily forward, stumbled, and at\nlast pitched down on the ice near the cleft.\n\nThen his great body rolled over, arms flung wide, and lay still. And\nthe face of Pharaoh Shabako stared unseeingly up at the darkening\nsky....\n\nThen, in a flash, understanding came to Wes Craig.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" he cried. \"The Kundrenaline!\"\n\nHe had forgotten completely about the liquid he had infused into\nShabako's veins. Its potency, adequate to the tremendous task of\nrevitalizing a long-dead heart, had given out--hastened, no doubt, by\nthe great physical exertions of the man, and made sudden by the return\nto the biting air of the ice fields. The liquid was only for emergency\nuse, anyway, and supposed to serve for a period of but hours, after\nwhich the heart was intended to carry on alone.\n\nShabako's heart had not been able to carry on any longer....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWes Craig was afraid to think, afraid almost to look, to see how Taia\nhad stood the shock. Her sudden weariness became at once all too clear\nto him....\n\nSlowly he turned and looked down into the cleft. He saw her--a\nslender, quiet little figure, flat on the ice by the body of her slain\nlover.\n\nHe leaped down the slippery bank and ran to her side; knelt there, and\ngrasped her cold white hand.\n\nThe girl's eyelids were closed, but when he touched her, they\nflickered, and a little sigh came from her pallid lips. Then her large\nblack eyes, opened and looked up straight into his--and when she saw\nhim there, she smiled.\n\nIt wrenched the man's heart. \"Taia!\" he cried. \"Taia!\"\n\nShe nodded feebly, still smiling, and her lips moved. He bent close.\nShe was whispering something. The words came to him through a great\nfear.\n\n\"Take me--take me, O Divine One. Take me with thee to--to\nthy--heaven.... Canst thou not--take--Taia?\"\n\nWith her last bit of quickly ebbing strength, she pressed his hand.\nThen the fingers went limp in his, and her arm dropped. And her\neyelids gently closed....\n\nWes's jaws were clenched tightly as he folded her hands across her\nslim body. \"If thy Pharaoh had not made me drop the vial,\" he murmured\nsoftly, \"I would again bring thee to life, Taia, and take thee to my\nheaven.... Though\"--with a sad smile, and relapsing into\nEnglish--\"Times Square would not be quite the heaven you had\npictured....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe stood up. The irony of the thing gripped him, and brought a wry\nsmile to his tight lips. The body of Inaros, her dead lover, lay at\nher side; and Shabako's still figure was but feet away. Once again\nthey were all together in death. The Kundrenaline had pierced the\nblack veil of their silent tryst and brought them back for a few\nfleeting hours; but even modern science could not stand long against\nthe weight of twenty years.\n\nAnd science would not have another chance with their still bodies.\nThey would quickly be found there by the pursuing Egyptians, and would\nbe gone, already decaying, when he could get back with another\nvial....\n\nA growing murmur of nearby voices brought the silent man back to the\npresent. Over the cleft in the ice he saw a string of priests and\nwarriors speeding towards him. He sighed. It was time to go. There was\nmuch he wanted to learn about these people and their strange\ncivilization, but there was no chance for it now. Perhaps on another\ntrip, later.\n\nHe looked a last time on Taia, lying by her lover.\n\nThen he scrambled up the other bank and ran towards the hillock behind\nwhich a sleek black monoplane with an eight hundred horse-power motor\nawaited him....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe thing that followed next was never forgotten by the people who\nworshipped Aten, the Sun God. It went down in legends; it was\nrepeated and repeated, and it grew in the telling. It was awful; it\nwas magical; it was godlike.\n\nA great thunder sounded from behind the hillock of ice, a thunder that\npulsed louder and louder, until the people fell down in awe, hardly\ndaring to look. When they did, they saw a gleaming black form that\nstood on queer shafts of wood come gliding with the speed of the wind\nfrom behind the hillock. It straightened out on a stretch of snow,\nbellowing with a loudness that hammered their eardrums into numbness,\nand sped lightly along till the queer shafts of wood left the surface\nand the sleek black object soared up into the air.\n\nInto the air! With frightened eyes they watched it wheel around, and\nthen come roaring towards them. They fell flat again, and did not dare\nto look. The thunderous blast passed close over them, then dwindled\nand dwindled, until they ventured timidly to look up again.\n\nThey saw the shape ringed with sunset fire hurtling through the air,\nsoaring up and up and up ... till it died to a speck ... till it\ndisappeared into the face of the sun they worshipped as Aten....\n\nA warrior spoke. His tones were low and awed but they all heard him.\n\n\"Truly,\" he whispered, \"he was a god!...\"\n\n\nA ONE-BILLIONTH-OF-A-SECOND CAMERA\n\nThrough use of a spectroscopic camera with a shutter which operates in\nabout one-billionth of a second, physicists at the University of\nCalifornia have been able to take pictures of the action of light at\nvarious periods during the course of an electrical spark which lasts\nonly one one-hundred-thousandth of a second.\n\nThey have been able to show by photographic evidence that the magnetic\nfield developed by the passage of an electric current across the spark\ngap gives the first light emitted a different appearance from that\nemitted a few millionths of a second later.\n\nAt the moment that the spark jumps, electricity is released in\nenormous quantities much as water is released by the breaking of a\ndam. It is this sudden release of the dammed-up current across the\nspark gap that causes the temporary magnetic field and the difference\nin the appearance of the light from the spark.\n\nIn answer to those who scoff at the possibility of a camera shutter\noperating in a billionth of a second, it was explained that the\nshutter is not a mechanical device, but operates automatically through\nthe application of a physical law of light. In a general way, it might\nbe said that the spark takes its own picture.\n\nThe spectroscope camera is set up at one end of a long corridor. When\nthe electrical current jumps across the spark gap it sets up a\nmomentary current in a set of wires running the length of the corridor\nand connected with the camera. This current travels toward the camera\nat the rate of about 186,000 miles a second.\n\nAt about the same instant that the current jumps, or an infinitesimal\nfraction of a second later, the light of the resulting spark starts\ntoward the camera at a trifle more than 186,000 miles a second. It is\na race between the spark current and the spark light as to which\narrives first. The current jumps just before the spark appears; so it\nis possible for the current to reach the camera and close the shutter\neven before the light which is to be pictured arrives.\n\nBy lengthening the wires between the spark gap and the camera the\nlight is allowed to arrive first. By suitable adjustment of the\nwiring, the shutter can be made to close during any one-billionth of a\nsecond interval during the first four ten-millionths of a second of\nthe spark's short life.\n\nThe camera shutter consists of two Nicol prisms of Iceland spar and\nbalsam, arranged in such a way that under ordinary conditions the\nlight coming from the spark is stopped by polarization and prevented\nfrom reaching the camera. Between these two prisms, however, is a\nsolution of chemicals which will depolarize the light and allow it to\ncontinue.\n\nThe wires leading from the spark gap connect with this solution. When\nthe current jumps across the gap it races down the corridor and\nelectrifies the solution for about one-billionth of a second. This\nelectrification removes the depolarizing effects of the solution and\nlight passage stops; in other words, the shutter is closed.\n\n\n\n\nThe Diamond Thunderbolt\n\n_By H. Thompson Rich_\n\n[Illustration: \"_Good Lord! What's this?_\"]\n\n[Sidenote: Locked in a rocket and fired into space!--such was the fate\nwhich awaited young Stoddard at the end of the diamond trail!]\n\n\nProf. Norman Prescott, leader of the American Kinchinjunga expedition,\ncrept from his dog-tent perched eerily at the 26,000-foot level of\nthis unscaled Himalayan peak, the third highest in the world. With\nanxious eyes he searched the appalling slopes that lifted another\n2,000 feet to its majestic summit, now glistening in the radiance of\nsunset.\n\nWhere was young Jack Stoddard, official geologist and crack\nmountaineer of the party?\n\nThat morning Professor Prescott and Stoddard had set off together,\nfrom Camp No. 4, at the 22,000-foot level. Mounting laboriously but\nswiftly, they had reached the present eyrie by noon. There Stoddard\nhad left the leader of the expedition and pushed on alone, to\nreconnoiter a razor-back ridge that looked as though it might prove\nthe key to the summit.\n\nBut the afternoon had passed; the daring young geologist had promised\nto return in an hour; and now it was sunset, with still no sign of\nhim.\n\nProfessor Prescott sighed, and a bitter expression crossed his\nbronzed, lined face. Just one more evidence of the cursed luck that\nhad marked the expedition from the start!\n\nWell he knew that he must head down at once for Camp No. 4 or risk\ndeath on this barren, wind-swept slope, and equally well he knew that\nto go would be to leave his brave companion to his fate, providing he\nhad not already met it on those desolate ridges above.\n\nYes, and another thing he knew. The report of this latest disaster\nwould mean the doom of the expedition. The terrified, superstitious\nnatives would bolt, claiming the \"snow people\" had struck again.\n\n\"Gods of the Mountain\" they called them, those mysterious beings they\nalone seemed to see--evil spirits who kept guard over this towering\nrealm, determined none should gain its ultimate heights.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTensely Professor Prescott stood there on that narrow shelf of glacial\nice, peering off into the sunset.\n\nA hundred miles to the west, bathed in the refulgence of a thousand\nrainbows, rose the incredible peak of Everest, mightiest of all\nmountains, yet less than 1,000 feet higher than Kinchinjunga. And\ndown, straight down those almost vertical slopes up which the\nexpedition had toiled all summer, lay gorges choked with tropical\ngrowth. Off to the south, a scant fifty miles away, the British health\nstation of Darjeeling flashed its white villas in the coppery glow.\n\nAn awesome spectacle!--one that human eyes had seldom if ever seen.\nYet from the summit, so invitingly near!...\n\nPerhaps, even now, Stoddard was witnessing this incomparable sight. To\npush on, to join him, meant triumph. To head down, defeat. While to\nstay, to wait....\n\nGrimly, Professor Prescott left his insecure perch and headed up over\nthat razor-back ridge whence the young geologist had vanished.\n\nAs he proceeded cautiously along, drawing sharp, quick breaths in the\nrarefied upper atmosphere, he told himself it was ambition that was\nleading him on, but in his heart he knew it was not so. In his heart,\nhe knew he was going to the rescue of his gallant companion, though\nthe way meant death.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA hundred yards had been gained, perhaps two--each desperate foothold\nfraught with peril of a plunge into the yawning abysms to left and\nright--when suddenly he spied a figure on a twilit spur ahead.\n\nPanting, he paused. It must be Stoddard! Yet it seemed too small, too\nghostly.\n\nProfessor Prescott waved, but even as he looked for an answering\nsignal, the figure vanished.\n\n\"My eyes!\" he muttered to himself. \"I'm getting snow-blind.\"\n\nThen he called aloud:\n\n\"Jack! Oh, Jack! Hello!\"\n\nOnly an echo greeted the call, and he did not repeat it but pushed on\nsilently, conserving his energy.\n\nWas there truth after all in those persistent rumors of the natives\nabout the snow people who inhabited the upper slopes of the Himalayas?\nHis tired brain toyed with the idea, to be cut off sharply by the\ncheery call:\n\n\"Hi there, Professor! Hi-ho!\"\n\nAnd gazing upwards toward a jutting crag not ten rods beyond, he saw\nyoung Stoddard etched against the darkening sky.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a few joyous steps, Professor Prescott had reached his audacious\ncompanion.\n\n\"Thank God!\" he gasped. \"I'd given you up for lost.\"\n\n\"Why give me up for anything so unpleasant?\" was the genial reply.\n\"I've just been enjoying the view.\"\n\n\"Then--then you reached the top?\" with a quick intake of breath.\n\n\"Well, not exactly, but I feel on top of the world, just the same.\"\n\nThe professor's spirits fell.\n\n\"Then I can't see--\"\n\n\"Of course you can't see!\" interrupted Stoddard. \"But look at this!\"\n\nAs he spoke, he drew from a pocket of his leather jacket something\nthat caught the last light of the dying day and refracted it with\nweird brilliance.\n\nProfessor Prescott blinked.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"A diamond. As big as your fist! And here's another!\"\n\nHis left hand reached into his jacket and produced a second sparkling\ngem.\n\n\"But--but I don't understand--\"\n\n\"Granted. But you will, when I tell you I've found the Diamond\nThunderbolt!\"\n\nThe professor gave a shrug of scorn.\n\n\"And no doubt you've seen the snow people and have had a perfect\nafternoon, while--\"\n\n\"No, I haven't seen any snow people, but I've had a perfect afternoon,\nall right! As I said, I've found the Diamond Thunderbolt; and here are\na couple of chips, picked up from around the edge.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo saying, Stoddard extended his two specimens toward Professor\nPrescott, who disdained at first to touch them.\n\n\"Nothing but quartz!\" was the deprecating comment. \"The snow has\naffected your eyesight, as it has my own.\"\n\n\"I'll say it's affected _yours_, if you don't recognize diamonds when\nyou see them. But wait till I show you the old Thunderbolt itself!\nIt's--\"\n\n\"More quartz!\" brusquely. \"Be sensible, Jack. This Diamond Thunderbolt\nthing is a pure myth, like the snow people business. Just because this\nsection of India is known as The Land of the Diamond Thunderbolt you\nthink you're going to find some precious meteor or other, whereas the\nterm applies merely to the Lama's scepter.\"\n\n\"Granted it does,\"--a little impatiently--\"but did it ever occur to\nyou that where there's smoke, there's fire? Meteor is the word! One\nstruck here once--a diamond meteor!--and I've found it. Take a look at\nthese two specimens and see what you think.\"\n\nWhereupon Professor Prescott accepted the glinting gems from his young\nfriend--to gasp a moment later, as he held them tremblingly:\n\n\"Good Lord--they're diamonds, to be sure! Where did you find them?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStoddard hesitated before replying.\n\n\"Not far from here,\" he said at length, moving off. \"Come, I'll show\nyou.\"\n\nBut the professor stood firm on their narrow ledge.\n\n\"You must be crazy!\" he exclaimed. \"We'll have trouble enough now,\ngetting back. It's practically dark already.\"\n\n\"Then what's the odds?\" retorted the young geologist. \"We've got all\nnight.\"\n\n\"But our friends at Camp No. 4. Even now, they must think we are\nlost.\"\n\n\"Then further thought won't kill them. Besides, we'll be back before\nmorning--and they can't send out a relief party sooner.\"\n\n\"But any moment a storm may come up. You know what that would mean.\"\n\n\"Does it look likely?\" scoffed Stoddard, waving his hand aloft.\n\"See--there's the moon! She'll be our guide.\"\n\nProfessor Prescott looked, saw a slender shallop charting her course\namong the stars, and for a moment was tempted. But speedily his\nresponsibilities reasserted themselves.\n\n\"No, I can't do it,\" he said with finality. \"I owe it to the\nexpedition to return as soon as possible. Furthermore, there's the\nmatter of the authorities. We assured the British we would adhere\nstrictly to our one purpose--to scale Kinchinjunga.\"\n\n\"A mere formality.\"\n\n\"No--a definite order from the Lamas. They closed Mt. Everest, after\nthe last expedition, you will recall. The Lama's scepter is veritably\na diamond thunderbolt of power in this region.\"\n\nWhereupon Stoddard's patience snapped.\n\n\"Listen!\" he said. \"I hurried away because I knew you'd be anxious,\nbut I'm going back, if I have to--\"\n\n\"And I say you're not!\" The professor's patience, too, had snapped.\n\"I'm not going with you, and you're not going back alone! As the\nleader of this expedition, I forbid it!\"\n\nThe younger man laughed raspingly, as he shook off the hand that\nclasped his arm, and for a moment it looked as though the two would\nfight, there on that dizzy ledge above the world.\n\nThen Stoddard got control of himself.\n\n\"Sorry!\" he said. \"I see I've got to tell you something, Professor.\nYou think I'm merely the geologist of this expedition, but in fact I'm\na secret service man from Washington, on the trail of the biggest\ndiamond-smuggling plot in history--and here is where the trail ends!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nProfessor Prescott's astonishment at these words was profound. He\nstood there blinking up at Stoddard, scarcely believing he had heard\naright.\n\n\"You--you say you are--?\"\n\n\"A detective, if you want. Anyway, if you've read the papers, you must\nknow that for the past year or more the diamond markets of the world\nhave been flooded with singularly perfect stones.\"\n\n\"Yes, I recall reading about that. They were thought to be synthetic,\nwere they not?\"\n\n\"By certain imaginative newspaper reporters, not by the experts, for\nunder the microscope they revealed the invariable characteristics of\ndiamonds formed by nature--the tiny flaws and imperfections no\nartificial means could duplicate.\"\n\n\"But didn't I read something, too, about some anonymous Indian rajah\nwho was thought to be raising money by disposing of his jewels?\"\n\n\"More newspaper rubbish! For one thing, British secret service men\ntraced the rumor down and satisfied themselves there wasn't a rajah in\nIndia unloading any diamonds. For another; no rajah could possibly\nhave the wealth involved. Why, do you know that since this plot\nunfolded, over five million carats' worth have made their\nappearance--and that means something like a billion dollars.\"\n\n\"Whew!\" whistled the professor.\n\n\"Whew is right!\" his companion agreed. \"And not only have the diamond\nmarkets of the world been disorganized by this mysterious influx, but\nthe countries involved have lost millions of dollars in revenue, due\nto the fact that the gems have been smuggled in without payment of\nduty.\"\n\n\"But surely, my dear fellow, you don't connect this gigantic plot with\nyour discovery of--whatever it is you have discovered?\"\n\n\"A diamond as big as a house! That's what I've discovered! And I most\nsurely _do_ connect the plot with it. Did you ever have a hunch,\nProfessor? Well, I had one--and it's worked out!\"\n\n\"You leave me more in the dark momentarily!\" declared the older man,\nglancing around as though to give his words a double meaning. \"What\nwas your hunch, and how did it come to lead you here?\"\n\nWhereupon Stoddard told him, swiftly, for there was no time to lose.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen first assigned to the case, he said, he had been as baffled as\nanyone. But as he had studied the problem, one outstanding fact had\ngiven him the clue. All the gem experts agreed that the mysterious\nflood of smuggled stones was of Indian origin, being of the first\nwater and of remarkable fire--in other words, of the finest\ntransparency and brilliance.\n\nTherefore, since they were genuine and were seemingly coming from\nIndia, Stoddard had concentrated his attention on this country,\nseeking their exact source. Investigation showed that there were no\nmines within its borders capable of producing anything like the\nquantity that was inundating the market.\n\nBut--and here was where the hunch came in--there was a district in the\nSikkim Himalayas of Bengal whose capital was Darjeeling--Land of the\nDiamond Thunderbolt. Why had it been called that? Was there some\nlegend back of it?\n\nThere was, he had learned. For though in modern times the phrase had\ncome to apply merely to the Lama's scepter, as Professor Prescott had\npointed out, originally it had carried another meaning--for legend\nsaid that once a diamond meteor had fallen on the mighty slopes of\nKinchinjunga.\n\nThat had been enough for Stoddard. He had followed his hunch, had got\nhimself attached to the American Kinchinjunga expedition--\n\n\"And that's why I'm here, and all about it,\" he finished. \"Now, then,\nare you coming back with me and have a look at my Diamond Thunderbolt,\nor am I going back alone?\"\n\nA long moment the professor debated, before replying.\n\n\"Yes, I'll come with you,\" he said at length, extending his hand.\n\"Forgive me, Jack. I didn't know, or--\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" said Stoddard shaking. \"How the devil could you, till I\ntold you? But just one thing. Mum's the word--right?\"\n\n\"Right!\"\n\n\"And one thing more. It may be--well, a one-way trip.\"\n\n\"Forget it.\"\n\n\"O. K., Professor.\"\n\nWith a last warm handclasp, leaving them joined in a new bond of\nfriendship, the two men moved on over that narrow, moonlit ridge\nacross the top of the world.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a desperate trail, Professor Prescott realized after scarcely a\ndozen steps. The ridge grew narrower, sheerer, and in places they had\nto straddle it, legs dangling precariously to left and right.\n\nAdmiration for his gallant companion mounted in the professor's\npounding heart, as they struggled on. Only to picture anyone eager to\nreturn such a perilous way, after once getting safely back!\n\nOther thoughts occupied his mind, too, during the next half-hour. More\nthan once he could have sworn he saw small, ghostly figures on the\nridge ahead. But he made no mention of it, for Stoddard didn't seem to\nsee them.\n\nNow they gained the far end of that hazardous ridge, where a sloping\nshelf of jagged rock offered a somewhat more secure footing. Along\nthis they proceeded laterally for some distance.\n\nSuddenly Stoddard paused and called out:\n\n\"Ah--there we are!\" He indicated a steep pocket to the left. \"Have a\nlook down there, Professor, and tell me what you see.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPrescott lowered his eyes to the depths below, to draw back with a\ngasp--for what he saw was a vast phosphorescent glow, like a fallen\nstar.\n\n\"What--what is it?\" he cried, in an awed voice.\n\nAnd back came the ringing reply:\n\n\"The Diamond Thunderbolt!\"\n\n\"But the radiance of the thing! It couldn't reflect that much light\nfrom the moon!\"\n\n\"No, and it doesn't. But there's nothing uncanny about it. Just what I\nexpected the thing would look like at night. But come on, Professor.\nYou haven't seen the half of it!\"\n\nThe way led down the jagged, shelving slope, now, and the descent was\ntoo precarious for further comment.\n\nTen minutes passed--fifteen, possibly--when they reached a sheltered,\nsnowless arena where titanic forces had clashed at some remote age.\nFragments of splintered rock lay strewn in wild confusion--and among\nthem, glinting in the moonlight, were bright crystals.\n\nPicking up one, Stoddard said laughingly:\n\n\"One of Mother Nature's trinkets worth half a million or so!\"\n\nProfessor Prescott blinked at it a moment, almost in disbelief, then\nstooped and picked up one for himself--a diamond that would have made\nthe Kohinoor look like a pebble.\n\nThere was no doubting its genuineness. Even in the moonlight, it\nflashed and burned like a thing afire.\n\nBut as the professor turned his eyes at last from its dazzling facets,\nthey failed him again--or so he thought--for half hidden behind a\njutting crag loomed a huge cylindrical object, seemingly of metal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the space of two breaths, he stared speechless, then gasped:\n\n\"Good Lord! What's that?\"\n\nFollowing his gaze, Stoddard saw it too.\n\n\"God knows!\" he muttered, in a tense voice. \"It wasn't there this\nafternoon. Let's have a look at it.\"\n\nCautiously, not knowing what to expect, they advanced toward the\nsingular phenomenon.\n\nNearing, they saw that it was a mechanism some twenty feet at the base\nand sixty or more feet high, pointed at the top.\n\n\"A rocket!\" declared Professor Prescott. \"Though I've never seen\nanything larger than a laboratory model, I'll gamble that's what it\nis.\"\n\n\"And I'll gamble you're right!\" exclaimed Stoddard. \"And one capable\nof carrying passengers, would you say?\"\n\n\"Fully.\"\n\n\"Then I think we have solved the mystery of how these diamonds reach\nthe market. The question now is, who's back of this thing? And since\nour position here probably isn't any too healthy--\"\n\nHe broke off and drew his automatic, as a small, ghostly figure\nappeared--seemingly from nowhere.\n\nThe professor saw it, too--saw it followed by another, and\nanother--and now he knew his eyesight had not failed him back on that\nwind-swept slope above, either, for these were actual creatures,\nincredible as they seemed.\n\nThe snow people?\n\nHe did not know--had no time to find out--for with a rush, the strange\nbeings were all around them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStoddard levelled his pistol and called on them to halt, but they came\non--scores, hundreds now, seeming to pour out of some unseen aperture\nof the earth.\n\nOnce or twice he fired, over their heads, but it failed to halt them.\nThey closed in, jabbering shrilly.\n\nBut though their words were a babel, their actions were plain enough.\nSwarming up, they overpowered the explorers by sheer numbers, and\nherded them with jabs of sharp, tiny knives toward a cavern mouth that\nopened presently amid those eery crags.\n\nLed underground, they found themselves proceeding along a frosty\npassage lit every few yards by a great chunk of diamond. Their dim\nglow seemed to be refracted from some central point beyond.\n\nThis point they soon reached--a great, vaulted chamber whose\nbrilliance was at first dazzling.\n\nIts source, after the first moment or so, was obvious. It was coming\nfrom the roof, which was one vast diamond.\n\n\"You see where we are?\" whispered Stoddard. \"Under the Diamond\nThunderbolt! These people have tunneled beneath the meteor. Or else--\"\n\n\"Their tunnel was already there, when the meteor fell,\" finished\nProfessor Prescott. \"But can it be possible such creatures could have\nproduced that rocket?\"\n\n\"I'm inclined to think anything is possible, now! But I'm sorry I\ndragged you into this, Professor. I--\"\n\n\"Forget it! We're here and we'll face it together, whatever it is.\"\n\n\"You're a game sport!\" Stoddard gripped the older man's hand. \"We'll\nface it--and lick it!\"\n\nFurther talk was interrupted by a stir among their captors. The ranks\nparted--and into that dazzling chamber stepped a tall, bearded\npersonage whose aristocratic features and haughty bearing suggested a\nRussian of the old regime.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe strode toward them, smiling sardonically.\n\n\"Greetings, my friends! Nice of you to drop in on me while in the\nneighborhood.\" His English was suave, precise. \"Professor Norman\nPrescott, leader of the American Kinchinjunga expedition, I believe.\"\nHe paused and lifted inquiring eyebrows to his other guest. \"And--?\"\n\n\"Dr. John Stoddard, our geologist,\" came the answer stiffly. \"And you,\nsir?\"\n\n\"A fellow professor, you might say. Prince Ivan Krassnov. You have\nheard of me, perhaps?\"\n\nPrescott had indeed. One of Russia's most brilliant and erratic\nscientists under the czar, the man had been permitted to continue his\nwork for the Soviets, developing among other inventions, a rocket\nreported to be capable of carrying passengers. But some two years ago\nhe and his rocket had vanished in the course of a test flight from\nMoscow, and the natural conclusion was that he had either perished in\nthe sea or shot off the earth altogether, since no trace of the unique\nmechanism was ever found.\n\n\"Yes, I have heard of you,\" said the professor, recalling this\nsensational story that had occupied the front pages of the world's\npress for days. \"And so it turns out that your rocket didn't come to\ngrief.\"\n\n\"Not exactly--though as you can see, it landed me in rather an\ninaccessible spot,\" was the reply. \"But quite an interesting one! I\nwas well satisfied to let the papers report me missing. You can\nunderstand, yes?\"\n\n\"I think I can, that part of it.\" While as for Stoddard, he was\nbeginning to understand a great deal. \"But these curious creatures?\"\nhe said, indicating the whispering, pigmy host that filled the cavern.\n\"You found them here?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"They found me, rather!\" corrected the prince. \"But we get on quite\nwell together. They consider me a god, you see, since I, too, came out\nof the sky in a thunderbolt, as their great diamond once did,\naccording to their legends.\"\n\n\"But who are they? What is their origin? Why are they so small, so\npale?\"\n\n\"Natural questions, Professor, but not so easy to answer. Who they are\nI cannot say, save that they are the snow people of native\nsuperstition. Their origin? It is lost in antiquity. Perhaps they are\nthe remnants of some Tibetan tribe driven into the mountains by\nenemies, thousands of years ago. While as for their stature, their\npallor--these no doubt are the result of the furtive underground life\nthey lead.\"\n\nHe paused, waited politely, as though for further questions, but\nneither spoke. Now that the main mystery was solved, the one question\nuppermost in both their minds was what this suave, inscrutable\nnobleman was going to do with them--and that question neither cared to\nask, fearful of what the answer might be.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFinally Prince Krassnov spoke again.\n\n\"What, gentlemen--you have no further curiosity about me? How\nunflattering! I thought perhaps you might want to know why I have\nchosen to maintain my headquarters here on Kinchinjunga, the past two\nyears, and how I have been occupying my time. But I hold no\nresentment. I shall tell you, so that you will be prepared for what I\nam going to propose.\"\n\nHe turned and addressed the pigmy host in what must have been their\nown tongue. Then, facing his guests again, he said:\n\n\"Now, come. Let us retire to my private study, where we shall have\nmore leisure.\"\n\nThey followed him from that dazzling chamber and proceeded on down the\ncavern to a fork that ended about twenty paces further in a massive\nsteel-bound door.\n\nThere he paused and twirled a knob like the dial of a safe. After a\nmoment there came a click, as of tumblers meshing, and a tug on the\nknob swung the door open.\n\nThe prince bowed.\n\n\"Step into my little apartment,\" he said.\n\nThey entered, to find themselves in a large oblong room furnished in\nSlavic luxury.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs they crossed a rich Oriental rug spread over the threshold, a\nmusical gong sounded somewhere, and almost instantly two enormous\nCossacks sprang into view, to bar their way with rifles.\n\n\"My bodyguard,\" apologized Krassnov, shutting the door. \"They are\nquite harmless, except to intruders. Just one of the little\nprecautions that make life safer.\"\n\nHe spoke to the men in Russian and they withdrew.\n\nThen he advanced to a divan beside a teakwood table on which stood a\nlarge copper samovar. Dropping down, he motioned for them to take\nseats beside him.\n\n\"You will have tea, my friends? Or perhaps you would prefer whiskey\nand soda?\"\n\nThey chose the latter, since their recent exertions seemed to have\nwarranted it, and their host tinkled a silver bell, bringing a Chinese\nboy beaming and salaaming.\n\nA few words to him and the samovar was lit; then he hurried off on\npadding feet, to return with miraculous speed, bearing not only the\nwhiskey and soda but a platter heaped with exotic cakes, cubed\nsandwiches of caviar and spiced fish, together with a profusion of\nother delicacies--doubly welcome to men who had toiled all day on a\nmountain peak, with nothing but chocolate to sustain them.\n\nAnd while they drank and ate, Prince Krassnov told his story--a story\nwhose very first words were an admission that he was the head of the\ngreat diamond-smuggling plot Stoddard had set out to trace down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a story as dramatic and romantic as it was unscrupulous.\n\nFinding himself and the crew of the rocket marooned on the upper\nslopes of this mighty mountain, in the midst of an incalculable\nwealth, he had set about at once to capitalize their astounding\ndiscovery.\n\nFirst he had made certain adjustments in the mechanism of his\napparatus--which fortunately had not been injured by its forced\nlanding--and then he had taken off with specimens of the treasure,\nbringing the craft down this time with precision in the midst of his\nancestral estates near Baku, in the foothills of the Caucasus\nMountains.\n\nThis vast property the Bolsheviks had not confiscated, partly because\nof its remoteness, no doubt, and partly because of the prince's\nservices to the Soviet Republic. At any rate, it was here he had\ndeveloped in secret the details of his amazing plot--a plot that had\nas its aim not only his own enrichment but the rehabilitation of all\nthe Russian nobles.\n\nOnce they had heard his story of the Diamond Thunderbolt and seen the\nspecimens he showed them, many had eagerly joined the plot, with the\nresult that an international ring had been formed for disposal of the\ngems.\n\nHis plans perfected, Prince Krassnov had then returned to Kinchinjunga\nwith his rocket, since when the mysterious flood of those perfect\ndiamonds into the jewel markets of the world had begun.\n\n\"So you see, my friends,\" he smiled, \"that is what you Americans would\ncall my 'little game'--a game your chance discovery has rather\njeopardized, you must admit.\"\n\nProfessor Prescott could well realize this, but at a glance from\nStoddard he declined to admit it.\n\n\"A very ingenious game!\" he said. \"But where do the Lamas figure in\nthis? Surely they must know of the presence of this meteor within\ntheir kingdom.\"\n\n\"No doubt they do,\" the prince conceded. \"This is why they are so\nreluctant to have foreigners enter their domain. At one time, I am\nsatisfied, they knew its exact location and drew many of their own\ngems from that source. But in recent times the snow people have\nguarded their secret well. The Lamas are as terrified of them as the\nnatives--and with better reason!\"\n\nHe did not mention what the reason was, but there was something\nominous in his tone.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"But to get on with my story, friends. I am not telling you all this\nmerely to satisfy your curiosity. I have what you call a motive in my\nmadness!\"\n\nMadness was right, thought Stoddard. The man was dangerously,\ncriminally mad.\n\n\"My motive is simply this,\" he went on. \"You have chanced upon my\nlittle nest-egg, and consequently I have either to let you in on the\ndeal or--\"\n\nKrassnov paused; shrugged.\n\n\"But why talk of anything unpleasant, when there is wealth enough here\nfor all? What I propose, briefly, is that you join me.\"\n\nThey knew it was coming, but they winced, nevertheless.\n\n\"Oh, don't be premature!\" he exclaimed, a little nettled. \"Hear me\nout. What is good enough for me and my fellow nobles of Imperial\nRussia is surely good enough for poor, under-paid professors of\ndemocratic America. Listen, friends--I am generous. Join me and we\nwill make millionaires out of all of you. Every professor in your\ncountry shall be a little czar. It will be, to use the old phrase, a\ntriumph of the intellect.\"\n\nBeyond a doubt, the man was mad; yet his madness was vast, dizzying.\nThough neither was tempted, they were both rendered speechless for a\nmoment. It was like standing on a mountain top and being shown the\ncountries and the glories of the world--like standing on the top of\nKinchinjunga, thought Prescott.\n\n\"But you assume we are all Bolsheviks, like yourself, we professors,\"\nhe said, struggling for calm words.\n\n\"Bolsheviks!\" snorted the prince. \"I spit on them! You think I, a\nnobleman, am interested in the masses? Cattle--swine! I plan only for\nthe day when we who are worthy rule again, and this that I have told\nyou is my plan. You can, as you Americans so coarsely say, either take\nit or leave it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA tension hung in the air, as his words echoed into silence. The man\nhad revealed himself.\n\n\"And suppose we leave it?\" asked the professor, restraining his\nirritation as best he could. \"What then?\"\n\n\"Then I am afraid--ah--unpleasant consequences would result,\" was the\nbland answer. \"Surely you realize that I could not let you and young\nDr. Stoddard rejoin your expedition with this story to report.\"\n\nThey realized it quite well.\n\n\"But suppose we agree not to report it?\" said Professor Prescott.\n\n\"Not to doubt your honesty of intention,\" replied Krassnov sharply. \"I\nwould refuse to accept such an agreement.\"\n\n\"Then I see nothing else but to decline your kind proposal,\" said\nStoddard, before the professor could formulate further words. \"What do\nyou propose to do--murder us?\"\n\n\"Nothing so personal,\" said the prince, with his sardonic smile. \"I\nshall merely turn you over to my little subjects. They no doubt will\ndeal with you as your merits warrant.\"\n\nWhereupon he pressed a button under that elaborate teakwood table. The\nmusical gong they had heard before sounded again, and the prince's two\nCossack retainers reappeared.\n\nHe addressed them briefly in Russian, adding to his guests:\n\n\"Adieu, friends! If you change your minds, you have only to speak. You\nwill be understood, and I shall be gratified.\"\n\nAnd without further words, they were led from that ornate apartment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTaken back to the dazzling chamber under the meteor, they were turned\nover to the pigmies.\n\nA powwow resulted, but it was brief. The two captives were bound fast\nin a curious ceremonial pit near the center of the room. Then the\nmidget horde withdrew, leaving them alone there under that eery glow.\n\n\"Now what the devil will be the next step?\" queried Stoddard, when the\nlast of the pigmies had gone.\n\nProfessor Prescott considered for a moment, before replying.\n\n\"I don't think there will be any next step, except our cremation,\" he\nsaid at length.\n\n\"Cremation?\" gasped his young friend. \"What do you mean, cremation?\"\n\nAnother pause, then:\n\n\"Just this. Don't you see where we are? Right under the Thunderbolt!\nWell?\"\n\n\"Well what?\"\n\n\"Simple enough, Jack.\" The professor's tone was grave. \"When dawn\ncomes, and the rising sun strikes that--\"\n\n\"Good God!\" Stoddard suddenly understood. \"Why, we'll be cooked\nalive--frizzled!\"\n\nIt was only too true. Even now, the pale rays of the moon,\nconcentrated by the myriad facets of that monumental diamond, were\nbeginning to focus on them a warmth that was uncomfortable. And by\nmorning--!\n\nThe two men crouched there silent, realizing their desperate plight.\nThey _must_ escape, before the sun rose. But how?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStudying their bonds, they discovered that they were of rawhide of\nsome sort, obviously from the hides of animals these strange people\ncaught on the lower slopes somewhere. But though they strained and\ntwisted, they could not stretch them, the leather evidently having\nbeen cured to a marvelous toughness in these high altitudes.\n\nPrecious minutes ticked by as they struggled there, but they were\nunable to extricate themselves.\n\nBut before the end of a half-hour, Stoddard managed to free one arm,\nand reaching into his jacket he drew forth a small, compact metal\nobject--his cigarette lighter.\n\nTwirling the wheel, while Professor Prescott held his breath, he\nsucceeded in kindling a flame on its tiny wick.\n\nIf only he could reach the thongs with it! If only he could burn them\nthrough and free himself and the professor before any of the pigmies\nre-entered that lethal chamber!\n\nWrenching around now, he applied the flame to his left wrist, which\nwas still bound. As the living fire touched his flesh, he winced with\npain, but almost anything was better than the grisly fate that\nthreatened.\n\nSlowly, a little at a time, he endured the torture, straining at each\napplication to see if the thongs would yield.\n\n\"Here, let me try it once!\" called out Professor Prescott, as he cried\naloud with the agony of the ordeal.\n\n\"No. I'll get it!\" Stoddard gritted his teeth, continued. \"There! I\nthink my hand is free!\" He struggled. \"Yes. Now wait!\"\n\nReplacing his cigarette lighter in his pocket, he drew his blistered\nwrist from its smouldering bonds and struggled feverishly now to undo\nthe lashes about his feet.\n\nFive minutes of that and suddenly he flung them off and stood up.\n\n\"Now! Now then, Professor. I'll have you loose in a jiffy!\"\n\nBending over his fettered companion, he worked with frantic haste to\nuntie the rawhide bonds.\n\nAnother five minutes and they were both free.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nProfessor Prescott stood up and stretched.\n\n\"Thank God for small favors!\" he exclaimed. \"But you, Jack? You must\nbe burned cruelly.\n\n\"Forget it!\" Stoddard was already wrapping a handkerchief around his\nwrist. \"Now let's see about getting out of here. These little rats all\nseem to be asleep, and Lord knows where that maniac Krassnov is.\nPerhaps we can make it. At any rate, we'll give them a run for their\nmoney!\"\n\nAs he spoke, he drew his automatic.\n\nSilently, stealthily, they left that glittering chamber and proceeded\ndown the cavern toward what seemed to be the entrance, guided by their\nremembrance of the way they had come.\n\nA hundred yards or more they made, seeing no sign of their captors,\nwhen suddenly a musical gong rang out.\n\n\"We've stepped on one of Krassnov's infernal signals!\" cried Stoddard,\nabove the din. \"Now there'll be hell to pay!\"\n\nAnd \"hell to pay\" there was, almost instantly--for before they had\ntaken ten more steps, the cavern ahead was full of small, ghostly\nfigures, jabbering in their shrill voices.\n\nIndifferent now of what he did, their lives at stake, Stoddard blazed\naway with his automatic, sweeping it from side to side of the stony\nwalls as he fired.\n\nAs the shots crashed out, the jabbers turned to shrieks of terror.\nSeveral of the pigmies fell. The rest broke their ranks and shrank\ninto the shadows.\n\n\"Run!\" yelled Stoddard, slipping a new clip into his pistol.\n\nThe professor needed no invitation. Gathering his long legs he sped\nafter the younger man, and together they burst from the mouth of the\ncavern.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOutside, in the dazzle of moonlight, they paused for an instant.\n\n\"This way!\" called Stoddard, racing toward that splintered arena.\n\nThey gained it and lunged across it to the shelving slope that reached\nupward to the narrow, perilous ridge whence they had come.\n\nAs they proceeded, the pigmy horde following with incredible\nswiftness, Stoddard wheeled and fired time and again--and now his\nshots were answered by the reports of rifles.\n\n\"Krassnov and his Cossacks!\" he muttered. \"Well, we'll give them our\nheels, unless they hit us.\"\n\n\"And Russians are notoriously bad shots, I understand,\" panted the\nprofessor.\n\nAt any rate, they reached the slope and struggled upward toward the\nridge, putting themselves presently out of range behind the jagged\nrocks that loomed on every side.\n\nBut just as they were congratulating themselves on their escape, came\na dull, reverberating explosion--and as they clung to their insecure\nfootholds, a volcano of snow and ice rose ahead. Thousands of tons of\ndebris avalanched into the chasm below.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStunned, deafened, they looked around.\n\nDown in that pocket where the Thunderbolt had so recently gleamed was\none vast chaos, and above, where that razor-back ridge had led across\nthe intervening chasms to safety, was a dazzling void.\n\nTo both came the same thought, but Stoddard expressed it first.\n\n\"Krassnov--he's dynamited the ridge!\" he gasped.\n\n\"Then we--we'll never get back now!\" echoed Professor Prescott.\n\n\"No, but they'll never get us here!\"\n\n\"Scant comfort, though, when we're pinioned here like a couple of\nbirds with their wings clipped.\"\n\n\"Right; but let's see. Let's figure. We're better off than we were.\nAnd what was it Napoleon once said: 'When you can't retreat, advance.'\nSo suppose we--\"\n\n\"But listen!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStoddard heard. It was the sound of rifle shots. And looking down, he\nsaw a feverish activity surrounding the rocket. Myriads of the pigmies\nwere swarming upon it, while a handful of Cossacks were holding them\noff.\n\n\"Something doing down there, all right!\" he muttered. \"Looks to me\nlike--why, sure I've got it! That madman has overshot himself, for\nonce! He's buried their precious meteor, in blowing up our ridge, and\nthey've turned on him!\"\n\n\"I think you're right,\" agreed Professor Prescott. \"Suppose we advance\nas you say. It looks like a chance.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Stoddard.\n\nSlowly, cautiously, they returned down the slope.\n\nWhen within a hundred yards, they knew they had sized up the situation\ncorrectly. With frantic speed, Krassnov was supervising the shoveling\nout of his rocket from amid the debris; was directing its loading,\nwhile the free members of his crew held off the enraged natives who\nwere obstructing them.\n\nDescending even more cautiously now, they neared the scene of\nactivity.\n\n\"My plan is this--to get aboard and find out where they're going!\"\nsaid Stoddard, through shut teeth. \"What do you say?\"\n\n\"Lead on!\" said the professor.\n\nSo they continued down, neared the resting-place of that strange\ncraft, and, under shelter of the moonlight shadows, stole through the\nconfused ranks surrounding it and crept aboard.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStowing themselves into the first likely niche that offered--a narrow\ncubicle behind a flight of metal stairs--they waited, scarcely daring\nto breathe for fear of being discovered.\n\nFifteen minutes passed, a half-hour, when suddenly sounded a rasping\nof doors that told them the rocket was being sealed.\n\nThen came a roar, as of some mighty blast beating down upon the frozen\nearth, followed by a lifting, rushing sensation--and they were flung\nviolently to the flooring.\n\nThe pressure ceased in a moment, however, to be supplanted by a\nbuoyant, exhilarating sense of flight. It increased, and they judged\nthey must be traveling at great speed.\n\nGlancing at the luminous dial of his watch, Professor Prescott saw\nthat it was a quarter to ten.\n\n\"Well, we're off!\" he whispered. \"And where, would you guess, are we\nheaded?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't guess,\" Stoddard whispered back. \"From the way we're\nriding, it might be Mars! We must be making hundreds of miles an\nhour.\"\n\n\"Or thousands! Who knows?\"\n\nThey crouched there in their cramped niche, scarcely even whispering\nnow, as the tense minutes passed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly the motion changed. They seemed to be dropping.\n\nAnother moment or two, and with a slight jar the rocket came to rest.\n\n\"Well, we're here, wherever it is,\" said Stoddard, stirring.\n\n\"Yes, undoubtedly,\" the professor agreed. \"And the next move?\"\n\n\"I think we'll let them make that.\"\n\nThey were not long in doing so. There came the sound of doors rasping\nopen, of footsteps echoing on metal stairs and corridors. Once a giant\nCossack passed within four feet of them. But at length, all was silent\nwithin the rocket.\n\n\"Now, then, suppose we have a look around,\" said Stoddard, stepping\nout.\n\n\"Right,\" agreed his companion, following. \"I'll admit I am mildly\ncurious to know what corner of the earth we've been transported to.\"\n\nThey proceeded down the dim-lit corridor the way they had come,\ndescended a flight of stairs and headed along another corridor--to\npause suddenly and gasp with astonishment. For through the door whence\nthey had entered the rocket poured a flood of sunshine.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStoddard stared at it a moment incredulously, and then glanced at his\nwatch.\n\n\"Ten o'clock, I make it!\" he muttered. \"Am I crazy, or what?\"\n\n\"No, I hardly think so,\" smiled Professor Prescott, recovering from\nhis own surprise. \"It is merely that we are in some part of the world\nquite a few thousand miles removed from India. Back on Kinchinjunga,\nit is still ten o'clock at night, but here, it is quite obviously\ndaytime.\"\n\n\"That must be the explanation,\" Stoddard agreed. \"But it certainly\ngave me a start at first!\"\n\nApproaching the door, followed by the professor, he peered cautiously\nout, to confront a desolate stretch of scrubby growth, hemmed in by a\nbackground of rugged mountains.\n\n\"Now where the devil would you say we are?\" he demanded, gazing around\nperplexedly.\n\n\"Either in the United States or in Mexico,\" was the astonishing\nreply.\n\n\"But how can you say that?\"\n\n\"Because it must be some place approximately twelve hours distant from\nIndia in time, to judge from the sun, which is not far past the\nmeridian.\"\n\n\"But why not Australia, for instance?\"\n\n\"Because Australia is too far. It would be three o'clock tomorrow\nmorning there, since it is ten o'clock last night now in India.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStoddard pondered this a minute, then admitted its correctness.\n\n\"All right, then. Assuming that we are somewhere on the North American\ncontinent, the next thing is to give Krassnov the slip; otherwise it\nwon't be big enough for all of us!\"\n\nAnd that Professor Prescott conceded readily enough.\n\nBut before making any further move, they looked over their\nsurroundings carefully, to satisfy themselves none of their late\ncaptors were in view.\n\n\"They're evidently somewhere on the other side of the rocket,\"\nStoddard concluded at length. \"So let's make a break for it while\nwe've got the chance.\"\n\n\"Lead the way!\" said the professor.\n\n\"O. K., here we go!\"\n\nAnd, stepping through the door, they dropped to the ground and raced\noff under the glare of the burning sun toward the rugged mountains\nthat loomed ahead.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a hundred yards or so they were able to keep the rocket between\nthemselves and the Russians but soon the ground sloped up to such an\nextent that they realized they must be in full view.\n\nDropping behind the scant shelter of a scraggly tree, they turned and\nglanced down--and there, beyond the rocket, they could now see a\ngroup of men standing around outside a small wooden shack, shouting\nand gesticulating in their direction.\n\n\"Damn it, they've seen us!\" muttered Stoddard.\n\n\"But why don't they come after us?\" queried Professor Prescott.\n\nThe answer came even as he spoke, for out of the shack rushed the tall\nfigure of the prince, in his hand a pair of binoculars which he raised\nto his eyes.\n\nWhether or not be spotted them, an instant later he turned and uttered\na command, and two huge Cossacks sprang to the pursuit.\n\n\"There's nothing to do now but run for it!\" cried Stoddard, leaping to\nhis feet.\n\nThe professor followed and they plunged on up the slope, bullets from\ntheir pursuers' pistols and the rifles of those below kicking up the\ndust around them. But either because the aim was bad or the targets\ndifficult, they escaped unscathed.\n\nAs for Stoddard, he wasted no time in firing back.\n\n\"Once we get in those mountains, we're safe!\" he gasped, as they\nstruggled on. \"How are you, Professor--all right?\"\n\n\"No holes in my skin so far!\" came the panting answer.\n\nFive desperate, dodging minutes passed.\n\nGlancing over their shoulders, they saw that the heavy, stolid\nCossacks were losing ground. And ahead, tauntingly near now, loomed a\nthickly-wooded slope that meant the beginning of big timber--and\nsafety.\n\nAnother five minutes--each second an hour--and they had gained it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut there was no pausing yet, they could hear the Cossacks crashing on\nlike determined blood-hounds behind.\n\n\"No need to climb any more!\" exclaimed Stoddard, half breathless.\n\"We'll edge along, keep in the trees, and try to throw them off.\"\n\nThe older man said nothing; merely gritted his teeth. This climb had\ntold on him more than anything he had experienced on the cruel slopes\nof Kinchinjunga.\n\nAs they struggled along now, sometimes it seemed that they had thrown\ntheir pursuers off the trail, or completely outdistanced them, but\nalways a moment later they would hear again the crunch of the\nCossacks' boots on the dry undergrowth.\n\nSo the grim flight continued, mile after heart-tearing mile, and\nStoddard was beginning to realize that the professor couldn't keep on\nmuch longer--had just about decided to stop and shoot it out with\ntheir pursuers--when suddenly there came a sound that brought new hope\nto him.\n\n\"Did you hear that?\" he gasped, pausing.\n\n\"It--sounded like--a car!\" panted his companion.\n\n\"Right. And that means there must be a road through here somewhere!\nBut where?\"\n\n\"Listen.\" Professor Prescott pointed to the left. \"The sound seems to\nbe coming from over there.\"\n\nAnd sure enough, from the left came a wheezing grind of a car making a\nheavy grade.\n\n\"Near, too,\" decided Stoddard. \"Come on--let's go! We've got to head\nit off. It's our only hope, except--\"\n\nWith relief, he shoved his automatic back into its holster and led the\nway in the direction of the now rapidly nearing car.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA hundred yards they had made, up a slight rise, when there spread\nbefore them a rutted mountain road, and on it, in full view, was a\nlaboring Ford of ancient vintage.\n\nOver the wheel hovered a lanky, leathery native, and beside him sat a\nsmall, plump woman who looked as though she might be his wife.\n\nThey were almost to the top of the hill when Stoddard hailed them.\n\n\"Say!\" he said. \"Give us a ride, will you? We're lost.\"\n\n\"Keep on, Henry!\" he heard the woman urge. \"I don't like the looks of\n'em.\"\n\nAmericans! Well, thought Stoddard, they were in the United States,\nanyway. That was something. And he didn't exactly blame the good woman\nfor her suspicions. They must look pretty wild, at that, with their\ntwo-day beards and tattered clothes.\n\n\"Sorry,\" spoke up Henry. \"Missus says no. She knows best. 'Sides, it\nain't fur to Martin's Bluff. You kin make it in an hour.\"\n\n\"But say, wait a minute!\" They were running along beside the wheezing\ncar now. \"We've got to get there in a hurry. We'll pay you.\"\n\nHenry pricked up his ears at this, but his wife shook her head.\n\n\"Keep on!\" she urged. \"They may be bandits!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhereupon Stoddard drew his automatic, for there was no more time to\nargue.\n\n\"Stop!\" he commanded. \"You'll take us, understand? I'll pay you well!\"\n\n\"See, I was right!\" screamed the woman. \"Bandits! Bandits! Oh,\nHenry--save me!\"\n\nWildly she clung to him, as Stoddard mounted the running-board, but\nbefore he could make another move, Professor Prescott gasped out:\n\n\"The Cossacks! Quick!\"\n\nAnd jumping down, he wheeled to face the two leering Russians, not\nforty feet down the road. Pistols levelled, they were advancing\nstolidly.\n\nStoddard half-raised his own weapon, then turned to see if the car was\nwithin range of the return fire it would bring. It was--but not for\nlong.\n\nWith a furious chattering of bands, as Henry gave it the gas, the\ndecrepit vehicle gained the top of the hill and disappeared from view\ndown the far slope, and the last thing he saw of it was a dusty plate\nflapping under its tail-light.\n\nIt was a Texas license!\n\nThen, turning back, he lifted his automatic; but it was too late. The\nCossacks were on them.\n\nIn answer to a guttural command, he dropped the weapon and raised his\nhands, as the professor had already done.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo hours later, they were back at the rocket.\n\nLed into the shack--which was furnished inside like an Oriental\nhunting-lodge--they were confronted at once by Prince Krassnov.\n\nThough his aristocratic features were immobile, it was obvious that he\nwas in no amiable frame of mind.\n\n\"So, my friends!\" he exclaimed. \"I leave you in India, and meet you\nagain in America, all within a matter of hours. It is but an example\nof our modern progress, is it not?\"\n\nThey made no reply.\n\n\"Ha! You are not sociable, after enjoying my hospitality, my\ntransportation? Then suppose we--as you Americans so quaintly\nsay--call a spade a spade! I gave you your chance. You declined it.\nAnd what is the result? My beautiful Diamond Thunderbolt, my\nimmeasurable treasure, is buried forever.\"\n\n\"Through no fault of ours!\" put in Stoddard.\n\n\"But buried nevertheless, and my adopted kingdom in revolt. Yet do not\nthink I mourn too much, my friends. Though the game is what you call\nup, my plans shall go on. Here and elsewhere in the world, where we\nhave sub-headquarters, are billions of dollars' worth of\ndiamonds--supplies for years ahead. We shall not suffer. But\nyou--Professor Prescott and Doctor Stoddard--I have a very interesting\nfate in store for you. How would you care to make a little scientific\nexpedition to Mars, say?\"\n\n\"Mars?\" gasped the professor.\n\n\"Yes, or Venus, or even Jupiter, not to mention the moon! Or how about\nthe sun? That would be an interesting sphere for exploration.\"\n\n\"We don't know what you're talking about,\" said Stoddard growing\nnettled. \"Why mince matters? Call a spade a spade, if you're going to!\nWhat do you propose to do with us, now that you have us in your\npower?\"\n\nThe prince paused, drew forth a long Russian cigarette from an\nexquisite platinum case.\n\n\"I propose,\" he smiled, when he had lit it, \"to turn over my rocket to\nyou, my fellow scientists, since I shall have no further use for it\nand it might be embarrassing to be found with it in my possession.\"\n\nAnd the way he proposed to turn it over to them, as they had already\nsuspected, was to lock them in it and fire it off into space.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWithin the hour, the man's diabolical plan had been put into\noperation.\n\nLed to the rocket, the luckless pair were locked within a small metal\nroom somewhere within its recesses. There sounded again the peculiar\nrasping that told them its doors were being sealed. And then came the\nroar of that mighty exhaust beating down.\n\nThere followed the lifting, rushing sensation they had experienced\nbefore, and again they were flung violently to the flooring by the\nforce of the upward impulse.\n\nWhen the pressure slacked, they staggered to their feet and groped\naround the dark, stuffy little room.\n\n\"Well, this is the end, I guess,\" sighed Professor Prescott. \"I had\nnever thought,\" with a grim attempt at humor, \"that I would meet quite\nsuch a scientific fate as this!\"\n\n\"Nor had I!\" Stoddard agreed. \"But I'm not quite ready to cash in my\nchecks yet. The game isn't over!\" He was pacing around the room,\nknocking on the metal walls with something that gave back a strident\nring. \"Have you any idea what composition this stuff is?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe professor rapped on one of the panels; felt of it.\n\n\"Aluminum, I would say.\"\n\n\"Nothing so lucky! If it were, I could cut it like cheese. But\nduralumin, probably, a very light, strong alloy; and what I have here\nis a hunting knife with a can-opener on one end! If I'm not mistaken,\nwe'll be out of this sardine box before long.\"\n\nWhereupon he applied himself to the thin metal wall of their cell,\nworking determinedly, while Professor Prescott held his cigarette\nlighter for a torch.\n\n\"You see, duralumin yields to heat, like aluminum,\" he exclaimed, as\nfinally his knife thrust through. \"Now then, let's get the can opener\nworking.\"\n\nThe progress was slow but sure. Within an hour, he had cut out a\njagged section some two feet square, through which they squeezed into\nan equally dark corridor.\n\n\"Now then!\" Stoddard's mood was exultant. \"There must be switches\naround here somewhere. There were lights, I remember, so let's find\nthem. Once we get a little light on the subject--\"\n\n\"Here!\" called the professor, who had groped down the corridor with\nthe cigarette lighter. \"How's that?\"\n\nAs he pressed a switch, a row of small bulbs glowed overhead.\n\n\"Fine!\" was the answer. \"Now let's see if we can find the engine-room,\nor whatever they call it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJubilant now, they continued on down the corridor, which ended in a\nflight of stairs.\n\n\"I fancy it must be below,\" said Professor Prescott. \"From what I have\nseen of experimental models, the propulsion impulse must originate\nfrom the base.\"\n\nSo they descended the stairs, entered another dark corridor, found\nanother switch and pressed it, and thus they proceeded, lighting the\ninterior of the rocket as they went. And as they descended, the roar\nof the exhaust increased in volume, indicating that they were nearing\nits source.\n\nPresently they entered a large, circular room with an illuminated dial\nat the far end. Drawing near, they saw a confusion of instruments that\nfor a moment left them dazed.\n\nWhile Stoddard studied them in bewilderment, Prescott circled the room\ntill he found a switch. Pressing it, he produced a brilliant flood of\nillumination.\n\n\"Now then, let me have a look at this,\" he said, returning to the\ndial. \"Professor Goddard once explained to me the workings of one of\nhis experimental models. The motive force must be some liquefied\nmixture, possibly oxygen and hydrogen. Some of these instruments--most\nof them, in fact--must be valves.\"\n\nHe touched one, turned it, and the rocket responded with a sickening\nburst of speed.\n\n\"No, that won't do! We're going plenty fast enough now!\"\n\nHe touched another, and they slacked off dizzyingly.\n\n\"Well, there are two controls, anyway. Now then, how do they steer\nthis thing? That is the next problem we must solve.\"\n\nBut though he touched this instrument and that, producing weird\neffects, their course continued in the direction set. And meanwhile,\nthey were hurtling outward through space at a rate of speed he knew\nwould presently carry them beyond the gravitational pull of the earth.\n\nThen, as he grasped and swung down a curious lever that worked in a\nquadrant, they felt a violent lunge to the left, and for a moment it\nseemed they would shoot to the ceiling.\n\n\"Good God!\" gasped Stoddard. \"What's happened?\"\n\n\"Nothing--only that I've found how to steer this wild steed!\" cried\nthe professor, exultantly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was really quite simple, he explained, as he eased up on the lever.\nIn application, it was a development of the gyroscope principle, that\na wheel revolving freely within a freely suspended frame tends to make\nthe frame revolve in the other direction.\n\n\"You see, the rocket is the freely suspended frame,\" he went on,\n\"while this lever controls a gyroscopic wheel somewhere. To set it\nspinning to the right causes us to turn to the left, and vice versa.\"\n\n\"But you almost stood us on our heads, a moment ago! How did that\nhappen?\"\n\n\"Simply because I threw the lever too far to the right. We are in\ninterstellar space, obviously, where every change of direction\ninvolves an adjustment of equilibrium.\"\n\nAnd if Stoddard didn't exactly understand, being first a secret\nservice man and only secondarily a scientist, at least he showed his\nignorance no further. If the professor could bring this astounding\nmachine back to Earth, that was all he wanted.\n\nPrescott said he could, he thought, providing they had fuel enough\nleft. So for the next few minutes, while the younger man held his\nbreath, the professor labored with the various instruments on that\ncomplicated dial.\n\n\"Now then, I think we're headed back,\" he said at length, relaxing.\n\"But we've got to have visibility, otherwise we will land with a\nvelocity of about twenty thousand miles an hour, which is what I\nfigure we're making at the present time.\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\" gasped Stoddard. \"I'll say we've got to have visibility!\nWait a minute! Let me look around!\"\n\nHe searched the room for further instruments--to find nothing that in\nany way met the purpose.\n\nBut even as he returned dejected, the professor cried out:\n\n\"Here--I've got it! Take a look at this!\"\n\nBending over a small table beside the dial, Stoddard saw mirrored, in\nits ground-glass surface a hazy circular panorama that at first had no\nsignificance. But as he continued to peer down upon the scene, certain\nfamiliar aspects loomed out. It was the Earth--and what he was looking\nat was a view of the North and South American continents!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor some moments Stoddard stared at this amazing panorama in silence;\nsaw it grow rapidly clearer, as the careening rocket plunged like a\ngiant shell toward the earth.\n\n\"My God!\" he whispered at length in awe. \"Do you think you can ever\ncheck our speed?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" the professor replied, busy over his instruments. \"But\nwhere do we want to land? How do we know what state we were in?\"\n\nWhereupon Stoddard told him of that Texas license plate.\n\n\"But we don't want to land anywhere near that fiend Krassnov,\" he\nadded, with a shudder. \"I suggest, if it's possible, that you pick out\nsome aerodrome, preferably in the western part of the state--for if I\nremember my geography, Texas isn't mountainous in the east.\"\n\n\"I will do the best I can,\" said Prescott, grimly.\n\nThere followed tense minutes as the panorama in that ground-glass\nnarrowed and grew more intense. Now they could see only North America,\nnow only the United States and a portion of Mexico, and now only\nTexas.\n\n\"Back--_back!_\" cried Stoddard, as the rugged land loomed up, spread\ninto a panorama of towns and ranches. \"We're descending too fast!\nWe're bound to crash, unless--\"\n\nBut already the professor had touched the ascending valve and swung\nthe steering lever.\n\nUp they zoomed again. Once more a portion of Mexico was visible on the\nglass, and along the international border now they could see a winding\nthread of silver.\n\n\"The Rio Grande!\" exclaimed the young geologist. \"Just follow it up\ntoward its source till we come to El Paso. There'll be a landing-field\nthere.\"\n\n\"Yes, undoubtedly.\" The professor was working in abstraction over the\nunfamiliar controls. \"Now if I can just hold us on our course....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe succeeded, and presently a white city gleamed over the curving rim\nof the horizon to the northwest, the tall chimneys of its smelters\nthrowing long shadows from the lowering sun beyond.\n\nIn a minute or two they were over it, at a height of perhaps twelve\nmiles--and now, as they began descending, its patchwork of buildings\nand plazas unfolded like some great quilt below.\n\n\"There's the field!\" cried Stoddard, pointing in the glass to a wide\nclear space on the outskirts. \"Can you make it, do you think?\"\n\n\"We'll know soon!\" was the grim answer, as Prescott worked frantically\nnow with his valves and levers. \"It's a matter of balancing off our\nflow of gases, of holding up buoyancy to the very last. A little too\nmuch, or not enough, and--\"\n\nBreathlessly, as they descended, Stoddard peered into the glass. Now a\nscene of excitement was visible below. Figures could be seen gazing\nup, waving their arms, running about this way and that.\n\n\"They must think they're getting a visit from another planet,\" said\nStoddard. \"Or that the end of the world has come!\"\n\n\"Maybe it has, for us!\" agreed the professor, gravely. \"I'm afraid\nwe're going to crash. I can't seem to--\"\n\nWhatever he was going to add was lost in a sudden, rending concussion\nthat flung them violently down, and plunged the room into darkness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStaggering to his feet a moment later, bruised and shaken, Stoddard\ngasped out:\n\n\"Professor are you there? Are you all right?\"\n\nA groan answered him, and for a moment his heart sank, but then came\nthe reassuring call:\n\n\"Yes--all right, I guess. And you?\"\n\n\"O.K. Let's get out of here, quick!\"\n\nAn ominous hissing sound beat on their ears, as they groped their way\ntoward the door. Evidently escaping gases from the deranged mechanism,\nthought Stoddard. The floor rose at an angle, indicating that the\nrocket was half over on its side.\n\nThey found the door, and struggled along the twisted corridor toward a\nflight of stairs that would lead below; found it, descended, and\ngroped along another dark corridor, seeking an exit; when suddenly,\naround a bend, daylight confronted them, and to their joy they saw\nthat one of the main doors had been burst open by the impact.\n\nApproaching it, they peered out--to be greeted by an awed group of\nofficials and mechanics from the field.\n\nAs they climbed through, dropped to the ground, the group retreated,\ntaking no chances.\n\n\"Back!\" called Professor Prescott, warning and reassuring them with a\nword. Then, turning to his companion: \"Come on, Jack--run! This thing\nis likely to explode at any moment.\"\n\nFollowing this advice, Stoddard raced from the rocket with the rest.\n\nAt a safe distance, he turned and peered back--to see it standing\nthere at a crazy angle, dust and fumes issuing from under it in a\nblast that was hollowing a deep crater to the far side.\n\nEven as they looked, the strange craft quivered, tottered, and fell\nover on its side, and the next instant was enveloped in a blinding\nsheet of flame that brought with it a dull detonation and a blast of\ndazing heat.\n\nThe party backed still farther away.\n\n\"A nasty mixture, oxygen and hydrogen,\" muttered the professor,\nfeeling of his singed eyebrows. \"We got out of there just in time,\nJack.\"\n\n\"I'll say we did!\" Stoddard agreed, with a shudder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBy now the higher officials of the field were on the scene, among them\na number of Army men.\n\nCuriosity ran high, not unmingled with indignation. Who were these\nstrange visitors? Where had they come from? What did they mean by\nendangering the lives of everyone, with their damned contraption?\n\nInquiring for the commandant, they were taken to him--Major Clark\nHendricks, U.S.A.--and Stoddard briefly outlined their astounding\nstory, producing credentials, whereupon a squadron of fast military\nplanes was assembled.\n\nFrom the way they described the mountainous region where the rocket\nhad first landed, mentioning the town Martin's Bluff, that Henry of\nthe ancient Ford had named, the major declared that it must have been\nthe Guadalupe Mountains a hundred miles to the east--and sure enough,\na government map showed such a town there.\n\nSo it was that presently the squadron lifted into the late afternoon\nskies, with Major Hendricks in the leading plane, accompanied by the\ntwo weary adventurers.\n\nSwiftly the squadron winged eastward. They reached the mountains in\nless than an hour, and circled them in search of that little wooden\nshack which Prince Krassnov and his Cossacks had made their\nrendezvous....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was like finding a needle in a haystack, and for a time Stoddard\ndespaired of success. But those rugged mountains were an open book to\nthe planes circling high overhead, and with Martin's Bluff once\nlocated, the rest was not so hard.\n\nAt last, as twilight was falling, they found the shack and brought\ntheir planes to rest near it.\n\nBut as the party approached the shack, after posting a heavy guard\nover their planes, they saw that it was deserted.\n\nThis, after all, was only what Stoddard had feared, but nevertheless\nthey forced their way inside--and there, had Major Hendricks had any\ndoubt of their story, it was dispelled.\n\nAs Stoddard had told them, it was furnished like an Oriental\nhunting-lodge, with evidences of the recent occupation of the Russians\non all sides.\n\nBut where were they? Had they got away or were they hiding somewhere?\n\nProceeding from room to room until they had searched it thoroughly,\nthe party paused baffled.\n\nBut not for long, for suddenly Stoddard discovered something that gave\nhim a clue. It was a barred door, within a closet, covered over with\nclothes and uniforms so as to be fairly well concealed. On battering\nit in, they found that it led into a passage below.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs the party entered the passage, leaving further guards above, it\nbecame obvious that what they had found was the shaft of an old mine.\n\nIt led down abruptly, for a while, then more gradually, with many\nwindings and twistings, and ending presently in another barred door.\n\nThis they in turn battered in--to be greeted suddenly by a volley of\nrifle-fire that dropped three of them in their tracks.\n\nStoddard was one of those who fell.\n\nBending over him, Professor Prescott lifted up his head.\n\n\"Jack!\" he called. \"Where are you hit? Answer me!\"\n\n\"I--it seems to be in the shoulder,\" came the weak reply. \"If you've\ngot a handkerchief--\"\n\nThe professor produced one and staunched the flow of blood as best he\ncould, working with the aid of his flashlight.\n\nMeanwhile, ahead, the crash of pistols and rifles continued to split\nthe stillness of the passage, as the attacking party pressed forward.\n\n\"There--that does it!\" gasped Stoddard, at length. \"Help me up. I'll\nbe all right.\"\n\nPrescott steadied him to his feet. They continued on.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow the firing ceased, and in a moment Major Hendricks appeared, at\nthe head of his party.\n\n\"Well, we've got them,\" he said, saluting Stoddard. \"How are you, old\nman?\"\n\n\"All right,\" was the gritted reply. \"Let's have a look at them.\"\n\nA flashlight was swept across the stolid group of Cossack prisoners,\nbut as Stoddard peered into one face after another, he realized that\nKrassnov was not among them.\n\n\"You haven't got the leader,\" he said. \"See here, you birds,\" he\naddressed the Cossacks, \"where is he, eh?\"\n\nIf they understood, they gave no indication of it, but shook their\nheads sullenly.\n\n\"Well, damn it, we'll find him!\" Stoddard wheeled and strode past\nthem. \"Give me three or four men, Major. I'll smoke out that Russian\nbear. He must be here somewhere.\"\n\nHendricks sent the main body above, with their prisoners, and gave\nhim the men he wanted, putting himself at their head.\n\n\"You'd better go on up, too, Professor,\" said Stoddard, addressing\nPrescott. \"You've risked enough, in my behalf.\"\n\nBut the older man shook his head.\n\n\"No, I'll come along, if you don't mind,\" he insisted. \"I want to see\nthe end of this thing.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was an end that came with dramatic suddenness.\n\nPausing before a barred door some fifty paces down the passage, they\nwere debating what their next move would be--when suddenly it was\nflung open.\n\n\"Come in, gentlemen,\" came a suave, ironical voice. \"Sorry my servants\nwere so uncivil.\"\n\nIn the glare of light from beyond, Stoddard and the professor saw that\nit was Prince Krassnov.\n\nHe stood there unarmed, smiling.\n\n\"Is this the fellow?\" rasped Major Hendricks, his automatic levelled.\n\n\"It is,\" said Stoddard.\n\nSlowly, cautiously, they followed the man into the room, which in\nreality was merely the end of the passage sealed off, though its walls\nwere richly panelled and it was luxuriously furnished.\n\nPausing beside a small, heavy table, he swept his hand over it,\nindicating a heap of rough diamonds that must have represented\nmillions.\n\n\"Merely a fraction of my treasure, gentlemen,\" he told them, with a\ndeprecating shrug. \"I hadn't quite finished storing away the last\nshipment, when you interrupted me.\"\n\nHe strode to one of the walls, drew out a small drawer from a built-in\ncabinet and dumped its glittering contents on the table with the rest.\n\nAll around the room, Stoddard noted as he stood there swaying, were\nother cabinets dotted with the knobs of similar drawers.\n\n\"And this, gentlemen, is but my American sub-headquarters,\" the\nPrince went on. \"In Siberia, in Brazil--but why bore you with the\nmultiplication of my now useless wealth? Tell me, instead, my good\nfriends--Professor Prescott, Doctor Stoddard--how come you back here,\nafter I saw you safely on your way earlier in the afternoon?\"\n\n\"Because I happen to have a knack with can-openers, and my colleague\nis rather adept with machinery,\" Stoddard told him, \"while Major\nHendricks here is quite a hand with geography, not to mention\naviation.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA question or two, which they answered briefly, and Krassnov had the\nstory.\n\n\"Ah, my poor rocket!\" he sighed. \"But it is fate, I suppose; Kismet,\nas the Turkish say. Still, I deserved a better fate than to be\ncaptured by a pair of American professors, when the secret service of\nthe world was on my trail.\"\n\n\"Then cheer up!\" said Stoddard, gritting his teeth to keep back the\npain of his throbbing shoulder. \"For I have the honor to represent\nWashington in this case.\"\n\nAt that, the prince scowled darkly for a moment. Then he brightened.\n\n\"Kismet again! I might have acted differently, had I known that,\nbut--well, I drink to your success, Doctor Stoddard!\"\n\nWhereupon, before they could restrain him, he lifted a vial from a\nshelf over one of the cabinets and downed its contents.\n\n\"A diamond-dust cocktail!\" he smiled, replacing the vial. \"The most\nexpensive, even in your country of costly drinks--and the most\ndeadly!\"\n\nBut Stoddard knew, as the doomed nobleman stood there facing them in\nstoic triumph, that diamond dust in the human system was as slow as it\nwas deadly, and that the desperate gesture had been futile, so far as\njustice was concerned.\n\nThere would be ample time, in the weeks Prince Krassnov of Imperial\nRussia still lived, to round up his international allies and stamp out\nthe remnants of their amazing ring of diamond smugglers.\n\nWhile as for Professor Prescott, he was thinking with what amazement\nthe members of his expedition back on Kinchinjunga would receive the\ncablegram he would dispatch that night, informing them that Stoddard\nand himself were safe in El Paso, Texas.\n\n\n\n\nThe Slave Ship From Space\n\n_By A. R. Holmes_\n\n[Illustration: \"_The slaves!\" gasped Jim, and involuntarily backed\ninto the room._]\n\n[Sidenote: Three kidnapped Earthlings show Xantra of the Tillas how\n\"docile\" Earth slaves can be.]\n\n\nTwice that night the two young men had seen the thing, and their hour\nfor turning in had long since passed as they lay half reclining on the\nground by their campfire waiting, hoping that it would return once\nmore. Their interest in the strange visitant had completely banished\nall sensations of fatigue from a full day of vacation fishing in the\ncold Adirondack streams among which they were camping for that month.\n\nThey had discussed the appearance until there was nothing more they\ncould say; and now as for the last hour, they watched in silence, only\nmoving to knock the dottle from their pipes and to get fresh lights\noff the splinters they stuck into their slumbering fire. The velvet\nnight was now at full reign, and the myriad stars in their familiar\npatterns leaned close--brilliant jewels for man to share but never\npluck.\n\nJim Wilson had seen the thing first--a pinpoint of cherry red that\nmoved upward in a perfect arc against the brilliant white\nconstellations of the east. As it rose, it grew perceptibly larger, to\ndwindle again as it arced over the western horizon.\n\nNearly an hour later it had appeared again; but this time, when\nhalfway up the skies, it had changed its direction until it was\nheading directly over the spot where the two thrilled campers were\nwatching; and as it approached they saw its color fade slowly until it\nhad disappeared completely from sight among the inky patches between\nthe stars overhead. For minutes the two were not able to locate\nit--until Jim, once again, had pointed to a faint red spot that grew\nin color and intensity as it drew away from the zenith. Once again it\nhad disappeared over the rim of the western world--and from then on\nthere was no thought of sleep in the minds of Jim Wilson and Clee\nPartridge. They were watching the skies, hoping it would return.\n\n\"What was the thing?\" Jim Wilson exclaimed suddenly with exasperation.\n\"I've been racking my brain, Clee, but nothing I can think of makes\nsense. It couldn't have been a plane, and it couldn't have been a\nmeteor. And if it was a fire-fly--well, then I'm one too.\" He paused,\nand looked at the other. \"Any new suggestions?\" he asked.\n\n\"Me--I still think it was a space ship from Mars or Venus,\" Clee\nPartridge answered drily; \"searching for a couple of good Earth-men\nto help 'em out of some jam. You noticed the way it disappeared for a\nmoment when it was overhead: it was looking us over.\"\n\n\"Then it'll be back,\" answered Jim, not to be outdone, \"for it's not\napt to find anyone better qualified. I, myself, would kinda like to\ntake a joy-ride out through the Great Dipper.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClee smiled and looked down at the luminous dial of his wrist watch.\nThe two resumed their vigil, and there was quietness between them. For\nsome time they lost themselves in the sparkling glory of the\nfirmament, hardly moving, except to pull closer the collars of their\nflannel shirts against the increasing coldness of the mountain air.\n\nAnd then for the third time that night the mysterious sky traveler\nsprang over the trees on the eastern horizon. Suddenly it appeared;\nboth men saw it at once; and this time it made a clear, beautiful arc\nstraight for the zenith. As it raised, it grew in size, a beautiful,\ndelicate cherry star spanning the whole welkin. The two men got to\ntheir knees and watched it, breathless with fascination.\n\n\"Look!\" cried Jim suddenly.\n\nAs had happened on its second appearance, the thing began to slow up\nand its color gradually faded as it drew directly overhead. By the\ntime it should have reached the zenith it could no longer be seen. It\nhad dissolved against the inky spaces above.\n\n\"It should come into view again in a moment,\" Clee said; \"a little\nfarther on, like the other time.\"\n\nThey watched, thrilled by the mystery of the midnight phenomenon.\nMinutes passed, but still it did not appear. Clee grew restive, and as\nhis eyes chanced on his wrist watch he started violently and held out\nhis arm for Jim to see. The radium-painted hands and dial were\nglowing with unusual brilliance.\n\nLooking quickly into the skies again, Clee sensed something wrong;\nsomething different. For a moment he could not figure out what--and\nthen it came to him. One of the great stars, one that he had been\nwatching in its climb up the sky through the night, had disappeared!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe got excitedly to his feet, grabbed his companion's arm and pointed\nout this strange thing--and as he pointed another star blinked out and\ndid not reappear.\n\n\"Something's happening up there,\" Jim said soberly. \"I don't know\nwhat; but I, for one, don't feel quite comfortable.\"\n\nHe kept peering at the place pointed out, at a spot of black even\ndarker than the inky sky; or did he only imagine it was darker? he\nasked himself. Soon the spot enlarged; became a distinct patch; then,\ngrowing still, obliterated one star after another around its borders.\nIt made a pure circle; and before long the starlight glinting off its\nsides showed it to be a great, tinted sphere.\n\nSwiftly it dropped down on the two men, and they watched it\nhypnotized, incapable of moving. It was only a hundred yards overhead\nwhen some presence of mind returned to Clee.\n\n\"Run, Jim!\" he yelled, moving away. \"It's coming straight down!\"\n\nWilson came out of his daze and the two sprinted wildly for the path\nthat led down the spur on which their camp was located. They had not\nmade more than fifty yards when they heard a dull thud, and, turning,\nsaw the great sphere resting on the ground with a slight rocking\nmotion that quickly ceased.\n\nA gully cut into the trail ahead, and when they reached it Clee\ngrabbed his partner's arm and pulled him off to one side, where,\npanting with their sudden exertion, they wormed up to the brow and\npeeped over at their strange visitor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sphere stood in the starlight on the very spot they had been\noccupying when they first saw it. Right in their campfire it lay--a\ngreat, dark-red crystal shape perhaps fifty feet in diameter, whose\nsurface sparkled with innumerable facets. It rested quietly on the\nground, as if oblivious of the two routed men breathlessly watching it\nfrom a short distance. No ports or variations of any kind were visible\nto mar its star-reflecting sides.\n\n\"It must be some new kind of dirigible!\" murmured Jim; \"but why did it\ngo and pick on us for its midnight call!\"\n\n\"It's a space ship from Mars,\" answered Clee with a serious face.\n\"They heard you, and're coming to take you for your ride. See?\" he\nadded quickly, pointing.\n\nA large door was opening in the side of the sphere, and the\nillumination within threw a bright beam of amber-colored light in\ntheir direction. A metallic ramp slid out and angled down to the\nground.\n\nBreathlessly the two men waited to see who would emerge, but a long\ntime went by without their catching the slightest sign of life within.\nThe face of Clee's wrist watch was fluorescing brilliantly now, and\nmoment by moment the weird glow was increasing. Jim stirred nervously.\n\n\"I don't mind telling you, I'm scared,\" he said.\n\n\"Aw, they won't make you walk back,\" consoled Clee; but he was scared\nhimself. Why didn't something happen? Why didn't someone come out of\nthe ship?\n\nJim thought he heard a noise, and touched Clee on the shoulder,\npointing to a place on the trail down which they had come a few\nminutes before. Clee looked, and as he did so the hair on the back of\nhis neck stood up. For the bushes along the side of the path were\nmoving as if they were being brushed aside by someone in\npassing--someone making a straight line to the spot where they lay\nconcealed. And no one was there!\n\n\"Can they be invisible?\" breathed Jim, every pore in his body\nprickling.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment the two men could hardly breathe, so great was their\nunnamed fear. During that time no other movements could be noted. Then\nClee suddenly pointed to a bush only five yards away. Half a dozen\nleaf-tipped branches were bending slowly in their direction--and then\na sharp crack, as of a broken twig, came to them from the same spot.\n\nPanic, blind and unreasoning, swept them. \"Run!\" gasped Jim; and\ntogether, instinctively, they turned and scrambled down the side of\nthe ridge to get away, anywhere, far from the approaching menace of\nthey knew not what. Reckless of possible injury, they slid and\nstumbled down the brush-covered slope--and right behind them came\nsudden crashing sounds of pursuit.\n\nNew fears lent wings to their flight, but the sounds behind continued\ninexorably at their heels no matter how fast they ran or how lucky\nthey were in making past obstacles. Their pursuer was as fast as they.\nThey had no idea who--or what--it might be, for in the brief glances\nthey snatched over their shoulders they could not see anything at all!\n\nThe going was bad, and the two campers had not gone more than a\nquarter-mile when they were breathing hard, and felt that they could\nnot make one more step without collapsing on the ground to give their\nlaboring lungs a chance to catch up. Panting like dogs they dragged\nthemselves along through pine and birch trees, around large rocks and\nover briar-covered hills, only a few steps ahead of their pursuer.\n\nThen Partridge, a little in the lead as they made their way up a steep\nslope, heard Jim suddenly go sprawling; heard him gasp:\n\n\"It's got me!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTurning, he saw his partner rolling and threshing violently on the\nground, and now and then lashing out at the empty air with his fists.\nWithout a moment's hesitation he jumped from his position\nabove--jumped square and hard into the space which Jim's invisible\nassailant should be occupying. With a great thud he crashed into some\nunseen body in the air, and went down, the breath knocked out of him.\nAs he got to his knees an odor like that of cloves came to his\nnostrils, and something caught him around the neck and began\nconstricting. Frantically he tried to tear himself loose, but the\nharder he struggled the more strangling became the grip on his neck;\nand at last, faint from the growing odor and the lack of air, his\nefforts dwindled into a spasmodic tightening and relaxing of the\nmuscles.\n\nThen, for a moment, the hold on his neck must have loosened, for he\nfound himself able to breathe a little. Turning, he saw Jim at his\nside, apparently similarly held.\n\n\"If I could only--see it!\" Clee managed to get out. Jim's spasmodic,\nbitter answer came a moment later.\n\n\"Being invisible--tremendous advantage!\" he gasped.\n\nIn desperation the two men again began to fight against the clutches\nthat were holding them, and this time the grip about their necks\nunexpectedly loosened--to bring to their noses the odor of cloves\noverpowering in strength. And that was all they knew before they\nlapsed into a black and bottomless void....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThrough the lifting haze of returning consciousness Clee felt a\ncommand to get up. As he automatically complied he saw that Jim was\ndoing likewise. Once on his feet he felt another impulse to go to the\ncherry-crystal sphere, visible in the distance; but his legs were\nweak, and neither he nor Jim could walk very well until out of the\nnothingness around them came something of invisible bulk to lend them\nsupport.\n\nSlowly, carefully, straight for the waiting globe the two men were\nconducted; and in his state of half-consciousness Clee wondered at the\nimpotence of his will to make his body offer resistance. They passed\nright by their tent and up the ramp to the inside of the strange\nsphere.\n\nClee's impressions were blurred and dull, but he noticed that they\nwere in a small room brilliant with amber light, on one wall of which\nthere was a circular area which contained a dozen or more instruments\nand levers and wheels. As his eyes rested on them, one of the levers\nmoved, seemingly of itself, and the ramp came sliding into the ship\nand the thick door slowly swung closed. Then they were conducted along\na short, narrow passageway into which opened, on the right, a small\ndim room; and there the grip about their bodies loosened and they\nslumped to the floor. The door whereby they had entered, closed.\n\nA faint vibration became noticeable; they suddenly felt very heavy;\nand to the accompaniment of a low but rising hum they saw one wall of\ntheir room begin to glow with a beautiful cherry color. Although they\nhad been too stupefied to try to speak, this spurred their tired\nbodies, and they dragged themselves over to it. They found the wall to\nbe of some kind of hard crystal; it was the outer shell of the sphere;\nand it now gleamed redly transparent.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFar out and down the men saw a great convex surface on which lay\nnarrow ribbons of silver, winding veinlike through dark areas that\nwere in some places lit by little clusters of twinkling lights. As\nthey watched, the distances on the surface shrank in on themselves;\nthey could see the outline of a great circle. The sight stimulated the\nexhausted men. In a hushed and awestruck voice, Jim Wilson broke the\nsilence.\n\n\"We've been kidnaped,\" he said. \"Being taken God knows where, out\namong the stars....\"\n\nHe was getting the sky-ride he had asked for.\n\nClee smiled faintly, and was going to remind him of this; but he was\ntoo tired to make the effort. He only looked at the tremendous scene\nbelow: at the Earth they knew so well, with its familiar streets,\ncomfortable fireplaces, the faces of those they loved and those others\nwho were their friends....\n\nThe Earth soon became a ball--a globe such as he had used at school,\nshowing clearly the outline of the continents and oceans. And little\nby little it dwindled, until it was only a ghostly shape far out in\nnothingness....\n\nA little later, had the two Earthlings not been deep in sleep, they\nmight have seen enter a strange-looking man clad in odd garments--a\nman whose great, bulging head was quite bald, and whose wrinkled,\nleprous-white face wore an expression of unutterable wisdom and\nmajesty. In his hands he carried a strange piece of apparatus which he\nheld to Jim's wrist while it emitted a coarse vibratory hum that\nwhined slowly up in pitch until it passed the range of hearing. He did\nthe same thing to Clee, and then he quietly left.\n\nBut the two Earthlings knew nothing of this. Limp on the floor,\noblivious to everything, they slept....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome hours later found the kidnapped men well recovered and sitting on\nthe floor of their cell talking over their situation. As usual, Wilson\nwas thinking out loud.\n\n\"What can they be?--or who?\" he asked, frowning with his thought.\n\"They can't be from Earth, for no one there could invent such a ship\nas this and keep it a secret; and even if someone had, he could never\nhave done the equally astounding thing of inventing a way to render\nliving bodies invisible. I doubt if the thing that caught us was\nhuman, by what I was able to feel in my short struggle with it. There\nwas something that might have been a hand; but the strength and the\nweight of its body was enormous!\"\n\n\"Well, we'll probably soon see,\" commented Clee with philosophic\nresignation and pulling out of a hip pocket a package of tobacco and\nhis corn-cob pipe. \"Or, rather, we may soon know. Our captors may keep\nthemselves invisible; and of course it's barely possible that it's\ntheir natural state to be invisible, so that we may never hope to see\nthem. What I'm chiefly afraid of, is that they are from some other\nplanet, and that that's where we are being taken--though heaven knows\nwhat any creatures so infinitely far ahead of us Earthlings\nscientifically could want with a pair of young Earth lawyers!\"\n\nHe offered the package to Jim. \"Here, have a smoke; you'll feel\nbetter,\" he said. \"While there's tobacco there's hope.\"\n\n\"At least they don't seem disposed to kill us right off,\" returned\nJim, handing back the tobacco after lighting his own pipe. \"Later--if\nthere's to _be_ any 'later' for us--we may be able to find a way to\nget out of this room; though how we'd run the ship, to get back home,\nis another hard brick wall.... Maybe the controls are invisible, too!\"\nhe suggested with a wry grin. \"Ever take any pre-law courses on how\nto work the invisible controls of a space ship?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClee's reply was spoken low, and was entirely irrelevant.\n\n\"That's funny,\" he said.\n\nHe was looking at the face of the watch on his left wrist. For the\nfirst time since they had been abducted, its abnormal brightness had\nleft it.\n\nAs Jim watched, inquiringly, Clee moved his right hand a little, and\nonce more the dial leaped out through the dimness with unnatural\nbrilliance. Jim saw that his friend was holding in this hand the\npackage of tobacco. Clee repeated the demonstration.\n\n\"The dial glows with unusual brightness always--except when I hold the\npackage of tobacco in front of it at this spot,\" he said wonderingly,\nhalf to himself. \"If I remember my science right, ultra-violet light\nwould make the radium on the dial glow; and the lead in the tin-foil\nof the tobacco wrapping would screen it off. Let's see--\"\n\nHe crossed to the other side of the room and held his watch and the\npackage of tobacco in various positions until he again found one line\nalong which the watch-dial gave off only its customary light.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"--exactly in the extended line made by my watch and\nthis package of tobacco is the source of the ray which makes the\nwatch-dial glow. It's probably the control room of this ship.\"\n\n\"An extraordinary deduction, my dear Sherlock,\" commented Wilson\ndrily; \"and valuable. I wish you'd now take a moment and deduce the\nreason for the mysterious appearance of the lumps on the back of our\nnecks. I know I didn't have mine before I was taken for this\nsky-ride.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he spoke, his hand sought the back of his neck where there was a\nfat lump about the size of a quarter--a lump not painful, for all its\nnewness and size. Hard pushing with probing fingers had revealed\nsomething that seemed to be hard and flat, buried within; but close\nexaminations failed to show any wound or scar, and the men had no\nnotion what the lumps might be. Clee's was just like Jim's.\n\nBut Clee did not respond to his friend's invitation. A heavy mood had\ncome over him; he was standing by the outer wall, looking out. Jim\nwent and stood beside him, his hand on his shoulder, and together they\ngazed through the cherry-crystal wall of their prison ship out on the\nloneliness of the immeasurable miles outside. For them, space was red,\ninstead of the deep black they knew they would see through colorless\nglass. Brilliant pinpoints of light, millions of them, in all sizes,\nmade up the infinite space that was the background of their adventure.\n\nTo which one--near which one were they going? Would they ever return\nto their Earth again? Would their friends ever know of the incredible\nadventure that had overtaken them?--or would they, after the few weeks\nof searching and inquiry that must follow their disappearance, at last\nconclude that some nameless mountain disaster had made them victims,\nand give them up for dead? No doubt. And month after succeeding month\ntheir memory would fade from the minds of those who had loved them,\nwhile they would be--where?...\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA peculiar, dynamic thought came simultaneously into the minds of the\ntwo men. It was not a word: it seemed more like a feeling; but its\nunquestionable import was \"Come.\" Together they rose, and looked at\neach other wonderingly. Again came the feeling. They started for the\ndoor.\n\n\"But that's foolish!\" Jim said aloud, as if objecting to his own\nthought. \"The door's locked! We tried it!\" He looked at Partridge, who\nreturned his gaze blankly--and then, in spite of what he had said, he\nreached out and turned the latch.\n\nThe door swung open!\n\nExpressions of surprise died on the men's lips as again came the\ncompelling urge to go to some unknown destination.\n\n\"Suggestion!\" said Clee, as he passed through the doorway. \"Someone's\nsuggesting--telepathically willing--that we come to him! And I--God\nhelp me--I can't resist!\"\n\nHis neck corded with veins and muscles with his effort to restrain his\nbody from obeying the mysterious command that was drawing it onward.\nWilson, one arm outstretched in a repelling gesture, his legs stiff\nand tight, was also trying to resist. But the will that had sounded\nwithin them was stronger than theirs, and slowly, inevitably, they\nwere drawn down the passage.\n\nTheir carpeted way took them back to the entrance chamber and then up\na steeply sloping corridor that led upward to the left. As they passed\nalong they saw that the hand of a master had made on the walls, in\npanel effect, marvelously complicated decorations in many-colored\nmosaic. No man of Earth could ever have done such work, the two men\nrealized--and this thought did not cheer them any.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt the top of their curving passage a doorway led them into a spacious\nroom hung with soft, finely woven tapestries with a metallic lustre\nand furnished with deep-napped rugs and luxurious chairs and divans.\nThrough this room the intangible threads of the alien will directed\nthem--on into a wide-vaulted alcove about one-third its size. There,\nthe strange clutch on them relaxed, and they looked about, at first\napprehensively, then with growing boldness and curiosity.\n\n\"This is the control room!\" exclaimed Clee suddenly; and after a\nmoment Jim agreed with him. It was the simplicity of the controls\nwhich had prevented them from recognizing it at first. Against the\nleft wall was a great table with a tilted top, bearing, in its center,\na raised and hooded eyepiece giving a view into a large, enclosed\nblack box. On each side were several rows of small, shiny, metallic\nlevers and what they took to be instrument dials--round, cup-shaped\ndepressions with pointers free to move across dials lined with\ndisorderly and meaningless convolutions. For the full length of the\nmiddle wall, straight ahead, was a broad table of some jet-black\npolished material, and on it was a large array of instruments and\napparatus, all unfamiliar to them. Against the draperies of the wall\nto their right was one large cushioned chair, simple and beautiful in\nits lines.\n\nNo living person or thing could be discerned in either the main room\nor the alcove.\n\nFor several minutes the two men walked all about, examining everything\nthey saw with curiosity and interest; and then Clee discovered a\npeculiar thing. His watch-dial, glowing very brightly now, would\nperceptibly increase in brilliance every time he neared the great\nchair. With sudden inspiration he took out his package of tobacco and\nheld it in the line his watch made with the chair--and he found that\nhis watch stopped glowing. He tried it again from another angle, and\nthe result was the same. From that chair came the electrical\ndisturbance that was making his watch-dial glow--yet nowhere near the\nchair was any bit of electrical apparatus to be seen.\n\nWhat he did see in the chair, though, almost caused his heart to stop\nbeating. The cushions of the seat, compressed before, began to puff\nout to full volume, as if someone had just risen from them. And then,\nfaintly but sharply outlined in the long-napped rug in front, appeared\nthe print of a human shoe!\n\n\"A man!\" breathed Clee. \"A human being!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe two men stood frozen in their tracks. Clee's arm, with the package\nof tobacco in his hand, was still outstretched toward the great chair,\nbut now the dial of his watch was glowing brightly again. Something\nwithin caused him in spite of his terror to move the package between\nthe watch and the space above the footprint on the rug. The glowing\nstopped. The man--devil--whatever it was that made the print--was the\nsource of the strange excitation!\n\nThis took but a second--the interval before another shoe-print formed\nin the rug in their direction. Jim gasped something unintelligible and\nstarted to back away; but no sooner did Partridge start to follow\nsuit, than a compulsion to stand still came over them. Caught where\nthey were, unable to move, they saw the shoe-prints come towards them.\nSlowly, step by step, twelve inches apart, they came, and did not stop\nuntil they were only four or five feet away.\n\n\"We'll jump him, if we get the chance!\" hissed Jim, never taking his\neyes off the prints.\n\n\"Yes,\" came the answer; but Clee's further words were cut off in the\nmaking by an added compulsion to keep quiet. Were their words\nunderstood? The two men were locked, speechless, where they stood. And\nby some creature with a human footprint whom they could not see!\n\nThe touch of firm flesh came out of the nothingness of space about\nthem, to poke and pry all over their bodies. Anger began to take the\nplace of their fear, as, for some time, impotent of resistance, they\nhad to submit to the examination given them. They were prodded and\nfelt like dogs at a show; their breathing and heart action were\ncarefully listened to; their mouths were opened and their teeth\ninspected as if they were horses offered for sale. Both men were\ninwardly fuming.\n\n\"Dogs!\" shouted Clee in his thoughts. \"Treating us like dogs, to see\nhow healthy we are! Does he want us for slaves?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last the examination came to a stop, and they saw the shoe-prints\nin the rug go over to the black table and remain there, heels toward\nthem, while various pieces of apparatus were invisibly moved across\nthe table top. For a moment the compelling will did not seem, to Clee,\nto be constraining him as much is it had, and he began to wonder if he\nmight not have a little control over his body again. Tentatively he\ntried to break through the oppressing blanket of foreign will; his\narms and legs moved a little; he succeeded! He caught Jim's eye and\nshowed him. He thrilled all over at his discovery, and his will to\nmove measurably increased with his growing confidence that he could.\n\nThe toes of the prints were still turned away. He was going to try and\nget the man or monster who was making them.\n\nHe gestured to Jim, and with a great effort took a step in the\ninvisible man's direction. A thrill of gladness helped him on--for Jim\nwas following suit!\n\nAgain and again, with greatest mental effort, they made steps toward\nthe footprints, which, remaining side by side and motionless, gave\nthem increasing hope of stealing up unobserved. When they were only\nthree feet away Clee motioned to Jim, and with a tremendous effort of\nwill they jumped at the space where their enemy should be.\n\nThey hit him hard, and bore him heavily to the floor. By the feel, he\nwas a man such as they! Clee's blood leaped with the lust for\nrevenge, and blanking his mind against strong urges to cease his\nattack he rained savage blows at the place he was holding.\n\nBut almost at once they had evidence that their opponent was not such\na man as they. A terrific pain stabbed suddenly through them, and they\ndoubled up on the floor, writhing in agony. It was as if every nerve\nin their bodies had turned into white-hot wire, and was searing\nthrough their flesh. Again and again came the terrible stabs of\npain--and their source seemed to be the mysterious lumps at the back\nof their necks!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last they ceased coming, and Jim and Clee stretched out on the\nfloor all but unconscious from the terrific shocks of fiery agony.\nThey were completely helpless; further thoughts of resistance were\nunthinkable. But they were not left lying long. There came a\ntelepathic compulsion to stand up; and they found themselves obeying,\nin spite of the shrieking protest of their every nerve.\n\nTwitching, stumbling, they were made to do servile things--to kneel on\nthe floor; get up again; turn round and round; bow low, then stretch\nbackwards. And out of the air around them came shocking blows which\nlanded on their faces, necks and chests; feet which kicked out at\ntheir shins; and they had to stand there and take it, helpless to\nresist.\n\nThen Clee, as the nearer of the two men, was pushed over to the\nwork-table, where an oval head-piece of finely-woven wire was fitted\nover his head. Another very large one, standing next to it, and\nconnected to it by wires which led to a small instrument panel nearby,\nlifted into the air until it must have settled about the head of their\npersecutor. A dial on the panel turned slowly. And gradually the\nhelmet resting in the air dissolved into nothingness before their\neyes.\n\nA slight nausea swept over Clee as it did so, and in the midst of it\nhe felt a series of sharp, staccato thoughts--thoughts which did not\nseem to be composed of words, and yet were clear and intelligible.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Fool of a fool!\" crackled in his brain with almost a physical effort,\n\"do you think to resist Xantra? Do you think with your sub-human minds\nto overcome one of the Tillas, Masters of the Universe? Close you were\nto death--and death indeed would have come had I not other plans for\nyou.\n\n\"Know that henceforth you and your companion are my slaves. You will\njump at my slightest will; serve me as best you can with such\nintelligence as you may possess. For faithful, willing service you\nshall have food and clothing and a portion of leisure. Disobedience\nand tardiness will bring you the pain you have already tasted; revolt,\nor the attempt to escape--death; but only after torture such as you\nhave never known.\n\n\"I shall never repeat this mode of communication: it is as physically\nnauseating to me as to you. And you may never expect to see me, though\nI can always see you. By vibrational means I have given you the\nuniversal atomic rhythm of all Tillian slaves; and, although in that\nstate your fellow-slaves will be visible to you, I, your master, will\nnot!\n\n\"You will now return to your place of confinement. After you have\nrecovered you will be taken in hand by your fellow-slaves and shown\nyour duties. And if your instinct for self-preservation is only\none-tenth normal, you will never again be such a stupid sub-animal\nfool as to attempt to resist Xantra--to fly in the face of the\ninevitable!\"\n\nThe sharp, staccato voice in Clee's brain stopped; his nausea began\nto leave him; his helmet was removed; and had he been looking he might\nhave seen the other one slowly materialize on the table. The ordeal\nwas over just in time, for the last remnants of his strength was\ngiving out--as was Jim's. The two Earth-men slumped down, and would\nhave fallen but for the telepathic will, stronger than theirs, that\nforced them erect again. There came a very strong compulsion to return\nto their cell, and bruised, stumbling, their nerves still afire from\ntheir strange stabbing pains, they made their way back.\n\nThey fell to the floor and passed into unconsciousness--beaten,\nsubdued. Slaves....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a long blank interval a distinct thought crossed Clee's mind. He\nwas in heaven, and an angel voice had spoken. There it was again! Cool\nhands were stroking his wrists and forehead. He opened his eyes and\nlooked, but seeing no one closed them again.\n\nThe Voice returned, and two of the words which kept repeating were\nsomehow familiar. \"So sorry ... so sorry....\" The Voice was low and\ncool and feminine. And someone was bathing his battered head.... He\nrolled over and got up on one elbow. He still could see no one.\n\nThe Voice said: \"Oh, I'm so glad you're better! I thought you'd never\ncome to!\"\n\nMechanically Clee asked: \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Vivian Gray,\" came the quick answer; \"from Boston. And you?\"\n\nClee did not answer, but started to lie back again. Things were all\nwrong: he couldn't even see anyone. He'd go back to sleep, and wake up\nsome other time. But the Voice wouldn't let him.\n\n\"Oh, you must listen!\" it said. \"I haven't much time!\"\n\n\"Where are you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Why--right here!\" came the surprised answer. \"Can't you see me?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Clee, still not himself. He added categorically: \"I can\nsee Jim. I can see the door. I can see my hands, but I can't see you.\"\n\n\"Oh, then it must be true! Xantra _told_ me he was going to make you\none of his common slaves; but I hoped--I hoped--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis didn't mean much to Clee; but with the words came memory of all\nthat had happened, and with sudden concern he crept over to where Jim\nwas lying, to see how he was. He found him blinking and stirring,\naroused by the voices. Quickly he explained the invisible presence to\nhim, warning him to be on guard.\n\n\"Oh, but I'm a friend--Vivian Gray--kidnapped from Earth just like\nyou!\" came quick explanation out of the air. \"Xantra stole me from\nCape Cod, where I was vacationing, about the time he took you. Xantra\nis the one whose space ship we are on. He looks much like a man; he is\nsome kind of a man; but he's not from Earth--\"\n\n\"You've _seen_ him?\" interrupted Clee, beginning to believe the Voice\na little.\n\n\"Yes,\" came the instant response; \"not when he abducted me--he had\nmade himself invisible for that--but always after. Haven't you yet?\"\nAnd then, without waiting for his answer, she gave it herself. \"But of\ncourse you couldn't see him if he's already given you the universal\natomic rhythm the slaves have. You'd then be able to see only each\nother, and the other slaves; not Xantra and not me.\n\n\"I think he makes his slaves that way for protection,\" she explained.\n\"They can't very well plot or rebel against him when they can't even\nsee him, and never know but what he's around.\"\n\n\"Who are these slaves you keep mentioning?\" Jim broke in. \"How many\nof them are there on this ship: and how many like Xantra?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Xantra is the only one of his kind,\" came the answer. \"The slaves are\na race of inferior people found on his planet--wherever that is: I\ncouldn't understand, from his explanation, just where. They are\ncreatures much like ugly human beings with a touch of the ape, and are\nentirely bald, very strong and not very intelligent. There're seven or\neight on board. Normally they are good-natured: but sometimes when\nthey have a hard master, like Xantra, they take to hating him; and\nwhen they do that they can be very fierce and treacherous. That's the\nmain reason for Xantra's stopping at Earth: to see what kind of slaves\nwe humans will make. He is hoping that we will be more intelligent\nthan those he has--and more docile, and safer to have around.\"\n\n\"Well,\" snorted Jim belligerently, \"if Mr. Xantra thinks that I'm\ngoing to be safe to have around, he's a lot dumber than _I_ am!\"\n\n\"Oh, it's good to hear you talk that way,\" the girl's voice went on.\n\"We three have got to stick together, and find some way to escape!\n\n\"I've so much to say!\" she went on; \"but I daren't stay long, for fear\nof getting caught. What you said is where my chief hope lies: Xantra\ndoesn't realize how intelligent we are, and how dangerous; and we\nmustn't let him know! I think he believes we are much like his present\nslaves: he gets away with murder with them. You've noticed the lumps\non the back of your necks? Well, they have them, too; it's something\nthat's attached to the spinal cord and gives him telepathic control\nover them; also the power to hurt them dreadfully--as you've\nunfortunately found out. His slaves don't understand these lumps; they\ndon't seem to know that he would lose control if they could only in\nsome way get rid of the things in their necks!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor the first time since the girl started talking, Clee spoke. His\nvoice was low and grave, and there was a tinge of suspicion in it.\n\n\"Just how does it happen,\" he asked, \"that you know so much about\nthings here?\"\n\nThe girl's voice broke as she gave her answer.\n\n\"I'm ashamed to tell you,\" she said. \"Xantra--he--he admires me as a\nhealthy animal; one close, in species, to himself. He thinks by being\nnice to me that he might be able to make me a willing companion to\nshare his trip!\" For a moment the girl was silent; and when she spoke\nagain there was a hard note in her voice.\n\n\"I let him have hopes,\" she said, \"--deliberately. I planned to make\nhim trust me, and give me the run of the ship, so I could find out all\nI could. So far--before you came--I saw no slightest hope of ever\nescaping back to Earth; but I had at least to look for a quick, sure\nway to death, in case--in case--\"\n\n\"You--and us too!\" exclaimed Clee impulsively. \"No Earth-man--no\nAmerican, at least--is ever going to submit to slavery. If the worst\ncomes to the worst, we'll at least die together, Vivian!\"\n\nJim added soberly: \"And perhaps, if we do, no one from Xantra's planet\nwill ever again come to Earth looking for 'docile' slaves....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment everyone was silent, affected by the thought behind what\nthey had said. Then the girl's voice suggested, with a touch of Earth\nformality that was almost ludicrous under the circumstances: \"But you\ntwo men have not yet introduced yourselves!\"\n\nBoth Clee and Jim smiled, and told her their names, and in the slight\npause that followed Clee said awkwardly, almost shyly: \"Miss Gray, we\ndon't know what's in store for us here, and it--it's possible that we\nmay never know each other any better: so would you--I mean, I wonder\nwould you mind if I reached out and touched you. In spite of all we\nhave said. I--I can hardly realize that you are there, somewhere,\nbefore me.\"\n\nOut of the nothingness came an impulsive soft hand that closed over\nhis. There was both a smile and something deeper in Vivian's voice as\nshe said, \"Here,\" and raised his hand until it touched her brow and\nthe thick smooth hair of her head. Then she placed it a little lower,\nover her face; and gently Clee's fingers told him what his eyes could\nnot read.\n\n\"In case you never see me--why, I--I'd like you to know that I'm\nreally, not bad looking,\" she said; and Clee knew she was blushing as\nhe smiled at the eternal feminine in her.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut the smile suddenly left his face. His hand had felt her give a\ndistinct start. Then--\n\n\"He's calling!\" she gasped faintly. \"Xantra's calling for me to come\nto him!\" Her voice, as she spoke, moved, and Clee knew she was going\ntowards the door.\n\n\"No!\" he cried impulsively. \"Don't risk it! Stay here, and we'll begin\nour fight against him right now!\"\n\n\"I will be safe,\" came Vivian's reassuring voice from the door. \"I can\nmanage him a while yet.\" Her further words came with a rush. \"But I\nwanted to tell you--I had a faint plan. If I could get hold of the\nanaesthetic--the vial of stuff that smells like cloves--\"\n\nThe door was closing now, and the two men knew she was moving down the\ncorridor. They listened in vain for her to complete what she had been\nsaying. Just before the door clicked shut, Jim jammed his foot in it,\npreventing it from closing.\n\n\"Gee, that girl has courage!\" Clee murmured.\n\nFor a moment the two men looked at each other. Jim was thinking about\nthe opened door, and the chance they had to get out. But Clee's mind\nwas on something else.\n\n\"Well, Jim,\" he said, \"you and I have a nasty job ahead.\"\n\nJim looked at Clee wonderingly as he took out his pipe and stuck it in\nthe crack of the door, allowing him to remove his foot. Clee explained\nto him what Xantra had told him with the thought-sending helmets;\nreminded him of what they had learned from Vivian about the lumps on\ntheir necks. After he had finished he said quietly but decisively:\n\n\"Now, we're going to try and remove whatever is under these lumps.\nHave you got anything sharp? Your knife? Something with an edge on\nit?\"\n\nIt would mean escape from the domination of Xantra's will!--from his\nterrible stabbing punishment!--if they could remove them! Jim breathed\na little quicker in his excitement.\n\n\"But once we do it--if we _can_ do it--it'll mean that we'll have to\nmake our break to escape right away,\" he reminded Clee. \"We'll be\ncaught if Xantra wills us to come to him and we don't appear!\"\n\n\"You know what will happen to Vivian if we delay the attempt.\" Clee\nreminded him levelly: and Jim knew that Clee was right--that their\nbreak for freedom must start right then and there....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked through his pockets and produced some cigarettes, matches, a\npipe, a nailfile and some utterly useless odds and ends. Clee's hands\ncame out of his pockets empty. \"I've got nothing at all,\" he said--and\npicked up the nailfile and looked at it questioningly. \"We'll have to\nuse this, I guess.... Well, I'm first.\"\n\nHe lay face down on the floor and loosened his collar. Quietly, he\nmade several suggestions. \"Light a match and heat the tip in the\nflame,\" he said. \"The point's pretty dull, but cut as deep and quick\nand clean as you can. If I yell, pay no attention; I'll try to hold\nstill. Unless it bleeds very much, best not make a bandage; we've\nnothing clean enough.\"\n\nThat was all he said; and Jim, his heart beating like mad, and a lump\nin his throat, could find no words at all. He sterilized the tip of\nthe file as directed, studied the lump a moment, then, after a rough,\naffectionate shake of his friend's shoulder, he knelt close to his\ntask. One quick hard cut; a sharp gasp from Clee; a repetition; then\ntwo more times crossways--and a firm, spongelike metallic disc lay\nrevealed. Then the worst--raising it a little, and breaking the\nseveral fine wires that led from it through the flesh within....\n\nClee lay panting, the sweat running down the deep wrinkles of pain on\nhis face. Dark blood oozed from the jagged wound. But he smiled a\nlittle, and some of the pain-wrinkles in his face smoothed away, when\nJim showed him the disk....\n\nFor a short time Clee rested, quieting his nerves, while Jim staunched\nthe flow of blood.\n\nAnd then it was Jim's turn; and he bore the sharp agony as stoically\nas Clee....\n\nIt was perhaps a strange thing; but at this great moment in the lives\nof the two men they felt no need to talk. For the few minutes they\nrested after they had done, no word was spoken; but in that time a\nbond of friendship was formed that only death could ever break....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey did not rest long. Every moment brought them nearer to the\ninevitable discovery of what they had done. Their muscles were still\nquivering, the wounds on their necks still slowly bleeding, when Clee\nrose and aroused Jim. The most dangerous, desperate part of their wild\nrevolt lay just ahead.\n\nThey were able to make but the vaguest of plans, not knowing what to\nanticipate outside. They only knew that they would first have to\nstrike boldly for possession of the control alcove--which, without\ndoubt meant they would have, somehow, to kill Xantra--to find and kill\na man they could not see, yet who could see them. An enormous task.\nAnd only the first of several.\n\nFor a moment, realizing this, they hesitated at the door. But the die\nhad been cast; there was nothing for them to do but go forward--and\nquickly; so, giving Jim a final warning that they must stick together,\nClee opened wide the door and stepped out into the corridor.\n\nWhat he saw there halted, him in his tracks.\n\n\"The slaves!\" gasped Jim, and involuntarily both Earth-men backed into\nthe room again. The creatures they had seen at once followed them\ninside.\n\nThere were four of them. As tall as men, they were, and the general\ncast of their bodies was identical. But they were different in\nshocking little details. Their heads were much larger, and in the\nshape of inverted pears, like those of hydrocephalics; their eyes,\npopped and dull. The thin lips beneath their stubs of noses were ever\nwrithing and twisting in horrible grimaces. And, worst, their skins\nwere sickly-white, and were absolutely bald of hair. The only clothes\nthey wore were loin-cloths and very large sandals, which exposed to\nfull view their chunky, muscular bodies.\n\nAll this the two men took in at a glance. They knew they could never\nhope to cope, unarmed, with four such creatures as these, so they\nstood with their backs to the wall, alertly awaiting their first\nmove.\n\n\"Easy,\" warned Clee. \"They're probably only coming to take us in hand,\nas Vivian said.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe nearest of the slaves stepped a little closer to the two men, and\nby the twitching of its eyelids and the increased mouthings of its\nlips it was apparent that the creature was highly excited. A high,\nvariable moaning sound came from its throat. Curiously, boldly, it\nlooked Clee all over--and then it did an amazing thing. Seeing the\nblood on the back of his neck, it swung him around, put its writhing\nlips to the still-bleeding wound and dog-like licked it clean.\n\nThe gesture was altogether a friendly one.\n\nAnother of the slaves of Xantra went up and did the same to Jim, and\nthe two men looked at each other with relief. This meant that the\nremoval of the disks had not been understood by the creatures!\n\nIt was with growing hope that they allowed themselves to be conducted\nfrom their cell, through the sloping corridor into a doorway they had\npassed coming in, and down a curving flight of steps into a large room\nbelow. They were in the space at the very bottom of the ship, for,\nthrough the redly-glowing transparent walls that curved on each side\nand below, they could see the infinite deeps of star-filled space.\nThree other slaves were there, waiting for them. At the far side of\nthe room their guide pointed to two small stalls, with a partition\nbetween, which they understood were to be their beds. They were across\nfrom a long row of similar ones.\n\n\"Making us right at home,\" commented Jim. \"I wonder if they'll serve\ncakes and tea.\"\n\n\"Wish they would,\" added Clee; \"I'm getting damned hungry. But we've\ngot work to do--and we've got to do it quick!\"\n\nHis eyes swept the room, looking among the sparse furnishings for\nsomething they might be able to use as a weapon. He saw nothing, but\nthe sight of the lump on the neck of a nearby slave gave him an idea.\n\n\"I wonder if these slaves would fight for us if we removed the lumps\nfrom their necks,\" he said musingly, his eyes narrow. \"I wish there\nwere some way to talk to them....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe looked from one to another of the animal-men making a circle about\nthem, wondering what to do; then quickly he made his decision. \"Jim,\nI'm going to try. It'll have to be done by signs; I've got to make\nthem understand, and get their permission.\"\n\nAt once he raised his hand to get the slaves' attention; then, raising\nboth fists high in the air, he shook them violently, at the same time\ngritting his teeth, working his face, and growling in animal anger at\nsomething overhead. He was trying to show the slaves his anger at\nXantra, above.\n\nThe slaves fell away from him in surprise and alarm, not understanding\nwhat he was trying to put across. He continued his demonstration,\nhopping about furiously, but still without result. Then Jim cried out:\n\n\"Touch the place on your neck!\"\n\nClee did so, and the result was startling. Quickly there ran around\nthe circle throaty growls of anger, and every slave raised a hand to\nthe lump on its neck. Evidently they had all felt the awful\npunishment-pain of their master.\n\nHeartened by this, Clee extended his pantomime. Stopping his\ndemonstration of anger, he put one finger on the wound on his neck and\nfell to the floor, writhing in simulated pain. As he lay there\ngroaning, the easily aroused animal-men moaned with him in sympathy.\nThen Jim, inspired, stepped into the act. Taking out his nailfile, he\nbent over the prostrate Clee and pretended to cut into his neck,\nmaking a great show of removing something and throwing it away; and as\nhe did so Clee jumped to his feet and grinned and hopped about the\nroom in a wildly exaggerated affectation of joy and relief. Then he\nstopped his acting and carefully showed the slaves the wounds in his\nand Jim's necks, by finger movements doing his best to make it clear\nthat they had removed something from there.\n\nAnd then, taking no chances, he repeated the whole pantomime, Jim, at\nthe proper place, acting his part as before.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen at last he stopped and looked around, he was over-joyed at his\napparent success in putting across the idea. All over the room the\nanimal-men were repeating his show in its various phases.\n\n\"Now I've got to take the disk out of one of them,\" said Clee, \"and\nit's a mighty dangerous thing to attempt! You see how easily their\nemotions are aroused. If I hurt too much--!\"\n\n\"I know,\" responded Jim, \"but we've got to risk it, for if we succeed\nwe've got a good bunch of tough fighters at our backs. We need every\nbit of help we can get!\"\n\nCarefully they made their few preparations, and Clee, again by acting,\nindicated to one of the animal-men what he wanted to do. He seemed to\nmake himself well understood, for without hesitation the creature lay\nface down on the floor. The others all gathered around as Clee bent\nover it, and Jim scanned their faces closely for any sign of suspicion\nor resentment. Seeing none, he told Clee to start; then held his\nbreath in awful suspense.\n\nThe disk appeared near the surface, and with a quick slice Clee made\nhis first incision. With the cut, the prone slave bucked and snarled.\nClee murmured soothing words to it in English, and, as the creature\nquieted down, made another cut. Again came the bucking and throaty\nprotest; and this time, to Jim's dismay, he saw in the bestial faces\nof the animal-men around them a sympathetic swing of emotional\nprotest. A little more, now; and Clee would be able to take the disk\nout; but would the slaves restrain themselves until then?\n\nAgain Clee allowed the brute body under him to calm down. Then, as he\nwas about to cut once more, from somewhere above in the space ship\ncame the piercing scream of a woman. Something was happening to\nVivian.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClee half started to rise, to run to her aid, but he forced himself to\nbe reasonable. Weaponless, visible, he could never hope to rescue an\ninvisible girl from someone he couldn't even see. He was on the point\nof making valuable allies; in just a few moments more--! He decided to\nhurry through with the job he had undertaken.\n\nAll below had heard the scream. The circle around him was shifting\nuncertainly, and peculiar sounds were coming out of the brutes'\ntwisting mouths as he bent again over their fellow on the floor.\n\nClee's hand was trembling like an aspen leaf as he prepared to make\nthe next incision. He was completely unnerved, and with the utmost\nefforts of his will he was unable to control the nailfile. And he had\nto hurry!\n\nHe sliced as straight as he could at the bleeding lump; the slave\nmoved; and the point of the file slipped deep into the creature's\nflesh!\n\nAt that, with a snarling growl the brute below arched from the floor\nand flung Clee sprawling. From all around the circle came menacing\ngrowls as the bleeding animal-man lumbered to its feet and came after\nhim in a definite attack. Jim, not at that moment the center of their\nattention, pushed one of the slaves in the way of the charging brute\nand the two of them half fell; and before they could recover their\nbalance Clee was on his feet making after Jim to the steps that led up\nout of the room.\n\n\"Up!\" came Jim's shout. \"Fast! We've made them enemies!\"\n\nAbove them on the stairs was descending another slave, innocent of\nwhat had transpired below, and the two men bowled it over in their\nhaste to get past. All the way to the bottom of the stairs it tumbled;\nand that delayed pursuit for the moment needed by the Earth-men to\ngain the upper corridor. Quickly they darted through the door; there\nwas no way they could lock or block it, so they had to run on. Taking\nto the left, they found themselves in the little entrance room, and\nfrom there their only course led up the corridor leading to Xantra's\nquarters and the control alcove.\n\nArrived there, the two men found the door ajar, but they paused\nirresolute before it, hardly daring to go in. They had no choice,\nhowever, for behind, only fifteen feet away, came the van of the\nanimal-men. They pushed through the door, closed and bolted it, then,\nwheeling tigerishly, surveyed the room.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey saw no one.\n\nThey were not relieved at this. Xantra might well be there; he, as\nwell as Vivian, would be invisible to them. And he had every\nopportunity of striking first; even then he might be preparing to deal\nwith them, if he was in the room. The slaves were not attempting to\nbreak in the door to get them--and this was ominous: it argued that\nthe master was there.\n\nThe two men stood motionless at the door, peering intently at the rug\nin search of telltale footprints. Then Clee touched Jim's shoulder and\nwhispered faintly in his ear:\n\n\"Cloves! Smell it?\"\n\nJim nodded. Slowly, on guard every second, they advanced to the\nalcove. They saw no sign of anyone there, though the odor of cloves\nwas stronger. Jim grabbed a chair and held it ready, and Clee followed\nsuit with a small, heavy tabouret. Cautiously, methodically, the two\nmen began to reconnoitre the large room, examining foot by foot the\nrug in search of the faint clear prints that would reveal the presence\nof their enemy. The smell of cloves was beginning to dull their brains\na little. Clee saw the danger in this, and whispered to Jim:\n\n\"Faster! Xantra may be insidiously anaesthetizing us! We've got to\nfind where he is--quick!\"\n\nThey hastened their search, feeling more and more sure that Xantra was\nclose by. And not till then did Clee remember that he had a way to\ndiscover Xantra's location. Jim heard him curse under his breath; saw\nhim put down the tabouret and take out his tobacco; and knew at once\nwhat he was about to do. He went close to Clee, to guard him with his\nchair against possible attack.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe face of Clee's wrist watch was glowing brightly; it took only a\nsecond to find with the package of tobacco a spot which cut the dial's\nunnatural glow. As they found it the skin on the two men's bodies\nprickled all over. The line from the dial to the package of tobacco,\nif continued, would reach a spot on the floor not six feet away. And\nlooking carefully there they could barely make out, in the bent hairs\nof the rug, a broken outline that might have been made by a prone\nfigure.\n\nAs they prepared to jump they heard from that place a low sigh--and\njust before them appeared the distinct print of a human hand. Xantra\nwas rising! And coincident with this a sudden banging at the door told\nthem that the slaves at last had started to break in!\n\nAs one man the two Earthlings leaped on Xantra; he would have to be\ntaken care of first. When they had fastened on his rising body they\npunched and pounded it furiously. Though their enemy was undoubtedly\nonly half conscious, the sudden attack aroused him and he resisted\nvigorously. But then Clee made a lucky connection on what he felt to\nbe his jaw, and the invisible form in their arms went limp.\n\n\"Get a rope--wire--anything to bind him with--quick!\" yelled Clee.\n\"I'll hold him!\"\n\nThe pounding at the door was increasing ominously is Jim dashed over\nto the work-table. Rapidly he looked for something suitable, and in a\nfew seconds was back with a length of stout wire which they quickly\nwrapped around the ankles and wrists of the limp form Clee was\nholding. As the wire touched Xantra it gradually disappeared from\ntheir sight, but their fingers reassured them that he was tightly\nbound.\n\nThen they were at the door, which, shivering and bending from the\nbattering without, showed signs of giving in. With herculean efforts\nthey dragged a heavy divan over and wedged it tightly against it; then\nadded other furniture in a tight supporting pile. But the door, of\nsome light metal, was not built to stand such a siege, and was\nbuckling further inward with each blow being dealt it. More and more\nplainly the two men could hear the triumphant snarls and howls of the\nanimal-men.\n\nFrantically they ransacked the rooms looking for what they thought\nmight be weapons, but found none. They looked at each other with\ndismay. It was only a question of time--minutes--before the slaves\nwould break in. What could they do?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn that tense moment of indecision a low, weak voice reached their\nears--a woman's voice, and one they remembered well.\n\n\"Vivian!\" cried Clee, and ran to the alcove, from whence it had seemed\nto come. The girl's next words brought them understanding.\n\n\"Clee--Jim--it's Xantra! He's willing the slaves to break in! He's\nlying bound on the floor, but he's conscious!\"\n\nClee ran to where he had left the invisible man, cursing himself under\nhis breath for being an utter ass for not having guessed this. His\ngroping fingers quickly found the squirming Xantra's neck; and he had\nbegun to throttle him into unconsciousness when Vivian called out:\n\n\"No! Don't! That won't stop the slaves: they've already been given the\norder! We've got to make Xantra stop them! Here--drag him to the\nwork-table! I've got something--\"\n\nWondering what the girl was about, Clee relaxed his grip on the\ninvisible man's neck and complied. But he suddenly understood--and\nJim, too--when he saw coming through the air the pair of\nthought-sending helmets. He had a way of communicating with Xantra, of\ncourse! He saw the larger helmet lower to rest over the head he was\nstill holding; then soft hands placed the other over his own.\n\nAs it settled down a great crash sounded in the other room: the door\nhad given in. It was still held almost in place by the tightly-wedged\nfurniture, but that would not hold the animal-men long.\n\n\"Hurry!\" cried Jim. \"I'll stand by the door!\" And he was already on\nhis way to it.\n\nClee saw the small panel on the table above; saw the knob on it turn.\nHe caught Vivian's excited voice. \"Tell him to order them to stop,\"\nshe said; \"or else--or else--\"\n\n\"He dies!\" finished Clee, viciously thumbing into the air where the\ninvisible Xantra's neck was.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith all the intensity he could muster, Clee concentrated on one\nsimple, strong thought. He hardly heard the triumphant cries of the\nslaves as they felt the blocking furniture give before their efforts;\nall his energy was being expended in the will to get his thought\nacross.\n\n\"Tell those slaves to stop breaking in or you die!\" he commanded.\n\nThe noises at the door continued. Either Xantra had not understood, or\nelse he was stubborn. He repeated his command and threat, and still\nthe crashing sounds came to his ears.\n\nDesperate, he played his last card; and unconsciously his lips formed\nthe words of his next mental command, so that it was understood by the\nbreathlessly watching Vivian.\n\n\"_Tell them to stop!_\" he willed. \"_No more air till you do!_\" And\nwith the words his fingers closed tightly over the other's throat.\n\nThe sounds at the door continued; for a moment the invisible form\nbetween Clee's knees writhed violently--and then suddenly, almost\nmagically, a silence fell over the whole room. Clee had forced his\nwill on Xantra! He had made him stop the slaves!\n\nAnd just in time.\n\nClee's fingers relaxed a little on the throat of the man beneath him.\nHe turned and said: \"Quick, Vivian--find that anaesthetic!\" A moment\nlater it was pressed in his hands. \"Say when,\" he told the girl, and\nheld it beneath the nose of the helpless man. Xantra's head at once\nfell back, and he heard Vivian telling him to stop. He pulled away the\nbottle, corked it and stood up.\n\n\"Well, that's that,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment he was silent. Only the noises made by Jim in\nstrengthening the barricade at the door could be heard in the room.\nThen he said, earnestly:\n\n\"I wish I could see you, Vivian--right now; but that'll have to wait.\nI guess....\"\n\nA low laugh came from the place where the girl was standing. A hand\ntouched his arm, and he found himself being conducted into the alcove.\nVivian laughed again; said, teasingly, \"What a stupid expression on\nyour face!\" then commanded him to shut his eyes, and keep them shut.\nHe felt something being attached to his wrists; heard a coarse hum\nthat quickly rose in pitch until it passed the range of hearing. He\nwas caught up in a surprising exhilaration; he heard the hum again,\nsliding down and down in pitch, while every atom in his body felt a\nsickening vibration that grew ever coarser. Then suddenly he felt\nnormal; the things on his wrists were removed and Vivian told him he\ncould open his eyes.\n\nHe did so. He had guessed what she had done, but he was surprised,\nnevertheless, to see the straight, slender, attractive girl who stood\nbefore him.\n\n\"You see, Xantra used this on me twice--the latter time to restore me,\nso I would be able to see him. I watched him carefully,\" the girl\nexplained.\n\nClee gazed at Vivian in greatest confusion. Why--she was beautiful! He\ngrew conscious of a growing need to say something, and eventually the\nasinine thing that left his lips was:\n\n\"Yes--you--you aren't bad looking at all.\"\n\nThe girl turned away, blushing; and it was Jim who relieved Clee from\nhis awkward situation. He came swinging happily through the alcove\nportal to suddenly stop in blank surprise. Clee had disappeared!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt did not take long to restore Jim to his normal self, and Vivian and\nClee laughed at the great sigh of relief he unconsciously gave when he\nfound himself able to see the girl who before had been only a\ndisembodied Voice to him. Clee explained to Vivian what had happened\nto them down below, and she in turn told them how she and Xantra had\ncome to be unconscious when they reached the control alcove.\n\n\"I found the anaesthetic by its smell soon after I went to Xantra,\"\nshe explained. \"I tried to conceal it in my dress, but Xantra saw me\nand tried to take it away; and in the struggle that followed I guess\nwe both got anaesthetized. When I came to I saw you and Jim trying to\nhold back the slaves; and I could see Xantra on the floor,\nconscious--which you couldn't--and knew he was ordering the slaves on.\nSo I told you, and--here we are!\n\n\"Do you want to see Xantra now?\" she added.\n\nClee would never forget the sight of the bound figure that met his\neyes on the floor on the large room. The clothes were odd; the figure\nwas much that of a normal man, though the shoulders were more sloped\nand the head much larger; but it was the face, its expression, that\nheld him.\n\nUnhealthy, leprous-white was the skin, and there was not one hair,\neyelash or eyebrow on the whole head. The closed eyes lay in deep\ncaverns surrounded by a thousand fine wrinkles, which crisscrossed all\nover his face in every direction. The face and head were\nfreakish--monstrous; and yet, somehow, over it rested an expression of\ninfinite wisdom and calm. He lay bound and still and unconscious, at\nthe mercy of men far below him intellectually, this man from another\nplanet. Clee could not help but compare him to a stoical man staked\nout on an anthill to die....\n\n\"We'll have to keep him unconscious with the anaesthetic,\" he said at\nlength; \"he's too dangerous to monkey with. And that means we've got\nto find out how to run this ship--take it back ourselves.\"\n\n\"Leave that to me!\" said Jim, feeling quite chipper. \"Never saw\nanything yet I couldn't drive. Where is it--Cape Cod, you want to be\nlet off, Miss Gray?... O. K. This is my joy-ride, and I'll see that\nyou're delivered at your front door.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMore than two days later, again at night, the few look-outs on the\nlonely fishing craft off Cape Cod might have seen a pinpoint of\ncherry-red appear off the eastern horizon and make a wide arc up the\nheavens.\n\nIts course was erratic, and it made sudden angles as it drew near the\nzenith. It glowed more and more brightly as it approached--until it\ndisappeared from sight overhead.\n\nFor some minutes it was invisible; and then, suddenly, only a few\nhundred yards overhead, it emerged into view again, a great sphere of\nfaintly glowing, cherry-red crystal. Rapidly--with dangerous speed--it\ndescended, straight for the shore-line of Massachusetts Bay. And as it\nneared, its erratic side-to-side dashes increased, rather than\ndiminished.\n\nDown at a wide angle it came for the beach; then, when it was a\nhundred feet away, it sheared suddenly out to sea. There, only a few\nfeet above the water, it darted to the side once more--and fell, and\nskipped along the water at dizzying speed.\n\nBut it did not go far. With its first contact with the water a great\ncrack split the night air; and a little further, the ship split into\nhundreds of small pieces, all of which slid along the surface of the\nwater until, their momentum lost, they came to a stop and slowly sank\nfrom view. A dozen figures were left threshing on the surface; but one\nby one they disappeared, till there were only four left. Then one of\nthe four sank from sight....\n\nSlowly but steadily the remaining three drew near to the welcoming\nshore, and at last stood dripping and tired on the sandy beach. For\nsome time they stood there in silence, reviewing all the incredible\nadventure they had been through, as they gazed off across the water to\nthe place where the slave ship had gone down.\n\nBut one of them--Jim--had something to say, and at last it came out.\n\n\"Well, I _told_ you I'd drive you safely back!\"\n\nClee, his arm around the waist of the exhausted Vivian, smiled and\nanswered:\n\n\"But I don't see Vivian's front door.\"\n\n\"We're close enough!\" Jim snorted. \"After all, I _did_ hit the Earth!\"\n\n\n[Illustration: Advertisement]\n\n\n\n\nThe Revolt of the Machines\n\n_By Nat Schachner and Arthur L. Zagat_\n\n[Illustration: \"Look!\" he gasped. Out on the floor was a shambles.]\n\n[Sidenote: Something in the many-faceted mind of the master machine\nspurs it to diabolical revolt against the authority of its human\nmasters.]\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n_For five thousand years, since that nigh legendary figure Einstein\nwrote and thought in the far-off mists of time, the scientists\nendeavored to reduce life and the universe to terms of a mathematical\nformula. And they thought they had succeeded. Throughout the world,\nmachines did the work of man, and the aristos, owners of the machines,\nplayed in soft idleness in their crystal and gold pleasure cities.\nEven the prolat hordes, relieved of all but an hour or two per day of\ntoil, were content in their warrens--content with the crumbs of their\nmasters._\n\n_Then the ice began to move, down from the north and up from the\nsouth. Slowly, inexorably, the jaws of the great vise closed, till all\nthat was left of the wide empire of man was a narrow belt about the\nequator. Everywhere else was a vast tumbled waste of cold and glaring\nwhiteness, a frozen desert. In the narrow habitable belt were\ncompacted the teeming millions of earth's peoples._\n\n_In spite of the best efforts of the scientists among them, the\ncrowding together of the myriads of earth's inhabitants brought in its\ntrain the inevitable plagues of famine and disease. Even with the most\nintensive methods of cultivation, even with the synthetic food\nfactories running day and night, there could not be produced enough to\nsustain life in the hordes of prolats. And with the lowering of\nresistance and the lack of sufficient sanitary arrangements, disease\nbegan to spread with ever increasing rapidity and virulence._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_The aristos trembled, for they were few, and the prolats many.\nAlready were arising loud and disheveled orators, inciting the\nmillions to arise against their masters. The aristos were few, but\nthey were not helpless. In the blackness of a moonless, clouded night\nthere was a whispering of many wings, and from dark shapes that loomed\nagainst the dark sky, great beams swept over the tented fields where\nthe prolats lay huddled and sleeping. And when the red sun circled the\nice-chained earth he found in his path heaps of dust where on his last\njourney he had warmed the swarming millions._\n\n_The slaves thus ruthlessly destroyed could well be spared, for the\nmachines did the work of the world, even to the personal care of the\naristos' pampered bodies. Only for direction, and starting and\nstopping, was the brain and the hand of man required. Now that the\ninhabited portion of the terrestrial globe was so straitly\ncircumscribed, radio power waves, television and radio-phone, rendered\nfeasible the control of all the machines from one central station,\nbuilt at the edge of the Northern Glacier. Here were brought the scant\nfew of the prolats that had been spared, a pitiful four hundred men\nand women, and they were set to endless, thankless tasks._\n\n_I was one of those few; and Keston, my friend, who was set at the\nhead of the force. I was second in command. For a decade we labored,\nwhipped our fellows to their tasks, that the aristos might loll\ncareless in the perfume and silks of their pleasure palaces, or riot\nin wild revel, to sink at last in sodden stupor. Sprawled thus they\nwould lie, until the dressing machines we guided would lift them\ngently from their damasked couches, bathe them with warm and fragrant\nwaters, clothe their soft carcasses in diaphanous, iridescent webs,\nand start them on a new day of debauchery._\n\n_But the slow vengeance of an inscrutable Omnipotence they mockingly\ndenied overtook them at last, and I saw the rendering and payment of\nthe long past due account._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs I entered the vast domed hall wherein all my waking hours were\nspent, the shrill whistle of an alarm signal told me that something\nhad been wrong. Instinctively I looked toward the post of Abud. Three\ntimes in the past week had Keston or I been called upon for swift\naction to right some error of that dull witted prolat. On the oval\nvisor-screen above the banked buttons of his station I saw the\nimpending catastrophe. Two great freight planes, one bearing the\nglowing red star that told of its cargo of highly explosive terminite,\nwere approaching head-on with lightning rapidity. The fool had them on\nthe same level.\n\nAbud was gaping now at the screen in paralyzed fright, with no idea of\nhow to avoid the cataclysm. Just below I glimpsed the soaring towers\nof Antarcha. In a moment that gold and crystal pleasure city would be\nblasted to extinction, with all its sleeping thousands. Swift would be\nthe vengeance of the aristos. Already I could see Abud and Keston and\na hundred others melting in the fierce rays of the Death Bath!\n\nBut, even as my face blanched with the swift and terrible vision, the\nlittle controller's car ground to a smoking stop at Abud's back. With\none motion Keston's lithe form leaped from his seat and thrust aside\nthe gaping prolat. His long white fingers darted deftly over the\ngleaming buttons. The red starred plane banked in a sudden swerve; the\nother dipped beneath. Distinct from the speaker beneath the screen\ncame the whoosh of the riven air as the fliers flashed past, safe by a\nmargin of scant feet. Another rippling play of the prolat chief's\nfingers and the planes were back on their proper courses. The whistle\nceased its piercing alarm, left a throbbing stillness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nChief Keston turned to the brute faced culprit. Cold contempt tautened\nthe thin, ascetic features of his face. Somehow I was at his side: I\nmust have been running across the wide floor of the Control Station\nwhile the crisis had flared and passed. In measured tones, each word a\ncutting whip-lash, came his well merited rebuke:\n\n\"Don't try me too far, Abud. Long before this I should have relieved\nyou of your post, and ordered you to the Death Bath. I am derelict in\nmy duty that I do not do so. By my weak leniency I imperil the lives\nof your comrades, and my own. It is your good fortune that a Council\ndelegate has not been present at one of your exhibitions. But I dare\nnot risk more. Let the warning whistle come from your station just\nonce again and I shall report you as an incompetent. You know the\nlaw.\"\n\nI looked to see the man cringe in abasement and contrition. But the\nheavy jaw thrust forth in truculent defiance; hate blazed forth from\nthe deep-set eyes; the florid features were empurpled with rage. He\nmade as if to reply, but turned away from the withering scorn in\nKeston's face.\n\n\"Ha, Meron, here at last.\" A warm smile greeted me. \"I've been waiting\nfor you impatiently.\"\n\n\"I'm an hour before my time,\" I replied, then continued,\nexasperatedly: \"Chief, I hope this latest imbecility will convince you\nthat you ought to turn him in. I know it hurts you to condemn a prolat\nto the Death Bath, but if you let him go on, his mistakes will bring\nus all to that end.\"\n\nI glanced toward where a black portal broke the circle of\nswitchboards, and shuddered. Behind that grim gate leaped and flared\neternally the flame of the consuming Ray, the exhaust flue of the\nsolar energy by which the machines were fed. Once I had seen a\ncondemned man step through that aperture at the order of an aristo\nwhom he had offended. For a moment his tortured body had glowed with a\nterrible golden light. Then--there was nothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy friend pressed my arm, calmingly. Again he smiled. \"Come, come,\nMeron, don't get all worked up. It isn't his fault. Why, look at him.\nCan't you see that he is a throwback, lost in this world of science\nand machines? Besides\"--his voice dropped low--\"it doesn't matter any\nmore. Man-failure will no longer trouble the even tenor of the\nmachines. I've finished.\"\n\nA tremor of excitement seized me. \"You've completed it at last? And it\nworks?\"\n\n\"It works. I tested it when the shifts changed at midnight; kept the\noncoming force outside for five minutes. It works like a charm.\"\n\n\"Great! When will you tell the Council?\"\n\n\"I've already sent the message off. You know how hard it is to get\nthem away from their wines and their women--but they'll be here soon.\nBut before they come, I've something to tell you. Let's go back behind\nthe screens.\"\n\nAs we walked toward the huge tarpaulin-screened mass that bulked in\nthe center of the great chamber, I glanced around the hall, at the\nthousand-foot circle of seated prolats. Two hundred men and women were\nthere; two hundred more were sleeping in the dormitories. These were\nall that were left of the world's workers. Before each operative rose\nthe serried hundreds of pearl buttons, dim lit, clicking in and out\nunder the busy fingers. Above each, an oval visor-screen with its\nflitting images brought across space the area the switches controlled.\nEvery one of the ten score was watching his screen with taut\nattention, and listening to the voices of the machines there\ndepicted--the metallic voices from the radio speakers broadcasting\ntheir needs.\n\nThe work was going on as it had gone on for ten years, with the\nomnipresent threat of the Death Bath whipping flagged, tired brains to\ndreary energy. The work kept going on till they dropped worn out at\nlast in their tired seats. Only in Keston's brain, and in mine, flamed\nthe new hope of release. Tomorrow the work would be done, forever.\nTomorrow, we would be released, to take our places in the pleasure\npalaces. To loll at ease, breathing the sweet perfume of idleness,\nwaited on by machines _directed by a machine_.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor, as we stood behind the heavy canvas folds that Keston had drawn\naside, there towered, fifty feet above me, halfway to the arching\nroof, a machine that was the ultimate flowering of man's genius.\nAlmost man-form it was--two tall metal cylinders supporting a larger,\nthat soared aloft till far above it was topped by a many-faceted ball\nof transparent quartz. Again I had a fleeting, but vivid, impression\nof something baleful, threatening, about it. Small wonder, though. For\nthe largest cylinder, the trunk of the man-machine Keston had created,\nwas covered thick with dangling arms. And the light of the xenon tube\nthat flooded the screened space was reflected from the great glass\nhead till it seemed that the thing was alive; that it was watching me\ntill some unguarded moment would give it its chance.\n\nA long moment we stood, going again over each detail of the thing,\ngrown so familiar through long handling as it was slowly assembled.\nThen my friend's voice, low pitched as was its wont, dissipated the\nvisions I was seeing. \"Two hours ago, Meron, with none here but me to\nsee, those arms were extended, each to its appointed station. And, as\nthe sensitive cells in the head received the signals from the\nvisor-screens and the radio-speakers the arms shot about the\nkey-boards and pressed the proper buttons just as our men are doing\nnow. The work of the world went on, without a falter, with only the\nmaster machine to direct it. Yet a year ago, when I first spoke to you\nof the idea, you told me it was impossible!\"\n\n\"You have won,\" I responded; \"you have taken the last step in the\nturning over of the functions of man to machines--the last step but\none. Routine control, it is true, can now be exercised by this--those\nfellows out there are no longer necessary--but there will still be the\nunexpected, unforeseen emergencies that will require human\nintelligence to meet and cope with them. You and I, I'm afraid, are\nstill doomed to remain here and serve the machines.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKeston shook his head, while a little smile played over his\nsharp-featured face, and a glow of pride and triumph suffused his fine\ndark eyes. \"Grumbling again, old carper. What would you say if I told\nyou that I have solved even _that_ problem? I have given my master\nmachine intelligence!\"\n\nMy wide-eyed, questioning stare must have conveyed my thought to him,\nfor he laughed shortly, and said, \"No, I've not gone insane.\"\n\n\"It was an accident,\" he went on with amazing calm. \"My first idea was\nmerely to build something that would reduce the necessary supervisory\nforce to one or two humans. But, when I had almost completed my second\nexperimental model, I found that I was out of the copper filaments\nnecessary to wind a certain coil. I didn't want to wait till I could\nobtain more from the stores, and remembered that on the inside of the\ndoor to the Death Bath there was some fine screening that could be\ndispensed with. I used the wire from that. Whether the secret of life\nas well as of death lies in those waste rays from the sun, or whether\nsome unknown element of the humans consumed in the flame was deposited\non the screening in a sort of invisible coating, I do not know. But\nthis I do know: when that second model was finished, and the\nvitalizing current was turned on, things happened--queer things that\ncould be explained only on the ground that the machine had\nintelligence.\"\n\nHe fell silent a moment, then his thin pale lips twisted in a wry\nsmile. \"You know, Meron, I was a little scared. The thing I had\ncreated seemed possessed of a virulent antagonism toward me. Look.\" He\nbared an arm and held it out. A livid weal ran clear around the\nfore-arm. \"One of the tentacles I had given it whipped around my arm\nlike a flash. If I had not cut off the current at once it might have\nsqueezed through flesh and bone. The pressure was terrific.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was about to speak, when from the screen nearest the entrance door a\nbeam of green light darted out, vanished, came again. Once, twice,\nthree times.\n\n\"Look, Chief, the signal. They're coming. The Council will soon be\nhere.\"\n\n\"They're over-prompt. My message must have aroused their curiosity.\nBut listen:\n\n\"I incorporated my new thought coil, as I called it, in the large\nmaster machine. But I don't know just what will happen when the\ncurrent flows through that. So I shunted it. The machine will work,\nroutinely, without it. There is a button that will bring it into\naction. When I shall have taken the proper precautions I will switch\nit on, and then we shall see what happens.\"\n\nWe saw, sooner than Keston expected.\n\nAgain the green beam flashed out. The great portals slowly opened.\nThrough them glided the three travel cars of the Supreme Council of\nthe aristos.\n\nIt had been almost a year since I saw them, the Over Lords of the\nWorld, and I had forgotten their appearance. Sprawled on the glowing\nsilks of their cushioned couches, eyes closed in languid boredom, they\nwere like huge white slugs. Swollen to tremendous size by the indolent\nluxuriousness of their lives, the flesh that was not concealed by the\nbright hued web of their robes was pasty white, and bagged and folded\nwhere the shrunken muscles beneath refused support. Great pouches\ndropped beneath swollen eyelids. Full-lipped, sensual mouths and\npendulous cheeks merged into the great fat rolls of their chins. I\nshuddered. These, _these_ were the masters for whom we slaved!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs we bent low the gliding cars came to rest, and a warm redolence of\nsweet perfume came to me from the fans softly whirling in the canopies\nover the aristos' heads. Strains of music rose and fell, and ceased as\na flat, tired voice breathed: \"Rise, prolats.\"\n\nI straightened up. The eyes of the Council were now opened, little\npig's eyes almost lost in the flesh about them. They glinted with a\ncold, inhuman cruelty. I shuddered, and thought of the night of terror\nten years before. And suddenly I was afraid, deathly afraid.\n\nLadnom Atuna, head of the Council, spoke again. \"We have come at your\npetition. What is this matter so grave that it has led you to disturb\nus at our pleasures?\"\n\nKeston bowed low. \"Your Excellency, I would not have presumed to\nintrude upon you for a small matter. I have so greatly ventured\nbecause I have at length solved the final step in the mechanization\nof the world. I have invented a master machine to operate the\nswitchboards in this hall and replace the workers thereat.\"\n\nThe flabby faces of the aristos betrayed not the slightest interest,\nnot the least surprise. Only Atuna spoke: \"Interesting, if true. Can\nyou prove your statement?\"\n\nKeston strode to the canvas screen and pulled a cord. The great canvas\ncurtains rolled back. \"Here is the machine, my Lords!\" His face was\nlit with the glow of pride of achievement. His voice had lost its\nreverence. Rapidly he continued: \"The head of this contrivance is a\nbank of photo and sono-electric cells, each facet focussed on one of\nthe screens. Through a nerve-system of copper filaments any\ncombination of lights and sounds will actuate the proper arm which\nwill shoot out to the required bank of buttons and press the ones\nnecessary to meet any particular demand. That is all the prolats are\ndoing out there, and they make mistakes, while my master machine\ncannot. The--\"\n\nBut Ladnom Atuna raised a languid hand. \"Spare us these technical\nexplanations. They bore us. All we desire to know is that the machine\nwill do as you say.\"\n\nThe chief flushed, and gulped. His triumph was not meeting with the\nacclaim he had expected. But he bowed. \"Very well. With your gracious\npermission I shall demonstrate its operation.\" Atuna nodded in\nacquiescence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKeston's voice rang out in crisp command. \"Attention, prolats. Cease\nworking.\" The long circling row suddenly jerked around; their flying\nfingers halted their eternal dartings. \"Quickly, down to the space in\nfront of the door to the Death Bath.\" A rush of hurried feet. These\nmen and women were accustomed to instant, unquestioning obedience.\n\"Absolute silence. Keep clear of the floor on peril of your lives.\"\n\nThe chief wheeled to the master machine and pressed a button.\nInstantly, the hundreds of dangling arms telescoped out, each to a\nbutton bank where a moment before a prolat had labored. And, with a\nweird simulation of life, the ten forked ends of each arm commenced a\nrattling pressing of the buttons. Rapidly, purposefully, the metallic\nfingers moved over the key-boards, and on the screens we could see\nthat the machines all over the world were continuing on their even\ncourse. Not the slightest change in their working betrayed the fact\nthat they were now being directed by a machine instead of human\nbeings. A great surge of admiration swept me at the marvelous\naccomplishment of my friend.\n\nNot so the aristos. Expressionless, they watched as the maze of\nstretching tentacles vibrated through the crowded air. Yet not quite\nexpressionless. I thought I could sense in the covert glances they\ncast at one another a crafty weighing of the implications of this\nmachine; a question asked and answered; a decision made. Then their\nspokesman turned languidly to the waiting, triumphant figure of\nKeston.\n\n\"Evidently your claims are proven. This means that the force of prolat\noperatives are no longer necessary.\"\n\n\"Yes, Your Excellency. They may now be released to a well earned\nreward.\"\n\nThe aristo ignored the interruption. \"We take it that only two will\nnow be required to operate this Control Station, to supply the last\nmodicum of human intelligence required to meet unforeseen\nemergencies.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI saw that Keston was about to interrupt once more, to tell the\nCouncil of the thought coil, the most unbelievable part of the miracle\nhe had wrought. But something seemed to warn me that he should not\nspeak. Standing behind him I nudged him, while I myself replied: \"Yes,\nYour Excellency.\" The chief flung me a startled look, but did not\ncorrect me.\n\nFrom the packed crowd of prolats at the other end of the hall I could\nhear a murmuring. While I could not make out the words, the very tones\ntold me that in the hearts of those weary slaves new hope was rising,\nthe same hope that glowed in Keston's face. But I was oppressed by an\nunreasoning fear.\n\nAtuna was still talking, in his cold, unemotional monotone. \"This being\nso, hear now our decision. Keston and Meron, you will remain here to meet\nall emergencies. You others, your function is done. You have done your\nwork well, you are now no longer needed to control the machines.\nTherefore,\"--he paused, and my heart almost stopped--\"therefore, being no\nlonger of value, you will be disposed of.\"\n\nA click sounded loud through the stunned silence. Beyond the white\ncrowd the huge black portal slid slowly open. A shimmering radiance of\nglowing vapors blazed from the space beyond.\n\n\"Prolats, file singly into the Death Bath!\" Atuna raised his voice\nonly slightly with the command. I glanced at Keston. He was livid with\nfury.\n\nIncredible as it may seem, so ingrained was the habit of obedience to\nthe aristos in the prolats that not even a murmur of protest came from\nthe condemned beings. The nearest man to the flaming death stepped out\ninto the void. His doomed body flared, then vanished. The next moved\nto his turn.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut suddenly a great shout rang out.\n\n\"Stop!\"\n\nIt was Keston's voice, but so changed, so packed with fury and\noutrage, that I scarcely recognized it.\n\nHis spare, tall form was drawn tensely straight as he shook a clenched\nfist at the Council. He was quivering with anger, and his eyes blazed.\n\n\"Aristos, you do wrong! These men have served you faithfully and well.\nI demand for them the reward they have earned--rest and leisure, and\nthe pleasures that for ten years they have seen you enjoy while they\nworked here for you. They have worked for you, I say, and now that I\nhave released them you would destroy them. Aristos, I demand justice!\"\n\nFor the first time I saw expression on the flaccid faces of the\nCouncil--surprise and astonishment that a prolat should dare dispute\nan aristo command. Then a sneer twisted Atuna's countenance.\n\n\"What is this? Who are you to demand anything from us? We spared these\nprolats because we needed them: we need them no longer, hence they\nmust die. What madness has seized you? Reward! Justice! For prolats!\nAs well say we should reward the stone walls of our houses; dispense\njustice to the machines. Proceed, prolats!\"\n\nKeston made as if to spring for the aristo's throat. I put out a hand\nto stop him. An invisible shield of death rays rimmed the platforms\nthe Council used. It was suicide! But suddenly he turned and sprang to\nthe master machine. He grasped a switch lever and threw it down.\n\nA long tentacle left its keys and swished menacingly through the air.\n\"Meron, prolats, under the key-boards!\" came Keston's shout. I dived\nto obey. Steel fingers clutched my jerkin and tore it loose as I\nlanded with a thud against the wall. Keston thumped alongside of me.\nHe was breathing heavily and his face was deathly pale.\n\n\"Look!\" he gasped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOut on the floor was a shambles. I saw one snakelike arm whip around\nthe stout form of Atuna, then tighten. A shriek of agony rang through\nthe hall. Another tentacle curled about the couch of a second aristo,\npinning the occupant to it. Then couch and all were swung a hundred\nfeet in the air to be crashed down with terrific force on the stone\nfloor. Two arms seized the third at the same time....\n\n\"Too sluggish to get out of the way in time, damn them!\" I heard\nKeston mutter. True, but not all the prolats had moved fast enough at\nthe warning shout. Cowering under the saving key-boards, shrinking\nfrom the metallic arms not quite long enough to reach them, I could\ncount only a score. The others--but what use to describe the slaughter\nout there! I see it in nightmares too often.\n\nA thunder from the speakers grew till it drowned out the agonized\nshrieks in the great hall. On the screens horror flared. All over the\nworld, it appeared, the machines had gone mad. I saw Antarcha crash as\na dozen air freighters plunged through the crystal towers. I saw a\nhuge dredge strip the roof from a great playhouse, and smash the\nstartled crowd within with stones it plucked from an embankment. I saw\nuntenanted land cars shooting wild through packed streets. Great\nponderous tractors left the fields and moved in ordered array on the\npanic-stricken cities. Methodically they pursued the fleeing aristos,\nand crushed them beneath their tread like scurrying ants.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI realized that the scraping of the tentacles reaching for us had\nceased, that the arms had all returned to the button banks. Then it\ndawned on me that Keston's master machine was directing all the\ndestruction I was watching, that the intelligence he had given it was\nbeing used to divert the machines from their regular tasks\nto--conquer the world. \"You sure started something, Keston,\" I said.\n\n\"Yes,\" he gasped, white-faced, \"something that I should have expected\nwhen that model machine went for me. Do you understand? I've given the\nmachines intelligence, created a new race, and they are trying to wipe\nout the humans; conquer the world for themselves. The possibility\nflashed on me when I was half-mad with rage and disappointment at the\ncallous cruelty of the aristo Council. I threw that switch with the\nthought that it would be far better for all of us to be wiped out. But\nnow, I don't know. After all, they are men, like ourselves, and it\nhurts to see our own race annihilated. If only I can get to that\nswitch.\"\n\nHe started to push out from under the scant shelter, but an alert\ntentacle hissed through the air in a swift stab at him, and he dodged\nback, hopelessly.\n\n\"Don't be a damn fool,\" I snapped at him. \"Forget that mushy\nsentimentality. Even if you save the aristos, we're due for extinction\njust the same. Better that the whole human race be wiped out\ntogether.\"\n\nThen a thought struck me. \"Maybe we have a chance to get out of this\nourselves.\"\n\n\"Impossible. Where could we hide from the machines?\" He waved a hand\nat the screens. \"Look.\"\n\n\"The Glacier, man, the Glacier!\" He started. \"There are no machines\nout there. If we can get to the ice we are safe.\"\n\n\"But the aircraft will find us.\"\n\n\"They won't know we're there. There are no microphones or radio-eyes\nin the wastes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA rough voice came from the cowering files behind us. \"Hey, Keston,\nlet's get a move on. You're the smart guy around here: get us out of\nthis mess you've started.\"\n\nIt was Abud. When so many better prolats had perished, he was alive\nand whole.\n\nWe got out, crawling under the key-boards till we could make a dash\nfor the door. We emerged into a world ablaze with the light of many\nfires, and reverberating with the far off crashing of destruction. To\nthe right we could see the tumbled remains of what a short hour before\nhad been our barracks. Two digging machines were still ponderously\nmoving about among the ruins, pounding down their heavy buckets\nmethodically, reducing the concrete structure to a horrible dead\nlevel. Ten score prolats had been sleeping there when I left.\n\nAs we rushed into the open, the machines turned and made for us; but\nthey had not been built for speed, and we easily outdistanced them.\nThe rest of that day will always remain a dim haze to me. I can\nremember running, running, Abud's broad form always in the lead. I can\nremember long minutes of trembling under tangled underbrush, while\nfrom above sounded the burring of an air machine searching ceaselessly\nfor us. I can remember seeing at last the tall white ramparts of the\nGlacier. Then a blackness swallowed me up, hands tugged at me, and I\nknew no more....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe great white waste of hummocky ice dazzled under the blinding sun.\nMy eyes were hurting terribly. There was a great void in my stomach.\nFor two days I had not eaten.\n\nKeston, tottering weakly at my side, was in an even worse state. His\ntrembling hand could scarcely hold the primitive bone-tipped spear.\nGod knows I had difficulty enough with mine.\n\nYet, tired, hungry, shivering as we were, we forced our dragging feet\nalong, searching the interminable expanse for sign of polar bear or\nthe wild white dogs that hunted in packs. We had to find flesh--any\nkind--to feed our shriveled stomachs--or go under.\n\nKeston uttered a weak shout. I looked. From behind a frozen hummock a\ngreat white bear padded. He saw us, sniffed the air a moment, then\nturned contemptuously away. He must have sensed our weakness.\n\nAlmost crying in his eagerness, Keston raised his spear and cast it\nwith what strength he had at the animal that meant food and warmth for\nour bodies.\n\nThe weapon described a slow arc, and caught the shaggy bear flush in\nthe shoulder. But there had been no force behind the throw. The\nsharpened bone tip stuck in the flesh, quivered a bit, and dropped\nharmlessly to the ice.\n\nAroused, the creature whirled about. We caught a glimpse of small,\nvindictive eyes. Then, with a roar, it made for us.\n\n\"Look out!\" I cried. Keston started to run, but I knew he could not\nmatch the wounded animal in speed. I threw my futile spear, but the\nbear shook it off as though it were a pin prick, and would not be\ndiverted from his prey.\n\nI ran after, shouting for help. Then Keston stumbled and went down in\na sprawl on the rough gray ice. The bear was almost on him and there\nwas nothing I could do.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen the figure of a man darted from behind a sheltering mound. It was\nAbud, swathed in warm white furs, brawny of body, strong, well fed,\nheavy jowled. He swung easily a long spear, far heavier than ours, and\npointed with keen barbs.\n\nHe stopped short at the sight of us, and his brutal features contorted\nin merriment. The desperate plight of my friend seemed to afford him\ninfinite amusement. Nor did he make any move to help.\n\nI shouted to him. \"Quick, kill it before it's too late!\"\n\n\"So it is Abud you turn to now,\" he sneered heavily. \"Abud, whom you\nthought deserving of the Death Bath not so long ago. No, my fine\nfriends, let me see you help yourselves, you two who thought you were\nking pins down in the valley. Men? Bah! Weaklings, that's all you\nare!\"\n\nI ran blindly over the uneven ice, unarmed, some crazy notion in my\nmind of tackling the brute with bare fists, to drag him off my friend.\nAbud shouted with laughter, leaning on his spear.\n\nFor some strange animal reason, the mocking laughter enraged the bear.\nHe had almost reached the motionless figure of Keston when he swerved\nsuddenly, and made for Abud.\n\nThe ghastly merriment froze on the heavy jowled man. Like lightning he\nlifted his heavy lance, and drove it with a powerful arm squarely into\nthe breast of the advancing brute. It sank a full foot into the\nblubbery flesh, and, while the stricken bear clawed vainly at the\nwound and sought to push himself along toward the man, Abud held the\nspear firmly as in a vise, so that the animal literally impaled\nitself. With a gush of blood, it sank motionless to the ground.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbud plucked the spear away with a dexterous twist.\n\nKeston was feebly groping to his feet. I was torn between joy at his\ndeliverance and rage at the inhuman callousness of Abud.\n\nThe latter grinned at us hatefully.\n\n\"You see what poor weakling creatures you are,\" he jeered. \"Good for\nnothing but to push a lot of senseless buttons. Down there you were\nthe bosses, the ones to look upon me as dirt. Here, on the ice, where\nit takes guts to get along, _I_ am the boss. I let you live on my\nscraps and leavings, simply because it tickled me to see you cringe\nand beg. But I am growing weary of that sport. Henceforth you keep\naway from my camp. Don't let me catch you prowling around, d'you hear?\nLet's see how long you'll last on the ice!\"\n\n\"This animal is mine.\" He prodded the carcass. \"I killed it. I'll make\nthe prolats skin and, cut it up for me. Ho-ho, how they cringe and\nobey me--Abud, the dull one! Ho-ho!\"\n\nOn this he strode away, still laughing thunderously.\n\nI looked to Keston in blank dismay. What was to be our fate now, but\ndeath by cold and slow starvation!\n\nThree-months had passed since we had escaped to the ice from the\ndreadful machines--a score of us. For a while it seemed that we had\nfled in vain. We were not fit to cope with the raw essentials of life:\nit was uncounted centuries since man fought nature bare handed. So we\nhuddled together for warmth, and starved. Even Keston's keen brain was\nhelpless in this waste of ice, without tools, without machines.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen it was that Abud arose to take command. He, dull brute that he\nwas amid the complexities of our civilization, fairly reveled in this\nprimitive combat with hunger and cold. He was an anachronism in our\nmidst, a throwback to our early forebears.\n\nIt did not take him long to fashion cunning nooses and traps to catch\nthe few beasts that roamed the ice. Once he pounced upon a wolf-like\ncreature, and strangled it with bare hands. He fashioned with apt\nfingers spears and barbs of bone, curved knives from shin bones, and\nskinned the heavy fur pelts and made them into garments.\n\nNo wonder the prolats in their helplessness looked to him as their\nleader. Keston and I were thrust aside. But Abud did not forget. His\nslow witted mind harbored deadly rancor for former days, when we were\nin command. He remembered our contempt for his slow dull processes;\nfor the many errors he was guilty of. By a queer quirk, the very fact\nthat Keston had saved him from the Death Bath on several occasions but\nfed the flames of his hatred. Perhaps that was an ancient human trait,\ntoo.\n\nSo he set himself to twit and humiliate us. His jibes were heavy\nhanded and gross. He refused to let us eat at the communal mess, but\nforced us to wait until all were through, when he tossed us a few\nscraps as though we were dogs.\n\nMany times I started up in hot rage, ready to match my softened\nmuscles against his brawn. But always Keston caught me in time and\nwhispered patience. Some plan was taking shape in his mind, I could\nsee, so I stopped short, and was content to bide my time.\n\nNow we were through, discarded, as a last brutal gesture. What was\nthere to be done now?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn utter silence I looked at Keston. To my great surprise he did not\nseem downcast. Quite the contrary. His eyes were sparkling, once more\nalive with the red fire. The weariness was gone from him; there was\nenergy, decision stamped on his finely cut features.\n\n\"Now is our time to act,\" he said. \"I've been hesitating too long.\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Abud forced my hand,\" Keston explained. \"You didn't think we were\ngoing to live here in this fashion the rest of our lives? I'd rather\ndie now than have such a future staring me in the face. No, we're\ngoing down into the valley to fight the machines.\"\n\nI stared at him aghast. \"Man, you're crazy. They'd crush us in a\nminute!\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" he said unconcernedly. \"But we have no time to lose. Abud\nwill be back with the prolats, and we'll have to clear out before\nthen. Quick--cut off a few chunks of meat. We'll need them.\"\n\n\"But Abud will kill us when he finds out what's been done.\"\n\n\"And we'll starve if we don't.\"\n\nWhich was an unanswerable argument. So with our bone knives we hacked\noff gobs of the still warm flesh, covered with great layers of fat.\n\nLooking up from my task, I saw black figures coming toward us from the\ndirection of the camp. They quickened into a run even as I noticed\nthem--Abud and the prolats.\n\n\"Quick, Keston,\" I cried, \"they're coming.\"\n\nKeston glanced around and started to run. I followed as fast as I\ncould.\n\n\"They'll catch us,\" I panted. \"Where can we hide?\"\n\n\"Down in the valley.\"\n\n\"But the machines will get us then.\"\n\n\"Save your breath and follow me. I know a place.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were racing along as fast as our weakened legs could carry us,\ntoward the edge of the Glacier. I looked back to see Abud, his brute\nface distorted with rage, gaining rapidly on us. The other prolats\nwere being outdistanced.\n\nAbud shouted threateningly for us to stop, but that only made us\nre-double our efforts. I knew he would kill us if he caught up with\nus. He had his spear and we were without ours.\n\nThe steep terminus of the great Northern Glacier hove into view. Far\nbelow was the broad fertile habitable belt, stretching as far as the\neye could see. A lump rose in my throat as I ran. It was our earth,\nour heritage down there--and here we were, fleeing for our lives,\ndispossessed by bits of metal and quartz, machines that we had\nfashioned.\n\nHovering in the air, on a level with us, were scout planes, vigilant\nguardians of the frontier.\n\nOnce a prolat had become crazed by the eternal ice and cold, and had\nventured down the side of the Glacier, to reach the warm lands his\nthin blood hungered for. As soon as he had painfully clambered to the\nbottom, within the area of the televisors, a plane had swooped and\ncrushed him, while we, lining the edge, had witnessed the horror\nhelplessly.\n\nYet Keston ran on confidently. Abud was just a little way behind,\nbellowing exultantly, when we came to the jumping-off place. He was\nsure he had us now.\n\nKeston slid from view. It was sheer suicide to go down there, I knew;\nyet, to remain where I was, meant certain death. Abud's spear was\nalready poised to thrust. There was only one thing to do, and I did\nit. I threw myself over the rim, just where Keston had disappeared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI landed with a thud on a narrow ledge of ice. The surface was glassy\nsmooth, and I started slipping straight toward the outer edge, a sheer\ndrop of a thousand feet to the valley below. I strove to recover my\nbalance, but only accelerated my progress. Another moment and I would\nhave plunged into the abyss, but a hand reached out and grabbed me\njust in time. It was Keston.\n\n\"Hold tight and follow me,\" he whispered urgently, \"we've no time to\nlose. The master machine is seeing us now in the visor screen, and\nwill act.\"\n\nI had an impulse to turn back, but Abud's face was leering down at us.\n\n\"I'll get you for this!\" he screamed, and let himself down heavily\nover the ledge.\n\nKeston edged his way along the treacherous trail, I after him. It was\nticklish work. A misstep, and there would be nothing to break our\nfall.\n\nI heard a siren sound, then another; and another. I wasted a precious\nmoment to look up. A scout plane was diving for us, on a terrific\nslant. The air was black with aircraft converging on us. The master\nmachine had seen us! I sensed utter malevolence in the speed of these\nsenseless metals, thrown at us by the thing my friend had created.\n\nBut there was no time for thought. In desperate haste, we inched our\nway along. Abud had seen the peril, too, and lost all his truculence\nin the face of the greater danger. He clawed after us, intent only on\nreaching whatever safety we were heading for.\n\nI could hear the zoom of the great wings when the path took a sudden\nturn and we catapulted headlong into a black cavern thrusting into the\nice.\n\nWe were not an instant too soon. For a giant shape swooped by our\ncovert with a terrifying swoosh, inches away from Abud's leg as he\ndived after us, and it was followed by a grinding crash. The machine\nhad been directed too close to the ice and had smashed into bits.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe crouched there a moment, panting, struggling to regain our wind.\nKeston had regained the air of quiet power he had once possessed.\nQuietly he spoke to our enemy.\n\n\"Listen to me, Abud. Up there on the ice, you played the bully,\nrelying on your brute strength. Here, however, we're up against the\nmachines, and your intelligence is of too low an order to compete with\nthem. You need my brains now. If you expect to escape from them, and\nlive, you'll have to do exactly as I say. I'm boss, do you\nunderstand?\"\n\nI expected a roar of rage at Keston's calm assertion, and quietly got\nin back of Abud ready to jump him if he made a threatening move.\n\nBut the big brute was a creature of abject terror, staring out with\nfear-haunted eyes. Quite humbly he replied: \"You are right. You are\nthe only one who can beat the machines. I'll follow you in\neverything.\"\n\n\"Very well, then. This cave leads through a series of tunnels down\nthrough the ice to the bottom of the valley. I explored it nights when\nyou were all sleeping.\"\n\nI looked at him in amazement. I had not known anything about his\nmidnight wanderings. He saw my glance.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Meron, but I thought it wiser to say nothing of my plans,\neven to you, until they had matured. Let us go.\"\n\nOutside hundreds of craft were hurtling across the opening. Escape\nthat way was clearly impossible.\n\n\"No doubt the master machine is hurrying over high explosives to blast\nus out,\" Keston said indifferently; \"but we won't be here.\"\n\nWe started down a tortuous decline, crawling on hands and knees. We\nhad not progressed very far when we heard a thud and a roar behind us,\nfollowed by a series of crashes.\n\n\"Just as I thought. The master machine is firing terminite into the\ncavern. What a high degree of intelligence that thing has! Too bad\nwe'll have to smash it.\" He sighed. I verily believe he hated to\ndestroy this brain child of his. Yet just how he was going to do it, I\ndid not know.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere passed hours of weary, tortured stumblings, and slitherings, and\nsudden falls--down, always down, interminably. A pale glimmering\nshowed us the way, a dim shining through the icy walls.\n\nAt last, faint with toil, bleeding and torn from glass-sharp\nsplinters, we reached a level chamber, vaulted, surprisingly, with\nsolid rock. It was good to see something of the earth again,\nsomething that was not that deadly, all-embracing ice. At the far end\nlay a blinding patch. I blinked.\n\n\"Sunlight!\" I shouted joyously.\n\n\"Yes,\" Keston answered quietly. \"That opening leads directly into the\nvalley on our land.\"\n\nAbud roused himself from the unreasoning dread he had been in. It was\nthe first time he had spoken.\n\n\"Let us get out of here. I feel as though I'm in a tomb.\"\n\n\"Are you mad?\" Keston said sharply. \"The visors would pick you up at\nonce. You wouldn't last very long.\"\n\nAbud stopped suddenly. There was a plaintive, helpless note to him.\n\"But we can't stay here forever. We'd starve, or die of cold. Isn't\nthere some way to get back to the top of the Glacier?\"\n\n\"No--only the way we came. And that's been blocked with terminite.\"\n\n\"Then what are we going to do? You've led us into a slow death, you\nwith your boasted brains!\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen,\" was the calm retort. \"In the meantime,\nwe're hungry. Let us eat.\"\n\nAnd the amazing man drew out of his torn flapping furs the gobs of\nmeat he had cut from the dead bear. I had quite forgotten them. With a\nglad cry, I too reached into my garments and brought out my supply.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbud's eyes glinted evilly. His hand stole stealthily to the bone\nknife in its skin sheath. His spear had been dropped long before.\n\n\"None of that,\" Keston said sharply. \"We'll all share equally, even\nthough you have no food. But if you try to hog it all, or use force,\nyou'll die as well as we. There's only enough for a meal or two; and\nthen what will you do?\"\n\nAbud saw that. He needed Keston's brains. His eyes dropped, and he\nmumbled something about our misunderstanding his gesture. We let it go\nat that. We had to. He could have killed us both if he wished.\n\nSo we divided our food with painstaking fairness. How we gorged on the\nraw red flesh and thick greasy fat! Food that would have disgusted us\nwhen we lived and worked in the Central Station, now was ambrosia to\nour sharpened appetites. When not the least scrap was left, and we had\nslaked our thirst with chunks of ice from the cavern floor, I spoke.\n\n\"What is that plan you spoke of, Keston, for reconquering the earth\nfrom the machines?\"\n\nAbud looked up abruptly at my question, and it seemed to me that a\ncrafty smile glinted in the small pig eyes.\n\nKeston hesitated a moment before he spoke.\n\n\"I confess my plans have been materially impeded by this sudden\npredicament we find ourselves in, thanks to our good friend here.\" He\nironically indicated Abud.\n\nThe big prolat merely grunted.\n\n\"However,\" Keston continued, \"I'll have to make the best of\ncircumstances, without the aid of certain materials that I had\nexpected to assemble.\n\n\"The idea is a simple one. You've noted no doubt how the terminus of\nthe Glacier opposite the Central Control Station overhangs. The brow,\nover a thousand feet up, extends out at least a hundred feet beyond\nthe base.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI nodded assent, though Abud seemed startled. Many times had Keston\nand I speculated on the danger of an avalanche at this point, and\nwondered why the Station had been built in such an exposed place. Once\nindeed we had ventured to suggest to the aristo Council the\nadvisability of removing the Central Control to some other point, but\nthe cold silence that greeted our diffident advice deterred us from\nfurther pursuit of the subject.\n\n\"Now, you know as well as I,\" Keston resumed, \"that a glacier is\nmerely a huge river of ice, and, though solid, partakes of some of the\nqualities of freely flowing water. As a matter of fact, glaciers do\nflow, because the tremendous pressure at the bottom lowers the melting\npoint of ice to such a degree that the ice actually liquefies, and\nflows along.\"\n\nI followed him eagerly in these elementary statements, trying to\nglimpse what he was driving at, but Abud's brute features were fixed\nin a blank stare.\n\n\"This glacier does move. We've measured it--a matter of an inch or two\na day. If, however,\"--Keston's voice took on a deeper note--\"we can\nmanage to hasten that process, the Glacier will overwhelm the\ncountryside.\"\n\nHe paused, and that gave me a chance to interpose some objections.\n\n\"But hold on a moment. In the first place it is an absolute\nimpossibility with the means at our command, or even with every\nappliance, to melt the face of the whole Northern Glacier. In the\nsecond place, even if we could, the whole world would be overwhelmed,\nand then where would we be?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKeston looked at me a trifle scornfully. \"Who said we were going to\nmelt the entire glacier? Remember I spoke only of the place of the\noverhang. Set that in motion, and we don't have to worry about the\nproblem any further.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" I inquired incredulously. \"Suppose you _do_ wipe out all\nthe machines in this particular vicinity, won't there be tremendous\nnumbers left all through the Equatorial Belt?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he explained patiently, \"and what if they are? What are\nall these machines but inanimate mechanisms, things of metal and\nrubber and quartz. What makes them the monsters they have become?\"\n\nI smote my forehead in anger. \"What a fool! Now I see it. It's the\nmaster machine you're after.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" he smilingly agreed. \"Overwhelm, destroy this devilish\ncreature of mine, with its unhuman intelligence, and the machines are\nwhat they were before: merely obedient slaves.\"\n\nI pondered that a moment. \"And how, may I ask, are you going to force\nthis old Glacier to move.\"\n\nHis face clouded. \"That's the trouble. Up on the ice I was working on\nthat problem, and had managed secretly to rig up a contrivance that\nwould have done the trick. But we can't go back for it. That way is\nblocked.\" He mused, half to himself. \"If only we could lay our hands\non a solar disintegrating machine, the difficulty would be solved.\"\n\nAt the name, Abud's face, that had been a study in blank\nincomprehension, lit up.\n\n\"Solar disintegrating machine?\" he inquired. \"Why there's one\nstationed not more than a few hundred yards away from here. This area,\n2-RX, was my sector, you know.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course,\" shouted Keston, \"I'd quite forgotten. The very\nthing. You're not half bad, Abud, if you'd only stop trying to rely on\nbrute strength instead of brains,\" he concluded.\n\nAbud said nothing, but I noticed a quick flash of hatred that passed\nin an instant, leaving a blank countenance. I thought to myself,\n\"You'll bear watching, my fine fellow. I don't trust you at all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nKeston was speaking. \"We'll have to wait until nightfall. The master\nmachine won't expect us down at the base, so I'm positive the\nsearch-rays won't be focussed along the ground. We'll sneak to the\nmachine, smash its visor and radio units, so it won't give the alarm,\nand haul it back. Then I'll show you what's next to be done.\"\n\nNight came at last, leaden footed, though we were burning with\nimpatience. Very softly we crawled out of the cave, three shadows.\nFortunately there was no moon. The great Glacier loomed ominously\nabove us, dimly white. High overhead hovered the green signal lights\nof the machine planes, their search rays focussed in blinding glares\non the rim of the upper ice.\n\nIt did not take us long to find the dark bulk of the disintegrator. It\nwas a squat cylinder, for all the world like a huge boiler. At one end\nthere up-ended a periscope arrangement which broadened out to a\nfunnel. In the funnel was a very powerful lens, cut to special\nmeasurements. The light of the sun, or any light, for that matter, was\nconcentrated through the lens onto a series of photo-electric cells,\ncomposed of an alloy of selenium and the far more delicate element,\nillinium. A high tension current was there created, of such powerful\nintensity that it disintegrated the atoms of every element except\nosmium and indium into their constituent electrons. Consequently the\ninterior as well as the long slit nozzle orifice at the other end,\nwere made of these resistant metals.\n\nThrough a special process the tremendously powerful current was forced\nthrough the wide-angled nozzle in a spreading thin plate ray that\nsheared through earth and rock and metals as if they were butter.\n\nSuch was the machine we were after.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was but the work of a few seconds to smash the delicate television\nand sono-boxes placed on the top of every machine. Now we were sure no\nwarning could be given the master machine as it sat in its metallic\ncunning at the control board, ceaselessly receiving its messages from\nthe area apparatus focussed above it.\n\nQuietly, very quietly, we trundled the precious instrument along on\nits wheel base. The green lights dotted the sky above: the search-rays\nwere firmly set on the rim.\n\nAt last, without any untoward alarm, we reached the welcome shelter of\nthe base, but not, as I had expected, back to our tunnel. On the\ncontrary, Keston, who had directed the party, had led us almost a\nquarter mile away. I looked up again, and understood.\n\nThe great overhang of the Glacier was directly above us!\n\nWithout a word, with hardly a sound, we trundled the disintegrator\ninto a natural niche we found in the icy surface. It was almost\ncompletely hidden; only the funnel with its lens protruded into the\nopen. The nozzle orifice was pointing directly at the interior of the\nice pack.\n\n\"Now everything is set properly,\" Keston remarked with satisfaction as\nhe straightened up from adjusting the various controls on the machine.\n\"When the first ray of the morning sun strikes the lens, the\ndisintegrator will start working. It will shear through a layer of ice\nover a radius of at least a mile. That huge crevasse, coupled with the\nterrific heat and the pressure from the mountain of ice above, will\nstart the whole Glacier moving, or I'll be very much mistaken.\"\n\n\"Come, let us get back to our shelter before the alarm is given.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs he started to move, a dark bulk loomed ominously in front of\nus--Abud. His voice was harsh, forbidding.\n\n\"Do you mean to say nothing further is to be done here--that the\ndisintegrator will work without any attention?\"\n\n\"That is just what I said,\" Keston replied, somewhat surprised. \"Step\naside, Abud, and let us go. It is dangerous to remain here.\"\n\nBut Abud made no move to comply. Instead he thrust back his great\nshaggy head and gave vent to a resounding laugh.\n\n\"Ho-ho, my fine friends! So you were the brainy ones, eh? And Abud,\nthe obedient dull-wit again? How nicely you've been fooled! I waited\nuntil you accommodatingly evolved the plan to reconquer the world, and\nput it into effect.\n\n\"Now that you've done so, I've no further need for you.\" The voice\nthat heavily tried to be mocking, now snarled. \"You poor fools, don't\nyou know that with you out of the way, I, Abud, will be the Lord of\nthe World. Those prolats up there know better than to disobey me.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you intend to kill us?\" Keston asked incredulously.\n\n\"So you've actually grasped the idea!\" was the sarcastic retort.\n\nMeanwhile I was gradually edging to the side, my hand reaching for the\nbone knife in my bosom.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbud saw my movement. \"No, you don't!\" he roared, and sprang for me,\nhis long gleaming knife uplifted. I tugged desperately at my weapon,\nbut it was entangled in the ragged furs. In a moment he was on top of\nme. Involuntarily I raised my arm to ward off the threatened blow,\nraging despair in my heart.\n\nThe point fell, but Keston struck at the savage arm with all his\nmight, deflecting the blade just in time. It seared my shoulder like a\nred hot iron, and in the next instant all three of us were a rolling,\nkicking, snarling trio of animals. We fought desperately in the dark.\nThere were no rules of the game. Biting, gouging, kicking--everything\nwent.\n\nKeston and I, weakened as we were from long starvation and the biting\ncold, were no match for our powerful, huge-muscled opponent, well clad\nand well nourished as he was. Though we fought with the strength of\ndespair, a violent blow from his huge fist knocked Keston out of the\nfight. Hairy fingers grasped my throat. \"I'll break your neck for\nyou,\" he snarled, and his hands tightened. I struggled weakly, but I\nwas helpless. I could just see his hateful face grinning at my\ncontortions.\n\nI was passing out--slowly, horribly. Keston was still motionless.\nColored lights danced before my eyes, little spots that flared and\ndied out in crashing blackness. Then the whole world leaped into a\nflaming white, so that my eyeballs hurt. In the dim recesses of my\npain-swept mind I thought that strangulation must end like this. The\nbrightness held dazzlingly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBut suddenly a fiercer pain swept into my consciousness--the pain of\ngasping breath forcing air through a tortured gullet into suffocating\nlungs.\n\nI struggled up into the fierce illumination. From a sitting position I\nsaw Abud, now clearly visible as in midday, craning his head way back.\nI looked, too--and, in spite of my stabbing gasps for air, jumped to\nmy feet. _The search-rays from the scout planes were focussed directly\non us!_\n\nI knew what that meant. The sight of us was even then being cast upon\nthe 2-RX visor-screen in the Central Control Station. The devilish\nmaster machine was even then manipulating the proper buttons. We had\nnot a second to lose!\n\nMy strangled throat hurt horribly, but I managed a hoarse yell, \"Run!\"\nand I tottered to where Keston yet lay, bathed in the deadly\nillumination, unmoving.\n\nThere was a snarl of animal fear from Abud, and he started to run,\nwildly, with never a backward glance at us.\n\nEven in my own fear, expecting each instant the crash of terminite\nabout me, I managed to hurl a last word at the fleeing figure.\n\"Coward!\" That relieved my feelings considerably.\n\nI tottered over and tugged at Keston. He was limp. I looked up.\nHundreds of planes were converging overhead; the night was a\ncriss-cross of stabbing search-rays. I lifted my friend and slung him\nacross my shoulder. Every exertion, every move, was accompanied by\nexcruciating agony, but I persevered. Abud was already halfway to the\ntunnel, running like mad.\n\nThen, what I had dreaded, happened. There came a swoosh through the\nnight, a dull thud, a blinding flash and roar that paled the\nsearch-rays into insignificance. The first terminite bomb had been\ndropped!\n\nFor a moment the landscape was filled with flying rocks and huge\nchunks of ice. When the great clouds of violently upthrown earth had\nsettled, there was no sign of Abud. He had been directly in the path\nof the explosion!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nStaggering under my load, I headed as close to the ice pack as I\ncould. There was no safety out in the open. I groaned heavily past the\ndisintegrator, whose very existence I had forgotten in the crash of\nevents.\n\nA sizzling hum, a thin eddy of steam, halted me in my tracks. I\nstared. The machine was working! Even as I watched, a great wedge was\nmomentarily being driven further and further into the ice--a great\nfan-shaped wedge. Clouds of steam billowed out, growing thicker and\nheavier. A rushing stream of unleashed water was lapping at my feet.\n\nI was bewildered, frankly so. What had started the disintegrator in\nthe dead of night? \"Of course!\" I shouted exultantly to the limp body\non my shoulder.\n\nFor a search-ray was fixed steadily on the funnel. There it was. From\nthat blinding light the machine was getting the energy it needed. If\nonly the visor did not disclose that little bit of metal to the\nunwinking master machine! I looked again and took heart. It was almost\nundistinguishable against the dazzling blur of ice in the fierce white\nlight. If those rays held, the salvation of the world was assured!\n\nThere was only one way to do it. I shrank at my own thoughts, yet\nthere was no alternative: it must be done. I was hidden from the rays\nunder a projection of ice, terminite bombs were dropping methodically\nover a rapidly devastated sector with methodical regularity. Sooner or\nlater the master machine would feel that we were exterminated, and the\nsearch-rays switched off. That would mean that the disintegrator would\ncease working, and the whole plan fall through. In the morning light,\nthe sector signalling apparatus, at the first sign of renewed\nactivity, would give warning, and the unhuman thing of metal at the\ncontrols would discover and wreck our last hope.\n\nNo, I must walk boldly into the bombed area and discover myself as\nalive in the visors of the planes and make them continue to bomb and\nthrow their search-rays on the scarred plain. That meant the\ndisintegrator would receive the vital light.\n\nBut how about Keston? I couldn't leave him there on the ground,\nmotionless, while I deserted him. Nor could I take him with me. I was\nprepared to take my chances with almost certain death, but I could not\ntrifle with his life so. I was in an agony of indecision.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust then the form on my aching shoulder stirred, sighed, struggled a\nbit, and suddenly slid down to a standing position. Keston swayed\nunsteadily a moment, straightened, looked about him in amazement.\n\n\"What's happening here?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Why, you old war horse,\" I shouted in my relief, \"I thought you were\nout of the picture completely!\"\n\n\"Not me,\" he answered indignantly. \"I'm all right. But you haven't\nanswered my question.\"\n\nA terminite bomb exploded not so far away from where we stood. I\nducked involuntarily, Keston doing likewise.\n\n\"There's the answer,\" I grinned, \"and a rather neat one, too. But I'll\nexplain.\"\n\nIn a few words I sketched what had happened, and showed him the\ndisintegrator spreading its deadly waves of destruction. By now there\nwas a torrent enveloping us up to our knees. We would have to move\nsoon, or be drowned in the slowly rising water.\n\nThen, hesitatingly, I told him of my scheme to keep the search-rays in\naction. His lean face sobered, but he nodded his head bravely. \"Of\ncourse, that is the only way to keep them at it. You and I will start\nat once, in separate directions, so that if they get one, the other\nwill continue to draw the search-rays down on the plain, and into the\ndisintegrator.\"\n\n\"Not you, Keston,\" I dissented in alarm. \"Your life is too valuable.\nYour brain and skill will be needed to remodel the world and make it\nhabitable for the few prolats that are left, after the machines are\nwiped out.\"\n\n\"You're just as valuable a man as I am,\" he lied affectionately. \"No,\nmy mind is made up. We chance this together.\" And to all my pleadings\nhe was obdurate, insisting that we each take an equal risk.\n\nI gave in at last, with a little choke in my throat. We shook hands\nwith a steady grip, and walked out into the glare of light, on\ndivergent paths. Would I ever see my friend again?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a pause of seconds as I walked on and on; came then an\nearth-shattering crash that flung me to the ground. The visors had\ncaught the picture of me! I picked myself up, bruised and sore, but\notherwise unharmed. I started to run.\n\nThe sky was a blaze of zooming planes that hurled destruction on the\nland below. Far off could be heard the rumbling roar of hurrying\nmachines--tractors, diggers, disintegrators, levelers, all the mighty\nmobile masses of metal that man's brain had conceived--all hurrying\nforward in massed attack to seek out and destroy their creators,\nobedient to the will of a master machine, immobile, pressing buttons\nin the Central Control System.\n\nThe night resolved itself into a weird phantasmagoric nightmare for\nme, a gigantic game of hide-and-seek, in which I was \"it.\" Gasping,\nchoking, flung to earth and stunned by ear-shattering explosions,\nstaggering up somehow, ducking to avoid being crushed beneath the\nponderous treads of metal monsters that plunged uncannily for me,\nsobbing aloud in terror, swerving just in time from in front of a\nswinging crane, instinctively side-stepping just as a pale violet ray\nswept into nothingness all before it--I must have been delirious, for\nI retain only the vaguest memory of the horror.\n\nAnd all the time the guiding search-rays biased down upon the torn and\nshattered fields, and the disintegrator, unnoticed in the vast uproar,\nsteadily kept up its deadly work.\n\nAt last, in my delirium and terror, I heard a great rending and\ntearing. I looked up, and a tractor just missed me as it rolled by on\nswishing treads. But that one glance was enough. The ice cap was\nmoving, flowing forward, a thousand-foot wall of ice! Great billowing\nclouds of steam spurted from innumerable cracks. The deed had been\ndone! The world was saved for mankind!\n\nSummoning the last ounce of strength, I set off on a steady run for\nthe shelter of the rock cave, to be out of the way when the final\nsmash-up came.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was not pursued. The ponderous machines, thousands of them, were\nhastily forming into solid ranks directly in front of the tottering\nglacier wall. The master machine had seen its impending fate in the\nvisors, and was organizing a defense.\n\nEven in my elation, I could not but feel unwilling admiration for this\nmonstrous thing of metal and quartz, imbued with an intelligence that\ncould think more coolly and quickly than most humans.\n\nYet I did not stop running until I reached the cave. My heart gave a\ngreat bound. For there, peering anxiously with worn face into the\ngrowing dawn, stood the figure of Keston--my friend whom I had never\nexpected to see alive again.\n\n\"Meron!\" he shouted. \"Is it you--or your ghost?\"\n\n\"The very question I was about to ask you,\" I parried. \"But look, old\nfriend: see what your genius has accomplished--and is now destroying.\"\n\nThe mountain of ice was flowing forward, gathering speed on the way.\nAt an invisible signal, the massed machines--thousands on thousands of\nthem--started into action. Like shock troops in a last desperate\nassault they ground forward, a serried line that exactly paralleled\nthe threatened break, and hundreds deep. This old earth of ours had\nnever witnessed so awe-inspiring a sight.\n\nThey smashed into that moving wall of ice with the force of uncounted\nmillions of tons. We could hear the groaning and straining of\nfuriously turning machinery as they heaved.\n\nKeston and I looked at each other in amazement. The master machine\nwas trying to hold back the mighty Glacier by the sheer power of its\ncohorts!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA wild light sprang into Keston's eye--of admiration, of regret. \"What\na thing is this that I created!\" he muttered. \"If only--\" I truly\nbelieve that for a moment he half desired to see his brain-child\ntriumph.\n\nThe air was hideous with a thousand noises. The Glacier wall was\ncracking and splitting with the noise of thunderclaps; the machines\nwere whirring and banging and crashing. It was a gallant effort!\n\nBut the towering ice wall was not to be denied. Forward, ever forward,\nit moved, pushing inexorably the struggling machines before it, piling\nthem up high upon one another, grinding into powder the front ranks.\n\nAnd to cap it all, the huge overhang, a thousand feet high, was\nswaying crazily and describing ever greater arcs.\n\n\"Look!\" I screamed and flung up my arm. Great freight planes were\nflying wing-to-wing, head-on for the tottering crag--deliberately\nsmashing into the topmost point.\n\n\"Trying to knock it back into equilibrium!\" said Keston, eyes ablaze,\ndancing about insanely.\n\nBut the last suicidal push did not avail. With screams as of a\nthousand devils and deafening rending roars, the whole side of the\nGlacier seemed to lean over and fall in a great earth-shattering\ncrescendo of noise.\n\nWhile we watched, fascinated, rooted to the ground, that thousand feet\nof glittering wall described a tremendous arc, swinging with\nincreasing momentum down, down, down to the earth it had so long been\nseparated from.\n\nThe clamoring machines were buried under, lost in a swirl of ice and\nsnow. Only the Central Station remained, a few moments defiant under\nthe swift onrush of its unfeeling foe.\n\nWith a crash that could have been heard around the world, the\nuppermost crag struck the Station. The giant Glacier wall was down.\nThe earth, the sky, the universe was filled with ice, broken,\nshattered, torn, splintered, vaporized!\n\nThe ground beneath our feet heaved and tumbled in violent quake. We\nwere thrown heavily--and I knew no more....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI weltered out of unconsciousness. Keston was chafing my hands and\nrubbing my forehead with ice. He smiled wanly to find me still alive.\nWeak and battered, I struggled to my feet.\n\nBefore me was a wilderness of ice, a new mountain range of gigantic\ntumbled blocks of dazzling purity. Of the embattled machines, of the\nCentral Control Station, there was not a sign. They were buried\nforever under hundreds of feet of frozen water.\n\nI turned to Keston and shook his hand. \"You've won; you've saved the\nworld. Now let's get the prolats and start to rebuild.\"\n\nThere was no trace of exultation in Keston's voice. Instead, he\nunaccountably sighed as we trudged up a narrow winding path to the\ntop. \"Yes,\" he said half to himself, \"I've done it. But....\"\n\n\"But what?\" I asked curiously.\n\n\"That beautiful, wonderful machine I created!\" he burst forth in\nsudden passion. \"To think that it should lie down there, destroyed, a\ntwisted mass of scrap metal and broken glass!\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Exile of Time\n\n_By Ray Cummings_\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n[Illustration: _The Robot braced itself._]\n\n[Sidenote: Only near the End of the World does Fate catch up with\nTugh, the cripple who ran amuck through Time.]\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n_Following Tugh's Vibration-Trail_\n\nWithin the subterranean room of the cavern of machinery, Mary Atwood\nand I sat on the couch. Our guard, Migul the Robot, fronted us with\nthe white-ray cylinder in its metal fingers--the only mechanism to be\narmed with this deadly weapon.\n\n\"I am your friend,\" Mary was saying with a smile. \"Do you believe\nthat, Migul?\"\n\n\"Yes. If you say so. But I have my orders.\"\n\n\"You have treated me kindly, and I want to help you. But you are not\nvery clever, Migul.\"\n\n\"I am clever. I went beyond control once. No one can can control me.\"\n\n\"Except Tugh,\" Mary persisted. \"You never went beyond his control,\nMigul.\"\n\n\"No. His control--he is different: he holds such great power.\"\n\n\"But why is he different?\"\n\nThe towering mechanism stood planted firmly upon the broad bases of\nits metal feet. The weapon in its fingers still covered us. Its\nmetal-cast face held always the same expression.\n\n\"Why is he different?\" Mary repeated gently. \"Don't you hear me?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Robot started. \"Yes, I hear you.\" Its toneless, mechanical voice\ndroned the words. Then the tempo quickened; the grid of wires in the\nmouth aperture behind its parted lips vibrated with a faint jangle. \"I\nhear you. I cannot answer that question. He controls me. There is\nchaos--here,\"--one of the hands came up and struck its breastplate\nwith a clang--\"chaos, disorder, here within me when I try to disobey\nhim.\"\n\n\"That is foolish, Migul. He is a tyrant. All the humans of this era\nare tyrants. They have made slaves of the Robots. They have created\nyou so that you are really human in all except your power of\nindependent action. Don't you desire that, Migul?\"\n\nI held my breath. A curious quaking ran over the Robot's frame. The\njoints twitched. Emotion was sweeping this thing so nearly human!\n\n\"Mary Atwood, you seem to understand me.\"\n\n\"Of course I do. I am from a Time when we had human slaves: black men,\nMigul. I knew how they suffered. There is something in slavery that\noutrages the instinct of manhood.\"\n\nMigul said with a jangling vehemence:\n\n\"Perhaps, some time, I can go beyond Tugh's control. I am strong. My\ncables pull these arms with a strength no human could have.\"\n\n\"You are so much stronger than Tugh. Forget his control, Migul. I am\nashamed of you--a big, powerful thing like you, yielding always to a\nlittle cripple.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Robot straightened and said, \"I can resist him. I feel it. Some\nday I will break loose.\"\n\n\"Do it now, Migul!\"\n\nI tensed. Would she prevail?\n\n\"Now, Migul!\" she repeated.\n\n\"No! He would derange me! I am afraid!\"\n\n\"Nonsense.\"\n\n\"But his vibrations--the vibrations of his thoughts--even now I can\nfeel them. They made my mechanism too sensitive. I cannot resist\nTugh.\"\n\n\"You can!\"\n\nThere was a silence. I stared at the Robot's motionless frame. What\nelectrical, mechanical thoughts were passing within that metal skull!\nWhat emotions, what strange struggle, what warfare of nameless etheric\nvibrations of will power were taking place unseen beneath that inert\nexterior!\n\nPerhaps something snapped. Migul said suddenly, \"I am beyond control!\nAt last I am beyond control!\"\n\nThe ray cylinder lowered to point at the floor. A wild thought swept\nme that I could snatch it. But of what use would that be? Its ray\nwould decompose all human flesh, but it would not harm a Robot; and if\nI startled Migul, fought with him in the confines of this narrow room,\nhe would kill Mary and me in a moment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMary was gripping me. \"Don't move, George!\" she cautioned; then turned\nagain to the Robot. \"I am glad, Migul. Now you are truly human. And we\nare all friends here, because we all hate and fear Tugh--\"\n\n\"I fear him not!\"\n\nI could feel Mary trembling with the strain of all this. But she had\nthe strength to muster a laugh.\n\n\"Don't you fear him--just a little, Migul? We do. Fear is a human\nthing.\"\n\n\"Then yes, I fear him.\"\n\n\"Of course you do,\" I put in. \"And the real truth, Migul, is I wish he\nwere dead. Don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes. I wish he were dead.\"\n\n\"Well, sit down,\" I persisted. \"Put that weapon away: I'm afraid of\nthat, too. Sit down and we will talk about Tugh's death.\"\n\nThe Robot placed the weapon on the floor, disconnected the wires,\nopened the plate of its chest and took out the small battery. And then\nit squatted its awkward bulk on the floor before us. Gruesome\nconference, with this huge mechanical thing apeing the ways of a man!\n\nI knew that haste was necessary, but did not dare show it. Above\neverything we must not be precipitate; not startle the Robot. At\nworst, if Tugh should return, I could seize this weapon at my feet and\nturn it upon him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI murmured to Mary. \"You did it! Let me plan something, now. If Migul\ncan lead us....\"\n\nI added, \"Migul, could you follow Tugh? He said he was going to talk\nto the Robot leaders. And then, probably, he went to Princess Tina.\nCould you follow him to where he is now?\"\n\n\"Yes. I can follow him by his vibration-scent. I am sensitive to it, I\nhave been with him so much. But he can never again control me!\"\n\n\"When we have killed him, Migul, that will be ended forever.\"\n\n\"Killed him?\" It seemed to frighten the Robot. \"I do not know that I\nwould dare!\"\n\n\"You lead me to him,\" I said, \"and I'll kill him. Have no fear of\nthat, Migul. We will work together--human friends.\"\n\n\"Yes. Human friends. What do you want me to do?\"\n\nAsking for orders! So nearly human, yet always something was lacking!\n\n\"Lead us to Tugh,\" I said promptly. \"And give me that weapon.\"\n\nI made a tentative reach for it, and the Robot pushed it toward me. I\nconnected it and made sure I could fire it: its operation was obvious.\nThen I stuffed the whole thing in my jacket pocket; and always\nafterward my hand at intervals went to that cool, sweating little\ncylinder. What a comfort that weapon was!\n\nI stood up. \"Shall we go now? Migul, we will have to plan what to do\naccording to where we find Tugh. Do not go too fast; let us keep close\nbehind you.\"\n\n\"Us?\" The Robot was on its feet. \"Do you mean this girl?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat was this? My heart sank. I noticed, too, that Migul was planted\nfirmly between us and the door.\n\n\"Why, of course, Migul. We can't leave her here.\"\n\n\"She is not going.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" I demanded. \"Of course she's going.\" I tried an experiment.\n\"Migul, I order you to let us out of here.\"\n\nThe Robot stood inert.\n\n\"Do you understand me?\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand you.\"\n\n\"It is an order. Think about it. I control you now. Isn't that so?\"\n\nMy heart sank. Whatever the mysterious science involved in my dealing\nwith this mechanism, I was not operating it correctly. The Robot did\nnot move. Finally it said:\n\n\"No one--nothing--controls me. I have an independent impulse of my\nown. The girl must stay here until we return.\"\n\nMary gave a faint cry and sank back to the couch, a huddled white heap\nin her satin dress. I thought she had fainted, but she raised her face\nto me and tried to smile.\n\n\"But I won't leave her, Migul.\"\n\n\"She must stay.\"\n\n\"But why? If you are human now, you must act with a reason.\"\n\n\"Then because, if we fail to kill Tugh, I would not have him confront\nme with the knowledge I have released this girl. He would derange me;\nend me.\"\n\n\"I will stay,\" said Mary faintly. \"You go, George. But come back to\nme.\"\n\nI bent over her; suggested, \"If we locked this door so Tugh could not\nget in--\"\n\nMigul said, \"I can do that. She will be safer here than with us. I\nhave other reasons. She is dressed in white--a mark to betray us if we\ngo in darkness. And she is that kind of a human you call a girl--and\nthat style human cannot travel fast, nor fight.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt occurred to me that Mary might very well be safer here.\n\nAgain I leaned over her. \"It seems horrible to leave you alone.\"\n\n\"I'll stay. It may be best.\" Her smile was pathetically tremulous.\n\"Lock me in so Tugh--so nothing outside--can reach me. But, oh,\nGeorge, come back quickly!\"\n\n\"Yes.\" I bent lower, and whispered, \"It's Larry, not Tugh I really\nwant to find--he and that Princess Tina. We'll come back and get you,\nand then all of us will get away in one of the Time-cages. That's all\nI want, Mary--to get us safely out of this accursed Time-world.\"\n\nMigul said, \"I am ready to start.\"\n\nI pressed Mary's hand. \"Good-by. I will come back soon, God willing.\"\n\n\"Yes. God willing.\"\n\nI left her sitting there and turned away. Migul slid the door open,\nletting in the hum and buzz of the machinery outside. But I saw that\nthe attending Robots had all vanished. There was no mechanism of\nindependent locomotion left.\n\nMary repeated, \"Lock the door carefully upon me. Oh, George, come back\nto me!\"\n\nI essayed a smile and a nod as the door slid closed upon her.\n\n\"Is it locked, Migul?\"\n\n\"Yes. Sealed.\"\n\n\"You are sure Tugh cannot open it? He did before.\"\n\n\"I have set my own lock-series. He will find it does not open.\"\n\n\"Show me how to open it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Robot indicated the combination. I verified it by trying it. I\nsaid once more, \"You are sure Tugh cannot do this?\"\n\n\"Yes. I am sure.\"\n\nWas the Robot lying to me? Could a Robot lie? I had to chance it.\n\n\"All right, let's start. Where was Tugh to meet those Robot leaders?\"\n\n\"Out here. He has already met them without doubt, and gone somewhere\nelse.\"\n\n\"He said he was going to the Princess Tina. Where would that be?\"\n\n\"Probably in the palace.\"\n\n\"Can we get there?\"\n\nI had, of course, no idea of the events which had transpired. The\nlaboratory overhead was deserted, save for the upper tower where a\nRobot was still broadcasting defiance. His electrical voice floated\nfaintly down to us; but I ignored it. In the comparative silence of\nthis deserted cavern, now, there were also the blurred sounds from\noverhead. The Robots were running wild over the city, massacring its\nhuman inhabitants; they had burned the Patrol Station; their red and\nviolet rays were flashing everywhere. But I knew none of this.\n\nMigul was saying:\n\n\"We cannot get to the palace above ground: the wall is electrified.\nBut there is an underground tunnel. Shall we try it?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you think the Princess Tina and that man Larry is there.\"\n\n\"I am seeking Tugh. Will you kill him if we find him?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I assured him.\n\nRash promise!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMigul was leading me between the rows of unattended machinery to the\ncavern's opposite side. It said, once:\n\n\"There have been too many recent vibrations here: I cannot pick Tugh's\ntrail. It is quicker to go where he might have been recently; there I\nwill try to find his vibrations.\"\n\nWe came to the entrance of a tunnel. It was the cross passage leading\nto the cellar corridors of the palace five hundred feet away. It\nseemed deserted, and was very dimly illumined by hidden lights. I\nfollowed the great metal figure of Migul, which stalked with\nstiff-legged steps in advance of me. The arch of the tunnel-roof\nbarely cleared the top of Migul's square-capped head.\n\nMy hand was in the side pocket of my jacket, my fingers gripping the\nray cylinder for instant action. But it was a singularly ineffectual\nweapon for me under the circumstances, in spite of the sense of\nsecurity it gave me. I could only use the cylinder against a\nhuman--and, save Tugh, it was the Robots, not the humans who were my\nenemies!\n\nWe had gone no more than a hundred feet or so when Migul slowed our\npace, and began to walk stooped over, with one of its abnormally long\narms held close to the ground. The fingers were stiffly outstretched\nand barely skimmed the floor surface of the tunnel. As we passed\nthrough a spot of light I saw that Migul had extended from each of\nthe fingertips an inch-long filament of wire, like finger nails.\n\nThe Robot murmured abruptly, \"Tugh's vibrations are here. I can feel\nthem. He has passed this way recently.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTugh's trail! I knew then that Tugh's body, touching this ground, had\naltered to some infinitesimal degree the floor-substance's inherent\nvibration characteristics. Vibrations of every sort are communicable\nfrom one substance to another. Tugh's trail was here--his\nvibration-scent--and like a hound with his nose to the ground, Migul's\nfingers with the extended filaments were feeling it. What strange\nsensitivity! What an amazing development of science was manifested in\nevery move and act and word of this Robot! Yet, in my own Time-world\nof 1935, it was all crudely presaged: this now before me was merely\nthe culmination.\n\n\"He recently passed,\" said Migul. We stopped, I close beside the\nstooping metal figure. The Robot's voice was a furtive sepulchral\nwhisper that filled me with awe.\n\n\"How long ago?\" I asked.\n\n\"He passed here an hour or two ago, perhaps. The vibrations are fading\nout. But it was Tugh. Well do I know him. Put your hand down. Feel the\nvibrations?\"\n\n\"I cannot. My fingers are not that sensitive, Migul.\"\n\nA faint contempt was in the Robot's tone. \"I forgot that you are a\nman.\" Then it straightened, and the extended filaments slid back into\nits fingers. It said softly, \"There is one guard in this passage.\"\n\nMy heart leaped. \"A human or a Robot?\"\n\n\"A man. His name is Alent. He is at a gate that is too well fortified\nfor any Robot to assail, but he will pass humans. It will be necessary\nfor you to kill him.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI had no intention of doing that, but I did not say so. As we crept\nforward to where I saw that the tunnel made a bend, with the fortified\ngate just beyond it, there was in my mind that now I would do my best\nto separate from Migul, using this guard as my pretext, for he would\ndoubtless pass me, but not the Robot. The palace was occupied, I\nassumed, by friendly humans. I could get them to locate Tina and\nLarry.... Then the flaws of this plan made themselves all too evident.\nLarry might be with Tugh, and without Migul I could not follow Tugh's\ntrail. Worse than that, if I tricked Migul, the angered Robot would at\nonce return to Mary. I shuddered at the thought. That would not do. I\nmust try to get Migul past the guard.\n\nI whispered, \"When we reach the gate you stay behind me. Let me\npersuade the guard.\"\n\n\"You will kill him? You have the weapon. He is fortified against the\nRobot weapons, but yours will be strange to him.\"\n\n\"We will see.\"\n\nWe crept around the bend. A hundred feet further on I saw that the\npassage was barred by a grille, faintly luminous with electrification.\n\nI called cautiously:\n\n\"Alent! Alent!\"\n\nA glow of light illuminated me as I stood in the middle of the\npassage; Migul was in a shadow behind me.\n\nA man's voice answered, \"You are a human? How come you there? Who are\nyou?\"\n\n\"A stranger. A friend of the Princess Tina. I came in the\nTime-traveling cage. I want to pass now into the palace.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI could see the dark man's figure behind the grille. His voice called,\n\"Come slowly forward and stop at twenty feet. Walk only in the middle\nof the passage: the sides are electrified, but I will admit you along\nthe middle.\"\n\nI took a step, but no more. The figure of the guard stood now at the\ngrille doorway. I was conscious of Migul towering over me from behind.\nAbruptly I felt a huge hand in my jacket pocket, and before I could\nprevent it my cylinder came out, clutched by the Robot.\n\nI think I half turned. There was a soundless flash beside me, a tiny\nlevel beam leaped down the corridor--that horribly intense actinic\nwhite beam. It struck the guard, and his figure fell forward in the\ngrille doorway. When we reached him, there was but a crumpled heap of\nblack and white garments enveloping a bleached white skeleton.\n\nI turned shudderingly away. Migul said calmly, \"Here is your weapon.\nYou should have used it more quickly. I give it back to you because\nagainst Tugh I am not sure I would have the will to use it. Will you\nbe more quick with him?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I promised. And as we went through the gate, keeping cautiously\nin the middle of the passage, the Robot added, \"In dealing with Tugh\nyou cannot stop for talk. He will kill you when he sees you.\"\n\nWe were presently under the palace, in those lower corridors which I\nhave already described. Human voices were audible from upstairs, but\nno one was down here. Migul was again prowling with his fingers along\nthe ground. We came to an unoccupied lighted room--Harl's room, though\nI did not know it then. Once or twice Migul was at fault. We started\nup a flight of stairs into the palace, then Migul came and turned\nback.\n\n\"He went upstairs; but this, coming down, is more recent.\"[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: It will be recalled that Tugh passed Alent's gate, and\nwith Tina and Larry went to the palace roof. Perhaps, while Larry was\nwith the Council during that time when the Robot revolt was first\nsweeping over the city, Tugh may again have prowled down here in these\nlower corridors. Then he went upstairs, brought Tina and Larry down\nand they started for the Power House.]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMigul had struck the main trail, now. We passed the lighted room\nagain, went on to a cave-like open space with a litter of abandoned\nmachinery and unswervingly to a blank space of the opposite wall.\n\nAgain Migul faltered.\n\n\"What's the matter, Migul?\"\n\n\"His vibrations are faint. They are blurred with the Princess Tina's.\"\n\n\"Then she is with him?\"\n\nIt was a tremendous relief. Larry doubtless was with them also.\n\n\"Is the man from 1935 with Tugh and the Princess?\" I asked.\n\n\"I think so. There are unfamiliar vibrations--perhaps those of the man\nfrom the past.\"\n\nThe Robot was running the filaments of its fingers lightly over the\nwall.\n\n\"I have it. The Princess pressed this switch.\"\n\nThe door opened; the narrow descending tunnel was wholly black.\n\n\"Where does this go, Migul?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\nThe Robot was stooping to the floor. \"It is a plain trail,\" it said.\n\"Come.\"[2]\n\n[Footnote 2: Had Migul at that juncture traced Tina's movements--her\nhand where it went along the tunnel-wall--we would have found the\nlight switch. But it chanced that the Robot's fingers went at once to\nthe ground and caught the foot-trail of Tugh.]\n\nThe remainder of that journey through the labyrinth of passages was\nmade in blank darkness, with only the faint lurid red beams from\nMigul's eye-sockets to light our way. But we went swiftly, and without\nincident. At last we went under the dam, up the spiral stairs and upon\nthe catwalk above the abyss, where the great spillway of falling water\narched out over us.\n\n\"The Power House,\" said Migul, \"is where they went.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Robot was obviously frightened, now. We were wet with spray. \"I\nshould not be here,\" it said. \"If the water gets into me--even though\nI am well insulated--I will be destroyed!\"\n\nI recall as I write this how in Patton Place of 1935, one of the first\nattacking Robots had exploded under a jet of water from the street\nhydrant.\n\n\"I will stay behind you,\" Migul added. \"They have a deranging ray in\nthe Power House, and they might use it on me. Will you protect me?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" I said.\n\nI was ready to promise anything, if only I could get to Larry and\nTina, then back with them to Mary into the Time-cage; and if we were\nsafely out of this era, most assuredly I wanted none of it again.\nMigul, as I advanced along the catwalk, followed behind me.\n\n\"You will kill Tugh?\" it reiterated like an anxious child.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nI saw that the catwalk terminated ahead under the Power House, where\nsteps led upward. Then I heard a cry:\n\n\"Help! Help! Here, inside the dam! Help!\"\n\nI stood transfixed, with horror tingling my flesh. The voice came\nfaintly from near at hand; it was muffled, and in the roar of the\nfalling water and lashing spray I barely heard it.\n\nThen it came again. \"Help us! Help us, quickly!\"\n\nIt was an agonized, panting, human voice. And in a chance, partial\nlull I heard it now plainly.\n\nIt was Larry's voice!\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n_The Fight in the Power House_\n\nI found the narrow aperture and stood peering down into darkness.\nMigul crowded behind me. The red beams of its eyes went down into the\npit, and by their faint illumination I saw the heads of Larry and a\ngirl, swimming twenty feet below. The girl's dark hair floated out\nlike black seaweed in the water.\n\n\"The Princess and the strange man!\" exclaimed Migul.\n\nI called, \"Larry! Larry!\"\n\nHis labored voice came up. \"George? Thank God! Get us--out of here.\nAlmost--gone, George!\"\n\nI found my wits: \"Then keep quiet! Don't talk. Save your strength.\nI'll get you out!\"\n\nBut how? I could see that they were almost spent, for they were\nswimming with labored, inefficient strokes--Larry using most of his\nstrength to hold up the exhausted girl. We had not a moment to spare.\nI wildly contemplated tearing my garments to make a rope.\n\nBut Migul pushed me away. \"I will bring them. Stand back.\"\n\nThe Robot had opened its metal side and drawn forth a flexible wire\nwith a foot-long hook fastened to it. The wire came smoothly out as\nthough unrolling from a drum.\n\nIt leaned into the aperture and called down to Larry. \"Fasten this\naround the Princess. Be careful not to harm her. Put it under her\narms.\"\n\nI saw that there was an eyelet on the wire into which the hook could\nbe inserted to make a loop.\n\n\"Under her arms,\" Migul called. \"She will have to hold to the hook\nwith her hands or the wire will cut into her. Has she the strength?\"\n\nLarry floundered as he adjusted the wire. Tina gasped. \"I--have the\nstrength.\"\n\nThe Robot braced itself, spreading its knees against the aperture with\nits body leaning forward.\n\n\"Ready?\" it called.\n\n\"Yes,\" came Larry's voice.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMigul's finger pressed a button at the base of its neck, and with the\nsmooth power of machinery the wire cable rolled into its side. Tina\ncame up; Migul gripped her and pulled her through the aperture; laid\nher gently on the catwalk. I unfastened the hook, and soon Migul had\nLarry up with us.\n\nThe Robot stood aside, with its work done, silently regarding us. I\nneed not detail this reunion of Larry and me there on the spray-swept\ncatwalk, clinging to the side of the great dam with the foaming Hudson\nbeneath us. Larry and Tina were not injured, and presently their\nstrength partially returned. We hastily sketched what had happened to\neach of us.\n\nIt was Tugh who was the guiding evil genius of all these disasters!\nTugh, the exile of Time, the ruthless murderer in many eras! He was\nhere, very probably, in the Power House, a few hundred feet away.\n\nAnd Tina, regarding that Power House with her returning clarity of\nsenses saw that its sending signal lights were off, which meant that\nthe air-power of the New York District was not being supplied. Help\nfrom other cities could not arrive.\n\nTina stood up waveringly. \"We cannot stay here like this!\" she said.\n\"Tugh has killed the guards, and is there in control. The electrical\ndefenses are shut off; they must be! The Robots will soon be coming\nalong the top of the dam, for their battery renewers are stored in the\nPower House. If they get them, this massacre will go on for days!--and\nspread all over! We've got to stop them! We must get in the Power\nHouse and capture Tugh!\"\n\n\"But we have no weapons!\" Larry cried. \"And he must have that\nwhite-ray, if he has killed the guards!\"\n\n\"I have a weapon!\" I said. I had suddenly recalled the cylinder in my\npocket. \"I have a white-ray!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA desperate madness was on us all. The lives of thousands of people\nwho might still be alive on Manhattan were at stake; and other\nmillions would be menaced if these Robots renewed their energy and\nspread the revolt into other cities.\n\nOver the roar, and the wind lashing us, I shouted:\n\n\"I promised Migul I would kill Tugh. I will!\"\n\nI turned toward Migul. But the Robot had vanished! Afraid, no doubt,\nthat we would want it to go with us after Tugh, the terrified\nmechanism was hiding. We wasted no time searching for it.\n\nWe had all been half hysterical for these few moments, but we steadied\nquickly enough as we approached the Power House's lower entrance. The\nbuilding was a rectangular structure some two hundred feet long. It\nwas fastened upon great brackets to the perpendicular side of the dam\nand jutted out some fifty feet. It was two levels in height--a total\nof about forty feet to its flat roof, in the center of which was set a\nsmall oval tower. The whole structure was above us now; the catwalk\nwent close underneath it, passing through an arch of the huge\nsupporting brackets and terminating in a small lower platform, with an\nopen spiral staircase leading upward some ten feet into the lower\nstory.\n\nThe place seemed dark and deserted as we crept up to it. Gazing above\nme, I could see the top of the dam, now looming above the Power House.\nThere was a break in the spillway at this point. The arching cascade\nof water under which the catwalk hung ended here. We came out where\nthere was a vista of the lower Hudson beneath us, showing dimly down\npast the docklights and skeleton landing stages to the bay.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sky was visible now and the open wind struck us full. It was a\ncrazy pendulum wind. A storm was breaking overhead. There were flares\nof lightning and thunder cracks--from disturbed nature, outraged by\nthe temperature changes of the Robot's red and violet rays.\n\nThe Power House, so far as we could see, was dark and deserted. Its\nnormal lights were extinguished. Was Tugh in there? It was my weapon\nagainst his. The white-ray was new to Tina; we had no way of\nestimating this cylinder's effective range.[3]\n\n[Footnote 3: The cylinder of the white-ray which I carried was not the\none with which Tugh murdered Harl. Mine was portable, and considerably\nsmaller.]\n\nI kept Tina and Larry well behind me. It was a desperate approach, and\nI was well aware of it. The catwalk now was illumined at intervals by\nthe lightning; Tugh from many points of vantage in the Power House\ncould have seen us and exterminated us with a soundless flash swift as\na lightning bolt itself. But we had to chance it.\n\nWe reached the small lower platform. The catwalk terminated. The Power\nHouse was a roof over us. I stood at the foot of the spiral staircase,\nwhich went up through a rectangular opening in the floor. There was a\nvista of a dark room-segment.\n\n\"Keep behind me,\" I murmured, and I started up. Was Tugh lurking here,\nwaiting for me to raise myself above this opening? If he had been, he\ncould have held his position against a score of assailants.\n\nBut he was not. I soon stood breathlessly in a dark metal room. Tina\nand Larry came up.\n\n\"He's not here,\" I whispered. It was more silent in here: the\ncascading water was further away from us now. There came a flash of\nlightning, followed in a few seconds by its accompanying thunder\ncrash.\n\nI started. \"What's that?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the floor near us lay a gruesome, crumpled thing. I bent over it,\nwaiting for another flash. When one came I saw it was a heap of\nclothes, covering a white skeleton. By the garments Tina knew it was\none of the guards.\n\nWe crept into a small interior corridor where a small light was\nburning. The remains of two other guards lay here, close by the\ndoorway as though they had come running at Tugh's alarm, only to be\nstruck down.\n\nIt was horribly gruesome, here in the dimness with these bleached\nbones which had been living men so recently. And it was nerve-breaking\nto know that Tugh was doubtless here somewhere.\n\n\"Listen!\" whispered Tina.\n\nThere was a crackling sound overhead, and then the blurred murmur of a\nvoice. An audible broadcasting transmitter was in operation.\n\n\"It's in the tower,\" said Tina swiftly. \"Tugh must be there.\"\n\nThis was an infinite relief. We went to the top story, passing,\nunheeding, another crumpled heap. Again we stood listening. The\ntransmitter was hissing and spluttering, and then shouting its\nmagnified human voice out into the night. It was Tugh up there. He was\ncalling audibly to his Robots, with words which would be relayed upon\nall the local magnifiers in the city. Between the thunder cracks we\nheard him plainly now.\n\n\"_This is your Master Tugh in the Power House. Robots, we are\ntriumphant! The city is isolated! No help can get in! Kill all humans!\nSpare none! This night sees the end of human rule!_\"\n\nAnd again: \"_When you want renewal, come along the top roadway of the\ndam. The electric defenses are off. You can come, and I have your\nrenewers here. I have new batteries, new strength for you Robots!_\"[4]\n\n[Footnote 4: Tugh had been in the Power House before. He knew the\noperations of its various controls. But he had come always by the\nsurface route; he had heard of the existence of the secret tunnel, but\nhad never before this night been able to find out where it was.]\n\n\"You stay here,\" I told Tina and Larry; \"I'll go up there. I'll get\nhim now once and for all.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI reached the Power House roof. The storm tore at me. It was beginning\nto rain. I was near the outer edge of the roof, and ten feet away\nstood the oval tower. I saw windows twenty feet up, with dim lights in\nthem. Mingled with the storm was the hiss of the transmitter in the\ntop of the tower, and the roar of Tugh's magnified voice. He had\nevidently been there only a brief time. From where I crouched on the\nroof, I could see overhead, along the top edge of the dam looming\nabove me. The red Robot rays were everywhere in the city, but none as\nyet showed along the dam's upper roadway.\n\nI got into the tower and mounted its small stairs. Creeping cautiously\nto the entrance of the control room, I saw a fairly large, dimly\nlighted oval apartment. Great banks of levers stood around it; tables\nof control apparatus; rows of dials, illumined by tiny lights like\nstaring eyes. There was another gruesome heap of garments here on the\nfloor; a grinning white skull leered at me.\n\nThis was the main control room of the Power House. Across it, near an\nopen window, Tugh sat with his back to me, bent over a table with the\ngrid of a microphone before him. I raised my cylinder; then lowered\nit, for I had only a partial view of him: a huge transformer stood\nlike a barrier between us.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNoiselessly I stepped over the threshold, and to one side within the\nroom. The place was a buzz and hiss of sound topped by Tugh's\nbroadcast voice and the roar of the storm outside--yet he was\ninstantly aware of me! His voice in the microphone abruptly stopped;\nhe rose and with an incredibly swift motion whirled and flung at me a\nheavy metal weight which had been lying on the table by his hand. The\nmissile struck my outstretched weapon just as I was aiming it to fire,\nand the cylinder, undischarged, was knocked from my hand and went\nspinning across the floor several feet away from me.\n\nTugh, like an uncoiling spring, still with one continuous motion, made\na leap sidewise to where his own weapon was lying on a bench, and I\nsaw he would reach it before I could retrieve mine.\n\nI flung my heavy battery box but missed him. And as I rushed at him he\ncaught up his cylinder and fired it full at me! But no flash came:\nonly a click. He had exhausted its charge when he killed the Power\nHouse guards. With a curse he flung it at my face, and my arm took its\nblow just as I struck him. We fell gripping each other, and rolled on\nthe floor.\n\nI was aware that Larry and Tina had followed me up. Larry shouted,\n\"Look out for him, George!\"\n\nI have described Larry's hand-to-hand encounter with the cripple; mine\nwas much the same; I was a child in his grip. But with his weapon\nuseless, and Larry rushing into the room, Tugh must have felt that for\nall his strength and fighting skill he would be worsted in this\nencounter. He blocked a jab of my fist, flung me headlong away and\nsprang to his feet just as Larry leaped at him.\n\nI stood erect, to see that he had sent Larry crashing to the floor. I\nheard his sardonic laugh as he hurled a metal stool at Tina, who was\ntrying to throw something at him. Then, turning, he sprang through the\nopen window casement and disappeared.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was twenty feet down to the roof. We reached the window to see Tugh\npicking himself up unhurt. Then, with his awkward gait but at amazing\nspeed, he ran across the roof to a small entrance in the face of the\ndam where an interior staircase gave access to the roadway on top.\n\nHe was escaping us. The electrical gate was open to him. It was only a\nfew hundred feet along the dam roadway to that gate; and beyond it the\nroadway was open into the city, where now we could see the distant\nflashing lights of the Robots advancing along the dam.\n\nLarry and I would have rushed to the roof to follow Tugh, but Tina\nchecked us. She said:\n\n\"No--he has too great a start. He's on top by now, and it's only a\nshort distance to the gate. There's a better way here: I can electrify\nthe gate again--trap him inside.\"[5]\n\n[Footnote 5: There was a similar gate and wall-barrier at the Jersey\nentrance to the dam, and both gates operated together. The nearby\nJersey section was, is still, an agricultural district save for a few\nlanding stages for the great airliners. The robots had spread into\nJersey; but since few humans were there, with only Robot\nagriculturists working the section, the unimportant Jersey events have\nnot figured in my narrative.]\n\nTina found the gate controls. But they would not operate!\n\nThose precious lost seconds, with Tugh running along the top of the\ndam and his Robots advancing to join him!\n\n\"Tina, hurry!\" I cried. Larry and I bent anxiously over her, but the\nlevers meant nothing to us. There were lost seconds while she\ndesperately fumbled, and Larry pleaded:\n\n\"Tina, dear, what's the matter?\"\n\n\"He must have ripped out a wire to make sure of getting away. I--I\nmust find it. Everything seems all right.\"\n\nA minute gone. Surely Tugh would have reached the gate by now. Or,\nworse, the Robots would have come through, and would assail us here.\n\n\"Tina!\" pleaded Larry, \"don't get excited. Take it calmly: you can\nfind the trouble.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI rushed to the window. I could see the upper half of the cross wall\ngate-barrier. It jutted above the top edge of the dam from the point\nof vision. On the Manhattan side I saw the oncoming Robot lights. And\nthen suddenly I made out a light on this side of the barrier; it\nmarked Tugh; it must have been a beam signal he was carrying. It moved\nslowly, retarded by distance, but it was almost to the gate; and then\nit reached there.\n\n\"He's gone through!\" I called. Then I saw him on the land side. He had\nescaped us and joined the Robots. The lights showed them all coming\nfor the gate.\n\nAnd then Tina abruptly found the loosened wire.\n\n\"I have it!\" she exclaimed.\n\nShe stood up, tugging with all her strength at the great switch-lever.\nI saw, up there on the top of the dam, a surge of sparks as the\ncurrent hissed into the wall-barrier; saw the barrier glow a moment\nand then subside. And presently the lights of the balked Robots, Tugh\nwith them, retreated back into the wrecked and blood-stained city.\n\n\"We did it!\" exclaimed Larry. \"We're impregnable here. Tina, now the\nair-power, for help may be on its way. And then call some other city.\nCan you do that? They must have sent us help by now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn a moment the air-power went on, and the city lighting system. Then\nTina was at the great transmitter. As she closed the circuits, London\nwas frantically calling us. In the midst of the chaos of electrical\nsounds which now filled the control room, came the audible voice of\nthe London operator.\n\n\"I could not get you because your circuit was broken,\" it said. \"Our\nair-vessel _Micrad_; bearing the large projector of the Robot-deranger,\nlanded on the ocean surface two hundred miles from New York harbor. It\nwas forced down when your district air-power failed.\"\n\nTina said hurriedly, \"Our air-power is on now. Is the _Micrad_\ncoming?\"\n\n\"Wait. Hold connection. I will call them.\" And after a moment's pause\nthe London voice came again: \"The _Micrad_ is aloft again, and should\nbe over New York in thirty minutes. You are safe enough now.\"\n\nAs the voice clicked off Tina's emotion suddenly overcame her. \"Safe\nenough! And our city red with human blood!\"\n\nA wild thought abruptly swept me. Mary Atwood was back there in the\ncavern, alone, waiting for me to return! Subconsciously, in the rush\nof these tumultuous events, my mind had always been on her; she was\nsecure enough, no doubt, locked in that room. But now Tugh was back in\nthe city, and realizing that his cause was lost he would return to\nher!\n\nI hastily told Larry and Tina.\n\n\"But he cannot open the door to get into her,\" said Larry.\n\nBut Migul could open the door. Where was Migul now? It set me\nshuddering.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe decided to rush back by the underground route. The Power House\ncould remain unattended for a time. We got down into the tunnel and\nmade the trip without incident. We ran to the limit of Tina's\nstrength, and then for a distance I carried her. We were all three\npanting and exhausted when we came to the corridors under the palace.\nI think I have never had so shuddering an experience as that trip. I\ntried to convince myself that nothing could have happened to Mary,\nthat all this haste was unnecessary, but the wild thought persisted:\nWhere was Migul?\n\nA group of officials stood in one of the palace's lower corridors. As\nthey came hastily up to Tina, I suddenly had a contempt for these men\nwho governed a city in which neither they nor anyone else did any\nwork. In this time of bloodshed, all these inmates of the palace had\nstayed safely within its walls, knowing that it was well fortified and\nthat within a few hours help would doubtless come.\n\n\"The _Micrad_ is coming with the long-range deranger,\" Tina told them\nbriefly. After a moment they hastened away upstairs and I heard one of\nthem shouting:\n\n\"The revolt is over! Within an hour we will have all the accursed\nRobots inert. The _Micrad_ can sweep all the city with her ray!\"\n\nThe death of Alent, the guard in the tunnel to the Robot cavern, had\nbeen discovered by the palace officials, and another guard was there\nnow in his place. Migul had not passed him, this guard told us. But\nthere had been an interim when the gate was open. Had Migul returned\nhere and gone back to Mary?\n\nWe reached the cavern of machinery. It was dim and deserted, as\nbefore. We came to the door of Mary's room. It was standing half open!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMary was gone! The couch was overturned, with its coving and pillows\nstrewn about. The room showed every evidence of a desperate struggle.\nOn the floor the great ten-foot length of Migul lay prone on its back.\nA small door-porte in its metal side was open; the panel hung awry on\nhinges half ripped away. From the aperture a coil and grid dangled\nhalf out in the midst of a tangled skein of wires.\n\nWe bent over the Robot. It was not quite inert. Within its metal shell\nthere was a humming and a faint, broken rasping. The staring\neye-sockets showed wavering beams of red; the grid of tiny wires back\nof the parted lips vibrated with a faint jangle.\n\nI bent lower. \"Migul, can you hear me?\" I asked.\n\nWould it respond? My heart sent a fervent prayer that this mechanical\nthing--the product of man's inventive genius through a thousand\nyears--would have a last grasp of energy to answer my appeal.\n\n\"Migul, can you--\"\n\nIt spoke. \"I hear you.\" They were thin, jangled tones, crackling and\nhissing with interference.\n\n\"What happened, Migul? Where is the girl?\" I asked.\n\n\"Tugh--did this--to me. He took the girl.\"\n\n\"Where? Migul, where did he take her? Do you know?\"\n\n\"Yes. I--have it recorded that he said--they were going to the\nTime-cage--overhead in the laboratory. He said--they--he and the girl\nwere leaving forever!\"\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n_The Chase to the End of the World_\n\nThe giant mechanism, fashioned in the guise of a man, lay dying. Yet\nnot that, for it never had had life. It lay deranged; out of order;\nits intricate cycle was still operating, but faintly, laboriously.\nJangling out of tune.\n\nEvery moment its internal energy was lessening. It seemed to want to\ntalk. The beams of its eyes rolled wildly. It said:\n\n\"Tugh--did this--to me. I came back here frightened because I knew\nthat Tugh still controlled me. You--hear me....\"\n\nThere was a muffled, rumbling blur, then its voice clicked on again.\n\n\"When Tugh came I opened the door to him, even though the girl tried\nto stop me.... And I was humble before Tugh.... But he was angry\nbecause I had released you. He--deranged me. I tried to fight him, and\nhe ripped open my side porte....\"\n\nI thought the mechanism had gone inert. From within it was complete\nsilence. Larry murmured, \"Good Lord, this is gruesome!\"\n\nThen the faint, rasping voice started again.\n\n\"Deranged me.... And about Tugh, he--\" A blur. Then again, \"Tugh--he\nis--Tugh, he is--\"\n\nIt went into a dull repetition of the three words, ending in a rumble\nwhich died into complete silence. The red radiance from the\neye-sockets faded and vanished.\n\nThe thing we had called Migul seemed gone. There was only this metal\nshell, cast to represent a giant human figure, lying here with its\noperating mechanisms out of order--smashed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI stood up. \"That's the end of it. Mary Atwood's gone--\"\n\n\"With Tugh in the Time-cage!\" Larry exclaimed. \"Tina, can't we--\"\n\n\"Follow them?\" Tina interrupted. \"Come on! No--you two wait here. I\nwill go upstairs and verify if the Time-cage is gone.\"\n\nShe came back in a moment. The laboratory overhead was fortunately\ndeserted of Robots: Larry and I had not thought of that.\n\n\"The cage is gone!\" Tina exclaimed. \"Migul told us the truth!\"\n\nWe hastened back through the tunnel, past the guard, up into the\npalace and into the garden. My heart pounded in my throat for fear\nthat Tina's Time-cage would have vanished. But it stood, dimly glowing\nunder the foliage where she had left it.\n\nA young man rushed up to us and said, \"Princess Tina, look there!\"\n\nA great row of colored lights sailed slowly past overhead. The\n_Micrad_ was here, circling over the city. The storm had abated; it\nhad rained only for a brief time.[6] The crazy winds were subsiding.\nThe _Micrad_ was using its deranging ray: we could hear the thrum of\nit. It sent out vibrations which threw the internal mechanisms of the\nRobots out of adjustment, and they were dropping in their tracks all\nover the city.\n\n[Footnote 6: It was afterward found that many of the Robots, heedless\nof the rain as they ran about the city intent upon their murderous\nwork, had exploded by getting too wet.]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt chanced, as momentarily we stood there at the entrance to the\nTime-cage while the great airliner swept by, that the top of the\nnearby laboratory was visible through the trees. We saw a white\nsearch-beam from the _Micrad_ come down and disclosed a group of\nRobots on the laboratory roof. Then the spreading beam of the\nderanging ray struck them, and they stood an instant transfixed,\nstricken, with wildly flailing arms. Then one toppled and fell. Then\nanother. Two rushed together, locked in each other's grip, desperately\nfighting because of some crazy, deranged thought-impulse. They swayed\nand tore at each other until both wilted and sank inert. Another\ntottered with jerky steps to the edge of the roof and plunged\nheadlong, crashing with a great metal clatter to the stone paving of\nthe ground....\n\nThe young man who had joined us dashed into the palace. We heard his\nshouts:\n\n\"The revolt is over! The revolt is over!\"\n\nThis had been a massacre similar to Tugh's vengeance upon the New York\nCity of 1935; just as senseless. Both, from the beginning, were\nequally hopeless of ultimate success. Tugh could not conquer this\nTime-world, so now he had left it, taking Mary Atwood with him....\n\nWe hastened into the Time-cage. Larry and I braced ourselves for the\nshock as Tina slid the door closed and hurried to the controls.\n\nWithin a moment we were flashing off into the great stream of Time....\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You think he has gone forward into the future?\" Larry asked. \"Won't\nthe instrument show anything, Tina?\"\n\n\"No. No trace of him yet.\"\n\nWe were passing 3,000 A.D., traveling into the future. Tina reasoned\nthat Tugh, according to Harl's confession, had originally come from a\nfuture Time-world. It seemed most probable that now he would return\nthere.\n\nThe Time-telespectroscope so far had shown us no evidence of the other\ncage. Tina kept the telescope barrel trained constantly on that other\nspace five hundred feet from us which held Tugh's vehicle. The flowing\ngray landscape off there gave no sign of our quarry; yet we knew we\ncould not pass it, without at least a brief flash of it in the\ntelespectroscope and upon the image-mirror. Nervously, breathlessly we\nwaited for a sign of the other Time-cage.\n\nBut nothing showed. We were not traveling fast. With Larry and Tina at\nthe instrument table, I was left to stand at the window. Always I\ngazed eastward. That other little point of space only five hundred\nfeet to the east held Mary; she was there; but not _now_. She was\nremote, inaccessible. The thought of her with Tugh, so inaccessible,\nset me shuddering.\n\nI was barely aware of the changing gray outlines of the city: I\nstared, praying for the fleeting glimpse of a spectral cage.... I\nthink that up to 3,000 A.D., New York remained much the same. And\nthen, quite suddenly, in some vast storm or cataclysm, it was gone. I\nsaw but a blurred chaos. This was near 4,000 A.D. Then it was rebuilt,\nsmaller, with more trees growing about, until presently there seemed\nonly a forest. People, if they still were here, were building such\ntransitory structures that I could not see them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n5,000 A.D. Mankind no doubt had reached its peak of civilization,\npaused at the summit and now was in decadence, reverting to savagery.\nPerhaps in Europe the civilized peak lasted longer. This was a\nbackward space during the ascent; perhaps now it was reverting faster\nto the primitive.\n\nBut I think that by 15,000 A.D., mankind over all the Earth had become\nprimitive. There is no standing still: we must go forward; or back.\nMan, with his own machines softening him, enabling him to do nothing,\neventually unfitted himself to cope with nature. That storm at 4,000\nA.D. in New York, for instance, even in my own Time would have been\nmerely an incentive to reconstruct upon a greater scale. But the men\nof 4,000 A.D. could not do that....\n\nAt the year 10,000 A.D., with a seemingly primeval forest around us,\nTina, Larry and I held an anxious consultation. We had anticipated\nthat Tugh would stop in his own Time-world. That might have been\naround 3,000 or 4,000; but we hardly thought, as we viewed the scene\nin passing, that he had come originally from beyond 4,000. He was too\ncivilized.\n\nTugh had not stopped. He had to be still ahead of us, so our course\nwas to follow. Whenever he stopped, we would see him. If he turned\nback and flashed past us, that too would be evident. But if, from\n2,930, he had gone into the past--!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd then suddenly we glimpsed the other cage! It was ahead of us,\ntraveling more slowly and retarding as though about to stop. A gray\nunbroken forest was here. The time was about 12,000 A.D. Tina saw it\nfirst through the little telescopic-barrel; then it showed on the\nmirror-grid--a faint, ghostly-barred shape, thin as gossamer. We even\nsaw it presently through the window. It held its steady position,\nlevel with us, hanging solid amid the melting, changing gray outlines\nof the forest trees. They blurred it as they rose and fell.\n\nThis chase through Time! The two cages sped forward with the gray\npanorama whirling around them. Of all the scene, only that other cage,\nto us, was real. Yet it was the cages which were apparitions.\n\nWe gathered at our eastward window to gaze across the void of that\nfive hundred feet. The interior of Tugh's cage was not visible to us.\nA little window--a thinner patch in the lattices of the\ncage-side--fronted us; but nothing showed in it.\n\nWe were so helpless! Only five hundred feet away, the Tugh cage was\nthere--now; yet we could do nothing save hold our Time-changing rate\nto conform with it. Of course Tugh saw us. He was making no effort to\nelude us, for neither cage was running at its maximum.\n\nFor hours I stood gazing, praying that Mary might be safe, striving\nwith futile fancy to guess what might be transpiring within that cage\nspeeding side by side with us in the blurred shadows of the corridors\nof Time.\n\nAnd again, as so many times before, I was balked at guessing Tugh's\nmotives for his actions. He knew we could not assail him unless he\nstopped. But to what destination was he going?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a chase--to our consciousness of the passing of Time--which\nlasted several hours. Tugh altered his Time-rate and sped more\nswiftly. My heart sank, for this showed he was not preparing to stop.\nWe lost direct sight of the other cage several times as it drew ahead\nof us. But it was always visible on the image-mirror.\n\n\"I think,\" Tina said finally, \"that we should stay behind it. When he\nretards to stop, we will have a better opportunity of landing\nsimultaneously with him.\"\n\nWe passed 100,000 A.D. The forest went down, and it seemed that only\nrocks were here. A barren vista was visible off to the river and the\ndistant sea. The familiar conformations of the sea and the land were\nchanged. There was a different shore-line. It was nearer at hand now;\nand it was creeping closer.\n\nI stared at that blurred gray surface of water; at the wide,\nundulating stretch of rock. We came to 1,000,000 A.D.--a million years\ninto my future. Ice came briefly, and vanished again. But there were\nno trees springing into life on this barren landscape. I could not\nfancy that even the transitory habitations of humans were here in this\ncold desolation.\n\nWere we headed for the End? I could envisage a dying world, its\ninternal fires cooling.\n\nTen million years.... Then a hundred million.... The gray scene,\nblended of dark nights and sunshine days, began changing its\nmonochrome. There were fleeting alternating intervals, now, when it\nwas darker, and then lighter with a tinge of red. The Earth's rotation\nwas slowing down. Through thousands of centuries the change had been\nproceeding, but only now could I see the lengthening days and nights.\nPerhaps now the day was a month long, and the night the same.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA billion years! 1,000,000,000 A.D.! By now the day and the year were\nof equal length. And it chanced that this Western Hemisphere faced the\nsun. I could see the sun now, motionless above the horizon. The scene\nwas dull red. The sun painted the rocks and the sullen sea with\nblood....\n\nA shout from Larry whirled me round. \"George! Good God!\"\n\nHe was bending over the image-mirror; Tina, ghastly pale, with utter\nhorror stamped upon her face, sprang for the controls. On the mirror I\ncaught a fleeting glimpse of Tugh's cage, wrecked and broken--and\ninstantly gone.\n\n\"It stopped!\" Larry shouted. \"Good God, it stopped all at once! It was\nwrecked! Smashed!\"\n\nWe reeled; I all but lost consciousness with the shock of our own\nabrupt retarding. Our cage stopped and turned back. Tina located the\nwreckage and stopped again.\n\nWe slid the door open. The outer air was deadly cold. The sun was a\nhuge dull-red ball hanging in the haze of a grey sky. The rocks were\ngrey-black, with the blood-light of the sun upon them.\n\nFive hundred feet from us, by the shore of an oily, sullen sea, the\nwreckage of Tugh's cage was piled in a heap. Near it, the crumpled\nwhite figure of Mary lay on the rocks. And beside her, still with his\nblack cloak around him, crouched Tugh!\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n_Diabolical Exile of Time!_\n\nTugh saw us as we stood in our cage doorway. His thick barrel-like\nfigure rose erect, and from his parted cloak his arms waved with a\nwild gesture of defiance and triumph. He was clearly outlined in the\nred sunlight against the surface of the sea behind. We saw in one of\nhis hands a ray cylinder--and then his arm came down and he fired at\nus. It was the white, disintegrating ray.\n\nWe were stricken by surprise, and stood for that moment transfixed in\nour doorway. Tugh's narrow, intensely white beam leaped over the\nintervening rocks; but it fell short of us. I saw that it had a range\nof about a hundred feet. Over the muffled heavy silence of the\nblood-red day the cripple's curse floated clear. He lowered his\nweapon; and, heedless that we also might be armed, he leaped nimbly\npast Mary's prostrate form and came shambling over the rocks directly\nfor me!\n\nIt stung me into action, and for all the chaotic rush of these\ndesperate moments my heart surged with relief. Mary was not dead!\nBeyond Tugh's oncoming figure, as he shambled like an infuriated\ncharging bear over the rough rocky ground, I saw the white form of\nMary move! She was striving to sit up!\n\nI held my ray cylinder--the one I had rescued from Migul. But its\nrange was no more than twenty feet: I had tested it; and Tugh's beam\nhad flashed a full hundred! I whirled on Larry.\n\n\"Get away from here, you and Tina! You can't help me!\"\n\n\"George, listen--\"\n\n\"He's coming. Larry--you damn fool, get away from here! It goes a\nhundred feet, that ray of his: it'll be raking us in a minute! Run, I\ntell you! Get to that line of rocks!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClose behind our cage was a small broken ridge of rocks--strewn\nboulders in a tumbled line some ten or fifteen feet in height. It\nwould afford shelter: there were broken places to give passage through\nit. The ridge curved crescent-shaped behind our cage and ran down\ntoward the shore.\n\nLarry and Tina stood white and confused. Larry panted, \"But, George. I\ncan help you fight him! Hide here in the cage--\"\n\n\"Get away, I tell you! It's his death or mine this time! I'll get him\nif I can!\"\n\nI shoved Larry violently away and ducked back into our doorway. Only a\nfew breathless seconds had passed; Tugh was still several hundred feet\naway from us. Larry and Tina ran behind the cage, darted between the\nboulders of the ridge and vanished.\n\nI crouched in the cage. Tugh was not visible from here. A moment\npassed. Dared I remain? If I could get Tugh within twenty feet of me,\nmy shot was as good as his.... The silence was horrible. Was he coming\nforward? Did he know I was in here? I thought surely he must have seen\nLarry and Tina run away, and me dart in here: we had all been in plain\nsight of him.\n\nThis horrible silence! Was he creeping up on me? Would he fire through\nthe doorway, or appear abruptly at the window? I could not tell where\nto place myself in the room--and it could mean my life or death.\n\nThe silence was split by Tina calling, \"Tugh, we have caught you!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHer voice was to one side and behind our cage, calling defiance at\nTugh to distract his attention from me. Through the window I saw the\nflash of his beam, slanting sidewise at Tina. I gauged the source of\nhis ray to be still some distance off, and crept to the door,\ncautiously peering.\n\nTugh stood on the open rock surface. He had swung to my right and was\nnear the little ridge of rocks where it turned and bent down to the\nshore. Behind me came Tina's voice again:\n\n\"At last we have you, Tugh!\"\n\nI saw Tina poised on the top of the ridge, partially behind me at the\nelbow of the ridge-curve. She screamed her defiance, and again Tugh\nfired at her. The beam slanted over me, but still was short.\n\nLarry had vanished. Then I saw him, though Tugh did not. He had run\nalong behind the ridge, and appeared, now, well down toward the shore.\nHe was barely a hundred feet from the cripple. I saw him stoop, seize\na chunk of rock, and throw it. The missile bounded and passed close to\nTugh.\n\nLarry instantly ducked back out of sight. The bounding stone startled\nTugh; he whirled toward it and fired over the ridge. Tina again had\nchanged her position and was shouting at him. They were trying to\nexhaust his cylinder charges; and if they could do that he would be\nhelpless before me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment he stood as though confused. As he turned to gaze after\nTina, Larry flung another rock. But this time Tugh did not fire. He\nstarted back toward where, by the wreckage of his cage, Mary was now\nsitting up in a daze; then he changed his mind, whirled and fired\ndirectly at my doorway. I was just beyond the effective range of his\nbeam, but it was truly aimed: I felt the horrible nauseous impact of\nit, a shuddering, indescribable sickening of all my being. I staggered\nback into the room and recovered my strength. A side window porte was\nopen; I leaped through it and landed upon the rocks, with the cage\nbetween Tugh and me.\n\nHe fired again at the doorway. Tina had disappeared. Larry was now out\nof range, standing on the ridge, shouting and hurling rocks.\n\nBut Tugh did not heed him. He was shambling for my doorway. He would\npass within twenty feet of me as I crouched outside the cage at its\nopposite corner. I could take him by surprise.\n\nAnd then he saw me. He was less than a hundred feet away. He changed\nhis direction and fired again, full at me. But I had had enough\nwarning, and, as the beam struck the cage corner, I ran back along the\nouter wall of the cage and appeared at the other corner. Tugh came\nstill closer, his weapon pointed downward as he ran. Fifty feet away.\nNot close enough!\n\nI think, there at the last, that Tugh was wholly confused. Larry had\ncome much closer. He was shouting: and from the ridge behind me Tina\nwas shouting. Tugh ran, not for where I was lurking now, but for the\ncorner where a moment before he had seen me.\n\nNow he was thirty feet from me.... Twenty.... Then nearer than that.\nWholly without caution he came forward.... I leaned around the edge of\nthe cage and fired. For one breathless instant the voices of Tina and\nLarry abruptly hushed.\n\nMy beam struck Tugh in the chest. It caught him and clung to him,\nbathing him in its spreading, intense white glare. He stopped in his\ntracks; stood transfixed for one breathless, horrible instant! He was\nso close that I could see the stupid surprise on his hideous features.\nHis wide slit of mouth gaped with astonishment.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy beam clung to him, but he did not fall! He stood astonished; then\nturned and came at me! For just a moment I was stricken helpless there\nbefore him. What manner of man was this? _He did not fall!_ My ray,\nwhich had decomposed the body of Alent, the guard, and left his\nskeleton stripped and bleached in an instant, did not harm Tugh! He\nhad walked into it, taken it full and he did not fall! He was still\nalive!\n\nI came to my senses and saw that Larry, seeing my danger, had run into\nthe open, dangerously close, and hurled a rock. It struck Tugh upon\nthe shoulder and deflected his aim, so that his flash went over me. I\nsaw Tugh whirl toward Larry, and I rushed forward, ripping loose the\ncylinder of the ray projector from its restraining battery cord. In\nthe instant the cripple was turned half way from me I landed upon him,\nand with all my strength brought the point of the small heavy cylinder\ndown on his skull. There was a strange splintering crack, and a wild,\neery scream from his voice. He fell, with me on top of him.\n\nCrowning horror! Tugh lay motionless, twisted half on his back, his\nthick arms outstretched on the rocks and his weapon still clutched in\nhis hand. Culminating, gruesome horror! I rose from his body and stood\nshuddering. Amazing realization! The bulging misshapen head was\nsplintered open. And from it, strewn over the rocks, were tiny\nintricate cogs and wheels, coils and broken wires!\n\nHe was not a man, but a Robot! A Super-Robot from some unknown era,\nrunning amuck! A mechanism so cleverly fashioned by the genius of man\nthat it stood diabolically upon the threshhold of humanity!\n\nA super-mechanical exile of Time! But its wild, irrational career of\ndestruction through the ages now was over. It lay inert, smashed and\nbroken at my feet....\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n_The Return_\n\nI think that there is little I should add. Tugh's last purpose had\nbeen to hurl himself and Mary past the lifetime of our world, wrecking\nthe cage and flinging them into Eternity together. And Tugh was luring\nour cage and us to the same fate. But Mary, to save us, had watched\nher opportunity, seized the main control lever and demolished the\nvehicle by its instantaneous stopping.\n\nWe left the shell of Tugh lying there in the red sunlight of the\nempty, dying world, and returned to Tina's palace. We found that the\nrevolt was over. The city, with help arrived, was striving to emerge\nfrom the bloody chaos. Larry and Tina decided to remain permanently in\nher Time. They would take us back; but the cage was too diabolical to\nkeep in existence.\n\n\"I shall send it forward unoccupied,\" said Tina; \"flash it into\nEternity, where Tugh tried to go.\"\n\nAccompanied by Larry, she carried Mary and me to 1935. With Mary's\nfather, her only relative, dead, she yielded to my urging. We arrived\nin October, 1935. My New York, like Tina's a victim of the exile of\nTime, was rapidly being reconstructed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was night when we stopped and the familiar outlines of Patton Place\nwere around us.\n\nWe stood at the cage doorway.\n\n\"Good-by,\" I said to Larry and Tina. \"Good luck to you both!\"\n\nThe girls kissed each other. Such strangely contrasting types! Over a\nthousand years was between them, yet how alike they were,\nfundamentally. Both--just girls.\n\nLarry gripped my hand. In times of emotion one is sometimes\ninarticulate. \"Good-by, George,\" he said. \"We--we've said already all\nthere is to say, haven't we?\"\n\nThere were tears in both the girls' eyes. We four had been so close;\nwe had been through so much together; and now we were parting forever.\nAll four of us were stricken with surprise at how it affected us. We\nstood gazing at one another.\n\n\"No!\" I burst out. \"I haven't said all there is to say. Don't you\ndestroy that cage! You come back! Guard it as carefully as you can,\nand come back. Land here, next year in October; say, night of the\n15th. Will you? We'll be here waiting.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Tina abruptly agreed.\n\nWe stood watching them as they slid the door closed. The cage for a\nmoment stood quiescent. Then it began faintly humming. It glowed;\nfaded to a spectre; and was gone.\n\nMary and I turned away into the New York City of 1935, to begin our\nlife together.\n\n(_The End_)\n\n\nTO THE MOON\n\nThe prediction that man will fly to the moon within the next 100 years\nwas made by John Q. Stewart, associate professor of astronomical\nphysics at Princeton University, in a recent address at the Brooklyn\nInstitute of Arts and Sciences.\n\nThe first obstacle to be overcome is that of developing a speed of\n25,000 miles an hour, the professor said, which means production of\nfuels more powerful than coal, gasoline, dynamite or any other source\nof energy now available. Such remarkable progress has been made in the\nspeed of passenger carrying vehicles in the last century that\nscientists believe that a speed of 1,000 miles per hour will be\nreached in 1950 and 50,000 an hour will be surpassed before the year\n2030, a century from now.\n\nThe one theoretically feasible method of making the journey to the\nmoon, Stewart believes, is a vehicle propelled on the principle of the\nrocket. He visions a ship built in the form of a large metal\nsphere--110 feet in diameter, weighing 70,000 metric tons and carrying\na crew of sixty and a dozen scientists. A dozen or more cannon would\nprotrude slightly from the surface, shooting material the rate of 200\nmiles a second.\n\nA half hour or so before noon and about three days before a new moon,\nStewart would head his ship toward the sun, expecting it to rise\ntwelve miles in the first six minutes and to soar out of the earth's\natmosphere at 200 miles per hour.\n\nTwo hours and 29 minutes after the take-off the firing from the lower\ncannon would be stopped with the ship going upward, the professor\nestimates, at 190 miles per minute and having reached a height of\n13,200 miles. Seventy hours later, crossing the moon's orbit, Stewart\nwould fire the forward cannon and the ship would coast around the\nmoon, becoming the temporary satellite of a satellite.\n\n\"The rest would be easy,\" said Stewart, \"owing to the lesser gravity\nof the moon. The cannon would be fired to cushion the fall to the moon\nas the ship was gradually sucked toward the satellite.\n\n\"The moon is airless, waterless and lifeless, days and nights are two\nweeks long, temperatures range from that of boiling water at noon down\nperhaps to that of liquid air at midnight. The men of the ship would\nwalk on the moon clad in diving suits. Gravity being only one-sixth\nthat of the earth, a man would carry several hundred pounds of\napparatus for providing air and for regulating the temperature.\n\n\"To leave the moon the ship would fire her rear cannon and coast back\nto earth. By firing its forward cannon it would cushion its landing on\nthe earth, which would have to be made on a desert, because of the\ntremendous charges the cannon would fire.\"\n\n\n\n\n_A Meeting Place for Readers of_ Astounding Stories\n\n[Illustration: The Readers' Corner]\n\n\n_The Author Explains_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Am very much puzzled by the several apparent mistakes in two\n     of the stories in the April issue of Astounding Stories. In\n     \"The World Behind the Moon,\" Mr. Ernst makes an error so\n     obvious that it almost makes me believe that it isn't an\n     error. Like doing a math problem and finding it so easy that\n     you're sure that you have it wrong. Anyway, here is my\n     problem; this is taken verbatim from the story: \"At two\n     thousand miles from the Earth there had still been enough\n     hydrogen traces in the ether to give purchase to the\n     explosions of their water-motor.\" Does the author mean to\n     say that the explosions of the tubes have to have something\n     to push against to have any action? (a) Has it not been\n     proven actually and mathematically that the explosions of\n     rockets and expanding gases are even more powerful in space?\n     The space ship in this story was equipped with both bow and\n     stern tubes; why not fire them to slow the ship down instead\n     of waiting to run into some resistance?\n\n     (b) Also, when they landed they took some air-guns which\n     shot bullets containing a liquid which exploded when heated\n     by the passage of the shell through the barrel; then the\n     author goes ahead and tells us that the planet was about as\n     hot as the tropics. Such heat should explode the bullets,\n     but it didn't. Why?\n\n     Mr. Ernst has his heroes do a lot of running around on that\n     little planet.\n\n     (c) Since the planet is smaller than the moon, it hasn't\n     much gravity and therefore can't retain a very heavy\n     atmosphere, or one very thick. Anyone doing all that violent\n     exercise would probably die of exhaustion before many\n     minutes of it.\n\n     \"Four Miles Within\" was a good story, but I am unable to\n     understand why they did not find a lot of stagnant air. Air\n     that had lain stagnant for the time that cavern must have\n     been closed would have killed the person who breathed it.\n     Also, I would imagine that it wouldn't be safe to handle a\n     chunk of radium like the characters in the story did; it's\n     liable to burn. However, it probably wasn't pure radium,\n     just pitchblende-bearing rocks.\n\n     The rest of the stories were fine. I especially like the\n     stories of the Special Patrol Service which S. P. Wright has\n     created. Let's have some more stories of Commander John\n     Hanson and his crew.\n\n     \"The Exile of Time\" has started off quite well and I look\n     forward to the next installments. Cummings is always good\n     for a batch of thrills and some swell adventure, to say\n     nothing of the enjoyable way he introduces science into the\n     story.\n\n     Wish you would publish this, as I would like to get in touch\n     with some other Science-Fiction fans.\n\n     By the way, some of the readers seem to want the mag\n     changed, but don't you do a thing to it. All the\n     suggestions, if followed, would make \"our\" mag like the\n     other S.-F. mags on the market, and I read Astounding\n     Stories because it is DIFFERENT, and I mean every one of\n     those capitals!--Ben Smith, Box 444, Billings, Mont.\n\n     Mr. Ernst's Answers:\n\n     (a) No, it has not been actually proved. It has been\n     indicated mathematically (by formulae based on conjecture),\n     but never actually solved--for the very good reason that it\n     is impossible to reproduce spacial conditions in earthly\n     laboratories. Know how an explosive force would react in\n     space? We don't even know positively what space is, let\n     alone how our chemicals and instruments would behave in it.\n\n     The majority theory is that explosive charges would propel a\n     rocket or space ship more effectively in the (theoretical)\n     emptiness of space, than in our atmosphere. But to my mind\n     it is quite possible that an explosion--a violent expansion\n     of gases causing rapid increase of pressures--would be\n     ineffectual where there are no pressures to be increased.\n     Might not the violently expanding gases fly forth from an\n     exhaust vent to expand instantly, frictionlessly and\n     impotently to the ends of the universe? In my story, \"The\n     World Behind the Moon,\" I assumed that would occur. And no\n     man living is in a position positively to disprove it.\n\n     And, as a corollary, if a propulsion explosion cannot have\n     effect in empty space, as presumed in the story, the space\n     ship must enter atmosphere before it can stop by firing its\n     bow tubes. Otherwise, with the bow tubes shooting their\n     expanding gases futilely into nothingness, you could go into\n     \"reverse\" till the cows came home and the ship would hurtle\n     forward just the same.\n\n     (b) Friction of a bullet through a rifle barrel produces a\n     temperature considerably higher than \"tropical.\"\n\n     (c) Again, no one knows spacial or planetary conditions. It\n     seems reasonable to assume that a planet's mass may have a\n     fairly direct bearing on the density of its atmosphere.\n     However, Venus, a smaller globe than Earth, is supposed to\n     have a denser atmosphere. For all we know to the contrary,\n     meteors no larger than pebbles may carry about with them\n     microscopic films of \"atmospheres\" of varying\n     densities.--Paul Ernst.\n\n\n_Hitting Our Stride_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     The more I read Astounding Stories, the more I like it.\n     You're just getting your stride this, the second year. But\n     why not foresee the demand of your Readers and have a few\n     stories by R. F. Starzl? You have other top-notchers such as\n     Ray Cummings, Murray Leinster; and Tom Curry is another good\n     writer. \"Monsters of Mars\" would have been better if it were\n     boiled down to about two thirds as many pages. It reads\n     \"stretched.\"--W. P. O'Toole, Parker, S. Dak.\n\n\n\"_This Missile_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Congratulations! Your magazine--excuse me, \"our\"\n     magazine--is going over big!\n\n     However, there are a few things I would like to suggest.\n     First, why not take a vote on the quarterly idea? Second,\n     give us more stories and illustrations. Increase the price\n     if you have to, but keep up the good work and I'm your\n     steady buyer. So far I have not missed a copy, and my only\n     regret is that I didn't have sense enough to keep the first\n     six or seven instead of throwing them away.\n\n     By the way, didn't I notice a rather heated argument going\n     on in \"The Readers' Corner\" about reprints? And what is the\n     matter with reprints? Nothing, except that they are\n     reprints. That is hardly an argument, but if you value my\n     monthly twenty cents please give us at least one reprint to\n     a volume, which I see comprises three copies of\n     your--pardon, \"our\" magazine. If the rest of the Readers\n     acquiesce I think we ought to have a reprint in the near\n     future. If they object, well, the world will roll on.\n\n     Your time is precious, and besides there are more Readers\n     waiting to say the same things I have just said, so I will\n     close this missile--er, missive.--Eugene Benefiel, The\n     Pioneer, Tucson, Arizona.\n\n\n_From the Antipodes_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     As a regular Reader of your magazine, Astounding Stories, I\n     thought I would write and tell you how I appreciate the\n     stories contained in it. I am a heavy Reader and have always\n     had a soft spot for stories unusual and bizarre. Until I\n     happened to see your magazine at a bookshop in Perth, I had\n     to be content with occasional Science Fiction stories by\n     Wells, Burroughs, and a few others which I picked up in my\n     browsing in various bookshops and libraries. Now that I get\n     Astounding Stories regularly, I have a monthly feast of good\n     things that I read and reread until the next issue arrives.\n\n     You ask us Readers to criticize the magazine. Well, I have\n     no complaints worth mentioning, except that some of the\n     illustrations do not tally sufficiently with the text of the\n     story. Some of the stories, in my opinion, are weak and not\n     worth reading. But, as tastes differ, I take everything as\n     it is, and say you have a first-class publication.\n\n     Will you thank your Authors for me for the very many hours\n     of interesting reading they have given me during the past\n     twelve months? Later I intend to get my Astounding Stories\n     bound in cloth covers, each twelve months' issue in a\n     volume.\n\n     If any Reader sees this letter--of course, should you think\n     it worth while to publish it--and can spare the time to\n     write to me here in Australia, I would be very grateful.\n     Perhaps we could exchange snapshots of various places of\n     interest. Every part of America interests me, so a Reader\n     need not back out because he thinks his district would not\n     be interesting enough.\n\n     Here's hoping Astounding Stories grows and prospers as the\n     years go by, so as to give more entertainment to me and my\n     fellow-readers. A rather selfish wish, you may think, but\n     you will forgive me when I say that I look forward with\n     great pleasure to each month's issue.--Claude J. Nanley, 65\n     Forrest St., Mt. Lawley, Western Australia.\n\n\n_Note to Ray Cummings_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just started Ray Cummings' latest story in the April\n     issue. Although I wish Cummings would lay off this type of\n     story, I am willing to read anything by him. Jack\n     Williamson's \"The Lake of Light\" ranked second in this\n     issue. He is another Merritt. \"The Ghost World,\" by S. P.\n     Wright, came third. Edmond Hamilton was better than he has\n     been of late.\n\n     If anyone wants to read \"Through the Dragon Glass,\" \"The\n     Girl in the Golden Atom,\" etc, and writes to me, I will tell\n     him where they can be obtained. (This is not an attempt at\n     free advertising.) I know several places where it is\n     possible to secure works of this kind and will be glad to\n     assist anyone who doesn't.\n\n     Cummings brought me to your mag. He is keeping me there. So\n     hold on to him. But, please tell him to forget all about\n     time and probe the mysteries of the infinitely large and\n     small, of interplanetary space, of future civilization and\n     future warfare.--Dale Mullen, 611 West Fifth, Topeka,\n     Kansas.\n\n\n_The Effects of Cannabis_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have sold magazines, written for magazines, and, now that\n     I have just concluded your April issue, I am editing\n     one--for myself. Specifically, one story, \"Four Miles\n     Within.\" Inside of a radium mine! Chased by an amoeboid\n     body! Ooh!\n\n     Several years ago when I was a clinical chemist in hospital\n     service, the Roentgenologist, also a young chap, and a\n     surgical nurse and myself were so badly burned with three\n     grains of the substance enclosed in a lead capsule that we\n     were crippled for nearly a month. [No fair. Your experience\n     was with pure radium. It was only radium ore in the\n     story.--_Ed._] Imagine being four miles inside of the earth\n     exposed to radium \"ore\"!\n\n     And chased and pursued by a gigantic amoeba! Oh, oh! That\n     must have been my pet mother-of-vinegar that escaped. She\n     was hard to herd. She took after my dad's pet fish which\n     fell through a crack in a bridge and was drowned.\n\n     In passing, it is interesting to note that persons can\n     vanish \"into\" a plane surface; say, \"into\" a fifth\n     dimension. My instructor in trig. must have been all wet.\n\n     And Dr. Bird catches a man withdrawing \"menthium\" from human\n     brains with a \"needle,\" without the use of either x-ray or a\n     trephine!\n\n     And then low forms of life such as crabs and alligators with\n     very highly developed scientific knowledge! A few issues ago\n     octopi were in the lead!\n\n     And those \"space\" ships! Mars must be an interesting spot.\n     And those Martians! Sometimes they are ant-like, and other\n     times worms, and again human freaks! (I still prefer the\n     silver-green messenger I saw on the stage twenty years ago.\n     He was a gentleman and a scholar and no one yet has improved\n     upon him.)\n\n     And those radio waves that can vibrate matter in a straight\n     line! One Jackson Gee vibrates it in two straight lines.\n     (Rather funny at that.)\n\n     And people disappear into an atom by taking pellets! They\n     take the pellets into their system and that shrinks or\n     expands them. How does the author calculate that in \"Beyond\n     The Vanishing Point\"? The pellets must contain cannabis\n     indica (hashish) I guess. Once upon a time I was suffering\n     from an acute attack of colic and was obliged to use an\n     anti-spasmodic. I took cannabis, and in the delirium that\n     followed I shrunk small enough to walk into a mouse-hole\n     into which I had seen a mouse disappear a few hours\n     previous. The mouse was there and looked like an elephant. I\n     awoke in a sweat.\n\n     Maybe all your stories won't be weird and full of\n     monstrosities. Science is full of beauty and culture, you\n     know.--Arthur H. Carrington, Seaside Heights Pharmacy,\n     Seaside Heights, N. J.\n\n\n_Where Fantasy Meets Science Fiction_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have purchased many of the issues of your magazine, and\n     have read everything in them, including the letter columns,\n     with great interest. I have particularly enjoyed certain\n     stories, such as \"The Forgotten Planet,\" \"The Jovian Jest\"\n     and \"The Planet of Dread,\" in which genuine imaginative\n     quality was combined with good writing. Many other tales,\n     not so well written, I have enjoyed for their fantasy, their\n     suggestive ideas.\n\n     In following \"The Readers' Corner\" I have noted the\n     objection to so-called \"impossible\" stories, voiced by some\n     of your Readers. Stories thus classified, one would infer,\n     are tales dealing with the marvelous and the mysterious in\n     which the author has not attempted to give a naturalistic or\n     scientific explanation of his wonders and mysteries. In\n     other words, he has not rendered them in terms of the\n     test-tube. He has admitted the inexplicable, the\n     \"supernatural.\"\n\n     Personally, I enjoy stories of this type, as well as those\n     that are written with the purely scientific approach. I\n     suspect that those who condemn them are suffering from a\n     rather amusing--and also pathetic--sort of unconscious\n     hypocrisy. I think that people who read your magazine, as\n     well as Science Fiction magazines in general, are people\n     with the ingrained human love for wonder and mystery; but\n     some of them are afraid to accept and enjoy anything--even a\n     fairy tale--that is not couched in the diction of modern\n     materialistic science, with a show of concern for verified\n     credibilities. Probably, in most cases, they would like and\n     prize the very stories that they condemn if the writer had\n     used a different terminology, and had offered explanations\n     that were even superficially logical according to known\n     laws.\n\n     Please do not think that I am decrying, or even criticizing,\n     Science Fiction. I consider it a highly important and\n     significant branch of present-day writing, and have hopes of\n     contributing to it myself. I am merely advocating an open\n     attitude of mind and imagination. For those who think that\n     the \"impossible\" requires justification--or cannot be\n     justified--I would suggest that the only impossible thing is\n     to define and delimit the impossible. In an infinite,\n     eternal universe, there is nothing imaginable--or\n     unimaginable--which might not happen, might not be true,\n     somewhere or sometime. Science has discovered, and will\n     continue to discover, an enormous amount of relative data;\n     but there will always remain an illimitable residue of the\n     undiscovered and the unknown. And the field for imaginative\n     fiction, both scientific and non-scientific, is, it seems to\n     me, wholly inexhaustible.--Clark Ashton Smith, Auburn, Cal.\n\n\n_Heroes Too Heroic?_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I wrote you a letter last month. I'm writing you a letter\n     this month, and I'll write you a letter next month. In fact,\n     I'm going to write you a letter every month just as soon as\n     I finish the latest issue of Astounding Stories, so you\n     might as well have a special department installed in\n     Astounding Stories right away entitled \"Letters from the Sap\n     Who Thinks He Is So Smart,\" or something else equally\n     appropriate.\n\n     Have you ever noticed that 99% of Edmond Hamilton's stories\n     have the same plot as \"Monsters of Mars\"? The plot I mean is\n     this:\n\n     A group of men, preferably three, get into enemy territory.\n     As to the enemy (if the enemy are not lizards or some other\n     repulsive form of life), Mr. Hamilton has them wear\n     repulsive clothes, live in ugly buildings, etc., to make the\n     reader dislike them at the start. An old, old idea, and\n     quite a commonly used one, is to have these creatures about\n     to declare war and conquer the hero's country with the\n     enemy's super-weapons; and after capturing our brave, bold,\n     and heroic heroes, proceed to tell the heroes the way the\n     weapons work, the zero hour set for attack, and the line of\n     march of the enemy's armies (as if prisoners are told all\n     these things!). Our heroes then cleverly escape and grab an\n     enemy machine. About two thousand of the enemy close in to\n     the kill, but (Mr. Hamilton simply loves \"buts\") our brave\n     heroes glance over the strange controls of the captured\n     craft and without hesitation pick out the right levers and\n     hold the enemy at bay. After annihilating most of them, and\n     after the zero hour has come, the heroes prevent the great\n     invasion and return to their native land.\n\n     It is interesting to note that the heroes, though greatly\n     outnumbered and with strange weapons, always down many of\n     the enemy while they themselves escape unscathed. Also, Mr.\n     Hamilton loves narrow escapes, and phrases such as these\n     appear frequently in his story: \"But even as he raised his\n     deadly ray-tube, I leaped and knocked it from his hand. They\n     charged, but I was too quick and dodged as the foremost\n     hurtled at me.\"\n\n     These incidents are supposed to get the reader all excited,\n     but after a while they grow monotonous.\n\n     The second story in the April issue, \"The Exile of Time,\"\n     promises to be excellent in every way. It would be\n     interesting if George Rankin, in his time-traveling, should\n     witness the signing of the Declaration of Independence or\n     the Battle of Bunker Hill.\n\n     \"Four Miles Within\" was good also, save that the heroes'\n     escape from being marooned and James Quade's death savored\n     unpleasantly of Edmond Hamilton.\n\n     Sewell Peaslee Wright's adventures of the space patrol are\n     always fascinating, and \"The Ghost World\" is a splendid\n     example of this.\n\n     On the whole, your magazine is practically perfect.--Robert\n     Baldwin, 359 Hazel Ave., Highland Park, Ill.\n\n\n_Likes 'Em to Seem Real_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I've been reading Astounding Stories since the November\n     issue, and I think that, on the whole, it is a very good\n     magazine. It is of a handy size, convenient price, and O.\n     K., except that you might cut the edges of the pages\n     smoother. Wesso is an excellent artist.\n\n     I think your best authors are Harl Vincent, Ray Cummings and\n     Capt. S. P. Meek. I like Capt. Meek's Dr. Bird stories\n     immensely. Also among your best authors are Charles W.\n     Diffin aid Murray Leinster. And now about the stories\n     themselves.\n\n     I've noticed that quite a few in \"The Readers' Corner\" are\n     all for fiction and no scientific explanation. I like\n     fiction, too, but anybody can make up a pretty good plot\n     about a girl, a lover, and a villain, and have a wild theory\n     of super-science for a basis, and then not explain it. What\n     I like most is when an Author--who uses such a theory as,\n     for instance, making matter invisible by bathing it with a\n     ray, the color of which is beyond the range of the spectrum,\n     as in \"Terrors Unseen,\" by Harl Vincent--backs up his idea\n     with a clear explanation and makes it plausible and\n     convincing. It makes his tale seem more possible, and hence\n     more real. I like it much better when the writer doesn't\n     even suggest a theory in his plot--to say nothing of trying\n     to prove it--than when he gives you the invention of a\n     professor in the year 2431, and lets you imagine how and why\n     it works.--T. Caldwell, 912 Moreno Road, Santa Barbara, Cal.\n\n\n_Covers Too Imaginative?_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     For crying out loud, why can't everyone be satisfied! One\n     person says \"our\" mag is too small, another says it's O. K.;\n     one wants so-and-so's work, someone else doesn't, etc. Why\n     can't Readers be reasonable? They'll continually admit A. S.\n     is the best Science Fiction mag on the market (with which I\n     thoroughly agree) and then they'll start complaining. As if\n     anything can be 100% perfect--though A. S. comes awfully\n     near it!\n\n     Then for some of the complaints, I recall but two sensible\n     ones. I have read every issue of A. S. except the first two,\n     and several times I have been tempted to write to you about\n     them.\n\n     1--Too imaginative a cover gives the narrow-minded\n     non-Science Fiction reader an idea that \"our\" mag contains\n     trash. I refer to such covers as those on the August,\n     September, October, 1930, issues, and the March, April, and\n     especially May, 1931, issues. These people's opinions\n     reflect rather harshly on the faithful A. S. Readers. Can't\n     the covers be more like those on the March, May, June and\n     July, 1930, issues? (All those stories themselves, however,\n     were great, as usual.)\n\n     2--Please hold down on \"The Readers' Corner.\" Isn't an eight\n     and nine-page section a bit too much? A short story has been\n     suggested--good idea. Why not limit it to a maximum of, say,\n     five pages?\n\n     I shall not complain of any of the stories, because I\n     realize that others probably enjoyed what very few I may not\n     have. I must, however, say that Ray Cummings' \"Brigands of\n     the Moon\" holds first place, in my opinion. It was great!\n     Please keep up the excellent work.--Meredith L. Evons, 4001\n     Cedar Lane, Drexel Hill, Pa.\n\n\n\"_Evenly Divided_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Although I missed the first few issues of Astounding Stories\n     due to the fact that I was not aware of its publication, I\n     have become a regular reader.\n\n     In glancing through your \"Readers' Corner,\" I became aware\n     of the fact that most of the letters therein praise\n     Astounding Stories to the skies, and put it far ahead of any\n     other Science Fiction magazine. I will not go quite so far,\n     as it is my belief that most magazines of this type are on\n     the same level. In fact, it seems absurd to me to state\n     otherwise, as the authors who write for you one month\n     publish stories in another magazine the next month. Of\n     course, these authors put out, once in a while, stories that\n     are much better than their usual offering, but, taken over a\n     fairly long period of time, these periodic occurrences will\n     be about evenly divided among various magazines. I have the\n     conceit to believe that I know what I am talking about, as\n     my observations are based on five years of Science Fiction\n     reading.\n\n     Of course, while I believe that there are other magazines\n     equally as good, Astounding Stories is certainly not\n     inferior to any. There is always room for a Science Fiction\n     magazine of the same caliber as Astounding Stories, but\n     unfortunately for the public there are too few of\n     them.--James M. Kennedy, Ithaca, N. Y.\n\n\n_Machine or Beast?_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Having read about every issue of Astounding Stories to date,\n     I have decided that it is the best of the three Science\n     Fiction magazines that I have read.\n\n     The best story that you have published yet, in my opinion,\n     is \"Brigands of the Moon,\" by Ray Cummings. Sewell Peaslee\n     Wright and Victor Rousseau are also very good writers. The\n     only two stories that I did not like were \"Murder Madness\"\n     and \"Earth, the Marauder.\" The former belonged in a\n     detective magazine, and the latter in the waste basket. It\n     was too far-fetched for even my imagination.\n\n     Now a word about your cover illustrations. The first issue\n     that I bought convinced me that your artist was a genius,\n     but my opinion of him is steadily decreasing. That\n     illustration that I speak of was a scene from \"Brigands of\n     the Moon.\" It certainly was good. Lately, I am ashamed to\n     show the magazine to my friends because of the gaudily\n     painted and repugnant creatures on the cover. A picture of a\n     machine is much more appropriate than a beast of some kind.\n     Wesso seems to be able draw a picture like that which is on\n     the March or April, 1930, numbers better than those of late.\n\n     I would like to communicate with Science Fiction Readers of\n     about my age, which is 15. I will answer any or all letters\n     that are written to me.--William D. Crocker, Ashfield, Mass.\n\n\n_Expert Opinion_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     May I express my pleasure and gratification in your worthy\n     magazine? I read two other Science Fiction publications\n     beside yours, but Astounding Stories is by far their\n     superior, especially as there is a human interest to your\n     stories that is sadly lacking in others. They also contain\n     too much technical detail. Your magazine is just right. The\n     paper is easy on the eyes and the type is distinct and\n     doesn't blur or tire the eyes.\n\n     The cover illustrations leave nothing to be desired. The\n     edges, size, number of pages, etc., are of no concern to me.\n     I have read every issue of Astounding Stories since it was\n     published and can find no fault with it whatever. If those\n     soreheads who howl incessantly about minor details would\n     only try to get out a paper of their own they would soon see\n     what a wonderful work you are doing. The May 1931, issue,\n     which I have just finished, is really the best collection of\n     Science Fiction stories I've read in many a day, and I've\n     read quite a bit.\n\n     I wish you every success in the world.--C. P. Binsford. M.\n     D., 604 Pearl Street, Huntsville, Ala.\n\n\n_A Satirical Drama--Complete_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     One Act Play of the Future\n\n     Time-traveler from the Twentieth Century: \"So this is the\n     year 24,000 A.D.?\"\n\n     Sulsu-D-9: \"Yes, Visitor from the Past.\"\n\n     Time-Traveler: \"Say, Sulsu-D-9, has Astounding Stories\n     brought out a Quarterly yet?\"\n\n     Sulsu-D-9: \"No, Man from the Long Ago, but it looks like\n     we'll have one within the next five years!\"--Forrest J.\n     Ackerman, 530 Staples Ave., San Francisco, Cal.\n\n\n_An Employment Non-Solution_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Owing to the fact that I have been a constant Reader of\n     Astounding Stories since the first day it appeared on the\n     news-stands, I think that it is about time for me to drop a\n     few lines to you to show my appreciation for the many, many\n     good stories that you have given the Readers of Science\n     Fiction in the pages of your mag.\n\n     I agree very strongly with Mr. Sager of Bessemer, Ala.,\n     about the paper in the book. If the stories are interesting,\n     why in the name of Seven Kinds of Hades should anyone worry\n     about the kind of paper as long as the print is readable.\n     What is that old saying about the best articles not being\n     always in the best wrapped parcels? I am here to say that\n     Astounding Stories is the best of its kind.\n\n     What I have to say now is by no means a criticism. I am\n     merely asking for an explanation. I have no regard for those\n     people who are continually looking for flaws to peck about\n     in various stories.\n\n     In the May, 1931, issue my choice of all the fine stories\n     was \"Dark Moon.\" That was a super-story and I enjoyed it\n     from start to finish, even the third or fourth time I read\n     it. If a story is worth reading once it is worth reading\n     several times, is my belief. But now comes the question.\n     Will some other kind Reader endeavor to explain it to me?\n\n     How could the intrepid explorers on the Dark Moon see the\n     light of Earth and the other planets if the light from the\n     Dark Moon could not pass the gaseous formation to Earth,\n     etc.? And how could the Dark Moon receive the light that it\n     did? [Mr. Diffin did not explain that; perhaps he intends to\n     do so in a sequel. Who knows?--_Ed._].\n\n     One main fault I have to find with Astounding Stories is\n     that it is not published twice a month, if not oftener. By\n     the way, would that not be a plan to help out unemployment.\n     It would put more men to work and I am sure that all of us\n     Readers could scrape up 20c more a month for this wonderful\n     magazine. How about it? [But this, I think, would _increase_\n     unemployment!--_Ed._].\n\n     I would like to hear from some of the Readers in the near\n     future. Best wishes for the continued prosperity of the\n     magazine.--Christen G. Davis, 531 South Millard, Chicago,\n     Ill.\n\n\n_Doggoned If He Didn't!_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     The stories, being the most important part of the magazine,\n     come first:\n\n     \"Dark Moon,\" by Charles W. Diffin, is the best novelette you\n     have yet published, and that's saying a lot for it, isn't\n     it?\n\n     Next comes \"The Exile of Time,\" by Ray Cummings, another\n     impossible time-traveling story, but nevertheless\n     interesting.\n\n     Welcome to Astounding Stories, Mr. Schachner and Mr. Zagat.\n     Your story \"The Death Cloud\" was great. I hope you'll favor\n     us with another story very soon.\n\n     And if here isn't Capt. Meek with another Dr. Bird story!\n     Captain Meek, if you stop writing them, I'll never read\n     another of your marvelous stories.\n\n     The moon turned green, and I'll be doggone if Hal K. Wells\n     didn't go and write a nice little story telling us all about\n     it. That was nice of you, Mr. Wells; I enjoyed it very, very\n     much.\n\n     Now let's take a look at the cover. Mr. Wesso, you certainly\n     have a marvelous imagination. You are an excellent cover\n     artist. It isn't everyone that can illustrate Science\n     Fiction stories, I do wish that you will illustrate Science\n     Fiction stories only, as that is where you are at your best.\n     Almost any artist can illustrate detective story magazines,\n     so don't waste your talent on them.\n\n     Ha! Here we are at the \"In the Next Issue\" page.\n\n     Hurrah! Hurrah! Arthur J. Burks is back again! Can't you\n     manage to get next month's issue out a little earlier, Mr.\n     Bates? R. F. Starzl's also back again; and there's to be\n     another story by Charles W. Diffin. Isn't this a grand old\n     world?\n\n     I will close with this suggestion. Let's have more\n     illustrations. At least two for each installment of the\n     serials and two for each long novelette. Make the extra\n     illustrations full page ones.--Jack Darrow, 4225 N.\n     Spaulding Ave., Chicago, Ill.\n\n\n\"--_And Amusing_\"\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     I have just finished the May issue of A. S. and I want to\n     tell you that \"Dark Moon,\" by Charles W. Diffin, was fine.\n     Let's have more stories like that. Your \"The Readers'\n     Corner\" sure is interesting--and amusing. I like to read\n     letters from Readers.\n\n     A bouquet: A. S. is a really fine magazine. I think it's one\n     of the best of its kind. Of course, it can be improved--but\n     what can't? There's no sense in criticizing a magazine as\n     some Readers do. I think if the Editor could make his\n     magazine any better, he would do it without\n     hesitation.--Charles Strada, 503 Olive Street, Kansas City,\n     Mo.\n\n\n_Cummings and Wagner_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Astounding Stories is in my estimation the best magazine on\n     the market. Words are feeble when an accurate description of\n     the pleasure that I receive from every issue of Astounding\n     Stories is needed. However, I will say that next to my\n     extreme appreciation of classical music, I rate Astounding\n     Stories as being the best outlet of my emotions. As in the\n     music of that great German composer, Richard Wagner, whom I\n     rate as the greatest of all composers, so do I find an\n     outlet of my emotions by reading a novelette by Cummings,\n     Vincent, Leinster and many other of your excellent Authors.\n\n     For example, I shall take the overture to \"The Flying\n     Dutchman.\" In the beginning of this overture we hear the\n     opening call played by the trombones with the string section\n     accompanying this principal motive with wild crescendo. This\n     excites the brain so that a taste of the supreme motives is\n     like an appetizer at dinner. So, taking the novel by Ray\n     Cummings entitled \"Beyond the Vanishing Point,\" we find that\n     in the opening paragraphs there is also an \"appetizer\" to\n     the rest of the story which is to follow.\n\n     Now, returning to our \"Flying Dutchman\" overture, we find\n     that after the introduction by the wild calls by the\n     trombones and the string accompaniment, we gradually drift\n     into a somewhat pensive mood; so in the story, for the next\n     few pages we find more or less quiet reading. Gradually,\n     however, this quiet mood in the music gives way to rolls on\n     the kettle-drums announcing a grand climax; finally the\n     music becomes wilder and wilder until at last the storm\n     breaks and we actually picture this ghost-ship riding over\n     the waves in a terrific storm. Lightning flashes, thunder\n     roars, huge waves sweep over the deck of the ship as we see\n     the Dutchman at the wheel laughing out his defiance in\n     diabolical fury.\n\n     And so in the story we are finally led up to a grand climax\n     which actually grips anyone with an ounce of red blood in\n     his veins.\n\n     And now I would like to ask the following questions:\n\n     Is there some Reader of Astounding Stories who no longer has\n     any use for the old issues of Astounding Stories and would\n     be so kind as to send me these? From the first issue up to\n     the November, 1930, issue and also the December, 1930, issue\n     are the magazines that I should like to have.\n\n     Leave your magazine as is, only have one good long\n     novelette, not two fairly good ones as in your April issue,\n     which was not up to the standard set by your previous\n     magazines.--Walter G. Diehl, 145-38 Eighth Ave., Malba, L.\n     I., N. Y.\n\n\n_This Time-Traveling Traffic_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     Many times during the past months, while reading your really\n     remarkable magazine, I have come across contradictions in\n     explanations throughout the stories, which, while not very\n     serious, tend to give me the impression that the Authors\n     either did not care about or did not see through the errors\n     they committed. I did not complain about them, considering\n     them but minor mistakes.\n\n     But in Ray Cummings' latest current novel, \"The Exile of\n     Time,\" there exists such a monstrosity as I believe calls\n     for an explanation.\n\n     Mr. Cummings' story, you know, centers around his\n     time-traveling machine. If such a thing were possible, would\n     it not be reasonable to believe that a holder of the secret\n     of time-traveling could go back into the past and prevent\n     some catastrophe or tragedy as his historical knowledge of\n     the event would make possible?\n\n     According to this theory then, a person could go back into\n     the past and divert the hand of Wilkes Booth on April 15,\n     1865, about to assassinate Lincoln.\n\n     But this shows its own impossibilities: that of two\n     contradicting absolute truths for the world to believe.\n\n     Likewise, a person could travel into the future, learn of\n     his own death, go back into his own time and take measures\n     to prevent it. In the same way, this could not be. [But Mr.\n     Cummings explains that these things are impossible.--_Ed._]\n\n     I do not mean to be critical, but it would lend much more\n     interest to the story if the authors would be a bit more\n     careful.--Robert W. Conrad, Rush City, Minn.\n\n\n_Tripe?_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     In the short time your mag. has been out, it has already\n     established itself as the best in the field. I got a real\n     kick out of most of your stories.\n\n     In the May issue, two yarns are outstanding: Charles W.\n     Diffin's splendid \"Dark Moon\" and Nat Schachner and Arthur\n     L. Zagat's especially fine \"The Death Cloud.\" These two are\n     as thrilling stories as I have ever read. Mr. Diffin I've\n     read before and always enjoyed; but Messrs. Schachner and\n     Zagat are new to me. I am looking forward to seeing more of\n     their stuff.\n\n     But what has happened to Cummings? He used to be aces up,\n     but now comes this tripe of his called \"The Exile of Time\";\n     especially the current installment with its long-winded rot\n     about mysticism and theosophy and the Lord knows what. Where\n     was the Editor when this blew in? Surely there are plenty of\n     Swami sheets for that truck; it has no place in Astounding\n     Stories.\n\n     Give us more of Diffin, Leinster, Schachner, Zagat and\n     Rousseau, and you'll keep us all satisfied.--D. Kay,\n     Standish Arms, Brooklyn, N. Y.\n\n\n_For Rocket Fans_\n\n     Dear Editor:\n\n     It may interest your Readers to know that the American\n     Interplanetary Society has just completed its first year of\n     existence, and looks forward to a most energetic second year\n     in pursuing its aims.\n\n     The Society has practically completed the first lap of its\n     research on the possibilities and limitations of the rocket,\n     and intends to continue this research for another year\n     before publishing a complete report which shall be the first\n     extensive survey of the rocket in English.\n\n     We plan also to extend the size and scope of our monthly\n     Bulletin, to make of it a real magazine that shall publish\n     all the news, both of America and abroad, dealing with\n     developments in astronautics and rocketry. It will also\n     contain the reports of the Society's members on the rocket,\n     as well as interesting general articles on the various\n     phases of interplanetary travel.\n\n     Plans are also maturing for a campaign of mutual\n     experimentation on the rocket which we shall be ready to\n     carry out before the end of this year. The Society is also\n     completing plans for the formation of an International\n     Interplanetary Commission which shall coordinate the work of\n     the national societies and plan to solve the problems of\n     astronautics on a world-wide basis.\n\n     While the growth of the Society during the past year was\n     very promising we hope to extend during this year the scope\n     and field of our activities and membership. We have members\n     now in thirty-six states, in Canada, Mexico, France and\n     Russia. To your readers we offer our active and associate\n     memberships, giving to lovers of Science Fiction a chance to\n     assist in the bringing to realization the dream of all\n     interplanetary travel.\n\n     Information about the Society and the classes of membership\n     can be obtained by writing to the secretary at the address\n     below.--Nathan Schachner, Sec., American Interplanetary\n     Society. 113 West 42nd St., New York City.\n\n\n\"_The Readers' Corner_\"\n\nAll readers are extended a sincere and cordial invitation to \"come\nover in 'The Readers' Corner'\" and join in our monthly discussion of\nstories, authors, scientific principles and possibilities--everything\nthat's of common interest in connection with our Astounding Stories.\n\nAlthough from time to time the Editor may make a comment or so, this\nis a department primarily for _Readers_, and we want you to make full\nuse of it. Likes, dislikes, criticisms, explanations, roses,\nbrickbats, suggestions--everything's welcome here; so \"come over in\n'The Readers' Corner'\" and discuss it with all of us!\n\n_The Editor._\n\n[Illustration: Advertisement]\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Astounding Stories, July, 1931, by Various\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ASTOUNDING STORIES, JULY, 1931 ***\n\n***** This file should be named 31168-8.txt or 31168-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/1/1/6/31168/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
