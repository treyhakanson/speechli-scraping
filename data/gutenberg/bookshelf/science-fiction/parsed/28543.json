Many men\n    have dreamed of it. Certainly some of them have tried. This man\n    succeeded._\n\n\n     rex\n      ex\n machina\n\n _by ... Frederic Max_\n\n\n One final lesson--a dying man's last letter to his\n only son that completes the young man's education.\n\n\nMY DEAR SON:--\n\nThe doctors have left and I am told that in a few hours I shall die. In\nmy lifetime the world has progressed from the chaotic turmoil of the\nearly Atomic era to the peacefulness and tranquility of our present age,\nand I die content.\n\nFor ten years I have instructed you in all that you will need for the\nfuture. One final lesson remains to be taught.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOn the wall of my bedchamber hangs a citation \"from a grateful\ngovernment for services too secret to be herein set forth.\" In past\nyears you have asked me repeatedly about this citation, but each time I\nhave taken pains to avoid a direct answer. Now it is proper that you\nshould know.\n\nForty years ago I was an obscure Army captain stationed at the Armed\nForces Language School in Monterey, California. I had at that time just\ncompleted a tour of duty in Korea, a minor skirmish of that era, and\ndespite an excellent reputation for resourcefulness, I had drawn\nMonterey as my next assignment. An aptitude for foreign languages had\nled to an instructorship in the Russian department with additional\nduties instructing in the Slavic tongues.\n\nMy life was pleasant and uneventful, and it was with mixed emotions that\nI received orders to report to Washington for a new duty assignment.\nThe chain of events which precipitated those orders were to change the\nworld....\n\nFor while you and I were playing on the lawn of our Monterey home, an\nunknown Hungarian physicist working under Russian supervision had made a\nstartling discovery. Within a matter of days alarming rumors of his work\nreached Washington. Our embassies in Moscow and Belgrade reported\nfurious activity in the field of psychic research and large-scale\nexperiments in mass hypnosis. Four of us were selected to investigate\nthe rumors. Before we could commence our undertaking, word reached\nWashington that the rumors were now actualities. A device capable of the\nmass hypnosis of great segments of the world's population was rapidly\nreaching perfection.\n\nAfter three months of intensive grooming in the fields of physics and\npsychology, we four agents set out individually with orders to track\ndown and destroy both the scientist and his machine. I never saw the\nother three again....\n\nDuring the three months of schooling, other members of our vast\nintelligence organization had been engaged in laying the groundwork for\nour efforts. In December 1955, I slipped into Russia and took the place\nof a government official who felt that Western civilization offered\ngreater reimbursement than Soviet Communism.\n\nI entered into my new role with trepidation, but my fears were\nunfounded. Thanks to a remarkable resemblance (which was the original\nreason for my selection) and also due to a most thorough briefing, I\nfound myself making the substitution with ease. I pride myself on the\nfact that by diligent application I was able to increase my worth to the\nRussian government to the extent that I was shortly able to secure my\ntransfer to the psychological warfare section of the secret police. From\nthere it was a simple procedure to have myself assigned to what was\nknown as \"Project Parchak.\"\n\nThe device was in its final stage of development; only the problem of\nincreasing its effective range remained to be solved. Three weeks after\nmy assignment to the project, its successful conclusion was\naccomplished.\n\nIn June 1956, the Russian government ordered me to a small house on the\noutskirts of Braila, Hungary, where I was to attend a private showing of\nthe device. By design, I arrived one day early and made my way to the\nlaboratory immediately. Dr. Michael Parchak, the inventor, stood facing\nme as I entered. On a table between us lay a small complicated mechanism\nresembling a radio transmitter. But it was infinitely more than that.\nThe device was a thought generator capable of hypnotizing every thinking\ncreature on the face of the earth. The power of infinite goodness or\nevil which the machine embodied was terrifying to consider.\n\nI listened to Parchak's boasting with revulsion. Although he had the\nability to work for the ultimate good of mankind, this creature\nintended, instead, to use his newly found power for selfish\naggrandizement.\n\nI drew him out, let him explain the inner workings of his device--and\nkilled him. My orders were to destroy the machine. I disobeyed them.\nUtilizing the machine to make good my escape, I left Hungary and\nreturned to the United States. The citation which you have seen was only\none of the many honors which were bestowed upon me.\n\nA few weeks later I resigned my commission and retired to a country\nhideaway to experiment further with the device I was supposed to have\ndestroyed. The peace and tranquility in which we of the earth now live\nmarked the successful culmination of my experiments.\n\nYou will find the machine walled up in the North alcove of my\nbedchamber.\n\nYour education is now complete my son, use it well. Be kind to our slave\npeoples, the world is yours.\n\nYour affectionate father,\n\n                                                  FRANCIS I\n                                                  EMPEROR OF THE EARTH\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\n    This etext was produced from _Fantastic Universe_ May 1954.\n    Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.\n    copyright on this publication was renewed. Minor spelling and\n    typographical errors have been corrected without note.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Rex Ex Machina, by Frederic Max\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK REX EX MACHINA ***\n\n***** This file should be named 28543.txt or 28543.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/8/5/4/28543/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Stephen Blundell and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
