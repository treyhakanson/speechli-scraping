He had that\n     nicely taped. But there was the little matter of threading a wire\n     through a too-small hole while under zero-g, and working in a\n     spacesuit!_\n\n\nMacNamara ambled across the loading ramp, savoring the dry, dusty air\nthat smelled unmistakable of spaceship. He half-consciously separated\nthe odors; the sweet, volatile scent of fuel, the sharp aroma of\nlingering exhaust gases from early morning test-firing, the delicate\nodor of silicon plastic which was being stowed as payload. He shielded\nhis eyes against the sun, watching as men struggled with the last\nplastic girders to be strapped down, high above the dazzling ground of\nWhite Sands. The slender cargo doors stood open around _Valier's_ girth,\nawaiting his own personal O.K.\n\nThis flight would be the fourth for Major Edward MacNamara; as he neared\nthe great, squatting shock absorbers he could feel the tension begin to\nknot his stomach. He had, of course, been overwhelmed by the opportunity\nto participate in Operation Doughnut. The fact that he had been one of\nthe best mechanical engineers in the Air Force never occurred to him at\nthe time. He was a pilot, and a good one, but he had languished as C.O.\nof a maintenance squadron for nearly two years before he was given\nanother crack at glory. Now, he wasn't at all sure he was happy with the\ntransition. They needed master mechanics for Operation Doughnut, but he\nfelt they should be left on the ground when the towering supply rockets\nlifted.\n\nHe stopped, leaning against scaffolding as he saw a familiar figure turn\ntoward him. He cupped his hands before his face.\n\n\"Hey, douse that butt! Can't you ... oh, Mac!\" The commanding voice\ntrailed off in a chuckle. Better to clown his way through the\ninspection, MacNamara thought, than to let Ruiz notice his nervousness.\nThe co-pilot, Ruiz, walked toward him, still smiling. \"One of these\ndays, boy, you gonna go too far. Thought you were a real, eighteen carat\nsaboteur.\" He clapped MacNamara on the shoulder and gazed aloft. \"Good\nday for it. No weather, no hangover, no nothing.\"\n\n\"Yeah. You know, Johnny, I've been thinking about a modification for our\nbreathing oxy.\" He sniffed appreciatively.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Put a little dust in it, a few smells. That stuff we breathe is just\ntoo sanitary!\"\n\n\"I know what you mean. I sure begin to crave this filthy, germ-filled\nair after a few hours out there.\" They both smiled at the thought, then\nturned to the business at hand.\n\n\"By the way, Johnny, what're you doing out so early? Didn't expect to\nsee you cabbies before ten.\"\n\n\"I donno,\" the bronzed Ruiz replied. \"Went to bed early, woke up at six\nand couldn't drop off again. And here I am. Carl ought to be along\naround nine-thirty. Thought I'd help you preflight, if you want me to.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" He wanted nothing of the sort, but had the tact not to say so.\n\nEdward MacNamara was as familiar with the _Valier_ as he was with the\ntip of his nose. He had been on the scene when Dan Burke test-hopped the\nthird stage, had made improvements and re-routing jobs, and had\nmemorized every serial number of every bearing that went into _Valier_.\nAs Flight Engineer, he was supposed to.\n\nWith Johnny Ruiz helping a little and hindering a little, he finished\nhis tour of the cargo sections and grinned his approval to a muscular\nloading technician. \"They can button her up, sergeant. I couldn't do a\nbetter job myself.\" It was a compliment of the highest order, and they\nboth knew it.\n\nRiding the tiny lift down to ground level, MacNamara stopped them every\nten feet or so to circle the catwalks. He noticed Ruiz's impatience\nabout halfway down. \"No hurry, Johnny. I don't want another _Wyld_ on\nour hands.\" He knew he shouldn't have said it, but it slipped out\nanyway. Everyone tried to forget the _Wyld_ disaster, particularly the\nflight personnel. The _Wyld_, one of the first ships to be built, had\nmade only two orbits before being destroyed. Observers stated that a\ncargo hatch had somehow swung open when the _Wyld_ was only a thousand\nfeet in the air. At any rate, the pilot reported damage to one\nsecond-stage fin and tried to brake his way down. The _Wyld_ settled\nbeautifully, tilted, then fell headlong. The resultant explosion caused\nsuch destruction that, had there not been a number of men in orbit and\nwaiting for supplies, the project might have been halted, \"temporarily.\"\nIt was generally conceded that a more thorough preflight could have\nprevented the _Wyld's_ immolation.\n\nRuiz was noticeably quieter during the remainder of the inspection. The\nexternal check completed, MacNamara strapped a small flashlight to his\nwrist and began the internal inspection, jokingly called the autopsy.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour and over a hundred and fifty feet later, MacNamara wheezed as he\nswung over the bulkhead at the base of _Valier's_ third and top stage.\nHis aching limbs persuaded him to take a breather. After all, his\ncomplete inspection of the day before really made a final preflight\nunnecessary, and passing near the frigid oxygen tanks was a day's work\nin itself. He listened to the innumerable noises around and below him.\nThe clicks and hums near him meant that Ruiz, having given up following\nhim, was checking out the flight controls, with power on only in the top\nstage. From below came a vibrational rushing noise, nearly subsonic,\nwhich told him of the fueling operation. He thought of the electrical\nrelays governing the fuel input and shuddered. He violently disliked the\nidea of having hot wires near fuel of any kind, and rocket fuel in\nparticular.\n\nMacNamara swept his light over his wrist watch. Fifteen after. Logan\nshould be along soon, he thought, and hastened to finish checking the\nconduits, servos, pumps and hydraulic actuators below the cabin level.\nThis done, he crawled up the final ladder to the cabin, or \"dome.\"\n\n\"Well,\" cried a cheerful voice, \"if it isn't our grimy Irishman.\"\n\nMacNamara shook the sweat from his brow and muttered, \"Irishman, is it?\nHow about 'Logan'? That's a good Scandinavian name.\"\n\n\"How about Logan? He's great, as usual. Just look at me, Mac. What a\nspecimen!\" Logan, the inevitable optimist, bounced out of his\nacceleration couch and spread his arms wide as if to show the world what\na superman he, Carl Logan, was. The gesture and its intimations made\nMacNamara smile. Logan wasn't much over five feet tall, and his flight\nsuit made him look like a bald pussycat. His small physique covered a\nfantastic set of reflexes, however, and Logan's sense of humor was a\nquality of utmost importance. He hadn't an enemy in the world. His enemy\nwas out of this world by definition; Logan wanted to conquer space and,\nso far, was doing just that.\n\n\"O.K., O.K. Laugh. Just remember this, Gargantua; I may not be tall, but\nI sure am skinny.\" MacNamara smiled again, nodding agreement. \"Well,\ndon't everybody talk at once. How is she, Mac?\"\n\n\"With luck,\" answered MacNamara, \"we might get ten feet off the turf.\"\nHe paused for effect. \"Seriously, Carl, she never looked better. You\ncould take her up right now. Say, where's Johnny? I thought you'd just\nbe checking in to the medics; looks like everybody's early today.\"\n\n\"He's probably over in some corner, making out his will. He was down\nbelow a while ago with a face a mile long.\"\n\n_Probably_, thought Mac, _he's still thinking about the_ Wyld. _Why did\nI have to bring that up?_ Aloud, he said, \"I ought to check the ground\ncrew. Did you bring the forms?\"\n\n\"Nope. Just my magnificent self. If anything had gone astray, they'd\nhave told you.\"\n\n\"All the same, I think I'll go down and question the troops. Don't leave\nwithout me.\" He clambered out onto the catwalk, leaving the air lock\nopen. The sun was riding higher every minute. In a little over an hour,\nhe'd be a thousand miles away--vertically. The knot in his stomach began\nto form again. He wasn't scared, exactly; he kept telling himself\n\"excited\" was a nicer word.\n\nThe inspection forms signed, Mac held a short interrogation with the\ncrew chief. The grizzled lieutenant, commissioned because of his long\nexperience and responsibilities, gave _Valier_ a clean bill of health.\nEach engine of the booster stage had been fired separately, before dawn.\nA cubic foot of mercury seemed to roll from Mac's shoulders as he saw\nLogan and Ruiz lounging at the bottom of the lift; there wasn't anything\nto worry about. He recalled feeling the tension before the other three\nflights, then chided himself. _Ya, ya, scared-y cat. Well, why not? It's\na helluva risk every time you make a shot, in spite of all the\npropaganda. Hooey; if you didn't know everything's O.K., you wouldn't be\ngetting ready to make the shot. Yeah, but you never can tell_----He\nstopped his inward battle and forced some spring into his step as he\nmoved toward Logan and Ruiz.\n\n\"I've tried my best to abort this big bug, but I can't find anything\namiss.\"\n\n\"That's Granny MacNamara for you,\" jibed Logan. \"Always trying to find\nfault.\" He winked at Ruiz and rubbed his hands together. \"Well--tennis,\nanyone?\"\n\nMac knew without asking that Logan, for all his apparent indifference,\nhad painstakingly gone over every phase of the flight, checking\ndistribution, radar, final instructions from Operations, weather, _et\nal_. Ruiz, as usual, watched and took notes as Logan gathered data.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt minus fifteen minutes, the trio was in the dome, checking personal\nequipment, while outside, the scaffolding ponderously slid away, section\nby section.\n\nThere was little time for soliloquies of _to go, or not to go_; within\nthe quarter-hour, Captain Ruiz and Majors MacNamara and Logan would be\nin readiness for the final count-down. With the emergency bail-out\nequipment checked, the men busied themselves on another continuity test\nof the myriad circuits spread like a human neural system throughout the\nship. All relays, servo systems and instrument leads were in perfect\ncondition as expected, and the trio was settled comfortably in\nacceleration couches with minutes to spare.\n\nLogan contacted Ground Control a few seconds after the minus-three\nminute signal, informing all and sundry that Gridley could fire when\nready. MacNamara sighed, thinking that if Logan's humor wasn't exactly\noriginal, it was surely tenacious.\n\nThe ship was brought to dim half-life at minus one minute by Logan's\nagile fingers, and as the final countdown rasped in his headset, Mac\nfelt his innards wrestle among themselves.\n\n_Valier_ bellowed her enthusiasm suddenly, lifting her eight\nthousand-odd tons from the ground almost instantly. Inside, her\noccupants grimaced helplessly as they watched various instruments guide\ntiny pointers across calibrated faces. Mac's throat mike threatened to\ncrush his Adam's apple, weighing five times its usual few ounces. Of his\nsenses, sound was the one that dominated him; an intolerable, continuous\nexplosion from the motors racked his mind like tidal waves of formic\nacid. He forced himself to overcome the numbness which his brain cast up\nto defend itself. Then, as quickly as it had begun, _Valier_ fell\ndeafeningly silent; that meant Mach 1 was passed.\n\nIt was an eternity before stage one separated. The loss of the empty\nhulk was hardly felt as _Valier_ streaked high over the Texas border.\nRuiz, watching the radarscope, saw Lubbock slide into focus miles below.\n_Next stop, Fort Worth_, he thought. _I used to drive that in five\nhours._ The jagged line of the caprock told him they were well on their\nway to Fort Worth already.\n\nThe altimeter showed slightly over forty-two miles when stage two\ndetached itself. Logan, in constant contact with White Sands, was\ninformed that they were tracking perfectly as _Valier_ arrowed over\ncentral Texas toward rendezvous at the doughnut. The exhausted lower\nstages were forgotten now; only the second stage was of any concern\nanyway. The radar boys tracked it all the way down, ready to detonate it\nhigh in the air if its huge 'chutes wafted it near any inhabited\ncommunity.\n\nThe motors of stage three blasted for a carefully calculated few\nseconds, then cut out automatically. With the destitution of his weight,\nMac felt his spirits soar also. They were almost in orbit, now, climbing\nat a slight angle with a velocity sufficient to carry them around Earth\nforever, a streamlined, tiny satellite.\n\nAfter the first few moments of disorientation, rocket crews found that a\nweightless condition gave them, ambiguously, a buoyant feeling. Only the\ndoughnut crew had really adapted to this condition, living as they did\nwithout the effects of gravity for hours at a time every day. The\ntemporary \"housing\" was rotated for comfort of the crews during rest\nperiods, but while moving the plates and girders of the giant doughnut\ninto place, they had no such luxuries. For these men, weightlessness\nbecame an integral part of their activities, but the rocket crews were\nsubjected to this phenomenon only during the few hours needed to\nrendezvous, unload the cargo, and coast back after another initial\nperiod of acceleration.\n\nHence, Mac felt a strange elation when he tapped his fingers on the arm\nof his couch and saw his arm float upward, due to reaction from the tap.\n\nAgainst all regulations, Logan unstrapped himself and motioned his\ncomrades to do the same. This unorthodox seventh-inning stretch was\nprohibited because it left the pilot's arm-rest controls without an\noperator, hence could prove disastrous if, through some malfunction, the\nship should veer off course.\n\nThe autopilot functioned perfectly, however, and Logan trusted it to the\npoint of insouciance. The three men lounged in midair, grinning\nfoolishly as they \"swam\" about the tiny cabin. No more satisfying\nstretch was ever enjoyed.\n\nA few minutes of this was enough. Ruiz was the first to gingerly pull\nhimself into his couch and his companions followed. Not a word had\npassed between them, since they were at all times in contact with\nmonitor stations spaced across the world below. The first time they had\nenjoyed this irregular horseplay, on the second trip, Logan had made the\nmistake of saying, \"Race you to the air lock!\", and was hard put to\nexplain those words. Nor could Logan switch to \"intercom only,\" since a\nsudden radio silence would create anxiety below. Only their heavy\nbreathing would indicate unusual activity to Earthside.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey were nearing the intercept point, a thousand miles above the\nAtlantic, when they realized their predicament.\n\n\"I'm in a fix, Carl,\" said Ruiz, meaning that he had tentatively fixed a\nposition of intercept. \"Correct our elevation; we're point-nine degrees\nhigh.\"\n\n\"Right-o. Correction in five seconds from my mark--mark!\"\n\nFor slight corrections in the flight path, small steering motors were\nutilized. These motors were located near the rear lip of _Valier's_\nconical cargo section on retractable booms. Extension of the motors with\nno resultant air friction gave a longer pivot arm and consequently\nbetter efficiency. Mac pressed the \"Aux. Steer\" stud and immediately\nthree amber lights winked on in their respective instrument consoles.\n\nCarl Logan fired the twelve o'clock motor briefly--only it didn't fire.\nThe change in momentum wouldn't be much in any case, but it was always\nperceptible by feel and by instrument. There was no change.\n\nLogan tried the firing circuit again, and again. Still _Valier_ streaked\nalong, now miles above the intended point of intercept. By this time,\nthe embryo space station was quite near, sailing along in the 'scope\nbeneath them. It slowly moved toward the top of the 'scope, passing\n_Valier_ in its slightly higher relative velocity.\n\n\"We've got troubles, Mac--find 'em!\" Logan had finally lost the\ndevil-may-care attitude, but that fact was small consolation to\nMacNamara.\n\n\"Keep your mitts off those firing studs, Carl,\" he growled, unstrapping\nhimself quickly. The malfunction was definitely in the auxiliary motor\nsetup, he thought. A common trouble? It wouldn't pay to find out. If the\nother motors fired, it would only throw them farther off-course. If\nworst came to worst, they could roll _Valier_ over and use the six\no'clock auxiliary; there was a small arc through which the motors could\nturn on their mounts. But the trouble was unknown, and they might end up\nrifling or pinwheeling if they didn't let bad enough alone.\n\nDuring his mental trouble-shooting, Mac was busily worming his bulk into\na balloonish-looking suit identical to those worn by the doughnut's\nconstruction crew. Ruiz gave him some aid, helping him thrust his arms\npast the spring-folded elbow joints. For some reason, the legs gave less\ntrouble. Within a fumbling few moments, he was ready for work.\n\nHe glanced at Logan through his visor, feeling a vicious pleasure over\nthe beads of sweat on Logan's forehead. Time he sweated a little,\nthought the mechanic.\n\nA final check of his headset followed, after which Mac oozed into the\nLilliputian air lock at the bottom, now rear, wall of the cabin. He\nnodded to Ruiz, who secured the air lock, then adjusted his suit control\nto force a little pressure into his suit. Gradually the suit became\nlivable. Then he cracked the other air-lock valve and allowed pressure\nto leak out around him.\n\nHis suit puffed out with soft popping noises and Mac heard the last\nvestige of air hiss out of the chamber. He found the hatchway too tight\nfor comfort and had a moment of fear when his tool pack caught in the\norifice, wedging him neatly. He could hear Logan and Ruiz through his\nearphones, explaining their plight to Ground Control. They wanted to\nknow why in blue blazes _Valier_ hadn't contacted the doughnut when it\ncame within range, and Logan had no defense save preoccupation with his\nown plight. Belatedly, Ruiz made radio contact with the doughnut, which\nwas still well within range. All this time, Mac busied himself with his\ninspection light, tracing the electrical leads to the small, turbine\noperated auxiliary motor fuel pumps.\n\n\"Mac?\" Logan's voice startled him. \"Can you brace yourself? I'm going to\ntry to match velocities with the doughnut. Won't take over one 'g' for a\nfew seconds.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute.\" He looked wildly about him. _Valier_ hadn't been built\nwith a view toward stowaways; and every cubic inch of space was crammed\nwith something, except for the passageway with its ladder, leading up\nfrom the main motor section. Well, if it wasn't over a \"g,\" he could\nhang on to the ladder. Suit weighs another fifty pounds, though. My\nweight plus fifty, he thought. \"Give me a chance to get set,\" he said\naloud. He hooked one bulbous leg over a ladder rung and braced the other\nagainst a lower rung, hugging the ladder with both arms. \"Any time you\nsay, but kill it if you hear me holler!\"\n\n\"Then five seconds from my mark--mark!\" Mac tightened his grip, and then\nsagged backward as the main motors fired. The vibrations shook him\nslightly but deeply, and he fought to keep his hold. He felt his back\ncreak and pop with the sudden surge of weight. Then the motors shut off,\nand Mac skidded several feet up the ladder. No matter how fast a man's\nreactions were, they couldn't be applied quickly enough to keep him from\nstarting an involuntary leap after bracing against a suddenly removed\ngravity load. \"All over, Mac. You O.K.?\"\n\n\"Guess so, but I feel like a ping-pong ball. How're we sittin'?\"\n\n\"Just fine,\" Ruiz cut in. \"Find anything?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\" Mac started his search anew. Everything seemed in perfect\norder up to the turbine pumps. Then, he feared, the trouble was near the\nlittle motors. That was tough, really tough. With the motors retracted\nit was next to impossible to get to them, past their hydraulically\noperated booms and actuators. Extended, he'd have to go outside. He\ncringed from the thought, although he knew that there was little to fear\nif he linked himself to the ship.\n\nHe peered along the beam of light, searching for some telltale\ndiscoloration in wiring, or a gleaming icy patch which would indicate a\nfuel leak. \"Might be the firing plugs,\" he muttered.\n\n\"Let's hope not. Where are you, Mac? Maybe you better give us a\nblow-by-blow.\" Logan sounded worried.\n\n\"Good idea. Right now I'm at the nine o'clock actuator. Nothing so far.\"\nHe looked around himself, forgetting for the moment how he was supposed\nto get past the equipment to the other auxiliary motor stations.\n\n\"Johnny,\" he said slowly, \"I think you'd best break out the tapes.\nAuxiliary motor system; you'll find them under power plant.\" Months\nbefore, MacNamara had made a complete set of tape recordings of his own\nvoice, recorded as he made a thorough-going rundown of every system and\nits components. This was a personal innovation which his fellow flight\nengineers considered folly. Extra weight, they scoffed. Undue\ncomplication. Mac nodded and went on with his impromptu speechmaking; a\nprofessional psychiatrist might have said, correctly, that Mac felt an\nunconscious need for supervision, a forgivable deficiency dating back to\nhis cadet days. Mac simply claimed that the best of men could forget or\nomit when alone with a few million dollars' worth of Uncle's equipment.\nThis way he could remind himself of each step to be taken ahead of time,\nin his own way.\n\nThe co-pilot rushed to comply. Mac, waiting, suddenly remembered how to\nget past his obstacle. Internal braces which helped keep the tanks\nrigidly in place on Earth were of little use while in \"freeloading,\" or\ngravity-less, state. The braces were removable, and Mac had loosened a\nsingle wing-nut to let the brace swing loose when he heard Johnny Ruiz's\nanswer.\n\n\"Ready with your tape, Mac. Where shall I start it?\"\n\n\"Run it through 'til you get to a blank spot, then another, then stop\nit.\" He was certain he didn't really need the tape, but it was a\nmaintenance aid and he was determined to use it.\n\nHe heard a click, then a hum, as the recorder was jacked into his\nheadset circuit. Immediately, a familiar voice began a slow dissertation\non power leads from the dome, speeded up in the space of a second or two\nto a high-pitched alien gibberish, then to a faint scream. He began\nsquirming around the turbine tanks, got past the first brace, and turned\nto attach it again. Of course it wasn't necessary, but--\"PLAY IT SAFE\"\nwas embroidered on his brain by years of maintenance experience; back in\nhis old maintenance squadron, he'd been called \"the old lady\" instead of\n\"the old man,\" due to his insistence on precautions.\n\nRuiz slowed the tape suddenly, on cue, and Mac heard himself saying,\n\"... Brace back in its slot and pin it. Be careful of those linkages on\nthe turbine pumps. Now crawl around to the next brace and unpin it.\"\nPause, scraping noises, and a muttered oath. \"Pin sticks, but it won't\nwithout a load on it.\" It didn't.\n\nHe worked slower than he had on the ground, fumbling with the heavy\ngloves and cursing mightily. His voice rambled on, warning him of\nobstacles and reminding him about minor points that could give trouble.\nHe listened carefully, discarding each suggestion.\n\nFloating near the twelve o'clock auxiliary, Mac peered at each tubing\nconnection, tugging and twisting. \"Wait a minute,\" he said. His light\nflashed out at the motor, riding perched on its swivel, limned against\ncold, hard points of light that were the stars. His heart gave a bound.\n\"I think I've found it!\" His other voice droned on morbidly. \"Turn that\nthing off a minute, Johnny. Listen; there's a lead to the twelve o'clock\nfuel valve solenoid that looks like ... yes, I'm sure of it. It's pulled\naway from a bracket and looks like it might be charred.\" Mac twisted\naround to view the wiring better.\n\n\"Can you fix it?\"\n\n\"Oh, sure, if that's all there is wrong. But I'd rather do the work with\nthe motors retracted. Tell you what; retract them about forty-five\ndegrees when I give the word.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMac judged the distance the booms would cover during semiretraction and\nhalf floated, half crawled out of the way. He found himself breathing\nheavily, despite the freeload conditions. His suit was simply too\ncumbersome. The thought came to him that he didn't even know how long\nhe'd been out of the dome. His breathing oxygen gauge showed half empty,\nso he must have been on the job for around a half hour. He rationed his\nsupply a bit, hoping he could finish the job without a refill.\n\n\"O.K., Johnny, you can run the tape again. And retract the motors while\nyou're at it.\" He heard the tape start again on its course, watching the\nbooms.\n\nThey leaped inward, then, and Mac felt a crushing blow across his back.\nHe shook his head groggily and yelled.\n\nHe tried to scramble from his place between motor and turbine fuel lines\nwithout success; he was trapped like a wild animal by the heavy actuator\nwhich had swung past his head. He heard himself say, \"And be sure to\nstay clear of the actuator. It swings through a ninety-degree arc when\nit's operated.\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up! I know it; I just judged it wrong.\" The tape moved on\nunperturbedly, reminding him to inspect the actuator bearings and\nextension rods.\n\n\"Mac,\" came Logan's voice, \"you might try to hurry it. If you can't get\nit fixed in an hour or two, we'll have to try rolling _Valier_ down to\nthe doughnut. But it's up to you, fella. Take your time.\"\n\n\"Well, you might help me a bit by raising this hydraulic unit offa my\nshoulders. Lucky it didn't squash me.\" The actuator stayed where it was.\n\"Johnny! Carl! Do you read me?\" No answer. Obviously, the actuator had\nsmashed his transmitter, but left the receiver section intact. Then all\nhe could hope for would be a suspicion from one of the others that all\nwas not well. If they asked him any questions and he failed to reply,\nthey'd figure something was wrong. Well, he couldn't count on that.\n\nHe struggled with his vulcanized suit, trying to squeeze from under the\nactuator. If I'd had them retract it completely, he thought, I'd be a\ndead man. It was a tight squeeze, but he inched his way out of the trap\nby using every ounce of strength at his command. If his suit tore, he'd\nknow it in a hurry.\n\nGasping for breath, Mac drew himself into a crouch and regarded the\noffending wire. His flashlight still operated, and he could see the\nheavy insulation which had been scraped away. No charring; then it must\nhave been the extension rods that had scissored through the insulation.\nThe wire hung together by a thread, the strands of metal severed\ncompletely. He groped for his tool kit, trying to ignore the voice in\nhis headset.\n\n\"Well, that takes care of the actuators. Now for these dinky motors. The\nswivel mounts have to work without any lubricant, so look for\nindications of wear and--\"\n\nMac cursed under his breath. He sounded so cocksure, so all-knowing. He\nfelt like beating himself. His earlier self, who had blithely toured\n_Valier_ trailing the microphone wires without any real premonition of\ntrouble. It always happens to the other guy--Not this time, chum, he\nreminded himself.\n\nThe gloves were systematically foiling his attempts to withdraw the coil\nof wire at his side. The tool kit was the ultimate in maintenance work,\ncompact and complete with extension handles for the cutters and\nwrenches. Everything was there, but practically impossible to use. His\nfingers finally closed over the wire; he jerked it out and with it the\nsplice tool. The little pliers caromed from the brace above him and\nsailed out toward the motor, beyond the ship. He watched, horrified, as\nthe tool slowly cartwheeled away into space.\n\n\"All right,\" he muttered, \"scratch one splice tool. It was also my only\npair of pliers, but I'll manage.\" He knew he could use the wire cutters\nin a pinch. \"In a pinch,\" he repeated. \"Oh, that's a hot one. That's\nabout all that's happened this trip, so far. Pinch me, pinch the\nwiring--What a pinch!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHolding the roll of wire tightly in one hand, he grasped the cutters and\npulled them from the kit with utmost care. He unrolled a foot-long\nsection of wire and clipped it off, laying his flashlight in the tool\nkit so that it would shine out in front of him. He managed to attach the\ntiny splice lugs by pinching them with the cutters, then moved\ncautiously to the wire which still drooped from the jumble of machinery.\n\"Drooped\" wasn't precisely the word; actually the wire had been bent\ninto its position and stayed that way.\n\nAs the harried major reached for the brace on which the wire had been\nbracketed, his tool kit vomited flashlight, wrenches and screwdrivers,\nleaving him in total darkness. His cursing was regular, now, monotonous\nand uninspired. There was another pencil light in the kit, snapped\ntightly to the case, and Mac reached for the whole business. The spare\nlight was a maintenance problem in itself. Question: How to retrieve a\nfountain pen sized object, when it's held by a small snap and the\nretriever is encumbered by three pairs of arctic mittens?\n\nMac saw his errant flashlight out of the corner of his eye, its beam\nfastened on a collapsed screw driver while both swam sluggishly toward\nthe inspection ladder. He located the pencil light and jerked it loose,\nholding the short wire and cutters in his other hand.\n\nThis, Mac knew, was the crucial point. If he could splice the wire\nhanging in front of him, _Valier_ would once more be in perfect shape.\nHe would have welcomed an extra hand or two, as he straddled a brace and\nshoved the tiny flash between his headpiece and shoulder fabric. The\nwire should be stripped, he knew, but he hadn't the tools. They were\nscarcely ten feet from him, but could have rested atop the Kremlin for\nall the good they did him. He got most of the strands of one end of wire\nshoved into a splice lug, and called it good enough. It was like trying\nto thread a needle whose eye was deeper than it was wide, while in a\ndiving suit, using the business end of a paintbrush to start the thread.\n\nHe withdrew one hand and searched the kit for friction tape. It might be\nmentioned that an insulating tape which would be adhesive at minus two\nhundred degrees centigrade yet keep its properties at plus one thousand,\nwas the near culmination of chemical science. Silicon plastic research\nprovided the adhesive, an inert gum which changed almost none through a\nfantastic range of temperatures and pressures. The tape Mac used to\ninsure his connection had an asbestos base, with adhesive gum insinuated\ninto the tape. He wrapped the wire tightly, then bound it to the brace.\nHe noticed his visor fogging up and felt a faint, giddy sensation.\nAnoxemia! He let the tape drift as he reached for his regulator dial.\n_What a fool he was_, he thought, _to starve his lungs_. He turned the\ndial to emergency maximum and gulped precious liters of oxygen-helium\nmixture. The gauge showed a store of the gas which might possibly be\nenough to last him, if nothing else went wrong; perhaps ten minutes.\n\nThe pencil flash, mercifully, still rested in a fold of his shoulder\njoint fabric. The insulation tape floated near his waist; he grabbed it\nand stowed it between his knee and the brace, then reached once again\nfor the wiring.\n\nThis time the splice went on without a hitch. He pinched the splice lug\nand taped the whole works feverishly. It was done; he had won. The trip\nback should take only a couple of minutes. Replacing the wire cutters in\nhis kit, he held the pencil flash before him and started retracing his\nroute.\n\nHe passed the twelve o'clock brace, pinned it in place again and saw one\nof his tools floating to the right of his head. He gathered it in and\nswept his tiny flash around in search of other jetsam from his tool kit.\nHe collected a wrench and the skittish flashlight, started toward the\nlast brace between him and the ladder, and felt his legs go limp. He\nwasn't particularly alarmed about it; his arms and vision failed him\ntoo, but his brain hadn't enough incoming oxygen to care much, one way\nor the other. The few remaining feet seemed to lengthen into a sewerlike\npassageway, then vanished as did all else as his perceptions died.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMacNamara was not the sort to wonder about heaven or hell when he first\nawoke. He saw a faintly rounded ceiling, a soft yellow tint accentuating\nits featurelessness. \"How the devil--\", he began. His voice failed him.\n\n\"Hi, Mac.\" Logan's beaming face loomed over him. \"You rugged character,\nyou. Cold as a pickle an hour ago, and already you're askin' silly\nquestions.\" He held up his hand as Mac started to speak. \"I hear you\nthinkin'. 'How the devil did I get here, and where is here?' In reverse\norder, this is the most comfortable berth in the doughnut's facilities,\nand you got here courtesy of one Johnny Ruiz. Myself, I wouldn't have\ntaken the trouble.\"\n\nMac grinned back at his pilot and cleared his throat. \"Well, where is\nhe? I wanta shake his hand, or give him half my kingdom, or something.\"\n\n\"You know Johnny; the shy type. He'll be along after a while. You know,\nI think he kinda likes you; when you quit transmitting out there, Johnny\nwas like a cat on a hot skillet. Finally decided to go back and have a\nlook for himself, but I told him you probably had a hot game of\nsolitaire going. Anyway, he went back and found you asleep on the job,\nand lost a good ten pounds getting your fat carcass through the air\nlock.\" That was a job that must have taxed both Ruiz and Logan, but Mac\nheld his silence. \"And that was about the size of it. _Valier's_ parked\noutside with some of the boys, good as ever. Come on, we'll sop up some\ncoffee.\"\n\nMac swung himself up to a sitting position and realized dizzily that he\nwas mother-naked. His ribs felt pulverized. \"You guys sure mauled me\nup,\" he said accusingly.\n\n\"Unavoidable, my dear grease-monkey. You needed a little artificial\nrespiration; I never was too good at that.\"\n\n\"Well, whoever did the job rates a prize of some sort,\" Mac answered,\n\"but my ribs tell me he had more enthusiasm than practice.\"\n\nLogan smiled his old familiar smile, relieved to find his engineer in\njoking spirits. \"The credit again goes to Johnny. But,\" he added, \"try\nnot to be too hard on him. Try giving artificial respiration to a big\nlump like yourself sometime, without any gravity.\"\n\nMac digested this tidbit as he pulled on a fresh pair of coveralls.\n\"O.K.,\" he said, standing on the foamex \"floor.\" \"How did he do it?\"\n\n\"Strapped you into your couch face down and locked his legs around it. I\ndidn't dare apply any g's. Come on,\" he finished, \"you've managed to\nupset every timetable in the project. Johnny's shaking like a leaf, or\nwas when I left him. A bulb of coffee will do us both a world of good.\"\n\n\"I'm sold,\" Mac grunted, zipping up a flight boot. \"But there's\nsomething I'd like to do, first chance I get.\"\n\n\"Which is?\"\n\n\"Which is jettison every last strip of tape I have in _Valier_. I tell\nyou, Logan,\" he went on as they entered the recreation bar, \"you'll\nnever know how degrading it is to hear useless, insipid information\noffered to you when you're in a tight spot, knowing full well the voice\nis your own!\"\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Tight Squeeze, by Dean Charles Ing\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TIGHT SQUEEZE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 23337.txt or 23337.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/3/3/3/23337/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
