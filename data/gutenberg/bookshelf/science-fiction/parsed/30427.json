Therefore a delusion can be a fine thing for prodding\n      angry belligerents...._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nI remember some bad times, most of them back home on Excenus 23; the\nworst was when Dad fell under the reaping machine but there was also\nthe one when I got lost twenty miles from home with a dud radio, at\nthe age of twelve; and the one when Uncle Charlie caught me practicing\nemergency turns in a helicar round the main weather-maker; and the one\non Figuerra being chased by a cyber-crane; and the time when Dad\ndecided to send me to Earth to do my Education.\n\nThis time is bad in a different way, with no sharp edges but a kind of\na desolation.\n\nMost people I know are feeling bad just now, because at Russett\nCollege we finished our Final Examination five days ago and Results\nare not due for a two weeks.\n\nMy friend B Laydon says this is yet another Test anyone still sane at\nthe end being proved tough enough to break a molar on; she says also\nThe worst part is in bed remembering all the things she could have\nwritten and did not; The second worst is also in bed picturing how to\nexplain to her parents when they get back to Earth that _someone_ has\nto come bottom and in a group as brilliant as Russett College Cultural\nEngineering Class this is really no disgrace.\n\nI am not worried that way so much, I cannot remember what I wrote\nanyway and I can think of one or two people I am pretty sure will come\nbottomer than me--or B either.\n\nI would prefer to think it is just Finals cause me to feel miserable\nbut it is not.\n\nIn Psychology they taught us The mind has the faculty of concealing\nany motive it is ashamed of, especially from itself; seems\nunfortunately mine does not have this gadget supplied.\n\nI never wanted to come to Earth. I was sent to Russett against my will\nand counting the days till I could get back to Home, Father and\nExcensus 23, but the sad truth is that now the longed-for moment is\nnearly on top of me I do not want to go.\n\nDad's farm was a fine place to grow up, but now I had four years on\nEarth the thought of going back there makes me feel like a\nthree-weeks' chicken got to get back in its shell.\n\nB and I are on an island in the Pacific. Her parents are on Caratacus\nresearching on local art forms, so she and I came here to be miserable\nin company and away from the rest.\n\nIt took me years on Earth to get used to all this water around, it\nseemed unnatural and dangerous to have it all lying loose that way,\nbut now I shall miss even the Sea.\n\nThe reason we have this long suspense over Finals is that they will\nnot use Reading Machines to mark the papers for fear of cutting down\ncritical judgement; so each paper has to be read word by word by three\nExaminers and there are forty-three of us and we wrote six papers\neach.\n\nWhat I think is I am sorry for the Examiners, but B says they were the\nones who set the papers and it serves them perfectly right.\n\nI express surprise because D. J. M'Clare our Professor is one of them,\nbut B says He is one of the greatest men in the galaxy, of course, but\nshe gave up thinking him perfect _years_ ago.\n\nOne of the main attractions on this Island is swimming under water,\nespecially by moonlight. Dad sent me a fish-boat as a birthday present\ntwo years back, but I never used it yet on account of my\nabove-mentioned attitude to water. Now I got this feeling of Carpe\nDiem, make the most of Earth while I am on it because probably I shall\nnot pass this way again.\n\nThe fourth day on the Island it is full moon at ten o'clock, so I\npluck up courage to wriggle into the boat and go out under the Sea. B\nsays Fish parading in and out of reefs just remind her of Cultural\nEngineering--crowd behavior--so she prefers to turn in early and find\nout what nightmares her subconscious will throw up _this_ time.\n\nThe reefs by moonlight are everything they are supposed to be, why did\nI not do this often when I had the chance? I stay till my oxygen is\nnearly gone, then come out and sadly press the button that collapses\nthe boat into a thirty-pound package of plastic hoops and oxygen cans.\nI sling it on my back and head for the chalet B and I hired among the\ncoconut trees.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI am crossing an open space maybe fifty yards from it when a Thing\ndrops on me out of the air.\n\nI do not see the Thing because part of it covers my face, and the rest\nis grabbed round my arms and my waist and my hips and whatever, I\ncannot see and I cannot scream and I cannot find anything to kick. The\nThing is strong and rubbery and many-armed and warmish, and less than\na second after I first feel it I am being hauled up into the air.\n\nI do not care for this at all.\n\nI am at least fifty feet up before it occurs to me to bite the hand\nthat gags me and then I discover it is plastic, not alive at all. Then\nI feel self and encumberance scraping through some kind of aperture;\nthere is a sharp click as of a door closing and the Thing goes limp\nall round me.\n\nI spit out the bit I am biting and it drops away so that I can see.\n\nWell!\n\nI am in a kind of a cup-shaped space maybe ten feet across but not\nhigher than I am; there is a trap door in the ceiling; the Thing is\nlying all around me in a mess of plastic arms, with an extensible\nstalk connecting it to the wall. I kick free and it turns over\nexposing the label FRAGILE CARGO right across the back.\n\nThe next thing I notice is two holdalls, B's and mine, clamped against\nthe wall, and the next after that is the opening of a trap door in the\nceiling and B's head silhouetted in it remarking Oh there you are Liz.\n\nI confirm this statement and ask for explanations.\n\nB says She doesn't understand all of it but it is all right.\n\nIt is not all right I reply, if she has joined some Society such as\nfor the Realization of Fictitious Improbabilities that is her\nprivilege but no reason to involve me.\n\nB says Why do I not stop talking and come up and see for myself?\n\nThere is a slight hitch when I jam in the trap door, then B helps me\nget the boat off my back and I drop it on the Fragile Cargo and emerge\ninto the cabin of a Hopper, drop-shaped, cargo-carrying; I have been\nin its hold till now.\n\nThere are one or two peculiar points about it, or maybe one or two\nhundred, such as the rate at which we are ascending which seems to be\nbringing us right into the Stratosphere; but the main thing I notice\nis the pilot. He has his back to us but is recognizably Ram Gopal who\ngraduated in Cultural Engineering last year, Rumor says next to top of\nhis class.\n\nI ask him what kind of a melodramatic shenanigan is this?\n\nB says We had to leave quietly in a hurry without attracting attention\nso she booked us out at the Hotel _hours_ ago and she and Ram have\nbeen hanging around waiting for me ever since.\n\nI point out that the scope-trace of an Unidentified Flying Object will\noccasion a lot more remark than a normal departure even at midnight.\n\nAt this Ram smiles in an inscrutable Oriental manner and B gets nearly\nas cross as I do, seems she has mentioned this point before.\n\nWe have not gone into it properly when the cabin suddenly shifts\nthrough a right angle. B and I go sliding down the vertical floor and\nend sitting on a window. There is a jolt and a shudder and Ram mutters\nthings in Hindi and then suddenly Up is nowhere at all.\n\nB and I scramble off the window and grab fixtures so as to stay put.\nThe stars have gone and we can see nothing except the dim glow over\nthe instruments; then suddenly lights go on outside.\n\nWe look out into the hold of a ship.\n\nOur ten-foot teardrop is sitting next to another one, like two eggs\nin a rack. On the other side is a bulkhead; behind, the curve of the\nhull; and directly ahead an empty space, then another bulkhead and an\nopen door, through which after a few seconds a head pokes cautiously.\n\nThe head is then followed by a body which kicks off against the wall\nand sails slowly towards us. Ram presses a stud and a door slides open\nin the hopper; but the new arrival stops himself with a hand on either\nside of the frame, his legs trailing any old how behind him. It is\nPeter Yeng Sen who graduated the year I did my Field Work.\n\nHe says, Gopal, dear fellow, there was no need for the knocking, we\nheard the bell all right.\n\nRam grumbles something about the guide beam being miss-set, and slides\nout of his chair. Peter announces that we have only just made it as\nthe deadline is in seven minutes time; he waves B and me out of the\nhopper, through the door and into a corridor where a certain irregular\nvibration is coming from the walls.\n\nRam asks what is that tapping? And Peter sighs and says The present\ngeneration of students has no discipline at all.\n\nAt this B brakes with one hand against the wall and cocks her head to\nlisten; next moment she laughs and starts banging with her fist on the\nwall.\n\nPeter exclaims in Mandarin and tows her away by one wrist like a\nreluctant kite. The rapping starts again on the far side of the wall\nand I suddenly recognize a primitive signaling system called Regret\nor something, I guess because it was used by people in situations they\ndid not like such as Sinking ships or solitary confinement; it is done\nby tapping water pipes and such.\n\nSomeone found it in a book and the more childish element in College\nlearned it up for signaling during compulsory lectures. Interest\nwaning abruptly when the lecturers started to learn it, too.\n\nI never paid much attention not expecting to be in Solitary\nconfinement much; this just shows you; next moment Ram opens a door\nand pushes me through it, the door clicks behind me and Solitary\nconfinement is what I am in.\n\nI remember this code is really called Remorse which is what I feel for\nnot learning when I had the chance.\n\nHowever I do not have long for it, a speaker in the wall requests\neveryone to lie down as acceleration is about to begin. I strap down\non the couch which fills half the compartment, countdown begins and at\nzero the floor is suddenly _down_ once more.\n\nI wait till my stomach settles, then rise to explore.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI am in an oblong room about eight by twelve, it looks as though it\nhad been hastily partitioned off from a larger space. The walls are\nprefab plastic sheet, the rest is standard fittings slung in and\nbolted down with the fastenings showing.\n\nHow many of my classmates are on this ship? _Remorse_ again as\ntapping starts on either side of me.\n\nDiscarding such Hypotheses as that Ram and Peter are going to hold us\nto ransom--which might work for me, since my Dad somehow got to be a\nmillionaire, but not for B because her parents think money is\nvulgar--or that we are being carried off to found an ideal Colony\nsomewhere--any first-year student can tell you why that won't\nwork--only one idea seems plausible.\n\nThis is that Finals were not final and we are in for a Test of some\nsort.\n\nAfter ten minutes I get some evidence; a Reading Machine is trundled\nin, the door immediately slamming shut so I do not see who trundles\nit.\n\nI prowl round it looking for tricks but it seems standard; I take a\nseat in it, put on the headset and turn the switch.\n\nHypothesis confirmed, I suppose.\n\nThere is a reel in place and it contains background information on a\nproblem in Cultural Engineering all set out the way we are taught to\ndo it in Class. The Problem concerns developments on a planet got\nsettled by two groups during the Exodus and been isolated ever since.\n\nWell while a Reading Machine is running there is no time to think, it\ncrams in data at full speed and evaluation has to wait. However my\nsubconscious goes into action and when the reel stops it produces a\nSuspicion full grown.\n\nThe thing is too tidy.\n\nWhen we were First Year we dreamed up situations like this and argued\nlike mad over them, but they were a lot too neat for real life and too\ndramatic as well.\n\nHowever one thing M'Clare said to us, and every other lecturer too,\njust before the Finals, was Do not spend time trying to figure what\nthe examiner was after but answer the question as set; I am more than\nhalfway decided this is some mysterious Oriental idea of a joke but I\nget busy thinking in case it is not.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Problem goes like this:\n\nThe planet is called Incognita in the reel and it is right on the edge\nof the known volume of space, it got settled by two groups somewhere\nbetween three and three and a half centuries ago. The rest of the\nhuman race never heard of it till maybe three years back.\n\n(Well it happens that way, inhabited planets are still turning up\neight or ten a century, on account of during the Exodus some folk were\nwilling to travel a year or more so as to get away from the rest).\n\nThe ship that spotted the planet as inhabited did not land, but\nreported to Central Government, Earth, who shipped observers out to\ntake a look.\n\n(There was a rumor circulating at Russett that the Terry Government\nmight employ some of us on that kind of job, but it never got\nofficial. I do not know whether to believe this bit or not.)\n\nIt is stated the observers landed secretly and mingled with the\nnatives unobserved.\n\n(This is not physically impossible but sounds too like a Field Trip to\nbe true.)\n\nThe observers are not named but stated to be graduates of the Cultural\nEngineering Class.\n\nThey put in a few months' work and sent home unanimous Crash Priority\nreports the situation is _bad_, getting worse and the prognosis is\nWar.\n\nBrother.\n\nI know people had wars, I know one reason we do not have them now is\njust that with so many planets and cheap transportation, pressure has\nother outlets; these people scrapped their ships for factories and\nnever built more.\n\nBut.\n\nThere are only about ten million of them and surely to goodness a\nwhole planet gives room enough to keep out of each other's hair?\n\nWell this is not Reasoning but a Reaction, I go back to the data for\nanother look.\n\nThe root trouble is stated to be that two groups landed on the planet\nwithout knowing the others were there, when they met thirty years\nlater they got a disagreeable shock.\n\nI cannot see there was any basic difference between them, they were\nvery similar, especially in that neither lot wanted anything to do\nwith people they had not picked themselves.\n\nSo they divided the planet along a Great Circle which left two of the\nmain land-masses in one hemisphere and two in another.\n\nThey agree each to keep to its own section and leave the other alone.\n\nTwenty years later, trading like mad; each has certain minerals the\nother lacks; each has certain agricultural products the other finds it\ndifficult to grow.\n\nYou think this leads to Co-operation Friendship and ultimate\nFederation?\n\nI will not go into the incidents that make each side feel it is being\ngypped, it is enough that from time to time each has a scarcity or\nhold-up on deliveries that upsets the other's economy; and they start\nexperimenting to become self-sufficient: and the exporter's economy is\nupset in turn. And each thinks the other did it on purpose.\n\nThis sort of situation reacts internally leading to Politics.\n\nThere are troubles about a medium-sized island on the dividing line,\nand the profits from interhemispherical transport, and the laws of\ninterhemispherical trade.\n\nIt takes maybe two hundred years, but finally each has expanded the\nPolice into an army with a whole spectrum of weapons not to be used on\nany account except for Defense.\n\nThis situation lasts seventy years getting worse all the time, now\nRumors have started on each side that the other is developing an\nUltimate Weapon, and the political parties not in power are agitating\nto move first before the thing is complete.\n\nThe observers report War not maybe this year or the next but within\nten, and if neither side was looking for an Ultimate Weapon to begin\nwith they certainly are now.\n\nTaking all this at face value there seems an obvious solution.\n\nI am thinking this over in an academic sort of way when an itchy\ntrickle of sweat starts down my vertebrae.\n\nWho is going to apply this solution? Because if this is anything but\nanother Test, or the output of a diseased sense of humor, I would be\nsorry for somebody.\n\nI dial black coffee on the wall servitor and wish B were here so we\ncould prove to each other the thing is just an exercise; I do not do\nso well at spotting proofs on my own.\n\nMost of our class exercises have concerned something that happened,\nonce.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter about ninety minutes the speaker requests me to write not more\nthan one thousand words on any scheme to improve the situation and the\nequipment required for it.\n\nI spent ten minutes verbalizing the basic idea and an hour or so on\n\"equipment\"; the longer I go on the more unlikely it all seems. In the\nend I have maybe two hundred words which acting on instructions I post\nthrough a slit in the door.\n\nFive minutes later I realize I have forgotten the Time Factor.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIf the original ship took a year to reach Incognita, it will take at\nleast four months now; therefore it is more than four months since\nthat report was written and will be more than a year before anyone\narrives and War may have started already.\n\nI sit back and by transition of ideas start to wonder where this ship\nis heading? We are still at one gee and even on Mass-Time you cannot\njuggle apparent acceleration and spatial transition outside certain\nlimits; we are not just orbiting but must be well outside the Solar\nSystem by now.\n\nThe speaker announces Everyone will now get some rest; I smell\nsleep-gas for one moment and have just time to lie down.\n\nI guess I was tired, at that.\n\nWhen I wake I feel more cheerful than I have for weeks; analysis\nindicates I am glad something is _happening_ even if it is another\nExam.\n\nI dial breakfast but am too restless to eat; I wonder how long this\ngoes on or whether I am supposed to show Initiative and break out; I\nam examining things with this in mind when the speaker comes to life\nagain.\n\nIt says, \"Ladies and gentlemen. You have not been told whether the\nproblem that you studied yesterday concerned a real situation or an\nimaginary one. You have all outlined measures which you think would\nimprove the situation described. Please consider, seriously, whether\nyou would be prepared to take part yourself in the application of your\nplan.\"\n\nBrother.\n\nThere is no way to tell whether those who say No will be counted\ncowardly or those who say Yes rash idiots or what, the owner of that\nvoice has his inflections too well trained to give anything away\nexcept intentionally.\n\nD. J. M'Clare.\n\nNot in person but a recording, anyway M'Clare is on Earth surrounded\nby exam papers.\n\nI sit back and try to think, honestly, if that crack-brained notion I\nwrote out last night were going to be tried in dead earnest, would I\ntake a hand in it?\n\nThe trouble is, hearing M'Clare's voice has convinced me it is a Test,\nI don't know whether it is testing my courage or my prudence in fact I\nmight as well toss for it.\n\nHeads I am crazy, Tails a defaulter; Tails is what it is.\n\nI seize my styler and write the decision down.\n\nThere is the slit in the door.\n\nI twiddle the note and think Well nobody asked for it yet.\n\nSuppose it is real, after all?\n\nI remember the itchy, sweaty feeling I got yesterday and try to\npicture really embarking on a thing like this, but I cannot work up\nany lather today.\n\nI begin to picture M'Clare reading my decision not to back up my own\nidea.\n\nI pick up the coin and juggle it around.\n\nThe speaker remarks When I am quite ready will I please make a note\nof my decision and post it through the door.\n\nI go on flipping the coin up and presently it drops on the floor, it\nis Heads this time.\n\nTossing coins is a pretty feeble way to decide.\n\nI drop the note on the floor and take another sheet and write \"YES.\nLysistrata Lee.\"\n\nUsing that name seems to make it more legal.\n\nI slip the paper in the slit and poke till it falls through on the\nother side of the door.\n\nI am suddenly immensely hungry and dial breakfast all over again.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nJust as I finish M'Clare's voice starts once more.\n\n\"It's always the minor matters that cause the most difficulty. The\ntiming of this announcement has cost me as much thought as any aspect\nof the arrangements. The trouble is that however honest you are--and\nyour honesty has been tested repeatedly--and however strong your\nimagination--about half of your training has been devoted to\ndeveloping it--you can't possibly be sure, answering a hypothetical\nquestion, that you are giving the answer you would choose if you knew\nit was asked in dead earnest.\n\n\"Those of you who answered the question in the negative are out of\nthis. They have been told that it was a test, of an experimental\nnature, and have been asked to keep the whole thing a secret. They\nwill be returning to Earth in a few hours' time. I ask the rest of\nyou to think it over once again. Your decision is still private. Only\nthe two people who gathered you together know which members of the\nclass are in this ship. The list of possible helpers was compiled by a\ncomputer. I haven't seen it myself.\n\n\"You have a further half hour in which to make up your minds finally.\nPlease remember that if you have any private reservations on the\nmatter, or if you are secretly afraid, you may endanger us all. You\nall know enough psychology to realize this.\n\n\"If you still decide in favor of the project, write your name on a\nslip of paper and post it as before. If you are not absolutely certain\nabout it, do nothing. Please think it over for half an hour.\"\n\nMe, I had enough thinking. I write my name--just L. Lee--and post it\nstraight away.\n\nHowever I cannot stop thinking altogether. I guess I think very hard,\nin fact. My Subconscious insists afterwards that it did register the\nplop as something came through the slit, but my Conscious failed to\nnotice it at all.\n\nHours later--my watch says twenty-five minutes but I guess the\nMass-Time has affected it--anyway I had three times too much solitary\nconfinement--when will they let me out of here?--there is a knock at\nthe door and a second later it slides apart.\n\nI am expecting Ram or Peter so it takes me an appreciable fraction of\na moment to realize I am seeing D. J. M'Clare.\n\nThen I remember he is back on Earth buried in Exam papers and\nconclude I am having a hallucination.\n\nThis figment of my imagination says politely, \"Do you mind if I sit\ndown?\"\n\nHe collapses on the couch as though thoroughly glad of it.\n\nIt is a strange thing, every time I see M'Clare I am startled all over\nagain at how good-looking he is; seems I forget it between times which\nis maybe why I never fell for him as most female students do.\n\nHowever what strikes me this time is that he looks tired,\nthree-days-sleepless tired with worries on top.\n\nI guess he is real, at that.\n\nHe says, \"Don't look so accusing, Lizzie, I only just got on this ship\nmyself.\"\n\nThis does not make sense; you cannot just arrive on a ship twenty-four\nhours after it goes on Mass-Time; or can you?\n\nM'Clare leans back and closes his eyes and inquires whether I am one\nof the Morse enthusiasts?\n\nSo that is the name; I say when we get back I will learn it first\nthing.\n\n\"Well,\" says he, \"I did my best to arrange privacy for all of you;\nwith so many ingenious idiots on board I'm not really surprised that\nthey managed to circumvent me. I had to cheat and check that you\nreally were on the list; and I knew that whoever backed out you'd\nstill be on board.\"\n\nSo I should hope he might: Horrors there is my first answer screwed\nup on the floor and Writing side top-most.\n\nHowever he has not noticed it, he goes on \"Anyway you of all people\nwon't be thought to have dropped out because you were afraid.\"\n\nI have just managed to hook my heel over the note and get it out of\nsight, M'Clare has paused for an answer and I have to dredge my\nSub-threshold memories for--\n\nWHAT?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nM'Clare opens his eyes and says like I am enacting Last Straw, \"Have\nsome sense, Lizzie.\" Then in a different tone, \"Ram says he gave you\nthe letter half an hour ago.\"\n\nWhat letter?\n\nMy brain suddenly registers a small pale patch been occupying a corner\nof my retina for the last half hour; it turns out to be a letter\npostmarked Excenus 23.\n\nI disembowel it with one jerk. It is from my Dad and runs like this:\n\n     My dear Liz,\n\n     Thank you for your last letter, glad you are keeping fit and\n     so am I.\n\n     I just got a letter from your College saying you will get a\n     degree conferred on you on September 12th and parents if on\n     Earth will be welcome.\n\n     Well Liz this I got to see and Charlie says the same, but\n     the letter says too Terran Authority will not give a permit\n     to visit Earth just for this, so I wangled on to a\n     Delegation which is coming to discuss trade with the\n     Department of Commerce. Charlie and I will be arriving on\n     Earth on August 24th.\n\n     Liz it is good to think I shall be seeing you again after\n     four years. There are some things about your future I meant\n     to write to Professor M'Clare about, but now I shall be able\n     to talk it over direct. Please give him my regards.\n\n     Be seeing you Lizzie girl, your affectionate Dad\n\n                                                 J. X. Lee.\n\nDear old Dad, after all these years farming with a weather-maker on a\ndrydust planet I want to see his face the first time he sees real\nrain.\n\nHell's fires and shades of darkness, I shan't be there!\n\nM'Clare says, \"Your father wrote to me saying that he will be arriving\non Earth on 24th August. I take it your letter says the same. I came\non a dispatch boat; you can go back on it.\"\n\n_Now_ what is he talking about? Then I get the drift.\n\nI say, \"Look. So Dad will be on Earth before we get back. What\ndifference does that make?\"\n\n\"You can't let him arrive and find you missing.\"\n\nWell I admit to a qualm at the thought of Dad let loose on Earth\nwithout me, but after all Uncle Charlie is a born Terrie and can keep\nhim in line; Hell he is old enough to look after himself anyway.\n\n\"You met my Dad,\" I point out. \"You think J. X. Lee would want any\ndaughter of his backing out on a job so as to hold his hand? I can\nsend him a letter saying I am off on a job or a Test or whatever I\nplease and hold everything till I get back; what are you doing about\npeople's families on Earth already?\"\n\nM'Clare says we were all selected as having families not on Earth at\npresent, and I must go back.\n\nI say like Hell I will.\n\nHe says he is my official guardian and responsible for me.\n\nI say he is just as responsible for everyone else on this ship.\n\nI spent years and years trying to think up a remark would really get\nhome to M'Clare; well I have done it now.\n\nI say, \"Look. You are tired and worried and maybe not thinking so well\njust now.\n\n\"I know this is a very risky job, don't think I missed that at all. I\ntried hard to imagine it like you said over the speaker. I cannot\nquite imagine dying but I know how Dad will feel if I do.\n\n\"I did my level best to scare myself sick, then I decided it is just\nplain worth the risk anyway.\n\n\"To work out a thing like this you have to have a kind of arithmetic,\nyou add in everybody's feelings with the other factors, then if you\nget a plus answer you forget everything else and go right ahead.\n\n\"I am not going to think about it any more, because I added up the sum\nand got the answer and upsetting my nerves won't help. I guess you\nworked out the sum, too. You decided four million people were worth\nrisking twenty, even if they do have parents. Even if they are your\nstudents. So they are, too, and you gave us all a chance to say No.\n\n\"Well nothing has altered that, only now the values look different to\nyou because you are tired and worried and probably missed breakfast,\ntoo.\"\n\nBrother some speech, I wonder what got into me? M'Clare is wondering,\ntoo, or maybe gone to sleep sitting, it is some time before he answers\nme.\n\n\"Miss Lee, you are deplorably right on one thing at least. I don't\nknow whether I was fit to make such a decision when I made it, but I'm\nnot fit now. As far as you personally are concerned....\" He trails off\nlooking tireder than ever, then picks up again suddenly. \"You are\nagain quite right, I am every bit as responsible for the other people\non board as I am for you.\"\n\nHe climbs slowly to his feet and walks out without another word.\n\nThe door is left open and I take this as an invitation to freedom and\nshoot through in case it was a mistake.\n\nNo because Ram is opening doors all along the corridor and ten of\nRussett's brightest come pouring out like mercury finding its own\nlevel and coalesce in the middle of the floor.\n\nThe effect of release is such that after four minutes Peter Yeng Sen's\nhead appears at the top of a stairway and he says the crew is lifting\nthe deck plates, will we for Time's sake go along to the Conference\nRoom which is soundproof.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Conference Room is on the next deck and like our cabins shows\nsigns of hasty construction; the soundproofing is there but the\nacoustics are kind of muffled and the generator is not boxed in but\nhas cables trailing all over, and the fastenings have a strong but\ntemporary look.\n\nOtherwise there is a big table and a lot of chairs and a small\nprojection box in front of each with a note-taker beside.\n\nIt is maybe this very functional setup or maybe the dead flatness of\nour voices in the damped room, but we do not have so much to talk\nabout any more. We automatically take places at the table, all at one\nend, leaving seven vacant chairs near the door.\n\nLooking round, I wonder what principle we were selected on.\n\nOf my special friends Eru Te Whangoa and Kirsty Lammergaw are present\nbut Lily Chen and Likofo Komom'baratse and Jean LeBrun are not; we\nhave Cray Patterson who is one of my special enemies but not Blazer\nWeigh or the Astral Cad; the rest are P. Zapotec, Nick Howard, Aro\nMestah, Dillie Dixie, Pavel Christianovitch, Lennie DiMaggio and\nShootright Crow.\n\nEru is at the end of the table, opposite the door, and maybe feels\nthis position puts it up to him to start the discussion; he opens by\nremarking \"So nobody took the opportunity to withdraw.\"\n\nCray Patterson lifts his eyebrows ceilingwards and drawls out that the\ndecision was supposed to be a private one.\n\nB says \"Maybe but it did not work out that way, everyone who learned\nMorse knows who was on the ship, anyway they are all still here so\nwhat does it matter? And M'Clare would not have picked people who were\ngoing to funk it, after all.\"\n\nMy chair gets a kick on the ankle which I suppose was meant for B; Eru\nis six foot five but even his legs do not quite reach; he is the only\none of us facing the door.\n\nM'Clare has somehow shed his weariness; he looks stern but fresh as a\ndaisy. There are four with him; Ram and Peter looking serious, one\nstranger in Evercleans looking determined to enjoy the party and\nanother in uniform looking as though nothing would make him.\n\nM'Clare introduces the strangers as Colonel Delano-Smith and Mr.\nYardo. They all sit down at the other end of the table; then he frowns\nat us and begins like this:\n\n\"Miss Laydon is mistaken. You were not selected on any such grounds as\nshe suggests. I may say that I was astonished at the readiness with\nwhich you all engaged yourselves to take part in such a desperate\ngamble; and, seeing that for the last four years I have been trying to\npersuade you that it is worth while, before making a decision of any\nimportance, to spend a certain amount of thought on it, I was\ndiscouraged as well.\"\n\nOh.\n\n\"The criterion upon which you were selected was a very simple one. As\nI told you, you were picked not by me but by a computer; the one in\nthe College Office which registers such information as your home\naddresses and present whereabouts. You are simply that section of the\nclass which could be picked up without attracting attention, because\nyou all happened to be on holiday by yourselves or with other members\nof the class; and because your nearest relatives are not on Earth at\npresent.\"\n\nOh, well.\n\nAll of us can see M'Clare is doing a job of deflation on us for\nreasons of his own, but it works for all that.\n\nHe now seems to feel the job is complete and relaxes a bit.\n\n\"I was interested to see that you all, without exception, hit on\nvariations of the same idea. It is of course the obvious way to deal\nwith the problem.\" He smiles at us suddenly and I get mad at myself\nbecause I know he is following the rules for introducing a desired\nstate of mind, but I am responding as meant. \"I'll read you the most\nsuccinct expression of it; you may be able to guess the author.\"\n\nBusiness with bits of paper.\n\n\"Here it is. I quote: 'Drag in some outsider looks like he is going\nfor both sides; they will gang up on him.'\"\n\nYells of laughter and shouts of \"Lizzie Lee!\" even the two strangers\nproduce sympathetic grins; I do not find it so funny as all that\nmyself.\n\n\"Ideas as to the form the 'outsider' should take were more varied.\nThis is a matter I propose to leave you to work out together, with the\nassistance of Colonel Delano-Smith and Mr. Yardo. Te Whangoa, you\ntake the chair.\"\n\nExit M'Clare.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThis leaves the two halves of the table eying one another. Ram and\nPeter have been through this kind of session in their time; now they\nare leaning back preparing to watch us work. It is plain we are\nsupposed to impress the abilities of Russett near-graduates on the two\nstrangers, and for some moments we are all occupied taking them in.\nColonel Delano-Smith is a small, neat guy with a face that has all the\nmuscular machinery for producing an expression; he just doesn't care\nto use it. Mr. Yardo is taller than any of us except Eru and flesh is\nspread very thin on his bones, including his face which splits now and\nthen in a grin like an affable skeleton. Where the colonel fits is\nguessable enough, Mr. Yardo is presumably Expert at something but no\ndata on _what_.\n\nEru rests his hands on the table and says we had better start; will\nsomebody kindly outline an idea for making the Incognitans \"gang up\"?\nThe simpler the better and it does not matter whether it is workable\nor not; pulling it to pieces will give us a start.\n\nWe all wait to see who will rush in; then I catch Eru's eye and see I\nam elected Clown again. I say \"Send them a letter postmarked Outer\nSpace signed BEM saying we lost our own planet in a nova and will take\nover theirs two weeks from Tuesday.\"\n\nMr. Yardo utters a sharp \"Ha! Ha!\" but it is not seconded; the\ncolonel having been expressionless all along becomes more so; Eru\nsays, \"Thank you, Lizzie.\" He looks across at Cray who is opposite me;\nCray says there are many points on which he might comment; to take\nonly one, two weeks from Tuesday leaves little time for 'ganging up',\nand what happens when the BEMs fail to come?\n\nWe are suddenly back in the atmosphere of a seminar; Eru's glance\nmoves to P. Zapotec sitting next to Cray, and he says, \"These BEMs who\nlost their home planet in a nova, how many ships have they? Without a\nbase they cannot be very dangerous unless their fleet is very large.\"\n\nIt goes round the table.\n\nPavel: \"How would BEMs learn to write?\"\n\nNick: \"How are they supposed to know that Incognita is inhabited? How\ndo they address the letter?\"\n\nThe Crow: \"Huh. Why write letters? Invaders just invade.\"\n\nKirsty: \"We don't want to inflame these people against alien races. We\nmight find one some day. It seems to me this idea might have all sorts\nof undesirable by-products. Suppose each side regards it as a ruse on\nthe part of the other. We might touch off a war instead of preventing\nit. Suppose they turn over to preparations for repelling the invaders,\nto an extent that cripples their economy? Suppose a panic starts?\"\n\nDilly: \"Say, Mr. Chairman, is there any of this idea left at all? How\nabout an interim summary?\"\n\nEru coughs to get a moment for thought, then says:\n\n\"In brief, the problem is to provide a menace against which the two\ngroups will be forced to unite. It must have certain characteristics.\n\n\"It must be sufficiently far off in time for the threat to last\nseveral years, long enough to force them into a real combination.\n\n\"It must obviously be a plausible danger and they must get to know of\nit in a plausible manner. Invasion from outside is the only threat so\nfar suggested.\n\n\"It must be a limited threat. That is, it must appear to come from one\nwell-defined group. The rest of the Universe should appear benevolent\nor neutral.\"\n\nHe just stops, rather as though there is something else to come; while\nthe rest of us are waiting B sticks her oar in to the following\neffect.\n\n\"Yes, but look, suppose this goes wrong; it's all very well to make\nplans but suppose we get some of Kirsty's side-effects just the same,\nwell what I mean is suppose it makes the mess worse instead of better\nwe want some way we can sort of switch it off again.\n\n\"Look this is just an illustration, but suppose the Menace was\npirates, if it went wrong we could have an Earth ship make official\ncontact and they could just happen to say By the way have you seen\nanything of some pirates, Earth fleet wiped them up in this sector\nabout six months ago.\n\n\"That would mean the whole crew conniving, so it won't do, but you\nsee what I mean.\"\n\nThere is a bit of silence, then Aro says, \"I think we should start\nfresh. We have had criticisms of Lizzie's suggestion, which was not\nperhaps wholly serious, and as Dilly says there is little of it left,\nexcept the idea of a threat of invasion. The idea of an alien\nintelligent race has objections and would be very difficult to fake.\nThe invaders must be men from another planet. Another unknown one. But\nhow do the people of Incognita come to know that they exist?\"\n\nMore silence, then I hear my own voice speaking although it was my\nintention to keep quiet for once: it sounds kind of creaky and it\nsays: \"A ship. A crashed ship from Outside.\"\n\nWhereupon another voice says, \"Really! Am I expected to swallow this?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWe had just about forgotten the colonel, not to mention Mr. Yardo who\ncontributes another \"Ha! Ha!\" so this reminder comes as a slight\nshock, nor do we see what he is talking about but this he proceeds to\nexplain.\n\n\"I don't know why M'Clare thought it necessary to stage this\ndiscussion. I am already acquainted with his plan and have had orders\nto co-operate. I have expressed my opinion on using undergraduates in\na job like this and have been overruled. If he, or you, imagine that\npriming you to bring out his ideas like this is going to reconcile me\nto the whole business you are mistaken. He might have chosen a more\nsuitable mouthpiece than that child with the curly hair--\"\n\nHere everybody wishes to reply at once; the resulting jam produces a\nmoment of silence and I get in first.\n\n\"As for curly hair I am rising twenty-four and I was only saying what\nwe all thought, if we have the same ideas as M'Clare that is because\nhe taught us for four years. How else would you set about it anyway?\"\n\nMy fellow students pick up their stylers and tap solemnly three times\non the table; this is the Russett equivalent of \"Hear! Hear!\" and the\ncolonel is surprised.\n\nEru says coldly, \"This discussion has not been rehearsed. As Lizzie ... as\nMiss Lee says, we have been working and thinking together for four years\nand have been taught by the same people.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" says Delano-Smith testily. \"Tell me this, please: Do you\nregard this idea as practicable?\"\n\nCray tilts his chair back and remarks to the ceiling, \"This is rather\na farce. I suppose we had to go through our paces for the colonel's\nbenefit--and Mr. Yardo's of course--but can't we be briefed properly\nnow?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" snaps the colonel.\n\n\"It's been obvious right along,\" says Cray, balancing his styler on\none forefinger, \"so obvious none of us has bothered to mention it,\nthat accepting the normal limitations of Mass-Time, the idea of\ninterfering in Incognita was doomed before it began. No conventional\nship would have much hope of arriving before war broke out; and if it\ndid arrive it couldn't do anything effective. Therefore I assume that\nthis is not a conventional ship. I might accept that the Government\nhas sent us out in a futile attempt to do the impossible, but I\nwouldn't believe that of M'Clare.\"\n\nCray is the only Terry I know acts like an Outsider's idea of one;\nmany find this difficult to take and the colonel is plainly one of\nthem. Eru intervenes quickly.\n\n\"I imagine we all realized that. Anyway this ship is obviously not a\nconventional model. If you accept the usual Mass-Time relationship\nbetween the rate of transition and the fifth power of the apparent\nacceleration, we must have reached about four times the maximum\nalready.\"\n\n\"Ram!\" says B suddenly, \"What did you do to stop the Hotel scope\nregistering the little ship you picked up me and Lizzie in?\"\n\nEverybody cuts in with something they have noticed about the\ncapabilities of this ship or the hoppers, and Lenny starts hammering\non the table and chanting! \"Brief! Brief! Brief!\" and others are just\nstarting to join in when Eru bangs on the table and glares us all\ndown.\n\nHaving got silence, he says very quietly, \"Colonel Delano-Smith, I\ndoubt whether this discussion can usefully proceed without a good deal\nmore information; will you take over?\"\n\nThe colonel looks round at all the eager earnest interested maps\nhastily put on for his benefit and decides to take the plunge.\n\n\"Very well. I suppose it is ... very well. The decision to use\nstudents from Russett was made at a very high level, and I suppose--\"\nInstead of saying \"Very well\" again he shrugs his shoulders and gets\ndown to it.\n\n\"The report from the planet we decided to call 'Incognita' was\nreceived thirty-one days ago. The Department of Spatial Affairs has\ncertain resources which are not generally known. This ship is one of\nthem. She works on a modified version of Mass-Time which enables her\nto use about a thousand channels instead of the normal limit of two\nhundred; for good and sufficient reasons this has not been generally\nreleased.\"\n\nPause while we are silently dared to doubt the Virtue and sufficiency\nof these reasons which personally I do not.\n\n\"To travel to Incognita direct would take about fifteen days by the\nshortest route. We shall take eighteen days as we shall have to make a\ndetour.\"\n\nBut presumably we shall take only fifteen days back. Hurrah we can\nspend a week round the planet and still be back in time for\nCommemoration. We shall skip maybe a million awkward questions and I\nshall not disappoint Dad.\n\nIt is plain the colonel is not filled with joy; far from it, he did\nnot enjoy revealing a Departmental secret however obvious, but he\nlikes the next item even less.\n\n\"We shall detour to an uninhabited system twelve days' transit time\nfrom here and make contact with another ship, the _Gilgamesh_.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt which Lennie DiMaggio who has been silent till now brings his fist\ndown on the table and exclaims, \"You _can't_!\"\n\nLennie is much upset for some reason; Delano-Smith gives him a\npeculiar look and says what does he know about it? and Lennie starts\nto stutter.\n\nCray remarks that Lennie's childhood hobby appears to have been\nspaceships and he suffers from arrested development.\n\nB says it is well known Lennie is mad about the Space Force and why\nnot? It seems to have uses Go on and tell us Lennie.\n\nLennie says \"_G-Gilgamesh_ was lost three hundred years ago!\"\n\n\"The flaw in that statement,\" says Cray after a pause, \"is that this\nmay be another ship of the same name.\"\n\n\"No,\" says the colonel. \"Explorer Class cruiser. They went out of\nservice two hundred eighty years back.\"\n\nThe Space Force, I remember, does not re-use names of lost ships: some\nsays Very Proper Feeling some say Superstitious Rot.\n\nB says, \"When was she found again?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nLennie says it was j-just thirty-seven revolutions of his native\nplanet which means f-f-fifty-three Terrestrial years ago, she was\nfound by an Interplanetary scout called _Crusoe_.\n\nJudging by the colonel's expression this data is Classified; he does\nnot know that Lennie's family come from one of the oldest settled\nplanets and are space-goers to a man, woman, and juvenile; they pick\nup ship gossip the way others hear about the relations of people next\ndoor.\n\nLennie goes on to say that the Explorer Class were the first official\nexploration ships sent out from Earth when the Terries decided to find\nout what happened to the colonies formed during the Exodus.\n_Gilgamesh_ was the first to re-make contact with Garuda, Legba,\nLister, Cor-bis and Antelope; she vanished on her third voyage.\n\n\"Where was she found?\" asks Eru.\n\n\"Near the p-p-pole of an uninhabited planet--maybe I shouldn't say\nwhere because that may be secret, but the rest's History if you know\nwhere to look.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMaybe the colonel approves this discretion; anyway his face thaws very\nslightly unless I am Imagining it.\n\n\"_Gilgamesh_ crashed,\" he says. \"Near as we can make out from the log,\nshe visited Seleucis system. That's a swarmer sun. Fifty-seven\nplanets, three settled; and any number of fragments. The navigator\ncalculated that after a few more revolutions one of the fragments was\ngoing to crash on an inhabited planet. Might have done a lot of\ndamage. They decided to tow it out of the way.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Grappling-beams hadn't been invented. They thought they could use\nMass-Time on it a kind of reverse thrust--throw it off course.\n\n\"Mass-Time wasn't so well understood then. Bit off more than they\ncould chew. Set up a topological relation that drained all the free\nenergy out of the system. Drive, heating system--everything.\n\n\"She had emergency circuits. When the engines came on again they took\nover--landed the ship, more or less, on the nearest planet. Too late,\nof course. Heating system never came on--there was a safety switch\nthat had to be thrown by hand. She was embedded in ice when she was\nfound. Hull breached at one point--no other serious damage.\"\n\n\"And the ... the crew?\"\n\nDillie ought to know better than that.\n\n\"Lost with all hands,\" says the colonel.\n\n\"How about weapons?\"\n\nWe are all startled. Cray is looking whitish like the rest of us but\nmaintains his normal manner, i.e. offensive affection while pointing\nout that _Gilgamesh_ can hardly be taken for a Menace unless she has\nsome means of aggression about her.\n\nLennie says The Explorer Class were all armed--\n\nFine, says Cray, presumably the weapons will be thoroughly obsolete\nand recognizable only to a Historian--\n\nLennie says the construction of no weapon developed by the Space\nDepartment has ever been released; making it plain that anyone but a\nNitwit knows that already.\n\nEru and Kirsty have been busy for some time writing notes to each\nother and she now gives a small sharp cough and having collected our\nattention utters the following Address.\n\n\"There is a point we seem to have missed. If I may recapitulate, the\nidea is to take this ship _Gilgamesh_ to Incognita and make it appear\nas though she had crashed there while attempting to land. I understand\nthat the ship has been buried in the polar cap; though she must have\nbeen melted out if the people on _Crusoe_ examined the engines. Of\ncourse the cold--All the same there may have been ... well ...\nchanges. Or when ... when we thaw the ship out again--\"\n\nI find I am swallowing good and hard, and several of the others look\nsick, especially Lennie. Lennie has his eyes fixed on the colonel; it\nis not prescience, but a slight sideways movement of the colonel's eye\ncauses him to blurt out, \"What is _he_ doing here?\"\n\nMeaning Mr. Yardo who seems to have been asleep for some time, with\nhis eyes open and grinning like the spikes on a dog collar. The\ncolonel gives him another sideways look and says, \"Mr. Yardo is an\nexpert on the rehabilitation of space-packed materials.\"\n\nThis is stuff transported in un-powered hulls towed by\ngrappling-beams; the hulls are open to space hence no need for\nrefrigeration, and the contents are transferred to specially equipped\norbital stations before being taken down to the planet. But--\n\nMr. Yardo comes to life at the sound of his name and his grin widens\nalarmingly.\n\n\"Especially meat,\" he says.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is maybe two hours afterwards, Eru having adjourned the meeting\nabruptly so that we can ... er ... take in the implications of the new\ndata. Lennie has gone off somewhere by himself; Kirsty has gone after\nhim with a view to Mothering him; Eru, I suspect, is looking for\nKirsty; Pavel and Aro and Dillie and the Crow are in a cabin arguing\nin whispers; Nick and P. Zapotec are exploring one of the Hoppers,\ncargo-carrying, drop-shaped, and I only hope they don't hop through\nthe hull in it.\n\nB and I having done a tour of the ship and ascertained all this have\nwithdrawn to the Conference Room because we are tired of our cabins\nand this seems to be the only other place to sit.\n\nB breaks a long silence with the remark that However often you see it\nM'Clare's technique is something to watch, like choosing my statement\nto open with, it broke the ice beautifully.\n\nI say, \"Shall I tell you something?\"\n\nB says Yes if it's interesting.\n\n\"My statement,\" I inform her, \"ran something like this: The best hope\nof inducing a suspension of the aggressive attitude of both parties,\nlong enough to offer hope of ultimate reconciliation, lies in the\nintrusion of a new factor in the shape of an outside force seen to be\nimpartially hostile to both.\"\n\nB says: \"Gosh. Come to think of it Liz you have not written like that\nin years, you have gone all pompous like everyone else; well that\nmakes it even _more_ clever of M'Clare.\"\n\nEnter Cray Patterson and drapes himself sideways on a chair,\nannouncing that his own thoughts begin to weary him.\n\nI say this does not surprise me, at all.\n\n\"Lizzie my love,\" says he, \"you are twice blessed being not only witty\nyourself but a cause of wit in others; was that bit of Primitive Lee\nwith which M'Clare regaled us really not from the hand of the\nmistress, or was it a mere pastiche?\"\n\nI say Whoever wrote that it was not me anyway.\n\n\"It seemed to me pale and luke-warm compared with the real thing,\"\nsays Cray languidly, \"which brings me to a point that, to quote dear\nKirsty, seems to have been missed.\"\n\nI say, \"Yep. Like what language it was that these people wrote their\nlog in that we can be _certain_ the Incognitans won't know.\"\n\n\"More than that,\" says B, \"we didn't decide who they are or where they\nwere coming from or how they came to crash or anything.\"\n\n\"Come to think of it, though,\" I point out, \"the language and a good\nmany other things must have been decided already because of getting\nthe right hypnotapes and translators on board.\"\n\nB suddenly lights up.\n\n\"Yes, but look, I bet that's what we're here for, I mean that's why\nthey picked us instead of Space Department people--the ship's got to\nhave a past history, it has to come from a planet somewhere only no\none must ever find out _where_ it's supposed to be. Someone will have\nto fake a log, only I don't see how--\"\n\n\"The first reel with data showing the planet of origin got damaged\nduring the crash,\" says Cray impatiently.\n\n\"Yes, of course--but we have to find a reason why they were in that\npart of Space and it has to be a _nice_ one, I mean so that the\nIncognitans when they finally read the log won't hate them any more--\"\n\n\"Maybe they were bravely defending their own planet by hunting down an\ninterplanetary raider,\" I suggest.\n\nCray says it will take only the briefest contact with other planets to\nconvince the Incognitans that interplanetary raiders can't and don't\nexist, modern planetary alarm and defense systems put them out of the\nquestion.\n\n\"That's all he knows,\" says B, \"some interplanetary pirates raided\nLizzie's father's farm once. Didn't they, Liz?\"\n\n\"Yes in a manner of speaking, but they were bums who pinched a\nspaceship from a planet not many parsecs away, a sparsely inhabited\nmining world like my own which had no real call for an alarm system,\nso that hardly alters the argument.\"\n\n\"Well,\" says B, \"the alarm system on Incognita can't be so hot or the\nobservation ships could not have got in, or out, for that matter,\nunless of course they have some other gadget we don't know about.\"\n\n\"On the other hand,\" she considers, \"to mention Interplanetary raiders\nraises the idea of Menace in an Unfriendly Universe again, and this is\nwhat we want to cancel out.\n\n\"These people,\" she says at last with a visionary look in her eye,\n\"come from a planet which went isolationist and abandoned space\ntravel; now they have built up their civilization to a point where\nthey can build ships of their own again, and the ones on Gilgamesh\nhave cut loose from the ideas of their ancestors that led to their\ngoing so far afield--\"\n\n\"How far afield?\" says Cray.\n\n\"No one will ever know,\" I point out to him. \"Don't interrupt.\"\n\n\"Anyway,\" says B, \"they set out to rejoin the rest of the Human Race\njust like the people on _Gilgamesh_ _really_ did, in fact, a lot of\nthis is the truth only kind of backwards--they were looking for the\nCradle of the Race, that's what. Then there was some sort of disaster\nthat threw them off course to land on an uninhabited section of a\nplanet that couldn't understand their signals. And when Incognita\nfinally does take to space flight again I bet the first thing the\npeople do is to try and follow back to where _Gilgamesh_ came from and\nmake contact with them. It'll become a legend on Incognita--the Lost\nPeople ... the Lost ... Lost--\"\n\n\"The Lost Kafoozalum,\" says Cray. \"In other words we switch these\npeople off a war only to send them on a wild goose chase.\"\n\nAt which a strange voice chimes in, \"No, no, no, son, you've got it\nall _wrong_.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Yardo is with us like a well-meaning skeleton.\n\nDuring the next twenty-five minutes we learn a lot about Mr. Yardo\nincluding material for a good guess at how he came to be picked for\nthis expedition; doubtless there are many experts on Reversal Of\nVacuum-Induced Changes in Organic Tissues but maybe only one of them a\nRomantic at heart.\n\nMr. Yardo thinks chasing the Wild Goose will do the Incognitans all\nthe good in the galaxy, it will take their minds off controversies\nover interhemispherical trade and put them on to the quest of the\nUnobtainable; they will get to know something of the Universe outside\ntheir own little speck. Mr. Yardo has seen a good deal of the Universe\nin the course of advising on how to recondition space-packed meat and\nhe found it an Uplifting Experience.\n\nWe gather he finds this desperate bit of damfoolery we are on now\npretty Uplifting altogether.\n\nCray keeps surprisingly quiet but it is as well that the rest of the\nparty start to trickle in about twenty minutes later the first\narrivals remarking Oh _that's_ where you've got to!\n\nPresently we are all congregated at one end of the table as before,\nexcept that Mr. Yardo is now sitting between B and me; when M'Clare\nand the colonel come in he firmly stays where he is evidently\nconsidering himself One of Us now.\n\n\"The proposition,\" says M'Clare, \"is that we intend to take\n_Gilgamesh_ to Incognita and land her there in such a way as to\nsuggest that she crashed. In the absence of evidence to the contrary\nthe Incognitans are bound to assume that that was her intended\ndestination, and the presence of weapons, even disarmed, will suggest\nthat her mission was aggressive. Firstly, can anyone suggest a better\ncourse of action? or does anyone object to this one?\"\n\nWe all look at Lennie who sticks his hands in his pockets and mutters\n\"No.\"\n\nKirsty gives her little cough and says there is a point which has not\nbeen mentioned.\n\nIf a heavily-armed ship crashes on Incognita, will not the government\nof the hemisphere in which it crashes be presented with new ideas for\noffensive weapons? And won't this make it _more_ likely that they will\nstart aggression? And won't the fear of this make the other hemisphere\neven more likely to try and get in first before the new weapons are\ncomplete?\n\nHell, I ought to have thought of that.\n\nFrom the glance of unwilling respect which the colonel bestows on\nM'Clare it is plain these points have been dealt with.\n\n\"The weapons on Gilgamesh were disarmed when she was rediscovered,\" he\nsays. \"Essential sections were removed. The Incognitans won't be able\nto reconstruct how they worked.\"\n\n_Another_ fact for which we shall have to provide an explanation. Well\nhow about this: The early explorers sent out by these people--the\npeople in Gilgamesh ... oh, use Cray's word and call them Lost\nKafoozalum anyway their ships were armed, but they never found any\nenemies and the Idealists of B's story refused even to carry arms any\nmore.\n\n(Which is just about what happened when the Terries set out to\nrediscover the colonies, after all.)\n\nSo the Lost Kafoozalum could not get rid of their weapons completely\nbecause it would have meant rebuilding the ship; so they just\npartially dismantled them.\n\nMr. Yardo suddenly chips in, \"About that other point, girlie, surely\nthere must be some neutral ground left on a half-occupied planet like\nthat?\" He beams round, pleased at being able to contribute.\n\nB says, \"The thing is,\" and stops.\n\nWe wait.\n\nWe have about given up hope when she resumes, \"The thing is, it will\nhave to be neutral ground of course, only that might easily become a\nthingummy ... I mean a, a _casus belli_ in itself. So the _other_\nthing is it ought to be a place which is very hard to get at, so\ndifficult that neither side can really get to it first, they'll have\nto reach an agreement and co-operate.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" says Dillie \"that sounds fine, but what sort of place is\nthat?\"\n\nI am sorting out in my head the relative merits of mountains,\ndeserts, gorges, et cetera, when I an seized with inspiration at the\nsame time as half the group; we say the same thing in different words\nand for a time there is Babel, then the idea emerges:\n\n\"Drop her into the sea!\"\n\nThe colonel nods resignedly.\n\n\"Yes,\" he says, \"that's what we're going to do.\"\n\nHe presses a button and our projection-screens light up, first with a\nmap of one pole of Incognita, expanding in scale till finally we are\nlooking down on one little bit of coast on one of the polar islands. A\nglacier descends on to it from mountains inland and there is a bay\nbetween cliffs. Then we get a stereo scene of approximately the least\nhospitable of scenery I ever did see--except maybe when Parvati Lal\nDutt's brother made me climb up what he swore was the smallest peak in\nthe Himalayas.\n\nIt is a small bay backed by tumbled cliffs. A shelving beach can be\ndeduced from contour and occasional boulders big enough to stick\nthrough the snow that smothers it all. A sort of mess of rocks and mud\nat the back may be glacial moraine. Over the sea the ice is split in\nall directions by jagged rifts and channels; the whole thing is a bit\nlike Antarctica but nothing is high enough or white enough to uplift\nthe spirit, it looks not only chilly but kind of mean.\n\n\"This place,\" says the colonel, \"is the only one, about which we have\nany topographical information, that seems to meet the requirements.\nGot to know about it through an elementary planetography. One of the\nobservers had the sense to see we might need something of the sort.\nThis place\"--the stereo jigs as he taps his projector--\"seems it's the\ncenter of a rising movement in the crust ... that's not to the point.\nNeither side has bothered to claim the land at the poles....\"\n\nI see their point if it's all like this--\n\n\"... And a ship trying to land on those cliffs might very well pitch\nover into the sea. That is, if she were trying to land on emergency\nrockets.\"\n\nRockets--that brings home the ancientness of this ship\n_Gilgamesh_--but after all the ships that settled Incognita probably\ncarried emergency rockets, too.\n\nThis settled, the meeting turns into a briefing session and merges\nimperceptibly with the beginning of the job.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe job of course is Faking the background of the crash; working out\nthe past history and present aims of the Lost Kafoozalum. We have to\ninvent a planet and what's more difficult convey all the essential\ninformation about it by the sort of sideways hints you gather among\npeoples' personal possessions; diaries, letters et cetera; and what is\neven _more_ difficult we have to leave out anything that could lead to\ndefinite identification of our unknown world with any known one.\n\nWe never gave that world a name; it might be dangerous. Who speaks of\ntheir world by name, except to strangers? They call it \"home\"--or\n\"Earth,\" as often as not.\n\nSome things have been decided for us. Language, for instance--one of\ntwo thousand or so Earth tongues that went out of use late enough to\nbe plausible as the main language of a colonized planet. The settlers\non Incognita were not of the sort to take along dictionaries of the\nlesser-known tongues, so the computers at Russett had a fairly wide\nchoice.\n\nWe had to take a hypnocourse in that language. Ditto the script, one\nof several forgotten phonetic shorthands. (Designed to enable the\ntongues of Aliens to be written down; but the Aliens have never been\nmet. It is plausible enough that some colony might have kept the\nscript alive; after all Thasia uses something of the sort to this\nday.)\n\nThe final result of our work looks pretty small. Twenty-three\n\"Personal Background Sets\"--a few letters, a diary in some, an\nassortment of artifacts. Whoever stocked this ship we are on supplied\nwood, of the half-dozen kinds that have been taken wherever men have\ngone; stocks of a few plastics--known at the time of the Exodus, or\neasily developed from those known, and not associated with any\nparticular planet. Also books on Design, a Form-writer for translating\ndrawings into materials, and so on. Someone put in a lot of work\nbefore this voyage began.\n\nMost of the time it is like being back on Russet doing a group\nProject. What we are working on has no more and no less reality than\nthat. Our work is all read into a computer and checked against\neverybody else's. At first we keep clashing. Gradually a consistent\npicture builds up and gets translated finally into the Personal\nBackground Kits. The Lost Kafoozalum start to exist like people in a\nHistory book.\n\nFifteen days hard work and we have just about finished; then we\nreach--call it Planet Gilgamesh.\n\nI wake in my bunk to hear that there will be brief cessation of\nweight; strap down, please.\n\nWe are coming off Mass-Time to go on planetary drive.\n\nColonel Delano-Smith is in charge of operations on the planet, with\nRam and Peter to assist. None of the rest of us see the melting out of\nfifty years' accumulation of ice, the pumping away of the water, the\nfitting and testing of the holds for the grappling-beams. We stay\ninside the ship, on five-eighths gee which we do not have time to get\nused to, and try to work, and discard the results before the computer\ncan do so. There is hardly any work left to do, anyway.\n\nIt takes nearly twelve hours to get the ship free, and caulked, and\nready to lift. (Her hull has to be patched because of Mr. Yardo's\noperations which make use of several sorts of vapors). Then there is a\nqueer blind period with Up now one way, now another, and sudden jerks\nand tugs that upset everything not in gimbals or tied down;\ninterspersed with periods when weightlessness supervenes with no\nwarning at all. After an hour or two of this it would be hard to say\nwhether Mental or physical discomfort is more acute; B consulted,\nhowever, says my autonomic system must be quite something, after five\nminutes _her_ thoughts were with her viscera entirely.\n\nThen, suddenly, we are back on Mass-Time again.\n\nTwo days to go.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt first being on Mass-Time makes everything seem normal again. By\nsleep time there is a strain, and next day it is everywhere. I know as\nwell as any that on Mass-Time the greater the mass the faster the\nshift; all the same I cannot help feeling we are being slowed, dragged\nback by the dead ship coupled to our live one.\n\nWhen you stand by the hull _Gilgamesh_ is only ten feet away.\n\nI should have kept something to work on like B and Kirsty who have not\ndone their Letters for Home in Case of Accidents; mine is signed and\nsealed long ago. I am making a good start on a Neurosis when\nDelano-Smith announces a Meeting for one hour ahead.\n\nHurrah! now there is a time-mark fixed I think of all sorts of things\nI should have done before; for instance taking a look at the controls\nof the Hoppers.\n\nI have been in one of them half an hour and figured out most of the\ndials--Up down and sideways are controlled much as in a helicar, but\nhere a big viewscreen has been hooked in to the autopilot--when\nacross the hold I see the air lock start to move.\n\n_Gilgamesh_ is on the other side.\n\nIt takes forever to open. When at last it swings wide on the dark\ntunnel what comes through is a storage rack, empty, floating on\nantigrav.\n\nWhat follows is a figure in a spacesuit; modern type, but the windows\nof the hopper are semipolarized and I cannot make out the face inside\nthe bubble top.\n\nHe slings the rack upon the bulkhead, takes off the helmet and hangs\nthat up, too. Then he just stands. I am beginning to muster enough\nsense to wonder why when he comes slowly across the hold.\n\nReaching the doorway he says: \"Oh it's you, Lizzie. You'll have to\nhelp me out of this. I'm stuck.\"\n\nM'Clare.\n\nThe outside of the suit is still freezing cold; maybe this is what has\njammed the fastening. After a few minutes tugging it suddenly gives\naway. M'Clare climbs out of the suit, leaving it standing, and says,\n\"Help me count these, will you?\"\n\n_These_ are a series of transparent containers from a pouch slung at\none side of the suit. I recognize them as the envelopes in which we\nput what are referred to as Personal Background Sets.\n\nI say, \"There ought to be twenty-three.\"\n\n\"No,\" says M'Clare dreamily, \"twenty-two, we're saving one of them.\"\n\n\"What on earth is the use of an extra set of faked documents and\noddments--\"\n\nHe seems to wake up suddenly and says: \"What are you doing here,\nLizzie?\"\n\nI explain and he wanders over to the hopper and starts to explain the\ncontrols.\n\nThere is something odd about all this. M'Clare is obviously dead\ntired, but kind of relaxed; seeing that the hour of Danger is only\nthirty-six hours off I don't understand it. Probably several of his\nstudents are going to have to risk their lives--\n\nI am on the point of seeing something important when the speaker\nannounces in the colonel's voice that Professor M'Clare and Miss Lee\nwill report to the Conference Room at once please.\n\nM'Clare looks at me and grins. \"Come along, Lizzie. Here's where we\ntake orders for once, you and I.\"\n\nIt is the colonel's Hour. I suppose that having to work with\nUndergraduates is something he could never quite forget, but from the way\nhe looks at us we might almost be Space Force personnel,--low-grade of\ncourse but respectable.\n\nEverything is at last worked out and he has it on paper in front of\nhim; he puts the paper four square on the table, gazes into the middle\ndistance and proceeds to recite.\n\n\"One. This ship will go off Mass-Time on 2nd August at 11.27 hours\nship's time....\n\n\"Thirty-six hours from now.\n\n\"... At a point one thousand miles vertically above Co-ordinates\n165OE, 7320S, on Planet Incognita, approximately one hour before\nmidnight local time.\n\n\"Going on planetary drive as close as that will indicate that\nsomething is badly wrong to begin with.\n\n\"Two. This ship will descend, coupled to _Gilgamesh_ as at present, to\na point seventy miles above the planetary surface. It will then\nuncouple, discharge one hopper, and go back on Mass-Time. Estimated\ntime for this stage of descent forty minutes.\n\n\"Three. The hopper will then descend on its own engines at the maximum\nspeed allowed by the heat-disposal system; estimated at thirty-seven\nminutes. _Gilgamesh_ will complete descent in thirty-three minutes.\nEngines of _Gilgamesh_ will not be used except for the heat-disposal\nand gyro auxiliaries. The following installations have been made to\nallow for the control of the descent; a ring of eight rockets in\npeltathene mounts around the tail and, and one outsize antigrav unit\ninside the nose. \"Sympathizer\" controls hooked up with a visiscreen\nand a computer have also been installed in the nose.\n\n\"Four. _Gilgamesh_ will carry one man only. The hopper will carry a\ncrew of three. The pilot of _Gilgamesh_ will establish the ship on the\nedge of the cliff, supported on antigrav a foot or so above the ground\nand leaning towards the sea at an angle of approximately 20\u00b0 with the\nvertical. Except for this landing will be automatic.\n\n\"Five.\"\n\nThe colonel's voice has lulled us into passive acceptance; now we are\njerked into sharper attention by the faintest possible check in it.\n\n\"The greatest danger attaching to the expedition is that the\nIncognitans may discover that the crash has been faked. This would be\ninevitable if they were to capture (a) the hopper; (b) any of the new\ninstallations in Gilgamesh, especially the antigrav; (c) any member of\nthe crew.\n\n\"The function of the hopper is to pick up the pilot of _Gilgamesh_ and\nalso to check that ground appearances are consistent. If not, they\nwill produce a landslip on the cliff edge, using power tools and\nexplosives carried for the purpose. That is why the hopper has a crew\nof three, but the chance of their having to do this is slight.\"\n\nSo I should think; ground appearances are supposed to show that\n_Gilgamesh_ landed using emergency rockets and then toppled over the\ncliff and this will be exactly what happened.\n\n\"The pilot will carry a one-frequency low-power transmitter activated\nby the change in magnetic field on leaving the ship. The hopper will\nremain at five hundred feet until this signal is received. It will\nthen pick up the pilot, check ground appearances, and rendezvous with\nthis ship at two hundred miles up at 18.27 hours.\"\n\nThe ship and the hopper both being radar-absorbent will not register\non alarm systems, and by keeping to planetary nighttime they should\nbe safe from being seen.\n\n\"Danger (b) will be dealt with as follows. The rocket-mounts being of\npeltathene will be destroyed by half an hour's immersion in water. The\ninstallations in the nose will be destroyed with Andite.\"\n\nAndite produces complete colecular disruption in a very short range,\nhardly any damage outside it; the effect will be as though the nose\nbroke off on impact; I suppose the Incognitans will waste a lot of\ntime looking for it on the bed of the sea.\n\n\"Four ten-centimeter cartridges will be inserted within the nose\ninstallations. The fuse will have two alternative settings. The first\nwill be timed to act at 12.50 hours, seven minutes after the estimated\ntime of landing. It will not be possible to deactivate it before 12.45\nhours. This takes care of the possibility of the pilot's becoming\nincapacitated during the descent.\n\n\"Having switched off the first fuse the pilot will get the ship into\nposition and then activate a second, timed to blow in ten minutes. He\nwill then leave the ship. When the antigrav is destroyed the ship\nwill, of course, fall into the sea.\n\n\"Six. The pilot of _Gilgamesh_ will wear a spacesuit of the pattern\nused by the original crew and will carry Personal Background Set\nnumber 23. Should he fail to escape from the ship the crew of the\nhopper will on no account attempt to rescue him.\"\n\nThe colonel takes up the paper, folds it in half and puts it down one\ninch further away.\n\n\"The hopper's crew,\" he says, \"will give the whole game away should\none of them fall into Incognitan hands, alive or dead. Therefore they\ndon't take any risks of it.\"\n\nHe lifts his gaze ceilingwards. \"I'm asking for three volunteers.\"\n\nSilence. Manning the hopper is definitely second best. Then light\nsuddenly bursts on me and I lift my hand and hack B on the ankle.\n\n\"I volunteer,\" I say.\n\nB gives me a most dubious glance and then lifts her hand, too.\n\nCray on the other side of the table is slowly opening his mouth when\nthere is an outburst of waving on the far side of B.\n\n\"Me too, colonel! I volunteer!\"\n\nMr. Yardo proceeds to explain that his special job is over and done,\nhe can be more easily spared than anybody, he may be too old to take\ncharge of _Gilgamesh_ but will back himself as a hopper pilot against\nanybody.\n\nThe colonel cuts this short by accepting all three. He then unfolds\nhis paper again.\n\n\"Piloting _Gilgamesh_,\" he says. \"I'm not asking for volunteers now.\nYou'll go to your cabins in four hours' time and those who want to\nwill volunteer, secretly. To a computer hookup, Computer will select\non a random basis and notify the one chosen. Give him his final\ninstructions, too. No one need know who it was till it's all over. He\ncan tell anyone he likes, of course.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nA very slight note of triumph creeps into the next remark. \"One point.\nOnly men need volunteer.\"\n\nInstant outcry from Kirsty and Dilly: B turns to me with a look of\nawe.\n\n\"Nothing to do with prejudice,\" says the colonel testily. \"Just facts.\nThe crew of _Gilgamesh_ were all men. Can't risk one solitary woman\nbeing found on board. Besides--spacesuits, personal background\nsets--all designed for men.\"\n\nKirsty and Dilly turn on me looks designed to shrivel and B whispers\n\"Lizzie how wonderful you are.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe session dissolves. We three get an intensive session course of\ninstruction on our duties and are ordered off to sleep. After\nbreakfast next morning I run into Cray who says, Before I continue\nabout what is evidently pressing business would I care to kick him,\nhard?\n\nNot right now I reply, what for anyway?\n\n\"Miss Lee,\" says Cray, dragging it out longer than ever, \"although I\nhave long realized that your brain functions in a way much superior to\nlogic I had not sense enough yesterday to follow my own instinct and\ndo what you do as soon as you did it; therefore that dessicated meat\nhandler got in first.\"\n\nI say: \"So you weren't picked for pilot? It was only one chance in\nten.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" says Cray, \"did you really think so?\" He gives me a long look\nand goes away.\n\nI suppose he noticed that when the colonel came out with his remarks\nabout No women in Gilgamesh I was as surprised as any.\n\nPresently the three of us are issued with protective clothing; we just\nmight have to venture out on the planet's surface and therefore we get\nwhite one-piece suits to protect against Cold, heat, moisture,\ndessication, radioactivity, and mosquitoes, and they are quite\nbecoming, really.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nB and I drag out dressing for thirty minutes; then we just sit while\nTime crawls asymptotically towards the hour.\n\nThen the speaker calls us to go.\n\nWe are out of the cabin before it says two words and racing for the\nhold; so that we are just in time to see a figure out of an Historical\nmovie--padded, jointed, tin bowl for head and blank reflecting glass\nwhere the face should be--stepping through the air lock.\n\nThe colonel and Mr. Yardo are there already. The colonel packs us into\nthe hopper and personally closes the door, and for once I know what\nhe is thinking; he is wishing he were not the only pilot in this ship\nwho could possibly rely on bringing the ship off and on Mass-Time at\none particular defined spot of Space.\n\nThen he leaves us; half an hour to go.\n\nThe light in the hold begins to alter. Instead of being softly\ndiffused it separates into sharp-edged beams, reflecting and\ncrisscrossing but leaving cones of shadow between. The air is being\npumped into store.\n\nFifteen minutes.\n\nThe hull vibrates and a hatch slides open in the floor so that the\nblack of Space looks through; it closes again.\n\nMr. Yardo lifts the hopper gently off its mounts and lets it back\nagain.\n\nTesting; five minutes to go.\n\nI am hypnotized by my chronometer; the hands are crawling through\nglue; I am still staring at it when, at the exact second, we go off\nMass-Time.\n\nNo weight. I hook my heels under the seat and persuade my esophagus\nback into place. A new period of waiting has begun. Every so often\ncomes the impression we are falling head-first; the colonel using\nship's drive to decelerate the whole system. Then more free fall.\n\nThe hopper drifts very slowly out into the hold and hovers over the\nhatch, and the lights go. There is only the glow from the visiscreen\nand the instrument board.\n\nOne minute thirty seconds to go.\n\nThe hatch slides open again. I take a deep breath.\n\nI am still holding it when the colonel's voice comes over the speaker:\n\"Calling _Gilgamesh_. Calling the hopper. Good-by and Good luck.\nYou're on your own.\"\n\nThe ship is gone.\n\nYet another stretch of time has been marked off for us. Thirty-seven\nminutes, the least time allowable if we are not to get overheated by\nfriction with the air. Mr. Yardo is a good pilot; he is concentrating\nwholly on the visiscreen and the thermometer. B and I are free to look\naround.\n\nI see nothing and say so.\n\nI did not know or have forgotten that Incognita has many small\nsatellites; from here there are four in sight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI am still looking at them when B seizes my arm painfully and points\nbelow us.\n\nI see nothing and say so.\n\nB whispers it was there a moment ago, it is pretty cloudy down\nthere--Yes Lizzie there it is _look_.\n\nAnd I see it. Over to the left, very faint and far below, a pin-prick\nof light.\n\nLight in the polar wastes of a sparsely inhabited planet, and since we\nare still five miles up it is a very powerful light too.\n\nNo doubt about it, as we descend farther; about fifty miles from our\nobjective there are men, quite a lot of them.\n\nI think it is just then that I understand, _really_ understand, the\nhazard of what we are doing. This is not an exercise. This is in dead\nearnest, and if we have missed an essential factor or calculated\nsomething wrong the result will be not a bad mark or a failed exam, or\neven our personal deaths, but incalculable harm and misery to millions\nof people we never even heard of.\n\nDead earnest. How in Space did we ever have cheek enough for this?\n\nThe lights might be the essential factor we have missed, but there is\nnothing we can do about them now.\n\nMr. Yardo suddenly chuckles and points to the screen.\n\n\"There you are, girlies! He's down!\"\n\nThere, grayly dim, is the map the colonel showed us; and right on the\nfaint line of the cliff-edge is a small brilliant dot.\n\nThe map is expanding rapidly, great lengths of coastline shooting out\nof sight at the edge of the screen. Mr. Yardo has the cross-hairs\ncentered on the dot which is _Gilgamesh_. The dot is changing shape;\nit is turning into a short ellipse, a longer one. The gyros are\nleaning her out over the sea.\n\nI look at my chronometer; 12.50 hours exactly. B looks, too, and grips\nmy hand.\n\nThirty seconds later the Andite has not blown; first fuse safety\nturned off. Surely she is leaning far enough out by now?\n\nWe are hovering at five hundred feet. I can actually see the white\nedge of the sea beating at the cliff. Mr. Yardo keeps making small\ncorrections; there is a wind out there trying to blow us away. It is\ncloudy here: I can see neither moons nor stars.\n\nMr. Yardo checks the radio. Nothing yet.\n\nI stare downwards and fancy I can see a metallic gleam.\n\nThen there is a wordless shout from Mr. Yardo; a bright dot hurtles\nacross the screen and at the same time I see a streak of blue flame\ntearing diagonally downwards a hundred feet away.\n\nThe hopper shudders to a flat concussion in the air, we are all thrown\noff balance, and when I claw my way back to the screen the moving dot\nis gone.\n\nSo is _Gilgamesh_.\n\nB says numbly, \"But it wasn't a meteor. It can't have been.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter what it was,\" I say. \"It was some sort of missile,\nI think. They must be even nearer to war than we thought.\"\n\nWe wait. What for, I don't know. Another missile, perhaps. No more\ncome.\n\nAt last Mr. Yardo stirs. His voice sounds creaky.\n\n\"I guess,\" he says, then clears his throat, and tries again. \"I guess\nwe have to go back up.\"\n\nB says, \"Lizzie, who was it? Do you know?\"\n\nOf course I do. \"Do you think M'Clare was going to risk one of us on\nthat job? The volunteering was a fake. He went himself.\"\n\nB whispers, \"You're just guessing.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" says Mr. Yardo, \"but I happened to see through that face\nplate of his. It was the professor all right.\"\n\nHe has his hand on the controls when my brain starts working again. I\nutter a strangled noise and dive for the hatch into the cargo hold. B\ntries to grab me but I get it open and switch on the light.\n\nFifty-fifty chance--I've lost.\n\n_No_, this is the one we came in and the people who put in the new\ncargo did not clear out my fish-boat, they just clamped it neatly to\nthe wall.\n\nI dive in and start to pass up the package. B shakes her head.\n\n\"No, Lizzie. We can't. Don't you remember? If we got caught, it would\ngive everything away. Besides ... there isn't any chance--\"\n\n\"Take a look at the screen,\" I tell her.\n\nSharp exclamation from Mr. Yardo. B turns to look, then takes the\npackage and helps me back.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMr. Yardo maneuvers out over the sea till the thing is in the middle\nof the screen; then drops to a hundred feet. It is sticking out of the\nwater at a fantastic angle and the waves are hardly moving it. The\nnose of a ship.\n\n\"The antigrav,\" whispers B. \"The Andite hasn't blown yet.\"\n\n\"Ten minutes,\" says Mr. Yardo thoughtfully. He turns to me with sudden\nbriskness. \"What's that, Lizzie girl? A fish-boat? Good. We may need\nit. Let's have a look.\"\n\n\"It's mine,\" I tell him.\n\n\"Now look--\"\n\n\"Tailor made,\" I say. \"You might get into it, though I doubt it. You\ncouldn't work the controls.\"\n\nIt takes him fifteen seconds to realize there is no way round it; he\nis six foot three and I am five foot one. Even B would find it hard.\n\nHis face goes grayish and he stares at me helplessly. Finally he nods.\n\n\"All right, Lizzie. I guess we have to try it. Things certainly can't\nbe much worse than they are. We'll go over to the beach there.\"\n\nOn the beach there is wind and spray and breakers but nothing\nunmanageable; the cliffs on either side keep off the worst of the\nforce. It is queer to feel moving air after eighteen days in a ship.\nIt takes six minutes to unpack and expand the boat and by that time it\nis ten minutes since the missile hit and the Andite has not blown.\n\nI crawl into the boat. In my protective clothing it is a fairly tight\nfit. We agree that I will return to this same point and they will\nstart looking for me in fifty minutes' time and will give up if I have\nnot returned in two hours. I take two Andite cartridges to deal with\nall eventualities and snap the nose of the boat into place. At first I\nam very conscious of the two little white cigars in the pouch of my\nsuit, but presently I have other things to think about.\n\nI use the \"limbs\" to crawl the last few yards of shingle into the\nwater and on across the sea bottom till I am beyond the line of\nbreakers; then I turn on the motor. I have already set the controls to\n\"home\" on _Gilgamesh_ and the radar will steer me off any\nobstructions. This journey in the dark is as safe as my trip around\nthe reefs before all this started--though it doesn't feel that way.\n\nIt takes twelve minutes to reach _Gilgamesh_, or rather the fragment\nthat antigrav is supporting; it is about half a mile from the beach.\n\nThe radar stops me six feet from her and I switch it off and turn to\nManual and inch closer in.\n\nLights, a very small close beam. The missile struck her about one\nthird of her length behind the nose. I know, because I can see the\nwhole of that length. It is hanging just above the water, sloping at\nabout 30\u00b0 to the horizontal. The ragged edge where it was torn from\nthe rest is just dipping into the sea.\n\nIf anyone sees this, I don't know what they will make of it but no one\ncould possibly think an ordinary spaceship suffered an ordinary crash,\nand very little investigation would show up the truth.\n\nI reach up with the forward set of \"limbs\" and grapple on to the\nbreak. I now have somehow to get the hind set of \"limbs\" up without\nlosing my grip. I can't.\n\nIt takes several minutes to realize that I can just open the nose and\ncrawl out.\n\nImmediately a wave hits me in the face and does its best to drag me\ninto the sea. However the interior of the ship is relatively sheltered\nand presently I am inside and dragging the boat up out of reach.\n\nI need light. Presently I manage to detach one of the two from the\nboat. I turn it down to minimum close beam and hang it round my neck;\nthen I start up the black jag-edged tunnel of the ship.\n\nI have to get to the nose, find the fuse, change the setting to twenty\nminutes--maximum possible--and get out before it blows--out of the\nwater I mean. The fish-boat is not constructed to take explosions even\nhalf a mile away. But the first thing is to find the fuse and I cannot\nmake out how _Gilgamesh_ is lying and therefore cannot find the door\nthrough this bulkhead; everything is ripped and twisted. In the end I\nfind a gap between the bulkhead itself and the hull, and squeeze\nthrough that.\n\nIn the next compartment things are more recognizable and I eventually\nfind the door. Fortunately ships are designed so that you can get\nthrough doors even when they are in the ceiling; actually here I have\nto climb up an overhang, but the surface is provided with rungs which\nmake it not too bad. Finally I reach the door. I shall have to use\nantigrav to get down ... why didn't I just turn it on and jump? I\nforgot I had it.\n\nThe door was a little way open when the missile struck; it buckled in\nits grooves and is jammed fast. I can get an arm through. No more. I\nswitch on antigrav and hang there directing the light round the\ncompartment. No rents anywhere, just buckling. This compartment is\ndivided by a partition and the door through that is open. There will\nbe another door into the nose on the other side.\n\nI bring back my feet ready to kick off on a dive through that doorway.\n\nBehind me, something stirs.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy muscles go into a spasm like the one that causes a falling dream,\nmy hold tears loose and I go tumbling through the air, rebound from a\nwall, twist, and manage to hook one foot in the frame of the door I\nwas aiming for. I pull myself down and turn off the antigrav; then I\njust shake for a bit.\n\nThe sound was--\n\nThis is stupid, with everything torn to pieces in this ship there is\nno wonder if bits shake loose and drop around--\n\nBut it was not a metallic noise, it was a kind of soft dragging, very\nsoft, that ended in a little thump.\n\nLike a--\n\nLike a loose piece of plastic dislodged from its angle of rest and\nslithering down, pull yourself together Lizzie Lee.\n\nI look through the door into the other half of this level. Shambles.\nSmashed machinery every which way, blocking the door, blocking\neverything. No way through at all.\n\nSuddenly I remember the tools. Mr. Yardo loaded the fish-boat with all\nit would take. I crawl back and return with a fifteen inch expanding\nbeam-lever, and overuse it; the jammed trap door does not slide back\nin its grooves but flips right out of them, bent double; it flies off\ninto the dark and clangs its way to rest.\n\nI am halfway through the opening when I hear the sound again. A soft\nslithering; a faint defeated thump.\n\nI freeze where I am, and then I hear the sigh; a long, long weary\nsound, almost musical.\n\nAn air leak somewhere in the hull and wind or waves altering the air\npressure below.\n\nAll the same I do not seem able to come any farther through this door.\n\nLight might help; I turn the beam up and play it cautiously around.\nThis is the last compartment, right in the nose; a sawn-off\ncone-shape. No breaks here, though the hull is buckled to my left and\nthe \"floor\"--the partition, horizontal when the ship is in the normal\noperating position, which holds my trap door--is torn up; some large\nheavy object was welded to a thin surface skin which has ripped away\nleaving jagged edges and a pattern of girders below.\n\nThere is no dust here; it has all been sucked out when the ship was\nopen to space; nothing to show the beam except the sliding yellow\nellipse where it touches the wall. It glides and turns, spiraling\ndown, deformed every so often where it crosses a projection or a dent,\ntill it halts suddenly on a spoked disk, four feet across and standing\nnearly eighteen inches out from the wall. The antigrav.\n\nI never saw one this size, it is like the little personal affairs as a\ngiant is like a pigmy, not only bigger but a bit different in\nproportion. I can see an Andite cartridge fastened among the spokes.\n\nThe fuse is a \"sympathizer\" but it is probably somewhere close. The\nellipse moves again. There is no feeling that I control it; it is\nhunting on its own. To and fro around the giant wheel. Lower. It halts\non a small flat box, also bolted to the wall, a little way below. This\nis it, I can see the dial.\n\nThe ellipse stands still, surrounding the fuse. There is something at\nthe very edge of it.\n\nWhen _Gilgamesh_ was right way up the antigrav was bolted to one wall,\nabout three feet above the floor. Now the lowest point is the place\nwhere this wall joins what used to be the floor. Something has fallen\ndown to that point and is huddled there in the dark.\n\nThe beam jerks suddenly up and the breath whoops out of me; a round\nthing sticking out of the wall--then I realize it is an archaic\nspace-helmet, clamped to the wall for safety when the wearer took it\noff.\n\nI take charge of the ellipse of light and move it slowly down, past\nthe fuse, to the thing below. A little dark scalloping of the edge of\nthe light. The tips of fingers. A hand.\n\nI turn up the light.\n\nWhen the missile struck the big computer was wrenched loose from the\nfloor. It careened down as the floor tilted, taking with it anything\nthat stood in its way.\n\nM'Clare was just stooping to the fuse, I think. The computer smashed\nagainst his legs and pinned him down in the angle between the wall and\nthe floor. His legs are hidden by it.\n\nBecause of the spacesuit he does not looked crushed; the thick clumsy\njoints have kept their roundness, so far as they are visible; only his\nhands and head are bare and vulnerable looking.\n\nI am halfway down, floating on minimum gravity, before it really\noccurs to me that he may be still alive.\n\nI switch to half and drop beside him. His face is colorless but he is\nbreathing all right.\n\nFirst-aid kit. I will never make fun of Space Force thoroughness\nagain. Rows and rows of small plastic ampoules. Needles.\n\nPain-killer, first. I read the directions twice, sweating. Emergencies\nonly--this is. One dose _only_ to be given and if patient is not in\ngood health use--never mind that. I fit on the longest needle and jab\nit through the suit, at the back of the thigh, as far towards the\nknee-joint as I can get because the suit is thinner. Half one side,\nhalf the other.\n\nNow to get the computer off. At a guess it weighs about five hundred\npounds. The beam-lever would do it but it would probably fall back.\n\nAntigrav; the personal size is supposed to take up to three times the\nweight of the average man. I take mine off and buckle the straps\nthrough a convenient gap. I have my hands under the thing when M'Clare\nsighs again.\n\nHe is lying on his belly but his head is turned to one side, towards\nme. Slowly his eyelids open. He catches the sight of my hand; his head\nmoves a little, and he says, \"Lizzie. Golden Liz.\"\n\nI say not to worry, we will soon be out of here.\n\nHis body jumps convulsively and he cries out. His hand reaches my\nsleeve and feels. He says, \"Liz! Oh, God, I thought ... what--\"\n\nI say things are under control and just keep quiet a bit.\n\nHis eyes close. After a moment he whispers, \"Something hit the ship.\"\n\n\"A homing missile, I think.\"\n\nI ought not to have said that; but it seems to make no particular\nimpression, maybe he guessed as much.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI was wrong in wanting to shift the computer straight away, the\nrelease of pressure might start a hemorrhage; I dig out ampoules of\nblood-seal and inject them into the space between the suit and the\nflesh, as close to the damage as I can.\n\nM'Clare asks how the ship is lying and I explain, also how I got here.\nI dig out the six-by-two-inch packet of expanding stretcher and read\nthe directions. He is quiet for a minute or two, gathering strength;\nthen he says sharply: \"Lizzie. Stop that and listen.\n\n\"The fuse for the Andite is just under the antigrav. Go and find it.\nGo now. There's a dial with twenty divisions. Marked in black--you see\nit. Turn the pointer to the last division. Is that done?\n\n\"Now you see the switch under the pointer? Is your boat ready? I beg\nyour pardon, of course you left it that way. Then turn the switch and\nget out.\"\n\nI come back and see by my chrono that the blood-seal should be set; I\nget my hands under the computer. M'Clare bangs his hand on the floor.\n\n\"Lizzie, you little idiot, don't you realize that even if you get me\nout of this ship, which is next to impossible, you'll be delayed all\nthe way--and if the Incognitans find either of us the whole plan's\nruined? Much worse than ruined, once they see it's a hoax--\"\n\nI tell him I have two Andite sticks and they won't find us and on a\nnight like this any story of explosions will be put down to sudden\ngusts or to lightning.\n\nHe is silent for a moment while I start lifting the computer,\ncarefully; its effective weight with the antigrav full on is only\nabout twenty pounds but is has all its inertia. Then he says quietly,\n\"Please, Lizzie--can't you understand that the worst nightmare in the\nwhole affair has been the fear that one of you might get injured? Or\neven killed? When I realized that only one person was needed to pilot\n_Gilgamesh_--it was the greatest relief I ever experienced. Now you\nsay....\" His voice picks up suddenly. \"Lizzie, you're beaten anyway.\nThe ... I'm losing all feeling. Even pain. I can't feel anything\nbehind my shoulders ... it's creeping up--\"\n\nI say that means the pain-killer I shot him with is acting as\nadvertised, and he makes a sound as much like an explosive chuckle as\nanything and it's quiet again.\n\nThe curvature between floor and wall is not helpful, I am trying to\nfind a place to wedge the computer so it cannot fall back when I take\noff the antigrav. Presently I get it pushed on to a sort of ledge\nformed by a dent in the floor, which I think will hold it. I ease off\nthe antigrav and the computer stays put, I don't like the looks of it\nso let's get out of here.\n\nI push the packaged stretcher under his middle and pull the tape\nbefore I turn the light on to his legs to see the damage. I cannot\nmake out very much; the joints of the suit are smashed some, but as\nfar as I can see the inner lining is not broken which means it is\nstill air-and-water-tight.\n\nI put a hand under his chest to feel how the stretcher is going; it is\nnow expanded to eighteen inches by six and I can feel it pushing out,\nbut it is _slow_, what else have I to do--oh yes, get the helmet.\n\nI am standing up to reach for it when M'Clare says, \"What are you\ndoing? Yes ... well, don't put it on for a minute. There's something I\nwould like to tell you, and with all respect for your obstinacy I\ndoubt very much whether I shall have another chance. Keep that light\noff me, will you? It hurts my eyes.\n\n\"You know, Lizzie, I dislike risking the lives of any of the students\nfor whom I am responsible, but as it happens I find the idea of\nyou--blowing yourself to atoms particularly objectionable because ... I\nhappen to be in love with you. You're also one of my best students, I\nused to think that ... was why I'd been so insistent on your coming to\nRussett, but I rather think ... my motives were mixed even then. I meant\nto tell you this after you graduated, and to ask you to marry me, not\nthat ... I thought you would, I know quite well ... you never quite\nforgave me, but I don't-want-to-have to remember ... I didn't ... have\nthe guts to--\"\n\nHis voice trails off, I get a belated rush of sense to the head and\nturn the light on his face. His head is turned sideways and his fist\nis clenched against the side of his neck. When I touch it his hand\nfalls open and five discharged ampoules fall out.\n\nPain-killer.\n\nMaximum dose, one ampoule.\n\nAll that talk was just to hold my attention while he fixed the needles\nand--\n\nI left the kit spread out right next to him.\n\nWhile I am taking this in some small cold corner of my mind is\nremembering the instructions that are on the pain-killer ampoule; it\ndoes not say, outright, that it is the last refuge for men in the\nextremity of pain and despair; therefore it cannot say, outright, that\nthey sometimes despair too soon; but it does tell you the name of the\nantidote.\n\nThere are only three ampoules of this and they also say, maximum dose\none ampoule. I try to work it out but lacking all other information\nthe best I can do is inject two and keep one till later. I put that\none in my pocket.\n\nThe stretcher is all expanded now; a very thin but quite rigid grid,\nsix feet by two; I lash him on it without changing his position and\nfasten the helmet over his head.\n\nAntigrav; the straps just go round him and the stretcher.\n\nI point the thing up towards the trap door and give it a gentle push;\nthen I scramble up the rungs and get there just in time to guide it\nthrough. It takes a knock then and some more while I am getting it\ndown to the next partition, but he can't feel it.\n\nThis time I find the door, because the roar of noise behind it acts as\na guide. The sea is getting up and is dashing halfway to the door as I\ncrawl through. My boat is awash, pivoting to and fro on the grips of\nthe front \"limbs.\"\n\nI grab it, release the limbs and pull it as far back as the door. I\nmaneuver the stretcher on top and realize there is nothing to fasten\nit with ... except the antigrav, I get that undone, holding the\nstretcher in balance, and manage to put it under the stretcher and\npass the straps between the bars of the grid ... then round the little\nboat, and the buckle just grips the last inch. It will hold, though.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI set the boat to face the broken end of the ship, but I daren't put\nit farther back than the doorway; I turn the antigrav to half, fasten\nthe limb-grips and rush back towards the nose of the ship. Silver knob\nunder the dial. I turn it down, hear the thing begin a fast, steady\nticking, and turn and run.\n\nTwenty minutes.\n\nOne and a half to get back to the boat, four to get inside it without\noverturning. Nearly two to get down to the sea--balance difficult. One\nand a half to lower myself in.\n\nThirty seconds' tossing before I sink below the wave layer; then I\nturn the motor as high as I dare and head for the shore.\n\nIn a minute I have to turn it down; at this speed the radar is\nbothered by water currents and keeps steering me away from them as\nthough they were rocks; I finally find the maximum safe speed but it\nis achingly slow. What happens if you are in water when Andite blows\nhalf a mile away? A moment's panic as I find the ship being forced up,\nthen I realize I have reached the point where the beach starts to\nshelve, turn off radar and motor and start crawling. Eternal slow\nreach out, grab, shove, haul, with my heart in my mouth; then suddenly\nthe nose breaks water and I am hauling myself out with a last wave\ndoing its best to overbalance me.\n\nI am halfway out of the boat when the Andite blows behind me. There is\na flat slapping sound; then an instant roar of wind as the air\nreceives the binding energies of several tons of matter; then a long\nwave comes pelting up the beach and snatches at the boat.\n\nI huddle into the shingle and hold the boat; I have just got the\nantigrav turned off, otherwise I think it would have been carried\naway. There are two or three more big waves and a patter of spray;\nthen it is over.\n\nThe outlet valve of the helmet is working, so M'Clare is still\nbreathing; very deep, very slow.\n\nI unfasten the belt of the antigrav, having turned it on again, and\npull the belt through the buckle. No time to take it off and rearrange\nit; anyway it will work as well under the stretcher as on top of it. I\ndrag the boat down to the water, put in an Andite cartridge with the\nlongest fuse I have, set the controls to take it straight out to sea\nat maximum depth the radar control will allow--six feet above\nbottom--and push it off. The other Andite cartridge starts burning a\nhole in my pocket; I would have liked to put that in too, but I must\nkeep it, in case.\n\nI look at my chrono and see that in five minutes the hopper will come.\n\nFive minutes.\n\nI am halfway back to the stretcher when I hear a noise further up the\nbeach. Unmistakable. Shingle under a booted foot.\n\nI stand frozen in mid-stride. I turned the light out after launching\nthe boat but my eyes have not recovered yet; it is murkily black. Even\nmy white suit is only the faintest degree paler than my surroundings.\n\nSilence for a couple of minutes. I stand still. But it can't have gone\naway. What happens when the hopper comes? They will see whoever it is\non the infrared vision screen. They won't come--\n\nFootsteps again. Several.\n\nThen the clouds part and one of those superfluous little moons shines\nstraight through the gap.\n\nThe bay is not like the stereo the colonel showed because that was\ntaken in winter; now the snow is melted, leaving bare shingle and mud\nand a tumble of rocks; more desolate than the snow. Fifty feet off is\na man.\n\nHe is huddled up in a mass of garments but his head is bare, rising\nout of a hood which he has pushed back, maybe so as to listen better;\nhe looks young, hardly older than me. He is holding a long thin object\nwhich I never saw before, but it must be a weapon of some sort.\n\nThis is the end of it. All the evidence of faking is destroyed; except\nM'Clare and me. Even if I use the Andite he has seen me--and that\nleaves M'Clare.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nI am standing here on one foot like a dancer in a jammed movie,\nwaiting for Time to start again or the world to end--\n\nLike the little figure in the dance-instruction kit Dad got when I was\nseven, when you switched her off in the middle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLike a dancer--\n\nMy weight shifts on to the forward foot. My arms swing up, forwards,\nback. I take one step, another.\n\nSwing. Turn. Kick. Sideways.\n\nLike the silly little dancer who could not get out of the plastic\nblock; but I am moving forward little by little, even if I have to\ntake three steps roundabout for every one in advance.\n\nArms, up. Turn, round. Leg, up. Straighten, out. Step.\n\nCalled the Dance of the Little Robot, for about three months Dad\nthought it was no end cute, till he caught on I was thinking so, too.\n\nIt is just about the only kind of dance you could do on shingle, I\nguess.\n\nWhen this started I thought I might be going crazy, but I just had not\nhad time to work it out. In terms of Psychology it goes like this; to\nshoot off a weapon a man needs a certain type of Stimulus like the\nsight of an enemy over the end of it. So if I do my best not to look\nlike an enemy he will not get that Stimulus. Or put it another way\nmost men think twice before shooting a girl in the middle of a dance.\nIf I should happen to get away with this, nobody will believe his\nstory, he won't believe it himself.\n\nAs for the chance of getting away with it, i.e., getting close enough\nto grab the gun or hit him with a rock or something, I know I would\nbecome a Stimulus to shooting before I did that but there are always\nthe clouds, if one will only come back over the moon again.\n\nI have covered half the distance.\n\nTwenty feet from him, and he takes a quick step back.\n\nTurn, kick, out, step. I am swinging round away from him, let's hope\nhe finds it reassuring. I dare not look up but I think the light is\ndimming. Turn, kick, out, step. Boxing the compass. Coming round\nagain.\n\nAnd the cloud is coming over the moon, out of the corner of my eye I\nsee darkness sweeping towards us--and I see his face of sheer horror\nas he sees it, too; he jumps back, swings up the weapon, and fires\nstraight in my face.\n\nAnd it is dark. So much for Psychology.\n\nThere is a clatter and other sounds--\n\nWell, quite a lot for Psychology maybe, because at twenty feet he\nseems to have missed me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI pick myself up and touch something which apparently is his weapon,\ngun or whatever. I leave it and hare back to the stretcher, next-to\nfall over it but stop just in time, and switch on the antigrav. Up;\nlevel it; now where to? The cliffs enclosing the bay are about thirty\nyards off to my left and they offer the only cover.\n\nThe shingle is relatively level; I make good time till I stumble\nagainst a rock and nearly lose the stretcher. I step up on to the rock\nand see the cliff as a blacker mass in the general darkness, only a\nyard away. I edge the stretcher round it.\n\nIt is almost snatched out of my hand by a gust of wind. I pull it back\nand realize that in the bay I have been sheltered; there is pretty\nnear half a gale blowing across the face of the cliff.\n\nVoices and footsteps, away back among the rocks where the man came\nfrom.\n\nIf the clouds part again they will see me, sure as shooting.\n\nI take a hard grip on the stretcher and scramble round the edge of the\ncliff.\n\nAfter the first gust the wind is not so bad; for the most part it is\ntrying to press me back into the cliff. The trouble is that I can't\nsee. I have to shuffle my foot forward, rubbing one shoulder against\nthe cliff to feel where it is because I have no hand free.\n\nAfter a few yards I come to an impasse; something more than knee high;\nboulder, ridge, I can't tell.\n\nI weigh on the edge of the stretcher and tilt it up to get it over the\nobstacle. With the antigrav full on it keeps its momentum and goes on\nmoving up. I try to check it, but the wind gets underneath.\n\nIt is tugging to get away; I step blindly upwards in the effort to\nkeep up with it. One foot goes on a narrow ledge, barely a toe hold. I\nam being hauled upwards. I bring the other foot up and find the top of\na boulder, just within reach. Now the first foot--\n\nAnd now I am on top of the boulder, but I have lost touch with the\ncliff and the full force of the wind is pulling the stretcher upwards.\nI get one arm over it and fumble underneath for the control of the\nantigrav; I must give it weight and put it down on this boulder and\nwait for the wind to drop.\n\nSuddenly I realize that my weight is going; bending over the stretcher\nputs me in the field of the antigrav. A moment later another gust\ncomes, and I realize I am rising into the air.\n\nGripping the edge of the stretcher with one hand I reach out the\nother, trying to grasp some projection on the face of the cliff. Not\nbeing able to see I simply push farther away till it is out of reach.\n\nWe are still rising.\n\nI pull myself up on the stretcher; there is just room for my toes on\neither side of M'Clare's legs. The wind roaring in my ears makes it\ndifficult to think.\n\nRods of light slash down at me from the edge of the cliff. For a\nmoment all I can do is duck; then I realize we are still well below\nthem, but rising every moment. The cliff-face is about six feet away;\nthe wind reflecting from it keeps us from being blown closer.\n\nI must get the antigrav off. I let myself over the side of the\nstretcher, hanging by one hand, and fumble for the controls. I can\njust reach. Then I realize this is no use. Antigrav controls are not\nmeant to go off with a click of the finger; they might get switched\noff accidentally. To work the switch and the safety you must have two\nhands, or one hand in the optimum position. My position is about as\nbad as it could be. I can stroke the switch with one finger; no more.\n\nI haul myself back on to the stretcher and realize we are only about\nsix feet under the beam of light. Only one thing left. I feel in my\npocket for the Andite. Stupidly, I am still also bending over the\noutlet valve of the helmet, trying to see whether M'Clare is still\nbreathing or not.\n\nThe little white cigar is not fused. I have to hold on with one hand.\nIn the end I manage to stick the Andite between thumb and finger-roots\nof that hand while I use the other to find the fuse and stick it over\nthe Andite. The shortest; three minutes.\n\nI think the valve is still moving--\n\nThen something drops round me; I am hauled tight against the\nstretcher; we are pulled strongly downwards with the wind buffeting\nand snatching, banged against the edge of something, and pulled\nthrough into silence and the dark.\n\nFor a moment I do not understand; then I recognize the feel of Fragile\nCargo, still clamping me to the stretcher, and I open my mouth and\nscream and scream.\n\nClatter of feet. Hatch opens. Fragile Cargo goes limp.\n\nI stagger to my feet. Faint light through the hatch; B's head. I hold\nout the Andite stick and she turns and shouts; and a panel slides open\nin the wall so that the wind comes roaring in.\n\nI push the stick through and the wind snatches it away and it is gone.\n\nAfter that--\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter that, for a while, nothing, I suppose, though I have no\nrecollection of losing consciousness; only without any sense of break\nI find I am flat on my back on one of the seats in the cabin of the\nhopper.\n\nI sit up and say \"How--\"\n\nB who is sitting on the floor beside me says that when the broadcaster\nwas activated of course they came at once, only while they were\nwaiting for the boat to reach land whole squads of land cars arrived\nand started combing the area, and some came up on top of the cliff and\nshone their headlights out over the sea so Mr. Yardo had to lurk\nagainst the cliff face and wait till I got into a position where he\ncould pick me up and it was _frightfully_ clever of me to think of\nfloating up on antigrav--\n\nI forgot about the broadcaster.\n\nI forgot about the hopper come to that, there seemed to be nothing in\nthe world except me and the stretcher and the enemy.\n\nStretcher.\n\nI say, \"Is M'Clare--\"\n\nAt which moment Mr. Yardo turns from the controls with a wide smile of\ntriumph and says \"Eighteen twenty-seven, girls!\" and the world goes\nweightless and swings upside down.\n\nThen still with no sense of any time-lapse I am lying in the big\nlighted hold, with the sound of trampling all round: it is somehow\nfiltered and far off and despite the lights there seems to be a globe\nof darkness around my head. I hear my own voice repeating, \"M'Clare?\nHow's M'Clare?\"\n\nA voice says distantly, without emphasis, \"M'Clare? He's dead.\"\n\nThe next time I come round it is dark. I am vaguely aware of having\nbeen unconscious for quite a while.\n\nThere is a single thread of knowledge connecting this moment with the\nlast: M'Clare's dead.\n\nThis is the central factor: I seem to have been debating it with\nmyself for a very long time.\n\nI suppose the truth is simply that the Universe never guarantees\nanything; life, or permanence, or that your best will be good enough.\n\nThe rule is that you have to pick yourself up and go on; and lying\nhere in the dark is not doing it.\n\nI turn on my side and see a cluster of self-luminous objects including\na light switch. I reach for it.\n\nHow did I get into a hospital?\n\nOn second thoughts it is a cabin in the ship, or rather two of them\nwith the partition torn out, I can see the ragged edge of it. There is\na lot of paraphernalia around; I climb out to have a look.\n\nHoly horrors what's happened? Someone borrowed my legs and put them\nback wrong; my eyes also are not functioning well, the light is set at\nMinimum and I am still dazzled. I see a door and make for it to get\nExplanations from somebody.\n\nArrived, I miss my footing and stumble against the door and on the\nother side someone says \"Hello, Lizzie. Awake at last?\"\n\nI think my heart stops for a moment. I can't find the latch. I am\nvaguely aware of beating something with my fists, and then the door\ngives, sticks, gives again and I stumble through and land on all fours\nthe other side of it.\n\nSomeone is calling: \"Lizzie! Are you hurt? Where the devil have they\nall got to? Liz!\"\n\nI sit up and say, \"They said you were _dead_!\"\n\n\"_Who_ did?\"\n\n\"I ... I ... someone in the hold. I said How's M'Clare? and they said\nyou were dead.\"\n\nM'Clare frowns and says gently, \"Come over here and sit down quietly\nfor a bit. You've been dreaming.\"\n\nHave I? Maybe the whole thing was a dream--but if so how far does it\ngo? Going down in the heli? The missile? The boat? Crawling through\nthe black tunnel of a broken ship?\n\nNo, because he is sitting in a sort of improvised chaise longue and\nhis legs are evidently strapped in place under the blanket; he is\nfumbling with the fastening or something.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI say \"Hey! Cut that out!\"\n\nHe straightens up irritably.\n\n\"Don't you start that, Lysistrata. I've been suffering the attentions\nof the damnedest collection of amateur nurses who ever handled a\nthermocouple, for over a week. I don't deny they've been very\nefficient, but when it comes to--\"\n\nOver a _week_?\n\nHe nods. \"My dear Lizzie, we left Incognita ten days ago. Amateur\nnursing again! They have some unholy book of rules which says that for\nExposure, Exhaustion and Shock the best therapy is sleep. I don't\ndoubt it, but it goes on to say that in extreme cases the patient has\nbeen known to benefit by as much as two weeks of it. I didn't find out\nthat they were trying it on you until about thirty-six hours ago when\nI began inquiring why you weren't around. They kept me under for three\ndays--in fact until their infernal Handbook said it was time for my\nleg muscles to have some exercise. Miss Lammergaw was the\nring-leader.\"\n\nNo wonder my legs feel as though someone exchanged the muscles for\ncotton wool, just wait till I get hold of Kirsty.\n\nIf it hadn't been for her, I shouldn't have spent ten days\nremembering, even in my sleep, that--\n\nI say, \"Hell's feathers, it was _you_!\"\n\nM'Clare makes motions as though to start getting out of his chair,\nlooking seriously alarmed. I say, \"It was your voice! When I asked--\"\n\nM'Clare, quite definitely, starts to blush. Not much, but some.\n\n\"Lizzie, I believe you're right. I have a sort of vague memory of\nsomeone asking how I was--and I gave what I took to be a truthful\nanswer. I remember it seemed quite inconceivable that I could be\nalive. In fact I still don't understand it. Neither Yardo nor Miss\nLaydon could tell me. How _did_ you get me out of that ship?\"\n\nWell, I do my best to explain, glossing over one or two points; at the\nfinish he closes his eyes and says nothing for a while.\n\nThen he says, \"So except for this one man who saw you, you left no\ntraces at all?\"\n\nNot that I know of, but--\n\n\"Do you know, five minutes later there were at least twenty men in\nthat bay, most of them scientists? They don't seem to have found\nanything suspicious. Visibility was bad, of course, and you can't\nleave foot-prints in shingle--\"\n\nHold on, what _is_ all this?\n\nM'Clare says, \"We've had two couriers while you were asleep. Yes, I\nknow it's not ordinarily possible for a ship on Mass-Time to get news.\nOne of these days someone will have an interesting problem in Cultural\nEngineering, working out how to integrate some of these Space Force\nsecrets into our economic and social structure without upsetting the\nwhole of the known volume. Though courier boats make their crews so\ninfernally sick I doubt whether the present type will ever come into\ncommon use. Anyway, we've had transcripts of a good many broadcasts\nfrom Incognita, the last dated four days ago; and as far as we can\ntell they're interpreting _Gilgamesh_ just as we meant them to.\n\n\"The missile, by the way, was experimental, waiting to be test-fired\nthe next day. The man in charge saw _Gilgamesh_ on the alarm screens\nand got trigger-happy. The newscasters were divided as to whether he\nshould be blamed or praised; they all seem to feel he averted a\nmenace, at least temporarily, but some of them think the invaders\ncould have been captured alive.\n\n\"The first people on the scene came from a scientific camp; you and\nMiss Laydon saw their lights on the way down. You remember that area\nis geophysically interesting? Well, by extraordinary good luck an\ninternational group was there studying it. They rushed straight off to\nthe site of the landing--they actually saw _Gilgamesh_, and she\nregistered on some of their astronomical instruments, too. They must\nbe a reckless lot. What's more, they started trying to locate her on\nthe sea bottom the next day. Found both pieces; they're still trying\nto locate the nose. They were all set to try raising the smaller piece\nwhen their governments both announced in some haste that they were\nsending a properly equipped expedition. Jointly.\n\n\"There's been no mention in any newscast of anyone seeing fairies or\nsea maidens--I expect the poor devil thinks you were a hallucination.\"\n\nSo we brought it off.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI am very thankful in a distant sort of way, but right now the\nIncognitans have no more reality for me than the Lost Kafoozalum.\n\nM'Clare came through alive.\n\nI could spend a good deal of time just getting used to that fact, but\nthere is something I ought to say and I don't know how.\n\nI inquire after his injuries and learn they are healing nicely.\n\nI look at him and he is frowning.\n\nHe says, \"Lizzie. Just before my well-meant but ineffective attempt at\nsuicide--\"\n\nHere it comes.\n\nI say quick If he is worrying about all that nonsense he talked in\norder to distract my attention, forget it; I have.\n\nSilence, then he says wearily, \"I talked nonsense, did I?\"\n\nI say there is no need to worry, under the circumstances anyone would\nhave a perfect right to be raving off his Nut.\n\nI then find I cannot bear this conversation any longer so I get up\nsaying I expect he is tired and I will call someone.\n\nI get nearly to the door when\n\n\"_No_, Lizzie! you can't let that crew loose on me just in order to\nchange the conversation. Come back here. I appreciate your wish to\nspare my feelings, but it's wasted. We'll have this out here and now.\n\n\"I remember quite well what I said, and so do you: I said that I loved\nyou. I also said that I had intended to ask you to marry me as soon as\nyou ceased to be one of my pupils. Well, the results of Finals were\nofficially announced three days ago.\n\n\"Oh, I suppose I always knew what the answer would be, but I didn't\nwant to spend the rest of my life wondering, because I never had the\nguts to ask you.\n\n\"You don't dislike me as you used to--you've forgiven me for making\nyou come to Russett--but you still think I'm a cold-blooded\nmanipulator of other people's minds and emotions. So I am; it's part\nof the job.\n\n\"You're quite right to distrust me for that, though. It is the danger\nof this profession, that we end up by looking on everybody and\neverything as a subject for manipulation. Even in our personal lives.\nI always knew that: I didn't begin to be afraid of it until I realized\nI was in love with you.\n\n\"I could have made you love me, Lizzie. I could! I didn't try. Not\nthat I didn't want love on those terms, or any terms. But to use\nprofessional ... tricks ... in private life, ends by destroying all\nreality. I always treated you exactly as I treated my other\nstudents--I think. But I could have made you think you loved me ...\neven if I am twice your age--\"\n\nThis I cannot let pass, I say \"Hi! According to College rumor you\ncannot be more than thirty-six; I'm twenty-three.\"\n\nM'Clare says in a bemused sort of way He will be thirty-seven in a\ncouple of months.\n\nI say, \"I will be twenty-four next week and your arithmetic is still\nscrewy; and here is another datum you got wrong. I do love you. Very\nmuch.\"\n\nHe says, \"Golden Liz.\"\n\nThen other things which I remember all right, I shall keep them to\nremember any time I am tired, sick, cold, hungry Hundred-and-ninety--;\nbut they are not for writing down.\n\nThen I suppose at some point we agreed it is time for me to go,\nbecause I find myself outside the cabin and there is Colonel\nDelano-Smith.\n\nHe makes me a small speech about various matters ending that he hears\nhe has to congratulate me.\n\nHuh?\n\nOh, Space and Time did one of those unimitigated so-and-sos, my dear\nclassmates, leave M'Clare's communicator on?\n\nThe colonel says he heard I did very well in my Examinations.\n\nSweet splitting photons I forgot all about Finals.\n\nIt is just as well my Education has come to an honorable end, because ...\nwell, shades of ... well, Goodness gracious and likewise Dear me, I am\ngoing to marry a _Professor_.\n\nBetter just stick to it I am going to marry M'Clare, it makes better\nsense that way.\n\nBut Gosh we are going to have to do some re-adjusting to a changed\nEnvironment. Both of us.\n\nOh, well, M'Clare is a Professor of Cultural Engineering and I just\npast my Final Exams in same; surely if anyone can we should be able to\nwork out how you live Happily Ever After?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Lost Kafoozalum, by Pauline Ashwell\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LOST KAFOOZALUM ***\n\n***** This file should be named 30427-8.txt or 30427-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/4/2/30427/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
