It was a nightmare world of grotesque and terrifying\nanimal-plant life. Gigantic beetles, spiders, bugs and ants filled the\nputrid, musty earth--ready to kill and devour anything in sight.\n\nThere were men amidst this horror--men who cringed and ran from the\nravening monsters and huddled in the mushroom forests at night.\n\nBurl was one of these creatures. But one day inspiration hit Burl. He\nwould find a weapon--he would fight back.\n\nAnd with this idea the first step was taken in man's most desperate\nflight for freedom in this most horrible of all worlds. But it was only\na first step.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the characters in this book:\n\n\nThis is something of an oddity among fiction stories, because some of\nits characters may be met in person if you wish. Down at the nearest\nweed-patch or thicket you are quite likely to see a large and unusually\nperfect spider-web with a zig-zag silk ribbon woven into its center. Its\nengineer is the yellow-banded garden spider (_Epeira Fasciata_) whose\nabdomen may be as big as your thumb. I do not name it to impress you,\nbut to suggest a sort of science-fiction experience.\n\nTake a bit of straw and disturb the web. Don't break the cables. Simply\ntap them a bit. The spider will know by the feel of things that you\naren't prey and that it can't eat you. So it will set out frightening\nyou away. It will run nimbly to the center of the web and shake itself\nviolently. The whole web will vibrate, so that presently the spider may\nbe swinging through an arc inches in length, and blurred by the speed of\nits swing. You are supposed to be scared. When you are alarmed enough,\nthe spider will stop.\n\nThat spider, very much magnified, is in this book with crickets and\ngrasshoppers and divers beetles you may not know personally. But this is\nnot an insect book, but science-fiction. If the habits of the creatures\nin it are authentic, it is because they are much more dramatic and\ninteresting than things one can invent.\n\nMurray Leinster\n\n\n\n\n_PROLOGUE_\n\n\nThe Survey-Ship _Tethys_ made the first landing on the planet, which had\nno name. It was an admirable planet in many ways. It had an ample\natmosphere and many seas, which the nearby sun warmed so lavishly that a\nperpetual cloud-bank hid them and most of the solid ground from view. It\nhad mountains and continents and islands and high plateaus. It had day\nand night and wind and rain, and its mean temperature was within the\nrange to which human beings could readily accommodate. It was rather on\nthe tropic side, but not unpleasant.\n\nBut there was no life on it.\n\nNo animals roamed its continents. No vegetation grew from its rocks. Not\neven bacteria struggled with its stones to turn them into soil. So there\nwas no soil. Rock and stones and gravel and even sand--yes. But no soil\nin which any vegetation could grow. No living thing, however small, swam\nin its oceans, so there was not even mud on its ocean-bottoms. It was\none of that disappointing vast majority of worlds which turned up when\nthe Galaxy was first explored. People couldn't live on it because\nnothing had lived there before.\n\nIts water was fresh and its oceans were harmless. Its air was germ-free\nand breathable. But it was of no use whatever for men. The only possible\npurpose it could serve would have been as a biological laboratory for\nexperiments involving things growing in a germ-free environment. But\nthere were too many planets like that already. When men first traveled\nto the stars they made the journey because it was starkly necessary to\nfind new worlds for men to live on. Earth was over-crowded--terribly so.\nSo men looked for new worlds to move to. They found plenty of new\nworlds, but presently they were searching desperately for new worlds\nwhere life had preceded them. It didn't matter whether the life was meek\nand harmless, or ferocious and deadly. If life of any sort were present,\nhuman beings could move in. But highly organized beings like men could\nnot live where there was no other life.\n\nSo the Survey-Ship _Tethys_ made sure that the world had no life upon\nit. Then it made routine measurements of the gravitational constant and\nthe magnetic field and the temperature gradient; it took samples of the\nair and water. But that was all. The rocks were familiar enough. No\nnovelties there! But the planet was simply useless. The survey-ship put\nits findings on a punched card, six inches by eight, and went hastily on\nin search of something better. The ship did not even open one of its\nports while on the planet. There were no consequences of the _Tethys'_\nvisit except that card. None whatever.\n\nNo other ship came near the planet for eight hundred years.\n\nNearly a millenium later, however, the Seed-Ship _Orana_ arrived. By\nthat time humanity had spread very widely and very far. There were\ncolonies not less than a quarter of the way to the Galaxy's rim, and\nEarth was no longer over-crowded. There was still emigration, but it was\nnow a trickle instead of the swarming flood of centuries before. Some of\nthe first-colonized worlds had emigrants, now. Mankind did not want to\ncrowd itself together again! Men now considered that there was no excuse\nfor such monstrous slums as overcrowding produced.\n\nNow, too, the star-ships were faster. A hundred light-years was a short\njourney. A thousand was not impractical. Explorers had gone many times\nfarther, and reported worlds still waiting for mankind on beyond. But\nstill the great majority of discovered planets did not contain life.\nWhole solar systems floated in space with no single living cell on any\nof their members.\n\nSo the Seed-Ships came into being. Theirs was not a glamorous service.\nThey merely methodically contaminated the sterile worlds with life. The\nSeed-Ship _Orana_ landed on this planet--which still had no name. It\ncarefully infected it. It circled endlessly above the clouds, dribbling\nout a fine dust,--the spores of every conceivable micro\u00f6rganism which\ncould break down rock to powder, and turn that dust to soil. It was also\na seeding of moulds and fungi and lichens, and everything which could\nturn powdery primitive soil into stuff on which higher forms of life\ncould grow. The _Orana_ polluted the seas with plankton. Then it, too,\nwent away.\n\nMore centuries passed. Human ships again improved. A thousand\nlight-years became a short journey. Explorers reached the Galaxy's very\nedge, and looked estimatingly across the emptiness toward other island\nuniverses. There were colonies in the Milky Way. There were\nfreight-lines between star-clusters, and the commercial center of human\naffairs shifted some hundreds of parsecs toward the Rim. There were many\nworlds where the schools painstakingly taught the children what Earth\nwas, and where, and that all other worlds had been populated from it.\nAnd the schools repeated, too, the one lesson that humankind seemed\ngenuinely to have learned. That the secret of peace is freedom, and the\nsecret of freedom is to be able to move away from people with whom you\ndo not agree. There were no crowded worlds any more. But human beings\nlove children, and they have them. And children grow up and need room.\nSo more worlds had to be looked out for. They weren't urgently needed\nyet, but they would be.\n\nTherefore, nearly a thousand years after the _Orana_, the Ecology-Ship\n_Ludred_ swam to the planet from space and landed on it. It was a\ngigantic ship of highly improbable purpose. First of all, it checked on\nthe consequences of the _Orana's_ visit.\n\nThey were highly satisfactory, from a technical point of view. Now there\nwas soil which swarmed with minute living things. There were fungi\nwhich throve monstrously. The seas stank of minuscule life-forms. There\nwere even some novelties, developed by the strictly local conditions.\nThere were, for example, paramoecia as big as grapes, and yeasts had\nincreased in size until they bore flowers visible to the naked eye. The\nlife on the planet was not aboriginal, though. All of it was descended\nand adapted and modified from the micro\u00f6rganisms planted by the\nseed-ship whose hulk was long since rust, and whose crew were merely\nnames in genealogies--if that.\n\nThe _Ludred_ stayed on the planet a considerably longer time than either\nof the ships that had visited it before. It dropped the seeds of plants.\nIt broadcast innumerable varieties of things which should take root and\ngrow. In some places it deliberately seeded the stinking soil. It put\nmarine plants in the oceans. It put alpine plants on the high ground.\nAnd when all its stable varieties were set out it added plants which\nwere genetically unstable. For generations to come they would throw\nsports, some of which should be especially suited to this planetary\nenvironment.\n\nBefore it left, the _Ludred_ dumped finny fish into the seas. At first\nthey would live on the plankton which made the oceans almost broth.\nThere were many varieties of fish. Some would multiply swiftly while\nsmall; others would grow and feed on the smaller varieties. And as a\nlast activity, the _Ludred_ set up refrigeration-units loaded with\ninsect-eggs. Some would release their contents as soon as plants had\ngrown enough to furnish them with food. Others would allow their\ncontents to hatch only after certain other varieties had multiplied--to\nbe their food-supply.\n\nWhen the Ecology-Ship left, it had done a very painstaking job. It had\ntreated the planet to a sort of Russell's Mixture of life-forms. The\nreal Russell's Mixture is that blend of the simple elements in the\nproportions found in suns. This was a blend of life-forms in which some\nshould survive by consuming the now-habituated flora, others by preying\non the former. The planet was stocked, in effect, with everything that\nit could be hoped would live there.\n\nBut only certain things could have that hope. Nothing which needed\nparental care had any chance of survival. The creatures seeded at this\ntime had to be those which could care for themselves from the instant\nthey burst their eggs. So there were no birds or mammals. Trees and\nplants of many kinds, fish and crustaceans and tadpoles, and all kinds\nof insects could be planted. But nothing else.\n\nThe _Ludred_ swam away through emptiness.\n\nThere should have been another planting centuries later. There should\nhave been a ship from the Zo\u00f6logical Branch of the Ecological Service.\nIt should have landed birds and beasts and reptiles. It should have\nadded pelagic mammals to the seas. There should have been herbivorous\nanimals to live on the grasses and plants which would have thriven, and\ncarnivorous animals to live on them in turn. There should have been\ncareful stocking of the planet with animal life, and repeated visits at\nintervals of a century or so to make sure that a true ecological balance\nhad been established. And then when the balance was fixed men would come\nand destroy it for their own benefit.\n\nBut there was an accident.\n\nShips had improved again. Even small private space-craft now journeyed\ntens of light-years on holiday journeys. Personal cruisers traveled\nhundreds. Liners ran matter-of-factly on ship-lines tens of thousands of\nlight-years long. An exploring-ship was on its way to a second island\nuniverse. (It did not come back.) The inhabited planets were all members\nof a tenuous organization which limited itself to affairs of space,\nwithout attempting to interfere in surface matters. That tenuous\norganization moved the Ecological Preparation Service files to Algol IV\nas a matter of convenience. In the moving, a card-file was upset. The\ncards it contained were picked up and replaced, but one was missed. It\nwas not picked up. It was left behind.\n\nSo the planet which had no name was forgotten. No other ship came to\nprepare it for ultimate human occupancy. It circled its sun, unheeded\nand unthought-of. Cloud-banks covered it from pole to pole. There were\nhazy markings in some places, where high plateaus penetrated its clouds.\nBut that was all. From space the planet was essentially featureless.\nSeen from afar it was merely a round white ball--white from its\ncloud-banks--and nothing else.\n\nBut on its surface, on its lowlands, it was pure nightmare. But this\nfact did not matter for a very long time.\n\nUltimately, it mattered a great deal--to the crew of the space-liner\n_Icarus_. The _Icarus_ was a splendid ship of its time. It bore\npassengers headed for one of the Galaxy's spiral arms, and it cut across\nthe normal lanes and headed through charted but unvisited parts of the\nGalaxy toward its destination. And it had one of the very, very, very\nfew accidents known to happen to space-craft licensed for travel off the\nnormal space-lanes. It suffered shipwreck in space, and its passengers\nand crew were forced to take to the life-craft.\n\nThe lifeboats' range was limited. They landed on the planet that the\n_Tethys_ had first examined, that the _Orana_ and the _Ludred_ had\nseeded, and of which there was no longer any record in the card-files of\nthe Ecological Service. Their fuel was exhausted. They could not leave.\nThey could not signal for help. They had to stay there. And the planet\nwas a place of nightmares.\n\nAfter a time the few people--some few thousands--who knew that there was\na space-liner named _Icarus_, gave it up for lost. They forgot about it.\nEverybody forgot. Even the passengers and crew of the ship forgot it.\nNot immediately, of course. For the first few generations their\ndescendants cherished hopes of rescue. But the planet which had no\nname--the forgotten planet--did not encourage the cherishing of hope.\n\nAfter forty-odd generations, nobody remembered the _Icarus_ anywhere.\nThe wreckage of the lifeboats was long since hidden under the seething,\nfuriously striving fungi of the soil. The human beings had forgotten not\nonly their ancestors' ship, but very nearly everything their ancestors\nhad brought to this world: the use of metals, the existence of fire, and\neven the fact that there was such a thing as sunshine. They lived in the\nlowlands, deep under the cloud-bank, amid surroundings which were\nriotous, swarming, frenzied horror. They had become savages.\n\nThey were less than savages, because they had forgotten their destiny as\nmen.\n\n\n\n\n_1. MAD PLANET_\n\n\nIn all his lifetime of perhaps twenty years, it had never occurred to\nBurl to wonder what his grandfather had thought about his surroundings.\nThe grandfather had come to an untimely end in a fashion which Burl\nremembered as a succession of screams coming more and more faintly to\nhis ears, while he was being carried away at the topmost speed of which\nhis mother was capable.\n\nBurl had rarely or never thought of his grandfather since. Surely he had\nnever wondered what his great-grandfather had thought, and most surely\nof all he never speculated upon what his many-times-removed\ngreat-grandfather had thought when his lifeboat landed from the\n_Icarus_. Burl had never heard of the _Icarus_. He had done very little\nthinking of any sort. When he did think, it was mostly agonized effort\nto contrive a way to escape some immediate and paralyzing danger. When\nhorror did not press upon him, it was better not to think, because there\nwasn't much but horror to think about.\n\nAt the moment, he was treading cautiously over a brownish carpet of\nfungus, creeping furtively toward the stream which he knew only by the\ngeneric name of \"water.\" It was the only water he knew. Towering far\nabove his head, three man-heights high, great toadstools hid the gray\nsky from his sight. Clinging to the yard-thick stalks of the toadstools\nwere still other fungi, parasites upon the growths that once had been\nparasites themselves.\n\nBurl appeared a fairly representative specimen of the descendants of the\nlong-forgotten _Icarus_ crew. He wore a single garment twisted about his\nmiddle, made from the wing-fabric of a great moth which the members of\nhis tribe had slain as it emerged from its cocoon. His skin was fair\nwithout a trace of sunburn. In all his lifetime he had never seen the\nsun, though he surely had seen the sky often enough. It was rarely\nhidden from him save by giant fungi, like those about him now, and\nsometimes by the gigantic cabbages which were nearly the only green\ngrowths he knew. To him normal landscape contained only fantastic pallid\nmosses, and misshapen fungus growths, and colossal moulds and yeasts.\n\nHe moved onward. Despite his caution, his shoulder once touched a\ncream-colored toadstool stalk, giving the whole fungus a tiny shock.\nInstantly a fine and impalpable powder fell upon him from the umbrella\nlike top above. It was the season when the toadstools sent out their\nspores. He paused to brush them from his head and shoulders. They were,\nof course, deadly poison.\n\nBurl knew such matters with an immediate and specific and detailed\ncertainty. He knew practically nothing else. He was ignorant of the use\nof fire, of metals, and even of the uses of stone and wood. His language\nwas a scanty group of a few hundred labial sounds, conveying no\nabstractions and few concrete ideas. He knew nothing of wood, because\nthere was no wood in the territory furtively inhabited by his tribe.\nThis was the lowlands. Trees did not thrive here. Not even grasses and\ntree-ferns could compete with mushrooms and toadstools and their kin.\nHere was a soil of rusts and yeasts. Here were toadstool forests and\nfungus jungles. They grew with feverish intensity beneath a cloud-hidden\nsky, while above them fluttered butterflies no less enlarged than they,\nmoths as much magnified, and other creatures which could thrive on their\ncorruption.\n\nThe only creatures on the planet which crawled or ran or flew--save only\nBurl's fugitive kind--were insects. They had been here before men came,\nand they had adapted to the planet's extraordinary ways. With a world\nmade ready before their first progenitors arrived, insects had thriven\nincredibly. With unlimited food-supplies, they had grown large. With\nincreased size had come increased opportunity for survival, and\nenlargement became hereditary. Other than fungoid growths, the solitary\nvegetables were the sports of unstable varieties of the plants left\nbehind by the _Ludred_. There were enormous cabbages, with leaves the\nsize of ship-sails, on which stolid grubs and caterpillars ate\nthemselves to maturity, and then swung below in strong cocoons to sleep\nthe sleep of metamorphosis. The tiniest butterflies of Earth had\nincreased their size here until their wings spread feet across, and\nsome--like the emperor moths--stretched out purple wings which were\nyards in span. Burl himself would have been dwarfed beneath a great\nmoth's wing.\n\nBut he wore a gaudy fabric made of one. The moths and giant butterflies\nwere harmless to men. Burl's fellow tribesmen sometimes came upon a\ncocoon when it was just about to open, and if they dared they waited\ntimorously beside it until the creature inside broke through its\nsleeping-shell and came out into the light.\n\nThen, before it gathered energy from the air and before its wings\nswelled to strength and firmness, the tribesmen fell upon it. They tore\nthe delicate wings from its body and the still-flaccid limbs from their\nplaces. And when it lay helpless before them they fled away to feast on\nits juicy meat-filled limbs.\n\nThey dared not linger, of course. They left their prey helpless--staring\nstrangely at the world about it through its many-faceted eyes--before\nthe scavengers came to contest its ownership. If nothing more deadly\nappeared, surely the ants would come. Some of them were only inches\nlong, but others were the size of fox-terriers. All of them had to be\navoided by men. They would carry the moth-carcass away to their\nunderground cities, triumphantly, in shreds and morsels.\n\nBut most of the insect world was neither so helpless nor so\nunthreatening. Burl knew of wasps almost the length of his own body,\nwith stings that were instantly fatal. To every species of wasp,\nhowever, some other insect is predestined prey. Wasps need not be\ndreaded too much. And bees were similarly aloof. They were hard put to\nit for existence, those bees. Since few flowers bloomed, they were\nreduced to expedients that once were considered signs of degeneracy in\ntheir race: bubbling yeasts and fouler things, or occasionally the\nnectarless blooms of the rank giant cabbages. Burl knew the bees. They\ndroned overhead, nearly as large as he was, their bulging eyes gazing at\nhim and everything else in abstracted preoccupation.\n\nThere were crickets, and beetles, and spiders.... Burl knew spiders! His\ngrandfather had been the prey of a hunting tarantula which had leaped\nwith incredible ferocity from its tunnel in the ground. A vertical pit,\na yard in diameter, went down for twenty feet. At the bottom of the lair\nthe monster waited for the tiny sounds that would warn him of prey\napproaching his hiding-place.\n\nBurl's grandfather had been careless. The terrible shrieks he uttered as\nhe was seized still lingered vaguely in Burl's mind. And he had seen,\ntoo, the webs of another species of spider--inch-thick cables of dirty\nsilk--and watched from a safe distance as the misshapen monster sucked\nthe juices from a three-foot cricket its trap had caught. He remembered\nthe stripes of yellow and black and silver that crossed upon its\nabdomen. He had been fascinated and horrified by the blind struggling of\nthe cricket, tangled in hopeless coils of gummy cord, before the spider\nbegan its feast.\n\nBurl knew these dangers. They were part of his life. It was this\nknowledge that made life possible. He knew the ways to evade these\ndangers. But if he yielded to carelessness for one moment, or if he\nrelaxed his caution for one instant, he would be one with his ancestors.\nThey were the long-forgotten meals of inhuman monsters.\n\nNow, to be sure, Burl moved upon an errand that probably no other of his\ntribe would have imagined. The day before, he had crouched behind a\nshapeless mound of inter-tangled growths and watched a duel between two\nhuge horned beetles. Their bodies were feet long. Their carapaces were\nwaist-high to Burl when they crawled. Their mandibles, gaping laterally,\nclicked and clashed upon each other's impenetrable armor. Their legs\ncrashed like so many cymbals as they struck against each other. They\nfought over some particularly attractive bit of carrion.\n\nBurl had watched with wide eyes until a gaping hole appeared in the\narmor of the smaller one. It uttered a grating outcry--or seemed to. The\nnoise was actually the tearing of its shell between the mandibles of the\nvictor.\n\nThe wounded creature struggled more and more feebly. When it ceased to\noffer battle, the conqueror placidly began to dine before its prey had\nceased to live. But this was the custom of creatures on this planet.\n\nBurl watched, timorous but hopeful. When the meal was finished, he\ndarted in quickly as the diner lumbered away. He was almost too late,\neven then. An ant--the forerunner of many--already inspected the\nfragments with excitedly vibrating antennae.\n\nBurl needed to move quickly and he did. Ants were stupid and\nshort-sighted insects; few of them were hunters. Save when offered\nbattle, most of them were scavengers only. They hunted the scenes of\nnightmare for the dead and dying only, but fought viciously if their\nprey were questioned. And always there were others on the way.\n\nSome were arriving now. Hearing the tiny clickings of their approach,\nBurl was hasty. Over-hasty. He seized a loosened fragment and fled. It\nwas merely the horn, the snout of the dead and eaten creature. But it\nwas loose and easily carried. He ran.\n\nLater he inspected his find with disappointment. There was little meat\nclinging to it. It was merely the horn of a Minotaur beetle, shaped like\nthe horn of a rhinoceros. Plucking out the shreds left by its murderer,\nhe pricked his hand. Pettishly, he flung it aside. The time of darkness\nwas near, so he crept to the hiding place of his tribe to huddle with\nthem until light came again.\n\nThere were only twenty of them; four or five men and six or seven women.\nThe rest were girls or children. Burl had been wondering at the strange\nfeelings that came over him when he looked at one of the girls. She was\nyounger than Burl--perhaps eighteen--and fleeter of foot. They talked\ntogether sometimes and, once or twice, Burl shared an especially\nsucculent find of foodstuffs with her.\n\nHe could share nothing with her now. She stared at him in the deepening\nnight when he crept to the labyrinthine hiding place the tribe now used\nin a mushroom forest. He considered that she looked hungry and hoped\nthat he would have food to share. And he was bitterly ashamed that he\ncould offer nothing. He held himself a little apart from the rest,\nbecause of his shame. Since he too was hungry, it was some time before\nhe slept. Then he dreamed.\n\nNext morning he found the horn where he had thrown it disgustedly the\nday before. It was sticking in the flabby trunk of a toadstool. He\npulled it out. In his dream he had used it....\n\nPresently he tried to use it. Sometimes--not often--the men of the tribe\nused the saw-toothed edge of a cricket-leg, or the leg of a\ngrasshopper, to sever tough portions of an edible mushroom. The horn had\nno cutting edge, but Burl had used it in his dream. He was not quite\ncapable of distinguishing clearly between reality and dreams; so he\ntried to duplicate what happened in the dream. Remembering that it had\nstuck into the mushroom-stalk, he thrust it. It stabbed. He remembered\ndistinctly how the larger beetle had used its horn as a weapon. It had\nstabbed, too.\n\nHe considered absorbedly. He could not imagine himself fighting one of\nthe dangerous insects, of course. Men did not fight, on the forgotten\nplanet. They ran away. They hid. But somehow Burl formed a fantastic\npicture of himself stabbing food with this horn, as he had stabbed a\nmushroom. It was longer than his arm and though naturally clumsy in his\nhand, it would have been a deadly weapon in the grip of a man prepared\nto do battle.\n\nBattle did not occur to Burl. But the idea of stabbing food with it was\nclear. There could be food that would not fight back. Presently he had\nan inspiration. His face brightened. He began to make his way toward the\ntiny river that ran across the plain in which the tribe of humans lived\nby foraging in competition with the ants. Yellow-bellied newts--big\nenough to be lusted for--swam in its waters. The swimming larvae of a\nthousand kinds of creatures floated on the sluggish surface or crawled\nover the bottom.\n\nThere were deadly things there, too. Giant crayfish snapped their claws\nat the unwary. One of them could sever Burl's arm with ease. Mosquitoes\nsometimes hummed high above the river. Mosquitoes had a four-inch\nwing-spread, now, though they were dying out for lack of plant-juices on\nwhich the males of their species fed. But they were formidable. Burl had\nlearned to crush them between fragments of fungus.\n\nHe crept slowly through the forest of toadstools. What should have been\ngrass underfoot was brownish rust. Orange and red and purple moulds\nclustered about the bases of the creamy mushroom-trunks. Once, Burl\npaused to run his weapon through a fleshy column and reassure himself\nthat what he planned was possible.\n\nHe made his way furtively through the bulbous growths. Once he heard\nclickings and froze to stillness. Four or five ants, minims only eight\ninches long, were returning by an habitual pathway to their city. They\nmoved sturdily along, heavily laden, over the route marked by the scent\nof formic acid left by their fellow-townsmen. Burl waited until they had\npassed, then went on.\n\nHe came to the bank of the river. It flowed slowly, green scum covering\na great deal of its surface in the backwaters, occasionally broken by a\nslowly enlarging bubble released from decomposing matter on the bottom.\nIn the center of the stream the current ran a little more swiftly and\nthe water itself seemed clear. Over it ran many water-spiders. They had\nnot shared in the general increase of size in the insect world.\nDepending as they did on the surface tension of the water for support,\nto have grown larger and heavier would have destroyed them.\n\nBurl surveyed the scene. His search was four parts for danger and only\none part for a way to test his brilliant notion, but that was natural.\nWhere he stood, the green scum covered the stream for many yards.\nDown-river a little, though, the current came closer to the bank. Here\nhe could not see whatever swam or crawled or wriggled underwater; there\nhe might.\n\nThere was an outcropping rock forming a support for crawling stuff,\nwhich in turn supported shelf-fungi making wide steps almost down to the\nwater's edge. Burl was making his way cautiously toward them when he saw\none of the edible mushrooms which formed so large a part of his diet. He\npaused to break off a flabby white piece large enough to feed him for\nmany days. It was the custom of his people, when they found a store of\nfood, to hide with it and not venture out again to danger until it was\nall eaten. Burl was tempted to do just that with his booty. He could\ngive Saya of this food and they would eat together. They might hide\ntogether until it was all consumed.\n\nBut there was a swirling in the water under the descending platforms of\nshelf-fungi. A very remarkable sensation came to Burl. He may have been\nthe only man in many generations to be aware of the high ambition to\nstab something to eat. He may have been a throw-back to ancestors who\nhad known bravery, which had no survival-value here. But Burl had\nimagined carrying Saya food which he had stabbed with the spear of a\nMinotaur beetle. It was an extraordinary idea.\n\nIt was new, too. Not too long ago, when he was younger, Burl would have\nthought of the tribe instead. He'd have thought of old Jon, bald-headed\nand wheezing and timorous, and how that patriarch would pat his arm\nexuberantly when handed food; or old Tama, wrinkled and querulous, whose\nlook of settled dissatisfaction would vanish at sight of a tidbit; of\nDik and Tet, the tribe-members next younger, who would squabble\nzestfully over the fragments allotted them.\n\nBut now he imagined Saya looking astonished and glad when he grandly\nhanded her more food than she could possibly eat. She would admire him\nenormously!\n\nOf course he did not imagine himself fighting to get food for Saya. He\nmeant only to stab something edible in the water. Things in the water\ndid not fight things on land. Since he would not be in the water, he\nwould not be in a fight. It was a completely delectable idea, which no\nman within memory had ever entertained before. If Burl accomplished it,\nhis tribe would admire him. Saya would admire him. Everybody, observing\nthat he had found a new source of food, would even envy him until he\nshowed them how to do it too. Burl's fellow-humans were preoccupied with\nthe filling of their stomachs. The preservation of their lives came\nsecond. The perpetuation of the race came a bad third in their\nconsideration. They were herded together in a leaderless group, coming\nto the same hiding-place nightly only that they might share the finds of\nthe lucky and gather comfort from their numbers. They had no weapons.\nEven Burl did not consider his spear a weapon. It was a tool for\nstabbing something to eat only. Yet he did not think of it in that way\nexactly. His tribe did not even consciously use tools. Sometimes they\nused stones to crack open the limbs of great insects they found\nincompletely devoured. They did not even carry rocks about with them for\nthat purpose. Only Burl had a vague idea of taking something to some\nplace to do something with it. It was unprecedented. Burl was at least\nan atavar. He may have been a genius.\n\nBut he was not a high-grade genius. Certainly not yet.\n\nHe reached a spot from which he could look down into the water. He\nlooked behind and all about, listening, then lay down to stare into the\nshallow depths. Once, a huge crayfish, a good eight feet long, moved\nleisurely across his vision. Small fishes and even huge newts fled\nbefore it.\n\nAfter a long time the normal course of underwater life resumed. The\nwriggling caddis-flies in their quaintly ambitious houses reappeared.\nLittle flecks of silver swam into view--a school of tiny fish. Then a\nlarger fish appeared, moving slowly in the stream.\n\nBurl's eyes glistened; his mouth watered. He reached down with his long\nweapon. It barely broke through the still surface of the water below.\nDisappointment filled him, yet the nearness and apparent probability of\nsuccess spurred him on.\n\nHe examined the shelf-fungi beneath him. Rising, he moved to a point\nabove them and tested one with his spear. It resisted. Burl felt about\ntentatively with his foot, then dared to put his whole weight on the\ntopmost. It held firmly. He clambered down upon the lower ones, then\nlay flat and peered over the edge.\n\nThe large fish, fully as long as Burl's arm, swam slowly to and fro\nbeneath him. Burl had seen the former owner of this spear strive to\nthrust it into his adversary. The beetle had been killed by the more\nsuccessful stab of a similar weapon. Burl had tried this upon\ntoadstools, practising with it. When the silver fish drifted close by\nagain, he thrust sharply downward.\n\nThe spear seemed to bend when it entered the water. It missed its mark\nby inches, much to Burl's astonishment. He tried again. Once more the\nspear seemed diverted by the water. He grew angry with the fish for\neluding his efforts to kill it.\n\nThis anger was as much the reaction of a throw-back to a less fearful\ntime as the idea of killing itself. But Burl scowled at the fish.\nRepeated strokes had left it untouched. It was unwary. It did not even\nswim away.\n\nThen it came to rest directly beneath his hand. He thrust directly\ndownward, with all his strength. This time the spear, entering\nvertically, did not appear to bend, but went straight down. Its point\npenetrated the scales of the swimming fish, transfixing the creature\ncompletely.\n\nAn uproar began with the fish wriggling desperately as Burl tried to\ndraw it up to his perch. In his excitement he did not notice a tiny\nripple a little distance away. The monster crayfish, attracted by the\ndisturbance, was coming back.\n\nThe unequal combat continued. Burl hung on desperately to the end of his\nspear. Then there was a tremor in the shelf-fungus on which he lay. It\nyielded, collapsed, and fell into the stream with a mighty splash. Burl\nwent under, his eyes wide open, facing death. As he sank he saw the\ngaping, horrible claws of the crustacean, huge enough to sever any of\nBurl's limbs with a single snap.\n\nHe opened his mouth to scream, but no sound came out. Only bubbles\nfloated up to the surface. He beat the unresisting fluid in a frenzy of\nhorror with his hands and feet as the colossal crayfish leisurely\napproached.\n\nHis arms struck a solid object. He clutched it convulsively. A second\nlater he had swung it between himself and the crustacean. He felt the\nshock as the claws closed upon the cork-like fungus. Then he felt\nhimself drawn upward as the crayfish disgustedly released its hold and\nthe shelf-fungus floated slowly upward. Having given way beneath him, it\nhad been pushed below when he fell, only to rise within his reach just\nwhen most needed.\n\nBurl's head popped above-water and he saw a larger bit of the fungus\nfloating nearby. Even less securely anchored to the river-bank than the\nshelf to which he had trusted himself, it had broken away when he fell.\nIt was larger and floated higher.\n\nHe seized it, crazily trying to climb up. It tilted under his weight and\nvery nearly overturned. He paid no heed. With desperate haste he clawed\nand kicked until he could draw himself clear of the water.\n\nAs he pulled himself up on the furry, orange-brown surface, a sharp blow\nstruck his foot. The crayfish, disappointed at finding nothing tasty in\nthe shelf-fungus, had made a languid stroke at Burl's foot wriggling in\nthe water. Failing to grasp the fleshy member, it went annoyedly away.\n\nBurl floated downstream, perched weaponless and alone upon a flimsy raft\nof degenerate fungus; floated slowly down a stagnant river in which\ndeath swam, between banks of sheer peril, past long reaches above which\ndeath floated on golden wings.\n\nIt was a long while before he recovered his self-possession. Then--and\nthis was an action individual in Burl: none of his tribesmen would have\nthought of it--he looked for his spear.\n\nIt was floating in the water, still transfixing the fish whose capture\nhad brought him to this present predicament. That silvery shape, so\nviolent before, now floated belly-up, all life gone.\n\nBurl's mouth watered as he gazed at the fish. He kept it in view\nconstantly while the unsteady craft spun slowly downstream in the\ncurrent. Lying flat he tried to reach out and grasp the end of the spear\nwhen it circled toward him.\n\nThe raft tilted, nearly capsizing. A little later he discovered that it\nsank more readily on one side than the other. This was due, of course,\nto the greater thickness of one side. The part next to the river-bank\nhad been thicker and was, therefore, more buoyant.\n\nHe lay with his head above that side of the raft. It did not sink into\nthe water. Wriggling as far to the edge as he dared, he reached out and\nout. He waited impatiently for the slower rotation of his float to\ncoincide with the faster motion of the speared fish. The spear-end came\ncloser, and closer.... He reached out--and the raft dipped dangerously.\nBut his fingers touched the spear-end. He got a precarious hold, pulled\nit toward him.\n\nSeconds later he was tearing strips of scaly flesh from the side of the\nfish and cramming the greasy stuff into his mouth with vast enjoyment.\nHe had lost the edible mushroom. It floated several yards away. He ate\ncontentedly none-the-less.\n\nHe thought of the tribesfolk as he ate. This was more than he could\nfinish alone. Old Tama would coax him avidly for more than her share.\nShe had a few teeth left. She would remind him anxiously of her gifts of\nfood to him when he was younger. Dik and Tet--being boys--would\nclamorously demand of him where he'd gotten it. How? He would give some\nto Cori, who had younger children, and she would give them most of the\ngift. And Saya--.\n\nBurl gloated especially over Saya's certain reaction.\n\nThen he realized that with every second he was being carried further\naway from her. The nearer river-bank moved past him. He could tell by\nthe motion of the vividly colored growths upon the shore.\n\nOverhead, the sun was merely a brighter patch in the haze-filled sky. In\nthe pinkish light all about, Burl looked for the familiar and did not\nfind it, and dolefully knew that he was remote from Saya and going\nfarther all the time.\n\nThere were a multitude of flying objects to be seen in the miasmatic\nair. In the daytime a thin mist always hung above the lowlands. Burl had\nnever seen any object as much as three miles distant. The air was never\nclear enough to permit it. But there was much to be seen even within the\nlimiting mist.\n\nNow and then a cricket or a grasshopper made its bullet-like flight from\none spot to another. Huge butterflies fluttered gaily above the silent,\nloathesome ground. Bees lumbered anxiously about, seeking the\ncross-shaped flowers of the giant cabbages which grew so rarely.\nOccasionally a slender-waisted, yellow-bellied wasp flashed swiftly by.\n\nBut Burl did not heed any of them. Sitting dismally upon his fungus\nraft, floating in midstream, an incongruous figure of pink skin and\nluridly-tinted loin-cloth, with a greasy dead fish beside him, he was\nfilled with a panicky anguish because the river carried him away from\nthe one girl of his tiny tribe whose glances roused a commotion in his\nbreast.\n\nThe day wore on. Once, he saw a band of large amazon ants moving briskly\nover a carpet of blue-green mould to raid the city of a species of black\nants. The eggs they would carry away from the city would hatch and the\nsmall black creatures would become the slaves of the brigands who had\nstolen them.\n\nLater, strangely-shaped, swollen branches drifted slowly into view. They\nwere outlined sharply against the steaming mist behind them. He knew\nwhat they were: a hard-rinded fungus growing upon itself in peculiar\nmockery of the trees which Burl had never seen because no trees could\nsurvive the conditions of the lowland.\n\nMuch later, as the day drew to an end, Burl ate again of the oily fish.\nThe taste was pleasant compared to the insipid mushrooms he usually ate.\nEven though he stuffed himself, the fish was so large that the greater\npart remained still uneaten.\n\nThe spear was beside him. Although it had brought him trouble, he still\nassociated it with the food it had secured rather than the difficulty\ninto which it had led him. When he had eaten his fill, he picked it up\nto examine again. The oil-covered point remained as sharp as before.\n\nNot daring to use it again from so unsteady a raft, he set it aside as\nhe stripped a sinew from his loin-cloth to hang the fish around his\nneck. This would leave his arms free. Then he sat cross-legged, fumbling\nwith the spear as he watched the shores go past.\n\n\n\n\n_2. A MAN ESCAPES_\n\n\nIt was near to sunset. Burl had never seen the sun, so it did not occur\nto him to think of the coming of night as the setting of anything. To\nhim it was the letting down of darkness from the sky.\n\nThe process was invariable. Overhead there was always a thick and\nunbroken bank of vapor which seemed featureless until sunset. Then,\ntoward the west, the brightness overhead turned orange and then pink,\nwhile to the east it simply faded to a deeper gray. As nightfall\nprogressed, the red colorings grew deeper, moving toward mid-sky.\nUltimately, scattered blotches of darkness began to spot that reddening\nsky as it grew darker in tone, going down toward that impossible\nredness which is indistinguishable from black. It was slowly achieving\nthat redness.\n\nToday Burl watched as never before. On the oily surface of the river the\ncolors and shadings of dusk were reflected with incredible faithfulness.\nThe round tops of toadstools along the shore glowed pink. Dragonflies\nglinted in swift and angular flight, the metallic sheen of their bodies\nflashing in the redness. Great, yellow butterflies sailed lightly above\nthe stream. In every direction upon the water appeared the scrap-formed\nboats of a thousand caddis-flies, floating at the surface while they\nmight. Burl could have thrust his hand down into their cavities to seize\nthe white worms nesting there.\n\nThe bulk of a tardy bee droned heavily overhead. He saw the long\nproboscis and the hairy hind-legs with their scanty load of pollen. The\ngreat, multi-faceted eyes held an expression of stupid preoccupation.\n\nThe crimson radiance grew dim and the color overhead faded toward black.\nNow the stalks of ten thousand domed mushrooms lined the river-bank.\nBeneath them spread fungi of all colors, from the rawest red to palest\nblue, now all fading slowly to a monochromatic background as the\ndarkness deepened.\n\nThe buzzing and fluttering and flapping of the insects of the day died\ndown. From a million hiding places there crept out--into the night--the\nsoft and furry bodies of great moths who preened themselves and smoothed\ntheir feathery antennae before taking to the air. The strong-limbed\ncrickets set up their thunderous noise, grown gravely bass with the\nincreasing size of the noise-making organs. Then there began to gather\non the water those slender spirals of deeper mist which would presently\nblanket the stream in fog.\n\nNight arrived. The clouds above grew wholly black. Gradually the languid\nfall of large, warm raindrops--they would fall all through the\nnight--began. The edge of the stream became a place where disks of cold\nblue flame appeared.\n\nThe mushrooms on the river bank were faintly phosphorescent, shedding a\nghostly light over the ground below them. Here and there, lambent chilly\nflames appeared in mid-air, drifting idly above the festering earth. On\nother planets men call them \"Will-o'-the-wisps,\" but on this planet\nmankind had no name for them at all.\n\nThen huge, pulsating glows appeared in the blackness: fireflies that\nBurl knew to be as long as his spear. They glided slowly through the\ndarkness over the stream, shedding intermittent light over Burl crouched\non his drifting raft. On the shore, too, tiny paired lights glowed\neagerly upward as the wingless females of the species crawled to where\ntheir signals could be seen. And there were other glowing things.\nFox-fire burned in the night, consuming nothing. Even the water of the\nriver glowed with marine organisms--adapted to fresh water\nhere--contributing their mites of brilliance.\n\nThe air was full of flying creatures. The beat of invisible wings came\nthrough the night. Above, about, on every side the swarming, feverish\nlife of the insect world went on ceaselessly, while Burl rocked back and\nforth upon his unstable raft, wanting to weep because he was being\ncarried farther away from Saya whom he could picture looking for him,\nnow, among the hidden, furtive members of the tribe. About him sounded\nthe discordant, machine-like mating cries of creatures trying to serve\nlife in the midst of death and the horrible noises of those who met\ndeath and were devoured in the dark.\n\nBurl was accustomed to such tumult. But he was not accustomed to such\ndespair as he felt at being lost from Saya of the swift feet and white\nteeth and shy smile. He lay disconsolate on his bobbing craft for the\ngreater part of the night. It was long past midnight when the raft\nstruck gently, swung, and then remained grounded upon a shallow in the\nstream.\n\nWhen light came back in the morning, Burl gazed about him fearfully. He\nwas some twenty yards from the shore and thick greenish scum surrounded\nhis disintegrating vessel. The river had widened greatly until the\nopposite bank was hidden in the morning mist, but the nearer shore\nseemed firm and no more full of dangers than the territory inhabited by\nBurl's tribe.\n\nHe tested the depth of the water with his spear, struck by the multiple\nusefulness of the weapon. The water was no more than ankle-deep.\n\nShivering a little, Burl stepped down into the green scum and made for\nthe shore at top speed. He felt something soft clinging to his bare\nfoot. With a frantic rush he ran even faster and stumbled upon the shore\nwith horror not at his heels but on one. He stared down at his foot. A\nshapeless, flesh-colored pad clung to the skin. As he watched, it\nswelled visibly, the pink folds becoming a deeper shade.\n\nIt was no more than a leech, the size of his palm, sharing in the\nenlargement nearly all the insect and fungoid world had undergone, but\nBurl did not know that. He thrust at it with the edge of his spear,\nscraping it frantically away. As it fell off Burl stared in horror,\nfirst at the blotch of blood on his foot, then at the thing writhing and\npulsating on the ground. He fled.\n\nA short while later he stumbled into one of the familiar toadstool\nforests and paused, uncertainly. The towering toadstools were not\nstrange to Burl. He fell to eating. The sight of food always produced\nhunger in him--a provision of nature to make up for the lack of any\ninstinct to store food away. In human beings the storage of food has to\nbe dictated by intellect. The lower orders of creatures are not required\nto think.\n\nEven eating, though, Burl's heart was small within him. He was far from\nhis tribe and Saya. By the measurements of his remotest ancestors, no\nmore than forty miles separated them. But Burl did not think in such\nterms. He'd never had occasion to do so. He'd come down the river to a\nfar land filled with unknown dangers. And he was alone.\n\nAll about him was food, an excellent reason for gladness. But being\nsolitary was reason enough for distress. Although Burl was a creature to\nwhom reflection was normally of no especial value and, therefore, not\npracticed in thought, this was a situation providing an emotional\nparadox. A good fourth of the mushrooms in this particular forest were\nedible. Burl should have gloated over this vast stock of food. But he\nwas isolated, alone; in particular, he was far away from Saya,\ntherefore, he should have wept. But he could not gloat because he was\naway from Saya and he could not mourn because he was surrounded by food.\n\nHe was subject to a stimulus to which apparently only humankind can\nrespond: an emotional dilemma. Other creatures can respond to objective\nsituations where there is the need to choose a course of action: flight\nor fighting, hiding or pursuit. But only man can be disturbed by not\nknowing which of two emotions to feel. Burl had reason to feel two\nentirely different emotional states at the same time. He had to resolve\nthe paradox. The problem was inside him, not out. So he thought.\n\nHe would bring Saya here! He would bring her and the tribe to this place\nwhere there was food in vast quantity!\n\nInstantly pictures flooded into his mind. He could actually see old Jon,\nhis bald head naked as a mushroom itself, stuffing his belly with the\nfood which was so plentiful here. He imagined Cori feeding her children.\nTama's complaints stilled by mouthfuls of food. Tet and Dik, stuffed to\nrepletion, throwing scraps of foodstuff at each other. He pictured the\ntribe zestfully feasting.--And Saya would be very glad.\n\nIt was remarkable that Burl was able to think of his feelings instead of\nhis sensations. His tribesmen were closer to it than equally primitive\nfolk had been back on Earth, but they did not often engage in thought.\nTheir waking lives were filled with nerve-racked physical responses to\nphysical phenomena. They were hungry and they saw or smelled food: they\nwere alive and they perceived the presence of death. In the one case\nthey moved toward the sensory stimulus of food; in the other they fled\nfrom the detected stimulus of danger. They responded immediately to the\nworld about them. Burl, for the first significant time in his life, had\nresponded to inner feelings. He had resolved conflicting emotions by\ndevising a purpose that would end their conflict. He determined to do\nsomething because he wanted to and not because he had to.\n\nIt was the most important event upon the planet in generations.\n\nWith the directness of a child, or a savage, Burl moved to carry out his\npurpose. The fish still slung about his neck scraped against his chest.\nFingering it tentatively, he got himself thoroughly greasy in the\nprocess, but could not eat. Although he was not hungry now, perhaps Saya\nwas. He would give it to her. He imagined her eager delight, the image\nreinforcing his resolve. He had come to this far place down the river\nflowing sluggishly past this riotously-colored bank. To return to the\ntribe he would go back up that bank, staying close to the stream.\n\nHe was remarkably exultant as he forced a way through the awkward aisles\nof the mushroom-forest, but his eyes and ears were still open for any\npossible danger. Several times he heard the omnipresent clicking of ants\nscavenging in the mushroom-glades, but they could be ignored. At best\nthey were short-sighted. If he dropped his fish, they would become\nabsorbed in it. There was only one kind of ant he needed to fear--the\narmy ant, which sometimes traveled in hordes of millions, eating\neverything in their path.\n\nBut there was nothing of the sort here. The mushroom forest came to an\nend. A cheerful grasshopper munched delicately at some dainty it had\nfound--the barrel-sized young shoot of a cabbage-plant. Its hind legs\nwere bunched beneath it in perpetual readiness for flight. A monster\nwasp appeared a hundred feet overhead, checked in its flight, and\nplunged upon the luckless banqueter.\n\nThere was a struggle, but it was brief. The grasshopper strained\nterribly in the grip of the wasp's six barbed legs. The wasp's flexible\nabdomen curved delicately. Its sting entered the jointed armor of its\nprey just beneath the head with all the deliberate precision of a\nsurgeon's scalpel. A ganglion lay there; the wasp-poison entered it. The\ngrasshopper went limp. It was not dead, of course, simply paralyzed.\nPermanently paralyzed. The wasp preened itself, then matter-of-factly\ngrasped its victim and flew away. The grasshopper would be incubator and\nfood-supply for an egg to be laid. Presently, in a huge mud castle, a\nsmall white worm would feed upon the living, motionless victim of its\nmother--who would never see it, or care, or remember....\n\nBurl went on.\n\nThe ground grew rougher; progress became painful. He clambered arduously\nup steep slopes--all of forty or fifty feet high--and made his way\ncautiously down to the farther sides. Once he climbed through a tangled\nmass of mushrooms so closely placed and so small that he had to break\nthem apart with blows of his spear in order to pass. As they crumbled,\ntorrents of a fiery-red liquid showered down upon him, rolling off his\ngreasy breast and sinking into the ground.\n\nA strange self-confidence now took possession of Burl. He walked less\ncautiously and more boldly. He had thought and he had struck something,\nfeeling the vainglorious self-satisfaction of a child. He pictured\nhimself leading his tribe to this place of very much food--he had no\nreal idea of the distance--and he strutted all alone amid the\nnightmare-growths of the planet that had been forgotten.\n\nPresently he could see the river. He had climbed to the top of a\nred-clay mound perhaps a hundred feet high. One side was crumbled where\nthe river overflowed. At some past flood-time the water had lapped at\nthe base of the cliff along which Burl was strutting. But now there was\na quarter-mile of space between himself and the water. And there was\nsomething else in mid-air.\n\nThe cliffside was thickly coated with fungi in a riotous confusion of\nwhite and yellow and orange and green. From a point halfway up the cliff\nthe inch-thick cable of a spider-web stretched down to anchorage on the\nground below. There were other cables beyond this one and circling about\ntheir radial pattern the snare-cords of the web formed a perfect\nlogarithmic spiral.\n\nSomewhere among the fungi of the cliffside the huge spider who had built\nthis web awaited the entrapment of prey. When some unfortunate creature\nstruggled frenziedly in its snare it would emerge. Until then it waited\nin a motionless, implacable patience; utterly certain of victims,\nutterly merciless to them.\n\nBurl strutted on the edge of the cliff, a rather foolish pink-skinned\ncreature with an oily fish slung about his neck and the draggled\nfragment of moth's wing draping his middle. He waved the long shard of\nbeetle armor exultantly above his head.\n\nThe activity was not very sensible. It served no purpose. But if Burl\nwas a genius among his fellows, then he still had a great deal to learn\nbefore his genius would be effective. Now he looked down scornfully upon\nthe shining white trap below. He had struck a fish, killing it. When he\nhit mushrooms they fell into pieces before him. Nothing could frighten\nhim! He would go to Saya and bring her to this land where food grew in\nabundance.\n\nSixty paces away from Burl, near the edge of the cliff, a shaft sank\nvertically into the soil of the clay-mound. It was carefully rounded and\nlined with silk. Thirty feet down, it enlarged itself into a chamber\nwhere the engineer and proprietor of the shaft might rest. The top of\nthe hole was closed by a trap-door, stained with mud and earth to\nimitate the surrounding soil. A sharp eye would have been needed to\ndetect the opening. But a keener eye now peered out from the crack at\nits edge.\n\nThat eye belonged to the proprietor.\n\nEight hairy legs surrounded the body of the monster hanging motionless\nat the top of the silk-lined shaft. Its belly was a huge misshapen globe\ncolored a dirty brown. Two pairs of mandibles stretched before its\nmouth-parts; two eyes glittered in the semi-darkness of the burrow. Over\nthe whole body spread a rough and mangy fur.\n\nIt was a thing of implacable malignance, of incredible ferocity. It was\nthe brown hunting spider, the American tarantula, enlarged here upon the\nforgotten planet so that its body was two feet and more in diameter. Its\nlegs, outstretched, would cover a circle three yards across. The\nglittering eyes followed as Burl strutted forward on the edge of the\ncliff, puffed up with a sense of his own importance.\n\nSpread out below, the white snare of the spinning-spider impressed Burl\nas amusing. He knew the spider wouldn't leave its web to attack him.\nReaching down, he broke off a bit of fungus growing at his feet. Where\nhe broke it away oozed a soupy liquid full of tiny maggots in a delirium\nof feasting. Burl flung it down into the web, laughing as the black bulk\nof the watchful spider swung down from its hiding place to investigate.\n\nThe tarantula, peering from its burrow, quivered with impatience. Burl\ndrew nearer, gleefully using his spear as a lever to pry off bits of\ntrash to fall down the cliffside into the giant web. The spider below\nmoved leisurely from one spot to another, investigating each new missile\nwith its palpi and then ignoring it as lifeless and undesirable prey.\n\nBurl leaped and laughed aloud as a particularly large lump of putrid\nfungus narrowly missed the black-and-silver shape below. Then--\n\nThe trap-door fell into place with a faint sound. Burl whirled about,\nhis laughter transformed instantly into a scream. Moving toward him\nfuriously, its eight legs scrambling, was the monster tarantula. Its\nmandibles gaped wide; the poison fangs were unsheathed. It was thirty\npaces away--twenty paces--ten.\n\nEyes glittering, it leaped, all eight legs extended to seize the prey.\n\nBurl screamed again and thrust out his arms to ward off the creature. It\nwas pure blind horror. There was no genius in that gesture. Because of\nsheer terror his grip upon the spear had become agonized. The\nspear-point shot out and the tarantula fell upon it. Nearly a quarter of\nthe spear entered the body of the ferocious thing.\n\nStuck upon the spear the spider writhed horribly, still striving to\nreach the paralytically frozen Burl. The great mandibles clashed.\nFurious bubbling noises came from it. The hairy legs clutched at his\narm. He cried out hoarsely in ultimate fear and staggered backward--and\nthe edge of the cliff gave way beneath him.\n\nHe hurtled downward, still clutching the spear, incapable of letting go.\nEven while falling the writhing thing still struggled maniacally to\nreach him. Down through emptiness they fell together, Burl glassy-eyed\nwith panic. Then there was a strangely elastic crash and crackling. They\nhad fallen into the web at which Burl had been laughing so scornfully\nonly a little while before.\n\nBurl couldn't think. He only struggled insanely in the gummy coils of\nthe web. But the snare-cords were spiral threads, enormously elastic,\nexuding impossibly sticky stuff, like bird-lime, from between twisted\nconstituent fibres. Near him--not two yards away--the creature he had\nwounded thrashed and fought to reach him, even while shuddering in\nanguish.\n\nBurl had reached the absolute limit of panic. His arms and breast were\ngreasy from the oily fish; the sticky web did not adhere to them. But\nhis legs and body were inextricably tangled by his own frantic\nstruggling in the gummy and adhesive elastic threads. They had been\nspread for prey. He was prey.\n\nHe paused in his blind struggle, gasping from pure exhaustion. Then he\nsaw, not five yards away, the silvery-and-black monster he had mocked so\nrecently now patiently waiting for him to cease his struggles. The\ntarantula and the man were one to its eyes--one struggling thing that\nhad fallen opportunely into its trap. They were moving but feebly, now.\nThe web-spider advanced delicately, swinging its huge bulk nimbly,\npaying out a silken cable behind it as it approached.\n\nBurl's arms were free; he waved them wildly, shrieking at the monster.\nThe spider paused. Burl's moving arms suggested mandibles that might\nwound.\n\nSpiders take few chances. This one drew near cautiously, then stopped.\nIts spinnerets became busy and with one of its eight legs, used like an\narm, it flung a sheet of gummy silk impartially over the tarantula and\nthe man.\n\nBurl fought against the descending shroud. He strove to thrust it away,\nfutilely. Within minutes he was completely covered in a coarse silken\nfabric that hid even the light from his eyes. He and his enemy, the\nmonstrous tarantula, were beneath the same covering. The tarantula moved\nfeebly.\n\nThe shower ceased. The web-spider had decided they were helpless. Then\nBurl felt the cables of the web give slightly as the spider approached\nto sting and suck the juices from its prey.\n\nThe web yielded gently. Burl froze in an ecstasy of horror. But the\ntarantula still writhed in agony upon the spear piercing it. It clashed\nits jaws, shuddering upon the horny shaft.\n\nBurl waited for the poison-fangs to be thrust into him. He knew the\nprocess. He had seen the leisurely fashion in which the web-spider\ndelicately stung its victim, then withdrew to wait with horrible\npatience for the poison to take effect. When the victim no longer\nstruggled, it drew near again to suck out the juices first from one\njoint or limb and then from another, leaving a creature once vibrant\nwith life a shrunken, withered husk, to be flung from the web at\nnightfall.\n\nThe bloated monstrosity now moved meditatively about the double object\nswathed in silk. Only the tarantula stirred. Its bulbous abdomen stirred\nthe concealing shroud. It throbbed faintly as it still struggled with\nthe spear in its vitals. The irregularly rounded projection was an\nobvious target for the web-spider. It moved quickly forward. With fine,\nmerciless precision, it stung.\n\nThe tarantula seemed to go mad with pain. Its legs struck out\npurposelessly, in horrible gestures of delirious suffering. Burl\nscreamed as a leg touched him. He struggled no less wildly.\n\nHis arms and head were enclosed by the folds of silk, but not glued to\nit because of the grease. Clutching at the cords he tried desperately to\ndraw himself away from his deadly neighbor. The threads wouldn't break,\nbut they did separate. A tiny opening appeared.\n\nOne of the tarantula's horribly writhing legs touched him again. With a\nstrength born of utter panic he hauled himself away and the opening\nenlarged. Another lunge and Burl's head emerged into the open air. He\nwas suspended twenty feet above the ground, which was almost carpeted\nwith the chitinous remains of past victims of this same web.\n\nBurl's head and breast and arms were free. The fish slung over his\nshoulder had shed its oil upon him impartially. But the lower part of\nhis body was held firm by the viscous gumminess of the web-spider's\ncord. It was vastly more adhesive than any bird-lime ever made by men.\n\nHe hung in the little window for a moment, despairing. Then he saw the\nbulk of his captor a little distance away, waiting patiently for its\npoison to work and its prey to cease struggling. The tarantula was no\nmore than shuddering now. Soon it would be quite still and the\nblack-bellied creature would approach for its meal.\n\nBurl withdrew his head and thrust desperately at the sticky stuff about\nhis loins and legs. The oil upon his hands kept them free. The silk\nshroud gave a little. Burl grasped at the thought as at a straw. He\ngrasped the fish and tore it, pushing frantically at his own body with\nthe now-rancid, scaly, odorous mass. He scraped gum from his legs with\nthe fish, smearing the rancid oils all over them in the process.\n\nHe felt the web tremble again. To the spider Burl's movements meant that\nits poison had not taken full effect. Another sting seemed to be\nnecessary. This time it would not insert its sting into the quiescent\ntarantula, but where there was still life. It would send its venom into\nBurl.\n\nHe gasped and drew himself toward his window as if he would have pulled\nhis legs from his body. His head emerged. His shoulders--half his body\nwas out of the hole.\n\nThe great spider surveyed him and made ready to cast more of its silken\nstuff upon him. The spinnerets became active. A leg gathered it up--\n\nThe sticky stuff about Burl's feet gave way.\n\nHe shot out of the opening and fell heavily, sprawling upon the earth\nbelow and crashing into the shrunken shell of a flying beetle that had\nblundered into the snare and not escaped as he had done.\n\nBurl rolled over and over and then sat up. An angry, foot-long ant stood\nbefore him, its mandibles extended threateningly, while a shrill\nstridulation filled the air.\n\nIn ages past, back on Earth--where most ants were to be measured in\nfractions of an inch--the scientists had debated gravely whether their\ntribe possessed a cry. They believed that certain grooves upon the body\nof the insect, like those upon the great legs of the cricket, might be\nthe means of making a sound too shrill for human ears to catch. It was\ngreatly debated, but evidence was hard to obtain.\n\nBurl did not need evidence. He knew that the stridulation was caused by\nthe insect before him, though he had never wondered how it was produced.\nThe cry was emitted to summon other ants from its city to help it in\ndifficulty or good fortune.\n\nHarsh clickings sounded fifty or sixty feet away; comrades were coming.\nAnd while only army ants were normally dangerous, any tribe of ants\ncould be formidable when aroused. It was overwhelming enough to pull\ndown and tear a man to shreds as a pack of infuriated fox-terriers might\ndo on Earth.\n\nBurl fled without further delay, nearly colliding with one of the web's\nanchor-cables. Then he heard the shrill outcry subside. The ant,\nshort-sighted as all its kind, no longer felt threatened. It went\npeacefully about the business Burl had interrupted. Presently it found\nsome edible carrion among the debris from the spider-web and started\ntriumphantly back to its city.\n\nBurl sped on for a few hundred yards and then stopped. He was shaken and\ndazed. For the moment, he was as timid and fearful as any other man in\nhis tribe. Presently he would realize the full meaning of the\nunparalleled feat he had performed in escaping from the giant spider web\nwhile cloaked with folds of gummy silk. It was not only unheard-of; it\nwas unimaginable! But Burl was too shaken to think of it now.\n\nRather quaintly, the first sensation that forced itself into his\nconsciousness was that his feet hurt. The gluey stuff from the web still\nstuck to his soles, picking up small objects as he went along. Old,\nant-gnawed fragments of insect armor pricked him so persistently, even\nthrough his toughened foot-soles, that he paused to scrape them away,\nstaring fearfully about all the while. After a dozen steps more he was\nforced to stop again.\n\nIt was this nagging discomfort, rather than vanity or an emergency which\ncaused Burl to discover--imagine--blunder into a new activity as\nepoch-making as anything else he had done. His brain had been uncommonly\nstimulated in the past twenty-some hours. It had plunged him into at\nleast one predicament because of his conceiving the idea of stabbing\nsomething, but it had also allowed him escape from another even more\nterrifying one just now. In between it had led to the devising of a\npurpose--the bringing of Saya here--though that decision was not so\nfirmly fixed as it had been before the encounter with the web-spider.\nStill, it had surely been reasoning of a sort that told him to grease\nhis body with the fish. Otherwise he would now be following the\ntarantula as a second course for the occupant of the web.\n\nBurl looked cautiously all about him. It seemed to be quite safe. Then,\nquite deliberately, he sat down to think. It was the first time in his\nlife that he had ever deliberately contemplated a problem with the idea\nof finding an answer to it. And the notion of doing such a thing was\nepoch-making--on this planet!\n\nHe examined his foot. The sharp edges of pebbles and the remnants of\ninsect-armor hurt his feet when he walked. They had done so ever since\nhe had been born, but never before had his feet been sticky, so that the\nirritation from one object persisted for more than a step. He carefully\npicked away each sharp-pointed fragment, one by one. Partly coated with\nthe half-liquid gum, they even tended to cling to his fingers, except\nwhere the oil was thick.\n\nBurl's reasoning had been of the simplest sort. He had contemplated a\nsituation--not deliberately but because he had to--and presently his\nmind showed him a way out of it. It was a way specifically suited to the\nsituation. Here he faced something different. Presently he applied the\nanswer of one problem to a second problem. Oil on his body had let him\ngo free of things that would stick to him. Here things stuck to his\nfeet; so he oiled them.\n\nAnd it worked. Burl strode away, almost--but not completely--untroubled\nby the bothersome pebbles and bits of discarded armor. Then he halted to\nregard himself with astonished appreciation. He was still thirty-five\nmiles from his tribe; he was naked and unarmed, utterly ignorant of wood\nand fire and weapons other than the one he had lost. But he paused to\nobserve with some awe that he was very wonderful indeed.\n\nHe wanted to display himself. But his spear was gone. So Burl found it\nnecessary to think again. And the remarkable thing about it was that he\nsucceeded.\n\nIn a surprisingly brief time he had come up with a list of answers. He\nwas naked, so he would find garments for himself. He was weaponless: he\nwould find himself a spear. He was hungry and he would seek food. Since\nhe was far from his tribe, he would go to them. And this was, in a\nfashion, quite obviously thought; but it was not oblivious on the\nforgotten planet because it had been futile--up to now. The importance\nof such thought in the scheme of things was that men had not been\nthinking even so simply as this, living only from minute to minute. Burl\nwas fumbling his way into a habit of thinking from problem to problem.\nAnd that was very important indeed.\n\nEven in the advanced civilization of other planets, few men really used\ntheir minds. The great majority of people depended on machines not only\nfor computations but decisions as well. Any decisions not made by\nmachines most men left to their leaders. Burl's tribesfolk thought\nprincipally with their stomachs, making few if any decisions on any\nother basis--though they did act, very often, under the spur of fear.\nFear-inspired actions, however, were not thought out. Burl was thinking\nout his actions.\n\nThere would be consequences.\n\nHe faced upstream and began to move again, slowly and warily, his eyes\nkeenly searching out the way ahead, ears alert for the slightest sound\nof danger. Gigantic butterflies, riotous in coloring, fluttered overhead\nthrough the hazy air. Sometimes a grasshopper hurtled from one place to\nanother like a projectile, its transparent wings beating frantically.\nNow and then a wasp sped by, intent upon its hunting, or a bee droned\nheavily alone, anxious and worried, striving to gather pollen in a\nnearly flowerless world.\n\nBurl marched on. From somewhere far behind him came a very faint sound.\nIt was a shrill noise, but very distant indeed. Absorbed in immediate\nand nearby matters, Burl took no heed. He had the limited local\nviewpoint of a child. What was near was important and what was distant\ncould be ignored. Anything not imminent still seemed to him\ninsignificant--and he was preoccupied.\n\nThe source of this sound was important, however. Its origin was a myriad\nof clickings compounded into a single noise. It was, in fact, the\nfar-away but yet perceptible sound of army ants on the march. The\nlocusts of Earth were very trivial nuisances compared to the army ants\nof this planet.\n\nLocusts, in past ages on Earth, had eaten all green things. Here in the\nlowlands were only giant cabbages and a few rank, tenacious growths.\nGrasshoppers were numerous here, but could never be thought of as a\nplague; they were incapable of multiplying to the size of locust hordes.\nArmy ants, however....\n\nBut Burl did not notice the sound. He moved forward briskly though\ncautiously, searching the fungus-landscape for any sign of garments,\nfood, and weapons. He confidently expected to find all of them within a\nshort distance. Indeed, he did find food very soon. No more than a half\nmile ahead he found a small cluster of edible fungi.\n\nWith no special elation, Burl broke off a food supply from the largest\nof them. Naturally, he took more than he could possibly eat at one time.\nHe went on, nibbling at a big piece of mushroom abstractedly, past a\nbroad plain, more than a mile across and broken into odd little hillocks\nby gradually ripening mushrooms which were unfamiliar to him. In several\nplaces the ground had been pushed aside by rounded objects, only the\ntips showing. Blood-red hemispheres seemed to be forcing themselves\nthrough the soil, so they might reach the outer air. Careful not to\ntouch any of them, Burl examined the hillocks curiously as he entered\nthe plain. They were strange, and to Burl most strange things meant\ndanger. In any event, he had two conscious purposes now. He wanted\ngarments and weapons.\n\nAbove the plain a wasp hovered, dangling a heavy object beneath its\nblack belly across which ran a single red band. It was the gigantic\ndescendant of the hairy sand-wasp, differing only in size from its\nfar-away, remote ancestors on Earth. It was taking a paralyzed gray\ncaterpillar to its burrow. Burl watched it drop down with the speed and\nsureness of an arrow, pull aside a heavy, flat stone, and descend into\nthe burrow with its caterpillar-prey momentarily laid aside.\n\nIt vanished underground into a vertical shaft dug down forty feet or\nmore. It evidently inspected the refuge. Reappearing, it vanished into\nthe hole again, dragging the gray worm after it. Burl, marching on over\nthe broad plain spotted with some eruptive disease, did not know what\npassed below. But he did observe the wasp emerge again to scratch dirt\nand stones previously excavated laboriously back into the shaft until it\nwas full.\n\nThe wasp had paralyzed a caterpillar, taken it into the ready-prepared\nburrow, laid an egg upon it, and sealed up the entrance. In time the egg\nwould hatch into a grub barely the size of Burl's forefinger. And the\ngrub, deep underground, would feed upon the living but helpless\ncaterpillar until it waxed large and fat. Then it would weave itself a\ncocoon and sleep a long sleep, only to wake as a wasp and dig its way\nout to the open air.\n\nReaching the farther side of the plain, Burl found himself threading the\naisles of a fungus forest in which the growths were misshapen travesties\nof the trees which could not live here. Bloated yellow limbs branched\noff from rounded swollen trunks. Here and there a pear-shaped puffball,\nBurl's height and half his height again, waited until a chance touch\nshould cause it to shoot upward a curling puff of infinitely fine dust.\n\nHe continued to move with caution. There were dangers here, but he went\nforward steadily. He still held a great mass of edible mushroom under\none arm and from time to time broke off a fragment, chewing it\nmeditatively. But always his eyes searched here and there for threats of\nharm.\n\nBehind him the faint, shrill outcry had risen only slightly in volume.\nIt was still too far away to attract his notice. Army ants, however,\nwere working havoc in the distance. By thousands and millions, myriads\nof them advanced across the fungoid soil. They clambered over every\neminence. They descended into every depression. Their antennae waved\nrestlessly. Their mandibles were extended threateningly. The ground was\nblack with them, each one more than ten inches long.\n\nA single such creature, armored and fearless as it was, could be\nformidable enough to an unarmed and naked man like Burl. The better part\nof discretion would be avoidance. But numbering in the thousands and\nmillions, they were something which could not be avoided. They advanced\nsteadily and rapidly; the chorus of shrill stridulations and clickings\nmarking their progress.\n\nGreat, inoffensive caterpillars crawling over the huge cabbages heard\nthe sound of their coming, but were too stupid to flee. The black\nmultitudes blanketed the rank vegetables. Tiny, voracious jaws tore at\nthe flaccid masses of greasy flesh.\n\nThe caterpillars strove to throw off their assailants by writhings and\ncontortions--uselessly. The bees fought their entrance into the monster\nhives with stings and wing-beats. Moths took to the air in daylight with\ndazzled, blinded eyes. But nothing could withstand the relentless hordes\nof small black things that reeked of formic acid and left the ground\nbehind them empty of life.\n\nBefore the horde was a world of teeming life, where mushrooms and other\nfungi fought with thinning numbers of cabbages and mutant earth-weeds\nfor a foothold. Behind the black multitude was--nothing. Mushrooms,\ncabbages, bees, wasps, crickets, grubs--every living thing that could\nnot flee before the creeping black tide reached it was lost, torn to\nbits by tiny mandibles.\n\nEven the hunting spiders and tarantulas fell before the black host. They\nkilled many in their desperate self-defense, but the army ants could\noverwhelm anything--anything at all--by sheer numbers and ferocity.\nKilled or wounded ants served as food for their sound comrades. Only the\nweb spiders sat unmoved and immovable in their collossal snares, secure\nin the knowledge that their gummy webs could not be invaded along the\nslender supporting cables.\n\n\n\n\n_3. THE PURPLE HILLS_\n\n\nThe army ants flowed over the ground like a surging, monstrous, inky\ntide. Their vanguard reached the river and recoiled. Burl was perhaps\nfive miles away when they changed their course. The change was made\nwithout confusion, the leaders somehow communicating the altered line of\nmarch to those behind them.\n\nBack on Earth, scientists had gravely debated the question of how ants\nconveyed ideas to each other. Honeybees, it was said, performed\nelaborate ritual dances to exchange information. Ants, it had been\nobserved, had something less eccentric. A single ant, finding a bit of\nbooty too big for it to manage alone, would return to its city to secure\nthe help of others. From that fact men had deduced that a language of\ngestures made with crossed antennae must exist.\n\nBurl had no theories. He merely knew facts, but he did know that ants\ncould and did pass information to one another. Now, however, he moved\ncautiously along toward the sleeping-place of his tribe in complete\nignorance of the black blanket of living creatures spreading over the\nground behind him.\n\nA million tragedies marked the progress of the insect army. There was a\ntiny colony of mining bees, their habits unchanged despite their greater\nsize, here on the forgotten planet. A single mother, four feet long, had\ndug a huge gallery with some ten offshooting cells, in which she had\nlaid her eggs and fed her grubs with hard-gathered pollen. The grubs had\nwaxed fat and large, become bees, and laid eggs in their turn within the\nsame gallery their mother had dug out for them.\n\nTen bulky insects now foraged busily to feed their grubs within the\nancestral home, while the founder of the colony had grown draggled and\nwingless with the passing of time. Unable to bring in food, herself, the\nold bee became the guardian of the hive. She closed the opening with her\nhead, making a living barrier within the entrance. She withdrew only to\ngrant admission or exit to the duly authorized members,--her daughters.\n\nThe ancient concierge of the underground dwelling was at her post when\nthe wave of army ants swept over. Tiny, evil-smelling feet trampled upon\nher and she emerged to fight with mandible and sting for the sanctity of\nher brood. Within moments she was a shaggy mass of biting ants. They\nrent and tore at her chitinous armor. But she fought on madly, sounding\na buzzing alarm to the colonists yet within.\n\nThey came out, fighting as they came: ten huge bees, each four to five\nfeet long and fighting with legs and jaws, with wing and mandible, and\nwith all the ferocity of so many tigers. But the small ants covered\nthem, snapping at their multiple eyes, biting at the tender joints in\ntheir armour,--and sometimes releasing the larger prey to leap upon an\ninjured comrade, wounded by the monster they battled together.\n\nSuch a fight, however, could have but one end. Struggle as the bees\nmight, they were powerless against their un-numbered assailants. They\nwere being devoured even as they fought. And before the last of the ten\nwas down the underground gallery had been gutted both of the stored food\nbrought by the adult defenders and the last morsels of what had been\nyoung grubs, too unformed to do more than twitch helplessly,\ninoffensively, as they were torn to shreds.\n\nWhen the army ants went on there were merely an empty tunnel and a few\nfragments of tough armor, unappetizing even to the ants.\n\nBurl heard them as he meditatively inspected the scene of a tragedy of\nnot long before. The rent and scraped fragments of a great beetle's\nshiny casing lay upon the ground. A greater beetle had come upon the\nfirst and slain him. Burl regarded the remains of the meal.\n\nThree or four minims, little ants barely six inches long, foraged\nindustriously among the bits. A new ant-city was to be formed and the\nqueen lay hidden half a mile away. These were the first hatchlings. They\nwould feed their younger kindred until they grew large enough to take\nover the great work of the ant-city. Burl ignored the minims. He\nsearched for a weapon of some sort. Behind him the clicking,\nhigh-pitched roar of the horde of army ants increased in volume.\n\nHe turned away disgustedly. The best thing he could find in the way of\na weapon was a fiercely-toothed hind-leg. When he picked it up an angry\nwhine rose from the ground. One of the minims had been struggling to\ndetach a morsel of flesh from the leg-joint. Burl had snatched the\ntidbit from him.\n\nThe little creature was surely no more than half a foot long, but it\nadvanced angrily upon Burl, shrilling a challenge. He struck with the\nbeetle's leg and crushed the ant. Two of the other minims appeared,\nattracted by the noise the first had made. They discovered the crushed\nbody of their fellow, unceremoniously dismembered it, and bore it away\nin triumph.\n\nBurl went on, swinging the toothed limb in his hand. The sound behind\nhim became a distant whispering, high-pitched and growing steadily\nnearer. The army ants swept into a mushroom forest and the yellow,\numbrella-like growths soon swarmed with the black creatures.\n\nA great bluebottle fly, shining with a metallic lustre, stood beneath a\nmushroom on the ground. The mushroom was infected with maggots which\nexuded a solvent pepsin that liquefied the firm white meat. They swam\necstatically in the liquid gruel, some of which dripped and dripped to\nthe ground. The bluebottle was sipping the dark-colored liquid through\nits long proboscis, quivering with delight as it fed on the noisomeness.\n\nBurl drew near and struck. The fly collapsed in a quivering heap. Burl\nstood over it for an instant and pondered.\n\nThe army ants were nearer, now. They swarmed down into a tiny valley,\nrushing into and through a little brook over which Burl had leaped.\nSince ants can remain underwater for a long time without drowning, the\nsmall stream was not even dangerous. Its current did sweep some of them\naway. A great many of them, however, clung together until they chocked\nits flow by the mass of their bodies, the main force marching across the\nbridge they constituted.\n\nThe ants reached a place about a quarter of a mile to the left of Burl's\nline of march, perhaps a mile from the spot where he stood over the dead\nbluebottle. There was an expanse of some acres in which the giant, rank\ncabbages had so far succeeded in their competition with the world of\nfungi. The pale, cross-shaped flowers of the cabbages formed food for\nmany bees. The leaves fed numberless grubs and worms. Under the\nfallen-away dead foliage--single leaves were twenty feet across at their\nlargest--crickets hid and fed.\n\nThe ant-army flowed into this space, devouring every living thing it\nencountered. A terrible din arose. The crickets hurtled away in erratic\nleapings. They shot aimlessly in any direction. More than half of them\nlanded blindly in the carpeting of clicking black bodies which were the\nants from whose vanguard they had fled. Their blind flight had no effect\nsave to give different individuals the opportunity to seize them as they\nfell and instantly begin to devour them. As they were torn to fragments,\nhorrible screamings reached Burl's ears.\n\nA single such cry of agony would not have attracted Burl's attention. He\nlived in a world of nightmare horror. But a chorus of creatures in\ntorment made him look up. This was no minor horror. Something wholesale\nwas in progress. He jerked his head about to see what it was.\n\nA wild stretch of sickly yellow fungus was interspersed here and there\nwith a squat toadstool, or a splash of vivid color where one of the many\nrusts had found a foothold. To the left a group of branched fungoids\nclustered in silent mockery of a true forest. Burl saw the faded green\nof the cabbages.\n\nWith the sun never shining on the huge leaves save through the\ncloud-bank overhead, the cabbages were not vivid. There were even some\nmouldy yeasts of a brighter green and slime much more luridly tinted.\nEven so, the cabbages were the largest form of true vegetation Burl had\never seen. The nodding white cruciform flowers stood out plainly\nagainst the yellowish, pallid green of the leaves. But as Burl gazed at\nthem, the green slowly became black.\n\nThree great grubs, in lazy contentment, were eating ceaselessly of the\ncabbages on which they rested. Suddenly first one and then another began\nto jerk spasmodically. Burl saw that around each of them a rim of black\nhad formed. Then black motes milled all over them.\n\nThe grubs became black--covered with biting, devouring ants. The\ncabbages became black. The frenzied contortions of the grubs told of the\nagonies they underwent as they were literally devoured alive. And then\nBurl saw a black wave appear at the nearer edge of the stretch of yellow\nfungus. A glistening, living flood flowed forward over the ground with a\nroar of clickings and a persistent overtone of shrill stridulations.\n\nBurl's scalp crawled. He knew what this meant. And he did not pause to\nthink. With a gasp of pure panic he turned and fled, all intellectual\npreoccupations forgotten.\n\nThe black tide came on after him.\n\nHe flung away the edible mushroom he had carried under his arm. Somehow,\nthough, he clung to the sharp-toothed club as he darted between tangled\nmasses of fungus, ignoring now the dangers that ordinarily called for\nvast caution.\n\nHuge flies appeared. They buzzed about him loudly. Once he was struck on\nthe shoulder by one of them--at least as large as his hand--and his skin\ntorn by its swiftly vibrating wings.\n\nHe brushed it away and sped on. But the oil with which he was partly\ncovered had turned rancid, now, and the fetid odor attracted them. There\nwere half a dozen--then a dozen creatures the size of pheasants, droning\nand booming as they kept pace with his wild flight.\n\nA weight pressed onto his head. It doubled. Two of the disgusting\ncreatures had settled upon his oily hair to sip the stuff through their\nhairy feeding-tubes. Burl shook them off with his hand and raced madly\non, his ears attuned to the sounds of the ants behind him.\n\nThat clicking roar continued, but in Burl's ears it was almost drowned\nout by the noise made by the halo of flies accompanying him. Their\nbuzzing had deepened in pitch with the increase in size of all their\nrace. It was now the note close to the deepest bass tone of an organ.\nYet flies--though greatly enlarged on the forgotten planet--had not\nbecome magnified as much as some of the other creatures. There were no\ngreat heaps of putrid matter for them to lay their eggs in. The ants\nwere busy scavengers, carting away the debris of tragedies in the insect\nworld long before it could acquire the gamey flavor beloved of\nfly-maggots. Only in isolated spots were the flies really numerous. In\nsuch places they clustered in clouds.\n\nSuch a cloud began to form about Burl as he fled. It seemed as though a\nminiature whirlwind kept pace with him--a whirlwind composed of furry,\nrevolting bodies and multi-faceted eyes. Fleeing, Burl had to swing his\nclub before him to clear the way. Almost every stroke was interrupted by\nan impact against some thinly-armored body which collapsed with the\nspurting of reddish liquid.\n\nThen an anguish as of red-hot iron struck upon Burl's back. One of the\nstinging flies had thrust its sharp-tipped proboscis into his flesh to\nsuck the blood. Burl uttered a cry and ran full-tilt into the stalk of a\nblackened, draggled toadstool.\n\nThere was a curious crackling as of wet punk. The toadstool collapsed\nupon itself with a strange splashing sound. A great many creatures had\nlaid their eggs in it, until now it was a seething mass of corruption\nand ill-smelling liquid.\n\nWhen the toadstool crashed to the ground, it crumbled into a dozen\npieces, spattering the earth for yards all about with stinking stuff in\nwhich tiny, headless maggots writhed convulsively.\n\nThe deep-toned buzzing of the flies took on a note of solemn\nsatisfaction. They settled down upon this feast. Burl staggered to his\nfeet and darted off again. Now he was nothing but a minor attraction to\nthe flies, only three or four bothering to come after him. The others\nsettled by the edges of the splashing fluid, quickly absorbed in an\necstasy of feasting. The few still hovering about his head, Burl\nkilled,--but he did not have to smash them all. The remaining few\ndescended to feast on their fallen comrades twitching feebly at his\nfeet.\n\nHe ran on and passed beneath the wide-spreading leaves of an isolated\ngiant cabbage. A great grasshopper crouched on the ground, its\ntremendous radially-opening jaws crunching the rank vegetation. Half a\ndozen great worms ate steadily of the leaves that supported them. One\nhad swung itself beneath an overhanging leaf--which would have thatched\nhouses for men--and was placidly anchoring itself for the spinning of a\ncocoon in which to sleep the sleep of metamorphosis.\n\nA mile away, the great black tide of army ants advanced relentlessly.\nThe great cabbage, the huge grasshopper, and all the stupid caterpillars\non the leaves would presently be covered with small, black demons. The\ncocoon would never be spun. The caterpillars would be torn into\nthousands of furry fragments and devoured. The grasshopper would strike\nout with his terrific, unguided strength, crushing its assailants with\nblows of its great hind-legs and powerful jaws. But it would die, making\nterrible sounds of torments as the ants consumed it piecemeal.\n\nThe sound of the ants' advance overwhelmed all other noises now. Burl\nran madly, his breath coming in great gasps, his eyes wide with panic.\nAlone of the world about him, he knew the danger that followed him. The\ninsects he passed went about their business with that terrifying,\nabstracted efficiency found only in the insect world.\n\nBurl's heart pounded madly from his running. The breath whistled in his\nnostrils--and behind him the flood of army ants kept pace. They came\nupon the feasting flies. Some took to the air and escaped. Others were\ntoo absorbed in their delicious meal. The twitching maggots, stranded by\nthe scattering of their soupy broth, were torn to shreds and eaten. The\nflies who were seized vanished into tiny maws. And the serried ranks of\nants moved on.\n\nBurl could hear nothing else, now, but the clickings of their limbs and\nthe stridulating challenges and cross-challenges they uttered. Now and\nthen another sound pierced the noises made by the ants themselves: a\ncricket, perhaps, seized and dying, uttering deep-bass cries of agony.\n\nBefore the horde there was a busy world which teemed with life.\nButterflies floated overhead on lazy wings; grubs waxed fat and huge;\ncrickets feasted; great spiders sat quietly in their lairs, waiting with\nimplacable patience for prey to fall into the trap-doors and snares;\ngreat beetles lumbered through the mushroom forests, seeking food and\nmaking love in monstrous, tragic fashion.\n\nBehind the wide front of the army ants was--chaos. Emptiness.\nDesolation. All life save that of the army ants was exterminated, though\nsome bewildered flying creatures still fluttered helplessly over the\nsilent landscape. Yet even behind the army ants little bands of\nstragglers from the horde marched busily here and there, seeking some\ntrace of life that had been overlooked by the main body.\n\nBurl put forth his last ounce of strength. His limbs trembled. His\nbreathing was agony. Sweat stood out upon his forehead. He ran for his\nlife with the desperation of one who knows that death is at his heels.\nHe ran as if his continued existence among the million tragedies of the\nsingle day were the purpose for which the universe had been created.\n\nThere was redness in the west and in the cloud-bank overhead. To the\neast gray sky became a deeper gray--much deeper. It was not yet time for\nthe creatures of the day to seek their hiding-places, nor for the\nnight-insects to come forth. But in many secret spots there were vague\nand sleepy stirrings.\n\nHeedless of the approaching darkness Burl sped over an open space a\nhundred yards across. A thicket of beautifully golden mushrooms barred\nhis way. Danger lay there. He dogged aside and saw in the gray dusk a\nglistening sheet of white, barely a yard above the ground. It was the\nweb of the morning-spider which, on Earth, was noted only in hedges and\nsuch places when the dew of earliest dawn exposed it as a patternless\nplate of diamond-dust. There were anchor-cables, of course, but no\ngeometry. Tidy housewives--also on Earth--used to mop it out of corners\nas a filmy fabric of irritating gossamer. On the forgotten planet it was\na net with strength and bird-lime qualities that increased day by day,\nas its spinner moved restlessly over the surface, always trailing sticky\ncord behind itself.\n\nBurl had no choice but to avoid it, even though he lost ground to the\nant-horde roaring behind him. And night was definitely on the way. It\nwas inconceivable that a human should travel in the lowlands after dark.\nIt literally could not be done over the normal nightmare terrain. Burl\nhad not only to escape the army ants, but find a hiding-place quickly if\nhe was to see tomorrow's light. But he could not think so far ahead,\njust now.\n\nHe blundered through a screen of puffballs that shot dusty powder toward\nthe sky. Ahead, a range of strangely colored hills came into\nview--purple, green, black and gold--melting into each other and\nbranching off, inextricably mingled. They rose to a height of perhaps\nsixty or seventy feet. A curious grayish haze had gathered above them.\nIt seemed to be a layer of thin vapor, not like mist or fog, clinging to\ncertain parts of the hills, rising slowly to coil and gather into an\nindefinitely thicker mass above the ridges.\n\nThe hills themselves were not geological features, but masses of fungus\nthat had grown and cannibalized, piling up upon themselves to the\nthickness of carboniferous vegetation. Over the face of the hills grew\nevery imaginable variety of yeast and mould and rust. They grew within\nand upon themselves, forming freakish conglomerations that piled up into\na range of hills, stretching across the lunatic landscape for miles.\n\nBurl blundered up the nearest slope. Sometimes the surface was a hard\nrind that held him up. Sometimes his feet sank--perhaps inches, perhaps\nto mid-leg. He scrambled frantically. Panting, gasping, staggering from\nthe exhaustion of moving across the fungus quicksand, he made his way to\nthe top of the first hill, plunged down into a little valley on the\nfarther side, and up another slope. He left a clear trail behind him of\ndisturbed and scurrying creatures that had inevitably found a home in\nthe mass of living stuff. Small sinuous centipedes scuttled here and\nthere, roused by his passage. At the bottom of his footprints writhed\nfat white worms. Beetles popped into view and vanished again....\n\nA half mile across the range and Burl could go no farther. He stumbled\nand fell and lay there, gasping hoarsely. Overhead the gray sky had\nbecome a deep-red which was rapidly melting into that redness too deep\nto be seen except as black. But there was still some light from the\nwest.\n\nBurl sobbed for breath in a little hollow, his sharp-toothed club still\nclasped in his hands. Something huge, with wings like sails, soared in\nsilhouette against the sunset. Burl lay motionless, breathing in great\ngasps, his limbs refusing to lift him.\n\nThe sound of the army ants continued. At last, above the crest of the\nlast hillock he had surmounted, two tiny glistening antennae appeared,\nthen the small, deadly shape of an army ant. The forerunner of its\nhorde, it moved deliberately forward, waving its antennae ceaselessly.\nIt made its way toward Burl, tiny clickings coming from its limbs.\n\nA little wisp of vapor swirled toward the ant. It was the vapor that had\ngathered over the whole range of hills as a thin, low cloud. It\nenveloped the ant which seemed to be thrown into a strange convulsion,\nthrowing itself about, legs moving aimlessly. If it had been an animal\ninstead of an insect, it would have choked and gasped. But ants breathe\nthrough air-holes in their abdomens. It writhed helplessly on the spongy\nstuff across which it had been moving.\n\nBurl was conscious of a strange sensation. His body felt remarkably\nwarm. It felt hot. It was an unparalleled sensation, because Burl had no\nexperience of fire or the heat of the sun. The only warmth he had ever\nknown was when huddling together with his tribesmen in some hiding-place\nto avoid the damp chill of the night.\n\nThen, the heat of their breath and flesh helped to combat discomfort.\nBut this was a fiercer heat. It was intolerable. Burl moved his body\nwith a tremendous effort and for a moment the fungus soil was cool\nbeneath him. Then the sensation of hotness began again and increased\nuntil Burl's skin was reddened and inflamed.\n\nThe tenuous vapor, too, seemed to swirl his way. It made his lungs smart\nand his eyes water. He still breathed in painful gasps, but even that\nshort period of rest had done him some good. But it was the heat that\ndrove him to his feet again. He crawled painfully to the crest of the\nnext hill. He looked back.\n\nThis was the highest hill he had come upon and he could see most of the\npurple range in the deep, deep dusk. Now he was more than halfway\nthrough the hills. He had barely a quarter-mile to go, northward. But\neast and west the range of purple hills was a ceaseless, undulating mass\nof lifts and hollows, of ridges and spurs of all imaginable colorings.\n\nAnd at the tips of most of them were wisps of curling gray.\n\nFrom his position he could see a long stretch of the hills not hidden by\nthe surrounding darkness. Back along the way he had come, the army ants\nnow swept up into the range of hills. Scouts and advance-guard parties\nscurried here and there. They stopped to devour the creatures inhabiting\nthe surface layers. But the main body moved on inexorably.\n\nThe hills, though, were alive, not upheavals of the ground but festering\nheaps of insanely growing fungus, hollowed out in many places by\ntunnels, hiding-places, and lurking-places. These the ants invaded. They\nswept on, devouring everything....\n\nBurl leaned heavily upon his club and watched dully. He could run no\nmore. The army ants were spreading everywhere. They would reach him\nsoon.\n\nFar to the right, the vapor thickened. A thin column of smoke arose in\nthe dim half-light. Burl did not know smoke, of course. He could not\nconceivably guess that deep down in the interior of the insanely growing\nhills, pressure had killed and oxidation had carbonized the once-living\nmaterial. By oxidation the temperature down below had been raised. In\nthe damp darkness of the bowels of the hills spontaneous combustion had\nbegun.\n\nThe great mounds of tinderlike mushroom had begun to burn very slowly,\nquite unseen. There had been no flames because the hills' surface\nremained intact and there was no air to feed the burning. But when the\narmy ants dug ferociously for fugitive small things, air was admitted to\ntunnels abandoned because of heat.\n\nThen slow combustion speeded up. Smoulderings became flames. Sparks\nbecame coals. A dozen columns of fume-laden smoke rose into the heavens\nand gathered into a dense pall above the range of purple hills. And Burl\napathetically watched the serried ranks of army ants march on toward the\nwidening furnaces that awaited them.\n\nThey had recoiled from the river instinctively. But their ancestors had\nnever known fire. In the Amazon basin, on Earth, there had never been\nforest fires. On the forgotten planet there had never been fires at all,\nunless the first forgotten colonists tried to make them. In any case the\narmy ants had no instinctive terror of flame. They marched into the\nblazing openings that appeared in the hills. They snapped with their\nmandibles at the leaping flames, and sprang to grapple with the burning\ncoals.\n\nThe blazing areas widened as the purple surface was consumed. Burl\nwatched without comprehension--even without thankfulness. He stood\nbreathing more and more easily until the glow from approaching flames\nreddened his skin and the acrid smoke made tears flow from his eyes.\nThen he retreated slowly, leaning on his club and often looking back.\n\nNight had fallen, but yet it was light to the army ants. They marched\non, shrilling their defiance. They poured devotedly--and\nferociously--into the inferno of flame. At last there were only small\ngroups of stragglers from the great ant-army scurrying here and there\nover the ground their comrades had stripped of all life. The bodies of\nthe main army made a vast malodor, burning in the furnace of the hills.\n\nThere had been pain in that burning, agony such as no one would willing\ndwell upon. But it came of the insane courage of the ants, attacking the\nburning stuff with their horny jaws, rolling over and over with flaming\nlumps of charcoal clutched in their mandibles. Burl heard them shrilling\ntheir war-cry even as they died. Blinded, antennae singed off, legs\nshriveling, they yet went forward to attack their impossible enemy.\n\nBurl made his way slowly over the hills. Twice he saw small bodies of\nthe vanished army. They had passed between the widening furnaces and\nfuriously devoured all that moved as they forged ahead. Once Burl was\nspied, and a shrill cry sounded, but he moved on and only a single ant\nrushed after him. Burl brought down his club and a writhing body\nremained to be eaten by its comrades when they came upon it.\n\nAnd now the last faint traces of light had vanished in the west. There\nwas no real brightness anywhere except the flames of the burning hills.\nThe slow, slow nightly rain that dripped down all through the dark hours\nbegan. It made a pattering noise upon the unburnt part of the hills.\n\nBurl found firm ground beneath his feet. He listened keenly for sounds\nof danger. Something rustled heavily in a thicket of toadstools a\nhundred feet away. There were sounds of preening, and of feet delicately\nplaced here and there upon the ground. Then a great body took to the air\nwith the throbbing beat of mighty wings.\n\nA fierce down-current of air smote Burl, and he looked upward in time to\nglimpse the outline of a huge moth passing overhead. He turned to watch\nthe line of its flight, and saw the fierce glow filling all the horizon.\nThe hills burned brighter as the flames widened.\n\nHe crouched beneath a squat toadstool and waited for the dawn. The\nslow-dripping rain kept on, falling with irregular, drum-like beats upon\nthe tough top of the toadstool.\n\nHe did not sleep. He was not properly hidden, and there was always\ndanger in the dark. But this was not the darkness Burl was used to. The\ngreat fires grew and spread in the masses of ready-carbonized mushroom.\nThe glare on the horizon grew brighter through the hours. It also came\nnearer.\n\nBurl shivered a little, as he watched. He had never even dreamed of fire\nbefore, and even the overhanging clouds were lighted by these flames.\nOver a stretch at least a dozen miles in length and from half a mile to\nthree miles across, the seething furnaces and columns of flame-lit smoke\nsent illumination over the world. It was like the glow the lights of a\ncity can throw upon the sky. And like the flitting of aircraft above a\ncity was the assembly of fascinated creatures of the night.\n\nGreat moths and flying beetles, gigantic gnats and midges grown huge\nupon this planet, fluttered and danced above the flames. As the fire\ncame nearer, Burl could see them: colossal, delicately-formed creatures\nsweeping above the white-hot expanse. There were moths with\nriotously-colored wings of thirty-foot spread, beating the air with\nmighty strokes, their huge eyes glowing like garnets as they stared\nintoxicatedly at the incandescence below them.\n\nBurl saw a great peacock-moth soaring above the hills with wings all of\nforty feet across. They fluttered like sails of unbelievable\nmagnificence. And this was when all the separate flames had united to\nform a single sheet of white-hot burning stuff spread across the land\nfor miles.\n\nFeathery antennae of the finest lace spread out before the head of the\npeacock-moth; its body was of softest velvet. A ring of snow-white fur\nmarked where its head began. The glare from below smote the maroon of\nits body with a strange effect. For one instant it was outlined clearly.\nIts eyes shone more redly than any ruby's fire. The great, delicate\nwings were poised in flight. Burl caught the flash of flame upon the two\ngreat irridescent spots on the wings. Shining purple and bright red, all\nthe glory of chalcedony and of chrysoprase was reflected in the glare of\nburning fungi.\n\nAnd then Burl saw it plunge downward, straight into the thickest and\nfiercest of the leaping flames. It flung itself into the furnace as a\nwilling, drunken victim of their beauty.\n\nFlying beetles flew clumsily above the pyre also, their horny wing-cases\nstiffly outstretched. In the light from below they shone like burnished\nmetal. Their clumsy bodies, with spurred and fierce-toothed limbs,\ndarted through the flame-lit smoke like so many grotesque meteors.\n\nBurl saw strange collisions and still stranger meetings. Male and female\nflying creatures circled and spun in the glare, dancing their dance of\nlove and death. They mounted higher than Burl could see, drunk with the\necstasy of living, and then descended to plunge headlong in the roaring\nflames below.\n\nFrom every side the creatures came. Moths of brightest yellow, with\nfurry bodies palpitant with life, flew madly to destruction. Other moths\nof a deepest black, with gruesome symbols on their wings, swiftly came\nto dance above the glow like motes in sunlight.\n\nAnd Burl crouched beneath a toadstool, watching while the perpetual,\nslow raindrops fell and fell, and a continuous hissing noise came from\nwhere the rain splashed amid the flames.\n\n\n\n\n_4. A KILLER OF MONSTERS_\n\n\nThe night wore on, while the creatures above the firelight danced and\ndied, their numbers ever reinforced by fresh arrivals. Burl sat tensely\nstill, his eyes watching everything while his mind groped for an\nexplanation of what he saw. At last the sky grew dimly gray, then\nbrighter, and after a long time it was day. The flames of the burning\nhills seemed to dim and die as all the world became bright. After a long\nwhile Burl crawled from his hiding-place and stood erect.\n\nNo more than two hundred paces from where he stood, a straight wall of\nsmoke rose from the still-smouldering fungus-range. Burl could see the\nsmoke rising for miles on either hand. He turned to continue on his way,\nand saw the remains of one of the tragedies of the night.\n\nA great moth had flown into the flames, been horribly scorched, and\nfloundered out again. Had it been able to fly, it would have returned to\nits devouring deity; but now it lay upon the ground, its antennae\nhopelessly seared. One beautiful wing was nothing but gaping holes. The\neyes had been dimmed by flame. The exquisitely tapering limbs lay\nbroken and crushed by the violence of landing. The creature was helpless\non the ground, only the stumps of its antennae moving restlessly and the\nabdomen pulsating slowly as it drew pain-racked breaths.\n\nBurl drew near. He raised his club.\n\nWhen he moved on there was a velvet cloak cast over his shoulders,\ngleaming with all the colors of the rainbows. A gorgeous mass of soft\nblue moth-fur was about his middle, and he had bound upon his forehead\ntwo yard-long fragments of the moth's magnificent antennae.\n\nHe strode on slowly, clad as no man had been clad in all the ages before\nhim. After a while another victim of the holocaust--similarly blundered\nout to die--yielded him a spear that was longer and sharper and much\nmore deadly than his first. So he took up his journey to Saya looking\nlike a prince of Ind upon a bridal journey--though surely no mere prince\never wore such raiment.\n\nFor many miles, Burl threaded his way through an extensive forest of\nthin-stalked toadstools. They towered high over his head, colorful,\nparasitic moulds and rusts all about their bases. Twice he came upon\nopen glades where bubbling pools of green slime festered in corruption.\nOnce he hid himself as a monster scarabeus beetle lumbered by three\nyards away, clanking like some mighty machine.\n\nBurl saw the heavy armor and inward-curving jaws of the monster. He\nalmost envied him his weapons. The time was not yet come, though, when\nBurl and his kind would hunt such giants for the juicy flesh within its\narmored limbs. Burl was still a savage, still ignorant, still\nessentially timid. His only significant advance had been that where at\nfirst he had fled without reasoning, now he paused to see if he need\nflee.\n\nHe was a strange sight, moving through the shadowed lanes of the forest\nin his cloak of velvet. The fierce-toothed leg of a fighting beetle\nrested in a strip of sinew about his waist, ready for use. His new spear\nwas taller than himself. He looked like a conqueror. But he was still a\nfearful and feeble creature, no match for the monstrous creatures about\nhim. He was weak--and in that lay his greatest hope. Because if he were\nstrong, he would not need to think.\n\nHundreds of thousands of years before, his ancestors had been forced to\ndevelop brains as penalty for the lack of claws or fangs. Burl was sunk\nas low as any of them, but he had to combat more horrifying enemies,\nmore inexorable dangers, and many times more crafty antagonists. His\nancestors had invented knives and spears and flying missiles, but the\ncreatures about Burl had weapons a thousand times more deadly than the\nones that had defended the first humans.\n\nThe fact, however, simply put a premium on the one faculty Burl had\nwhich the insect world has not.\n\nIn mid-morning he heard a discordant, deep-bass bellow, coming from a\nspot not twenty yards from where he moved. He hid in panic, waiting for\nan instant, listening.\n\nThe bellow came again, but this time with a querulous note. Burl heard a\ncrashing and plunging as of some creature caught in a snare. A mushroom\ntumbled with a spongelike sound, and the thud was followed by a\ntremendous commotion. Something was fighting desperately against\nsomething else, but Burl did not know what creatures were in combat.\n\nHe waited, and the noise died gradually away. Presently his breath came\nmore slowly and his courage returned. He stole from his hiding-place and\nwould have made away, but new curiosity held him back. Instead of\ncreeping from the scene, he moved cautiously toward the source of the\nnoise.\n\nPeering between two cream-colored stalks he saw a wide, funnel-shaped\nsnare of silk spread out before him, some twenty yards across and as\nmany deep. The individual threads could be plainly seen, but in the mass\nit seemed a fabric of sheerest, finest texture. Held up by tall\nmushrooms, it was anchored to the ground below and drew away to a small\npoint through which a hole led to some as yet unseen recess. All the\nspace of the wide snare was hung with threads: fine, twisted threads no\nmore than half the thickness of Burl's finger.\n\nThis was the trap of a labyrinth spider. Not one of the interlacing\nstrands was strong enough to hold any but the feeblest prey, but the\nthreads were there by thousands. A cricket had become entangled in the\nsticky maze. Its limbs thrashed out and broke threads with every stroke,\nbut each time became entangled in a dozen more. It struggled mightily,\nemitting at intervals--again--its horrible bass roar.\n\nBurl breathed more easily. He watched with fascinated eyes. Mere death\namong insects--even tragic death--held no great interest for him. It was\ntoo common an occurrence. And there were few insects which deliberately\nsought man. Most insects have their allotted prey and will seek no\nothers.\n\nBut this involved a spider, and spiders have a terrifying impartiality.\nA spider devouring some luckless insect was but an example of what might\nhappen to Burl. So he watched alertly, his eyes traveling from the\nenmeshed cricket to the strange opening at the back of the funnel-shaped\nlabyrinth.\n\nThat opening darkened. Two shining, glistening eyes had been watching\nfrom the tunnel in which the spider had been waiting. Now it swung out\nlightly, revealing itself as a gray spider, with twin black ribbons upon\nits thorax and two stripes of curiously speckled brown and white upon\nits abdomen. Burl saw, also, two curious appendages like a tail, as it\ncame nimbly out of its hiding-place and approached the trapped creature.\n\nThe cricket was struggling weakly, now, and the cries it uttered were\nbut feeble, because of the cords that fettered its limbs. Burl saw the\nspider throw itself upon the cricket which gave one final, convulsive\nshudder as fangs pierced its armor.\n\nShortly after, the spider fed. With bestial enjoyment it sucked all the\nsucculence, all the fluid, from its victim's carcass.\n\nThen the breath left Burl in a peculiar, frightened gasp. It was not\nfrom anything he saw or heard. It was something that he thought.\n\nFor a second, his knees knocked together in self-induced panic. It\noccurred to him that he, Burl, had killed a hunting spider--a\ntarantula--upon the red-clay cliff. True, the killing had been an\naccident and had nearly cost him his own life in the web-spider's snare.\nBut--he had killed a spider and of the most deadly kind. Now it occurred\nto Burl that he could kill another.\n\nSpiders were the ogres of the human tribes on the forgotten planet.\nKnowledge of them was hard to come by, because to study them was death.\nBut all men knew that web-spiders never left their traps. Never! And\nBurl had imagined himself making an impossibly splendid, incredibly\ndaring use of that fact.\n\nDenying to himself that he intended any action so suicidal, he\nnevertheless drew back from the front of the snare and made his way to\nthe back, where the spider's tunnel was no more than ten feet away.\n\nThen he found himself waiting.\n\nPresently, through the interstices of the silk, he saw the gray bulk of\nthe spider. It had left the drained and shrunken carcass of the cricket\nto return to its resting-place, settling itself carefully upon the soft\nwalls of the fabric tunnel. From the yielding, globular nest at the\ntunnel's end it fixed maniacal eyes once more upon the threads of its\nsnare, seen down the length of the passage-way.\n\nBurl's hair stood on end from sheer fright, but he was the slave of an\nidea.\n\nThe tunnel and the nest at its end did not rest on the ground, but were\nsuspended in air by cables like those that spread the gin itself. The\ngray labyrinth-spider bulged the fabric. It lay in luxurious comfort,\nwaiting for victims to approach.\n\nThere was sweat on Burl's face as he raised his spear. The bare idea of\nattacking a spider was horrifying. But actually he was in no danger\nwhatever before the instant of the spear-thrust, because web-spiders\nnever, never, leave their webs to hunt.\n\nSo Burl sweated, and grasped his spear with agonized firmness--and\nthrust it into the bulge that was the spider's body in its nest. He\nthrust with hysterical fury.\n\nAnd then he ran as if the devil were after him.\n\nIt was a long time before he dared come back, his heart in his throat.\nAll was still. He had missed the horrid convulsions of the wounded\nspider; he had not heard the frightful gnashings of its fangs at the\npiercing weapon, nor seen the silken threads of the tunnel ripped and\ntorn in the spider's death-struggle. Burl came back to quietness. There\nwas a great rent in the silken tunnel, and a puddle of ill-smelling\nstuff lay upon the ground. From time to time another droplet fell from\nthe spear to join it. And the great spider had fallen half through its\nown enlargement of the rent made by the spear in the wall of the nest.\n\nBurl stared. Even when he saw it, the thing was not easy to believe. The\ndead eyes of the spider looked at him with mad, frozen malignity. The\nfangs were still raised to kill. The hairy legs were still braced as if\nto enlarge further the gaping hole through which it had partly fallen.\n\nThen Burl felt exultation. His tribe had been furtive vermin for almost\nforty generations, fleeing from the mighty insects, hiding from them,\nand when caught waiting helplessly for death, screaming shrilly in\nhorror. But he, Burl, had turned the tables. He, a man, had killed a\nspider! His breast expanded. Always his tribesmen went quietly and\nfearfully, making no sound. But a sudden, surprising, triumphant yell\nburst from Burl's lips--the first hunting-cry of man upon the forgotten\nplanet in two thousand years.\n\nNext second, of course, his pulse almost stopped in sheer terror because\nhe had made such a noise. He listened fearfully. The insect world was\noblivious to him. Presently, shuddering but infinitely proud, he drew\nnear his prey. He carefully withdrew his spear, poised to flee if the\nspider stirred. It did not. It was dead. The blood upon the spear was\nrevolting. Burl wiped it off on a leathery toadstool. Then....\n\nHe thought of Saya and his tribesmen. Trembling even as he gloated over\nhis own remarkable self, he shifted the spider and worked it out of the\nnest. Presently he moved off with the belly of the spider upon his back\nand two of its hairy legs over his shoulders. The other limbs of the\nmonster hung limp, trailing on the ground behind him.\n\nMarching, then he was the first such spectacle in history. His velvet\ncloak shining with its irridescent spots, the yard-long scraps of golden\nantennae bound to his forehead, a spear in his hand, and the hideous\nbulk of a gray spider for burden--Burl was a very strange sight indeed.\n\nHe believed that other creatures fled before him because of the thing he\ncarried. He tended to grow haughty. But actually, of course, insects do\nnot know fear. They recognize their own specific enemies. That is\nnecessary. But the his of the lowlands on the forgotten planet went on\nabstractedly, despite the splendid feat of one man.\n\nBurl marched. He came upon a valley full of torn and tattered mushrooms.\nThere was not a single yellow top among them. Every one had been\ninfested with maggots that had liquefied the tough meat of the\nmushroom-tops, causing it to drip to the ground below. The liquid was\ngathered in a golden pool in the center of the small depression. Burl\nheard a loud and deep-toned humming before he saw the valley. Then he\nstopped and looked down.\n\nHe saw the golden pond, its surface reflecting the gray sky and the\ndarkened stumps of mushrooms on the hillside which looked as if they had\nbeen blackened by a running flame. A small brooklet of golden liquid\ntrickled over a rocky ledge, and all round the edges of the pond and\nbrook, in ranks and rows, by hundreds and by thousands and it seemed by\nmillions, were the green-gold bodies of great flies.\n\nThey were small compared to other insects. The flesh-flies laid their\neggs by the hundreds in decaying carcasses. The others chose mushrooms\nto lay their eggs in. To feed the maggots that would hatch, a relatively\ngreat quantity of food was needed; therefore, the flies must remain\ncomparatively small, or the body of a single grasshopper would furnish\nfood for only a few maggots instead of the hundreds it must support.\nThere must also be a limit to the size of worms if hundreds were to\nfeast upon a single fungus.\n\nBut there was no limitation to the greediness of the adult creatures.\nThere were bluebottles and green-bottles and all the flies of metallic\nlustre, gathered at a Lucullan feast of corruption. The buzzing of those\nswarming above the golden pool was a tremendous sound. The flying bodies\nflashed and glittered as they flew back and forth, seeking a place to\nalight and join in the orgy.\n\nThe glittering bodies clustered in already-found places were motionless\nas if carved from metal. Burl watched them. And then he saw motion\noverhead.\n\nA slender, brilliant shape appeared, darting swiftly through the air,\nenlarging into a needle-like body with transparent, shining wings and\ntwo huge eyes. It circled and enlarged again, becoming a shimmering\ndragonfly, twenty feet and more in length. It poised itself abruptly\nabove the pool, and then darted down, its jaws snapping viciously. They\nsnapped again and again. Burl could not follow their slashings. And with\neach snap the glittering body of a fly vanished.\n\nA second dragonfly appeared and a third. They swooped above the golden\npool, snapping in mid-air, making their abrupt and angular turns,\ncreatures of incredible ferocity and beauty. In that mass of buzzing\ncreatures, even the most voracious appetite must soon have been sated,\nbut the slender creatures still darted about in frenzied destruction.\n\nAnd all this while the loud, contented, deep-bass humming went on as\nbefore. Their comrades were slaughtered by the hundreds not forty feet\nabove their heads, but still the glittering rows of red-eyed flies\ngorged themselves upon the fluid of the pond. The dragonflies feasted\nuntil they were unable to devour even a single one more of their chosen\nprey. But even then they continued to sweep madly above the pool,\nstriking down the buzzing flies though their bodies must perforce remain\nuneaten.\n\nSome of the dead flies, crushed to pulp by the angry dragonflies,\ndropped among their feasting brothers. Presently, one of them placed its\ndisgusting proboscis upon the mangled creature. It sipped daintily from\nthe contents of the broken armor. Another joined it and another. In a\nlittle while a cluster of them pushed against each other for a chance to\njoin them in a cannibalistic feast.\n\nBurl turned aside and went on, leaving the dragonflies still at their\nmassacre and the flies absorbed and ecstatic at their feast. The feast,\nindeed, was improved by the rain of murdered brethren from overhead.\n\nOnly a few miles farther on, Burl came upon a familiar landmark. He knew\nit well, but had always kept at a safe distance from it. A mass of rock\nhad heaved itself up from the almost level plain over which he traveled\nto form an out-jutting cliff. At one point the rock overhung, forming an\ninverted ledge--a roof over nothingness--which had been preempted by a\nhairy monster and made into a fairy-like dwelling. A white hemisphere\nclung to the rock, firmly anchored by long cables.\n\nBurl knew the place as one to be feared. A clotho spider had built\nitself a nest there, from which it emerged to hunt the unwary. Within\nthe silken globe was a monstrosity, resting upon cushions of softest\nsilk. The exterior had been beautiful once. But if one went too near one\nof the little inverted arches seemingly closed by panels of silk--it\nwould open and out would rush a creature from a dream of hell.\n\nSurely Burl knew this place. Hung upon the walls of the fairy palace\nwere trophies. They had a purpose, of course. Stones and boulders hung\nthere, too, to hold the structure firm against the storm-winds that\nrarely blew. But amid the stones and fragments of insect-armor there was\na very special decoration: the shrunken, dessicated skeleton of a man.\n\nThe death of that man had saved Burl's life two years before. They had\nbeen together, seeking a new source of edible mushroom. The clotho\nspider was a hunter, not a spinner of webs. It had sprung suddenly from\nbehind a great puffball as the two men froze in horror. Then it had come\nforward and deliberately chosen its victim. It did not choose Burl.\n\nNow he looked with half-frightened speculation at the lair of his\nancient enemy. Some day, perhaps....\n\nBut now he passed on. He went past the thicket in which the great moths\nhid by day, past the slimy pool in which something unknown but terrible\nlurked. He penetrated the little forest of mushrooms that glowed at\nnight and the place where the truffle-hunting beetles chirped\nthunderously during the dark hours.\n\nAnd then he saw Saya. He caught a flash of pink skin vanishing behind a\nsquat toadstool, and he ran forward calling her name. She emerged, and\nsaw the figure with the horrible bulk of the spider on its back. She\ncried out in horror, and Burl understood. He let his burden fall,\nrunning swiftly to her.\n\nThey met. Saya waited timidly until she saw who this man was, and then\nshe was astounded indeed. With golden plumes rising from his head, a\nvelvet cloak about his shoulders, blue moth-fur about his middle, and a\nspear in his hand--and a dead spider behind him!--this was not the Burl\nshe had known.\n\nHe took her hands, babbling proudly. She stared at him and at his\nvictim--but the language of men had diminished sadly--struggling to\ncomprehend. Presently her eyes glowed. She pulled at his wrists.\n\nWhen they found the other tribesmen, they were carrying the dead spider\nbetween them, Saya looking more proud than Burl.\n\n\n\n\n_5. MEAT OF MAN'S KILLING!_\n\n\nIn their climb up from savagery, the principal handicap from which men\nhave always suffered is the fact that they are human. Or it can be said\nthat human beings always have to struggle against the obstacle which is\nsimply that they are men. To Burl his splendid return to the tribe\ncalled for a suitable reaction. He expected them to take note that he\nwas remarkable, unparalleled, and in all ways admirable. He expected\nthem to look at him with awe. He rather hoped that the sight of him\nwould involve something like ecstasy.\n\nAnd as a matter of fact, it did. For fully an hour they gathered around\nhim while he used his--and their--scanty vocabulary to tell them of his\nunique achievements and adventures during the past two days and nights.\nThey listened attentively and with appropriate admiration and vicarious\npride.\n\nThis in itself was a step upward. Mostly their talk was of where food\nmight be found and where danger lurked. Strictly practical data\nconnected with the pressing business of getting enough to eat and\nstaying alive. The sheer pressure of existence was so great that the\nhumans Burl knew had altogether abandoned such luxuries as boastful\nnarrative. They had given up tradition. They did not think of art in\neven its most primitive forms, and the only craft they knew was the\ncraftiness which promoted simple survival. So for them to listen to a\nnarrative which did not mean either food or even a lessening of danger\nto themselves was a step upward on the cultural scale.\n\nBut they were savages. They inspected the dead spider, shuddering. It\nwas pure horror. They did not touch it--the adults not at all, and even\nDik and Tet not for a very long time. Nobody thought of spiders as food.\nToo many of them had been spiders' food.\n\nBut presently even the horror aroused by the spider palled. The younger\nchildren quailed at sight of it, of course; but the adults came to\nignore it. Only the two gangling boys tried to break off a furry leg\nwith which to charge and terrify the younger ones still further. They\nfailed to get it loose because they did not think of cutting it. But\nthey had nothing to cut it with anyhow.\n\nOld Jon went wheezing off, foraging. He waved a hand to Burl as he went.\nBurl was indignant. But it was true that he had brought back no food.\nAnd people must eat.\n\nTama went off, her tongue clacking, with Lona the half-grown girl to\nhelp her find and bring back something edible. Dor, the strongest man in\nthe tribe, went away to look where he thought there might be edible\nmushrooms full-grown again. Cori left with her children--very carefully\non watch for danger to them--to see what she could find.\n\nIn little more than an hour Burl's audience had diminished to Saya.\nWithin two hours ants found the spider where it had been placed for the\ntribe to admire. Within three hours there was nothing left of it. During\nthe fourth hour--as Burl struggled to dredge up some new, splendid item\nto tell Saya for the tenth time, or thereabouts--during the fourth hour\none of the tribeswomen beckoned to Saya. She left with a flashing\nbackward smile for Burl. She went, actually, to help dig up underground\nfungi--much like truffles--discovered by the older woman. She\nundoubtedly expected to share them with Burl.\n\nBut in five hours it was night and Burl was very indignant with his\ntribesfolk. They had shifted the location of the hiding-place for the\nnight, and nobody had thought to tell him. And if Saya wished to come\nfor Burl, to lead him to that place, she did not dare for the simple\nreason that it was night.\n\nFor a long time after he found a hiding-place, Burl fumed bitterly to\nhimself. He was very much of a human being, differing from his\nfellows--so far--mainly because he had been through experiences not\nshared by them. He had resolved a subjective dilemma of sorts by\ndetermining to return to his tribe. He had discovered a weapon which, at\nfirst, had promised--and secured--foodstuff, and later had saved him\nfrom a tarantula. His discovery that fish-oil was useful when applied to\nspider-snares and things sticking to the feet was of vast importance to\nthe tribe. Most remarkable of all, he had deliberately killed a spider.\nAnd he had experienced triumph. Temporarily he had even experienced\nadmiration.\n\nThe adulation was a thing which could never be forgotten. Human\nappetites are formed by human experiences. One never had an appetite for\na thing one has not known in some fashion. But no human being who has\nknown triumph is ever quite the same again, and anybody who has once\nbeen admired by his fellows is practically ruined for life--at least so\nfar as being independent of admiration is concerned.\n\nSo during the dark hours, while the slow rain dipped in separate, heavy\ndrops from the sky, Burl first coddled his anger--which was a very good\nthing for a member of a race grown timorous and furtive--and then began\nto make indignant plans to force his tribesmen to yield him more of the\ndelectable sensations he alone had begun to know.\n\nHe was not especially comfortable during the night. The hiding-place he\nhad chosen was not water-tight. Water trickled over him for several\nhours before he discovered that his cloak, though it would not keep him\ndry--which it would have done if properly disposed--would still keep the\nsame water next to his skin where his body could warm it. Then he slept.\nWhen morning came he felt singularly refreshed. For a savage, he was\nunusually clean, too.\n\nHe woke before dawn with vainglorious schemes in his head. The sky grew\ngray and then almost white. The overhanging cloud bank seemed almost to\ntouch the earth, but gradually withdrew. The mist among the\nmushroom-forests grew thinner, and the slow rain ceased reluctantly.\nWhen he peered from his hiding-place, the mad world he knew was, as far\nas he could see, quite mad, as usual. The last of the night-insects had\nvanished. The day-creatures began to venture out.\n\nNot too far from the crevice where he'd hidden was an ant-hill,\nmonstrous by standards on other planets. It was piled up not of sand but\ngravel and small boulders. Burl saw a stirring. At a certain spot the\nsmooth, outer surface crumbled and fell into an invisible opening. A\nspot of darkness appeared. Two slender, thread-like antennae popped out.\nThey withdrew and popped out again. The spot enlarged until there was a\nsizeable opening. An ant appeared, one of the warrior-ants of this\nparticular breed. It stood fiercely over the opening, waving its\nantennae agitatedly as if striving to sense some danger to its\nmetropolis.\n\nHe was fourteen inches long, this warrior, and his mandibles were fierce\nand strong. After a moment, two other warriors thrust past him. They ran\nabout the whole extent of the ant-hill, their legs clicking, antennae\nwaving restlessly.\n\nThey returned, seeming to confer with the first, then went back down\ninto the city with every appearance of satisfaction. As if they made a\nproperly reassuring report, within minutes afterward, a flood of black,\nill-smelling workers poured out of the opening and dispersed about\ntheir duties.\n\nThe city of the ants had begun its daily toil. There were deep galleries\nunderground here: graineries, storage-vaults, refectories, and\nnurseries, and even a royal apartment in which the queen-ant reposed.\nShe was waited upon by assiduous courtiers, fed by royal stewards, and\ncombed and caressed by the hands of her subjects and children. A dozen\ntimes larger than her loyal servants, she was no less industrious than\nthey in her highly specialized fashion. From the time of waking to the\ntime of rest she was queen-mother in the most literal imaginable sense.\nAt intervals, to be measured only in minutes, she brought forth an egg,\nperhaps three inches in length, which was whisked away to the municipal\nnursery. And this constant, insensate increase in the population of the\ncity made all its frantic industry at once possible and necessary.\n\nBurl came out and spread his cloak on the ground. In a little while he\nfelt a tugging at it. An ant was tearing off a bit of the hem. Burl slew\nthe ant angrily and retreated. Twice within the next half-hour he had to\nmove swiftly to avoid foragers who would not directly attack him because\nhe was alive--unless he seemed to threaten danger--but who lusted after\nthe fabric of his garments.\n\nThis annoyance--and Burl would merely have taken it as a thing to be\naccepted a mere two days before--this annoyance added to Burl's\nindignation with the world about him. He was in a very bad temper indeed\nwhen he found old Jon, wheezing as he checked on the possibility of\nthere being edible mushrooms in a thicket of poisonous, pink-and-yellow\namanitas.\n\nBurl haughtily commanded Jon to follow him. Jon's untidy whiskers parted\nas his mouth dropped open in astonishment. Burl's tribe was so far from\nbeing really a tribe that for anybody to give a command was astonishing.\nThere was no social organization, absolutely no tradition of command.\nAs a rule life was too uncertain for anybody to establish authority.\n\nBut Jon followed Burl as he stamped on through the morning mist. He saw\na small movement and shouted imperatively. This was appalling! Men did\nnot call attention to themselves! He gathered up Dor, the strongest of\nthe men. Later, he found Jak who some day would wear an expression of\nmonkey-like wisdom. Then Tet and Dik, the half-grown boys, came trooping\nto see what was happening.\n\nBurl led onward. A quarter of a mile and they came upon a great, gutted\nshell which had been a rhinoceros beetle the day before. Today it was a\ndisassembled mass of chitinous armor. Burl stopped, frowning\nportentously. He showed his quaking followers how to arm themselves. Dor\npicked up the horn hesitantly, Burl showing him how to use it. He\nstabbed out awkwardly with the sharp fragment of armor. Burl showed\nothers how to use the leg-sections for clubs. They tested them without\nconviction. In any sort of danger, they would trust to their legs and a\nfrantically effective gift for hiding.\n\nBurl snarled at his tribesmen and led them on. It was unprecedented. But\nbecause of that fact there was no precedent for rebellion. Burl led them\nin a curve. They glanced all about apprehensively.\n\nWhen they came to an unusually large and attractive clump of golden\nedible mushrooms, there were murmurings. Old Jon was inclined to go and\nload himself and retire to some hiding-place for as long as the food\nlasted. But Burl snarled again.\n\nNumbly they followed on--Dor and Jon and Jak and the two youngsters. The\nground inclined upward. They came upon puffballs. There was a new kind\nvisible, colored a lurid red, that did not grow like the others. It\nseemed to begin and expand underground, then thrust away the soil above\nin its development. Its taut, angry-red parchment envelope seemed to\nswell from a reservoir of subterranean material. Burl and the others had\nnever seen anything like it.\n\nThey climbed higher. As other edible mushrooms came into view Burl's\nfollowers cheered visibly. This was a new tribal ground anyhow and it\nhad not been fully explored. But Burl was leading them to quantities of\nfood they had never suspected before.\n\nQuaintly, it was Burl himself who began to feel an uncomfortable dryness\nin his throat. He knew what he was about. His followers did not suspect\nbecause to them what he intended was simply inconceivable. They couldn't\nsuspect it because they couldn't imagine anybody doing such a thing. It\nsimply couldn't be thought of at all.\n\nIt is rather likely that Burl began to regret that he had thought of it.\nIt had come to him first as an angry notion in the night. Then the idea\nhad developed as a suitable punishment for his abandonment. By dawn it\nwas an ambition so terrifying that it fascinated him. Now he was\ncommitted to it in his own mind, and the only way to keep his knees from\nknocking together was to keep moving. If his followers had protested\nnow, he would have allowed himself to be persuaded. But he heard more\npleased murmurs. There was more edible stuff, in quantity. But there\nwere no ant-trails here, no sounds of foraging beetles. This was an area\nwhich Burl's tribesmen could clearly see was almost devoid of dangerous\nlife. They seemed to brighten a little. This, they seemed to think,\nwould be a good place to move to.\n\nBut Burl knew better. There were few ground-insects here because the\narea was hunted out. And Burl knew what had done the hunting.\n\nHe expected the others to realize where they were when they dodged\naround a clump of the new red puffballs and saw bald rock before them\nand a falling-away to emptiness beyond. Even then they could have\nretreated, but it did not enter their heads that Burl could do anything\nlike this.\n\nThey didn't know where they were until Burl held up his hand for silence\nalmost at the edge of the rock-knob which rose a hundred feet sheer,\ncurving out a little near its top. They looked out uncomprehendingly at\nthe mist-filled air and the nightmare landscape fading into its\ngrayness. A tiny spider, the very youngest of hatchlings and barely four\ninches across, stealthily stalked another vastly smaller mite. The other\nwas the many-legged larva of the oil-beetle. The larva itself had been\ncalled--on other planets by other men--the bee-louse. It could easily\nhide in the thick furl of a giant bumble-bee. But this one small\ncreature never practiced that ability. The hatchling spider sprang and\nthe small midge died. When the spider had grown and, being grown, spun a\nweb, it would slay great crickets with the same insane ferocity.\n\nBurl's followers saw first this and then certain three-quarter-inch\nstrands of dirty silk that came up over the edge of the precipice. As\none man after another realized where he was, he trembled violently. Dor\nturned gray. Jon and Jak were paralyzed with horror. They couldn't run.\n\nSeeing the others even more frightened than himself filled Burl with a\nwholly unwarranted courage. When he opened his mouth, they cringed. If\nhe shouted then at least one, more likely several, of them would die.\n\nAnd this was because some forty or fifty feet down the mould-speckled\nprecipice hung a drab-white object nearly hemispherical, some six feet\nin its half-diameter. A number of little semi-circular doors were fixed\nabout its sides like arches. Though each one seemed to be a doorway,\nonly one would open.\n\nThe thing had been oddly beautiful at first glance. It was held fast to\nthe inward-sloping stone by cables, one or two of which stretched down\ntoward the ground. Others reached up over the precipice-edge to hold it\nfast. It was a most unusual engineering feat, yet something more than\nthat: this was also an ogre's castle. Ghastly trophies were fastened to\nthe outer walls and hung by silken cords below it. Here was the hind-leg\nof one of the smaller beetles, there the wing-case of a flying creature.\nHere a snail-shell--the snails of Earth would hardly have recognized\ntheir descendant--and there a boulder weighing forty pounds or more. The\nshrunken head-armor of a beetle, the fierce jaws of a cricket, the\npitiful shreds of dozens of creatures--all had once provided meals for\nthe monster in the castle. And dangling by the longest cord of all was\nthe shrunken, shriveled body of a long-dead man.\n\nBurl glared at his tribesmen, clamping his jaws tight lest they chatter.\nHe knew, as did the others, that any noise would bring the clotho spider\nswinging up its anchor-cables to the cliff-top. The men didn't dare\nmove. But every one of them--and Burl was among the foremost--knew that\ninside the half-dome of gruesome relics the monster reposed in luxury\nand ease. It had eight furry, attenuated legs and a face that was a mask\nof horror. The eyes glittered malevolently above needle-sharp mandibles.\nIt was a hunting-spider. At any moment it might leave the charnel-house\nin which it lived to stalk and pursue prey.\n\nBurl motioned the others forward. He led one of them to the end of a\ncable where it curled up over the edge for an anchorage. He ripped the\nend free--and his flesh crawled as he did so. He found a boulder and\nknotted the end of the cable about it. In a whisper that imitated a\nspider's ferocity, Burl gave the man orders. He plucked a second quaking\ntribesman by the arm. With the jerky, uncontrolled movements of a robot,\nDor allowed himself to be led to a second cable.\n\nBurl commanded in a frenzy. He worked with stiff fingers and a dry\nthroat, not knowing how he could do this thing. He had formed a plan in\nanger which he somehow was carrying out in a panic. Although his\nfollowers were as responsive as dead men, they obeyed him because they\nfelt like dead men, unable to resist. After all, it was simple enough.\nThere were boulders at the top of the precipice and silken cables hung\ntaut over the edge. As Burl fastened a heavy boulder to each cable he\ncould find, he loosened the silken strand until it hung tight only at\nthe very edge of the more-than-vertical fall.\n\nHe took his post--and his followers gazed at him with the despairing\neyes of zombies--and made a violent, urgent gesture. One man dumped his\nboulder over the precipice's edge. Burl cried out shrilly to the others,\nhalf-mad with his own terror. There was a ripping sound. The other men\ndumped their boulders over, fleeing with the movement--the paralysis of\nhorror relieved by that one bit of exertion.\n\nBurl could not flee. He panted and gasped, but he had to see. He stared\ndown the dizzy wall. Boulders ripped and tore their way down the\ncliff-wall, pulling the cables loose from the face of the precipice.\nThey shot out into space and jerked violently at the half-globular nest,\nripping it loose from its anchorage.\n\nBurl cried out exultantly. And as he cried out the shout became a\nbubbling sound; for although the ogre's silken castle did swing clear,\nit did not drop the sixty feet to the hard ground below. There was one\ncable Burl had missed, hidden by rock-tripe and mould in a depressed\npart of the cliff-top. The spider's house was dangling crazily by that\none strand, bobbing erratically to and fro in mid-air.\n\nAnd there was a convulsive struggle inside it. One of the arch-doors\nopened and the spider emerged. It was doubtless confused, but spiders\nsimply do not know terror. Their one response to the unusual is\nferocity. There was still one cable leading up the cliff-face--the\nthing's normal climbing-rope to its hunting-ground above. The spider\nleaped for this single cable. Its legs grasped the cord. It swarmed\nupward, poison fangs unsheathed, mandibles clashing in rage. The shaggy\nhair of its body seemed to bristle with insane ferocity. The skinny\narticulated legs fairly twinkled as it rose. It made slavering noises,\nunspeakably horrifying.\n\nBurl's followers were already in panic-stricken flight. He could hear\nthem crashing through obstacles as they ran glassy-eyed from the horror\nthey only imagined, but which Burl could not but encounter. Burl\nshivered, his body poised for equally frenzied but quite hopeless\nflight. But his first step was blocked. There was a boulder behind him,\nstanding on end, reaching up to his knee. He could not take the first\nstep without dodging it.\n\nIt was not the Burl of the terror-filled childhood who acted then. It\nwas the throw-back, the atavism to a bolder ancestry. While the Burl who\nwas a product of his environment was able to know only the stunned\nsensations of purest panic, the other Burl acted on a sounder basis of\ndesperation. The emerging normal human seized the upright boulder. He\nstaggered to the rock-face with it. He dumped it down the line of the\ndescending cable.\n\nHumans do have ancestral behavior-patterns built into their nervous\nsystems. A frightened small child does not flee; it swarms up the\nnearest adult to be carried away from danger. At ten a child does not\nclimb but runs. And there is an age when it is normal for a man to stand\nat bay. This last instinct can be conditioned away. In Burl's fellows\nand his immediate forbears it had been. But things had happened to Burl\nto break that conditioning.\n\nHe flung the pointed boulder down. For the fraction of a second he heard\nonly the bubbling, gnashing sounds the spider made as it climbed toward\nhim. Then there was a quite indescribable cushioned impact. After that,\nthere were seconds in which Burl heard nothing whatever--and then a\nnoise which could not be described either, but was the impact of the\nspider's body on the ground a hundred feet below, together with the\npointed boulder it had fought insanely during all its fall. And the\nboulder was on top. The noise was sickening.\n\nBurl found himself shaking all over. His every muscle was tense and\nstrained. But the spider did not crawl over the edge of the precipice\nand something had hit far below.\n\nA long minute later he managed to look.\n\nThe nest still dangled at the end of the single cable, festooned with\nits gruesome trophies. But Burl saw the spider. It was, of course,\ncharacteristically tenacious of life. Its legs writhed and kicked, but\nthe body was crushed and mangled.\n\nAs Burl stared down, trying to breathe again, an ant drew near the\nshattered creature. It stridulated. Other ants came. They hovered\nrestlessly at the edge of the death-scene. One loathesome leg did not\nquiver. An ant moved in on it.\n\nThe ants began to tear the dead spider apart, carrying its fragments to\ntheir city a mile away.\n\nUp on the cliff-top Burl got unsteadily to his feet and found that he\ncould breathe. He was drenched in sweat, but the shock of triumph was as\noverwhelming as any of the terrors felt by ancestors on this planet.\n\nOn no other planet in the Galaxy could any human experience such triumph\nas Burl felt now because never before had human beings been so\ncompletely subjugated by their environment. On no other planet had such\nan environment existed, with humans flung so helplessly upon its mercy.\n\nBurl had been normal among his fellows when he was as frightened and\nfurtive as they. Now he had been given shock treatment by fate. He was\nvery close to normal for a human being newly come to the forgotten\nplanet, save that he had the detailed information which would enable a\nnormal man to cope with the nightmare environment. What he lacked now\nwas the habit.\n\nBut it would be intolerable for him to return to his former state of\nmind.\n\nHe walked almost thoughtfully after his fled followers. And he was\nstill a savage in that he was remarkably matter-of-fact. He paused to\nbreak off a huge piece of the edible golden mushrooms his fellow-men had\nnoticed on the way up. Lugging it easily, he went back down over the\nground that had looked so astonishingly free of inimical life--which it\nwas because of the spider that had used it as a hunting-preserve.\n\nBurl began to see that it was not satisfactory to be one of a tribe of\nmen who ran away all the time. If one man with a spear or stone could\nkill spiders, it was ridiculous for half a dozen men to run away and\nleave that one man the job alone. It made the job harder.\n\nIt occurred to Burl that he had killed ants without thinking too much\nabout it, but nobody else had. Individual ants could be killed. If he\ngot his followers to kill foot-long ants, they might in time battle the\nsmaller, two-foot beetles. If they came to dare so much, they might\nattack greater creatures and ultimately attempt to resist the real\npredators.\n\nNot clearly but very dimly, the Burl who had been shocked back to the\nviewpoint which was normal to the race of men saw that human beings\ncould be more than the fugitive vermin on which other creatures preyed.\nIt was not easy to envision, but he found it impossible to imagine\nsinking back to his former state. As a practical matter, if he was to\nremain as leader his tribesmen would have to change.\n\nIt was a long time before he reached the neighborhood of the\nhiding-place of which he had not been told the night before. He sniffed\nand listened. Presently he heard faint, murmurous noises. He traced\nthem, hearing clearly the sound of hushed weeping and excited, timid\nchattering. He heard old Tama shrilly bewailing fate and the stupidity\nof Burl in getting himself killed.\n\nHe pushed boldly through the toadstool-growth and found his tribe all\ngathered together and trembling. They were shaken. They chattered\ntogether--not discussing or planning, but nervously recalling the\nterrifying experience they had gone through.\n\nBurl stepped through the screen of fungi and men gaped at him. Then they\nleaped up to flee, thinking he might be pursued. Tet and Dik babbled\nshrilly. Burl cuffed them. It was an excellent thing for him to do. No\nman had struck another man in Burl's memory. Cuffings were reserved for\nchildren. But Burl cuffed the men who had fled from the cliff-edge. And\nbecause they had not been through Burl's experiences, they took the\ncuffings like children.\n\nHe took Jon and Jak by the ear and heaved them out of the hiding-place.\nHe followed them, and then drove them to where they could see the base\nof the cliff from whose top they had tumbled stones--and then run away.\nHe showed them the carcass of the spider, now being carted away\npiecemeal by ants. He told them angrily how it had been killed.\n\nThey looked at him fearfully.\n\nHe was exasperated. He scowled at them. And then he saw them shifting\nuneasily. There were clickings. A single, foraging black ant--rather\nlarge, quite sixteen inches long--moved into view. It seemed to be\nwandering purposelessly, but was actually seeking carrion to take back\nto its fellows. It moved toward the men. They were alive, therefore, it\ndid not think of them as food--though it could regard them as enemies.\n\nBurl moved forward and struck with his club. It was butchery. It was\nunprecedented. When the creature lay still he commanded one of his typo\nfor followers to take it up. Inside its armored legs there would be\nmeat. He mentioned the fact, pungently. Their faces expressed amazed\nwonderment.\n\nThere was another clicking. Another solitary ant. Burl handed his club\nto Dor, pushing him forward. Dor hesitated. Though he was not afraid of\none wandering ant, he held back uneasily. Burl barked at him.\n\nDor struck clumsily and botched the job. Burl had to use his spear to\nfinish it. But a second bit of prey lay before the men.\n\nThen, quite suddenly, this completely unprecedented form of foraging\nbecame understandable to Burl's followers. Jak giggled nervously.\n\nAn hour later Burl led them back to the tribe's hiding-place. The others\nhad been terror-stricken, not knowing where the men had gone. But their\nterror changed to mute amazement when the men carried huge quantities of\nmeat and edible mushroom into the hiding-place. The tribe held what\namounted to a banquet.\n\nDik and Tet swaggered under a burden of ant-carcass. This was not, of\ncourse, in any way revolting. Back on Earth, even thousands of years\nbefore, Arabs had eaten locusts cooked in butter and salted. All men had\neaten crabs and other crustaceans, whose feeding habits were similar to\nthose of ants. If Burl and his tribesmen had thought to be fastidious,\nants on the forgotten planet would still have been considered edible,\nsince they had not lost the habits of extreme cleanliness which made\nthem notable on Earth.\n\nThis feast of all the tribe, in which men had brought back not only\nmushroom to be eaten, but actual prey--small prey--of their hunting, was\nvery probably the first such occasion in at least thirty generations of\nthe forty-odd since the planet's unintended colonization. Like the other\nevents, which began with Burl trying to spear a fish with a\nrhinoceros-beetle's horn, it was not only novel, on that world, but\nwould in time have almost incredibly far-reaching consequences. Perhaps\nthe most significant thing about it was its timing. It came at very\nnearly the latest instant at which it could have done any good.\n\nThere was a reason which nobody in the tribe would ever remember to\nassociate with the significance of this banquet. A long time\nbefore--months in terms of Earth-time--there had been a strong breeze\nthat blew for three days and nights. It was an extremely unusual\nwindstorm. It had seemed the stranger, then, because during all its\nduration everyone in the tribe had been sick, suffering continuously.\nWhen the windstorm had ended, the suffering ceased. A long time passed\nand nobody remembered it any longer.\n\nThere was no reason why they should. Yet, since that time there had been\na new kind of thing growing among the innumerable moulds and rusts and\ntoadstools of the lowlands. Burl had seen them on his travels, and the\nexpeditionary force against the clotho spider had seen them on the\njourney up to the cliff-edge. Red puffballs, developing first\nunderground, were now pushing the soil aside to expose taut, crimson\nparchment spheres to the open air. The tribesmen left them alone because\nthey were strange; and strange things were always dangerous. Puffballs\nthey were familiar with--big, misshapen things which shot at a touch a\npowder into the air. The particles of powder were spores--the seed from\nwhich they grew. Spores had remained infinitely small even on the\nforgotten planet where fungi grew huge. Only their capacity for growth\nhad increased. The red growths were puffballs, but of a new and\ndifferent kind.\n\nAs the tribe ate and admired, the hunters boasting of their courage, one\nof the new red mushrooms reached maturity.\n\nThis particular growing thing was perhaps two feet across, its main part\nspherical. Almost eighteen inches of the thing rose above-ground. A\ntawny and menacing red, the sphere was contained in a parchment-like\nskin that was pulled taut. There was internal tension. But the skin was\ntough and would not yield, yet the inexorable pressure of life within\ndemanded that it stretch. It was growing within, but the skin without\nhad ceased to grow.\n\nThis one happened to be on a low hillside a good half-mile from the\nplace where Burl and his fellows banqueted. Its tough, red parchment\nskin was tensed unendurably. Suddenly it ripped apart with an explosive\ntearing noise. The dry spores within billowed out and up like the smoke\nof a shell-explosion, spurting skyward for twenty feet and more. At the\ntop of their ascent they spread out and eddied like a cloud of reddish\nsmoke. They hung in the air. They drifted in the sluggish breeze. They\nspread as they floated, forming a gradually extending, descending\ndust-cloud in the humid air.\n\nA bee, flying back toward its hive, droned into the thin mass of dust.\nIt was preoccupied. The dust-cloud was not opaque, but only a thick\nhaze. The bee flew into it.\n\nFor half a dozen wing-beats nothing happened. Then the bee veered\nsharply. Its deep-toned humming rose in pitch. It made convulsive\nmovements in mid-air. It lost balance and crashed heavily to the ground.\nThere its legs kicked and heaved violently but without purpose. The\nwings beat furiously but without rhythm or effect. Its body bent in\nparoxysmic flexings. It stung blindly at nothing.\n\nAfter a little while the bee died. Like all insects, bees breathe\nthrough spiracles--breathing-holes in their abdomens. This bee had flown\ninto the cloud of red dust which was the spore-cloud of the new\nmushrooms.\n\nThe cloud drifted slowly along over the surface of yeasts and moulds,\nover toadstools and variegated fungus monstrosities. It moved steadily\nover a group of ants at work upon some bit of edible stuff. They were\nseized with an affliction like that of the bee. They writhed, moved\nconvulsively. Their legs thrashed about. They died.\n\nThe cloud of red dust settled as it moved. By the time it had travelled\na quarter-mile, it had almost all settled to the ground.\n\nBut a half-mile away there was another skyward-spurting uprush of red\ndust which spread slowly with the breeze. A quarter-mile away another\nplumed into the air. Farther on, two of them spouted their spores toward\nthe clouds almost together.\n\nLiving things that breathed the red dust writhed and died. And the\nred-dust puffballs were scattered everywhere.\n\nBurl and his tribesmen feasted, chattering in hushed tones of the\nremarkable fact that men ate meat of their own killing.\n\n\n\n\n_6. RED DUST_\n\n\nIt was very fortunate indeed that the feast took place when it did. Two\ndays later it would probably have been impossible, and three days later\nit would have been too late to do any good. But coming when it did, it\nmade the difference which was all the difference in the world.\n\nOnly thirty hours after the feasting which followed the death of the\nclotho spider, Burl's fellows--from Jon to Dor to Tet and Dik and\nSaya--had come to know a numb despair which the other creatures of his\nworld were simply a bit too stupid to achieve.\n\nIt was night. There was darkness over all the lowlands, and over all the\narea of perhaps a hundred square miles which the humans of Burl's\nacquaintance really knew. He, alone of his tribe, had been as much as\nforty miles from the foraging-ground over which they wandered. At any\ngiven time the tribe clung together for comfort, venturing only as far\nas was necessary to find food. Although the planet possessed continents,\nthey knew less than a good-sized county of it. The planet owned oceans,\nand they knew only small brooks and one river which, where they knew it,\nwas assuredly less than two hundred yards across. And they faced stark\ndisaster that was not strictly a local one, but beyond their experience\nand hopelessly beyond their ability to face.\n\nThey were superior to the insects about them only in the fact they\nrealized what was threatening them.\n\nThe disaster was the red puffballs.\n\nBut it was night. The soft, blanketing darkness of a cloud-wrapped world\nlay all about. Burl sat awake, wrapped in his magnificent velvet cloak,\nhis spear beside him and the yard-long golden plumes of a moth's\nantennae bound to his forehead for a headdress. About him and his\ntribesmen were the swollen shapes of fungi, hiding the few things that\ncould be seen in darkness. From the low-hanging clouds the nightly rain\ndripped down. Now a drop and then another drop; slowly, deliberately,\npersistently moisture fell from the skies.\n\nThere was other sounds. Things flew through the blackness\noverhead--moths with mighty wing-beats that sometimes sent rhythmic\nwind-stirrings down to the tribe in its hiding-place. There were the\ndeep pulsations of sound made by night-beetles aloft. There were the\nharsh noises of grasshoppers--they were rare--senselessly advertising\ntheir existence to nearby predators. Not too far from where Burl brooded\ncame bright chirrupings where relatively small beetles roamed among the\nmushroom-forests, singing cheerfully in deep bass voices. They were\nsearching for the underground tidbits which took the place of truffles\ntheir ancestors had lived on back on Earth.\n\nAll seemed to be as it had been since the first humans were cast away\nupon this planet. And at night, indeed, the new danger subsided. The red\npuffballs did not burst after sunset. Burl sat awake, brooding in a new\nsort of frustration. He and all his tribe were plainly doomed--yet Burl\nhad experienced too many satisfying sensations lately to be willing to\naccept the fact.\n\nThe new red growths were everywhere. Months ago a storm-wind blew while\nsomewhere, not too far distant, other red puffballs were bursting and\nsending their spores into the air. Since it was only a windstorm, there\nwas no rain to wash the air clean of the lethal dust. The new kind of\npuffball--but perhaps it was not new: it could have thriven for\nthousands of years where it was first thrown as a sport from a\ngenetically unstable parent--the new kind of puffball would not normally\nbe spread in this fashion. By chance it had.\n\nThere were dozens of the things within a quarter-mile, hundreds within a\nmile, and thousands upon thousands within the area the tribe normally\nforaged in. Burl had seen them even forty miles away, as yet immature.\nThey would be deadly at one period alone--the time of their bursting.\nBut there were limitations even to the deadliness of the red puffballs,\nthough Burl had not yet discovered the fact. But as of now, they doomed\nthe tribe.\n\nOne woman panted and moaned in her exhausted sleep, a little way from\nwhere Burl tried to solve the problem presented by the tribe. Nobody\nelse attempted to think it out. The others accepted doom with fatalistic\nhopelessness. Burl's leadership might mean extra food, but nothing could\ncounter the doom awaiting them--so their thoughts seemed to run.\n\nBut Burl doggedly reviewed the facts in the darkness, while the humans\nabout him slept the sleep of those without hope and even without\nrebellion. There had been many burstings of the crimson puffballs. As\nmany as four and five of the deadly dust-clouds had been seen spouting\ninto the air at the same time. A small boy of the tribe had breathlessly\ntold of seeing a hunting-spider killed by the red dust. Lana, the\nhalf-grown girl, had come upon one of the gigantic rhinoceros-beetles\nbelly-up on the ground, already the prey of ants. She had snatched a\nhuge, meat-filled joint and run away, faster than the ants could follow.\nA far-ranging man had seen a butterfly, with wings ten yards across, die\nin a dust-cloud. Another woman--Cori--had been nearby when a red cloud\nsettled slowly over long, solid lines of black worker-ants bound on some\nunknown mission. Later she saw other workers carrying the dead bodies\nback to the ant-city to be used for food.\n\nBurl still sat wakeful and frustrated and enraged as the slow rain fell\nupon the toadstools that formed the tribe's lurking-place. He doggedly\nwent over and over the problem. There were innumerable red puffballs.\nSome had burst. The others undoubtedly would burst. Anything that\nbreathed the red dust died. With thousands of the puffballs around them\nit was unthinkable that any human in this place could escape breathing\nthe red dust and dying. But it had not always been so. There had been a\ntime when there were no red puffballs here.\n\nBurl's eyes moved restlessly over the sleeping forms limned by a patch\nof fox-fire. The feathery plumes rising from his head were outlined\nsoftly by the phosphorescence. His face was lined with a frown as he\ntried to think his own and his fellows' way out of the predicament.\nWithout realizing it, Burl had taken it upon himself to think for his\ntribe. He had no reason to. It was simply a natural thing for him to do\nso, now that he had learned to think--even though his efforts were crude\nand painful as yet.\n\nSaya woke with a start and stared about. There had been no\nalarm,--merely the usual noises of distant murders and the songs of\nsingers in the night. Burl moved restlessly. Saya stood up quietly, her\nlong hair flowing about her. Sleepy-eyed, she moved to be near Burl. She\nsank to the ground beside him, sitting up--because the hiding-place was\ncrowded and small--and dozed fitfully. Presently her head drooped to one\nside. It rested against his shoulder. She slept again.\n\nThis simple act may have been the catalyst which gave Burl the solution\nto the problem. Some few days before, Burl had been in a far-away place\nwhere there was much food. At the time he'd thought vaguely of finding\nSaya and bringing her to that place. He remembered now that the red\npuffballs flourished there as well as here--but there had been other\ndangers in between, so the only half-formed purpose had been abandoned.\nNow, though, with Saya's head resting against his shoulder, he\nremembered the plan. And then the stroke of genius took place.\n\nHe formed the idea of a journey which was not a going-after-food. This\npresent dwelling-place of the tribe had been free of red puffballs until\nonly recently. There must be other places where there were no red\npuffballs. He would take Saya and his tribesmen to such a place.\n\nIt was really genius. The people of Burl's tribe had no purposes, only\nneeds--for food and the like. Burl had achieved abstract thought--which\npreviously had not been useful on the forgotten planet and, therefore,\nnot practised. But it was time for humankind to take a more fitting\nplace in the unbalanced ecological system of this nightmare world, time\nto change that unbalance in favor of humans.\n\nWhen dawn came, Burl had not slept at all. He was all authority and\ndecision. He had made plans.\n\nHe spoke sternly, loudly--which frightened people conditioned to be\nfurtive--holding up his spear as he issued commands. His timid\ntribesfolk obeyed him meekly. They felt no loyalty to him or confidence\nin his decisions yet, but they were beginning to associate obedience to\nhim with good things. Food, for one.\n\nBefore the day fully came, they made loads of the remaining edible\nmushroom and uneaten meat. It was remarkable for humans to leave their\nhiding-place while they still had food to eat, but Burl was implacable\nand scowling. Three men bore spears at Burl's urging. He brandished his\nlong shaft confidently as he persuaded the other three to carry clubs.\nThey did so reluctantly, even though previously they had killed ants\nwith clubs. Spears, they felt, would have been better. They wouldn't be\nso close to the prey then.\n\nThe sky became gray over all its expanse. The indefinite bright area\nwhich marked the position of the sun became established. It was part-way\ntoward the center of the sky when the journey began. Burl had, of\ncourse, no determined course, only a destination--safety. He had been\ncarried south, in his misadventure on the river. There were red\npuffballs to southward, therefore he ruled out that direction. He could\nhave chosen the east and come upon an ocean, but no safety from the red\nspore-dust. Or he could have chosen the north. It was pure chance that\nhe headed west.\n\nHe walked confidently through the gruesome world of the lowlands,\nholding his spear in a semblance of readiness. Clad as he was, he made a\nfigure at once valiant and rather pathetic. It was not too sensible for\none young man--even one who had killed two spiders--to essay leading a\ntiny tribe of fearful folk across a land of monstrous ferocity and\nincredible malignance, armed only with a spear from a dead insect's\narmor. It was absurd to dress up for the enterprise in a velvety cloak\nmade of a moth's wing, blue moth-fur for a loin-cloth, and merely\nbeautiful golden plumes bobbing above his forehead.\n\nProbably, though, that gorgeousness had a good effect upon his\nfollowers. They surely could not reassure each other by their numbers!\nThere was a woman with a baby in her arms--Cori. Three children of nine\nor ten, unable to resist the instinct to play even on so perilous a\njourney, ate almost constantly of the lumps of foodstuff they had been\nordered to carry. After them came Dik, a long-legged adolescent boy with\neyes that roved anxiously about. Behind him were two men. Dor with a\nshort spear and Jak hefting a club, both of them badly frightened at the\nidea of fleeing from dangers they knew and were terrified by, to other\ndangers unknown and, consequently, more to be feared. The others trailed\nafter them. Tet was rear-guard. Burl had separated the pair of boys to\nmake them useful. Together they were worthless.\n\nIt was a pathetic caravan, in a way. In all the rest of the Galaxy, man\nwas the dominant creature. There was no other planet from one rim to the\nother where men did not build their cities or settlements with\nunconscious arrogance--completely disregarding the wishes of lesser\nthings. Only on this planet did men hide from danger rather than destroy\nit. Only here could men be driven from their place by lower life-forms.\nAnd only here would a migration be made on foot, with men's eyes\nfearful, their bodies poised to flee at sight of something stronger and\nmore deadly than themselves.\n\nThey marched, straggling a little, with many waverings aside from a\nfixed line. Once Dik saw the trap-door of a trapdoor-spider's lair. They\nhalted, trembling, and went a long way out of their intended path to\navoid it. Once they saw a great praying-mantis a good half-mile off, and\nagain they deviated from their proper route.\n\nNear midday their way was blocked. As they moved onward, a great,\nhigh-pitched sound could be heard ahead of them. Burl stopped; his face\ngrew pinched. But it was only a stridulation, not the cries of creatures\nbeing devoured. It was a horde of ants by the thousands and hundreds of\nthousands, and nothing else.\n\nBurl went ahead to scout. And he did it because he did not trust anybody\nelse to have the courage or intelligence to return with a report,\ninstead of simply running away if the news were bad. But it happened to\nbe a sort of action which would help to establish his position as leader\nof his tribe.\n\nBurl moved forward cautiously and presently came to an elevation from\nwhich he could see the cause of the tremendous waves of sound that\nspread out in all directions from the level plain before him. He waved\nto his followers to join him, and stood looking down at the\nextraordinary sight.\n\nWhen they reached his side--and Saya was first--the spectacle had not\ndiminished. For quite half a mile in either direction the earth was\nblack with ants. It was a battle of opposing armies from rival\nant-cities. They snapped and bit at each other. Locked in vise-like\nembraces, they rolled over and over upon the ground, trampled underfoot\nby hordes of their fellows who surged over them to engage in equally\nsuicidal combat. There was, of course, no thought of surrender or of\nquarter. They fought by thousands of pairs, their jaws seeking to crush\neach other's armor, snapping at each other's antennae, biting at each\nother's eyes....\n\nThe noise was not like that of army-ants. This was the agonizing sound\nof ants being dismembered while still alive. Some of the creatures had\nonly one or two or three legs left, yet struggled fiercely to entangle\nanother enemy before they died. There were mad cripples, fighting\ninsanely with head and thorax only, their abdomens sheared away. The\nwhining battle-cry of the multitude made a deafening uproar.\n\nFrom either side of the battleground a wide path led back toward\nseparate ant-cities which were invisible from Burl's position. These\nhighways were marked by hurrying groups of ants--reinforcements rushing\nto the fight. Compared to the other creatures of this world the ants\nwere small, but no lumbering beetle dared to march insolently in their\nway, nor did any carnivores try to prey upon them. They were dangerous.\nBurl and his tribesfolk were the only living things remaining near the\nbattle-field--with one single exception.\n\nThat exception was itself a tribe of ants, vastly less in number than\nthe fighting creatures, and greatly smaller in size as well. Where the\ncombatants were from a foot to fourteen inches long, these guerilla-ants\nwere no more than the third of a foot in length. They hovered\nindustriously at the edge of the fighting, not as allies to either\nnation, but strictly on their own account. Scurrying among the larger,\nfighting ants with marvelous agility, they carried off piecemeal the\nbodies of the dead and valiantly slew the more gravely wounded for the\nsame purpose.\n\nThey swarmed over the fighting-ground whenever the tide of battle\nreceded. Caring nothing for the origin of the quarrel and espousing\nneither side, these opportunists busily salvaged the dead and\nstill-living debris of the battle for their own purposes.\n\nBurl and his followers were forced to make a two-mile detour to avoid\nthe battle. The passage between bodies of scurrying reinforcements was a\nmatter of some difficulty. Burl hurried the others past a route to the\nfront, reeking of formic acid, over which endless regiments and\ncompanies of ants moved frantically to join in the fight. They were\nintensely excited. Antennae waving wildly, they rushed to the front and\ninstantly flung themselves into the fray, becoming lost and\nindistinguishable in the black mass of fighting creatures.\n\nThe humans passed precariously between two hurrying battalions--Dik and\nTet pausing briefly to burden themselves with prey--and hurried on to\nleave as many miles as possible behind them before nightfall. They never\nknew any more about the battle. It could have started over anything at\nall--two ants from the different cities may have disputed some tiny bit\nof carrion and soon been reinforced by companions until the military\nmight of both cities was engaged. Once it had started, of course, the\nfighters knew whom to fight if not why they did so. The inhabitants of\nthe two cities had different smells, which served them as uniforms.\n\nBut the outcome of the war would hardly matter. Not to the fighters,\ncertainly. There were many red mushrooms in this area. If either of the\ncities survived at all, it would be because its nursery-workers lived\nupon stored food as they tended the grubs until the time of the spouting\nred dust had ended.\n\nBurl's folk saw many of the red puffballs burst during the day. More\nthan once they came upon empty, flaccid parchment sacs. More often still\nthey came upon red puffballs not yet quite ready to emit their murderous\nseed.\n\nThat first night the tribe hid among the bases of giant puffballs of a\nmore familiar sort. When touched they would shoot out a puff of white\npowder resembling smoke. The powder was harmless fortunately and the\ntribe knew that fact. Although not toxic, the white powder was identical\nin every other way to the terrible red dust from which the tribe fled.\n\nThat night Burl slept soundly. He had been without rest for two days and\na night. And he was experienced in journeying to remote places. He knew\nthat they were no more dangerous than familiar ones. But the rest of the\ntribe, and even Saya, were fearful and terrified. They waited timorously\nall through the dark hours for menacing sounds to crash suddenly through\nthe steady dripping of the nightly rain around them.\n\nThe second day's journey was not unlike the first. The following day,\nthey came upon a full ten-acre patch of giant cabbages bigger than a\nfamily dwelling. Something in the soil, perhaps, favored vegetation over\nfungi. The dozens of monstrous vegetables were the setting for riotous\nlife: great slugs ate endlessly of the huge green leaves--and things\npreyed on them; bees came droning to gather the pollen of the flowers.\nAnd other things came to prey on the predators in their turn.\n\nThere was one great cabbage somewhat separate from the rest. After a\nlong examination of the scene, Burl daringly led quaking Jon and Jak to\nthe attack. Dor splendidly attacked elsewhere, alone. When the tribe\nmoved on, there was much meat, and everyone--even the children--wore\nloin-cloths of incredibly luxurious fur.\n\nThere were perils, too. On the fifth day of the tribe's journey Burl\nsuddenly froze into stillness. One of the hairy tarantulas which lived\nin burrows with a concealed trap-door at ground-level, had fallen upon a\nscarabeus beetle and was devouring it only a hundred yards ahead. The\ntribesfolk trembled as Burl led them silently back and around by a safe\ndetour.\n\nBut all these experiences were beginning to have an effect. It was\nbecoming a matter of course that Burl should give orders which others\nshould obey. It was even becoming matter-of-fact that the possession of\nfood was not a beautiful excuse to hide from all danger, eating and\ndozing until all the food was gone. Very gradually the tribe was\ndeveloping the notion that the purpose of existence was not solely to\nescape awareness of peril, but to foresee and avoid it. They had no\nclear-cut notion of purpose as yet. They were simply outgrowing\npurposelessness. After a time they even looked about them with, dim\nstirrings of an attitude other than a desperate alertness for danger.\n\nHumans from any other planet, surely, would have been astounded at the\nvistas of golden mushrooms stretching out in forests on either hand and\nthe plains with flaking surfaces given every imaginable color by the\nmoulds and rusts and tiny flowering yeasts growing upon them. They would\nhave been amazed by the turgid pools the journeying tribe came upon,\nwhere the water was concealed by a thick layer of slime through which\nenormous bubbles of foul-smelling gas rose to enlarge to preposterous\nsize before bursting abruptly.\n\nHad they been as ill-armed as Burl's folk, though, visitors from other\nplanets would have been at least as timorous. Lacking highly specialized\nknowledge of the ways of insects on this world even well-armed visitors\nwould have been in greater danger.\n\nBut the tribe went on without a single casualty. They had fleeting\nglimpses of the white spokes of symmetrical spider-webs whose least\nthread no member of the tribe could break.\n\nTheir immunity from disaster--though in the midst of danger--gave them a\ncertain all-too-human concentration upon discomfort. Lacking calamities,\nthey noticed their discomforts and grew weary of continual traveling. A\nfew of the men complained to Burl.\n\nFor answer, he pointed back along the way they had come. To the right a\nreddish dust-cloud was just settling, and to the rear rose another as\nthey looked.\n\nAnd on this day a thing happened which at once gave the complainers the\nrest they asked for, and proved the fatality of remaining where they\nwere. A child ran aside from the path its elders were following. The\nground here had taken on a brownish hue. As the child stirred up the\nsurface mould with his feet, dust that had settled was raised up again.\nIt was far too thin to have any visible color. But the child suddenly\nscreamed, strangling. The mother ran frantically to snatch him up.\n\nThe red dust was no less deadly merely because it had settled to the\nground. If a storm-wind came now--but they were infrequent under the\nforgotten planet's heavy bank of clouds--the fallen red dust could be\nraised up again and scattered about until there would be no living thing\nanywhere which would not gasp and writhe--and die.\n\nBut the child would not die. He would suffer terribly and be weak for\ndays. In the morning he could be carried.\n\nWhen night began to darken the sky, the tribe searched for a\nhiding-place. They came upon a shelf-like cliff, perhaps twenty or\nthirty feet high, slanting toward the line of the tribesmen's travel.\nBurl saw black spots in it--openings. Burrows. He watched them as the\ntribe drew near. No bees or wasps went in or out. He watched long enough\nto be sure.\n\nWhen they were close, he was certain. Ordering the others to wait, he\nwent forward to make doubly sure. The appearance of the holes reassured\nhim. Dug months before by mining-bees, gone or dead now, the entrances\nto the burrows were weathered and bedraggled. Burl explored, first\nsniffing carefully at each opening. They were empty. This would be\nshelter for the night. He called his followers, and they crawled into\nthe three-foot tunnels to hide.\n\nBurl stationed himself near the outer edge of one of them to watch for\nsigns of danger. Night had not quite fallen. Jon and Dor, hungry, went\noff to forage a little way beyond the cliff. They would be cautious and\ntimid, taking no risks whatever.\n\nBurl waited for the return of his explorers. Meanwhile he fretted over\nthe meaning of the stricken child. Stirred-up red dust was dangerous.\nThe only time when there would be no peril from it would be at night,\nwhen the dripping rainfall of the dark hours turned the surface of this\nworld into thin shine. It occurred to Burl that it would be safe to\ntravel at night, so far as the red dust was concerned. He rejected the\nidea instantly. It was unthinkable to travel at night for innumerable\nother reasons.\n\nFrowning, he poked his spear idly at a tumbled mass of tiny parchment\ncup-like things near the entrance of a cave. And instantly movement\nbecame visible. Fifty, sixty, a hundred infinitesimal creatures, no more\nthan half an inch in length, made haste to hide themselves among the\nthimble-sized paperlike cups. They moved with extraordinary clumsiness\nand immense effort, seemingly only by contortions of their\ngreenish-black bodies. Burl had never seen any creature progress in such\na slow and ineffective fashion. He drew one of the small creatures back\nwith the point of his spear and examined it from a safe distance.\n\nHe picked it up on his spear and brought it close to his eyes. The thing\nredoubled its frenzied movements. It slipped off the spear and plopped\nupon the soft moth-fur he wore about his middle. Instantly, as if it\nwere a conjuring-trick, the insect vanished. Burl searched for minutes\nbefore he found it hidden deep in the long, soft hairs of his garment,\nresting motionless and seemingly at ease.\n\nIt was the larval form of a beetle, fragments of whose armor could be\nseen near the base of the clayey cliffside. Hidden in the remnants of\nits egg-casings, the brood of minute things had waited near the opening\nof the mining-bee tunnel. It was their gamble with destiny when\nmining-bee grubs had slept through metamorphosis and come uncertainly\nout of the tunnel for the first time, that some or many of the larvae\nmight snatch the instant's chance to fasten to the bees' legs and writhe\nupward to an anchorage in their fur. It happened that this particular\nbatch of eggs had been laid after the emergence of the grubs. They had\nno possible chance of fulfilling their intended role as parasites on\ninsects of the order hymenoptera. They were simply and matter-of-factly\ndoomed by the blindness of instinct, which had caused them to be placed\nwhere they could not possibly survive.\n\nOn the other hand, if one or many of them had found a lurking-place, the\noffspring of their host would have been doomed. The place filled by\noil-beetle larvae in the scheme of things is the place--or one of the\nplaces--reserved for creatures that limit the number of mining-bees.\nWhen a bee-louse-infested mining-bee has made a new tunnel, stocked it\nwith honey for its young, and then laid one egg to float on that pool of\nnourishment and hatch and feed and ultimately grow to be another\nmining-bee--at that moment of egg-laying, one small bee-louse detaches\nitself. It remains zestfully in the provisioned cell to devour the egg\nfor which the provisions were accumulated. It happily consumes those\nprovisions and, in time, an oil-beetle crawls out of the tunnel a\nmining-bee so laboriously prepared.\n\nBurl had no difficulty in detaching the small insect and casting it\naway, but in doing so he discovered that others had hidden themselves in\nhis fur without his knowledge. He plucked them away and found more.\nWhile savages can be highly tolerant of vermin too small to be seen,\nthey feel a peculiar revolt against serving as host to creatures of\nsensible size. Burl reacted violently--as once he had reacted to the\ndiscovery of a leech clinging to his heel. He jerked off his loin-cloth\nand beat it savagely with his spear.\n\nWhen it was clean, he still felt a wholly unreasonable sense of\nhumiliation. It was not clearly thought out, of course. Burl feared huge\ninsects too much to hate them. But that small creatures should fasten\nupon him produced a completely irrational feeling of outrage. For the\nfirst time in very many years or centuries a human being upon the\nforgotten planet felt that he had been insulted. His dignity had been\nassailed. Burl raged.\n\nBut as he raged, a triumphant shout came from nearby. Jon and Dor were\nreturning from their foraging, loaded down with edible mushroom. They,\nalso, had taken a step upward toward the natural dignity of men. They\nhad so far forgotten their terror as to shout in exultation at their\nfind of food. Up to now, Burl had been the only man daring to shout. Now\nthere were two others.\n\nIn his overwrought state this was also enraging. The result of hurt\nvanity on two counts was jealousy, and the result of jealousy was a\ncrazy foolhardiness. Burl ground his teeth and insanely resolved to do\nsomething so magnificent, so tremendous, so utterly breathtaking that\nthere could be no possible imitation by anybody else. His thinking was\nnot especially clear. Part of his motivation had been provided by the\noil-beetle larvae. He glared about him at the deepening dusk, seeking\nsome exploit, some glamorous feat, to perform immediately, even in the\nnight.\n\nHe found one.\n\n\n\n\n_7. JOURNEY THROUGH DEATH_\n\n\nIt was late dusk and the reddened clouds overhead were deepening\nsteadily toward black. Dark shadows hung everywhere. The clay cliff cut\noff all vision to one side, but elsewhere Burl could see outward until\nthe graying haze blotted out the horizon. Here and there, bees droned\nhomeward to hive or burrow. Sometimes a slender, graceful wasp passed\noverhead, its wings invisible by the swiftness of their vibration.\n\nA few butterflies lingered hungrily in the distance, seeking the few\nthings they could still feast upon. No moth had wakened yet to the\nnight. The cloud-bank grew more sombre. The haze seemed to close in and\nshrink the world that Burl could see.\n\nHe watched, raging, for the sight that would provide him with the\ntriumph to end all triumphs among his followers. The soft, down-reaching\nfingers of the night touched here and there and the day ended at those\nspots. Then, from the heart of the deep redness to the west a flying\ncreature came. It was a beautiful thing--a yellow emperor\nbutterfly--flapping eastward with great sail-like velvet wings that\nseemed black against the sunset. Burl saw it sweep across the incredible\nsky, alight delicately, and disappear behind a mass of toadstools\nclustered so thickly they seemed nearly a hillock and not a mass of\ngrowing things.\n\nThen darkness closed in completely, but Burl still stared where the\nyellow emperor had landed. There was that temporary, utter quiet when\nday-things were hidden and night-things had not yet ventured out.\nFox-fire glowed. Patches of pale phosphorescence--luminous\nmushrooms--shone faintly in the dark.\n\nPresently Burl moved through the night. He could imagine the yellow\nemperor in its hiding-place, delicately preening slender limbs before it\nsettled down to rest until the new day dawned. He had noted landmarks,\nto guide himself. A week earlier and his blood would have run cold at\nthe bare thought of doing what he did now. In mere cool-headed\ndetachment he would have known that what he did was close to madness.\nBut he was neither cool-headed nor detached.\n\nHe crossed the clear ground before the low cliff. But for the fox-fire\nbeacons he would have been lost instantly. The slow drippings of rain\nbegan. The sky was dead black. Now was the time for night-things to fly,\nand male tarantulas to go seeking mates and prey. It was definitely no\ntime for adventuring.\n\nBurl moved on. He found the close-packed toadstools by the process of\nrunning into them in the total obscurity. He fumbled, trying to force\nhis way between them. It could not be done; they grew too close and too\nlow. He raged at this impediment. He climbed.\n\nThis was insanity. Burl stood on spongy mushroom-stuff that quivered and\nyielded under his weight. Somewhere something boomed upward, rising on\nfast-beating wings into blackness. He heard the pulsing drone of\nfour-inch mosquitos close by. He moved forward, the fungus support\nswaying, so that he did not so much walk as stagger over the\nclose-packed mushroom heads. He groped before him with spear and panted\na little. There was a part of him which was bitterly afraid, but he\nraged the more furiously because if once he gave way even to caution, it\nwould turn to panic.\n\nBurl would have made a strange spectacle in daylight gaudily clothed as\nhe was in soft blue fur and velvet cloak, staggering over swaying\ninsecurity, coddling ferocity in himself against the threat of fear.\n\nThen his spear told him there was emptiness ahead. Something moved,\nbelow. He heard and felt it stirring the toadstool-stalks on which he\nstood.\n\nBurl raised his spear, grasping it in both hands. He plunged down with\nit, stabbing fiercely.\n\nThe spear struck something vastly more resistant than any mushroom could\nbe. It penetrated. Then the stabbed thing moved as Burl landed upon it,\nflinging him off his feet, but he clung to the firmly imbedded weapon.\nAnd if his mouth had opened for a yell of victory as he plunged down,\nthe nature of the surface on which he found himself, and the kind of\nmovement he felt, turned that yell into a gasp of horror.\n\nIt wasn't the furry body of a butterfly he had landed on; his spear\nhadn't pierced such a creature's soft flesh. He had leaped upon the\nbroad, hard back of a huge, meat-eating, nocturnal beetle. His spear had\npierced not the armor, but the leathery joint-tissue between head and\nthorax.\n\nThe giant creature rocketed upward with Burl clinging to his spear. He\nheld fast with an agonized strength. His mount rose from the blackness\nof the ground into the many times more terrifying blackness of the air.\nIt rose up and up. If Burl could have screamed, he would have done so,\nbut he could not cry out. He could only hold fast, glassy-eyed.\n\nThen he dropped. Wind roared past him. The great insect was clumsy at\nflying. All beetles are. Burl's weight and the pain it felt made its\nflying clumsier still. There was a semi-liquid crashing and an impact.\nBurl was torn loose and hurled away. He crashed into the spongy top of a\nmushroom and came to rest with his naked shoulder hanging halfway over\nsome invisible drop. He struggled.\n\nHe heard the whining drone of his attempted prey. It rocketed aloft\nagain. But there was something wrong with it. With his weight applied to\nthe spear as he was torn free, Burl had twisted the weapon in the wound.\nIt had driven deeper, multiplying the damage of the first stab.\n\nThe beetle crashed to earth again, nearby. As Burl struggled again, the\nmushroom-stalk split and let him gently to the ground.\n\nHe heard the flounderings of the great beetle in the darkness. It\nmounted skyward once more, its wing-beats no longer making a sustained\nnote. It thrashed the air irregularly and wildly.\n\nThen it crashed again.\n\nThere was seeming silence, save for the steady drip-drip of the rain.\nAnd Burl came out of his half-mad fear: he suddenly realized that he\nhad slain a victim even more magnificent than a spider, because this\ncreature was meat.\n\nHe found himself astonishedly running toward the spot where the beetle\nhad last fallen.\n\nBut he heard it struggle aloft once more. It was wounded to death. Burl\nfelt certain of it this time. It floundered in mid-air and crashed\nagain.\n\nHe was within yards of it before he checked himself. Now he was\nweaponless, and the gigantic insect flung itself about madly on the\nground, striking out with colossal wings and limbs, fighting it knew not\nwhat. It struggled to fly, crashed, and fought its way off the\nground--ever more weakly--then smashed again into mushrooms. There it\nfloundered horribly in the darkness.\n\nBurl drew near and waited. It was still, but pain again drove it to a\nsenseless spasm of activity.\n\nThen it struck against something. There was a ripping noise and\ninstantly the close, peppery, burning smell of the red dust was in the\nair. The beetle had floundered into one of the close-packed red\npuffballs, tightly filled with the deadly red spores. The red dust would\nnot normally have been released at night. With the nightly rain, it\nwould not travel so far or spread so widely.\n\nBurl fled, panting.\n\nBehind him he heard his victim rise one last time, spurred to\nimpossible, final struggle by the anguish caused by the breathed-in red\ndust. It rose clumsily into the darkness in its death-throes and crashed\nto the ground again for the last time.\n\nIn time to come, Burl and his followers might learn to use the red-dust\npuffballs as weapons--but not how to spread them beyond their normal\nrange. But now, Burl was frightened. He moved hastily sidewise. The dust\nwould travel down-wind. He got out of its possible path.\n\nThere could be no exultation where the red dust was. Burl suddenly\nrealized what had happened to him. He had been carried aloft an unknown\nthough not-great distance, in an unknown direction. He was separated\nfrom his tribe, with no faintest idea how to find them in the darkness.\nAnd it was night.\n\nHe crouched under the nearest huge toadstool and waited for the dawn,\nlistening dry-throated for the sound of death coming toward him through\nthe night.\n\nBut only the wind-beats of night-fliers came to his ears, and the\ndiscordant notes of gray-bellied truffle-beetles as they roamed the\nmushroom thickets, seeking the places beneath which--so their adapted\ninstincts told them--fungoid dainties, not too much unlike the truffles\nof Earth, awaited the industrious miner. And, of course, there was that\neternal, monotonous dripping of the raindrops, falling at irregular\nintervals from the sky.\n\nRed puffballs did not burst at night. They would not burst anyhow,\nexcept at one certain season of their growth. But Burl and his folk had\nso far encountered the over-hasty ones, bursting earlier than most. The\ntime of ripeness was very nearly here, though. When day came again, and\nthe chill dampness of the night was succeeded by the warmth of the\nmorning, almost the first thing Burl saw in the gray light was a tall\nspouting of brownish-red stuff leaping abruptly into the air from a\nburst red parchment-like sphere.\n\nHe stood up and looked anxiously all around. Here and there, all over\nthe landscape, slowly and at intervals, the plumes of fatal red sprang\ninto the air. There was nothing quite like it anywhere else. An ancient\nman, inhabiting Earth, might have likened the appearance to that of a\nscattered and leisurely bombardment. But Burl had no analogy for them.\n\nHe saw something hardly a hundred yards from where he had hidden during\nthe night. The dead beetle lay there, crumpled and limp. Burl eyed it\nspeculatively. Then he saw something that filled him with elation. The\nlast crash of the beetle to the ground had driven his spear deeply\nbetween the joints of the corselet and neck. Even if the red dust had\nnot finished the creature, the spear-point would have ended its life.\n\nHe was thrilled once more by his superlative greatness. He made due note\nthat he was a mighty slayer. He took the antennae as proof of his valor\nand hacked off a great barb-edged leg for meat. And then he remembered\nthat he did not know how to find his fellow-tribesmen. He had no idea\nwhich way to go.\n\nEven a civilized man would have been at a loss, though he would have\nhunted for an elevation from which to look for the cliff hiding-place of\nthe tribe. But Burl had not yet progressed so far. His wild ride of the\nnight before had been at random, and the chase after the wounded beetle\nno less dictated by chance. There was no answer.\n\nHe set off anxiously, searching everywhere. But he had to be alert for\nall the dangers of an inimical world while keeping, at the same time, an\nextremely sharp eye out for bursting red puffballs.\n\nAt the end of an hour he thought he saw familiar things. Then he\nrecognized the spot. He had come back to the dead beetle. It was already\nthe center of a mass of small black bodies which pulled and hacked at\nthe tough armor, gnawing out great lumps of flesh to be carried to the\nnearest ant-city.\n\nBurl set off again, very carefully avoiding any place that he recognized\nas having been seen that morning. Sometimes he walked through\nmushroom-thickets--dangerous places to be in--and sometimes over\nrelatively clear ground colored exotically with varicolored fungi. More\nthan once he saw the clouds of red stuff spurting in the distance. Deep\nanxiety filled him. He had no idea that there were such things as points\nof the compass. He knew only that he needed desperately to find his\ntribesfolk again.\n\nThey, of course, had given him up for dead. He had vanished in the\nnight. Old Tama complained of him shrilly. The night, to them, meant\ndeath. Jon quaked watchfully all through it. When Burl did not come to\nthe feast of mushroom that Jon and Dor had brought back, they sought\nhim. They even called timidly into the darkness. They heard the\nthrobbing of huge wings as a great creature rose desperately into the\nsky, but they did not associate that sound with Burl. If they had, they\nwould have been instantly certain of his fate.\n\nAs it was, the tribe's uneasiness grew into terror which rapidly turned\nto despair. They began to tremble, wondering what they would do with no\nbold chieftain to guide them. He was the first man to command allegiance\nfrom others in much too long a period, on the forgotten planet, but the\nsubmission of his followers had been the more complete for its novelty.\nHis loss was the more appalling. Burl had mistaken the triumphant shout\nof the foragers. He'd thought it independence of him--rivalry. Actually,\nthe men dared to shout only because they felt secure under his\nleadership. When they accepted the fact that he had vanished--and to\ndisappear in the night had always meant death--their old fears and\ntimidity returned. To them it was added despair.\n\nThey huddled together and whispered to one another of their fright. They\nwaited in trembling silence through all the long night. Had a\nhunting-spider appeared, they would have fled in as many directions as\nthere were people, and undoubtedly all would have perished. But day came\nagain, and they looked into each other's eyes and saw the self-same\nfear. Saya was probably the most pitiful of the group. Her face was\nwhite and drawn beyond that of any one else.\n\nThey did not move when day brightened. They remained about the\nbee-tunnels, speaking in hushed tones, huddled together, searching all\nthe horizon for enemies. Saya would not eat, but sat still, staring\nbefore her in numbed grief. Burl was dead.\n\nAtop the low cliff a red puffball glistened in the morning light. Its\ntough skin was taut and bulging, resisting the pressure of the spores\nwithin. Slowly, as the morning wore on, some of the moisture that kept\nthe skin stretchable dried. The parchment-like stuff contracted. The\ntautness of the spore-packed envelope grew greater. It became\ninsupportable.\n\nWith a ripping sound, the tough skin split across and a rush of the\ncompressed spores shot skyward.\n\nThe tribesmen saw and cried out and fled. The red stuff drifted down\npast the cliff-edge. It drifted toward the humans. They ran from it. Jon\nand Tama ran fastest. Jak and Cori and the other were not far behind.\nSaya trailed, in her despair.\n\nHad Burl been there, matters would have been different. He had already\nsuch an ascendancy over the minds of the others that even in panic they\nwould have looked to see what he did. And he would have dodged the\nslowly drifting death-cloud by day, as he had during the night. But his\nfollowers ran blindly.\n\nAs Saya fled after the others she heard shrieks of fright to the left\nand ran faster. She passed by a thick mass of distorted fungi in which\nthere was a sudden stirring and panic lent wings to her feet. She\nfled blindly, panting. Ahead was a great mass of stuff--red\npuffballs--showing here and there among great fanlike growths, some\ntwelve feet high, that looked like sponges.\n\nShe fled past them and swerved to hide herself from anything that might\nbe pursuing by sight. Her foot slipped on the slimy body of a shell-less\nsnail and she fell heavily, her head striking a stone. She lay still.\n\nAlmost as if at a signal a red puffball burst among the fanlike growths.\nA thick, dirty-red cloud of dust shot upward, spread and billowed and\nbegan to settle slowly toward the ground again. It moved as it settled\nflowing over the inequalities of die ground as a monstrous snail or\nleach might have done, sucking from all breathing creatures the life\nthey had within them. It was a hundred yards away, then fifty, then\nthirty....\n\nHad any member of the tribe watched it, the red dust might have seemed\nmalevolently intelligent. But when the edges of the dust-cloud were no\nmore than twenty yards from Saya's limp body, an opposing breeze sprang\nup. It was a vagrant, fitful little breeze that halted the red cloud and\nthrew it into some confusion, sending it in a new direction. It passed\nSaya without hurting her, though one of its misty tendrils reached out\nas if to snatch at her in slow-motion. But it passed her by.\n\nSaya lay motionless on the ground. Only her breast rose and fell\nshallowly. A tiny pool of red gathered near her head.\n\nSome thirty feet from where she lay, there were three miniature\ntoadstools in a clump, bases so close together that they seemed but one.\nFrom between two of them, however, two tufts of reddish thread appeared.\nThey twinkled back and forth and in and out. As if reassured, two\nslender antennae followed, then bulging eyes and a small, black body\nwith bright-red scalloped markings upon it.\n\nIt was a tiny beetle no more than eight inches long--a sexton or\nburying-beetle. Drawing near Saya's body it scurried onto her flesh. It\nwent from end to end of her figure in a sort of feverish haste. Then it\ndived into the ground beneath her shoulder, casting back a little shower\nof hastily-dug dirt as it disappeared.\n\nTen minutes later, another small creature appeared, precisely like the\nfirst. Upon the heels of the second came a third. Each made the same\nhasty examination and dived under her unmoving form.\n\nPresently the ground seemed to billow at a spot along Saya's side and\nthen at another. Ten minutes after the arrival of the third beetle, a\nlittle rampart had reared itself all about Saya's body, following her\noutlines precisely. Then her body moved slightly, in little jerks,\nseeming to settle perhaps half an inch into the ground.\n\nThe burying-beetles were of that class of creatures which exploited the\nbodies of the fallen. Working from below, they excavated the earth. When\nthere was a hollow space below they turned on their backs and thrust up\nwith their legs, jerking at the body until it sank into the space they\nhad made ready. The process would be repeated until at last all their\ndead treasures had settled down below the level of the surrounding\nground. The loosened dirt then fell in at the sides, completing the\ninhumation. Then, in the underground darkness, it was the custom for the\nbeetles to feast magnificently, gorging themselves upon the food they\nhad hidden from other scavengers--and of course rearing their young also\nupon its substance.\n\nAnts and flies were rivals of these beetles and not infrequently the\nsexton-beetles came upon carrion after ants had taken their toll, and\nwhen it already swarmed with maggots. But in this case Saya was not\ndead. The fact that she still lived, though unconscious, was the factor\nthat had given the sexton-beetles this splendid opportunity.\n\nShe breathed gently and irregularly, her face drawn with the sorrow of\nthe night before, while the desperately hurrying beetles swarmed about\nbeneath her body, channelling away the soil so she would sink lower and\nlower into it. She descended slowly, a half-inch by a half-inch. The\nbright-red tufts of thread appeared again and a beetle made its way to\nthe open air. It moved hastily about, inspecting the progress of the\nwork.\n\nIt dived below again. Another inch and, after a long time, another, were\nexcavated.\n\nMatters still progressed when Burl stepped out from a group of\novershadowing toadstools and halted. He cast his eyes over the landscape\nand was struck by its familiarity. He was, in fact, very near the spot\nhe had left the night before in that maniacal ride on the back of a\nflying beetle. He moved back and forth, trying to account for the\nfeeling of recognition.\n\nHe saw the low cliff, then, and moved eagerly toward it, passing within\nfifty feet of Saya's body, now more than half-buried in the ground. The\nloose dirt around the outline of her figure was beginning to topple in\nlittle rivulets upon her. One of her shoulders was already half-screened\nfrom view. Burl passed on, unseeing.\n\nHe hurried a little. In a moment he recognized his location exactly.\nThere were the mining-bee burrows. There was a thrown-away lump of\nedible mushroom, cast aside as the tribesfolk fled.\n\nHis feet stirred up a fine dust, and he stopped short. A red puffball\nhad burst here. It fully accounted for the absence of the tribe, and\nBurl sweated in sudden fear. He thought instantly of Saya. He went\ncarefully to make sure. This was, absolutely, the hiding place of the\ntribe. There was another mushroom-fragment. There was a spear, thrown\ndown by one of the men in his flight. Red dust had settled upon the\nspear and the mushroom-fragments.\n\nBurl turned back, hurrying again, but taking care to disturb the dust no\nmore than he could possibly help.\n\nThe little excavation into which Saya was sinking inch by inch was not\nin his path. Her body no longer lay above the ground, but in it. Burl\nwent by, frantic with anxiety about the tribe, but about Saya most of\nall.\n\nHer body quivered and sank a fraction into the ground. Half a dozen\nsmall streams of earth were tumbling upon her. In minutes she would be\nwholly hidden from view.\n\nBurl went to beat among the mushroom-thickets, in quest of the bodies of\nhis tribesfolk. They could have staggered out of the red dust and\ncollapsed beyond. He would have shouted, but the deep sense of\nloneliness silenced him. His throat ached with grief. He searched on....\n\nThere was a noise. From a huge clump of toadstools--perhaps the very one\nhe had climbed over in the night--there came the sound of crashings and\nthe breaking of the spongy stuff. Twin tapering antennae appeared, and\nthen a monster beetle lurched into the open space, its ghastly mandibles\ngaping sidewise.\n\nIt was all of eight feet long and supported by six crooked, saw-toothed\nlegs. Huge, multiple eyes stared with preoccupation at the world. It\nadvanced deliberately with clankings and clashings as of a hideous\nmachine. Burl fled on the instant, running directly away from it.\n\nA little depression lay in the ground before him. He did not swerve, but\nmade to jump over it. As he leaped he saw the color of bare flesh, Saya,\nlimp and helpless, sinking slowly into the ground with tricklings of\ndirt falling down to cover her. It seemed to Burl that she quivered a\nlittle.\n\nInstantly there was a terrific struggle within Burl. Behind him was the\ngiant meat-eating beetle; beneath him was Saya whom he loved. There was\ncertain death lurching toward him on evilly crooked legs--and the life\nhe had hoped for lay in a shallow pit. Of course he thought Saya dead.\n\nPerhaps it was rage, or despair, or a simple human madness which made\nhim act otherwise than rationally. The things which raise humans above\nbrute creation, however, are only partly reasonable. Most human\nemotions--especially the creditable ones--cannot be justified by reason,\nand very few heroic actions are based upon logical thought.\n\nBurl whirled as he landed, his puny spear held ready. In his left hand\nhe held the haunch of a creature much like the one which clanked and\nrattled toward him. With a yell of insane defiance--completely beyond\njustification by reason--Burl flung that meat-filled leg at the monster.\n\nIt hit. Undoubtedly, it hurt. The beetle seized it ferociously. It\ncrushed it. There was meat in it, sweet and juicy.\n\nThe beetle devoured it. It forgot the man standing there, waiting for\ndeath. It crunched the leg-joint of a cousin or brother, confusing the\nblow with the missile that had delivered it. When the tidbit was\nfinished it turned and lumbered off to investigate another mushroom\nthicket. It seemed to consider then an enemy had been conquered and\ndevoured and that normal life could go on.\n\nThen Burl stopped quickly, and dragged Saya from the grave the\nsexton-beetles had labored so feverishly to provide for her. Crumbled\nsoil fell from her shoulders, from her face, and from her body. Three\nlittle eight-inch beetles with black and red markings scurried for cover\nin terrified haste. Burl carried Saya to a resting-place of soft mould\nto mourn over her.\n\nHe was a completely ignorant savage, save that he knew more of the ways\nof insects than anybody anywhere else--the Ecological Service, which had\nstocked this planet, not being excepted. To Burl the unconsciousness of\nSaya was as death itself. Dumb misery smote him, and he laid her down\ngently and quite literally wept. He had been beautifully pleased with\nhimself for having slain one flying beetle. But for Saya's seeming\ndeath, he would have been almost unbearable with pride over having put\nanother to flight. But now he was merely a broken-hearted, very human\nyoung man.\n\nBut a long time later Saya opened her eyes and looked about\nbewilderedly.\n\nThey were in considerable danger for some time after that, because they\nwere oblivious to everything but each other. Saya rested in\nhalf-incredulous happiness against Burl's shoulder as he told her\njerkily of his attempt on a night-bound butterfly, which turned out to\nbe a flying beetle that took him aloft. He told of his search for the\ntribe and then his discovery of her apparently lifeless body. When he\nspoke of the monster which had lurched from the mushroom thicket, and of\nthe desperation with which he had faced it, Saya looked at him with\nwarm, proud eyes. But Burl was abruptly struck with the remarkable\nconvenience of that discovery. If his tribesmen could secure an ample\nsupply of meat, they might defend themselves against attack by throwing\nit to their attackers. In fact, insects were so stupid that almost any\nobject thrown quickly enough and fast enough, might be made to serve as\nsacrifices instead of themselves.\n\nA timid, frightened whisper roused them from their absorption. They\nlooked up. The boy Dik stood some distance away, staring at them\nwide-eyed, almost convinced that he looked upon the living dead. A\nsudden movement on the part of either of them would have sent him\nbolting away. Two or three other bobbing heads gazed affrightedly from\nnearby hiding-places. Jon was poised for flight.\n\nThe tribe had come back to its former hiding-place simply as a way to\nreassemble. They had believed both Burl and Saya dead, and they accepted\nBurl's death as their own doom. But now they stared.\n\nBurl spoke--fortunately without arrogance--and Dik and Tet came\ntimorously from their hiding-places. The others followed, the tribe\nforming a frightened half-circle about the seated pair. Burl spoke again\nand presently one of the bravest--Cori--dared to approach and touch him.\nInstantly a babble of the crude labial language of the tribe broke out.\nAwed exclamations and questions filled the air.\n\nBut Burl, for once, showed some common sense. Instead of a vainglorious\nrecital, he merely cast down the long tapering antennae of the\nflying-beetle. They looked, and recognized their origin.\n\nThen Burl curtly ordered Dor and Jak to make a chair of their hands for\nSaya. She was weak from her fall and the loss of blood. The two men\nhumbly advanced and obeyed. Then Burl curtly ordered the march resumed.\n\nThey went on, more slowly than on previous days, but none-the-less\nsteadily. Burl led them across-country, marching in advance with a\nmatter-of-fact alertness for signs of danger. He felt more confidence\nthan ever before. It was not fully justified, of course. Jon now\nretrieved the spear he had discarded. The small party fairly bristled\nwith weapons. But Burl knew that they were liable to be cast away as\nimpediments if flight seemed necessary.\n\nAs he led the way Burl began to think busily in the manner that only\nleaders find necessary. He had taught his followers to kill ants for\nfood, though they were still uneasy about such adventures. He had led\nthem to attack great yellow grubs upon giant cabbages. But they had not\nyet faced any actual danger, as he had done. He must drive them to face\nsomething....\n\nThe opportunity came that same day, in late afternoon. To westward the\ncloud-bank was barely beginning to show the colors that presage\nnightfall, when a bumble-bee droned heavily overhead, making for its\nhome burrow. The little, straggling group of marching people looked up\nand saw the scanty load of pollen packed in the stiff bristles of the\nbee's hind-legs. It sped onward heavily, its almost transparent wings\nmere blurs in the air.\n\nIt was barely fifty feet above the ground. Burl dropped his glance and\ntensed. A slender-waisted wasp was shooting upward from an ambush among\nthe noisome fungi of this plain.\n\nThe bee swerved and tried to escape. The wasp over-hauled it. The bee\ndodged frantically. It was a good four feet in length,--as large as the\nwasp, certainly--but it was more heavily built and could not make the\nspeed of which the wasp was capable. It dodged with less agility. Twice,\nin desperation, it did manage to evade the plunging dives of the wasp,\nbut the third time the two insects grappled in mid-air almost over the\nheads of the humans.\n\nThey tumbled downward in a clawing, biting, tangle of bodies and legs.\nThey hit the ground and rolled over and over. The bee struggled to\ninsert her barbed sting in the more supple body of her adversary. She\nwrithed and twisted desperately.\n\nBut there came an instant of infinite confusion and the bee lay on her\nback. The wasp suddenly moved with that ghastly skilled precision of a\ncreature performing an incredible feat instinctively, apparently unaware\nthat it is doing so. The dazed bee was swung upright in a peculiarly\nartificial pose. The wasp's body curved, and its deadly, rapier-sharp\nsting struck....\n\nThe bee was dead. Instantly. As if struck dead by lightning. The wasp\nhad stung in a certain place in the neck-parts where all the nerve-cords\npass. To sting there, the wasp had to bring its victim to a particular\npose. It was precisely the trick of a _desnucador_, the butcher who\nkills cattle by severing the spinal cord. For the wasp's purposes the\nbee had to be killed in this fashion and no other.\n\nBurl began to give low-toned commands to his followers. He knew what was\ncoming next, and so did they. When the sequel of the murder began he\nmoved forward, his tribesmen wavering after him. This venture was\nactually one of the least dangerous they could attempt, but merely to\nattack a wasp was a hair-raising idea. Only Burl's prestige plus their\nknowledge made them capable of it.\n\nThe second act of the murder-drama was gruesomeness itself. The\npirate-wasp was a carnivore, but this was the season when the wasps\nraised young. Inevitably there was sweet honey in the half-filled crop\nof the bee. Had she arrived safely at the hive, the sweet and sticky\nliquid would have been disgorged for the benefit of bee-grubs. The wasp\navidly set to work to secure that honey. The bee-carcass itself was\ndestined for the pirate-wasp's own offspring, and that squirming\nmonstrosity is even more violently carnivorous than its mother. The\nparent wasp set about abstracting the dead bee's honey, before taking\nthe carcass to its young one, because honey is poisonous to the\npirate-wasp's grub. Yet insects cannot act from solicitude or anything\nbut instinct. And instinct must be maintained by lavish rewards.\n\nSo the pirate-wasp sought its reward--an insane, insatiable, gluttonous\nsatisfaction in the honey that was poison to its young. The wasp foiled\nits murdered victim upon its back again and feverishly pressed on the\nlimp body to force out the honey. And this was the reason for its\nprecise manner of murder. Only when killed by the destruction of all\nnerve-currents would the bee's body be left limp like this. Only a bee\nkilled in this exact fashion would yield its honey to manipulation.\n\nThe honey appeared, flowing from the dead bee's mouth. The wasp, in\ntrembling, ghoulish ecstasy, devoured it as it appeared. It was lost to\nall other sights or sensations but its feast.\n\nAnd this was the moment when Burl signalled for the attack. The\ntribesmen's prey was deaf and blind and raptured. It was aware of\nnothing but the delight it savored. But the men wavered, nevertheless,\nwhen they drew near. Burl was first to thrust his spear powerfully into\nthe trembling body.\n\nWhen he was not instantly destroyed the others took courage. Dor's spear\npenetrated the very vitals of the ghoul. Jak's club fell with terrific\nforce upon the wasp's slender waist. There was a crackling, and the\nlong, spidery limbs quivered and writhed. Then Burl struck again and the\ncreature fell into two writhing halves.\n\nThey butchered it rather messily, but Burl noticed that even as it died,\nsundered and pierced with spears, its long tongue licked out in one last\nrapturous taste of the honey that had been its undoing.\n\nSome time later, burdened with the pollen laden legs of the great bee,\nthe tribe resumed its journey.\n\nNow Burl had men behind him. They were still timid and prone to flee at\nthe least alarm, but they were vastly more dependable than they had\nbeen. They had attacked and slain a wasp whose sting would have killed\nany of them. They had done battle under the leadership of Burl, whose\nspear had struck the first blow. They were sharers of his glory and,\ntherefore, much more nearly like the followers of a chieftain ought to\nbe.\n\nTheir new spirit was badly needed. The red puffballs were certainly no\nless numerous in the new territory the tribe traversed than in the\nterritory they had left. And the season of their ripening' was further\nadvanced. More and more of the ground showed the deadly rime of settled\ndeath-dust. To stay alive was increasingly difficult. When the full\nspore-casting season arrived, it would be impossible. And that season\ncould not be far away.\n\nThe very next day after the killing of the wasp, survival despite the\nred dust had begun to seem unimaginable. Where, earlier, one saw a\nred-dust cloud bursting here and there at intervals, on this day there\nwas always a billowing mass of lethal vapor in the air. At no time was\nthe landscape free of a moving mist of death. Usually there were three\nor four in sight at once. Often there were half a dozen. Once there were\neight. It could be guessed that in one day more they would ripen in such\nmonstrous numbers that anything which walked or flew or crawled must\nbreathe in the spores and perish.\n\nAnd that day, just at sunset, the tribe came to the top of a small rise\nin the ground. For an hour they had been marching and countermarching to\navoid the suddenly-billowing clouds of dust. Once they had been nearly\nhemmed in when three of the dull-red mists seemed to flow together,\nenclosing the three sides of a circle. They escaped then only by the\nmost desperate of sprinting.\n\nBut now they came to the little hillock and halted. Before them\nstretched a plain, all of four miles wide, colored a brownish brick-red\nby the red puffballs. The tribe had seen mushroom forests--they had\nlived in them--and knew of the dangers that lurked there. But the plain\nbefore them was not simply dangerous; it was fatal. To right and left it\nstretched as far as the eye could see, but away on its farther edge Burl\ncaught a glimpse of flowing water.\n\nOver the plain itself a thin red haze seemed to float. It was simply a\ncloud of the deadly spores, dispersed and indefinite, but constantly\nreplenished by the freshly bursting puffballs. While the tribesfolk\nstood and watched, thick columns of dust rose here and there and at the\nother place, too many to count. They settled again but left behind\nenough of the fine powder to keep a thin red haze over all the plain.\nThis was a mass of literally millions of the deadly growths. Here was\none place where no carnivorous beetles roamed and where no spiders\nlurked. There were nothing here but the sullen columns of dust and the\nhaze that they left behind.\n\nAnd of course it would be nothing less than suicide to try to go back.\n\n\n\n\n_8. A FLIGHT CONTINUES_\n\n\nBurl kept his people alive until darkness fell. He had assigned watchers\nfor each direction and when flight was necessary the adults helped the\nchildren to avoid the red dust. Four times they changed direction after\nshrill-voiced warnings. When night settled over the plain they were\nforced to come to a halt.\n\nBut the puffballs were designed to burst by day. Stumbled into, they\ncould split at any time, and the humans did hear some few of the tearing\nnoises that denoted a spore-spout in the darkness. But after slow\nnightly rain began they heard no more.\n\nBurl led his people into the plain of red puffballs as soon as the rain\nhad lasted long enough to wash down the red haze still hanging in the\nair and turn the fallen spores to mud.\n\nIt was an enterprise of such absolute desperation that very likely no\ncivilized man would have tried it. There were no stars, for guidance,\nnor compasses to show the way. There were no lights to enable them to\ndodge the deadly things they strove to escape, and there was no\npossibility of their keeping a straight course in the darkness. They had\nto trust to luck in perhaps the longest long-shot that humans every\naccepted as a gamble.\n\nQuaintly, they used the long antennae of a dead flying-beetle as\nsense-organs for themselves. They entered the red plain in a long single\nfile, Burl leading the way with one of the two feathery whips extended\nbefore him. Saya helped him check on what lay in the darkness ahead, but\nmade sure not to leave his side. Others trailed behind, hand in hand.\n\nProgress was slow. The sky was utter blackness, of course, but nowhere\nin the lowlands is there an absolute black. Where fox-fire doesn't burn\nwithout consuming, there are mushrooms with glows of their own. Rusts\nsometimes shone faintly. Naturally there were no fireflies or glow-worms\nof any sort; but neither were there any living things to hunt the tiny\ntribe as it moved half-blindly in single file through the plain of red\npuffballs. Within half an hour even Burl did not believe he had kept to\nhis original line. An hour later they realized despairingly that they\nwere marching helpless through puffballs which would make the air\nunbreathable at dawn. But they marched on.\n\nOnce they smelled the rank odor of cabbages. They followed the scent and\ncame upon them, glowing palely with parasitic moulds on their leaves.\nAnd there were living things here: huge caterpillars eating and eating,\neven in the dark, against the time of metamorphosis. Burl could have\ncried out infuriatedly at them because they were--so he assumed--immune\nto the death of the red dust. But the red dust was all about, and the\nsmell of cabbages was not the smell of life.\n\nIt could have been, of course. Caterpillars breathe like all insects at\nevery stage of their development. But furry caterpillars breathe through\nopenings which are covered over with matted fur. Here, that matted fur\nacted to filter the air. The eggs of the caterpillars had been laid\nbefore the puffballs were ready to burst. The time of spore-bearing\nwould be over before the grubs were butterflies or moths. These\ncreatures were safe against all enemies--even men. But men groped and\nblundered in the darkness simply because they did not think to take the\nfur garments they wore and hold them to their noses to serve as\ngas-masks or air-filters. The time for that would come, but not yet.\n\nWith the docility of despair, Burl's tribe followed him through all the\nnight. When the sky began to pale in the east, they numbly resigned\nthemselves to death. But still they followed.\n\nAnd in the very early gray light--when only the very ripest of the red\npuffballs spouted toward a still-dark sky--Burl looked harassedly about\nhim and could have groaned. He was in a little circular clearing, the\ndeadly red things all about him. There was not yet light enough for\ncolors to appear. There was merely a vast stillness everywhere, and a\nmocking hint of the hot and peppery scent of death-dust--now turned to\nmud--all about him.\n\nBurl dropped in bitter discouragement. Soon the misty dust-clouds would\nbegin to move about; the reddish haze would form above all this\nspace....\n\nThen, quite suddenly, he lifted his head and whooped. He had heard the\nsound of running water.\n\nHis followers looked at him with dawning hope. Without a word to them,\nBurl began to run. They followed hastily and quickened their pace when\nhis voice came back in a shout of triumph. In a moment they had emerged\nfrom the tangle of fungus growths to stand upon the banks of a wide\nriver--the same river whose gleam Burl had seen the day before, from the\nfarther side of the red puffball plain.\n\nOnce before, Burl had floated down a river upon a mushroom raft. That\njourney had been involuntary. He had been carried far from his tribe and\nSaya, his heart filled with desolation. But now he viewed the\nswiftly-running current with delight.\n\nHe cast his eyes up and down the bank. Here and there it rose in a low\nbluff and thick shelf-fungi stretched out above the water. They were\nadaptations of the fungi that once had grown on trees and now fed upon\nthe incredibly nourishing earth-banks formed of dead growing things.\nBurl was busy in an instant, stabbing the relatively hard growths with\nhis spear and striving to wrench them free. The tribesmen stared\nblankly, but at a snapped order they imitated him.\n\nSoon two dozen masses of firm, light fungus lay upon the shore. Burl\nbegan to explain what they were for, but Dor remonstrated. They were\nafraid to part from him. If they might embark on the same fungus-raft,\nit would be a different matter. Old Tama scolded him shrilly at the\nthought of separation. Jon trembled at the mere idea.\n\nBurl cast an apprehensive glance at the sky. Day was rapidly\napproaching. Soon the red puffballs would burst and shoot their\ndust-clouds into the air. This was no time to make stipulations. Then\nSaya spoke softly.\n\nBurl made the suggested great sacrifice. He took the gorgeous velvet\ncloak of moth-wing from his shoulder and tore it into a dozen long,\nirregular pieces along the lines of the sinews reinforcing it. He\nplanted his spear upright in the largest raft, fastening the other\ncranky craft to it with the improvised lines.\n\nIn a matter of minutes the small flotilla of rafts bobbed in the stream.\nOne by one, Burl settled the folk upon them with stern commands about\nmovement. Then he shoved them out from the bank. The collection of\nuneasy, floating things moved slowly out from shore to where the current\ncaught them. Burl and Saya sat on the same section of fungus, the other\ntrustful but frightened tribes-people clustered timorously about.\n\nAs they began to move between the mushroom-lined banks of the river,\nand as the mist of nighttime lifted from its surface, columns of red\ndust spurted sullenly upward on the plain. In the light of dawn the\ndeadly red haze was forming once more over the puffball plain.\n\nBy that time, however, the unstable rafts were speeding down the river,\nbobbing and whirling in the stream, with wide-eyed people as their\npassengers gazing in wonderment at the shores.\n\nFive miles downstream, the red growths became less numerous and other\nforms of fungus took their places. Moulds and rusts covered the ground\nas grass did on more favored planets. Toadstools showed their creamy,\nrounded heads, and there were malformed things with swollen trunks and\nbranches mocking the trees that were never seen in these lowlands. Once\nthe tribesmen saw the grisly bulk of a hunting-spider outlined on the\nriver-bank.\n\nAll through the long day they rode the current, while the insect life\nthat had been absent in the neighborhood of the death-plain became\nabundant again. Bees once more droned overhead, and wasps and\ndragonflies. Four-inch mosquitoes appeared, to be driven off with blows.\nGlittering beetles made droning or booming noises as they flew. Flies of\nevery imaginable metallic hue flew about. Huge butterflies danced above\nthe steaming land and running river in seeming ecstasy at simply being\nalive.\n\nAll the thousand-and-one forms of insect life flew and crawled and swam\nand dived where the people of the rafts could see them. Water-beetles\ncame lazily to the surface to snap at other insects on the surface. The\nshell-covered boats of caddis-flies floated in the eddies and\nbackwaters.\n\nThe day wore on and the shores flowed by. The tribesmen ate of their\nfood and drank of the river. When afternoon came the banks fell away and\nthe current slackened. The shores became indefinite. The river merged\nitself into a vast swamp from which came a continual muttering.\n\nThe water seemed to grow dark when black mud took the place of the clay\nthat had formed its bed. Then there appeared floating green things which\ndid not move with the flowing water. They were the leaves of the\nwater-lilies that managed to survive along with cabbages and a very few\nother plants in the midst of a fungus world. Twelve feet across, any one\nof the green leaves might have supported the whole of Burl's tribe.\n\nThey became so numerous that only a relatively narrow, uncovered stream\nflowed between tens of acres of the flat, floating leaves. Here and\nthere colossal waxen blossoms could be seen. Three men could hide in\nthose enormous flowers. They exhaled an almost overpowering fragrance\ninto the air.\n\nAnd presently the muttering sound that had been heard far away grew in\nvolume to an intermittent deep-bass roar. It seemed to come from the\nbanks on either side. It was the discordant croaking of frogs, eight\nfeet in length, which lived and throve in this swamp. Presently the\ntribesfolk saw them: green giants sitting immobile upon the banks, only\nopening their huge mouths to croak.\n\nHere in the swamps there was such luxuriance of insect life that a\nnormal tribal hunting-ground--in which tribesmen were not yet accustomed\nto hunt--would seem like a desert by comparison. Myriads of little\nmidges, no more than three or four inches across their wings, danced\nabove the water. Butterflies flew low, seemingly enamoured of their\nreflections in the glassy water.\n\nThe people watched as if their eyes would become engorged by the strange\nnew things they saw. Where the river split and split and divided again,\nthere was nothing with which they were familiar. Mushrooms did not grow\nhere. Moulds, yes. But there were cattails, with stalks like trees,\ntowering thirty feet above the waterways.\n\nAfter a long, long time though, the streams began to rejoin each other.\nThen low hills loomed through the thicker haze that filled the air here.\nThe river flowed toward and through them. And here a wall of high\nmountains rose toward the sky, but their height could not be guessed.\nThey vanished in the mist even before the cloud-bank swallowed them.\n\nThe river flowed through a river-gate, a water-gap in the mountains.\nWhile day still held fully bright, the bobbing rafts went whirling\nthrough a narrow pass with sheer walls that rose beyond all seeing in\nthe mist. Here there was even some white water. Above it, spanning a\nchasm five hundred feet across, a banded spider had flung its web. The\nrafts floated close enough to see the spider, a monster even of its\nkind, its belly swollen to a diameter of yards. It hung motionless in\nthe center of the snare as the humans swept beneath it.\n\nThen the mountains drew back and the tribe was in a valley where, look\nas they might, there was no single tawny-red puffball from whose\nspreading range the tribesmen were refugees. The rafts grounded and they\nwaded ashore while still the day held. And there was food here in\nplenty.\n\nBut darkness fell before they could explore. As a matter of precaution\nBurl and his folk found a hiding-place in a mushroom-thicket and hid\nuntil morning. The night-sounds were wholly familiar to them. The noise\nof katydids was louder than usual--the feminine sound of that name gives\nno hint of the sonorous, deep-toned notes the enlarged creatures\nuttered--and that implied more vegetation as compared with straight\nfungoid flora. A great many fireflies glowed in the darkness shrouding\nthe hiding-place, indicating that the huge snails they fed on were\nplentiful. The snails would make very suitable prey for the tribesmen\nalso. But men were not yet established in their own minds as predators.\n\nThey were, though, definitely no longer the furtive vermin they had\nbeen. They knew there were such things as weapons. They had killed ants\nfor food and a pirate-wasp as an exercise in courage. To some degree\nthey were acquiring Burl's own qualities. But they were still behind\nhim--and he still had some way to go.\n\nThe next day they explored their new territory with a boldness which\nwould have been unthinkable a few weeks before. The new haven was a\nvalley, spreading out to a second swamp at its lower end. They could not\nknow it, but beyond the swamp lay the sea. Exploring, because of\nstrictly practical purposes and not for the sake of knowledge, they\nfound a great trap-door in the earth, sure sign of the lair of a spider.\nBurl considered that before many days the monster would have to be dealt\nwith. But he did not yet know how it could be done.\n\nHis people were rapidly becoming a tribe of men, but they still needed\nBurl to think for them. What he could not think out, so far, could not\nbe done. But a part of the proof that they needed Burl to think for them\nlay in the fact that they did not realize it. They gathered facts about\ntheir environment. The nearest ant-city was miles away. That meant that\nthey would encounter its scouting foragers rather than working-parties.\nThe ant-city would be a source of small prey--a notion that would have\nbeen inconceivable a little while ago. There were numerous giant\ncabbages in the valley and that meant there were big, defenseless slugs\nto spear whenever necessary.\n\nThey saw praying-mantises--the adults were eighteen feet tall and as big\nas giraffes, but much less desirable neighbors--and knew that they would\nhave to be avoided. But there were edible mushrooms on every hand. If\none avoided spiders and praying-mantises and the meat-eating beetles; if\none were safely hidden at night against the amorous male spiders who\ntook time off from courtship to devour anything living that came their\nway; and if one lived at high-tension alertness, interpreting every\nsound as possible danger and every unknown thing as certain peril--then\none could live quite comfortably in this valley.\n\nFor three days the tribesmen felt that they had found a sort of\nparadise. Jon had his belly full to bursting all day long. Tet and Dik\nbecame skilled ant-hunters. Dor found a better spear and practiced\nthoughtfully with it.\n\nThere were no red puffballs here. There was food. Burl's folk could\nimagine no greater happiness. Even old Tama scolded only rarely. They\nsurely could not conceive of any place where a man might walk calmly\nabout with no danger at all of being devoured. This was paradise!\n\nAnd it was a deplorable state of affairs. It is not good for human\nbeings to feel secure and experience contentment. Men achieve only by\ntheir wants or through their fears. Back at their former\nforaging-ground, the tribe would never have emulated Burl with any\npassion so long as they could survive by traditional behavior. Before\nthe menace of the red puffballs developed, he had brought them to the\npoint of killing ants, with him present and ready to assist. They would\nhave stayed at about that level. The red dust had forced their flight.\nDuring that flight they had achieved what was--compared to their former\ntimidity--prodigies of valor.\n\nBut now they arrived at paradise. There was food. They could survive\nhere in the fashion of the good old days before they learned the courage\nof desperation. They did not need Burl to keep them alive or to feed\nthem. They tended to disregard him. But they did not disperse. Social\ngrouping is an instinct in human beings as it is in cattle or in schools\nof fish. Also, when Burl was available there was a sense of pleasant\nconfidence. He had gotten them out of trouble before. If more trouble\ncame, he would get them out of it again. But why look for trouble?\n\nBurl's tribesmen sank back into a contented lethargy. They found food\nand hid themselves until it was all consumed. A part of the valley was\nfound where they were far enough from visible dangers to feel blissfully\nsafe. When they did move, though still with elaborate caution, it was\nonly to forage for food. And they did not need to go far because there\nwas plenty of food. They slipped back. Happier than they had ever been,\nthe foragers finally began to forget to take their new spears or clubs\nwith them. They were furtive vermin in a particularly favorable\nenvironment.\n\nAnd Burl was infuriated. He had known adulation. He was cherished, to be\nsure, but adulation no longer came his way. Even Saya....\n\nAn ironically natural change took place in Saya. When Burl was a\nchieftain, she looked at him with worshipful eyes. Now that he was as\nother men, she displayed coquetry. And Burl was of that peculiarly\ndirect-thinking sort of human being who is capable of leadership but not\nof intrigue. He was vain, of course. But he could not engage in\nelaborate maneuvers to build up a romantic situation. When Saya archly\nremained with the women of the tribe, he considered that she avoided\nhim. When she coyly avoided speech with him, he angrily believed that\nshe did not want his company.\n\nWhen they had been in the valley for a week Burl went off on a bitter\njourney by himself. Part of his motivation, probably, was a childish\nresentment. He had been the great man of the tribe. He was no longer so\ngreat because his particular qualities were not needed. And--perhaps\nwith some unconscious intent to punish them for their lessened\nappreciation--he went off in a pet.\n\nHe still carried spear and club, but the grandeur of his costume had\ndeteriorated. His cloak was gone. The moth-antennae he had worn bound to\nhis forehead were now so draggled that they were ridiculous. He went off\nangrily to be rid of his fellows' indifference.\n\nHe found the upward slopes which were the valley's literal boundaries.\nThey promised nothing. He found a minor valley in which a labyrinth\nspider had built its shining snare. Burl almost scorned the creature. He\ncould kill it if he chose, merely by stabbing it though the walls of\nits silken nest as it waited for unlucky insects to blunder into the\nintricate web. He saw praying-mantises. Once he came upon that\nextraordinary egg-container of the mantis tribe: a gigantic leaf-shaped\nmass of solidified foam, whipped out of some special plastic compound\nwhich the mantis secretes, and in which the eggs are laid.\n\nHe found a caterpillar wrapped in its thick cocoon and, because he was\nnot foraging and not particularly hungry, he inspected it with care.\nWith great difficulty he even broke the strand of silk that formed it,\nunreeling several feet in curiosity. Had he meditated, Burl would have\nseen that this was cord which could be used to build snares as spiders\ndid. It could also be used to make defenses in which--if built strongly\nand well--even hunting-spiders might be tangled and dispatched.\n\nBut again he was not knowingly looking for things to be of use. He\ncoddled his sense of injury against the tribe. He punished them by\nleaving them.\n\nHe encountered a four-foot praying-mantis that raised its saw-toothed\nforelimbs and waited immobile for him to come within reach. He had\ntrouble getting away without a fight. His spear would have been a clumsy\nweapon against so slender a target and the club certainly not quick\nenough to counter the insect's lightning-like movements.\n\nHe was bothered. That day he hunted ants. The difficulty was mainly that\nof finding individual ants, alone, who could be slaughtered without\ndrawing hordes of others into the fight. Before nightfall he had three\nof them--foot-long carcasses--slung at his belt. Near sunset he came\nupon another fairly recent praying-mantis hatchling. It was almost an\nambush. The young monster stood completely immobile and waited for him\nto walk into its reach.\n\nBurl performed a deliberate experiment--something that had not been done\nfor a very long time on the forgotten planet. The small, grisly creature\nstood as high as Burl's shoulders. It would be a deadly antagonist.\nBurl tossed it a dead ant.\n\nIt struck so swiftly that the motion of its horrible forearms could not\nbe seen. Then it ignored Burl, devouring the tidbit.\n\nIt was a discovery that was immediately and urgently useful.\n\nOn the second day of his aimless journey Burl saw something that would\nbe even more deadly and appalling than the red dust had been for his\nkind. It was a female black hunting-spider, the so-called American\ntarantula. When he glimpsed the thing the blood drained from Burl's\nface.\n\nAs the monster moved out of sight Burl, abandoning any other project he\nmight have intended, headed for the place his tribe had more or less\nsettled in. He had news which offered the satisfaction of making him\nmuch-needed again, but he would have traded that pleasure ten hundred\ntimes over for the simple absence of that one creature from this valley.\nThat female tarantula meant simply and specifically that the tribe must\nflee or die. This place was not paradise!\n\nThe entry of the spider into the region had preceded the arrival of the\npeople. A giant, even of its kind, it had come across some pass among\nthe mountains for reasons only it could know. But it was deadliness\nbeyond compare. Its legs spanned yards. The fangs were needle-sharp and\nfeet in length--and poisoned. Its eyes glittered with insatiable, insane\nblood-lust. Its coming was ten times more deadly to the humans--as to\nthe other living creatures of the valley--than a Bengal tiger loosed in\na human city would have been. It was bad enough in itself, but it\nbrought more deadly disaster still behind it.\n\nBumping and bouncing behind its abdomen as it moved, fastened to its\nbody by dirtied silken ropes, this creature dragged a burden which was\nits own ferocity many times multiplied. It was dragging an egg-bag\nlarger than its body--which was feet in diameter. The female spider\nwould carry this ghastly burden--cherishing it--until the eggs hatched.\nAnd then there would be four to five hundred small devils loose in the\nvalley. From the instant of their hatching they would be as deadly as\ntheir parent. Though the offspring would be small--with legs spanning no\nmore than a foot--their bodies would be the size of a man's fist and\nable to leap two yards. Their tiny fangs would be no less envenomed than\ntheir mother's. In stark, maniacal hatred of all other life they would\nat least equal the huge gray horror which had begot them.\n\nBurl told his tribesmen. They listened, eyes large with fright but not\nquite afraid. The thing had not yet happened. When Burl insistently\ncommanded that they follow him on a new journey, they nodded uneasily\nbut slipped away. He could not gather the tribe together. Always there\nwere members who hid from him--and when he went in search of them, the\nones he had gathered vanished before he could return.\n\nThere were days of bright light and murder, and nights of slow rain and\ndeath in the valley. The great creatures under the cloud-bank committed\natrocities upon each other and blandly dined upon their victims.\nUnthinkingly solicitous parents paralyzed creatures to be left living\nand helpless for their young to feed on. There were enormities of\ncruelty done in the matter-of-fact fashion of the insect world. To these\nthings the humans were indifferent. They were uneasy, but like other\nhumans everywhere they would not believe the worst until the worst\narrived.\n\nTwo weeks after their coming to the valley, the worst was there. When\nthat day came the first gray light of dawn found the humans in a\nshivering, terrified group in a completely suicidal position. They were\nout in the open--not hidden but in plain view. They dared not hide any\nmore. The furry gray monster's brood had hatched. The valley seemed to\nswarm with small gray demons which killed and killed, even when they\ncould not devour. When they encountered each other they fought in\nslavering fury and the victors in such duels dined upon their brethren.\nBut always they hunted for more things to kill. They were literally\nmaniacs--and they were too small and too quick to fight with spears or\nclubs.\n\nSo now, at daybreak, the humans looked about despairingly for death to\ncome to them. They had spent the night in the open lest they be trapped\nin the very thickets that had formerly been their protection. They were\nin clear sight of the large gray murderer, if it should pass that way.\nAnd they did not dare hide because of that ogreish creature's brood.\n\nThe monster appeared. A young girl saw it and cried out chokingly. It\nhad not seen them. They watched it leap upon and murder a\nvividly-colored caterpillar near the limit of vision in the\nmorning-mist. It was in the tribe's part of the valley. Its young\nswarmed everywhere. The valley could have been a paradise, but it was\ndoomed to become a charnel-house.\n\nAnd then Burl shook himself. He had been angry when he left his tribe.\nHe had been more angry when he returned and they would not obey him. He\nhad remained with them, petulantly silent, displaying the offended\ndignity he felt and elaborately refusing to acknowledge any overtures,\neven from Saya. Burl had acted rather childishly. But his tribesmen were\nlike children. It was the best way for him to act.\n\nThey shivered, too hopeless even to run away while the shaggy monster\nfeasted a half-mile away. There were six men and seven women besides\nhimself, and the rest were children, from gangling adolescents to one\nbabe in arms. They whimpered a little. Then Saya looked imploringly at\nBurl--coquetry forgotten now. The other whimpered more loudly. They had\nreached that stage of despair, now, when they could draw the monster to\nthem by blubbering in terror.\n\nThis was the psychological moment. Burl said dourly:\n\n\"Come!\"\n\nHe took Saya's hand and started away. There was but one direction in\nwhich any human being could think to move in this valley, at this\nmoment. It was the direction away from the grisly mother of horrors. It\nhappened to be the way up the valley wall. Burl started up that slope.\nSaya went with him.\n\nBefore they had gone ten yards Dor spoke to his wife. They followed\nBurl, with their three children. Five yards more, and Jak agitatedly\nbegan to bustle his family into movement. Old Jon, wheezing, frantically\nscuttled after Burl, and Cori competently set out with the youngest of\nher children in her arms and the others marching before her. Within\nseconds more, all the tribe was in motion.\n\nBurl moved on, aware of his following, but ignoring it. The procession\ncontinued in his wake simply because it had begun to do so. Dik, his\nadolescent brashness beaten down by terror, nevertheless regarded Burl's\nstained weapon with the inevitable envy of the half-grown for\nachievement. He saw something half-buried in the soil and--after a\nfearful glance behind--he moved aside to tug at it. It was part of the\narmor of a former rhinoceros beetle. Tet joined him. They made an act of\ngreat daring of lingering to find themselves weapons as near as possible\nto Burl's.\n\nA quarter-mile on, the fugitives passed a struggling milkweed plant, no\nmore than twenty feet high and already scabrous with scale and rusts\nupon its lower parts. Ants marched up and down its stalk in a steady\nsingle file, placing aphids from their nearby ant-city on suitable spots\nto feed,--and to multiply as only parthenogenic aphids can do. But\nalready, on the far side of the milkweed, an ant-lion climbed up to do\nmurder among them. The ant-lion, of course, was the larval form of a\nlace-wing fly. The aphids were its predestined prey.\n\nBurl continued to march, holding Saya's hand. The reek of formic acid\ncame to his nostrils. He ignored it. Ants were as much prey to his\ntribesmen, now, as crabs and crayfish to other, shore-dwelling tribesmen\non long-forgotten Earth. But Burl was not concerned with food, now. He\nstalked on toward the mountain-slopes.\n\nDik and Tet brandished their new weapons. They looked fearfully behind\nthem. The monster from whom they fled was lost in its gruesome\nfeasting,--and they were a long way from it, now. There was a steady,\nsingle-file procession of ants, with occasional gaps in the line. The\nprocession passed the line through one of those gaps.\n\nBeyond it, Tet and Dik conferred. They dared each other. They went\nscrambling back to the line of ants. Their weapons smote. The\nslaughtered ants died instantly and were quickly dragged from the\nformic-acid-scented path. The remaining ants went placidly on their way.\nThe weapons struck again.\n\nThe two adolescents had to outdo each other. But they had as much food\nas they could carry. Gloating--each claiming to have been most daring\nand to have the largest bag of game--they ran panting after the tribe.\nThey grandly distributed their take of game. It was a form of boasting.\nBut the tribesfolk accepted the gifts automatically. It was, after all,\nfood.\n\nThe two gangling boys, jabbering at each other, raced back once more.\nAgain they returned with dangling masses of foodstuff,--half-scores of\nfoot-long creatures whose limbs, at least, contained firm meat.\n\nBehind, the ant-lion made his onslaught into the stupidly feasting\naphids, and warrior-ants took alarm and thrust forward to offer battle.\nTumult arose upon the milkweed.\n\nBut Burl led his followers toward the mountainside. He reached a minor\neminence and looked about him. Caution was the price of existence on\nthis world.\n\nTwo hundred feet away, a small scurrying horror raged and searched among\nthe rough-edged layers of what on other worlds was called paper-mould or\nrock-tripe. Here it was thick as quilting, and infinitesimal creatures\ndenned under it. The sixteen-inch spider devoured them, making\ngluttonous sounds. But it was busy, and all spiders are relatively\nshort-sighted.\n\nBurl turned to Saya, and realized that all his tribe had followed him\nfearfully even to this small height he'd climbed only to look around\nfrom. Dor had taken advantage of Burl's pause. There was an empty\ncricket-shell partly overwhelmed by the fungoid soil. He tore free a\nnow-hollow, sickle-shaped jaw. It was curved and sharp and deadly if\nproperly wielded. Dor had seen Burl kill things. He had even helped.\nNow, very grimly, he tried to imagine killing something all alone. Jak\nsaw him working on the sickle-shaped weapon. He tugged at the cricket's\nransacked carcass for another weapon. Dik and Tet vaingloriously\npretended to fight between themselves with their recently acquired\ninstruments for killing. Jon wheezed and panted. Old Tama complained to\nherself in whispers, not daring to make sounds in the daylight. The rest\nwaited until Burl should lead them further.\n\nWhen Burl turned angry eyes upon them--he was beginning to do such\nthings deliberately, now--they all regarded him humbly. Now they\nremembered that they had been hungry and he had gotten food for them,\nand they had been paralyzed by terror, and he dared to move. They\ndefinitely had a feeling of dependence upon him, for the present moment\nonly. Later, their feeling of humbleness would diminish. In proportion\nas he met their needs for leadership, they would tend to try to become\nindependent of him. His leadership would be successful in proportion as\nhe taught them to lead themselves. But Burl perceived this only dimly.\nAt the moment it was pleasing to have all his tribe regard him so\nworshipfully, even if not in quite the same fashion as Saya. He was\nsuddenly aware that now--at any rate while they were so frightened--they\nwould obey him. So he invented an order for them to obey.\n\n\"I carry sharp things,\" he said sternly. \"Some of you have gotten sharp\nthings. Now everybody must carry sharp things, to fight with.\"\n\nHumbly, they scattered to obey. Saya would have gone with them, but Burl\nheld her back. He did not quite know why. It could have been that the\nabsolute equality of the sexes in cravenness was due to end, and for his\nown vanity Burl would undertake the defense of Saya. He did not analyze\nso far. He did not want her to leave him, so he prevented it.\n\nThe tribesfolk scattered. Dor went with his wife, to help her arm\nherself. Jak uneasily followed his. Jon went timorously where the\npicked-over remnant of the cricket's carcass might still yield an\ninstrument of defense. Cori laid her youngest child at Burl's feet while\nshe went fearfully to find some toothed instrument meeting Burl's\nspecification of sharpness.\n\nThere was a stifled scream. A ten-year-old boy--he was Dik's younger\nbrother--stood paralyzed. He stared in an agony of horror at something\nthat had stepped from behind a misshapen fungoid object fifty yards from\nBurl, but less than ten yards from him.\n\nIt was a pallidly greenish creature with a small head and enormous eyes.\nIt stood upright, like a man,--and it was a few inches taller than a\nman. Its abdomen swelled gracefully into a leaflike form. The boy faced\nit, paralyzed by horror, and it stood stock-still. Its great, hideously\nspined arms were spread out in a pose of hypocritical benediction.\n\nIt was a partly-grown praying mantis, not too long hatched. It stood\nrigid, waiting benignly for the boy to come closer or try to flee. If\nhe had fled, it would fling itself after him with a ferocity beside\nwhich the fury of a tiger would be kittenish. If he approached, its\nfanged arms would flash down, pierce his body, and hold him terribly\nfast by the needle-sharp hooks that were so much worse than trap-claws.\nAnd of course it would not wait for him to die before it began its meal.\n\nAll the small party of humans stood frozen. It may be questioned whether\nthey were filled with horror for the boy, or cast into a deeper abyss of\ndespair by the sight of a half-grown mantis. Only Burl, so far, had any\nnotion of actually leaving the valley. To the rest, the discovery of one\npartly mature praying mantis meant that there would be hundreds of\nothers. It would be impossible to evade the tiny, slavering demons which\nwere the brood of the great spider. It would be impossibility multiplied\nto live where a horde of small--yet vastly larger--fiends lived, raising\ntheir arms in a semblance of blessing before they did murder.\n\nOnly Burl was capable of thought, and this was because vanity filled\nhim. He had commanded and had been obeyed. Now obedience was forgotten\nbecause there was this young mantis. If the men had dreamed of fighting\nit, it could have destroyed any number of them by sheer ferocity and its\narsenal of knives and daggers. But Burl was at once furious and\nexperienced. He had encountered such a middle-sized monster, when alone,\nand deliberately had experimented with it. In consequence he could dare\nto rage. He ran toward the mantis. He swung the small corpse of an\nant--killed by Tet only minutes since--and hurled it past the\nterror-fascinated boy. He had hurled it at the mantis.\n\nIt struck. And insects simply do not think. Something hurtled at the\nghastly young creature. Its arms struck ferociously to defend itself.\nThe ant was heavy. Poised upright in its spectral attitude, the mantis\nwas literally flung backward. But it rolled over, fighting the dead ant\nwith that frenzy which is not so much ferocity as mania.\n\nThe small boy fled, hysterically, once the insect's attention was\ndiverted.\n\nThe human tribe gathered around Burl many hundreds of yards away,--again\nuphill. He was their rendezvous because of the example set by Cori. She\nhad left her baby with Burl. When Burl dashed from the spot, Saya had\nquite automatically followed the instinct of any female for the young of\nits kind. She'd snatched up the baby before she fled. And--of\ncourse--she'd joined Burl when the immediate danger was over.\n\nThe floor of the valley seemed a trifle indistinct, from here. The mist\nthat hung always in the air partly veiled the details of its horrors. It\nwas less actual, not quite as deadly as it once had seemed.\n\nBurl said fiercely to his followers:\n\n\"Where are the sharp things?\"\n\nThe tribesfolk looked at one another, numbly. Then Jon muttered\nrebelliously, and old Tama raised her voice in shrill complaint. Burl\nhad led them to this! There had been only the red dust in the place from\nwhich they had come, but here was a hunting-spider and its young and\nalso a new hatching of mantises! They could dodge the red dust, but how\ncould they escape the deaths that waited them here? Ai! Ai! Burl had\npersuaded them to leave their home and brought them here to die....\n\nBurl glared about him. It was neither courage nor resolution, but he had\ncome to realize that to be admired by one's fellows was a splendid\nsensation. The more one was admired, the better. He was enraged that\nanyone dared to despair instead of thinking admiringly about his\nremarkableness.\n\n\"I,\" said Burl haughtily, \"am not going to stay here. I go to a place\nwhere there are neither spiders nor mantises. Come!\"\n\nHe held out his hand to Saya. She gave the child to Cori and confidently\nmoved to follow him. Burl stalked grandly away and she went with him. He\nwent uphill. Naturally! There were spiders and mantises in the\nvalley,--so many that to stay there meant death. So he moved to go\nsomewhere else.\n\nAnd this was the climactic event that changed the whole history of\nhumanity upon the forgotten planet. Up to this point, there may have\nbeen other individuals who had accomplished somewhat of Burl's kind of\nleadership. A few may have learned courage. It is possible that some\neven led their tribesfolk upon migrations in search of safer lands to\nlive in. But until Burl led his people out of a valley filled with food,\nup a mountainside toward the unknown, it was simply impossible for\nhumans to rise permanently above the status of hunted vermin; at the\nmercy of monstrous mindless creatures; whose forbears had most\nironically been brought to this planet to prepare it for humans to live\non.\n\nBurl was the first man to lead his fellows toward the heights.\n\n\n\n\n_9. THERE IS SUCH A THING AS SUNSHINE_\n\n\nThe sun that shone upon the forgotten planet was actually very near. It\nshone on the top of the cloud-bank, and the clouds glowed with dazzling\nwhiteness. It shone on the mountain-peaks where they penetrated the\nmist, and the peaks were warmed, and there was no snow anywhere despite\nthe height. There were winds, here where the sun yielded sensible heat.\nThe sky was very blue. At the edge of the plateau--from which the\ncloud-banks were down instead of up--the mountainsides seemed to descend\ninto a sea of milk. Great undulations in the mist had the semblance of\nwaves, which moved with great deliberation toward the shores. They\nseemed sometimes to break in slow-motion against the mountain-walls\nwhere they were cliff-like, and sometimes they seemed to flow up gentler\ninclinations like water flowing up a beach. But all of this was very\ndeliberate indeed, because the cloud-waves were sometimes twenty miles\nfrom crest to crest.\n\nThe look of things was different on the highlands. This part of the\nunnamed world, no less than the lowlands, had been seeded with life on\ntwo separate occasions. Once the seedings was with bacteria and moulds\nand lichens to break up the rocks and make soil of them, and once with\nseeds and insect-eggs and such living things as might sustain themselves\nimmediately they were hatched. But here on the highlands the different\nclimatic conditions had allowed other seedlings and creatures to survive\ntogether.\n\nHere moulds and yeasts and rusts were stunted by the sunlight. Grasses\nand weeds and trees survived, instead. This was an ideal environment for\nplants that needed sunlight to form chlorophyl, with which to make use\nof the soil that had been formed. So on the highlands the vegetation was\nalmost earthlike. And there was a remarkable side-effect on the fauna\nwhich had been introduced in the same manner and at the same time as the\ncreatures down below. In coolness which amounted to a temperate climate,\nthere developed no such frenzy of life as made the nightmare jungles\nunder the clouds. Plants grow at a slower rate than fungi, and less\nluxuriantly. There was no vast supply of food for large-sized\nplant-eaters. Insects which were to survive, here, could not grow to be\nmonsters. Moreover, the nights here were chill. Very many insects grow\ntorpid in the cool of a temperate-zone night, but warm up to activity\nsoon after sunrise. But a large creature, made torpid by cold, will not\nrevive so quickly. If large enough, it will not become fully active\nuntil close to dark. On the plateau, the lowland monsters would starve\nin any case. But more;--they would have only a fraction of each day of\nfull activity.\n\nSo there was a necessary limit to the size of the creatures that lived\nabove the clouds. To humans from other planets, the life on the plateau\nwould not have seemed horrifying at all. Save for the absence of birds\nto sing, and a lack of small mammals to hunt or merely to enjoy, the\nuntouched, sunlit plateau with its warm days and briskly chill nights\nwould have impressed most civilized men as an ideal habitation.\n\nBut Burl and his followers were hardly prepared to see it that way at\nfirst glance. If told about it in advance, they would have thought of it\nwith despair.\n\nBut they did not know beforehand. They toiled upward, their leader moved\nby such ridiculous motives of pride and vanity as have caused men to\nachieve greatness throughout all history. Two great continents were\ndiscovered back on Earth by a man trying to get spices to hide the gamey\nflavor of half-spoiled meat, and the power that drives mile-long\nspace-craft was first discovered and tamed by men making bombs to\ndestroy their fellows. There were precedents for foolish motives\nproducing results far from foolishness.\n\nThe trudging, climbing folk crawled up the hillside. They reached a\nplace high above the valley Burl had led them to. That valley grew misty\nin appearance. Presently it could no longer be seen at all. The mist\nthey had taken for granted, all their lives, hid from them everything\nbut the slanting stony wall up which they climbed. The stone was mostly\ncovered by bluish-green rock-tripe in partly overlapping sheets. Such\nstuff is always close behind the bacteria which first attack a\nrock-face. On a slope, it clings while soil is washed downward as fast\nas it is formed. The people never ate rock-tripe, of course. It produces\nfrightening cramps. In time they might learn that when thoroughly dried\nit can be cooked to pliability again and eaten with some satisfaction.\nBut so far they neither knew dryness nor fire.\n\nNor had they ever known such surroundings as presently enveloped them. A\nslanting rocky mountainside, which stretched up frighteningly to the\nvery sky. Grayness overhead. Grayness also to one side,--the side away\nfrom the mountain. And equal grayness below. The valley from which they\nhad come could no longer be seen even as a different shading of the\nmist. And as they scrambled and trudged after Burl, his followers\ngradually became aware of the utter strangeness of all about them. For\none result, they grew sick and dizzy. To them it seemed that all\nsolidity was slowly tilting. Had they been superstitious, they might\nhave thought of demons preparing to punish them for daring to come to\nsuch a place. But--quaintly enough--Burl's followers had developed no\ndemonology. Your typical savage is resolved not to think, but he does\nhave leisure to want. He makes gods and devils out of his nightmares,\nand gambles on his own speculations to the extent of offering blackmail\nto demons if they will only let him alone or--preferably--give him more\nof the things he wants.\n\nBut the superstitions of savages involve the payment of blackmail in\nexact proportion to their prosperity. The Eskimos of Earth lived always\non the brink of starvation. They could not afford the luxury of tabus\nand totem animals whose flesh must not be eaten, and forbidden areas\nwhich might contain food.\n\nReligion there was, among Burl's people, but superstition was not. No\nhumans, anywhere, can live without religion, but on Earth Eskimos did\nwith a minimum of superstitions,--they could afford no more--and the\nhumans of the forgotten planet could not afford any at all.\n\nTherefore they climbed desperately despite the unparalleled state of\nthings about them. There was no horizon, but they had never seen a\nhorizon. Their feeling was that what had been \"down\" was now partly\n\"behind\" and they feared lest a toppling universe ultimately let them\nfall toward that grayness they considered the sky.\n\nBut all kept on. To lag behind would be to be abandoned in this place\nwhere all known sensations were turned topsy-turvy. None of them could\nimagine turning back. Even old Tama, whimpering in a whisper as she\nstruggled to keep up, merely complained bitterly of her fate. She did\nnot even think of revolt. If Burl had stopped, all his followers would\nhave squatted down miserably to wait for death. They had no thought of\nadventure or any hope of safety. The only goodnesses they could imagine\nwere food and the nearness of other humans. They had food--nobody had\nabandoned any of the dangling ant-bodies Tet and Dik had distributed\nbefore the climb began. They would not be separated from their fellows.\n\nBurl's motivation was hardly more distinct. He had started uphill in a\njudicious mixture of fear and injured vanity and desperation. There was\nnothing to be gained by going back. The terrors at hand were no greater\nthan those behind, so there was no reason not to go ahead.\n\nThey came to a place where the mountain-flank sank inward. There was a\nflat space, and behind it a winding ca\u00f1on of sorts like a vast crack in\nthe mountain's substance. Burl breasted the curving edge and found\nflatness beyond it. He stopped short.\n\nThe mouth of the ca\u00f1on was perhaps fifty yards from the lip of the\ndownward slope. So much space was practically level, and on it were\ntoadstools and milkweed--two of them--and there was food. It was a\nsmall, isolated asylum for life such as they were used to. They\ncould--it was possible that they could--have found a place of safety\nhere.\n\nBut the possibility was not the fact. They saw the spider-web at once.\nIt was slung between the opposite ca\u00f1on-walls by cables all of two\nhundred feet long. The radiating cables reached down to anchorages on\nstone. The snare-threads, winding out and out in that logarithmic spiral\nwhose properties men were so astonished to discover, were fully a yard\napart. The web was for giant game. It was empty now, but Burl saw the\ntelegraph-cord which ran from the very center of the web to the\nweb-maker's lurking-place. There was a rocky shelf on the ca\u00f1on-wall. On\nit rested the spider, almost invisible against the stone, with one furry\nleg touching the cable. The slightest touch on any part of the web would\nwarn it instantly.\n\nBurl's followers accumulated behind him. Old Jon's wheezing was audible.\nTama ceased her complaints to survey this spot. It might be--it could\nbe--a haven, and she would have to find new and different things to\ncomplain about in consequence. The spider-web itself, of course, was no\nreason for them to be alarmed. Web-spiders do not hunt. Their males do,\nbut they are rarely in the neighborhood of a web save at mating-time.\nThe web itself was no reason not to settle here. But there was a reason.\n\nThe ground before the web,--between the web and themselves--was a\ncharnel-house of murdered creatures. Half-inch-thick wing-cases of dead\nbeetles and the cleaned-out carapaces of other giants. The ovipositor of\nan ichneumon-fly,--see feet of springy, slender, deadly-pointed\ntube--and the abdomen-plates of bees and the draggled antennae of moths\nand butterflies.\n\nSomething very terrible lived in this small place. The mountainsides\nwere barren of food for big flying things. Anything which did fly this\nhigh for any reason would never land on sloping foodless stone.\nIt would land here. And very obviously it would die. Because\nsomething--Something--killed things as they came. It denned back in the\nca\u00f1on where they could not see it. It dined here.\n\nThe humans looked and shivered, all but Burl. He cast his eyes about for\nbetter weapons than he possessed. He chose for himself a magnificent\nlance grown by some dead thing for its own defense. He pulled it out of\nthe ground.\n\nIt was utterly silent, here on the heights. No sounds from the valley\nrose so high. There was no noise except the small creakings made as Burl\nstrove to free the new, splendid weapon for himself.\n\nThat was why he heard the gasp which somebody uttered in default of a\nscream that would not be uttered. It was a choked, a strangled, an\ninarticulate sobbing noise.\n\nHe saw its cause.\n\nThere was a thing moving toward the folk from the recesses of the ca\u00f1on.\nIt moved very swiftly. It moved upon stilt-like, impossibly attenuated\nlegs of impossible length and inconceivable number. Its body was the\nthickness of Burl's own. And from it came a smell of such monstrous\nfoetor that any man, smelling it, would gag and flee even without fear\nto urge him on. The creature was a monstrous millipede, forty feet in\nlength, with features of purest, unadulterated horror.\n\nIt did not appear to plan to spring. Its speed of movement did not\nincrease as it neared the tribesfolk. It was not rushing, like the\nfurious charge of the murderers Burl's tribe knew. It simply flowed\nsinuously toward them with no appearance of haste, but at a rate of\nspeed they could not conceivably outrun.\n\nSticklike legs twitched upward and caught the spinning body of an ant.\nThe creature stopped, and turned its head about and seized the object\nits side-legs had grasped. It devoured it. Burl shouted again and again.\n\nThere was a rain of missiles upon the creature. But they were not to\nhurt it, but to divert its incredibly automaton-like attention. Its legs\nseized the things flung to it. It was not possible to miss. Ten,\nfifteen,--twenty of the items of small-game were grasped in mid-air, as\nif they were creatures in flight.\n\nBurl's shoutings took effect. His people fled to the side of the level\nlip of ground. They climbed frantically past the opening of the valley.\nThey fled toward the heights.\n\nBurl was the last to retreat. The monstrous millipede stood immobile,\ntrapped for the moment by the gratification of all its desires. It was\nabsorbed by the multitude of tiny tidbits with which it had been\nprovided.\n\nIt was a fact to Burl's honor that he debated a frantic attack upon the\nmonster in its insane absorption. But the strangling stench was\ndeterrent enough. He fled,--the last of his band of fugitives to leave\nthe place where the monstrous creature lived and preyed. As he left it,\nit was still crunching the small meals, one by one, with which the folk\nhad supplied it.\n\nThey went on up the mountain-flank. It was not to be supposed, of\ncourse, that the creature could not move above the slanting\nrock-surface. Unquestionably it roamed far and wide, upon occasion. But\nits own foetid reek would make impossible any idea of trailing the\nhumans by scent. And, climbing desperately as the humans did, it would\nbe unable to see them when they were past the first protuberance of the\nmountain.\n\nIn twenty minutes they slackened their pace. Exhaustion prompted it.\nCaution ordered it. Because here they saw another small island of\nflatness in the slanting universe which was all they could see save\nmist. It was simply a place where boulders had piled up, and soil had\nformed, and there was a miniature haven for life other than moulds which\ncould grow on naked stone.\n\nActually, there was a space a hundred feet by fifty on which wholly\nfamiliar mushrooms grew. It was a thicket like a detached section of the\nvalley itself. Well-known edible fungi grew here. There were gray\npuffballs. And from it came the cheerful loud chirping of some small\nbeetle, arrived at this spot nobody could possibly know how, but happily\nensconsed in a separate bit of mushroom-jungle remote from the dangers\nof the valley. If it was small enough, it would even be safe from the\nreeking horror of the ca\u00f1on just below it.\n\nThey broke off edible mushrooms here and ate. And this could have been\nsafety for them--save for the giant millipede no more than half a mile\nbelow. Old Jon wheezed querulously that here was food and there was no\nneed for them to go further, just now. Here was food....\n\nBurl regarded him with knitted brows. Jon's reaction was natural enough.\nThe tribesfolk had never tended to think for the future because it was\nimpossible to make use of such planning. Even Burl could easily enough\nhave accepted the fact that this was safety for the moment and food for\nthe moment. But it happened that to settle down here until driven out\nwould--and at this moment--have deprived him of the authority he had so\nrecently learned to enjoy.\n\n\"You stay,\" he said haughtily, to Jon. \"I go on, to a better place where\nnothing is to be feared at all!\"\n\nHe held out his hand to Saya. He assailed the slope again, heading\nupward in the mist.\n\nHis tribe followed him. Dik and Tet, of course, because they were boys\nand Burl led on to high adventures in which so far nobody had been\nkilled. Dor followed because--he being the strongest man in the\ntribe--he had thoughtfully realized that his strength was not as useful\nas Burl's brains and other qualities. Cori followed because she had\nchildren, and they were safer where Burl led than anywhere else. The\nothers followed to avoid being left alone.\n\nThe procession toiled on and up. Presently Burl noticed that the air\nseemed clearer, here. It was not the misty, only half transparent stuff\nof the valley. He could see for miles to right and left. He realized the\ncurvature of the mountain-face. But he could not see the valley. The\nmist hid that.\n\nSuddenly he realized that he saw the cloud-bank overhead as an object.\nHe had never thought of it specifically before. To him it had been\nsimply the sky. Now he saw an indefinite lower surface which yet\ndefinitely hid the heights toward which he moved. He and his followers\nwere less than a thousand feet below it. It appeared to Burl that\npresently he would run into an obstacle which would simply keep him from\ngoing any further. The idea was disheartening. But until it happened he\nobstinately climbed on.\n\nHe observed that the thing which was the sky did not stay still. It\nmoved, though slowly. A little higher, he could see that there were\nparts of it which were actually lower than he was. They moved also, but\nthey moved away from him as often as they moved toward him. He had no\nexperience of any dangerous thing which did not leap at its victims.\nTherefore he was not afraid.\n\nIn fact, presently he noticed that the whiteness which was the\ncloud-layer seemed to retreat before him. He was pleased. Weak things\nlike humans fled from enemies. Here was something which fled at his\napproach! His followers undoubtedly saw the same thing. Burl had killed\nspiders. He was a remarkable person. This unknown white stuff was afraid\nof him. Therefore it was wise to stay close to Burl. Burl found his\nvanity inflamed by the fact that always--even at its thickest--the white\ncloud-stuff never came nearer than some dozens of feet. He swaggered as\nhe led his people up.\n\nAnd presently there was brightness about them. It was a greater\nbrightness than the tribesfolk had ever known. They knew daylight as a\ngrayness in which one could see. Here was a brightness that shone. They\nwere not accustomed to brightness.\n\nThey were not accustomed to silence, either. The noises of the valley\nwere like all the noises of the lowlands. They had been in the ears of\nevery one of the human beings since they could hear at all. They had\ngradually diminished as the valley dropped behind them. Now, in the\nradiant white mist which was the cloud-layer, there were no sounds at\nall, and the fact was suddenly startling.\n\nThey blinked in the brightness. When they spoke to each other, they\nspoke in whispers. The stone underfoot was not even lichen-covered,\nhere. It was bare and bright and glistened with wetness. The light they\nexperienced took on a golden tint. All of these things were utterly\nunparalleled, but the stillness was a hush instead of a menacing\nsilence. The golden light could not possibly be associated with fear.\nThe people of the forgotten planet felt, most likely, the sort of\npromise in this shining tranquility which before they had known only in\ndreams. But this was no dream.\n\nThey came up through the surface of a sea of mist, and they saw before\nthem a shore of sunshine. They saw blue and sky and sunlight for the\nfirst time. The light smote their shins and brilliantly colored furry\ngarments. It glittered in changing, ever-more-colorful flashes upon\ncloaks made of butterfly wings. It sparkled on the great lance carried\nby Burl in the lead, and the quite preposterous weapons borne by his\nfollowers.\n\nThe little party of twenty humans waded ashore through the last of the\nthinning white stuff which was cloud. They gazed about them with\nwondering, astonished eyes. The sky was blue. There was green grass. And\nagain there was sound. It was the sound of wind blowing among trees, and\nof things living in the sunshine.\n\nThey heard insects, but they did not know what they heard. The shrill\nsmall musical whirrings; the high-pitched small cries which made an\nelfin melody everywhere,--these were totally strange. All things were\nnew to their eyes, and an enormous exultation filled them. From\ndeep-buried ancestral memories they somehow knew that what they saw was\nright, was normal, was appropriate and proper, and that this was the\nkind of world in which humans belonged, rather than the seething horror\nof the lowlands. They breathed clean air for the first time in many\ngenerations.\n\nBurl shouted in his triumph, and his voice echoed among trees and\nhillsides.\n\nIt was time for the plateau to ring with the shouting of a man in\ntriumph!\n\n\n\n\n_10. MEN CLIMB UP TO SAVAGERY_\n\n\nThey had food for days. They had brought mushroom from the isolated\nthicket not too far beneath the clouds. There were the ants that Dik and\nTet had distributed grandly, and not all of which had been used to\nsecure escape from the ca\u00f1on of the millipede. Had they found other food\nimmediately, they would have settled down comfortably in the fashion\nnormal to creatures whose idea of bliss is a secure hiding-place and\nfood on hand so they do not have to leave it. Somehow they believed that\nthis high place of bright light and new colors was secure. But they had\nno hiding-place. And though they did accept with the unreasoning faith\nof children and savages that there were no enemies here, they still\nwanted one.\n\nThey found a cave. It was small, so that it would be crowded with all of\nthem in it, but as it turned out, this was fortunate. At some time it\nhad been occupied by some other creature, but the dirt which floored it\nhad settled flat and showed no tracks. It retained faint traces of a\nsmell which was unfamiliar but not unpleasing,--it held no connotation\nof danger. Ants stank of formic acid plus the musky odor of their\nparticular city. One could identify not only the kind of ant, but its\nhome city, by sniffing at an ant-trail. Spiders had their own\nhair-raising odor. The smell of a praying-mantis was acrid, and all\nbeetles reeked of decay. And of course there were those bugs whose main\ndefense was an effluvium which tended to strangle all but the smell's\nhappy possessor. This faint smell in the cave was different. The humans\nthought vaguely that it might possibly be another kind of man.\n\nActually, it was the smell of a warm-blooded animal. But Burl and his\nfellows knew of no warm-blooded creature but themselves.\n\nThey had come above the clouds a bare two hours before sunset,--of which\nthey knew nothing. For an hour they marveled, staying close together.\nThey were especially astounded by the sun, since they could not bear to\nlook at it. But presently, being savages, they accepted it\nmatter-of-factly.\n\nThey could not cease to wonder at the vegetation about them. They were\naccustomed only to gigantic fungi and the few straggling plants which\ntried so desperately to bear seed before they were devoured. Here they\nsaw many plants and no fungi,--and they did not see anything they\nrecognized as insects. They looked only for large things.\n\nThey were astounded by the slenderness and toughness of the plants.\nGrass fascinated them, and weeds. A large part of their courage came\nfrom the absence of debris upon the ground. The hunting-grounds of\nspiders were marked by grisly remnants of finished meals, and where\nmantises roamed there were bits of transparent beetle-wings and sharp\nspiny bits of armor not tasty enough to be consumed. Here, in the first\nhour of their exploration, they saw no sign that an insect like\nthe lowland ones had ever been in this place at all. But they\ncould not believe the monsters never came. They correctly--and\npessimistically--assumed that their coming was only rare.\n\nThe cave was a great relief. Trees did not grow close enough to give\nthem a feeling of safety,--though they were ludicrously amazed at the\ninvincible hardness of tree trunks. They had never known anything but\ninsect-armour and stone which was as hard as the trunks of those\ngrowing things. They found nothing to eat, but they were not yet\nhungry. They did not worry about food while they still had remnants from\ntheir climb.\n\nWhen the sun sank low and crimson colorings filled the west, they were\nless happy. They watched the glory of their first sunset with scared,\nincredulous eyes. Yellows and reds and purples reared toward the zenith.\nIt became possible to look at the sun directly. They saw it descend\nbehind something they could not guess at. Then there was darkness.\n\nThe fact stunned them. So night came like this!\n\nThen they saw the stars for the first time, as they came singly into\nbeing. And the folk from the lowland crowded frantically into the cave\nwith its faint odor of having once been occupied by something else. They\nfilled the cave tightly. But Burl had some reluctance to admit his\nterror. He and Saya were the last to enter.\n\nAnd nothing happened. Nothing. The sounds of sunset continued. They were\nstrange but soothing and somehow--again ancestral memory spoke\ncomfortingly--they were the way night-sounds ought to be. Burl and the\nothers could not possibly know it, but for the first time in forty\ngenerations on the forgotten planet, human beings were in an environment\nreally suited to them. It had a rightness and a goodness which was\nobvious in spite of its novelty. And because of Burl's own special\nexperiences, he was a little bit better able to estimate novelties than\nthe rest. He listened to the night-noises from close by the cave's small\nentrance. He heard the breathing of his tribesfolk. He felt the heat of\ntheir bodies, keeping the crowded enclosure warm enough for all. Saya\nheld fast to his hand, for the reassurance of the contact. He was\nwakeful, and thinking very busily and painfully, but Saya was not\nthinking at all. She was simply proud of Burl.\n\nShe felt, to be sure, a tumult which was fear of the unknown and relief\nfrom much greater fear of the familiar. She felt warm, prideful\nmemories of the sight of Burl leading and commanding the others. She had\nabsorbing fresh memories of the look and feel of sunshine, and mental\npictures of sky and grass and trees which she had never seen before.\nConfusedly she remembered that Burl had killed a spider, no less, and he\nhad shown how to escape a praying-mantis by flinging it at an ant, and\nhe had grandly led the others up a mountainside it had never occurred to\nanybody else to climb. And the giant millipede would have devoured them\nall, but that Burl gave commands and set the example, and he had marched\nmagnificently up the mountainside when it seemed that all the cosmos\ntwisted and prepared to drop them into an inverted sky....\n\nSaya dozed. And Burl sat awake, listening, and presently with\nfast-beating heart he slipped out of the entrance to the cave and stared\nabout him in the night.\n\nThere was coolness such as he had never known before, but nightfall was\nnot long past. There were smells in the air he had never before\nexperienced,--green things growing, and the peculiar clean odor of wind\nthat has been bathed in sunshine, and the oddly satisfying smell of\nresinous trees.\n\nBut Burl raised his eyes to the heavens. He saw the stars in all their\nglory, and he was the first human in two thousand years and more to look\nat them from this planet. There were myriads upon myriads of them,\nvarying in brightness from stabbing lights to infinitesimal twinklings.\nThey were of every possible color. They hung in the sky above him,\nimmobile and unthreatening. They had not descended. They were very\nbeautiful.\n\nBurl stared. And then he noticed that he was breathing deeply, with a\nnew zest. He was filling his lungs with clean, cool, fragrant air such\nas men were intended to breathe from the beginning, and of which Burl\nand many others had been deprived. It was almost intoxicating to feel so\nsplendidly alive and unafraid.\n\nThere was a slight sound. Saya stood beside him, trembling a little. To\nleave the others had required great courage, but she had come to realize\nthat if Burl was in danger she wished to share it.\n\nThey heard the nightwind and the orchestra of night-singers. They\nwandered aside from the cave-mouth and Saya found completely primitive\nand satisfying pride in the courage of Burl, who was actually not afraid\nof the dark! Her own uneasiness became something which merely added\nsavor to her pride in him. She followed him wherever he went, to examine\nthis and consider that in the nighttime. It gave her enormous\nsatisfaction at once to think of danger and to feel so safe because of\nhis nearness.\n\nPresently they heard a new sound in the night. It was very far away, and\nnot in the least like any sound they had ever heard before. It changed\nin pitch as insect-cries do not. It was a baying, yelping sound. It\nrose, and held the higher note, and abruptly dropped in pitch before it\nceased. Minutes later it came again.\n\nSaya shivered, but Burl said thoughtfully:\n\n\"That is a good sound.\"\n\nHe didn't know why. Saya shivered again. She said reluctantly:\n\n\"I am cold.\"\n\nIt had been a rare sensation in the lowlands. It came only after one of\nthe infrequent thunderstorms, when wetted human bodies were exposed to\nthe gusty winds that otherwise never blew. But here the nights grew cold\nafter sundown. The heat of the ground would radiate to outer space with\nno clouds to intercept it, and before dawn the temperature might drop\nnearly to freezing. On a planet so close to its sun, however, there\nwould hardly be more than light hoar-frost at any time.\n\nThe two of them went back to the cave. It was warm there, because of the\nclose packing of bodies and many breaths. Burl and Saya found places to\nrest and dozed off, Saya's hand again trustfully in Burl's.\n\nHe still remained awake for a long time. He thought of the stars, but\nthey were too strange to estimate. He thought of the trees and grass.\nBut most of his impressions of this upper world were so remote from\nprevious knowledge that he could only accept them as they were and defer\nreflecting upon them until later. He did feel an enormous complacency at\nhaving led his followers here, though.\n\nBut the last thing he actually thought about, before his eyes blinked\nshut in sleep, was that distant howling noise he had heard in the night.\nIt was totally novel in kind, and yet there was something buried among\nthe items of his racial heritage that told him it was good.\n\nHe was first awake of all the tribesmen and he looked out into the cold\nand pallid grayness of before-dawn. He saw trees. One side was brightly\nlighted by comparison, and the other side was dark. He heard the tiny\nsinging noises of the inhabitants of this place. Presently he crawled\nout of the cave again.\n\nThe air was biting in its chill. It was an excellent reason why the\ngiant insects could not live here, but it was invigorating to Burl as he\nbreathed it in. Presently he looked curiously for the source of the\npeculiar one-sided light.\n\nHe saw the top of the sun as it peered above the eastern cloud-bank. The\nsky grew lighter. He blinked and saw it rise more fully into view. He\nthought to look upward, and the stars that had bewildered him were\nnearly gone.\n\nHe ran to call Saya.\n\nThe rest of the tribe waked as he roused her. One by one, they followed\nto watch their first sunrise. The men gaped at the sun as it filled the\neast with colorings, and rose and rose above the seemingly steaming\nlayer of clouds, and then appeared to spring free of the horizon and\nswim on upward.\n\nThe women stared with all their eyes. The children blinked, and\nshivered, and crept to their mothers for warmth. The women enclosed them\nin their cloaks, and they thawed and peered out once more at the glory\nof sunshine and the day. Very soon, too, they realized that warmth came\nfrom the great shining body in the sky. The children presently\ndiscovered a game. It was the first game they had ever played. It\nconsisted of running into a shaded place until they shivered, and then\nof running out into warm sunshine once more. Until this, dawning fear\nwas the motive for such playing as they did. Now they gleefully made a\ngame of sunshine.\n\nIn this first morning of their life above the clouds, the tribesmen ate\nof the food they had brought from below. But there was not an indefinite\namount of food left. Burl ate, and considered darkly, and presently\nsummoned his followers' attention. They were quite contented and for the\nmoment felt no need of his guidance. But he felt need of admiration.\n\nHe spoke abruptly:\n\n\"We do not want to go back to the place we came from,\" he said sternly.\n\"We must look for food here, so we can stay for always. Today we find\nfood.\"\n\nIt was a seizure of the initiative. It was the linking of what the folk\nmost craved with obedience to Burl. It was the device by which dictators\nseize power, and it was the instinctive action of a leader.\n\nThe eating men murmured agreement. There was a certain definite idea of\ngoodness--not virtue, but of things desirable--associated with what Burl\ndid and what he commanded. His tribe was gradually forming a habit of\nobedience, though it was a very fragile habit up to now.\n\nHe led them exploring as soon as they had eaten. All of them, of course.\nThey straggled irregularly behind him. They came to a brook and regarded\nit with amazement. There were no leeches. No greenish algae. No foaming\nmasses of scum. It was dear! Greatly daring, Burl tasted it. He drank\nthe first really potable water in a very long time for his race on this\nplanet. It was not fouled by drainage through moulds or rusts.\n\nDor drank after him. Jak. Cori tasted, and instantly bade her children\ndrink. Even old Tama drank suspiciously, and then raised her voice in\nshrill complaint that Burl had not led them to this place sooner. Tet\nand Dik became convinced that there were no deadly things lurking in it,\nand splashed each other. Dik slipped and sat down hard on white stuff\nthat yielded and almost splashed. He got up and looked fearfully at what\nhe thought might be a deadly slime. Then he yelped shrilly.\n\nHe sat down on and crushed part of a bed of mushrooms. But they were\ntiny, clean, and appetizing. They were miniatures of the edible\nmushrooms the tribe fed on.\n\nBurl smelled and finally tasted one. It was, of course, nothing more or\nless than a perfectly normal edible mushroom, growing to the size that\nmushrooms originally grew on Earth. It grew on a shaded place in\nenormously rich soil. It had been protected from direct sunlight by\ntrees, but it had not had the means or the stimulus to become a monster.\n\nBurl ate it. He carefully composed his features. Then he announced the\nfind to his followers. There was food here, he told them sternly, but in\nthis splendid world to which he had led them, food was small. There\nwould be no great enemies here, but the food would have to be sought in\nsmall objects instead of great ones. They must look at this place and\nseek others like it, in order to find food....\n\nThe tribesmen were doubtful. But they plucked mushrooms--whole\nones!--instead of merely breaking off parts of their tops. With deep\nastonishment they recognized the miniature objects as familiar things\nensmalled. These mushrooms had the same savor, but they were not coarse\nor stringy or tough like the giants. They melted in the mouth; Life in\nthis place to which Burl had led them was delectable! Truly the doings\nof Burl were astonishing!\n\nWhen the oldest of Cori's children found a beetle on a leaf, and they\nrecognized it, and instead of being bigger than a man and a thing to\nflee from, it was less than an inch in size and helpless against them--.\nThey were entranced. From that moment onward they would really follow\nBurl anywhere, in the happy conviction that he could only bring good to\neverybody.\n\nThe opinion could have drawbacks, and it need not be always even true,\nbut Burl did nothing to discourage it.\n\nAnd then, near midday, they made a discovery even greater than that of\nfamiliar food in unfamiliar sizes. They were struggling, at the time,\nthrough a vast patch of bushes with thorns on them--they were not used\nto thorns--which they deeply distrusted. Eventually they would find out\nthat the glistening dark fruit were blackberries, and would rejoice in\nthem, but at this first encounter they were uneasy. In the midst of such\nan untouched berry-patch they heard noises in the distance.\n\nThe sound was made up of cries of varying pitch, some of which were loud\nand abrupt, and others longer and less loud. The people did not\nunderstand them in the least. They could have been cries of human\nbeings, perhaps, but they were not cries of pain. Also they were not\nlanguage. They seemed to express a tremendous, zestful excitement. They\nhad no overtone of horror. And Burl and his folk had known of no\nexcitement among insects except frenzy. They could not imagine what sort\nof tumult this could be.\n\nBut to Burl these sounds had something of the timbre of the yelping\nnoises of the night before. He had felt drawn to that sound. He liked\nit. He liked this.\n\nHe led the way boldly toward the agitated noises. Presently--after a\nmile or so--he and his people came out of breast-high weeds. Saya was\nimmediately behind him. The others trailed,--Tama complaining bitterly\nthat there was no need to track down sounds which could only mean\ndanger. They emerged in a space of bare stone above a small and grassy\namphitheatre. The tumult came from its center.\n\nA pack of dogs was joyously attacking something that Burl could not see\nclearly. They were dogs. They barked zestfully, and they yelped and\nsnarled and yapped in a dozen different voices, and they were having a\nthoroughly good time,--though it might not be so good for the thing they\nattacked.\n\nOne of them sighted the humans. He stopped stock-still and barked. The\nothers whirled and saw the humans as they came out into view. The tumult\nceased abruptly.\n\nThere was silence. The tribesmen saw creatures with four legs only. They\nhad never before seen any living thing with fewer than six,--except men.\nSpiders had eight. The dogs did not have mandibles. They did not have\nwing-cases. They did not act like insects. It was stupifying!\n\nAnd the dogs saw men, whom they had never seen before. Much more\nimportant, they smelled men. And the difference between man-smell and\ninsect-smell was so vast--because through hundreds of generations the\ndogs had not smelled anything with warm blood save their own kind--the\ndifference in smell was so great in kind that the dogs did not react\nwith suspicion, but with a fascinated curiosity. This was an\nunparalleled smell. It was, even in its novelty, an overwhelmingly\nsatisfying smell.\n\nThe dogs regarded the men with their heads on one side, sniffing in the\ndeepest possible amazement,--amazement so intense that they could not\npossibly feel hostility. One of them whined a little because he did not\nunderstand.\n\n\n\n\n_11. WARM BLOOD IS A BOND_\n\n\nPeculiarly enough, it was a matter of topography. The plateau which\nreached above the clouds rose with a steep slope from the valley from\nwhich a hunting-spider's brood had driven the men. This was on the\neastern edge of the plateau. On the west, however, the highland was\nsubject to an indentation which almost severed it. No more than twenty\nmiles from where Burl's group had climbed to sunshine, there was a much\nmore gradual slope downward. There, mushroom-forests grew almost to the\ncloud-layer. From there, giant insects strayed up and onto the plateau\nitself.\n\nThey could not live above the clouds, of course. There was not food\nenough for their insatiable hunger. Especially at night, it was too cold\nto allow them to stay active. But they did stray from their normal\nenvironment, and some of them did reach the sunshine, and perhaps some\nof them blundered back down to their mushroom-forests again. But those\nwhich did not stumble back were chilled to torpor during their first\nnight underneath the stars. They were only partly active on the second\nday,--if, indeed, they were active at all. Few or none recovered from\ntheir second nights' coldness. None at all kept their full ferocity and\ndeadliness.\n\nAnd this was how the dogs survived. They were certainly descended from\ndogs on the wrecked space-ship--the _Icarus_--whose crew had landed on\nthis planet some forty-odd human generations since. The humans of today\nhad no memories of the ship, and the dogs surely had no traditions. But\njust because those early dogs had less intelligence, they had more\nuseful instincts. Perhaps the first generations of castaways bred dogs\nin their first few desperate centuries, hoping that dogs could help them\nsurvive. But no human civilization could survive in the lowlands. The\nhumans went back to the primitive state of their race and lived as\nfurtive vermin among monsters. Dogs could not survive there, though\nhumans did linger on, so somehow the dogs took to the heights. Perhaps\ndogs survived their masters. Perhaps some were abandoned or driven away.\nBut dogs had reached the highlands. And they did survive because giant\ninsects blundered up after them,--and could not survive in a proper\nenvironment for dogs and men.\n\nThere was even reason for the dogs remaining limited in number, and\nkeenly intelligent. The food-supply was limited. When there were too\nmany dogs, their attacks on stumbling insect giants were more desperate\nand made earlier, before the monsters' ferocity was lessened. So more\ndogs died. Then there was an adjustment of the number of dogs to the\nfood-supply. There was also a selection of those too intelligent to\nattack rashly. Yet those who had insufficient courage would not eat.\n\nIn short, the dogs who now regarded men with bright, interested eyes\nwere very sound dogs. They had the intelligence needed for survival.\nThey did not attack anything imprudently, but they also knew that it was\nnot necessary to be more than reasonably wary of insects in\ngeneral,--not even spiders unless they were very newly arrived from the\nsteaming lowlands. So the dogs regarded men with very much the same\nastonished interest with which the men regarded the dogs.\n\nBurl saw immediately that the dogs did not act with the blind ferocity\nof insects, but with an interested, estimative intelligence strikingly\nlike that of men. Insects never examined anything. They fled or they\nfought. Those who were not carnivorous had no interest in anything but\nfood, and those who were meat-eaters lumbered insanely into battle at\nthe bare sight of possible prey. The dogs did neither. They sniffed and\nthey considered.\n\nBurl said sharply to his followers:\n\n\"Stay here!\"\n\nHe walked slowly down into the amphitheatre. Saya followed him\ninstantly. Dogs moved warily aside. But they raised their noses and\nsniffed. They were long, luxurious sniffs. The smell of human kind was a\ngood smell. Dogs had lived hundreds of their generations without having\nit in their nostrils, but before that there were thousands of\ngenerations to whom that smell was a necessity.\n\nBurl reached the object the dogs had been attacking. It lay on the\ngrass, throbbing painfully. It was the larva of an azure-blue moth which\nspread ten-foot wings at nightfall. The time for its metamorphosis was\nnear, and it had traveled blindly in search of a place where it could\nspin its cocoon safely and change to its winged form. It had come to\nanother world,--the world above the clouds. It could find no proper\nplace. Its stores of fat had protected it somewhat from the chill. But\nthe dogs had found it as it crawled blindly--.\n\nBurl considered. It was the custom of wasps to sting creatures like this\nat a certain special spot,--apparently marked for them by a tuft of dark\nfur.\n\nBurl thrust home with his lance. The point pierced that particular spot.\nThe creature died quickly and without agony. The thought to kill was an\ninspiration. Then instinct followed. Burl cut off meat for his\ntribesmen. The dogs offered no objection. They were well-fed enough.\nBurl and Saya, together, carried the meat back to the other tribesfolk.\nOn the way Burl passed within two yards of a dog which regarded him with\nextreme intentness and almost a wistful expression. Burl's smell did not\nmean game. It meant--something the dog struggled helplessly to remember.\nBut it was good.\n\n\"I have killed the thing,\" said Burl to the dog, in the tone of one\naddressing an equal. \"You can go and eat it now. I took only part of\nit.\"\n\nBurl and his people ate of what he had brought back. Many of the\ndogs--most of them--went to the feast Burl had left. Presently they were\nback. They had no reason to be hostile. They were fed. The humans\noffered them no injury, and the humans smelled of something that\nappealed to the deepest well-springs of canine nature.\n\nPresently the dogs were close about the humans. They were fascinated.\nAnd the humans were fascinated in return. Each of the people had a\nlittle of the feeling that Burl had experienced as the tribal leader. In\nthe intent, absorbed and wholly unhostile regard of the dogs, even\nchildren felt flattered and friendly. And surely in a place where\neverything else was so novel and so satisfactory, it was possible to\nimagine friendliness with creatures which were not human, since\nassuredly they were not insects.\n\nA similar state of mind existed among the dogs.\n\nSaya had more meat than she desired. She glanced among the members of\nthe tribe. All were supplied. She tossed it to a dog. He jerked away\nalertly, and then sniffed at it where it had dropped. A dog can always\neat. He ate it.\n\n\"I wish you would talk to us,\" said Saya hopefully.\n\nThe dog wagged his tail.\n\n\"You do not look like us,\" said Saya interestedly, \"but you act like we\ndo. Not like the--Monsters.\"\n\nThe dog looked significantly at meat in Burl's hand. Burl tossed it. The\ndog caught it with a quick snap, swallowed it, wagged his tail briefly\nand came closer. It was a completely incredible action, but dogs and men\nwere blood-kin on this planet. Besides, there was racial-memory\nrightness in friendship between men and dogs. It was not hindered by any\npast experience of either. They were the only warm-blooded creatures on\nthis world. It was a kinship felt by both.\n\nPresently Burl stood up and spoke politely to the dog. He addressed him\nwith the same respect he would have given to another man. In all his\nlife he had never felt equal to an insect, but he felt no arrogance\ntoward this dog. He felt superior only to other men.\n\n\"We are going back to our cave,\" he said politely. \"Maybe we will meet\nagain.\"\n\nHe led his tribe back to the cave in which they had spent the previous\nnight. The dogs followed, ranging on either side. They were well-fed,\nwith no memory of hostility to any creature which smelled of warm blood.\nThey had an instinct without experience to dull it. The latter part of\nthe journey back to the tribal cave was--if anybody had been qualified\nto notice it--remarkably like a group of dogs taking a walk with a group\nof people. It was companionable. It felt right.\n\nThat night Burl left the cave, as before, to look at the stars. This\ntime Saya went with him matter-of-factly. But as they came out of the\ncave-entrance there was a stirring. A dog rose and stretched himself\nelaborately, yawning the while. When Burl and Saya moved away, he\ntrotted amiably with them.\n\nThey talked to it, and the dog seemed pleased. It wagged its tail.\n\nWhen morning came, the dogs were still waiting hopefully for the humans\nto come out. They appeared to expect the people to take another nice\nlong walk, on which they would accompany them. It was a brand-new\nsatisfaction they did not want to miss. After all, from a dog's\nstandpoint, humans are made to take long walks with, among other things.\nThe dogs greeted the people with tail-waggings and cordiality.\n\nThe dogs made a great difference in the adjustment of the tribe to life\nupon the plateau. Their friendship assured the new status of human life.\nBurl and his fellows had ceased to be fugitive game for any insect\nmurderer. They had hoped to become unpursued foragers,--because they\ncould hardly imagine anything else. But when the dogs joined them, they\nwere immediately raised to the estate of hunters. The men did not\ndomesticate the dogs. They made friends with them. The dogs did not\nsubjugate themselves to the men. They joined them,--at first\ntentatively, and then with worshipful enthusiasm. And the partnership\nwas so inevitably a right one that within a month it was as if it had\nalways been.\n\nActually, save for a mere two thousand years, it had been.\n\nAt the end of a month the tribe had a permanent encampment. There were\ncaves at a suitable distance from the slope up which most wanderers from\nthe lowlands came. Cori's oldest child found the chrysalis of a giant\nbutterfly, whose caterpillar form had so offensive an odor that the dogs\nhad not attacked it. But when it emerged from the chrysalis, men and\ndogs together assailed it before it could take flight. They ended the\nenterprise with warm mutual approval. The humans had acquired great\nwings with which to make warm cloaks,--very useful against the evening\nchill. Dogs and men, alike, had feasted.\n\nThen, one dawning, the dogs made a vast outcry which awoke the\ntribesmen. Burl led the rush to the spot. They did battle with a monster\nnocturnal beetle, less chilled than most such invaders. In the gray\ndawnlight Burl realized that the darting, yapping dogs kept the\ncreature's full attention. He crippled, and then killed it with his\nspear. The feat appeared to earn him warm admiration from the dogs. Burl\nwore a moth's feathery antenna again, bound to his forehead like a\nknight's plumes. He looked very splendid.\n\nThe entire pattern of human life changed swiftly, as if an entire\nrevelation had been granted to men. The ground was often thorny. One man\npierced his foot. Old Tama, scolding him for his carelessness, bound a\nstrip of wing-fabric about it so he could walk. The injured foot was\nmore comfortable than the one still unhurt. Within a week the women\nwere busily contriving diverse forms of footgear to achieve greater\ncomfort for everybody. One day Saya admired glistening red berries and\ntried to pluck one, and they stained her fingers. She licked her fingers\nto clean them,--and berries were added to the tribe's menu. A veritable\norgy of experiment began, which is a state of things which is extremely\nrare in human affairs. A race with an established culture and tradition\ndoes not abandon old ways of doing things without profound reason. But\nmen who have abandoned their old ways can discover astonishingly useful\nnew ones.\n\nAlready the dogs were established as sentries and watchmen, and as\nfriends to every member of the tribe. By now mothers did not feel\nalarmed if a child wandered out of sight. There would be dogs along. No\ndanger could approach a child without vociferous warning from the dogs.\nMen went hunting, now, with zestful tail-wagging dogs as companions in\nthe chase. Dor killed a torpid minotaur-beetle alone, save for assisting\ndogs, and Burl felt a twinge of jealousy. But then Burl, himself,\nbattled a black male spider in a lone duel,--with dogs to help. By the\ntime a stray monster from the lowlands reached this area, it was dazed\nand half-numbed by one night of continuous chill. Even the black spider\ncould not find the energy to leap. It fought like a fiend, yet\nsluggishly. Burl killed this one while the dogs kept it busy,--and the\ndogs were reproachful because he carried it back to the tribal\nheadquarters before dividing it among his assistants. Afterward, he\nrealized that though he could have avoided the fight he would have been\nashamed to do so, while the dogs barked and snapped at its furry legs.\n\nIt was while things were in this state that the way of life for human\nbeings on the forgotten planet was settled for all time. Burl and Saya\nwent out early one morning with the dogs, to hunt for meat for the\nvillage. Hunting was easiest in the early hours, while creatures that\nstrayed up the night before were still sluggish with cold. Often,\nhunting was merely butchery of an enfeebled monster to whom any effort\nat all was terribly difficult.\n\nThis morning they strode away briskly. The dogs roved exuberantly\nthrough the brush before them. They were some five miles from the\nvillage when the dogs bayed game. And Burl and Saya ran to the spot with\nready spears,--which was something of a change from their former actions\non notice of a carnivore abroad. They found the dogs dancing and barking\naround one of the most ferocious of the meat-eating beetles. It was not\nunduly large, to be sure. Its body might have been four feet long, or\nthereabouts. But its horrible gaping mandibles added a good three feet\nmore.\n\nThose scythelike weapons gaped wide--opening sidewise as insects' jaws\ndo--as the beetle snapped hideously at its attackers, swinging about as\nthe dogs dashed at it. Its legs were spurred and spiked and armed with\ndagger-like spines. Burl plunged into the fight.\n\nThe great mandibles clicked and clashed. They were capable of\ndisemboweling a man or snapping a dog's body in half without effort.\nThere were whistling noises as the beetle breathed through its abdominal\nspiracles. It fought furiously, making ferocious charges at the dogs who\ntormented and bewildered it. But they created the most zestfully excited\nof tumults.\n\nBurl and Saya were, of course, at least as absorbed and excited as the\ndogs, or they would have noticed the thing that was to make so much\ndifference to every human being, not only on the plateau but still down\nin the lowlands. This unnoticed thing was beyond their imagining. There\nhad been nothing else like it on this world in many hundreds of years.\nIt was half a dozen miles away and perhaps a thousand feet high when\nBurl and Saya prepared to intervene professionally on behalf of the\ndogs. It was a silvery needle, floating unsupported in the air. As they\nentered the battle, it swerved and moved swiftly in their direction.\n\nIt was silent, and they did not notice. They knew of no reason to scan\nthe sky in daytime. And there was business on hand, anyhow.\n\nBurl leaped in toward the beetle with a lance-thrust at the tough\nintegument where an armored leg joined the creature's body. He missed,\nand the beetle whirled. Saya flashed her cloak before the monster so\nthat it seemed a larger and a nearer antagonist. As the creature whirled\nagain, Burl stabbed and a hind-leg crumpled.\n\nInstantly the thing was limping. A beetle does not use its legs like\nfour-legged creatures. A beetle moving shifts the two end legs on one\nside and the central leg on the other, so that it always stands on an\nadjustable tripod of limbs. It cannot adjust readily to crippling. A dog\nsnatched at a spiny lower leg and crunched,--and darted away. The\nmachine-like monster uttered a formless, deep-bass cry and was spurred\nto unbelievable fierceness. The fight became a thing of furious movement\nand joyous uproar, with Burl striking once at a multiple eye so the pain\nwould deflect it from a charge at Saya, and Saya again deflecting it\nwith her cloak and once breathlessly trying to strike it with her\nshorter spear.\n\nThey struck it again, and a third time, and it sank horribly to the\nground, all three legs on one side crippled. The remaining three thrust\nand thrust and struggled senselessly,--and suddenly it was on its back,\nstill striking its gigantic jaws frantically in the hope of murder. But\nthen Burl struck home between two armor-plates where a ganglion was\nalmost exposed. The blow killed it instantly.\n\nBurl and Saya were smiling at each other when there was a monstrous\nsound of crashing trees. They whirled. The dogs pricked up their ears.\nOne of them barked defiantly.\n\nSomething huge--truly huge!--had settled to the ground a bare two\nhundred yards away. It was metal, and there were ports in its sides, and\nit was quite beyond imagining. Because, of course, no space-ship had\nlanded on this planet in forty-odd human generations.\n\nA port opened as they stared at it. Men came out. Burl and Saya were\nbarbarically attired, but they had been fighting some sort of local\nmonster--the men on the space-ship could not quite grasp what they had\nseen--and they had been helped by dogs. Human beings and dogs, together,\nalways mean some sort of civilization.\n\nThe dogs gave an impression of a very high level indeed. They trotted\nconfidently over to the ship, and they sniffed cautiously at the men who\nhad landed. Then their behavior was admirable. They greeted the new-come\nmen with the self-confident cordiality of dogs who are on the best\npossible terms with human beings,--and there was no question of any\nsuspicion by anybody. The attitude of a man toward a dog is a perfectly\nvalid indication of his character, if not of his technical education.\nAnd the newcomers knew how to treat dogs.\n\nSo Burl and Saya went forward, with the confident pleasure with which\nwell-raised children and other persons of innate dignity greet\nstrangers.\n\nThe ship was the _Wapiti_, a private cruiser doing incidental\nexploration for the Biological Survey in the course of a trip after good\nhunting. It had touched on the forgotten planet, and it would never be\nforgotten again.\n\n\n\n\n_EPILOGUE_\n\n\nThe survey-ship _Tethys_ made the first landing on the forgotten planet,\nand the _Orana_ followed, and some centuries later the _Ludred_. Then\nthe planet was forgotten until the _Wapiti_ arrived. The arrival of the\n_Wapiti_ was as much an accident as the loss of the punched card which\ncaused the planet to be overlooked for some thousands of years.\nSomebody had noticed that the sun around which it circled was of a type\nwhich usually has useful planets, but there was no record that it had\never been visited. So a request to the sportsmen on the _Wapiti_ had\ncaused them to turn aside. They considered, anyhow, that it would be\ninteresting to land on a brand-new world or two. They considered it\nfascinating to find human beings there before them. But they could not\nunderstand the use of such primitive weapons or garments of such\nbarbaric splendor. They had trouble, too, because in forty-odd\ngenerations the speech of the universe had changed, while Burl and Saya\nspoke a very archaic language indeed.\n\nBut there was an educator on the _Wapiti_. It was quite standard\napparatus,--simply basic-education for a human child, so that one's\nschool-years could be begun with a backlog of correct speech, and\nreading, with the practical facts of mathematics, sanitation, and the\ngeneral information that any human being anywhere needs to know.\nChildren use it before they start school, and they absorb its\ninformation quite painlessly. It is rare that an adult needs it. But\nBurl and Saya did.\n\nBurl was politely invited to wear the head-set, and he politely obliged.\nHe found himself equipped with a new language and what seemed to him an\nastonishing amount of information. Among the information was the item\nthat he was going to have--as an adult--a severe headache. Which he did.\nAlso included was the fact that the making of records for such educators\nwas so laborious a process that it took generations to compile one\nmaster-record for the instruments.\n\nBurl, with a splitting headache, nevertheless urged Saya to join him in\ngetting an education. And she did. And thereafter they were able to\nconverse with the sportsmen on the _Wapiti_ comfortably enough,--except\nfor their headaches.\n\nAnd all this led to extremely satisfactory arrangements. Sportsmen\ncould not but be enthusiastic about the hunting of giant insects with\ndogs and spears. The sportsmen on the _Wapiti_ wanted some of that kind\nof sport. Burl's fellow-tribesmen were delighted to oblige,--though they\nhad not quite the zest of Burl. They had to acquire educations in their\nturn, so they could talk to their new hunting-companions. But the\nhunting was magnificent. The _Wapiti_ abandoned its original plans and\nsettled down for a stay.\n\nPresently Burl's casual talk of the lowlands produced results. An\natmosphere-flier came out of the ship's storage-compartments. And\nthrough the educator Burl was now a civilized man. He had not the\nspecialized later information of his guests, but he had knowledge they\ncould not dream of, and which it would take much of a century to put in\nrecordable form for an educator.\n\nSo an atmosphere-flier went down into the lowlands through the\ncloud-banks. There were three men on board. They had good hunting.\nMagnificent hunting. Even more importantly, they found another cluster\nof human beings who lived as fugitives among the insect giants. They\nbrought them to the plateau, a few at a time. Sportsmen stayed in the\nlowlands with modern weapons, hunting enthusiastically, while the\ntransfer took place.\n\nIn all, the _Wapiti_ stayed for two months Earth-time. When it left, its\nsportsmen had such trophies as would make them envied of all other\nhunters in three star-clusters. They left behind weapons and\natmosphere-fliers and their library and tools. But they took with them\nenthusiasm for the sport on the once-forgotten planet, and rather warm\nfeelings of friendship for Burl.\n\nThey sent their friends back. The next ship to come in found a small\ncity on the plateau, with a population of three hundred souls,--all\ncivilized by educator. Naturally, they'd had no trouble building\ncivilized dwellings or practising sanitation, or developing a neatly\nadapted culture-pattern for their particular environment. This second\nship brought more weapons and fliers and news from the first party\nabout commercial demand for the incredibly luxurious moth-fur, to be\nfound on only one planet in all the galaxy.\n\nThe fourth ship to land on the plateau was a trading-ship anxious to\nload such furs for recklessly bidding merchants in a dozen\ninterplanetary marts. There were then nearly a thousand people living on\nthe plateau. They had a natural monopoly,--not of moth-fur and\nbutterfly-wing fabric, and panels of irridescent chitin for luxurious\ndecoration, but--of the strictly practical and detailed knowledge of\ninsect-habits which made it possible to obtain them. Off-planet visitors\nwho tried to hunt without local knowledge did not come back from the\nlowlands. In time, Burl firmly enacted a planetary law which forbade the\ninexperienced to go below the cloud-layer.\n\nBecause, of course, a government had to be formed for the planet. But\nmen with the basic education of citizens everywhere did not fumble it.\nThey had a job to do which was more important than anybody's vanity. It\nwas a job which gave deep and abiding satisfaction. When naked,\ntrembling folk were found in the mushroom-jungles and brought to the\nplateau, they had one instant, feverish desire as soon as they got over\nthe headache from the educator.\n\nThey wanted to go back to the lowlands. It was profitable, to be sure.\nBut it was even more of a satisfaction to hunt and kill the monsters\nthat had hunted and killed men for so long. It felt good, too, to find\nother humans and bring them out to sunshine.\n\nSo nowadays the forgotten planet has ceased to be forgotten. It is\nhardly necessary to name it, because its name is known through all the\nGalaxy. Its population is not large, so far, but it is an interesting\nplace to live in. In the popular mind, it is the most glamorous of all\npossible worlds,--and for easily understandable reasons. The inhabitants\nof its capital city wear moth-fur garments and butterfly-wing cloaks for\nthe benefit of their fellows in the lowlands. There is no day but\nfliers take off and dive down into the mists. When human hunters are in\nthe lowlands, they dress as the lowlanders they used to be, so that\nlowlanders who may spy them will be sure that they are men, and friends,\nand come to them to be raised to proper dignity above the insects. It is\nnot unusual for a man to be brought up to sunshine, and have his session\nwith the educator, and be flying his own assigned atmosphere-flier\nwithin a week, diving back above what used to be the place where he was\nhunted, but where he has become the hunter.\n\nIt is a very pleasant arrangement. The search for more humans in the\nlowlands is a prosperous business, even when it is unsuccessful. The\nwings of white Morpho butterflies bring the highest prices, but even a\ncommon swallow-tail is riches, and the fur of caterpillars--duly\nprocessed--goes into the holds of the planet-owned space-line ships with\nthe care given elsewhere to platinum and diamonds.\n\nAnd also it is good sport. The planet is a sportsman's paradise. There\nare not too many visitors. Nobody may go hunting without an experienced\nhost. And off-planet sportsmen tend to feel somewhat queasy after a\nsession as guest of the folk who have made Burl their planet-president.\nVisitors are not so much alarmed at fighting flying beetles in mid-air,\neven though the beetles may compare with the hunters' craft in size and\nare terrifically tenacious of life. The thing that appalls strangers is\nthe insistence of Burl's fellow-citizens--no longer only tribesmen--upon\nfighting spiders on the ground. With their memories, they like it that\nway. It's more satisfactory.\n\nNot long ago the Planet President of Sumor XI was Burl's guest for a\nhunt. Sumor XI is a highly civilized planet, and life there has become\ntame. Its president is an ardent hunter. He liked Burl, who is still all\nhard muscle despite his graying hair. He and Saya have a very\ncomfortable dwelling, and now that their children are grown they have\nroom in it even for a planet president, if he comes as a sportsman\nguest. The Planet President of Sumor XI even liked the informal\natmosphere of a house where pleasantly self-possessed dogs curl up\ncomfortably on rugs of emperor-moth down that elsewhere are beyond\nprice.\n\nBut the President of Sumor XI was embarrassed on his visit. He and Burl\nare both hunters, and they are highly congenial. But the President of\nSumor XI was upset on his last flight to the lowlands. Burl got out of\nthe atmosphere-flier alone, and for pure deep personal satisfaction he\nfought a mastodon-sized wolf spider with nothing but a spear.\n\nHe killed the creature, of course. But the President of Sumor XI was\nembarrassed. He wouldn't have dared try it. He felt that, however\nsporting it might be, it was too risky a thing for a Planet President to\ndo.\n\nBut Saya took it for granted.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n_You're missing the big thrills in science-fiction if you miss any of\nthe_\n\n_ACE SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS_\n\n\nFor instance, here's what the _New York Herald-Tribune_ (just one of the\nmany applauding reviewers) said about Ace Book D-103:\n\nSOLAR LOTTERY by Philip K.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
