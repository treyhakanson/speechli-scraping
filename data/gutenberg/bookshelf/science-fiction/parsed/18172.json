Which, of course, was because the\nMilky Way and the local Cepheid marker-stars were seen from an\nunaccustomed angle and a not-yet-commonplace pattern of varying\nmagnitudes.\n\nBut Calhoun grunted in satisfaction. There was a banded sun off to\nport, which was good. A breakout at no more than sixty light-hours\nfrom one's destination wasn't bad, in a strange sector of the galaxy\nand after three light-years of journeying blind.\n\n\"Arise and shine, Murgatroyd,\" said Calhoun. \"Comb your whiskers. Get\nset to astonish the natives!\"\n\nA sleepy, small, shrill voice said: \"_Chee!_\"\n\nMurgatroyd the _tormal_ came crawling out of the small cubbyhole which\nwas his own. He blinked at Calhoun.\n\n\"We're due to land shortly,\" Calhoun observed. \"You will impress the\nlocal inhabitants. I will get unpopular. According to the records,\nthere's been no Med Ship inspection here for twelve standard years.\nAnd that was practically no inspection, to judge by the report.\"\n\nMurgatroyd said: \"_Chee-chee!_\"\n\nHe began to make his toilet, first licking his right-hand whiskers and\nthen his left. Then he stood up and shook himself and looked\ninterestedly at Calhoun. _Tormals_ are companionable small animals.\nThey are charmed when somebody speaks to them. They find great, deep\nsatisfaction in imitating the actions of humans, as parrots and\nmynahs and parakeets imitate human speech. But _tormals_ have certain\nvaluable, genetically transmitted talents which make them much more\nvaluable than mere companions or pets.\n\nCalhoun got a light-reading for the banded sun. It could hardly be an\naccurate measure of distance, but it was a guide.\n\n\"Hold on to something, Murgatroyd!\" he said.\n\nMurgatroyd watched. He saw Calhoun make certain gestures which\npresaged discomfort. He popped back into his cubbyhole. Calhoun threw\nthe overdrive switch and the Med Ship flicked back into that\nquestionable state of being in which velocities of hundreds of times\nthat of light are possible. The sensation of going into overdrive was\nunpleasant. A moment later, the sensation of coming out was no less\nso. Calhoun had experienced it often enough, and still didn't like it.\n\nThe sun Weald burned huge and terrible in space. It was close, now.\nIts disk covered half a degree of arc.\n\n\"Very neat,\" observed Calhoun. \"Weald Three is our port, Murgatroyd.\nThe plane of the ecliptic would be ... Hm....\"\n\nHe swung the outside electron telescope, picked up a nearby bright\nobject, enlarged its image to show details, and checked it against the\nlocal star-pilot. He calculated a moment. The distance was too short\nfor even the briefest of overdrive hops, but it would take time to get\nthere on solar-system drive.\n\nHe thumbed down the communicator button and spoke into a microphone.\n\n\"Med Ship _Aesclipus Twenty_ reporting arrival and asking coordinates\nfor landing,\" he said matter-of-factly. \"Purpose of landing is\nplanetary health inspection. Our mass is fifty tons, standard. We\nshould arrive at a landing position in something under four hours.\nRepeat. Med Ship _Aesclipus Twenty_....\"\n\nHe finished the regular second transmission and made coffee for\nhimself while he waited for an answer. Murgatroyd came out for a cup\nof coffee for himself. Murgatroyd adored coffee. In minutes he held a\ntiny cup in a furry small paw and sipped gingerly at the hot liquid.\n\nA voice came out of the communicator:\n\n\"_Aesclipus Twenty_, repeat your identification.\"\n\nCalhoun went to the control board.\n\n\"_Aesclipus Twenty_,\" he said patiently, \"is a Med Ship, sent by the\nInterstellar Medical Service to make a planetary health inspection on\nWeald. Check with your public health authorities. This is the first\nMed Ship visit in twelve standard years, I believe--which is\ninexcusable. But your health authorities will know all about it. Check\nwith them.\"\n\nThe voice said truculently:\n\n\"What was your last port?\"\n\nCalhoun named it. This was not his home sector, but Sector Twelve had\ngotten into a very bad situation. Some of its planets had gone\nunvisited for as long as twenty years, and twelve between inspections\nwas almost commonplace. Other sectors had been called on to help it\ncatch up.\n\nCalhoun was one of the loaned Med Ship men, and because of the\nemergency he'd been given a list of half a dozen planets to be\ninspected one after another, instead of reporting back to sector\nheadquarters after each visit. He'd had minor troubles before with\nlanding-grid operators in Sector Twelve.\n\nSo he was very patient. He named the planet last inspected, the one\nfrom which he'd set out for Weald Three. The voice from the\ncommunicator said sharply:\n\n\"What port before that?\"\n\nCalhoun named the one before the last.\n\n\"Don't drive any closer,\" said the voice harshly, \"or you'll be\ndestroyed!\"\n\nCalhoun said coldly, \"Listen, my fine feathered friend! I'm from the\nInterstellar Medical Service. You get in touch with planetary health\nservices immediately! Remind them of the Interstellar Medical\nInspection Agreement, signed on Tralee two hundred and forty standard\nyears ago. Remind them that if they do not cooperate in medical\ninspection that I can put your planet under quarantine and your space\ncommerce will be cut off like that!\n\n\"No ship will be cleared for Weald from any other planet in the galaxy\nuntil there has been a health inspection! Things have pretty well gone\nto pot so far as the Med Service in this sector is concerned, but it's\nbeing straightened up. I'm helping straighten it! I give you twenty\nminutes to clear this! Then I am coming in, and if I'm not landed a\nquarantine goes on! Tell your health authorities that!\"\n\nSilence. Calhoun clicked off and poured himself another cup of coffee.\nMurgatroyd held out his cup for a refill. Calhoun gave it to him.\n\n\"I hate to put on an official hat, Murgatroyd,\" he said, annoyed, \"but\nthere are some people who demand it. The rule is, never get official\nif you can help it, but when you must, out-official the official who's\nofficialing you.\"\n\nMurgatroyd said \"_Chee!_\" and sipped at his cup.\n\nCalhoun checked the course of the Med Ship. It bore on through space.\nThere were tiny noises from the communicator. There were whisperings\nand rustlings and the occasional strange and sometimes beautiful\nmusical notes whose origin is yet obscure, but which, since they are\ncarried by electromagnetic radiation of wildly varying wave lengths,\nare not likely to be the fabled music of the spheres.\n\nIn fifteen minutes a different voice came from the speaker.\n\n\"Med Ship _Aesclipus_! Med Ship _Aesclipus_!\"\n\nCalhoun answered and the voice said anxiously:\n\n\"Sorry about the challenge, but we have the blueskin problem always\nwith us. We have to be extremely careful! Will you come in, please?\"\n\n\"I'm on my way,\" said Calhoun.\n\n\"The planetary health authorities,\" said the voice, more anxiously\nstill, \"are very anxious to be cooperative. We need Med Service help!\nWe lose a lot of sleep over the blueskin! Could you tell us the name\nof the last Med Ship to land here, and its inspector, and when that\ninspection was made? We want to look up the record of the event to be\nable to assist you in every possible way.\"\n\n\"He's lying,\" Calhoun told Murgatroyd, \"but he's more scared than\nhostile.\"\n\nHe picked up the order folio on Weald Three. He gave the information\nabout the last Med Ship visit.\n\n\"What?\" he asked, \"is a blueskin?\"\n\nHe'd read the folio on Weald, of course, but as the ship swam onward\nthrough emptiness he went through it again. The last medical\ninspection had been only perfunctory. Twelve years earlier--instead of\nthree--a Med Ship had landed on Weald. There had been official\nconferences with health officials. There was a report on the birth\nrate, the death rate, the anomaly rate, and a breakdown of all\nreported communicable diseases. But that was all. There were no\nspecial comments and no overall picture.\n\nPresently Calhoun found the word in a Sector dictionary, where words\nof only local usage were to be found:\n\n     \"_Blueskin: Colloquial term for a person recovered from a plague\n     which left large patches of blue pigment irregularly distributed\n     over the body. Especially, inhabitants of Dara. The condition is\n     said to be caused by a chronic, nonfatal form of Dara plague and\n     has been said to be noninfectious, though this is not certain. The\n     etiology of Dara plague has not been worked out. The blueskin\n     condition is hereditary but not a genetic modification, as markings\n     appear in non-Mendelian distributions_.\"\n\nCalhoun puzzled over it. Nobody could have read the entire Sector\ndirectory, even with unlimited leisure during travel between solar\nsystems. Calhoun hadn't tried. But now he went laboriously through\nindices and cross-references while the ship continued to travel\nonward.\n\nHe found no other reference to blueskins. He looked up Dara. It was\nlisted as an inhabited planet, some four hundred years colonized, with\na landing-grid and, at the time the main notice was written out, a\nflourishing interstellar commerce. But there was a memo, evidently\nadded to the entry in some change of editions: \"_Since plague, special\nlicense from Med Service is required for landing._\"\n\nThat was all. Absolutely all.\n\nThe communicator said suavely:\n\n\"Med Ship _Aesclipus Twenty_! Come in on vision, please!\"\n\nCalhoun went to the control board and threw on vision.\n\n\"Well, what now?\" he demanded.\n\nHis screen lighted. A bland face looked out at him.\n\n\"We have--ah--verified your statements,\" said the third voice from\nWeald. \"Just one more item. Are you alone in your ship?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Calhoun, frowning.\n\n\"Quite alone?\" insisted the voice.\n\n\"Obviously!\" said Calhoun.\n\n\"No other living creature?\" insisted the voice again. \"Of--oh!\" said\nCalhoun, annoyed. He called over his shoulder. \"Murgatroyd! Come\nhere!\"\n\nMurgatroyd hopped to his lap and gazed interestedly at the screen. The\nbland face changed remarkably. The voice changed even more.\n\n\"Very good!\" it said. \"Very, very good! Blueskins do not have\n_tormals_! You are Med Service! By all means come in! Your coordinates\nwill be....\"\n\nCalhoun wrote them down. He clicked off the communicator again and\ngrowled to Murgatroyd, \"So I might have been a blueskin, eh? And\nyou're my passport, because only Med Ships have members of your tribe\naboard! What the hell's the matter, Murgatroyd? They act like they\nthink somebody's trying to get down on their planet with a load of\nplague germs!\"\n\nHe grumbled to himself for minutes. The life of a Med Ship man is not\nexactly a sinecure, at best. It means long periods in empty space in\noverdrive, which is absolute and deadly tedium. Then two or three days\naground, checking official documents and statistics, and asking\nquestions to see how many of the newest medical techniques have\nreached this planet or that, and the supplying of information about\nsuch as have not arrived.\n\nThen the lifting out to space for long periods of tedium, to repeat\nthe process somewhere else. Med Ships carry only one man because two\ncould not stand the close contact without quarreling with each other.\nBut Med Ships do carry _tormals_, like Murgatroyd, and a _tormal_ and\na man can get along indefinitely, like a man and a dog. It is a highly\nunequal friendship, but it seems to be satisfactory to both.\n\nCalhoun was very much annoyed with the way the Med Service had been\noperated in Sector Twelve. He was one of many men at work to correct\nthe results of incompetence in directing Med Service in this sector.\nBut it is always disheartening to have to labor at making up for\nsomebody else's blundering, when there is so much new work that needs\nto be done.\n\nThe condition shown by the landing-grid suspicions was a case in\npoint. Blueskins were people who inherited a splotchy skin\npigmentation from other people who'd survived a plague. Weald plainly\nmaintained a one-planet quarantine against them. But a quarantine is\nnormally an emergency measure. The Med Service should have taken over,\nwiped out the need for a quarantine, and then lifted it. It hadn't\nbeen done.\n\nCalhoun fumed to himself.\n\nThe world of Weald Three grew brighter and brighter and became a disk.\nThe disk had icecaps and a reasonable proportion of land and water\nsurface. The ship decelerated, voices notifying observation from the\nsurface, and the little ship came to a stop some five planetary\ndiameters out from solidity. The landing field's force-field locked on\nto it, and its descent began.\n\nThe business of landing was all very familiar, from the blue rim which\nappeared at the limb of the planet from one diameter out, to the\nsingular flowing-apart of the surface features as the ship sank still\nlower. There was the circular landing-grid, rearing skyward for nearly\na mile. It could let down interstellar liners from emptiness and lift\nthem out to emptiness again, with great convenience and economy for\neveryone.\n\nIt landed the Med Ship in its center, and there were officials to\ngreet Calhoun, and he knew in advance the routine part of his visit.\nThere would be an interview with the planet's chief executive, by\nwhatever title he was called. There would be a banquet. Murgatroyd\nwould be petted by everybody. There would be painful efforts to\nimpress Calhoun with the splendid conduct of public health matters on\nWeald. He would be told much scandal.\n\nHe might find one man, somewhere, who passionately labored to advance\nthe welfare of his fellow humans by finding out how to keep them well\nor, failing that, how to make them well when they got sick. And in two\ndays, or three, Calhoun would be escorted back to the landing-grid,\nand lifted out to space, and he'd spend long empty days in overdrive\nand land somewhere else to do the whole thing all over again.\n\nIt all happened exactly as he expected, with one exception. Every\nhuman being he met on Weald wanted to talk about blueskins. Blueskins\nand the idea of blueskins obsessed everyone. Calhoun listened without\nasking questions until he had the picture of what blueskins meant to\nthe people who talked of them. Then he knew there would be no use\nasking questions at random.\n\nNobody mentioned ever having seen a blueskin. Nobody mentioned a\nspecific event in which a blueskin had at any named time taken part.\nBut everybody was afraid of blueskins. It was a patterned, an\ninculcated, a stage-directed fixed idea. And it found expression in\nshocked references to the vileness, the depravity, the monstrousness\nof the blueskin inhabitants of Dara, from whom Weald must at all costs\nbe protected.\n\nIt did not make sense. So Calhoun listened politely until he found an\nundistinguished medical man who wanted some special information about\ngene selection as practised halfway across the galaxy. He invited that\nman to the Med Ship, where he supplied the information not hitherto\navailable. He saw his guest's eyes shine a little with that joyous awe\na man feels when he finds out something he has wanted long and badly\nto know.\n\n\"Now,\" said Calhoun, \"tell me something? Why does everybody on this\nplanet hate the inhabitants of Dara? It's light-years away. Nobody\nclaims to have suffered in person from them. Why make a point of\nhating them?\"\n\nThe Wealdian doctor grimaced.\n\n\"They've blue patches on their skins. They're different from us. So\nthey can be pictured as a danger and our political parties can make an\nelection issue out of competing for the privilege of defending us from\nthem. They had a plague on Dara, once. They're accused of still having\nit ready for export.\"\n\n\"Hm,\" said Calhoun. \"The story is that they want to spread contagion\nhere, eh? Doesn't anybody\"--his tone was sardonic--\"doesn't anybody\nurge that they be massacred as an act of piety?\"\n\n\"Yes-s-s-s,\" admitted the doctor reluctantly. \"It's mentioned in\npolitical speeches.\"\n\n\"But how's it rationalized?\" demanded Calhoun. \"What's the argument to\nmake pigment-patches involve moral and physical degradation, as I'm\nassured is the case?\"\n\n\"In the public schools,\" said the doctor, \"the children are taught\nthat blueskins are now carriers of the disease they survived--three\ngenerations ago! That they hate everybody who isn't a blueskin. That\nthey are constantly scheming to introduce their plague here so most of\nus will die and the rest will become blueskins. That's beyond\nrationalizing. It can't be true, but it's not safe to doubt it.\"\n\n\"Bad business,\" said Calhoun coldly. \"That sort of thing usually costs\nlives in the end. It could lead to massacre!\"\n\n\"Perhaps it has, in a way,\" said the doctor unhappily. \"One doesn't\nlike to think about it.\" He paused. \"Twenty years ago there was a\nfamine on Dara. There were crop failures. The situation must have been\nvery bad: They built a spaceship.\n\n\"They've no use for such things normally, because no nearby planet\nwill deal with them or let them land. But they built a spaceship and\ncame here. They went in orbit around Weald. They asked to trade for\nshiploads of food. They offered any price in heavy metals--gold,\nplatinum, irridium, and so on. They talked from orbit by vision\ncommunicators. They could be seen to be blueskins. You can guess what\nhappened!\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" said Calhoun.\n\n\"We armed ships in a hurry,\" admitted the doctor. \"We chased their\nspaceship back to Dara. We hung in space off the planet. We told them\nwe'd blast their world from pole to pole if they ever dared take to\nspace again. We made them destroy their one ship, and we watched on\nvisionscreens as it was done.\"\n\n\"But you gave them food?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the doctor ashamedly. \"They were blueskins.\"\n\n\"How bad was the famine?\"\n\n\"Who knows? Any number may have starved! And we kept a squadron of\narmed ships in their skies for years--to keep them from spreading the\nplague, we said. And some of us believed it!\"\n\nThe doctor's tone was purest irony.\n\n\"Lately,\" he said, \"there's been a move for economy in our government.\nSimultaneously, we began to have a series of overabundant crops. The\ngovernment had to buy the excess grain to keep the price up. Retired\npatrol ships, built to watch over Dara, were available for storage\nspace. We filled them up with grain and sent them out into orbit.\nThey're there now, hundreds of thousands or millions of tons of\ngrain!\"\n\n\"And Dara?\"\n\nThe doctor shrugged. He stood up.\n\n\"Our hatred of Dara,\" he said, again ironically, \"has produced one\nthing. Roughly halfway between here and Dara there's a two-planet\nsolar system, Orede. There's a usable planet there. It was proposed to\nbuild an outpost of Weald there, against blueskins. Cattle were landed\nto run wild and multiply and make a reason for colonists to settle\nthere.\n\n\"They did, but nobody wants to move near to blueskins! So Orede stayed\nuninhabited until a hunting party, shooting wild cattle, found an\noutcropping of heavy-metal ore. So now there's a mine there. And\nthat's all. A few hundred men work the mine at fabulous wages. You may\nbe asked to check on their health. But not Dara's!\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Calhoun, frowning.\n\nThe doctor moved toward the Med Ship's exit port.\n\n\"I answered your questions,\" he said grimly. \"But if I talked to\nanyone else as I've done to you, I'd be lucky only to be driven into\nexile!\"\n\n\"I shan't give you away,\" said Calhoun. He did not smile.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the doctor had gone, Calhoun said deliberately, \"Murgatroyd, you\nshould be grateful that you're a _tormal_ and not a man. There's\nnothing about being a _tormal_ to make you ashamed!\"\n\nThen he grimly changed his garments for the full-dress uniform of the\nMed Service. There was to be a banquet at which he would sit next to\nthe planet's chief executive and hear innumerable speeches about the\nsplendor of Weald. Calhoun had his own, strictly Med Service opinion\nof the planet's latest and most boasted-of achievement. It was a domed\ncity in the polar regions, where nobody ever had to go outdoors.\n\nHe was less than professionally enthusiastic about the moving streets,\nand much less than approving of the dream broadcasts which supplied\nhypnotic, sleep-inducing rhythms to anybody who chose to listen to\nthem. The price was that while asleep one would hear high praise of\ncommercial products, and might believe them when awake.\n\nBut it was not Calhoun's function to criticize when it could be\navoided. Med Service had been badly managed in Sector Twelve. So at\nthe banquet Calhoun made a brief and diplomatic address in which he\ntemperately praised what could be praised, and did not mention\nanything else.\n\nThe chief executive followed him. As head of the government he paid\nsome tribute to the Med Service. But then he reminded his hearers\nproudly of the high culture, splendid health, and remarkable\nprosperity of the planet since his political party took office. This,\nhe said, despite the need to be perpetually on guard against the\ngreatest and most immediate danger to which any world in all the\ngalaxy was exposed.\n\nHe referred to the blueskins, of course. He did not need to tell the\npeople of Weald what vigilance, what constant watchfulness was\nnecessary against that race of deprived and malevolent deviants from\nthe norm of humanity. But Weald, he said with emotion, held aloft the\ntorch of all that humanity held most dear, and defended not alone the\nlives of its people against blueskin contagion, but their noble\nheritage of ideals against blueskin pollution.\n\nWhen he sat down, Calhoun said very politely, \"It looks as if some day\nit should be practical politics to urge the massacre of all blueskins.\nHave you thought of that?\"\n\nThe chief executive said comfortably, \"The idea's been proposed. It's\ngood politics to urge it, but it would be foolish to carry it out.\nPeople vote against blueskins. Wipe them out, and where'd you be?\"\n\nCalhoun ground his teeth--quietly.\n\nThere were more speeches. Then a messenger, white-faced, arrived with\na written note for the chief executive. He read it and passed it to\nCalhoun. It was from the Ministry of Health. The spaceport reported\nthat a ship had just broken out from overdrive within the Wealdian\nsolar system. Its tape-transmitter had automatically signaled its\narrival from the mining planet Orede.\n\nBut, having sent off its automatic signal, the ship lay dead in space.\nIt did not drive toward Weald. It did not respond to signals. It\ndrifted like a derelict upon no course at all. It seemed ominous, and\nsince it came from Orede, the planet nearest to Dara of the blueskins,\nthe health ministry informed the planet's chief executive.\n\n\"It'll be blueskins,\" said that astute person firmly. \"They're next\ndoor to Orede. That's who's done this. It wouldn't surprise me if\nthey'd seeded Orede with their plague, and this ship came from there\nto give us warning!\"\n\n\"There's no evidence for anything of the sort,\" protested Calhoun. \"A\nship simply came out of overdrive and didn't signal further. That's\nall!\"\n\n\"We'll see,\" said the chief executive ominously. \"We'll go to the\nspaceport. There we'll get the news as it comes in, and can frame\norders on the latest information.\"\n\nHe took Calhoun by the arm. Calhoun said sharply, \"Murgatroyd!\"\n\nDuring the banquet, Murgatroyd had been visiting with the wives of the\nhigher-up officials. They had enough of their husbands normally,\nwithout listening to their official speeches. Murgatroyd was brought,\nhis small paunch distended with cakes and coffee and such delicacies\nas he'd been plied with. He was half comatose from overfeeding and\noverpetting, but he was glad to see Calhoun.\n\nCalhoun held the little creature in his arms as the official groundcar\nraced through traffic with screaming sirens claiming the right of way.\nIt reached the spaceport, where enormous metal girders formed a\nmonster frame of metal lace against a star-filled sky. The chief\nexecutive strode magnificently into the spaceport offices. There was\nno news; the situation remained unchanged.\n\nA ship from Orede had come out of overdrive and lay dead in emptiness.\nIt did not answer calls. It did not move in space. It floated eerily\nin no orbit, going nowhere, doing nothing. And panic was the\nconsequence.\n\nIt seemed to Calhoun that the official handling of the matter\naccounted for the terror that he could feel building up. The\nunexplained bit of news was on the air all over the planet Weald.\nThere was nobody awake of all the world's population who did not\nbelieve that there was a new danger in the sky. Nobody doubted that it\ncame from blueskins. The treatment of the news was precisely\ncalculated to keep alive the hatred of Weald for the inhabitants of\nthe world Dara.\n\nCalhoun put Murgatroyd into the Med Ship and went back to the\nspaceport office. A small spaceboat, designed to inspect the circling\ngrain ships from time to time, was already aloft. The landing-grid had\nthrust it swiftly out most of the way. Now it droned and drove on\nsturdily toward the enigmatic ship.\n\nCalhoun took no part in the agitated conferences among the officials\nand news reporters at the spaceport. But he listened to the talk about\nhim. As the investigating small ship drew nearer to the deathly-still\ncargo vessel, the guesses about the meaning of its breakout and\nfollowing silence grew more and more wild.\n\nBut, singularly, there was no single suggestion that the mystery might\nnot be the work of blueskins. Blueskins were scape-goats for all the\nfears and all the uneasiness a perhaps over-civilized world developed.\n\nPresently the investigating spaceboat reached the mystery ship and\ncircled it, beaming queries. No answer. It reported the cargo ship\ndark. No lights anywhere on or in it. There were no induction-surges\nfrom even pulsing, idling engines. Delicately, the messenger craft\nmaneuvered until it touched the silent vessel. It reported that\nmicrophones detected no motion whatever inside.\n\n\"Let a volunteer go aboard,\" commanded the chief executive. \"Let him\nreport what he finds.\"\n\nA pause. Then the solemn announcement of an intrepid volunteer's name,\nfrom far, far away. Calhoun listened, frowning darkly. This pompous\nheroism wouldn't be noticed in the Med Service. It would be routine\nbehavior.\n\nSuspenseful, second-by-second reports. The volunteer had rocketed\nhimself across the emptiness between the two again separated ships. He\nhad opened the airlock from outside. He'd gone in. He'd closed the\nouter airlock door. He'd opened the inner. He reported--\n\nThe relayed report was almost incoherent, what with horror and\nincredulity and the feeling of doom that came upon the volunteer. The\nship was a bulk-cargo ore-carrier, designed to run between Orede and\nWeald with cargos of heavy-metal ores and a crew of no more than five\nmen. There was no cargo in her holds now, though.\n\nInstead, there were men. They packed the ship. They filled the\ncorridors. They had crawled into every space where a man could find\nroom to push himself. There were hundreds of them. It was insanity.\nAnd it had been greater insanity still for the ship to have taken off\nwith so preposterous a load of living creatures.\n\nBut they weren't living any longer. The air apparatus had been\ndesigned for a crew of five. It would purify the air for possibly\ntwenty or more. But there were hundreds of men in hiding as well as in\nplain view in the cargo ship from Orede. There were many, many times\nmore than her air apparatus and reserve tanks could possibly have\ntaken care of. They couldn't even have been fed during the journey\nfrom Orede to Weald.\n\nBut they hadn't starved. Air-scarcity killed them before the ship came\nout of overdrive.\n\nA remarkable thing was that there was no written message in the ship's\nlog which referred to its takeoff. There was no memorandum of the\ntaking on of such an impossible number of passengers.\n\n\"The blueskins did it,\" said the chief executive of Weald. He was\npale. All about Calhoun men looked sick and shocked and terrified. \"It\nwas the blueskins! We'll have to teach them a lesson!\" Then he turned\nto Calhoun. \"The volunteer who went on that ship--he'll have to stay\nthere, won't he? He can't be brought back to Weald without bringing\ncontagion.\"\n\nCalhoun raged at him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nThere was a certain coldness in the manner of those at the Weald\nspaceport when the Med Ship left next morning. Calhoun was not popular\nbecause Weald was scared. It had been conditioned to scare easily,\nwhere blueskins might be involved. Its children were trained to react\nexplosively when the word _blueskin_ was uttered in their hearing, and\nits adults tended to say it when anything causing uneasiness entered\ntheir minds. So a planet-wide habit of irrational response had formed\nand was not seen to be irrational because almost everybody had it.\n\nThe volunteer who'd discovered the tragedy on the ship from Orede was\nsafe, though. He'd made a completely conscientious survey of the ship\nhe'd volunteered to enter and examine. For his courage, he'd have been\ndoomed but for Calhoun.\n\nThe reaction of his fellow citizens was that by entering the ship he\nmight have become contaminated by blueskin infectious material of the\nplague still existed, and _if_ the men in the ship had caught it (but\nthey certainly hadn't died of it), and _if_ there had been blueskins\non Orede to communicate it (for which there was no evidence), and _if_\nblueskins were responsible for the tragedy. Which was at the moment\npure supposition. But Weald feared he might bring death back to Weald\nif he were allowed to return.\n\nCalhoun saved his life. He ordered that the guardship admit him to its\nairlock, which then was to be filled with steam and chlorine. The\ncombination would sterilize and even partly eat away his spacesuit,\nafter which the chlorine and steam should be bled out to space, and\nair from the ship let into the lock.\n\nIf he stripped off the spacesuit without touching its outer surface,\nand reentered the investigating ship while the suit was flung outside\nby a man in another spacesuit, handling it with a pole he'd fling\nafter it, there could be no possible contamination brought back.\n\nCalhoun was quite right, but Weald in general considered that he'd\npersuaded the government to take an unreasonable risk.\n\nThere were other reasons for disapproving of him. Calhoun had been\nunpleasantly frank. The coming of the death-ship stirred to frenzy\nthose people who believed that all blueskins should be exterminated as\na pious act. They'd appeared on every vision screen, citing not only\nthe ship from Orede but other incidents which they interpreted as\ncrimes against Weald.\n\nThey demanded that all Wealdian atomic reactors be modified to turn\nout fusion-bomb materials while a space fleet was made ready for an\nanti-blueskin crusade. They confidently demanded such a rain of fusion\nbombs on Dara that no blueskin, no animal, no shred of vegetation, no\nfish in the deepest ocean, not even a living virus particle of the\nblueskin plague could remain alive on the blueskin world.\n\nOne of these vehement orators even asserted that Calhoun agreed that\nno other course was possible, speaking for the Interstellar Medical\nService. And Calhoun furiously demanded a chance to deny it by\nbroadcast, and he made a bitter and indiscreet speech from which a\nplanet-wide audience inferred that he thought them fools.\n\nHe did.\n\nSo he was definitely unpopular when his ship lifted from Weald. He'd\ncurtly given his destination as Orede, from which the death-ship had\ncome. The landing-grid locked on, raised the small spacecraft until\nWeald was a great shining ball below it, and then somehow scornfully\ncast him off. The Med Ship was free, in clear space where there was\nnot enough of a gravitational field to hinder overdrive.\n\nHe aimed for his destination, his face very grim. He said savagely,\n\"Get set, Murgatroyd! Overdrive coming!\"\n\nHe thumbed down the overdrive button. The universe of stars went out,\nwhile everything living in the ship felt the customary sensations of\ndizziness, of nausea, and of a spiraling fall to nothingness. Then\nthere was silence.\n\nThe Med Ship actually moved at a rate which was a preposterous number\nof times the speed of light, but it felt absolutely solid, absolutely\nfirm and fixed. A ship in overdrive feels exactly as if it were buried\ndeep in the core of a planet. There is no vibration. There is no sign\nof anything but solidity and, if one looks out a port, there is only\nutter blackness plus an absence of sound fit to make one's eardrums\ncrack.\n\nBut within seconds random tiny noises began. There was a reel and\nthere were sound-speakers to keep the ship from sounding like a grave.\nThe reel played and the speakers gave off minute creakings, and\nmeaningless hums, and very tiny noises of every imaginable sort, all\nof which were just above the threshold of the inaudible.\n\nCalhoun fretted. Sector Twelve was in very bad shape. A conscientious\nMed Service man would never have let the anti-blueskin obsession go\nunmentioned in a report on Weald. Health is not only a physical\naffair. There is mental health, also. When mental health goes a\ncivilization can be destroyed more surely and more terribly than by\nany imaginable war or plague germs. A plague kills off those who are\nsusceptible to it, leaving immunes to build up a world again. But\nimmunes are the first to be killed when a mass neurosis sweeps a\npopulation.\n\nWeald was definitely a Med Service problem world. Dara was another.\nAnd when hundreds of men jammed themselves into a cargo spaceship\nwhich could not furnish them with air to breathe, and took off and\nwent into overdrive before the air could fail.... Orede called for no\nless of worry.\n\n\"I think,\" said Calhoun dourly, \"that I'll have some coffee.\"\n\n_Coffee_ was one of the words that Murgatroyd recognized. Ordinarily\nhe stirred immediately on hearing it, and watched the coffeemaker with\nbright, interested eyes. He'd even tried to imitate Calhoun's motions\nwith it, once, and had scorched his paws in the attempt. But this time\nhe did not move.\n\nCalhoun turned his head. Murgatroyd sat on the floor, his long tail\ncoiled reflectively about a chair leg. He watched the door of the Med\nShip's sleeping cabin.\n\n\"Murgatroyd,\" said Calhoun. \"I mentioned coffee!\"\n\n\"_Chee!_\" shrilled Murgatroyd.\n\nBut he continued to look at the door. The temperature was kept lower\nin the other cabin, and the look of things was different than the\ncontrol compartment. The difference was part of the means by which a\nman was able to be alone for weeks on end--alone save for his\n_tormal_--without becoming ship-happy.\n\nThere were other carefully thought out items in the ship with the same\npurpose. But none of them should cause Murgatroyd to stare fixedly and\nfascinatedly at the sleeping cabin door. Not when coffee was in the\nmaking!\n\nCalhoun considered. He became angry at the immediate suspicion that\noccurred to him. As a Med Service man, he was duty-bound to be\nimpartial. To be impartial might mean not to side absolutely with\nWeald in its enmity to blueskins.\n\nAnd the people of Weald had refused to help Dara in a time of famine,\nand had blockaded that pariah world for years afterward. And they had\nother reasons for hating the people they'd treated badly. It was\nentirely reasonable for some fanatic on Weald to consider that Calhoun\nmust be killed lest he be of help to the blueskins Weald abhorred.\n\nIn fact, it was quite possible that somebody had stowed away on the\nMed Ship to murder Calhoun, so that there would be no danger of any\nreport favorable to Dara ever being presented anywhere. If so, such a\nstowaway would be in the sleeping cabin now, waiting for Calhoun to\nwalk in unsuspiciously, only to be shot dead.\n\nSo Calhoun made coffee. He slipped a blaster into a pocket where it\nwould be handy. He filled a small cup for Murgatroyd and a large one\nfor himself, and then a second large one.\n\nHe tapped on the sleeping cabin door, standing aside lest a\nblaster-bolt come through it.\n\n\"Coffee's ready,\" he said sardonically. \"Come out and join us.\"\n\nThere was a long pause. Calhoun rapped again.\n\n\"You've a seat at the captain's table,\" he said more sardonically\nstill. \"It's not polite to keep me waiting!\"\n\nHe listened, alert for a rush which would be a fanatic's desperate\nattempt to do murder despite premature discovery. He was prepared to\nshoot quite ruthlessly, because he was on duty and the Med Service did\nnot approve of the extermination of populations, however justified\nanother population might consider it.\n\nBut there was no rush. Instead, there came hesitant foot-falls whose\nsound made Calhoun start. The door of the cabin slid slowly aside. A\ngirl appeared in the opening, desperately white and desperately\ncomposed.\n\n\"H-how did you know I was there?\" she asked shakily. She moistened her\nlips. \"You didn't see me! I was in a closet, and you didn't even enter\nthe room!\"\n\nCalhoun said grimly, \"I've sources of information. Murgatroyd told me\nthis time. May I present him? Murgatroyd, our passenger. Shake hands.\"\n\nMurgatroyd moved forward, stood on his hind legs and offered a skinny,\nfurry paw. She did not move. She stared at Calhoun.\n\n\"Better shake hands,\" said Calhoun, as grimly as before. \"It might\nrelax the tension a little. And do you want to tell me your story? You\nhave one ready, I'm sure.\"\n\nThe girl swallowed. Murgatroyd shook hands gravely. He said,\n\"_Chee-chee!_\" in the shrillest of trebles and went back to his former\nposition.\n\n\"The story?\" said Calhoun insistently.\n\n\"There--there isn't any,\" said the girl unsteadily. \"Just that I--I\nneed to get to Orede, and you're going there. There's no other way to\ngo, now.\"\n\n\"To the contrary,\" said Calhoun. \"There'll undoubtedly be a fleet\nheading for Orede as soon as it can be assembled and armed. But I'm\nafraid that as a story yours isn't good enough. Try another.\"\n\nShe shivered a little.\n\n\"I'm running away....\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Calhoun. \"In that case I'll take you back.\"\n\n\"No!\" she said fiercely. \"I'll--I'll die first! I'll wreck this ship\nfirst!\"\n\nHer hand came from behind her. There was a tiny blaster in it. But it\nshook visibly as she tried to aim it.\n\n\"I'll shoot out the controls!\"\n\nCalhoun blinked. He'd had to make a drastic change in his estimate of\nthe situation the instant he saw that the stowaway was a girl. Now he\nhad to make another when her threat was not to kill him but to disable\nthe ship. Women are rarely assassins, and when they are they don't use\nenergy weapons. Daggers and poisons are more typical. But this girl\nthreatened to destroy the ship rather than its owner, so she was not\nactually an assassin at all.\n\n\"I'd rather you didn't do that,\" said Calhoun dryly. \"Besides, you'd\nget deadly bored if we were stuck in a derelict waiting for our air\nand food to give out.\"\n\nMurgatroyd, for no reason whatever, felt it necessary to enter the\nconversation:\n\n\"_Chee-chee-chee!_\"\n\n\"A very sensible suggestion,\" observed Calhoun. \"We'll sit down and\nhave a cup of coffee.\" To the girl he said, \"I'll take you to Orede,\nsince that's where you say you want to go.\"\n\n\"I have a sweetheart there....\"\n\nCalhoun shook his head.\n\n\"No,\" he said reprovingly. \"Nearly all the mining colony had packed\nitself into the ship that came into Weald with everybody dead. But not\nall. And there's been no check of what men were in the ship and what\nmen weren't. You wouldn't go to Orede if it were likely your\nsweetheart had died on the way to you. Here's your coffee. Sugar or\nsaccho, and do you take cream?\"\n\nShe trembled a little, but she took the cup.\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Murgatroyd and I,\" explained Calhoun--and he did not know whether he\nspoke out of anger or something else--\"we are do-gooders. We go around\ntrying to keep people from getting sick or dying. Sometimes we even\ntry to keep them from getting killed. It's our profession. We practise\nit even on our own behalf. We want to stay alive. So since you make\nsuch drastic threats, we will take you where you want to go.\nEspecially since we're going there anyhow.\"\n\n\"You don't believe anything I've said!\" It was a statement.\n\n\"Not a word,\" admitted Calhoun. \"But you'll probably tell us something\nmore believable presently. When did you eat last?\"\n\n\"Yesterday.\"\n\n\"Would you rather do your own cooking?\" asked Calhoun politely. \"Or\nwould you permit me to ready a snack?\"\n\n\"I--I'll do it,\" she said.\n\nShe drank her coffee first, however, and then Calhoun showed her how\nto punch the readier for such-and-such dishes, to be extracted from\nstorage and warmed or chilled, as the case might be, and served at\ndialed-for intervals. There was also equipment for preparing food for\noneself, in one's own chosen manner--again an item to help make\nsolitude not unendurable.\n\nCalhoun deliberately immersed himself in the Galactic Directory,\nlooking up the planet Orede. He was headed there, but he'd had no\nreason to inform himself about it before. Now he read with every\nappearance of absorption.\n\nThe girl ate daintily. Murgatroyd watched with highly amiable\ninterest. But she looked acutely uncomfortable.\n\nCalhoun finished with the Directory. He got out the micro-film reels\nwhich contained more information. He was specifically after the Med\nService history of all the planets in this sector. He went through the\nfilmed record of every inspection ever made on Weald and on Dara.\n\nBut Sector Twelve had not been run well. There was no adequate account\nof a plague which had wiped out three-quarters of the population of an\ninhabited planet! It had happened shortly after one Med Ship visit,\nand was over before another Med Ship came by.\n\nThere should have been a painstaking investigation, even after the\nfact. There should have been a collection of infectious material and a\nreasonably complete identification and study of the agent. It hadn't\nbeen made. There was probably some other emergency at the time, and it\nslipped by. Calhoun, whose career was not to be spent in this sector,\nresolved on a blistering report about this negligence and its\nconsequences.\n\nHe kept himself casually busy, ignoring the girl. A Med Ship man has\nresources of study and meditation with which to occupy himself during\noverdrive travel from one planet to another. Calhoun made use of those\nresources. He acted as if he were completely unconscious of the\nstowaway. But Murgatroyd watched her with charmed attention.\n\nHours after her discovery, she said uneasily, \"Please?\"\n\nCalhoun looked up.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I don't know exactly how things stand.\"\n\n\"You are a stowaway,\" said Calhoun. \"Legally, I have the right to put\nyou out the airlock. It doesn't seem necessary. There's a cabin. When\nyou're sleepy, use it. Murgatroyd and I can make out quite well out\nhere. When you're hungry, you now know how to get something to eat.\nWhen we land on Orede, you'll probably go about whatever business you\nhave there. That's all.\"\n\nShe stared at him.\n\n\"But you don't believe what I've told you!\"\n\n\"No,\" agreed Calhoun, but didn't add to the statement.\n\n\"But--I will tell you,\" she offered. \"The police were after me. I had\nto get away from Weald! I had to! I'd stolen--\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"If you were a thief, you'd say anything in the world\nexcept that you were a thief. You're not ready to tell the truth yet.\nYou don't have to, so why tell me anything? I suggest that you get\nsome sleep. Incidentally, there's no lock on the cabin door because\nthere's only supposed to be one person on this ship at a time. But you\ncan brace a chair to fasten it somehow or other. Good night.\"\n\nShe rose slowly. Twice her lips parted as if to speak again, but then\nshe went into the other cabin and closed herself in. There was the\nsound of a chair being wedged against the door.\n\nMurgatroyd blinked at the place where she'd disappeared and then\nclimbed up into Calhoun's lap, with complete assurance of welcome. He\nsettled himself and was silent for moments. Then he said, \"_Chee!_\"\n\n\"I believe you're right,\" said Calhoun. \"She doesn't belong on Weald,\nor with the conditioning she'd have had, there'd be only one place\nshe'd dread worse than Orede, which would be Dara. But I doubt she'd\nbe afraid to land even on Dara.\"\n\nMurgatroyd liked to be talked to. He liked to pretend that he carried\non a conversation, like humans.\n\n\"_Chee-chee!_\" he said with conviction.\n\n\"Definitely,\" agreed Calhoun. \"She's not doing this for her personal\nadvantage. Whatever she thinks she'd doing, it's more important to her\nthan her own life. Murgatroyd....\"\n\n\"_Chee?_\" said Murgatroyd in an inquiring tone.\n\n\"There are wild cattle on Orede,\" said Calhoun. \"Herds and herds of\nthem. I have a suspicion that somebody's been shooting them. Lots of\nthem. Do you agree? Don't you think that a lot of cattle have been\nslaughtered on Orede lately?\"\n\nMurgatroyd yawned. He settled himself still more comfortably in\nCalhoun's lap.\n\n\"_Chee_,\" he said drowsily.\n\nHe went to sleep, while Calhoun continued the examination of highly\ncondensed information. Presently he looked up the normal rate of\nincrease, with other data, among herds of _bovis domesticus_ in a wild\nstate, on planets where there are no natural enemies.\n\nIt wasn't unheard-of for a world to be stocked with useful types of\nTerran fauna and flora before it was attempted to be colonized. Terran\nlife-forms could play the devil with alien ecological systems--very\nmuch to humanity's benefit. Familiar microorganisms and a standard\nvegetation added to the practicality of human settlements on otherwise\nalien worlds. But sometimes the results were strange.\n\nThey weren't often so strange, however, as to cause some hundreds of\nmen to pack themselves frantically aboard a cargo ship which couldn't\npossibly sustain them, so that every man must die while the ship was\nin overdrive.\n\nStill, by the time Calhoun turned in on a spare pneumatic mattress, he\nhad calculated that as few as a dozen head of cattle, turned loose on\na suitable planet, would have increased to herds of thousands or tens\nor even hundreds of thousands in much less time than had probably\nelapsed.\n\nThe Med Ship drove on in seemingly absolute solidity, with no sound\nfrom without, with no sight to be seen outside, with no evidence at\nall that it was not buried in the heart of a planet instead of\nflashing through emptiness at a speed so great as to have no meaning.\n\nNext ship-day the girl looked oddly at Calhoun when she appeared in\nthe control room. Murgatroyd regarded her with great interest. Calhoun\nnodded politely and went back to what he'd been doing before she\nappeared.\n\n\"Shall I have breakfast?\" she asked uncertainly.\n\n\"Murgatroyd and I have,\" he told her. \"Why not?\"\n\nSilently, she operated the food-readier. She ate. Calhoun gave a very\ngood portrayal of a man who will respond politely when spoken to, but\nwho was busy with activities remote from stowaways.\n\nAbout noon, ship-time, she asked, \"When will we get to Orede?\"\n\nCalhoun told her absently, as if he were thinking of something else.\n\n\"What--what do you think happened there? I mean, to make that tragedy\nin the ship.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Calhoun. \"But I disagree with the authorities on\nWeald. I don't think it was a planned atrocity of the blueskins.\"\n\n\"Wh-what are blueskins?\" asked the girl.\n\nCalhoun turned around and looked at her directly.\n\n\"When lying,\" he said mildly, \"you tell as much by what you pretend\nisn't, as by what you pretend is. You know what blueskins are!\"\n\n\"But what do you think they are?\" she asked.\n\n\"There used to be a human disease called smallpox,\" said Calhoun.\n\"When people recovered from it, they were usually marked. Their skin\nhad little scar pits here and there. At one time, back on Earth, it\nwas expected that everybody would catch smallpox sooner or later, and\na large percentage would die of it.\n\n\"And it was so much a matter of course that if they printed a picture\nof a criminal they never mentioned it if he were pock-marked. It was\nno distinction. But if he didn't have the markings, they'd mention\nthat!\" He paused. \"Those pock-marks weren't hereditary, but otherwise\na blueskin is like a man who had them. He can't be anything else!\"\n\n\"Then you think they're human?\"\n\n\"There's never yet been a case of reverse evolution,\" said Calhoun.\n\"Maybe Pithecanthropus had a monkey uncle, but no Pithecanthropus ever\nwent monkey.\"\n\nShe turned abruptly away. But she glanced at him often during that\nday. He continued to busy himself with those activities which make Med\nShip life consistent with retained sanity.\n\nNext day she asked without preliminary, \"Don't you believe the\nblueskins planned for the ship with the dead men to arrive at Weald\nand spread plague there?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Calhoun.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"It couldn't possibly work,\" Calhoun told her. \"With only dead men on\nboard, the ship wouldn't arrive at a place where the landing-grid\ncould bring it down. So that would be no good. And plague-stricken\nliving men wouldn't try to conceal that they had the plague. They\nmight ask for help, but they'd know they'd instantly be killed on\nWeald if they were found to be plague victims. So that would be no\ngood, either! No, the ship wasn't intended to land plague on Weald.\"\n\n\"Are you friendly to blueskins?\" she asked uncertainly.\n\n\"Within reason,\" said Calhoun, \"I am a well-wisher to all the human\nrace. You're slipping, though. When using the word _blueskin_ you\nshould say it uncomfortably, as if it were a word no refined person\nliked to pronounce. You don't. We'll land on Orede tomorrow, by the\nway. If you ever intend to tell me the truth, there's not much time\nleft.\"\n\nShe bit her lips. Twice, during the remainder of the day, she faced\nhim and opened her mouth as if to speak, and then turned away again.\nCalhoun shrugged. He had fairly definite ideas about her, by now. He\ncarefully kept them tentative, but no girl born and raised on Weald\nwould willingly go to Orede, with all of Weald believing that a\nshipload of miners preferred death to remaining there. It tied in,\nlike everything else that was unpleasant, to blueskins. Nobody from\nWeald would dream of landing on Orede! Not now!\n\nA little before the Med Ship was due to break out from overdrive, the\ngirl said very carefully, \"You've been very kind. I'd like to thank\nyou. I--I didn't really believe I would live to get to Orede.\"\n\nCalhoun raised his eyebrows.\n\n\"I wish I could tell you everything you want to know,\" she added\nregretfully. \"I think you're ... really decent. But some thing....\"\n\nCalhoun said caustically, \"You've told me a great deal. You weren't\nborn on Weald. You weren't raised there. The people of Dara--notice\nthat I don't say blueskins, though they are--the people of Dara have\nmade at least one space ship since Weald threatened them with\nextermination. There is probably a new food shortage on Dara now,\nleading to pure desperation. Most likely it's bad enough to make them\nrisk landing on Orede to kill cattle and freeze beef to help. They've\nworked out--\"\n\nShe gasped and sprang to her feet. She snatched out the tiny blaster\nin her pocket. She pointed it waveringly at him.\n\n\"I have to kill you!\" she cried desperately. \"I--I have to!\"\n\nCalhoun reached out. She tugged despairingly at the blaster's trigger.\nNothing happened. Before she could realize that she hadn't turned off\nthe safety, Calhoun twisted the weapon from her fingers. He stepped\nback.\n\n\"Good girl!\" he said approvingly. \"I'll give this back to you when we\nland. And thanks. Thanks very much!\"\n\nShe wrung her hands. Then she stared at him.\n\n\"Thanks? When I tried to kill you?\"\n\n\"Of course!\" said Calhoun. \"I'd made guesses. I couldn't know that\nthey were right. When you tried to kill me, you confirmed every one.\nNow, when we land on Orede I'm going to get you to try to put me in\ntouch with your friends. It's going to be tricky, because they must be\npretty well scared about that ship. But it's a highly desirable thing\nto get done!\"\n\nHe went to the ships' control board and sat down before it.\n\n\"Twenty minutes to breakhour,\" he observed.\n\nMurgatroyd peered out of his little cubbyhole. His eyes were anxious.\n_Tormals_ are amiable little creatures. During the days in overdrive,\nCalhoun had paid less than the usual amount of attention to\nMurgatroyd, while the girl was fascinating.\n\nThey'd made friends, awkwardly on the girl's part, very pleasantly on\nMurgatroyd's. But only moments ago there had been bitter emotion in\nthe air. Murgatroyd had fled to his cubbyhole to escape it. He was\ndistressed. Now that there was silence again, he peered out unhappily.\n\n\"_Chee?_\" he queried plaintively. \"_Chee-chee-chee?_\"\n\nCalhoun said matter-of-factly, \"It's all right, Murgatroyd. If we\naren't blasted as we try to land, we should be able to make friends\nwith everybody and get something accomplished.\"\n\nThe statement was hopelessly inaccurate.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nThere was no answer from the ground when breakout came and Calhoun\ndrove the Med Ship to a favourable position for a call. He patiently\nrepeated, over and over again, that the Med Ship _Aesclipus Twenty_\nnotified its arrival and requested coordinates for landing. He added\nthat its mass was fifty standard tons and that the purpose of its\nvisit was a planetary health inspection.\n\nBut there was no reply. There should have been a crisp description of\nthe direction from the planet's center at which, a certain time so\nmany hours or minutes later, the force-fields of the grid would find\nit convenient to lock onto and lower the Med Ship. But the\ncommunicator remained silent.\n\n\"There is a landing-grid,\" said Calhoun, frowning, \"and if they're\nusing it to load fresh meat for Dara, from the herds I'm told about,\nit should be manned. But they don't seem to intend to answer. Maybe\nthey think that if they pretend I'm not here I'll go away.\"\n\nHe reflected, and his frown deepened.\n\n\"If I didn't know what I know, I might. So if I land on emergency\nrockets the blueskins down below may decide that I come from Weald.\nAnd in that case it would be reasonable to blast me before I could\nland and unload some fighting men. On the other hand, no ship from\nWeald would conceivably land without impassioned assurance that it\nwas safe. It would drop bombs.\" He turned to the girl. \"How many\nDarians down below?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"You don't know,\" said Calhoun, \"or won't tell, yet. But they ought to\nbe told about the arrival of that ship at Weald, and what Weald thinks\nabout it! My guess is that you came to tell them. It isn't likely that\nDara gets news directly from Weald. Where were you put ashore from\nDara, when you set out to be a spy?\"\n\nHer lips parted to speak, but she compressed them tightly. She shook\nher head again.\n\n\"It must have been plenty far away,\" said Calhoun restlessly. \"Your\npeople would have built a ship, and made fine forged papers for it,\nand they'd travel so far from this part of space that when they landed\nnobody would think of Dara. They'd use make-up to cover the blue\nspots, but maybe it was so far away that blueskins had never been\nheard of!\"\n\nHer face looked pinched, but she did not reply.\n\n\"Then they'd land half a dozen of you, with a supply of make-up for\nthe blue patches. And you'd separate, and take ships that went various\nroundabout ways, and arrive on Weald one by one, to see what could be\ndone there to--\" He stopped. \"When did you find out positively that\nthere wasn't any plague any more?\"\n\nShe began to grow pale.\n\n\"I'm not a mind reader,\" said Calhoun. \"But it adds up. You're from\nDara. You've been on Weald. It's practically certain that there are\nother ... agents, if you like that word better, on Weald. And there\nhasn't been a plague on Weald so you people aren't carriers of it. But\nyou knew it in advance, I think. How'd you learn? Did a ship in some\nsort of trouble land there, on Dara?\"\n\n\"Y--yes,\" said the girl. \"We wouldn't let it go again. But the people\ndidn't catch--they didn't die. They lived--\"\n\nShe stopped short.\n\n\"It's not fair to trap me!\" she cried passionately. \"It's not fair!\"\n\n\"I'll stop,\" said Calhoun.\n\nHe turned to the control board. The Med Ship was only planetary\ndiameters from Orede, now, and the electron telescope showed shining\nstars in leisurely motion across its screen. Then a huge, gibbous\nshining shape appeared, and there were irregular patches of that muddy\ncolor which is seabottom, and varicolored areas which were plains and\nforests. Also there were mountains. Calhoun steadied the image, and\nsquinted at it.\n\n\"The mine,\" he observed, \"was found by members of a hunting party,\nkilling wild cattle for sport.\"\n\nEven a small planet has many millions of square miles of surface, and\na single human installation on a whole world will not be easy to find\nby random search. But there were clues to this one. Men hunting for\nsport would not choose a tropic nor an arctic climate to hunt in. So\nif they found a mineral deposit, it would have been in a temperate\nzone.\n\nCattle would not be found deep in a mountainous terrain. The mine\nwould not be on a prairie. The settlement on Orede, then, would be\nnear the edge of mountains, not far from a prairie such as wild cattle\nwould frequent, and it would be in a temperate climate.\n\nForested areas could be ruled out. And there would be a landing-grid.\nHandling only one ship at a time, it might be a very small grid. It\ncould be only hundreds of yards across and less than half a mile high.\nBut its shadow would be distinctive.\n\nCalhoun searched among low mountains near unforested prairie in a\ntemperate zone. He found a speck. He enlarged it manyfold. It was the\nmine on Orede. There were heaps of tailings. There was something which\ncast a long, lacy shadow: the landing-grid.\n\n\"But they don't answer our call,\" observed Calhoun, \"so we go down\nunwelcomed.\"\n\nHe inverted the Med Ship and the emergency rockets boomed. The ship\nplunged planetward.\n\nA long time later it was deep in the planet's atmosphere. The noise of\nits rockets had become thunderous, with air to carry and to reinforce\nthe sound.\n\n\"Hold on to something, Murgatroyd,\" commanded Calhoun. \"We may have to\ndodge some ack.\"\n\nBut nothing came up from below. The Med Ship again inverted itself,\nand its rockets pointed toward the planet and poured out pencil-thin,\nblue-white, high-velocity flames. It checked slightly, but continued\nto descend. It was not directly above the grid.\n\nIt swept downward until almost level with the peaks of the mountains\nin which the mine lay. It tilted again, and swept onward over the\nmountaintops, and then tilted once more and went racing up the valley\nin which the landing-grid was plainly visible. Calhoun swung it on an\nerratic course, lest there be opposition.\n\nBut there was no sign. Then the rockets bellowed, and the ship slowed\nits forward motion, hovered momentarily, and settled to solidity\noutside the framework of the grid. The grid was small, as Calhoun\nreasoned. But it reached interminably toward the sky.\n\nThe rockets cut off. Slender as the flames had been, they'd melted and\nbored thin drill-holes deep into the soil. Molten rock boiled and\nbubbled down below. But there seemed no other sound. There was no\nother motion. There was absolute stillness all around. But when\nCalhoun switched on the outside microphones a faint, sweet melange of\nhigh-pitched chirpings came from tiny creatures hidden under the\nvegetation of the mountainsides.\n\nCalhoun put a blaster in his pocket and stood up.\n\n\"We'll see what it looks like outside,\" he said with a certain\ngrimness. \"I don't quite believe what the vision screens show.\"\n\nMinutes later he stepped down to the ground from the Med Ship's exit\nport. The ship had landed perhaps a hundred feet from what once had\nbeen a wooden building. In it, ore from the mines was concentrated and\nthe useless tailings carried away by a conveyer belt to make a\nmonstrous pile of broken stone. But there was no longer a building.\n\nNext to it there had been a structure containing an ore-crusher. The\nmassive machinery could still be seen, but the structure was in\nfragments. Next to that, again, had been the shaft-head shelters of\nthe mine. They also were shattered practically to matchsticks.\n\nThe look of the ground about the building sites was simply and purely\nimpossible. It was a mass of hoofprints. Cattle by thousands and tens\nof thousands had trampled everything. Cattle had burst in the wooden\nsides of the buildings. Cattle had piled themselves up against the\nbeams upholding roofs until the buildings collapsed.\n\nThen cattle had gone plunging over the wrecked buildings until there\nwas nothing left but indescribable chaos. Many, many cattle had died\nin the crush. There were heaps of dead beasts about the metal girders\nwhich were the foundation of the landing-grid. The air was tainted by\nthe smell of carrion.\n\nThe settlement had been destroyed, positively by stampeded cattle in\ntens or hundreds of thousands charging blindly through and over and\nupon it. Senselessly, they'd trampled each other to horrible\nshapelessness. The mine shaft was not choked, because enormously\nstrong timbers had fallen across and blocked it. But everything else\nwas pure destruction.\n\nCalhoun said evenly, \"Clever! Very clever! You can't blame men when\nbeasts stampede. We should accept the evidence that some monstrous\nherd, making its way through a mountain pass, somehow went crazy and\nbolted for the plains. This settlement got in the way and it was too\nbad for the settlement! Everything's explained, except the ship that\nwent to Weald.\n\n\"A cattle stampede, yes. Anybody can believe that! But there was a man\nstampede. Men stampeded into the ship as blindly as the cattle\ntrampled down this little town. The ship stampeded off into space as\ninsanely as the cattle. But a stampede of men and cattle, in the same\nplace? That's a little too much!\"\n\n\"But what--\"\n\n\"How,\" asked Calhoun directly, \"do you intend to get in touch with\nyour friends here?\"\n\n\"I--I don't know,\" she said, distressed. \"But if the ship stays here,\nthey're bound to come and see why. Won't they? Or will they?\"\n\n\"If they're sane, they won't,\" said Calhoun. \"The one undesirable\nthing, here, would be human footprints on top of cattle tracks. If\nyour friends are a meat-getting party from Dara, as I believe, they\nshould cover up their tracks, get off-planet as fast as possible, and\npray that no signs of their former presence are ever discovered. That\nwould be their best first move, certainly!\"\n\n\"What should I do?\" she asked helplessly.\n\n\"I'm far from sure. At a guess, and for the moment, probably nothing.\nI'll work something out. I've got the devil of a job before me,\nthough. I can't spend but so much time here.\"\n\n\"You can leave me here....\"\n\nHe grunted and turned away. It was naturally unthinkable that he\nshould leave another human being on a supposedly uninhabited planet,\nwith the knowledge that it might actually be uninhabited, and the\nfuture knowledge that any visitors would have the strongest of\npossible reasons to hide themselves away.\n\nHe believed that there were Darians here, and the girl in the Med\nship, so he also believed, was also a Darian. But any who might be\nhiding had so much to lose if they were discovered that they might be\nhundreds or even thousands of miles from anywhere a space ship would\nnormally land--if they hadn't fled after the incident of the\nspaceship's departure with its load of doomed passengers.\n\nConsidered detachedly, the odds were that there was again a food\nshortage on Dara; that blueskins, in desperation, had raided or were\nraiding or would raid the cattle herds of Orede for food to carry back\nto their home planet; that somehow the miners on Orede had found that\nthey had blueskin neighbors, and died of the consequences of their\nterror. It was a risky guess to make on such evidence as Calhoun\nconsidered he had, but no other guess was possible.\n\nIf his guess were right, he was under some obligation to do exactly\nwhat he believed the girl considered her mission--to warn all\nblueskins that Weald would presently try to find them on Orede, when\nall hell must break loose upon Dara for punishment. But if there were\nmen here, he couldn't leave a written warning for them in default of\nfriendly contact.\n\nThey might not find it, and a search party of Wealdians might. All he\ncould possibly do was try to make contact and give warning by such\nmeans as would leave no evidence behind that he'd done so. Weald\nwould consider a warning sure proof of blueskin guilt.\n\nIt was not satisfactory to be limited to broadcasts which might or\nmight not be picked up, and were unlikely to be acknowledged. But he\nsettled down with the communicator to make the attempt.\n\nHe called first on a GC wave length and form. It was unlikely that\nblueskins would use general communication bands to keep in touch with\neach other, but it had to be tried. He broadcast, tuned as broadly as\npossible, and went up and down the GC spectrum, repeating his warning\npainstakingly and listening without hope for a reply.\n\nHe did find one spot on the dial where there was re-radiation of his\nmessage, as if from a tuned receiver. But he could not get a fix on\nit: nobody might be listening. He exhausted the normal communication\npattern. Then he broadcast on old-fashioned amplitude modulation which\na modern communicator would not pick up at all, and which therefore\nmight be used by men in hiding.\n\nHe worked for a long time. Then he shrugged and gave it up. He'd\nrepeated to absolute tedium the facts that any Darians--blueskins--on\nOrede ought to know. There'd been no answer. And it was all too likely\nthat if he'd been received, that those who heard him took his message\nfor a trick to discover if there were any hearers.\n\nHe clicked off at last and stood up, shaking his head. Suddenly the\nMed Ship seemed empty. Then he saw Murgatroyd staring vexedly at the\nexit port. The inner door of that small airlock was closed. The\ntelltale light said the outer door was not locked. Someone had gone\nout quietly. The girl. Of course.\n\nCalhoun said angrily, \"How long ago, Murgatroyd?\"\n\n\"_Chee!_\" said Murgatroyd indignantly.\n\nIt wasn't an answer, but it showed that Murgatroyd was vexed that he'd\nbeen left behind. He and the girl were close friends, now. If she'd\nleft Murgatroyd in the ship when he wanted to go with her, then she\nwasn't coming back.\n\nCalhoun swore. He made certain she was not in the ship. He flipped the\noutside-speaker switch and said curtly into the microphone, \"Coffee!\nMurgatroyd and I are having coffee. Will you come back, please?\"\n\nHe repeated the call, and repeated it again. Multiplied as his voice\nwas by the speakers, she should hear him within a mile. She did not\nappear. He went to a small and inconspicuous closet and armed himself.\nA Med Ship man was not ever expected to fight, but there were\nblast-rifles available for extreme emergency.\n\nWhen he'd slung a power-pack over his shoulder and reached the\nairlock, there was still no sign of his late stowaway. He stood in the\nairlock door for long minutes, staring angrily about. Almost certainly\nshe wouldn't be looking in the mountains for men of Dara come here for\ncattle. He used a pair of binoculars, first at low-magnification to\nsearch as wide an area down-valley as possible, and then at highest\npower to search the most likely routes.\n\nHe found a small, bobbing speck beyond a faraway hill crest. It was\nher head. It went down below the hilltop.\n\nHe snapped a command to Murgatroyd, and when the _tormal_ was on the\nground outside, he locked the port with that combination that nobody\nbut a Med Ship man was at all likely to discover or use.\n\n\"She's an idiot!\" he told Murgatroyd sourly. \"Come along! We've got to\nbe idiots too!\"\n\nHe set out in pursuit.\n\nThere was blue sky overhead, as was inevitable on any\noxygen-atmosphere planet of a Sol-type yellow sun. There were\nmountains, as is universal in planets whose surface rises and falls\nand folds and bends from the effects of weather or vulcanism. There\nwere plants, as has come about wherever microorganisms have broken\ndown rock to a state where it can nourish vegetation. And naturally\nthere were animals.\n\nThere were even trees of severely practical design, and underbrush and\nground-cover equivalent to grass. There was, in short, a perfectly\npredictable ecological system on Orede. The organic molecules involved\nin life here would be made up of the same elements in the same\ncombinations as elsewhere where the same conditions of temperature and\nmoisture and sunshine obtained.\n\nIt was a distinctly Earthlike world, as it could not help but be, and\nit was reasonable for cattle to thrive and increase here. Only men's\nminds kept it from being a place where humans would thrive, too.\n\nBut only Calhoun would have considered the splintered settlement a\nproof of that last.\n\nThe girl had a long start. Twice Calhoun came to places where she\ncould have chosen either of two ways onward. Each time he had to\ndetermine which she'd followed. That cost time. Then the mountains\nabruptly ended and a vast undulating plain stretched away to the\nhorizon. There were at least two large masses and many smaller clumps\nof what could only be animals gathered together. Cattle.\n\nBut here the girl was plainly in view. Calhoun increased his stride.\nHe began to gain on her. She did not look behind.\n\nMurgatroyd said \"_Chee!_\" in a complaining tone.\n\n\"I should have left you behind,\" agreed Calhoun dourly, \"but there was\nand is a chance I won't get back. You'll have to keep on hiking.\"\n\nHe plodded on. His memory of the terrain around the mining settlement\ntold him that there was no definite destination in the girl's mind.\nBut she was in no such despair as to want deliberately to be lost.\nShe'd guessed, Calhoun believed, that if there were Darians on the\nplanet, they'd keep the landing-grid under observation.\n\nIf they saw her leave that area and could see that she was alone, they\nshould intercept her to find out the meaning of the Med Ship's\nlanding. Then she could identify herself as one of them and give them\nthe terribly necessary warning of Weald's suspicions.\n\n\"But,\" said Calhoun sourly, \"if she's right, they'll have seen me\nmarching after her now, which spoils her scheme. And I'd like to help\nit, but the way she's going is too dangerous!\"\n\nHe went down into one of the hollows of the uneven plain. He saw a\nclump of a dozen or so cattle a little distance away. The bull looked\nup and snorted. The cows regarded him truculently. Their air was not\none of bovine tranquility.\n\nHe was up the farther hillside and out of sight before the bull worked\nhimself up to a charge. Then Calhoun suddenly remembered one of the\nitems in the data about cattle he'd looked into just the other day. He\nfelt himself grow pale.\n\n\"Murgatroyd!\" he said sharply. \"We've got to catch up! Fast! Stay with\nme if you can, but--\" he was jog-trotting as he spoke--\"even if you\nget lost I have to hurry!\"\n\nHe ran fifty paces and walked fifty paces. He ran fifty and walked\nfifty. He saw her, atop a rolling of the ground. She came to a full\nstop. He ran. He saw her turn to retrace her steps. He flung off the\nsafety of the blast-rifle and let off a roaring blast at the ground\nfor her to hear.\n\nSuddenly she was fleeing desperately, toward him. He plunged on. She\nvanished down into a hollow. Horns appeared over the hillcrest she'd\njust left. Cattle appeared. Four, a dozen fifteen, twenty! They moved\nominously in her wake.\n\nHe saw her again, running frantically over another upward swell of\nthe prairie. He let off another blast to guide her. He ran on at top\nspeed with Murgatroyd trailing anxiously behind. From time to time\nMurgatroyd called \"_Chee-chee-chee!_\" in frightened pleading not to be\nabandoned.\n\nMore cattle appeared against the horizon. Fifty or a hundred. They\ncame after the first clump. The first group of a bull and his harem\nwere moving faster, now. The girl fled from them, but it is the\ninstinct of beef-cattle on the open range--Calhoun had learned it only\ntwo days before--to charge any human they find on foot. A mounted man\nto their dim minds is a creature to be tolerated or fled from, but a\nhuman on foot is to be crushed and stamped and gored.\n\nThose in the lead were definitely charging now, with heads bent low.\nThe bull charged furiously with shut eyes, as bulls do, but the cows,\nmany times more deadly, charged with their eyes wide open and wickedly\nalert, and with a lumbering speed much greater than the girl could\nmanage.\n\nShe came up over the last rise, chalky-white and gasping, her hair\nflying, in the last extremity of terror. The nearest of the pursuing\ncattle were within ten yards when Calhoun fired from twenty yards\nbeyond. One creature bellowed as the blast-bolt struck.\n\nIt went down and others crashed into it and swept over it, and more\ncame on. The girl saw Calhoun now, and ran toward him, panting. He\nknelt very deliberately and began to check the charge by shooting the\nleading animals.\n\nHe did not succeed. There were more cattle following the first, and\nmore and more behind them. It appeared that all the cattle on the\nplain joined in the blind and senseless charge. The thudding of hoofs\nbecame a mutter and then a rumble and then a growl.\n\nPlunging, clumsy figures rushed past on either side. But horns and\nheads heaved up over the mound of animals Calhoun had shot. He shot\nthem too. More and more cattle came pounding past the rampart of his\nvictims, but always, it seemed, some elected to climb the heap of\ntheir dead and dying fellows, and Calhoun shot and shot....\n\nBut he split the herd. The foremost animals had been charging a\nsighted human enemy. Others had followed because it is the instinct of\ncattle to join their running fellows in whatever crazed urgency they\nfeel. There was a dense, pounding, wailing, grunting, puffing, raising\nthick and impenetrable clouds of dust which hid everything but\ngalloping beasts going past on either side.\n\nIt lasted for minutes. Then the thunder of hoofs diminished. It ended\nabruptly, and Calhoun and the girl were left alone with the gruesome\npile of animals which had divided the charging herd into two parts.\nThey could see the rears of innumerable running animals, stupidly\ncontinuing the charge, hardly different, now, from a stampede, whose\noriginal objective none now remembered.\n\nCalhoun thoughtfully touched the barrel of his blast-rifle and winced\nat its scorching heat.\n\n\"I just realized,\" he said coldly, \"that I don't know your name. What\nis it?\"\n\n\"Maril,\" said the girl. She swallowed. \"Th--thank you.\"\n\n\"Maril,\" said Calhoun, \"you are an idiot! It was half-witted at best\nto go off by yourself! You could have been lost! You could have cost\nme days of hunting for you, days badly needed for more important\nmatters!\"\n\nHe stopped and took breath. \"You may have spoiled what little chance\nI've got to do something about the plans Weald's already making! You\nhave just acted with the most concentrated folly, and the most\nmagnificent imbecility that you or anybody else could manage!\"\n\nHe said more bitterly still, \"And I had to leave Murgatroyd behind to\nget to you in time! He was right in the path of that charge!\"\n\nHe turned away from her and said dourly, \"All right! Come on back to\nthe ship. We'll go to Dara. We'd have to, anyhow. But Murgatroyd--\"\n\nThen he heard a very small sneeze. Out of a rolling wall of\nstill-roiling dust, Murgatroyd appeared forlornly. He was\ndust-covered, and draggled, and his tail dropped, and he sneezed\nagain. He moved as if he could barely put one paw before another, but\nat sight of Calhoun he sneezed yet again and said \"_Chee!_\" in a\ndisconsolate voice. Then he sat down and waited for Calhoun to come\nand pick him up.\n\nWhen Calhoun did so, Murgatroyd clung to him pathetically and said\n\"_Chee-chee!_\" and again \"_Chee-chee!_\" with the intonation of one\ntelling of incredible horrors and disasters endured. And as a matter\nof fact the escape of a small animal like Murgatroyd was remarkable.\nHe'd escaped the trampling hoofs of at least hundreds of charging\nanimals. Luck must have played a great part in it, but an hysterical\nagility in dodging must have been required, too.\n\nCalhoun headed back for the valley where the settlement had been, and\nthe Med Ship was. Murgatroyd clung to his neck. The girl Maril\nfollowed discouragedly. She was at that age when girls--and men of\ncorresponding type--can grow most passionately devoted to ideals or\ncauses in default of a promising personal romance. When concerned with\nsuch causes they become splendidly confident that whatever they decide\nto do is sensible if only it is dramatic. But Maril was shaken, now.\n\nCalhoun did not speak to her again. He led the way. A mile back toward\nthe mountains, they began to see stragglers from the now-vanished\nherd. A little farther, those stragglers began to notice them. It\nwould have been a matter of no moment if they'd been domesticated\ndairy cattle, but these were range cattle gone wild. Twice, Calhoun\nhad to use his blast-rifle to discourage incipient charges by\nirritated bulls or even more irritated cows. Those with calves darkly\nsuspected Calhoun of designs upon their offspring.\n\nIt was a relief to enter the valley again. But it was two miles more\nto the landing-grid with the Med Ship beside it and the reek of\ncarrion in the air.\n\nThey were perhaps two hundred feet from the ship when a blast-rifle\ncrashed and its bolt whined past Calhoun so close that he felt the\nmonstrous heat. There had been no challenge. There was no warning.\nThere was simply a shot which came horribly close to ending Calhoun's\ncareer in a completely arbitrary fashion.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nFive minutes later Calhoun had located one would-be killer behind a\nmass of splintered planking that once had been a wall. He set the wood\nafire by a blaster-bolt and then viciously sent other bolts all around\nthe man it had sheltered when he fled from the flames. He could have\nkilled him ten times over, but it was more desirable to open\ncommunication. So he missed intentionally.\n\nMaril had cried out that she came from Dara and had word for them, but\nthey did not answer. There were three men with heavy-duty\nblast-rifles. One was the one Calhoun had burned out of his hiding\nplace. That man's rifle exploded when the flames hit it. Two remained.\n\nOne, so Calhoun presently discovered--was working his way behind\nunderbrush to a shelf from which he could shoot down at Calhoun.\nCalhoun had dropped into a hollow and pulled Maril to cover at the\nfirst shot. The second man happily planned to get to a point where he\ncould shoot him like a fish in a barrel.\n\nThe third man had fired half a dozen times and then disappeared.\nCalhoun estimated that he intended to get around to the rear, hoping\nthere was no protection from that direction for Calhoun. It would take\nsome time for him to manage it.\n\nSo Calhoun industriously concentrated his fire on the man trying to\nget above him. He was behind a boulder, not too dissimilar to\nCalhoun's breastwork. Calhoun set fire to the brush at the point at\nwhich the other man aimed. That, then, made his effort useless.\n\nThen Calhoun sent a dozen bolts at the other man's rocky shield. It\nheated up. Steam rose in a whitish mass and blew directly away from\nCalhoun. He saw that antagonist flee. He saw him so clearly that he\nwas positive that there was a patch of blue pigment on the right-hand\nside of the back of his neck.\n\nHe grunted and swung to find the third. That man moved through thick\nundergrowth, and Calhoun set it on fire in a neat pattern of spreading\nflames. Evidently, these men had had no training in battle tactics\nwith blast-rifles. The third man also had to get away. He did. But\nsomething from him arched through the smoke. It fell to the ground\ndirectly upwind from Calhoun. White smoke puffed up violently.\n\nIt was instinct that made Calhoun react as he did. He jerked the girl\nMaril to her feet and rushed her toward the Med Ship. Smoke from the\nflung bomb upwind barely swirled around him and missed Maril\naltogether. Calhoun, though, got a whiff of something strange, not\nscorched or burning vegetation at all. He ceased to breathe and\nplunged onward. In clear air he emptied his lungs and refilled them.\nThey were then halfway to the ship, with Murgatroyd prancing on ahead.\n\nBut then Calhoun's heart began to pound furiously. His muscles\ntwitched and tensed. He felt extraordinary symptoms like an extreme of\nagitation. He swore, but a Med Ship man would not react to such\nsymptoms as a non-medically-trained man would have done. Calhoun was\nfamiliar enough with tear gas, used by police on some planets.\n\nBut this was different and worse. Even as he helped and urged Maril\nonward, he automatically considered his sensations, and had it--panic\ngas. Police did not use it because panic is worse than rioting.\nCalhoun felt all the physical symptoms of fear and of gibbering\nterror.\n\nA man whose mind yields to terror experiences certain physical\nsensations: wildly beating heart, tensed and twitching muscles, and a\nfrantic impulse to convulsive action. A man in whom those physical\nsensations are induced by other means will, ordinarily, find his mind\nyielding to terror.\n\nCalhoun couldn't combat his feelings, but his clinical attitude\nenabled him to act despite them. The three from Weald reached the base\nof the Med Ship. One of their enemies had lost his rifle and need not\nbe counted. Another had fled from flames and might be ignored for some\nmoments, anyhow. But a blast-bolt struck the ship's metal hull only\nfeet from Calhoun, and he whipped around to the other side and let\nloose a staccato rat-tat-tat of fire which emptied the rifle of all\nits charges.\n\nThen he opened the airlock door, hating the fact that he shook and\ntrembled. He urged the girl and Murgatroyd in. He slammed the outer\nairlock door just as another blast-bolt hit.\n\n\"They--they don't realize,\" said Maril desperately. \"If they only\nknew....\"\n\n\"Talk to them, if you like,\" said Calhoun. His teeth chattered and he\nraged, because the symptom was of terror he denied.\n\nHe pushed a button on the control board. He pointed to a microphone.\nHe got at an oxygen bottle and inhaled deeply. Oxygen, obviously,\nshould be an antidote for panic, since the symptoms of terror act to\nincrease the oxygenation of the bloodstream and muscles, and to make\nsuperhuman exertion possible if necessary.\n\nBreathing ninety-five percent oxygen produced the effect the\nterror-inspiring gas strove for, so his heart slowed nearly to normal\nand his body relaxed. He held out his hand and it did not tremble.\nHe'd been affronted to see it shake uncontrollably when he pushed the\nmicrophone button for Maril.\n\nHe turned to her. She hadn't spoken into the mike.\n\n\"They may not be from Dara!\" she said shakily. \"I just thought! They\ncould be somebody else, maybe criminals who planned to raid the mine\nfor a shipload of its ore.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Calhoun. \"I saw one of them clearly enough to be\nsure. But they're skeptical characters. I'm afraid there may be more\non the way here from wherever they keep themselves. Anyhow, now we\nknow some of them are in hearing! I'll take advantage of that and\nwe'll go on.\"\n\nHe took the microphone. An instant later his voice boomed in the\nstillness outside the ship, cutting through the thin shrill whirring\nof invisible small creatures.\n\n\"This is the Med Ship _Aesclipus Twenty_,\" said Calhoun's voice,\namplified to a shout. \"I left Weald four days ago, one day after the\ncargo ship from here arrived with everybody on board dead. On Weald\nthey don't know how it happened, but they suspect blueskins. Sooner or\nlater they'll search here.\n\n\"Get away! Cover up your tracks! Hide all signs that you've ever been\nhere! Get the hell away, fast! One more warning! There's talk of\nfusion-bombing Dara. They're scared! If they find your traces, they'll\nbe still more scared! So cover up your tracks and get away from here!\"\n\nThe many-times-multiplied voice rolled and echoed among the hills. But\nit was very clear. Where it could be heard it could be understood, and\nit could be heard for miles.\n\nBut there was no response to it. Calhoun waited a reasonable time.\nThen he shrugged and seated himself at the control board.\n\n\"It isn't easy,\" he observed, \"to persuade desperate men that they've\noutsmarted themselves! Hold hard, Murgatroyd!\"\n\nThe rockets bellowed. Then there was a tremendous noise to end all\nnoises, and the ship began to climb. It sped up and up and up. By the\ntime it was out of atmosphere it had velocity enough to coast to clear\nspace and Calhoun cut the rockets altogether.\n\nHe busied himself with those astrogational chores which began with\norienting oneself to galactic directions after leaving a planet which\nrotates at its own individual speed. Then one computes the overdrive\ncourse to another planet, from the respecting coordinates of the world\none is leaving and the one one aims for.\n\nThen, in this case at any rate, there was the very finicky task of\npicking out a fourth-magnitude star of whose planets one was his\ndestination. He aimed for it with ultra-fine precision.\n\n\"Overdrive coming,\" he said presently. \"Hold on!\"\n\nSpace reeled. There was nausea and giddiness and a horrible sensation\nof falling in a wildly unlikely spiral. Then stillness, and solidity,\nand the blackness outside the Med Ship. The little craft was in\noverdrive again.\n\nAfter a long while, the girl Maril said uneasily, \"I don't know what\nyou plan now--\"\n\n\"I'm going to Dara,\" said Calhoun. \"On Orede I tried to get the\nblueskins there to get going, fast. Maybe I succeeded. I don't know.\nBut this thing's been mishandled! Even if there's a famine people\nshouldn't do things out of desperation! Being desperate jogs the brain\noff-center. One doesn't think straight!\"\n\n\"I know now that I was ... very foolish.\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" commanded Calhoun. \"I wasn't talking about you. Here I\nrun into a situation that the Med Service should have caught and\ncleaned up generations ago! But it's not only a Med Service\nobligation; it's a current mess! Before I could begin to get at the\nbasic problem, those idiots on Orede--It'd happened before I reached\nWeald! An emotional explosion triggered by a ship full of dead men\nthat nobody intended to kill.\"\n\nMaril shook her head.\n\n\"Those Darian characters,\" said Calhoun, annoyed, \"shouldn't have gone\nto Orede in the first place. If they went there, they should at least\nhave stayed on a continent where there were no people from Weald\ndigging a mine and hunting cattle for sport on their off days! They\ncould be spotted! I believe they were.\n\n\"And again, if it had been a long way from the mine installation, they\ncould probably have wiped out the people who sighted them before they\ncould get back with the news! But it looks like miners saw men\nhunting, and got close enough to see they were blueskins, and then got\nback to the mine with the news!\"\n\nShe waited for him to explain.\n\n\"I know I'm guessing, but it fits!\" he said distastefully. \"So\nsomething had to be done. Either the mining settlement had to be wiped\nout or the story that blueskins were on Orede had to be discredited.\nThe blueskins tried for both. They used panic gas on a herd of cattle\nand it made them crazy and they charged the settlement like the\nfour-footed lunatics they are!\n\n\"And the blueskins used panic gas on the settlement itself as the\ncattle went through. It should have settled the whole business nicely.\nAfter it was over every man in the settlement would believe he'd been\nout of his head for a while, and he'd have the crazy state of the\nsettlement to think about.\n\n\"He wouldn't be sure of what he'd seen or heard before-hand. They\nmight try to verify the blueskin story later, but they wouldn't\nbelieve anything with certainty. It should have worked!\"\n\nAgain she waited.\n\n\"Unfortunately, when the miners panicked, they stampeded into the\nship. Also unfortunately, panic gas got into the ship with them. So\nthey stayed panicked while the astrogator--in panic!--took off. They\nheaded for Weald and threw on the overdrive--which would be set for\nWeald anyhow--because that would be the fastest way to run away from\nwhatever he imagined he feared. But he and all the men on the ship\nwere still crazy with panic from the gas they kept breathing until\nthey died!\"\n\nSilence. After a long interval, Maril asked, \"You don't think the\nDarians intended to kill?\"\n\n\"I think they were stupid!\" said Calhoun angrily. \"Somebody's always\nurging the police to use panic gas in case of public tumult. But it's\ntoo dangerous. Nobody knows what one man will do in a panic. Take a\nhundred or two or three and panic them all, and there's no limit to\ntheir craziness! The whole thing was handled wrong!\"\n\n\"But you don't blame them?\"\n\n\"For being stupid, yes,\" said Calhoun fretfully. \"But if I'd been in\ntheir place, perhaps--\"\n\n\"Where were you born?\" asked Maril suddenly.\n\nCalhoun jerked his head around. \"No! Not where you're guessing, or\nhoping. Not on Dara. Just because I act as if Darians were human\ndoesn't mean I have to be one! I'm a Med Service man, and I'm acting\nas I think I should.\" His tone became exasperated.\n\n\"Dammit, I'm supposed to deal with health situations, actual, and\npossible causes of human deaths! And if Weald thinks it finds proof\nthat blueskins are in space again and caused the death of Wealdians,\nit won't be healthy! They're halfway set anyhow to drop fusion-bombs\non Dara to wipe it out!\"\n\nMaril said fiercely, \"They might as well drop bombs. It'll be quicker\nthan starvation, at least!\"\n\nCalhoun looked at her, more exasperated than before.\n\n\"It is a crop failure again?\" he demanded. When she nodded he said\nbitterly, \"Famine conditions already?\" When she nodded again he said\ndrearily, \"And of course famine is the great-grandfather of health\nproblems! And that's right in my lap with all the rest!\"\n\nHe stood up. Then he sat down again.\n\n\"I'm tired!\" he said flatly. \"I'd like to get some sleep. Would you\nmind taking a book or something and going into the other cabin?\nMurgatroyd and I would like a little relaxation from reality. With\nluck, if I go to sleep, I may only have a nightmare. It'll be a\nterrific improvement on what I'm in now!\"\n\nAlone in the control compartment, he tried to relax, but it was not\npossible. He flung himself into a comfortable chair and brooded. There\nis brooding and brooding. It can be a form of wallowing in self-pity,\nengaged in for emotional satisfaction. But it can be, also, a way of\nbringing out unfavorable factors in a situation. A man in optimistic\nmood can ignore them. But no awkward situation is likely to be\nremedied while any of its elements are neglected.\n\nCalhoun dourly considered the situation of the people of the planet\nDara, which it was his job as a Med Service man to remedy or at least\nimprove. Those people were marked by patches of blue pigment as an\ninherited consequence of a plague of three generations past. Because\nof the marking, which it was easy to believe a sign of continuing\ninfection, they were hated and dreaded by their neighbors. Dara was a\nplanet of pariahs--excluded from the human race by those who feared\nthem.\n\nAnd now there was famine on Dara for the second time, and they were of\nno mind to starve quietly. There was food on the planet Orede,\nmonstrous herds of cattle without owners. It was natural enough for\nDarians to build a ship or ships and try to bring food back to its\nstarving people. But that desperately necessary enterprise had now\nroused Weald to a frenzy of apprehension.\n\nWeald was, if possible, more hysterically afraid of blueskins than\never before, and even more implacably the enemy of the starving\nplanet's population. Weald itself prospered. Ironically, it had such\nan excess of foodstuffs that it stored them in unneeded spaceships in\norbits about itself.\n\nHundreds of thousands of tons of grain circled Weald in sealed-tight\nhulks, while the people of Dara starved and only dared try to\nsteal--if it could be called stealing--some of the innumerable wild\ncattle of Orede.\n\nThe blueskins on Orede could not trust Calhoun, so they pretended not\nto hear. Or maybe that didn't hear. They'd been abandoned and betrayed\nby all of humanity off their world. They'd been threatened and\noppressed by guardships in orbit about them, ready to shoot down any\nspacecraft they might send aloft....\n\nSo Calhoun brooded, while Murgatroyd presently yawned and climbed to\nhis cubbyhole and curled up to sleep with his furry tail carefully\nadjusted over his nose.\n\nA long time later Calhoun heard small sounds which were not normal on\na Med Ship in overdrive. They were not part of the random noises\ncarefully generated to keep the silence of the ship endurable. Calhoun\nraised his head. He listened sharply. No sound could come from\noutside.\n\nHe knocked on the door of the sleeping cabin. The noises stopped\ninstantly.\n\n\"Come out,\" he commanded through the door.\n\n\"I'm--I'm all right,\" said Maril's voice. But it was not quite steady.\nShe paused. \"Did I make a noise? I was having a bad dream.\"\n\n\"I wish,\" said Calhoun, \"that you'd tell me the truth just\noccasionally! Come out, please!\"\n\nThere were stirrings. After a little it opened and Maril appeared. She\nlooked as if she'd been crying. She said, quickly, \"I probably look\nqueer, but it's because I was asleep.\"\n\n\"To the contrary,\" said Calhoun, fuming. \"You've been lying awake\ncrying. I don't know why. I've been out here wishing I could, because\nI'm frustrated. But since you aren't asleep maybe you can help me with\nmy job. I've figured some things out. For some others I need facts.\nWill you give them to me?\"\n\nShe swallowed. \"I'll try.\"\n\n\"Coffee?\" he asked.\n\nMurgatroyd popped his head out of his miniature sleeping cabin.\n\n\"_Chee?_\" he asked interestedly.\n\n\"Go back to sleep!\" snapped Calhoun.\n\nHe began to pace back and forth.\n\n\"I need to know something about the pigment patches,\" he said jerkily.\n\"Maybe it sounds crazy to think of such things now--first things\nfirst, you know. But this is a first thing! So long as Darians don't\nlook like the people of other worlds, they'll be believed to be\ndifferent. If they look repulsive, they'll be believed to be evil.\n\n\"Tell me about those patches. They're different sizes and different\nshapes and they appear in different places. You've none on your face\nor hands, anyhow.\"\n\n\"I haven't any at all,\" said the girl reservedly.\n\n\"I thought--\"\n\n\"Not everybody,\" she said defensively. \"Nearly, yes. But not all. Some\npeople don't have them. Some people are born with bluish splotches on\ntheir skin, but they fade out while they're children. When they grow\nup they're just like the people of Weald or any other world. And their\nchildren never have them.\"\n\nCalhoun stared.\n\n\"You couldn't possibly be proved to be a Darian, then?\"\n\nShe shook her head. Calhoun remembered, and started the coffee.\n\n\"When you left Dara,\" he said, \"you were carried a long, long way, to\nsome planet where they'd practically never heard of Dara, and where\nthe name meant nothing. You could have settled there, or anywhere else\nand forgotten about Dara. But you didn't. Why not, since you're not a\nblueskin?\"\n\n\"But I am!\" she said fiercely. \"My parents, my brothers and sisters,\nand Korvan--\"\n\nThen she bit her lip. Calhoun took note but did not comment on the\nname she'd mentioned.\n\n\"Then your parents had the splotches fade, so you never had them,\" he\nsaid absorbedly. \"Something like that happened on Tralee, once!\nThere's a virus, a whole group of virus particles! Normally we humans\nare immune to them. One has to be in terrifically bad physical\ncondition for them to take hold and produce whatever effects they do.\nBut once they're established they're passed on from mother to child.\nAnd when they die out it's during childhood, too!\"\n\nHe poured coffee for the two of them. Murgatroyd swung down to the\nfloor and said, impatiently, \"_Chee! Chee! Chee!_\"\n\nCalhoun absently filled Murgatroyd's tiny cup and handed it to him.\n\n\"But this is marvellous!\" he said exuberantly. \"The blue patches\nappeared after the plague, didn't they? After people recovered--when\nthey recovered?\"\n\nMaril stared at him. His mind was filled with strictly professional\nconsiderations. He was not talking to her as a person. She was purely\na source of information.\n\n\"So I'm told,\" said Maril reservedly. \"Are there any more humiliating\nquestions you want to ask?\"\n\nHe gaped at her. Then he said ruefully, \"I'm stupid, Maril, but you're\ntouchy. There's nothing personal--\"\n\n\"There is to me!\" she said fiercely. \"I was born among blueskins, and\nthey're of my blood, and they're hated and I'd have been killed on\nWeald if I'd been known as ... what I am! And there's Korvan, who\narranged for me to be sent away as a spy and advised me to do just\nwhat you said: abandon my home world and everybody I care about!\nIncluding him! It's personal to me!\"\n\nCalhoun wrinkled his forehead helplessly.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he repeated. \"Drink your coffee!\"\n\n\"I don't want it,\" she said bitterly. \"I'd like to die!\"\n\n\"If you stay around where I am,\" Calhoun told her, \"you may get your\nwish. All right, there'll be no more questions.\"\n\nShe turned and moved toward the door to the cabin. Calhoun looked\nafter her.\n\n\"Maril.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Why were you crying?\"\n\n\"You wouldn't understand,\" she said evenly.\n\nCalhoun shrugged his shoulders almost up to his ears. He was a\nprofessional man. In his profession he was not incompetent. But there\nis no profession in which a really competent man tries to understand\nwomen. Calhoun, annoyed, had to let fate or chance or disaster take\ncare of Maril's personal problems. He had larger matters to cope with.\n\nBut he had something to work on, now. He hunted busily in the\nreference tapes. He came up with an explicit collection of information\non exactly the subject he needed. He left the control room to go down\ninto the storage areas of the Med Ship's hull. He found an ultra\nfrigid storage box, whose contents were kept at the temperature of\nliquid air.\n\nHe donned thick gloves, used a special set of tongs, and extracted a\ntiny block of plastic in which a sealed-tight phial of glass was\nembedded. It frosted instantly he took it out, and when the storage\nbox was closed again the block was covered with a thick and opaque\ncoating of frozen moisture.\n\nHe went back to the control room and pulled down the panel which made\navailable a small-scale but surprisingly adequate biological\nlaboratory. He set the plastic block in a container which would raise\nit very, very gradually to a specific temperature and hold it there.\nIt was, obviously, a living culture from which any imaginable quantity\nof the same culture could be bred. Calhoun set the apparatus with\ngreat exactitude.\n\n\"This,\" he told Murgatroyd, \"may be a good day's work. Now I think I\ncan rest.\"\n\nThen, for a long while, there was no sound or movement in the Med\nShip. The girl may have slept, or maybe not. Calhoun lay relaxed in a\nchair which at the touch of a button became the most comfortable of\nsleeping places. Murgatroyd remained in his cubbyhole, his tail curled\nover his nose.\n\nThere were comforting, unheard, easily dismissable murmurings now and\nagain. They kept the feeling of life alive in the ship. But for such\ninfinitesimal stirrings of sound, carefully recorded for this exact\npurpose, the feel of the ship would have been that of a tomb.\n\nBut it was quite otherwise when another ship-day began with the taped\nsounds of morning activities as faint as echoes but nevertheless\nestablishing an atmosphere of their own.\n\nCalhoun examined the plastic block and its contents. He read the\ninstruments which had cared for it while he slept. He put the\nblock--no longer frosted--in the culture microscope and saw its\nenclosed, infinitesimal particles of life in the process of\nmultiplying on the food that had been frozen with them when they were\nreduced to the spore condition. He beamed. He replaced the block in\nthe incubation oven and faced the day cheerfully.\n\nMaril greeted him with great reserve. They breakfasted, with\nMurgatroyd eating from his own platter on the floor, a tiny cup of\ncoffee alongside.\n\n\"I've been thinking,\" said Maril evenly. \"I think I can get you a\nhearing for whatever ideas you may have to help Dara.\"\n\n\"Kind of you,\" murmured Calhoun.\n\nIn theory, a Med Service man had all the authority needed for this or\nany other emergency. The power to declare a planet in quarantine, so\ncutting it off from all interstellar commerce, should be enough to\nforce cooperation from any world's government. But in practice Calhoun\nhad exactly as much power as he could exercise.\n\nAnd Weald could not think straight where blueskins were concerned, and\ncertainly the authorities on Dara could not be expected to be\nlevelheaded. They had a history of isolation and outlawry, and long\nexperience of being regarded as less than human. In cold fact, Calhoun\nhad no power at all.\n\n\"May I ask whose influence you'll exert?\" asked Calhoun.\n\n\"There's a man,\" said Maril reservedly, \"who thinks a great deal of\nme. I don't know his present official position, but he was certain to\nbecome prominent. I'll tell him how you've acted up to now, and your\nattitude, and of course that you're Med Service. He'll be glad to help\nyou, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"Splendid!\" said Calhoun, nodding. \"That will be Korvan.\"\n\nShe started. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\"Intuition,\" said Calhoun dryly. \"All right. I'll count on him.\"\n\nBut he did not. He worked in the tiny biological lab all that ship-day\nand all the next. The girl was very quiet. Murgatroyd tried to enter\ninto pretended conversation with her, but she was not able to match\nhis pretense.\n\nOn the ship-day after, the time for breakout approached. While the\nship was practically a world all by itself, it was easy to look\nforward with confidence to the future. But when contact and, in a\nfashion, conflict with other and larger worlds loomed nearer,\nprospects seemed less bright. Calhoun had definite plans, now, but\nthere were so many ways in which they could be frustrated.\n\nCalhoun sat down at the control board and watched the clock.\n\n\"I've got things lined up,\" he told Maril, \"if only they work out. If\nI can make somebody on Dara listen, which is unlikely, and follow my\nadvice, which they probably won't; and if Weald doesn't get the ideas\nit probably will get; and isn't doing what I suspect it is--why,\nmaybe something can be done.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you'll do your best,\" said Maril politely.\n\nCalhoun managed to grin. He watched the clock. There was no sensation\nattached to overdrive travel except at the beginning and the end. It\nwas now time for the end. He might find most anything having happened.\nHis plans might immediately be seen to be hopeless. Weald could have\nsent ships to Dara, or Dara might be in such a state of\ndesperation....\n\nAs it turned out, Dara was desperate. The Med Ship came out nearly a\nlight-month from the sun about which the planet Dara revolved. Calhoun\nwent into a short hop toward it. Then Dara was on the other side of\nthe blazing yellow star. It took time to reach it.\n\nHe called down, identifying himself and the ship and asking for\ncoordinates so his ship could be brought to ground. There was\nconfusion, as if the request were so unusual that the answers were not\nready. The grid, too, was on the planet's night side. Presently the\nship was locked onto by the grid's force-fields. It went downward.\n\nCalhoun saw that Maril sat tensely, twisting her fingers within each\nother, until the ship actually touched ground.\n\nThen he opened the exit port--and faced armed men in the darkness,\nwith blast-rifles trained on him. There was a portable cannon trained\non the Med Ship itself.\n\n\"Come out!\" rasped a voice. \"If you try anything you get blasted! Your\nship and its contents are seized by the planetary government!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nIt seemed that the smell of hunger was in the air. The armed men were\nemaciated. Lights came on, and stark, harsh shadows lay black upon the\nground. Calhoun's captors were uniformed, but the uniforms hung\nloosely upon them. Where the lights struck upon their faces, their\ncheeks were hollow. They were cadaverous. And there were the splotches\nof pigment of which Calhoun had heard.\n\nThe man nearest the Med Ship's port had a monstrous, irregular\ndull-blue marking over half of one side of his face and up upon his\nforehead. The man next to him had a blue throat. The next man again\nwas less marked, but his left ear was blue and there was what seemed a\nsplashing of the same color on the skin under his hair.\n\nThe leader of the truculent group--it might have been a firing\nsquad--made an imperious gesture with his hand. It was blue, except\nfor two fingers which in the glaring illumination seemed whiter than\nwhite.\n\n\"Out!\" said that man savagely. \"We're taking over your stock of food.\nYou'll get your share of it, like everybody else, but--\"\n\nMaril spoke over Calhoun's shoulder. She uttered a cryptic sentence or\ntwo. It should have amounted to identification but there was\nskepticism in the armed party.\n\n\"Oh, you're one of us, eh?\" said the guard leader sardonically.\n\"You'll have a chance to prove that. Come out of there!\"\n\nCalhoun spoke abruptly, \"This is a Med Ship,\" he said. \"There are\nmedicines and bacterial culture inside it. They shouldn't be meddled\nwith. Here on Dara you've had enough of plagues!\"\n\nThe man with the blue hand said as sardonically as before, \"I said the\ngovernment was taking over your ship! It won't be looted. But you're\nnot taking a full cargo of food away! In fact, it's not likely you're\nleaving!\"\n\n\"And I want to speak to someone in authority,\" snapped Calhoun. \"We've\njust come from Weald.\" He felt bristling hatred all about him as he\nnamed Weald. \"There's tumult there. They're talking about dropping\nfusion-bombs here. It's important that I talk to somebody with the\nauthority to take a few sensible precautions!\"\n\nHe descended to the ground. There was a panicky \"_Chee! Chee!_\" from\nbehind him, and Murgatroyd came dashing to swarm up his body and cling\napprehensively to his neck.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"A _tormal_\" said Calhoun. \"He's not a pet. Your medical men will know\nsomething about him. This is a Med Ship and I'm a Med Ship man, and\nhe's an important member of the crew. He's a Med Ship _tormal_ and he\nstays with me!\"\n\nThe man with the blue hand said harshly, \"There's somebody waiting to\nask you questions. Here!\"\n\nA groundcar came rolling out from the side of the landing-grid\nenclosure. The groundcar ran on wheels, and wheels were not much used\non modern worlds. Dara was behind the times in more ways than one.\n\n\"This car will take you to Defense and you can tell them anything you\nwant. But don't try to sneak back in this ship! It'll be guarded!\"\n\nThe groundcar was enclosed, with room for a driver and the three from\nthe Med Ship. But armed men festooned themselves about its exterior\nand it went bumping and rolling to the massive ground-layer girders of\nthe grid. It rolled out under them and onto a paved highway. It picked\nup speed.\n\nThere were buildings on either side of the road, but few showed\nlights. This was night, and the men at the landing-grid had set a\npattern of hunger, so that the silence and the dark buildings did not\nseem a sign of tranquility and sleep, but of exhaustion and despair.\n\nThe highway lamps were few, by comparison with other inhabited worlds,\nand the groundcar needed lights of its own to guide its driver over a\npaved surface that needed repair. By those moving lights other\ndepressing things could be seen: untidiness, buildings not kept up to\nperfection, evidences of apathy, the road, which hadn't been cleaned\nlately, litter here and there.\n\nEven the fact that there were no stars added to the feeling of\nwretchedness and gloom and, ultimately, of hunger.\n\nMaril spoke nervously to the driver.\n\n\"The famine isn't any better?\"\n\nHe moved his head in negation, but did not speak. There was a splotch\nof blue pigment at the back of his neck. It extended upward into his\nhair.\n\n\"I left two years ago,\" said Maril. \"It was just beginning then.\nRationing hadn't started.\"\n\nThe driver said evenly, \"There's rationing now!\"\n\nThe car went on and on. A vast open space appeared ahead. Lights about\nits perimeter seemed few and pale.\n\n\"Everything seems worse. Even the lights.\"\n\n\"Using all the power,\" said the driver, \"to warm up ground to grow\ncrops where it ought to be winter. Not doing too well, either.\"\n\nCalhoun knew, somehow, that Maril moistened her lips.\n\n\"I was sent,\" she explained to the driver, \"to go ashore on Trent and\nthen make my way to Weald. I mailed reports of what I found out back\nto Trent. Somebody got them back to here whenever it was possible.\"\n\nThe driver said, \"Everybody knows the man on Trent disappeared. Maybe\nhe got caught, maybe somebody saw him without make-up. Or maybe he\njust quit being one of us. What's the difference? No use!\"\n\nCalhoun found himself wincing a little. The driver was not angry. He\nwas hopeless. But men should not despair. They shouldn't accept\nhostility from those about them as a device of fate for their\ndestruction.\n\nMaril said quickly to Calhoun, \"You understand? Dara's a heavy-metals\nplanet. There aren't many light elements in our soil. Potassium is\nscarce. So our ground isn't very fertile. Before the Plague we traded\nmetals and manufactured products for imports of food and potash. But\nsince the Plague we've had no off-planet commerce. We've been\nquarantined.\"\n\n\"I gathered as much,\" said Calhoun. \"It was up to Med Service to see\nthat that didn't happen. It's up to Med Service now to see that it\nstops.\"\n\n\"Too late now for anything,\" said the driver. \"Whatever Med Service\nmay be! They're talking about cutting down our population so there'll\nbe food enough for some to live. There are two questions about it. One\nis who's to be kept alive, and the other is why.\"\n\nThe groundcar aimed now for a cluster of faintly brighter lights on\nthe far side of the great open space. They enlarged as they grew\nnearer. Maril said hesitantly, \"There was someone, Korvan--\" Calhoun\ndidn't catch the rest of the name. Maril said hesitantly, \"He was\nworking on food plants. I thought he might accomplish something....\"\n\nThe driver said caustically, \"Sure! Everybody's heard about him! He\ncame up with a wonderful thing! He and his outfit worked out a way to\nprocess weeds so they can be eaten. And they can. You can fill your\nbelly and not feel hungry, but it's like eating hay. You starve just\nthe same. He's still working. Head of a government division.\"\n\nThe groundcar passed through a gate. It stopped before a lighted door.\nThe armed men hanging to its outside dropped off. They watched Calhoun\nclosely as he stepped out with Murgatroyd riding on his shoulder.\n\nMinutes later they faced a hastily summoned group of officials of the\nDarian government. For a ship to land on Dara was so remarkable an\nevent that it called practically for a cabinet meeting. And Calhoun\nnoted that they were no better fed than the guards at the spaceport.\n\nThey regarded Calhoun and Maril with oddly burning, eyes. It was, of\ncourse, because the two of them showed no signs of hunger. They\nobviously had not been on short rations. Darians had this, now, to\nincrease a hatred which was inevitable anyhow, directed at all peoples\noff their own planet.\n\n\"My name is Calhoun,\" said Calhoun briskly. \"I've the usual Med\nService credentials. Now--\"\n\nHe did not wait to be questioned. He told them of the appalling state\nof things in the Twelfth Sector of the Med Service, so that men had\nbeen borrowed from other sectors to remedy the intolerable, and he was\none of them. He told of his arrival at Weald and what had happened\nthere, from the excessively cautious insistence that he prove he was\nnot a Darian, to the arrival of the death-ship from Orede.\n\nHe was giving them the news affecting them, as they had not heard it\nbefore. He went on to tell of his stop at Orede and his purpose, and\nhis encounter with the men he found there. When he finished there was\nsilence. He broke it.\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"Maril's an agent of yours. She can add to what I've\ntold you. I'm Med Service. I have a job to do here to carry out what\nwasn't done before. I should make a planetary health inspection and\nmake recommendations for the improvement of the state of things. I'll\nbe glad if you'll arrange for me to talk to your health officials.\nThings look bad, and something should be done.\"\n\nSomeone laughed without mirth.\n\n\"What will you recommend for long-continued undernourishment?\" he\nasked derisively. \"That's our health problem!\"\n\n\"I recommend food,\" said Calhoun.\n\n\"Where'll you fill the prescription?\"\n\n\"I've the answer to that, too,\" said Calhoun curtly. \"I'll want to\ntalk to any space pilots you've got. Get your astrogators together and\nI think they'll approve my idea.\"\n\nThe silence was totally skeptical.\n\n\"Orede--\"\n\n\"Not Orede,\" said Calhoun. \"Weald will be hunting that planet over for\nDarians. If they find any, they'll drop bombs here.\"\n\n\"Our only space pilots,\" said a tall man, presently, \"are on Orede\nnow. If you've told the truth, they'll probably head back because of\nyour warning. They should bring meat.\"\n\nHis mouth worked peculiarly, and Calhoun knew that it was at the\nthought of food.\n\n\"Which,\" said another man sharply, \"goes to the hospitals! I haven't\ntasted meat in two years!\"\n\n\"Nobody has,\" growled another man still. \"But here's this man Calhoun.\nI'm not convinced he can work magic, but we can find out if he lies.\nPut a guard on his ship. Otherwise let our health men give him his\nhead. They'll find out if he's from this Medical Service he tells of!\nand this Maril....\"\n\n\"I can be identified,\" said Maril. \"I was sent to gather information\nand send it in secret writing to one of us on Trent. I have a family\nhere. They'll know me! And I--there was someone who was working on\nfoods, and I believe he made it possible to use ... all sorts of\nvegetation for food. He will identify me.\"\n\nSomeone laughed harshly.\n\nMaril swallowed.\n\n\"I'd like to see him,\" she repeated. \"And my family.\"\n\nSome of the blue-splotched men turned away. A broad-shouldered man\nsaid bluntly, \"Don't look for them to be glad to see you. And you'd\nbetter not show yourself in public. You've been well fed. You'll be\nhated for that.\"\n\nMaril began to cry. Murgatroyd said bewilderedly, \"_Chee! Chee!_\"\n\nCalhoun held him close. There was confusion. And Calhoun found the\nMinister of Health at hand. He looked most harried of all the\nofficials gathered to question Calhoun. He proposed that he get a look\nat the hospital situation right away.\n\nIt wasn't practical. With all the population on half rations or less,\nwhen night came people needed to sleep. Most people, indeed, slept as\nmany hours out of the traditional twenty-four as they could manage. It\nwas much more pleasant to sleep than to be awake and constantly nagged\nat by continued hunger.\n\nAnd there was the matter of simple decency. Continuous gnawing hunger\nhad an embittering effect upon everyone. Quarrelsomeness was a common\nexperience. And people who would normally be the leaders of opinion\nfelt shame because they were obsessed by thoughts of food. It was best\nwhen people slept.\n\nStill, Calhoun was in the hospitals by daybreak. What he found moved\nhim to savage anger. There were too many sick children. In every case\nundernourishment contributed to their sickness. And there was not\nenough food to make them well. Doctors and nurses denied themselves\nfood to spare it for their patients. And most of that self-denial was\ndoubtless voluntary, but it would not be discreet for anybody on Dara\nto look conspicuously better fed than his fellows.\n\nCalhoun brought out hormones and enzymes and medicaments from the Med\nShip while the guard in the ship looked on. He demonstrated the\nprocesses of synthesis and auto-catalysis that enabled such small\nsamples to be multiplied indefinitely. He was annoyed by a clamorous\nappetite. There were some doctors who ignored the irony of medical\ntechniques being taught to cure nonnutritional disease, when everybody\nwas half-fed, or less. They approved of Calhoun. They even approved of\nMurgatroyd when Calhoun explained his function.\n\nHe was, of course, a Med Service _tormal_, and _tormals_ were\ncreatures of talent. They'd originally been found on a planet in the\nDeneb area, and they were engaging and friendly small animals. But the\nremarkable fact about them was that they couldn't contract any\ndisease. Not any.\n\nThey had a built-in, explosive reaction to bacterial and viral toxins,\nand there hadn't yet been any pathogenic organism discovered to which\na _tormal_ could not more or less immediately develop antibody\nresistance. So that in interstellar medicine _tormals_ were priceless.\n\nLet Murgatroyd be infected with however localized, however specialized\nan inimical organism, and presently some highly valuable defensive\nsubstance could be isolated from his blood and he'd remain in his\nusual exuberant good health.\n\nWhen the antibody was analyzed by those techniques of microanalysis\nthe Service had developed, that was that. The antibody could be\nsynthesized and one could attack any epidemic with confidence.\n\nThe tragedy for Dara was, of course, that no Med Ship had come to Dara\nthree generations ago, when the Dara plague raged. Worse, after the\nplague Weald was able to exert pressure which only a criminally\nincompetent Med Service director would have permitted. But criminal\nincompetence and its consequences was what Calhoun had been loaned to\nSector Twelve to help remedy. He was not at ease, though. No ship\narrived from Orede to bear out his account of an attempt to get that\nlonely world evacuated before Weald discovered it had blueskins on it.\nMaril had vanished, to visit or return to her family, or perhaps to\nconsult with the mysterious Korvan who'd arranged for her to leave\nDara to be a spy, and had advised her simply to make a new life\nsomewhere else, abandoning a famine-ridden, despised, and out-caste\nworld.\n\nCalhoun had learned of two achievements the same Korvan had made for\nhis world. Neither was remarkably constructive. He'd offered to prove\nthe value of the second by dying of it. Which might make him a very\nadmirable character, or he could have a passion for martyrdom, which\nis much more common than most people think. In two days Calhoun was\nirritable enough from unaccustomed hunger to suspect the worst of him.\n\nMeanwhile Calhoun worked doggedly; in the hospitals while the patients\nwere awake and in the Med Ship, under guard, afterward. He had hunger\ncramps now, but he tested a plastic cube with a thriving biological\nculture in it.\n\nHe worked at increasing his store of it. He'd snipped samples of\npigmented skin from dead patients in the hospitals, and examined the\npigmented areas, and very, very painstakingly verified a theory. It\ntook an electron microscope to do it, but he found a virus in the blue\npatches which matched the type discovered on Tralee.\n\nThe Tralee viruses had effects which were passed on from mother to\nchild, and heredity had been charged with the observed results of\nquasi-living viral particles. And then Calhoun very, very carefully\nintroduced into a virus culture the material he had been growing in a\nplastic cube. He watched what happened.\n\nHe was satisfied, so much so that immediately afterward he yawned and\nyawned and barely managed to stagger off to bed. The watching guard in\nthe Med Ship watched him in amazement.\n\nThat night the ship from Orede came in, packed with frozen bloody\ncarcasses of cattle. Calhoun knew nothing of it. But next morning\nMaril came back. There were shadows under her eyes and her expression\nwas of someone who has lost everything that had meaning in her life.\n\n\"I'm all right,\" she insisted, when Calhoun commented. \"I've been\nvisiting my family. I've seen Korvan. I'm quite all right.\"\n\n\"You haven't eaten any better than I have,\" Calhoun observed.\n\n\"I couldn't!\" admitted Maril. \"My sisters, my little sisters so\nthin.... There's rationing for everybody and it's all efficiently\narranged. They even had rations for me. But I couldn't eat! I gave\nmost of my food to my sisters and they--they squabbled over it!\"\n\nCalhoun said nothing. There was nothing to say. Then she said, in a no\nless desolate tone, \"Korvan said I was foolish to come back.\"\n\n\"He could be right,\" said Calhoun.\n\n\"But I had to!\" protested Maril. \"And now I--I've been eating all I\nwanted to, in Weald and in the ship, and I'm ashamed because they're\nhalf-starved and I'm not. And when you see what hunger does to\nthem.... It's terrible to be half-starved and not able to think of\nanything but food!\"\n\n\"I hope,\" said Calhoun, \"to do something about that. If I can get hold\nof an astrogator or two--\"\n\n\"The ship that was on Orede came in during the night,\" Maril told him\nshakily. \"It was loaded with frozen meat, but one load's not enough to\nmake a difference on a whole planet! And if Weald hunts for us on\nOrede, we daren't go back for more meat.\"\n\nShe said abruptly, \"There are some prisoners. They were miners. They\nwere crowded out of the ship. The Darians who'd stampeded the cattle\ntook them prisoners. They had to!\"\n\n\"True,\" said Calhoun. \"It wouldn't have been wise to leave Wealdians\naround on Orede with their throats cut. Or living, either, to tell\nabout a rumor of blueskins. Even if their throats will be cut now. Is\nthat the program?\"\n\nMaril shivered.\n\n\"No. They'll be put on short rations like everybody else. And people\nwill watch them. The Wealdians expect to die of plague any minute\nbecause they've been with Darians. So people look at them and laugh.\nBut it's not very funny.\"\n\n\"It's natural,\" said Calhoun, \"but perhaps lacking in charity. Look\nthere! How about those astrogators? I need them for a job I have in\nmind.\"\n\nMaril wrung her hands.\n\n\"C--come here,\" she said in a low tone.\n\nThere was an armed guard in the control room of the ship. He'd watched\nCalhoun a good part of the previous day as Calhoun performed his\nmysterious work. He'd been off-duty and now was on duty again. He was\nbored. So long as Calhoun did not touch the control board, though, he\nwas uninterested. He didn't even turn his head when Maril led the way\ninto the other cabin and slid the door shut.\n\n\"The astrogators are coming,\" she said swiftly. \"They'll bring some\nboxes with them. They'll ask you to instruct them so they can handle\nour ship better. They lost themselves coming back from Orede. No,\nthey didn't lose themselves, but they lost time, enough time almost to\nmake an extra trip for meat. They need to be experts. I'm to come\nalong, so they can be sure that what you teach them is what you've\nbeen doing right along.\"\n\nCalhoun said, \"Well?\"\n\n\"They're crazy!\" said Maril vehemently. \"They knew Weald would do\nsomething monstrous sooner or later. But they're going to try to stop\nit by being more monstrous sooner! Not everybody agrees, but there are\nenough. So they want to use your ship--it's faster in overdrive and so\non. And they'll go to Weald in this ship and--they say they'll give\nWeald something to keep it busy without bothering us!\"\n\nCalhoun said dryly, \"This pays me off for being too sympathetic with\nblueskins! But if I'd been hungry for a couple of years, and was\ndespised to boot by the people who kept me hungry, I suppose I might\nreact the same way. No,\" he said curtly as she opened her lips to\nspeak again, \"don't tell me the trick. Considering everything, there's\nonly one trick it could be. But I doubt profoundly that it would work.\nAll right.\"\n\nHe slid the door back and returned to the control room. Maril followed\nhim. He said detachedly, \"I've been working on a problem outside of\nthe food one. It isn't the time to talk about it right now, but I\nthink I've solved it.\"\n\nMaril turned her head, listening. There were footsteps on the tarmac\noutside the ship. Both doors of the airlock were open. Four men came\nin. They were young men who did not look quite as hungry as most\nDarians, but there was a reason for that. Their leader introduced\nhimself and the others. They were the astrogators of the ship Dara had\nbuilt to try to bring food from Orede. They were not, said their\nself-appointed leader, good enough. They'd overshot their\ndestination. They came out of overdrive too far off line. They needed\ninstruction.\n\nCalhoun nodded, and observed that he'd been asking for them. They\nwere, of course, blueskins. On one the only visible disfigurement was\na patch of blue upon his wrist. On another the appearance of a blue\nbirthmark appeared beside his eye and went back and up his temple. A\nthird had a white patch on his temple, with all the rest of his face a\ndull blue. The fourth had blue fingers on one hand.\n\n\"We've got orders,\" said their leader, steadily, \"to come on board and\nlearn from you how to handle this ship. It's better than the one we've\ngot.\"\n\n\"I asked for you,\" repeated Calhoun. \"I've an idea I'll explain as we\ngo along.... Those boxes?\"\n\nSomeone was passing in iron boxes through the airlock. One of the four\nvery carefully brought them inside.\n\n\"They're rations,\" said a second young man. \"We don't go anywhere\nwithout rations, except Orede.\"\n\n\"Orede, yes. I think we were shooting at each other there,\" said\nCalhoun pleasantly. \"Weren't we?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the young man.\n\nHe was neither cordial nor antagonistic. He was impassive. Calhoun\nshrugged.\n\n\"Then we can take off immediately. Here's the communicator and there's\nthe button. You might call the grid and arrange for us to be lifted.\"\n\nThe young man seated himself at the control board. Very\nprofessionally, he went through the routine of preparing to lift by\nlanding-grid, which routine has not changed in two hundred years. He\nwent briskly ahead until the order to lift. Then Calhoun stopped him.\n\n\"Hold it!\"\n\nHe pointed to the airlock. Both doors were open. The young man at the\ncontrol board flushed vividly. One of the others closed and dogged the\ndoors.\n\nThe ship lifted. Calhoun watched with seeming negligence. But he found\noccasion for a dozen corrections of procedure. This was presumably a\ntraining voyage of his own suggestion. Therefore, when the blueskin\npilot would have flung the Med Ship into undirected overdrive, Calhoun\ngrew stern. He insisted on a destination. He suggested Weald.\n\nThe young men glanced at each other and accepted the suggestion. He\nmade the acting pilot look up the intrinsic brightness of its sun and\nmeasure its apparent brightness from just off Dara. He made him\nestimate the change in brightness to be expected after so many hours\nin overdrive, if one broke out to measure.\n\nThe first blueskin student pilot ended a Calhoun-determined tour of\nduty with more respect for Calhoun then he'd had at the beginning. The\nsecond was anxious to show up better than the first. Calhoun drilled\nhim in the use of brightness-charts, by which the changes in apparent\nbrightness of stars between overdrive hops could be correlated with\nangular changes to give a three-dimensional picture of the nearer\nheavens.\n\nIt was a highly necessary art which had not been worked out on Dara,\nand the prospective astrogators became absorbed in this and other fine\npoints of space-piloting. They'd done enough, in a few trips to Orede,\nto realize that they needed to know more. Calhoun showed them.\n\nCalhoun did not try to make things easy for them. He was hungry and\neasily annoyed. It was sound training tactics to be severe, and to\nphrase all suggestions as commands. He put the four young men in\ncommand of the ship in turn, under his direction. He continued to use\nWeald as a destination, but he set up problems in which the Med Ship\ncame out of overdrive pointing in an unknown direction and with a\nprecessory motion.\n\nHe made the third of his students identify Weald in the celestial\nglobe containing hundreds of millions of stars, and get on course in\noverdrive toward it. The fourth was suddenly required to compute the\ndistance to Weald from such data as he could get from observation,\nwithout reference to any records.\n\nBy this time the first man was chafing to take a second turn. Calhoun\ngave each of them a second gruelling lesson. He gave them, in fact, a\nhighly condensed but very sound course in the art of travel in space.\nHis young students took command in four-hour watches, with at least\none breakout from overdrive in each watch.\n\nHe built up enthusiasm in them. They ignored the discomfort of being\nhungry--though there had been no reason for them to stint on food on\nOrede--in growing pride in what they came to know.\n\nWhen Weald was a first-magnitude star, the four were not highly\nqualified astrogators, to be sure, but they were vastly better\nspacemen than at the beginning. Inevitably, their attitude toward\nCalhoun was respectful. He'd been irritable and right. To the young,\nthe combination is impressive.\n\nMaril had served as passenger only. In theory she was to compare\nCalhoun's lessons with his practise when alone. But he did nothing on\nthis journey which, teaching considered, was different from the two\ninterstellar journeys Maril had made with him.\n\nShe occupied the sleeping cabin during two of the six watches of each\nship-day. She operated the food-readier, which was almost completely\nemptied of its original store of food, it having been confiscated by\nthe government of Dara. That amount of food would make no difference\nto the planet, but it was wise for everyone on Dara to be equally\nill-fed.\n\nOn the sixth day out from Dara, the sun of Weald had a magnitude of\nminus five-tenths. The electron telescope could detect its larger\nplanets, especially a gas-giant fifth-orbit world of high albedo.\nCalhoun had his four students estimate its distance again, pointing\nout the difference that could be made in breakout position if the Med\nShip were mis-aimed by as much as one second of arc.\n\n\"And now,\" he said briskly, \"we'll have coffee. I'm going to graduate\nyou as pilots. Maril, four cups of coffee, please.\"\n\nMurgatroyd said \"_Chee?_\" The Med Ship was badly crowded with six\nhumans and Murgatroyd in a space intended for Calhoun and Murgatroyd\nalone. The little _tormal_ had spent most of his time in his\ncubbyhole, watching with beady eyes as so many people moved about on\nwhat had been a spacious ship before.\n\n\"No coffee for you, Murgatroyd,\" said Calhoun. \"You didn't do your\nlessons. This is for the graduating class only.\"\n\nMurgatroyd came out of his miniature den. He found his little cup and\noffered it insistently, saying, \"_Chee! Chee! Chee!_\"\n\n\"No!\" said Calhoun firmly. He regarded his class of four young men\nwith their blueskin markings. \"Drink it down!\" he commanded. \"That's\nthe last order I'll give you. You're graduate pilots, now!\"\n\nThey drank the coffee with a flourish. There was not one who did not\nadmire Calhoun for having made them admire themselves. They were,\nactually, almost as much better pilots as they believed.\n\n\"And now,\" said Calhoun, \"I suppose you'll tell me the truth about\nthose boxes you brought on board. You said they were rations, but\nthey haven't been opened in six days. I have an idea what they mean,\nbut you tell me.\"\n\nThe four looked uncomfortable. There was a long pause.\n\n\"They could be,\" said Calhoun detachedly, \"cultures to be dumped on\nWeald. Weald is making plans to wipe out Dara. So some fool has\ndecided to get Weald too busy fighting a plague of its own to bother\nwith you. Is that right?\"\n\nThe young men stirred unhappily. Young men can very easily be made\ninto fanatics. But they have to be kept stirred up. They can't be\nprovided with sound reason for self-respect. On the Med Ship there'd\nnot been a single reference to Weald except as an object toward which\nthe Med Ship was being astrogated. There'd been no reference to\nblueskins or enemies or threats or anything but space-piloting. The\nfour young men were now fanatical about the proper handling of a ship\nin emptiness.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said one of them, unhappily, \"that's what we were ordered\nto do.\"\n\n\"I object,\" said Calhoun. \"It wouldn't work. I just left Weald a\nlittle while back, remember. They've been telling themselves that some\nday Dara would try that. They've made preparations to fight any\nimaginable contagion you could drop on them. Every so often somebody\nclaims it's happening. It wouldn't work. I object!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"In fact,\" said Calhoun, \"I forbid it. I shall prevent it. You shan't\ndo anything of the kind.\"\n\nOne of the young men, staring at Calhoun, nodded suddenly. His eyes\nclosed. He jerked his head erect and looked bewildered. A second sank\nheavily into a chair. He said remotely, \"Thish sfunny!\" and abruptly\nwent to sleep. The third found his knees giving way. He paid elaborate\nattention to them, stiffening them. But they yielded like rubber and\nhe went slowly down to the floor. The fourth said thickly and\nreproachfully, \"Thought y'were our frien'!\"\n\nHe collapsed.\n\nCalhoun very soberly tied them hand and foot and laid them out\ncomfortably on the floor. Maril watched, white-faced, her hand to her\nthroat. Murgatroyd looked agitated. He said anxiously, \"_Chee? Chee?_\"\n\n\"No,\" said Calhoun. \"They'll wake up presently.\"\n\nMaril said in a tense and desperate whisper, \"You're betraying us!\nYou're going to take us to Weald!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Calhoun. \"We'll only orbit around it. First, though, I want\nto get rid of those damned packed-up cultures. They're dead, by the\nway. I killed them with super-sonics a couple of days ago, while a\nfine argument was going on about distance-measurements by variable\nCepheids of known period.\"\n\nHe put the four boxes carefully in the disposal unit. He operated it.\nThe boxes and their contents streamed out to space in the form of\nmetallic and other vapors. Calhoun sat at the control desk.\n\n\"I'm a Med Service man,\" he said detachedly. \"I couldn't cooperate in\nthe spread of plagues, anyhow, though a useful epidemic might be\nanother matter. But the important thing right now is not keeping Weald\nbusy with troubles to increase their hatred of Dara. It's getting some\nfood for Dara. And driblets won't help. What's needed is thousands of\ntons, or tens of thousands.\" Then he said, \"Overdrive coming,\nMurgatroyd! Hold fast!\"\n\nThe universe vanished. The customary unpleasant sensations accompanied\nthe change. Murgatroyd burped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nA large part of the firmament was blotted out by the blindingly bright\nhalf-disk of Weald, as it shone in the sunshine. It had icecaps at its\npoles, and there were seas, and the mottled look of land which had\nthat carefully maintained balance of woodland and cultivated areas\nwhich was so effective in climate control. The Med Ship floated free,\nand Calhoun fretfully monitored all the beacon frequencies known to\nman.\n\nThere was relative silence inside the ship. Maril watched Calhoun in a\nsort of despairing indecision. The four young blueskins still slept,\nstill bound hand and foot upon the control room floor. Murgatroyd\nregarded them, and Maril, and Calhoun in turn, and his small and furry\nforehead wrinkled helplessly.\n\n\"They can't have landed what I'm looking for!\" protested Calhoun as\nhis search had no result. \"They can't! It would be too sensible for\nthem to have done it!\"\n\nMurgatroyd said \"_Chee!_\" in a subdued voice.\n\n\"But where the devil did they put them?\" demanded Calhoun. \"A polar\norbit would be ridiculous! They--\" Then he grunted in disgust. \"Oh! Of\ncourse! Now, where's the landing-grid?\"\n\nHe worked busily for minutes, checking the position of the Wealdian\nlanding-grid, which was mapped in the Sector Directory, against the\nlook of continents and seas on the half-disk so plainly visible\noutside. He found what he wanted. He put on the ship's solar system\ndrive.\n\n\"I wish,\" he complained to Maril, \"I wish I could think straight the\nfirst time! And it's so obvious! If you want to put something out in\nspace, and not have it interfere with traffic, in what sort of orbit\nand at what distance will you put it?\"\n\nMaril did not answer.\n\n\"Obviously,\" said Calhoun, \"you'll put it as far as possible from the\nlanding-pattern of ships coming in to the spaceport. You'll put it on\nthe opposite side of the planet. And you'll want it to stay out of the\nway, where anybody can know it is at any time of the day or night\nwithout having to calculate anything.\n\n\"So you'll put it out in orbit so it will revolve around Weald in\nexactly one day, neither more nor less, and you'll put it above the\nequator. And then it will remain quite stationary above one spot on\nthe planet, a hundred and eighty degrees longitude away from the\nlanding-grid and directly over the equator.\"\n\nHe scribbled for a moment.\n\n\"Which means forty-two thousand miles high, give or take a few\nhundred, and--here! And I was hunting for it in a close-in orbit!\"\n\nHe grumbled to himself. He waited while the solar-system drive pushed\nthe Med Ship a quarter of the way around the bright planet below. The\nsunset line vanished and the planet's disk became a complete circle.\nThen Calhoun listened to the monitor earphones again, and grunted once\nmore, and changed course, and presently made a noise indicating\nsatisfaction.\n\nHe abandoned instrument control and peered directly out of a port,\nhandling the solar system drive with great care. Murgatroyd said\ndepressedly, \"_Chee!_\"\n\n\"Stop worrying,\" commanded Calhoun. \"We haven't been challenged, and\nthere is a beacon transmitter at work, just to make sure that nobody\nbumps into what we're looking for. It's a great help, because we do\nwant to bump, but gently.\"\n\nStars swung across the port out of which he looked. Something dark\nappeared, and then straight lines and exact curvings. Even Maril,\ndespairing and bewildered as she was, caught sight of something vastly\nlarger than the Med Ship, floating in space. She stared. The Med Ship\nmaneuvered very cautiously. She saw another large object. A third. A\nfourth. There seemed to be dozens of them.\n\nThey were spaceships, huge by comparison with _Aesclipus Twenty_. They\nfloated as the Med Ship did. They did not drive. They were not in\nformation. They were not at even distances from each other. They did\nnot point in the same direction. They swung in emptiness like\nderelicts.\n\nCalhoun jockeyed his small ship with infinite care. Presently there\ncame the gentlest of impacts and then a clanking sound. The appearance\nout the vision port became stationary, but still unbelievable. The Med\nShip was grappled magnetically to a vast surface of welded metal.\n\nCalhoun relaxed. He opened a wall panel and brought out a vacuum suit.\nHe began briskly to get it on.\n\n\"Things moving smoothly,\" he commented. \"We weren't challenged. So\nit's extremely unlikely that we were spotted. Our friends on the floor\nought to begin to come to shortly. And I'm going to find out now\nwhether I'm a hero or in sure-enough trouble!\"\n\nMaril said drearily, \"I don't know what you've done, except--\"\n\nCalhoun blinked at her, in the act of hauling the vacuum suit up his\nchest and over his shoulders.\n\n\"Isn't it self-evident?\" he demanded. \"I've been giving astrogation\nlessons to these characters. I certainly didn't do it to help them\ndump germ-cultures on Weald! I brought them here! Don't you see the\npoint? These are space ships. They're in orbit around Weald. They're\nnot manned and they're not controlled. In fact, they're nothing but\nsky-riding storage bins!\"\n\nHe seemed to consider the explanation complete. He wriggled his arms\ninto the sleeves and gloves of the suit. He slung the air tanks over\nhis shoulder and hooked them to the suit.\n\n\"I'll be back,\" he said. \"I hope with good news. I've reason to be\nhopeful, though, because these Wealdians are very practical men. They\nhave things all prepared and tidy. I suspect I'll find these ships\nwith stores of air and fuel, maybe even food, so that if Weald should\nmanage to make a deal for the stuff stored out here in them, they'd\nonly have to bring out crews.\"\n\nHe lifted the space helmet down from its rack and put it on. He tested\nit, reading the tank air-pressure, power-storage, and other data from\nthe lighted miniature instruments visible through pinholes above his\neye-level. He fastened a space rope about himself, speaking through\nthe helmet's opened faceplate.\n\n\"If our friends should wake up before I get back,\" he added, \"please\nrestrain them. I'd hate to be marooned.\"\n\nHe went waddling into the airlock with the coil of space rope over one\nvacuum-suited arm. The inner lock door closed behind him. A little\nlater Maril heard the outer lock open. Then silence.\n\nMurgatroyd whimpered a little. Maril shivered. Calhoun had gone out of\nthe ship to nothingness. He'd said that what he was looking for, and\nwhat he'd found, was forty-two thousand miles from Weald. One could\nimagine falling forty-two thousand miles, where one couldn't imagine\nfalling a light-year.\n\nCalhoun was walking on the steel plates of a gigantic spaceship which\nfloated among dozens of its fellows, all seeming derelicts and\nseemingly abandoned. He was able to walk on the nearest because of\nmagnetic-soled shoes. He trusted his life to them and to a flimsy\nspace rope which trailed after him out the Med Ship's airlock.\n\nTime passed. A clock ticked in that hurried tempo of five ticks to the\nsecond which has been the habit of clocks since time immemorial. Very\nsmall and trivial noises came from the background tape, preventing\nutter silence from hanging intolerably in the ship.\n\nMaril found herself listening tensely for something else. One of the\nfour bound blueskins snored, and stirred, and slept again. Murgatroyd\ngazed about unhappily, and swung down to the control room floor, and\nthen paused for lack of any place to go or anything to do. He sat down\nand began half-heartedly to lick his whiskers. Maril stirred.\n\nMurgatroyd looked at her hopefully.\n\n\"_Chee?_\" he asked shrilly.\n\nShe shook her head. It became a habit to act as if Murgatroyd were a\nhuman being. \"No,\" she said unsteadily. \"Not yet.\"\n\nMore time passed. An unbearably long time. Then there was the faintest\nof clankings. It repeated. Then, abruptly, there were noises in the\nairlock. They continued. They were fumbling noises.\n\nThe outer airlock door closed. The inner door opened. Dense white fog\ncame out of it. There was motion. Calhoun followed the fog out of the\nlock. He carried objects which had been weightless, but were suddenly\nheavy in the ship's gravity-field. There were two spacesuits and a\ncurious assortment of parcels. He spread them out, flipped aside his\nfaceplate, and said briskly, \"This stuff is cold! Turn a heater on it,\nwill you, Maril?\"\n\nHe began to work his way out of his own vacuum-suit.\n\n\"Item,\" he said. \"The ships are fuelled _and_ provisioned. A practical\ntribe, the Wealdians! The ships are ready to take off as soon as\nthey're warmed up inside. A half-degree sun doesn't radiate heat\nenough to keep a ship warm, when the rest of the cosmos is effectively\nnear zero Kelvin. Here, point the heaters like this.\"\n\nHe adjusted the radiant-heat dispensers. The fog disappeared where\ntheir beams played. But the metal spacesuits glistened and steamed,\nand the steam disappeared within inches. They were so completely and\nutterly cold that they condensed the air about them as a liquid, which\nre-evaporated to make fog, which warmed up and disappeared and was\nimmediately replaced.\n\n\"Item,\" said Calhoun again, getting his arms out of the vacuum-suit\nsleeves. \"The controls are pretty nearly standard. Our sleeping\nfriends will be able to astrogate them back to Dara without trouble,\nprovided only that nobody comes out here to bother us before they\nleave.\"\n\nHe shed the last of the spacesuit, stepping out of its legs.\n\n\"And,\" he finished wryly, \"I brought back an emergency supply of ship\nprovisions for everybody concerned, but find that I'm idiot enough to\nfeel that they'll choke me if I eat them while Dara's still starving.\"\n\nMaril said, \"But there isn't any hope for Dara! No real hope!\"\n\nHe gaped at her.\n\n\"What do you think we're here for?\"\n\nHe set to work to restore his four recent students to consciousness.\nIt was not a difficult task. The dosage mixed in the coffee given them\nas a graduation ceremony--the ceremony which had consisted solely of\ndrinking coffee and passing out--allowed for waking-up processes.\nCalhoun took the precaution of disarming them first, but presently\nfour hot-eyed young men glared at him.\n\n\"I'm calling,\" said Calhoun, holding a blaster negligently in his\nhand, \"I'm calling for volunteers. There's a famine on Dara. There've\nbeen unmanageable crop surpluses on Weald. On Dara, the government\ngrimly rations every ounce of food. On Weald, the government has been\nbuying surplus grain to keep the price up.\n\n\"To save storage costs, it's loaded the grain into out-of-date\nspaceships it once used to stand sentry over Dara to keep it out of\nspace when there was another famine there. Those ships have been put\nout in orbit, where we're hooked on to one of them.\n\n\"It's loaded with half a million bushels of grain. I've brought\nspacesuits from it, I've turned on the heaters in its interior, and\nI've set its overdrive unit for a hop to Dara. Now I'm calling for\nvolunteers to take half a million bushels of grain to where it's\nneeded. Do I get any volunteers?\"\n\nHe got four. Not immediately, because they were ashamed that he'd made\nit impossible to carry out their original fanatic plan, and now\noffered something much better to make up for it. They raged. But half\na million bushels of grain meant that people who must otherwise die\nmight live.\n\nUltimately, truculently, first one and then another angrily agreed.\n\n\"Good!\" said Calhoun. \"Now, how many of you dare risk the trip alone?\nI've got one grain ship warming up. There are plenty of others around\nus. Every one of you can take a ship and half a million bushels to\nDara, if you have the nerve!\"\n\nThe atmosphere changed. Suddenly they clamored for the task he offered\nthem. They were still acutely uncomfortable. He'd bossed them and\ntaught them until they felt capable and glamorous and proud. Then he'd\npinned their ears back. But if they returned to Dara with four enemy\nships and unimaginable quantities of food with which to break the\nfamine....\n\nThere was work to be done first, of course. Only one ship was so far\nwarming up. Three more had to be entered, in spacesuits, and each had\nto have its interior warmed so breathable air could exist inside it,\nand at least part of the stored provisions had to be brought up to\nreasonable temperature for use on the journey.\n\nThen the overdrive unit had to be inspected and set for the length of\njourney that a direct overdrive hop to Dara would mean, and Calhoun\nhad to make sure again that each of the four could identify Dara's sun\nunder all circumstances and aim for it with the requisite high\nprecision, both before going into overdrive and after breakout. When\nall that was accomplished, Calhoun might reasonably hope that they'd\narrive. But it wasn't a certainty.\n\nStill, presently his four students shook hands with him, with the fine\ntolerance of young men intending much greater achievements than their\nteacher. They wouldn't speak on communicator again, because their\nmessages might be picked up on Weald.\n\nOf course, for this high heroic action to be successful, it had to be\nperformed with the stealth of sneak-thieves.\n\nWhat seemed a long time passed. The one ship turned slowly upon some\nunseen axis. It wavered back and forth, seeking a point of aim. A\nsecond twisted in its place. A third put on the barest trace of solar\nsystem drive to get clear of the rest. The fourth--\n\nOne ship vanished. It had gone into overdrive, heading for Dara at\nmany times the speed of light. Another. Two more.\n\nThat was all. The remainder of the fleet hung clumsily in emptiness.\nAnd Calhoun worriedly went over in his mind the lessons he'd given in\nsuch a pathetically small number of days. If the four ships reached\nDara, their pilots would be heroes. Calhoun had presented them with\nthat estate over their bitter objection. But they would glory in\nit--if they reached Dara.\n\nMaril looked at him with very strange eyes.\n\n\"Now what?\" she asked.\n\n\"We hang around,\" said Calhoun, \"to see if anybody comes up from Weald\nto find out what's happened. It's always possible to pick up a sort of\nsignal when a ship goes into overdrive. Usually it doesn't mean a\nthing. Nobody pays any attention. But if somebody comes out here....\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It'll be regrettable,\" said Calhoun. He was suddenly very tired.\n\"It'll spoil any chance of our coming back and stealing some more\nfood, like interstellar mice. If they find out what we've done they'll\nexpect us to try it again. They might get set to fight. Or they might\nsimply land the rest of these ships.\"\n\n\"If I'd realized what you were about,\" said Maril, \"I'd have joined in\nthe lessons. I could have piloted a ship.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't have wanted to,\" said Calhoun. He yawned. \"You wouldn't\nwant to be a heroine. No normal girl does.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Korvan,\" said Calhoun. He yawned again. \"I've asked about him. He's\nbeen trying very desperately to deserve well of his fellow blueskins.\nAll he's accomplished is develop a way to starve painlessly. He\nwouldn't feel comfortable with a girl who'd helped make starving\nunnecessary. He'd admire you politely, but he'd never marry you. And\nyou know it.\"\n\nShe shook her head, but it was not easy to tell whether she denied the\nreaction of Korvan, whom Calhoun had never met, or denied that he was\nmore important to her than anything else. The last was what Calhoun\nplainly implied.\n\n\"You don't seem to be trying to be a hero!\" she protested.\n\n\"I'd enjoy it,\" admitted Calhoun, \"but I have a job to do. It's got to\nbe done. It's more important than being admired.\"\n\n\"You could take another ship back,\" she told him. \"It would be worth\nmore to Dara than the Med Ship is! And then everybody would realize\nthat you'd planned everything.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Calhoun, \"but you've no idea how much this ship matters to\nDara!\"\n\nHe seated himself at the controls. He slipped headphones over his\nears. He listened. Very, very carefully, he monitored all the wave\nlengths and wave forms he could discover in use on Weald. There was no\nmention of the oddity of behavior of shiploads of surplus grain aloft.\nThere was no mention of the ships at all. There was plenty of mention\nof Dara, and blueskins, and of the vicious political fight now going\non to see which political party could promise the most complete\nprotection against blueskins.\n\nAfter a full hour of it, Calhoun flipped off his receptor and swung\nthe Med Ship to an exact, painstakingly precise aim at the sun around\nwhich Dara rolled. He said, \"Overdrive coming, Murgatroyd!\"\n\nMurgatroyd grabbed. The stars went out and the universe reeled and the\nMed Ship became a sort of cosmos all its own, into which no signal\ncould come, no danger could enter, and in which there could be no\nsound except those minute ones made to prevent silence.\n\nCalhoun yawned again.\n\n\"Now there's nothing to be done for a day or two,\" he said wearily,\n\"and I'm beginning to understand why people sleep all they can, on\nDara. It's one way not to feel hungry. And one dreams such delicious\nmeals! But looking hungry is a social requirement, on Dara.\"\n\nMaril said tensely, \"You're going back? After they took the ship from\nyou?\"\n\n\"The job's not finished,\" he explained. \"Not even the famine's ended,\nand the famine's a second-order effect. If there were no such thing as\na blueskin, there'd be no famine. Food could be traded for. We've got\nto do something to make sure there are no more famines.\"\n\nShe looked at him oddly.\n\n\"It would be desirable,\" she said with irony. \"But you can't do it.\"\n\n\"Not today, no,\" he admitted. Then he said longingly, \"I didn't get\nmuch sleep on the way here, while running a seminar on astrogation. I\nthink I'll take a nap.\"\n\nShe rose and almost ostentatiously went into the other cabin, to leave\nhim alone. He shrugged. He settled down into the chair which, to let a\nMed Ship man break the monotony of life in unchanging surroundings,\nturned into a comfortable sleeping arrangement. He fell instantly\nasleep.\n\nFor very many ship-hours, then, there was no action or activity or\nhappening of any imaginable consequence in the Med Ship. Very, very\nfar away, light-years distant and light-years apart, four shiploads of\ngrain hurtled toward the famine-stricken planet of blueskins. Each\ngreat ship had a single semiskilled blueskin for pilot and crew.\n\nThousands of millions of suns blazed with violence appropriate to\ntheir stellar types in a galaxy of which a very small proportion had\nbeen explored and colonized by humanity. The human race was now to be\ncounted in quadrillions on scores of hundreds of inhabited worlds, but\nthe tiny Med Ship seemed the least significant of all possible created\nthings.\n\nIt could travel between star-systems and even star-clusters, but it\nwas not yet capable of crossing the continent of suns on which the\nhuman race arose. And between any two solar systems the journeying of\nthe Med Ship consumed much time. Which would be maddening for someone\nwith no work to do or no resources in himself, or herself.\n\nOn the second ship-day Calhoun labored painstakingly and somewhat\ndistastefully at the little biological laboratory. Maril watched him\nin a sort of brooding silence. Murgatroyd slept much of the time, with\nhis furry tail wrapped meticulously across his nose.\n\nToward the end of the day Calhoun finished his task. He had a matter\nof six or seven cubic centimeters of clear liquid as the conclusion of\na long process of culturing, and examination by microscope, and again\nculturing plus final filtration. He looked at a clock and calculated\ntime.\n\n\"Better wait until tomorrow,\" he observed, and put the bit of clear\nliquid in a temperature-controlled place of safekeeping.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Maril. \"What's it for?\"\n\n\"It's part of a job I have on hand,\" said Calhoun. He considered. \"How\nabout some music?\"\n\nShe looked astonished. But he set up an instrument and fed microtape\ninto it and settled back to listen. Then there was music such as she\nhad never heard before. It was another device to counteract isolation\nand monotonous between-planet voyages. To keep it from losing its\neffectiveness, Calhoun rationed himself on music, as on other things.\n\nAny indulgence frequently repeated would become a habit, in the sense\nthat it would give no special pleasure when indulged in, but would\nmake for stress if it were omitted. Calhoun deliberately went for\nweeks between uses of his recordings, so that music was an event to be\nlooked forward to and cherished.\n\nWhen he tapered off the stirring symphonies of Kun Gee with\ntranquilizing, soothing melodies from the Rim School of composers,\nMaril regarded him with a very peculiar gaze indeed.\n\n\"I think I understand now,\" she said slowly, \"why you don't act like\nother people. Toward me, for example. The way you live gives you what\nother people have to get in crazy ways--making their work feed their\nvanity, and justify pride, and make them feel significant. But you can\nput your whole mind on your work.\"\n\nHe thought it over.\n\n\"Med Ship routine is designed to keep one healthy in his mind,\" he\nadmitted. \"It works pretty well. It satisfies all my mental appetites.\nBut there are instincts....\"\n\nShe waited. He did not finish.\n\n\"What do you do about the instincts that work and music and such\nthings can't satisfy?\"\n\nCalhoun grinned wryly, \"I'm stern with them. I have to be.\"\n\nHe stood up and plainly expected her to go into the other cabin for\nthe night. She went.\n\nIt was after breakfast time of the next ship-day when he got out the\nsample of clear liquid he'd worked so long to produce.\n\n\"We'll see how it works,\" he observed. \"Murgatroyd's handy in case of\na slip-up. It's perfectly safe so long as he's aboard and there are\nonly the two of us.\"\n\nShe watched as he injected half a cc. under his own skin. Then she\nshivered a little.\n\n\"What will it do?\"\n\n\"That remains to be seen.\" He paused a moment. \"You and I,\" he said\nwith some dryness, \"make a perfect test for anything. If you catch\nsomething from me, it will be infectious indeed!\"\n\nShe gazed at him utterly without comprehension.\n\nHe took his own temperature. He brought out the folios which were his\norders, covering each of the planets he should give a standard Medical\nService inspection. Weald was there. Dara wasn't. But a Med Service\nman has much freedom of action, even when only keeping up the routine\nof normal Med Service. When catching up on badly neglected operations,\nhe necessarily has much more. Calhoun went over the folios.\n\nTwo hours later he took his temperature again. He looked pleased. He\nmade an entry in the ship's log. Two hours later yet he found himself\ndrinking thirstily and looked more pleased still.\n\nHe made another entry in the log and matter-of-factly drew a small\nquantity of blood from his own vein and called to Murgatroyd.\nMurgatroyd submitted amiably to the very trivial operation Calhoun\ncarried out. Calhoun put away the equipment and saw Maril staring at\nhim with a certain look of shock.\n\n\"It doesn't hurt him,\" Calhoun explained. \"Right after he's born\nthere's a tiny spot on his flank that has the pain-nerves\ndesensitized. Murgatroyd's all right. That's what he's for!\"\n\n\"But he's your friend!\" said Maril.\n\nMurgatroyd, despite his small size and furriness, had all the human\nattributes an animal which lives with humans soon acquires. Calhoun\nlooked at him with affection.\n\n\"He's my assistant. I don't ask anything of him that I can do myself.\nBut we're both Med Service. And I do things for him that he can't do\nfor himself. For example, I make coffee for him.\"\n\nMurgatroyd heard the familiar word. He said, \"_Chee!_\"\n\n\"Very well,\" agreed Calhoun. \"We'll all have some.\"\n\nHe made coffee. Murgatroyd sipped at the cup especially made for his\nlittle paws. Once he scratched at the place on his flank which had no\npain nerves. It itched. But he was perfectly content. Murgatroyd\nwould always be contented when he was somewhere near Calhoun.\n\nAnother hour went by. Murgatroyd climbed up into Calhoun's lap and\nwith a determined air went to sleep there. Calhoun disturbed him long\nenough to get an instrument out of his pocket. He listened to\nMurgatroyd's heartbeat, while Murgatroyd dozed.\n\n\"Maril,\" he said. \"Write down something for me. The time, and\nninety-six, and one-twenty over ninety-four.\"\n\nShe obeyed, not comprehending. Half an hour later, still not stirring\nto disturb Murgatroyd, he had her write down another time and sequence\nof figures, only slightly different from the first. Half an hour later\nstill, a third set. But then he put Murgatroyd down, well satisfied.\n\nHe took his own temperature. He nodded.\n\n\"Murgatroyd and I have one more chore to do,\" he told her. \"Would you\ngo in the other cabin for a moment?\"\n\nDisturbed, she went into the other cabin. Calhoun drew a small sample\nof blood from the insensitive area on Murgatroyd's flank. Murgatroyd\nsubmitted with complete confidence in the man. In ten minutes Calhoun\nhad diluted the sample, added an anticoagulant, shaken it up\nthoroughly, and filtered it to clarity with all red and white\ncorpuscles removed. Another Med Ship man would have considered that\nCalhoun had had Murgatroyd prepare a splendid small sample of\nantibody-containing serum, in case something got out of hand. It would\nassuredly take care of two patients.\n\nBut a Med Ship man would also have known that it was simply one of\nthose scrupulous precautions a Med Ship man takes when using cultures\nfrom store.\n\nCalhoun put the sample away and called Maril back.\n\n\"It was nothing,\" he explained, \"but you might have felt\nuncomfortable. We simply had a bit of Med Service routine that had to\nbe gone through. It's all right now.\"\n\nHe offered no further explanation. She said, \"I'll fix lunch.\" She\nhesitated. \"You brought some food from the first Weald ship. Do you\nwant to--\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I'm squeamish,\" he admitted. \"The trouble on Dara is Med Service\nfault. Before my time, but still ... I'll stick to rations until\neverybody eats.\"\n\nHe watched her unobtrusively as the day went on. Presently he\nconsidered that she was slightly flushed. Shortly after the evening\nmeal of singularly unappetizing Darian rations, she drank thirstily.\nHe did not comment. He brought out cards and showed her a complicated\ngame of solitaire in which mental arithmetic and expert use of\nprobability increased one's chance of winning.\n\nBy midnight she'd learned the game and played it absorbedly. Calhoun\nwas able to scrutinize her without appearing to do so, and he was\nsatisfied again. When he mentioned that the Med Ship should arrive off\nDara in eight hours more, she put the cards away and went into the\nother cabin.\n\nCalhoun wrote up the log. He added the notes that Maril had made for\nhim, of Murgatroyd's pulse and blood pressure after the injection of\nthe same culture that produced fever and thirstiness in himself and\nlater, without contact with him or the culture, in Maril. He put a\nprofessional comment at the end:\n\n     _The culture seems to have retained its normal characteristics\n     during long storage in the spore state. It received and reproduced\n     rapidly. I injected .5 cc. under my skin and in less than one hour\n     my temperature was 30.8\u00b0 C. An hour later it was 30.9\u00b0 C. This was\n     its peak. It immediately returned to normal. The only other\n     observable symptom was slightly increased thirst. Bloodpressure\n     and pulse remained normal. The other person in the Med Ship\n     displayed the same symptoms, in prompt and complete repetition,\n     without physical contact._\n\nHe went to sleep, with Murgatroyd curled up in his cubbyhole, his tail\ndraped carefully over his nose.\n\nThe Med Ship broke out of overdrive at 1300 hours, ship-time. Calhoun\nmade contact with the grid and was promptly lowered to the ground.\n\nIt was almost two hours later, at 1500 hours ship-time, when the\npeople of Dara were informed by broadcast that Calhoun was to be\nexecuted immediately.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nFrom the viewpoint of Darians, who were also blueskins, the decision\nof Calhoun's guilt and the decision to execute him were reasonable\nenough. Maril protested fiercely, and her testimony agreed with\nCalhoun's in every respect, but from a blueskin viewpoint their own\nstatements were damning.\n\nCalhoun had taken four young astrogators to space. They were the only\nsemiskilled space pilots Dara had. There were no fully qualified men.\nCalhoun had asked for them, and taken them out to emptiness, and there\nhe had instructed them in modern guidance methods for ships of space.\n\nSo far there was no disagreement. He'd proposed to make them more\ncompetent pilots; more capable of driving a ship to Orede, for\nexample, to raid the enormous cattle herds there. And he'd had them\ndrive the Med Ship to Weald, against which there could be no\nobjection.\n\nBut just before arrival he had tricked all four of them by giving them\ndrugged coffee. He'd destroyed the lethal bacterial cultures they'd\nbeen ordered to dump on Weald. Then he'd sent the four student pilots\noff separately, so he and Maril claimed, in huge ships crammed with\ngrain. But those ships were not to be believed in, anyhow.\n\nNobody believed in shiploads of grain to be had for the taking. They\ndid know that the only four partially experienced space pilots on Dara\nhad been taken away and by Calhoun's own story sent out of the ship\nafter they'd been drugged.\n\nHad they been trained, and had they been helped or even permitted to\nsow the seeds of plague on Weald, and had they come back prepared to\npass on training to other men to handle other space ships now\nfeverishly being built in hidden places on Dara, then Dara might have\na chance of survival.\n\nBut a space battle with only partly trained pilots would be hazardous\nat best. With no trained pilots at all, it would be hopeless. So\nCalhoun, by his own story, appeared to have doomed every living being\non Dara to massacre from the bombs of Weald.\n\nIt was this last angle which destroyed any chance of anybody believing\nin such fairy-tale objects as ships loaded down with grain. Calhoun\nhad shattered Dara's feeble hope of resistance. Weald had some ships\nand could build or buy others faster than Dara could hope to construct\nthem.\n\nEqually important, Weald had a plenitude of experienced spacemen to\nman some ships fully and train the crews of others. If it had become\ndesperately busy fighting plague, then a fleet to exterminate life on\nDara would be delayed. Dara might have gained time at least to build\nships which could ram their enemies and destroy them that way.\n\nBut Calhoun had made it impossible. If he told the truth and Weald\nalready had a fleet of huge ships which only needed to be emptied of\ngrain and filled with guns and men, then Dara was doomed. But if he\ndid not tell the truth it was equally doomed by his actions. So\nCalhoun would be killed.\n\nHis execution was to take place in the open space of the landing-grid,\nwith vision cameras transmitting the sight over all the blueskin\nplanet. Half-starved men with grisly blue blotches on their skins,\nmarched him to the center of the largest level space on the planet\nwhich was not desperately being cultivated. Their hatred showed in\ntheir expressions. Bitterness and fury surrounded Calhoun like a wall.\nMost of Dara would have liked to have seen him killed in a manner as\natrocious as his crime, but no conceivable death would be satisfying.\n\nSo the affair was coldly businesslike, with not even insults offered\nto him. He was left to stand alone in the very center of the\nlanding-grid floor. There were a hundred blasters which would fire\nupon him at the same instant. He would not only be killed; he would be\ndestroyed. He would be vaporized by the blue-white flames poured upon\nhim.\n\nHis death was remarkably close, nothing remaining but the order to\nfire, when loudspeakers from the landing-grid office froze everything.\nOne of the grain ships from Weald had broken out of overdrive and its\npilot was triumphantly calling for landing coordinates. The grid\noffice relayed his call to loudspeaker circuits as the quickest way to\nget it on the communication system of the whole planet.\n\n\"Calling ground,\" boomed the triumphant voice of the first of the\nstudent pilots Calhoun had trained. \"Calling ground! Pilot Franz in\ncaptured ship requests coordinates for landing! Purpose of landing is\nto deliver half a million bushels of grain captured from the enemy!\"\n\nAt first, nobody dared believe it. But the pilot could be seen on\nvision. He was known. No blueskin would be left alive long enough to\nbe used as a decoy by the men of Weald! Presently the giant ship on\nits second voyage to Dara--the first had been a generation ago, when\nit threatened death and destruction--appeared as a dark pinpoint in\nthe sky. It came down and down, and presently it hovered over the\ncenter of the tarmac, where Calhoun composedly stood on the spot where\nhe was to have been executed.\n\nThe landing-grid crew shifted the ship to one side, and only then did\nCalhoun stroll in a leisurely fashion toward the Med Ship by the\ngrid's metal-lace wall.\n\nThe big ship touched ground, and its exit port revolved and opened,\nand the student pilot stood there grinning and heaving out handfuls of\ngrain. There was a swarming, yelling, deliriously triumphant crowd,\nthen, where only minutes before there'd been a mob waiting to rejoice\nwhen Calhoun's living body exploded into flame.\n\nThey no longer hated Calhoun, but he had to fight his way to the Med\nShip, nevertheless. He was surrounded by ecstatically admiring\ncitizens of Dara. They shouted praise and rejoicing in his ears until\nhe was half-deafened, and they almost tore his clothing from them in\ntheir desire to touch, to pat, to assure him of their gratitude and\naffection, minutes since they'd thirsted for his blood.\n\nTwo hours after the first ship, a second landed. Dara went wild again.\nFour hours later still, the third arrived. The fourth came down to\nground on the following day.\n\nWhen Calhoun faced the executive and cabinet of Dara for the second\ntime his tone and manner were very dry.\n\n\"Now,\" he said curtly, \"I would like a few more astrogators to train.\nI think it likely that we can raid the Wealdian grain fleet one more\ntime, and in so doing get the beginning of a fleet for defense. I\ninsist, however, that it must not be used in combat. We might as well\nbe sensible about this situation! After all, four shiploads of grain\nwon't break the famine! They'll help a lot, but they're only the\nbeginning of what's needed for a planetary population!\"\n\n\"How much grain can we hope for?\" demanded a man with a blue mark\ncovering all his chin.\n\nCalhoun told him.\n\n\"How long before Weald can have a fleet overhead, dropping fusion\nbombs?\" demanded another, grimly.\n\nCalhoun named a time. But then he said, \"I think we can keep them from\ndropping bombs if we can get the grain fleet and some capable\nastrogators.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nHe told them. It was not possible to tell the whole story of what he\nconsidered sensible behavior. An emotional program can be presented\nand accepted immediately. A plan of action which is actually\nintelligent, considering all elements of a situation, has to be\naccepted piecemeal. Even so, the military men growled.\n\n\"We've plenty of heavy elements,\" said one. \"If we'd used our brains,\nwe'd have more bombs than Weald can hope for! We could turn that whole\nplanet into a smoking cinder!\"\n\n\"Which,\" said Calhoun acidly, \"would give you some satisfaction but\nnot an ounce of food! And food's more important than satisfaction.\nNow, I'm going to take off for Weald again. I'll want somebody to\nbuild an emergency device for my ship, and I'll want the four pilots\nI've trained and twenty more candidates. And I'd like to have some\ndecent rations! The last trip brought back two million bushels of\ngrain. You can certainly spare adequate food for twenty men for a few\ndays!\"\n\nIt took some time to get the special device constructed, but the Med\nShip lifted in two days more. The device for which it had waited was\nsimply a preventive of the disaster overtaking the ship from the mine\non Orede. It was essentially a tank of liquid oxygen, packed in the\nspace from which stores had been taken away. When the ship's air\nsupply was pumped past it, first moisture and then CO_{2} froze out.\n\nThen the air flowed over the liquefied oxygen at a rate to replace the\nCO_{2} with more useful breathing material. Then the moisture was\nrestored to the air as it warmed again. For so long as the oxygen\nlasted, fresh air for any number of men could be kept purified and\nbreathable. The Med Ship's normal equipment could take care of no more\nthan ten. But with this it could journey to Weald with almost any\ncomplement on board.\n\nMaril stayed on Dara when the Med Ship left. Murgatroyd protested\nshrilly when he discovered her about to be closed out by the closing\nairlock.\n\n\"_Chee!_\" he said indignantly. \"_Chee! Chee!_\"\n\n\"No,\" said Calhoun. \"We'll be crowded enough anyhow. We'll see her\nlater.\"\n\nHe nodded to one of the first four student pilots, who crisply made\ncontact with the landing-grid office, and very efficiently supervised\nas the grid took the ship up. The other three of the four\nfirst-trained men explained every move to sub-classes assigned to\neach. Calhoun moved about, listening and making certain that the\ninstruction was up to standard.\n\nHe felt queer, acting as the supervisor of an educational institution\nin space. He did not like it. There were twenty-four men beside\nhimself crowded into the Med Ship's small interior. They got in each\nother's way. They trampled on each other. There was always somebody\neating, and always somebody sleeping, and there was no need whatever\nfor the background tape to keep the ship from being intolerably\nquiet. But the air system worked well enough, except once when the\nreheating unit quit and the air inside the ship went down below\nfreezing before the trouble could be found and corrected.\n\nThe journey to Weald, this time, took seven days because of the\ntraining program in effect. Calhoun bit his nails over the delay. But\nit was necessary for each of the students to make his own line-ups on\nWeald's sun, and compute distances, and for each of them to practise\nmaneuverings that would presently be called for. Calhoun hoped\ndesperately that preparations for active warfare did not move fast on\nWeald.\n\nHe believed, however, that in the absence of direct news from Dara,\nWealdian officials would take the normal course of politicos. They had\nproclaimed the ship from Orede an attack from Dara. Therefore, they\nwould specialize on defensive measures before plumping for offense.\nThey'd get patrol ships out to spot invasion ships long before they\nworked on a fleet to destroy the blueskins. It would meet the public\ndemand for defense.\n\nCalhoun was right. The Med Ship made its final approach to Weald under\nCalhoun's own control. He'd made brightness-measurements on his\nprevious journey and he used them again. They would not be strictly\naccurate, because a sunspot could knock all meaning out of any reading\nbeyond two decimal places. But the first breakout was just far enough\nfrom the Wealdian system for Calhoun to be able to pick out its\nplanets with the electron telescope at maximum magnification. He could\naim for Weald itself, allowing, of course, for the lag in the apparent\nmotion of its image because of the limited speed of light. He tried\nthe briefest of overdrive hops, and came out within the solar system\nand well inside any watching patrol.\n\nThat was pure fortune. It continued. He'd broken through the screen of\nguard ships in undetectable overdrive. He was within half an hour's\nsolar system drive of the grain fleet. There was no alarm, at first.\nOf course radars spotted the Med Ship as an object, but nobody paid\nattention. It was not headed for Weald. It was probably assumed to be\na guard boat itself. Such mistakes do happen.\n\nAgain from the storage space from which supplies had been removed,\nCalhoun produced vacuum suits. The four first students went out, each\nescorting a less-accustomed neophyte and all fastened firmly together\nwith space ropes. They warmed the interiors of four ships and went on\nto others. Presently there were eight ships making ready for an\ninterstellar journey, each with a scared but resolute new pilot\nfamiliarizing himself with its controls. There were sixteen ships.\nTwenty. Twenty-three.\n\nA guard ship came humming out from Weald. It would be armed, of\ncourse. It came droning, droning up the forty-odd thousand miles from\nthe planet. Calhoun swore. He could not call his students and tell\nthem what was toward. The guard ship would overhear. He could not\ntrust untried young men to act rationally if they were unaware and the\nguard ship arrived and matter-of-factly attempted to board one of\nthem.\n\nThen he was inspired. He called Murgatroyd, placed him before the\ncommunicator, and set it at voice-only transmission. This was familiar\nenough, to Murgatroyd. He'd often seen Calhoun use a communicator.\n\n\"_Chee!_\" shrilled Murgatroyd. \"_Chee-chee!_\"\n\nA startled voice came out of the speaker: \"What's that?\"\n\n\"_Chee_,\" said Murgatroyd zestfully.\n\nThe communicator was talking to him. Murgatroyd adored three things,\nin order. One was Calhoun. The second was coffee. The third was\npretending to converse like a human being. The speaker said\nexplosively, \"You there, identify yourself!\"\n\n\"_Chee-chee-chee-chee!_\" observed Murgatroyd. He wriggled with\npleasure and added, reasonably enough, \"_Chee!_\"\n\nThe communicator bawled, \"Calling ground! Calling ground! Listen to\nthis! Something that ain't human's talking at me on a communicator!\nListen in an' tell me what to do!\"\n\nMurgatroyd interposed with another shrill, \"_Chee!_\"\n\nThen Calhoun pulled the Med Ship slowly away from the clump of\nstill-lifeless grain ships. It was highly improbable that the guard\nboat would carry an electron telescope. Most likely it would have only\nan echo-radar, and so could determine only that an object of some sort\nmoved of its own accord in space. Calhoun let the Med Ship accelerate.\nThat would be final evidence. The grain ships were between Weald and\nits sun. Even electron telescopes on the ground--and electron\ntelescopes were ultimately optical telescopes with electronic\namplification--could not get a good image of the ship through sunlit\natmosphere.\n\n\"_Chee?_\" asked Murgatroyd solicitously. \"_Chee-chee-chee?_\"\n\n\"Is it blueskins?\" shakily demanded the voice from the guard boat.\n\"Ground! Ground! Is it blueskins?\"\n\nA heavy, authoritative voice came in with much greater volume. \"That's\nno human voice,\" it said harshly. \"Approach its ship and send back an\nimage. Don't fire first unless it heads for ground.\"\n\nThe guard ship swerved and headed for the Med Ship. It was still a\nvery long way off.\n\n\"_Chee-chee_,\" said Murgatroyd encouragingly.\n\nCalhoun changed the Med Ship's course. The guard ship changed course\ntoo. Calhoun let it draw nearer, but only a little. He led it away\nfrom the fleet of grain ships.\n\nHe swung his electron telescope on them. He saw a spacesuited figure\noutside one, safely roped, however. It was easy to guess that someone\nhad meant to return to the Med Ship for orders or to make a report,\nand found the Med Ship gone. He'd go back inside and turn on a\ncommunicator.\n\n\"_Chee!_\" said Murgatroyd.\n\nThe heavy voice boomed. \"You there! This is a human-occupied world! If\nyou come in peace, cut your drive and let our guard ship approach!\"\n\nMurgatroyd replied in an interested but doubtful tone. The booming\nvoice bellowed. Another voice of higher authority took over.\nMurgatroyd was entranced that so many people wanted to talk to him. He\nmade what for him was practically an oration. The last voice spoke\npersuasively and suavely.\n\n\"_Chee-chee-chee-chee_,\" said Murgatroyd.\n\nOne of the grain ships flickered and ceased to be. It had gone into\noverdrive. Another. And another. Suddenly they began to flick out of\nsight by twos and threes.\n\n\"_Chee_,\" said Murgatroyd with a note of finality.\n\nThe last grain ship vanished.\n\n\"Calling guard ship,\" said Calhoun dryly. \"This is Med Ship _Aesclipus\nTwenty_. I called here a couple of weeks ago. You've been talking to\nmy _tormal_, Murgatroyd.\"\n\nA pause. A blank pause. Then profanity of deep and savage\nintemperance.\n\n\"I've been on Dara,\" said Calhoun.\n\nDead silence fell.\n\n\"There's a famine there,\" said Calhoun deliberately. \"So the grain\nships you've had in orbit have been taken away by men from\nDara--blueskins if you like--to feed themselves and their families.\nThey've been dying of hunger and they don't like it.\"\n\nThere was a single burst of the unprintable. Then the formerly suave\nvoice said waspishly, \"Well? The Med Service will hear of your\ninterference!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Calhoun. \"I'll report it myself. I have a message for you.\nDara is ready to pay for every ounce of grain and for the ships it was\nstored in. They'll pay in heavy metals--irridium, uranium, that sort\nof thing.\"\n\nThe suave voice fairly curdled.\n\n\"As if we'd allow anything that was ever on Dara to touch ground\nhere!\"\n\n\"Ah! But there can be sterilization. To begin with metals, uranium\nmelts at 1150\u00b0 centigrade, and tungsten at 3370\u00b0 and irridium at\n2350\u00b0. You could load such things and melt them down in space and then\ntow them home. And you can actually sterilize a lot of other useful\nmaterials!\"\n\nThe suave voice was infuriated: \"I'll report this! You'll suffer for\nthis!\"\n\nCalhoun said pleasantly, \"I'm sure that what I say is being recorded,\nso that I'll add that it's perfectly practical for Wealdians to land\non Dara, take whatever property they think wise--to pay for damage\ndone by blueskins, of course--and get back to Wealdian ships with\nabsolutely no danger of carrying contagion. If you'll make sure the\nrecording's clear....\"\n\nHe described, clearly and specifically, exactly how a man could be\noutfitted to walk into any area of any conceivable contagion, do\nwhatever seemed necessary in the way of looting--but Calhoun did not\nuse the word--and then return to his fellows with no risk whatever of\nbringing back infection. He gave exact details.\n\nThen he said, \"My radar says you've four ships converging on me to\nblast me out of space. I sign off.\"\n\nThe Med Ship disappeared from normal space, and entered that\nimprobably stressed area of extension which it formed about itself and\nin which physical constants were wildly strange. For one thing, the\nspeed of light in overdrive-stressed space had not been measured yet.\nIt was too high. For another, a ship could travel very many times\n186,000 miles per second in overdrive.\n\nThe Med Ship did just that. There was nobody but Calhoun and\nMurgatroyd on board. There was companionable silence, with only the\nsmall threshold-of-perception sounds which one did not often notice.\n\nCalhoun luxuriated in regained privacy. For seven days he'd had\ntwenty-four other human beings crowded into the two cabins of the\nship, with never so much as one yard of space between himself and\nsomeone else. One need not be snobbish to wish to be alone sometimes!\n\nMurgatroyd licked his whiskers thoughtfully.\n\n\"I hope,\" said Calhoun, \"that things work out right. But they may\nremember on Dara that I'm responsible for some ten million bushels of\ngrain reaching them. Maybe, just possibly, they'll listen to me and\nact sensibly. After all, there's only one way to break a famine. Not\nwith ten million bushels for a whole planet! And certainly not with\nbombs!\"\n\nDriving direct, without pausing for practising, the Med Ship could\narrive at Dara in a little more than five days. Calhoun looked forward\nto relaxation. As a beginning he made ready to give himself an\nadequate meal for the first time since first landing on Dara. Then,\npresently, he sat down to a double meal of Darian famine-rations,\nwhich were far from appetizing. But there wasn't anything else on\nboard.\n\nHe had some pleasure later, though, envisioning what went on in the\nnormal, non-overdrive universe. Suns flared, and comets hurtled on\ntheir way, and clouds formed and dropped down rain, and all sorts of\ncelestial and meteorological phenomena took place. On Weald,\nobviously, there would be purest panic.\n\nThe vanishing of the grain fleet wouldn't be charged against\ntwenty-four men. A Darian fleet would be suspected, and with the\nsuspicion would come terror, and with terror a governmental crisis.\nThen there'd be a frantic seizure of any craft that could take to\nspace, and the agitated improvisation of a space fleet.\n\nBut besides that, biological-warfare technicians would examine\nCalhoun's instructions for equipment by which armed men could be\nlanded on a plague-stricken planet and then safely taken off again.\nMilitary and governmental officials would come to the eminently sane\nconclusion that while Calhoun could not well take active measures\nagainst blueskins, as a sane and proper citizen of the galaxy he would\nbe on the side of law and order and propriety and justice--in short,\nof Weald. So they ordered sample anticontagion suits made according to\nCalhoun's directions, and they had them tested. They worked admirably.\n\nOn Dara, while Calhoun journeyed placidly back to it, grain was\ndistributed lavishly, and everybody on the planet had their cereal\nration almost doubled. It was still not a comfortable ration, but the\nrelief was great. There was considerable gratitude felt for Calhoun,\nwhich as usual included a lively anticipation of further favors to\ncome. Maril was interviewed repeatedly, as the person best able to\ndiscuss him, and she did his reputation no harm. That was all that\nhappened on Dara....\n\nNo. There was something else. A very curious thing, too. There was a\nspread of mild symptoms which nobody could exactly call a disease.\nThey lasted only a few hours. A person felt slightly feverish, and ran\na temperature which peaked at 30.9\u00b0 centigrade, and drank more water\nthan usual. Then his temperature went back to normal and he forgot all\nabout it. There have always been such trivial epidemics. They are\nrarely recorded, because few people think to go to a doctor. That was\nthe case here.\n\nCalhoun looked ahead a little, too. Presently the fleet of grain ships\nwould arrive and unload and lift again for Orede, and this time they\nwould make an infinity of slaughter among wild cattle herds, and bring\nback incredible quantities of fresh-slaughtered frozen beef. Almost\neverybody would get to taste meat again, which would be most\ngratifying.\n\nThen, the industries of Dara would labor at government-required tasks.\nAn astonishing amount of fissionable material would be fashioned into\nbombs--a concession by Calhoun--and plastic factories would make an\nastonishing number of plastic sag-suits. And large shipments of heavy\nmetals in ingots would be made to the planet's capital city and there\nwould be some guns and minor items.\n\nPerhaps somebody could have predicted any of these items in advance,\nbut it was unlikely that anyone did. Nobody but Calhoun, however,\nwould ever have put them together and hoped very urgently that things\nwould work out. He could see a promising total result. In fact, in the\nMed Ship hurtling through space, on the fourth day of his journey, he\nthought of an improvement that could be made in the sum of all those\nhappenings when they got mixed together.\n\nHe got back to Dara. Maril came to the Med Ship. Murgatroyd greeted\nher with enthusiasm.\n\n\"Something strange has happened,\" said Maril, very much subdued. \"I\ntold you that sometimes blueskin markings fade out on children, and\nthen neither they nor their children ever have markings again.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Calhoun. \"I remember that you told me.\"\n\n\"And you were reminded of a group of viruses on Tralee. You said they\nonly took hold of people in terribly bad physical condition, but then\nthey could be passed on from mother to child, until sometimes they\ndied out.\"\n\nCalhoun blinked.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Korvan,\" said Maril very carefully. \"Has worked out an idea that\nthat's what happens to the blueskin markings on Darians. He thinks\nthat people almost dead of the plague could get the virus, and if they\nrecovered from the plague pass the virus on and be blueskins.\"\n\n\"Interesting,\" said Calhoun, noncommittally.\n\n\"And when we went to Weald,\" said Maril very carefully indeed, \"you\nwere working with some culture material. You wrote quite a lot about\nit in the ship's log. You gave yourself an injection. Remember? And\nMurgatroyd? You wrote down your temperature, and Murgatroyd's?\" She\nmoistened her lips. \"You said that if infection passed between us,\nsomething would be very infectious indeed?\"\n\n\"This is a long discussion,\" said Calhoun. \"Does it arrive at a\npoint?\"\n\n\"It does,\" said Maril. \"Thousands of people are having their\npigment-spots fade away. Not only children but grownups. And Korvan\nhas found out that it always seems to happen after a day when they\nfelt feverish and very thirsty, and then felt all right again. You\ntried out something that made you feverish and thirsty. I had it too,\nin the ship. Korvan thinks there's been an epidemic of something that\nis obliterating the blue spots on everybody that catches it. There are\nalways trivial epidemics that nobody notices. Korvan's found evidence\nof one that's making _blueskin_ no longer a word with any meaning.\"\n\n\"Remarkable!\" said Calhoun.\n\n\"Did you do it?\" asked Maril. \"Did you start a harmless epidemic that\nwipes out the virus that makes blueskins?\"\n\nCalhoun said in feigned astonishment, \"How can you think such a thing,\nMaril?\"\n\n\"Because I was there,\" said Maril. She said, somehow desperately, \"I\nknow you did it! But the question is, are you going to tell? When\npeople find they're not blueskins any longer, when there's no such\nthing as a blueskin any longer, will you tell them why?\"\n\n\"Naturally not,\" said Calhoun. \"Why?\" Then he guessed. \"Has Korvan--\"\n\n\"He thinks,\" said Maril, \"that he thought it up all by himself. He's\nfound the proof. He's very proud. I'd have to tell him how the ideas\ngot into his head if you were going to tell. And he'd be ashamed and\nangry.\"\n\nCalhoun considered, staring at her.\n\n\"How it happened doesn't matter,\" he said at last. \"The idea of\nanybody doing it deliberately would be disturbing, too. It shouldn't\nget about. So it seems much the best thing for Korvan to discover\nwhat's happened to the blueskin pigment, and how it happened. But not\nwhy.\"\n\nShe read his face carefully.\n\n\"You aren't doing it as a favor to me,\" she decided. \"You'd rather it\nwas that way.\"\n\nShe looked at him for a long time, until he squirmed. Then she nodded\nand went away.\n\nAn hour later the Wealdian space fleet was reported massed in space\nand driving for Dara.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nThere were small scout ships which came on ahead of the main fleet.\nThey'd originally been guard boats, intended for solar system duty\nonly and quite incapable of overdrive. They'd come from Weald in the\ncargo holds of the liners now transformed into fighting ships. The\nscouts swept low, transmitting fine-screen images back to the fleet,\nof all they might see before they were shot down. They found the\nlanding-grid. It contained nothing larger than Calhoun's Med Ship,\n_Aesclipus Twenty_.\n\nThey searched here and there. They flittered to and fro, scanning wide\nbands of the surface of Dara. The planet's cities and highways and\nindustrial centers were wholly open to inspection from the sky. It\nlooked as if the scouts hunted most busily for the fleet of former\ngrain ships which Calhoun had said the blueskins had seized and rushed\naway. If the scouts looked for them, they did not find them.\n\nDara offered no opposition to the ships. Nothing rose to space to\noppose or to resist their search. They went darting over every portion\nof the hungry planet, land and seas alike, and there was no sign of\nmilitary preparedness against their coming. The huge ships of the main\nfleet waited while the scouts reported monotonously that they saw no\nsign of the stolen fleet. But the stolen fleet was the only means by\nwhich the planet could be defended. There could be no point in a\npitched battle in emptiness. But a fleet with a planet to back it\nmight be dangerous.\n\nHours passed. The Wealdian main fleet waited. There was no offensive\nmovement by the fleet. There was no defensive action from the ground.\nWith fusion-bombs certain to be involved in any actual conflict, there\nwas something like an embarrassed pause. The Wealdian ships were ready\nto bomb. They were less anxious to be vaporized by possible suicide\ndashes of defending ships which might blow themselves up near contact\nwith their enemies.\n\nBut a fleet cannot travel some light-years through space to make a\nmere threat. And the Wealdian fleet was furnished with the material\nfor total devastation. It could drop bombs from hundreds, or\nthousands, or even tens of thousands of miles away. It could cover the\nworld of Dara with mushroom clouds springing up and spreading to make\na continuous pall of atomic-fusion products. And they could settle\ndown and kill every living thing not destroyed by the explosions\nthemselves. Even the creatures of the deepest oceans would die of\ndeadly, purposely-contrived fallout particles.\n\nThe Wealdian fleet contemplated its own destructiveness. It found no\ncapacity for defense on Dara. It moved forward.\n\nBut then a message went out from the capital city of Dara. It said\nthat a ship in overdrive had carried word to a Darian fleet in space.\nThe Darian fleet now hurtled toward Weald. It was a fleet of\nthirty-seven giant ships. They carried such-and-such bombs in\nsuch-and-such quantities. Unless its orders were countermanded, it\nwould deliver those bombs on Weald, set to explode. If Weald bombed\nDara, the orders could not be withdrawn. So Weald could bomb Dara. It\ncould destroy all life on the pariah planet. But Weald would die with\nit.\n\nThe fleet ceased its advance. The situation was a stalemate with pure\ndesperation on one side and pure frustration on the other. This was no\nway to end the war. Neither planet could trust the other, even for\nminutes. If they did not destroy each other simultaneously, as now was\npossible, each would expect the other to launch an unwarned attack at\nsome other moment. Ultimately one or the other must perish, and the\nsurvivor would be the one most skilled in treachery.\n\nBut then the pariah planet made a new proposal. It would send a\nmessenger ship to stop its own fleet's bombardment if Weald would\naccept payment of the grain ships and their cargos. It would pay in\ningots of irridium and uranium and tungsten, and gold if Weald wished\nit, for all damages Weald might claim.\n\nIt would even pay indemnity for the miners of Orede, who had died by\naccident but perhaps in some sense through its fault. It would pay.\nBut if it were bombed, Weald must spout atomic fire and the fleet of\nWeald would have no home planet to return to.\n\nThis proposal seemed both craven and foolish. It would allow the fleet\nof Weald to loot and then betray Dara. But it was Calhoun's idea. It\nseemed plausible to the admirals of Weald. They felt only contempt for\nblueskins. Contemptuously, they accepted the semi-surrender.\n\nThe broadcast waves of Dara told of agreement, and wild and fierce\nresentment filled the pariah planet's people. There was almost\nrevolution to insist upon resistance, however hopeless and however\nfatal. But not all of Dara realized that a vital change had come about\nin the state of things on Dara. The enemy fleet had not a hint of it.\n\nIn menacing array, the invading fleet spread itself about the skies of\nDara, well beyond the atmosphere. Harsh voices talked with increasing\narrogance to the landing-grid staff. A monster ship of Weald came\nheavily down, riding the landing-grid's force-fields. It touched\ngently. Its occupants were apprehensive, but hungry for the loot they\nhad been assured was theirs. The ship's outer hull would be sterilized\nbefore it returned to Weald, of course. And there was adequate\nprotection for the landing-party.\n\nMen came out of the ship's ports. They wore the double, transparent\nsag-suits Calhoun had suggested, which had been painstakingly tested,\nand which were perfect protection against contagion. They were double\ngarments of plastic, with air tanks inside the inner flexible\nenvelope.\n\nMen wearing such sag-suits could walk about on Dara. They could work\non Dara. They could loot with impunity and all contamination must\nremain outside the suits, and on their return to their ships they\nwould simply stand in the airlocks while corrosive gases swirled\naround them, killing any possible organism of disease. Then, for extra\nassurance, when air from Weald filled the airlock again, the men would\nburn the outer plastic covering and step into the ship without ever\nhaving come within two layers of plastic of infection.\n\nWhat loot they gathered, obviously, could be decontaminated before it\nwas returned to Weald. Metals could be melted, if necessary. Gems\ncould be sterilized. It was a most satisfactory discovery, to realize\nthat blueskins could be not only scorned but robbed. There was only\none bit of irrelevant information the space fleet of Weald did not\nhave.\n\nThat information was that the people of Dara weren't blueskins any\nlonger. There'd been a trivial epidemic....\n\nThe sag-suited men of Weald went zestfully about their business. They\ntook over the landing-grid's operation, driving the Darian operators\naway. For the first time in history the operators of a landing-grid\nwore make-up to look like they did have blue pigment in their skins.\nThey didn't. The Wealdian landing-party tested the grid's operation.\nThey brought down another giant ship. Then another. And another.\n\nParties in the shiny sag-suits spread through the city. There were the\nhuge stockpiles of precious metals, brought in readiness to be\nsurrendered and carried away. Some men set to work to load these into\nthe holds of the ships of Weald. Some went forthrightly after personal\nloot.\n\nThey came upon very few Darians. Those they saw kept sullenly away\nfrom them. They entered shops and took what they fancied. They\nzestfully removed the treasure of banks.\n\nTriumphant and scornful reports went up to the hovering great ships.\nThe blueskins, said the reports, were spiritless and cowardly. They\npermitted themselves to be robbed. They kept out of the way. It had\nbeen observed that the population was streaming out of the city,\nfleeing because they feared the ships' landing-parties. The blueskins\nhad abjectly produced all they'd promised of precious metals, but\nthere was more to be taken.\n\nMore ships came down, and more. Some of the first, heavily loaded,\nwere lifted to emptiness again and the process of decontamination of\ntheir hulls began. There was jealousy among the ships in space for\nthose upon the ground. The first-landed ships had had their choice of\nloot. There were squabblings about priorities, now that the navy of\nWeald plainly had a license to steal. There was confusion among the\nmembers of the landing-parties. Discipline disappeared. Men in plastic\nsag-suits roved about as individuals, seeking what they might loot.\n\nThere were armed and alerted landing-parties around the grid itself,\nof course, but the capital city of Dara lay open. Men coming back with\nloot found their ships already lifted off to make room for others.\nThey were pushed into re-embarking-parties of other ships. There were\nmore and more men to be found on ships where they did not belong, and\nmore and more not to be found where they did.\n\nBy the time half the fleet had been aground, there was no longer any\npretense of holding a ship down until all its crew returned. There\nwere too many other ships' companies clamoring for their turn to loot.\nThe rosters of many ships, indeed, bore no particular relationship to\nthe men actually on board.\n\nThere were less than fifteen ships whose to-be-fumigated holds were\nstill emptied, when the watchful government of Dara broadcast a new\nmessage to the invaders. It requested that the looting stop. No matter\nwhat payment Weald claimed, it had taken payment five times over. Now\nwas time to stop.\n\nIt was amusing. The space admiral of Weald ordered his ships alerted\nfor action. The message ship, ordering the Darian fleet away from\nWeald, had been sent off long since. No other ship could get away now!\nThe Darians could take their choice: accept the consequences of\nsurrender, or the fleet would rise to throw down bombs.\n\nCalhoun was asking politely to be taken to the Wealdian admiral when\nthe trouble began. It wasn't on the ground, at all. Everything was\nunder splendid control where a landing force occupied the grid and all\nthe ground immediately about it. The space admiral had headquarters in\nthe landing-grid office. Reports came in, orders were issued,\nadmirably crisp salutes were exchanged among sag-suited men.\nEverything was in perfect shape there.\n\nBut there was panic among the ships in space. Communicators gave off\nhorrified, panic-stricken yells. There were screamings. Intelligible\ncommunications ceased. Ships plunged crazily this way and that. Some\nvanished in overdrive. At least one plunged at full power into a\nDarian ocean.\n\nThe space admiral found himself in command of fifteen ships only out\nof all his former force. The rest of the fleet went through a period\nof hysterical madness. In some ships it lasted for minutes only. In\nothers it went on for half an hour or more. Then they hung overhead,\nbut did not reply to calls.\n\nCalhoun arrived at the spaceport with Murgatroyd riding on his\nshoulder. A bewildered officer in a sag-suit halted him.\n\n\"I've come,\" said Calhoun, \"to speak to the admiral. My name is\nCalhoun and I'm Med Service, and I think I met the admiral at a\nbanquet a few weeks ago. He'll remember me.\"\n\n\"You'll have to wait,\" protested the officer. \"There's some trouble--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Calhoun. \"I know about it. I helped design it. I want to\nexplain it to the admiral. He needs to know what's happened, if he's\nto take appropriate measures.\"\n\nThere were jitterings. Many men in sag-suits had still no idea that\nanything had gone wrong. Some appeared, brightly carrying loot. Some\nhung eagerly around the airlocks of ships on the grid tarmac, waiting\ntheir turns to stand in corrosive gases for the decontamination of\ntheir suits, when they would burn the outer layers and step, aseptic\nand happy, into a Wealdian ship again. There they could think how rich\nthey were going to be back on Weald.\n\nBut the situation aloft was bewildering and very, very ominous. There\nwas strident argument. Presently Calhoun stood before the Wealdian\nadmiral.\n\n\"I came to explain something,\" said Calhoun pleasantly. \"The situation\nhas changed. You've noticed it, I'm sure.\"\n\nThe admiral glared at him through two layers of plastic, which covered\nhim almost like a gift-wrapped parcel.\n\n\"Be quick!\" he rasped.\n\n\"First,\" said Calhoun, \"there are no more blueskins. An epidemic of\nsomething or other has made the blue patches on the skins of Darians\nfade out. There have always been some who didn't have blue patches.\nNow nobody has them.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" rasped the admiral. \"And what has that got to do with this\nsituation?\"\n\n\"Why, everything,\" said Calhoun mildly. \"It seems that Darians can\npass for Wealdians whenever they please. That they _are_ passing for\nWealdians. That they've been mixing with your men, wearing sag-suits\nexactly like the one you're wearing now. They've been going aboard\nyour ships in the confusion of returning looters. There's not a ship\nnow aloft, which has been aground today, which hasn't from one to\nfifteen Darians--no longer blueskins--on board.\"\n\nThe admiral roared. Then his face turned gray.\n\n\"You can't take your fleet back to Weald,\" said Calhoun gently, \"if\nyou believe its crews have been exposed to carriers of the Dara\nplague. You wouldn't be allowed to land, anyhow.\"\n\nThe admiral said through stiff lips, \"I'll blast--\"\n\n\"No,\" said Calhoun, again gently. \"When you ordered all ships alerted\nfor action, the Darians on each ship released panic gas. They only\nneeded tiny, pocket-sized containers of the gas for the job. They had\nthem. They only needed to use air tanks from their sag-suits to\nprotect themselves against the gas. They kept them handy.\n\n\"On nearly all your ships aloft your crews are crazy from panic gas.\nThey'll stay that way until the air is changed. Darians have\nbarricaded themselves in the control rooms of most if not all your\nships. You haven't got a fleet. The few ships who will obey your\norders--if they drop one bomb, our fleet off Weald will drop fifty.\n\n\"I don't think you'd better order offensive action. Instead, I think\nyou'd better have your fleet medical officers come and learn some of\nthe facts of life. There's no need for war between Dara and Weald, but\nif you insist....\"\n\nThe admiral made a choking noise. He could have ordered Calhoun\nkilled, but there was a certain appalling fact. The men aground from\nthe fleet were breathing Wealdian air from tanks. It would last so\nlong only. If they were taken on board the still obedient ships\noverhead, Darians would unquestionably be mixed with them. There was\nno way to take off the parties now aground without exposing them to\ncontact with Darians, on the ground or in the ships. There was no way\nto sort out the Darians.\n\n\"I--I will give the orders,\" said the admiral thickly. \"I do not know\nwhat you devils plan, but--I do not know how to stop you.\"\n\n\"All that's necessary,\" said Calhoun warmly, \"is an open mind. There's\na misunderstanding to be cleared up, and some principles of planetary\nhealth practises to be explained, and a certain amount of prejudice\nthat has to be thrown away. But nobody need die of changing their\nminds. The Interstellar Medical Service has proved that over and\nover!\"\n\nMurgatroyd, perched on his shoulder, felt that it was time to take\npart in the conversation. He said, \"_Chee-chee!_\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Calhoun. \"We do want to get the job done. We're behind\nschedule now.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was not, of course, possible for Calhoun to leave immediately. He\nhad to preside at various meetings of the medical officers of the\nfleet and the health officials of Dara. He had to make explanations,\nand correct misapprehensions, and delicately suggest such biological\nexperiments as would prove to the doctors of Weald that there was no\nlonger a plague on Dara, whatever had been the case three generations\nbefore.\n\nHe had to sit by while an extremely self-confident young Darian\ndoctor--one of his names was Korvan--rather condescendingly\ndemonstrated that the former blue pigmentation was a viral product\nquite unconnected with the plague, and that it had been wiped out by a\nvery trivial epidemic of such and such.\n\nCalhoun regarded that young man with a detached interest. Maril\nthought him wonderful, even if she had to give him the material for\nhis work. He agreed with her that he was wonderful. Calhoun shrugged\nand went on with his own work.\n\nThe return of loot, mutual, full, and complete agreement that Darians\nwere no longer carriers of plague, if they had ever been--unless Weald\nconvinced other worlds of this, Weald itself would join Dara in\nisolation from neighboring worlds. A messenger ship had to recall the\ntwenty-seven ships once floating in orbit about Weald. Most of them\nwould be used for some time, to bring beef from Orede. Some would haul\nmore grain from Weald. It would be paid for. There would be a need for\ncommercial missions to be exchanged between Weald and Dara. There\nwould have to be....\n\nIt was a full week before he could go to the little Med Ship and\nprepare for departure. Even then there were matters to be attended to.\nAll the food-supplies that had been removed could not be replaced.\nThere were biological samples to be replaced and some to be destroyed.\n\nMaril came to the Med Ship again when he was almost ready to leave.\nShe did not seem comfortable.\n\n\"I wanted you to meet Korvan,\" she said regretfully.\n\n\"I met him,\" said Calhoun. \"I think he will be a most prominent\ncitizen, in time. He has all the talents for it.\"\n\nMaril smiled very faintly.\n\n\"But you don't admire him.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say that,\" protested Calhoun. \"After all, he is desirable\nto you, which is something I couldn't manage.\"\n\n\"You didn't try,\" said Maril. \"Just as I didn't try to be fascinating\nto you. Why?\"\n\nCalhoun spread out his hands. But he looked at Maril with respect. Not\nevery woman could have faced the fact that a man did not feel impelled\nto make passes at her. It is simply a fact that has nothing to do with\ndesirability or charm or anything else.\n\n\"You're going to marry him,\" he said. \"I hope you'll be very happy.\"\n\n\"He's the man I want,\" said Maril frankly. \"And I doubt he'll ever\nlook at another woman. He looks forward to splendid discoveries. I\nwish he didn't.\"\n\nCalhoun did not ask the obvious question. Instead, he said\nthoughtfully, \"There's something you could do. It needs to be done.\nThe Med Service in this sector has been badly handled. There are a\nnumber of discoveries that need to be made. I don't think your Korvan\nwould relish having things handed to him on a visible silver platter.\nBut they should be known....\"\n\nMaril said, \"I can guess what you mean. I dropped hints about the way\nthe blueskin markings went away, yes. You've got books for me?\"\n\nCalhoun nodded. He found them.\n\n\"If we had only fallen in love with each other, Maril, we'd be a team!\nToo bad! These are a wedding present you'll do well to hide.\"\n\nShe put her hands in his.\n\n\"I like you almost as much as I like Murgatroyd! Yes! Korvan will\nnever know, and he'll be a great man.\" Then she added defensively,\n\"But I don't think he'll only discover things from hints I drop him.\nHe'll make wonderful discoveries.\"\n\n\"Of which,\" said Calhoun, \"the most remarkable is you. Good luck,\nMaril!\"\n\nShe went away smiling. But she wiped her eyes when she was out of the\nship.\n\nPresently the Med Ship lifted. Calhoun aimed it for the next planet on\nthe list of those he was to visit. After this one more he'd return to\nsector headquarters with a biting report to make on the way things had\nbeen handled before him.\n\n\"Overdrive coming, Murgatroyd!\"\n\nThen the stars went out and there was silence, and privacy, and a\nfaint, faint, almost unbearable series of background sounds which kept\nthe Med Ship from being totally unendurable.\n\nLong, long days later the ship broke out of overdrive and Calhoun\nguided it to a round and sunlit world. In due time he thumbed the\ncommunicator button.\n\n\"Calling ground,\" he said crisply. \"Calling ground! Med Ship\n_Aesclipus Twenty_ reporting arrival and asking coordinates for\nlanding. Purpose of landing is planetary health inspection. Our mass\nis fifty standard tons.\"\n\nThere was a pause while the beamed message went many, many thousands\nof miles. Then the speaker said, \"_Aesclipus Twenty_, repeat your\nidentification!\"\n\nCalhoun repeated it patiently. Murgatroyd watched with bright eyes.\nPerhaps he hoped to be allowed to have another long conversation with\nsomebody by communicator.\n\n\"You are warned,\" said the communicator sternly, \"that any deceit or\ndeception about your identity or purpose in landing will be severely\npunished. We take few chances, here! If you wish to land\nnotwithstanding this warning--\"\n\n\"I'm coming in,\" said Calhoun. \"Give me the coordinates.\"\n\nHe wrote them down. His expression was slightly pained. The Med Ship\ndrove on, in solar system drive. Murgatroyd said, \"_Chee-chee? Chee?_\"\n\nCalhoun sighed.\n\n\"That's right, Murgatroyd! Here we go again!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\nFEAR RIDES THE ROCKETS\n\n\nThe Interstellar Medical Service was just about the only remaining\ngalactic organization that every one of the hundreds of inhabited\nplanets respected. So when their service broke down in Star Sector\nTwelve, it created a very dangerous situation.\n\nWhen Calhoun took his Med ship out of overdrive near that sector's\nplanet Weald, he was vaguely aware of the risks. But the crisis came\nhome to him with a crash the moment he radioed in for landing\ncoordinates.\n\n\"Contamination! Full mobilization! Red alert! Death to blueskins!\"\nSuch were the nature of his greetings.\n\nAnd it began to look like a case of the cosmic jitters that only the\nmost drastic of orbital surgery could cure.\n\nMurray Leinster, whose real name is Will F. Jenkins, has been\nentertaining the public with his exciting fiction for several decades.\nCalled the dean of modern science-fiction, he was writing these\namazing super-science adventures back in the early twenties before\nthere ever was such a thing as an all-fantasy magazine. His short\nstories, novelettes, and serial novels have appeared in most of the\nmajor American magazines, both slick and pulp, and many have been\nreprinted all over the world. He has made a distinguished name for\nhimself (or rather two names) in the fields of adventure, historical,\nwestern, sea, and suspense stories.\n\nAce Books has still available the following Murray Leinster novels:\nCITY ON THE MOON (D-277), THE PIRATES OF ZAN and THE MUTANT WEAPON\n(D-403), and THE FORGOTTEN PLANET (D-528).\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHere's a quick checklist of recent releases of\nACE SCIENCE-FICTION BOOKS\n\n35\u00a2\n\nD-498 GALACTIC DERELICT by Andre Norton\n\nD-504 MASTER OF THE WORLD by Jules Verne\n\nD-507 MEETING AT INFINITY by John Brunner\n      _and_ BEYOND THE SILVER SKY by Kenneth Bulmer\n\nD-508 MORE MACABRE Edited by Donald A.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
