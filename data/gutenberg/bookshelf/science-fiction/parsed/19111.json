There was the feel of snow in the air but the thermometer\nhovered just at the freezing mark and the clouds could turn either\ninto icy rain or snow.\n\nPatrol Sergeant Ben Martin stepped out of the door of the barracks and\nshivered as a blast of wind hit him. He pulled up the zipper on his\nloose blue uniform coveralls and paused to gauge the storm clouds\nbuilding up to the west.\n\nThe broad planes of his sunburned face turned into the driving cold\nwind for a moment and then he looked back down at the weather report\nsecured to the top of a stack of papers on his clipboard.\n\nBehind him, the door of the barracks was shouldered open by his junior\npartner, Patrol Trooper Clay Ferguson. The young, tall Canadian\nofficer's arms were loaded with paper sacks and his patrol work helmet\ndangled by its strap from the crook of his arm.\n\nClay turned and moved from the doorway into the wind. A sudden gust\nswept around the corner of the building and a small sack perched atop\none of the larger bags in his arms blew to the ground and began\ntumbling towards the drill field.\n\n\"Ben,\" he yelled, \"grab the bag.\"\n\nThe sergeant lunged as the sack bounced by and made the retrieve. He\nwalked back to Ferguson and eyed the load of bags in the blond-haired\nofficer's arms.\n\n\"Just what is all this?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Groceries,\" the youngster grinned. \"Or to be more exact, little\ngourmet items for our moments of gracious living.\"\n\nFerguson turned into the walk leading to the motor pool and Martin\nswung into step beside him. \"Want me to carry some of that junk?\"\n\n\"Junk,\" Clay cried indignantly. \"You keep your grimy paws off these\ndelicacies, peasant. You'll get yours in due time and perhaps it will\nhelp Kelly and me to make a more polished product of you instead of\nthe clodlike cop you are today.\"\n\nMartin chuckled. This patrol would mark the start of the second year\nthat he, Clay Ferguson and Medical-Surgical Officer Kelly Lightfoot\nhad been teamed together. After twenty-two patrols, cooped up in a\nsemiarmored vehicle with a man for ten days at a time, you got to know\nhim pretty well. And you either liked him or you hated his guts.\n\nAs senior officer, Martin had the right to reject or keep his partner\nafter their first eleven-month duty tour. Martin had elected to retain\nthe lanky Canadian. As soon as they had pulled into New York Barracks\nat the end of their last patrol, he had made his decisions. After\neleven months and twenty-two patrols on the Continental Thruways, each\nteam had a thirty-day furlough coming.\n\nMartin and Ferguson had headed for the city the minute they put their\nsignatures on the last of the stack of reports needed at the end of a\ntour. Then, for five days and nights, they tied one on. MSO Kelly\nLightfoot had made a beeline for a Columbia Medical School seminar on\ntissue regeneration. On the sixth day, Clay staggered out of bed,\nswigged down a handful of antireaction pills, showered, shaved and\ndressed and then waved good-by. Twenty minutes later he was aboard a\njet, heading for his parents' home in Edmonton, Alberta. Martin soloed\naround the city for another week, then rented a car and raced up to\nhis sister's home in Burlington, Vermont, to play Uncle Bountiful to\nCarol's three kids and to lap up as much as possible of his sister's\nreal cooking.\n\nWhile the troopers and their med officer relaxed, a service crew moved\ntheir car down to the Philadelphia motor pool for a full overhaul and\nrefitting for the next torturous eleven-month-tour of duty.\n\nThe two patrol troopers had reported into the Philadelphia Barracks\nfive days ago--Martin several pounds heavier courtesy of his sister's\ncooking; Ferguson several pounds lighter courtesy of three assorted,\nstarry-eyed, uniform-struck Alberta maidens.\n\nThey turned into the gate of the motor pool and nodded to the sentry\nat the gate. To their left, the vast shop buildings echoed to the\nsound of body-banging equipment and roaring jet engines. The darkening\nsky made the brilliant lights of the shop seem even brighter and the\nhulls of a dozen patrol cars cast deep shadows around the work crews.\n\nThe troopers turned into the dispatcher's office and Clay carefully\nplaced the bags on a table beside the counter. Martin peered into one\nof the bags. \"Seriously, kid, what do you have in that grab bag?\"\n\n\"Oh, just a few essentials,\" Clay replied \"_Pate de foie gras_, sharp\ncheese, a smidgen of cooking wine, a handful of spices. You know,\nstuff like that. Like I said--essentials.\"\n\n\"Essentials,\" Martin snorted, \"you give your brains to one of those\nAlberta chicks of yours for a souvenir?\"\n\n\"Look, Ben,\" Ferguson said earnestly, \"I suffered for eleven months in\nthat tin mausoleum on tracks because of what you fondly like to think\nis edible food. You've got as much culinary imagination as Beulah. I\ntake that back. Even Beulah turns out some better smells when she's\nriding on high jet than you'll ever get out of her galley in the next\none hundred years. This tour, I intend to eat like a human being once\nagain. And I'll teach you how to boil water without burning it.\"\n\n\"Why you ungrateful young--\" Martin yelped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe patrol dispatcher, who had been listening with amused tolerance,\nleaned across the counter.\n\n\"If Oscar Waldorf is through with his culinary lecture, gentlemen,\" he\nsaid, \"perhaps you two could be persuaded to take a little pleasure\nride. It's a lovely night for a drive and it's just twenty-six hundred\nmiles to the next service station. If you two aren't cooking anything\nat the moment, I know that NorCon would simply adore having the\nservices of two such distinguished Continental Commandos.\"\n\nFerguson flushed and Martin scowled at the dispatcher. \"Very funny,\nclown. I'll recommend you for trooper status one of these days.\"\n\n\"Not me,\" the dispatcher protested. \"I'm a married man. You'll never\nget me out on the road in one of those blood-and-gut factories.\"\n\n\"So quit sounding off to us heroes,\" Martin said, \"and give us the\nclearances.\"\n\nThe dispatcher opened a loose-leaf reference book on the counter and\nthen punched the first of a series of buttons on a panel. Behind him,\nthe wall lighted with a map of the eastern United States to the\nMississippi River. Ferguson and Martin had pencils out and poised over\ntheir clipboards.\n\nThe dispatcher glanced at the order board across the room where patrol\ncar numbers and team names were displayed on an illuminated board.\n\"Car 56--Martin-Ferguson-Lightfoot,\" glowed with an amber light. In\nthe column to the right was the number \"26-W.\" The dispatcher punched\nanother button. A broad belt of multi-colored lines representing the\neastern segment of North American Thruway 26 flashed onto the map in a\nband extending from Philadelphia to St. Louis. The thruway went on to\nLos Angeles in its western segment, not shown on the map. Ten bands of\ncolor--each five separated by a narrow clear strip, detailed the\nthruway. Martin and Ferguson were concerned with the northern five\nbands; NAT 26-westbound. Other unlighted lines radiated out in\ntangential spokes to the north and south along the length of the\nmulti-colored belt of NAT 26.\n\nThis was just one small segment of the Continental Thruway system that\nspanned North America from coast to coast and crisscrossed north and\nsouth under the Three Nation Road Compact from the southern tip of\nMexico into Canada and Alaska.\n\nEach arterial cut a five-mile-wide path across the continent and from\none end to the other, the only structures along the roadways were the\nturretlike NorCon Patrol check and relay stations--looming up at\none-hundred-mile intervals like the fire control islands of\nearlier-day aircraft carriers.\n\nCar 56 with Trooper Sergeant Ben Martin, Trooper Clay Ferguson and\nMedical-Surgical Officer Kelly Lightfoot, would take their first\nten-day patrol on NAT 26-west. Barring major disaster, they would eat,\nsleep and work the entire time from their car; out of sight of any but\ndistant cities until they had reached Los Angeles at the end of the\npatrol. Then a five-day resupply and briefing period and back onto\nanother thruway.\n\nDuring the coming patrol they would cross ten state lines as if they\ndidn't exist. And as far as thruway traffic control and authority was\nconcerned, state and national boundaries actually didn't exist. With\nthe growth of the old interstate highway system and the Alcan Highway\nit became increasingly evident that variation in motor vehicle laws\nfrom state to state and country to country were creating impossible\nsituations for any uniform safety control.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWith the establishment of the Continental Thruway System two decades\nlater, came the birth of the supra-cop--The North American Thruway\nPatrol, known as NorCon. Within the five-mile bands of the\nthruways--all federally-owned land by each of the three nations--the\nblue-coveralled \"Continental Commandos\" of NorCon were the sole law\nenforcement agency and authority. Violators of thruway law were cited\ninto NorCon district traffic courts located in the nearest city to\neach access port along every thruway.\n\nThere was no challenge to the authority of NorCon. Public demand for\nfaster and more powerful vehicles had forced the automotive industry\nto put more and more power under the touch of the ever-growing\nmillions of drivers crowding the continent's roads. Piston drive gave\nway to turbojet; turbojet was boosted by a modification of ram jet and\nair-cushion drive was added. In the last two years, the first of the\nnuclear reaction mass engines had hit the roads. Even as the hot\nFerraris and Jags of the mid-'60s would have been suicide vehicles on\nthe T-model roads of the '20s so would today's vehicles be on the\ninterstates of the '60s. But building roads capable of handling three\nhundred to four hundred miles an hour speeds was beyond the financial\nand engineering capabilities of individual states and nations. Thus\ngrew the continental thruways with their four speed lanes in each\ndirection, each a half-mile wide separated east and west and north and\nsouth by a half-mile-wide landscaped divider. Under the Three Nation\nCompact, the thruways now wove a net across the entire North American\ncontinent.\n\nOn the big wall map, NAT 26-west showed as four colored lines; blue\nand yellow as the two high and ultra-high speed lanes; green and white\nfor the intermediate and slow lanes. Between the blue and yellow and\nthe white and green was a red band. This was the police emergency\nlane, never used by other than official vehicles and crossed by the\ntraveling public shifting from one speed lane to another only at\nsweeping crossovers.\n\nThe dispatcher picked up an electric pointer and aimed the light beam\nat the map. Referring to his notes, he began to recite.\n\n\"Resurfacing crews working on 26-W blue at milestone Marker 185 to\nMarker 187, estimated clearance 0300 hours Tuesday--Let's see, that's\ntomorrow morning.\"\n\nThe two officers were writing the information down on their\ntrip-analysis sheets.\n\n\"Ohio State is playing Cal under the lights at Columbus tonight so you\ncan expect a traffic surge sometime shortly after 2300 hours but most\nof it will stay in the green and white. Watch out for the drunks\nthough. They might filter out onto the blue or yellow.\n\n\"The crossover for NAT 163 has painting crews working. Might watch out\nfor any crud on the roadway. And they've got the entrance blocked\nthere so that all 163 exchange traffic is being rerouted to 164 west\nof Chillicothe.\"\n\nThe dispatcher thumbed through his reference sheets. \"That seems to be\nabout all. No, wait a minute. This is on your trick. The Army's got a\npriority missile convoy moving out of the Aberdeen Proving Grounds\nbound for the west coast tonight at 1800 hours. It will be moving at\ngreen lane speeds so you might watch out for it. They'll have\nthirty-four units in the convoy. And that is all. Oh, yes. Kelly's\nalready aboard. I guess you know about the weather.\"\n\nMartin nodded. \"Yup. We should be hitting light snows by 2300 hours\ntonight in this area and it could be anything from snow to ice-rain\nafter that.\" He grinned at his younger partner. \"The vacation is over,\nsonny. Tonight we make a man out of you.\"\n\nFerguson grinned back. \"Nuts to you, pop. I've got character witnesses\nback in Edmonton who'll give you glowing testimonials about my\nmanhood.\"\n\n\"Testimonials aren't legal unless they're given by adults,\" Martin\nretorted. \"Come on, lover boy. Duty calls.\"\n\nClay carefully embraced his armload of bundles and the two officers\nturned to leave. The dispatcher leaned across the counter.\n\n\"Oh, Ferguson, one thing I forgot. There's some light corrugations in\nred lane just east of St. Louis. You might be careful with your\nsouffles in that area. Wouldn't want them to fall, you know.\"\n\nClay paused and started to turn back. The grinning dispatcher ducked\ninto the back office and slammed the door.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe wind had died down by the time the troopers entered the\nbrilliantly lighted parking area. The temperature seemed warmer with\nthe lessening winds but in actuality, the mercury was dropping. The\nsnow clouds to the west were much nearer and the overcast was getting\ndarker.\n\nBut under the great overhead light tubes, the parking area was\nbrighter than day. A dozen huge patrol vehicles were parked on the\nfront \"hot\" line. Scores more were lined out in ranks to the back of\nthe parking zone. Martin and Ferguson walked down the line of military\nblue cars. Number 56 was fifth on the line. Service mechs were just\nre-housing fueling lines into a ground panel as the troopers walked\nup. The technician corporal was the first to speak. \"All set, Sarge,\"\nhe said. \"We had to change an induction jet at the last minute and I\nhad the port engine running up to reline the flow. Thought I'd better\ntop 'er off for you, though, before you pull out. She sounds like a\npurring kitten.\"\n\nHe tossed the pair a waving salute and then moved out to his service\ndolly where three other mechs were waiting.\n\nThe officers paused and looked up at the bulk of the huge patrol car.\n\n\"Beulah looks like she's been to the beauty shop and had the works,\"\nMartin said. He reached out and slapped the maglurium plates. \"Welcome\nhome, sweetheart. I see you've kept a candle in the window for your\nwandering son.\" Ferguson looked up at the lighted cab, sixteen feet\nabove the pavement.\n\nCar 56--Beulah to her team--was a standard NorCon Patrol vehicle. She\nwas sixty feet long, twelve feet wide and twelve feet high; topped by\na four-foot-high bubble canopy over her cab. All the way across her\nnose was a three-foot-wide luminescent strip. This was the variable\nbeam headlight that could cut a day-bright swath of light through\nnight, fog, rain or snow and could be varied in intensity, width and\nelevation. Immediately above the headlight strip were two red-black\nplastic panels which when lighted, sent out a flashing red emergency\nsignal that could be seen for miles. Similar emergency lights and\nback-up white light strips adorned Beulah's stern. Her bow rounded\ndown like an old-time tank and blended into the track assembly of her\ndual propulsion system. With the exception of the cabin bubble and a\ntwo-foot stepdown on the last fifteen feet of her hull, Beulah was\nfree of external protrusions. Racked into a flush-decked recess on one\nside of the hull was a crane arm with a two-hundred-ton lift capacity.\nSeveral round hatches covered other extensible gear and periscopes\nused in the scores of multiple operations the NorCon cars were called\nupon to accomplish on routine road patrols.\n\nBeulah resembled a gigantic offspring of a military tank, sans heavy\narmament. But even a small stinger was part of the patrol car\nequipment. As for armament, Beulah had weapons to meet every\nconceivable skirmish in the deadly battle to keep Continental Thruways\nfast-moving and safe. Her own two-hundred-fifty-ton bulk could reach\nspeeds of close to six hundred miles an hour utilizing one or both of\nher two independent propulsion systems.\n\nAt ultra-high speeds, Beulah never touched the ground--floating on an\nimpeller air cushion and driven forward by a pair of one hundred fifty\nthousand pound thrust jets and ram jets. At intermediate high speeds,\nboth her air cushion and the four-foot-wide tracks on each side of the\ncar pushed her along at two hundred-mile-an-hour-plus speeds. Synchro\nmechanisms reduced the air cushion as the speeds dropped to afford\nmore surface traction for the tracks. For slow speeds and heavy duty,\nthe tracks carried the burden.\n\nMartin thumbed open the portside ground-level cabin door.\n\n\"I'll start the outside check,\" he told Clay. \"You stow that garbage\nof yours in the galley and start on the dispensary. I'll help you\nafter I finish out here.\"\n\nAs the younger officer entered the car and headed up the short flight\nof steps to the working deck, the sergeant unclipped a check list\nfrom the inside of the door and turned towards the stern of the big\nvehicle.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClay mounted to the work deck and turned back to the little galley\njust aft of the cab. As compact as a spaceship kitchen--as a matter of\nfact, designed almost identically from models on the Moon run--the\ngalley had but three feet of open counter space. Everything else,\nsink, range, oven and freezer, were built-ins with pull-downs for use\nas needed. He set his bags on the small counter to put away after the\npre-start check. Aft of the galley and on the same side of the\npassageway were the double-decked bunks for the patrol troopers.\nAcross the passageway was a tiny latrine and shower. Clay tossed his\nhelmet on the lower bunk as he went down the passageway. At the\nbulkhead to the rear, he pressed a wall panel and a thick, insulated\ndoor slid back to admit him to the engine compartment. The service\ncrews had shut down the big power plants and turned off the air\nexchangers and already the heat from the massive engines made the\ncompartment uncomfortably warm.\n\nHe hurried through into a small machine shop. In an emergency, the\ntroopers could turn out small parts for disabled vehicles or for other\nuses. It also stocked a good supply of the most common failure parts.\nRacked against the ceiling were banks of cutting torches, a grim\nreminder that death or injury still rode the thruways with increasing\nfrequency.\n\nIn the tank storage space between the ceiling and top of the hull were\nthe chemical fire-fighting liquids and foam that could be applied by\nnozzles, hoses and towers now telescoped into recesses in the hull.\nAlong both sides and beneath the galley, bunks, engine and\nmachine-shop compartments between the walls, deck and hull, were\nBeulah's fuel storage tanks.\n\nThe last after compartment was a complete dispensary, one that would\nhave made the emergency room or even the light surgery rooms of\nearlier-day hospitals proud.\n\nClay tapped on the door and went through. Medical-Surgical Officer\nKelly Lightfoot was sitting on the deck, stowing sterile bandage packs\ninto a lower locker. She looked up at Clay and smiled. \"Well, well,\nyou DID manage to tear yourself away from your adoring bevies,\" she\nsaid. She flicked back a wisp of golden-red hair from her forehead and\nstood up. The patrol-blue uniform coverall with its belted waist\ndidn't do much to hide a lovely, properly curved figure. She walked\nover to the tall Canadian trooper and reached up and grabbed his ear.\nShe pulled his head down, examined one side critically and then\nquickly snatched at his other ear and repeated the scrutiny. She let\ngo of his ear and stepped back. \"Damned if you didn't get all the\nlipstick marks off, too.\"\n\nClay flushed. \"Cut it out, Kelly,\" he said. \"Sometimes you act just\nlike my mother.\"\n\nThe olive-complexioned redhead grinned at him and turned back to her\nstack of boxes on the deck. She bent over and lifted one of the boxes\nto the operating table. Clay eyed her trim figure. \"You might act like\nma sometimes,\" he said, \"but you sure don't look like her.\"\n\nIt was the Irish-Cherokee Indian girl's turn to flush. She became very\nbusy with the contents of the box. \"Where's Ben?\" she asked over her\nshoulder.\n\n\"Making outside check. You about finished in here?\"\n\nKelly turned and slowly scanned the confines of the dispensary. With\nthe exception of the boxes on the table and floor, everything was\nbehind secured locker doors. In one corner, the compact\ndiagnostician--capable of analyzing many known human bodily ailments\nand every possible violent injury to the body--was locked in its\nriding clamps. Surgical trays and instrument racks were all hidden\nbehind locker doors along with medical and surgical supplies. On\neither side of the emergency ramp door at the stern of the vehicle,\nthree collapsible autolitters hung from clamps. Six hospital bunks in\ntwo tiers of three each, lined another wall. On patrol, Kelly utilized\none of the hospital bunks for her own use except when they might all\nbe occupied with accident or other kind of patients. And this would\nnever be for more than a short period, just long enough to transfer\nthem to a regular ambulance or hospital vehicle. Her meager supply of\npersonal items needed for the ten-day patrol were stowed in a small\nlocker and she shared the latrine with the male members of the team.\n\nKelly completed her scan, glanced down at the checklist in her hand.\n\"I'll have these boxes stowed in five minutes. Everything else is\nsecure.\" She raised her hand to her forehead in mock salute.\n\"Medical-Surgical Officer Lightfoot reports dispensary ready for\npatrol, sir.\"\n\nClay smiled and made a checkmark on his clipboard. \"How was the\nseminar, Kelly?\" he asked.\n\nKelly hiked herself onto the edge of the operating table. \"Wonderful,\nClay, just wonderful. I never saw so many good-looking, young, rich\nand eligible doctors together in one place in all my life.\"\n\nShe sighed and smiled vacantly into space.\n\nClay snorted. \"I thought you were supposed to be learning something\nnew about tissue regeneration,\" he said.\n\n\"Generation, regeneration, who cares,\" Kelly grinned.\n\nClay started to say something, got flustered and wheeled around to\nleave--and bounded right off Ben Martin's chest. Ferguson mumbled\nsomething and pushed past the older officer.\n\nBen looked after him and then turned back to Car 56's combination\ndoctor, surgeon and nurse. \"Glad to see the hostess aboard for this\ncruise. I hope you make the passengers more comfortable than you've\njust made the first mate. What did you do to Clay, Kelly?\"\n\n\"Hi, Ben,\" Kelly said. \"Oh, don't worry about junior. He just gets all\nfluttery when a girl takes away his masculine prerogative to make\ncleverly lewd witticisms. He'll be all right. Have a happy holiday,\nBen? You look positively fat.\"\n\nBen patted his stomach. \"Carol's good cooking. Had a nice restful\ntime. And how about you. That couldn't have been all work. You've got\na marvelous tan.\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" Kelly laughed, \"I had no intention of letting it be all\nstudy. I spent just about as much time under the sun dome at the pool\nas I did in class. I learned a lot though.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBen grinned and headed back to the front of the car. \"Tell me more\nafter we're on the road,\" he said from the doorway. \"We'll be rolling\nin ten minutes.\"\n\nWhen he reached the cab, Clay was already in the right-hand control\nseat and was running down the instrument panel check. The sergeant\nlifted the hatch door between the two control seats and punched on a\nlight to illuminate the stark compartment at the lower front end of\nthe car. A steel grill with a dogged handle on the upper side covered\nthe opening under the hatch cover. Two swing-down bunks were racked up\nagainst the walls on either side and the front hull door was without\nan inside handle. This was the patrol car brig, used for bringing in\nunwilling violators or other violent or criminal subjects who might\ncrop up in the course of a patrol tour. Satisfied with the appearance\nof the brig, Ben closed the hatch cover and slid into his own control\nseat on the left of the cab. Both control seats were molded and\nplastiformed padded to the contours of the troopers and the armrests\non both were studded with buttons and a series of small,\nfinger-operated, knobs. All drive, communication and fire fighting\ncontrols for the massive vehicle were centered in the knobs and\nbuttons on the seat arms, while acceleration and braking controls were\nduplicated in two footrest pedals beneath their feet.\n\nBen settled into his seat and glanced down to make sure his\nwork-helmet was racked beside him. He reached over and flipped a bank\nof switches on the instrument panel. \"All communications to 'on,'\" he\nsaid. Clay made a checkmark on his list. \"All pre-engine start check\ncomplete,\" Clay replied.\n\n\"In that case,\" the senior trooper said, \"let's give Beulah some\nexercise. Start engines.\"\n\nClay's fingers danced across the array of buttons on his seat arms and\nflicked lightly at the throttle knobs. From deep within the engine\ncompartment came the muted, shrill whine of the starter engines,\nfollowed a split-second later by the full-throated roar of the jets as\nthey caught fire. Clay eased the throttles back and the engine noise\nsoftened to a muffled roar.\n\nMartin fingered a press-panel on the right arm of his seat.\n\n\"Car 56 to Philly Control,\" Ben called.\n\nThe speakers mounted around the cab came to life. \"Go ahead Five Six.\"\n\n\"Five Six fired up and ready to roll,\" Martin said.\n\n\"Affirmative Five Six,\" came the reply, \"You're clear to roll. Philly\nCheck estimates white density 300; green, 840; blue 400; yellow, 75.\"\n\nBoth troopers made mental note of the traffic densities in their first\none-hundred-mile patrol segment; an estimated three hundred vehicles\nfor each ten miles of thruway in the white or fifty to one hundred\nmiles an hour low lane; eight hundred forty vehicles in the one\nhundred to one hundred fifty miles an hour green, and so on. More than\nsixteen thousand westbound vehicles on the thruway in the first one\nhundred miles; nearly five thousand of them traveling at speeds\nbetween one hundred fifty and three hundred miles an hour.\n\nOver the always-hot intercom throughout the big car Ben called out.\n\"All set, Kelly?\"\n\n\"I'm making coffee,\" Kelly answered from the galley. \"Let 'er roll.\"\n\nMartin started to kick off the brakes, then stopped. \"Ooops,\" he\nexclaimed, \"almost forgot.\" His finger touched another button and a\nblaring horn reverberated through the vehicle.\n\nIn the galley, Kelly hurled herself into a corner. Her body activated\na pressure plant and a pair of mummy-like plastifoam plates slid\ncurvingly out the wall and locked her in a soft cocoon. A dozen\nsimilar safety clamps were located throughout the car at every working\nand relaxation station.\n\nIn the same instance, both Ben and Clay touched another plate on their\ncontrol seats. From kiosk-type columns behind each seat, pairs of\nbody-molded crash pads snapped into place to encase both troopers in\ntheir seats, their bodies cushioned and locked into place. Only their\nfingers were loose beneath the spongy substance to work arm controls.\nThe half-molds included headforms with a padded band that locked\nacross their foreheads to hold their heads rigidly against the backs\nof their reinforced seats. The instant all three crew members were\nlocked into their safety gear, the bull horn ceased.\n\n\"All tight,\" Ben called out as he wiggled and tried to free himself\nfrom the cocoon. Kelly and Clay tested their harnesses.\n\nSatisfied that the safety cocoons were operating properly, Ben\nreleased them and the molds slid back into their recesses. The cocoons\nwere triggered automatically in any emergency run or chase at speeds\nin excess of two hundred miles an hour.\n\nAgain he kicked off the brakes, pressed down on the foot feed and Car\n56--Beulah--rolled out of the Philadelphia motor pool on the start of\nits ten-day patrol.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe motor pool exit opened into a quarter-mile wide tunnel sloping\ngently down into the bowels of the great city. Car 56 glided down the\nslight incline at a steady fifty miles an hour. A mile from the mouth\nof the tunnel the roadway leveled off and Ben kicked Beulah up another\ntwenty-five miles an hour. Ahead, the main tunnel ended in a series of\nsmaller portal ways, each emblazoned with a huge illuminated number\ndesignating a continental thruway.\n\nBen throttled back and began edging to the left lanes. Other patrol\ncars were heading down the main passageway, bound for their assigned\nthruways. As Ben eased down to a slow thirty, another patrol vehicle\nslid alongside. The two troopers in the cab waved. Clay flicked on the\n\"car-to-car\" transmit.\n\nThe senior trooper in Car 104 looked over at Martin and Ferguson. \"If\nit isn't the gruesome twosome,\" he called. \"Where have you two been?\nWe thought the front office had finally caught up with you and found\nout that neither one of you could read or write and that they had\ncanned you.\"\n\n\"We can't read,\" Ben quipped back. \"That's why we're still on the job.\nThe front office would never hire anyone who would embarrass you two\nby being smarter than either of you. Where're you headed, Eddie?\"\n\n\"Got 154-north,\" the other officer said.\n\n\"Hey,\" Clay called out, \"I've got a real hot doll in Toronto and I'll\ngladly sell her phone number for a proper price.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't want to hurt you, Clay,\" the other officer replied. \"If I\ncalled her up and took her out, she'd throw rocks at you the next time\nyou drew the run. It's all for your own good.\"\n\n\"Oh, go get lost in a cloverleaf,\" Clay retorted.\n\nThe other car broke the connection and with a wave, veered off to the\nright. The thruway entrances were just ahead. Martin aimed Beulah at\nthe lighted orifice topped by the number 26-W. The patrol car slid\ninto the narrower tunnel, glided along for another mile and then\nturned its bow upwards. Three minutes later, they emerged from the\ntunnel into the red patrol lane of Continental Thruway 26-West. The\nlate afternoon sky was a covering of gray wool and a drop or two of\nmoisture struck the front face of the cab canopy. For a mile on either\nside of the police lane, streams of cars sped westward. Ben eyed the\nsky, the traffic and then peered at the outer hull thermometer. It\nread thirty-two degrees. He made a mental bet with himself that the\nweather bureau was off on its snow estimates by six hours. His Vermont\nupbringing told him it would be flurrying within the hour.\n\nHe increased speed to a steady one hundred and the car sped silently\nand easily along the police lane. Across the cab, Clay peered\npensively at the steady stream of cars and cargo carriers racing by in\nthe green and blue lanes--all of them moving faster than the patrol\ncar.\n\nThe young officer turned in his seat and looked at his partner.\n\n\"You know, Ben,\" he said gravely, \"I sometimes wonder if those\nold-time cowboys got as tired looking at the south end of northbound\ncows as I get looking at the vanishing tail pipes of cars.\"\n\nThe radio came to life.\n\n\"Philly Control to Car 56.\"\n\nClay touched his transmit plate. \"This is Five Six. Go ahead.\"\n\n\"You've got a bad one at Marker 82,\" Control said. \"A sideswipe in the\nwhite.\"\n\n\"Couldn't be too bad in the white,\" Ben broke in, thinking of the\none-hundred mile-an-hour limit in the slow lane.\n\n\"That's not the problem,\" Control came back. \"One of the sideswiped\nvehicles was flipped around and bounded into the green, and that's\nwhere the real mess is. Make it code three.\"\n\n\"Five Six acknowledge,\" Ben said. \"On the way.\"\n\nHe slammed forward on the throttles. The bull horn blared and a second\nlater, with MSO Kelly Lightfoot snugged in her dispensary cocoon and\nboth troopers in body cushions, Car 56 lifted a foot from the roadway,\nand leaped forward on a turbulent pad of air. It accelerated from one\nhundred to two hundred fifty miles an hour.\n\nThe great red emergency lights on the bow and stern began to blink and\nfrom the special transmitter in the hull a radio siren wail raced\nahead of the car to be picked up by the emergency receptor antennas\nrequired on all vehicles.\n\nThe working part of the patrol had begun.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nConversation died in the speeding car, partly because of the\nconcentration required by the troopers, secondly because all\ntransmissions whether intercom or radio, on a code two or three run,\nwere taped and monitored by Control. In the center of the instrument\npanel, an oversized radiodometer was clicking off the mileage marks as\nthe car passed each milestone. The milestone posts beamed a coded\nsignal across all five lanes and as each vehicle passed the marker,\nthe radiodometer clicked up another number.\n\nCar 56 had been at MM 23 when the call came. Now, at better than four\nmiles a minute, Beulah whipped past MM 45 with ten minutes yet to go\nto reach the scene of the accident. Light flurries of wet snow bounced\noff the canopy, leaving thin, fast-drying trails of moisture. Although\nit was still a few minutes short of 1700 hours, the last of the winter\nafternoon light was being lost behind the heavy snow clouds overhead.\nBen turned on the patrol car's dazzling headlight and to the left and\nright, Clay could see streaks of white lights from the traffic on the\ngreen and blue lanes on either side of the quarter-mile wide emergency\nlane.\n\nThe radio filled them in on the movement of other patrol emergency\nvehicles being routed to the accident site. Car 82, also assigned to\nNAT 26-West, was more than one hundred fifty miles ahead of Beulah.\nPittsburgh Control ordered Eight Two to hold fast to cover anything\nelse that might come up while Five Six was handling the current\ncrisis. Eastbound Car 119 was ordered to cut across to the scene to\nassist Beulah's crew, and another eastbound patrol vehicle was held in\nplace to cover for One One Nine.\n\nAt mile marker 80, yellow caution lights were flashing on all\nwestbound lanes, triggered by Philadelphia Control the instant the\nword of the crash had been received. Traffic was slowing down and\npiling up despite the half-mile wide lanes.\n\n\"Philly Control this is Car 56.\"\n\n\"Go ahead Five Six.\"\n\n\"It's piling up in the green and white,\" Ben said. \"Let's divert to\nblue on slowdown and seal the yellow.\"\n\n\"Philly Control acknowledged,\" came the reply.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe flashing amber caution lights on all lanes switched to red. As Ben\nbegan de-acceleration, diagonal red flashing barriers rose out of the\nroadway on the green and white lanes at the 85 mile marker and lane\ncrossing. This channelled all traffic from both lanes to the left and\ninto the blue lane where the flashing reds now prohibited speeds in\nexcess of fifty miles an hour around the emergency situation. At the\nsame time, all crossovers on the ultra high yellow lane were sealed by\nbarriers to prevent changing of lanes into the over-congested area.\n\nAs Car 56's speed dropped back below the two hundred mile an hour mark\nthe cocoon automatically slid open. Freed from her safety restraints,\nKelly jumped for the rear entrance of the dispensary and cleared the\nracking clamps from the six autolitters. That done, she opened another\nlocker and reached for the mobile first-aid kit. She slid it to the\ndoor entrance on its retractable casters. She slipped on her work\nhelmet with the built-in transmitter and then sat down on the seat by\nthe rear door to wait until the car stopped.\n\nCar 56 was now less than two miles from the scene of the crash and\ntraffic in the green lane to the left was at a standstill. A half mile\nfarther westward, lights were still moving slowly along the white\nlane. Ahead, the troopers could see a faint wisp of smoke rising from\nthe heaviest congregation of headlights. Both officers had their work\nhelmets on and Clay had left his seat and descended to the side door,\nready to jump out the minute the car stopped.\n\nMartin saw a clear area in the green lane and swung the car over the\ndividing curbing. The big tracks floated the patrol car over the\ntwo-foot high, rounded abutment that divided each speed lane. Snow was\nfalling faster as the headlight picked out a tangled mass of wreckage\nsmoldering a hundred feet inside the median separating the green and\nwhite lanes. A crumpled body lay on the pavement twenty feet from the\nbiggest clump of smashed metal, and other fragments of vehicles were\nstrung out down the roadway for fifty feet. There was no movement.\n\nNorCon thruway laws were strict and none were more rigidly enforced\nthan the regulation that no one other than a member of the patrol set\nfoot outside of their vehicle while on any thruway traffic lane. This\nmeant not giving any assistance whatsoever to accident victims. The\nruling had been called inhuman, monstrous, unthinkable, and lawmakers\nin the three nations of the compact had forced NorCon to revoke the\nrule in the early days of the thruways. After speeding cars and cargo\ncarriers had cut down twice as many do-gooders on foot at accident\nscenes than the accidents themselves caused, the law was reinstated.\nThe lives of the many were more vital than the lives of a few.\n\nMartin halted the patrol vehicle a few feet from the wreckage and\nBeulah was still rocking gently on her tracks by the time both Patrol\nTrooper Clay Ferguson and MSO Kelly Lightfoot hit the pavement on the\nrun.\n\nIn the cab, Martin called in on the radio. \"Car 56 is on scene.\nRelease blue at Marker 95 and resume speeds all lanes at Marker 95\nin--\" he paused and looked back at the halted traffic piled up before\nthe lane had been closed \"--seven minutes.\" He jumped for the steps\nand sprinted out of the patrol car in the wake of Ferguson and Kelly.\n\nThe team's surgeon was kneeling beside the inert body on the road.\nAfter an ear to the chest, Kelly opened her field kit bag and slapped\nan electrode to the victim's temple. The needle on the encephalic\nmeter in the lid of the kit never flickered. Kelly shut the bag and\nhurried with it over to the mass of wreckage. A thin column of black,\noily smoke rose from somewhere near the bottom of the heap. It was\nalmost impossible to identify at a glance whether the mangled metal\nwas the remains of one or more cars. Only the absence of track\nequipment made it certain that they even had been passenger vehicles.\n\nClay was carefully climbing up the side of the piled up wrecks to a\nwindow that gaped near the top.\n\n\"Work fast, kid,\" Martin called up. \"Something's burning down there\nand this whole thing may go up. I'll get this traffic moving.\"\n\nHe turned to face the halted mass of cars and cargo carriers east of\nthe wreck. He flipped a switch that cut his helmet transmitter into\nthe remote standard vehicular radio circuit aboard the patrol car.\n\n\"Attention, please, all cars in green lane. All cars in the left line\nmove out now, the next line fall in behind. You are directed to clear\nthe area immediately. Maintain fifty miles an hour for the next mile.\nYou may resume desired speeds and change lanes at mile Marker 95. I\nrepeat, all cars in green lane....\" he went over the instructions once\nmore, relayed through Beulah's transmitter to the standard receivers\non all cars. He was still talking as the traffic began to move.\n\nBy the time he turned back to help his teammates, cars were moving in\na steady stream past the huge, red-flashing bulk of the patrol car.\n\nBoth Clay and Kelly were lying flat across the smashed, upturned side\nof the uppermost car in the pile. Kelly had her field bag open on the\nground and she was reaching down through the smashed window.\n\n\"What is it Clay?\" Martin called.\n\nThe younger officer looked down over his shoulder. \"We've got a woman\nalive down here but she's wedged in tight. She's hurt pretty badly and\nKelly's trying to slip a hypo into her now. Get the arm out, Ben.\"\n\nMartin ran back to the patrol car and flipped up a panel on the hull.\nHe pulled back on one of the several levers recessed into the hull and\nthe big wrecking crane swung smoothly out of its cradle and over the\nwreckage. The end of the crane arm was directly over Ferguson. \"Lemme\nhave the spreaders,\" Clay called. The arm dipped and from either side\nof the tip, a pair of flanges shot out like tusks on an elephant. \"Put\n'er in neutral,\" Clay directed. Martin pressed another lever and the\ncrane now could be moved in any direction by fingertip pulls at its\nextremity. Ferguson carefully guided the crane with its projecting\ntusks into the smashed orifice of the car window. \"O.K., Ben, spread\nit.\"\n\nThe crane locked into position and the entire arm split open in a \"V\"\nfrom its base. Martin pressed steadily on the two levers controlling\neach side of the divided arm and the tusks dug into the sides of the\nsmashed window. There was a steady screeching of tearing and ripping\nmetal as the crane tore window and frame apart. \"Hold it,\" Ferguson\nyelled and then eased himself into the widened hole.\n\n\"Ben,\" Kelly called from her perch atop the wreckage, \"litter.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMartin raced to the rear of the patrol car where the sloping ramp\nstood open to the lighted dispensary. He snatched at one of the\nautolitters and triggered its tiny drive motor. A homing beacon in his\nhelmet guided the litter as it rolled down the ramp, turned by itself\nand rolled across the pavement a foot behind him. It stopped when he\nstopped and Ben touched another switch, cutting the homing beacon.\n\nClay's head appeared out of the hole. \"Get it up here, Ben. I can get\nher out. And I think there's another one alive still further down.\"\n\nMartin raised the crane and its ripper bars retracted. The split arms\nspewed a pair of cables terminating in magnalocks. The cables dangled\nover the ends of the autolitter, caught the lift plates on the litter\nand a second later, the cart was swinging beside the smashed window as\nClay and Kelly eased the torn body of a woman out of the wreckage and\nonto the litter. As Ben brought the litter back to the pavement, the\ncolumn of smoke had thickened. He disconnected the cables and homed\nthe stretcher back to the patrol car. The hospital cart with its\nunconscious victim, rolled smoothly back to the car, up the ramp and\ninto the dispensary to the surgical table.\n\nMartin climbed up the wreckage beside Kelly. Inside the twisted\ninterior of the car, the thick smoke all but obscured the bent back of\nthe younger trooper and his powerful handlight barely penetrated the\ngloom. Blood was smeared over almost every surface and the stink of\nleaking jet fuel was virtually overpowering. From the depths of the\nnightmarish scene came a tortured scream. Kelly reached into a\ncoverall pocket and produced another sedation hypo. She squirmed\naround and started to slip down into the wreckage with Ferguson.\nMartin grabbed her arm. \"No, Kelly, this thing's ready to blow. Come\non, Clay, get out of there. Now!\"\n\nFerguson continued to pry at the twisted plates below him.\n\n\"I said 'get out of there' Ferguson,\" the senior officer roared. \"And\nthat's an order.\"\n\nClay straightened up and put his hands on the edge of the window to\nboost himself out. \"Ben, there's a guy alive down there. We just can't\nleave him.\"\n\n\"Get down from there, Kelly,\" Martin ordered. \"I know that man's down\nthere just as well as you do, Clay. But we won't be helping him one\ndamn bit if we get blown to hell and gone right along with him. Now\nget outta there and maybe we can pull this thing apart and get to him\nbefore it does blow.\"\n\nThe lanky Canadian eased out of the window and the two troopers moved\nback to the patrol car. Kelly was already in her dispensary, working\non the injured woman.\n\nMartin slid into his control seat. \"Shut your ramp, Kelly,\" he called\nover the intercom, \"I'm going to move around to the other side.\"\n\nThe radio broke in. \"Car 119 to Car 56, we're just turning into the\ndivider. Be there in a minute.\"\n\n\"Snap it up,\" Ben replied. \"We need you in a hurry.\"\n\nAs he maneuvered Beulah around the wreckage he snapped orders to\nFerguson.\n\n\"Get the foam nozzles up, just in case, and then stand by on the\ncrane.\"\n\nA mile away, they saw the flashing emergency lights of Car 119 as it\nraced diagonally across the yellow and blue lanes, whipping with\nponderous ease through the moving traffic.\n\n\"Take the south side, 119,\" Martin called out. \"We'll try and pull\nthis mess apart.\"\n\n\"Affirmative,\" came the reply. Even before the other patrol vehicle\ncame to a halt, its crane was swinging out from the side, and the\nganged magnalocks were dangling from their cables.\n\n\"O.K., kid,\" Ben ordered, \"hook it.\"\n\nAt the interior crane controls, Clay swung Beulah's crane and cable\nmags towards the wreckage. The magnalocks slammed into the metallic\nmess with a bang almost at the same instant the locks hit the other\nside from Car 119.\n\nClay eased up the cable slack. \"Good,\" Ben called to both Clay and the\noperating trooper in the other car, \"now let's pull it ... LOOK OUT!\nFOAM ... FOAM ... FOAM,\" he yelled.\n\nThe ugly, deep red fireball from the exploding wreckage was still\ngrowing as Clay slammed down on the fire-control panel. A curtain of\nthick chemical foam burst from the poised nozzles atop Beulah's hull\nand a split-second later, another stream of foam erupted from the\nother patrol car. The dense, oxygen-absorbing retardant blanket\nsnuffed the fire out in three seconds. The cranes were still secured\nto the foam-covered heap of metal. \"Never mind the caution,\" Ben\ncalled out, \"get it apart. Fast.\"\n\nBoth crane operators slammed their controls into reverse and with an\near-splitting screech, the twisted frames of the two vehicles ripped\napart into tumbled heaps of broken metal and plastics. Martin and\nFerguson jumped down the hatch steps and into ankle-deep foam and oil.\nThey waded and slipped around the front of the car to join the\ntroopers from the other car.\n\nFerguson was pawing at the scum-covered foam near the mangled section\nof one of the cars. \"He should be right about,\" Clay paused and bent\nover, \"here.\" He straightened up as the others gathered around the\nscorched and ripped body of a man, half-submerged in the thick foam.\n\"Kelly,\" he called over the helmet transmitter, \"open your door. We'll\nneed a couple of sacks.\"\n\nHe trudged to the rear of the patrol car and met the girl standing in\nthe door with a pair of folded plastic morgue bags in her hands.\nBehind her, Clay could see the body of the woman on the surgical\ntable, an array of tubes and probes leading to plasma drip bottles and\nother equipment racked out over the table.\n\n\"How is she?\"\n\n\"Not good,\" Kelly replied. \"Skull fracture, ruptured spleen, broken\nribs and double leg fractures. I've already called for an ambulance.\"\n\nFerguson nodded, took the bags from her and waded back through the\nfoam.\n\nThe four troopers worked in the silence of the deserted traffic lane.\nA hundred yards away, traffic was moving steadily in the slow white\nlane. Three-quarters of a mile to the south, fast and ultra high\ntraffic sped at its normal pace in the blue and yellow lanes.\nWestbound green was still being rerouted into the slower white lane,\naround the scene of the accident. It was now twenty-six minutes since\nCar 56 had received the accident call. The light snow flurries had\nturned to a steady fall of thick wet flakes, melting as they hit on\nthe warm pavement but beginning to coat the pitiful flotsam of the\naccident.\n\nThe troopers finished the gruesome task of getting the bodies into the\nmorgue sacks and laid beside the dispensary ramp for the ambulance to\npick up with the surviving victim. Car 119's MSO had joined Kelly in\nBeulah's dispensary to give what help she might. The four patrol\ntroopers began the grim task of probing the scattered wreckage for\nother possible victims, personal possessions and identification. They\nwere stacking a small pile of hand luggage when the long, low bulk of\nthe ambulance swung out of the police lane and rolled to a stop.\nLonger than the patrol cars but without the non-medical emergency\nfacilities, the ambulance was in reality a mobile hospital. A full,\nscrubbed-up surgical team was waiting in the main operating room even\nas the ramps opened and the techs headed for Car 56. The team had been\nbriefed by radio on the condition of the patient; had read the full\nrecordings of the diagnostician; and were watching transmitted pulse\nand respiration graphs on their own screens while the transfer was\nbeing made.\n\nThe two women MSOs had unlocked the surgical table in Beulah's\ndispensary and a plastic tent covered not only the table and the\npatient, but also the plasma and Regen racks overhead. The entire\ntable and rig slid down the ramp onto a motor-driven dolly from the\nambulance. Without delay, it wheeled across the open few feet of\npavement into the ambulance and to the surgery room. The techs locked\nthe table into place in the other vehicle and left the surgery. From a\nstorage compartment, they wheeled out a fresh patrol dispensary table\nand rack and placed it in Kelly's miniature surgery. The dead went\ninto the morgue aboard the ambulance, the ramp closed and the\nambulance swung around and headed across the traffic lanes to\neastbound NAT-26 and Philadelphia.\n\nOutside, the four troopers had completed the task of collecting what\nlittle information they could from the smashed vehicles.\n\nThey returned to their cars and One One Nine's medical-surgical\nofficer headed back to her own cubby-hole.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe other patrol car swung into position almost touching Beulah's left\nflank. With Ben at the control seat, on command, both cars extended\nbroad bulldozer blades from their bows. \"Let's go,\" Ben ordered. The\ntwo patrol vehicles moved slowly down the roadway, pushing all of the\nscattered scraps and parts onto a single great heap. They backed off,\nshifted direction towards the center police lane and began shoving the\ndebris, foam and snow out of the green lane. At the edge of the police\nlane, both cars unshipped cranes and magnalifted the junk over the\ndivider barrier onto the one-hundred-foot-wide service strip bordering\nthe police lane. A slow cargo wrecker was already on the way from\nPittsburgh barracks to pick up the wreckage and haul it away. When the\nlast of the metallic debris had been deposited off the traffic lane,\nMartin called Control.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Car 56 is clear. NAT 26-west green is clear.\"\n\nPhilly Control acknowledged. Seven miles to the east, the amber\nwarning lights went dark and the detour barrier at Crossover 85 sank\nback into the roadway. Three minutes later, traffic was again flashing\nby on green lane past the two halted patrol cars.\n\n\"Pitt Control, this is Car 119 clear of accident,\" the other car\nreported.\n\n\"Car 119 resume eastbound patrol,\" came the reply.\n\nThe other patrol car pulled away. The two troopers waved at Martin and\nFerguson in Beulah. \"See you later and thanks,\" Ben called out. He\nswitched to intercom. \"Kelly. Any ID on that woman?\"\n\n\"Not a thing, Ben,\" she replied. \"About forty years old, and she had a\nwedding band. She never was conscious, so I can't help you.\"\n\nBen nodded and looked over at his partner. \"Go get into some dry\nclothes, kid,\" he said, \"while I finish the report. Then you can take\nit for a while.\"\n\nClay nodded and headed back to the crew quarters.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBen racked his helmet beside his seat and fished out a cigarette. He\nreached for an accident report form from the work rack behind his seat\nand began writing, glancing up from time to time to gaze thoughtfully\nat the scene of the accident. When he had finished, he thumbed the\nradio transmitter and called Philly Control. Somewhere in the bloody,\noil and foam covered pile of wreckage were the registration plates for\nthe two vehicles involved. When the wrecker collected the debris, it\nwould be machine sifted in Pittsburgh and the plates fed to records\nand then relayed to Philadelphia where the identifications could be\nadded to Ben's report. When he had finished reading his report he\nasked, \"How's the woman?\"\n\n\"Still alive, but just barely,\" Philly Control answered. \"Ben, did you\nsay there were just two vehicles involved?\"\n\n\"That's all we found,\" Martin replied.\n\n\"And were they both in the green?\"\n\n\"Yes, why?\"\n\n\"That's funny,\" Philly controller replied, \"we got the calls as a\nsideswipe in white that put one of the cars over into the green. There\nshould have been a third vehicle.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Ben exclaimed. \"We were so busy trying to get that gal\nout and then making the try for the other man I never even thought to\nlook for another car. You suppose that guy took off?\"\n\n\"It's possible,\" the controller said. \"I'm calling a gate filter until\nwe know for sure. I've got the car number on the driver that reported\nthe accident. I'll get hold of him and see if he can give us a lead on\nthe third car. You go ahead with your patrol and I'll let you know\nwhat I find out.\"\n\n\"Affirmative,\" Ben replied. He eased the patrol car onto the police\nlane and turned west once again. Clay reappeared in the cab, dressed\nin fresh coveralls. \"I'll take it, Ben. You go and clean up now.\nKelly's got a pot of fresh coffee in the galley.\" Ferguson slid into\nhis control seat.\n\nA light skiff of snow covered the service strip and the dividers as\nCar 56 swung back westward in the red lane. Snow was falling steadily\nbut melting as it touched the warm ferrophalt pavement in all lanes.\nThe wet roadways glistened with the lights of hundreds of vehicles.\nThe chronometer read 1840 hours. Clay pushed the car up to a steady\n75, just about apace with the slowest traffic in the white lane. To\nthe south, densities were much lighter in the blue and yellow lanes\nand even the green had thinned out. It would stay moderately light now\nfor another hour until the dinner stops were over and the night\ntravelers again rolled onto the thruways.\n\nKelly was putting frozen steaks into the infra-oven as Ben walked\nthrough to crew quarters. Her coverall sleeves were rolled to the\nelbows as she worked and a vagrant strand of copper hair curled over\nher forehead. As Martin passed by, he caught a faint whisper of\nperfume and he smiled appreciatively.\n\nIn the tiny crew quarters, he shut the door to the galley and stripped\nout of his wet coveralls and boots. He eyed the shower stall across\nthe passageway.\n\n\"Hey, mother,\" he yelled to Kelly, \"have I got time for a shower\nbefore dinner?\"\n\n\"Yes, but make it a quickie,\" she called back.\n\nFive minutes later he stepped into the galley, his dark, crew-cut hair\nstill damp. Kelly was setting plastic, disposable dishes on the little\nswing-down table that doubled as a food bar and work desk. Ben peered\ninto a simmering pot and sniffed. \"Smells good. What's for dinner,\nHiawatha?\"\n\n\"Nothing fancy. Steak, potatoes, green beans, apple pie and coffee.\"\n\nBen's mouth watered. \"You know, sometimes I wonder whether one of your\nancestors didn't come out of New England. Your menus always seem to\ncoincide with my ideas of a perfect meal.\" He noted the two places set\nat the table. Ben glanced out the galley port into the headlight-striped\ndarkness. Traffic was still light. In the distance, the night sky glowed\nwith the lights of Chambersburg, north of the thruway.\n\n\"We might as well pull up for dinner,\" he said. \"It's pretty slow out\nthere.\"\n\nKelly shoved dishes over and began laying out a third setting. About\nhalf the time on patrol, the crew ate in shifts on the go, with one of\nthe patrol troopers in the cab at all times. When traffic permitted,\nthey pulled off to the service strip and ate together. With the\ncommunications system always in service, control stations could reach\nthem anywhere in the big vehicle.\n\nThe sergeant stepped into the cab and tapped Ferguson on the shoulder.\n\"Dinnertime, Clay. Pull her over and we'll try some of your gracious\nliving.\"\n\n\"Light the candles and pour the wine,\" Clay quipped, \"I'll be with you\nin a second.\"\n\nCar 56 swung out to the edge of the police lane and slowed down. Clay\neased the car onto the strip and stopped. He checked the radiodometer\nand called in. \"Pitt Control, this is Car 56 at Marker 158. Dinner is\nbeing served in the dining car to the rear. Please do not disturb.\"\n\n\"Affirmative, Car 56,\" Pittsburgh Control responded. \"Eat heartily, it\nmay be going out of style.\" Clay grinned and flipped the radio to\nremote and headed for the galley.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeated around the little table, the trio cut into their steaks. Parked\nat the north edge of the police lane, the patrol car was just a few\nfeet from the green lane divider strip and cars and cargo carriers\nflashed by as they ate.\n\nClay chewed on a sliver of steak and looked at Kelly. \"I'd marry you,\nPocahontas, if you'd ever learn to cook steaks like beef instead of\ncuring them like your ancestral buffalo robes. When are you going to\nlearn that good beef has to be bloody to be edible?\"\n\nThe girl glared at him. \"If that's what it takes to make it edible,\nyou're going to be an epicurean delight in just about one second if I\nhear another word about my cooking. And that's also the second crack\nabout my noble ancestors in the past five minutes. I've always\nwondered about the surgical techniques my great-great-great grandpop\nused when he lifted a paleface's hair. One more word, Clay Ferguson,\nand I'll have your scalp flying from Beulah's antenna like a coontail\non a kid's scooter.\"\n\nBen bellowed and nearly choked. \"Hey, kid,\" he spluttered at Clay,\n\"ever notice how the wrong one of her ancestors keeps coming to the\nsurface? That was the Irish.\"\n\nClay polished off the last of his steak and reached for the individual\nfrozen pies Kelly had put in the oven with the steaks. \"Now that's\nanother point,\" he said, waving his fork at Kelly. \"The Irish lived so\nlong on potatoes and prayers that when they get a piece of meat on\ntheir menu, they don't know how to do anything but boil it.\"\n\n\"That tears it,\" the girl exploded. She pushed back from the table and\nstood up. \"I've cooked the last meal this big, dumb Canuck will ever\nget from me. I hope you get chronic indigestion and then come crawling\nto me for help. I've got something back there I've been wanting to\ndose you with for a long time.\"\n\nShe stormed out of the galley and slammed the door behind her. Ben\ngrinned at the stunned look on Clay's face. \"Now what got her on the\nwarpath?\" Clay asked. Before Ben could answer the radio speaker in the\nceiling came to life.\n\n\"Car 56 this is Pitt Control.\"\n\nMartin reached for the transmit switch beside the galley table. \"This\nis Five Six, go ahead.\"\n\n\"Relay from Philly Control,\" the speaker blared. \"Reference the\naccident at Marker 92 at 1648 hours this date; Philly Control reports\na third vehicle definitely involved.\"\n\nBen pulled out a pencil and Clay shoved a message pad across the\ntable.\n\n\"James J. Newhall, address 3409 Glen Cove Drive, New York City,\nlicense number BHT 4591 dash 747 dash 1609, was witness to the initial\nimpact. He reports that a white over green, late model Travelaire,\nwith two men in it, sideswiped one of the two vehicles involved in the\nfatal accident. The Travelaire did not stop but accelerated after the\nimpact. Newhall was unable to get the full license number but the\nfirst six units were QABR dash 46 ... rest of numerals unknown.\"\n\nBen cut in. \"Have we got identification on our fatalities yet?\"\n\n\"Affirmative, Five Six,\" the radio replied. \"The driver of the car\nstruck by the hit-and-run vehicle was a Herman Lawrence Hanover, age\nforty-two, of 13460 One Hundred Eighty-First Street South, Camden, New\nJersey, license number LFM 4151 dash 603 dash 2738. With him was his\nwife, Clara, age forty-one, same address. Driver of the green lane car\nwas George R. Hamilton, age thirty-five, address Box 493, Route 12,\nTucumcari, New Mexico.\"\n\nBen broke in once more. \"You indicate all three are fatalities. Is\nthis correct, Pitt Control? The woman was alive when she was\ntransferred to the ambulance.\"\n\n\"Stand by, Five Six, and I'll check.\"\n\nA moment later Pitt Control was back. \"That is affirmative, Five Six.\nThe woman died at 1745 hours. Here is additional information. A\nvehicle answering to the general description of the hit-and-run\nvehicle is believed to have been involved in an armed robbery and\nmultiple murder earlier this date at Wilmington, Delaware. Philly\nControl is now checking for additional details. Gate filters have been\nestablished on NAT 26-West from Marker-Exit 100 to Marker-Exit 700.\nAlso, filters on all interchanges. Pitt Control out.\"\n\nKelly Lightfoot, her not-too-serious peeve forgotten, had come back\ninto the galley to listen to the radio exchange. The men got up from\nthe table and Clay gathered the disposable dishware and tossed them\ninto the waste receiver.\n\n\"We'd better get rolling,\" Ben said, \"those clowns could still be on\nthe thruway, although they could have got off before the filters went\nup.\"\n\nThey moved to the cab and took their places. The big engines roared\ninto action as Ben rolled Car 56 back onto the police-way. Kelly\nfinished straightening up in the galley and then came forward to sit\non the jump seat between the two troopers. The snow had stopped again\nbut the roadways were still slick and glistening under the headlights.\nBeulah rolled steadily along on her broad tracks, now cruising at one\nhundred miles an hour. The steady whine of the cold night wind\npenetrated faintly into the sound-proofed and insulated cabin canopy.\nClay cut out the cabin lights, leaving only the instrument panel\nglowing faintly along with the phosphorescent buttons and knobs on the\narms of the control seats.\n\nA heavy express cargo carrier flashed by a quarter of a mile away in\nthe blue lane, its big bulk lit up like a Christmas tree with running\nand warning lights. To their right, Clay caught the first glimpse of a\nset of flashing amber warning lights coming up from behind in the\ngreen lane. A minute later, a huge cargo carrier came abreast of the\npatrol car and then pulled ahead. On its side was a glowing star of\nthe United States Army. A minute later, another Army carrier rolled\nby.\n\n\"That's the missile convoy out of Aberdeen,\" Clay told Kelly. \"I wish\nour hit-runner had tackled one of those babies. We'd have scraped him\nup instead of those other people.\"\n\nThe convoy rolled on past at a steady one hundred twenty-five miles\nan hour. Car 56 flashed under a crossover and into a long, gentle\ncurve. The chronometer clicked up to 2100 hours and the radio sang\nout. \"Cars 207, 56 and 82, this is Pitt Control. 2100 hours density\nreport follows....\"\n\nPittsburgh Control read off the figures for the three cars. Car 82 was\none hundred fifty miles ahead of Beulah, Car 207 about the same\ndistance to the rear. The density report ended and a new voice came on\nthe air.\n\n\"Attention all cars and all stations, this is Washington Criminal\nControl.\" The new voice paused, and across the continent, troopers on\nevery thruway, control station, checkpoint and relay block, reached\nfor clipboard and pen.\n\n\"Washington Criminal Control continuing, all cars and all stations,\nspecial attention to all units east of the Mississippi. At 1510 hours\nthis date, two men held up the First National Bank of Wilmington,\nDelaware, and escaped with an estimated one hundred seventy-five\nthousand dollars. A bank guard and two tellers, together with five\nbank customers were killed by these subjects using automatic weapon\nfire to make good their escape. They were observed leaving the scene\nin a late model, white-over-green Travelaire sedan, license unknown. A\ncar of the same make, model and color was stolen from Annapolis,\nMaryland, a short time prior to the holdup. The stolen vehicle, now\nbelieved to be the getaway car, bears USN license number QABR dash 468\ndash 1113....\"\n\n\"That's our baby,\" Ben murmured as he and Clay scribbled, on their\nmessage forms.\n\n\"... Motor number ZB 1069432,\" Washington Criminal Control continued.\n\"This car is also now believed to have been involved in a hit-and-run\nfatal accident on NAT 26-West at Marker 92 at approximately 1648 hours\nthis date.\n\n\"Subject Number One is described as WMA, twenty to twenty-five years,\nfive feet, eleven inches tall, medium complexion, dark hair and eyes,\nwearing a dark-gray sports jacket and dark pants, and wearing a gray\nsports cap. He was wearing a ring with a large red stone on his left\nhand.\n\n\"Subject Number Two is described as WMA, twenty to twenty-five years,\nsix feet, light, ruddy complexion and reddish brown hair, light\ncolored eyes. Has scar on back left side of neck. Wearing light-brown\nsuit, green shirt and dark tie, no hat.\n\n\"These subjects are believed to be armed and psychotically dangerous.\nIf observed, approach with extreme caution and inform nearest control\nof contact. Both subjects now under multiple federal warrants charging\nbank robbery, murder, and hit-and-run murder. All cars and stations\nacknowledge. Washington Criminal Control out.\"\n\nThe air chattered as the cars checked into their nearest controls with\n\"acknowledged.\"\n\n\"This looks like it could be a long night,\" Kelly said, rising to her\nfeet. \"I'm going to sack out. Call me if you need me.\"\n\n\"Good night, princess,\" Ben called.\n\n\"Hey, Hiawatha,\" Clay called out as Kelly paused in the galley door.\n\"I didn't mean what I said about your steaks. Your great-great-great\ngrandpop would have gone around with his bare scalp hanging out if he\nhad had to use a buffalo hide cured like that steak was cooked.\"\n\nHe reached back at the same instant and slammed the cabin door just as\nKelly came charging back. She slammed into the door, screamed and then\nwent storming back to the dispensary while Clay doubled over in\nlaughter.\n\nBen smiled at his junior partner. \"Boy, you're gonna regret that.\nDon't say I didn't warn you.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMartin turned control over to the younger trooper and relaxed in his\nseat to go over the APB from Washington. Car 56 bored steadily through\nthe night. The thruway climbed easily up the slight grade cut through\nthe hills north of Wheeling, West Virginia, and once more snow began\nfalling.\n\nClay reached over and flipped on the video scanners. Four small\nscreens, one for each of the westbound lanes, glowed with a soft red\nlight. The monitors were synchronized with the radiometer and changed\nview at every ten-mile marker. Viewing cameras mounted on towers\nbetween each lane, lined the thruway, aimed eastward at the on-coming\ntraffic back to the next bank of cameras ten miles away. Infra-red\ncircuits took over from standard scan at dark. A selector system in\nthe cars gave the troopers the option of viewing either the block they\nwere currently patrolling; the one ahead of the next ten-mile block;\nor, the one they had just passed. As a rule, the selection was based\non the speed of the car. Beamed signals from each block automatically\nswitched the view as the patrol car went past the towers. Clay put the\nslower lane screens on the block they were in, turned the blue and\nyellow lanes to the block ahead.\n\nThey rolled past the interchange with NAT 114-South out of Cleveland and\nthe traffic densities picked up in all lanes as many of the southbound\nvehicles turned west on to NAT 26. The screens flicked and Clay came alert.\nSome fifteen miles ahead in the one-hundred-fifty-to-two-hundred-mile an\nhour blue lane, a glowing dot remained motionless in the middle of the lane\nand the other racing lights of the blue lane traffic were sheering around\nit like a racing river current parting around a boulder.\n\n\"Trouble,\" he said to Martin, as he shoved forward on the throttle.\n\nA stalled car in the middle of the high-speed lane was an invitation\nto disaster. The bull horn blared as Beulah leaped past the two\nhundred mile an hour mark and safety cocoons slid into place. Aft in\nthe dispensary, Kelly was sealed into her bunk by a cocoon rolling out\nof the wall and encasing the hospital bed.\n\nCar 5 slanted across the police lane with red lights flashing and edged\ninto the traffic flow in the blue lane. The great, red winking lights\nand the emergency radio siren signal began clearing a path for the\ntroopers. Vehicles began edging to both sides of the lane to shift to\ncrossovers to the yellow or green lanes. Clay aimed Beulah at the\nmotionless dot on the screen and eased back from the four-mile-a-minute\nspeed. The patrol car slowed and the headlight picked up the stalled\nvehicle a mile ahead. The cocoons opened and Ben slipped on his work\nhelmet and dropped down the steps to the side hatch. Clay brought Beulah\nto a halt a dozen yards directly to the rear of the stalled car, the\ngreat bulk of the patrol vehicle with its warning lights serving as a\nshield against any possible fuzzy-headed speeders that might not be\nobserving the road.\n\nAs Martin reached for the door, the Wanted bulletin flashed through\nhis head. \"What make of car is that, Clay?\"\n\n\"Old jalopy Tritan with some souped-up rigs. Probably kids,\" the\njunior officer replied. \"It looks O.K.\"\n\nBen nodded and swung down out of the patrol car. He walked quickly to\nthe other car, flashing his handlight on the side of the vehicle as he\nwent up to the driver. The interior lights were on and inside, two\nobviously frightened young couples smiled with relief at the sight of\nthe uniform coveralls. A freckled-faced teenager in a dinner jacket\nwas in the driver's seat and had the blister window open. He grinned\nup at Martin. \"Boy, am I glad to see you, officer,\" he said.\n\n\"What's the problem?\" Ben asked.\n\n\"I guess she blew an impeller,\" the youth answered. \"We were heading\nfor a school dance at Cincinnati and she was boiling along like she\nwas in orbit when blooey she just quit.\"\n\nBen surveyed the old jet sedan. \"What year is this clunker?\" he asked.\nThe kid told him. \"You kids have been told not to use this lane for\nany vehicle that old.\" He waved his hand in protest as the youngster\nstarted to tell him how many modifications he had made on the car. \"It\ndoesn't make one bit of difference whether you've put a first-stage\nMoon booster on this wreck. It's not supposed to be in the blue or\nyellow. And this thing probably shouldn't have been allowed out of the\nwhite--or even on the thruway.\"\n\nThe youngster flushed and bit his lip in embarrassment at the giggles\nfrom the two evening-frocked girls in the car.\n\n\"Well, let's get you out of here.\" Ben touched his throat mike. \"Drop\na light, Clay and then let's haul this junk pile away.\"\n\nIn the patrol car, Ferguson reached down beside his seat and tugged at\na lever. From a recess in Beulah's stern, a big portable red warning\nlight dropped to the pavement. As it touched the surface, it\nautomatically flashed to life, sending out a bright, flashing red\nwarning signal into the face of any approaching traffic. Clay eased\nthe patrol car around the stalled vehicle and then backed slow into\nposition, guided by Martin's radioed instructions. A tow-bar extruded\nfrom the back of the police vehicle and a magnaclamp locked onto the\nfront end of the teenager's car. The older officer walked back to the\nportable warning light and rolled it on its four wheels to the rear\nplate of the jalopy where another magnalock secured it to the car.\nBeulah's two big rear warning lights still shone above the low\nsilhouette of the passenger car, along with the mobile lamp on the\njalopy. Martin walked back to the patrol car and climbed in.\n\nHe slid into his seat and nodded at Clay. The patrol car, with the\ndisabled vehicle in tow moved forward and slanted left towards the\npolice lane. Martin noted the mileage marker on the radiodometer and\nfingered the transmitter. \"Chillicothe Control this is Car 56.\"\n\n\"This Chillicothe. Go ahead Five Six.\"\n\n\"We picked up some kids in a stalled heap on the blue at Marker 382\nand we've got them in tow now,\" Ben said. \"Have a wrecker meet us and\ntake them off our hands.\"\n\n\"Affirmative, Five Six. Wrecker will pick you up at Marker 412.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nClay headed the patrol car and its trailed load into an emergency\nentrance to the middle police lane and slowly rolled westward. The\nsenior trooper reached into his records rack and pulled out a citation\nbook.\n\n\"You going to nail these kids?\" Clay asked.\n\n\"You're damn right I am,\" Martin replied, beginning to fill in the\nviolation report. \"I'd rather have this kid hurting in the pocketbook\nthan dead. If we turn him loose, he'll think he got away with it this\ntime and try it again. The next time he might not be so lucky.\"\n\n\"I suppose you're right,\" Clay said, \"but it does seem a little\nrough.\"\n\nBen swung around in his seat and surveyed his junior officer.\n\"Sometimes I think you spent four years in the patrol academy with\nyour head up your jet pipes,\" he said. He fished out another cigarette\nand took a deep drag.\n\n\"You've had four solid years of law; three years of electronics and\njet and air-drive engine mechanics and engineering; pre-med,\npsychology, math, English, Spanish and a smattering of Portuguese, to\nsay nothing of dozens of other subjects. You graduated in the upper\ntenth of your class with a B.S. in both Transportation and Criminology\nwhich is why you're riding patrol and not punching a computer or\ntinkering with an engine. You'd think with all that education that\nsomewhere along the line you'd have learned to think with your head\ninstead of your emotions.\"\n\nClay kept a studied watch on the roadway. The minute Ben had turned\nand swung his legs over the side of the seat and pulled out a\ncigarette, Clay knew that it was school time in Car 56. Instructor\nSergeant Ben Martin was in a lecturing mood. It was time for all good\npupils to keep their big, fat mouths shut.\n\n\"Remember San Francisco de Borja?\" Ben queried. Clay nodded. \"And you\nstill think I'm too rough on them?\" Ben pressed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nFerguson's memory went back to last year's fifth patrol. He and Ben\nwith Kelly riding hospital, had been assigned to NAT 200-North,\nrunning out of Villahermosa on the Guatemalan border of Mexico to\nEdmonton Barracks in Canada. It was the second night of the patrol.\nSome seven hundred fifty miles north of Mexico City, near the town of\nSan Francisco de Borja, a gang of teenage Mexican youngsters had gone\nroaring up the yellow at speeds touching on four hundred miles an\nhour. Their car, a beat-up, fifteen-year-old veteran of less speedy\nand much rockier local mountain roads, had been gimmicked by the kids\nso that it bore no resemblance to its original manufacture.\n\nFrom a junkyard they had obtained a battered air lift, smashed almost\nbeyond use in the crackup of a ten-thousand dollar sports cruiser. The\nkids pried, pounded and bent the twisted impeller lift blades back\ninto some semblance of alignment. From another wreck of a cargo\ncarrier came a pair of 4000-pound thrust engines. They had jury-rigged\nthe entire mess so that it stuck together on the old heap. Then they\nhit the thruway--nine of them packed into the jalopy--the oldest one\njust seventeen years old. They were doing three hundred fifty when\nthey flashed past the patrol car and Ben had roared off in pursuit.\nThe senior officer whipped the big patrol car across the crowded high\nspeed blue lane, jockeyed into the ultra-high yellow and then turned\non the power.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBy this time the kids realized they had been spotted and they cranked\ntheir makeshift power plant up to the last notch. The most they could\nget out of it was four hundred and it was doing just that as Car 56,\nclocking better than five hundred, pulled in behind them. The patrol\ncar was still three hundred yards astern when one of the bent and\nre-bent impeller blades let go. The out-of-balance fan, turning at\nclose to 35,000 rpm, flew to pieces and the air cushion vanished. At\nfour hundred miles an hour, the body of the old jalopy fell the twelve\ninches to the pavement and both front wheels caved under. There was a\nmomentary shower of sparks, then the entire vehicle snapped\ncartwheeling more than eighty feet into the air and exploded. Pieces\nof car and bodies were scattered for a mile down the thruway and the\nonly whole, identifiable human bodies were those of the three\nyoungsters thrown out and sent hurtling to their deaths more than two\nhundred feet away.\n\nClay's mind snapped back to the present.\n\n\"Write 'em up,\" he said quietly to Martin. The senior officer gave a\nSatisfied nod and turned back to his citation pad.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt marker 412, which was also the Columbus turnoff, a big patrol\nwrecker was parked on the side strip, engines idling, service and\nwarning lights blinking. Clay pulled the patrol car alongside and\nstopped. He disconnected the tow bar and the two officers climbed out\ninto the cold night air. They walked back to the teenager's car. Clay\nwent to the rear of the disabled car and unhooked the warning light\nwhile Martin went to the driver's window. He had his citation book in\nhand. The youngster in the driver's seat went white at the sight of\nthe violation pad. \"May I see your license, please,\" Ben asked. The\nboy fumbled in a back pocket and then produced a thin, metallic tab\nwith his name, age, address and license number etched into the\nindestructible and unalterable metal.\n\n\"Also your car registration,\" Ben added. The youth unclipped similar\nmetal strip from the dashboard.\n\nThe trooper took the two tabs and walked to the rear of the patrol\ncar. He slid back a panel to reveal two thin slots in the hull. Martin\nslid the driver's license into one of the slots, the registration tab\ninto the other. He pressed a button below each slot. Inside the car, a\nmagnetic reader and auto-transmitter \"scanned\" the magnetic symbols\nimplanted in the tags. The information was fed instantly to\nContinental Headquarters Records division at Colorado Springs. In\nfractions of a second, the great computers at Records were comparing\nthe information on the tags with all previous traffic citations issued\nanywhere in the North American continent in the past forty-five years\nsince the birth of the Patrol. The information from the driver's\nlicense and registration tab had been relayed from Beulah via the\nnearest patrol relay point. The answer came back the same way.\n\nAbove the license recording slot were two small lights. The first\nflashed green, \"license is in order and valid.\" The second flashed\ngreen as well, \"no previous citations.\" Ben withdrew the tag from the\nslot. Had the first light come on red, he would have placed the driver\nunder arrest immediately. Had the second light turned amber, it would\nhave indicated a previous minor violation. This, Ben would have noted\non the new citation. If the second light had been red, this would have\nmeant either a major previous violation or more than one minor\ncitation. Again, the driver would have been under immediate arrest.\nThe law was mandatory. One big strike and you're out--two foul tips\nand the same story. And \"out\" meant just that. Fines, possibly jail or\nprison sentence and lifetime revocation of driving privileges.\n\nBen flipped the car registration slot to \"stand-by\" and went back to\nthe teenager's car. Even though they were parked on the service strip\nof the police emergency lane, out of all traffic, the youngsters\nstayed in the car. This one point of the law they knew and knew well.\nSurvival chances were dim anytime something went wrong on the\nhigh-speed thruways. That little margin of luck vanished once outside\nthe not-too-much-better security of the vehicle body.\n\nMartin finished writing and then slipped the driver's license into a\npocket worked into the back of the metallic paper foil of the citation\nblank. He handed the pad into the window to the driver together with a\ncarbon stylus.\n\nThe boy's lip trembled and he signed the citation with a shaky hand.\n\nBen ripped off the citation blank and license, fed them into the slot\non the patrol car and pressed both the car registration and license\n\"record\" buttons. Ten seconds later the permanent record of the\ncitation was on file in Colorado Springs and a duplicate recording of\nthe action was in the Continental traffic court docket recorder\nnearest to the driver's hometown. Now, no power in three nations could\n\"fix\" that ticket. Ben withdrew the citation and registration tag and\nwalked back to the car. He handed the boy the license and registration\ntab, together with a copy of the citation. Ben bent down to peer into\nthe car.\n\n\"I made it as light on you as I could,\" he told the young driver.\n\"You're charged with improper use of the thruway. That's a minor\nviolation. By rights, I should have cited you for illegal usage.\" He\nlooked around slowly at each of the young people. \"You look like nice\nkids,\" he said. \"I think you'll grow up to be nice people. I want you\naround long enough to be able to vote in a few years. Who knows, maybe\nI'll be running for president then and I'll need your votes. It's a\ncinch that falling apart in the middle of two-hundred-mile an hour\ntraffic is no way to treat future voters.\n\n\"Good night, Kids.\" He smiled and walked away from the car. The three\nyoung passengers smiled back at Ben. The young driver just stared\nunhappily at the citation.\n\nClay stood talking with the wrecker crewmen. Ben nodded to him and\nmounted into the patrol car. The young Canadian crushed out his\ncigarette and swung up behind the sergeant. Clay went to the control\nseat when he saw Martin pause in the door to the galley.\n\n\"I'm going to get a cup of coffee,\" the older officer said, \"and then\ntake the first shift. You keep Beulah 'til I get back.\"\n\nClay nodded and pushed the throttles forward. Car 56 rolled back into\nthe police lane while behind it, the wrecker hooked onto the disabled\ncar and swung north into the crossover. Clay checked both the\nchronometer and radiodometer and then reported in. \"Cinncy Control\nthis is Car 56 back in service.\" Cincinnati Control acknowledged.\n\nTen minutes later, Ben reappeared in the cab, slid into the left-hand\nseat. \"Hit the sack, kid,\" he told Ferguson. The chronometer read\n2204. \"I'll wake you at midnight--or sooner, if anything breaks.\"\n\nFerguson stood up and stretched, then went into the galley. He poured\nhimself a cup of coffee and carrying it with him, went back to the\ncrew quarters. He closed the door to the galley and sat down on the\nlower bunk to sip his coffee. When he had finished, he tossed the cup\ninto the basket, reached and dimmed the cubby lights and kicked off\nhis boots. Still in his coveralls, Clay stretched out on the bunk and\nsighed luxuriously. He reached up and pressed a switch on the bulkhead\nabove his pillow and the muted sounds of music from a standard\nbroadcast commercial station drifted into the bunk area. Clay closed\nhis eyes and let the sounds of the music and the muted rumble of the\nengines lull him to sleep. It took almost fifteen seconds for him to\nbe in deep slumber.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBen pushed Beulah up to her steady seventy-five-mile-an-hour cruising\nspeed, moved to the center of the quarter-mile-wide police lane and\nlocked her tracks into autodrive. He relaxed back in his seat and\ndivided his gaze between the video monitors and the actual scene on\neither side of him in the night. Once again the sky was lighted, this\ntime much brighter on the horizon as the road ways swept to the south\nof Cincinnati.\n\nTraffic was once again heavy and fast with the blue and green carrying\nalmost equal loads while white was really crowded and even the yellow\n\"zoom\" lane was beginning to fill. The 2200 hour density reports from\nCinncy had been given before the Ohio State-Cal football game traffic\nhad hit the thruways and densities now were peaking near twenty\nthousand vehicles for the one-hundred-mile block of westbound NAT 26\nout of Cincinnati.\n\nBack to the east, near the eastern Ohio state line, Martin could hear\nCar 207 calling for a wrecker and meat wagon. Beulah rumbled on\nthrough the night. The video monitors flicked to the next ten-mile\nstretch as the patrol car rolled past another interchange. More\nvehicles streamed onto the westbound thruway, crossing over and\ndropping down into the same lanes they held coming out of the\nnorth-south road. Seven years on patrols had created automatic\nreflexes in the trooper sergeant. Out of the mass of cars and cargoes\nstreaming along the rushing tide of traffic, his eye picked out the\ntrack of one vehicle slanting across the white lane just a shade\nfaster than the flow of traffic. The vehicle was still four or five\nmiles ahead. It wasn't enough out of the ordinary to cause more than a\nsecond, almost unconscious glance, on the part of the veteran officer.\nHe kept his view shifting from screen to screen and out to the sides\nof the car.\n\nBut the reflexes took hold again as his eye caught the track of the\nsame vehicle as it hit the crossover from white to green, squeezed\ninto the faster lane and continued its sloping run towards the next\nfaster crossover. Now Martin followed the movement of the car almost\nconstantly. The moving blip had made the cut-over across the half-mile\nwide green lane in the span of one crossover and was now whipping into\nthe merger lane that would take it over the top of the police lane\nand drop down into the one hundred fifty to two hundred mile an hour\nblue. If the object of his scrutiny straightened out in the blue, he'd\nlet it go. The driver had been bordered on violation in his fast\ncrossover in the face of heavy traffic. If he kept it up in the\nnow-crowded high-speed lane, he was asking for sudden death. The\nmonitors flicked to the next block and Ben waited just long enough to\nsee the speeding car make a move to the left, cutting in front of a\nspeeding cargo carrier. Ben slammed Beulah into high. Once again the\nbull horn blared as the cocoons slammed shut, this time locking both\nClay and Kelly into their bunks, sealing Ben into the control seat.\n\nBeulah lifted on her air cushion and the twin jets roared as she\naccelerated down the police lane at three hundred miles an hour. Ben\nclosed the gap on the speeder in less than a minute and then edged\nover to the south side of the police lane to make the jump into the\nblue lane. The red emergency lights and the radio siren had already\ncleared a hole for him in the traffic pattern and he eased back on the\nfinger throttles as the patrol car sailed over the divider and into\nthe blue traffic lane. Now he had eyeball contact with the speeding\ncar, still edging over towards the ultra-high lane. On either side of\nthe patrol car traffic gave way, falling back or moving to the left\nand right. Car 56 was now directly behind the speeding passenger\nvehicle. Ben fingered the cut-in switch that put his voice signal onto\nthe standard vehicular emergency frequency--the band that carried the\nautomatic siren-warning to all vehicles.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe patrol car was still hitting above the two-hundred-mile-an-hour\nmark and was five hundred feet behind the speeder. The headlamp bathed\nthe other car in a white glare, punctuated with angry red flashes from\nthe emergency lights.\n\n\"You are directed to halt or be fired upon,\" Ben's voice roared out\nover the emergency frequency. Almost without warning, the speeding car\nbegan braking down with such deceleration that the gargantuan patrol\ncar with its greater mass came close to smashing over it and crushing\nthe small passenger vehicle like an insect. Ben cut all forward power,\npunched up full retrojet and at the instant he felt Beulah's tracks\ntouch the pavement as the air cushion blew, he slammed on the brakes.\nOnly the safety cocoon kept Martin from being hurled against the\ninstrument panel and in their bunks, Kelly Lightfoot and Clay Ferguson\nfelt their insides dragging down into their legs.\n\nThe safety cocoons snapped open and Clay jumped into his boots and\nleaped for the cab. \"Speeder,\" Ben snapped as he jumped down the steps\nto the side hatch. Ferguson snatched up his helmet from the rack\nbeside his seat and leaped down to join his partner. Ben ran up to the\nstopped car through a thick haze of smoke from the retrojets of the\npatrol car and the friction-burning braking of both vehicles.\nFerguson circled to the other side of the car. As they flashed their\nhandlights into the car, they saw the driver of the car kneeling on\nthe floor beside the reclined passenger seat. A woman lay stretched\nout on the seat, twisting in pain. The man raised an agonized face to\nthe officers. \"My wife's going to have her baby right here!\"\n\n\"Kelly,\" Ben yelled into his helmet transmitter. \"Maternity!\"\n\nThe dispensary ramp was halfway down before Ben had finished calling.\nKelly jumped to the ground and sprinted around the corner of the\npatrol car, medical bag in hand.\n\nShe shoved Clay out of the way and opened the door on the passenger\nside. On the seat, the woman moaned and then muffled a scream. The\npatrol doctor laid her palm on the distended belly. \"How fast are your\npains coming?\" she asked. Clay and Ben had moved away from the car a\nfew feet.\n\n\"Litter,\" Kelly snapped over her shoulder. Clay raced for the patrol\ncar while Ben unshipped a portable warning light and rolled it down\nthe lane behind the patrol car. He flipped it to amber \"caution\" and\n\"pass.\" Blinking amber arrows pointed to the left and right of the\nhalted passenger vehicle and traffic in the blue lane began picking up\nspeed and parting around the obstructions.\n\nBy the time he returned to the patrol car, Kelly had the expectant\nmother in the dispensary. She slammed the door in the faces of the\nthree men and then she went to work.\n\nThe woman's husband slumped against the side of the patrol vehicle.\n\nBen dug out his pack of cigarettes and handed one to the shaking\ndriver.\n\nHe waited until the man had taken a few drags before speaking.\n\n\"Mister, I don't know if you realize it or not but you came close to\nkilling your wife, your baby and yourself,\" Ben said softly, \"to say\nnothing of the possibility of killing several other families. Just\nwhat did you think you were doing?\"\n\nThe driver's shoulders sagged and his hand shook as he took the\ncigarette from his mouth. \"Honestly, officer, I don't know. I just got\nfrightened to death,\" he said. He peered up at Martin. \"This is our\nfirst baby, you see, and Ellen wasn't due for another week. We thought\nit would be all right to visit my folks in Cleveland and Ellen was\nfeeling just fine. Well, anyway, we started home tonight--we live in\nJefferson City--and just about the time I got on the thruway, Ellen\nstarted having pains. I was never so scared in my life. She screamed\nonce and then tried to muffle them but I knew what was happening and\nall I could think of was to get her to a hospital. I guess I went out\nof my head, what with her moaning and the traffic and everything. The\nonly place I could think of that had a hospital was Evansville, and I\nwas going to get her there come hell or high water.\" The young man\ntossed away the half-smoked cigarette and looked up at the closed\ndispensary door. \"Do you think she's all right?\"\n\nBen sighed resignedly and put his hand on the man's shoulder. \"Don't\nyou worry a bit. She's got one of the best doctors in the continent in\nthere with her. Come on.\" He took the husband by the arm and led him\naround to the patrol car cab hatch. \"You climb up there and sit down.\nI'll be with you in a second.\"\n\nThe senior officer signaled to Ferguson. \"Let's get his car out of the\ntraffic, Clay,\" he directed. \"You drive it.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBen went back and retrieved the caution blinker and re-racked it in\nthe side of the patrol car, then climbed up into the cab. He took his\nseat at the controls and indicated the jump seat next to him. \"Sit\ndown, son. We're going to get us and your car out of this mess before\nwe all get clobbered.\"\n\nHe flicked the headlamp at Ferguson in the control seat of the\npassenger car and the two vehicles moved out. Ben kept the emergency\nlights on while they eased carefully cross-stream to the north and the\nsafety of the police lane. Clay picked up speed at the outer edge of\nthe blue lane and rolled along until he reached the first \"patrol\nonly\" entrance through the divider to the service strip. Ben followed\nhim in and then turned off the red blinkers and brought the patrol car\nto a halt behind the other vehicle.\n\nThe worried husband stood up and looked to the rear of the car.\n\"What's making it so long?\" he asked anxiously. \"They've been in there\na long time.\"\n\nBen smiled. \"Sit down, son. These things take time. Don't you worry.\nIf there were anything wrong, Kelly would let us know. She can talk to\nus on the intercom anytime she wants anything.\"\n\nThe man sat back down. \"What's your name?\" Ben inquired.\n\n\"Haverstraw,\" the husband replied distractedly, \"George Haverstraw.\nI'm an accountant. That's my wife back there,\" he cried, pointing to\nthe closed galley door. \"That's Ellen.\"\n\n\"I know,\" Ben said gently. \"You told us that.\"\n\nClay had come back to the patrol car and dropped into his seat across\nfrom the young husband. \"Got a name picked out for the baby?\" he\nasked.\n\nHaverstraw's face lighted. \"Oh, yes,\" he exclaimed. \"If it's a boy,\nwe're going to call him Harmon Pierce Haverstraw. That was my\ngrandfather's name. And if she's a girl, it's going to be Caroline May\nafter Ellen's mother and grandmother.\"\n\nThe intercom came to life. \"Anyone up there?\" Kelly's voice asked.\nBefore they could answer, the wail of a baby sounded over the system.\nHaverstraw yelled.\n\n\"Congratulations, Mr. Haverstraw,\" Kelly said, \"you've got a\nfine-looking son.\"\n\n\"Hey,\" the happy young father yelped, \"hey, how about that? I've got a\nson.\" He pounded the two grinning troopers on the back. Suddenly he\nfroze. \"What about Ellen? How's Ellen?\" he called out.\n\n\"She's just fine,\" Kelly replied. \"We'll let you in here in a couple\nof minutes but we've got to get us gals and your new son looking\npretty for papa. Just relax.\"\n\nHaverstraw sank down onto the jump seat with a happy dazed look on his\nface.\n\nBen smiled and reached for the radio. \"I guess our newest citizen\ndeserves a ride in style,\" he said. \"We're going to have to transfer\nMrs. Haverstraw and er, oh yes, Master Harmon Pierce to an ambulance\nand then to a hospital now, George. You have any preference on where\nthey go?\"\n\n\"Gosh, no,\" the man replied. \"I guess the closest one to wherever we\nare.\" He paused thoughtfully. \"Just where are we? I've lost all sense\nof distance or time or anything else.\"\n\nBen looked at the radiodometer. \"We're just about due south of\nIndianapolis. How would that be?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's fine,\" Haverstraw replied.\n\n\"You can come back now, Mr. Haverstraw,\" Kelly called out. Haverstraw\njumped up. Clay got up with him. \"Come on, papa,\" he grinned, \"I'll\nshow you the way.\"\n\nBen smiled and then called into Indianapolis Control for an ambulance.\n\n\"Ambulance on the way,\" Control replied. \"Don't you need a wrecker,\ntoo, Five Six?\"\n\nBen grinned. \"Not this time. We didn't lose one. We gained one.\"\n\nHe got up and went back to have a look at Harmon Pierce Haverstraw,\nage five minutes, temporary address, North American Continental\nThruway 26-West, Mile Marker 632.\n\nFifteen minutes later, mother and baby were in the ambulance heading\nnorth to the hospital. Haverstraw, calmed down with a sedative\nadministered by Kelly, had nearly wrung their hands off in gratitude\nas he said good-by.\n\n\"I'll mail you all cigars when I get home,\" he shouted as he waved and\nclimbed into his car.\n\nBeulah's trio watched the new father ease carefully into the traffic\nas the ambulance headed down the police-way. Haverstraw would have to\ncut over to the next exchange and then go north to Indianapolis. He'd\narrive later than his family. This time, he was the very picture of\ncareful driving and caution as he threaded his way across the green.\n\n\"I wonder if he knows what brand of cigars I smoke?\" Kelly mused.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe chrono clicked up to 2335 as Car 56 resumed patrol. Kelly plumped\ndown onto the jump seat beside Ben. Clay was fiddling in the galley.\n\"Why don't you go back to the sack?\" Ben called.\n\n\"What, for a lousy twenty-five minutes,\" Clay replied. \"I had a good\nnap before you turned the burners up to high. Besides, I'm hungry.\nAnyone else want a snack?\"\n\nBen shook his head. \"No, thanks,\" Kelly said. Ferguson finished\nslapping together a sandwich. Munching on it, he headed into the\nengine room to make the midnight check. Car 56 had now been on patrol\neight hours. Only two hundred thirty-two hours and two thousand miles\nto go.\n\nKelly looked around at the departing back of the younger trooper.\n\"I'll bet this is the only car in NorCon that has to stock twenty days\nof groceries for a ten-day patrol,\" she said.\n\nBen chuckled. \"He's still a growing boy.\"\n\n\"Well, if he is, it's all between the ears,\" the girl replied. \"You'd\nthink that after a year I would have realized that nothing could\npenetrate that thick Canuck's skull. He gets me so mad sometimes that\nI want to forget I'm a lady.\" She paused thoughtfully. \"Come to think\nof it. No one ever accused me of being a lady in the first place.\"\n\n\"Sounds like love,\" Ben smiled.\n\nHunched over on the jump seat with her elbows on her knees and her\nchin cupped in both hands, Kelly gave the senior officer a quizzical\nsideways look.\n\nBen was watching his monitors and missed the glance. Kelly sighed and\nstared out into the light streaked night of the thruway. The heavy\nsurge of football traffic had distributed itself into the general flow\non the road and while all lanes were busy, there were no indications\nof any overcrowding or jam-ups. Much of the pattern was shifting from\npassenger to cargo vehicle as it neared midnight. The football crowds\nwere filtering off at each exchange and exit and the California fans\nhad worked into the blue and yellow--mostly the yellow--for the long\ntrip home. The fewer passenger cars on the thruway and the increase in\ncargo carriers gave the troopers a breathing spell. The men in the\ncontrol buckets of the three hundred and four hundred-ton cargo\nvehicles were the real pro's of the thruways; careful, courteous and\nfast. The NorCon patrol cars could settle down to watch out for the\noccasional nuts and drunks that might bring disaster.\n\nOnce again, Martin had the patrol car on auto drive in the center of\nthe police lane and he steeled back in his seat. Beside him, Kelly\nstared moodily into the night.\n\n\"How come you've never married, Ben?\" she asked. The senior trooper\ngave her a startled look. \"Why, I guess for the same reason you're\nstill a maiden,\" he answered. \"This just doesn't seem to be the right\nkind of a job for a married man.\"\n\nKelly shook her head. \"No, it's not the same thing with me,\" she said.\n\"At least, not entirely the same thing. If I got married, I'd have to\nquit the Patrol and you wouldn't. And secondly, if you must know the\ntruth, I've never been asked.\"\n\nBen looked thoughtfully at the copper-haired Irish-Indian girl. All of\na sudden she seemed to have changed in his eyes. He shook his head and\nturned back to the road monitors.\n\n\"I just don't think that a patrol trooper has any business getting\nmarried and trying to keep a marriage happy and make a home for a\nfamily thirty days out of every three hundred sixty, with an\noccasional weekend home if you're lucky enough to draw your hometown\nfor a terminal point. This might help the population rate but it\nsure doesn't do anything for the institution of matrimony.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I know some troopers that are married,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"But there aren't very many,\" Ben countered. \"Comes the time they pull\nme off the cars and stick me behind a desk somewhere, then I'll think\nabout it.\"\n\n\"You might be too old by then,\" Kelly murmured.\n\nBen grinned. \"You sound as though you're worried about it,\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" Kelly replied softly, \"no, I'm not worried about it. Just\nthinking.\" She averted her eyes and looked out into the night again.\n\"I wonder what NorCon would do with a husband-wife team?\" she\nmurmured, almost to herself.\n\nBen looked sharply at her and frowned. \"Why, they'd probably split\nthem up,\" he said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Split what up?\" Clay inquired, standing in the door of the cab.\n\n\"Split up all troopers named Clay Ferguson,\" Kelly said disgustedly,\n\"and use them for firewood--especially the heads. They say that\nhardwood burns long and leaves a fine ash. And that's what you've been\nfor years.\"\n\nShe sat erect in the jump seat and looked sourly at the young trooper.\n\nClay shuddered at the pun and squeezed by the girl to get to his seat.\n\"I'll take it now, pop,\" he said. \"Go get your geriatrics treatment.\"\n\nBen got out of his seat with a snort. \"I'll 'pop' you, skinhead,\" he\nsnapped. \"You may be eight years younger than I am but you only have\none third the virility and one tenth the brains. And eight years from\nnow you'll still be in deficit spending on both counts.\"\n\n\"Careful, venerable lord of my destiny,\" Clay admonished with a grin,\n\"remember how I spent my vacation and remember how you spent yours\nbefore you go making unsubstantiated statements about my virility.\"\n\nKelly stood up. \"If you two will excuse me, I'll go back to the\ndispensary and take a good jolt of male hormones and then we can come\nback and finish this man-to-man talk in good locker room company.\"\n\n\"Don't you dare,\" Ben cried, \"I wouldn't let you tamper with one\nsingle, tiny one of your feminine traits, princess. I like you just\nthe way you are.\"\n\nKelly looked at him with a wide-eyed, cherubic smile. \"You really mean\nthat, Ben?\"\n\nThe older trooper flushed briefly and then turned quickly into the\ngalley. \"I'm going to try for some shut-eye. Wake me at two, Clay, if\nnothing else breaks.\" He turned to Kelly who still was smiling at him.\n\"And watch out for that lascivious young goat.\"\n\n\"It's all just talk, talk, talk,\" she said scornful. \"You go to bed\nBen. I'm going to try something new in psychiatric annals. I'm going\nto try and psychoanalyze a dummy.\" She sat back down on the jump seat.\n\nAt 2400 hours it was Vincennes Check with the density reports, all\ndown in the past hour. The patrol was settling into what looked like a\nquiet night routine. Kelly chatted with Ferguson for another half hour\nand then rose again. \"I think I'll try to get some sleep,\" she said.\n\"I'll put on a fresh pot of coffee for you two before I turn in.\"\n\nShe rattled around in the galley for some time. \"Whatcha cooking?\"\nClay called out. \"Making coffee,\" Kelly replied.\n\n\"It take all that time to make coffee?\" Clay queried.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"I'm also getting a few things ready so we can have a\nfast breakfast in case we have to eat on the run. I'm just about\nthrough now.\"\n\nA couple of minutes later she stuck her head into the cab. \"Coffee's\ndone. Want some?\"\n\nClay nodded. \"Please, princess.\"\n\nShe poured him a cup and set it in the rack beside his seat.\n\n\"Thanks,\" Clay said. \"Good night, Hiawatha.\"\n\n\"Good night, Babe,\" she replied.\n\n\"You mean 'Paul Bunyon,' don't you?\" Clay asked. \"'Babe' was his blue\nox.\"\n\n\"I know what I said,\" Kelly retorted and strolled back to the\ndispensary. As she passed through the crew cubby, she glanced at Ben\nsleeping on the bunk recently vacated by Ferguson. She paused and\ncarefully and gently pulled a blanket up over his sleeping form. She\nsmiled down at the trooper and then went softly to her compartment.\n\nIn the cab, Clay sipped at his coffee and kept watchful eyes on the\nvideo monitors. Beulah was back on auto drive and Clay had dropped her\nspeed to a slow fifty as the traffic thinned.\n\nAt 0200 hours he left the cab long enough to go back and shake Ben\nawake and was himself re-awakened at 0400 to take back control. He let\nBen sleep an extra hour before routing him out of the bunk again at\n0700. The thin, gray light of the winter morning was just taking hold\nwhen Ben came back into the cab. Clay had pulled Beulah off to the\nservice strip and was stopped while he finished transcribing his\nscribbled notes from the 0700 Washington Criminal Control broadcast.\n\nBen ran his hand sleepily over his close-cropped head. \"Anything\nexciting?\" he asked with a yawn. Clay shook his head. \"Same old thing.\n'All cars exercise special vigilance over illegal crossovers. Keep all\nlanes within legal speed limits.' Same old noise.\"\n\n\"Anything new on our hit-runner?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"Good morning, knights of the open road,\" Kelly said from the galley\ndoor. \"Obviously you both went to sleep after I left and allowed our\nhelpless citizens to slaughter each other.\"\n\n\"How do you figure that one?\" Ben laughed.\n\n\"Oh, it's very simple,\" she replied. \"I managed to get in a full seven\nhours of sleep. When you sleep, I sleep. I slept. Ergo, you did\nlikewise.\"\n\n\"Nope,\" Clay said, \"for once we had a really quiet night. Let's hope\nthe day is of like disposition.\"\n\nKelly began laying out the breakfast things. \"You guys want eggs this\nmorning?\"\n\n\"You gonna cook again today?\" Clay inquired.\n\n\"Only breakfast,\" Kelly said. \"You have the honors for the rest of the\nday. The diner is now open and we're taking orders.\"\n\n\"I'll have mine over easy,\" Ben said. \"Make mine sunny-up,\" Clay\ncalled.\n\nKelly began breaking eggs into the pan, muttering to herself. \"Over\neasy, sunny-up, I like 'em scrambled. Next tour I take I'm going to\nget on a team where everyone likes scrambled eggs.\"\n\nA few minutes later, Beulah's crew sat down to breakfast. Ben had just\ndipped into his egg yolk when the radio blared. \"Attention all cars.\nSpecial attention Cars 207, 56 and 82.\"\n\n\"Just once,\" Ben said, \"just once, I want to sit down to a meal and\nget it all down my gullet before that radio gives me indigestion.\" He\nlaid down his fork and reached for the message pad.\n\nThe radio broadcast continued. \"A late model, white over green\nTravelaire, containing two men and believed to be the subjects wanted\nin earlier broadcast on murder, robbery and hit-run murder, was\ninvolved in a service station robbery and murder at Vandalia,\nIllinois, at approximately 0710 this date. NorCon Criminal Division\nbelieves this subject car escaped filter check and left NAT 26-West\nsometime during the night.\n\n\"Owner of this stolen vehicle states it had only half tanks of fuel at\nthe time it was taken. This would indicate wanted subjects stopped for\nfuel. It is further believed they were recognized by the station\nattendant from video bulletins sent out by this department last date\nand that he was shot and killed to prevent giving alarm.\n\n\"The shots alerted residents of the area and the subject car was last\nseen headed south. This vehicle may attempt to regain access to\nNAT-26-West or it may take another thruway. All units are warned once\nagain to approach this vehicle with extreme caution and only with the\nassistance of another unit where possible. Acknowledge. Washington\nCriminal Control out.\"\n\nBen looked at the chrono. \"They hit Vandalia at 0710, eh. Even in the\nyellow they couldn't get this far for another half hour. Let's finish\nbreakfast. It may be a long time until lunch.\"\n\nThe crew returned to their meal. While Kelly was cleaning up after\nbreakfast, Clay ran the quick morning engine room check. In the cab,\nBen opened the arms rack and brought out two machine pistols and\nbelts. He checked them for loads and laid one on Clay's control seat.\nHe strapped the other around his waist. Then he flipped up a cover in\nthe front panel of the cab. It exposed the breech mechanisms of a\npair of twin-mounted 25 mm auto-cannon. The ammunition loads were\nfull. Satisfied, Ben shut the inspection port and climbed into his\nseat. Clay came forward, saw the machine pistol on his seat and\nstrapped it on without a word. He settled himself in his seat. \"Engine\nroom check is all green. Let's go rabbit hunting.\"\n\nCar 56 moved slowly out into the police lane. Both troopers had their\nindividual sets of video monitors on in front of their seats and were\nwatching them intently. In the growing light of day, a white-topped\ncar was going to be easy to spot.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt had all the earmarks of being another wintery, overcast day. The\noutside temperature at 0800 was right on the twenty-nine-degree mark\nand the threat of more snow remained in the air. The 0800 density\nreports from St. Louis Control were below the 14,000 mark in all lanes\nin the one-hundred-mile block west of the city. That was to be\nexpected. They listened to the eastbound densities peaking at\ntwenty-six thousand vehicles in the same block, all heading into the\nmetropolis and their jobs. The 0800, 1200 and 1600 hours density\nreports also carried the weather forecasts for a five-hundred-mile\nradius from the broadcasting control point. Decreasing temperatures\nwith light to moderate snow was in the works for Car 56 for the first\ncouple of hundred miles west of St. Louis, turning to almost blizzard\nconditions in central Kansas. Extra units had already been put into\nservice on all thruways through the midwest and snow-burners were\nwaging a losing battle from Wichita west to the Rockies around\nAlamosa, Colorado.\n\nOutside the temperature was below freezing; inside the patrol car it\nwas a comfortable sixty-eight degrees. Kelly had cleared the galley\nand taken her place on the jump seat between the two troopers. With\nall three of them in the cab, Ben cut from the intercom to commercial\nbroadcast to catch the early morning newscasts and some pleasant\nmusic. The patrol vehicle glided along at a leisurely sixty miles an\nhour. An hour out of St. Louis, a big liquid cargo carrier was stopped\non the inner edge of the green lane against the divider to the police\nlane. The trucker had dropped both warning barriers and lights a half\nmile back. Ben brought Beulah to a halt across the divider from the\nstopped carrier. \"Dropped a track pin,\" the driver called out to the\nofficers.\n\nBen backed Beulah across the divider behind the stalled carrier to\ngive them protection while they tried to assist the stalled vehicle.\n\nDonning work helmets to maintain contact with the patrol car, and its\nremote radio system, the two troopers dismounted and went to see what\nneeded fixing. Kelly drifted back to the dispensary and stretched out\non one of the hospital bunks and picked up a new novel.\n\nBeulah's well-equipped machine shop stock room produced a matching\npin and it was merely a matter of lifting the stalled carrier and\ndriving it into place in the track assembly. Ben brought the patrol\ncar alongside the carrier and unshipped the crane. Twenty minutes\nlater, Clay and the carrier driver had the new part installed and the\ntanker was on his way once again.\n\nClay climbed into the cab and surveyed his grease-stained uniform\ncoveralls and filthy hands. \"Your nose is smudged, too, dearie,\"\nMartin observed.\n\nClay grinned, \"I'm going to shower and change clothes. Try and see if\nyou can drive this thing until I get back without increasing the\npedestrian fatality rate.\" He ducked back into the crew cubby and\nstripped his coveralls.\n\nBored with her book, Kelly wandered back to the cab and took Clay's\nvacant control seat. The snow had started falling again and in the\nmid-morning light it tended to soften the harsh, utilitarian landscape\nof the broad thruway stretching ahead to infinity and spreading out in\na mile of speeding traffic on either hand.\n\n\"Attention all cars on NAT 26-West and east,\" Washington Criminal\nControl radio blared. \"Special attention Cars 56 and 82. Suspect\nvehicle, white over green Travelaire reported re-entered NAT 26-West\non St. Louis interchange 179. St. Louis Control reports communications\ndifficulty in delayed report. Vehicle now believed....\"\n\n\"Car 56, Car 56,\" St. Louis Control broke in. \"Our pigeon is in your\nzone. Commercial carrier reports near miss sideswipe three minutes ago\nin blue lane approximately three miles west of mile Marker 957.\n\n\"Repeating. Car 56, suspect car....\"\n\nBen glanced at the radiodometer. It read 969, then clicked to 970.\n\n\"This is Five Six, St. Louis,\" he broke in, \"acknowledged. Our\nposition is mile marker 970....\"\n\nKelly had been glued to the video monitors since the first of the\nbulletin. Suddenly she screamed and banged Ben on the shoulder. \"There\nthey are. There they are,\" she cried, pointing at the blue lane\nmonitor.\n\nMartin took one look at the white-topped car cutting through traffic\nin the blue lane and slammed Beulah into high. The safety cocoons\nslammed shut almost on the first notes of the bull horn. Trapped in\nthe shower, Clay was locked into the stall dripping wet as the water\nautomatically shut off with the movement of the cocoon.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I have them in sight,\" Ben reported, as the patrol car lifted on its\nair pad and leaped forward. \"They're in the blue five miles ahead of\nme and cutting over to the yellow. I estimate their speed at two\ntwenty-five. I am in pursuit.\"\n\nTraffic gave way as Car 56 hurtled the divider into the blue.\n\nThe radio continued to snap orders.\n\n\"Cars 112, 206, 76 and 93 establish roadblocks at mile marker\ncrossover 1032. Car 82 divert all blue and yellow to green and\nwhite.\"\n\nEight Two was one hundred fifty miles ahead but at\nthree-hundred-mile-an-hour speeds, 82's team was very much a part of\nthe operation. This would clear the two high-speed lanes if the\nsuspect car hadn't been caught sooner.\n\n\"Cars 414, 227 and 290 in NAT-26-East, move into the yellow to cover\nin case our pigeon decides to fly the median.\" The controller\ncontinued to move cars into covering positions in the area on all\ncrossovers and turnoffs. The sweating dispatcher looked at his lighted\nmap board and mentally cursed the lack of enough units to cover every\nexit. State and local authorities already had been notified in the\nevent the fugitives left the thruways and tried to escape on a state\nfreeway.\n\nIn Car 56, Ben kept the patrol car roaring down the blue lane through\nthe speeding westbound traffic. The standard emergency signal was\ndoing a partial job of clearing the path, but at those speeds, driver\nreaction times weren't always fast enough. Ahead, the fleeing suspect\ncar brushed against a light sedan, sending it careening and rocking\nacross the lane. The driver fought for control as it swerved and\nscreeched on its tilting frame. He brought it to a halt amid a haze of\nblue smoke from burning brakes and bent metal. The white over green\nTravelaire never slowed, fighting its way out of the blue into the\nultra-high yellow and lighter traffic. Ben kept Beulah in bulldog\npursuit.\n\nThe sideswipe ahead had sent other cars veering in panic and a cluster\ninadvertently bunched up in the path of the roaring patrol car. Like a\nflock of hawk-frightened chickens, they tried to scatter as they saw\nand heard the massive police vehicle bearing down on them. But like\nchickens, they couldn't decide which way to run. It was a matter of\nfive or six seconds before they parted enough to let the patrol car\nthrough. Ben had no choice but to cut the throttle and punch once on\nthe retrojets to brake the hurtling patrol car. The momentary drops in\nspeed unlocked the safety cocoons and in an instant, Clay had leaped\nfrom the shower stall and sped to the cab. Hearing, rather than seeing\nhis partner, Martin snapped over his shoulder, \"Unrack the rifles.\nThat's the car.\" Clay reached for the gun rack at the rear of the cab.\n\nKelly took one look at the young trooper and jumped for the doorway to\nthe galley. A second later she was back. Without a word, she handed\nthe nude Ferguson a dangling pair of uniform coveralls. Clay gasped,\ndropped the rifles and grabbed the coveralls from her hand and\nclutched them to his figure. His face was beet-red. Still without\nspeaking, Kelly turned and ran back to her dispensary to be ready for\nthe next acceleration.\n\nClay was into the coveralls and in his seat almost at the instant\nMartin whipped the patrol car through the hole in the blue traffic and\nshoved her into high once more.\n\nThere was no question about the fact that the occupants of the\nfugitive car knew they were being pursued. They shot through the\ncrossover into the yellow lane and now were hurtling down the thruway\nclose to the four-hundred-mile-an-hour mark.\n\nMartin had Beulah riding just under three hundred to make the\ncrossover, still ten miles behind the suspect car and following on\nvideo monitor. The air still crackled with commands as St. Louis and\nWashington Control maneuvered other cars into position as the pursuit\nwent westward past other units blocking exit routes.\n\nClay read aloud the radiodometer numerals as they clicked off a mile\nevery nine seconds. Car 56 roared into the yellow and the instant Ben\nhad it straightened out, he slammed all finger throttles to full\npower. Beulah snapped forward and even at three hundred miles an hour,\nthe sudden acceleration pasted the car's crew against the back of\ntheir cushioned seats. The patrol car shot forward at more than five\nhundred miles an hour.\n\nThe image of the Travelaire grew on the video monitor and then the two\ntroopers had it in actual sight, a white, racing dot on the broad\navenue of the thruway six miles ahead.\n\nClay triggered the controls for the forward bow cannon and a panel box\nflashed to \"ready fire\" signal.\n\n\"Negative,\" Martin ordered. \"We're coming up on the roadblock. You\nmight miss and hit one of our cars.\"\n\n\"Car 56 to Control,\" the senior trooper called. \"Watch out at the\nroadblock. He's doing at least five hundred in the yellow and he'll\nnever be able to stop.\"\n\nTwo hundred miles east, the St. Louis controller made a snap decision.\n\"Abandon roadblock. Roadblock cars start west. Maintain two hundred\nuntil subject comes into monitor view. Car 56, continue speed\nestimates of subject car. Maybe we can box him in.\"\n\nAt the roadblock forty-five miles ahead of the speeding fugitives and\ntheir relentless pursuer, the four patrol cars pivoted and spread out\nacross the roadway some five hundred feet apart. They lunged forward\nand lifted up to air-cushion jet drive at just over two hundred miles\nan hour. Eight pairs of eyes were fixed on video monitors set for the\nten-mile block to the rear of the four vehicles.\n\nBeulah's indicated ground speed now edged towards the five hundred\nfifty mark, close to the maximum speeds the vehicles could attain.\n\nThe gap continued to close, but more slowly. \"He's firing hotter,\" Ben\ncalled out. \"Estimating five thirty on subject vehicle.\"\n\nNow Car 56 was about three miles astern and still the gap closed. The\nfugitive car flashed past the site of the abandoned roadblock and\nfifteen seconds later all four patrol cars racing ahead of the\nTravelaire broke into almost simultaneous reports of \"Here he comes.\"\n\nA second later, Clay Ferguson yelled out, \"There he goes. He's\nboondocking, he's boondocking.\"\n\n\"He has you spotted,\" Martin broke in. \"He's heading for the median.\nCut, cut, cut. Get out in there ahead of him.\"\n\nThe driver of the fugitive car had seen the bulk of the four big\npatrol cruisers outlined against the slight rise in the thruway almost\nat the instant he flashed onto their screens ten miles behind them. He\nbroke speed, rocked wildly from side to side, fighting for control and\nthen cut diagonally to the left, heading for the outer edge of the\nthruway and the unpaved, half-mile-wide strip of landscaped earth that\nseparated the east and westbound segments of NAT-26.\n\nThe white and green car was still riding on its airpad when it hit the\nlow, rounded curbing at the edge of the thruway. It hurtled into the\nair and sailed for a hundred feet across the gently-sloping\nsnow-covered grass, came smashing down in a thick hedgerow of\nbushes--and kept going.\n\nCar 56 slowed and headed for the curbing. \"Watch it, kids,\" Ben\nsnapped over the intercom, \"we may be buying a plot in a second.\"\n\nStill traveling more than five hundred miles an hour, the huge patrol\ncar hit the curbing and bounced into the air like a rocket boosted\nelephant. It tilted and smashed its nose in a slanting blow into the\nsnow-covered ground. The sound of smashing and breaking equipment\nmingled with the roar of the thundering jets, tracks and air drives as\nthe car fought its way back to level travel. It surged forward and\nsmashed through the hedgerow and plunged down the sloping snowbank\nafter the fleeing car.\n\n\"Clay,\" Ben called in a strained voice, \"take 'er.\"\n\nFerguson's fingers were already in position. \"You all right, Ben?\" he\nasked anxiously.\n\n\"Think I dislocated a neck vertebra,\" Ben replied. \"I can't move my\nhead. Go get 'em, kid.\"\n\n\"Try not to move your head at all, Ben,\" Kelly called from her cocoon\nin the dispensary. \"I'll be there the minute we slow down.\"\n\nA half mile ahead, the fugitive car plowed along the bottom of the\ngentle draw in a cloud of snow, trying to fight its way up the\nopposite slope and onto the eastbound thruway.\n\nBut the Travelaire was never designed for driving on anything but a\nmodern superhighway. Car 56 slammed through the snow and down to the\nbottom of the draw. A quarter of a mile ahead of the fugitives, the\nfirst of the four roadblock units came plowing over the rise.\n\nThe car speed dropped quickly to under a hundred and the cocoons were\nagain retracted. Ben slumped forward in his seat and caught himself.\nHe eased back with a gasp of pain, his head held rigidly straight.\nAlmost the instant he started to straighten up, Kelly flung herself\nthrough the cab door. She clasped his forehead and held his head\nagainst the back of the control seat.\n\nSuddenly, the fugitive car spun sideways, bogged in the wet snow and\nmuddy ground beneath and stopped. Clay bore down on it and was about\ntwo hundred yards away when the canopy of the other vehicle popped\nopen and a sheet of automatic weapons fire raked the patrol car. Only\nthe low angle of the sedan and the nearness of the bulky patrol car\nsaved the troopers. Explosive bullets smashed into the patrol car\ncanopy and sent shards of plastiglass showering down on the trio.\n\nAn instant later, the bow cannon on the first of the cut-off patrol\nunits opened fire. An ugly, yellow-red blossom of smoke and fire\nerupted from the front of the Travelaire and it burst into flames. A\nsecond later, the figure of a man staggered out of the burning car,\nclothes and hair aflame. He took four plunging steps and then fell\nface down in the snow. The car burning and crackled and a thick\nfunereal pyre of oily, black smoke billowed into the gray sky. It was\nsnowing heavily now, and before the troopers could dismount and plow\nto the fallen man, a thin layer of snow covered his burned body.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAn hour later, Car 56 was again on NAT 26-West, this time heading for\nWichita barracks and needed repairs. In the dispensary, Ben Martin was\nstretched out on a hospital bunk with a traction brace around his neck\nand a copper-haired medical-surgical patrolwoman fussing over him.\n\nIn the cab, Clay peered through the now almost-blinding blizzard that\nwhirled and skirled thick snow across the thruway. Traffic densities\nwere virtually zero despite the efforts of the dragonlike snow-burners\ntrying to keep the roadways clear. The young trooper shivered despite\nthe heavy jacket over his coveralls. Wind whistled through the shell\nholes in Beulah's canopy and snow sifted and drifted against the back\nbulkhead.\n\nThe cab communications system had been smashed by the gunfire and Clay\nwore his work helmet both for communications and warmth.\n\nThe door to the galley cracked open and Kelly stuck her head in. \"How\nmuch farther, Clay?\" she asked.\n\n\"We should be in the barracks in about twenty minutes,\" the shivering\ntrooper replied.\n\n\"I'll fix you a cup of hot coffee,\" Kelly said. \"You look like you\nneed it.\"\n\nOver the helmet intercom Clay heard her shoving things around in the\ngalley. \"My heavens, but this place is a mess,\" she exclaimed. \"I\ncan't even find the coffee bin. That steeplechase driving has got to\nstop.\" She paused.\n\n\"Clay,\" she called out, \"Have you been drinking in here? It smells\nlike a brewery.\"\n\nClay raised mournful eyes to the shattered canopy above him. \"My\ncooking wine\" he sighed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Code Three, by Rick Raphael\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CODE THREE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 19111.txt or 19111.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/9/1/1/19111/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Sankar Viswanathan, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
