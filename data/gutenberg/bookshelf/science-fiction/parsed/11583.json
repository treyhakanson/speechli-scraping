A complimentary copy was sent to \nhis son Paul, who was moved by the tribute. We then asked Paul to write \nan introduction to The Runaway Asteroid. The following is his \nresponse-surely one of the most unusual introductions in any book \nanywhere, and one we are privileged to share with our readers.\n\n\nDear Dad,\n\nA most remarkable invention is weaving the world together in a way we \nnever anticipated while you were on Earth, and it netted your writing. \nFans of your books for juveniles, The Digby Allen series, were able to \nconnect to each other, share their enthusiasm for your novels, and were \ninspired to continue the voyage. Led by Jonathan Cooper, the intrepid \nmastermind of the creative crew, they made a commitment to write their \nown vision of the future. Thoughtfully, they credit you as having \nshoulders broad enough for them to stand on and see the centuries \nbeyond. The invention that has made this possible is called the \ninternet. There seems no need to explain what it is here, but part of \nits magic is that it can permit people to connect to each other \nindependently of time and space.\n\nThe themes of Dig Allen from the 1960's have worked like the internet \nin that they functioned independently of time and space, only much more \nslowly. You presented your ideas in books as ideas are posted on the \ninternet. The authors of Starman were drawn to the themes in your books \nand then each other in cyberspace, which acts as both the bookshelf and \ncaf\u00c2\u008e for today's ideas and authors. The creators of Starman saw value \nin your stories and tried to get the publisher to renew the series. \nSadly, your old publisher ignored them and blocked the revival, as \nthough they were so much space junk. \n\nNo one owns a theme. But the creators of Starman have shown that they \nshare some of the beliefs that you express in your subjects. Their \nyoung men of the stars prove that they too are brave, adventurous and \nwilling to sacrifice for freedom and justice.  With a loyalty toward \neach other that would create envy in every generation, they test \nthemselves against cunning scoundrels. As they conquer villains, they, \nand we along with them, learn whether they measure up. Will they prove \nthemselves worthy as young people have done for all time? Young readers \ncan have a chance to preview something about their own lives and the \nworld they will live in. And just as you believed, somehow the human \nrace survives. If the world of Starman is an accurate guess on the \nfuture, then the good guys, the ones in the white spacesuits, will \ncontinue to prevail and produce more young people to keep the dream \nalive. I hope that some of the next generation of courageous young \npeople will read this series. \n\nYour fans don't know that you started writing seriously relatively \nearly in life, in the 1920's and '30's, first as a teen for your \npersonal pleasure and then on your school newspaper at New Utrecht High \nSchool in Brooklyn, New York. Did having to learn the English language \nafter speaking Russian until the age of seven help you become a better \nwriter? Were your poems and letters to Mom valuable both to her and to \nyour professional development? Did the comic books you authored during \nthe Golden Age of comics give you a better sense of story-telling and \ndialogue or did it degrade your love of language? I know that writing \ntelevision scripts and other creative projects supported the family \nduring the difficult years of the 1950's, but how did it affect your \nlater work with Digby Allen? So many of your themes are repeated and \nreworked in several of your creations right through to the late 1980's. \nWho would guess that you once wrote a paper on the use of the raven in \nseveral of Shakespeare's plays? Or that you wrote biology text to \naccompany a new medium, slides made from strips of 35-mm film? Would \nadmirers realize that you were most interested in world events, but \nread the sports section of the New York Times first, everyday? I'm \ncertain your fans wouldn't have read the American Elsewhen Almanac, a \ncompilation of bits of Americana and commentary that you published in \nthe 1980's. \n\nI want to thank the authors of Starman for giving me the opportunity to \nwrite the introduction to their second novel. If there is a way to \ncommunicate to you across the veil between our dimensional world and \nthe one in which you now reside, then it must be through the pages of a \nbook. After the love of family, I don't believe anything was more \nprecious to you than books, so maybe this letter will be able to cross \nthe divide. Just as I proofread the drafts of Digby Allen before you \nsent them to the publisher, your granddaughter and grandson proofread \nthis. Perhaps that will act like a mystical booster rocket to get these \npages to you. \n\nAnd to future space pioneers, may the solar winds be at your back.\n\n\nLove,\n\nPaul\n\nOctober 20, 2000\n\n\nTHE RUNAWAY ASTEROID\n\n\n1: Controlled Fury\n\n\"THEY'RE getting closer! They're almost on us! We won't make it into \nthe Belt on time!\" The navigator of the Silver Spear was on the verge \nof panic. His frenzied hands moved over the controls.\n\n\"Keep going! Keep up full speed! Make sure that we get there ahead of \nthem!\" Lurton Zimbardo's voice was even and controlled, but it was \nobvious that he was barely containing his volatile fury. His commands \nwere not to be questioned. His nostrils flared, the muscles around his \nlips were taut, he kept his fists clenched and pounded a persistent \nrhythm on his ship's control panel. His breath sounded as if he could \ninhale and exhale the room's entire atmosphere. It was only his iron \nself-control that kept his crew from giving in to their fears.\n\nBehind them just moments away Starman David \"Zip\" Foster's ship, the \nStar Ranger, was closing the gap. The pursuit had been going on for two \ndays, since the Silver Spear had blasted off from Eagle City on Mars \nand escaped while the rest of the pirates were rounded up by Earth's \nforces. Zip Foster, accompanied by Starmen Mark Seaton and Joe Taylor \nand their companion Steve Cliff, had followed less than fifteen minutes \nlater. The brief lead that Lurton Zimbardo's ship had was enough to \nkeep the Silver Spear out of the clutches of their pursuers, but not by \nmuch. The crew of the Spear was suffering acutely from sleeplessness \nand mounting anxiety.\n\nOnly days earlier, Lurton Zimbardo had been second-in-command under \nTroy Putnam. Together they had organized over 500 men and attempted to \ntake control of the capital city of Mars in a sudden attack. Had they \nsucceeded, the pirates could have held the people of the Earth-Moon \nsystem hostage to their demands. The Starmen and their allies had \nthwarted the pirates' plan. Most of the pirates, including their \nleader, had been captured. Zimbardo, however, had escaped with a few \nothers. With the Starmen in close pursuit, he was desperately trying to \noutrun them and return to the pirates' base in the Asteroid Belt. \n\nThe Belt loomed up. The first few chunks of rock were visible now to \nthe unaided eyes of those on the deck of the Silver Spear. In seconds, \nthey were among them. The navigator screamed as the ship whipped by a \npitted rock a quarter of a mile long, missing it by a few yards.\n\n\"Fool!\" shouted Zimbardo. \"Turn on the automatic pilot!\" The \nnavigator's eyes were the size of saucers. Immobile with terror, he \ndidn't respond to Zimbardo's command. The former second-in-command of \nthe pirates pushed him out of the chair, took over, and activated the \nswitch that cut in the automatic pilot. Lurton Zimbardo was not \nphysically imposing, but more than made up for his slight build with an \nimmensely strong will and a decisive nature that was merciless whenever \nit served him.\n\nHe knew they were going too fast even for the automatic pilot to keep \nthe ship safe once they entered the thick sweep of the asteroids. He \nalso knew that the Belt was their only hope of escaping the Starmen on \ntheir trail. Powered by adrenaline, his senses were functioning at \ntheir peak. With amazing alacrity and intensity, Zimbardo aided the \nautomatic pilot and threaded the Silver Spear through the weaving \nasteroids. It almost seemed as if he were in a trance.\n\nSoon a dark asteroid loomed ahead, roughly shaped like a potato, \nforty-five miles long and twenty-five wide, rotating slowly around its \nlongest axis. It was nearly invisible both to the eye and to the \ninstruments, but Zimbardo knew where it was. He barked out a command. \nThe Silver Spear slowed quickly, and moments later a huge airlock door \nopened in one of the poles of the asteroid. Zimbardo piloted the ship \ninto the airlock, through the stone tunnel that led into the interior \nof the asteroid, and then touched down.\n\nThe thin, wiry man raced for the control room as fast as he could run, \npushing men out of the way and heeding no one who called out to him. \nOnce inside, he quickly pressed a series of buttons and entered a \nnumeric code. Once it was entered and confirmed, he made a fist and \nslammed it hard on a large red button. Immediately all the radar \nscreens were covered with snow.\n\nZimbardo relaxed for the first time in days. He exhaled quietly and \nactually smiled. He took a deep breath and smiled more broadly.\n\n\"Sir?\" asked one of the technicians who had watched the procedure.\n\n\"I detonated a hydrogen bomb on a neighboring asteroid a couple of \nhundred miles from here. Part of a backup plan for keeping this place \nhidden. It will clog all radar screens for a few minutes. By the time \nthey clear, no one will be able to find us or this asteroid.\"\n\nZimbardo's relaxed state did not last long. He swelled up with energy \nagain, strode to another console, and tapped in a series of commands.\n\n\"Come here, Gene,\" he ordered as his fingers flew over the keyboard. \nThe man he addressed quickly came to stand by the pirate leader. He was \na well-built young man in his late twenties with short curly brown \nhair, finely chiseled features, and an obvious desire to please. He was \nwell trained in the technology of space control systems. After he had \nproven his competence in the field, Troy Putnam had made him his chief \ncontrol officer.\n\nZimbardo continued. \"Follow these coordinates at this speed. Don't \nalter the course for any reason without my permission.\"\n\nGene looked at the planning board where the numbers were posted in a \npleasant green light. \"That course will take us out of the Belt, Mr. \nZimbardo. Is that what you want?\"\n\n\"That's what I want. It's time to move away from here. If anything out \nof the ordinary happens, let me know immediately. Find me by using my \npersonal code on the communicator-no general announcement. Keep watch \nespecially for any spacecraft-especially any spacecraft!\"\n\n\"Yes sir!\" Gene took his place and the others returned to their duties.\n\nOnce he saw that the crew members were well settled, he picked up the \nintercom and ordered his leaders to assemble in a meeting room in five \nminutes. From the few dozen pirates left, he had hand-selected five \ncompetent leaders to be his lieutenants: Gebbeth, Crass, Lather, \nBolcher, and Slant.\n\nIn less than that time, Lurton Zimbardo was sitting at a table with the \nfive other men. All but Zimbardo looked haggard. The pirates were \ndemoralized and upset. Victory on Mars and beyond had been within their \ngrasp, but it had all been blundered away. A band of several hundred \nmen who had planned and worked for several years had been reduced to a \nfew dozen. Their dreams of power and prominence, shaped and fueled by \ntheir captain Troy Putnam, had been utterly destroyed. Now Putnam was \nin custody on Mars, along with the rest of the pirates who had been \ncaptured by Earth's forces.\n\n\"Troy Putnam was a fool,\" Zimbardo announced in a quiet voice edged \nwith steel. \"His plan might have worked-might have worked, if I had had \nmore part in planning-but he was no more than a conceited ignoramus! \nThe Starmen walked in on him and took him completely by surprise! I can \njust imagine how his face must have looked as he realized his plan was \nover and he was led off to jail. A fool! We are better off without him!\"\n\n\"Better off without him?\" asked one man in a dull voice. \"What do you \nmean, Lurton? Better off for what?\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool yourself, Crass!\" Zimbardo sneered. \"You think we're \nfinished here? We will still get what we want and it won't be very \ndifficult! We don't need Putnam and we don't need a few hundred men, \neither! You can be thankful you're here instead of locked in a stone \nroom in Eagle City eating square, plain, healthy meals off of a metal \ntray! The collapse of Putnam's big dream is the best thing that could \nhave happened for us!\"\n\nA muscular, unsmiling man on Zimbardo's right swung his gaze to the \nspeaker. \"It sounds as if you have a plan, Mr. Zimbardo.\" The man was \nin his early thirties and resembled a street fighter. His carefully \ncombed dark hair made him look almost strikingly handsome, but his eyes \nwere black and humorless.\n\nZimbardo turned toward the man. \"Yes, I have a plan. You, Gebbeth, will \nbe my chief assistant and the pilot of the Tartarus, my personal ship. \nI can depend on you. Space Command's celebration on Mars will be \nextremely short-lived.\"\n\n\"You were always the strong one, Lurton,\" said another. \"I kind of \nalways figured you for the real leader, and I always wished it was you \ninstead of Putnam.\"\n\n\"Now you got your wish, Bolcher. I've taken charge. I'm moving this \nasteroid out of its orbit into a place outside the Belt. Here's my \nplan.\"\n\nAlmost an hour later, the men left the meeting room, smiling, joking, \nand stepping lightly. Their fatigue was gone, their discouragement \nforgotten.\n\nLurton Zimbardo was the last to leave. Now that things were moving in \nthe direction he wanted, he allowed his fatigue to take over. \nEncouraged by the support of his assistants, he felt he could rest at \nlast. He walked down the halls, past various doors and entered an \nelevator. The display screen offered only the few floors in use by the \npirates but Zimbardo had another destination in mind. Alone in the \nelevator, he punched in a special code which only he knew. When the \nproper sequence was displayed, he pressed \"Enter.\" As the elevator \nbegan to move, the new leader of the pirates relaxed even further. The \nothers would not know where he was, and he would be undisturbed.\n\nHe could barely sense the elevator's motion. He didn't know how far \ninto the asteroid's interior he was moving, but he knew what he would \nfind when he reached his destination. The door opened and Zimbardo \nstepped out. A quick walk down a short corridor brought him to a double \ndoor. Embossed on the doors was a huge, rich, golden symbol-a lush \nplanet with about 80% blue oceans, a few continents, and thick cloud \ncover. Three small moons were arranged at the upper left, set at the \npoints of an equilateral triangle. Zimbardo had been intrigued by the \ndesign when he'd first found it, but now he hastened through the doors \nwithout noticing it. He was eager to get into the Chamber beyond.\n\nAs Lurton stepped into the room, he gasped. His dozen prior visits \nstill had not taken the surprise out of the room. Each time he stepped \ninto the Chamber he seemed to be setting foot into another world; he \nknew he was still inside the asteroid but his senses told him otherwise.\n\nLurton seemed to be standing on a high mountain overlooking a vast \nplain on some forgotten planet. A pale blue sky was overhead and a \nlight wind was blowing. Down below on the plain he saw a river snaking \nits way through a green forest; if he listened carefully he could hear \nthe water. In the distance he saw a fantastic alien metropolis of \nbeautiful glass skyscrapers; he could just barely make out ships \nhovering over it and small vehicles driving around in the distance. \nClouds sailed gently overhead; it was near dusk.\n\nHe knew that the room was actually no more than about a hundred feet \nsquare, but the display was seamless. For all the world he seemed to be \nstanding on another planet on a late, peaceful afternoon. He had never \nbeen able to find out how the room worked or where the wind came from, \nbut he suspected the display was generated by some sort of holographic \nprojectors far in advance of anything he had ever seen or heard of.\n\nLurton guessed that the scene was from the home planet of the \nasteroid's builders; perhaps the distant city was their capital. He had \nspent hours watching the room and never tired of it, for the scene \nalways changed. After a certain number of hours dusk fell and the city \nlights came on. He had watched different kinds of weather and seen \nglorious sunsets and sunrises. Occasionally he caught a glimpse of a \nhuge alien starship. He had seen many strange things in the Chamber and \nhe was sure that he had not seen them all.\n\nLurton liked coming here when he was upset or annoyed; the room had a \npeaceful air that rested and soothed him. He was certainly in need of \nthat now. He hadn't slept in over fifty hours and could easily have \nlain down in what seemed like soft turf and fallen deeply asleep, but \nthe ethereal beauty of the Chamber's vision was restful and he didn't \nwant to close his eyes for an instant while he was inside.\n\nHe thought back to the day when he'd found the room. The asteroid had \nbeen drifting and uninhabited for who knows how many thousands of years \nwhen a solitary asteroid miner had found it and discovered that it was \nhollow. He had told a few others about his find and eventually Troy \nPutnam learned of it. Zimbardo grudgingly admitted to himself that Troy \nwas a genius-a weak, impractical genius, but a genius nonetheless. \nPutnam had found the miner and persuaded him to bring him to the \nnearly-invisible asteroid. He had even learned how to use many of the \nasteroid's capabilities, and then had made it the base for his foolish \nattempt to take over Mars.\n\nShortly after the pirates had taken residence, Troy Putnam had directed \nLurton to explore the asteroid beyond the few floors the pirates used \nand find out everything he could about it. It was a trying assignment. \nThe first few floors comprised a connected unit and the elevator codes \nwere easy to learn. Moving anywhere else was a matter of trial and \nerror, and the access codes were complex.\n\nOne day Zimbardo had found the Chamber. There was very little that \ncould arouse any kind of sensitivity in the wiry, energetic man, but \nthe Chamber could do so. Maybe it was because no one else knew about it \nand no one could see him wrapped in the depths of the emotions the room \ncould inspire. The Chamber was not the only secret of the asteroid \nwhich Lurton had retained for himself, but it was certainly the best \none.\n\nAt last the peace and enchantment of the Chamber overcame Lurton's \nresistance to slumber. He sat down and rested with his back against a \ntree, gazing over the landscape at the alien city. The massive trunk \nwas slightly rough but not uncomfortable. Huge roots spread out in all \ndirections before disappearing into the grassy soil. Branches laden \nwith broad leaves made a shadow-filled canopy over the pirate leader.\n\nAs he felt sleep coming on, he fumed one more time at the Starmen and \nthe stupidity of Troy Putnam. He mulled over his plan and smiled a \nlittle. The Starmen would live to regret what they had done to him. His \neyes closed and his breathing became deep and regular. At last the \npirates' new leader slept.\n\nAbove him a few birds chirped peacefully. A short distance away a brook \nmurmured in lyric gentleness. The sky over the city gradually turned \nfrom flawless blue through lavender into violet, and silver stars \nemerged.\n\n\n2: Sent to Ceres\n\nTHE SPLENDOR of the Asteroid Belt stretched away in all directions, and \nthe piercing light of uncountable stars filled the background. Such a \nview was possible only in airless space. Starman David Foster was \nstaring out of the window of his ship, the Star Ranger, but he was not \nreally seeing anything. His brow was furrowed with an uneasy doubt. \n\n\"Still no sign of 'em, Zip,\" announced Joe Taylor. The lanky six-footer \nhad eased naturally into the position of pilot under David's direction. \nJoe had flown everything from ancient biplanes to interplanetary \nrockets. He understood the principles of propulsion and flight, and \nwith amazing facility could learn to fly almost any vehicle designed \nfor traveling through an atmosphere or the vacuum of space.\n\nMark Seaton had naturally become the navigator and engine master of the \nStarman crew. He specialized in engines and large, complex machinery. \nHe had always had a talent for understanding machines, and he knew the \nworkings of the average rocket from stem to stern.\n\nDavid Foster, like all Starmen, was able to navigate and fly his own \nship, but had a specialty in Deep Space exploration and survival \nskills. Whenever he was faced with a problem, he could think it through \nand come up with a solution with the equipment available. He was a \nnatural leader. He excelled at organization and decision-making, and \nJoe and Mark were glad to be a part of the Starman team under Zip's \nleadership.\n\nJoe continued to relate his observations. \"I've scanned as far as the \ninstruments can reach, and there's just nothing out there in any \ndirection-except the Earth ships, of course. They should be here in \nabout three hours.\"\n\n\"No debris?\"\n\n\"No, Zip. I've found where the explosion took place and examined that \nmore carefully than any other area. It was a violent blow. I think \nabout a third of an asteroid was turned into dust when it went off, and \nthat's powerful enough to vaporize any ship that was carrying a weapon \nwith that kind of potential.\"\n\nZip shook his head as if warding off a buzzing insect. \"All right. \nNothing we can do about it.\" He turned to the third Starman on the \ncrew. \"Mark,\" he called out. \"Would you send a report to Mars please \nand ask Commander De Koven what he wants us to do?\"\n\n\"Okay, Zip.\"\n\nMark prepared the message and sent it off. The response would come \nthrough after a delay of several minutes. As they waited, Joe said, \n\"You seem uneasy, Zip. What's there to worry about?\"\n\n\"I just like completion. That ship we were chasing carried the last of \nthe pirates from Mars, and I'd just feel a lot better if there were \nsome debris, some evidence that they hadn't escaped.\"\n\n\"Zip,\" came a deep voice from the lounge next to the flight deck, \n\"there's a lot of uncertainties in life, 'specially life in space. I \nbeen around a lot and believe me, the exception is when you really know \neverything that happened-and that's never.\"\n\n\"Sure, Steve,\" answered Zip, raising his voice. \"I know. But I don't \nlike it.\"\n\n\"You'll probably be uneasy most of your life then. C'mon, be like me. \nLie down, relax, take a nap. You've been rushing for days now, \nespecially the last couple when we were shooting through the void at \ntop speed. Give it up now, boy. You can't do anything more.\"\n\nZip didn't answer, but he walked into the lounge. Steve Cliff was \ncompletely relaxed, with his feet propped on a table. His huge frame \nwas sunk into the sofa deeper than Zip would have thought possible. Zip \npicked up a book that Mark had been reading, and lay down. In less than \na minute, he was asleep with the open book face down on his chest.\n\n\n\n\"Up you go, Zip, it's dinnertime.\" Steve's normally boisterous voice \nwas gentle and almost subdued. Zip took a deep breath and slowly opened \nhis eyes. He sat up, put the book aside and ran his hands through his \nred hair.\n\n\"What's going on?\"\n\n\"You've been out almost four hours. Figured I'd make myself useful so I \nwhipped up some food. Here you go.\" Steve set a tray down on the nearby \ntable. There were mashed potatoes, salad heavy on diced tomatoes just \nthe way Zip liked it, and a few pieces of very thinly sliced roast beef \nin a luscious brown gravy.\n\n\"Looks delicious, Steve; thanks.\"\n\n\"Coffee's coming up in a minute, steaming hot with half a teaspoon of \nsugar.\" Zip reflected for a moment about how little time he had known \nSteve and how well he fit in to the group of three Starmen. Steve \nalready knew how he liked his coffee-hot and fresh-and what his \nfavorite meal was. While he was enjoying the aroma of the meal before \ntucking into it, Steve brought in the coffee.\n\nZip lifted a mouthful of roast beef and potatoes. \"What's going on?\" he \nrepeated.\n\n\"Mark got hold of the big guys in Eagle City, told 'em what was going \non out here. They told us to wait until the Earth forces showed up and \nthen get on back to Mars. We've been under way almost an hour.\" Zip \nnodded.\n\n\"Mark says there's more and wants to talk to you whenever you're ready.\"\n\n\"Send him in.\"\n\nMark came in as Zip put a fork into a chunk of tomato and lifted it out \nof the bowl, dripping with dressing. \"This really is delicious, Steve!\" \nhe called out as Steve disappeared onto the flight deck, leaving the \ntwo Starmen to themselves.\n\n\"Steve told you we're on our way back to Mars, I'm sure,\" said Mark by \nway of preamble. Zip nodded. \"Commander De Koven also said that we are \nto report directly to Mars Base. We drop Steve off at Eagle City and go \nright on to the Base without getting out of the ship.\" Mars Base was \nStarlight Enterprise's headquarters on Mars. It was a huge plant, \ncovering several thousand acres of Martian desert near the north pole \nand far from any other settlement. \n\n\"What's up?\" Zip's gray eyes peered over the rim of the coffee mug as \nhe took a swallow.\n\n\"There's no danger of further attack on Mars-everything seems to be \nsecure in Eagle City-but we're to be given an assignment with a \n'significant time factor,' as the Commander put it. Too sensitive to \nput out over the radio even with scramblers and tight beam.\"\n\n\"They must've learned something from the pirates they captured.\"\n\nJoe peeked around the corner. \"No-I think they're going to give us a \nmedal and a month off for liberating Eagle City!\"\n\n\n\nTwo days later, the Star Ranger was cruising at a good clip a few miles \nabove the Martian desert. Eagle City was behind them, and the course \nwas set almost due north. Mark was reminiscing about the parting with \nSteve.\n\n\"Don't worry about a thing, boys-I'll make sure the little folk get \nback to the Moon safely enough.\" Steve was referring to Jack and Jill, \nthe diminutive citizens of Titan who had played a critical role in \nrescuing Eagle City from the pirates during their assault on Mars.\n\nMark felt very badly that he hadn't been able to see the Titanians. \nFour days before, they had left Mars without notice to begin the \nfrantic chase of the escaping pirates, and now they were urgently \ncalled to Mars Base with no time permitted to see their friends. \nPersonal relationships were important to Mark. As the Star Ranger \nreturned to Mars from the Asteroid Belt, he had made a recorded \ngreeting and farewell for Jack and Jill and entrusted it to Steve. Mark \nwas beginning to realize that for him, the life of a Starman would be \nmarked with frequent partings and sorrows.\n\nThe always-ebullient Joe did not seem to be affected. \"Don't worry \nabout it, we'll see them again. They'll understand. Right now we're off \non another adventure!\"\n\nAs the Star Ranger approached the pole, Mark shifted his mood and hoped \nthat Joe would be right.\n\n\"Oooh, yes! Look at that!\" exulted Joe, pointing out of the front of \nthe ship. A light came over the horizon like a flame too bright to be \nlooked at comfortably. The sun was reflecting off the glass-sheathed \nbuildings of Mars Base, Starlight Enterprise's primary headquarters on \nthe fourth planet.\n\nAs the Star Ranger rapidly closed the distance, Mark radioed for \nlanding clearance.\n\n\"Gorgeous!\" said Joe. From the pilot's seat he could make out the \nairport, the hangar, the sprawling laboratory and research buildings \nand the manufacturing centers. Men, robots, and machines scurried \naround the plant. Security was very high; ever since the pirate attack \nSE had redoubled its efforts to keep out unauthorized personnel. This \nwas the area from which Starlight Enterprise conducted its Martian \noperations.\n\nImmediately after landing, the Starmen were brought into a spacious \noffice. As they entered, a clean-shaven man with a rather long crew cut \nlooked up.\n\n\"Mr. Konig!\" exclaimed Zip as he led the little parade into the central \nportion of the complex. \"I sure didn't expect to see you here!\" Konig \nwas in charge of security throughout the entire SE system.\n\n\"Welcome to the Base, Starmen!\" Konig stood up and came around his desk \nto greet each of them with a warm, two-handed handshake. He was a \ngenial man, large but by no means overweight, very strong, firm, and of \nalmost regal bearing. He gave the impression of being always available \nand affable, but never to be taken for granted. \n\n\"Sit down,\" he continued. \"What I have to say is of vital importance \nand I'm afraid we don't have time to do more than get you briefed on \nthe situation. I can't even take the time to commend you for the \noutstanding work you did against the pirates. Richard is busting with \npride over his newest Starmen! I can't say I blame him-you did \nmarvelous work! You three are wanted on Earth for some special \nrecognition, but unfortunately we have a brief mission for you first.\"\n\n\"Richard\" was Richard Starlight, the head of Starlight Enterprise who \nhad entrusted Mark and Joe with their Martian assignment.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Konig,\" responded Zip simply.\n\n\"The pirates only had a few men placed here at the Base, but they were \nenough to shut down operations for the few days they needed to paralyze \nEagle City. Frankly, it was a surprise for us and Richard wanted me to \ntake personal charge of security on Mars until it was quite clear that \nthe threat was past. Actually, I flew in with the invasion fleet. My \nmost important assignment here is to set up a secret base for Starlight \nEnterprise, which will be a backup and defense unit prepared for any \nevents such as the one we've just experienced.\"\n\n\"A secret base?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'll be looking for the best site, recruiting the right people to \nman it, and drawing up plans for construction and the tasks it will \nhave to perform. I don't need to tell you that the project is highly \nconfidential. I'm only telling you about it because you're Starmen, and \nit will be a resource you'll need to become familiar with. Of course, \nthere will be much more information coming your way later.\"\n\nOritz Konig spoke cleanly and clearly, but gave the [DB1]impression \nthat his thoughts were racing faster than he could speak. He had had to \ndiscipline himself to speak so that others could follow him. There were \nfew wasted words when he had to get a message across, but he was able \nto converse in a way that assured his listeners that he valued them as \npeople and needed their cooperation. Konig manifested an extremely rare \ncombination of being a \"people person\" as well as having a supremely \ndisciplined and task-oriented mind.\n\n\"We interrogated the pirates while you were in the Asteroid Belt. We \nstarted with Troy Putnam, of course, but he won't say a word. He's got \na strange kind of strength to him-genial in a lot of ways, but utterly \ninflexible and unbreakable when he doesn't want to cooperate.\n\n\"We questioned other pirate leaders, too, of course, and a lot of the \nrank and file. Not all of them cooperated, but enough did that we \nlearned that they have a base in the Belt. It's no ordinary base. Most \nof the pirates don't know its origin but they can describe what it \nlooks like.\n\n\"It's a fairly good-sized chunk of hard stone, mostly iron. It's \nhollow, and the base is inside. The access port is concealed. More to \nthe point, it cannot be detected by radar.\n\n\"Some of the toughest of the pirates sneered that we'd never find \nit-that it couldn't be seen even if you were right on top of it.\"\n\nJoe jumped in. \"But sir, this technology is not new. There have been \ncraft since the late twentieth century that were invisible to radar. \nThere are other ways to find them-gravitational influences, to name \none.\"\n\n\"Of course, Starman Taylor. This asteroid, however, appears to be the \nwork of some advanced race, other than Earth. The pirates didn't create \nit-they took it over. Its sheathing system is highly effective, highly \neffective indeed. The pirates could be lying, of course, but once the \nword got out to them that we knew about the asteroid, most of them \nseemed to swell with a kind of arrogant pride, even welcoming the fact \nthat we had the information. They were confident that we couldn't do \nanything about it.\"\n\n\"And that explains, I'm sure, why we couldn't find them in spite of an \nexceedingly thorough search of the area,\" concluded David Foster, \nfeeling somewhat vindicated.\n\n\"So are we to go find the asteroid?\" put forth Joe, leaning forward in \nhis chair.\n\n\"No, Mr. Taylor. We want you to find the man who discovered it.\"\n\nJoe leaned back into his chair, a puzzled look on his face. Oritz Konig \ncontinued.\n\n\"The asteroid was discovered almost twenty years ago by an asteroid \nminer named George St. George. He's a loner, like so many of the \nasteroid miners. He makes a good living, but has no fixed address. He's \nconstantly on the move and spends most of his time away from \nsettlements in the Belt. He'll disappear for months, maybe a year or \ntwo-then show up on Ceres or in Eagle City with what he has found in \nthe Belt and turn it into cash and supplies. Then he's gone again.\n\n\"Apparently he discovered this remarkable asteroid the pirates took \nover. He's a trusting, almost na\u00c2\u0095ve, decent man. He spoke unguardedly \nabout his find at one time and Troy Putnam learned about it. Putnam had \nSt. George take him to the asteroid and paid him a good price for the \nknowledge. St. George showed Putnam where it was, and then disappeared \ninto the Belt. Putnam went on to build his empire of pirates.\"\n\n\"And now you want us to find St. George so he can show us where the \nasteroid is,\" inferred Zip.\n\n\"It's not that simple, Starman. We've also learned that the pirates who \nescaped are the most dangerous of the lot. Their leader is a very bad \nnumber named Lurton Zimbardo. The pirates were willing to obey Troy \nPutnam because he encouraged them. They liked him. He was a charismatic \nleader who gave them visions of grandeur and made them think that they \ncould pull off the impossible. But they are afraid of Zimbardo-for good \nreason, from what we hear. He is a merciless, calculating spaceman, \npatiently willing to play second-in-command to Putnam while waiting for \nhis chance to take over. That chance has now come.\n\n\"The pirates are greatly reduced in number now, but those who are left \nare extremely dangerous. They will be fierce, uncompromising enemies. \nSt. George is the only person outside of the pirates who knows where \nthe asteroid is, how to find it, and has some knowledge of how it \nworks. Where Putnam was willing to let St. George go about his \nbusiness, Zimbardo will certainly determine to eliminate him. Zimbardo \nwill try hard to find St. George. You must find him first. Protect him, \nand learn from him where the asteroid is.\"\n\n\"What do we know about him? How can he be found?\" asked Zip.\n\n\"He hasn't been heard from for over a year, and he could be anywhere in \nthe Belt. But he has a friend named Montezuma Vly. If anyone knows \nwhere St. George is, Vly will know-and we know where Vly is.\"\n\n\"Why not just ask Vly where St. George is?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"That's where your assignment begins,\" answered Konig. \"Like St. \nGeorge, Montezuma Vly is an asteroid miner. Unlike St. George, he \ndoesn't wander far from his home. But Vly has a deep distrust of any \nauthority figures. He lives on an asteroid he calls Montezuma's Castle. \nHe claimed it over thirty years ago and enjoys his privacy. No \ngovernment officials have any right to enter his domain. He is \ncompletely independent. We're hoping that where officialdom can't act, \nyou young Starmen can. When he knows that George St. George is at risk, \nI'm sure he'll help you.\"\n\n\"Where do we find Montezuma Vly?\" asked Mark, who was the navigator for \nthe trio of Starmen.\n\n\"Montezuma's Castle is not far from Ceres. You can get to Vly in less \nthan a day from Yellow City.\" Yellow City was the major center on \nCeres, the largest and most important asteroid in the system, with a \npopulation of around 100,000. It doubled as a spaceport, and was a \nstopping-over and refueling point on the long voyage between the Inner \nand Outer Planets.\n\n\"Go to Ceres first and check in there. Since the pirates will be \nsearching for St. George, you'll have to conduct your search \nquietly-using the Star Ranger and wearing Starman's red uniforms won't \ndo on this assignment. You'll need to change ships and clothes in \nYellow City.  The rest of the information you'll need will be provided \nfor you in files which you can read as you travel.\"\n\n\n\nLurton Zimbardo called his five most trusted leaders to a meeting in \none of the libraries on the pirates' asteroid. Each was dressed in the \ngray and black uniform that Troy Putnam had designed for the pirates \nfor their failed mission to take over Mars. The meeting had been going \non for several hours and had involved a lot of detailed organizational \nwork. The men were tired and showing it. As usual, Zimbardo showed no \nsigns of fatigue.\n\n\"Yes, gentlemen,\" said Zimbardo, \"You know what to do now. We will need \nto get all of our men busy and you must drive them, drive them \nrelentlessly! I don't want to take any longer on this work than we need \nto. We've been moving slowly out of the Asteroid Belt for almost three \ndays.\"\n\nHis laser pointer made a few small red circles on a chart in the \nlibrary. \"This is where we were, and this is where we're going to be.\" \nThe chart was nearly a full wall of smooth quartz, illumined from the \ninside and showing the nearby configuration of asteroids.\n\nThe table was strewn with large books opened to star maps, note pads, a \ncouple of small computers and calculating machines, and a huge number \nof crumpled balls of paper. One man reached for a pitcher of water that \nwas on the table and slowly filled his glass. Zimbardo continued.\n\n\"The manufacturing will begin tomorrow-that'll be for Stubb to oversee. \nOnce the sheathing device has proven effective we can begin work on \nrestoring and disguising our fleet. After that, Crass, you'll take care \nof the rest.\"\n\nOne of the men looked up. \"What about St. George? If anyone discovers \nhim he could put a serious crimp in our plans.\"\n\nZimbardo looked annoyed. \"St. George will be dealt with, Mr. Slant. I \nhave not forgotten him; you can leave that to me. He will never speak \nto the Starmen or anyone else.\"\n\nAnother spoke. \"Is it really necessary to silence him? It will take a \nlarge number of men to make a search-men we could use on the urgent \nprojects at hand. Since you've moved the asteroid from its original \nsite, he can't find us now or show anyone else how to find us.\"\n\n\"He can't find us, but he knows how this asteroid works-almost as well \nas I do. If the Starmen learn what he knows, it could be disastrous for \nus in the unlikely chance that they ever locate us. I don't like taking \nchances, and I don't like leaving any loose ends. St. George is a loose \nend we can't afford.\" \n\n\"Do you know where to find him? He doesn't have any fixed place he \ncalls home.\"\n\n\"Our men have quietly inquired for him on Ceres and learned that he has \na good friend, another asteroid miner named Montezuma Vly. We know \nwhere Vly lives, and Vly will know where St. George is. Vly doesn't \nreceive visitors, but his resistance won't keep a small fleet from \nlanding. One way or another, Vly will tell us where to find George St. \nGeorge-and soon.\"\n\n\n3: Montezuma's Castle\n\nA FEW DAYS later, Lurton Zimbardo decided to take a tour of the \nworkshops and check on progress. Where Troy Putnam's organization had \nbeen large, easy-going, and confident, Zimbardo's was tight, \nhighly-organized, and ruthless. Its high degree of efficiency was \ndependent almost exclusively on Zimbardo himself. Once Zimbardo had \nasserted his control over the organization, the asteroid and its crew \nhad rapidly become an extension of his formidable personality.\n\nHe took an elevator from his suite down to the main floor of the \norganizational complex and stepped out into the hallway. He walked with \na firm tread, and men stepped aside with a slight deferential bow. He \npassed through the great glass doors at the end of the passage into a \nhuge foyer. Passing through, he entered a courtyard, strode across it, \nand came into the working area.\n\nAbout sixty men were working at various stations. The men felt that \nZimbardo was a real leader and were glad to see their new commander. It \nwas amazing how rapidly the sense of defeat had been changed to one of \nexpectancy and pride. \n\nEvery day or two another ship docked and new workers came in to join \nthe crew. Zimbardo had sent out a few trusted leaders to recruit men \nform noted asteroid bases and mining operations in the proximity of his \nasteroid. He could use more men, especially skilled workers in \nelectronics and mathematics, but he wasn't eager to build up a large \nforce. He chose carefully. The workforce was being built up gradually \nwith men he could trust. He had also invited three smugglers he had \nknown before to join the operation, with their men.\n\n\"Stubb,\" called out Zimbardo.\n\n\"Sir,\" responded the man so addressed, an eager man about thirty years \nold, with sandy blond hair and baby blue eyes. He hastened up to the \npirate leader.\n\n\"Give me a status report. The ships first.\"\n\n\"The sheathing systems are easy to manufacture, thanks to the ample \nsupplies from the warehouses. The men are able to put them together \nrapidly, even the unskilled workers, since they just need a master \ncircuit to copy. I have forty men working on these, with the skilled \nelectricians checking each plate. As you know, we completed work on ten \nships six days ago; they were tested and went out on their assignments. \nThey have not returned yet. These plates we're working on now are going \non the remaining ships, and we have already finished work on four of \nthem. That leaves just three to go, including the ship that just joined \nthe crew yesterday. We should be finished by tomorrow afternoon.\"\n\n\"Good. And the power units?\"\n\n\"These are far more complicated, sir, so I only have the most skilled \nworkers assembling these. The same with the propulsion units. They \nwon't be ready for at least a week, not even one of them. However, once \nwe get the prototype finished the rest should follow rapidly.\"\n\n\"How long until you have all 85 completed?\"\n\n\"I should have a good number of the unskilled workers ready for a new \nassignment once they have finished with the sheathing plates. Once the \ndesign has been checked by the experts, we can get them cracking on the \npower and propulsion units. Of course, each unit will have to be tested \nby the experts, so I would estimate that all 85 can be operational \nwithin ten days-unless we run into any problems.\"\n\n\"Good work, Mr. Stubb. I will check on progress every day.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir.\" The man went back to work and Zimbardo returned to \nthe main complex. \n\n\n\nCeres was the hub of the Asteroid Belt. Nearly 600 miles across, it was \nthe largest body in the ring of planetary debris that swirled and \nturned in a large swath between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. It was \nthe place where professional miners first arrived from Earth before \ntheir companies farmed them out to the mining centers on various \nasteroids. Independent asteroid miners came to Ceres once in a while \nfor supplies, and corporations picked up equipment imported daily from \nMars. Ceres, located several days' travel from the nearest sizable \npopulation center, was a buzz of activity.\n\nThe Star Ranger approached the large asteroid after a fast but \nuneventful journey of six days.\n\n\"Quite a cloud of starships!\" remarked Joe as Yellow City came into \nview. A swarm of at least forty ships of an amazing variety of sizes, \nshapes, and vintages was moving over the port. Some were hovering, \nothers were heading in toward the landing field and a few others were \ndeparting. None moved very fast since the space was as crowded as bees \naround a hive.\n\nYellow City was a well planned settlement, in spite of having been \ndeveloped jointly by several different mining companies. Although the \ncompetition was fierce for the rich minerals of the Belt, cooperation \nwas necessary to build the city, especially in the earliest years of \nsettlement. The result was beneficial to all, as Yellow City could \neasily supply the needs of miners of all kinds as well as serve the \ntraffic to the Outer Planets that almost always came by way of Ceres. \nAdvancements in propulsion systems were making it possible for some of \nthe newer ships to bypass Yellow City on their way to Jupiter and \nbeyond, but Ceres was still a major stopping point.\n\nZip spoke quietly to Mark. \"Mark, please let them know that we would \nlike to land.\"\n\nMark opened the microphone. \"Starman Mark Seaton on the starship Star \nRanger requesting permission to land.\"\n\nThe response was immediate. \"Yes sir, Starman! Ceres is proud to \nwelcome you!\" The operator went on to give directions for landing.\n\n\"Why is he so deferential?\" queried Mark after communications had been \ncompleted.\n\n\"We're famous!\" responded Zip. \"We've been aboard ship since the end of \nthe attempted takeover on Mars and haven't kept up with the news, but \nwe've become household names. Oritz Konig told me that just as we were \nleaving the Base. We're the men who liberated Mars! The people in the \nBelt are especially pleased since the pirates had planned to blockade \nthem once they had a strong hold on Eagle City. Why, you couldn't find \nanother place in the Solar System that'd be happier to see us than \nYellow City!\"\n\nThe Star Ranger was given priority docking. Once its engines were shut \ndown, a large crew ran to secure it and welcome the Starmen. As Zip, \nMark, and Joe descended the ladder, eager hands reached up to help them \ndown the last two or three rungs. Through the bubble helmets on their \nsuits, the mechanics and service personnel were all smiles.\n\nWhen Zip inquired about the offices of Starlight Enterprise, the \nStarmen were ushered to a small moonbus and driven directly to the \nsite. The complex was a small two-story building set in a row of \noffices, workshops, and garages not far from the landing field. All \nbuildings on Ceres were made of the gray rock native to the asteroid. \nBuilding material was cheap and solid, but plain.\n\nAlthough the city itself was covered with an atmosphere dome, the SE \noffice was located close to the landing field, not within the city \nproper. Entrance was through an airlock. Once through the airlock, the \nStarmen removed their helmets and placed them on the rack.\n\n\"Whoopee! This is fun, being famous!\" exclaimed Joe, his eyes alight. \n\"I hope it lasts until we get back to the Earth-Moon system! I'd like \nto enjoy it!\"\n\n\"I hope so, too, for all our sakes. Your exploits have given all the \nStarmen a good name!\" Joe whirled. \n\n\"Kathryn Mullaney!\" cried Joe. Mark and Zip smiled widely.\n\n\"What are you doing on Ceres, Kathryn?\" asked Zip. \"I haven't seen you \nsince your last visit to the Academy at the beginning of our senior \nyear.\" Kathryn Mullaney had graduated from Starlight Academy a year \nbefore Zip and his partners; her first assignment as a Starman was in \nthe Outer Planets. She was twenty years old, wore her strawberry blond \nhair short, and had a few freckles spangled across her nose below blue \neyes which had a touch of green in them.\n\n\"Finished my assignment on Ganymede and I'm coming back home for a \nleave which I hope will be very long! I spent eight months in the \nsmallest population center in the Solar System, and can't wait to get \nback where there are crowds of people! I'm just staying here long \nenough for a quick once-over on my ship, refueling, and then I'm \nEarth-bound. In fact, I'm on my way out now.\"\n\nThere was a little more pleasant conversation, then Kathryn said, \"I've \ngot to be going, and Sim is waiting for you upstairs. Good luck!\"\n\nZip, Mark, and Joe ascended the stairs and came to the landing. The \nstairway and corridors were very plain. There was no unnecessary \nornamentation of any kind, and lighting was minimal. They found a door \nwith a sign on it that read STARLIGHT ENTERPRISE in bold letters. A \nsecond line provided the name of SE's resident operations officer on \nCeres: \"Sim Sala Bim.\" Joe knocked.\n\n\"Come in,\" said a voice. The Starmen entered the door. The occupant, a \ntall, slender man of Indian extraction with black thinning hair, was \nalready coming toward the door to welcome his visitors. \"Welcome! So \nglad to see you! Welcome, please come in!\" He ushered them into the \nroom.\n\n\"Nice to see you again, Sim,\" greeted Zip. They sat down in a circle of \nchairs, Sim sitting near a table on which were placed all the makings \nnecessary for tea. There were already two cups set out, which had been \nused recently. Sim took one for himself and set the other aside. \"This \nwas Kathryn's,\" he said as he produced three new cups for his visitors. \n\"You probably passed her on your way in.\"\n\nThe conversation continued as Sim poured the tea from a very large \nbrown earthenware teapot. Before long, Zip brought up the subject of \ntheir visit.\n\n\"I wish we had more time to visit, Sim, but our assignment is extremely \nurgent. We must find George St. George as fast as possible, and Oritz \nhas told us that only a miner named Montezuma Vly can tell us where he \nis. We're on our way to Montezuma's Castle.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Sim Sala Bim, \"Sabbath George. He is well known here, \nbut we haven't seen him in almost a year, I think. Almost a year.\"\n\n\"Sabbath George?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"George St. George is a devout man-genial, generous, liked and \nrespected by everyone. Honest to a fault. He's called Sabbath George \nbecause of his beliefs. The nickname is intended to kid him a little \nbit, but is really meant as a term of respect and affection. But to \nfind him in short order, you will indeed have to go through Montezuma \nVly. Montezuma's Castle is not hard to find, but getting in will be \ndifficult.\"\n\n\"We are familiar with Mr. Vly's convictions and we wouldn't bother him \nif there were any other way to find St. George. Given the time \nconstraints, we have no choice.\"\n\nSim nodded. \"Montezuma's Castle is easily recognizable by its unusual \nshape. It is a true crescent, a sliver of stone with Vly's operation in \nits very center.\" Sim went on to provide its coordinates and other \ninformation the Starmen would need to find it.\n\nZip continued. \"On this assignment secrecy is of the utmost importance. \nIt is vital that no one knows who we are or what we're doing. We \nobviously can't take the Star Ranger, as the news media have made that \nship easily recognizable. We learned that when we landed on Ceres. I \nthink we're going to need to use another ship.\"\n\nWith Sim, the Starmen made plans to leave the Star Ranger on Ceres \nwhile the Starmen, dressed in ordinary clothes, quietly departed for \nMontezuma's Castle in another ship.\n\n\"I'll let you have the Vigilant Warrior,\" said Sim. \"It's a local ship, \ndesigned for operating in the Asteroid Belt. We own it, but it hasn't \nbeen used in a while and probably no one will recognize it as an SE \nship. It's the best I can do on short notice, but it should serve you \nwell.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it'll be fine, if you say so,\" answered Zip.\n\nSim Sala Bim got right to work, and the Vigilant Warrior was ready for \ntakeoff within two hours. As soon as it was ready, the Starmen lifted \noff from Yellow City. As Joe piloted the ship into the heart of the \nBelt, Zip looked back for a brief, wistful moment and saw the unusual \ndark red color of the Star Ranger, his ship, on the field of Yellow \nCity.\n\n\n\n \"That's it,\" said Mark, as the navigation equipment locked onto the \nasteroid that was the home of the elusive Montezuma Vly. \n\n\"Hmmm. No wonder it's so hard to find,\" observed Zip, looking over \nMark's shoulder for a moment. \"Not far from major travelways but so \nunobtrusive you'd never notice it.\"\n\n\"It just hovers almost in the shadow of that large, worthless chunk \nhere. Should be able to see it out the window before too long.\"\n\nJoe was busy threading the Vigilant Warrior through the asteroids for \nthe next few minutes. He kept the ship at a moderate pace and passed \neasily around the slowly turning asteroids. They were all moving at \nabout the same speed and maneuvering was not difficult.\n\n\"Should be coming up on it about now,\" offered Mark.\n\n\"There it is,\" said Zip almost immediately. The Vigilant Warrior had \neased its way around an oblong worldlet-the \"large, worthless chunk\" \nthat Mark had just mentioned-bringing into view a crescent-shaped, \nstony asteroid about a mile long. It looked almost like a fat banana \nwith the ends tapering into sharp points.\n\n\"Montezuma's Castle,\" breathed Zip. \"Kind of looks like a moon for that \nlarge asteroid.\"\n\n\"I think it is,\" answered Mark. \"It rotates around the larger chunk and \nthe two make almost a helix pattern in their journey through the Belt. \nThey were probably a single asteroid at one time. One powerful impact \nmust have split them, but the pieces haven't drifted far apart.\"\n\n\"Well, let's get down there. There's no mistaking the shape of the \n'Castle.' Whatever odd shapes you can find in the Belt, that's got to \nbe unique.\" The Starman brought the Vigilant Warrior slowly into the \nproximity of Montezuma Vly's refuge. \"See if you can raise him, Mark.\"\n\nMark Seaton flipped on the communicator.\n\n\"Starman Mark Seaton on the starship Vigilant Warrior calling Montezuma \nVly on the Castle, requesting permission to land.\" His voice was \nsmooth, intimate, and confident. There was no response. A minute later, \nMark repeated the message. The metallic voice of an automatic response \nsystem came on.\n\n\"This asteroid is private property and visitors are not welcome.\"\n\n\"We understand that, sir,\" Mark replied, \"and we would not request \npermission to land if it were not a matter of urgent business of \npersonal concern.\" A human voice came on.\n\n\"Yeah, like I haven't heard that one before! I don't want visitors! If \nI wanted a social calendar, I'd go live in a big population center like \nGanymede. Keep going! Next services are 3,000 miles away.\"\n\n\"Mr. Vly, this is Starman David Foster, Commander of the Starlight \nEnterprise ship Vigilant Warrior,\" Zip broke in. \"We understand and \nrespect your reluctance to receive visitors and will stay no longer \nthan necessary. We are calling on you because your friend George St. \nGeorge has information we need which is vital to the safety of all the \nsettlements on Mars and even the Earth-Moon system. We also believe it \npossible that he is in danger from violent men.\"\n\n\"Well, that's a new one. George in danger? What about it?\"\n\n\"May we land, Mr. Vly? I don't want to take the slightest risk that our \nconversation can be overheard. We won't stay any longer than necessary.\"\n\n\"You've found me. May as well come in and state your business.\" The \ncommunicator was shut off from Vly's end.\n\nZip came up on the Castle. It didn't take long to find the landing \nsite. There were two spacecraft in position in about the middle of the \nasteroid. One was a small ship suitable for local jaunts, and the other \nwas a normal-sized craft capable of interplanetary travel. The name \nSentinel was painted on the side of the larger craft. Both were very \nold and in places a little battered, but were clearly cared about and \nwell kept up.\n\nThe Vigilant Warrior touched down about fifty yards from the closest of \nVly's craft. Joe shut off the engines and pressed the security button. \nA slight shudder ran through the ship as bolts shot from the fins, \nsecuring the ship to the surface. The Starmen disembarked and descended \nthe ladder.\n\n\"Over there,\" pointed Joe. The entrance to the airlock was discernible \nacross the tiny landing area. The Starmen began walking toward it. The \nstarfield swept away to right and left, with a couple of nearby \nasteroids visible to the eye. A great horn of stone rose up before \nthem, sweeping to a point above. Behind them a similar horn curved up \nin the opposite direction.\n\nThe ground was uneven, with contours sharply defined. Jagged, broken \nrock comprised most of the terrain, with a few smooth ripples which \nrose about twenty or thirty feet from the plain. Shadows were utterly \ndark in the vacuum of space. The Starmen wore asteroid shoes, designed \nfor walking in low gravity conditions. Their soles had an automatic \n\"smart grip\" function that gripped the ground when weight was placed on \nthem, but released when the walker took another step. Without the \nasteroid shoes, the minimal gravity of \"Montezuma's Castle\" would have \nmade walking a difficult, even dangerous, task.\n\nThe Starmen saw that the airlock was set into the side of a hill. The \nhill had been artificially cut away in front of the door. As Zip, Mark, \nand Joe approached the airlock, the outer door opened. When they had \npassed through, it shut behind them. Joe kept watch on the instruments \nas air filled the compartment. When the atmosphere had become normal, \nhe removed his helmet, and Zip and Mark followed suit. They opened the \nsecond door and passed through. A dimly-lit stairway led down in front \nof them. About twenty-five steps brought them to the beginning of a \nshort passageway. At the end was another door. It was solid.\n\nZip approached the door and paused. He turned his head to the other \ntwo, lifted his eyebrows and shrugged. Mark and Joe nodded. Zip \nknocked. The door was opened almost immediately.\n\nA good-looking, clean-shaven man with dark brown wavy hair looked them \nover once quickly, then stepped aside. \"Come in,\" he said, waving a \nhand while the other held the door. \"I'm Montezuma Vly.\" He had \npowerful hands, obviously used to hard labor. His nails had grit under \nthem. Strong as the hands were, they were also clearly the hands of an \nartist, capable of fine work. He shook hands with the Starmen as they \nentered.\n\n\"Wow!\" said Joe, the last to enter. Vly shut the door. The three \nStarmen gazed about them. They were standing in a small room packed \nwith machinery-old-fashioned machinery used for rock cutting, polishing \nstones, and mounting specimens. The heady smell of machine oil hung in \nthe air, not heavy like that of an aircraft hangar but attractive and \nenergizing, almost like a perfume.\n\nThe machinery was made of cast iron, with wheels and gears, rods and \nchains visible inside the cases. Mark noted that each machine looked \nlovingly maintained. The newest machine must have been at least fifty \nyears old, but all were in top quality condition.\n\n\"They're made to be used,\" explained Vly, discerning their thoughts. \n\"You can't get better machines than these today. The new stuff doesn't \nlast and can't be depended on.\"\n\nMark, the engine master of the trio, immediately thought of the \nprecision instruments produced by Starlight Enterprise. He opened his \nmouth, but said nothing. He knew that SE made quality machinery, but \nlittle of it was iron. He didn't want to make a fool of himself by \ntalking about something of which he knew little. Instead he smiled and \ndecided to take a closer look.\n\nHe leaned over the closest apparatus. His mild skepticism quickly \nturned to awe. \"My goodness, Mr. Vly! This is incredible! These \nmachines are beautiful!\" Vly didn't smile, but his face softened a \nlittle.\n\nJoe and Zip were looking around the room. On two walls were hung \nvarious hand tools. Several shelves held cans of oil and paint, boxes \nof supplies, and dozens of samples of minerals and crystals. The other \ntwo walls were lined with books, half of them behind glass. \n\nZip turned his head to the side to read the titles of some of the \nbooks. He saw The Complete Works of William Shakespeare; Kon Tiki by \nThor Heyerdahl; Homer's Odyssey; and several advanced textbooks on \nmineralogy, metallurgy, engineering, and electronics. Zip's eyebrows \nlifted. He was impressed.\n\nMark was looking at the books on the other wall. Basic Watercolor, he \nread. The Stories of Edgar Allen Poe was next to The Life of Johann \nSebastian Bach. Mark whistled. \"Not what I expected, Mr. Vly,\" he said. \n\"Not at all what I expected.\"\n\n\"Uh huh,\" murmured Montezuma Vly. \"Let's get down to business. Follow \nme.\" He squeezed past Zip in the crowded little workplace, passed \nthrough a narrow door on the other side of the room, and through a \npassageway. The Starmen followed.\n\nA small furry shape leaped through the air in front of Joe. \"Ack!\" \nexclaimed the lanky Starman, stumbling backward, knocking over a couple \nof small boxes as his arms flailed. Nuts and bolts scattered on the \nfloor. Joe backed into another box and sat down hard on it.\n\n\"What-?\" exclaimed Vly, turning.\n\n\"What was that?\" cried Joe. \"Something jumped across the corridor. I \nthink it went into this recess here.\" He pointed to an opening between \na few stacked boxes.\n\n\"One of my koalangs,\" answered Montezuma. \"I've got four of them here. \nThere are a few more in the living quarters. Good company. They can \nstartle you, though, and they can make an awful mess. More than once \nI've threatened to make stew out of 'em and eat 'em for dinner.\" The \nStarmen looked at one another, wondering if he was joking. His next \naction showed that he was.\n\n\"Come on, Howard,\" said Montezuma gently, bending over and calling into \nthe dark place where the koalang had hidden. \"They won't hurt you. I \nknow you're not used to company, but no one's gonna hurt you. Come on \nout. That's it, come on.\" He reached in gently and drew a small \ncreature out of the darkness. It had a small furry face with large, \nfrightened eyes, and snuggled up against the miner. Its fur was caramel \nand white. He folded it into his chest and covered it gently with both \nhands. He crooned to it lovingly for a moment or two, then said, \n\"That's right. You're okay. Go play.\" Then he added with mock \nfierceness, \"Just stay out of the paint!\" He set it down and turned \nback to the door at the end of the corridor.\n\n\"In here,\" he directed, leading the way into the room beyond.\n\n\n4: Sabbath George\n\nTHE ROOM was smaller than the Starmen had anticipated. Its small size \nwas accentuated by being packed to the ceiling with a variety of items. \nHand tools identical to those used by rock hounds for centuries lay on \ntables and on shelves. Stacks of paper, most of which showed signs of \nbeing bound by hand, covered much of the remaining space. On one shelf \nwas a large, clear sphere on an ornately shaped stand. The eyes of all \nthree Starmen were drawn to it.\n\n\"Have a seat,\" offered their host.\n\nThere were three chairs. Montezuma sat in one placed before a desk and \nswiveled to face his visitors. Zip and Joe took the other chairs and \nMark sat on a short stack of crates filled with rock samples. A thick \nbook rested on a table in the center of the room. Mark glanced at the \ntitle, turning his head slightly to do so. It was The Flying Carpet, by \nRichard Halliburton. There was a bookmark about halfway through the \nbook.\n\nThe asteroid miner leaned forward. \"What about George?\" he asked.\n\nZip filled him in. Montezuma Vly paid close attention. His eyes never \nwavered from Zip's face as he spoke. When Zip was finished, Vly nodded.\n\n\"Mm hmm,\" he murmured. \"This could be bad for George. I'll tell you \nwhere to find him. I expect that you'll be able to keep him out of the \nclutches of the space vultures. You've got an enemy to be reckoned with \nin this Zimbardo psychopath, but I believe you can handle him.\"\n\n\"You seem to know a lot about our recent exploits, Mr. Vly,\" said Joe, \nconversationally.\n\n\"I'm not the complete recluse people think, Mr. Taylor. People have a \nlot of wrong ideas about me. I don't want to be listed in the Register \nof Peoples, and I don't want people butting into my business or telling \nme how to live, but I keep up with the news. If I hadn't recognized \nyou, you wouldn't have been allowed to land on my asteroid. You're not \nwearing Starman's red, you know.\"\n\n\"We're grateful to you, Mr. Vly,\" nodded Zip.\n\n\"May I ask-\" began Mark, then hesitated.\n\n\"Yes, you may ask. Go on.\"\n\nMark turned his head toward the sphere. \"The sphere...\"\n\n\"Oh yes. It's pure crystal, all right.\"\n\nThe Starmen gasped. \"Pure...crystal...?\" stammered Mark. \"Why, there \ncan't be a larger one in the Solar System! It's priceless!\"\n\n\"Next largest was in the Smithsonian Institution, a little more than \ntwelve inches in diameter. This one's sixteen and three-quarters \ninches. Found it myself on Adamant-that's the parent asteroid from \nwhich this sliver I live on was busted off a few millennia ago.\" Mark \nknew he was referring to what he had called a \"worthless chunk\" before \nthey landed.\n\nVly went on. \"Shaped it myself in those old machines you saw coming in \nhere. Had to redesign some of 'em to fit a crystal this size, but we \ndid it.\"\n\n\"It looks flawless!\" breathed Joe.\n\n\"Looks it, but isn't. Its flaws are its greatest treasure. Watch this; \nyou haven't seen anything yet.\" Vly picked up a small cutting tool with \na laser guide at the end. He turned off the lights and then pointed the \nlaser at the crystal sphere. The beam struck the surface and then \nscattered throughout the interior of the globe, igniting sparks of \nspectacular glory. Mark could feel tears come into his eyes from the \nunearthly beauty the light created. Many dozens of flakes, invisible to \nthe naked eye, were revealed when the laser beam pierced the \nnear-perfect sphere. They exploded in glorious colors-gold, orange, \ndeep red, flaming yellow, silver; even a few brilliant green, deep \nblue, and violet sparks traced across the inner world.\n\nThe Starmen were speechless. They couldn't take their eyes off the \nresplendent glory of the sphere under the laser light. \"Beautiful, \nisn't it?\" asked Vly, gently. There was no need to answer.\n\n\"Where do the colors come from?\" asked Mark. \"Laser light has only one \nwavelength, so it can't be refracting in there.\"\n\n\"The crystal's impurities are almost invisible to the unaided eye,\" \nanswered Vly, \"but the laser hits the impurities and causes secondary \nemissions of light of all sorts of color-the more impurities, the more \ncolors. It lights up better than a fire opal.\"\n\nAs he moved the laser beam slowly around the globe, the interior lights \nchanged-first one, then another \"flaw\" taking the light and surging \ninto radiance.\n\nAll too soon, he switched off the laser and turned the room lights back \non. It was almost as if a spell had been broken.\n\n\"C'mon,\" he said. \"I'll show you just where George is on the chart.\" He \nmoved back down the hall, the Starmen following. When they were back in \nthe room they had first entered, Vly reached up into a recess where \nthere were several rolled sheets of paper. \"Move aside,\" he said \nquietly, pushing a reluctant koalang over and pulling out a large roll. \nHe unrolled it over a rock polisher and gestured for the Starmen to \ntake the corners. It was a map of a portion of the asteroid belt.\n\n\"Here's where we are,\" said Vly, pointing to a spot on the map, \"and \nhere's where George is.\" His finger swept across the map to where a \ntiny dot had been placed. \"It's a mining operation of moderate size \ncalled Z25. He runs it there with a fair-sized crew-maybe a dozen men.\" \nThere were equations, sketches, and notes scribbled all over the sheet.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Mr. Vly,\" said Mark, \"but I don't follow you. I'm used to \nplotting coordinates and thinking in three dimensions.\"\n\n\"See these figures?\" asked Vly. \"They're your coordinates. It is a \nthree-dimensional map, in a manner of speaking. If it weren't, I \ncouldn't get around. I'll write down what you need. But you'll find \nGeorge on that little plunk of a rock. He's been there several months \nnow and won't be hard to find, once I point it out to you. I just spoke \nto him a few hours ago and I'll get ahold of him again and tell him \nyou'll be coming.\" He began to write some notes down for Mark.\n\n\"Must take a lot of power to run your operation here, Mr. Vly,\" \nobserved Mark while he waited for Montezuma to finish writing. \"Don't \nyou have to conserve energy?\"\n\n\"Haven't had to conserve energy since I developed a new process for \ndrawing energy directly from the sun.\"\n\n\"But out here the solar radiation is so weak. You can't get much energy \nfrom solar panels, no matter how efficient-certainly not enough to run \nyour machines without some sort of supplement.\"\n\n\"I don't use solar panels any more, Mr. Seaton. I mine energy from the \nsun directly with an entirely new process. I can pull in and store \nabout four gigawatts. Gives me all I need and plenty left over.\"\n\n\"Four gigawatts?\"\n\n\"Four gigawatts. That's a four with nine zeroes after it.\"\n\nMark almost shouted. \"I know how much it is! Mr. Vly! You amaze me! \nThere's nothing like that anywhere else in the Solar System! Nobody has \nanything like that, nobody! Not even Starlight Enterprise! You could \nmake a fortune if you sell your design!!\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Mr. Vly, lifting his eyebrows slightly, handing him the \nsheet with his notes on it. \"Excuse me a moment while I write that \ndown, so the next time I want to turn my whole life over to lawyers and \nbusinessmen I'll know just what to do.\"\n\n\"But, but...\" Mark spluttered. Joe laughed and Zip smiled.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Vly,\" said Zip, extending his hand. \"It has been a \nremarkable visit, and we appreciate very much your letting us drop in.\"\n\nMontezuma shook Zip's hand. \"Wait a minute, Starmen. Let me give you \nsomething to help you while away the long hours in space.\" He turned \nand rummaged through a box, then scanned a shelf behind him. After a \nmoment he pulled out a gold disc in a flat, clear container.\n\n\"Take this,\" he said, handing it to Zip. \"It's a recording of the \nentire works of Johann Sebastian Bach. That's more than 1,200 \ncompositions. The music is so complex that some of its mysteries \nweren't even discovered until the computer age. Lily made this disk. \nShe's an expert in the music of the Renaissance. Does research all the \ntime.\"\n\n \"Lily?\"\n\n\"Lily and I have been partners out here for over twenty years. Us and \nthe koalangs.\"\n\nZip put the disk into his pocket. \"Thank you, sir. Best wishes to you.\"\n\n\"You too. An occasional visit once in a while is welcome, especially \nwhen people respect my way of life. Most don't understand. I think you \nthree do. Just protect George. He's a good friend, and they're hard to \nfind.\"\n\n\n\nAbout 56 hours later, the Vigilant Warrior came into the proximity of \nZ25. Joe eased the ship through a scattering of moderate-sized \nasteroids and then came into a space where there were relatively few \nchunks of stone and iron moving through space. On the far side of the \nopen area was an asteroid nearly twenty miles long and half as wide.\n\n\"There it is,\" announced Joe. \"Z25.\"\n\nZip gave a nod to Mark, and Mark opened communications.\n\n\"Vigilant Warrior calling Z25. We have arrived in your area and seek \npermission to land.\"\n\n\"You made good time, friends,\" came a voice instantly. \"Come on in and \nwelcome.\"\n\nThe Starmen had spoken to St. George once during their journey from \nMontezuma's Castle, but only briefly. The communications were \nencrypted, but even the encryption could be a tipoff to an enemy who \nmight be listening in.\n\nAs they made their final approach, the Starmen had a good view of Z25's \nhorizon near the time of local sunset. The surface was dark because of \nthe oblique illumination, but several boulders caught the sunlight and \nappeared as bright sentinels on the landscape. The brightest of the \nboulders, just to the upper right of a deeply shadowed crater in the \nforeground, marked the landing area. A cluster of artificial structures \nwas visible nearby, and several spaceships were parked in an informal \narray. A dome covered the buildings, and reflected the sun in a burst \nof brightness. Mark had a quick memory of dewdrops in the garden of his \nhome on Earth when he was a child. He recalled thinking that each \ndewdrop held a small sun.\n\nIn moments the Starmen were sitting in George St. George's study. He \nwas a man in his middle-fifties, of average height and weight, with a \nfull head of wavy blond hair. It was obvious that he cut his own hair, \nbut long practice had made him skilled at it. Though his eyes were \nice-blue, he exuded warmth. He had a ready smile. The Starmen were \nsitting in a makeshift room under a temporary atmosphere dome on an \nisolated asteroid, but St. George's courtliness and genuine respect for \nhis visitors made them feel as if they were in a manor house. On his \ndesk lay a thick book with the title Commentary on the Letter to the \nRomans, and several sheets of paper and a pen were set beside it where \nhe had obviously been doing some study.\n\n\"I hope you men won't mind waiting for refreshments. It's almost \ndinnertime and the crew will be coming up for a meal in about half an \nhour. Of course, you'll join us, won't you?\"\n\n\"Thank you Mr. St. George,\" responded Zip. \"We'd be pleased to meet \nyour men and see your operation.\"\n\n\"Monty tells me you three are real ripstavers, and he doesn't say that \nvery often about anybody. You must have impressed him!\" St. George was \nfull of smiles.\n\n\"May we sit down, Mr. St. George? Our business is rather urgent!\" Zip \ncontinued.\n\n\"Of course, of course. Please forgive me! We don't get visitors of any \nkind out here and I'm just not used to entertaining. Please forgive \nme!\" St. George rushed busily setting out chairs, bringing in two from \na room next door. \"And please call me George.\"\n\nOnce they were settled, Zip began to tell George about the pirates and \nZimbardo's likely determination to find and eliminate the one man who \nknew where the pirates' asteroid could be found. Before he got too far \ninto the story, George lifted a hand and smiled. \"Yes, yes, I know,\" he \nsaid. \"Monty told me all about it.\" \n\nThe Starmen leaped out of their chairs, absolutely stunned. Before they \nhad left Montezuma's Castle Zip had impressed upon Vly how vital it was \nfor St. George's safety that they not communicate until his friend was \nsafe. Zip had begged him to send just a quick, encrypted message that \nZ25 was to expect three visitors who had Vly's seal of approval-no more.\n\n\"George!\" gasped Joe. \"That message could have been intercepted by the \npirates! They must be looking for you!\"\n\n\"We told Vly not to communicate with you! It could mean your life!\" \ncontinued Mark, suddenly heartsick with anxiety.\n\nGeorge chuckled. \"Don't worry, Starmen! The pirates already tried to \nfind me through Monty, but the greegles protected him, and the \npirates'll never find me without cooperation from Monty-which they'll \nnever get. There's really no need to worry. We're completely safe here. \nWe'll have dinner, you'll stay here to sleep, I'll show you around the \noperation, and you can go back to Ceres.\"\n\nThe Starmen were speechless for a moment. Joe's eyes nervously scanned \nthe room and Mark stared at George with his mouth agape. Then Zip spoke.\n\n\"What are greegles, George?\"\n\nGeorge chuckled again. \"You haven't heard of this 'asteroid miner's \nlegend'? Most people think it's in a class with leprechauns and \nmermaids, the story of the greegles, but it's all true. The greegles \nare the inhabitants of the asteroids. Don't know if they're alive or \nnot. They're made of metal-some kind of metal-or maybe they just wear a \nmetal suit. They're about a foot high. Now, don't stare at me like \nthat; you're looking thoroughly obflisticated, probably thinking I've \nbeen out in the vacuum too long, but I've seen them! They're little and \nthey're old, very old, but they're powerful! No one can beat them! \nUsually no one ever sees them and they don't have any need to interfere \nwith human beings. They don't mind it too much, though, if a solitary \nasteroid miner sees them once in a while.\"\n\n\"And wh-, what do they have to do with Montezuma?\" asked Zip, keeping \nhis voice steady.\n\n\"Why, a short time after you left the Castle, about five ships tried to \nland on the Castle by force-pirates, for sure. No doubt they wanted to \nforce Monty to tell 'em where I am. But Monty knows how to contact the \ngreegles. There's a lot of greegles on Adamant.\" George chuckled again.\n\n\"Those poor fellows-the pirates, that is! When the pirates told Monty \nthey were going to land whether he wanted them to or not, why, he just \ncalled the greegles for help. They cut four of the ships into pieces in \na matter of seconds, leaving the crew floating in their spacesuits. \nThen they grabbed them with some sort of invisible grappling beam or \nsomething and herded them toward the fifth ship. That ship gathered \nthem in and took off.\"\n\nNow George laughed out loud. \"They got the message real fast! Go away \nand don't come back! And they scrammed! Never even set foot on \nMontezuma's Castle. Monty will make good use of the floating space junk \nthe pirates left. Serves 'em right!\"\n\nJust then a gentle buzz sounded. \"That's the call for dinner, friends. \nCome meet the others!\"\n\nAlmost immediately another sound came through the communications \nsystem-an urgent clangor. St. George's face became taut and a look of \nsurprise and anxiety came over his features.\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Zip.\n\n\"It's the alarm,\" St. George whispered. \"It's never sounded before.\" \nThe alarm abruptly shut off and an excited, panic-stricken voice came \nthrough the intercom.\n\n\"Five ships approaching! Coming in fast! They're commanding all hands \nto come to the landing field and threatening to destroy the whole \noperation if we don't cooperate! They've already started to destroy the \nbase!\"\n\n\n5: The Destruction of Z25\n\nJOE dashed from the room and sped down the hallway to the control \ncenter of the mining base. Each strike of a laser beam colored the \ninterior of the buildings with ruby red as the attackers' targets were \nvaporized, and the flashes were coming with disturbing frequency. He \nhurled himself into the tiny office where a frantic young man sat at a \nconsole.\n\n\"We're going to die!\" cried the young man. Joe looked through the large \nwindow and saw five ships hovering over the base. Their laser cannons \nwere rapidly destroying the outlying parts of the mining base. There \nwere no defensive weapons. Joe glanced at the radar screen and his hair \nstood up as he saw that the screen showed nothing. To the surveillance \nsystem, the ships were invisible. The technician was babbling in \nabject, helpless fear, but Joe's pulse leaped when he realized that the \nfrightened young man might be right. They could all be dead at any \nmoment. The man fled the room crying.\n\nJoe looked out the window again and saw that laser cannons had begun to \ndestroy the ships. Through the horrifying, rapidly expanding concentric \nvapor shells, he saw the Vigilant Warrior crumpling into a heap. The \nother ships were either completely destroyed or well on the way.\n\n\"What is this? Who are they?\" exclaimed Mark. He, Zip, and George had \nfollowed Joe to the control center and were watching the laser beams \nsweep the landing field. The ships were being indiscriminately reduced \nto molten slag.\n\n\"Their laser beams are immensely powerful, and they're operating at \nfull capacity,\" observed Zip, grimly. Just then the lights went out and \nevery apparatus in the control center went dark.\n\n\"They found and destroyed the power plant,\" whispered George, the \ntenseness evident in his voice. \"But they're not touching the inhabited \nparts of the base.\"\n\nSuddenly Zip turned to their host. \"George!\" he said urgently. \"Do any \nof your crew know that we are Starmen?\" George turned a distracted face \nto Zip and stared as if he wasn't comprehending what Zip had said.\n\n\"Do any of your crew know that we are Starmen?\" Zip repeated carefully.\n\n\"I-I don't know. I didn't tell anybody, I think, but I didn't keep it a \nsecret.\"\n\n\"Look! Gather them all together and tell them not to say anything about \nus to these invaders! Our safety may depend on it, as well as any \nchance we all have of eventually escaping!\"\n\n\"Ah-all right,\" George stammered.\n\nSince the power was out, there was no way to make an announcement \nthrough the communication system, but the rest of the crew was \nassembling anyway. The refectory was located not far from the control \ncenter and the men were coming together there, so the Starmen and \nGeorge went to join them.\n\nIn a moment, there were about a dozen men in the room. Some sat on the \nbenches, others stood. There was palpable fear in the room, as if they \nknew that sudden, violent death was near.\n\nZip asked George, \"Is this everyone?\" George took a quick glance around \nthe room.\n\n\"I, I think so, yes.\"\n\nZip took charge. \"Men, listen to me. We're about to be taken captive. I \ndon't think anything worse will happen to us, or it would have happened \nby now. My friends and I have come to visit Sabbath George. Just got \nhere from Ceres and sure didn't expect this!\"\n\nGeorge took over. He was showing more confidence now. Alone of the Z25 \ncrew, he had never shown fear, just shock. \"We'll just wait right here, \nmen, and see what's next. I don't know who these attackers are or what \nthey want, but don't volunteer any information of any kind. You hear \nme? No information of any kind, beyond the most basic.\"\n\nThe men were silent and collapsed in on themselves. They were afraid, \nbut the panic seemed to have diminished somewhat. Outside, the five \nships had landed and about twenty space-suited men had emerged. With \nweapons in hand, they were approaching the dome. The leader gestured to \nseveral of them, who spread out around the dome. The others remained at \nthe main airlock and waited. Their feet were spread in an attitude of \ndefiant power.\n\n\"They want the airlock open, Mr. St. George,\" said the young man who \nhad fled from the control center. His voice was dry and squeaky.\n\nGeorge said, \"Can't open it. No controls. Those fools destroyed the \npower center. If they're coming in, you'll have to get your spacesuits \non because the atmosphere is going to disappear. Make it quick before \nthey blow the airlock by force.\" The men scattered. George and the \nStarmen went to the airlock and looked at the invaders from the inside \nof the dome. George said to the Starmen, \"Of course, there's a backup \npower system, but I don't feel a compelling need to make it any easier \nfor these strangers.\"\n\nWhen the leader saw that there were people coming, he kicked the \nairlock savagely and aimed his weapon at the mechanism. As was \ncustomary, the helmets were lined up on a rack on shelves just inside \nthe airlock. George put on his helmet and the Starmen put on theirs. \nThe rest of the mining crew began to show up with their suits on and \nfound their helmets. When all were suited up and the intercoms were on, \nGeorge told the mining crew to stand aside. Then he told the leader of \nthe invaders that he could enter.\n\nThe man fired a stupendously powerful beam at the airlock that melted \nit like ice in a furnace. In seconds, the air inside the dome whooshed \nout into the vacuum of space.\n\n\"Get into the ship,\" growled the leader of the invaders, indicating the \nclosest of the five spaceships. \"No one is going to be hurt, but I'm \nnot guaranteeing that that situation will last. I'm not a patient man \nand I don't like wasting time.\"\n\n\"What about our belongings?\" asked George.\n\n\"You won't need them. Move to the ship. Now.\" The voice was even and \nquiet but as hard as iron. Zip started the procession. He slumped down \nas if completely disheartened and walked like a prisoner, his eyes \npointed to the ground. The others followed. The invaders kept them \nsurrounded as they walked the short distance to the pilot ship. Several \ninvaders entered first and then kept watch on the prisoners as they \nascended the ladder into the staging area. Once the asteroid miners \nwere aboard, the other invaders entered their ships.\n\nWhen the door was sealed, the invaders removed their helmets. The \nminers followed suit. The leader took a quick inventory of the \nprisoners, and then settled his gaze on George.\n\n\"You are George St. George,\" he said in a tone that knew he was stating \na fact. \"My name is Lather. You and your men are now prisoners of \nLurton Zimbardo. I am taking you to him. As long as I've got you, I \ndon't care about anything or anyone else. Don't make any trouble and I \nwon't see any need to put anyone off the ship. It doesn't make any \ndifference to me whether any of your men is in deep space or my guest \nroom, but it might make a difference to you-and them.\"\n\nWithout turning his head, Lather addressed one of his crew. \"Blaze, see \nthat this base is melted into the bedrock.\"\n\n\"Yes sir,\" said the man addressed and left the room.\n\nLather addressed another of his crew. \"Spelford, escort the prisoners \nto their quarters.\"\n\nSpelford lifted his weapon and nodded in the direction they were to go. \nThe prisoners went, under the guard of several armed men.\n\nThey were taken to a room set up to accommodate up to twenty \npassengers. There were niches with beds in them, and couches for use \nduring acceleration.\n\n\"Prepare for lift-off,\" ordered Spelford. The prisoners sat down and \nstrapped themselves in. Spelford and his men left, locking the door \nbehind them. In a moment the warning signal for lift-off was given. The \nship raised itself gently from the surface of the asteroid. The fierce \nglare of destructive laser strikes came through the quartz window for \nnearly a minute, and the prisoners knew that the living quarters of Z25 \nwere being systematically destroyed.\n\n\"They're ramsquaddling the whole operation,\" said Sabbath George in a \nvoice that sounded almost matter-of-fact. \"Never had anything like this \nhappen before. This is a first.\"\n\nWhen the glow ceased, the ships accelerated. The Starmen and their \ncompanions felt themselves pressed into the chairs.\n\n\n\nThe five invisible ships had been gone for over an hour, but the man in \nthe shadow still did not move. He was on a neighboring chunk of \nfloating iron, just a mile or two in diameter with a very slow \nrotation. St. George's asteroid would vanish below his horizon in a few \nminutes. The man pulled the telescope up to his face plate once again \nand scanned the area that had been the base on Z25. There had been no \nmovement of any kind since the ships had rayed the site. He took a few \nmore pictures for his files. The metal and quartz plating-all signs of \nhuman presence-had been completely destroyed, melted into the rock of \nthe asteroid. The brilliant orange of superheated rock had quickly \ncooled in the near-absolute zero of airless space.\n\n\"Guess it's okay to go now,\" he thought. \"Those space buzzards are not \ndetail men-just grab and destroy without even looking around. Lucky for \nme.\"\n\nThe man went over to a small asteroid cruiser, built for speed in \ntouring the Asteroid Belt. Stepping in, he sealed the airlock and \npulled out a small recorder. He tuned in a complicated code and began \nto speak.\n\n\"Steve Cliff, reporting in to Oritz Konig on Mars Base.\" Steve went on \nto give the date, time, and location, and a brief but thorough report \nof what he had seen, from the time the Starmen landed on Z25 to the \ntime the pirates' five ships had disappeared. He added to the file the \npictures he had taken, and concluded, \"Now returning to Yellow City. If \nyou have anything else you'd like me to do, Oritz, contact me there. I \ndon't have to tell you I'm pretty fond o' those boys and I was more'n \ndelighted to keep an eye on 'em for you on this trip. Sorry this report \nisn't any better. I'll stop in and see Sim before I continue my trip \nback to Earth, just in case you leave a message for me there.\"\n\nHaving finished the recording, he put it into a small projectile with \nan automatic timer to release and send the message in three hours. Then \nhe lifted off the small asteroid and headed toward Ceres. A few minutes \nafter liftoff, he fired the projectile. When it sent its message, Steve \nCliff would be far away and no one could trace the message back to his \nship. On top of that, the message was encrypted and designed to travel \non the microwaves similar to those in the background of space. It was \nhighly unlikely that this message would make anyone curious. After the \nmessage had been sent, the projectile would break down into its \ncomponent parts and scatter them into the infinity of space.\n\n\n\nThe ships had stopped accelerating and the prisoners could talk easily.\n\n\"You don't seem too upset, George,\" suggested Mark.\n\n\"Naw,\" said George. \"'Course I'm sorry to lose my stuff back there, and \nI'm sorry for the men, but most of our stuff is somewhere else. This \nwas a temporary base and the mine wasn't producing too well anyway. \nHardly worth our time. Besides, I've learned to be content just about \nwherever I am. I've been around the asteroids a lot and I've learned to \ndepend on a Resource outside myself whatever the circumstances. I know \nwhat it is to be brought low, and I know what it is to have plenty. \nI've been thoroughly initiated into the human lot with all its ups and \ndowns-fullness and hunger, plenty and want. Makes little difference to \nme. Wherever I am, whatever happens, I'm confident. And I'm a man of \nprayer.\"\n\n\"I'm sure sorry about your friend Montezuma,\" said Zip sympathetically.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, these ships must be the same five that attacked him. They \ncouldn't have found you without getting the information from Vly. So \nit's a good guess that they destroyed his base the way they did yours.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort!\" said St. George heatedly. \"I told you that those \nships were defeated and their crew sent back to wherever they came from \nwith their tail between their legs!\"\n\n\"But this story about the 'greegles'-\" contributed Joe.\n\n\"The greegles sliced those ships up like salami!\" insisted St. George. \n\"These ships we're on are a different lot! And besides, Monty would \nnever have told anybody how to find me-not by force or threat, anyway!\"\n\n\"We're sorry, George,\" apologized Zip. \"I didn't mean to upset you or \ncast any doubt on Montezuma Vly. You're right-he's not the type to give \nin to any threat. I must be mistaken.\"\n\n\"You're forgiven,\" said St. George. He went off to see how his men were \ndoing.\n\n\"Zip!\" whispered Joe urgently. \"You don't really believe that story \nabout the 'greegles.' These have to be the same ships!\"\n\n\"I think it's more important not to upset George. We don't know the \nwhole story.\"\n\n\"But greegles!\"\n\n\"What about the greegles?\" asked Mark, with a slight edge of \ndefensiveness in his tone. \"Did it seem to either of you that Vly would \nbetray a friend to save himself? And did you see any sign of advanced \nweaponry at Montezuma's Castle?\"\n\n\"What are you saying, Mark?\" asked Joe.\n\n\"I'm saying that we shouldn't discount an old tale just because it \nsounds foolish or superstitious. George knew we were coming. He \ncouldn't have known unless Montezuma sent him a message, even though we \nwarned him against doing so. If he sent George a message, he wasn't \ntaken over by the pirates. These aren't the same ships. These are \nanother part of Zimbardo's fleet sent out to find George St. George. \nThey must have tracked him down through the message Vly sent-not \nbecause they landed on the Castle and threatened him.\"\n\nZip looked deeply thoughtful. Joe looked incredulous.\n\n\"Mark, you can't be serious!\"\n\n\"It's not a matter of being serious or not, Joe; it's a matter of being \nopen-minded.\"\n\n\"George described it himself! He's been out in the vacuum too long.\"\n\n\"I don't think George strikes me as an unbalanced man. Unusual, for \nsure. But not unbalanced. Not unbalanced at all.\" Mark looked over his \nshoulder. George had his arms around two of his men and was talking to \nthem in a low voice. The rest of them were gathered around, paying \nclose attention to what he was saying. Already the atmosphere was one \nof peace. No one seemed afraid now.\n\nThrough the window beyond, a portion of the vast arm of the Milky Way \nspread out in its eternal beauty. The Starmen were silently wondering \nthe same things: How long would it be before they met Lurton Zimbardo? \nWould he recognize them? Why did he want St. George alive?\n\n\n6: Battle Lines\n\nTHE PIRATES' ASTEROID swung in a smooth, private orbit about a thousand \nmiles beyond the farthest extremity of the Asteroid Belt. Lurton \nZimbardo was in his private sanctum, a well-equipped workroom with \nprecision astronomical equipment, sky charts, and an enormous inventory \nof computer files. As he turned his telescanner toward the Inner \nPlanets, he saw the spread of the Belt before him.\n\nCountless celestial bodies moved in an incredibly slow pattern like a \nstately dance. Reflected sunlight glinted from oblique surfaces into \nthe light-gathering lenses of the telescanner. When the occasional \ncrystalline surface or frozen lake on a passing asteroid caught the \nradiance just right, an intense but transitory sparkling brilliance was \ngenerated, and created a pattern of astonishing beauty on the scanner's \ncomputer screen.\n\nZimbardo entered a few more bits of data into the criteria of his \nsearch pattern and then said, \"Enter.\" Within seconds several asteroids \nwere marked in his files. He brought their profiles up one by one.\n\nM253.\nSHAPE: OBLONG.\nMAXIMUM LENGTH: 0.683 MILES.\nMAXIMUM WIDTH: 0.307 MILES.\nCOMPOSITION: 90.568% IRON, 6.443% TIN, 0.752%\nICE, 2.237% TRACE ELEMENTS; CLICK HERE FOR DETAILS.\n\nOther information was provided, including the asteroid's precise \nlocation and its speed of motion and rotation. Zimbardo hesitated a \nmoment, then said, \"Delete.\" He went on to the next entry.\n\nM3366.\nSHAPE: ALMOST PERFECT SPHERE; VARIATION <5%.\nMEAN DIAMETER, 0.057 MILES.\n\nThe other information was provided. Zimbardo smiled. \"Ah-nearly solid \niron and about 100 yards exactly!\" he thought to himself. \"That makes \nfive.\" He told the computer to save that file, then opened the intercom.\n\n\"Gene,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes sir,\" came the immediate response.\n\n\"Contact Mr. Crass and tell him I want M3366.\"\n\n\"Right away, sir.\" \n\n\"Then call the five lieutenants up to my study at once, please. Get \nKimball, Lorry, and Jenner also. Once you've called them, come up \nyourself.\" Gene nodded and activated the personal contact codes of the \nmen Zimbardo wanted to see.\n\nA quarter of an hour later, the ten men were in the lounge in \nZimbardo's quarters. He was playing host, and pouring out a dark golden \nsherry wine into luxurious spun glass goblets.\n\nOne of the men lifted up the goblet so the illumination reflected from \nit, highlighting subtle rainbow whorls in the surface. He swirled his \nwine before he sipped it.\n\n\"Very nice, Lurton, and the glass here is pretty top stuff.\"\n\n\"The wine came from Earth but the glassware came with the asteroid, \nJeff. This place has so much in it that I haven't found a hundredth of \nwhat it contains, but all of it is high quality.\"\n\nThe men relaxed in the comfortable chairs. The chairs automatically \nadjusted to the body weight and shape of whoever sat in them. Soft, \nalmost imperceptible music was playing in the background. A light \nfragrance in the air eased tensions and sharpened minds for thought. \nZimbardo had nothing to do with creating this atmosphere-these features \ncame on automatically whenever anyone entered the room.\n\n\"Petty soft life you got here, Zimbardo,\" sighed the man named Lorry, \neasing himself down into his chair. \"I'm not used to this kind of \ncomfort.\"\n\n\"No, Lorry, I guess not. You don't find too many easy chairs aboard the \nkind of ships you pilot when you're transporting the Banjoman's flilox \nto his customers in the Belt. But when our plan succeeds, you'll be \nable to buy all the soft chairs you want. Let's get down to business.\"\n\nZimbardo stood before the assembled company. Behind him, taking up most \nof the wall, was a map of a large portion of Mars. \"As I was saying \nwhen we met in the hangar assembly room yesterday, it is simply a \nmatter of choosing an appropriate target to convince them we have the \ncapability. What should our target be? Well here, gentlemen, are the \nfive major atmospheric generation plants on Mars.\" He turned to the map \nand pointed out five places-two in the northern hemisphere, two near \nthe equator, and one in the southern hemisphere. \"Each is valued at two \nbillion solars and would take several years to replace. The damage \nwon't bankrupt the government, but the expense is far from negligible! \nEven more importantly, when they are destroyed, Starlight Enterprise's \nterraformation project will suffer a severe setback-possibly as much as \nthree to four years. Now, data gathered from analysis has shown that \nthese plants can be removed very easily by the proposal we have \nsuggested. Mr. Crass, do you have anything to add?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Zimbardo. I've checked the specs on the asteroids you've \nselected and I've checked progress with what Stubb is doing. If he has \nthe propulsion units ready in ten days, we can deliver our first \npackage to Mars in precisely two weeks.\"\n\nA muscular man in short sleeves spoke up. Since no one else wore short \nsleeves, everyone suspected that he wore his sleeves short to show off \nhis biceps. \"Lurton-what about the ships that went to interrogate Vly? \nWe know five took off, and yesterday I only saw one return. No one else \nwants to ask about it, but I'm asking. If I'm going to risk my men and \nmy ships on this venture of yours, I want to know what's involved.\"\n\nAs the man was speaking, Gene lowered his head and kept his eyes on the \nfloor.\n\n\"All right, Captain Kimball. It's a fair question. You're right. Five \nwent out and only one returned. None of the men was lost-the returning \nship brought them all back. But four of the ships were destroyed before \nthey could land on Montezuma's Castle.\" Zimbardo's five lieutenants \nwere already aware of the setback. The visitors, Jeff Jenner and Lorry, \nwere stunned. Kimball grunted, as if a suspicion had been confirmed.\n\n\"Well?\" he pressed, his face hard and demanding.\n\n\"Gene,\" said Zimbardo, turning away. He didn't like to deliver news of \ndefeat.\n\n\"The pilots of the ships tell essentially the same story,\" began Gene. \n\"They came directly to Montezuma's asteroid, opened communications, and \ninsisted that they were going to land. There was no response. But \nwithin seconds some kind of energy beam came forth from Adamant, the \nneighboring asteroid, and sliced the four ships into small sections. It \nwas clear that there was no intention to kill any personnel-only to \ndestroy the ships. The crews were left floating in space. Forces of \nsome kind we are not familiar with pulled them into the proximity of \nthe remaining ship, where they were taken aboard. Clearly, against \nforces like that we are helpless. The ship returned immediately. The \nmen are badly shaken.\"\n\nKimball grunted again. \"And Vly?\"\n\nZimbardo answered. \"They never talked to him. But we don't need him. A \nshort time after this incident he radioed to St. George and we \nintercepted the beam. We'd been looking for it. Vly probably assumed \nthat with the destruction of our landing party he was safe and so was \nSt. George. But his call went directly to asteroid Z25. It was \nencrypted so we couldn't read it, but we didn't have to know what the \nmessage was to know where it went. Our other five ships were two days \naway from the location. They went directly there and picked up all the \nminers, including St. George, in a very neat operation.\"\n\nThe intercom buzzed. \"Mr. Zimbardo?\"\n\n\"Yes, what is it?\" he responded with obvious irritation.\n\n\"Sorry to bother you, sir, but you asked to be informed as soon as the \nships returned. The Silver Cloud and its four companion ships are \nexpected to dock in approximately 45 minutes.\"\n\n\"Very good!\" Zimbardo's initial irritation was instantly dispelled. \n\"Tell Mr. Lather to put the prisoners into the cell block. I will deal \nwith them later.\" The intercom went off and Zimbardo turned back to the \ngathering. \"As you heard, St. George will be on the asteroid within the \nhour.\"\n\nThere were nods around the table. Many questions were asked about the \ndestruction of the four ships near Montezuma's Castle, but there were \nno answers. The issue was left unresolved; Zimbardo, however, was not \nsaying everything he suspected. He was frightened, but determined that \nno one would know it. He had heard of the legend of the greegles and \ntook it more seriously than anyone would ever suspect.\n\n\n\nRichard Starlight's spacious office was located near the top of the \nhighest tower on the Moon, the giant SE headquarters building located \nforty miles north of Amundsen City. Accessible only by two express \nelevators, his office covered nearly an entire floor of the tower-more \nthan 3,000 square feet. Its walls were treated glass, harder than any \nmetal alloy and impervious to the constant rain of micro-meteorites, \nwith clarity which was nearly perfect. The office was the equivalent of \n121 stories above ground level, and only an observation deck and \nvarious antennae were above it. The lunar landscape was visible for \nmiles in every direction. The pass which marked the entrance to the \nField of Obsolescence was barely visible ten miles away just a little \neast of north.\n\nWhat he called his \"office\" was really a combination laboratory, \nresource library, work and communications center, and lounge. In one \ncorner was a huge table, made of artificial material but, apart from \nchemical analysis, not distinguishable from highly polished mahogany. \nIts chairs matched its reflective sheen. Table and chairs rested on an \nintricately patterned carpet that measured at least twenty by \ntwenty-five feet. Patterns in cerulean blue, silver, and gray, with \nflecks of green and violet beautifully complemented the lunar gray \nvisible through the windows. Not far from the table was an immense, \ndetailed globe of the Earth, about four feet in diameter and perfectly \nbalanced. Equally detailed globes of the Moon and Mars on the same \nscale were nearby. In another corner were globes of Mercury and Venus \nand a few other celestial bodies.\n\n\"I'm sorry to put an end to the festivities this way, gentlemen,\" said \nRichard Starlight to the assembly. Around the table were the President \nof the United States and three of his advisors, among whom were \nCommander John Lewis of Space Command. Richard's second-in-command, \nJohn \"Rock\" Rwakatare, head engineer of the Advanced Design Department \nof SE was also present, as were Allen Foster, Keith Seaton, and Charlie \nTaylor, the fathers of the three Starmen. Robert Nolan, founder of \nNolan Mining Enterprises and a friend and colleague of Richard \nStarlight, and his second-in-command Beowulf Denn filled out the number.\n\nOn two viewscreens were stationary images of Oritz Konig on Mars, and \nSteve Cliff en route to the Moon from the Asteroid Belt. The time delay \nfor Konig was a little more than fifteen minutes, and for Cliff was \nabout 22 minutes, so they could not actively participate in the \ndiscussion. Both, however, had vital reports to make and Richard was \nprepared to present them by videotape at the right time.\n\nRichard continued. \"We all expected that our three Starmen would be \nback with us in two days for the Reception of Honor. That will have to \nbe postponed. Most of you know at least something of the reason why, \nbut this urgent meeting was called to make sure that everyone is \nbrought up to date and, more importantly, to take counsel on a course \nof action.\"\n\nRichard summed up what had been learned about the pirates after the \nliberation of Mars up to the point of the Starmen's departure from \nOritz Konig's office.\n\n\"Our conclusion is that, although we have 542 men in custody in Eagle \nCity, including their captain Troy Putnam, several dozen pirates are \nstill free. It would have taken a large facility to prepare the ships \nand house the men used in the assault on Mars, and it is virtually \ncertain that a sufficient force for maintaining this operation was left \nat their base. We believe that this was probably a minimal number, but \nthere may have been pirates in other locations in the Asteroid Belt or \nelsewhere. Moreover, as you know, one ship managed to escape from Mars \nduring the liberation. Oritz Konig, now on special assignment at Mars \nBase, will make a report on what we've learned about Putnam's chief \nassistant, Lurton Zimbardo.\"\n\nBy pre-recorded videotape, SE's Chief of Security presented a brief \nreport, similar to that which he had given to the Starmen.\n\nAt its conclusion, Richard continued. \"Since the ship that escaped \nheaded recklessly at its highest velocity toward a certain area of the \nBelt, we can reasonably assume that the pirates' base is situated on an \nasteroid not far from that area.\"\n\nNolan asked, \"Why were the ships from Space Command not able to find \nthis asteroid, or any trace of the pirates?\" Robert Nolan was a man of \nearly middle age, slight of build, with thinning hair. He was noted for \nhis analytical mind and incisive decisions. His hard work over a \ntwenty-year span had built a small company into an influential \ncorporation, and his achievements had brought him respect throughout \nthe Inner Planetary system.\n\n\"This is what we are gathered here to reveal,\" Richard answered. \"I'm \nafraid the news is quite disturbing. Steve Cliff will give us his \nreport.\"\n\nBy videotape, Steve Cliff reported what he had seen in the area of Z25. \nHe concluded, \"So it is obvious that the pirates have a very effective \nradar bender. Their ships are, in effect, invisible to our standard \nradar detection systems.\" \n\nWhen Steve's report was over, Richard added, \"Steve Cliff was immensely \nhelpful when we sent the two Starmen to Mars. He did us another favor \nby following them as far as Z25 when he preferred to return to Earth. \nHe is on his way back to Earth now. Oritz asked him to keep an eye on \nthe Starmen for their own safety, and as you can tell from his report \nit was a very good thing indeed that he did!\"\n\nThe men at the table looked grim. The fathers of the Starmen wore \nespecially troubled expressions.\n\n\"Our battle with the pirates is not yet over, I'm afraid,\" continued \nRichard Starlight. \"Their radar bender is nearly perfect. The notion of \ndeveloping a technique that makes an object invisible to radar is not \nnew, of course, but in spite of several decades of effort even \nStarlight Enterprise has not been able to achieve the high level of \neffectiveness Zimbardo's men have available to them. From these \nobservations we draw two disquieting conclusions.\n\n\"First, we learned from the pirates we captured on Mars that their base \nis probably invisible to radar; it can't be seen with normal methods. \nIt's likely that the pirates have outfitted all their ships with the \ndevice that makes objects invisible to radar, not just the five Steve \nCliff observed. If so, their ships can be anywhere without the \npossibility of any of our bases or centers of civilization being aware \nof them until they become visible to the eye. Since all our computers \ntrack ships and contribute toward strategic battle decisions based on \nradar data, it is almost impossible to guard against such pirate raids \nas Zimbardo's men are now able to carry out-and have already done on \nZ25.\" Richard sighed.\n\n\"Second, and most alarming of all, it is almost impossible for the \npirates to have invented the radar bender on their own. We had surmised \nthis shortly after our first conversations with the captive pirates on \nMars, but since then our computer has estimated the chance that they \ndid so to be approximately 0.0001%. That kind of technology is beyond \nany earthly scientific capability. It is much more likely that they got \nit from some alien civilization-a highly advanced alien civilization.\n\n\"We don't have any solid information other than that, so we can only \nguess what level of connection there may be between any such \nhypothetical civilization and the pirates. At any rate, where the radar \nbender came from, other devices might come too-military devices against \nwhich Earth has no defense. And we have no idea when we will learn the \npirates' next move, and we don't know where the Starmen are now.\"\n\nThe room was silent. Everyone was stunned. When Mars was liberated they \nhad thought that the conflict was at an end. Now they saw that their \nsituation was more desperate than they thought possible.\n\nAfter a moment, Robert Nolan spoke up. His eyes were wide and his voice \nwas high-pitched. \"Wh-, what can we do? Can't we find these pirates? \nCan't we just send out ships and comb the entire area of the Belt where \nthey disappeared? Can't we...?\"\n\nKeith Seaton broke in. \"Robert, believe me, if there were anything we \ncould do, anything we could think of that wouldn't be the equivalent of \nrunning around in circles, we'd be doing it! The Starmen are our sons! \nRichard informed us last night that they were captured, and we've done \njust about nothing else but try to think of something we can do.\"\n\nAllen Foster joined in. His voice was level and determined, clearly \nbeing controlled with supreme effort. \"It is impossible to do a random \nsearch of the Asteroid Belt-even if we restrict our search to the \nsection where the hidden base must lie. We've done the math. We may as \nwell be looking for a black marble hidden at night anywhere in North \nAmerica.\"\n\n\"And invisible ships!\" Nolan gasped. \"The Solar System has no defense \nagainst anything like that. Why, they could come in anywhere and \ninvade! They'd be invincible! We couldn't even see what hit us!\"\n\nCommander Lewis spoke up. \"And an alien civilization! They could have \nscience beyond what we can imagine. Earth doesn't stand a chance \nagainst an enemy like that!\" The men were scared.\n\nAfter a moment when no one else addressed the gathering, the President \nspoke. \"Our position is essentially the same as it was when Mars was \nstill in the control of the pirates. Our strength does not lie in \nsuperior science or in superior numbers. Troy Putnam recently placed \nhis trust in superior strength and technology; the unsoundness of such \na hope is shown by his fall. David fought Goliath and won because his \ntrust was in the right place. Zimbardo might have weapons and other \ntechnology of which we cannot even conceive and he might do great \ndamage, but he is still in the wrong. Evil might have its day, but in \nthe end it will always fall; the forces of light will overcome it as it \ndecays from within. With that faith and that assurance, we can make our \nplans. Does anyone have a suggestion as to how we can meet this crisis?\"\n\nAllen Foster spoke again. \"There are two issues here: finding and \nrescuing the Starmen and their companions, and defending our \ncivilization from the pirates. For the first, well, we're very hopeful \nthat they are still alive because they were taken aboard the pirates' \nship before the base on Z25 was destroyed. They are resourceful young \nmen-they are Starmen, after all.\n\n\"For the second, any solution I'm afraid will be long-term. We'll have \nto develop a detector that uses a process other than radar-perhaps \nsomething based on gravity or light absorption. But you can appreciate \nthe obvious fact, I'm sure, that inventing such machinery will probably \ntake a very long time. No, I think that our course now must be entirely \ndefensive. We are, at least, forewarned. But I'm sure that the pirates \nwill be making the next move before we can do anything about it.\" \n\n\n7: Prisoners on the Pirates' Asteroid\n\n\"WHAT'S the word for 'walk'?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Gentrikian,\" answered Zip automatically.\n\n\"That makes forty-seven points for you,\" said Joe. \"I need fifteen more \njust to catch up. C'mon Mark, give me an easy one-help me out.\"\n\n\"Okay. Do you want English to Titanian or Titanian to English?\"\n\n\"Titanian to English. That's easier.\"\n\n\"K'intrishian.\"\n\n Joe thought for a moment. Languages seemed to come easily to Mark-he \ncould absorb concepts and find mental hooks to hang them on with no \nnoticeable effort at all. Joe found languages far more difficult. He \npreferred engine diagrams and flow charts.\n\n\"I don't know!\" The lean pilot blasted, exasperated. The Starmen, like \nthe crew from Z25, were passing time as they entered the third day of \ntheir captivity aboard the Silver Cloud. Mark was teaching Zip and Joe \nsome of the Titanian vocabulary he'd been working on for two years.\n\n\"This one should be easy for you, Joe, even if it isn't 'sleep' or \n'eat.' The answer is just about all we've been able to do on this trip \nso far.\"\n\n\"Well, sleeping and eating is all we've done!\"\n\n\"'K'intrishian' means 'wait.'\"\n\nJoe grinned. \"We've certainly been doing a lot of that on this outing! \nThe past couple of weeks have seemed about pointless! Just about all \nwe've been doing is bouncing from place to place! We blasted off from \nEagle City to the Asteroid Belt and then went right back to Mars. Then \nback to Ceres in the Asteroid Belt. Then to Montezuma's Castle and on \nto Z25, and we complete our mission just in time to get captured by the \nenemy! Now we're being taken to this 'secret asteroid' where Lurton \nZimbardo has his base and I'll bet anything we're going right back to \nwhere we started-where we lost track of that ship we were chasing into \nthe Belt!\"\n\nAn announcement came through the intercom. \"Prepare for deceleration in \ntwo minutes.\"\n\nThe Starmen looked at one another, then at the crew of Z25. St. George \nwas already walking toward his acceleration couch. Each of them could \nfeel his heart suddenly beating a little faster. They strapped \nthemselves into their couches. Zip looked out of the window but saw \nnothing out of the ordinary.\n\nA moment later, the rockets on the Silver Cloud ignited and the ship \nbegan to slow. About half an hour later, the had slowed to a crawl and \nthe view of the stars disappeared. It became apparent to the prisoners \nthat they had entered a tunnel. After a few seconds, the ship touched \ndown and secured itself to the landing pad. The prisoners waited. No \none spoke.\n\nMinutes passed, then the door to their quarters opened. Spelford stood \nin the opening, with several other men behind him. All were armed.\n\n\"Time to go,\" Spelford announced. The prisoners were escorted single \nfile through the ship and down the access ladder to the floor of the \nlanding pad. They were under observation at all times by armed men in \nfront of them and behind.\n\nJoe reached the bottom of the ladder and turned to look around. To his \nright was an enormous clear wall which sealed off the landing area from \nthe immense tunnel through which the ships had come. In front of him \nand to his left was a complex of charcoal-dark structures, lined with \nsilver trim and glinting with many panels of glass. The entire area was \npowerfully lit by dozens of sources hundreds of feet above him. He was \nboth impressed and intimidated at the same time.\n\nAs soon as the prisoners had debarked from the Silver Cloud, Spelford \nbegan giving orders.\n\n\"Move. This way. Stay in single file.\"\n\nThe line crossed the field and passed through a second airlock. Leaving \nthe field behind, they entered a large manufacturing area. Several \ndozen men were working feverishly at massive tables and work centers. \nSparks from welding areas were visible in the back parts of the area. \nFlashing lights from many desks lit up the faces of men with intent \ngazes, whose attention was fixed on close work on numerous small \ncircuit boards. A few workers glanced curiously at the line of \nprisoners, but they didn't waste time on a thorough investigation of \nthe newcomers.\n\nSpelford and his detail escorted the prisoners through an immense \ndouble door, down a wide passageway, and into a large elevator. The \nelevator could accommodate fifty men easily. When all were inside, \nSpelford tapped a number into the control pad and the elevator began to \ndescend. It stopped in seconds and the door opened into an area where \nseveral corridors came together. Two small elevator doors flanked the \none from which the men emerged. The procession entered a dimly-lit \ncorridor that extended for about a hundred yards. Many doors were set \ninto the walls, but none was open.\n\nSpelford led the way down the corridor. After covering about two-thirds \nof the distance, he stopped and slid open a plain, dark portal set into \nthe right side of the passage. He glanced into the room beyond, then \nstepped back and said, \"In here.\" The prisoners entered, and the door \nclosed behind the last one.\n\nGeorge St. George broke the silence. \"We're not going to be able to \nabsquatulate from these pirate yaps very easily, that's for sure. Guess \nwe'll have to make the most of our stay here.\"\n\nZip strode into the center of the room and looked around. Indirect \nlighting provided plenty of illumination. \"Clearly a dormitory of some \nsort,\" he observed to no one in particular. Bunk-style beds were spaced \naround the walls. Through another door was a resting area with tables \nand chairs. In another room were washing facilities. On one side of the \nmain room was a large window which overlooked the landing area and \nprimary work center of the asteroid.\n\nJoe and Mark strode over to the window and looked out. \"The rotation of \nthe asteroid provides the equivalent of gravity,\" observed Joe. \"About \nwhat we're used to on the Moon-about one-sixth Earth. What do you \nthink, Mark?\"\n\n\"Feels like a little less to me,\" answered Mark. \"We'll have to step up \nour exercises if we're going to maintain muscle tone.\"\n\n\"Nothing fancy, but everything we need,\" said one of St. George's men \nafter a quick look around the rooms.\n\n\"For a long stay, maybe,\" said another.\n\n\"'K'intrishian' means 'wait,' if I remember correctly, Mark,\" said Joe.\n\n\"That's thirty-three points for you,\" responded the tall Starman.\n\n\n\nTime passed. From the window in the wall of the asteroid, the three \nStarmen looked down and saw a buzz of activity. About two dozen ships \nwere docked on the field, and workers were still hovering around tables \nin the work center.\n\n\"Here comes another one,\" said Joe, as a spacecraft passed into view \nfrom the large tunnel that led to the outside.\n\n\"How many is that since we've been here?\" asked Mark. \"Six?\"\n\n\"Yes, six in less than twenty-four hours,\" stated Zip.\n\nThe Starmen chafed under the burden of their powerlessness. They had \nalready scoured the rooms carefully and found no sign of weakness they \ncould exploit. Their food was delivered through an automated shaft that \nthey could find no way of using as an escape route. They had neither \nseen nor spoken to anyone since Spelford had brought them to their \nprison.\n\nOnce again Zip looked out the window. \"This place is amazing! This \ncould not have been anticipated by anyone! It must have been quite a \nshock when you found this asteroid, George.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I was awestruck, completely, absolutely electrified! Imagine \nstepping into a remnant of an astounding civilization like this. When I \nfound it, it was abandoned. It seemed as if no one had been in it for \nprobably thousands of years.\"\n\n\"Tell us everything you know about this place,\" ordered Zip, looking \nintently at the asteroid miner and drawing him over to the nearest \ntable. Zip gently eased the miner into a chair, then turned another \nchair around and sat in it, folding his arms over its back and facing \nGeorge. The asteroid miner told the Starmen the story of his discovery \nof the asteroid and how Troy Putnam had learned about it. They had \nalready heard a brief version of the story from Oritz Konig back at \nMars Base.\n\n\"Of course, I didn't know this Putnam was a bad egg at the time. He \njust seemed like a friendly, curious spaceman to me.\"\n\n\"What about the asteroid?\" pressed Joe. \"What have you figured out \nabout the race that built it?\"\n\n\"As I said, the asteroid was abandoned when I ran across it, but \nwhoever built it couldn't have been too different from us. Same body \ntype, same size, that's obvious. Look around you-beds, chairs, \neverything, just the way we'd make them. Their language was quite \ndifferent, though. Took me a long time to learn how to use some of \ntheir stuff.\"\n\n\"How'd you learn your way around here?\"\n\n\"When I first came upon the asteroid, the airlock was open. A huge \norifice, made for spaceships, as you can tell. I came through and \nlanded. Went through one of the airlocks into the building portion \nhere, where we are now, and just explored. Trial and error. It's not \ntoo difficult to get the basics down-opening and closing doors, and all \nthat. Then figuring out the right mix of atmosphere. I had plenty of \ntime. I got access to the first four or five stories, but I'm pretty \ncertain the place is much bigger than that. At first, I couldn't get \nany further than the first few stories, but after a while I found my \nway around a couple of deeper sections.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, 'and then'? I got bored with it and moved on. I'm a \nminer, not an explorer or a settler or a scientist. There's nothing \nhere but iron. I told a few people about it but nobody much believed me \nor cared until this Troy Putnam fellow I met in Yellow City. He's the \nonly person who got excited about it, so when he asked me to bring him \nhere, I did it, as I said. Why not? He paid my expenses for the trip, \nand a little more besides for my time. He was impressed with the place, \nas was I. Then I went looking for uranium and he went back to Ceres. \nNever saw him again.\"\n\nZip pursed his lips, and his brow furrowed under his red hair-a common \nexpression for the leader of the Starman team. \"This has to explain why \nZimbardo was looking for you,\" he said. \"No one outside the pirates \nknows as much as you about his asteroid. That didn't seem to bother \nTroy Putnam, but Zimbardo must consider you a threat. But I can't \nunderstand why he has taken us prisoner. Zimbardo has no heart of mercy \nwhatever. I would have expected him just to silence you for good. \nObviously he is preparing this place for some new and big enterprise \nand is probably occupied, but now I think we'll be hearing from him \nbefore too long. Before that happens, I think we'd better be gone.\"\n\n\"Escape? You talking about escape, Zip? From here?\" asked Joe with \namazement.\n\nZip addressed St. George. \"Tell us everything you know about how this \nasteroid works. Leave out no detail whatever. Everything you can \nremember. Joe and Mark, pay close attention! We have to come up with a \nplan!\"\n\n\n\nA full day had passed since Richard Starlight had called the special \nmeeting in his office in the towers of Starlight Enterprise. Now he sat \nsilent and alone in one of the chairs around the great table. Suddenly \nhe spun the chair around and stared through the clear wall in front of \nhim. His gaze went far past the lunar mountains into the distant sky \nwhere Mars was just rising, a tiny red point.\n\nThe President had issued his commands earlier that morning. A secret \ncommunication had been issued to the commanding officers of all the \nbases of Space Command. A similar message had been sent to the heads of \nlarge commercial enterprises such as Starlight Enterprise and Nolan \nMining Enterprise, as well as the local authorities of population \ncenters in the Asteroid Belt and on Mars. The communication had \nprovided what information was known about the threat that the pirates \nmanifested. It ordered Space Command and urged the private parties to \nkeep the information secret so as to avoid panic and to prevent the \npirates from learning that their sheathing apparatus had been observed \nin action, and advised all parties to prepare for any attack the \npirates may launch. They were put on high alert for visual attack and \nto be ready for instant defensive response. \n\nIn Amundsen City, Keith Seaton sat at his desk, scanning the Asteroid \nBelt with his telescope. His strong build filled the chair in which he \nsat. \n\n\"There's Ceres,\" he said quietly as the image of the Belt's largest \nasteroid came up on the screen. Charlie Taylor and Allen Foster, who \nwere sitting next to him, nodded. The fathers of the three Starmen \nweren't conversing much that night, but all were greatly comforted by \neach other's presence.\n\nOn Ceres, Sim Sala Bim received the encrypted message on tight beam, \nand felt immense sadness come over him as he read it. \"Where are those \nthree young Starmen now?\" he wondered.\n\nIn the laboratories of Starlight Enterprise's main center on the Moon, \nscientists were working around the clock to devise a method by which \ntheir ships could track distant objects by sight instead of radar. \nAdditionally, under a very rare Presidential command, technicians were \nworking frantically under Earth's pre-eminent astrophysicist, Stephen \nHoshino, trying to devise an advanced means of detecting a ship that \nwas invisible to radar.\n\nThe Inner Planetary system was waiting for a strike which its defenders \nknew would surely come-but not when, where, or how. \n\n\n8: The Starmen Strike!\n\nALMOST an hour had gone by since George St. George had begun to tell \nthe three Starmen what he knew of the asteroid. Zip, Mark, and Joe had \nlistened intently, plying the asteroid miner with detailed questions as \nhe continued his narrative. At last, no one had anything else to say.\n\n\"No more questions?\" Zip asked. Both Joe and Mark shook their heads. \nTheir energy level had gone up appreciably since they had sat down with \nGeorge. They had become spirited, now that they were determined to find \na plan of escape.\n\n\"All right, then. It seems to me that this may be easier than we \nthought,\" stated Zip.\n\n\"You have an idea already?\" asked Joe, with a slight turn of his head.\n\n\"It seems obvious that this asteroid was not intended to house \nprisoners. This room we're in is not a cell block-it's a dormitory.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Mark. \"Therefore the locking mechanism is not original to \nthe asteroid's design. Is that where you're going, Zip?\"\n\nZip smiled. \"Keep going,\" he nodded.\n\n\"Whoever made this asteroid was far in advance of our science and it'll \nprobably be a long time before we, or anyone else, learn how to alter \ntheir design. But the locking mechanism was most likely put in by the \npirates, probably on short notice. It can't be too sophisticated a \nsystem. Again, since this is a dormitory and not a cell, the wiring is \nprobably on this side of the door rather than in the hallway. Let's \nfind where the pirates rewired the door. Whatever they can do, we can \nundo.\"\n\nThe Starmen leaped up and began to investigate the door and the walls \nnear it very carefully. Now that they had some idea of what they were \nlooking for, they hoped it would be easier to find an access panel of \nsome kind which their previous general search had missed. Minutes \npassed with no result. The walls had no apparent seams, and the door \nwas set into the framework so closely that there seemed to be no space \nbetween the door and the edge of the wall into which it slid.\n\n\"Try the floor,\" suggested Joe. Mark dropped down and scanned the floor \nminutely. Joe moved farther to the right and Zip to the left of the \ndoor, their fingers moving gently over the surface looking for some \nkind of irregularity.\n\nSt. George watched them with a mix of curiosity and amazement on his \nface. His men sat at the tables playing games, paying the Starmen \nlittle heed. Once in a while one looked up, then turned back to his \ngame. Others napped on the sofas.\n\n\"Look here,\" said Mark. Zip and Joe came over to see what he had found. \n\"What do you see?\" he asked them, sitting back on his heels.\n\n\"Where?\" asked Joe.\n\n\"You find it-see if I'm right,\" answered Mark.\n\nJoe pursed his lips and squinted. Zip watched carefully. George \nappeared almost impassive, but inside his heart was beating faster.\n\n\"I see it,\" observed Joe after a minute.\n\n\"What?\" burst out St. George, then looked almost sheepish for showing \nhis excitement.\n\n\"The light reflects off this patch here just a little differently from \nthe rest of the floor. It's a perfect square about, oh, fifteen inches \non a side.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Mark.\n\n\"How do we open it-if it's a panel, that is?\" asked Joe. He pushed the \ncorners, tried sliding the panel in every direction, bounced the square \nwith his fingers, all with no result.\n\n\"Let me try,\" said Mark. He laid his hand gently on top. In a few \nseconds there was a click and the square lifted up an inch, supported \nby a small, spring-loaded shaft in the center. Mark lifted the panel \noff and revealed a recess filled with finely detailed circuit boards. \nOver and around them were a few dark wires that obviously did not \nbelong to the original design.\n\nJoe snorted. \"How did you do that?\"\n\n\"Well, I thought that it had to be some sort of radiation that would \nopen it. There were no obvious signs of physical fasteners like screws. \nSo I figured it had to be magnetism, or light, or maybe heat. I thought \nbody heat would be the easiest to try, so I laid my hand on it, \nconcentrated, and made it warm, and it opened!\"\n\n\"Good work, Mark, but let's not waste time! We're in a hurry now,\" \nurged Zip. \"What do you see in there Joe?\" By now George and several of \nhis men had come over and were watching over the shoulders of the \nStarmen.\n\n\"Yeah, really simple circuit. I can disconnect it in a minute even \nwithout tools and we can be out the door.\" Joe reached in.\n\n\"Wait!\" Zip grabbed Joe's wrist. \"Is there any evidence that the \ncircuit is tied into a larger system, like a master computer, that \nwould tip anyone off that the door has been opened?\"\n\nJoe peered into the aperture and carefully traced the wiring.\n\n\"Sorry, Zip. Sorry, everybody,\" he said, chagrined. \"You're right. \nThere is. But I can fix that too.\" He reached in and twisted two wires \ntogether. \"Okay, that should bypass the door circuit and tell the \nmaster computer that the door is still closed. I can open the door now. \nAre you ready?\"\n\nZip stood up. \"There are fourteen of us. We don't know where to go once \nwe're free, so I'd like George to lead us. He's been through the \nasteroid. Take us somewhere, George, where we won't be found easily.\"\n\nGeorge shook his head in a big arc. \"Now Zip, I haven't been on this \nchunk for over fifteen years. I'm not real sure where to go!\"\n\n\"George, no one else has been on the asteroid at all. There's no one \nbut you.\"\n\nThe asteroid miner looked down, dejected. \"I don't like any of this. \nBut you're right. Okay. We'll go out the door and back to the \nelevators. We'll take the one on the left. I'll take us to a floor one \nlevel down, then through a huge storeroom. On the other side are other \ncorridors. I've been through there, and there are places to hide and \nmore elevators to get us other places on the asteroid. After that I'm \nnot sure. Maybe I'll remember when we get there.\"\n\n\"Everyone got that?\" said Zip. \"Stay together and move quickly.\" No one \nhad anything else to say. Zip turned to Joe.\n\n\"Let's go,\" decreed Zip. Joe removed one end of a black wire and \ntouched it to another terminal. The door slid open.\n\nOutside was a scene that none of the Starmen had expected. Two pirates, \ndressed in their gray and black uniforms, were seated opposite one \nanother at a small table on the far side of the corridor. The one on \nthe right was a well-muscled, large man with dark hair, weighing well \nover 200 pounds; the other was blond, of medium build. He was leaning \non his elbow, pondering his next move in a board game. When the door \nslid open, they both looked up, utter surprise written over their faces.\n\nBoth the Starmen and the pirates froze for a split second, then both \nsides moved at once. Mark charged for the big man and Joe for the \nblond. Simultaneously the huge pirate bellowed and threw the table \ntoward the charging Starmen, scattering the game pieces. Mark stopped \nthe flying table without slowing his pace and slammed it hard back at \nthe pirates, legs first. The blond man managed to evade the table, but \nthe big pirate took two table legs on his left thigh and upper chest. \nHe groaned, and the laser pistol he had been drawing was caught behind \nthe table. Mark quickly threw the table upside-down to his left, \nreached with both hands for the pirate's right arm, and pulled the man \nquickly down and toward himself. His right knee came up and caught the \nman in the solar plexus. The pirate went down with a whoosh of air and \nlay still. Mark picked up his pistol.\n\nMeanwhile, the blond pirate had screamed for help in a panicky voice, \nturned, and was dashing down the corridor toward the elevators. Joe \ntook hold of the table's leg nearest him and skated the table \nforcefully down the corridor after the escaping pirate. It caught the \nman behind his left ankle as he was running. In the low gravity, the \npirate turned almost completely over, his pistol flying. Joe caught up \nwith him and delivered a quick punch that rendered the man unconscious. \nThe entire fight had taken less than ten seconds.\n\nZip stepped into the corridor calmly. \"Did either of them have a chance \nto set off an alarm?\"\n\n\"I think this one did,\" responded Joe, pointing to the fallen pirate at \nhis feet and picking up his laser pistol. \"He had about five seconds \nwhile he was running to send an emergency call.\"\n\nZip grimaced. \"That was stupid. I should have thought that they would \nhave a guard. I just didn't think of it, with all the electronic \ngadgetry around here and their obvious need of manpower. My fault. \nSloppy thinking. But it's worse to stand here and feel badly about it. \nWe've got to disappear fast.\"\n\n\"This way!!\" shouted George and began to run toward the elevator. The \nasteroid miner who had previously been so sedate and hesitant now led \nthe way. The Starmen followed him and the ten others brought up the \nrear. George reached the elevator door and pressed the panel. In \nseconds a door opened and the men hurried in. Just as the last man \nrushed through the opening and the doors began to close, the elevator \ndoors in the next shaft opened and a troop of pirates poured out, guns \ndrawn. In front of them they saw their two comrades lying motionless in \nthe corridor, table and chairs in full disarray.\n\n\"Come on!\" commanded their leader, leaping forward and turning toward \nhis men to enforce his order. His eyes opened wide as he saw the doors \nof the adjacent elevator closing on the escaped prisoners. The \nStarmen's last view of the scene was the pirate leader's shocked face, \nmouth agape, pulling his laser pistol up to fire. Then their doors \nsealed and they began to descend.\n\nAlmost instantly, it seemed, the door opened. The only light came from \nthe interior of the elevator. It shone on an uncountable number of \nenormous crates, stacked three high and set in rows extending beyond \nthe range of the minimal light. Though the walls of the room could not \nbe seen, there was a distinct feeling that the open space was \nhuge-larger than a gymnasium, perhaps larger than a stadium. No one \nsaid a word. No one moved.\n\nSuddenly Zip grabbed the laser pistol that Joe was carrying and leaped \nout of the elevator. He whipped around and fired at the control panel \nnext to the large central elevator. The panel flared red for a second \nand then sparked like fireworks. Zip released the activation trigger on \nthe pistol and stepped back. A few pops echoed in the darkness against \na background of the soft sizzling sound of molten metal dripping down \nthe wall.\n\nZip ran to the third elevator, calling out, \"Move away from the \nelevator! Mark, destroy the controls!\" Simultaneously Mark and Zip \ndemolished the control panels of the remaining two elevators. When the \ncontrols were obliterated, the lights in the elevator went out and the \nfourteen erstwhile prisoners stood in the utter darkness of the immense \nchamber. The sole illumination was provided by the fading red glow of \nthe superheated panels that had been their targets and a few bright \norange dots in the gaping holes that remained.\n\n\"I don't know if that'll prevent the pirates from stopping at this \nfloor, but every elevator on Earth I know about can't move beyond any \nfloor where the controls are inoperable. George! Where do we go?\" Zip \nasked.\n\n\"Does anyone have a light?\" responded the asteroid miner. Just then a \npale glow like early dawn rose around them and filled the chamber.\n\n\"What's that?\" cried a frightened voice.\n\n\"Automatic lighting, probably,\" answered Joe. \"When someone moves far \nenough away from the elevator, or when its light goes out, the \nautomatic lighting goes on.\"\n\n\"Follow me,\" directed George. He led the procession to the right of the \nelevator shafts. On one side was a blank wall at least 25 feet high. On \nthe other were row upon row of crates. Each box had a mark on it, but \nnone of the Starmen could recognize its meaning. Far down the rows was \nthe opposite wall of the chamber, at least 200 yards away.\n\nGeorge St. George was hurrying, leading the band of fourteen onward. \nThere was no opportunity for conversation, but Mark stepped up close to \nZip, who had taken the last position in the march.\n\n\"Think what this place is, Zip!\" the mystically-oriented Starman \nbreathed, his eyes alight with excitement. \"This was made by an \nintelligent, extra-terrestrial race we've never heard of! The Titanians \ncertainly didn't make it! And whoever made it was shaped just like us! \nAs George said before, the controls, the beds, the chairs-all are \ndesigned for people like us! Same size! And imagine what must be in \nthese storage units!\"\n\n\"I have been thinking about it, Mark,\" answered Zip. \"I'll want more \ntime later to sift through my impressions, but there are too many \nquestions here to deal with at the pace we're going.\"\n\n\"Of course, but think! Who made this place? How big is the complex? \nWhen and why did they abandon it? Where are they now?\"\n\n\"Yes-and above all, what else will we find in here?\"\n\nJust then the screech of tortured metal sounded loudly throughout the \nchamber. Everyone turned and stared back at the elevators, where the \nsound was coming from. A spot on the left door of the central elevator \nbegan to glow red, then orange, then white. Iridescent metal began to \nspew forth in chunks. Then a spherical mechanism about the size of a \nbasketball shot through the hole. A few bright green and yellow lights \nthe size of small coins lit up its dull silver surface.\n\nZip's blood ran cold. \"It's an airbot!\" he cried. Zip had never seen an \nairbot before, but he knew what it was: an aerial reconobot, an armed \nrobotic flying device which, among other uses, could be programmed to \ntrack down fugitives, drawn by their body heat. Zip and Mark lifted \ntheir laser pistols and fired simultaneously. Their beams lit up red \ndots on the surface of the flying ball but scattered harmlessly, as the \nStarmen assumed they would. The airbot quickly oriented itself to the \nescapees and began to fly toward them.\n\n\n9: A Vision in the Night\n\n\"RUN! Go! Scatter! Move!\" shouted Zip frantically. He ran forward to \nthe closest aisle between the stacks of crates, wheeled right, and sped \ndown the narrow space. He heard the quiet, efficient \"zzap\" sound of \nthe airbot's disabling beam, but apparently not directed toward him \nyet. Desperation powered his legs and they pumped at peak speed. He \ndidn't know where the others were or what they were doing. Someone else \nwas racing behind him but he didn't stop to find out who it was.\n\nIt was not cowardice that inspired his flight, but the desire to \npreserve the team. Scattering and flying gave a slight hope that some \nof the men might escape the relentless search of the airbot-or at least \nput off the inevitable. The rotation of the asteroid provided \nartificial gravity, but it was low enough to enable the men to move \nquickly, covering a lot of distance as they ran.\n\n\"Zzap. Zzap,\" he heard again, more distant this time. He came to the \nend of the aisle and had to slow to keep from slamming into the wall in \nfront of him. He reached out his left hand and grabbed the corner of a \ncrate to help him execute the turn. As he made the quick right angle \ntwist at the end of the row of crates, he glanced behind him with his \nperipheral vision. Joe was close behind him and several yards farther \naway were two of the miners. Even as he looked, he saw the airbot fly \nover the crates into the aisle he had just cleared, missing the ceiling \nby less than a foot. With the hated \"zzap\" sound, it fired one beam \ntoward the miner at the rear of the headlong retreat, and the man went \nlimp and collapsed. His momentum carried him forward several feet \nbefore he stopped moving.\n\nZip saw it all in a split-second as his inertia carried him out of \nview. He looked forward again and sped down the aisle; after passing a \nfew rows he turned again to the left. Far ahead of him he saw the \nelevator door with the bulging rupture through which the airbot had \nburst into the warehouse. Suddenly the airbot flew over the stack of \ncrates to Zip's left and appeared about fifteen yards in front of him. \nA feeling of panicky horror surged through Zip as he saw the airbot \nre-orient itself in his direction.\n\nAll at once every point of light on the airbot went out and it hung \nmotionless in the air. Then it sped back to the elevator door as if \njerked by a cable. It smashed through the hole it had made and flew \ninto the shaft. Instantly there was a dull \"whump,\" more felt in one's \ntissues than heard aloud. A bright light came through the opening like \na spotlight, then faded.\n\n\"What happened to the airbot?\" Joe's amazed voice behind him asked the \nquestion that was in Zip's mind.\n\n\"Let's go,\" said Zip. \"Let's find out who's down and carry them away.\" \nBoth the Starmen were breathing hard, but quickly returned to normal as \nthey paced the aisles. In moments they had assembled those whom the \nairbot had not found. Only four men had been disabled by the airbot's \nbeams.\n\n\"Take us out of here, George,\" ordered Zip. His voice was quiet but \ncarried the authority of leadership that people welcome when there is a \ncrisis. Using the fireman's carry, eight men easily transported the \nfour who were unconscious. \n\nGeorge St. George turned without a word and led the way. Everyone \nfollowed. St. George came to the end of the walkway and turned to the \nleft around the last row of storage units. On his right was a bank of \nelevator doors, some large and some small. He came to the first one and \nwith his hand shaking pressed some numbers into a control panel. \nNothing happened.\n\nHe looked up to Zip with a countenance marked with anguish and pleaded, \n\"I can't do it. My fingers won't work. Mr. Foster, you press the \nnumbers, please.\" Zip stepped up to the panel. As the asteroid miner \ncalled out the directions, Zip pressed the buttons.\n\n\"Top center. Right center. Top right. Top right again. Bottom left. \nCenter. Sorry, I'm a little shaken up.\"\n\n\"That's okay, George. I think we'll be fine now.\" The elevator door \nopened and all the men stepped into the conveyance. The door closed. \nGeorge reached out and pressed one button. The elevator began to \nmove-not down or up as the men expected, but away from the chamber \nwhere they had fought the airbot.\n\n\"What's wrong with these men?\" asked one of the miners. \"They're \ncompletely unconscious and their arms and legs are swinging around like \nthey're puppets or something.\"\n\n\"They're just out temporarily, not hurt,\" answered Joe. \"Airbots \ndisrupt certain neural connections to bring on sleep and complete \nrelaxation of all muscle functions. I'm not sure how high the airbot's \nbeam was set, but I'd guess pretty high. They'll probably sleep for \nseveral hours but they'll be fine when they wake up.\"\n\n\"What did you do to that machine that was chasing us?\" asked another of \nSt. George's companions.\n\n\"I didn't do anything to it. I don't know what happened to it,\" \nanswered Zip. \"I suppose it malfunctioned. Lucky for us.\" Joe and Mark \nboth glanced sidelong at Zip, then looked away. The Starmen knew that \nwhatever had happened to the airbot, a malfunction was not one of the \npossibilities.\n\nAnother of the miners spoke up. \"I've never been on an elevator that \nmoved horizontally before. Where are we going, George? This transit is \ntaking longer than just moving between floors.\"\n\n\"The elevators inside this rock can move in just about any direction \nexcept slantindicular. If I remembered accurately, this one'll take us \nto a control and information center of some kind. I don't know where it \nis in relation to where we started, but we should be safe there and if \nI don't forget where we come out, I can always get us back to the \nwarehouse if we want to return.\"\n\nThe elevator came to a stop and the door opened onto darkness. As \nbefore, the elevator light illumined a small space, in which the men \ncould see a few counters. When the first passenger debarked, soft \nlights went on. The illumination revealed a room of about 2,000 square \nfeet, filled with viewscreens, computer stations, cabinets and shelves, \ntables and chairs, and a few sofas. At least a dozen doors led from the \nroom. The four unconscious men were laid carefully down onto the sofas.\n\n\"What is this place?\" Zip asked St. George.\n\n\"Haven't any idea, Starman. I don't mind pushing buttons at random when \nit comes to elevators, but you won't find me playing with any machine I \ndon't understand. I don't want to find the ejection seat or rocket \nlaunchers by accident.\"\n\n\"What do you think, Mark, Joe? Let's look around here.\" The Starmen \nbegan to examine the keyboards and control systems spread throughout \nthe room. There were symbols written beside most of the controls, but \nnone of the writing was recognizable.\n\n\"Alien writing,\" observed Mark. \"I'd sure like to know what it says.\"\n\nJoe was at the next console, thoughtfully pressing buttons, but there \nwas no response.\n\n\"We need to find food and water,\" said one of the others.\n\n\"Right,\" said Zip. \"Everyone check through the shelves and cabinets. \nOpen the doors, too, and look through, but don't go anywhere.\" Zip \ndidn't speak aloud what was on his mind. The workings of the asteroid, \nno matter how technologically advanced, had been abandoned for probably \nthousands of years. There could be no water or food anywhere except \nwhere the pirates were. The Starmen and miners may have escaped \ncaptivity, but their freedom would do them no good until they found \nfood, water, and a spaceship. Success in finding even one of those \nitems without being recaptured was highly unlikely. And even if they \ncould board a ship, escape from the asteroid was just about impossible. \nHe wondered how long it would take before someone else realized these \nthings and voiced them.\n\n\"There's nothing, Mr. Foster,\" said one of the men after everyone had \nsearched thoroughly.\n\n\"Mm hmm,\" Zip nodded. \"Well, let's sleep and start again in the \nmorning. Maybe some of us can go back to the warehouse and open up a \nfew of those crates. There may be food and water in some of them. \nOthers can investigate some of the passages that lead away from here.\"\n\nThe men arranged themselves around the room and lay down. \"I think I \nfound the light switch, anyway,\" said Joe and pressed a button next to \none of the doorways. The room became dark.\n\n\n\n\"I assure you, Mr. Zimbardo, there was nothing wrong with the airbot,\" \nasserted a large man, standing before the pirate leader with a half \ndozen of his partners. \"I don't know what threw it back into the \nelevator shaft and I don't know what made it explode-but there was \nnothing wrong with it. The prisoners must have done something to it.\"\n\n\"These prisoners are more than asteroid miners! None of St. George's \nmen has the capability of knocking out two armed men the way those two \nwere knocked out. None of them has the know-how to disable a airbot!\" \nZimbardo turned to his chief control officer. \"Gene! Get me Lather \nright away. Tell him to bring up all information he has on the \nprisoners he brought in from Z25. Tell him to bring especially the \nvideo-record of the prisoners.\" He turned back to the others. \"You're \ndismissed!\"\n\nSoon Lather appeared with a handful of records.\n\n\"Let's see the video-record first,\" said Zimbardo, and pushed his \ncomputer a little closer to his lieutenant. The man inserted the disk. \nIn seconds, a view of the prisoners appeared on the screen, each one \nshuffling by as they entered the Silver Cloud.\n\nWhen all the prisoners had passed by, Zimbardo turned his head down in \ndisgust. Lather opened a file and brought out another disk. \"I've got-\" \nhe began.\n\n\"You fool!!\" spat out Zimbardo through gritted teeth. \"I don't need to \nsee any more! I know who we've got now! How could you miss seeing that \nthe three Starmen who completely destroyed our plans on Mars were your \npassengers for three days! How could you miss it??\" He was shouting \nnow. \"They've been on the news for two weeks! How-\" Zimbardo paused and \ntried hard to get control of himself. \"They were our prisoners! -and \nnow they've escaped! They're loose inside this asteroid, and we don't \nknow where!\"\n\n\"But sir,\" inserted Lather when Zimbardo paused to take a breath and \nclutch the air. \"There aren't many places they can hide. There's not \nmuch to the inside of the complex-only five floors.\"\n\nZimbardo turned to the ship captain. With words that smoldered, he \nsaid, \"The complex of this asteroid is far larger than you think! I \nhave barely begun to explore, and St. George knows more than I do!\"\n\nBack in control now, Zimbardo punched his desk communicator. \"Gene! Get \na search party together and have them scour every part of the asteroid \nthey can find.\" He filled in the details about the Starmen. But he knew \nthat neither the miners nor the Starmen would be found. With George St. \nGeorge leading them, they could be anywhere-anywhere but where his men \nwould be able to search.\n\n\n\nMark came out of a deep sleep into a light doze. He knew he was \nsleeping, but he was also mindful of his surroundings. It gradually \nwashed through him that he was hearing voices. Two voices were \nconversing in very low tones, far away. He had a feeling that the air \nwas thick and the sound had to struggle to get to him. He became aware \nof his eyelids, and they fluttered. Fully conscious but deeply relaxed \nnow, he slowly opened his eyes. He saw only darkness, but it was not \nabsolute.\n\nHe turned his head slowly to the left. Through an open door, about \ntwenty feet away along a corridor were two tall, vaguely humanoid \nbeings wrapped in shadows. Mark's heart leaped and began to race, but \noutwardly he showed no trace that he was alert. His eyes narrowed in an \nattempt to see more clearly. He knew instinctively that the creatures \nwere alien. They walked in utter silence and stepped into the room. \nMark lay frozen. They looked around for a few seconds, then went back \ninto the corridor to the place where he had first seen them. They \nmanifested no ill intent toward the sleepers.\n\nThe figures began conversing in low voices. Mark sensed a deep sadness \nin their tone. He strained to hear what they were saying, what their \nwords sounded like.\n\nSuddenly he heard something that sounded familiar. \"A coincidence,\" he \nthought to himself. They couldn't have said \"Zimbardo.\" After several \nmore exchanges, one of the figures pressed a series of buttons on the \nwall, next to a blank screen. It came alive with a dull silver glow. \nBright green lines appeared in the configuration of a map or blueprint. \nMark strove to see as well as to hear. Slender fingers pointed to one \npart of the screen or another as the conversation continued.\n\nThen he heard it again, this time clearly. \"Zimbardo.\" Mark lifted his \nhead a little and turned so he could observe the screen better. \"A plan \nof the surface control center,\" he thought. He recognized the floor \nplan by its telltale great doors through which the prisoners had been \nmarched.\n\nThe scene changed as one of the figures pressed a button. A series of \ndiagrams appeared, diagrams that indistinctly suggested a power plant \nto Mark. One of the tall figures began talking animatedly, pointing to \nvarious locations and repeating the word \"Zimbardo\" frequently.\n\nSuddenly Mark understood what was going on: the aliens were talking \nabout shutting down the power plant! Mark strained to get a closer look \nat the diagram they were examining. \"The aliens!\" His mind raced. \"They \nmust be the builders of this base! Shutting down the power plant-why, \nthey must want to stop Zimbardo! They're on our side!\"\n\nThen the other figure spoke up. He seemed to agree with the animated \none, but his voice had a sorrowful tone to it. He pressed a few buttons \non the screen and a picture of a warship appeared. As the alien pointed \nto the ship and talked, all the life seemed to drain out of his \ncompanion and he began looking hopeless and despondent. He turned the \nscreen off.\n\nMark didn't understand-what was that ship? Why did it bring such \nhopelessness?\n\nAs the panel went dark, Mark realized with a crushed heart that, for \nsome reason, the aliens were not going to deactivate the power plant \nafter all. He buried his face in his hands. Something was stopping \nthem, something having to do with the spaceship that had appeared on \nthe screen last.\n\nMark looked up and saw that the figures had vanished!\n\n\n10: Both Sides Move\n\nTHE GREAT AIRLOCK on the pirates' asteroid opened. From the depths of \nthe abyss five ships came forth. Emerging from the stone tunnel, they \nmoved into formation and then headed for the Asteroid Belt. Lurton \nZimbardo's lieutenant Crass held the authority over the small fleet. \nEach ship was sheathed with the radar bender, making it invisible to \nthe normal means of detection used by Starlight Enterprise, Space \nCommand, and other Earth-based entities.\n\nAs the ships came into the Belt, Crass gave the command to the other \nfour pilots. \"The target asteroid has been located. Proceed with the \ndestruction of the sats.\" The sats were small, unmanned electronic \nsatellite observers, distributed throughout the Asteroid Belt to aid in \nresearch and navigation. They monitored movement in the Belt and \nprovided constantly updated information on the location, speed, and \ndirection of major asteroids.\n\nThe four ships moved into pre-determined areas in the quadrants around \na small, heavy, black, iron asteroid that was speeding smoothly along \non its course.\n\nCrass stood on the deck of his ship and gazed out at the small \nasteroid. He spoke as if to himself. \"There it is, the first of five \nsurprise packages for our beloved Mars.\" The pirate leader waited \npatiently for the pilots of the four companion ships to report back. He \nexpected that their assignment would take about 45 minutes-maybe as \nlong as an hour. The first report came in 42 minutes later.\n\n\"Mr. Crass, this is Slant. We located three sats in quadrant two and \ndestroyed them all.\" The other reports came in only moments later. A \ntotal of fourteen sats had been located within 600 miles of the \nasteroid where Crass was waiting, and all had been destroyed. Crass \nopened the intercom on his own ship.\n\n\"We're clear. Go to it.\"\n\nOver a dozen space-suited men spilled out of the airlock. They had been \nwaiting for the order from Crass. Each carried a large crate, nearly \nweightless in the Asteroid Belt. They maneuvered easily through space \nand floated gently to the surface of the asteroid-a dark 100-yard wide \nclump of dirty rock. Immediately the men began to distribute the crates \nevenly over the surface of the rock.\n\nThe grim, forbidding, pocked asteroid became the site of frenzied work. \nThe crewmen removed sheet after sheet of dark metal from the crates and \nfastened them to the floating chunk of iron. Tiny flames showed where \nthe irregular metal of the asteroid was being shaped to fit the plates \nthe pirates were anchoring to its surface.\n\nIn one hemisphere three other men were attaching power and propulsion \nunits. They sank holes several feet deep and inserted tubes, fuel \ntanks, and a control mechanism. At one place near the asteroid's \nequator a technician was installing a communications unit.\n\nThe four companion ships had returned and remained on guard less than a \nquarter mile from the asteroid. In less than two hours the work on the \nasteroid was completed and the crewmen reentered their ship.\n\n\"Take us home,\" ordered Crass. The five ships left the Belt and began \nthe quick journey back to their port. Crass smiled most of the way back.\n\n\n\nOn Mars in the communications tower of Eagle City, technician Mel \nGolden was puzzled. Some of his data had just dried up. Mel was \nresponsible for monitoring the sats in a large segment of the Asteroid \nBelt, and a section over a thousand miles in diameter had gone dark. He \ncalled to his superior.\n\n\"Will, I've got something curious here.\" A slender, middle-aged man \nwith long gray hair walked over to the console.\n\n\"What is it, Mel?\"\n\n\"Look at this. You asked us to report anything out of the ordinary. \nWell, occasionally one sat will malfunction, but it looks as if at \nleast a dozen have stopped reporting all at once. I haven't plotted out \nthe details yet, but there's an entire section of the Belt where \nnothing's happening.\"\n\n\"When did it start?\"\n\n\"Just a moment ago. So whatever occurred out there happened \nabout...\"-he thought for a second-\"about eleven minutes ago.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Mel. This could be the surprise we've been waiting for. I'll \nreport this immediately.\" Will went over to the master communicator in \nthe tower and sent a top priority message to Space Command's \nheadquarters on Mars, describing the situation. Space Command \nheadquarters forwarded the information to its centers on Earth and the \nMoon, as well as to Oritz Konig, SE's Head of Security in Mars Base.\n\nKonig's report to Richard Starlight included these words: \"It looks \nprobable that the pirates have taken some sort of action in the Belt. \nThere are no population centers of any size within 10,000 miles of the \nplace, and no known solitary miners. It's a completely dead spot, and \nsats are spaced very thinly there. Yet fourteen sats in a sphere at \nleast a thousand miles in diameter were put out within a ten-minute \nperiod. No natural phenomenon can explain that. Space Command has the \nclosest ship, but it won't get to the site for a little more than 22 \nhours. The nearest backup ship is more than three hours after that. SE \ndoesn't have a ship of any kind at all within four days of the site, so \nwe'll have to depend on Space Command for the first reports.\"\n\n\n\n\"Wake up! Everybody wake up!\" Starman Joe Taylor was shouting.\n\n\"What is it? What's wrong?\" Voices came from several men, jerked awake \nby Joe's outburst.\n\n\"Food! There's food here!\" he burst out. \"And water! Someone brought us \nfood and water! Lots of it!\"\n\nWithin seconds everyone was up and crowding around Joe. Now that he had \nroused his companions, he was bent over a half dozen large boxes, one \nof which was partially open. He reached in and took out a container \nfilled with fruit. He handed it to one of George St. George's men, \nreached into the box again, and withdrew a vessel with water in it. It \nhad a spigot on it as if it were made for traveling. The men began \npassing it around, drinking deeply. Joe dug in again and brought out \nanother box. He opened it and held it up so that others could see. It \ncontained several layers of items like large crackers.\n\n\"Where did it come from, Joe?\" Zip asked.\n\n\"I don't know, Zip! I woke up before anyone else and noticed these \ncrates. I jumped up, looked around but didn't see anybody. I opened the \nfirst one and saw the fruit. That's the whole story.\"\n\n\"You don't know it's safe! You took a chance, Joe!\"\n\n\"What kind of chance, David? Where were we going to find water, much \nless food? We were done for without this.\"\n\n\"Not too much of a chance, I think, Zip,\" whispered Mark to the \nred-haired Starman. Zip turned his head and looked at Mark curiously. \n\"The food's okay. Let the men distribute it and I'll tell you what I \nknow.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Zip nodded. He turned to George. \"Let the men take the crates \napart and see what we've got here. We'll eat and then we'll make \nplans.\" George took over operations while the three Starmen stepped \naside.\n\n\"What do you know, Mark?\" asked Zip. Mark told the other Starmen what \nhe had seen in the middle of the night.\n\n\"Hmmm. Hard to credit it, that the original builders of this wonder are \nstill here,\" mused Zip. \"Why would they let Earthmen come in and take \nover? I gather from what we've learned and what we've overheard that \nthe pirates have been active here for over a dozen years, and George \nfound this place over fifteen years ago.\"\n\n\"The pirates haven't really taken over, Zip,\" said Joe. \"It looks as if \nthey haven't gone beyond the first few levels! Something's kept them \nout. Only George was able to get beyond the floor where the warehouse \nis. Maybe that's why Zimbardo wanted to find him and keep him alive. \nGeorge doesn't know too much about this, this, I don't know what to \ncall this place, but he knows more than any human living.\"\n\n\"Whatever the truth is, we have some friends,\" contributed Mark. \"They \ndon't want to be seen, but they'll help us. I'll bet a golden asteroid \nthat they're the ones who destroyed the airbot. I think we need to be \nready to see what happens next.\"\n\n\"You're right, Mark,\" said Zip. \"We'll have to be prepared to move.\" \nThe Starmen went back to the group. Everyone was seated on the floor or \non chairs, eating a welcome and refreshing breakfast. The four men who \nhad been rendered unconscious by the airbot had benefited from a good \nnight's sleep and were back to normal.\n\nMark reached into one of the crates and took out one of the items that \nlooked like a large cracker. He saw that several of the miners were \neating them. Zip had also taken a bite out of one and was chewing \nthoughtfully.\n\n\"What do you think of these crackers?\" Mark asked.\n\n\"Survival food,\" opined Zip. \"The fruit is delicious, though.\"\n\nWhen everyone had finished breakfast, George St. George asked, \"What \nshould we do now, Mr. Foster?\"\n\n\"I was just going to ask you the same question, George,\" answered Zip. \n\"Let's get the men together and make some plans.\" George called the \nminers together. Zip delivered a short speech, informing them that he, \nJoe, and Mark were Starmen and gave a brief summary of their \nassignment. With a nod, Zip asked Mark to tell what he had seen during \nthe night. Then a number of men began to ask questions.\n\nAll at once the room dimmed. The voices stopped suddenly. After a few \nseconds, one of the corridors lit up with a soft, pleasant light. \n\"That's the way we go, I think,\" said Zip. \"Pack up the food.\" The \ncontents of the remaining cartons were distributed among the men and \nZip led the way. He felt more hopeful than he had since the Starmen had \nlanded on Z25.\n\nThe corridor extended for several hundred yards in a straight line. \nMany doors and other passages led off in different directions, each \nmarked with one or more figures, none of which was familiar. The \npassageway was plain and utilitarian. After more than five minutes of \nwalking, the men came to an intersection of passages in a large, \nfaintly illuminated room. The lights in the corridor faded behind them. \nAcross the room was a row of elevator doors. A row of lights lit up \nover one of them. Zip strode boldly across the floor to the elevator \nthat had been indicated, and the others followed without a word. When \nhe was within twenty feet of the door, it opened. After the men entered \nthe compartment and laid down their burdens, the door closed.\n\nOn a control panel, one light gleamed and Zip pressed it. When he had \ndone so, another light went on. He pressed that one. After he had \npressed six lights, no more came on, and the elevator began to descend. \nAfter about a minute, the movement stopped and a door behind the men \nslid open, opposite to that through which they had entered. The men \nturned and inhaled sharply.\n\n\"Oh my! Oh my!\" exclaimed Zip, but no one heard him.\n\nIn front of the men was a power plant of impossibly immense size, in \ndusky darkness. There were low murmurs as of engines pulsing far away \nor of winds passing through trees, but they were quiet sounds. The \nceiling was out of view, lost in blackness above them. A seamless iron \nfloor, perfectly level, stretched out before the men as far as they \ncould see. The left wall was beyond their vision; the right wall was \nabout thirty yards away. Lights were located sparsely throughout the \nfacility.\n\nGargantuan tubes, gleaming silver in the lights and ribbed like a torso \nof a dragon, snaked through a heavy latticework of girders. Iron pipes \na foot in diameter ran by the dozens through the open spaces. There \nwere catwalks, elevators, and enclosed spiral staircases in strategic \nplaces. Great metal containers bearing dials and lights of various \ncolors took up much of the space.\n\n\"Go,\" said Zip. His voice came out as a whisper, which he had not \nintended. He swallowed and said it again, a little louder this time. \n\"Go on, move out. It's okay.\" The men stumbled forward, filled with awe \nso overwhelming that it paralyzed their vocal cords.\n\nFinally Joe caught his voice. \"This is great! Wow! This is GREAT! \nFANTASTIC!!\" He pushed through the miners in front of him and ran \nforward about twenty feet. He shouted as loudly as he could. \"HEYYY!!\" \n\nThere was no echo. His yell disappeared as if it had been damped. He \nsuddenly felt chilled and afraid. He turned back to the others and \nrejoined the crowd. He sidled over to Mark. \"This place is great,\" he \nwhispered with a smile. Mark's eyes were upturned and shining with \nappreciative wonder.\n\nZip moved to the front of the company. In a quiet but determined voice \nhe said, \"Let's go. We'll just follow the main aisle, straight in front \nof us.\" He began to walk and the others followed. \"Don't forget the \nfood,\" he threw over his shoulder. Two men turned back to retrieve \ntheir supplies and then ran to join the others.\n\nJoe moved up to the front and walked next to Zip. The Starman leader \nwas setting a brisk pace.\n\n\"Isn't this place fantastic, Zip? Just think of the people who can \nbuild a thing like this!\"\n\n\"I am thinking of them,\" answered Zip. His brow wore the characteristic \nfurrow that showed he was not completely at ease.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Joe, as if he hadn't a care.\n\n\"Something bothers me. Our unseen friends, if they are the ones who \nbuilt and maintain this asteroid, are highly advanced \ntechnologically-far in advance of anything we're likely to achieve for \ncenturies. But from what Mark told us, it's obvious that they're afraid \nof something. I can't see that they'd be afraid of Zimbardo and his \ncronies. They're afraid of something else, something we don't know \nabout yet-and that makes me afraid.\"\n\nHe continued his fast pace and Joe kept up with him, but Joe's eyes \nglanced into the shadows as they walked.\n\n\n11: An Asteroid is Missing\n\nTHERE was a breeze. A very light breeze, a mere breath. Mark could feel \nit on his cheek, just a slight chill that was pleasant. He had not felt \nair moving since he had been on Mars.\n\n\"Surely, the air cannot move in here,\" he thought to himself. He lifted \nhis eyes upward. As he expected, the lights failed before they revealed \nthe ceiling immensely far above. \"How far?\" he wondered. \"A half a \nmile? A mile? More?\" The lights looked almost like stars, placed in the \nstrategic joints and balconied work areas of the monstrous iron \nlatticework.\n\nThe refugees from Lurton Zimbardo's prison had been walking through the \npower plant for some time-long enough to have covered at least a mile, \nand probably closer to two. Though the surroundings were obviously \nnothing more than the power station of the asteroid, the men were as \nhushed as if they were in a cathedral. They were small figures in an \nenormous place, reminded of their smallness and overwhelmed with a \nsense of the numinous.\n\nMark sifted through his memories to a time when he was a child of about \nsix, and his parents had brought him to Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico. \nHe had stood in an immense room below ground, large enough to contain \nseveral football fields. He had exulted then, identifying for the first \ntime his restlessness inside, his search for something larger than \nhimself, something that could fill a universe.\n\nHe spoke aloud to no one in particular. \"When I was in Carlsbad Caverns \nabout a dozen years ago, the ranger told us that the temperature inside \nthe caverns was constant. This is like that.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" responded Joe. \"This is a kind of cave. Look at the floor. \nPerfectly smooth, like glass. Artificially shaped, of course, and \nsealed, but it is the substance of the asteroid-no manufactured \nflooring. We must be in the deepest part of the complex here. I feel \nalmost as if we are on the bottom of an ocean.\"\n\n\"Joe! Mark!\" called Zip from the front of the procession. The men \nstopped walking and the two Starmen joined Zip. \"Look at that,\" said \nZip, with a lift of his chin.\n\nA computer screen about four feet square was set into the side of a \nhuge, gray fabrication of metal, shaped like a cube at least fifteen \nfeet on a side and made of thick plates held together with rivets. \nDozens of pipes in a tremendous variety of sizes came into the cube and \nextended away, disappearing into the dark distance. Some were the \ndiameter of soda straws and a few were large enough for a man to crawl \nthrough. Most were as thick as a man's wrist.\n\nMark stepped up to the screen at once. Below it was a keyboard without \nmarkings. He pressed the button which was located in the same place on \nthe board as the button he had seen the midnight visitors press to \nactivate their screen. A few buttons lit up with tiny green lights, but \nthe screen remained black. He tried a few more buttons, but there was \nno response.\n\n\"Nothing doing. If you'd like to take a break here, Zip, I'll try a few \nmore combinations. We're so far away from the surface of the asteroid, \nI'm sure Zimbardo will never find us now.\" When Mark said \"Zimbardo,\" \nthe screen flashed briefly on each syllable.\n\n\"Hey!\" exclaimed the Starman. The screen flashed again. \"Zimbardo!\" he \nsaid again, and the screen repeated its performance. \"It's voice \nactivated! And it recognizes Zimbardo's name!\" Mark tried a series of \nstandard commands for voice-activated computers, but got no response to \nany words other than \"hey\" and \"Zimbardo.\"\n\n\"Take your time, Mark; I don't think we're in a hurry down here,\" said \nZip. For half an hour, Mark tried voice commands and combinations of \nkeyboard strokes, but made no progress.\n\n\"This place is oppressive,\" said one of the miners, after a long \nsilence. \"I don't like being closed in by darkness.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said another. \"On the asteroids we can see for thousands of \nlight years, but inside here it seems as if life is swallowed. I feel \nas if I'm in something's stomach.\"\n\n\"Starman Foster,\" said George St. George. \"I think we had better move \non. We need to come to the end of this giant room and get back to light \nand living quarters of some kind. With all this excitement we've had, I \nthink the men are just about completely exfluncted.\"\n\nZip paused a moment and looked into the distance, then nodded. \"Okay,\" \nhe agreed. \"This room can't go on forever. Let's find the end of it.\"\n\n\n\nLurton Zimbardo was in the control center of the asteroid. A small \ngroup of his most trusted assistants stood silently by. Through the \nwall of glass on his right he could see the cavern where the pirates' \nspaceships were anchored to the landing field. Five of them were out on \nassignment in the Belt. As the work crew on the asteroid was able to \nproduce sufficient sheathing, power, and propulsion units, a space crew \nwas assigned the task of outfitting the asteroids that Lurton had \npreviously chosen.\n\nThe first, under the leadership of Crass, had returned that morning. \nAnother had gone out almost immediately afterward and one more would \ndepart the next morning. By the end of the following day, the last two \ncrews would be launched.\n\nCrass' assignment had included the destruction of the sats while he \nperformed his task. Now that the pirates knew how easy and fast it was \nto complete the work, they did not bother to destroy the sats in the \nremaining four sites. Zimbardo knew that the destruction of the sats \nwould alert Space Command, but the authorities would not be able to \nstop the project before his ships returned. Once they learned what he \nwas doing they would expect that he had only one asteroid to command. \nThe remaining four would be a shock to them and give him, Zimbardo, a \npowerful psychological edge. He would need it for his last demand. Even \nhis most trusted lieutenants had no inkling of the enormity of his last \nploy.\n\n\"Now in contact with G670,\" uttered Zimbardo, referring to the asteroid \nthat Crass and his crew had rigged. The screen was lit up before him. \n\"Two minutes and four seconds to go from right...now!\" A countdown \nclock was set at his left. The pirate captain checked his figures one \nmore time. He had plotted the orbit of Mars, the thrust and direction \nof the power units on G670, the speed of the red planet in its course \nand its rotation, the anticipated acceleration of the asteroid, and the \ntime delay involved in making adjustments to its course. He had checked \nhis computations half a dozen times and then commanded three others to \ndo so.\n\nThree, two, one... read the countdown clock. Zero. Zimbardo pressed the \nbutton. He remained motionless for at least ten seconds. Then he sat \nback and exhaled loudly. He had not noticed that he hadn't been \nbreathing. Then he turned and smiled broadly to his audience.\n\n\"Five and a half days from now, everyone in the Earth-Moon-Mars system \nwill know who we are!\"\n\n\n\nOritz Konig was making another report to Richard Starlight. \"The Space \nCommand ships came onto the site and found no sign of human presence. \nThey quickly replaced the sats, got them activated, and then checked \ndata. I don't know how to explain it, Richard, but an asteroid is \nmissing. Other than that, there is nothing different in the area of the \nBelt that had gone dark, but obviously the pirates have done something \nwith an asteroid. It's not a very big one-only about 100 yards in \ndiameter, maybe a little more-but it's vanished.\"\n\n\n\nThe Starmen and miners had been walking more than three hours, and \ncovered a distance of about ten miles.\n\n\"A wall,\" announced Zip. \"We've come to the end of it at last.\"\n\n\"You'd think that a race that can make elevators go sideways could have \ncome up with a way to traverse this gymnasium quicker and easier than \nwalking,\" grumbled Joe.\n\n\"Didn't I hear you say that this place is great?\" inquired Zip.\n\n\"It is. Back then, I meant 'great' like 'magnificent'; but now it just \nfeels like 'great' as in 'really big.'\"\n\nThe company came up to the wall. There was a bank of elevators in front \nof them and several sets of doors to their right. In a large open \ngathering place, there were many platforms like flat beds, with rods \ncoming out of one end and sticking up perpendicular to the beds.\n\n\"Joe,\" said Mark, investigating one of the beds. \"Here's your easier \nway to travel. These things must be some sort of dolly or truck. I saw \na lot of them where we first came out of the elevator, but I didn't \nrecognize them.\"\n\n\"And we didn't know how big the room is, either, so we didn't look for \nmeans of transportation,\" added Zip.\n\n\"No wheels,\" said Joe, peering at the apparatus, \"and doesn't need \nthem. Magnetic, probably, with this iron floor. Man,\" he said with \nexaggerated disgust, \"we could have floated in comfort the whole length \nof the place.\"\n\n\"We're here now,\" said Zip, matter-of-factly. \"What happens next? We'll \nsee if our friends are still with us.\"\n\nThe men waited for some sign of guidance, but there was only silence. \nNo lights were activated over an elevator. Minutes dragged on. \"Try the \ndoors,\" said Zip at last, and walked to the nearest elevator. He \npressed buttons, but nothing happened. \"Go on, try the other ones,\" he \ncalled out with a wave of his hand. Some of the men went to the other \nelevators and pressed buttons. Others went to the standard doors \nadjacent to the elevators, but they did not open.\n\n\"Well, I guess we have to go back,\" said Joe. No one laughed.\n\n\"This one's open,\" called one of St. George's men. They all turned and \nsaw an open door-the tenth in a row of identical, unmarked doors along \nthe wall. The man didn't go through it but waited for Zip. The leader \nof the Starmen went through the portal onto a metal deck. Stairs went \nupward. He began to climb, with the others following after.\n\nThree flights up he came to another door, which opened as he set foot \non the landing. He went through it into a room outfitted as a small \nhangar. Five spaceships of alien design were clamped to the floor. At \nthe far end of the hangar was an airlock.\n\nWalking gingerly, Zip stepped out a little farther into the hangar. The \nairlock was enormous and perfectly clear, revealing thousands of stars. \nThough it had been only a few days since he had seen a starscape, now \nit almost seemed as if he were perceiving the heavens for the first \ntime. A feeling of awe coursed through him.\n\n\"We're almost free,\" he whispered.\n\n\n12: First Impact\n\n\"ALIEN SPACECRAFT!\" murmured Joe, slowly. \"Magnificent!\"\n\nHe and Mark had followed Zip into the hangar. George St. George and his \nmen came after them. They huddled close together and remained at the \ndoor while the Starmen strode across the floor of the hangar toward the \nspacecraft.\n\nThe five ships were sleek craft with a highly swept delta wing design. \nThe hulls were a startlingly reflective deep forest green color. The \ncraft looked identical to each other, each about 75 feet long with a \nwingspan of about 45 feet. The windshields were black and opaque. They \nlay horizontally on the floor of the hangar, all pointed toward the \nairlock.\n\n\"Beautiful! Just gorgeous!\" exclaimed Mark. As he approached the alien \ncraft he noted that the hull was not merely colored, but patterned. \"Oh \nmy! Look at this!\"\n\nJoe and Zip were right behind Mark and came over to see what the big \nStarman was showing them. The hulls were not only beautifully colored, \nbut showed evidence of leaf patterns. Subtle gradations in color gave \nthe impression that the ships were almost camouflaged-that they could \nland in a deep forest and become almost invisible.\n\n\"This is a work of art, a work of genius!\" exclaimed Joe.\n\n\"How do you get in?\" asked Zip, looking for a door. He was running his \nhands over the surface. There was no sign of a doorway, no seal or join \nanywhere he could see or feel. He could see his reflection in the side \nof the spacecraft as if he were looking into a still pool in a forest.\n\n\"So close, yet so far,\" said Mark. \"Here are ships, there is an \nairlock, but we're not any closer to escaping than we were before.\"\n\n\"This'll take some time,\" said Joe, with a grimace. \"It's probably \nvoice-activated, like the computer screens below.\" The company had \npassed large computer screens regularly on their trek through the power \nplant. \"All we need to do is learn the language of an alien race we \ndon't know, have never met, and whose language we can't read. Then we \ncan break free of here.\"\n\n\"Let's get busy,\" said Zip. \"I like a challenge. We were led here by \nour hosts. There has to be a way.\"\n\nZip went back to George St. George and his men. \"We'll be working on \ngetting into one of the spacecraft and learning how to use it. You can \nhelp by exploring this place and finding out what's here. George, would \nyou please take an inventory of what we've got in the way of food and \ndrink and make a plan for making it last as long as you can. We'll also \nneed spacesuits. We can probably fly without them if we have to, but \nit's a bad risk.\"\n\n\"Okay, Zip. We'll do our part,\" responded George. His men scattered \nthroughout the hangar. There was a lot to investigate. It was only \nabout 200 yards long and 50 yards wide, but was lined with cabinets. \nThere were shelves and racks with equipment of various kinds, some \nrecognizable and some decidedly not. More than a dozen doors opened \ninto the hangar. Zip went back to the spacecraft the Starmen had chosen \nfor their escape vehicle.\n\nJoe and Mark were at the closest work station, where there were tools \nof curious manufacture.\n\n\"What can you guess about the alien race that built this place?\" asked \nJoe as he ran his hands across a set of tools, picking one up and \nputting it back down. \"What do we know about them?\"\n\n\"They're humanoid, definitely,\" replied Mark as he gazed at a rack of \ninstruments. \"We've already agreed on that. I assume that the two \nfigures I saw last night are from the people who constructed this \namazing facility. Can't guess why they're not out in force here, unless \nthere are only a few of them aboard. Can't guess why they don't show \nthemselves. Don't know how old this asteroid is or what it is for. But \nthey're definitely humanoid. Even if I hadn't seen them, we could tell \nthat by the shape of the tools and everything else we've seen.\"\n\n\"And the food they gave us is not too different from what we're used \nto. And think about this: they put fresh fruit in those food packages. \nThey must have a hydroponic orchard somewhere in this asteroid. There \nmust be a huge portion of this complex that no human has ever seen-and \nmaybe can't get into! This place is big enough to house an entire city. \nMaybe there are thousands of them here! George said that he only \nexplored a tiny part of the inhabitable region when he was here. \nEverything we've seen tells me that they're a lot like us.\"\n\n\"That might tell us something about the nature of the universe, Joe. I \nlike to wonder about things like that.\"\n\n\"And look, these spacecraft have wings. They're not just for travel in \nthe void; they're made for flight on a planet with an atmosphere.\"\n\nZip came over the joined the conversation. \"If they helped us get from \nthe warehouse area to this hangar, why aren't they helping us get into \nthe spaceships?\"\n\n\"Maybe there're only two of them-the two I saw last night,\" suggested \nMark. \"Maybe they're caretakers or something like that, and not \nspacemen. Maybe they don't know much more than we do how to get into \nthese beauties.\"\n\n\"Well, whatever the reason, I guess we're on our own, at least for the \ntime being.\"\n\n\"Looks like some sort of laser here,\" said Joe, picking up an object \nthat resembled a flashlight. It had two dials on it with signs of \ncalibration, and a button that was probably intended to activate it. \n\"If it is a laser, and if these dials move the power from low to high, \nwho knows which end is which?\"\n\n\"Take it into the power plant and aim it at the floor. An instrument \nthat small can't have too much power and won't hurt a half mile of \nsolid iron. See what happens,\" suggested Mark. \n\nJoe shrugged. \"Okay.\" He went over to the door through which they had \ncome a half hour before. He was back in a few minutes.\n\n\"It's a laser, all right. This dial here changes the intensity of the \nbeam from low to high, and this one-well, watch. There's a barrel of \npowder over here. Talcum or something.\" He reached in, took a handful \nof the dust, and dropped it back into the barrel. A cloud of dust rose \nup. He activated the laser through it. A bright blue beam appeared. He \nturned a dial and the beam became a brilliant green.\n\n\"Lasers of different frequencies, all in one tool!\" Mark exclaimed.\n\n\"Yeah, and it's got red too!\"\n\n\"Lots of possibilities with this,\" said Zip. \"I'll bet it can be used \nto open the spacecraft. The doors can't be only voice-activated, or \nthey couldn't open the door in a vacuum. What else is there? Heat, \nmagnetism, light? They used heat, body heat, on the panel back in the \nroom where we were kept prisoner. Heat won't work in deep space. Let's \ntry light. We've got the tool here.\"\n\nThe Starmen went back over to the spacecraft. Joe set the laser for \nblue light and ran the beam over the surface of the ship. For several \nminutes he tried various colors and intensities. When he set the laser \nfor yellow light, there was a change in the surface of the ship.\n\n\"Ah!\" said all three Starmen at once. The outline of a door appeared, \nwith markings in several places. Joe experimented a little more, \nplacing different intensities on the markings. In a moment he was \nrewarded. The door recessed a few inches into the ship, and slid aside \nwith quiet efficiency. Joe immediately stepped through the portal.\n\nThe furnishings of the alien spacecraft were similar to what the \nStarmen were familiar with, but the control panel was more challenging. \nSome controls were obvious, since they were necessary for any \nspacecraft; others were completely unfamiliar.\n\nAfter about an hour of looking around, Joe sighed, \"Gonna need more \ntime, Zip.\"\n\n\"I know. We'll just have to dedicate ourselves to it until we feel \nconfident enough to take the ship into space.\"\n\n\"I'm making some progress here,\" announced Mark. He was at a side panel \nnear the navigation station. As he worked the keyboard, various \nschemata appeared in quick sequence. \"I can't read anything, but it's \nobvious that these are engines. I can't recognize everything that's \ncoming up, but most of it I can. See, here is a circuit diagram, and \nthis part here can only be a reaction chamber. I think this ship might \nuse cold fusion for power, but I can't know for sure until I can read \nthis stuff, or see it in action.\"\n\n\"You figure it out, Mark, and I'll fly it,\" said Joe confidently.\n\n\"Well, this stuff is you boys' specialty,\" said Zip. \"I've got to think \nahead to the next problem. Assuming we can get this rig to fly, and \nassuming we can open the airlock, we've still got to escape the \npirates. I doubt this ship is one of the invisible ones, and they'll \nhave us spotted and speared in less then three minutes if we just fly \nout of here, saying, 'Thanks for the hospitality, sorry we have to \nleave so soon.'\"\n\n\"You can figure it out, Zip! We'll get this grand machine ready!\" Joe \nwas enjoying the challenge. It was hard to keep him down.\n\n\n\nAfter eight hours of work on the spacecraft and with dinner behind \nthem, Joe said to Mark, \"Let's go back into the power plant and see if \nwe can't find some way to sabotage the system so that the pirates can't \nfind us when we take off. You can bring up some files on those huge \nscreens. Maybe we can even find some way to close down their whole \noperation.\"\n\n\"Sounds good to me,\" said Mark, picking up a glass of water. He took a \nsip and swished his mouth with it, then swallowed. \"Best we can do \nwithout toothbrushes, I guess.\"\n\n\"If it were that easy,\" said Zip, \"our hosts would probably have shut \ndown the pirates long before this. After all, it's their plant and they \nknow it better than anyone.\"\n\n\"You've got to be right, Zip, but I don't like sitting around. We've \nbeen in this room all day and I'm ready for a break. I really do like \nthat huge plant. Man! Imagine a room ten miles long!\"\n\nThe three Starmen descended the metal stairs and exited into the \nenormous plant. A few yards away was one of the large computer \nterminals. Mark went over to it and activated it.\n\n\"I can recognize a few things, now that I've been through so many of \nthe files upstairs,\" he informed his partners. \"This, I think, is the \nlighting system.\" He pressed a button. There was a loud \"chunk\" sound \nand the plant lit up brightly.\n\n\"Ow!\" said the three Starmen and covered their eyes. They were not \nprepared for the sudden brightness. When they could tolerate the light, \nthey looked above them. Without a word, Mark lay down on his back and \njust stared upward. Rank after rank of lights went up on the iron \nframework for nearly a mile. A ceiling the color of charcoal was barely \nvisible, with what looked like rectangular viewports imbedded in it.\n\nJoe and Zip remained standing and looked to their left. The lights \nblazed for about half a mile. Beyond that point was darkness.\n\n\"It will take a lifetime to learn everything there is to know about \nthis place,\" said Mark dreamily.\n\n\"I think we'll be back someday,\" replied Zip. \"What else can you do, \nMark?\"\n\nMark got up and turned the lights off. It took nearly a minute for \ntheir eyes to adjust to the dimness. While Mark looked through file \nafter file, Joe and Zip wandered through some of the iron latticework. \nThey climbed spiral staircases for a level or two before descending \nagain, and examined the connections of tubes, pipes, and circuits.\n\n\"I've got something!\" called out Mark. The others ran to him. He \npointed at the screen. \"See, this is the main power generator. I can \ntell because of the coils over here and the way the circuits are \nconnected. There are about eight of these; they must be spaced in a row \na little over a mile apart. They can operate singly or in combination. \nBut look! They don't just power the life-support systems-in fact, I \nhaven't found that part at all yet. But these are thrust systems! Do \nyou know what that means? This asteroid is a spacecraft! It's made to \ntravel!\"\n\n\"Can't be!\" said Joe, flabbergasted\n\n\"It is. Look.\" Mark flipped past a few more files, pointing out the \nconnections and the diagrams of chambers, coils, and energy field \ngenerators. \"I'm just barely getting a glance at this stuff, of course, \nand I don't understand it all, but I have no doubt about what I've seen \nso far.\"\n\n\"Why don't you look for that life-support file and see if you can turn \noff the pirates' energy or something?\" Joe suggested.\n\n\"No, Joe,\" said Zip. \"As I said before, if it were a good idea, our \nhosts would probably have done it already. I think that whatever \nthey're not doing, we shouldn't try to do. Remember, even St. George \ndidn't want to fiddle with something he didn't understand.\"\n\n\"George is a real nice guy, Zip,\" said Joe, \"but I still think he's \nbreathed a little too much vacuum for his own good. You have to \nexperiment in life, sometimes.\"\n\n\"I want to learn more about this power system! This is amazing!\" \nrhapsodized Mark. \"If I'm right, this button here will...\" He pressed \nit. Almost at once a stream of paper began to feed out of a slot to the \nright of the terminal and fell down, sheet by sheet, into a gathering \ntray. Mark picked up the first sheet.\n\n\"It's printing out the diagrams of the thrust system. just like that. \nYou're right, Joe-this place is great!\"\n\n\n\nOn the northeast edge of the massive area on the surface of Mars called \nthe Mare Hadriacum, stood a complex of domes and cylinders. Made of \nmetal and glass, it stood on an open plain about 35 degrees south of \nthe equator and 85 degrees east of the central meridian. The complex \nwas one of five atmosphere-generating plants on Mars, and the only one \nin the southern hemisphere. In a small crater nearby was the settlement \nof New Emmaus, with a population of about 12,500.\n\nThe long process of terraforming Mars had begun when a meteor shower \nstruck the fourth planet in 2009, significantly raising the temperature \nof the atmosphere and altering the weather systems. With this jump \nstart serendipitously provided by meteorites, Earth had hastened the \nprocess of making Mars livable by scattering the surface with spores \nand seeds, introducing desert-hardy animals, and establishing the five \natmosphere-generating plants. Thanks to Earth's efforts, the planet's \ntemperature had continued to rise. Eventually water had emerged from \nbelow ground and from the ice caps around the poles, and the air was \ngradually thickening.\n\nTerraformation had been taking place for almost 150 years, and it would \nbe at least another two centuries before it would be possible to live \nanywhere on Mars without a spacesuit. The atmosphere-generating plants \nwere critical to the process. The plants themselves were automated, \nwith all systems operated and monitored by robots, and the major \ncenters of population on Mars were located in craters not far from each \nplant. The complexes were on the open surface of the planet rather than \nin craters, but the air they created flowed first into the nearest \ndepressions in the surface, and it was here that most settlements were \nlocated.\n\nThe plant located in the southern hemisphere was the most remote, but \nhad been filling the Mare Hadriacum, locally known as the Red Sea, for \ndecades. This great depression was 2,500 miles in diameter. When much \nof the southern ice cap had melted, it filled the Red Sea with water up \nto about three-fourths capacity, making the region a delightful place \nfor quiet living.\n\nIn the early morning of August 15, 2151, the cloudless sky was a \nbrilliant violet, and the sun was rising like a bowl of molten gold. \nMarshal and Averette North, a retired couple, had climbed to the top of \nthe crater wall to enjoy the sunrise. Six miles away was the atmosphere \nplant, gleaming in the newly-risen sun.\n\nThey were the only ones to see what happened next, but it happened so \nquickly that there was almost nothing to see. In the thin atmosphere, \nthere was only a slight vapor trail and a short-lived but powerful \nwhine; then with a dull, gut-churning thud a ball of black and orange \nflame slammed obliquely into the desert floor within a quarter of a \nmile of the atmosphere plant. An enormous wave of pinkish-ochre sand \nrose up in front of the impact site like a great wall. The shock wave \nquickly blew the wall of sand upward and outward, so that it sparkled \nlike luminous rain until the sand particles became too scattered to be \nseen.\n\nThe shock wave struck the atmosphere plant and shoved it aside as if a \ngiant, invisible hand were violently clearing a table of unwanted \ncrockery. The crater wall where the Norths were standing rocked and \nheaved as if in an earthquake. The shock wave passed them, blowing \ntheir hair and rippling their clothing as if it were a pleasant breeze \nthat died away as quickly as it had come.\n\nThe elderly couple stood frozen in shock and watched the cloud of dust \ngradually fill the entire eastern sky. After several minutes, the dust \nwas thin enough to reveal a horseshoe-shaped crater almost a mile \nacross. On the southwestern edge of the crater, where it trailed off \ninto the desert without a sharp boundary, was the place where the \natmosphere plant had been. Now the plant was broken into many thousands \nof pieces and the wreckage was scattered for three or four miles in a \nwide fan across the sand.\n\n\n13: The Brink of Disaster\n\nTHE ALIEN SPACECRAFT was beautifully designed and well equipped. The \nStarmen had spent more than two days exploring it fully and tracking \nits electronics systems. It was planned for a crew of twenty. The \ngalley was not stocked, but Zip assigned some of St. George's men to \nstore their food in it. The storage area inside the ship included \nspacesuits for the entire crew. The suits were shaped slightly \ndifferently from what the Earthmen were used to. They squeezed a little \nin the chest and were somewhat baggy between abdomen and knee, \nespecially for the shorter men, but they could be used.\n\nJoe and Mark were working to the point of exhaustion, trying to figure \nout the controls in the cockpit. Mark had to trace innumerable leads \nfrom the panel through the walls of the craft back to the wings, tail, \nand especially the propulsion compartment. The Starmen found the work \nexhilarating but time-consuming. Mark estimated at the end of the \nsecond day that he had figured out about 80% of the control panel, \nincluding all the major systems. Joe confirmed his reckoning and, \nwithout even igniting the power, was learning to pilot the alien craft. \nBoth Starmen kept Zip informed of their progress.\n\nIt was still up to Zip to find a way to escape from the asteroid. Even \nif they could pilot the ship, it was certain that the pirates would \nlocate them by radar within seconds of their departure and the chances \nof their escape would be practically nil.\n\nThe atmosphere tanks supplied with the spacesuits were empty, so Zip \nhad to fill them from large storage tanks of pure gases he found to one \nside of the hangar. Since Zip was unable to read any labels, he had to \nanalyze the gas in each supply tank to determine which gases the tanks \ncontained. Once he had succeeded in identifying nitrogen and oxygen, he \nwas able to fill the tanks for the spacesuits with a mixture similar to \nthat of air on Earth. This project was tedious and physically \ndemanding, but St. George's men assisted him with the heavy work. Since \nthe gravity was so low, two men were easily able to move even the \nlargest equipment needed for the work. By the end of the second day, \nall the tanks had been filled.\n\nThat evening, Zip put on one of the spacesuits and practiced operating \nit and moving around inside the hangar. When he was satisfied that the \nmixture of air was breathable and that he could maneuver in the suit, \nhe took off the helmet and walked over to where Joe and Mark were \nsprawled under the spacecraft with a panel open over their heads. The \ndeep green of the highly reflective metal hull was marvelously soothing \nto the eye. For a moment, Zip paused and wondered about the race that \nhad built the ships. Then he called out to the others.\n\n\"Joe, Mark-I'm going through the airlock to see what's out there.\"\n\nJoe skidded out from under the hinged panel. \"Are you sure that's wise, \nZip? We don't know where the pirates are.\"\n\n\"That's why I'm going out. I have a plan for our escape, but I have to \nexplore a little bit outside to see if it'll work.\"\n\n\"Want some company?\"\n\n\"Thanks, I do, but I'll take George. You and Mark keep up the work.\" \nZip went over to where George St. George was sitting at a table with \nseveral other miners.\n\n\"George, could you come with me? I'd like to see what's outside.\"\n\n\"Sure, Zip,\" said the blond man, standing up. The asteroid miner suited \nup and the two men walked to the far end of the hangar. Zip was \ncarrying a small iron plate. In front of them was a huge panel that \ncould open to permit spacecraft to pass through the airlock, and on \neither side of it were sets of doors to allow men through. These doors \nentered a hallway that proceeded to the outside of the asteroid and \nallowed passage without the major airlock's having to be emptied.\n\n\"Ready?\" asked Zip through the suits' intercom system.\n\n\"Sure. Let's go.\" Zip opened the door into the airlock and they passed \nthrough and closed the door behind them. Zip operated the controls that \nsucked the air out of the hallway. The two men walked about 50 yards to \nthe far end of the passage and opened the door to the outside. They \nstepped out onto the surface of the asteroid.\n\nThey looked around, but could see no evidence that there was an airlock \nadjacent to where they were standing!\n\n\"Camouflaged!\" said Zip.\n\n\"Whoever made this wondrous thing,\" commented George, \"apparently had a \nreason for wanting to be hidden. Let's make sure we can still get back \nin. Can you open the door we just came out of?\"\n\n\"No need to worry. I'm not about to close a door behind me for good \nuntil I know I can open it again.\" He took the small iron plate and \nused it to jam the door open. From the inside, the door was \ntransparent; from the outside, it looked like the surface of the iron \nasteroid. Its hinges were completely hidden. \"Now let's see what's out \nhere.\"\n\nFor the first time, the two men gazed outward. The Milky Way blazed \nabove and to the right, its countless stars bright enough to cast \nslight shadows behind the two men.\n\n\"I never tire of seeing that view,\" said George. \"I've missed it, just \nin the few days we've been inside.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's inspiring,\" answered Zip, but he was already in motion, \nwalking and scanning the ground on both sides of him. George followed. \nTheir asteroid boots gripped the surface of the asteroid.\n\n\"What are you looking for, Zip?\"\n\n\"Evidence of the pirates. I've got a plan for escaping them, but our \nexit point here can't be too close to their entrance.\"\n\n\"We've walked a dozen miles through the asteroid from their \nheadquarters-they can't be too close.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you're right, but there may be other entrances. We found one, \ndidn't we?\"\n\n\"Even if there were other entrances, they're bound to be as invisible \nto the eye as the one we just came out of.\"\n\n\"Right again, I'm sure, George, but I don't want to take any chances. \nOur escape depends on our being unseen-at least for most of the time. \nThen I want to be seen.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Zip? I- \" George suddenly stopped talking, almost as \nif his communicator had been turned off. Zip looked over.\n\n\"What's wrong, George?\" Through his helmet, George's eyes were opened \nwide and his mouth was agape. \"What is it?\" Zip repeated.\n\n\"We, we, we're not in the Asteroid Belt,\" George stammered. \"Look, \nthere's the Belt over there.\" He raised his hand and pointed. The slow \nrotation of the asteroid that gave it its slight gravity had brought \nthe Belt into view over the horizon. Motionless on the asteroid's \nsurface, Zip and George were slowly moving into the dawn. A pale sun \nfar away was coming into view, and a golden line of light began to grow \nover the 45-mile-long chunk of almost pure iron. The spacesuits' \nfaceplates automatically darkened slightly. The sunlight came through a \nscattering of asteroids orbiting at least a thousand miles away.\n\n\"He's moved the asteroid. He knows more about it than I gave him credit \nfor,\" Zip said grimly. \"My plan will still work, but the situation has \nchanged. Now we have to hurry. Let's go back.\"\n\nBack inside the hangar, Zip called a meeting of the fourteen men and \nexplained his plan for escape.\n\n\"Sounds good, Zip,\" affirmed Mark, and Joe agreed.\n\n\"What about food and water?\" asked one of the miners.\n\n\"What's left?\" responded Zip. \"How many days can we go if we ration \neven more strictly?\"\n\n\"About five until the food runs out, and there's about a gallon of \nwater for each man left.\"\n\n\"We can do it. No choice anyway. Let's get some sleep and start things \nrolling first thing tomorrow.\"\n\n\n\nImmediately after they awoke, the Starmen put Zip's plan into action. \nJoe opened another of the alien spacecraft. The Starmen had taken a \nquick look at the other ships in the hangar and found them to be \nidentical. Quickly they made the ship look as if it had been abandoned \nin panic. When they were finished, two men carried a small tank of \noxygen into the storage area. Joe then piloted the ship through the \nairlock to a point where it hovered just above the asteroid. Zip, Mark, \nand two miners stood outside on the ground. An explosion rocked the \nship, and a panel was blown out from the wall of the storage area. Joe \nhad detonated the oxygen tank to make it look as if some cargo had \nignited and destroyed the ship.\n\nJoe emerged from the main door and jumped to the ground. He had been \ntethered and the others pulled him in. They went back through the \nairlock and shut the door. They were still able to watch what happened \nthrough the immense window, transparent on their side. The ship began \nto drift away from the asteroid on a pre-arranged course Joe had set.\n\n\"The pirates should be seeing that on their radar in a few minutes,\" \nsaid Zip. \"I figure the ship has to be at least a quarter mile from the \nsurface for it to register on their screens.\"\n\nBut it was nearly ten minutes later that three pirate ships appeared. \nThe pirates could easily see the ripped panel on the ship and took only \na few precautions on approaching the derelict. Zip turned to a \n\"reception only\" channel on the communicator his suit provided.\n\n\"It's not an Earth ship, sir,\" said a voice, \"and it's empty. \nCompletely derelict. Must have been clamped to the surface of the \nasteroid and got shaken off when you moved it out of the Belt.\"\n\n\"Go inside! Make sure there's no one in it!\" It was the commanding \nvoice of Lurton Zimbardo. \"Look for any sign that the Starmen had \nsomething to do with it!\"\n\n\"Yes sir!\" The orders were given and six men left one of the pirate \nships and went through the open door of the alien craft. It took less \nthan a minute to get a report.\n\n\"Nothing here, sir,\" said one of the spacesuited men to his officer. \n\"The cargo area has been completely destroyed in an explosion, and the \nwall has been blown open into empty space. There are no suits, no signs \nof any habitation.\"\n\n\"It's an old wreck, sir, and so damaged that it can't be used,\" \nreported the pirate officer to headquarters.\n\n\"Probably left by the beings who built the asteroid,\" said Zimbardo. \n\"Come on back to work. I'd like to take a look at it, but we don't have \nthe men or time right now. Other matters are pressing.\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\" The communication terminated. The pirate ship took back its \nsix crew members and the three ships cruised over the horizon.\n\n\"Part one, the least risky part, successful,\" said Zip. \"Let's get \ngoing on part two, right now. Joe?\"\n\n\"Ready Zip,\" the lanky Starman responded. He stepped through the \nairlock and leaped off the iron surface of the asteroid toward the \nderelict. Powered by small jets of oxygen he sped to the ship and \ndisappeared through the open door.\n\n\"Everyone else get busy,\" called Zip. They ran back through the airlock \nto the hangar. The others were already aboard their escape craft. Zip \npiloted it through the airlock and kept the ship close to the surface \nof the asteroid. The airlock closed behind them. In the meantime Joe \nhad caused the damaged ship to drift back down toward the asteroid out \nof radar range. He and Zip brought the two ships together and made a \nlink. Joe left the broken ship and joined the others.\n\n\"Ready, Zip\" he announced, once he was aboard. Zip put the slightest \npossible power into the escape ship, then turned the power off. Both \nships began to drift away from the asteroid, so slowly as to be almost \nunnoticeable. Zip was hoping that when the pirates saw the blip on \ntheir radar, they would conclude it was the derelict and pay no \nattention. He was ready to drift for as long as it took to escape the \nnotice of the pirates before turning on the power and setting a course \nfor freedom. But now that the asteroid was not in the Belt any longer, \nhe knew that they would have to drift for much longer than he had \nanticipated.\n\nThey were free. But the tension was thick. It would not dissipate for a \nlong time. \n\n\n\nForty-two hours later, Marshal and Averette North witnessed the impact \nof an asteroid that turned their atmosphere plant into rubble. Within \nan hour of the impact, Lurton Zimbardo opened a channel that allowed \nhim to speak through nearly every communication system on Mars. Gene \nhad previously discovered a method for entering and using all \ncommunication bands on Mars except those that were most closely \nguarded. He had surreptitiously placed automatic signal points into the \nMartian system without activating them until this moment. Now that the \nmoment had arrived, the voice of the pirate leader was heard throughout \nMars.\n\n\"This is Lurton Zimbardo. The atmosphere plant at New Emmaus has just \nbeen destroyed by an asteroid impact. You were not able to detect the \nasteroid by radar. It struck without warning. This is to prove that I \nam able to render asteroids invisible and send them wherever I wish. \nYou cannot see them and you cannot stop them. Within a day the four \nremaining atmosphere plants on Mars will be similarly destroyed.  This \nwill convince you that I have more power than you can imagine, and that \nyou are helpless to oppose me. After the last asteroid has struck your \nplanet, I will announce my demands.\"\n\nLurton Zimbardo shut off the microphone in the control center of the \nasteroid. A crowd of at least forty men jammed the center where \nZimbardo sat at the console. The rest of the pirates were standing in \nthe factory or at their assigned work places in the facility. All had \nheard the broadcast. A feeling of immense power and invulnerability \nsurged through them. A few men began to cheer, and within seconds the \nenthusiasm had infected the rest of the pirates and the cheer became a \nroar. It rang throughout the control center and along the corridors, \nand filled the factory. Zimbardo's smile was wide. He looked down \nalmost modestly, as if he were reluctant to accept the men's accolades.\n\nWhen the cheers had died down at last, Zimbardo said simply but so that \nall could hear, \"And now for the last step in the plan.\" The room was \nquiet. He took out a set of notes from his pocket. The paper was marked \nwith scrawls, lines, and columns of figures. His eyes flicked rapidly \nfrom the notes to the controls. His fingers began to fly over the \nkeyboard. He punched in coordinates and set the power grid. He marked \nthe timing of various operations.\n\nGene, Zimbardo's closest associate, was watching. Gradually his smile \nnarrowed. His eyebrows creased. Then his eyes widened and his face \ndrained.\n\n\"Sir!\" he exclaimed in a quiet voice. \"Those are the coordinates of \nEarth! If you use those, you'll take this whole asteroid directly to \nEarth!\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" nodded Zimbardo. \"In about 32 days, as I figure it.\" He was \nsmiling widely again as he pressed \"Enter\" and activated the asteroid's \npropulsion system.\n\n\n14: The Shield of St. George\n\nTHE CONVERSATION was very quiet, but the microphone picked it up. The \nwords that passed between Lurton Zimbardo and Gene were heard by every \npirate on the asteroid. There was complete silence. The pirates' \nenthusiasm and their complete trust in Zimbardo's leadership was \ninstantly badly damaged. Though no one spoke, many of the men began to \ndoubt their leader's sanity, and became afraid.\n\n\"But sir,\" pleaded Gene. \"This asteroid is the key to our success, and \nwe're all its passengers. If you program it to collide with Earth, \nI...\" words failed him.\n\nZimbardo smiled indulgently. \"Gene,\" he soothed, as if explaining \nsomething obvious to a confused child, \"I'm not going to cause us to \nsmash into the Earth. We want to control Earth, not destroy it, and how \nbetter to do it than from a close orbit around the planet in this \nmagnificent flying base? I'm taking us to Earth, and there will be \nplenty of time to adjust our course once we get close. We will \naccelerate until about midway there, then decelerate until we achieve \norbital speed.\n\n\"I will, however, inform Earth that I have sent an asteroid more than \nforty miles long on a collision course-an asteroid they can't see and \ncan't stop! They will meet any demands I make! They will definitely \nmeet any demands I make, after we destroy the five atmosphere \ngenerators on Mars with pinpoint accuracy. Relax now. In a month or so, \nwe will be the undisputed masters of the third planet-and all without \nleaving home!\" He laughed.\n\nGene grinned and also laughed, but while Zimbardo's laugh was deep and \ngenuine, Gene's was a little forced. He was relieved, but his trust in \nZimbardo's leadership had suffered a severe setback. He would be on his \nguard from here on. He looked up and caught the eye of Mr. Lather. His \nface was hard and unsmiling; it was difficult to tell what he was \nthinking. Gene turned and looked at Gebbeth. His expression was marked \nwith merciless determination. He, at least, appeared convinced and \nprepared to follow Zimbardo all the way. But Gene was no fool; he \nlooked around and surmised that the majority of those in the room were \nharboring secret reservations.\n\nGene didn't blame them. He felt the same way. He would stay with \nZimbardo for the time being, but he would keep a careful eye on the \nsituation and look for a way to ensure his personal safety if it \nappeared that the pirate leader had lost touch with reality. The \npirates were looking for power and prestige, not a suicide mission.\n\n\n\nFor almost two days the Starmen and the miners had been drifting in \nspace, not using power of any kind, afraid that even using lights might \ndraw the attention of the vigilant pirates on the asteroid. The \ndistance between the ship and the massive iron asteroid with its \nfascinating interior was increasing incrementally, but not quickly \nenough to please Zip. He chafed with impatience.\n\nMark's first duty once the fourteen men were aboard ship was to \ndiscover their location. Since the escapees were using no power at all, \nMark could employ only observation and mathematics to get his estimate. \nHe guessed that they were 1,023 miles from the nearest edge of the \nAsteroid Belt and drifting roughly parallel to it.\n\nThe Starmen's plan was to head for the nearest SE facility. If Mark's \nestimate of their position was correct, the facility closest to them \nwas an unmanned Starlight Enterprise station on O344, a medium-sized \nasteroid coming their direction. As soon as it was safe to use power \nJoe would pilot the alien ship to the station.\n\n\"We'll be okay in a few hours, Zip,\" said Joe. \"You got us out of the \nasteroid with food and a ship. We all thought that would be impossible. \nWe ought to be able to turn on the energy and get blasting out of here \nbefore too long.\"\n\n\"I know,\" responded Zip, with his characteristic furrowed brow. \"We're \ncaught between taking a chance on being recaptured by the pirates and \ndepleting the food. We'll run out of supplies in a couple of days.\"\n\n\"I know-and the closest base is roughly four days away, depending on \nhow speedy this beauty proves to be. But we'll make it.\" Joe went off \nto visit with Mark, who was gazing out of the window at the immense \nspread of the Milky Way.\n\nGeorge St. George came up to Zip, who was sitting alone at a table, \ndoing nothing but staring down at his hands. He sat down opposite him; \nwhen Zip looked up, the miner smiled.\n\n\"You've brought us back into the heavens, young Mr. Starman,\" he said, \n\"so you've got no reason to be covered with gloom. You won't get us to \nsafety now any faster by worrying.\"\n\nZip pursed his lips and looked into St. George's eyes. \"The man seems \nto be protected by a shield of innocence all around him,\" he thought. \n\"His base was destroyed, he and his men were captured and taken into a \nmassive iron asteroid by the Solar System's greatest enemy, and now \nhe's floating in the void with only two days' food left, and he's still \ncalm and trying to encourage me the way he encourages his men. Who is \nthe real leader of these men? I make the decisions, but he strengthens \ntheir hearts. He even strengthens my heart.\"\n\nSt. George smiled. Almost as if he could read Zip's mind, he added, \n\"Each of us has a gift according to the grace given us, which we are to \nuse to benefit others. If it weren't for you, we'd still be locked up \ninside that room-or worse-under the control of Lurton Zimbardo. I have \nmy gift, and you have yours, and we both employ our gifts well. We \nhaven't come this far to fail now. Our success doesn't depend solely on \nyou, you know. Relax and just do your part. There's still a lot to do, \nbut the outcome isn't in doubt.\"\n\nZip smiled, and before he could say anything St. George had risen and \nstrolled to the window where Joe and Mark stood.\n\nAll at once, Mark pointed and cried out, \"Hey, look at that! Do you see \nwhat I see?\" Several men came to the window and peered out. Zip Foster \njoined them. Joe answered.\n\n\"Yes! -the asteroid's moving!\"\n\nThe dark bulk of the pirates' asteroid, which had loomed so close to \nthem for two days, was gradually but visibly moving away. Its \nsilhouette had been blocking half their view of the Asteroid Belt and \nthe gleaming array of stars behind it, but now, even as they watched, \nits profile diminished and stars were winking into view around its edge.\n\n\"They're heading out somewhere-moving that entire asteroid! I wonder \nwhat's going on?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"We'll be able to power up before too long, now! We'll be on our way \nourselves,\" announced Zip, animatedly. \"Soon we can get in touch with \nStarlight. It's been over a week since we've been in contact. We've got \na lot to tell them.\" The shadow that had lain over Zip for two days had \nbeen lifted. \"How long until we can turn on the power, Mark? When will \nwe be out of the pirates' radar range?\"\n\n\"Less than an hour, I'd say.\"\n\nZip raised his voice so everyone could hear. \"We get under way in an \nhour, men!\"\n\nIt was sooner than that. In 26 minutes, the asteroid was no longer \nvisible to the eye. Zip waited a full 45 minutes then turned on the \nship's power at its lowest setting. Using the radar, he scanned the \nquadrant where the asteroid had last been seen and turned up no object \nof significance. He hadn't expected to.\n\n\"That doesn't mean they can't see us,\" he mused to Mark and Joe. \"That \nasteroid is probably sheathed just like their ships. But I think we're \nsafe now-safe enough, anyway, to get moving.\"\n\n\"Right. Let's go,\" said Joe. \"I'll jettison the derelict and power up! \nI've been looking forward to this moment!\"\n\nZip ran the power switch up to maximum and commanded everyone to \nprepare for acceleration. Joe ignited the propulsion system. With the \nlanky Starman at the controls the alien ship began its journey toward \nthe Asteroid Belt. As the ship began to cruise easily, Zip began to \nthink of communicating with Starlight Enterprise.\n\n\"Mark, contact SE right away. Fill them in on our recent adventures and \nsee if, by any chance, there's a ship closer to us than the base on \nO344.\"\n\nGeorge St. George spoke up. \"What if the pirates overhear your \ntransmission, Zip? Won't they know we've escaped and be able to locate \nus?\"\n\n\"I think it's worth the risk, George. They probably think we're still \ninside the asteroid and won't be looking for us out here. Even if they \ndo overhear the transmission, I doubt they'd send some ships after us. \nThe distance between us is growing rapidly, and if we have to we've got \nplenty of time to hide in the Belt. I'm worried about our dwindling \nsupplies; we need some relief soon, and SE needs our information as \nsoon as we can get it to them. Go ahead, Mark.\"\n\n\"I'm on it,\" said Mark. \n\n\"Provide them with a concise but complete report,\" Zip went on. \"Tell \nthem about the destruction of Z25, describe the asteroid with an \nestimate of the number of pirates and their ships, and especially the \nasteroid's location. Don't worry about details of our escape, other \nthan to say that we are in an alien spacecraft and heading for O344 \nwith a minimum of supplies. Ask Sim Sala Bim to send someone to O344 \nwith the Star Ranger and another ship to take St. George and his men \nback to Ceres or wherever they want to go.\"\n\n\"Got it,\" said Mark and began to prepare his report. In less than five \nminutes he had sent it, but due to the interplanetary distance he \ndidn't expect a response for nearly half an hour.\n\n\"Sure wish we had that realtime transmission equipment on board,\" mused \nZip out loud, thinking about how his encounter with the pirates had \nbegun with the experiment in the control tower in Eagle City. \"But I \nguess it'll be a few years before the miniaturization is worked out so \nthat spaceships can carry it.\"\n\n\"We'll get to the base a little faster than we thought, Zip,\" said Joe. \n\"This ship is cruising very efficiently. We can learn a lot from it, in \ntime.\" The sleek, forest green cruiser sped through the vacuum, rapidly \napproaching the edge of the Asteroid Belt.\n\n\n\nSix hours and 23 minutes after the destruction of the \natmosphere-generating plant on the edge of the Red Sea on Mars, a small \niron asteroid struck the plant located just south of the Oxia Palus on \nan open plain about five degrees north of the equator and fifteen \ndegrees west of the central meridian. It was a few minutes past 4:00 \na.m. local time. Six miles away was the settlement of Westcott.\n\nMost of the local populace had not heard Lurton Zimbardo's radiocast, \nsince it had come in just before midnight. The second asteroid followed \na near-vertical course and slammed with tremendous force into the \nground a half mile from the atmosphere-generating plant. The sun rose \nonto a land choked with dust. When the dust settled back to the surface \nabout midday, the people of Westcott saw only a crater a mile and a \nhalf wide. There was no sign that any human artifice had ever existed \non the spot.\n\nAlmost sixteen hours later, on an overcast afternoon in the empty \nnorthwest, the third asteroid struck. Its target was the atmosphere \nplant located 51 degrees north of the equator and 141 degrees west of \nthe central meridian-southwest of a small crater which was the home of \na town called Morris. It was centrally located for miners, prospectors, \nfarmers, arborists, and mobile scientists, who lived near or roamed \nthroughout the locale.\n\nBy this time Zimbardo's message was known all over the planet and the \nutter destruction of the first two atmosphere generators had shown that \nhis threat was to be taken seriously. Morris had been abandoned, and \nits 25,000 residents were in panicky flight to the northeast, opposite \nthe plant. Few people saw the asteroid make a direct hit on the two \nbillion solar complex.\n\nSeven hours and 12 minutes later, the fourth asteroid demolished the \natmosphere plant located nine degrees south of the equator and 167 \ndegrees east of the central meridian. It was evening, and the resulting \ncloud of dust created a sunset of spectacular beauty, with colors \nrippling through the drifting sand like fire seen through a translucent \ncurtain.\n\nThe final impact occurred in the early darkness hours. The atmosphere \nplant located northeast of Eagle Crater at 26 degrees north of the \nequator and 85 degrees east of the central meridian was instantly \nturned into rubble.\n\nIn a thirty-two-hour period, Mars had been scarred by five new craters, \neach one a mile to a mile and a half across. More than ten billion \nsolars in damage had been done. Atmosphere generation on the red planet \ncould not be restored for at least five or six years.\n\nMuch more satisfying to Lurton Zimbardo was the fact that the entire \npopulation of Mars was held inescapably captive by an hysteria of fear. \nNo one doubted that Zimbardo had spoken his threat accurately. The five \nasteroids had arrived unseen until the last few seconds and had \npulverized their targets with accuracy of less than half a mile of \nerror. The fearful populace of Mars awaited the promised communication \nfrom the pirate leader, in which he would reveal his demands.\n\n\n15: A Microwave Net\n\nSPACE COMMAND and Starlight Enterprise were filled with intense \nactivity. The previous day had been a roller-coaster ride of messages \nfrom Mars and the Asteroid Belt. First came the dismal news of the \ndestruction of the Martian atmosphere-generating plants, one after the \nother. Then just before the tidings that the plant near Eagle City had \nbeen demolished, the message from the missing Starmen had come into \nStarlight Enterprise. The euphoria with which that word had been \nreceived was quickly dampened by the ultimatum Lurton Zimbardo had \nissued.\n\nIn words similar to those Troy Putnam had used weeks earlier, Zimbardo \ndemanded control of Earth's wealth and resources, with specific demands \nfor access to Earth's coded defense mechanisms, authority over major \nports of travel, and power over the major decision-making processes and \ninformation systems. He closed his threat with the chilling \nannouncement that he had already directed a sheathed asteroid more than \nforty miles long into a collision course with Earth. When his demands \nhad been met and verified, he would then turn the asteroid aside.\n\nImmediately after receiving the message, the President called a meeting \nin one of his maximum-security offices on Earth. Joining him at the \ntable were some of his senior advisors as well as Richard Starlight, \nhis chief assistant John Rwakatare, and other representatives of SE. \nRobert Nolan with his chief assistant Beowulf Denn and other \nrepresentatives of Nolan Mining Enterprise filled out the gathering.\n\n\"Although he has demanded control of Earth's systems of communication, \nexchange, and security, I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that \nZimbardo's real object is not clear.\" The President was drawing \nconclusions after a brief introduction of the facts. \"It is impossible \nfor one man simply to become dictator of the entire planet, no matter \nwho he is or what engines of destruction he can call upon. I suspect \nthat his aim is other than he has announced, and I am determined not to \nprovide the access codes to our most sensitive systems.\"\n\nThere was a slight rustle of movement around the table. Whatever course \nof action was to be decided at this meeting, calling Zimbardo's bluff \nhad not been considered by many to be a viable option. The President \ncontinued.\n\n\"His ruination of the atmosphere plants on Mars proves that he is able \nto direct asteroids to targets with high accuracy, and that we are \nunable to detect them. Although the loss of the plants is a severe \nblow, it is not crippling. They can be rebuilt in a few years. At \nworst, the process of terraformation will be delayed for that long. \nReplacement will cost about ten billion solars-obviously a huge amount \nof money, but an amount that Mars can afford. The plants were over a \ncentury old however, and in the long run replacing the plants will be \nmore effective and probably achieve the goal of terraformation faster \nthan if we had continued to use the plants that were destroyed. \nFrankly, there were plans already in the works for modernizing the \nplants.\n\n\"No, the real damage has been psychological: the people of Earth and \nMars are terrified. This, undoubtedly, was Zimbardo's major goal in \ndestroying the plants, and he has achieved it completely and \nthoroughly. His demands to us are clear, but it is difficult for us to \nperceive what he would achieve, even if we capitulated-which we do not \nintend to do.\"\n\nRobert Nolan could not contain himself any further, and lurched \nbackward as if he had been struck. \"You don't intend to cooperate with \nhim?\" he almost screeched. \"But he'll destroy the entire planet if we \ndon't! There is no way we can detect an asteroid he's made invisible to \nradar!\"\n\n\"Dr. Nolan,\" responded the President, \"we believe that we have a method \nwhich will allow us to locate the asteroid that Zimbardo has directed \ntoward Earth. We have a very good chance of locating it and destroying \nit.\"\n\n\"A chance? Mr. President, you're gambling with the very existence of \nlife on Earth! If an asteroid forty miles long strikes Earth, it will \nnot only cause the extinction of every life form on the planet, there \nis every likelihood that it will crack the Earth's crust! There will be \nno escape! No escape!! Don't you see that we have to cooperate with \nZimbardo? It will be easier to meet his challenge once he has turned \naway the asteroid!\"\n\nThe President responded in gentle tones. \"You have not yet heard our \nplan, Bob. Believe me, I can sympathize with your quandary, but I am \nsimply not going to deal with any evil force as if it had a right to \nnegotiate. It doesn't. This has been the principle behind the decisions \nwe have made in order to meet the threat of the pirates from the first \nday.\"\n\n\"Principle?\" Nolan was almost shouting now. \"For your principle you're \nwilling to risk the destruction of all life on Earth? That's the evil \nwe're facing here!\"\n\n\"Bob-please listen to what Dr. Hoshino has to tell us. There is a plan. \nDr. Hoshino?\"\n\nRobert Nolan leaned forward, placed his elbows on the table, and \ncradled his head in his hands. He was trembling. Richard Starlight \nlooked over at his friend and colleague and felt very badly for him. He \nknew that Robert was under a tremendous strain. Richard agreed that the \nfate of the Earth was at stake and would probably be decided at this \nmeeting. He was tremendously anxious himself, but he was eager to hear \nwhat Dr. Hoshino had to say.\n\nDr. Stephen Hoshino was a brilliant astrophysicist whom the President \nhad commanded to work on a plan to counteract Zimbardo's chief \nweapon-the radar bender. He was a slight man of Japanese ancestry who, \nin spite of his compactness, exuded power. Even his smallest movements \nwere made with precision. Although he was only in his middle thirties, \nfrom his late teens he had been granted virtual carte blanche in his \nresearch. Even at that young age, his genius had become known \nthroughout the inhabited Solar System. His voice was calm and \nmellifluous.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. President. My team and I have been working around the \nclock for eight days to develop a system for detecting an object which \nis invisible to radar. We have succeeded. The theory was not difficult \nto develop, but the method provided somewhat of a challenge. We have \nnow designed a technique for locating a body as small as, very roughly, \ntwo-thirds the size of the average spacecraft, by detecting its \ngravitational field.\"\n\nAs he spoke, many of those listening to him felt the level of their \nanxiety diminishing slightly. Robert Nolan lifted his head. Though his \nexpression was drawn, he was paying attention.\n\n\"We must manufacture millions of tiny probes and release these into \nspace in a systematic fashion over many millions of cubic miles. Their \ndesign is quite simple. The laboratories and manufacturing centers of \norganizations like Starlight Enterprise, Nolan Mining Enterprise, and \nother companies can create these probes in vast quantities very \nquickly, using robotic techniques. Each probe will have gravity \ninstrumentation. Using the microwaves naturally occurring in space, \nthey will be connected by a vast neural network and thus act as a \nsingle instrument, with all data being fed back to various information \ncenters.\n\n\"With the data from these probes we should be able to detect any \nmassive objects in places where they shouldn't be. Certainly a large \nasteroid cannot be hidden. The very size of the asteroid with which \nZimbardo threatens our planet will work in our favor, since detecting \nsuch a large object can be achieved easier and sooner than if he sent, \nfor example, a number of small asteroids such as those that struck \nMars.\"\n\n\"Where will the probes be deployed, Dr. Hoshino?\" asked Richard. \"Our \ntime is short, very short indeed, if we have to manufacture, launch, \nand deploy the probes in time to locate and then destroy the asteroid. \nEven if we produce millions of probes, as you have said, we have \nmillions of cubic miles of space to search through. In the time \navailable, even trillions of the little probes can't help much. \nTheoretically, the asteroid can be anywhere. There are asteroids inside \nthe orbit of Mercury and outside the orbit of Jupiter. But I suspect \nthat you already have an idea where we are to search.\"\n\nThe President answered. \"When Zimbardo sent his first message to Mars, \nevidence of his tampering with the Martian communication system was \ndiscovered. This allowed us to trace how his tampering was done and \ntherefore where the signal came from-at least in a general direction. \nAfter he sent his second message, the one to Earth yesterday evening, \nthe signal was traced again. We have learned that his base is moving \ntoward Earth and we have an idea of the speed his base is moving and \nits direction. The information the Starmen provided confirms what we \nhad learned through our investigations.\n\n\"Of course, our figures are somewhat imprecise, and we still have a lot \nof searching to do, but we have an excellent chance of locating him. It \nis highly logical that the asteroid he harnessed is from a place in the \nBelt close to his own asteroid. From what the Starmen reported, he just \ndidn't have time to locate an asteroid as large as he claims to have \nlaunched toward Earth from any place too distant from his own base. The \nprobes will therefore be cast in a net in the space between Earth and \nthe area of the Asteroid Belt in which the pirates' asteroid was found.\"\n\nRichard Starlight, Robert Nolan, and others had a number of technical \nquestions for Dr. Hoshino regarding the manufacture and deployment of \nthe probes and the time schedule necessary to achieve their goal. At \nthe end of the discussion it was agreed that the two companies, with \nothers, would begin to manufacture the probes according to Stephen \nHoshino's design. Launch was planned for five days later, with \ndeployment six to seven days after that.\n\n\n\n\"O344 coming up on the screen, Zip,\" announced Mark.\n\n\"Not a moment too soon!\" shouted Joe. \"Food at last!\"\n\nIt had been a week since the fourteen men aboard the alien spaceship \nhad left the pirates' asteroid. They had been traveling under power for \nfour days. Although they had been very sparing in their consumption of \nthe food, they had run out two days earlier. A few ounces of water per \nperson remained in the containers; it had been carefully measured and \nrationed to last the entire journey to O344. Everyone was thirsty but \nno one was in danger of becoming dehydrated. All, however, suffered \nfrom the pangs of hunger. Mark had a headache that blurred his vision \nand made his responses slow.\n\n\"If it's on the screen, we ought to touch down in a few minutes,\" said \nZip. He was moving slowly and often sat down with his eyes closed. Of \nthe three Starmen, Joe seemed to be the least affected by the two days' \nlack of food. The miners were lying down on their bunks. Other than \nJoe, only George St. George had exhibited much energy in the previous \ntwo days, coming forward to the flight deck every few hours to chat \nwith the Starmen.\n\nZip asked George to prepare his men for touchdown. Deceleration had \nbeen gradual, so there was no need for the men to strap into the \nacceleration couches. However, they would need to be in spacesuits in \norder to leave the ship and enter the SE facility.\n\nAn asteroid about ten miles across loomed up on the screen. Joe circled \nit slowly.\n\n\"There it is,\" he said as a landing pad came into view. A small dome \nnext to the pad was barely visible, since the landscape that had been \nartificially shaped was on the dark side of the asteroid, away from the \nsun. The site on O344 was one of dozens of such places marked on the \nnavigational maps. They were unmanned stations stocked with supplies \nand maintained for explorers, scientists, and others in the employ of \nStarlight Enterprise. They contained large quantities of food, water, \nand other basic necessities, and provided rustic living facilities.\n\nIt didn't take Joe long to land the ship on the surface of the small \nasteroid. It settled down gently just a few yards from the dome.\n\n\"I'll need someone to go into the supply cache and get some bolts, Zip. \nThis ship doesn't have any to keep it fixed to the asteroid-or if it \ndoes, I haven't found the controls for them. I'll have to stay aboard \nuntil the ship is secure.\"\n\n\"Okay, Joe,\" Zip responded. \"Great flying. You pilot this ship as if \nyou were trained in it.\"\n\n\"That's my job,\" said Joe. \"Don't take too long, though. I'm hungry!\"\n\nThe men went through the ship's airlock, made the brief walk across the \nsurface of the asteroid, and entered the dome. The dome contained a \nsmall airlock leading to a ladder that descended about 15 feet into the \nasteroid. Zip asked two of St. George's men to locate bolts and go back \nup to clamp their ship to the surface. Within minutes the alien ship \nwas fastened down tightly and all fourteen men were inside the supply \nstation.\n\n\"Food! Toothbrushes! Showers! Clean clothes!\" shouted various voices as \nthe men scattered to look over the spartan facility.\n\n\"Food!\" shouted Joe, and headed for the pantry where George St. George \nwas already standing.\n\n\"Relax, Starman!\" said St. George, placing his hand on Joe's chest. \n\"You three men have worked without rest to get us here. Just sit down. \nLet us show our gratitude by fixing up the best meal this larder can \nmake possible.\"\n\nThe three Starmen were only too ready to comply. They allowed their \ntired bodies to sink slowly into the rest sofas, the minimal gravity \nnestling them gently into the concave surface. The miners who were not \nassisting in the preparation of the meal lay down on bunks in the \nsleeping quarters.\n\n\"I don't know if I need sleep or food more,\" said Mark. He had been at \nthe navigation and communications stations almost without respite for \nall of his waking hours-and he had slept little. Zip had relieved Joe \nat the helm some of the time, but the trip had not been an easy one. \nThey had made the journey as quickly as they could in an unfamiliar \nship, having to keep watch at all times against a surprise attack from \nany pirate ships. Their communications with SE had been limited only to \nthose most urgent, to minimize their exposure to any possible enemies.\n\nSE had made an immediate and joyful response to the Starmen's initial \ncommunication. That had been followed within an hour by a report to \ninform them of Lurton Zimbardo's ultimatum about a large asteroid on a \ncollision course with Earth. The latter message had draped the men in a \nsomber mood. SE had also assured them that a rescue mission was under \nway from Ceres, and several ships, including their own Star Ranger, \nwere due in nineteen hours. The Starmen and the miners planned to put \nthat time to good use by resting.\n\nUnder St. George's direction, three of the miners put together a feast \nof canned goods. St. George made a blend of canned meat, potatoes, and \nvegetable soups, and warmed it to create a hot stew that was more than \npassable. Dried biscuits, rehydrated and quick-baked, were added to the \nfeast. A huge pot of strong, brewed coffee soon added to the savory \nsmells coming from the kitchen.\n\n\"It's ready!\" called out Sabbath George. He and the others brought huge \nserving bowls to a large table that was situated in the middle of the \nroom, adjacent to the kitchen. Places had been previously set.\n\nTired as the men were, it took them only seconds to assemble at the \ntable. George said a few words of thanks and passed the first bowl to \nhis right where Joe was seated. Joe grasped the large serving spoon. \nThe bowl was steaming with the mixture and wisps rose lazily from the \nladle as it made several trips from serving bowl to Joe's plate. After \nhe had dished out at least two pounds of stew, he shoved the bowl on to \nthe man at his right and took two biscuits from the central supply.\n\n\"Only two biscuits, Joe?\" prodded Mark. \"Has hunger made you too weak \nto eat?\"\n\n\"I'll show you whether I'm too weak to eat. Watch this!\" He shoveled a \nheaping spoonful of stew into his mouth. His chin lifted a notch, his \neyes closed, and a satisfied moan escaped his closed lips. He slowly \nlowered the spoon to the table and lifted both hands as if he were \nabout to embrace someone.\n\n\"Taste good?\" asked Zip, reaching for the aromatic bowl as it came his \nway.\n\nJoe chewed and swallowed. \"Someone back at the Academy told me once \nthat there was no such thing as a dumb question. He was wrong. That was \none.\" Joe turned to George. \"George, this is delicious! I've never \ntasted anything better!\"\n\nGeorge glanced over at the food cans that had been in storage for \nseveral years. \"A hungry man will enjoy anything. A very hungry man \nwill consider even canned goods to be ambrosia.\" But by that time the \nserving bowl had gotten around to George, and he stopped to fill his \nown plate.\n\n\n16: A Dark Spirit\n\nTO STARMAN David Foster, it was a soft, rainy morning. He had just \nawakened after a night on the SE supply asteroid O344, and the only \nsound was the faint hum of the operating system. He wrapped himself a \nlittle more snugly into his blanket and kept his eyes shut. His \nimagination easily turned the murmur into the soft sound of rain \nsifting through the leaves of the tree outside his bedroom window on \nhis uncle's farm in West Virginia. With slightly more effort he could \nimagine a drizzle drumming lightly on the wooden shingles above and \ndrifting out onto the empty fields in the early autumn days shortly \nafter harvest.\n\nHis Uncle Francis and Aunt Clare were dear to David. Although he had \nbeen raised on the Moon, close to his father's work, he had been born \nin Clark's Bridge Crossing, the village near their farm. From the time \nhe was old enough to show any notice of the world around him, David had \nloved the stars. Even now, he loved interplanetary travel, exploration, \nand adventure better than anything, but in his heart was an \nemotionally-intense place where he kept his memories of the West \nVirginia farm where he had spent so much of his childhood.\n\nThe small towns and family-owned farms had become indispensable to the \nrebuilding of America after the Collapse. In the United States the \nnuclear devastation of those horrifying years had been severe. Most \nmajor cities had been destroyed, but much of the outlying and rural \nareas had survived. In the latter half of the 21st century new \nleadership arose from these areas, and the American spirit, which for a \nhundred years had gradually been eclipsed by special-interest groups, \nlobbyists, fringe organizations, and major corrupt economic interests, \nwas largely purified. The \"old values\" became popular again, if not \nalways followed. A generation of leaders arose with an appeal similar \nto that enjoyed by the \"log cabin\" presidents. A candidate who claimed \nto have basic values and homespun philosophy was guaranteed to win \nsupport from the remaining American population.\n\nWith his eyes still closed, David smiled. He tried to imagine the aroma \nof his Aunt Clare's freshly-ground coffee coming from the kitchen, \nmingled with the smell of hot-off-the-griddle blueberry pancakes. The \ndrizzle was stopping, and the dawnlight of the newly-risen sun was \nsending sparkles through the light rainy haze that shrouded the fields \nand crowning the eastern fields with the arc of a rainbow. The haze \nwould soon burn off, leaving the dark earth sodden and leaves dripping. \nHe smiled even wider. He could hear his aunt's voice now...\n\n\"Come and get it, Starmen!\" pealed the voice of George St. George. \"Got \nsome more of that engine-oil coffee steaming away, and I managed to \nwhip together some biscuits from some powdered stuff I found!\"\n\nZip's eyes shot open and took in the neutral walls of the cubicle where \nhe, Mark, and Joe had slept. The faint hum of O344's system was drowned \nout now with the rustle of human movement as the asteroid miners \ngathered around the table.\n\n\"There's some sort of orangy liquid I mixed up from some other powder, \ntoo! Probably has some good vitamins in it!\"\n\nIn minutes the Starmen and miners were tucking in to the best that \nGeorge St. George could do with the supplies at hand.\n\nAfter breakfast, the Starmen sat in the lounge. Mark was poring over \nthe printout that he had taken from the power plant on the pirates' \nasteroid. He had a digital copy of much of the layout of the asteroid, \nand information on the power plants, propulsion structures, and \nsheathing equipment. The papers were filled with charts, maps, and \ndiagrams; a few sections were written in an unintelligible, alien \nlanguage. He couldn't even tell which symbols were letters and which \nwere numbers.\n\n\"I hope they didn't use a pictorial alphabet like Chinese,\" said Joe, \nlooking over Mark's shoulder.\n\n\"No,\" the big Starman answered. \"There are plenty of recurring symbols, \nso I assume it's a language like our own, with letters and words. \nSomebody will be able to decipher this without too much difficulty. \nIt's far beyond my skill, though.\" He rubbed his chin. \"But I can \nrecognize a lot of the machinery.\"\n\nZip was sitting nearby. He hadn't spoken much during breakfast. The \nimages of the farm pulled at him again. \"Mark, Joe,\" he began. He \nhesitated a moment while they turned to him. They could see he was \npuzzling through something, and waited patiently for him to continue. \n\"SE says that Zimbardo has targeted Earth with an asteroid over forty \nmiles long. What'll that do to home?\"\n\nMark was suddenly deeply saddened. Zip always referred to the Moon as \nhome. He spoke softly.\n\n\"One of my professors at Starlight University talked about a study \nconducted in the early 21st century. Back then, scientists started \nbecoming concerned about asteroid impacts, and they built a complex \ncomputer model to see what would happen if a large asteroid struck \nEarth.\"\n\n\"What did they find?\" whispered Joe.\n\n \"Well, the model found that, depending on the angle of entry, the \nimpact can produce a massive corridor of incineration ahead of the \nimpact site. In that area, just about all life ends in minutes. But the \nmodel predicted other changes that destroyed nearly all life on Earth \nwithin a few years.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" Zip's voice was dusky.\n\n\"I'm sounding like a textbook,\" complained Mark.\n\n\"Go on,\" insisted Zip.\n\nMark closed his eyes and tilted his head back. \"A few hours after the \nimpact, clouds of noxious gases billow up and block out the sun for \nmonths. Temperatures drop drastically all over the Earth and corrosive \nacid snow and rain fall. These short-term effects alone-intense cold, \ndarkness, and acid rain and snow-kill the plants and photosynthetic \nplankton, the base of most food chains. Herbivores starve, and then the \ncarnivores that feed on the herbivores starve. This is enough to kill \nmost of the remaining human life on the planet. After the clouds clear, \nthe atmosphere is thick with carbon dioxide from fires and decaying \nmatter. Then the carbon dioxide contributes to global warming that \nlasts for ages.\"\n\nTears slowly escaped from Zip's closed eyes and made tracks down his \ncheeks. He remembered that when he was small his aunt and uncle had \ntaken him on a two-hour flight in their small plane to the place \nclosest to their home where there was a field of nuclear devastation. \nHis first view of the terrain beyond the boundary had been indelibly \nburned into his seven-year-old mind. The cities and towns surrounded by \nfields, orchards, streams, ponds, and woods had rapidly tapered off \nbelow a slight rise into a land of gray, utterly lifeless, gasping dust \nthatreached as far southeastward as the eye could see. The center of \nthe field had been the nation's capital, the third of the great \nAmerican cities to be destroyed in the holocaust of 2048.\n\n\"How big was the asteroid they modeled?\" asked Joe.\n\n\"About six to ten miles across,\" said Mark.\n\n\"And the one Zimbardo has aimed at Earth is forty miles long?\"\n\n\"Bigger. A little bigger than that,\" answered Zip quietly. \"Bigger.\" He \nfelt a chilling darkness come over him, almost as if he had walked into \nan inky refrigerator. He shivered uncontrollably for a moment, then sat \nup and took control of himself.\n\n\"Today we get the Star Ranger back!\" he announced in a clear voice. \n\"and we're heading back to Earth! Be ready for immediate departure!\"\n\n\n\nAn immense metal and glass wheel, half a mile in diameter, rotated \nslowly in the jeweled heavens. It was the primary manufacturing and \nlaunching headquarters of Nolan Mining Enterprise. It orbited the Moon \nabout 500 miles above the surface.\n\nRobert Nolan was burning with a zealous flame of energy. Although often \nclose to burning out, he never went over the edge. His apparently \nbottomless resources had allowed him to achieve remarkable things in \ntwenty years. Now he was in the command bubble that lifted like an \nantenna from the heart of the space station. A tower two hundred yards \nlong lifted out from the plane of NME's manufacturing and launching \nfacility. At its end was a large observation and control center that \ncommanded a view of every aspect of one side of the plant.\n\n\"Launch in forty-three minutes exactly,\" said an operative in the \ncommand bubble. Nolan stood, looking intently over the man's shoulder \nat the screen in front of him. Nolan's eyes shifted repeatedly back and \nforth from the screen to the actuality that lay spectacularly open to \nview before him.\n\n\"Sir?\" said another technician, turning toward Nolan. \"The Lux Mundi \nhas now completed docking.\" The Lux Mundi was Richard Starlight's \npersonal spacecraft.\n\n\"Excellent, John,\" said Robert Nolan. \"Please have Mr. Starlight sent \nup here without delay.\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\" The technician turned back to his station and issued \ncommands. In less than four minutes, an elevator brought Richard \nStarlight into the center of the command bubble of Nolan Mining \nEnterprise. He stepped out onto the floor and looked around quickly.\n\n\"Over here, Rick,\" said Nolan, stepping toward his friend.\n\n\"Bob! Good to see you!\" The men shook hands briefly. \"All went well at \nour end,\" Richard whispered.\n\nNolan stepped back and spread his hands toward the launching arena of \nthe space station.\n\n\"Terrific news,\" he said. \"We'll be launching in about forty minutes.\"\n\nThe two men went into Nolan's office and sealed it. Though everything \nwas visible through clear partitions, no one could hear what went on \ninside.\n\n\"I'm so sorry I fell apart at that meeting, Rick,\" Robert began.\n\n\"Don't give it a thought, Bob. You've done very well for the project \nsince then. This is a great offering you're making.\"\n\n\"The least we can do, in addition to making as many of the microwave \nprobes as we could, is provide these freighters.\"\n\n\"Ahead of schedule, too, by a little bit. All the companies pulled \ntogether and made the probes to Dr. Hoshino's specifications. I like \nhis design. His plan should work very well, very well indeed!\"\n\n\"It's a wonderful design, Rick! Dr. Hoshino is a genius to a degree \nabove everyone else of this generation. We ought to be able to locate \nany asteroid that Lurton Zimbardo throws at us. But stopping it is a \ndifferent problem.\"\n\n\"If we find it in time, that shouldn't be too hard, either.\"\n\nThe two friends talked for a little longer, then went out to watch the \nlaunch. Seven unmanned NME freighters were prepared to carry Earth's \nhope into space. They would be accompanied by a dozen armed ships \nsupplied by Space Command. The rendezvous of freighters and warships \nwas only a half-hour's flight time from the space station. Then they \nwould proceed on the eight-day journey to the site of deployment.\n\nIn a private office and laboratory below, Robert Nolan's chief \nassistant Beowulf Denn finished making a voice recording of the details \nof the launch. He included the number of freighters, the number and \ntype of Space Command warships appointed to guard them, their course, \nhour of departure, and timing of the deployment of the probes.\n\nWhen he had finished the recording, he inserted the disk into a \ncomputer independent of the NME computer system and speeded up its \ncontents so that the entire message was less than 0.03 seconds long. He \nthen encrypted it and transmitted the result on a tight beam \ncommunicator to coordinates in space which he kept only in his head. \nAfter the message had been sent, he destroyed the disk and removed all \nsigns on his computer that the action had occurred. The message he sent \ncould be read only one time and then would erase itself, leaving no \ntrace at the receiving end that it had ever existed.\n\n\n\nSeven ships had arrived at O344. The Starmen were outside, having sped \nthrough the airlock with the first news that the ships from Ceres were \nat hand. They stood on the edge of the landing zone and watched the \nships come close to O344. Only the dark red Star Ranger and one other \nship touched down. Sim Sala Bim was the first to debark.\n\n\"So pleased to see you young men are safe!\" he spouted. \"So much has \nhappened in these three weeks! Here is your Star Ranger, ready for \nduty!\" The Indian was excited. Zip had shaken off his own dark mood and \nwas rising to the challenge. The other two Starmen were eager to lift \noff and get back into the battle against Lurton Zimbardo.\n\n\"Nice to see you, Sim!\" cried out Zip, as he and the man from Ceres \nshook hands through their spacesuits. \"George and his men will be ready \nin a moment. They are wonderful people! Salt of the earth types, though \nI'll bet none of them has been on Earth for years!\"\n\n\"We'll get them back to Ceres safely, don't worry about that!\" advised \nSim. \"You just go on and stop this crazy fellow.\"\n\n\"Let's get going, Starmen!\" urged Zip. They had already made their \nfarewells to the asteroid miners, and had decided to leave the alien \nship on O344 for research in a less anxious time. Joe had sealed it and \nseen that it was securely clamped to the asteroid's surface.\n\nWithin a few minutes, the Starmen were aboard the Star Ranger in their \naccustomed places.\n\nJust before they lifted off, Zip turned on his communicator.\n\n\"George,\" he said. \"Thanks for your friendship. You gave me a gift I \ndon't think you're even aware of.\"\n\n\"Oh yes I am too aware of it, David.\" responded the cheery voice. \"The \ngift of confidence. Do your Latin and find out what 'confidence' really \nmeans. Blessing and peace go with you men.\" A chorus of voices sounded \nin the background, also offering farewells.\n\nZip signed off. In minutes O344 was behind them.\n\n\n\nWhen Lurton Zimbardo had first announced to Earth that he had aimed a \nhuge asteroid through space on a collision course, the news of \nimpending doom spread over the farthest reaches of the globe, bringing \nwith it hysteria and despair. Pockets of unrest and violence sprang up \nbut the phenomenon was short-lived. The memory of the Collapse was too \nrecent, and the populace would not permit violence to prevail-but there \nwas nothing to take its place. Cities, nations, and then continents \nground to a standstill as people left their jobs and homes and wandered \nfrom place to place aimlessly. The thought of utter, unprecedented \ndestruction for the whole planet, the home of mankind, struck at the \nvery heart of the people. The very elderly, who remembered the worst \ndays of the Collapse, felt their spirits quail within them.\n\nIt was a time such as the world had never seen before. In the years to \ncome it became known as The Day the Earth Stood Still. No one knew \nwhere to flee, how to flee, or even if fleeing could do any good. After \na time the panic quieted down to a heartless agonizing despair, and a \nheavy, dark spirit fell over the planet.\n\n\n\n\"Crass, Lather, Bolcher! Get your men and go! The Earthmen have \nlaunched their detection equipment!\" Lurton Zimbardo was giving orders \nover the intercom from the control center of his asteroid. Moments \nearlier the pirate leader had received a message which informed him of \nthe launch time of Earth's freighters and other details of Earth's \ndefense plan.\n\n\"There are seven freighters accompanied by twelve Space Command \nwarships! Each of you take five ships. Find the convoy and destroy the \nfreighters! At all cost, destroy the freighters!\"\n\nZimbardo slammed down the communicator and watched his men scurry for \ntheir ships. At the speed they could travel, they should be able to \nintercept the convoy in about a week-a full day before optimal site for \ndeployment of the microwave probes. Zimbardo had little doubt of the \noutcome of the encounter. Earth had no idea that the plans were known \nto him, and the pirate ships were invisible to their radar.\n\n\n17: The Enemy Revealed\n\nFOR NEARLY seven days, the convoy of seven NME freighters and twelve \nSpace Command warships had sped away from the Earth-Moon system. The \nwarships flew in a spherical configuration about five miles in \ndiameter, at the center of which were the unmanned freighters in \ncompact formation. The urgency of the mission gave the convoy no choice \nbut to utilize the most direct route to the site of deployment, so that \nthe probes could be put into action at the earliest possible time. \nThere was simply no time to follow any evasive flight plan. On the \nsuccess of the microwave net rode the hope of Earth's survival from the \nthreat of impact with the enormous asteroid Lurton Zimbardo had \nunleashed.\n\n\"There they are!\" announced Mr. Lather, pilot of the Silver Cloud, as \nhe looked at the radar screen. He was followed closely by five other \npirate spacecraft. Two other groups of six pirate ships were nearby, \nalso searching the area of space in front of them for the convoy. \n\"Inform Bolcher and Crass and give them the coordinates. Tell them that \nsince I was the first to locate the freighters, I will attack first. \nTheir ships will follow me according to our plan.\"\n\n\"Yes sir, Mr. Lather,\" responded the Silver Cloud's navigator. The \ncommunication was completed and the details of the plan agreed upon. \nThen the intership communications system was deactivated. The pirates' \nships, being sheathed to radar, were equally invisible to each other as \nto the men of Space Command, but each pirate captain knew where the \nothers were supposed to be. The ships usually communicated by \nclosed-system radio and thereby kept in close contact with each other, \nbut now they could not risk revealing their position by engaging in \nradio contact when they were in the proximity of other ships.\n\nMoments went by without a word being said. Lather could feel the \nadrenaline surging through him. He was eager to give the command to \nattack.\n\n\"One minute!\" he announced to his own crew. \"All hands prepare for \nbattle!\" After the designated time had elapsed, he shouted, \"Go!\"\n\nFollowed by five spaceships protected by the radar bender, he sped \nundetected through the sphere of Space Command warships. On the screen \nbefore him the massive freighters loomed up. \"Fire!\" he shouted. \"Fire! \nFire!\"\n\nA laser cannon locked onto one freighter and ripped open its hull. In \nseconds the Silver Cloud was past it and through the other side of the \nsphere. Behind him came another pirate ship, and then another. As each \npassed through the sphere, it fired laser cannons at the freighters.\n\nNone of the lasers struck a vital point in any freighter's fuel system, \nbut the potent cannons, each set on highest power, ripped into the \nunmanned ships and tore them open to the vacuum. Lather's six ships \nshot through the sphere of guard ships without being detected or even \nshot it, but none of the freighters had exploded. Lather cursed when he \nsaw that the damage he had inflicted was not crippling.\n\nThe Space Command warships were immediately aware of the attack and \nbegan to scatter the freighters by remote control. Some freighters \ndecelerated, others accelerated, still others moved away from the \ncenter. Now the pirates would have a more difficult challenge to \ndestroy the NME ships.\n\nAs his fleet circled, Lather waited to see what Bolcher's ships would \ndo. He knew where Bolcher was supposed to be but could not communicate \nwith him without revealing his position to the warships of Space \nCommand. Lather could only watch the screen.\n\nSuddenly one of the freighters exploded into incandescent fury. The \ndetonation destroyed the two freighters closest to the one that \nBolcher's ship had hit. Within seconds a fourth freighter erupted into \nflame as its fuel system ignited. The three remaining freighters began \nto weave in a random pattern, and the Space Command warships began to \nclose in, reducing the window of access to the center of the field.\n\nCrass' ships began to zoom toward the remaining freighters, laser \ncannons ready. Being the most experienced pilot, Crass was confident \nthat his team could eliminate the last three ships. Coming in at a fast \nclip, each pirate ship only seconds after its predecessor, Crass' crew \nstrafed the freighters, scoring two direct hits. \n\nWith a grin of satisfaction, Lather saw that he would have one more \nchance to attack. The protective warships had drawn into a very tight \nformation to protect the last freighter. Its hulk was already torn with \na long rip, but its engine still worked and it responded to controls. \nThe freighter turned and twisted in a random, spiraling forward motion \nwith the warships close around it. Lather brought the Silver Cloud in \nfor the kill.\n\nShooting smoothly through an opening in the protecting ships' \nformation, he saw his target and fired. The last freighter blew up \nalmost in his face. All seven freighters-and their contents-had been \nturned into diminutive pieces of whirling space junk. The Silver Cloud \nsped through the detritus and passed the far boundary of warships. As \nsoon as he had passed the last Space Command ship, three of them fired \nat him almost at once. Though he was invisible to radar, he was visible \nto the eye at the moment he was close to the exploding freighter.\n\nOne Space Command laser pierced the Silver Cloud-a narrow but tight \nbeam. The shaft of weaponlight punctured the crew's living quarters, \nand air began to escape from the pirates' spacecraft. Automatic seals \nquickly stopped the leak and Lather sped on. The exultation he had felt \nat having fired the final destructive bolt had instantly changed into a \ncold dread at his narrow escape. Followed by the other pirate ships, he \nsped on, back toward the great asteroid where Lurton Zimbardo awaited \nnews of their successful mission. \n\nCommander Benjamin Bennett of the Space Command ship Ignis sat \nmotionless for ten minutes after the last freighter had blown up. He \nwas a topflight career space pilot who governed one of the few standard \nSpace Command Fleets of Twelve. His black hair showed no signs of gray. \nBecause of his unspotted record and eminent trustworthiness, he had \nbeen given the responsibility for guarding the freighters. Usually \nlooking much younger than his forty-one years, now he appeared much \nolder.\n\nNo one approached him. Then he spoke, as if into the air.\n\n\"I suppose the pirates are gone now.\"\n\n\"So it would appear, sir,\" said a crewman.\n\n\"Obviously they weren't concerned with destroying us-just the \nfreighters. I suppose in the long run it amounts to the same thing, \nthough.\" No one responded. \"Please raise headquarters and hand me the \ncommunicator.\" A crew member complied. Commander Bennett took the \ncommunicator. His message was terse but complete: pirates had attacked \nthe convoy and all seven freighters had been lost.\n\nTwelve minutes later the news came into Starlight Enterprise and was \ntranferred immediately to Richard Starlight, who was at work in his \noffice. He finished listening to the message, then turned and looked \nout over the stark moonscape. Slowly, he smiled.\n\n\n\nThe next day, just after noon, Richard was again in his office. Joining \nhim for lunch were John Rwakatare, Robert Nolan, Beowulf Denn, and \nCommander John Lewis and a few other visitors from Space Command. \nThough the food was delicious, the meal was a dismal affair. Long faces \nand few words expressed the atmosphere of the gathering.\n\nRichard, however, and Robert seemed not to share the gloom. Richard was \nan attentive host, carefully seeing to his guests' needs. \"A little \nmore water, John?\" he asked, offering the crystal decanter. \"Could you \nplease pass the biscuits, Robert? Thank you. Good, aren't they?\"\n\n\"Yes, Rick, they are, especially for biscuits made on the Moon,\" \nresponded the head of NME. \"Your chef is highly skilled.\"\n\nBeowulf Denn couldn't take it any more. \"You seem awfully lighthearted \nabout everything, Richard,\" he said in a tone that verged almost on \ndisrespect. Richard smiled but said nothing.\n\nWhen the lunch things had been cleared away, Richard spoke.\n\n\"Thank you for coming, gentlemen. I apologize for not sharing your \ndistress. Please forgive me for what must appear to be an appalling \nlack of empathy. When you learn why I have brought you here, you will \nforgive me, I think. I am expecting a message any moment now, and I \nwanted you to be here when it came in. It is coming from the commander \nof a large fleet of Starlight Enterprise ships.\" Richard glanced at \nRobert. The two friends shared a subtle smile.\n\n\"Encrypted message from Captain Marks-Owens, sir,\" came an artificial, \nmellow voice through the high-level communication system.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Richard. \"Transmit to my office.\"\n\nThe large screen on the wall behind Richard lit up. He turned his \nchair. The visage of a tall and slender woman appeared, with high \ncheekbones and honey-dark hair drawn back and held in place with a \nsmall circlet.\n\n\"Captain Mary Marks-Owens on the Starlight Enterprise ship Tempest, \nreporting on top security beam to Richard Starlight. Starlight fleet is \nin place. There were no incidents, and we are ready for your command, \nsir.\"\n\nRichard smiled widely and said clearly, \"Excellent work, Mary! Deploy \nthe probes immediately!\"\n\nBeowulf Denn choked. \"What is this?\" he burst out.\n\n\"Surprised, eh?\" said Richard jocularly, turning his chair back to the \ntable. \"Of course, she won't get the message for about ten minutes. But \nwhen she does, we'll be able to say, 'mission accomplished'!\"\n\n\"What is this?\" Commander Lewis echoed Beowulf Denn.\n\n\"It was Robert's idea, really,\" began Richard, \"and he ought to be \ntelling the tale, but he is too modest to do so. Robert and I cooked up \nthe plan between us and told no one else. Just in case there was a leak \nsomewhere-and apparently there was!-Robert made a fuss about wanting to \noffer his freighters to convey the probes to the deployment site. He \noffered rather expensive freighters for service. Robert felt badly \nabout, well, about making a scene when we met with the President and \nwanted to make up for it.\"\n\nRobert glanced down at the table so as not to meet anyone's eyes, but \nit was evident that the success of his plan was deeply gratifying to \nhim.\n\n\"The NME freighters were decoys. The real probes were sent out on SE \nfreighters to different spots along the face of deployment. They were \nsent out without any fanfare whatever on the normal delivery schedule \nwe follow for all shipments to Mars and the Asteroid Belt. It would \nnever have done, anyway, to send the probes out in a tight bunch as the \nseven NME freighters; deployment must be simultaneously effected from \nseveral sites, and this is the command I just gave Captain Marks-Owens.\n\n\"If the pirates took the bait, then they would go back to their base \nbelieving that they had stopped us. And if they didn't know about our \nplans or the decoy, well, no harm done. Deployment would still go on as \nscheduled. That's about two minutes from now.\"\n\nThe visitors were stunned. \"Why, that's terrific!\" stammered Commander \nLewis. \"No one else knew about this? Not even the President?\"\n\n\"No one,\" said Richard. \"Only Robert and I. And it's a good thing we \ndid it that way, too. Without the decoy, the launch would have gone as \nplanned with everyone knowing about it. As it is, we're safe now.\"\n\n\"Not only that-\" contributed John Rwakatare in his deep bass voice, \n\"we've learned something of immense value. There is a leak somewhere. \nSomeone informed the pirates of the launch from NME.\"\n\n\"Yes, there's that,\" said Robert Nolan with a sigh, finally speaking \nup. \"But for now, deployment of the probes will take place \nsuccessfully. We'll have to check for the leak, and I initiated a \ncareful search as soon as we received news of the attack.\"\n\nRichard turned back toward the screen. \"Computer,\" he said. \"Give me a \ntie-in to the master control aboard the Tempest.\" The screen showed a \nscene in space.\n\n\"There is a delay, of course, but the feed is continuous. Deployment of \nthe probes is taking place about now, but we won't see the results for \nabout ten minutes.\" Time passed.\n\n\"Coming up on the time now,\" announced Richard a little later, breaking \ninto the light conversation that was going on around the table. All \nheads turned toward the screen.\n\n\"This is a map of the expanse of the site of the deployment. This is \nnot the actual scene, of course; it is a computer enhancement, \nprogrammed to show us what is actually happening.\"\n\nFrom twelve sites at once, scattered about evenly throughout the area, \nsmall points began to glow. The points marked the locations of the SE \nfreighters that had carried the real probes. Simultaneously from every \npoint emerged a starburst of lines, each one a fine, golden strand of \nlight. \n\n\"Dr. Hoshino's design propels each probe at about one-twentieth the \nspeed of light. Complete deployment should take about an hour and a \nhalf.\"\n\nThe men waited nervously. Some browsed Richard's books and others \npeered through his small telescope at the moonscape. Occasionally two \nor three would come together for quiet discussion.\n\nOn the screen, the golden lines gradually lengthened. From time to time \none would burst into a flower of lines like summer fireworks, and then \nlater each of those lines extended and burst again.\n\nWhen deployment was complete, the entire screen was filled with a \ncomplex pattern of golden points, like dawn-illuminated mist hanging in \na huge spider's web.\n\n\"Success!\" said Richard quietly, but his voice trembled with \nexcitement. \"Captain Marks-Owens will now initiate the program that \nwill unify the probes into a single system. At the same time, she will \nenter a program that will allow the system to read the gravitational \nforces attendant upon every object within its range. The known \nasteroids and other heavenly bodies and the scheduled flights of \nspacecraft will be filtered out. What will be left will be the \npositions of unknown craft and any uncharted natural objects.\" As he \nspoke, the web began to shimmer in dozens of places, each the site of \nan object with enough mass to ripple the gravitational-detecting field \nof the net.\n\n\"Ah! Now the known ships are being filtered out,\" Richard observed as \nmany of the ripples disappeared. In a moment, he leaped to his feet.\n\n\"There it is! There it is!\" he shouted. He ran to the screen. \"Look! \nHere are the pirates' ships that attacked Robert's freighters \nyesterday!\" He pointed to a small ripple in the pattern and scanned the \nreadings at the bottom of the screen. \"Yes, eighteen ships. Here are \ntheir masses provided down here. And over here,\" his finger swept \nacross the screen to a large ripple in the upper center, \"is the \nasteroid coming our way!\n\n\"Computer! Extrapolate the course of this object\"-he gave the \nparticulars-\"and provide information on its trajectory.\"\n\nIn eight seconds the voice of the computer spoke. \"Object is a natural \nbody of approximately 20,625 trillion tons, currently traveling at a \nrate of approximately 280,000 miles per hour. If present speed and \ncourse are maintained, object will fly by the Earth. Closest approach \nwill be attained in 15 days, 8 hours, 3 minutes, 14 seconds at a \ndistance of approximately 10,689 miles.\"\n\nThere was silence in Richard's office for over a minute. Then someone \nsaid, \"It's going to miss.\"\n\n\n18: Collision Course!\n\nEXHAUSTED with relief, the party broke up. The men from Space Command \nleft the Starlight Enterprise plant and returned to their headquarters. \nRobert Nolan and Beowulf Denn lifted off from a launching deck not far \nfrom Richard's office and set course for the space station that was the \ncentral facility for Nolan Mining Enterprise.\n\nRichard had already given orders that ships from Starlight Enterprise \nbe assigned the immediate task of pursuing and capturing the eighteen \npirate ships that had destroyed NME's decoy freighters the day before. \nThe SE freighters that had actually carried the probes into space had \nbeen joined by SE ships gathered quietly from various sources during \nthe previous week. They had converged during the journey so that many \nwere in place throughout the area of the search, ready to respond to \nany orders that might come.\n\nInside many of them were the Firewasp fighters SE produced for use in \nthe Asteroid Belt. The Firewasps were small, tremendously fast and \namazingly maneuverable one-man ships that had been concentrated in \nseveral SE bases in the Asteroid Belt. They had been named after a \nmenacing insect found in certain hostile swamps on Mars. The tiny craft \nserved mostly as a deterrent, since smugglers and other lawless types \navoided any settlement that showed it was ready to defend itself \nagainst marauders.\n\nCommander John Lewis was to issue similar orders to Space Command ships \nin the vicinity of the microwave net. There were enough SE ships close \nto the course the pirate fleet was taking that Firewasps could be \nlaunched to intercept the pirate ships within an hour.\n\nJohn Rwakatare and Richard Starlight remained alone in Richard's \noffice. They were seated on a sofa, looking out over the vast lunar \nlandscape. An enormous dark gray field stretched out for several miles \nbefore breaking up at the far side into jumbled, light gray boulders.\n\n\"What do you make of it, Rock?\" asked Richard. \"Why did Zimbardo tell \nthe entire planet that he was going to pulverize it, and then set his \nprojectile on a fly-by course?\"\n\n\"I don't think he merely made a mistake,\" said Rock. \"He's shown he can \nguide asteroids to near-pinpoint accuracy.\"\n\n\"Hmm, yes...but those were much, much smaller and were aimed at much \ncloser targets. You don't think he could have just...aimed and missed?\"\n\n\"Possible, Rick, but I'm not convinced. Consider this: where did the \ncommunications from Zimbardo come from? An asteroid base. The Starmen \ntold us about this hollow asteroid and that it could be 'flown' like a \ngreat spaceship. We have seen only one large asteroid coming toward \nEarth. To be blunt, I think Lurton Zimbardo is a liar. The asteroid he \naimed at Earth is his own base! His threat to slam it into Earth was \nintended to cause panic-and it did! He achieved that without actually \nhaving to carry out his threat. I think the real threat is what is \ninside this hollow asteroid.\"\n\nRichard was listening intently. The relief he had previously felt was \nevaporating rapidly. He deeply admired and respected John Rwakatare. \nRock had a remarkable and rare combination of a filing-cabinet mind and \nan ability to dream. He was eminently logical at all times, but could \nalso come up with \"leaps beyond logic\" in which inspiration confidently \nanswered a challenging situation. Now was one of those times.\n\nRichard remembered when Rock had graduated from Starlight Academy \nfifteen years earlier. Richard was in his early forties at the time, \nand recalled the shock that went through the Starlight world when Rock \nwas offered the position of Starman but had turned it down. He was the \nonly person ever to have refused the honor. He had chosen instead to \nstay close to a young woman whom he loved; they had married and now had \nfour young children. Rock rarely left his family, and Richard had \nplaced him second in command of Starlight Enterprise.\n\nRock continued. \"We already concluded that the ability to sheath \nspacecraft and even asteroids comes from an alien intelligence more \nadvanced than our own race. I think it highly likely that the source-at \nleast the immediate source-of that knowledge is the asteroid Zimbardo \nhas taken over. We don't know what other capabilities this asteroid \nbase has. But we do know that Lurton Zimbardo is bringing it to \nEarth-very, very close to Earth, and that he will be here in fifteen \ndays.\"\n\nRichard swallowed hard and looked away. \"Oh my, Rock!-I'm sure you're \nright. In fact, what other possibilities are there?\"\n\n\"But unless he has defenses or weaponry we haven't seen yet, we have an \nadvantage. A slight advantage.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"He doesn't know that we know where he is or that we have guessed what \nhe's really doing.\"\n\n\n\nRobert Nolan and Beowulf Denn made the twenty-six minute journey from \nthe Moon to the space station. Robert had been full of chatter on the \nway back, but Wulf had responded only with short sentences, and after \nthey had docked they went their separate ways. Robert went to his \noffice to call the President. Richard had urged Robert to be the one to \ninform him that the probes had deployed successfully, that the \nmicrowave net had found the asteroid, and that Earth was not in danger \nof collision. Robert felt the honor deeply and was eager to announce \nthe good news.\n\nWulf found his way to his own private sanctum, saying he wanted to take \na nap. He set a \"do not disturb\" code on his communication system. Then \nhe prepared another audiodisk, making a brief report of the luncheon \nmeeting at Starlight Enterprise. He played it through twice, making \nchanges until he felt comfortable with the message. Then he speeded it \nup so that the complete message lasted 0.027 seconds, encrypted it, \ninserted the disk into his personal computer, and transmitted it. After \nthe message had been sent, he destroyed the disk and removed all signs \non his computer that the action had occurred.\n\nHe stared out the window at the third planet, a beautiful blue and \nwhite globe, thinking nothing in particular. After a moment he \nstretched out and tried to take a nap. But he couldn't sleep.\n\n\n\nA red light pulsed rapidly on the console near Lurton Zimbardo's chair. \nSeeing the flash from the corner of his eye, he jerked his head around \nand stared at it as if he couldn't believe that it was lit.\n\n\"What's this?\" he thought. \"There's no message due now.\" He pressed the \nbutton that deactivated the light, placed headphones on, dialed a few \nknobs on the console, and pressed \"Play.\"\n\nFifteen seconds later he leaped up from his chair and bellowed. With \nboth hands he jerked the headphone cord out of the control panel. The \nwires whipped through the air with a noise like a scourge. Zimbardo \ntwirled, his eyes bulging, and flung the headphones from him with all \nhis force. The set flew through the command center and collided with \nthe opposite wall. Everyone in the room froze and turned to look at the \npirate leader, and were appalled at what they saw. He was trembling \nwith demonic fury. No one moved or said a word. Even Gene was afraid to \nspeak.\n\n\"They found us!!\" Zimbardo shouted. \"They found us! The Earthmen know \nwhere we are! They've located the fleet!! The freighters those fools \ndestroyed yesterday were decoys! The Earthmen deployed the real probes \nand they've already found us! They outsmarted us!\" He cursed \nvehemently, then growled as if his teeth were grinding on gravel. \"But \nI've never been outsmarted! I won't be outsmarted now!\"\n\nZimbardo jumped back into his chair. \"Gene! GENE!!\" He screamed like a \nman possessed.\n\n\"Right here sir,\" said the young man, coming up quickly to the pirate \nleader's side.\n\n\"Crank up all the power this asteroid can give me! I'm going to create \nthe biggest electromagnetic pulse this Solar System has ever seen, and \nBURN every last one of those probes out of the void!! And then when we \nare invisible again, we'll move this asteroid to a new course and \ncontinue our plan.\"\n\n\"But sir,\" pleaded Gene, almost desperately. \"That would take a lot of \npower! It would be highly inefficient and might work against us! I \ndon't know the power capacity of the asteroid! It could very well burn \nus out!\"\n\nZimbardo stopped moving for a moment, then turned his head very slowly \naround and stared at Gene. His eyes glinted with an unearthly light.\n\n\"Do it,\" he hissed.\n\nGene stepped back half a pace, then pivoted swiftly and ran to the \npower breakers on the far side of the room. He began to pull switches, \noverride safety indicators, and turn power dials to maximum output.\n\nIn a little less than three minutes, he turned and looked back at \nZimbardo. The pirate leader had not taken his eyes off of his assistant \nfor a second. With his mouth slightly open, Gene looked into Zimbardo's \neyes from across the room and nodded with a quick jerk of his head. \nZimbardo smiled, inclined his head slowly, and turned back to his \nconsole. He laughed out loud and pressed the switch that activated a \ngeneral direction EMP.\n\nThere was a deafening sound like that of a huge metal block falling to \nthe floor and then grinding along an uneven surface. A wailing screech \nfilled the room and everyone but Zimbardo covered his ears. The screech \nincreased in intensity until men fell to the floor and writhed, \npressing their hands firmly to the sides of their heads. Then there was \nsudden silence and the lights went out. Men began to moan, and \nsomeone's voice quavered: \"The atmosphere recycler has stopped!\"\n\n\"Everything has stopped,\" said Gene from the darkness.\n\n\n\nTwelve Firewasps came upon the eighteen pirate ships with a suddenness \nthat took the pirates completely by surprise. The small spacecraft \nmoved so quickly that the pirates could get off only wild shots that \nnever came close to any of the SE craft. The Firewasps used narrow but \nhighly dense laser weaponlight with remarkable effectiveness. Skilled \npilots and marksmen quickly disabled the pirate ships by piercing their \npower supply, effectively casting them adrift in space. The pirates' \nsheathing systems went down, rendering the ships visible. \n\nThe battle was over in less than two minutes. Captain Mary Marks-Owens \nand Richard Starlight received the news within minutes of each other, \nthat the eighteen pirate ships were derelicts and their crews would no \ndoubt be eager to be picked up by the nearest Space Command ships. \nWithout power, their air would not last more than twenty-four hours.\n\nRichard and Commander Lewis made the next order jointly. With a few \nexceptions, all Starlight Enterprise and Space Command spacecraft were \nto journey to the pirates' asteroid at once and prepare for battle. \nThey would bring the attack directly to Lurton Zimbardo.\n\nAfter issuing the order, Richard reset his communication system to \ncontact the Star Ranger. Now that the need for secrecy was past, he \nwanted to bring the returning Starmen up to date and urge them to come \nto the pirates' asteroid with the others.\n\nInside the Star Ranger, Mark cried out, \"Hey! Listen to this!\" He \ndirected the communication system to public announcement mode and \nrestarted the message from Richard Starlight. In exultant tones, \nRichard related the events of the previous two days, concluding with \nthe capture of the eighteen pirate ships and the coming attack on \nZimbardo's asteroid.\n\nThe Starmen cheered. They all jumped up and danced. After a moment, Zip \nasked, \"How soon can we get to the asteroid, Mark?\"\n\nMark sat down and quickly figured. \"We're only about a day and a half \naway.\"\n\n\"What are we waiting for?!\" exclaimed Joe.\n\n\"Let's go!\" said Zip. \"We could use a little diversion on our way back \nto Earth.\"\n\nMark set a new course and Joe initiated it. The Star Ranger turned \nslightly to intercept the asteroid where they had been imprisoned \nnearly three weeks before.\n\n\n\nAs the power system aboard that same asteroid screeched into disruption \nand then silence, a massive electromagnetic shock wave was dispensed \nfrom its surface. A great pulse of destruction moved through space at \nthe speed of light. Although it was not strong enough to harm \nspacecraft, the microwave probes were no match for its power. As the \npulse swept past the probes, they winked out in flashes of golden light.\n\nOn the master screen aboard the Tempest and in Richard Starlight's \noffice, viewers watched the golden net disappear. Although it was past \nmidnight, Richard and John Rwakatare were wide awake with their eyes \nglued to the screen. From the center where the asteroid was indicated, \nan expanding circle of darkness went forth, gradually swallowing up all \nthe probes. It was obvious to Richard that the microwave net was doomed.\n\n\"Computer,\" he said in a dull voice. \"How much longer until the net \ndisappears?\"\n\n\"Four minutes, twelve seconds,\" came the mellow voice.\n\n\"The eighteen ships are adrift,\" Richard said. \"We can't lose them. But \nif this asteroid is maneuverable, as it must be, Zimbardo can speed up, \nslow down, or change course and avoid our attack. He can disappear.\"\n\nRichard's body tensed and he raised his voice. \"How did he know about \nthe probes?!\" he exclaimed, with exasperation.\n\n\"The spy,\" responded John Rwakatare.\n\n\n\nAboard the pirates' asteroid, power was returning. An emergency backup \nsystem had kicked in, causing the lights to flicker back on and the \natmosphere recycler to hum quietly back into efficiency. With covert \nglances back at Zimbardo, the men returned to their stations.\n\nZimbardo barked out a command.\n\n\"Status report!\"\n\n\"Right away, sir,\" said Gene, taking his own seat. He attended to \nvarious dials and incoming signals.\n\nZimbardo stood up and walked over to the great window that overlooked \nthe huge rocket pad outside. There were seven ships left-six belonging \nto the independent smugglers, Jeff Jenner, Lorry, and Captain Kimball, \nand his own personal ship, the Tartarus. Even the Silver Spear had been \ntaken by Lorry. The asteroid was nearly empty of men; only his support \ncrew, the smugglers and their crews, and a few others remained.\n\n\"Sir,\" spoke up Gene. His voice trembled. He spoke as one apologizing. \n\"Mr. Zimbardo. Mr. Lather sent in a frantic message that all eighteen \nships were under attack. The transmission was cut off in mid-sentence. \nI scanned their location, sir, and detected three large Space Command \nships approaching our convoy. They are about to be captured, sir.\"\n\nZimbardo turned slowly and looked at Gene without a change in \nexpression. \"And?\" he said. \"There's more, I can tell. And...\"\n\n\"And there is a large fleet of ships belonging to Space Command and \nStarlight Enterprise converging on our location. In less than three \nhours, fourteen ships will be arriving within minutes of each other. \nApproximately the same number again will join them over the next \ntwenty-four hour period.\" Gene hesitated, then decided to deliver the \nlast sentence. \"Even if we are sheathed, sir, with that many ships so \nclose, they will be able to find us before long.\"\n\nLurton Zimbardo turned his eyes obliquely to the floor and joined his \nhands behind his back. He rocked for a moment on his feet, almost as if \npondering a challenging philosophical question.\n\n\"I see,\" he said at last. He walked quietly over to his console, sat \nfor a moment without moving, then began to move dials and enter numbers \ninto the navigational program. He consulted various tables of \ninformation and referred to a number of measuring devices whose \nsensitive detectors were on the surface of the asteroid.\n\nMinutes passed. Zimbardo grew increasingly agitated as he worked. His \nmen had stopped their own work and watched him. Where his hands had \nbegun to move gently and carefully, they began to exhibit higher and \nhigher degrees of animation. Soon he was pressing his keyboard \nvehemently and muttering under his breath. Once in a while he chortled.\n\nFinally he shouted, \"Hah! That will do it! I won't be outsmarted!\" He \npressed the \"Enter\" button and then roared, \"Yes! I win!\" He leaped \nfrom his chair and lifted up both arms. \"I win!\" he screamed.\n\nAs the program Zimbardo had activated was engaged, the power it \nrequired began draining the emergency resources of the asteroid. The \nlights dimmed and the usual hum of the atmosphere recycler began to \nstutter.\n\n\"What did you do?\" Gene asked with trepidation. \"Even the backup power \nsystem is being strained.\"\n\n\"Just keeping a promise,\" said Zimbardo jovially. \"I told Earth I had \nsent them an asteroid. I wasn't very truthful at the time, I'm afraid. \nBut now I have kept my promise. I have redirected the asteroid so that \nit will collide with the planet! -and I've pushed the acceleration up \nto full!\"\n\nA soul-wrenching moan escaped from Gene's lips. He stumbled over to his \nchair and collapsed into it. He stared ahead, seeing nothing. The other \nmen were frozen in their places.\n\nZimbardo strolled over to the wall-screen that provided a map of the \nInner Planetary system and indicated their position. With the power \ndrain, the images were going in and out of focus and numbers were \nfading from the screen.\n\n\"Hmm. About ten days to impact,\" he muttered. \"Can't tell for sure with \nthe images fading like this, but no matter. By that time we'll be long \ngone.\"\n\n A few minutes later the insides of the complex began to screech as \nthey had before. The screech did not rise in intensity but gradually \nturned into a groan. The light slowly faded and then went out \ncompletely.\n\n \"The power is out for good now!\" Gene wailed. \"and we're prisoners on \nthe asteroid! Now it's a runaway! We can't stop it!\"\n\n\"Why would we want to stop it? We'll take the Tartarus and leave to \nfight again another day! Pack up, get the men, and let's go. We've got \nless than three hours, I think you said.\"\n\nPanicked, Gene fled from the room, feeling his way desperately through \nthe darkness. \"I've got to warn Kimball, Lorry, and Jenner! We've got \nto escape!\" Fear unlike anything he had ever experienced or imagined \nfilled his entire being.\n\n\n19: Change of Guard\n\nGENE FLEW down the corridor with his arms outstretched, not knowing \nexactly where he was going and not caring, as long as it was away from \nthe control deck. He was breathing hard and fast, on the verge of \nhysteria. Realizing that he was in danger of losing his grip, he paused \nto catch his breath, and leaned against the wall.\n\n A moment later he saw moving lights in the stairwell a long way ahead. \nIn the growing gray illumination, he dashed forward and saw Kimball, \nLorry, and Jenner coming up, carrying flashlights. When Kimball saw \nGene hurrying toward him, he flashed the light directly into his eyes \nand roared, \"What in blazes is going on in this place?\"\n\nGene threw his hands up over his eyes, but continued to stumble \nforward. \"You've got to get out of here,\" he choked out. \"Get your men, \nget your ships, go!\"\n\nJenner put a firm hand on Gene's shoulder, and Kimball lowered the \nlight. \"What's going on? Where's Zimbardo?\" Jenner's voice was a little \nquieter than Kimball's but just as demanding.\n\nGene gulped and looked up. \"He-, he's aimed the asteroid at Earth! It's \non a collision course! He burned out all the power-all the power! He \ncan't stop it! He doesn't want to stop it!\"\n\nThere was a stunned silence. Jenner, his mouth opening and closing like \na fish out of water, finally blurted out, \"Why did he do that?\"\n\n\"All the men in the fleets have been captured! We're the only ones \nleft, and Space Command will be boarding us in less than three hours!\"\n\nThe three smugglers gasped in dismay. Jenner pushed Gene away and the \nthree of them shot back down the stairwell. When they reached the lower \nlevel, Gene heard them shouting for their men. The light gradually \ndiminished until Gene was once again in complete darkness.\n\n\"Gene! Gene! Where are you?\" came the voice of Lurton Zimbardo from far \nbehind him. Startled, Gene quickly whirled and peered into the \ndarkness. From far away came a sound as of scurrying feet. There were \nmen coming-the men from the control center, with Zimbardo. Gene spun \nagain and ran for his own room. He had decided what he was going to do. \nFrantically he rummaged through his belongings until he found his own \nflashlight. Without turning it on yet, he ran from the room and \nhastened farther away from the control center.\n\n\"Gene? Gene! Is that you?\" came the voice of Lurton Zimbardo. Gene \ninhaled quickly and looked back. There was still no light. He hesitated \nfor a moment, then answered,\n\n\"Yes, it's me.\" His voice was squeaky.\n\n\"Where are you?\" echoed down the corridor.\n\n\"I'm not going with you! Go on without me!\"\n\n\"What?\" Zimbardo's voice had a note of complete incredulity in it. \"Why \nnot? Hurry up, Gene! We have to go! I don't want Space Command on my \ntail!\"\n\n\"I'm not going!\" Gene shouted. He turned and fled. He sped down the \ncorridor as fast as he could go, came to its end, turned the corner, \nand kept going. In less than a minute he was many turns and twists away \nfrom the main level. He switched on his light, put it on its lowest \nsetting, and slowed down to a walk. \"He won't wait for me! He won't \nlook for me! He'll want to go! Soon he'll be gone and I'll be safe!\" \nThese thoughts came through Gene's mind almost like a flow of clear \nwater.\n\nHe came to a storeroom, pushed the door open, and flashed his light \naround. The room was crammed with stacks of boxes and various other \nitems. Seeing there was no one else inside, he shut the door, crawled \nunder a cabinet, and turned off his light.\n\nAfter a short while, he felt the floor tremble slightly. He knew that a \nspaceship had lifted off. It was followed quickly by five others. \"The \nsmugglers are gone,\" he thought. \"Just one more now. If I hear one \nmore, I'll know that he's gone.\" He waited, desperately hoping he \nwouldn't hear the sound of the door opening.\n\n\n\nAfter they left Gene, the smugglers Kimball, Lorry, and Jenner quickly \ngathered together their men and supplies and headed for the airlock to \nthe launching pad. There were thirty-seven men altogether. All had \ntheir spacesuits on and most of them carried lights.\n\n\"How are we going to get out of here?\" asked one of the men as they \napproached the airlock. \"The airlock won't open. Nothing's working.\"\n\n\"Portable power pack,\" said Kimball. He took a small box from another \nman, set it down by the airlock, and in seconds had established a \nmakeshift connection. The airlock opened. In that fashion, the men \nboarded their ships without delay.\n\nKimball lifted off first and entered the vast, stone tunnel that led to \nthe outside. As soon as the enormous airlock became visible down the \nshaft, he fired a laser cannon at it. Unable to resist an attack from \nwithin, the great door, thousands of years old, shattered into \nfragments. The atmosphere of the launching pad rushed out, hurling the \nshards of the airlock door into space. Kimball's ship then came through \nthe tunnel and exited, followed in short order by the five other ships. \nThey set a course for the Asteroid Belt and at top acceleration left \nthe pirates' asteroid behind them.\n\n\n\nAfter Gene had fled out of earshot, Zimbardo turned to the few men who \nwere behind him. \"I'm lifting off in the Tartarus in ten minutes. It's \nthe only ship left on the asteroid. Meet me at the great doors. Tell \neveryone else you see.\" He swiveled and walked to the stairwell to go \nup to his own rooms. \n\nNone of the men said anything to each other, but scattered, each going \nto his own quarters.\n\nTen minutes later, arrayed in his spacesuit and carrying a few items, \nLurton Zimbardo stood at the great doors. Behind him was the asteroid \ncomplex. In front was the manufacturing center and beyond that was the \nlaunching pad where the Tartarus stood in solitary splendor. Only five \nmen had joined the pirate leader.\n\n\"So,\" said Zimbardo. \"Only five of you. Five men left. Who are you?\" He \nlifted his light a little so he could see their faces. \"Ah, Mr. \nGebbeth. I said before that I knew I could depend on you. I've always \nknown it. You are the pilot. And Mr. Slant. Mr. Stagnum. Mr. Withers. \nAnd Mr. Poppy. No one else. Well, then, there are six of us altogether. \nLet us go.\"\n\nThere was almost no talking. Each man seemed to know what to do without \nbeing told. They opened the airlocks to pass through the manufacturing \ncenter, and then into the airless launching pad. Without haste but \nwithout unnecessary delay, they entered the Tartarus, a gleaming silver \nand red ship that could support a crew of eighteen.\n\nThe six men strapped themselves into acceleration couches with Gebbeth \nin the pilot's position. \"Take us out, Mr. Gebbeth,\" said Zimbardo. \"I \nwill tell you where to go when we are free.\"\n\n\"Yes sir,\" said Gebbeth, and initiated the launching sequence. In a \nshort time, Lurton Zimbardo's spacecraft had left the asteroid.\n\n\"Top speed, Mr. Gebbeth,\" said Zimbardo. \"Make sure the sheathing \nequipment is functioning. Head away from the sun.\"\n\n\"Of course, sir.\"\n\n\n\nWhen Zimbardo burned out the asteroid's power, much of the energy \nneeded to power its sheathing apparatus disappeared. The sheathing \nplates then only received power through the solar energy panels, and \nthey did not provide enough energy to hide the asteroid completely. It \nappeared on radar as a faint blip, allowing the Earth ships to locate \nit without difficulty. About two hours after Zimbardo's departure, the \nfleet command ship Tempest came upon the asteroid. It was the first of \nfourteen ships from both Space Command and Starlight Enterprise that \nwere expected to arrive within the hour.\n\nThe Tempest maneuvered carefully through the gaping orifice left when \nKimball's ship had blown the massive airlock, and set down inside the \nairless docking arena of the asteroid. Captain Mary Marks-Owens \ndescended the ladder first, followed by several members of the crew. \nAll were armed. Only the lights of the spaceship lit up the cavernous \nhall of shadows.\n\n\"Eerie,\" observed Captain Marks-Owens as she set foot on the pavement. \n\"Follow me. We'll see if the place is as abandoned as it looks.\" Nine \nspace-suited figures fell in behind her as she approached the airlock \ninto the manufacturing area. When she was unable to open it, she called \nfor a portable power supply. Two additional men brought one from the \nship, opened the airlock, and allowed the landing party to enter the \ncomplex. Once inside, the members of the crew were able to dispense \nwith their helmets.\n\nSlowly and carefully they made their way through the blackness, pushing \nit back with the radiance of the lights they carried. They were in awe \nof the huge, obviously alien place.\n\n\"The place feels almost haunted,\" observed one man in a quiet voice.\n\n\"Somewhat,\" agreed the Captain, \"but there's more to it than that. \nThere's something deeper. I don't think this is an evil place. It is a \nplace that needs to be cleansed.\"\n\nThe party passed through the great doors. Before they had crossed the \ncourtyard a man emerged from the far side, carrying a light. The \nmembers of the landing party quickly spread out, and the Captain \nordered, \"Halt!\"\n\n\"Don't shoot!\" came the voice from behind the tiny light across the \nroom. \"I'm unarmed. I've been waiting for you.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"My name is Gene Newman. I was the control officer for Lurton Zimbardo. \nHe's gone.\"\n\n\"Come forward slowly, hands up.\" Gene walked forward cautiously with \nhis hands extended over his head, holding his light in one hand. When \nhe was a few yards away, Captain Marks-Owens ordered him to stop and \ndirected two men to search him. When it was definite that he was \nunarmed, she called him to approach her.\n\n\"What's been going on here?\" she asked.\n\nGene explained that Zimbardo had aimed the asteroid at Earth, burned \nout the power system, and fled two hours earlier. The Captain's face \npaled as he told the story.\n\n\"Radio the ships that are still en route and have them check the course \nof this rock,\" she ordered one of the men, who put on his helmet and \ncontacted the ship. \"And tell Mr. Madera to come here at once.\" The \norder was given.\n\nWhile they were waiting for Mr. Madera, Captain Marks-Owens quizzed \nGene further. \"Why did you stay behind?\"\n\n\"I-, I joined Putnam's organization because it seemed a sure thing. He \nwas captured, but Zimbardo took over and made it seem an even better \nproposition. But I could see him getting crazier and crazier! I'm not \nashamed to say that he began to frighten me-and he frightened others, \ntoo! And when he aimed the asteroid toward Earth...\" Gene's eyes \nwidened and he began to tremble, \"I knew there was something seriously \nwrong with him! I had to get away! I wanted to fix things-if I could!\"\n\n\"Are there any others here?\"\n\n\"I don't know. There may be. I haven't seen anyone else. Apart from \nZimbardo and the smugglers, there were seventeen men left on the \nasteroid. I don't know how many went with him. There were also some \nprisoners-three Starmen and some asteroid miners, but they escaped from \nthe room where they were being held and disappeared into the depths of \nthe asteroid. I don't know where they are now. We never saw a trace of \nthem after that.\"\n\n\"They escaped from the asteroid three weeks ago. In fact, we expect \nthem to arrive here soon in their own ship.\"\n\nGene's face showed out-and-out surprise at this news. \"They escaped? \nThey got off the asteroid? How did they do that?\"\n\nAt this point, they were joined by the young man for whom the Captain \nhad asked. He was about thirty years old, with a full crown of thick \nbrown hair and deep brown eyes. This was Jesus Madera-Cruz, Chief \nIoneer for Starlight Enterprise. He was adept with engines and \nmicro-electronics. Noted for a placid nature, nothing ever seemed to \nbother him, and his expertise in power systems had never failed the \ntrust which Richard Starlight had placed in him.\n\n\"You asked for me, Captain?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Madera. We need your skills urgently. This is Gene, one of \nZimbardo's men. Zimbardo has been gone for two hours. Gene tells us \nthat before he fled he burned out the power. Before the power went out, \nhe also redirected the asteroid on a collision course with Earth. I've \nasked our ships outside to confirm that. In the meantime, I'd like you \nto check out the power system and see if you can bring it back up. \nObviously, if what Gene says is true, this is a matter of extreme \nurgency, not just convenience.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" answered the man with a brief nod. The Captain detailed \nseveral men to go with Gene and Madera to wherever Zimbardo's former \nchief control officer wanted to take them. Gene took them first to the \ncontrol deck.\n\nCaptain Marks-Owens detailed the rest of her men to search the complex \nin pairs. As other ships landed, minutes apart from each other, she \ndirected their crews to the search. After an hour, ten other pirates \nhad been located. All had been eager to turn themselves in. They were \ntaken into captivity and led to one of the Space Command ships where \nthey were fed and kept under guard.\n\nSoon there were over a hundred men searching the facility. Operations \nofficers began connecting portable power systems to various parts of \nthe complex to reestablish the lights and get the airlocks working \nagain. The atmosphere recycling system was not yet accessible, but the \nair would last for a long time.\n\nAn ensign brought a report to Captain Marks-Owens during the search, \nconfirming Gene's account that the asteroid was on a collision course \nwith Earth.\n\n\"Details?\" asked the Captain.\n\n\"The asteroid will collide with Earth in approximately eight days, at a \nspeed of nearly 300,000 miles per hour,\" responded the ensign. \"It was \nvastly accelerated for a few minutes before the power burned out, and \nthe sun's gravity continues to increase the rate of acceleration. We \nhave not yet determined precisely where it will strike, but we are \nforwarding the data to SE and that will be determined.\"\n\nAt that point, Gene and Madera came up to Marks-Owens.\n\n\"Captain,\" said Madera. \"I have made a preliminary examination of the \ncontrol system. Gene has been more than cooperative, I am happy to say. \nWith his help, just by looking at the controls and hearing him describe \nwhat Zimbardo did, I can conjecture what kind of power we're dealing \nwith. If we can get the power back on, we should not have any \ndifficulty in changing the course of the asteroid. Restoring the power, \nhowever, will not be easy. Gene has never been to the power plant. In \nfact, it seems that no one has, even including Zimbardo. No one knows \nwhere it is or how to learn its location.\"\n\n\"Go back to the Tempest and contact George St. George and the Starmen. \nSt. George is on Ceres and the Starmen are in the Star Ranger on their \nway here. These men have been inside the power plant and know how to \nfind it.\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am.\" Madera bowed his head slightly and turned toward the \nairlock that led out to the launching pad. He showed no signs whatever \nof being ruffled. In sharp contrast, Gene was visibly anxious.\n\n\"Gene,\" said Captain Marks-Owens; \"you've apparently been eager to \ncooperate. Mr. Madera is easy to get along with but hard to please. If \nhe commends you, I am satisfied that you are not a threat to us. You go \non to the Tempest also and get some food and some rest, as you need. We \ncan't do more until we hear from the Starmen or St. George. We'll want \nyou later, and you'll need to be rested.\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am,\" said the distraught man. He turned toward the SE flagship, \nswallowed hard, and stepped toward the airlock. He ran to catch up to \nMadera.\n\nCaptain Marks-Owens watched them for a moment, then turned her \nattention back to the activity of the men who were supplying the \ntemporary power to the complex before her. The grandeur of the view \nimpressed her.\n\n\"This place that seemed so menacing when we first landed is beginning \nto look a little less threatening now,\" she thought. \"Hard to believe \nwe are aboard a runaway asteroid that will destroy Earth in eight days, \nunless we can turn it aside somehow.\"\n\n\n20: Desperation\n\nTHE STAR RANGER sped through space toward its rendezvous point with the \nracing asteroid. Given the urgency of the situation, Zip had ordered \nthe maximum acceleration that their bodies could tolerate. Mark had \nprogrammed their course to bring them as quickly as possible up to \nboarding speed with the asteroid. Having done that, he pored through \nthe printed material he had taken from the asteroid's power plant. He \nfelt hopelessness creeping over him since he didn't know what Zimbardo \nhad done to burn it out.\n\nZip came over and stood near where Mark was seated with a dim lamp \nilluminating the papers in front of him. The lamp was designed to burn \nwith a soft light tinged with the faintest trace of light green, to be \neasiest on the eyes. It was devised for periods of long study.\n\n\"Anything yet, Mark?\" Zip asked, knowing that the question was \npointless. If Mark had found even a tiny piece of information which \ncould be remotely connected to the situation on the asteroid, he would \nhave spoken up.\n\n\"No, Zip,\" replied Mark. \"I can follow the diagrams pretty well now, \nand I think I understand how one part connects to another, but I can't \nenvision how any part of it could have burned out. I've tried to \ncalculate how much power Zimbardo would have needed to generate the EMP \nof the size he did, but I can only guess at it. Even at my highest \nestimates, I can't see how it would burn out the power supplies of a \nhuge iron asteroid that can be used as a spacecraft. All I can imagine \nis that much of the power supply of the asteroid had been shut down \nbefore.\"\n\n\"You mean that its reserves were not in place?\"\n\n\"Something like that. We have guessed that the asteroid was a huge \nspacecraft. We also know that it had been stationary and abandoned-or \nat least unused-for eons. I suspect that the asteroid's full power had \nnever been accessible to Zimbardo. He was able to operate life-support \nsystems, lights, airlocks, and so forth in his own section without \ndrawing much power. When he tried to 'power up' the asteroid and move \nit out of orbit, he reached the limit of its available power. Then he \nsuddenly initiated the electromagnetic pulse to fry the microwave \nprobes, but he also fried his own system. But the asteroid must have \nmore power than that to be able to do what it must have done in the \npast. You saw the power plant as well as I did! Did it look to you as \nif Zimbardo could have burned that whole thing out with one EMP, no \nmatter how intense?\"\n\n\"Makes sense, Mark. Where, then, is the rest of the power?\"\n\nMark looked up at Zip with a wan smile. \"If you want to find it, you \ncan help me look through these papers, if you want.\"\n\n\"All right, I will,\" said Zip, and sat down. Mark handed him a stack of \npaper, showed Zip what to look for, and went back to his own study.\n\nJoe remained on the flight deck, keeping careful watch on the \ninstruments. He preserved the Star Ranger's course precisely so that \nthere would be no unnecessary delay in meeting the runaway asteroid. \nBefore him was a scattering of white stars in the blackness. A few \nlarge ones stood out.\n\n\"Mark would love this,\" Joe thought, but he didn't bother his friend.\n\n\n\nThe best minds of Starlight Enterprise and Space Command had been \nworking for more than twenty-four hours on the problem of diverting the \nrunaway asteroid, and had not even been able to restore power. \nTwenty-five ships had docked inside the landing area, and more than 300 \nmen were inside the facility. Some had been detailed to explore and \ntake an inventory of what was found, others had been ordered to provide \ntemporary light and power using portable equipment from the ships, and \nstill others worked under Jesus Madera-Cruz in the desperate attempt to \nrestore power to the asteroid.\n\nFrom the communications center aboard the Tempest, Mr. Madera had been \nin contact with SE's best engineers and the Starmen. SE's best hope was \nin the Starmen since they had been aboard the asteroid and had walked \nthrough its power plant. By electronic communication, Mark had been \nable to provide some of the plans for the power plant to Mr. Madera, \nbut the plant was simply too large and too complex for the plans to be \nof much use.\n\nGeorge St. George had given Madera the proper combination of buttons in \nthe elevators to give him access to the warehouse, but even after the \nportable units had restored power to the elevators they could not \ndeliver men to the warehouse. The elevators would not descend beyond a \ncertain level since Zip had previously destroyed all the panels when \nthe pirates were pursuing them. Consequently, Madera had had to detail \nmen to descend manually through the shaft to the warehouse floor and \nrepair the controls at the warehouse level for one elevator. That had \ntaken nearly eleven hours.\n\nExcept for one brief nap, Madera had not slept since the Tempest had \nlanded. Once the elevator had been repaired, he went with about thirty \nmen through the same passages that the Starmen had traversed. Since the \ntemporary lighting and power had been set up only in the facility that \nthe pirates had been using, Madera and his companions walked in \ndarkness as deep as the inside of a cave.\n\nMadera hefted a huge but lightweight lamp for use in the power plant. \nTo illumine their way through the warehouse and corridors, others \ncarried personal flashlights. As they made their way through the \nfacility, the lights they carried cleaved the darkness. But behind \nthem, the absolute darkness closed up again.\n\nAfter leaving the warehouse, Madera had to use the codes the Starmen \nhad provided to come to the immense power plant. Although the men had \nbeen told in advance what to expect, when the doors of the elevator \nopened, they were just as awed as the Starmen and miners had been when \nthey first beheld the scene.\n\nThough the power plant was completely dark and silent, there was a \nfeeling among the men at the elevator door that they were at the edge \nof vastness. Madera activated his lamp and shone it into the iron \ncavern. Its light penetrated about half a mile; in its cone the \nlatticework, panels, and tubing were revealed. When Madera saw the \nextent of the plant, he smiled with deep appreciation, then encouraged \nthe men to get to work.\n\nHe assigned them to three groups. They were to spread throughout the \nplant and search for evidence of any burnout or other damage. The men \nwent forth with lights, tools, and electronic equipment. Madera himself \nset out to study one of the power stations and try to learn its secrets \nby personal examination.\n\n\n\nAt one end of the asteroid was the huge landing facility that Troy \nPutnam had taken over. About two-thirds of the length of the asteroid \naway was the port through which the Starmen and miners had escaped. \nBetween was an enormous complex of habitable space. At the lowest level \nwas the power plant. Above the power plant was an immense compound, \nsecure from any chance encounter by Earthmen. Access could be given \nonly from inside, and no Earthman would be able to enter by force, \nshort of taking the entire asteroid apart. Indeed, no Earthman even \nsuspected it existed.\n\nInside this compound, several tall, slender, humanoid figures were \nworking frantically at a panel. Endless banks of dials, screens, \nswitches, and other electronic paraphernalia were set out in the huge \nroom where they worked. The room was dark. Several portable lights had \nbeen set in a semi-circle around the panel where the figures were \nworking.\n\nConversation was minimal and quiet, barely above a murmur. Tools were \nrequested and exchanged. A light was brought over and placed so as to \nreveal the inner workings of a cabinet filled with circuits and \nconnections.\n\nOne figure walked slowly to the far end of the room, carrying a small \nlight. He passed through a doorway, traversed a short corridor, and \nentered an enormous chamber. He paced along a catwalk. The power in \nthis room was operative. Far above him was an indigo sky with silver \nstars. A pale blue dawn was showing at the horizon. To his left was an \nextensive mirror-smooth lake in which the sky and stars were reflected \nin unutterable beauty. In the lake, trees grew in profusion. It \nappeared to be an orchard in flood time, but it was apparent that the \ntrees grew best in a watery environment. Heavy, thick, almost circular \nleaves covered the trees. Fragrant white blossoms promised fruit in the \nnext season. On the shore were numerous small boats for skimming and a \nfew large ones for working in the orchard.\n\nThe catwalk led for about a mile across one end of the lake and had \nseveral side passages, all on the right. At the fourth side passage, \nthe walker turned and passed through an airlock. After he had come \nthrough the second door, he entered a lightless room that gave an \nimpression of immense spaciousness. Revealed in the shadow of his light \nwere many horizontal gold and clear quartz capsules about eight feet \nlong and two feet in diameter, stacked in rows. Each capsule was \nconnected to cables that led into a large box. Boxes were spaced about \ntwenty feet apart and each was connected to about forty capsules.\n\nThe walker opened the top of the box and peered inside. He raised a \nsmall communicator to his lips and spoke into it. After receiving a \nreply, he reached into the box with a long tool. A moment later, dim \nlights went on in the room and a very low hum started up. The walker \nsmiled broadly and closed the box. Then he retraced his steps.\n\n\n\nCaptain Mary Marks-Owens woke Jesus Madera out of a deep sleep.\n\n\"Mr. Madera,\" she said, approaching him gently where he had fallen \nasleep in his chair. He had returned to his office and workshop aboard \nthe Tempest to study some diagrams he had made in the power plant. \"The \nStar Ranger has arrived. The Starmen are waiting for you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Captain,\" said Madera, lifting his head and rubbing his \nbrown eyes. He ran his hand through his hair quickly, left his room, \nput on his helmet, and descended the outside ladder to the floor of the \nlaunching pad. He turned toward the control center and saw the Starmen \non the other side of the wall. They all waved at him. Madera was one of \nthe Starmen's favorite acquaintances from Starlight Enterprise. He \nstrode across the tarmac and passed through the airlock and hailed the \nyoung men.\n\nAfter he had removed his helmet and exchanged hasty preliminary \ngreetings, he led them across the quad in front of the manufacturing \ncenter and through the great doors.\n\n\"What have you discovered?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"I think I can power up the computer system, but it will take a lot of \nenergy to do so. I used submicroscopic robotic probes to provide \ndetailed maps of the computer in the power plant, and some of the \nwiring, machines, and selected other equipment inside this amazing \nfacility. I've detailed men to take portable power packs down to the \npower plant and arrange them in sequence to give us enough power to \njump-start the computer. When we do that, we ought to be able to get \ninto the files you found earlier, Mark. Getting the power packs down \nthere is not easy, but with dozens of men working, I estimated that we \ncould get it hooked up in a couple of hours. That was the time I was \ntaking to study some diagrams I'd made, but instead took an involuntary \ncatnap.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you enter the power plant through the hangar from which we \nescaped?\" asked Zip.\n\n\"We looked for the opening in the place you'd indicated, but found no \nevidence of any kind that there was an airlock. We even tried locating \nit with radar, but the entrance is concealed so effectively that we \ncould find no trace of it. We needed the personnel at this end, so we \nabandoned the search. Getting to the power plant through the complex \nhere is the long way around, but we knew that we could do it and just \ncouldn't take the time to look further on the surface for the shortest \nmeans of ingress.\"\n\n\"We'll have to find some way to open the airlock from the outside when \nwe're not so rushed,\" responded Zip. \"We haven't kept up with the time \nlimit. What've we got?\"\n\nMadera sighed. \"If we can't move the asteroid, impact with Earth will \ntake place on Thursday, September 8, at 2:33 p.m. That's about six days \nfrom now. It will strike in the Atlantic Ocean just north of the West \nIndies.\"\n\n\"How much time have we got to turn it aside?\"\n\n\"Just a coupla days. After that time, no matter what we do the asteroid \nwill still strike the Earth somewhere. But we'll be able to move it.\"\n\n\"You sound confident, Mr. Madera,\" said Joe turning his head briefly as \nthe four of them approached the elevators.\n\n\"Don't worry, Joe,\" said Madera. \"Earth is not ready yet for its \nJudgment Day.\"\n\nSomehow the Starmen believed him. He was not a Starman nor a reputed \nscientist, but he was a man of deep dignity who exuded confidence and \neasily won the affections of the people around him.\n\nMoments later, they were at the site of the activity. The last portable \npower pack had been set up and connected to the closest console in the \npower plant.\n\n\"Set?\" asked Madera of the technician who had overseen the procedure.\n\n\"Yes sir, Mr. Madera.\"\n\n\"Let's go, Mark.\" The big Starman stepped up next to the console with \nMadera. Mark felt a bit of stage fright. Anxiety coursed through him as \nhe suddenly realized that there was so little time left and that the \nability to turn the asteroid aside depended on him. Having an audience \nof more than thirty men daunted him.\n\n\"It doesn't depend entirely on you, Mark,\" said Madera, appearing to \nread Mark's mind. \"Now let's power up.\"\n\nMark felt the anxiety drain away. He pressed the power button he had \ndiscovered before, when the Starmen had been escaping from the pirates. \nThe computer screen surged into life. The men cheered, and Madera \nsmiled. Joe stretched exultantly and appeared to grow two inches taller.\n\nZip's brow remained furrowed. He showed little emotion. For him the \ntime to exult would be when the asteroid had been diverted. This was \nonly a vital step in the process. There were others ahead.\n\nMark kept his eyes on the screen but spoke to Mr. Madera. \"I have a \ntheory, Mr. Madera. There must be power enough in this system, and far \nmore than enough, to turn the asteroid aside. We don't need to find out \nwhat Zimbardo's burned out. We should try to get access to the rest of \nthe system. The diagrams I sent you show that there must be plenty of \npower. We just have to find out how to turn it on!\"\n\n\"That's sound reasoning, Mark,\" nodded Madera. \"And probably easier \nthan trying to locate whatever damage Zimbardo did.\"\n\nFor some time, Mark and Madera conversed quietly as Mark flipped \nthrough file after file. Diagrams appeared and Mark's fingers flew over \nthe screen as he pointed out what he had learned while journeying on \nthe Star Ranger. Madera nodded, and pointed out several connections \nMark had not seen.\n\nOnce, Madera handed a small diagnostic pack to one of the technicians \nand sent him to climb the iron latticework. The man returned in a few \nmoments and gave a report. Madera nodded again and turned to Mark.\n\nThree hours went by. Joe's eyes were drooping, but Zip was still \nintent, his eyes on Mark.\n\nMark clapped his hands and turned to Madera. Madera smiled and raised \nhis eyebrows. With an open hand, he gestured to the control panel. Mark \nnodded his thanks and pressed several buttons. The files changed \nrapidly at each new command. Then Mark made fists and clenched a few \ntimes as if massaging his fingers. Then he raised his hand and prepared \nto press a button off to the side of the panel.\n\nSuddenly he leaped back a foot, his hands lifted as if he had touched a \nhot surface. His face was white, his eyes were wide open, and he was \nbreathing hard. His body was trembling as if he were deadly frightened. \nZip shot forward, pushing his way through the crowd to reach Mark.\n\n\"What is it, Mark? What's wrong?\" His voice was urgent.\n\n\"The power plant-it's thousands of years old!\" Mark wasn't looking at \nZip-he was still looking forward, as if his eyes were being drawn to \nthe controls. \"Pressing this button...\" he stopped and swallowed hard, \nand blinked twice. \"Pressing this button is the last step in activating \nthe rest of the power plant. It should give us the power we need, \nbut-but it's clear that it hasn't been activated for thousands of \nyears. There's no way to tell whether it's safe. This is a complicated \nsystem. If something is wrong,\" Mark slowly turned to face Zip, \"If \nsomething is wrong, if a bolt has slipped into the wrong place, if \nZimbardo bypassed a vital circuit somewhere, or if a conduit is stopped \nup anywhere, all the energy this plant can produce could blow back at \nus. The entire works could explode into a million pieces.\"\n\nZip looked at the floor for an instant, then looked up again and stared \ndirectly into Mark's eyes. \"You're right, Mark; but there's no other \nchoice. You have to do it.\"\n\nMark's exhaled quickly. \"Oh, I know, Zip-I know. But as I reached out \nmy hand, I had a sudden chill that our destruction was a second away. \nIt just didn't feel right. And if this asteroid blows into fragments, \nthen Earth will be peppered with hundreds of devastating impacts!\"\n\nZip slowly turned and faced the silent crowd. Every face was marked \nwith grave intensity. Joe stood at the back, his face drawn and tense.\n\n\"You all heard,\" Zip said. \"But you all know that we have no choice.\" \nNo one said anything. A few men dropped their eyes and shuffled their \nfeet. Zip turned to Mr. Madera in silent appeal. Madera nodded very \nslowly.\n\nThen Mark wiped both hands on his shirt and slowly reached out and \npressed the last button.\n\nA distant grinding noise as of gears engaging sounded from far away. \nThere was a whooshing sound as of air filling a giant bag. The grinding \nsound leveled off into a bare hum. The lights gradually came on. \n\nThe men cheered. Mark looked relieved. The tension under which he had \nbeen operating quickly released. His face wrinkled up and tears began \nto flow down his cheeks.\n\nThen the bare hum began to build. It turned into a whine, and then into \na shriek. The floor began to shudder. Mark wiped his eyes and stared at \nthe screen.\n\n\"The reaction is starting, but the energy level is climbing much faster \nthan it should! Something's wrong! Something's wrong!!\"\n\nThe men began to hear small explosions. There was a popping sound as a \nflexible tube burst a few yards away. Tinkling glass rained down in \nseveral places as light bulbs popped with the influx of too much \nenergy. Mark began to flip rapidly through files on the screen.\n\nAll at once a panel a hundred yards away blew out in a monstrous \nexplosion. A burst of brilliant white light blinded the men \nmomentarily. As their eyes returned to normal a loud hiss cut through \nthe air and continued to build. Yellow and orange sparks erupted in a \nspectacular shower from the damaged panel. Mark turned toward the site \nwith a look of panic. Without warning a connector at the panel lit up \nwith a coruscating orange color. Unable to handle the power surge, it \nbegan to melt and fragment. In less than a second, the damage shot \nthrough the connector and came to where it entered the computer \nterminal. There was a sickening, deep \"brrzzz\" sound, and the screen \nwent dark.\n\nMark slumped toward the floor. Madera grabbed the Starman before he \nfell and eased him to the iron deck. Joe ran forward.\n\n\n21: The Asteroid Over Vanuatu\n\nZIP was already hunched over Mark when Joe came to the front of the \ncrowd. A few of the men hovered nearby, which others ran to the site of \nthe explosion. Most stayed in place, looking around nervously.\n\n\"Is he...?\" stammered Joe.\n\n\"He sustained a powerful shock,\" said Madera. \"The energy was too much \nfor that panel and it backed up to the terminal here. Mark had his hand \non the keyboard.\"\n\nZip was taking Mark's pulse. Mark's right hand was blackened and his \nsleeve was frayed up to the elbow. \"His pulse is strong. I think he's \njust unconscious. It must have been quite a blow!\"\n\n\"Yes, it was,\" said Madera. \"I could feel the power of it just standing \nnearby! But his heart is beating strongly! Let's get him back to the \nTempest where he can receive some care!\"\n\n\"What about the power?\" asked Joe, getting to his feet.\n\n\"Look around you, Joe,\" said Madera with a wave of his hand.\n\nJoe and Zip looked out toward the plant.\n\n\"Hey!\" exclaimed Joe. \"It's okay! It's leveled off!\" The shriek had \ndiminished to a gentle hum once again, and the sounds of popping \nconduits and breaking glass had disappeared. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"I think that the panel over there was a huge breaker for this part of \nthe power system. Mark was right. There was enormous danger in starting \nthe plant up after so long. The energy surged through it and even the \nbreaker couldn't handle it very well. It blew up when it couldn't \nhandle the strain any more, and diverted the energy it couldn't absorb \nback into the terminal here. Fortunately for Mark, by that time there \nwas only a little left.\" Madera glanced down at Mark. \"He's a brave \nman.\"\n\n\"Yes, he is,\" confirmed Joe with some animation. He and Zip picked Mark \nup. With the help of two others, they carried him to the elevator. In \nless than a minute, all the men were on their way back to the control \ncenter and the Tempest.\n\nWithin ten minutes they were back in the main hall. Through the great \ndoors they could see more than two dozen spacecraft arrayed on the \nextensive launching pad.\n\nMark sighed deeply, then moaned. The four men who were carrying him \nkept up the pace. Joe called out, \"Mark! How're you doing?\"\n\nMark moaned again, blinked, then opened his eyes. He stared up at the \nceiling, appearing not to see anything. Then suddenly he began to \nstruggle.\n\n\"Hey! Hey, what're you doing?\" he cried out. \"Put me down!\"\n\n\"Easy, Mark,\" said Zip. \"You had a shock, but you'll be okay!\":\n\n\"I'm okay now! Put me down! I have to fix the panel! Where are you \ntaking me?\"\n\n\"Everything's fine, Mark,\" said Mr. Madera. \"The system leveled out and \nthe power is back on and controlled.\"\n\nMark sank back with another sigh. \"Great,\" he said. \"Put me down, \nthough. I'm all right.\" The men set him on his feet, but supported him \nas he wobbled, trying to get his balance.\n\n\"Wow! Am I tired!\" he said at last. \"Somebody help me to my bunk and \nwake me when it's over.\"\n\n\"I'll go with you, Mark,\" said Joe. With Joe trying to support the \nlarger of the two Starmen, the two of them walked slowly across the \nquad to the airlock that led to the launching pad.\n\n\"We're still not finished,\" said Madera. \"We have to steer the asteroid \nout of its collision course. For that, I think we'll need some help \nfrom an unlikely source.\"\n\n\"Gene,\" stated Zip.\n\n\"Gene,\" affirmed Starlight Enterprise's Chief Ioneer.\n\nJesus Madera reached for his communicator and asked that Gene be sent \nto him from where he was being held in the Tempest. Madera dismissed \nthe men who had been with them in the power plant, then turned to the \nred-headed Starman.\n\n\"I'm sure that Joe or even I could pilot the asteroid if we had to, but \nit is best that Gene do it-best for him.\"\n\n\"Of course, Mr. Madera,\" said Zip. \"I understand.\"\n\nWhile they waited, the Starman gazed around. Far above was the roof of \nthe great chamber like an iron sky. The natural lights of the complex \nonce again blazed throughout the structures. The air seemed fresher.\n\nHe and Madera watched Gene descend the ladder and jump the last few \nrungs to the pad. Then he turned and paced quickly to the closest \nentrance in the great wall. He came through the airlock, discarded his \nhelmet, and hurried to the small group that was waiting for him. \n\n\"We have restored power,\" said Madera.\n\n\"So I see!\" said Gene with a great smile. \"That's terrific! Do you want \nme to pilot the asteroid away from Earth?\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I want you to do. Let's go.\"\n\nThe three men made their way along the corridors, hastened past open \ndoorways, and took the elevator up one flight to the control center. \nThey passed dozens of SE men and members of Space Command. Captain Mary \nMarks-Owens was supervising their work.\n\nOnce in the control center, Gene took his seat at the main console, \nglanced at the Starman and the other men in the large room, then stared \nat the screen before him. He scratched his head, then placed his hands \non the keyboard and activated it.\n\n\"Whew!\" he exclaimed a moment later. \"Well over 290,000 miles per hour! \nIt would be better to turn this asteroid aside and pass by the Earth \nrather than try to bring it into orbit, as Zimbardo had planned at \nfirst. We're going too fast for that!\"\n\n\"My thoughts exactly,\" said Madera, seating himself on a stool next to \nGene. \"Let's see how you do it.\"\n\nGene plotted coordinates and tracked the trajectory of the runaway \nasteroid, then calculated the amount of thrust needed to pass the Earth \nat a safe distance. He figured how much he could slow the asteroid down \nwithout putting too much stress on the inhabitants. When he was \nfinished, he turned to Madera.\n\n\"Okay?\"\n\n\"Looks right to me!\"\n\n\"Well, then...here goes.\" Gene entered the figures into the primary \nguidance system and activated it. Tears suddenly came into his eyes. \n\"Oh, please let it be enough, let it be right, let it work,\" he \nwhispered.\n\n\n\nThe Starmen woke after twelve hours of sleep aboard the Star Ranger. \nUncharacteristically, Joe was the last one up. He found a note in the \nwashroom that read, \"We're on the Tempest. Join us for breakfast \nwhenever you're ready.\" He washed up quickly and hastened to the SE \nfleet command ship.\n\nReadily admitted, he found his two colleagues in the dining area. Mark \nand Zip were just finishing a large platter of scrambled eggs and \ncheese, potatoes, freshly-squeezed juice, and hot coffee. \"I'll have \nthe same, but with tea,\" he announced, and sat down.\n\n\"Yes sir,\" came a voice from the galley. \n\n\"How're you feeling this morning, Mark?\" asked Joe. \"How's your hand?\"\n\n\"Couldn't feel better, Joe! Had a good sleep at last, and my hand \nshould be healed in a couple of weeks. It was a second-degree burn.\"\n\nA few moments later, Gene came out carrying Joe's breakfast.\n\n\"Gene!\" exclaimed Joe.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Taylor. Just trying to help out a little,\" said the erstwhile \npirate.\n\n\"He cooks as well as he pilots,\" said Mark.\n\n\"We're safe, then.\" Joe made it a statement rather than a question as \nhe shook some pepper onto the steaming eggs.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Zip. \"The asteroid will sweep past the Earth in a week, \nmissing it by about 50,000 miles. It will be visible for almost the \nwhole night over the south Pacific, like a fast-moving star. Should be \nquite a sight!\"\n\n\"Then what?\" asked Joe between gulps of juice.\n\n\"Then what, what?\" responded Mark.\n\n\"Then where does it go?\"\n\n\"As Gene said yesterday,\" explained Zip, \"it's moving too fast to enter \nan orbit around the Earth, so Gene steered it into a course around the \nsun. It will take about seven months to circle the sun just inside \nEarth's orbit. Then it will catch up to the Earth and can easily be \nplaced into an Earth orbit at that time. Scientists from Starlight \nEnterprise will live on it and try to learn its secrets. In fact, a \nship will be launched from SE in a couple of days with a crew of them. \nThey'll intercept the asteroid and start the exploration right away.\"\n\nMark continued bringing Joe up to date. \"The Captain's got a team \nreplacing the huge airlock on the surface of the asteroid, and the \ntemporary power supply packets are being reloaded on the ships. We're \nin complete control of the asteroid now.\"\n\n\"Where's Madera?\"\n\n\"He finally got a full sleep, then went back into the complex. He can't \nwait to find out how it all works. He's hoping that Richard will put \nhim in charge of the exploration team.\"\n\nJoe scooped a large helping of potatoes into his mouth, then talked \naround it to ask, \"Well, when do we leave?\"\n\n\"I'm excited about this place, and would like to explore a bit myself,\" \nsaid Zip, \"but more than anything, I'd like to go home. We can leave \nany time we want to.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see Mr. Madera one more time before we go, and then take \noff for home.\"\n\n\n\nA day later, the Star Ranger was well on its way to Amundsen City. The \nStarmen were relaxed, seated comfortably at a small table in the \nlounge, with the ship on automatic pilot. The strains of Bach's Little \nFugue filled the ship.\n\nJoe asked, \"Is that the disk Montezuma Vly gave us?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mark. \"That was destroyed when Lather melted the Vigilant \nWarrior. This is just part of our standard library. Beautiful piece. \nBut I sure wish we hadn't lost that disk Montezuma gave us. What a \ntragedy!\"\n\n\"Yes, well, Vly did say that we could visit him again. Maybe he'll give \nus another.\"\n\n \"I'd like to see him again, but not for a while. I don't want to leave \nhome for a long time!\"\n\nAt the end of their journey, the Star Ranger touched down gently on the \ntarmac at Amundsen Base, near the south pole of the Moon on the edge of \nthe largest city in the Earth-Moon system-Amundsen City, with over \neight million inhabitants. The Starmen debarked from their ship, \ncrossed the field and entered the airlock that led into the receiving \narea. Through the second door, they could see an enormous crowd.\n\n\"Man! This place is jammed!\" said Joe. \"I've never seen so many people \nhere!\" As air filled the airlock, the Starmen removed their helmets and \ntucked them under their arms. Moments later they entered the public \nterminal. A roar went up from hundreds of voices.\n\n\"What's this?\" yelled Mark to Zip and Joe. He could barely make himself \nheard above the clamor.\n\n\"Look!\" cried out Zip. \"Our families!\" With a big smile on his face, he \npointed to the front of the crowd. There were the boys' parents-Allen \nand Elizabeth Foster with Zip's eight-year old sister, Kathy; Keith and \nBarbara Seaton; and Charlie and Laura Taylor. All were smiling hugely.\n\n\"Wow!\" exclaimed Mark. \"All these people are here for us!\"\n\nAlthough the crowd was being kept behind a light barrier of stanchions \nand ribbons, as soon as the Starmen came through the airlock, Zip's \nsister Kathy ducked under the ribbon and ran toward them.\n\n\"David, David!\" she yelled. When she was still a few feet away from her \nbrother, she leaped and flew into his welcoming arms. \"David, I missed \nyou!\" she cried, snuggling her head into his shoulder. \"I was so \nworried!\"\n\nZip smelled the little girl's hair and realized how much he loved her \nand his home. A lump came into his throat and he unexpectedly burst \ninto tears, kissed her forehead and her cheek, and whispered, \"Oh, \nKathy, I missed you too, even more than I knew.\"\n\nZip's mother Elizabeth had the same red hair that he had, while his \nfather Allen had dark hair, now turning a dignified salt-and-pepper. \nBut Kathy had inherited the best of both hair colors. Her deep maroon \nhair shone with health. Zip picked her up and she wrapped her arms \naround his neck; then, pressing his cheek to hers, they came to where \ntheir parents were waiting for him. Joe and Mark, neither of whom had \nany brothers or sisters, were already greeting their parents.\n\n\n\nOn the evening of September 9, the asteroid streaked through the night \nsky, drawing the awed attention of people all over the planet. It was \nbest seen from the island of Vanuatu in the south Pacific from just \nafter dusk to the hour before dawn when its glow was overwhelmed by the \ndawnlight. Had the asteroid not been controlled, September 9 would have \nbeen the first of the last days of life on Earth.\n\nThe day after, the President presided at a worldwide celebration in \nhonor of the Starmen-a celebration to honor them for their critical \nrole in freeing Mars from the clutches of the pirates. The celebration \nhad been postponed when the greatest threat ever to menace the Earth \nwas engineered by Lurton Zimbardo, and then turned aside.\n\nThe Starmen were the subjects of many award ceremonies, dinners and \nreceptions, interviews, and parades. With them were Richard Starlight, \nRobert Nolan, Jesus Madera-Cruz, and others who had been instrumental \nin freeing the Earth from destruction. The three Starmen were delighted \nto see Steve Cliff again, for he was honored along with them for the \npart he had played in the liberation of Mars. Jack and Jill were also \ninvited, but preferred to remain on the Moon out of the limelight.\n\nThe highlight of the celebration was a ceremony on the grounds of the \ncapital in New Washington, when the President presented medals to the \nStarmen for their valor. The medals had been fashioned from plates in \nthe Gloria, the spaceship that had taken Lee High Eagle to Mars in \n2014, the first spaceship to carry human beings to another planet.\n\nWhen it was all over, the Starmen returned to their homes in Amundsen \nCity for a long and much-needed time of rest.\n\nOne afternoon, they were in Richard Starlight's office. Richard had not \nhad an opportunity to hear the Starmen's entire story from beginning to \nend. He had invited them to join him, John Rwakatare, Robert Nolan, and \nBeowulf Denn for a relaxing afternoon so that the top four leaders of \nStarlight Enterprise and Nolan Mining Enterprise could hear firsthand \nthe complete tale of the Starmen's adventures.\n\nTea and coffee were provided in a luxurious silver service that had \nbeen in Richard's family for generations-one of the few heirlooms that \nhad been preserved through the Collapse. On the silverware was engraved \nthe letter \"R,\" the only clue to Richard's surname that still existed. \nNearly a century earlier, before founding Starlight Enterprise \nRichard's father Thomas had changed his name to \"Starlight\" and \ndestroyed all records that spoke of his past.\n\nAfter the three Starmen had finished recounting their adventures, no \none spoke for a long time. Joe poured himself a fresh cup of tea. Most \nof them gazed out of the panoramic window at the desolate beauty of the \nlunar landscape.\n\nAt length Richard said, \"Starmen, you've had some exciting adventures, \nand in them you've gained something valuable and lasting: you are now a \nteam. You've learned how to work together, how to think like Starmen \nand act like Starmen. You're experienced, proven Starmen now! You \nmanaged to escape from the clutches of the most dangerous, crazed \nmaniac our century has ever seen. And you've had contact, however \nfleeting, with the second intelligent extra-terrestrial race that Earth \nhas met-certainly ahead of the Titanians and far ahead of us!\n\n\"But as far as Starman's work goes, keep in mind that your adventures \nwere the exception, not the rule. I know you've got exciting careers \nahead, all three of you! You're three brilliant Starmen and you're a \ncredit to Starlight Enterprise-but your next adventure could be as \nunglamorous as mapping geological samples in the canyons of Mercury.\"\n\n\"What will happen to Gene?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"He will be tried with the rest of the pirates. His assistance in \nturning the asteroid aside and the intercession of Jesus Madera will \nprobably stand him in good stead when his sentence is pronounced.\"\n\n\"What of the aliens aboard the asteroid, sir?\"\n\n\"Well, maybe they're still there and maybe they're not. We saw no trace \nof them after your first encounter. My guess is that there were just \nthe two of them, maybe a few more, and that they departed from the \nasteroid about the time you did. We have plenty of time now to explore \nthe entire asteroid, and if they're there, we'll find them; and if not, \nwe'll find whatever traces there are to be found!\"\n\nBut Richard was wrong. Nothing and no one on Earth had the capability \nof finding and entering the inner sanctum on the asteroid. The \nrevelation of the alien inhabitants would come only if and when the \naliens wished it, and even Richard Starlight could not determine or \npredict when that might be.\n\nZip said, \"But it's not over yet, is it, sir? Whatever or whoever the \naliens were afraid of hasn't even been identified, much less overcome. \nAnd there are still six pirates who haven't been captured. Zimbardo is \nstill free and we haven't any idea where he is. And the independent \nsmugglers that Gene told us about disappeared without a trace.\"\n\nRichard suddenly looked serious. \"You're right, Zip-and there's still \nthe matter of how Zimbardo knew our plans. Somewhere in our \norganization he has an ally-at least one.\"\n\nWulf Denn set his coffee cup down carefully and remarked, \"But for now, \nthings are peaceful. There is no danger anywhere, and no sign of any \nthreat-and the amazing asteroid is ours to explore!\"\n\n\"Right you are,\" agreed Rock, \"and there are many secrets it can reveal \nto us. Time enough for us to face tomorrow's dangers tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Starmen were comforted. If even Rock was not on guard, they felt \nfree to relax.\n\n\"What will you do now?\" asked Robert Nolan.\n\n\"Well sir,\" said Mark. \"David's uncle and aunt have invited all of us \nto go their farm in West Virginia-our parents and David's sister, \ntoo-for a long vacation. I love the stars, but frankly, spending time \nin the woods and fields, eating home-cooked meals at a large table with \nfifteen or so people, and sitting in front of a fireplace appeals to me \nmore than I can say!\"\n\n\"I don't blame you!\" laughed Robert.\n\n\"But don't get too comfortable,\" warned Richard, with a chuckle. \n\"Something will come along before too long!\"\n\n\"Maybe mapping geological samples in the canyons of Mercury,\" suggested \nJoe.\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Richard.\n\n\n\nA little more than two months later, as the Seatons, Taylors, and \nFosters prepared to celebrate Thanksgiving dinner on the farm, the \nTartarus was speeding through the void.\n\n\"We've just passed the orbit of Neptune, sir,\" announced the pilot.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Gebbeth. We're making good time.\" Those who had seen \nLurton Zimbardo in his last hours aboard the runaway asteroid would \nhave been surprised to learn that he could be a patient man. As he had \ndone almost obsessively since he had fled the asteroid, he sorted \nthrough his thoughts.\n\n\"Hundreds of us reduced to dozens, and then dozens reduced to this \nhandful of six. The Superiors promised me power once I had obtained for \nthem the access codes to Earth's primary systems. Access codes! That's \nall they wanted, and Earth was to be mine for payment! I did my best! \nBut now I will appeal to them directly and they will push these Starmen \naside without mercy!\"\n\nIn the next book of the chronicles of the Starmen, JOURNEY TO THE TENTH \nPLANET, the threat to Earth will take new form. In the dark reaches \nbeyond the orbit of Pluto, in the near-absolute zero of space, the \nStarmen will finally encounter the overwhelming power of the true \nenemies of Earth.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\nCertain words used by George St. George are part of the backwoods \nculture of Davy Crockett, and come from the nineteenth century.\n\nabsquatulate depart, run away\nexflunct exhaust, beat thoroughly\nobflisticated bewildered, confused\nramsquaddle demolish\nripstavera first-rate person or thing\nslantindicular in a slanting direction\n\n_________\n\nFuture volumes in the Starman series will\n\n* Bring Earthmen face-to-face with Zimbardo's Superiors\n* Relate how the pirates are brought to their last stand\n* Introduce the spine-tingling new villain, Banjoman\n* Describe flilox, the new threat to Mars\n* Reveal the thrilling secret of the pirates' asteroid\n\n\nHere's just a sample of action from the next Starman book, JOURNEY TO \nTHE TENTH PLANET:\n\nThe long journey was coming to an end. Pluto was about three and a half \nbillion miles from Earth, and the tenth planet was more than two \nbillion miles farther than that-but coming closer. Its figure-eight \norbit around the brown dwarf star Nemesis made it unique in the Solar \nSystem.\n\nNow the Starventure was close enough that the tenth planet could be \nseen with the unaided eye. Everyone aboard was positioned at a window \nin the great cabin just behind the pilot's console to view the \nbi-stellar wanderer.\n\nFor moments no one said anything. The planet had been thoroughly \ndescribed to all of them, but no scientific description, no matter how \naccurate, could have prepared them for the actuality.\n\n\"It looks as if it is made out of charcoal,\" whispered Joe finally.\n\n\"Or obsidian,\" contributed Mark in a subdued voice. \n\nBefore long, Joe brought the ship into a low orbit around the tenth \nplanet. Over 4,000 miles in diameter, it was everywhere foreboding, \nsapping the spirit out of whoever looked upon it. The Starmen \nthemselves were depressed at the sight.\n\nOnly about 20% of the planet's surface was anything near smooth, and \nthe smooth parts were scattered into many different, small areas. More \nthan half the terrain was comprised of jagged planes of crystallized \nmaterial, heaped together as if at random. The planet was covered with \nsharp points and razor-thin ridges, scarred with tortuous narrow \ncanyons, and marked with pits and shadows-darkness upon darkness.\n\n\"Surface temperature?\" asked Zip.\n\n\"Minus 342 degrees, just as Dr. O said,\" answered Mark. \"As we \nexpected, it has no atmosphere. Whatever atmosphere it has is frozen on \nthe surface of the planet.\"\n\nA man behind them choked. The fear in the room was palpable. There was \nno logical reason for it, but the Starmen wouldn't quibble with the \ncrew members.\n\n\"I don't want to go down there,\" said another in a hushed tone.\n\nNow that the great ship had attained orbit, the time had come for Zip \nto announce the name of the tenth planet. The name had been chosen \nmonths earlier by Dr. O who had discovered it, and therefore had the \nright to determine how it would be known throughout history.\n\nWithout any preamble, Zip retrieved the sealed envelope from the \nStarventure's safe. As he did so, the men gathered around him. He \nturned and faced the crew. Glancing into their faces, he could almost \nfeel their apprehension.\n\n\"It's only a planet,\" he said, trying to sound normal. \"It's just stone \nand ice such as we've seen in many other places of the Solar System.\" \nHe tore open the envelope, unfolded the paper that was inside it, and \nstared at what Dr. O had written.\n\n\"Well?\" asked Joe.\n\n\"The planet's name is Nyx. Dr. O named it after the Roman goddess of \nnight.\"\n\n\"And somewhere down there we expect to find Lurton Zimbardo,\" declared \nJoe, more a statement than a question. He glanced almost casually out \nof the window again. Suddenly he stiffened.\n\n\"What's that?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"What's what?\" cried out Mark. Everyone rushed to the windows once \nagain.\n\n\"I saw a glint, down there, just beyond that high ridge. It's gone now.\"\n\n\"Check the video feed,\" ordered Zip. Instantly the cabin was filled \nwith excitement.\n\n\nLike it? Want to see how it comes out? Keep up with the latest news in \nthe Starman series by checking our web site regularly.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\n\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n"}
