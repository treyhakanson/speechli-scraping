He frowned; he glanced at his watch; he leaned\nforward to speak to the copter pilot and then changed his mind. He\nsettled back, and from idle habit adjusted his chair-scope to the\nfamiliar broad-spoked area of Washington just below.\n\n\"I'll _not_ have it happening again today!\" he told himself grimly ...\nand at once his thoughts quavered off into many tangles of\nself-reproach. \"Blasted nonsense the way I've been acting. A _machine_,\na damned gutless machine like that! Why do I persist in letting it get\nto me?\"\n\nHe pondered that and found no solace. \"Delusion,\" he snorted. \"Hyper\nsynapse-disorder ... that's how Jeff Arnold would explain _me_. I wish\nhe'd confine his diagnostics to the Mechanical Division where it\nbelongs! He's amused, they're all amused at me--but damn it they just\ndon't know!\"\n\nBeardsley's rotund body sagged at the thought. Adjusting the\nchair-scope, he fixed his gaze on the broad facade of Crime-Central\nBuilding far across the city; again he felt the burgeoning embarrassment\nand foreboding, but he put it down with an effort before it reached the\nedge of fear. _Not today_, he thought fiercely. _No, by God, I just\nwon't permit it to happen._\n\nThere. So! He felt much better already. And he had really made good time\nthis morning. Today of _all_ days he mustn't keep ECAIAC waiting.\n\n[Illustration: Beardsley was the only one _not_ to panic when the\ninfallible machine broke down.]\n\nMustn't.... Something triggered in Beardsley, and he was assailed with a\nperverse rebellion at the thought.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMust not? But why not? Why shouldn't he just _once_ keep ECAIAC and Jeff\nArnold and his clique stewing in their own tangle of tubes and\nelectronic juice? And wouldn't _this_, he gloated, be the perfect day\nfor it! Arnold especially--just once to shatter that young man's\ncomplacent routine....\n\nNo. Beardsley savored the thought tastily, and let it trickle away, and\nthe look of glee on his cherubic face was gone. For too many years his\njob as serological \"co\u00f6rdinator\" (Crime-Central) had kept him pinned to\nthe concomitant routine. Pinned or crucified, it was all the same; in\ncrime analysis as in everything these days, personal sense of\nachievement had been too unsubtly annihilated. Recalling his just\ncompleted task--the Citizen Files and _persona-tapes_ and the endless\nannotating--Beardsley felt himself sinking still further into that mire\nof futility that encompassed neither excitement nor particular pride.\n\nHe brought himself back with a grimace, aware that he was clutching the\nbriefcase of tapes possessively from long habit. The pilot had touched\nthe news-stat, and abruptly one of the new \"commerciappeals\" grated on\nBeardsley's senses:\n\n\"... we repeat, yes, PROT-O-SUDS is now available in _flake_ or _cake_ or\nthe new attachable _luxury-spray_. Remember, PROT-O-SUDS has _never_ been\nlaboratory-tested, it contains _no_ miracle ingredients, _no_ improved\nscientific formula, and NO LANOLIN. Then what is the new PROT-O-SUDS? I\ntell you frankly, friends, it is nothing but a lot of pure soft soap!\nRemember ... we make no fabulous claims for PROT-O-SUDS ... we assume that\nyou are reasonably clean to start with! And now for your late breakfast\nnews, PROT-O-SUDS takes you direct to the Central News Bureau for a final\nsurvey on the Carmack murder case....\"\n\nBeardsley groaned. New voice in the background, while the screen presented\na slow montage. Cine-runs of the great Carmack himself, including those at\nthe International Cybernetics Congress a year ago ... survey of the murder\nscene, the Carmack mansion ... close-up of ECAIAC ... diagrammatic detail\nof ECAIAC ... then dramatically, the grim and imposing figure of George\nMandleco, Minister of Justice.\n\nAnd then the news-caster's voice: \"... certain that final processing\nwill go forward today. It would be a gross understatement to say that\nthe Carmack Case has captured the attention of the nation, both\nofficialdom and public alike! _Never_ in the history of Crime-Central\nhas there been such an undercurrent of speculation and excitement....\"\n\n\"Excitement?\" murmured Beardsley.\n\n\"And now it is heightened, by no less an authority than the Minister of\nJustice himself, who brought both plaudits and censure upon himself\ntoday with the outright statement that _deep-rooted political issues_\nmay well be involved. As you must know by now, it was the murdered man\nhimself--Amos Carmack--who some years ago carried on the incessant\nlobbying that resulted in ECAIAC being accepted _pro bono publico_ by\nCrime-Central. What devastating irony! For now it is ECAIAC itself that\nmust weigh each detail, correlate all factors, probe every motive and\nmachination leading to the _murder of its creator_....\"\n\n\"That's not entirely true, you know,\" muttered Beardsley.\n\nQuick flicker, again a close-up of ECAIAC, and the drama-laden voice:\n\"ECAIAC! Electronic Analysis Integrator and Computor. And now--an\nexclusive! From a very reliable source this reporter has learned that\n_three Primes_ are involved....\"\n\n\"Ha!\" grated Beardsley.\n\n\"... and they will be broken down in quotient. Two must ultimately be\neliminated--barring, of course, the possible emergence of any minor\nfactor to status of Prime, which at this stage seems unlikely. It is\nestimated that by today or tomorrow at the latest Carmack's murderer\nwill be brought to justice....\"\n\nBeardsley had taken as much as he could of this pseudo-factual mush. He\njerked forward violently, rapped the pilot on the shoulder. \"DAMN IT!\nWILL YOU SHUT THE DAMN THING OFF!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was immediately appalled at his outburst, and by the pilot's startled\nglance, but the stat went off immediately.\n\nBeardsley leaned back muttering to himself. Carmack, Carmack! For seven\nweeks now he had lived with it intricately and intimately, as the case\nshoved everything else right off the news-stat. People took the latest\nechoes to bed with them, commuters gobbled it with their breakfast\ncereal. Thank God today would see the end, and they could once more have\nthe hot South Polar crisis with their cereal.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSeven weeks! He clutched the bulging briefcase with a wearisome horror.\nTwenty-two persona-tapes from Central File, all neatly processed and\nready for ECAIAC. End result of the endless chart sifts, emphasis (as\nalways!) on parietosomatic recession, the slow emergence of minor\nconstants, the inexorable trend toward Price Factor and then\n_verification_, _verification_, to each his own, with all the subtle and\nshaded values of the Augment Index brought finally to focus on the\nrelevance-graph _Carmack_.\n\nSure, thought Beardsley. A thing of augment-indexing and psych-tapes,\nquite without possibility of error. Now in the _old_ days of crime\ndetection--it might have taken them seven months instead of weeks, not\nto mention frustration and leg-work and false-leads and sweat, but--\n\nHis mouth pulled down bitterly. _Serological Co\u00f6rdinator. Glorified\nfile-clerk is more like it. High-salaried errand-boy._\n\n\"Here we are, sir!\" The pilot's voice jarred him to reality as the\ncopter berthed.\n\nBeardsley hurried toward the roof entrance. His faded blue suit, a size\ntoo large, flapped about him, and the outmoded felt hat seemed to sink\nto the level of his thick-lensed glasses. The guard greeted him, but\nsuppressed a smile as the cherubic little man flashed his official pass.\n\nFor there was something about Raoul Beardsley that eternally evoked\namusement--an air of vacuous innocence and a remote forlornness. He gave\nthe appearance of a person who sold shoes during the day, washed his\nwife's dishes at night and then solved two or three galacti-gram puzzles\nbefore turning off the light precisely at ten. Few, if any, remembered\nthat this nervous little man had once been top Inspector of New York\nCity's Homicide Bureau ... but that was a dozen long years ago. Since\nthen he had seen the antiquated detective methods of 1960 disappear, and\nhe had died a little, too, seeing his Homicide Bureau relegated to a\nmere subsidiary with the growth of the Co\u00f6rdinate and Mechanical\nDivisions. His appointment to Chief of Co-\u00f6rdinants, Federal, was\nautomatic and unquestioned; and Beardsley would have been the last to\nknow, or to care, that he had correlated some eight million miles of\nserological data for the entrains of ECAIAC, a perfect record of not a\nsingle unsolved case.\n\nAnd the penalty was in his eyes, if one cared to look beyond the\nthick-lensed glasses. No one ever did. They were remote eyes, a little\nbewildered, a little hurt ... a mirror gone dull from times remembered\nbut irretrievably lost.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeardsley stepped onto the corridor slidewalk, coasted to the escalator\nand rode it down. Still immersed in his thoughts, he pushed into\nECAIAC's room ... _and again it happened_.\n\nSo shockingly sudden, there was not even time for remonstrance at\nhimself. The feeling hit him as always before, straight and unerring, a\nsurging impact that smashed forward and stopped him in his tracks,\nliterally paralyzed.\n\nHe caught his breath convulsively. How often had he come here? And how\noften had this happened, even when he'd sworn he wouldn't let it? There\nwas something about the sight and sound and feel of ECAIAC that got to\nhim, that seeped beneath flesh and bone and into his brain and sent his\nsenses singing. Beardsley managed to gulp, as he observed the shiny\nblack colossus that filled the entire length of the ninety-foot room; a\ndozen techs scurried around it, taking notes, attentive to the flashing\nlights in red-and-green and the faint clicking of thousands of relays\nthat rose in susurration.\n\nBut more than that arose. It was something that pervaded the room, not a\npulsing but a _presence_, a sort of snapping intangible intelligence\nthat reached beyond the audible and sheared at Beardsley's nerve-ends.\n\nAnd it hadn't been there a moment before. That was the shocking thing.\nBeardsley knew that it _knew_! It was sentient, it was alive and aware\nand waiting, and it was listening.\n\nAs always, it knew that _he_ had entered.\n\nBeardsley gulped again, stood frozen for half a minute. None of the\ntechs seemed to notice; they had often chided him about it, but he was\nused to that now. At last he broke the spell and made his legs move,\nfeeling cold sweat as he hurried along the length of ECAIAC toward\nArnold's office.\n\nThere ... just about there ... by the rheostats, where the four red\nlights and the two green made a baleful pattern against the black metal\nskin. He felt it stronger than ever this time, something reaching and\nsinister aimed solely at him. He skirted the place with a quick goosey\nhop, stumbled a little and felt panic, but made it all right to the\noffice.\n\nBeardsley hated these moments. He was still trembling as he made a\nhurried entrance. Sure enough, as if on cue Jeff Arnold glanced up from\nhis charts and grinned.\n\n\"Ah, good morning, Beardsley! Now don't tell me our pet goo--uh--snapped\nat you again?\"\n\nIt was the routine remark, but today Arnold was immediately contrite for\na change. \"Sorry,\" he said, and a certain weariness replaced the grin.\nHe gestured to the alco-mech. \"Can I dial you a drink? Feel in need of\none myself!\"\n\n\"Eleven-C,\" said Beardsley, and slumped into the pneumo-chair. Arnold\nrose and dialled 11-C, handed him the drink and dialled 9-R for himself.\nSipping it, he moved around the desk.\n\nThere was something very strange and preoccupied in his movements,\nBeardsley thought, more than a mere tiredness. He had never seen Arnold\nthis way.\n\n\"Yes sir, this is the day!\" A muscle twitched in his corded neck; Arnold\neased his long frame into a chair, rubbed thumb and forefinger at his\neyes. \"Been up half the night running off clearance tests. Can't afford\nto foul up on this one!\"\n\nBeardsley tossed off his drink and blinked at the fiery strength of it.\nNow why should Arnold say that? When had ECAIAC ever fouled up? He\nwatched the man across the desk. Jeff Arnold was a vigorous, striking\nspecimen, handsome in an athletic way, with long stubborn jaw and\nunhappy gray eyes beneath his unruly hair; the sort of face that\nintrigues women, Beardsley catalogued from past experience. And, he\nadded, altogether too young a man to be operating a monster like ECAIAC.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nArnold indicated the empty glass. \"Another?\"\n\n\"No, I think not,\" Beardsley replied carefully.\n\nArnold hesitated, eyeing the briefcase in Beardsley's clutch. \"It's been\nrough on you, too, I imagine. Hope there aren't more than thirty\nvariants! We're set up for more, of course, but it'll necessitate--\"\n\n\"Twenty-two,\" Beardsley assured him. Carefully, he spread the coded and\nsealed _persona-tapes_ across the desk. \"Fresh from Citizen-File\nAugment, everything annotated and cross-checked. Blood-count, emotional\nstasis, plethora, psycho-geneological index, neuro-thalamic\nimbalance--every type factor is here. We really went to the Files on\nthis case.\"\n\n\"Looks as if you did! How does it narrow down?\"\n\n\"Fifteen possibles, four Logicals and three Primes--\" Beardsley stopped\nabruptly. (That news-caster: how had he known there were three Primes?\nThis stuff was not supposed to leak!) \"Twenty-two who _knew_ Carmack,\"\nhe went on. \"That includes associational as well as motive-opportunity\nfactors, with a probability sphere of .004....\"\n\nArnold nodded thoughtfully; his fingers moved unconscious and caressing\nacross the edge of the desk. \"Yes, I see. That's close! Good job,\" he\nsaid uncertainly.\n\n\"Should be! Seven weeks for annotation and code.\" Beardsley was watching\nArnold's fingers; there was something aimless and fretful as they pushed\namong the code-sealed tapes. Beardsley made his voice casual. \"If it\ninterests you,\" he said, \"yes--you are there.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe wanted a reaction and he got it.\n\n\"Me!\" Arnold stiffened, pulled his fingers away hastily.\n\n\"That surprises you? Don't worry, you're not one of the Primes; probably\nbe rejected on the first run. It's just that you once knew Carmack\nrather well. Cal Tech, wasn't it, when Carmack was doing his special\nwork on magnetronics? Naturally you've had contact since, due to the\nnature of your job.\"\n\nArnold nodded, frowning. \"That's right. It just hadn't occurred to me\nthat--\"\n\nBeardsley realized that he wasn't lying. _It was not the thought of his\nown tape that bothered Arnold._\n\n\"Oh, we're thorough over at 'Co\u00f6rdinates Division!'\" Beardsley laughed,\nmaking a minor joke of it. \"Now here,\" he touched a spool labelled in\nred, \"is your Basic Invariant. Carmack--Amos T. Murdered man. Found\nbludgeoned in library of his home, night of April 4. Age 56, held all\noutstanding patents on ECAIAC, worth millions, and\"--he looked up,\nbeaming--\"leaves beautiful wife.\"\n\nHe paused for the merest moment. Save for a soft drumming of fingers on\nthe desk, Arnold was silent.\n\n\"And here's a sub-Basic: Mrs. Carmack will be a rich woman now. She was\nconsiderably younger than Carmack--and she's been having an affair with\nanother man.\" Beardsley smiled at Jeff Arnold. \"That's a sociological\nnote beyond our sphere, but we managed to get the data. I'll bet the\ndepartment was appalled that such a gorgeous woman could be resolved\ninto neo-Euclidian equations!\"\n\n\"Why?\" Arnold was suddenly irritable. \"It's been done a thousand times\nbefore!\"\n\n\"Of course,\" shrugged Beardsley. \"And it's really up to ECAIAC, isn't\nit? A Prime can be negated, while on the other hand a variant can shift\nfrom possible to Logical to Prime. Or am I wrong? I've never been up on\nthe mechanics.\"\n\nArnold grunted. \"There's bound to be some correlatory shift! The\nPrimes--how many did you say?\"\n\n\"Three as of now.\"\n\nArnold rose abruptly, then strode to the alco-mech and dialled himself\nanother drink. He took an uncommonly long time about it. \"Look,\" he\nsaid, \"we both know about these things! In a case like this there are\nbound to be political repercussions--\" He hit Beardsley with a gauging\nglance. \"Well,\" he blurted, \"I have to admit I'm damn curious! Mind\ntelling me who are the three Primes? Ah--strictly off the record, you\nunderstand.\"\n\nBeardsley had expected something like this, and he was quite ready to\nanswer; but he carefully removed his glasses, massaged the bridge of his\nnose and frowned. \"Well, now....\"\n\n\"Come on, give! I know it's against protocol and all that ... but hell!\nWe'll have the answer anyway in a matter of hours.\"\n\nBeardsley nodded with a show of thoughtfulness. \"Yes, that's true, isn't\nit? Very well. But strictly off the record! I warn you--not only will\nthe first Prime startle you, but the information could be dangerous!\"\n\nHe waited a moment, then he leaned forward and whispered: \"Mandleco!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment Arnold didn't move. His face was ludicrous. Then Beardsley\nsaw his hands clench.\n\n\"Mandleco!\" the word jolted from his lips. \"George Mandleco, Minister of\nJustice? I don't believe you!\"\n\n\"It's a fact,\" Beardsley told him. \"Right now he equates into an\nuncertain Prime.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes ... but Mandleco! Good Lord....\"\n\n\"I said _uncertain_ Prime. As you mentioned yourself, there is sure to\nbe a shift of variants. Surely you have faith in ECAIAC?\"\n\n\"Of course! But Mandleco, why Mandleco?\"\n\n\"Why not? He was a friend of Carmack's--or a business associate shall we\nsay? He worked with Carmack on the ECAIAC lobby, was largely responsible\nfor pushing it through.\"\n\n\"Yes, I--say, that's right! It would be in C-F....\"\n\n\"There are things,\" murmured Beardsley, \"in Central File that would\nastound you.\"\n\nArnold was staring at the coded tapes. \"Mandleco,\" he breathed. \"And\nwith elections coming up!\" He shook himself out of the daze. \"The--the\nother two Primes?\"\n\n\"Next is not so startling. A really strong Recessive Factor there ...\nProfessor Karl Losch.\"\n\nArnold jerked erect suddenly. \"Losch? Say, I remember him! Now _there's_\na man pursued by bad luck. He was working along similar lines to\nCarmack--in fact, wasn't he in Carmack's employ for a while?--but\nCarmack was first with the patents. You don't suppose that Losch--\"\n\n\"I'm not supposed to suppose,\" Beardsley said softly. \"But clinically,\nit is interesting to note that motive factor alone equates Losch from\nLogical into Prime. _Plus_ a high neuro-thalamic imbalance--132 over 80\non the last Index, with pronounced efforts at suppression.\"\n\nHe watched Arnold absorb that, and went on: \"Now for the third Prime. I\nthink it'll interest you....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe waited deliberately. He looked at Jeff Arnold for a long moment and\nsaw that the man was calm. Too calm. So absolutely motionless that it\nwasn't real.\n\n\"Third Prime. A strong one, believe me. In a way most interesting of\nall.\" He pressed the words out slowly and flatly. \"The third Prime,\"\nsaid Beardsley, \"is ... Pederson.\"\n\nHe watched Arnold relax ever so slowly, leaning back, the tension going\naway as he uncoiled in the chair; but the young man's face wasn't so\nmuch relieved as it was puzzled.\n\n\"Pederson. Pederson? I don't seem to--You can't mean _Brook_ Pederson,\nthe one-time tele-columnist?\"\n\n\"None other. I don't suppose you remember, but back in '60 he opposed\nthe ECAIAC lobby. I mean _opposed_ it, _fought_ it! Predicted that\nGovernment installation of such a machine would not inspire confidence,\nthat the nation's crime rate would rise ... he saw nothing but chaos.\nFor a while there he was quite a man. Got himself a following. Had\nambitions.\"\n\n\"But I do remember it!\" Arnold thumped the desk. \"Of course! Pederson\nheaded a bloc against 'Carmack's Folly,' but he backed the wrong horse,\nand when the bubble burst he was out in the cold. Became a laughing\nstock.\" Arnold paused, and his glance held something of shrewdness and a\nlivening challenge. \"Actually, Pederson couldn't have been more wrong.\nIn those first two years ECAIAC reduced the crime-rate by some forty\npercent.\"\n\n\"So it's claimed!\" This was a sore point and Beardsley rose to the bait.\n\"It couldn't be that crime was on the down-grade already? I could show\nyou plenty of statistics that--why, I could show you methods--\"\n\n\"I'll just bet you could.\" Arnold gave a thin tolerant smile. \"I refuse\nto enter _that argument_ again, not with you, Beardsley. I for one trust\nin machines not in evolution. I've told you before....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Beardsley found himself sitting there with a flush of heat at his\nhair-roots, half-angry and half foolish as he realized how he had been\nbaited.\n\nJeff Arnold was abruptly all business. He plunged his finger at a\nbutton, spoke into the intercom. \"Joe! How's that test-run coming?\"\n\n\"All-X so far! Give us ten minutes for clearance.\"\n\n\"Take twenty, but make sure it's _clearance_. Checked Quantitative, have\nyou? How about feed-backs? ... yes ... what's that? Semantic circuits!\nHell yes, check _all_ synaptics for clearance! I want no excess data\nfouling up this run!\"\n\nHe clicked off and sat there moodily, and Beardsley watched him, noting\nthe quick nervous rhythm of Arnold's fingers. Arnold noticed it, too,\nand desisted.\n\n\"Look,\" he said. \"Mandleco, Losch, Pederson. Those three Primes just\ndon't make sense to me!\"\n\n\"They don't?\" Beardsley allowed just the proper note of resentment.\n\"Surely you are not questioning Co\u00f6rdinates....\"\n\n\"You know I'm not! But--\"\n\nBeardsley waited, knowing it was coming now. The thing Arnold had been\naching to voice for the past five minutes.\n\n\"But--well, damn it, there is _Mrs._ Carmack, for example. As you\npointed out yourself, she'll be a rich woman now! It would seem to me--\"\n\n\"That she'd be a Prime? I'm surprised at you, Jeff; that's ancient\nthinking.\" If there was a trace of sarcasm, it was lost on Arnold. \"Oh,\nI grant you it used to hold true--principle beneficiary was always prime\nsuspect. Fiction especially was full of it. Queen, Dickson Carr, Boucher\nyou--know the ilk. But with ECAIAC we've gotten away from all that,\nhaven't we?\"\n\nArnold stared at him suspiciously, hesitated, then brought it out with\nan effort. \"Well--how _did_ she equate?\"\n\n\"Who? Oh yes, the beautiful widow. She only made Logical, and even that\nis borderline.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Arnold rose, dialled himself another drink, then changed his\nmind and put it down untouched. He turned to gather up the tapes, and\nhis voice was apologetic.\n\n\"It's not that I'd ever questioned Co\u00f6rdinates Division! We're too\nclosely aligned for that, Raoul....\" (_First time he's ever used my\nfirst name_, thought Beardsley.) \"You have a splendid record to uphold,\nas we do here at Mechanical. That's why ... well, I want to get this off\nas smoothly as possible!\"\n\nSomething indefinable, a queasy feeling, took Beardsley about the\nmiddle. He said sharply: \"Any reason why not?\"\n\n\"No, not really. But in recent weeks--I tell you this in strictest\nconfidence, understand!--in recent weeks it's been a rather ticklish\nthing to get total synaptic clearance.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSynaptics? Beardsley began thinking back to the Crime-Central \"Required\nAnnual Basic.\" The Mechanical had never been his strong point. He said\nuncertainly, \"But--that's serious!\"\n\n\"It's just that we've found ECAIAC holding back excess data from\nprevious runs. Fouls up the relays, takes hours to iron out the\nclearance.\" Arnold gave him a keen look. \"More of a nuisance really,\nbut the weirdest thing. Stubborn!\"\n\n_Stubborn._ Beardsley could have thought of a better word. Through the\npanelled glass he glimpsed the black metal sheathe of the monster out\nthere, the shapeless crouching and malevolent winking lights, and he\nfelt himself going to pieces inside with a sudden shaking crumble; he\nhated himself for it but he couldn't stop it; his hands clenched until\nthe knuckles showed white.\n\n\"... matter of time until we find the cause,\" Arnold was saying, \"but I\nguarantee total clearance _today_. Shall we get on with it?\" Hands\nloaded with tapes, he moved for the door.\n\n\"No!\" Beardsley cried. \"Arnold, if you don't mind, I--\"\n\n\"Oh, for God's sake, not again! Raoul, I swear I'm going to do something\nabout this phobia of yours; it's getting to be not so funny any more.\"\nWith a show of exasperation, Arnold propelled him through the door. \"I\ngive you my absolute word our pet won't snap at you. Not today. It's\ngoing to be far too busy for the likes of you!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnd Jeff Arnold was right, Beardsley discovered. Those baleful overtones\nwere gone, replaced by a sustained soft whisper along the ninety-foot\nhull--a rather impatient whisper but not at all unpleasant. Beardsley\nrelaxed by slow degrees, but kept a cautious distance, while Arnold\npointed out every light along the length flashing green for Total\nClearance.\n\n\"She's rarin' to go,\" said Arnold with a display of good humor, \"but\nwe'll let her wait a while, eh?\" He clapped a friendly arm across\nBeardsley's shoulder. \"You just come along now and watch; I think your\ntrouble is, you've never been properly introduced! We'll have no more of\nthis feudin' and fussin' between you and ECAIAC.\"\n\nSo Beardsley, showing more courage than he felt, trailed the\ncyberneticist through every unit of final check-up. Much of it he knew\nalready from the \"Required Annual Basic\" ... or thought he knew. For\nthis was so different from the Manuals! He felt at once ashamed and awed\nas he viewed at first hand the unfolding schematic structure. He was\nthrilled at sight of the selectors and analyzers of processed beryllium,\nthe logic-and-semantic circuits in complex little bundles, the\nsensitized variant-tapes waiting for transferral impress, all revealed\nby a flick of Arnold's fingers that threw open entire sheathed sections\nto bare the inner secrets. The thousands of tiny transistors amazed\nBeardsley. The endless array of electric eyes startled him. And the\nspongy centers of synaptic cell-clusters horrified him, recalling too\nvividly to mind what he knew of the physical human brain.\n\nAlong the monstrous length he trailed Jeff Arnold; he trailed and he\nwatched and he listened, not interfering once by word or gesture. And\nbefore it was over his heart was surging with a great revelatory beat\nbecause suddenly _he knew_ ... _he knew_....\n\nArnold seemed in high good humor as they paced back. \"So,\" he nudged\nBeardsley in the ribs, \"we'll have no more of this nonsense between you\nand ECAIAC. Eh? You're just _bound_ to be good friends now.\"\n\nBeardsley didn't answer. The revelation was still too much with him. He\nwatched as Arnold conferred with a group of his techs about a\nmicro-chron, and the time was carefully noted for Central Record.\n\nThen the first of the tapes went in. The Basic Invariant--Amos Carmack.\n\nIt reached synapse and a tiny blip registered on cue.\n\nThe rest of the tapes fed in, razoring through the rollers, past the\nselenic-sensitized tips of the relays. There was no progressive order.\nAfter the Basic Invariant progression didn't matter. Possible or Logical\nor Prime, all factors would correlate or cancel; any divergent\nstatus-shift would be duly handled by transferral impress.\n\nBeardsley counted the tapes. Twenty ... twenty-one ... twenty-two.\n\nThe techs dispersed, taking up their various posts where special\neject-tapes clicked out a second-by-second record of the progression.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNothing much happened. The sound of ECAIAC became a steady inundant\ndrone; or did Beardsley just imagine that he detected something of the\n_gleeful_ in it? With an effort he put the thought from him, and keeping\na cautious distance he took a turn around the monster, up one side and\ndown the other.\n\nHe stopped by Jeff Arnold, who was jotting down figures from the chrono.\nThat seemed silly, as nothing had happened yet.\n\nArnold glanced up and grinned at him, as if totally unconcerned that\nthis was the most repercussive case in the entire history of\nCrime-Central! A little disconcerted, Beardsley said, \"What happens\nfirst?\"\n\n\"Oh, plenty is _happening_. But the first you'll notice will be a total\nreject. Watch when that happens. Complete silence, every light red for\nexactly two and a half seconds--the reject, and then everything\ncontinues.\"\n\n\"How about Transferral Impress? You know--possible to Logical, or\nLogical to Prime?\"\n\nArnold paused over his notes for the merest instant. \"Why--it's\nprogressive, of course. _That_ you won't notice!\"\n\nBeardsley stared at him curiously, started to speak and then changed his\nmind. He wandered again, watching the techs but not interfering. And\nsuddenly he was aware that the first total reject had come. It happened\nwith smooth and sudden silence just as Arnold had described, ECAIAC\nbreaking pace for mere seconds ... then all was clear again, and one of\nthe techs hurried down the aisle with the tape, which he handed to\nArnold.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeardsley was aware of a wild pounding of pulse as he stared at the\nanonymous tape. One of the fifteen \"possibles\"? It might even be a\nrejected Logical. Mrs. Carmack? She was borderline. Or a Prime! It could\nbe Mandleco himself--or Losch or Pederson. No ... it was unlikely any\nPrimes would fall this early....\n\nBut maybe they were no longer Primes! Maybe _right now_ Transferral\nImpress was at work, maybe one or more of them was being relegated to\nlower co\u00f6rdinate-status somewhere there in the entrails....\n\nHe felt a bounding excitement. And, as if reading his thoughts, Jeff\nArnold gave him an amused look.\n\n\"Don't let it get to you, Raoul. I used to find it the same; we all do.\nBut then you get to thinking, hell, why try to guess? Identities don't\nmatter now!\" He indicated the coded tape. \"A total reject--anonymous.\nECAIAC's way of telling us _that_ person could not possibly be the\nmurderer.\"\n\n\"But--you're not even curious?\"\n\n\"At rejects? Why?\" Arnold seemed perplexed. \"Oh, you mean because _I'm_\namong the 'possibles.' Frankly it doesn't bother me. I know I'm not the\nmurderer, and I have faith in ECAIAC. If this isn't my tape, the next\nwill be--or the eighth, or the fifteenth.\"\n\nBeardsley nodded slowly. With ECAIAC it was only the final equate that\nmattered, the total result of Cumulative. He saw the truth in that, and\nthe perfection. Or--his eyes beneath the glasses came to a quick bright\nfocus--_was_ it quite perfection? He watched in silence as Arnold\nconsulted the micro-chron and jotted more notes. _Rej. Q-9 (code): (.008\nsynap. circ.): 11:23 A.M._\n\nBeardsley wandered again, watching the techs. A sudden shivering seized\nhim. How could they remain so calm? Were they so close to the forest\nthey couldn't notice? Something was about to happen ... to him it was\nunmistakable, in the very atmosphere, sharpened and heightened by the\nfour walls--a pervading sense of _wrongness_ and a pyramiding tension.\n\nEven Arnold wasn't aware; _audibly_ nothing had changed, as ECAIAC\ncontinued its soft-clicking whisper and the techs methodically checked\nthe progress tapes. Beardsley stood numbly for a moment, struggling\nagainst a welter of panic. Palms sweating, he moved a safe distance away\nand waited.\n\nEight minutes later came another reject. Six minutes later, the third.\nECAIAC continued its blithe, soft-throated rhythm--but Beardsley was not\nfooled.\n\nSomeone sent out for coffee. It arrived in steaming thermo-containers.\nBeardsley was on his first cup of coffee when rejects 4, 5 and 6 came\nthrough.\n\nHe was on his second cup when number 7 ejected, and he had just taken a\nlast swallow when all hell broke loose.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt wasn't much different from the other rejects. Total silence, every\nlight in every section red ... trouble was, they couldn't seem to get\ntogether again. Some went back to green, others blinked with ominous\nuncertainty, still others said \"to hell with it\" and exploded in vicious\nshards of glass that sprayed across the room. That was only the\nbeginning. Twenty feet from Beardsley came a louder explosion, a sort of\nmuffled hissing. He ducked, as a complete bank of transistors zoomed\npast his head. From a dozen places along the ninety-foot length angry\ntrails of smoke poured out. A tech yelled \"Damn!\" as he pulled back a\nburned hand. Sheathes crashed open. Long strands of vari-colored wire\nburst out and began a crazy aimless writhing, accompanied by an ominous\nbuzzing sound as if a swarm of angry metallic bees had escaped. Someone\nwas yelling, \"Master-switch! The master-switch!\"\n\nBeardsley saw Arnold leap to the master-switch, where he became\nentangled with a tech who was screaming at him, \"My God, sir, hurry!\nIt's BREAKDOWN!\"\n\nCursing, Arnold shoved the man aside and pulled the controls.\n\nBut now that it was roused, ECAIAC didn't want to give up so easily.\nThere came a staccato series of minor explosions--defiant gesture,\nthought Beardsley!--before silence engulfed the room together with a\ndrift of acrid smoke.\n\nIt was acrid and _angry_ smoke. From a safe distance Beardsley adjusted\nhis glasses and observed the frantic, scurrying techs, many of them\nnursing burned hands. Aside from a pounding heart he was amazed at his\nown calm; nevertheless, he tread with caution as he approached Arnold,\nwho was on his haunches dolefully surveying the area of major damage.\n\n\"Uh--is it something serious?\"\n\nArnold glared up at him. \"Overload on the feed-backs. If that's _all_ it\nis, we can pull out the unit and replace it in a few hours.\"\n\n\"Never happened before, eh?\"\n\n\"Not like this,\" Arnold groaned. \"Lord--it just seemed to go berserk!\"\n\nBeardsley glanced around nervously. \"You see? You see? I didn't think\nour beautiful friendship could last....\"\n\nArnold snarled, \"Get out, Beardsley! What the hell you doing here\nanyway? Go somewhere and read a book!\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes, I--\" Beardsley swallowed hastily. He then straightened, took\na last look around and pulled himself together. Without a word, he\nturned and strode resolutely into Jeff Arnold's office; he closed the\ndoor carefully, then hurried over to the stat and pushed the button for\npriority.\n\n\"Hello,\" he said. \"Mandleco's office? ... this is Mechanical Division ...\nno, I want _Mandleco_ ... I don't care, get him I said! This is emergency!\nPut him on at once!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMandleco arrived twenty minutes later. The Minister of Justice was tall\nand raw-boned with a long hook-nose, a shock of whitening hair, and more\nthan a suggestion of military arrogance. He paused for precisely one\nsecond in the doorway, then strode straight over to Jeff Arnold. Before\nsaying a word he bent slightly and peered into the maze of mechanism.\n\nBeardsley wanted to say, \"Do you find the cause of the trouble, sir?\"\nBut he held his tongue.\n\nMandleco straightened up, glaring. \"Arnold, what is the meaning of\nthis?\"\n\n\"Breakdown, sir.\"\n\n\"I can see that! The cause, man, the cause!\"\n\n\"I--it's only the feed-back, sir.\" Arnold struggled with the terminals,\nmost of which were a fused and tangled mess. \"Not as bad as it looks, I\nassure you. I've already contacted Maintenance; they're sending up a new\nunit.\"\n\n\"What precisely does that mean? Can you complete the run or not! This\nhas got to go through today!\"\n\nArnold touched a hot terminal, jerked back his hand and swore. \"It will,\nsir. Give us a few hours. We had seven total rejects, so I doubt the\ntapes are at fault. More like a synaptic overload. Transferrals are\nokay, so I want to try it with a stepped-up synaptic check; that'll\nalleviate any overload without drain on the minor selective, which is\nbetter than setting up complete new correlation-grams.\"\n\nIt was too much for Mandleco. Grinding a fist in his palm, he stared\ninto the matrix and muttered, \"Unprecedented. Absolutely unprecedented!\nArnold, I just can't understand _why_--\"\n\n\"Happened pretty suddenly,\" Beardsley intruded. His voice was low and\nladen with meaning. \"Almost as if it had gone berserk! And little\nwonder, if you ask me....\"\n\nMandleco turned quickly. \"Eh? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well ... how would _you_ feel if you had just been handed the news, out\nof the blue, that someone you loved had been brutally murdered? ECAIAC\nreacted, is all. She must have regarded Carmack as a father--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nArnold looked up in amazement. \"Beardsley, will you stop that crazy\nnonsense!\"\n\n\"Nonsense?\" Beardsley appeared hurt. \"Why--you said yourself that you\nwanted me and ECAIAC to become great friends!\" He appealed to Mandleco.\n\"That's what he said, sir, and he even took pains to introduce me and\nall, and--\"\n\n\"It was in the nature of a joke, sir!\" Arnold's voice rose an octave. \"A\nprivate little joke, and he's trying to make it appear--\"\n\n\"Stop it, stop it!\" Mandleco thundered. \"Arnold--you get that new unit\ninstalled on the double! Put your best men on it. That's an order!\nBeardsley, I'm glad you had the presence of mind to contact me.\nCommendable, most commendable.\"\n\nArnold scowled, hit Beardsley with an accusing look.\n\n\"Above all,\" said Mandleco, \"not a word of this must leak! _Damn_ it,\nwhy should this have to happen _now_? Public confidence will be\nundermined if they think ECAIAC is--is--\"\n\n\"Not infallible?\" suggested Beardsley.\n\n\"Exactly. You hear me, Arnold? Not a word of this must get out!\"\n\n\"I'm sure it won't,\" Arnold glared venomously at Beardsley, \"if you'll\njust keep _him_ away from the tele-stats.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Minister of Justice walked away, still muttering something about\npublic confidence and political repercussions. Beardsley kept pace\nbeside him until they were across the room. Then he spoke, timidly at\nfirst.\n\n\"Pardon me, sir, but--I'd like to ask you something.\" His voice was low\nand confidential. \"If you'll just look around you....\"\n\n\"Eh?\" Mandleco followed Beardsley's gesture, and for the first time he\nseemed to see the room in total. Shards of glass lay everywhere. A great\ntangle of wire was strewn half the length of ECAIAC, and a bank of\ntransistors reposed against the far wall in pitiful ruin. The techs had\nalready started a strip-down, their tools and units across the floor\nadding to the general confusion.\n\nMandleco said, \"Well? What is it you--\" His words stopped as if sliced\nin two by his teeth. \"Yes. Yes, by God, I see what you mean!\"\n\n\"Can you really conceive of operation in two hours? _Two hours_,\" Arnold\nsaid. \"Two days, maybe. More likely in two weeks!\"\n\nMandleco groaned as if in pain, staring around.\n\nBeardsley pressed his point. \"You'll pardon my saying it, sir, but I\n_do_ realize what the Carmack Case means--to you personally. So much\nbuild-up and publicity, and the people demanding a verdict ... why, if\nthe case were to snag now--\"\n\n\"Unthinkable!\" A shudder touched Mandleco's long, lean frame. \"Out with\nit, man! What are you trying to say?\"\n\nBeardsley was suddenly sweating. He felt as if a long tube were inside\nof him, hot and throbbing, reaching up with a surge of pulse to his\ntemples. _It had to be now. He had to say it._\n\n\"Well,\" he gulped. \"Just this, sir. I think the case can be cracked\nright now. Today. _Without_ ECAIAC.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! Without ECAIAC? Why, that's--\"\n\n\"Sure. You think it's crazy. But I tell you _I_ can do it!\" Beardsley's\nwords came fast and urgent. \"I've followed this case from the beginning,\nI processed it, I'm familiar with every angle. I tell you, _I can\ndeliver the killer_. Give me permission to try!\"\n\nMandleco stared at Beardsley as if he were some queer specimen under a\nmicroscope; his mouth opened to speak, then he clamped his teeth tightly\nand strode away.\n\nHe turned back abruptly. \"So you think you have the solution. You\nactually--do--think it!\" His eyes narrowed down, no longer amused, as he\nfixed the little serologist with a peculiar gaze. \"Go on, Beardsley.\nYour suggestion at least has the novelty of imagination!\"\n\n\"The novelty of experience,\" Beardsley said bitterly. \"_With your\npermission and co-operation_ I can solve this case, together with\npositive evidence that will hold up in any court! What's more, I'll do\nit today. A guarantee,\" Beardsley said pointedly, \"which I dare say you\nno longer have from ECAIAC.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMandleco stood quite motionless, trying to recall something. \"Now I\nremember! You were with New York Homicide, weren't you, before promotion\nto Co\u00f6rdinates in '60? I recall passing on your record. Top record, too,\nfor those days.\"\n\nBeardsley gestured impatiently. \"How about it, sir? I know every\npertinent fact of this case, plus a few of my own which haven't been\ntested in a dozen years. Not indexes and tubes and tapes--just facts!\nFact and method! Let me apply them!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it's not as simple as that, Beardsley. There _is_ ECAIAC,\nand public confidence must not be allowed--\"\n\n\"The public be damned,\" Beardsley caught himself. \"All right--for\nappearance sake you can say the solution _came_ from ECAIAC. Let ECAIAC\nverify me later if you wish. I'm not after headlines and glory ... by\nheaven, sir, I'm offering you an _out_!\"\n\nMandleco pondered that. He glanced again at the confusion across the\nroom, and realization seemed to hit him. Quite suddenly, then, he threw\nback his head and roared with laughter.\n\n\"An out. And by heaven, Beardsley, I'm offering you a try! The idea\nappeals to me! Beardsley versus ECAIAC ... socio-archaism opposed to the\n_machina-ratiocinatrix_. Why, it's delicious!\" He subsided to a rumble\nof mirth and wiped tears from his eyes. \"So! Just what do you propose?\"\n\nBeardsley saw nothing amusing. \"I propose first, sir, that we reach an\nunderstanding. I'm to conduct the investigation my own way, without\ninterference?\"\n\n\"You have my word! I never violate it.\"\n\n\"Good. Then start using your word right now. There are three persons I\nwant placed in temporary custody; they are to be brought over here at\nonce for questioning.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMandleco looked appalled. \"Questioning? _Here?_\"\n\n\"Yes, right here. Immediately! The three I want are Mrs. Carmack--I\nhappen to know she's still in the city. And Brook Pederson--you should\nreach him easily at Central News Bureau. The third--\"\n\n\"Would that be Professor Losch?\" Mandleco smugly asked. \"Sorry, but\nLosch happens to be in Bermuda right now.\"\n\nBeardsley said sharply: \"How did you know that?\"\n\n\"Why, I--I'm acquainted with Losch, you know. He was planning a\nvacation, and he mentioned Bermuda--\"\n\n\"No. I don't mean that. _How did you know Losch was my third person?_\"\n\nMandleco bristled a little, his face reddening as he groped for an\nanswer. \"Never mind,\" Beardsley waved it aside. \"If Losch is in Bermuda\nat present we'll reach him by tele-stat right now!\" He was suddenly\ncrisp as he propelled the Minister of Justice toward Jeff Arnold's\noffice.\n\nMandleco stared at this little man, wondering if it were the same person\nhe had been talking to just minutes before. \"Now see here, Beardsley--\"\nBut he was interrupted.\n\n\"I thought we had an understanding! Of course, if you'd prefer to count\non ECAIAC--\"\n\n\"Very well,\" Mandleco nodded grimly, \"I gave you my word. But the\ninstant Arnold repairs the breakdown, your little experiment is over! Do\nyou understand that?\"\n\nBeardsley nodded. He understood very well.\n\n\"In the meantime, Beardsley, I warn you. I'll have no brow-beating of\nthese citizens, no--what was it called--third-degreeing tactics! I\nunderstand that sort of thing used to be pretty prevalent.\"\n\nBeardsley snorted, as if that were beneath comment, and closed the\noffice door behind them. Mandleco hit him with a cagey glance. \"The\nLogicals and the Primes, eh? I suppose you know that I happen to be one\nof those Primes.\"\n\nBeardsley looked straight at him. \"Yes, I'm aware of it. My own approach\nwill be individualistic, of course, but I promise you won't be\nover-looked!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt might have been fatal--but Beardsley had judged his man well.\nMandleco took it as a challenge. He was silent as he approached the\ntele-stat, and he no longer seemed amused.\n\nHe put through the directive to have Mrs. Sheila Carmack and Mr. Brook\nPederson brought in. \"As my guests, that is,\" Mandleco told his\noperative. \"_Be sure they understand that._ They are to be brought to\nCrime-Central, Mechanical Division, at once ... yes, I said Mechanical\nDivision! At once means _now_.\"\n\nBeardsley nodded approval. \"And now Professor Losch, please?\"\n\nWithout a waste of motion, Mandleco put through to Bermuda on priority\nbeam. While they waited he gave Beardsley a look of puzzlement and new\nrespect. \"Ah--I'm not implying that it's against protocol, of course,\nbut I assume you've already made some investigation along lines of your\nown?\"\n\n\"Superficial only,\" Beardsley said.\n\n\"I see. Well then, would you mind giving me some ... you know, just an\nidea of how you plan to proceed?\"\n\nBeardsley said bluntly: \"Yes, I would mind.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Mandleco frowned and persisted. \"Psychologic deduction. Wasn't\nthat your _forte_? I seem to recall--\"\n\nBeardsley grunted. \"I'll tell you this much, there are implications\nabout this case that fascinate me!\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Mandleco found himself a chair, sat upon it and edged forward. \"I\ndon't just quite--\"\n\n\"Look. To begin with, the case is unique; so much so that your entire\nstructure of approach is wrong. I mean top-heavy! Top-heavy with\ngadgetry and assumption.\"\n\n\"Assumption?\" Mandleco bristled a little. \"You of all people should know\nbetter. Not _once_ in the past dozen years has ECAIAC failed to arrive\nat a conclusive and pin-point solution based on correlative factors!\"\n\nBeardsley smiled thinly. \"Ah, yes. But we were speaking of the _Carmack_\ncase. I repeat, it's not only unique but untenable; it became untenable\nthe moment you assigned ECAIAC the task of solving the murder of its own\ncreator! That,\" he said grimly, \"is a mistake we wouldn't have made even\nin '60....\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMandleco thought that over, shook his head and frowned. It was obvious\nhe missed the connotation. \"So?\" he urged.\n\n\"So look at the murder itself. The _pattern_. You'll admit it does seem\nodd and misplaced for these times--or hadn't you noticed?\" Beardsley\nleaned forward sharply. \"But it strikes a familiar note with me!\nAbsolutely nothing in the way of material clues; not even the weapon;\nand the _modus operandi_ is one I haven't seen employed in years, the\nold idea of the most direct and simple murder being the safest!\"\n\n\"I--I guess I just don't follow you.\"\n\n\"I mean the _way_ Carmack was struck down. Nothing cute and fancy, no\nfrills or improvisation--just the proverbial blunt instrument, after\nwhich the killer simply walked out of there. Believe me, I know about\nthese things. The very simplicity is the killer's protection. You can\nbet no trace will ever be found of that blunt instrument, and naturally\nhe left no evidence coming or going. But then,\" Beardsley said\nobliquely, \"your so-called 'Survey' men made a horrible botch of the\nscene. In '60 we'd have sent them back to patrolling the freeways!\"\n\nMandleco started to protest, then closed his mouth quickly. \"I see, I\nsee.\"\n\n\"I can understand,\" Beardsley murmured, \"how emphasis on basic\ngroundwork has become minimized. So much reliance on Indexes and\nthalamic-imbalance and chart-sifts! It was only a matter of time until a\ncriminal, a really _clever_ one, saw through the system--and reverted.\"\nHis fingers drummed the chair arm, then he looked up sharply. \"And yet\nof all places, I'd say that Carmack's estate was _least_ ideally\nsituated for this type of murder; you know what I mean? You've been\nthere?\"\n\n\"Well, I--there have been occasions. Yes.\"\n\nBeardsley nodded. \"I refer to Carmack's elaborate system against\ninvasion of his privacy. To put it bluntly, he had enemies, and his\nestate was designed as a refuge against those enemies; electronic\nbarriers pitched at ultra-frequency to respond only to certain neural\nvibrations. Must have taken years of research to come up with that!\"\n\nMandleco shifted impatiently. \"Of course, but look here, Beardsley--\"\n\n\"So it leaves me right where I started, doesn't it? And yet I know this:\nit was no _emotional_ killing. It was all coldly planned. The killer was\nsomeone Carmack trusted enough to have in his home; they were probably\nhaving a quiet little chat together. And then precisely--on a\npredetermined minute--the killer rose from his chair and struck.\"\n\nMandleco lifted his heavy hands and then, as if conscious of them, let\nthem fall limply across the desk. \"But--come now, Beardsley! Psychologic\ndeduction is all very well, but how can you possibly know that?\"\n\nBeardsley gazed calmly at the Minister of Justice. For a moment he said\nnothing. Mandleco seemed more alert than startled, more annoyed than\neither.\n\n\"That,\" said Beardsley softly, \"I am not prepared to tell you.\"\n\nMandleco seemed about to pursue the point, but there came an\ninterruption. Both men turned abruptly as the stat-screen gave its\nwarning blip.\n\n\"Code C-C-Five!\" came the remote voice. \"Bermuda to Washington,\nPriority. This is Priority. C-C-Five ... your party is ready now, sir!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a pool-side scene, with hotel and tropical palms against an\nunbelievable blue sky. Professor Emil Losch loomed on the screen; he was\nin swimming trunks, a small gray man who seemed hard as nails, his lean\ntanned body belying his years.\n\n\"Hello?\" Losch peered sharply and then pulled away, almost upsetting an\nexpensive decanter of liquor on the table beside him. He seemed to\nblanch as he recognized the Minister of Justice. \"Mandleco!\"\n\nThe latter raised a hand in greeting. \"Don't be alarmed, Professor, this\nis not official. Just a social call.\"\n\n\"I want to correct that,\" Beardsley said bluntly as he thrust himself\ninto range. \"Professor Losch, this _is_ official; furthermore, I wish to\nadvise you that this stat is monitor-taped for both vis and audio, and\nthe resulting record is therefore admissible in any Court of Law. Being\nso advised, is there any objection on your part to answering a brief\nseries of questions pertaining to the Carmack Case? I have been duly\nauthorized by George Mandleco, Minister of Justice,\" he added for the\nrecord.\n\nLosch glanced bewilderedly from Beardsley to Mandleco, and seemed to\ntake courage from the latter.\n\n\"Objection?\" he said. \"This is a bit unusual, but ... of course, I have\nno objection.\"\n\n\"Very well. I shall make a series of statements, and give you\nopportunity to refute them either in part or _in toto_. Professor Losch,\nsome years ago you were engaged privately, in magnetronic cybernetic\nresearch along similar lines to those later developed by Amos Carmack.\nShortly thereafter you claimed that Carmack had thwarted you,\nout-maneuvered you, _out-stolen_ you at every turn; I believe those are\npretty much your own words, as revealed by court records--\"\n\n\"Correct! I repeat them now!\"\n\n\"You filed against him, and litigation dragged through the courts for\nseveral years before Carmack finally won out. Shortly thereafter you\ndisappeared; I believe you took up residence in Europe. About a year ago\nyou returned, and was hired as Research Consultant in the laboratories\nof the Carmack Foundation. This is true?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment Losch avoided looking at the screen. It was obvious he was\nconsidering his answer carefully.\n\n\"It's true,\" he said.\n\nBeardsley said quickly, \"It is my understanding that Mr. Mandleco\ninterceded with Carmack on your behalf--\"\n\n\"I protest the last statement!\" Losch's words exploded from the screen.\n\"There was no intercession by anyone!\" His head lifted defiantly. \"Yes,\nI came back. I don't mind admitting I came crawling back. Carmack\noffered me the position and I accepted!\"\n\n\"Quite so. And he offered you a hundred thousand a year, didn't he?\nTwice the salary of any other top man?\"\n\n\"You think that's out of line,\" Losch bristled, \"but he must have\nthought I was worth it--I think you know why! He owed me ten times as\nmuch!\"\n\n\"You must have really hated Carmack,\" murmured Beardsley.\n\nMandleco thrust forward angrily, gesturing. \"Losch, let me caution you\nnot to answer that!\"\n\n\"But I will answer it! Yes, I hated him, but if you think I killed the\nman you're wrong. Sure--I wanted to kill him--I thought about it often\nenough, but I hadn't the courage.\" Losch glared at Beardsley from the\nscreen. \"No doubt my Augment Index will bear it out,\" he said bitterly.\n\"Neuro-thalamic imbalance isn't it called? Pronounced efforts at\nemotional suppression?\"\n\n\"Close enough,\" Beardsley nodded, refusing to be enticed from his query.\n\"And you were in Washington prior to and including the day of the\nmurder. You admit this?\"\n\n\"Of course, of course I admit it!\" Losch sighed wearily and lifted his\nhands. \"Why deny the obvious? I'm resigned to the fact that my Index\nprobably makes me a prize Prime!\"\n\n\"Professor Losch. As a person closely associated with the Carmack\nLaboratories, you must be aware of the--shall we say--elaborate\nprecautions Carmack took to ensure his privacy?\"\n\nLosch sank back slowly, but his eyes couldn't conceal a livening\ninterest. \"I don't know what you mean.\"\n\n\"Then I'll tell you. I refer to the frequency barrier which Carmack\ninstalled within the past year. The 'neuro-vibe' I think he called it.\nThat strikes a note?\"\n\nLosch said sullenly, \"Perhaps! What about it?\"\n\n\"Only this. Assuming the killer was a person Carmack had reason to\nmistrust--or to fear--he had to solve the neuro-vibe in order to gain\naccess. Not many persons could have done that, Losch. But _you_ could\nhave done it.\"\n\nLosch came up out of his chair with a heavy, angry look. \"Now see here,\nyou--\"\n\n\"Which pretty well establishes motive, means and method. You were in\nWashington the day of the murder! And you left for Bermuda the day\nfollowing! Is that substantially correct?\"\n\n\"_Totally_ correct!\" said Losch savagely. \"Now may I ask what the hell\nyou're going to do about it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeardsley observed him for a prolonged second. \"Remember it,\" he\nanswered softly.\n\nLosch opened his mouth to say more, but Beardsley lifted a palm at the\nscreen and smiled benignly. \"Well, sir, I think that about covers it. I\nwant to thank you very much for the record, and--ah--have a nice\nvacation! Goodbye.\"\n\nWith that he clicked off abruptly.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned to face Mandleco, who was struggling between anger and\ndistress as he paced away from the screen and back. He confronted\nBeardsley with a sad and accusing look. \"Now see here, Beardsley! If I'd\nknown your methods were ... don't you think that was all a bit\nhigh-handed?\"\n\n\"What? No, not in the least. Didn't you notice?\"\n\n\"Notice what?\"\n\n\"Losch was an angry man, yes, indeed.\"\n\n\"Angry,\" snapped Mandleco. \"Good reason!\"\n\n\"No,\" Beardsley mused. \"The _wrong_ reason. Murder--at least the type\nwe're concerned with--is a form of release, you know. A killer may\ncommit his deed in anger, but once the thing is accomplished he never\nretains that anger long.\" Beardsley gazed contemplatively at the screen.\n\"You know, I admire that man. I really do. He had the convictions at\nleast, if not the courage.\"\n\nMandleco pounced on that. \"Then you think Losch is innocent?\"\n\n\"I didn't say that!\" Beardsley paused in a strange hesitation; his eyes\nhad gone remote beneath the very thick glasses, and his words came slow\nand isolated. \"But he's part of the record. Yes, it should be quite a\nrecord. In fact, I have a feeling--you know?--that this case is going to\nstand as a _monument_ in the annals of crime....\"\n\nMandleco stared at him, searched for the meaning there and then gave it\nup. _Why had he ever committed himself to this situation anyway? Did\nthis little man really know as much as he pretended, or was he merely\nfumbling around in the dregs of a forgotten past?_ To be sure, Beardsley\nwas a pathetic enough figure; but the man had once been great in his\nfield, and there was something about him even now....\n\nThere was the sudden way Beardsley had of losing his abstracted look,\nthe eyes beneath those ridiculous lenses coming to a sharp bright focus\nwith tiny livening flecks in the gray of the iris; and the way the\nchange lifted his features from mediocrity to the alertness of a\nterrier. It was absurd, it was farcical ... and it was all very\ndisturbing.\n\n\"You told _me_,\" Mandleco said testily, \"that the killer was someone\nCarmack trusted enough to have in his home. Then you bludgeon Losch with\nthe idea it was a person Carmack had reason to fear! It would seem to\nme, Beardsley--\"\n\n\"No, no. I think my words to Losch were _assuming_ the killer was such a\nperson.\" Beardsley looked up brightly, and even through those lenses\nMandleco could see the sharp focus.\n\n\"Just the same, I fail to see what's to be gained by these outlandish\nmethods!\"\n\nBeardsley seemed genuinely surprised. \"But I've gained a great deal\nalready! And don't forget, Mrs. Carmack and Pederson should be here\nsoon.\"\n\n\"_That's_ a prospect I look forward to,\" Mandleco tried to salvage a\nmodicum of humor and failed miserably. He extracted a cigar, clamped his\nteeth upon it, frowned and glanced at his watch. He strode over and\npeered out at the operations room.\n\nBeardsley said innocuously, \"I wouldn't count on ECAIAC just yet.\"\n\nIt was Beardsley's first error. He realized it instantly. The remark\nseemed to trigger something in Mandleco.\n\nThe Minister of Justice turned slowly, rolling the cigar from one corner\nof his mouth to the other. \"But I may,\" he said. \"You know, I just may!\nIt's barely possible, Beardsley, that with some luck we'll be able to\ndispense with your talents!\" He said it with considerable more relish\nthan conviction, and moved for the door. \"I think I'll just see how\nArnold is making out!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nArnold was making out very well, much to Mandleco's delight. No longer\nwas there chaos and confusion. The new feed-back unit had arrived, and\ninstallation was well under way. Blueprints were spread out as a crew of\ntechs worked feverishly at all damage areas.\n\n\"It looks promising,\" Arnold hurried up to greet him. \"Told you I had a\ngood crew here! Look--see this?\" He indicated one of the variant-tapes\nbeing slowly reversed across the relays.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"The number eight reject.\"\n\n\"That what caused the trouble?\"\n\n\"Well ... we think so, but it's problematical. Whether it did or not,\nwe're safe in resuming the run without any shift in the correlation\ntotal.\"\n\nMandleco stared at the number eight. \"Throw it out!\" he snapped.\n\n\"What--what did you say, sir?\"\n\n\"I said throw it out! Get this thing to functioning!\"\n\nArnold was aghast. \"But,\" he gulped, \"we just can't throw out data!\nSure, it was about to be a reject--but everything, even rejects, contain\na factor-balance! You know that, sir.\"\n\nMandleco got control of himself with an effort. \"Yes--yes, of course. I\nknow you're right. But damn it, man, those units cost something like\neighty thousand dollars! Suppose the same breakdown occurs?\"\n\n\"Not a chance of it this time. We'll merely continue with a stepped-up\nsynaptic check. Take longer for Cumulative, perhaps, but absolutely\nfool-proof once we--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a long instant Mandleco stood musing. Then he nodded brusquely. \"All\nright. How long to get going?\"\n\n\"Why, we'll be ready in forty minutes at the most. I told you I had a\ngood crew, sir! Excuse me--\" One of Arnold's techs was motioning to him.\n\"Excuse me,\" Arnold said again, and hurried away to consult with the\nman.\n\n\"Forty minutes!\" Mandleco couldn't believe it. He chortled happily, and\nswung about to greet Beardsley who approached at that moment. \"Hear\nthat, Beardsley? Forty minutes! Excellent man, Arnold. I'm sorry I ever\ndoubted--\"\n\nBeardsley wasn't listening. He stared about at the miracle of\nreconstruction, and there was more of amazement on his face than\ndistress. Adjusting his glasses, he gazed thoughtfully at Jeff Arnold's\nretreating figure.\n\nMandleco was saying, \"Just as well your little experiment didn't go any\nfurther! Dangerous precedent ... don't know what possessed me ... you\nrealize that in the last analysis I'll have to put my faith in ECAIAC!\nNo bad feelings?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" Beardsley pronounced somberly. \"No bad feelings, because I'm\nholding you to your word. ECAIAC hasn't solved your case and it never\nwill.\"\n\nMandleco stood still, open-mouthed. \"What's that? Nonsense! Arnold just\nassured me--\"\n\n\"He assured you of nothing! I'm more convinced than ever now. I'm the\nonly one who can solve this case, and I'm holding you to your word.\"\n\nMandleco seemed undecided whether to laugh or censure. His heavy fingers\nopened and closed aimlessly, as he stared across the room at Arnold and\nback at Beardsley. Finally his teeth snapped together. \"Beardsley,\" he\nchoked--\"I warn you, if this is some sort of trickery--\"\n\nBeardsley shook his head solemnly. \"You'd do well to believe me, sir. I\nwas never more serious.\"\n\n\"So you're determined to go on with it! Very well, Beardsley. You have\nsomething like forty minutes, and believe me you'd better prove\nyourself! May I remind you\"--fraught with meaning, his voice bordered on\nanticipation--\"may I remind you, Beardsley, that already you've given\nsufficient cause for a complete review of your qualifications as\nCo\u00f6rdinator?\"\n\nBeardsley looked at him and smiled. \"Yes, sir. And may I remind _you_,\nsir,\" he nodded toward the far door, \"that your guests have arrived?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMrs. Carmack, Beardsley thought as he watched her, was that rare type of\nwoman who could defy all the current conventions of style and carry it\noff successfully; her type of beauty was unostentatious and yet vibrant.\nShe was dressed impeccably in black and silver, her hair was authentic\nhoney-blonde in a coronet braid, and her face possessed that pure line\nof profile together with the quality of translucence one sees in rare\nporcelain.... Sheila Carmack was thirty-five, and she paid her\nbeauticians that many thousands annually to keep her looking fifteen\nyears younger. Just now she seemed in buoyant good spirits as she\ngreeted Mandleco.\n\nNot so the young man who accompanied her. The escort was a person\nBeardsley had never seen before, quite handsome and quite aware of it,\nwith an impudent world-wisdom centered about his sharp eyes. He turned\nimmediately to Mandleco with a bluster as phony as it was towering:\n\n\"This is an outrage, sir! A damned outrage! On Sheila's behalf I deplore\nthese tactics, and I question your right! Our entire afternoon perfectly\nruined....\"\n\n\"Correction, darling,\" purred Mrs. Carmack. \"You mean our perfect\nafternoon entirely ruined.\" She turned smiling to the Minister of\nJustice. \"You really mustn't mind Victor.\"\n\n\"Hello, Sheila,\" Mandleco greeted her wanly. \"I must apologize for the\ninconvenience, but I assure you--\"\n\n\"Oh, but this is thrilling! I mean really!\" Mrs. Carmack was gazing\nabout ECAIAC's room with considerable more delight than suspicion, and\nBeardsley watching her was thinking: _Thrilling! Can she really mean it?\nShe must surely be aware of ECAIAC's task for today--today of all\ndays...._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe glanced uneasily down the room, and saw that Jeff Arnold was much too\noccupied to have noticed the newcomers. He gestured to Mandleco, who\nfinally took the hint and escorted the visitors into the privacy of the\noffice.\n\nThere Mandleco offered drinks, but the young man named Victor refused\nhis, preferring to maintain his air of injured dignity. Mandleco sighed\nand gave an accusing look at Beardsley. \"I know this is unusual,\" he\napologized to Sheila, \"but I--uh--I _am_ rather hopeful that you may\nfind it entertaining!\" He gave a slight sardonic emphasis to the last\nword. \"If you'll just bear with me until our other guest arrives.\"\n\nVictor had been awaiting his chance. \"Another? _Really!_ We're guests,\nSheila, do you hear that?\" He looked at Mandleco with immense disdain,\ngave a pert tilt of his head and surveyed the room with a grimace of\ndistaste. \"And just how long are we to be detained in this--this--\"\n\nBeardsley's fist itched to splatter those handsome features around a\nlittle. Instead he strode forward, said bluntly: \"That'll do it, sonny!\nWho the hell are you anyway?\"\n\nThe handsome face sneered at him. \"I am Victor d'Arlan! I am a good\nfriend of Sheila's--of the family,\" he corrected. \"We were on our way to\nthe Concert when those--those _impertinent_ men detained us. To think we\nmust forego Perro's Fifth Color-Concerto for Sub-Chromatics in favor of\n_this_!\"\n\nSheila's eyes danced with tolerant amusement. \"Victor, please. This\npromises to be much more exciting; I'm sure Mr. Mandleco knows what he\nis about, and....\" Wide and curious, her gaze went to Beardsley and\nlingered there.\n\nBelatedly, Mandleco made introductions. \"Perhaps I should explain,\" he\ngave an improvident laugh, \"that Mr. Beardsley's role at the moment\nis--ah--a little beyond the ordinary! That is, I--\" He paused\nmiserably, and then was saved for the moment as all eyes turned toward\nthe door.\n\nBrook Pederson had arrived and the attention of everyone was drawn to\nhim.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe effect was startling. The tele-columnist was a tall, dour and\nbushy-browed man who took a perverse sort of pride in the impression he\ngave of shabbiness. He slouched wordlessly into the room, hands thrust\ndeep in the pockets of a makeshift jacket. But there was nothing shabby\nabout the man's perceptive and analytic mind, Beardsley remembered;\ntrue, Pederson had fallen from the heights since the ECAIAC debacle, but\nhis retirement from the limelight was more studied than sullen and could\nonly have been his own choosing. Lately he had emerged again, and with\nall of his old news-sense and political acumen he was making his\npresence felt ... he was a man of considered but lightning mood who,\nwhen asked for an opinion invariably gave an argument.\n\nBeardsley observed him shrewdly. From the depths of his mind came a\nwarning, a restless unease that took root and blossomed into turbulence.\n_This man will bear special watching...._\n\nPederson came on into the room, nodded dourly at Mandleco (no love lost\nthere!) and remained alertly silent; for the merest instant he met\nBeardsley's gaze, and there was a definite challenge and something of\nmockery. _Damn him_, thought Beardsley, _he knows why he's here ... but\nhow could he know? He's aware that he's on the tapes, too--even one of\nthe Primes--and he doesn't give a damn!_\n\nMandleco finished the introductions quickly and took over. It was plain\nthat he wanted to get through with this, but at the same time Beardsley\nsensed that he was no longer _quite_ so sure of Jeff Arnold and ECAIAC ...\nabove all things, Mandleco had to avoid any hint of trouble with ECAIAC.\n\nAnd he managed that with an adroitness that bordered on the cunning.\nAfter some glowing comments on Beardsley's past esteemed record--with\npointed emphasis on the pre-ECAIAC era--he ended with a truly\ninspirational touch:\n\n\"Let us just say, then, that you have been invited here in the interests\nof an experiment which Crime-Central has been contemplating for some\ntime. An inquiry into--ah--certain facets of past investigatory methods.\nCrude as it may seem to you, certain factors may be forthcoming\nhere--psychologic and derivational--which may later be refined, analyzed\nand integrated into the operational function of ECAIAC....\"\n\nBeardsley stared at Mandleco. It was altogether a neat side-step, and he\nalmost admired him for it.\n\n\"Please understand, this is a necessary adjunct to the true development\nof ECAIAC. We shall have here two divergent lines of approach within\nparallel fields. Actually, each of you will be an important co-aide in\nthis experiment! I would like you to cooperate fully with Mr.\nBeardsley's line of approach. Uh--vintage '60,\" he added for their\namusement.\n\nThe reaction was immediate and varied. Victor d'Arlan examined his\nfingernails and registered aristocratic boredom. Pederson slouched up\nagainst the desk, seeming amused at Mandleco's pitch ... but he wasn't\nwatching Mandleco. The gaze he fastened on Beardsley said plainer than\nwords that he was quite aware of the situation.\n\nOnly Sheila Carmack seemed fascinated, as she sat a bit straighter in\nher chair and peered brightly across her drink. It was obvious that she,\nfor one, was taken in.\n\n\"Why, I wouldn't have missed it for the world!\" she sparkled. \"Just\nlike, you know, in those--what did they call them--_whodunits_? It's\nactually thrilling!\"\n\n\"It's archaic!\" d'Arlan sneered.\n\n\"It's heroic,\" said Pederson, his gaze still on the little Co\u00f6rdinator.\n\"Beardsley, I hope you pull it off. I actually do. Always did think you\nwere twice the man ECAIAC is!\"\n\nBeardsley moved forward, not smiling. \"Thanks,\" he said. \"In that case\nyou won't mind if I begin with you.\"\n\n\"With _me_?\" Pederson stared, then laughed suddenly and without mirth.\n\"Skip it, Beardsley! I know your methods, and I can tell you right now\nit won't get you any--\"\n\nBeardsley stopped him. \"Pederson,\" he said, \"as of now we agree on just\none thing. I also think I'm twice the man. The only difference is that\nI'm man enough to _really_ believe it.\" He paused and watched him absorb\nthat. \"It's going to be ECAIAC or vintage '60, Pederson. Your choice!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was at once a rebuff and a challenge. Pederson then straightened up\nslowly, a muscle in his face flinched and then he smiled--with all but\nhis eyes. \"All right,\" he snapped, \"we'll begin with me. I'll fill you\nin plenty! You want to know if I saw Carmack the day of the murder? I\ndid! The louse put through a vis call to me. _Insisted_ I come out and\nsee him--\"\n\n\"Whoa, now just a minute! You wouldn't say this was a friendly visit?\"\n\n\"I'll get to that!\" Pederson's words came fast and clipped. \"You know\nhow I fought the ECAIAC lobby. I fought it long and hard, and when I\nlost it finished me with the public. But I wasn't through! I began\ndigging up every fact I could about Carmack. Took me a few years, but\nworth it. Most of it smelled! Ask Professor Losch, he'll tell you--\"\n\n\"I've already spoken with Losch,\" Beardsley said quietly. \"He managed to\nconvey his sentiments pretty thoroughly.\"\n\n\"Good. Then try talking to _him_,\" Pederson nodded venomously at\n_Mandleco_. \"Ask Mandleco how the great Carmack managed to get those\npatents through.... I can tell you he didn't do it alone! Oh, I've dug\nplenty!\"\n\n\"Why, you--\" Mandleco gave a snort of anger and started forward, but\nBeardsley managed to forestall him. He gazed sternly at the\ntele-columnist.\n\n\"I think we're all aware of your considerable talent for digging,\nPederson. ECAIAC, too,\" he added pointedly, \"for we already have it on\nthe tapes.\"\n\nPederson bristled. \"Sure. Sure, you have it! My past connection, my\nopposition to the lobby, even my digging maybe. But you don't have it\nall! How do you equate _hate_, Beardsley? Is _that_ on your tapes?\"\n\nBeardsley could have told him that it was, indeed, on the tapes. But he\nonly shook his head. \"No,\" he said slowly, \"we don't have it all. Not\nECAIAC nor I nor any of us, and that's the eternal pity of it. But I'd\nlike to try! The sum and the substance, Pederson ... don't you\nunderstand me? Just once before I'm through--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the voice, some secret and subtle thing in the voice that reached\nout and gripped Pederson and bore meaning with it. He stood quite\nmotionless, staring at Beardsley; for a split second his eyes widened,\nthen disbelief gave way to something of comprehension, admiration.\n\n\"Beardsley,\" he said softly. \"You fool. You utter damned fool!\"\n\nOblivious of the others, then, he turned and began to pace. \"All right.\nHere it is. Carmack called me out to see him. He had gotten wind of what\nI was up to, and offered to buy me off.\" Pederson laughed bitterly.\n\"Wasn't even subtle about it! Said he liked my stuff, and would like to\nsee me at the top again where I belonged. Said he could arrange for me\nto step into a top job at Central Telecast. Providing, of course, I\ncould manage to--ah--'forget' certain little items I'd uncovered.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPederson was doing all right. Beardsley gave him his lead.\n\n\"He actually thought it would be that simple! I refused him outright,\nand of course, he couldn't believe it. A man like that--We dropped all\npretense, there were some bitter words--\"\n\nBeardsley said quickly, \"Could you elaborate?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't remember exactly. He went venomous! I suppose there were\nthreats. I told him he hadn't enough money _or_ influence to buy what I\nknew, and that when I had it properly documented I intended to make a\nnational scandal of it.\" Pederson halted abruptly. \"You know, it\noccurred to me later that was a foolhardy thing to say!\"\n\n\"Ah? Why is that?\"\n\n\"Well, I had heard of that safeguard of his--the 'neuro-vibe'--and I\nsuppose there were other things, too. He was a cautious man, a dangerous\nman. But,\" Pederson shrugged, \"he let me into his home readily enough.\"\n\nBeardsley lifted a finger. \"Because he was confident he was going to buy\nyou--wouldn't you say?\"\n\n\"I suppose that's it. Maybe I was lucky to get out of there so easily!\nAnyway I did.\" Pederson stopped pacing, and his gaze bored into\nBeardsley's. \"So now to the big question. Yes, he was alive when I left\nhim. No, I never saw Carmack again. I went straight to my office and\nworked until well past midnight; by the way, I have ample proof of\nthat--\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm sure you do! What were your feelings at this point?\"\n\n\"My feelings? I knew my life was in danger now! Carmack would be out to\nstop me. I don't mind admitting I was ... well, rather relieved, when I\nheard the news.\"\n\n\"Ah-h! And when did you hear it?\"\n\nPederson glared, but his answer was quick. \"Late the next afternoon, of\ncourse! By habit I work late hours and I sleep long.\" With an air of\nfinality he threw a challenging look around. \"I want to congratulate\nwhoever did it, and I don't much care whether the answer comes from you\nor ECAIAC!\"\n\nBeardsley surveyed him solemnly. Pederson had little more than brushed\nthe surface, but it was enough, it served to set the pattern; he could\nhave sworn Pederson was aware of that. He said drily, \"Thanks, Pederson.\nYour story is--very pat.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe turned to the others. Mandleco rather surprised him, seeming not so\nmuch disturbed as he was engrossed deep in thought; as for Mrs. Carmack,\nBeardsley saw that the comedy had gone out of it for her, but she tried\nto keep up the veneer.\n\n\"This is all most interesting!\" she sparkled, placing her glass down\ncarefully and turning to face him. \"Am I to be next, Mr. Beardsley?\nShall I give both the questions and the answers as Mr. Pederson did?\"\n\n\"No, Mrs. Carmack. I'll do that! I took note a moment ago that you\nmentioned the _whodunits_. You must be familiar with them? Say as a\nhobby?\"\n\nIt wasn't at all what she expected. She stood wide-eyed and startled.\n\n\"This is so thrilling, remember. Vintage '60! As the _whodunits_ will\ntell you, one of the prime requisites is an accounting and proof of your\nwhereabouts at the time of the deed! Well?\"\n\nBeardsley's voice was just edged enough to throw her into confusion.\n\"Why, I--\" she faltered. \"You mean that night? I--I--\"\n\n\"What, no alibi? You don't even remember? According to vintage '60 that\ncould mean either complete innocence or extreme cunning; beware the\nsuspect who is clever enough to be ready with no alibi!\"\n\nBeardsley saw her stiffen; there was a change across her face, a\nstruggle beneath the eyes. \"But then,\" he shrugged, \"it has always been\nmy conviction that _motive_ rather than opportunity is the real\nrequisite. On that basis it's plain you couldn't have killed your\nhusband. You loved him! He was only fifty-eight, he only left you a\ndozen million dollars, but you loved him and you were faithful! Anyone\ncan see that after seven weeks you're still all broken up over it!\"\n\nThe veneer was gone now; Sheila Carmack's eyes were vicious pools of\nhate, her mouth a grimace. \"Why, you--you ridiculous little monster!\"\nVictor d'Arlan stepped forward belligerently. \"Say, now look here! This\nis all very--\" Beardsley placed a hand on d'Arlan's chest and shoved,\nand the latter stumbled back with mouth agape. Pederson was gazing at\nBeardsley with delight and admiration, seeming to visualize this little\nman as material for his next tele-column. Mandleco stood transfixed, a\nmonument of agony, twisting a fist into his palm. \"Beardsley, stop it!\nThis ridiculous farce has gone far enough! I warned you about these\ntactics--\"\n\nBeardsley said, \"Shut up!\" and Mandleco stood there with mouth opening\nand closing soundlessly.\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Carmack? Answer me! You loved your husband, didn't you? For\nthe past ten minutes you've heard him maligned; I should think you'd\nwant to protect his very good name!\"\n\n\"Sheila, I must advise you against making _any_ statement of whatever\nnature!\" Mandleco strode for the tele-stat, then turned back and pointed\na trembling finger at Beardsley. \"This man,\" he choked--\"this man is no\nlonger acting in any official capacity for Crime-Central!\"\n\nWith a quick step Pederson got himself between Mandleco and the\ntele-stat; he strolled over to the instrument and leaned against it,\nwith a knowing look at Beardsley.\n\nSheila Carmack tilted her chin in defiance. \"But I _wish_ to answer this\nman. I insist on answering! Loved Amos Carmack? Love him?\" Her voice\nrose a full octave and broke in stridence. \"For the past nine years I\nhave _hated--his--guts_!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a long moment the room was silent. No one moved. Beardsley's thick\nglasses glinted eerily as he peered around at them, from Mandleco to\nSheila to Pederson and back to Mandleco.\n\n\"Well now,\" he said, \"this is remarkable. Most remarkable! Everyone\nhated Carmack. Professor Losch--we know why. Pederson here--he's told us\nwhy. His wife--I think it's obvious. Who else? Surely not you, Mandleco!\nCarmack was a pal of yours! You backed his cause with ECAIAC, you\nlobbied for him, you even stole patents for him.... I wonder what\npersuasion he held over you to bring all that about. Or is _persuasion_\ntoo mild a word? Vintage '60 had a better term for it!\"\n\nSlowly, through the murk of his agitation Mandleco seized a measure of\ncontrol; he gazed at Beardsley out of cold incalculable eyes now hooded\nwith dire intention. \"You're really trying hard, aren't you!\" he grated.\n\"Well, make the most of it, because I guarantee _you_ won't be around,\nnot after the next Annual Basic! Do you understand that--_Mister_\nCo\u00f6rdinator?\"\n\nBut Beardsley was watching Pederson now, whose face took on a sudden\nfebrile gleam. \"Blackmail ... by God, Beardsley, that's it! And I have\nthe proof! Sure, it was Carmack I was after, but I dug out a lot more--\"\nPederson shot a challenging look at the Minister of Justice. \"It goes\nback some years, but I can prove that Amos Carmack had enough on\nMandleco to _finish him politically any time he chose_. You can bet your\nlife Mandleco hated him. Enough to warrant murder!\"\n\nThere was an odd, illogical delight in the way Pederson said it--and\nsomething almost frightening the way Mandleco just stood there in cold\nsilence, gazing at the tele-columnist with a look of boundless regret.\n\nBeardsley said very softly, \"Thanks, Pederson, but I'd suggest you save\nit. It's scarcely pertinent now.\"\n\n\"Not pertinent? But, man, I tell you I have proof! What better motive\nwould you--\"\n\n\"Motive?\" Beardsley hit him with a pitying glance. \"Why, I thought it\nwas obvious. We've progressed beyond _motives_ now.\"\n\nAgain there was an electric silence, and Beardsley let it assimilate. \"I\nhave said,\" he went on, \"that all this is most remarkable. But you know,\nthe _really_ remarkable thing--\" He paused and watched them. Mandleco\ncontinued to grind a fist into his palm; Pederson straightened\nattentively, and d'Arlan, sneery no longer, moved over to stand beside\nSheila Carmack.\n\n\"--the really remarkable thing is this. I am now ready to state,\nunequivocally, that the person who killed Amos Carmack ... _didn't hate\nhim at all_.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA thought was throbbing through the room like the seconds passing. Quick\nand cumulative, almost embodied, it made transition from stunned mind\nto startled mind as Beardsley stood there blinking at them. Beardsley\nreally didn't mind; they just couldn't know how subtly he worked into\nhis themes! Taking advantage of the lull, he went over to the door and\npeered out into the Operations Room.\n\nHe peered long and soberly, then turned. Mandleco had found his voice\nfirst, perplexity pushing down his anger: \"Beardsley, either you're\nbereft of your senses or--Do you mean to say,\" he choked--\"after going\nto these preposterous lengths do you mean to say that no one _here_--\"\n\n\"Just a moment!\" To everyone's surprise it was d'Arlan who broke in.\n\"I'm not sure what's going on here, not sure at all, but I want to make\none thing quite clear. _Sheila_ had no complicity in this crime! I know,\nbecause--\" He hesitated, touched her gently on the arm. \"Sorry, darling,\nI've got to say it. I know because she was with _me_ that night.\"\n\nSheila was startled for a moment, then utterly scathing. \"You needn't\nlie for me, Victor! I appreciate your sense of the dramatic, and even\nyour motives, but I assure you they are both misplaced. I have never\nheard such nonsense!\"\n\nd'Arlan looked more desolate than abashed. As for Beardsley, he was only\na little amused. \"Well, now, this is really more than I deserve; in all\nmy years on Homicide I wanted to experience this, but I finally put it\ndown as a myth. The Noble Alibi!\" He peered sharply. \"True vintage,\nright out of the _whodunits_--wouldn't you agree, Mrs. Carmack?\"\n\nThe answer didn't come, and Beardsley went on sternly: \"And you reject\nhis noble attempt on your behalf. That is interesting! Especially, as it\noccurs to me that d'Arlan's effort is just a little delayed....\" He\npaused, gazing thoughtfully upward. \"It's enough to make one wonder\nwhether his noble effort is designed to protect you--or himself!\"\n\nd'Arlan suddenly paled, as if he had just been kicked in the stomach. He\ngulped heavily and tried to speak. Beardsley watched stolidly for a\nmoment, then dismissed him with a gesture of complete disgust. \"Oh,\nhell, never mind! I would say neither. The lady is right, sonny, you'd\nbetter watch those impulses. You just aren't the type!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMandleco had been hanging onto every word, grimly intent; he was sure\nBeardsley was getting somewhere at last. Now he straightened, and his\ngrinding fist indicated that he'd had quite enough. Without a word,\nwithout even a deigning glance at Beardsley, he traversed the office\nwith great purposeful strides and slammed through the outer door into\nECAIAC's room--\n\nAnd was back an instant later, trailing Jeff Arnold as the latter\nbrushed past him into the office. Mandleco was saying something\nurgently, tugging at Arnold's arm. Arnold ignored him. His startled gaze\nwas on the little group.\n\n\"Sheila!\" He took a step forward. \"Sheila, what are _you_ doing here?\"\n\n\"I wish you'd tell me, Jeff. I wish _someone_ would explain what this is\nall about....\"\n\nBeardsley watched the tableau in silence. Jeff Arnold's gaze flicked to\nd'Arlan, who stared back with insolence, and there was no mistaking the\nhostility that leaped between the two.\n\nSheila noticed it, too, and there was an indecisive moment that mounted\ntoward panic. Beardsley watched her churning effort to control it. She\nsaid quickly, an inflection of fear in her voice: \"Mr. Beardsley, if it\n_really_ matters--my whereabouts that night--you'll understand my\nreluctance to say it before! I was with Jeff. Truly! I'm sure he will\ntell you--\"\n\nThe words were directed at Beardsley, but she was talking to Jeff\nArnold. And deliberately, almost brutally, Arnold refused to accept the\ncue. Beardsley saw the pleading turn to apprehension in Sheila's eyes.\n\n\"But, Jeff, you remember! Surely you do! Jeff, you don't understand--you\nmust tell them--\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nArnold looked at her for a single comprehending instant, a pitying\ninstant, then his lips compressed tightly as he turned away.\n\nThere was finality in it. Sheila's eyes were stark and unbelieving. She\nstood there without motion, without a word, her mind groping in a shock\nof blindness.\n\nBeardsley said gently, \"It's all right, Mrs. Carmack. It's really all\nright. Merely an experiment, an inquiry into comparative methods as\nMandleco said. I'm truly sorry if my methods seemed harsh, but\"--he\nshrugged--\"I dare say my participation is over now.\"\n\n\"You're damned right you may say it, Beardsley!\" Arnold's eyes raked him\nwith venom, but he controlled himself and turned to Mandleco. \"I only\ncame to tell you, sir, that we have ECAIAC ready. We'll be reaching\nCumulative very shortly now.\"\n\n\"Jeff ... are you _sure_?\"\n\n\"Quite sure! Depend on it, there'll be no more trouble.\"\n\nMore than relief took hold of Mandleco; it was transformation, it was as\nif a spell had been snapped. He glanced once about the room, and\nshuddered as his gaze encountered Beardsley.\n\n\"Uh--yes. Fine!\" he said. \"That's fine, Jeff! Shall we proceed?\" He\nstrode through the door, pausing only to fling back scathingly: \"That\nis, if Mr. Beardsley is quite sure it meets with _his_ approval!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nECAIAC was in finest fettle again as the tapes sped through. Circuits\nwere activated. Codes gave meaning. Synaptic cells summed and\nintegrated, cancelled and compared and with saucy assurance sent the\nfindings on toward Cumulative. The murmur was soft and sustained and\nsomehow apologetic, as if ECAIAC were quite aware that she had failed in\nher duty but would be just pleased to make amends _this_ time.\n\nSo like a woman ... fractious, unfathomable, then fawning and\nattrite--with a purpose! Beardsley cocked his head and listened, his\nmien almost beatific. Purpose? This creature had none that could quite\nmatch his! He was convinced of it now, and he had never been more happy\nor self-assured.\n\nIt was Pederson who was distressed, as he paced with long nervous\nstrides and watched the equate-panel where the mathematics were made\nvisible in a pattern of constantly changing lights. It had meaning only\nfor the techs, but Pederson couldn't seem to take his eyes from it. At\nlast he came over to Beardsley and managed to steer him aside.\n\n\"Beardsley, I just don't get it! This whole thing--are you quite sure--\"\n\nBeardsley blinked at him. \"Sure of what, Pederson?\"\n\n\"Of what you're doing! Damn it, man, don't tell me that was all waste\neffort in there! Look--I know what this means, and I'm with you all the\nway. If only you could beat ECAIAC, I'll give it all the publicity it\ncan bear! Who knows--\"\n\nBeardsley looked at him blankly, and Pederson gave a snort and a\ngesture. \"All right! I guess I'm wrong. For a while there I actually\nthought you had it.\" Pederson surveyed him shrewdly. \"Just the same,\nthat bit you exploded--about the person who killed Carmack didn't hate\nhim at all--you meant that, Beardsley!\"\n\n\"That's right, I meant it.\"\n\n\"My choice is Jeff Arnold.\"\n\n\"Ah? Now why do you say that?\"\n\n\"The way you built up to it, that's why. And you got your result! Sheila\nCarmack's in love with Arnold, and she tried to cover up for him ...\nsure, that's it! It's obvious! She thinks he's the killer, either thinks\nor knows it--\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. The obvious,\" Beardsley said with a grimace. \"But you know, I\nlearned a long time ago that the _obvious_ can be a mighty tricky thing.\nA dangerous thing. The forceps of the mind are greedy, and inclined to\ncrush a little in the seizing....\"\n\nPederson pondered that. \"And you,\" he said slowly, \"are not seizing. I\ntake that to mean you still have an angle!\"\n\nBeardsley didn't answer at once. He glanced over at the equate-panel, at\nthe flux of dancing lights. Mandleco was bright-eyed and attentive,\nchomping on the stub of a cigar, head thrust forward as he listened to\nsome detail of Arnold's. Sheila stood miserably near by, still in a\nblind shock of disbelief; it was as if she had a need to be close to\nArnold, and he felt it, too, but they dared not look at each other.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now let's suppose,\" said Beardsley, \"just suppose that Arnold thinks\n_Sheila_ is the killer. Eh? Let us say they _suspect each other_.\nNaturally, each has disclaimed any part of the deed. But the suspicion\nis there, that tiny seed; and suspicion, particularly where love is\ninvolved, has a habit of taking root and giving growth. Neither can be\n_totally_ sure of the other's innocence--eh?\" He paused, peering up at\nPederson. \"And Arnold would want to protect her from any possible\nconsequence. Now what would be his way of doing that? The only way he\nknew?\"\n\nHe saw the idea take hold. Pederson was staring at the equate-panel with\nan odd look of excitement.\n\n\"Total reject,\" he gasped. \"By God, if he should try _that_--to equate\nher from Logical into reject--\" He gestured helplessly. \"No, it isn't\npossible. Those tapes are coded! There's no way of tampering--\" Pederson\nstopped abruptly, as a great light dawned. \"Wait a minute, though. It\nneedn't be the tapes! One thing I've always wondered--_would_ it be\npossible to negate a given factor beyond all reach of empirical\nco\u00f6rdinates? You know, through operational technique or setup--\"\n\nBeardsley peered at him. \"I'd say anything was possible,\" he urged,\n\"given time and incentive.\"\n\nPederson bobbed his head in facile agreement. \"By God, you're right! For\nexample, I've always thought there wasn't sufficient control on\nCumulative! You can bet your life Arnold would know ... results at that\npoint _could_ be juggled a little, say if the extrapolations were\njust--\"\n\nThe forceps, the forceps of the mind. Already Pederson was reaching out\nto seize and to crush; the man was a fool after all! Beardsley felt a\nburgeoning disgust, but there was something more, a throbbing,\nchest-filling sensation that he strove to hold rigidly in leash. He said\nquickly: \"Come to think of it, Arnold did mention that he was here most\nof last night, working on setup.\"\n\nHe watched Pederson absorb that, too; he saw the excitement grow.\n\"Beardsley, if you are _sure_--if you could prove that Arnold managed a\nthing like that--\"\n\nThey were interrupted by the sudden quiet that engulfed the room. It was\nso total as to be frightening. CUMULATIVE--CUMULATIVE--CUMULATIVE. For\nhalf-a-minute all operation ceased, as the words flashed bright across\nthe panel.\n\nBut the techs had been waiting. It was a mere respite. Swiftly, they\nchecked their respective units against Cumulative Code, and at the end\nof thirty seconds every light went green for total clearance as ECAIAC's\ndeep-throated power resumed.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeardsley had been waiting too. \"Cumulative!\" he breathed. He let his\nbreath out slowly, and made a sweeping gesture that seemed to encompass\nall the latent delight, all the unleashed joy of his being.\n\nHe was aware of Pederson again, a voice in panic: \"Beardsley! Don't you\nknow what it means? If there's been an imbalance, it has passed through!\nIt will reach final equate!\"\n\n\"That's right, it's entirely in ECAIAC's lap. You wouldn't want to\ndeprive her of the chance, now would you?\"\n\n\"But--but what are you going to _do_?\"\n\n\"Me? I'm going to watch. I'm going to watch one of the epic events of\nour time--\" For a moment Beardsley was solemn, almost shocked, as a\nthought struck him. \"In a way it will be sad. Yes, it will! ECAIAC is\nabout to lose her first case.\"\n\nNow that was strange. Why should he have said such a thing? _Why ... now\nthat the game was over which had had to be played, and he felt the\nbitter-sweet surge of victory that lay throbbing at his grasp!_ About to\nlose her first case....\n\nHe shrugged in remote annoyance and strode away from Pederson. It would\nbe fast now! Already the rejects were falling, the irrelevants, as\nECAIAC with blithe unconcern brought the final equate toward conclusion.\nHe observed Jeff Arnold, standing silent and alert but so devoid of all\nemotion that somehow it wasn't real ... and Mandleco, half crouched,\nteeth gnawing away at the cigar, his heavy face rapacious and eager as\nhe awaited the final tape; that was all that mattered now; the\nMATHEMATICS would register, CODE would add synaptic approval, and proof\nindisputable would be on that tape in clean translated print--the name\nof Carmack's killer.\n\nIndisputable? Bowing his head, Beardsley smiled, and listened to the\nsmooth rhythmic control. Nothing sinister now! No snapping malevolence!\nAll those other times ... his unreasoning panic, the askance remarks\nfrom Arnold, the humiliation ... the very thought of it now was gibing\nand obscene. How could he ever have been caught up in such a thrall of\nterror?\n\nIt wasn't terror he felt now. Something.... His smile turned to a giggle\nas he felt a sudden compelling impulse to pat ECAIAC on the head!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNow how would one do THAT? Never mind. Never mind, never mind, never\nagain are you going to snap at _me_, Ekky. We were introduced, remember?\nWe're really great friends now.\n\nFor a moment Beardsley was suspended in astonishment, aware that he had\nalmost crooned the thought. He glanced around in embarrassment--\n\nPederson was watching him. Pederson was at his side again, perplexed and\nfrowning. \"Beardsley--this business of Sheila and Arnold. It wouldn't\nhappen that way, it couldn't! There's another answer, there's _got_ to\nbe--\"\n\nBeardsley stood unmoving, oblivious. Almost, he seemed suspended in\nanother dimension; almost, he caught the quivering of a mind but could\nnot separate it from the sudden tremor that rose in his own....\n\nHe couldn't avoid it. It came unbidden, it battered through his reason,\nit towered there and blotted out his thoughts until all that was left\nwas a tremulous regret, an attrite compassion.\n\nAbout to lose her first case ... _but one loses! And one survives it,\nyou know, one survives it! For twelve years now...._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMore than a tremor now. More than compassion now. A sense of betrayal\nalmost, illogical and nameless and yet palpable as the scent of fear.\nThere was a pulse of red darkness in Beardsley's brain as all the mental\nand emotional equations of his being sang a sharp alarm. For subtly,\never so subtly ECAIAC's deep-throated tone had changed ... nothing like\nthose other times, rather it was a halting stutter of puzzlement,\nerratic and querulous, with overtones of immediacy as if some formless\npresence were on the verge of unleashing.\n\nBeardsley looked down at his hands, and they were trembling. He could\nnot stop the trembling. A tightness took him about the heart, and behind\nhis eyes that pulse of red darkness presaged the beginning of a violent\nheadache.\n\nEven the others noticed it now, something amiss. Jeff Arnold especially.\nHe looked up in quick alarm at the equate-panel where the mathematics\nseemed to have gone a little fitful, a little frantic, with stuttery\nlapses in progression as if ECAIAC were unable or unwilling to confront.\n\nThe flux of pattern dimmed, then hesitated; blanked out and heroically\nbegan anew.\n\nIt happened suddenly, then. It happened as the techs came crowding\naround. There came a quivering, a sort of shudder, and ECAIAC subsided\nwith a final weary gasp. It was for all the world as if she were saying,\n\"This is it, boys. I've had it!\"\n\nBut it was there, it was there! All at once every symbol was constant,\nstatic and livid upon the screen, enhanced by the words\nEQUATE--COMPLETE--EQUATE--COMPLETE. In that moment every tech in the\nroom must have felt a touch of pride.\n\nA click, a whirr, and it was done. The fateful tape ejected.\n\nBoth Mandleco and Arnold leaped for it, but Arnold was there first. He\nripped the tape clear and then paused, hand outflung, as if he could not\nresist this final bit of drama.\n\n\"Well? Well, Arnold?\" Mandleco was hopping ludicrously about in an agony\nof impatience.\n\nArnold nodded. He brought the tape to his scrutiny. His mouth opened,\nthen shut again as a shudder seized him. Once more he read it, a look of\nwild disbelief on his face ... he staggered, and seemed about to cry or\ngo hysterical or both.\n\nMandleco gave a snort as he pounced, recovered the tape and with blunt\nassurance read the words aloud:\n\n\"SOLUTION : UNTENABLE : SOLUTION : UNTENABLE : SUB-CIRCUIT REFERRAL :\nELLERY SHERLOCK : SUB-CIRCUIT REFERRAL: ELLERY SHERLOCK--\"\n\nHe sounded like a well-grooved parrot. Mandleco turned east, then south,\nthen south-by-east, like a compass on a binge; he looked as if he wanted\nto roar, but his voice came out as a frantic bleat: \"Why, this is crazy!\nGoddam it, it's crazy! Do you realize what this will--\" He confronted\nArnold wildly. \"What the hell does it MEAN, I say! Untenable? And who\nthe hell is _Ellery Sherlock...!_\"\n\nHe got no response; Jeff Arnold was oblivious to the moment, a man\nutterly defeated, beyond solace or action or answer ... but already a\nfew of his techs were huddled about the panel, consulting, viewing the\nEquate Constant and frantically taking notes. Mandleco shoved his way\nthrough them. \"I demand to know the meaning of this!\" he yelped.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was Sheila Carmack who answered, her voice on the high edge of\nhysteria. \"_Meaning?_ I think it might mean,\" she said, \"that ECAIAC has\nalso had a recent indulgence for the _whodunits_. But with a smattering\nof confusion, wouldn't you say? Or would you say a distortion of the\ndetectival? Perhaps a disenchantment,\" she murmured ... this was too\nabsurd, too delicious. \"Ellery Sherlock!\" she choked, and the thought of\nit seemed to break her up.\n\nIn the general hysteria they paid no heed to Raoul Beardsley. He had\nregained his composure, and far down in his eyes something leaped into\nrapt expression; he adjusted his glasses and peered around cautiously,\nbeaming. He beamed at them all, and had to suppress an inane glee....\n\nNot glee as he observed Pederson, who stood there scowling into space\nas though at some incredible absurdity. Suddenly Pederson straightened,\nand there was something strangely different ... his gaze as it met\nBeardsley's was neither shocked nor accusing but held an expression of\nboundless sadness.\n\n_So Pederson knew. At last the poor fellow had found that other\nanswer...._ Beardsley had been expecting it. He could almost sense the\nman's thoughts going to and fro, like a shuttle, weaving all the facts\ninto fabric....\n\nAnd Pederson's voice, ineffably sad now, regretful now: \"So I was right\nthe first time. The tapes. It _was_ the tapes. But even without that I\nought to have known! The answer was there, you handed it to us, but it\nwas like looking straight into the sun--\"\n\nHe paused. Did he expect Beardsley to say something? Beardsley looked up\nat him and blinked.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"_Motives_,\" Pederson said accusingly. \"There was your theme from the\nfirst! You were relentless, you pursued it to perfection, you laid our\nmotives bare and you beat them raw, each and every one. Oh, I grant you\nit was masterful! It was the Beardsley of old! You managed to keep us\noff balance every moment--\" He wet his lips. \"What was it, Beardsley? A\ncompulsion, some grotesque need to squeeze us all down to microscopic\nsize first? Oh, you enjoyed doing that! I watched you. You enjoyed it in\na way that--\" He shook his head, glanced sorrowfully at the\nequate-panel. \"And this ... was it all for this? An achievement--an\nabsurdity. Ellery Sherlock!\" he said with a shudder. \"In Heaven's name,\nWHY? You didn't really expect to carry it off? No, don't answer! It's\nnot important now--\"\n\nBeardsley shrugged in remote annoyance. Must the man use such puerile\nmethods?\n\n\"Not important,\" Pederson repeated, and stood caught in a startled\nwonderment. \"Because you see, Beardsley, I just happen to remember\nsomething from the _whodunits_! That surprises you? So long ago, I can't\nquite recall who said it; but it was a rather good exposition of logic,\nsomething to the effect that when you've exhausted the possible, all the\npossible--that which remains--_no matter how impossible it may\nseem_--must be the truth!\"\n\nHis head lifted; his gaze bored into Beardsley's and his voice was\ntight with meaning. \"And I'd say we have come full circle, wouldn't you?\nYou will have to admit, you did a _real good job of eliminating_!\"\n\nBeardsley managed to smile, even as his mind jarred a little. Even as he\nmet Pederson's gaze and saw the compassion there, the acceptance there,\nthe understanding and boundless regret. For a split second something\nleaped unspoken between them, as if doors in both their minds had opened\nand closed again.\n\nHe turned away wordlessly. Close as Pederson had come, even he was an\nirrelevance now. _But ECAIAC didn't_ know. Poor Ekky! Her first real\nfailure, a fiasco--she really deserved a better fate. Beardsley's heart\nwent out to her, as he observed Arnold in his defeat and Mandleco in his\nfrustration and the huddle of techs in their futile efforts.\n\nSuddenly then--\"Code!\" he heard one of them say, gesturing excitedly.\n\"Post-subjective synapse!\" another tech yelled, and there was a sudden\nscurry of activity about the screen. Without warning or appreciable\nreason those symbols had begun to shift ... wild and elusive, ghost\npatterns without semblance or sense, but so unmistakable that even Jeff\nArnold was jarred alert; Arnold stared, then suddenly was white as chalk\nas he ploughed into the midst of his techs.\n\nBeardsley stood frozen, a fatuous smile about his lips; there was only\nsilence now, a silence that had a pulse in it--the beating of his heart.\nSeconds only ... suddenly there was another pulse, from another heart.\nECAIAC wasn't quite finished! Unerring and resolute the sound came up,\nslowly at first and then faster, gathering strength into a steady drone\nas if every synapse were dredging, dredging deep into the sensitized\nstructure ... and even before the panel attained flux again, a tech was\nwaving his notes and yelling, \"It's true! Post-subjective synapse!\nUnbelievable ... Jeff, we now have a Constant!\"\n\nBut ECAIAC was telling them that. The sound went on, and on, wild and\nlone and constant, ascending to the confines of the room, transcending\nthe confines of reason. It was crescendo incarnate; it was purpose gone\nrife; it was human and more than human, with all the fears and hopes and\nhates, as it attained a high-pitched scream with wailing overtones such\nas even Arnold had never heard. There was sentience in it, there was\nawareness in it, there was fury in it and who could say if there was\ngrief...? There might have been.\n\nOnly Beardsley knew. He felt suddenly packed in ice, from his lips to\nthe pit of his belly; he revolved slowly away, took a few steps and\ncaught the edge of the panel. His whole body began to shake\nuncontrollably and his lips moved in a soundless whisper that seemed to\nsay, \"No, no ... don't you understand? ... we're friends now!\"\n\nBut no one heard; no one would have understood. Arnold handled the tape\nas it came looping out. The words fell slowly at first, then faster and\nfaster in constant repeat: CANCEL LAST EQUATE--SOLUTION TENABLE--CANCEL\nLAST EQUATE--SOLUTION TENABLE--\n\nAnother word came, a single word. Arnold stiffened. One of the techs was\nso indiscreet as to exclaim: \"_Murderer?_ Where did it pick up that\nword! 'Final Equate' is proper....\"\n\nA space, a whirr, and the rest of it came in a clicking rush against the\nhigh-pitched scream: MURDERER--RAOUL BEARDSLEY--MURDERER--RAOUL\nBEARDSLEY--MURDERER--RAOUL--MURDERER--MURDERER--incessant, untiring.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was no trial. Trial presupposes a modicum of doubt, and Beardsley\ndispelled that readily enough. Once more the pathetic figure, it was as\nif he were impelled by a dull and pitiless logic; he waived all defense;\nhis confession to the murder of Amos Carmack was straightforward and\nfactual, unvarying to the point of boredom, insistent with\nrepetition--and in the socio-legal aspect there was the rub! Whether it\nwas true psychic shock or mere cunning, there seemed to be a blind spot\nin Beardsley's responses, a stumbling reticence to elaborative detail\nthat left the Citizen's Disposition Council with a problem on its hands\nbaffling as it was unprecedented. Judicially they were safe. There would\nnot even be need of null-censor. But actually, the problem here was of\nfar more vital consequence than murder and indeed more frightening; it\nhad to do with Beardsley _vs._ ECAIAC, the encompassing _modus operendi_\nand all the implications of that grotesque denouement.\n\nAt whatever cost, _these things had to be answered_.\n\nOh, there was amusement, too. The fact that Minister-of-Justice\nMandleco had begged off, far from gracefully, and retired to the\nisolation of his ten-thousand-acre Alaskan ranch (for an unspecified\ntime) had brought snickers from those in the know.\n\nThe Chief-Counselor of Disposition looked as if he'd like to retire,\ntoo. For the third time in as many days he took his place in the Private\nSessions chamber, glanced at Beardsley with shuddering disbelief and\nthen bent his head in pontifical guise as he leafed through his notes;\nit wasn't as if he were unversed in the matter by now, but who was there\nto question if his lips moved fretfully across the words \"Ellery\nSherlock?\" He was thinking: _yesterday wasted--covert regression, myself\nincluded--no more of that_! And with that bolstering thought he brought\nhis head up sharply.\n\nCOUNSELOR: Our task for today--(_voice quavering, he saved it from the\nupper registers_). Our task for today is to get at the aggregate\npattern. And I assure you, gentlemen, we are going to do that! Now. Mr.\nPederson, if you please....\n\nPEDERSON: Yes, sir?\n\nCOUNSELOR: I see that Mr. Beardsley made certain statements to you, and\nto you alone, immediately after the--uh--ECAIAC incident--\n\nPEDERSON: You saw that three days ago! Must we go through it again?\n\nCOUNSELOR: We must and we shall! Due to the unnatural tenor of the case,\nit is the opinion of the Council that these things must be fixed and\nadjudged if we are to make a correct Disposition.\n\nPEDERSON: (_wearily_): Yes, sir. Well, the fact is he seemed to want to\nconfide in me. Nothing strange in that! He realized he had lost, poor\nguy, and he--\n\nCOUNSELOR: Mr. Pederson! No diversions, please. We'd simply like to hear\nfrom your own lips what Beardsley told you. (Glances at his notes.) Is\nit true that he said--his sole motive in this affair was to prove he\ncould conduct an investigation as efficiently as ECAIAC--_or any damned\nmachine_?\n\nPEDERSON: (_hesitant, with a glance at Beardsley who sat remote and\nvacuous_): Yes. He told me that.\n\nCOUNSELOR: Even to the point of committing a murder to prove it? And his\nentire subsequent action was predicated upon that? We have extensive\nreports here--from Mrs. Carmack, from Mandleco, from Jeff Arnold and\nyourself. It is difficult to see how such a basically integrated and\nwell-functioning personality as Raoul Beardsley--\n\nPEDERSON: (_angrily_): No. What you fail to see is the facade! What man\nhas stronger reason than the man who has lost his reason? It is the only\noutlet for aggression, a devious fulfillment, it brings psychological\nsatisfactions which cannot be obtained in any other way--call it the\nself-destructive impulse if you will. I doubt if Beardsley rationalized\nthis--but he had come to his moment, his time of assertion, his way of\nmaking fools of us all ... and my complete opinion, sir, is that his\nactions from beginning to end were both a triumph and an inspiration!\n\nCOUNSELOR: (_smugly_): Thank you, Mr. Pederson. These are the insights\nyou had not revealed before. (_Turns to member at far end of table._)\nDr. Deobler. As psychologist assigned to Disposition Council, may I ask\nif there is an area of concurrence?\n\nDEOBLER (_bored, but deigns to lift a hand_): Save for the rhetorics at\nthe very end, you have my official concurrence; it is obvious in every\naspect; this was a devious fulfillment of the self-destructive impulse.\n\nCOUNSELOR: Thank you, sir! It will be so noted. And now--(_Makes a\npretense of scanning his brief._) Now we come to an area of vital\ninterest--an area demanding our most urgent attention, inasmuch as it\ngives indication of threatening our basic fundamental of cybernetic\ndetection; believe me, I cannot place enough emphasis here; I refer, of\ncourse, to Mr. Beardsley's process of manipulation of ECAIAC, and this\nstrange business of \"Ellery Sherlock.\" (_Pause._) Mr. Jeff Arnold, if\nyou please. I believe you were to be ready with some observations today?\n\nARNOLD: Yes, sir. But more than observation, I am glad to report. We\nhave _solved_ the \"Ellery Sherlock\" equate.\n\nCOUNSELOR: This is wonderful! Will you proceed, sir?\n\nARNOLD: A strange thing ... and yet so simple! We began by resurrecting\na huge number of \"Summaries\"; we dredged into Dead File for at least\nthree years back, re-ran them under a synapse intensifier. It's all\nthere, you know, every minute particle of every case that has gone\nthrough ECAIAC; almost subliminal, some of it, but--\n\nCOUNSELOR: One moment, sir. This reference to \"synapse.\" Could\nyou--ah--clarify?\n\nARNOLD: Why, a synapse is the primary adjunct to memory! The human brain\nhas billions of them, neuronically linked--sort of pathways that get\ngrooved deeper and deeper with constant repetition of thought, until\nafter a while they become completely permanent, retentive and\nself-functioning. ECAIAC is similarly equipped--not to the degree of the\nhuman brain, as yet, but amazingly.\n\nCOUNSELOR (_dazed_): Ah--yes. Please continue, sir.\n\nARNOLD: As I said, we revived a number of the old cases. And what we\ndiscovered, was that Beardsley--for years past, mind you--had been\nutilizing his capacity as Chief of Co\u00f6rdinates to introduce extraneous\nmaterial to ECAIAC _via_ the tapes! In each and every case that came\nbefore him! Oh, you can believe me, he was clever, he went about it by\nslow and subtle degrees! And the substance of this material,\nsir--(_Pauses, gulps and shakes his head, unable to go on._)\n\nCOUNSELOR: Please control yourself, sir! The substance of this\nextraneous material?\n\nARNOLD (_again gulps_): De-detective fiction!\n\nCOUNSELOR (_leans forward sharply_): Do I understand you correctly, Mr.\nArnold? You did say _detective fiction_?\n\nARNOLD: Of two types. Ellery Queen and Sherlock Holmes--I presume it was\nBeardsley's random choice. But there was nothing random about his\npurpose! Don't you see, don't you see, it all fits! It explains the\ntrouble we were having in recent months in getting total synaptic\nclearance! (_His voice borders on the frantic._) I remember, now, I even\nmentioned this to Beardsley--and oh, the smug way he took it. He knew,\ndamn him, he knew! He was getting there, he was reaching the synaptic, a\nbit of fiction here and a bit there, ECAIAC was being conditioned,\nunable to distinguish the real from the unreal--\n\nCOUNSELOR: Mr. Arnold! If you please, sir! (_Waits for Arnold to\nsubside._) I can appreciate how this discovery distresses you,\nboth--ah--personally and in your official capacity, but be assured that\nyour findings will be of inestimable value to future security. In fact\n(_smiles slightly_) Council has not been idle in its own pursuit of Mr.\nBeardsley's vagaries! (_Rises, removes a small screen to reveal a\ntowering pile of tomes._) And now, Mr. Beardsley. I must really ask you\nto cooperate; I believe you fully capable. Are these your books?\n\nBEARDSLEY (_adjusts his glasses, smiles at his books_): Yes.\n\nCOUNSELOR: And these charts, these graphs that we found plastered to\nevery wall of your home. Obviously they are also yours.\n\nBEARDSLEY (_adjusts his glasses, smiles at his graphs_): Yes.\n\nCOUNSELOR: Thank you, Mr. Beardsley. That's fine. And, Mr. Beardsley,\nwhat did you use them for? These books, these graphs?\n\nBEARDSLEY (_groping, bewildered_): I--I--\n\nCOUNSELOR (_sees the futility of it_): Gentlemen, I believe we can\nproceed on the grounds of self-evidence. Let me read you a few titles\nfrom these books. \"The Cybernetic Principle: Advanced Theory\" ... \"The\nSynapse in Function\" ... and here we have \"Synaptics: Pattern and Flux.\"\nThere are more, many more in similar vein. (_Turns abruptly._) Mr.\nArnold. I'm sure you are familiar with most of these volumes. On the\nbasis of the content, would you say that you could duplicate Beardsley's\nfeat?\n\nARNOLD (_aghast_): No! I would not presume to say that, sir.\n\nCOUNSELOR (_frowns; it was not the answer he wanted_): Very well, then.\nDr. Trstensky ... would you come forward, please? Dr. Trstensky ... you\nare head of the Department of Advanced Cybernetics at Cal Tech. You have\nhad opportunity to study these graphs and charts in minutest detail--\n\nTRSTENSKY: Oh, yes-s. Fascinating!\n\nCOUNSELOR: I put the question: would it be possible for you to duplicate\nthe grotesque feat that Beardsley performed on ECAIAC?\n\nTRSTENSKY: Yes-s, possibly. No, I will say definitely. You mean, of\ncourse, cold, from the beginning? Yes-s ... but it would take me\napproximately three-to-four years.\n\nCOUNSELOR: Yes, Mr. Beardsley? What is it? You would like to make a\npertinent statement?\n\nBEARDSLEY (_abashed_): Oh. It--I only wanted to say it took me longer.\nFour-to-five years.\n\nCOUNSELOR (_wearily--just waits for laughter to subside_): Gentlemen, I\nthink we may safely wrap it up now. Our function here is Disposition.\nOur choice is two-fold. One: the subject is sane, in which case he will\npay the supreme penalty for murder which he has freely admitted. Or two:\nhe is obviously insane, in which case he will be subjected to Psychic\nProbe as provided by law, thus restoring a measure of normalcy\nsufficient to place him again in society--restricted, of course--\n\nDR. DOEBLER: Sir, one moment, if you please! I simply do not understand\nyour language, and even less can I condone your haste! _Safely_ wrap it\nup, you said. What do you mean by that? Safe for whom? And \"obviously\"\ninsane--was that a slip of the tongue, sir, or are you trying to force\nan issue here?\n\nCOUNSELOR (_coldly_): I must remind you that we already have competent\nreports on subject's status. Add to that the facts presented here; they\nare overwhelming; the man's own admission and attitude are\nsubstantiation. It is my considered opinion, and I'm sure the opinion of\nCouncil, that the man is insane. Subjection to Psychic Probe will\nrestore him to--\n\nDOEBLER: Oh, yes, the Psychic Probe. I have no quarrel there. _But\nsuppose you were wrong?_ Have you ever considered the effects of Probe\non the _sane_ mind? Have you ever seen it? Once I saw it, only once. It\nis worse than disaster--it is horrible--it results in a sort of psychic\ntearing that heals and then tears and then heals in continuous\nperpetuation. It--is indescribable. It is sub-human. Compared to that,\ndeath or even insanity is a blessed relief. Now, gentlemen, listen! I\nimplore you not to be in error! True, it was my opinion that Beardsley\nacted in fulfillment of the self-destructive impulse, but the man is\n_sane--sane_, I tell you, and entitled to a humanitarian death! My\nprofessional judgment--\n\nCOUNSELOR (_again coldly, glancing around_): Is welcome, but does not\nbear final weight, sir.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSilence closed down like a pall. Doebler's plea by its very impassioned\nnature had gotten through. It was a moment of embarrassment and\nindecision in which each man weighed his conscience, and found it\nwanting ... in which every member of Council looked to his neighbor for\nsolution or solace, and finding neither, turned back to himself, aghast.\n\nOnly one person looked to the true source and saw the solution as it\nwould be, as it had to be. Pederson. Heartsick with the knowing, he\nobserved Raoul Beardsley and remembered! This funny little man ... this\nridiculous man ... this proud man who had seized his fate and shoved it\nthrough because it had to be done, because he obeyed the dictates,\nbecause he had reached his Time of Assertion. Oh, Pederson remembered!\nAnd most of all he remembered Beardsley there at the last, in that final\nmoment when ECAIAC had reached the wailing heights of sentience and\ngrief ... and how could he ever forget Beardsley's soundless whisper\nthat seemed to say, \"_No, no ... don't you understand? ... we're friends\nnow!_\"\n\nPederson remembered. He remembered, and looking up saw that Council had\nreached equitable agreement, and his heart was sick and his soul was\nsick as he realized this was final, there could be no appeal. For the\nlast time he looked upon Beardsley's face and saw that the man was fully\ncognizant.... Beardsley also knew.... Deobler had been right. Pederson\nturned his face away.\n\nCOUNSELOR: Now we are agreed, gentlemen? (_waits for general approval._)\nBe it pronounced, then. Inasmuch as there exists a general area of doubt\nas to Disposition; and inasmuch as it is agreed that further\ndeliberation would be prolonged and pointless; and inasmuch as our faith\nin the ultimate function of ECAIAC remains inestimable, despite recent\nvagaries which shall never occur again: be it therefore resolved, that\nthe problem pending shall be taped in all its detail and submitted to\nECAIAC for Final Disposition.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of We're Friends, Now, by Henry Hasse\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WE'RE FRIENDS, NOW ***\n\n***** This file should be named 29488-8.txt or 29488-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/9/4/8/29488/\n\nProduced by Sankar Viswanathan, Greg Weeks, and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
