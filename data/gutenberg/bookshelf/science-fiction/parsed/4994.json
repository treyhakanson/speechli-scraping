I say Washington!\"\n\nThroughout a big shed, filled for the most part with huge pieces of\nmachinery, echoed the voice of Professor Amos Henderson. He did not\nlook up from a small engine over which he was bending.\n\n\"Washington! Where are you? Why don't you answer me?\"\n\nFrom somewhere underneath an immense pile of iron, steel and aluminum\ncame the voice of a colored man.\n\n\"Yas sir, Perfesser, I'se goin' t' saggasiate my bodily presence in\nyo' contiguous proximity an' attend t' yo' immediate conglomerated\nprescriptions at th' predistined period. Yas, sir!\"\n\n\"Well, Washington, if you had started when you began that long speech\nyou would have been at least half way here by this time. Hurry up!\nNever mind tightning those bolts now. Find the boys. I need them to\nhelp me with this engine. They must be around somewhere.\"\n\n\"I seen 'em goin' fishin' down by th' brook a little while ago,\"\nanswered the negro, crawling out from under what seemed to be a\ncombined airship and watercraft. \"Jack says as how yo' gived him\npermission t' occupy his indisputatious period of levity in\nendeavorin' t' extract from th' liquid element some specimens of\nswimmin' creatures.\"\n\n\"If you mean I said he and Mark could go fishing in the brook, you're\nright, Washington,\" replied the professor with a smile. \"But you waste\na lot of time and breath trying to say it. Why, don't you give up\nusing big words?\"\n\n\"I reckon I was brought up t' it,\" replied the colored man grinning\nfrom ear to ear. He did not always use big words but when he did they\nwere generally the wrong ones. Sometimes, he spoke quite correctly.\n\n\"Well, I suppose you can't help it,\" resumed Mr. Henderson. \"However,\nnever mind that. Find the boys and send them to me.\"\n\n\"With th' least appreciatableness amount of postponement,\" answered\nthe messenger, and he went out.\n\nWashington White, who in color was just the opposite to his name, a\ngeneral helper and companion to Professor Henderson, found Mark\nSampson and Jack Darrow about a quarter of a mile from the big shed,\nwhich was in the center of a wooded island off the coast of Maine. The\nlads were seated on the bank of a small brook, fishing.\n\n\"Perfesser wants yo' immediate,\" said Washington.\n\n\"But we haven't caught a single fish,\" objected Mark.\n\n\"Them's the orders from headquarters,\" replied the colored man. \"Yo'\nboth got t' project yo'selves in th' vicinity of th' machine shop. I\nreckon th' new fangled contraption that th' perfesser is goin' t'\nnavigate th' air an' sail th' angry seas in, am about done. He want's\nt' try th' engine.\"\n\n\"Come on then,\" said Jack. \"We probably would not catch any fish,\nanyhow, Mark.\"\n\nAccompanied by Washington, the youths, each of whom was about eighteen\nyears old, started toward the big shed.\n\nWhile they are on their way opportunity may be taken to tell a little\nabout them, as well as about Washington and the professor, and the\ncurious craft on which the scientist was working.\n\nA few years before this story opens Mr. Henderson had invented a\nwonderful electric airship. He had it about completed when, one day,\nhe and the two boys became unexpectedly acquainted, and, as it\ndeveloped, friends.\n\nMark and Jack were orphans. After having rather a hard time knocking\nabout the world trying to make a living, they chanced to meet, and\nresolved to cast their lots together. They boarded a freight train,\nand, as told in the first volume of this series, entitled, \"Through\nthe Air to the North Pole; or the Wonderful Cruise of the Electric\nMonarch,\" the cars were wrecked near where Professor Henderson was\nbuilding his strange craft.\n\nThe boys were cared for by the scientist, and, after their recovery\nfrom hurts received in the collision, they accepted his invitation to\nmake the trip through the upper regions in the airship, to search for\nthe north pole. With them went Andy Sudds, an old hunter, and Tom\nSmith and Bill Jones, two farmers, but who were hired as helpers on\nthe voyage. The party had many adventures on the trip, having battles\nwith savage animals and more savage Esquimaux, and were tossed about\nin terrible storms. After making some scientific observations, which\nthe professor was much interested in, they started back home.\n\nHaving found he could successfully sail in the air, Mr. Henderson\nresolved to try what it might be like under water.\n\nHe moved his machine shop to a lonely spot on the Maine coast, and\nthere, with the help of the boys, Washington, Andy and two machinists\nconstructed a submarine boat, called the Porpoise.\n\nIn this the professor resolved to seek the south pole, he having a\ntheory that it was surrounded by an open sea. After much hard work the\nPorpoise was made ready for the voyage.\n\nWhat occurred on this great trip is described in the second book of\nthis series, called \"Under the Ocean to the South Pole, or the Strange\nCruise of the Submarine Wonder.\" In that is told how once more Tom and\nBill, with Andy, the boys and Washington, accompanying Professor\nHenderson, had many thrilling experiences.\n\nThey were caught in the grip of the grass of the terrible Sargasso\nSea. Monstrous suckers grasped the boat in their powerful arms, and\nhad to be fought off. They were caught in a sea of boiling water and\nimprisoned between big fields of ice.\n\nBy means of strong diving suits they were able to leave the ship and\nwalk about on the bottom of the sea. They visited a graveyard of\nsunken ships, saw many strange monsters as well as many beautiful fish\nin the great depths to which they sunk. Many times they were in dire\nperil but the resources of the professor, the bravery and daring of\nthe boys, no less than the help Washington and Andy Sudds, the hunter,\nrendered at times, brought them through.\n\nThose of you who read of their adventures will recall the strange\nisland which they came upon in the Atlantic Ocean, far from the coast\nof South America.\n\nWhen they first drew near this island they were almost sucked into the\ndepths of a great whirlpool, caused by water pouring down a big hole\nthat seemed to lead far into the earth. They reversed their ship just\nin time.\n\nBut, on going to another side of the island they were able to approach\nsafely, as at this point the great hole was farther from the shore.\nThen they landed and investigated.\n\nThey found the island was almost circular, and the hole was also\nround, but not in the center of the land. It was an immense cavity, so\nwide they could not see across, and as for the depth they could only\nguess at it. Looking down they could only see rolling masses of vapor\nand clouds caused by the water which poured down from the ocean with\nthe force of a Niagara.\n\nGazing down into the big hole Mark suggested it might lead to the\ncentre of the earth, which some scientists claim is hollow. The\nprofessor admitted that the cavity looked as though it led to China.\n\nThey had no means of investigating further the mystery of the opening\nand returned to their submarine, completing the voyage to the south\npole.\n\nIt was now about two years since they had come back from that eventful\ntrip. One of the first things the professor did, after docking the\nPorpoise, was to shut himself up in his study and begin to draw plans.\nTo the questions of the boys he returned no answer for several days.\nThen he announced he was working on a craft which could both sail on\ntop of the water and navigate the air.\n\nIn time the plans were done, and, in order to keep the work secret,\nthe shop was moved to an island which the professor owned.\n\nParts of the Monarch and the Porpoise were used in constructing the\nnew craft, so there was no need to get other help than that which the\nboys, Washington and Bill and Tom could give, since the two latter\naccepted an offer of the professor to remain and work for him. The\nboys, of course, would not leave their friend.\n\nThe professor realized that he had a more difficult task in his new\nventure than he had set himself on other occasions. For a ship to be\nlight enough to rise in the air, and, at another time, and with no\nchange, to be strong enough to navigate the ocean, was indeed\nsomething to tax Mr. Henderson's ingenuity.\n\nHowever, in the course of a little over a year the larger part of the\nwork was done. Inside the big shed was the huge affair which, it was\nhoped, would enable its owner to be master of both air and water.\n\n\"Did the professor say anything special?\" asked Mark of Washington.\n\n\"Nope. I reckon he were too busy problamatin' the exact altitude\nprojected in an inverse direction by th' square root of th' new engine\nwhen operated at a million times inside of a few seconds, but he\ndidn't say nothin' t' me. I were busy underneath th' ship, fixin'\nbolts when he tole me t' find yo'. I wouldn't be s'prised if he had\nth' thing goin' soon.\"\n\n\"Do you think he'll be generating the new gas to-day?\" asked Jack\neagerly. \"That's the most troublesome part; to get that gas right.\"\n\n\"He didn't say nothin' t' me 'bout it,\" Washington stated, as he\nwalked along beside the two boys. \"He jest seemed anxious like.\"\n\n\"We'd better hurry,\" advised Mark. \"He may be at an important part in\nhis experiments and probably needs us. I hope it will work. He has\nspent many days on it, and we all have worked hard. It ought to be a\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"Perfesser allers makes things work,\" declared Washington stoutly.\n\n\"That's a good way to feel about it, anyway,\" observed Mark. \"Well,\nwe'll soon know.\"\n\nThe three hurried to the shed which they could see as they rounded a\nturn of the path through the wood. They noticed an elderly man\napproaching with a gun on his shoulder. On one arm he carried a game\nbag.\n\n\"Guess Andy got something for dinner,\" remarked Jack.\n\n\"I hopes so, honey,\" put in Washington. \"I'se got a sort of gone\nfeelin' in my stomach!\"\n\n\"Any luck, Andy?\" called Mark, when he came within hailing distance.\n\n\"Fine,\" replied Andy Sudds. \"Rabbits and quail. We'll have a good\ndinner to-morrow.\"\n\nWhile Andy entered the living part of the big shed to put away his gun\nand game, the boys and Washington kept on to the engine room. They\nfound the professor, with Bill and Tom, busy fitting pipes to the\nsmall engine which was set up at one side of the structure.\n\n\"Come, boys, I need your aid,\" remarked Mr. Henderson as they entered.\n\"Take off your coats and pitch in. Tighten up these bolts, Jack. Mark,\nyou mix up those chemicals the way I taught you, and see that the\ndynamo is in working order for Washington to attend to.\"\n\nIn a little while the shop was a veritable hive of industry, and it\nresounded to the sound of hammers, wrenches and machinery. In the\nbackground was the big ship, which seemed like two immense cigars, one\nabove the other, the lower one the larger.\n\n\"Where was you calalatin' t' take this here ship when it gits done,\nPerfesser?\" asked Washington, during a lull in the operations.\n\n\"Do you remember that big hole in the island we visited on our trip to\nthe south pole?\"\n\n\"I suah does,\" answered the colored man.\n\n\"We are going to explore that,\" went on the scientist. \"We are going\nto make a voyage to the interior of the earth in our Flying Mermaid.\"\n\n\"Go down into th' earth!\" exclaimed Washington, his eyes big with\nfright.\n\n\"Certainly; why not?\"\n\n\"Not for mine!\" cried the colored man, dropping the wrench he was\nholding. \"No sire I'm not goin' t' project myself int' a grave while\nI'se alive. Time enough when I kicks th' bucket. No sir! If yo' an'\nthe boys wants t' risk yo' se'ves goin' down int' th' interior of th'\nearth, where th' Bible says there's fiery furnaces, yo' kin go, but\nWashington White stays on terra cotta! That's where he stays; He ain't\nready t' be buried, not jest yet!\" and the frightened colored man\nstarted to leave the shed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE FLYING MERMAID\n\n\n\"HERE! Stop him!\" cried Professor Henderson. \"Don't let him get away.\nWe still need his help to get the ship in shape. He needn't be\nfrightened. We're not going to start at once.\"\n\nMark and Jack ran after Washington, whose progress was somewhat\nimpeded because he kept looking back as if he feared the new ship was\nchasing him.\n\n\"Come on back!\" said Mark. \"There's no danger, and if there was we're\nnot going to start to-day.\"\n\n\"Ain't yo' foolin' me?\" asked Washington, pausing and looking\ndoubtfully at the boys.\n\n\"Of course not,\" answered Mark. \"You know Professor Henderson would\nnot make you do anything you didn't want to do, Wash. He wishes you to\nstay and help him get ready, that's all.\"\n\n\"Well, Washington,\" observed the aged scientist. \"I didn't think you'd\ngo back on me.\"\n\n\"I'd do mos' anything fer yo', Perfesser,\" said the colored man, \"but\nI got t' beg off this time,\" and he looked at the Flying Mermaid as if\nhe thought the metal sides would open and devour him.\n\n\"Then help me get things in shape to generate the gas,\" the scientist\nsaid. \"I want to give the new vapor the first real test in lifting\npower to-day. On the success of it depends the future of the ship.\"\n\nSeeing there was no immediate danger of being carried to the centre of\nthe earth, Washington resumed his labors. The professor, the boys,\nBill and Tom were also hurrying matters to enable a test to be made\nbefore night.\n\nAs will readily be seen, even by those not familiar with the\nconstruction of airships and submarines, the chief problem was to find\nsome agent strong enough to lift from the earth a weight heavier than\nhad ever before been put into an apparatus that was destined to\ntraverse the clouds. For the Flying Mermaid was not only an airship\nbut an ocean voyager as well. It had to be made light enough to be\nlifted far above the earth, yet the very nature of it, necessitating\nit being made heavy enough to stand the buffeting of the waves and the\npressure of water, was against its flying abilities.\n\nProfessor Henderson realized this and knew that the chief concern\nwould be to discover a gas or vapor with five times the lifting power\nof hydrogen, one of the lightest gases known, and one sometimes used\nto inflate balloons.\n\nAfter long study he had been partially successful, but he knew from\nexperiments made that the gas he had so far been able to manufacture\nwould not answer. What he wanted was some element that could be mixed\nwith the gas, to neutralize the attraction of gravitation, or downward\npull of the earth.\n\nWhile he was seeking this, and experimenting on many lines, the\nconstruction of the air-water ship went on. In general the outward\nconstruction was two cigar shaped hulls, one above the other.\nAluminum, being the lightest and strongest metal that could be used\nfor the purpose, formed the main part of both bodies.\n\nThe upper hull was one hundred feet long and twenty feet in diameter\nat the widest part. It tapered to points at either end. It was\nattached to the lower hull by strong braces, at either end, while from\nthe center there extended a pipe which connected with the lower\nsection. This pipe was intended to convey the lifting gas to the part\nwhich corresponded to the bag of the balloon, save that it was of\nmetal instead of silk, or rubber as is usual.\n\nThere were two reasons for this. One was that it would not be liable\nto puncture, particularly in the proposed underground trip, and the\nother was that it did not have to be so large as a cloth bag would\nhave had to be. It was also a permanent part of the ship, and on a\nvoyage where part of the time the travelers would be in the air and\npart on the water, and when the change from one to the other would\nhave to be made quickly, this was necessary. It would have taken too\nlong to raise the ship in the air had a cloth bag been used to contain\nthe gas.\n\nThe lower hull or main part of the craft was one hundred and fifty\nfeet long, and forty feet through at the largest part, in the centre.\n\nIt was divided into four sections. The forward one contained the\nsleeping quarters of Professor Henderson and his crew. There was a\nsmall stateroom for each one. Above was a conning or observation\ntower, reached by a small flight of steps. From this tower the ship\ncould be steered, stopped and started, as could also be done from the\nengine room, which was in the after part of the hull.\n\nAs in the Porpoise and Monarch, electricity formed the motive power\nand was also used for many other purposes on board. Engines operated\nby gas produced the current which heated, lighted and moved the ship,\nas well as played a part in producing the wonderful gas.\n\nThe ship moved forward or backward by means of a novel arrangement.\nThis was by the power of compressed air. From either end of the lower\nhull there projected a short pipe working in a ball and socket joint,\nso it could be turned in any direction. By means of strong pumps a\ncurrent of compressed air could be sent out from either pipe. Thus\nwhen floating above the earth the ship was forced forward by the blast\nof air rushing from the pipe at the stern. It was the same principle\nas that on which a sky rocket is shot heavenward, save that gases\nproduced by the burning of powder in the pasteboard rocket form its\nmoving impulse.\n\nIn the case of the Flying Mermaid, it could be made to move backward\nby sending the air out of the forward tube. Thus, when in the water,\nthe compressed air rushing from the pipe struck the fluid and forced\nthe ship forward or backward as was desired. It floated on the\nsurface, the deck being about three feet out of water, while the\naluminum gas bag was overhead.\n\nThe engine room was a marvel of machine construction. It contained\npumps for air and water, motors, dynamos, gas engines, and a maze of\nwheels and levers. Yet everything was very compact and no room was\nwasted.\n\nThe use of the air method of propulsion did away with the necessity of\na large propellor such as most airships have to use, a propellor which\nmust of necessity be very light and which is easily broken.\n\nNext to the engine room was the kitchen. It contained an electric\nrange and all necessary appliances and utensils for preparing meals.\nThere were lockers and a large reserve storeroom which when the time\ncame would be well stocked with food. Forward of the kitchen was the\nliving and dining room. It contained comfortable seats, folding tables\nand a small library. Here, also were many instruments designed to show\nhow the various machines were working. There were gages, pointers and\ndials, which told the direction the ship was traveling, the speed and\nthe distance above the earth or below the surface. Similar indicators\nwere in the conning tower, which had a powerful search light.\n\nThe ship was lighted throughout by incandescent lamps, and there was\neven a small automatic piano worked by the electric current, on which\npopular airs could be played.\n\nIf the gas and the gravity neutralizer worked as Professor Henderson\nhoped they would, as soon as the ship was completed, all that would be\nnecessary to start on the voyage would be to fill the aluminum bag and\nset the air compressor in motion.\n\nThe gas was made from common air, chemically treated and with a secret\nmaterial added which by means of a complicated machine in a measure\ndid away with the downward pull of the earth. Thus all that was\nnecessary to carry on a long voyage was a quantity of gasolene to\noperate the engine which worked the electric machines, and some of\nthis secret compound.\n\nThe professor and his helpers had been working to good advantage. At\nlast all was in readiness for the gas test.\n\nIt was proposed to try it on an experimental scale. Some of the fluid\nwas to be generated and forced into an aluminum cylinder under the\nsame pressure it would be used in the air ship. To this cylinder were\nattached weights in proportion to the weight of the Flying Mermaid\nwith its load of human freight, engines and equipment.\n\n\"This cylinder is just one one-hundredth the size of the cylinder of\nthe ship,\" said the professor. \"I am going to fasten to it a hundred\npound weight. If it lifts that our latest contrivance will be a\nsuccess.\"\n\n\"You mean if the little cylinder pulls a hundred pounds up the big\nship will take us and the machinery up?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered the professor. \"If this cylinder lifts a hundred\npounds, one a hundred times as big (as that of the Mermaid is), will\nlift a hundred times as much, or ten thousand pounds. That is five\ntons, or more than a ton over what I figure to be the weight of our\nship and contents. The latest war balloon can lift one ton with ease,\nand if my machine can not do five times as well I shall be\ndisappointed.\"\n\nThe last adjustments were made, pipes were run from the gas generator\nto the cylinder, and the hundred pound weight was attached.\n\n\"Everybody look out now,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"I am going to start the\nmachine and let the gas enter the cylinder. It is a very powerful gas\nand may break the cylinder. If it does you must all duck.\"\n\nThe scientist gave a last look at everything. The boys got behind some\nboards whence they could see without being in danger. Washington, who\nhad little fear so long as there was no danger of going under ground,\ntook his place at the dynamo. Andy Sudds, with Bill and Tom, stationed\nthemselves in safe places.\n\n\"All ready!\" called the professor.\n\nHe pulled a lever toward him, turned a wheel and signalled to\nWashington to start the dynamo. There was a sound of buzzing\nmachinery, which was followed by a hiss as the gas began to enter the\ncylinder under pressure. Would it stand the strain? That question was\nuppermost in every one's mind save the professor's. He only cared to\nsee the cylinder leave the ground, carrying the weight with it. That\nwould prove his long labors were crowned with success.\n\nFaster and faster whirred the dynamo. The gas was being generated from\nthe air. The secret chemical made a hissing which could be heard for\nsome distance. The gage registered a heavy pressure. Anxiously the\nprofessor watched the cylinder.\n\n\"There!\" he exclaimed at length. \"It has all the gas it can hold. Now\nto see if it works!\"\n\nHe disconnected the pipe leading from the generator. This left the\ncylinder free. It seemed to tremble slightly. There appeared to be a\nmovement to the hundred pound weight which rested on the ground. It\nwas as if it was tugging to get loose.\n\n\"There it goes! There it goes!\" cried Mark, joyfully.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Jack. \"There she rises!\"\n\n\"It suttinly am projectin' itself skyward!\" yelled Washington, coming\nfrom the dynamo.\n\nSure enough the cylinder was slowly rising in the air, bearing the\nweight with it. It had lifted it clear from the ground and was\napproaching the roof of the big shed.\n\n\"It will work! It will work!\" exclaimed the professor, strangely\nexcited.\n\nThe next instant the cylinder, carrying the weight, sailed right out\nof an open skylight, and began drifting outside the shop, and across\nthe fields.\n\n\"Quick! We must get it back!\" cried Mr. Henderson. \"If it gets away my\nsecret may be discovered and I will lose all! We must secure it!\"\n\nBut the cylinder was now two hundred feet in the air and being blown\nto the east, the weight dangling below it, making it look like a\nminiature airship.\n\n\"We can never catch that!\" cried Mark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nWASHINGTON DECIDES\n\n\n\"WE must catch that cylinder!\" the professor exclaimed. \"Some one may\nfind it when it comes down and analyze the gas. Then he would discover\nhow to make it. The cylinder must come down!\"\n\n\"Don't see how we can proximate ourselves inter th' vicinity of it\nlessen we delegate th' imperial functions of orinthological specimens\nt' some member of this here party,\" observed Washington.\n\n\"If you mean we can't catch that there contraption unless we turn into\nbirds I'll show you that you're mistaken!\" cried Andy Sudds. \"I guess\nI have a trick or two up my sleeve,\" and the old hunter quickly threw\nopen the breech of his gun and inserted a couple of cartridges.\n\nHe raised the piece to his shoulder and took quick aim. There was a\nsliver of flame, a puff of smoke and a sharp report. The professor and\nthe boys who were watching the cylinder saw it vibrate up in the air.\nThen there came a whistling sound. An instant later the metal body\nbegan to descend, and it and the weight fell to the earth.\n\n\"I'm sorry I had to put a bullet through it, Professor,\" said old Andy\nwith a queer smile, \"but it was the only way I saw of bringing it\ndown. Hope it isn't damaged much.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter if it is,\" the scientist answered. \"I can make more\ncylinders, but I don't want that secret of the gas to become known.\nYour bullet served a good turn, Andy, for it let the compressed vapor\nout just in time.\"\n\n\"Then we may consider the experiment a success,\" said Mark, as\nWashington went to where the cylinder had fallen, to detach it from\nthe weight and bring both to the shed.\n\n\"It seems so,\" Mr. Henderson answered. \"True, it was only an\nexperiment. We have yet to test the ship itself.\"\n\n\"When can we do that?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I hope by Monday,\" the scientist answered.\n\n\"Will you try it in the water or air first?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"I'm almost certain it will float in the water,\" the aged inventor\nsaid. \"It does not require much work to make a ship which will do\nthat. But the air proposition is another matter. However, since the\ncylinder rose, I am pretty sure the Flying Mermaid will.\n\n\"But we have done enough work to-day. Let's rest and have something to\neat. Then, with Sunday to sit around and talk matters over, we will be\nready for Monday's test.\"\n\nSome of the game Andy had killed was soon on the table, for\nWashington, in addition to his other accomplishments, was an expert\ncook. During the evening the boys and their friends sat in the living\nroom of the big shed and talked over the events of the day.\n\nSunday was spent in discussing what adventures might lie before them\nshould they be able to descend into the big hole. Washington did not\nsay, much, but it was easy to see he had no notion of going. He even\nbegan to pack his few belongings in readiness to leave the service of\nMr. Henderson, for whom he had worked a good many years.\n\nNo one remained long abed Monday morning. Even Washington was up early\nin spite of the interest he had lost in the professor's voyage.\n\n\"I jest wants t' see yo' start fer that place where they buries live\nfolks,\" he said.\n\nIn order to properly test the Flying Mermaid it was necessary to move\nthe craft from the shed from which place it had never been taken since\nit's construction was started. It had been built on big rollers in\nanticipation of this need, so that all which was now necessary was to\nopen the doors at the end, and roll the craft out.\n\nThis was accomplished with no small amount of labor, and it was nearly\nnoon before the big ship was moved into the open. It was shoved along\nto a little clearing in front of the shed, where no trees would\ninterfere with its possible upward movement.\n\nEveryone was bustling about. The professor was busiest of all. He went\nfrom one machine to another; from this apparatus to that, testing\nhere, turning wheels there, adjusting valves and seeing that all was\nin readiness for the generating of the powerful gas.\n\nAs the airship was half round on the bottom and as it rested in a sort\nof semi-circular cradle; it brought the entrance some distance above\nthe ground. To make it easier to get in and out while preparations for\nthe trial were going on, Bill and Tom had made an improvised pair of\nsteps, which were tied to the side of the ship with ropes.\n\nUp and down these the professor, the boys and Andy went, taking in\ntools and materials, and removing considerable refuse which had\naccumulated during the building of the craft.\n\nFinally all was in readiness for starting the making of the gas. The\nship was not wholly complete and no supplies or provisions for the\nlong voyage had been taken aboard. The Flying Mermaid was about a ton\nlighter than it would be when fully fitted out, but to make up for\nthis the professor had left in the ship a lot of tools and surplus\nmachinery so that the craft held as much weight as it would under\nnormal conditions. If the gas lifted it now it would at any other\ntime.\n\n\"Start the generator,\" said Mr. Henderson, to Mark. \"We'll soon see\nwhether we are going to succeed or fail.\"\n\nThe boy turned a number of levers and wheels. The machine which made\nthe powerful vapor was soon in operation. The professor had already\nadded enough of the secret compound to the tank containing the other\ningredients, and the big pump was sucking in air to be transformed\ninto the lifting gas.\n\nThe boys and the professor were in the engine room. Andy Sudds, with\nBill and Tom, had taken their places in the living room, to more\nevenly balance the ship, since the things in it were not yet all in\ntheir proper places. As for Washington he was busy running from the\nshed to the ship with various tools and bits of machinery the\nprofessor desired.\n\nThe gas was being generated rapidly. Throughout the ship there\nresounded a hissing noise that told it was being forced through the\npipe into the aluminum shell above the ship proper.\n\n\"I wonder how soon it will begin to lift us,\" said Mark.\n\n\"It will take about half an hour,\" replied Mr. Henderson. \"You see we\nhave first to fill the holder completely, since there is no gas in it.\nAfter this we will keep some on hand, so that it will only need the\naddition of a small quantity to enable the ship to rise.\"\n\nHe was busy watching the pointer on a dial which indicated the\npressure of the gas, and the lifting force. The boys were kept busy\nmaking adjustments to the machinery and oiling bearings.\n\nSuddenly, throughout the length of the craft there was felt a curious\ntrembling. It was as though the screw of a powerful steamer was\nrevolving in the water.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I hope it is the lifting power of the gas making itself felt,\" the\nprofessor answered. \"Perhaps the Flying Mermaid is getting ready to\ntry her wings.\"\n\nThe trembling became more pronounced. The gas was being generated\nfaster than ever. The whole ship was trembling. Tom and Bill came from\nthe room, where they were stationed, to inquire the meaning, but were\nreassured by the professor.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed if you find yourselves up in the air pretty soon,\"\nhe remarked with a smile. \"Remember the Electric Monarch, and the\nflights she took. We may not go as high as we did in her, but it will\nanswer the same purpose.\"\n\nThe gas was hissing through the big tube as it rushed into the\noverhead holder. The gage indicated a heavy pressure. The ship began\nto tremble more violently and to sway slightly from side to side.\n\n\"I think we shall rise presently,\" said Mr. Henderson. His voice\nshowed the pride he felt at the seeming success with which his\ninvention was about to meet.\n\nSuddenly, with a little jerk, as though some one with a giant hand had\nplucked the Flying Mermaid from the earth, the ship gave a little\nbound into the air, and was floating free.\n\n\"Here we go!\" cried Mr. Henderson. \"The ship is a success. Now we're\noff for the hole in the earth!\"\n\nThe Flying Mermaid was indeed rising in the air. True it did not go up\nso swiftly as had the Monarch, but then it was a much heavier and\nstronger vessel, and flying was only one of its accomplishments.\n\n\"It's a success! It's a success!\" shouted Mark, capering about in his\nexcitement.\n\n\"Now we'll see what the centre of the earth looks like,\" went on Jack.\n\"I can hardly wait for the time to come when we are to start on the\nvoyage.\"\n\nAt that instant, when the ship was but a few feet from the ground, but\nslowly rising, the boys and the professor heard a shouting below them.\n\n\"What's that?\" asked the scientist. \"Is any one hurt?\"\n\nMark ran to a small window, something like a port hole in an ocean\nsteamer, and looked out.\n\n\"Quick!\" he shouted. \"Stop the ship! Washington will be killed!\"\n\nIn fact from the agonized yells which proceeded from somewhere under\nthe craft it seemed that the accident was in process of happening.\n\n\"Save me! Save me!\" cried the colored man. \"I'm goin' to fall! Catch\nme, some one!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked the professor, making ready to shut off the power\nand let the ship settle back to earth, from which it had moved about\nfifty feet.\n\n\"It's Washington,\" explained Mark. \"He evidently tried to walk up the\nsteps just as the boat mounted skyward. He rolled down and managed to\ngrab the end of the rope which was left over after the steps were\ntied. Now he's swinging down there.\"\n\n\"Are you going to lower the ship?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Of course!\" exclaimed the professor. \"I only hope he hangs on until\nhis feet touch the earth.\"\n\n\"Keep a tight hold!\" shouted Mark, from out of the small window.\n\n\"That's th' truest thing yo' ever said!\" exclaimed Washington. \"You\nbet I'm goin' to hold on, and I'm comin' up too,\" which he proceeded\nto do, hand over hand, like a sailor.\n\nThe boys and the professor watched the colored man's upward progress.\nThe ship had hardly begun to settle as, in the excitement, not enough\ngas had been let out. Closer and closer came Washington, until he was\nable to grasp the edge of the opening, to which the steps were\nfastened.\n\n\"I thought you weren't coming with us,\" observed the professor, when\nhe saw that his helper was safe.\n\n\"I changed my mind,\" said the colored man. \"It's jest luck. Seems like\nth' ship done wanted me t' go 'long, an' I'm goin'. I'll take my\nchances on bein' buried alive. I ain't never seen th' centre of th'\nearth, an' I want's to 'fore I die. I'm goin' 'long, Perfessor!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nWHAT DID MARK SEE?\n\n\n\"WELL, I'm glad you've decided at last,\" the professor remarked. \"Now\ncome inside and we'll see how the ship works.\"\n\nOnce over his fright, Washington made himself at home on the craft he\nhad helped build. He went from one room to another and observed the\nengine.\n\n\"She certainly am workin'\" he observed with pride. \"Are we still goin'\nup, Perfessor?\"\n\n\"Still mounting,\" replied Mr. Henderson, \"We are now three hundred\nfeet above the earth,\" he added as he glanced at a registering gage.\n\nThe great air pump was set going and soon from the after tube, a big\nstream of the compressed vapor rushed. It acted on the ship instantly\nand sent the craft ahead at a rapid rate. By elevating or depressing\nthe tube the craft could be sent obliquely up or down. Then, by\nforcing the air from the forward tube, the Mermaid was reversed and\nscudded backward.\n\nBut it was more with the ship's ability to rise and descend that\nProfessor Henderson was concerned, since on that depended their\nsafety. So various tests were made, in generating the gas and using\nthe negative gravity apparatus.\n\nAll worked to perfection. Obeying the slightest turn of the wheels and\nlevers the Mermaid rose or fell. She stood still, suspended herself in\nthe air, or rushed backward and forward.\n\nOf course the machinery was new and did not operate as smoothly as it\nwould later, but the professor and his friends were very well\nsatisfied.\n\n\"Now we'll try something new,\" said the scientist to the two boys as\nthey stood beside him in the tower. \"I only hope this part succeeds,\nand we shall soon be off on our voyage.\"\n\nHe turned several levers. There was a hissing sound as the gas rushed\nfrom the container, and the ship began to settle down.\n\n\"What's th' matter? Are we goin' t' hit th' earth?\" yelled Washington,\nrushing from the engine room.\n\n\"Keep quiet,\" ordered the professor. \"We are only going down, that's\nall.\"\n\n\"But good land! Perfesser!\" exclaimed the colored man. \"The ocean's\nright under us! You forgot you sailed sway from the island! We'll be\ndrowned suah!\"\n\n\"Leave it to me,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"The Flying Mermaid is going to\ntake a bath!\"\n\n\"As long as it swims it will be all right,\" observed Mark in a low\ntone to Jack. \"I'm glad I can take care of myself in the water.\"\n\nBefore Jack could reply the Mermaid seemed to take a sudden dive\nthrough the air. The next instant she struck the water with a splash\nthat sent the waves rolling all about. The craft rocked violently to\nand fro on the surface of the sea. For a while there were anxious\nhearts aboard, for there was no certainty but that the ship might not\nsink to the bottom.\n\nBut the old professor had not calculated and builded in vain. After\nrocking about like a vessel newly launched, the strange craft rode\nsafely and upright on the water. It set down far enough to bring the\npropelling tubes well under, but not so far but that the conning tower\nwas well out and there was a small deck available.\n\n\"Now to see if we can conquer the water as we did the air!\" cried the\nprofessor. \"Mark, start the air pump. Jack, you steer, for I want to\nwatch the machinery under the additional strain.\"\n\nFrom the rear tube rushed such a volume of air that the ocean near it\nbubbled and foamed. The ship trembled from stem to stern, and then,\nafter hanging for an instant as if undecided what to do, it began to\nmove forward as easily as though it had never sailed any other element\nthan the sea.\n\n\"She fits her name!\" the professor cried. \"She is indeed the Flying\nMermaid, for she sails the ocean as easily as she navigates in the\nclouds!\"\n\nFor a mile or two the craft was sent ahead over the waves. Then it was\nreversed and run backwards. Satisfied that his long months of work had\nnot gone for naught, the professor after trying several experiments,\ndecided to try and raise the ship while in motion.\n\nWith Jack and Mark to look after the air pumps, while Washington, Tom\nand Bill busied themselves in the engine room, Mr. Henderson began to\ngenerate the gas and start the negative gravity apparatus. All the\nwhile the craft was forging ahead.\n\nThere was again the hissing sound that told of the aluminum holder\nbeing filled. For a few minutes there seemed to be no change, the\nMermaid plowing forward.\n\nThen like a bird rising from the waves, or like a flying fish leaping\nfrom the sea to escape some pursuing monster of the deep, the new ship\nshot up diagonally from the surface and winged its way into the upper\nregions of the air.\n\n\"Success! Success!\" cried the professor. \"This proves all I wanted to\nknow. Now we are ready for our great trip!\"\n\nGreat were the rejoicings in the camp that night. It was like living\nover again the days when they were aboard the diving Porpoise or the\nflying Monarch. To the recollections were added the anticipations of\nwhat was before them in the trip to the interior of the earth.\n\nBusy days followed, for there was still much to be done to the Flying\nMermaid. The machinery, which was only partly completed, had to be\nfinished. Besides this the professor was working on some apparatus,\nthe use of which he did not disclose to any one. It was stored aboard\nthe ship at the last minute.\n\nPlenty of provisions had to be taken aboard, and many supplies needed\nto work the Mermaid and insure that it would go to the end of the\nvoyage. The materials for generating the gas and negative gravity,\nspare parts, records for the automatic piano and other things were\nstored away.\n\nSome guns and ammunition were taken along as were a few revolvers,\nsince old Andy had said it was best to prepare for any thing in the\nshape of enemies or wild beasts that might be met with in the interior\nregions.\n\nIt was decided to make the start by sailing along the surface of the\nsea for several days, as in the event of any weakness in the machinery\nbeing discovered there would be less danger. If, at the end of four\ndays, no trouble developed, the professor said he would send the\nMermaid into the air and make the rest of the voyage through the sky.\n\nThe night before the start was to be made the professor, with the\nboys, Washington and the other helpers, went about through the various\nshops and buildings, locking them up securely. For they could not tell\nhow long they would be away, and they had to leave behind much\nvaluable material.\n\nAs there were several things that needed attention they divided the\nwork up. Mark had finished his share and was walking back toward the\nliving cabin where they were all quartered, when, down at the shore,\nnear where the boat was moored, he fancied he saw, in the gathering\ndarkness, a moving figure.\n\n\"I wonder who that can be,\" he thought. \"All the others are near the\nmachine shop, for I just left them there. Perhaps it's some one trying\nto spy out how the Mermaid is built.\"\n\nKnowing the professor wanted his secret well guarded, Mark walked\nsoftly toward the little dock that served as a place whence the\nMermaid could be easily boarded. As he approached he saw the figure\nmoving. Something struck the boy as peculiar.\n\nThough the object had some of the characteristics of a man it did not\nwalk like a human being, but shuffled along more like a huge ape or\nmonkey. It seemed bent over, as if it stooped toward the ground.\n\n\"Who are you?\" called Mark suddenly.\n\nFor an instant the figure halted and then hurried on faster than\nbefore, with a curious, shuffling walk. It was approaching the ship.\n\nSomehow it struck Mark as if it was an uncanny being; an inhabitant of\nsome other world. Then he laughed at his half-fear, and started on a\nrun toward the dock.\n\n\"If it's some tramp trying to find a place to sleep he'd better not go\naboard the ship, he might do some damage,\" the boy thought.\n\nHe could hardly see the figure now as it had passed into the shadow\ncast by the boat. He was about to summon the professor to make an\ninvestigation, when Washington started going the search light which\nwas placed just over the door of the living cabin. It was kept there\nas a sort of beacon light, as, near the island was a dangerous ledge\nof rocks.\n\nThen, in the blinding white glare from the big lantern as Washington\naccidentally swung it toward the Mermaid, Mark beheld a strange sight.\n\nThe figure he had been watching stood out in bold relief. Though it\nwas shaped like a human being it was not like any person the boy had\never seen. It seemed covered with a skin twice too large for it; a\nskin, which, in spite of the clothes that concealed it, hung in folds\nabout the arms and legs, dropping pendent like from the neck like a\nbig garment, and flapping in the wind.\n\nFor an instant Mark was so startled he cried out, and the professor\nand the others ran to see what was the matter.\n\n\"There--by the ship! A horrible creature!\" exclaimed Mark.\n\nShouting to Washington to keep the light steady in the direction of\nthe dock, Mr. Henderson ran toward the moored Mermaid. Jack, Andy,\nBill and Tom, with Mark in the rear followed him.\n\n\"Nothing here,\" said the scientist, after a careful search about. \"Are\nyou sure you saw something, Mark?\"\n\n\"Positively,\" replied the lad with a shudder. He described the vision\nof the darkness.\n\n\"I guess it was a big otter, or maybe an enormous turtle,\" the\nprofessor said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nATTACKED BY A WHALE\n\n\nBUT Mark was certain it was nothing like that, though a careful search\nfailed to reveal anything or any person near the ship. It was too dark\nto examine for footprints, and even Mark, after taking a look all\nabout, felt he might have been deceived by shadows. Still he was a\nlittle nervous, and could hardly sleep for imagining what the thing he\nsaw could have been.\n\nThe next day every one was so busy that no one, not even Mark,\nrecalled the little excitement of the night before. Shortly after\nnoon, final preparations having been made, they all got aboard the\nMermaid and started off.\n\nIt was a bright sunshiny day, and the craft, speeding away from the\nisland where it had been constructed, over the dancing blue waves,\nmust have presented a strange sight had there been any spectators. For\nsurely no such ship had ever before sailed those waters.\n\nHowever, there was no other vessel in sight, and the island, as far as\nthe professor and his friends knew, had never been inhabited.\n\n\"We will not try for any great speed,\" Mr. Henderson remarked as he,\nwith Mark and Jack, stood in the conning tower managing the Mermaid.\n\"We don't want to strain any joints at the start or heat any engine\nbearings. There will be time enough for speed later.\"\n\n\"Yes, and we may need it more when we get into the centre of the earth\nthan we do now,\" observed Mark.\n\n\"Why so?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"No telling what we may run up against underneath the ground,\" went on\nMark. \"We may have to fight strange animals and stranger beings.\nBesides, the atmosphere and water there can't be the same as up here;\ndo you think so, Professor?\"\n\nFor a few minutes the scientist was silent. He seemed to be thinking\ndeeply.\n\n\"I will tell you what I believe,\" he said at length. \"I have never\nspoken of it before, but now that we are fairly started and may\neventually have a chance to prove my theory, I will say that I think\nthe centre of this earth on which we live is hollow. Inside of it,\nforming a core, so to speak, I believe there is another earth, similar\nto ours in some respects which revolves inside this larger sphere.\"\n\nThey were well out to sea now, as they could observe when they emerged\non the little deck. Above their heads was the aluminum gas holder,\nwhich served as a sort of protection from the sun that was quite warm.\nThe Mermaid rode with an easy motion, being submerged just enough to\nmake her steady, yet not deep enough to encounter much resistance from\nthe water. In fact it could not have been arranged better for speed or\ncomfort.\n\n\"I think we will sail well to the eastward before making our course\nsouth,\" Mr. Henderson said. \"I do not care to meet too many ships, as\nthose aboard will be very curious and I do not want too much news of\nthis venture to get out. We will take an unfrequented route and avoid\ndelays by being hailed by every passing vessel whose captain will\nwonder what queer craft he had met with.\"\n\nThe boys enjoyed the sail, for the weather could not have been better.\nEven old Andy, who seldom said much, seemed delighted with the\nprospect of having strange adventures. He had his rifle with him, and,\nindeed, he seldom went anywhere that he did not carry it.\n\n\"For there's no telling when you may see something you want to shoot\nor that ought to be shot,\" he used to say, \"and it's always the man\nwithout a gun who needs it most. So I'm taking no chances.\"\n\nThey sailed all that afternoon without meeting with a craft of any\nkind. Straight to the east they went, and when night began to settle\ndown Washington got supper. It was decided to run slowly after dark\nuntil all hands were more familiar with the ship.\n\nMorning found the Mermaid about a hundred miles from the island where\nshe had been launched. The night had been uneventful, except that Mark\ntold Jack he heard some strange noise near his bunk several times. He\nwas nearest the storeroom where spare parts, and the curious cylinder\nthe professor had brought aboard, were kept.\n\n\"I guess it was rats,\" said Jack. \"They are always in ships.\"\n\n\"Old wooden ships, yes,\" admitted Mark. \"But I'll bet there's not a\nrat aboard the Mermaid.\"\n\n\"Then you were dreaming,\" said Jack, as if that settled it.\n\nMark did not speak further of the noise, but he did considerable\nthinking. However, the next night there was no further disturbance.\n\nThe fourth day out, when everything had passed off well, the engines\ndoing their best, the professor decided to speed them up a bit, since\nhe was satisfied they had \"found\" themselves as mechanics term it.\n\n\"We'll see how fast we can go through the water,\" said Mr. Henderson,\n\"and then I think we can safely turn our course south. We are well\nbeyond the ordinary lines of travel now.\"\n\nHaving oiled the bearings well, and seen that everything was in place\nand properly adjusted, the professor and the boys took their places in\nthe conning tower, while Washington, Tom and Bill remained in the\nengine room. Andy stayed on deck with his gun.\n\n\"I might see a big fish, and we could vary our bill of fare,\" he said\nwith a laugh.\n\n\"Here we go!\" exclaimed the professor as he shifted the levers and\nturned some wheels and valves. \"Now we'll see how fast we can travel.\"\n\nAs he spoke the Mermaid responded to the added impulse of the\ncompressed air and shot through the water at a terrific speed. The\nsudden increase in momentum almost threw the boys from their feet, and\nthey would have fallen had they not grasped some projecting levers.\n\n\"I guess that will do,\" Said the scientist. \"I think we have speed\nenough for almost any emergency. I'll let her run at this rate for a\nwhile, and then we'll slack up.\"\n\nLooking ahead, the boys could see the green waters parting in front of\nthe bow of the Mermaid, as if to make room for her. Two huge waves\nwere thrown upon either side.\n\nSuddenly, dead ahead, there loomed up a big black object.\n\n\"Look out you'll hit the rock!\" cried Mark to the professor, who was\nsteering.\n\nWith a turn of his wrist Mr. Henderson moved the wheel which\ncontrolled the tube. It was deflected and sent the boat to larboard.\n\nAt that instant from the rock two small fountains of water rose in the\nair, falling back in a shower of spray through which the sun gleamed.\n\n\"That's not a rock! It's a big whale!\" cried Jack. \"And we're going to\nhit him!\"\n\nThe professor had miscalculated the speed of the craft, or else had\nnot thrown her far enough to larboard, for, a second later, the\nMermaid was almost upon the big leviathan.\n\nWith a desperate twirling of the steering wheel the professor veered\nthe craft as far as possible. But all he could do did not suffice, for\nthe craft hit the whale a glancing blow on the side, and the ship\ncareened as if she would turn turtle.\n\nAt the same time there rang out from upon deck the sound of a rifle\nshot. Old Andy had taken a chance at the enormous creature of the\ndeep.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" the bays heard him shout. \"I give him one plumb in the eye!\nA fine shot! And we hit him besides with the boat. I guess he's a\ngoner!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid not,\" muttered the professor. \"That was a bad blow we\nstruck him, but I think it will only ruffle his temper. We'll have to\nlook sharp now, boys.\"\n\nBy this time the ship had rushed past the whale, but the boys, looking\nthrough a window in the rear of the tower could see the huge body. Now\nthe fountains of water which the whale spouted were tinged with red.\n\n\"He's bleeding!\" exclaimed the professor. \"I guess Andy hit him in a\nvital spot.\"\n\n\"But not vital enough!\" cried Mark. \"See! He's coming after us!\"\n\nAnd so it proved. The whale, angered, and, probably half crazed by the\npain of the bullet and the blow, was coursing after the ship, coming\non with the speed of an express train. Straight at the Mermaid he\nlunged his huge bulk.\n\n\"We must escape him!\" cried Mr. Henderson. \"If he hits us he'll send\nus to the bottom!\"\n\nHe had made ready to slow up the Mermaid to see if it had sustained\nany damage from the impact with the whale, but when he saw the monster\ncoming after the boat he knew the only safety lay in flight.\n\n\"Let us go up into the air and so escape him!\" cried Jack, with sudden\ninspiration.\n\nFor an instant neither Mark nor the professor grasped what Jack meant.\nThen, with an exclamation, the professor pulled forward the lever that\ngenerated the gas and set working the gravity neutralizer, which would\nenable the ship to rise.\n\nFaster through the water went the Mermaid, and faster after her came\nthe whale. Above the hum of the engines was heard the hiss of the\npowerful gas. The ship trembled more violently.\n\n\"We are rising!\" exclaimed the professor, as he looked at a gage.\n\nThe boys could feel the craft lifting from the waves which clung to\nher as if they hated to lose her. The boys knew the gas was beginning\nto operate.\n\n\"If it is not too late!\" whispered Mark, half to himself.\n\nFor the monster of the seas was coming on, lashing the water to foam\nwith his terrible flukes, and sending aloft a bloody spray. His speed\nwas awful.\n\nNow he was but ten feet away from the fleeing craft--now but eight--now\nfive! Ten seconds more and the big head, like the blunt stern of a\nbattle ship, forced forward by the tons of blubber, flesh, bone and\nfat behind it would strike the Mermaid and crush it like an egg shell.\n\nNow if ever was the need for the Flying Mermaid to prove herself\nworthy of the name. Now, if ever, was the time for her to leave the\nwatery element and take to the lighter one.\n\nAnd she did. With a last tremble, as if to free herself from the hold\nof the waves, the gallant craft soared up into the air, leaving the\nwater, which dripped from her keel like a fountain's spray, and\nshooting aloft like a bird, escaped her terrible enemy which passed\nunder her, so close that the lower part of the Flying Mermaid scraped\nthe whale's back.\n\n\"Saved!\" exclaimed the professor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE CYCLONE\n\n\nIT was only in the nick of time, for a second later and the big mammal\nof the ocean would have struck the ship and split it from stem to\nstern.\n\nHigher and higher into the air mounted the Flying Mermaid, while in\nthe water below, the whale, incensed by missing his prey, was lashing\nthe waves to foam.\n\n\"Well, that was a narrow squeak; as close as I ever care to come to\nit!\" exclaimed Andy as he let go of the steel rail to which he was\nclinging and entered the conning tower. \"I had no idea of hitting the\nbig fish.\"\n\n\"I guess he would have taken after us whether you had fired at him or\nnot,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"He was probably looking for trouble, and\ntook the first thing that came in his way, which happened to be us.\nSome whales are like that, so I have read; big bull creatures, exiled\nfrom the school to which they once belonged, they get like mad\ncreatures and know neither friend nor foe. Something like rogue\nelephants, I imagine.\"\n\nNow, having thus unexpectedly risen into the air, the professor\ndecided to continue travel in that style for a while at least. It\nwould require less force to propel the ship, and the going would be\nmore comfortable, since in the upper regions the Mermaid rode on an\neven keel, while in the water there was more or less rolling, due to\nthe action of the waves.\n\nOnce recovered from their fright caused by the whale, and having lost\nsight of the enormous creature, for they were now far above the ocean,\nthe adventurers began to think of something to eat.\n\nWashington lost little time in preparing a meal, and it was eaten with\na relish. The electric cooking stove worked to perfection, for the\ncolored man had learned how to use that aboard the Porpoise and\nMonarch, and could be depended on to turn out appetizing dishes.\n\n\"What do you say to traveling through the air at night?\" asked Mr.\nHenderson, as he arose from the table.\n\n\"Suits me,\" replied Mark. \"There's less danger than in the water, I\nthink.\"\n\nBill, Tom and Washington arranged to stand the night watch, and, when\nthe professor had examined the engines and given orders about keeping\nthe ship on her course through the air, he retired to his bunk. Jack\nand Mark soon followed.\n\nIt must have been about midnight when Mark was awakened by a movement\nthat seemed to come from the storeroom next to where his sleeping\nplace was located. At first he thought he had been dreaming, but, as\nhe found he was wide awake, he knew it was no imagination that had\naffected him.\n\n\"I certainly heard something,\" he said to himself. \"It sounded just as\nit did the other night. I wonder if I ought to investigate.\"\n\nHe thought over the matter carefully as he sat upright in his bunk in\nthe darkness. True the noise might be a natural one, due to the\nvibration of the engine, or to some echo from the machinery. As Mark\nlistened he heard it again.\n\nThis time he realized it was the slow movement of some heavy body. He\nfelt a cold shiver run over him and his hair evinced an uncomfortable\ntendency to stand upright. But he conquered his feelings and resolved\nto keep cool and see if he could discover what had awakened him.\n\nHe got up and moved softly about the little room that contained his\nbunk. He could hear better now, and knew it was no echo or vibration\nthat had come to his ears.\n\nOnce again he heard the strange sound. It was exactly the same as\nbefore; as if some big creature was pulling itself over the floor.\n\n\"Maybe it's a snake; a water snake!\" thought Mark. \"It may have\ncrawled aboard when we did not notice it.\"\n\nThen he remembered that the ship had not been open in any way that\nwould enable a serpent to come on it, since it had been started on its\nocean trip. Before that, he was sure no snake had entered the Flying\nMermaid. Still it sounded more like a snake than anything else.\n\n\"I'm going to make a search,\" decided the boy.\n\nHe took a small portable electric light, run by a storage battery,\nand, slipping on a pair of shoes and a bath robe, he left his\nstateroom.\n\nHe had decided that the noise came from the storage compartment and so\nmade for that. The door he knew was not locked, since he had seen Mr.\nHenderson go in late that afternoon, and the professor had used no\nkey.\n\nMoving softly, Mark left his room and soon found himself in a\ncorridor, on either side of which were located the sleeping quarters\nof the others. He did not want to awaken them, and, perhaps, be\nlaughed at for his curiosity.\n\nTo get to the storeroom Mark had to go first from the corridor into\nthe dining room. He soon reached the door that guarded what he thought\nmight be a strange secret. Trying the knob softly he found it giving\nunder his fingers.\n\n\"I wonder if I had better go in,\" he thought. \"Perhaps, after all, it\nwas only rats, as Jack said.\"\n\nBut, even as he listened he again heard the odd sound coming from the\nroom. This determined him. He would solve the mystery if possible.\n\nCautiously he turned the knob. The door was slowly swinging open when\nMark was startled by a noise from behind him. He turned suddenly to\nsee Professor Henderson confronting him.\n\n\"What is it, Mark? Is the ship on fire? What's the matter? Is any one\nhurt?\"\n\n\"I was just going in this room to----\" began Mark.\n\n\"Don't do it! Don't do it!\" exclaimed the professor in an excited\nwhisper. \"No one must go in that room. I forgot to tell you and Jack\nabout it. No one must enter. It contains a secret!\"\n\n\"I heard a strange noise and----\" Mark began again.\n\n\"It could make no noise! It would be impossible for it to make a\nnoise!\" the professor exclaimed.\n\n\"I heard something,\" the boy insisted.\n\n\"You were dreaming!\" said the professor. \"Now go back to bed, Mark,\nand don't let this happen again. Remember, no one must enter that room\nunless I give permission!\"\n\nSomewhat crestfallen at the outcome of his investigations, but\nrealizing that the professor could do what he wanted to aboard his own\nship, Mark went back to bed. But he could not sleep. All the rest of\nthe night he was wondering whether Mr. Henderson had some strange\ncreature hidden aboard the Mermaid. He feared lest the old scientist's\nmind might be affected and, in his wildness he had made some infernal\nmachine that would, in time, blow the whole ship apart.\n\nBut tired nature asserted itself at last, and, weary with vain\nimaginings, Mark fell into a slumber. The next morning he awoke with a\nstart from a dream that he was being devoured by an immense water\nsnake.\n\nHe said nothing to the others about his night's adventure, for, as it\ntranspired, no one else had been awakened by his investigations. The\nprofessor did not refer to his conversation with Mark.\n\n\"There's something queer going on aboard the ship this trip,\" said\nMark to himself. \"But I guess it's none of my business. Professor\nHenderson seems to know what he is doing and I guess I can trust him.\"\n\nHe resolved to think no more of the strange noises and movements, and,\nfor several nights thereafter he was not disturbed by them.\n\nThe weather, which, up to this time had been fair, took a sudden turn\nfor the worse about the fourth day after Mark's little night\nexpedition. One evening the sun sank in a mass of dull lead-colored\nclouds and a sharp wind sprang up.\n\n\"We're going to have a storm,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"It's liable to be\na bad one, too, from the way the barometer is falling.\"\n\nHe looked at the glass, and scanned the various instruments that told\nhow high up the Mermaid was and how fast she was traveling.\n\n\"We're pretty high up in the air,\" he said, \"and scooting along at\nabout fifty miles an hour. We are going against the wind, too, but\nfortunately it is not blowing hard.\"\n\nAt that moment there sounded from without a peculiar howling sound, as\nif a siren whistle was being blown.\n\n\"'Pears like there's goin' t' be a tumultuous demonstration of\nsub-maxiliary contortions in th' empherial regions contiguous t' th'\nupper atmosphere!\" exclaimed Washington, entering from the engine room\ninto the conning tower.\n\n\"What's the trouble?\" asked Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"Terrible big black cloud chasin' us from behind!\" exclaimed the\ncolored man.\n\nNoting the alarm in Washington's voice the professor glanced from the\nrear window. What he saw caused him to exclaim:\n\n\"It's a cyclone! We must drop down to avoid it!\"\n\nHe sprang to a lever controlling the gas and yanked it toward him.\nThere was a shrill hissing sound, and a second later the Mermaid began\nto sink. The boys watching the gages on the wall of the tower, saw\nthat the craft was falling rapidly.\n\nBut, with a rush and roar, the terrible wind was upon them. It caught\nthe craft in its fearful grip and heeled it over as a ship careens to\nthe ocean blast.\n\n\"It's a storm in the upper regions! We'll find it calm below!\" cried\nthe professor above the howling of the gale. He opened the gas outlet\nwider and the ship fell more rapidly.\n\n\"Are you sure we're over the ocean?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Positive!\" the professor called back. \"We have been traveling\nstraight south over the Atlantic for the last week. We will land in\nthe midst of the waters and float safely.\"\n\nLower and lower went the Mermaid. The wind was now blowing with the\nforce of a tornado, and, as the craft had to slant in order to\ndescend, it felt the power of the gale more than if it had scudded\nbefore it. But, by skilful use of the directing tube, the professor\nwas able to keep the boat from turning over. As they came further down\ntoward the earth the force of the wind was felt less and less, until,\nas they came within two hundred feet of the water which they saw below\nthem in the gathering dusk, it died out altogether.\n\n\"Now we are free from it,\" said the professor as the Mermaid came down\non the waves like an immense swan.\n\n\"Are you going ahead or going to stop here?\" asked Mark\n\n\"We'll keep right on,\" Mr. Henderson answered. \"No telling when the\nstorm may strike down here. We'll go as far as we can to-night.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nA QUEER SAIL\n\n\nNOW that the fear and worriment was over they all began to feel\nhungry, and, while Mark and Jack took charge of the conning tower\nWashington got breakfast. The professor seemed preoccupied during the\nmeal, and several times, when Mark spoke to him, he did not reply.\n\n\"I wonder if he is worried about something, or is thinking of\nsomething which seems to be concealed in the storeroom,\" the boy\nthought.\n\nBut, after a while, the professor seemed to be more like himself. He\nwas busy over several maps and charts, and then announced the ship\nwould try air-sailing again for a while.\n\n\"We can make better time above than we can on the water,\" he said,\n\"and I am anxious to get to the mysterious island and learn what is in\nstore for us.\"\n\nPerhaps if the professor had been able to look ahead, and see what was\nsoon going to happen, he would not have been so anxious for it to\noccur.\n\nIt was shortly after dinner when, the gas container having been\nfilled, the ship rose in the air, and began sailing over the ocean,\nabout a mile up. The day was a fine one, and, as they were moving\nsouth, it was constantly growing warmer. Down on the water, in fact,\nit was quite hot, but in the air it was just right.\n\nLike some immense bird the Mermaid went flying through the air. The\nboys and the professor sat upon the deck in easy chairs. It was like\nbeing on the top of some tall \"sky-scraper\" building which, by some\nstrange power, was being moved forward. Below them the ocean tumbled\nin long, lazy swells.\n\nSuddenly Mark, who was looking through a telescope at the expanse of\nwater stretched out under them, gave a cry.\n\n\"There's a ship! She's on fire!\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked the professor, stretching out his hand for the glass.\n\n\"Just to the port of the forward tube. See the smoke!\" exclaimed Mark.\n\nMr. Henderson looked. Through the lens he saw a column of black vapor\nrising skyward. Mingled with it were red flames.\n\n\"Lower the Mermaid!\" he cried. \"We must save those on board if we\ncan!\"\n\nMark ran to the conning tower, where Washington was, to give the\norder. The colored man, who was looking ahead, intent on guiding the\nship, did not at first hear what Mark called.\n\n\"Lower us! Send the Mermaid down!\" Mark cried again.\n\nThe sudden shout, and the excited voice of Mark so startled\nWashington, that, fearing some accident had happened, he pulled the\nlever, controlling the gas supply, with more force than necessary.\n\nThere was a loud explosion, followed by a crackling sound, a flash of\nlight, and the Mermaid came to a sudden stop.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" cried Mark, feeling that something was wrong.\n\n\"I don't know!\" Washington replied, as he dashed toward the engine\nroom.\n\nThe Mermaid, her forward flight checked, hung in the air, suspended,\nneither rising or falling.\n\n\"Why don't we go on down?\" the professor asked, hurrying to the tower.\n\n\"There has been an explosion--an accident!\" exclaimed Mark. \"I guess\nwe can't go down!\"\n\n\"But we must!\" Mr. Henderson insisted, seizing the lever which should\nhave produced a downward motion. The handle swung to and fro. It was\ndisconnected from the apparatus it operated.\n\nThe ship was now stationary in the air, moving neither forward nor\nbackward, neither rising nor falling. Washington had stopped the air\npumps as soon as he learned something was wrong.\n\nWhen Mr. Henderson saw the useless lever, which had controlled the\noutlet of gas from the holder, he ran out on deck. One glance told him\nwhat had happened. One of the electric wires had become\nshort-circuited,--that is, the insulation had worn off and allowed\nthe current to escape. This had produced a spark, which had exploded\nthe gas which was in the pipe leading from the generator up into the\naluminum holder. Fortunately there was an automatic cut-off for the\nsupply of vapor, or the whole tank would have gone up.\n\nAs it was, only a small quantity had blown up, but this was enough to\nbreak the machinery at the point where the lever in the conning tower\njoined the pipe. If it had not been for the automatic cut-off all the\ngas in the holder would have poured out in a great volume, and the\nship would have fallen like a shot.\n\n\"Can we do nothing to save those on the burning vessel?\" asked Mark,\npointing to where a cloud of smoke hung over the ocean.\n\n\"I fear not, now,\" answered the professor. \"We are in a bad plight\nourselves.\"\n\n\"Are we in any danger?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Not specially,\" Mr. Henderson replied. \"But we must find a means of\nlowering ourselves gradually.\"\n\n\"Then it will be too late to save any of those on the ship,\" observed\nMark.\n\n\"I'm afraid so,\" the scientist made reply.\n\nThe Mermaid rested some distance above the surface of the waters. She\nmoved slightly to and fro with the wind, and rocked gently. The\nprofessor was examining the broken machinery.\n\n\"I have a plan!\" suddenly cried Mark.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"Can't we bore a hole in the tank, insert a small faucet or tap, and\nlet the gas out that way gradually?\" asked the boy. \"When we get down\nwe can rescue those in danger of fire, and, later, can repair the\nbreak.\"\n\n\"The very thing!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson. \"I never thought of that!\nHere, Washington! Bring me a drill, and a small stop-cock!\"\n\nThe drill was obtained from the engine room. Working rapidly Mr.\nHenderson bored a hole in the lower part of the holder. As soon as the\nmetal was penetrated the gas, which was under considerable pressure,\nrushed from the tank with a hissing sound. At once the Mermaid began\nto settle rapidly.\n\nBut the professor was prepared for this. He thrust the end of the\nstop-cock into the hole. It was screwed fast and the valve turned.\nThis stopped the flow of gas and checked the descent of the ship.\nThen, by opening the tap the vapor was allowed to escape gradually,\nbringing the Flying Mermaid gently to the water.\n\nAs the adventurers approached they could see that the vessel was now a\nmass of flames. The wind was driving the fire toward the forecastle,\nand the crew had sought refuge aft. But this expedient could not last\nlong, for, already the tongues of fire were licking the sides of the\ncraft and coming nearer and nearer the seemingly doomed men. The\nvessel was a large one, and heavily laden.\n\nAs those in peril caught sight of the Mermaid settling down into the\nwater, apparently from the clouds, their fears gave place to\nastonishment. So great was this that they ceased their cries of\nterror. Then, as they saw that the strange craft navigated the ocean,\nfor the engines were started aboard the Mermaid, they began to call\nfor help.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE FLYING MERMAID DISABLED\n\n\n\"WE'LL save you!\" shouted Mr. Henderson, who was on the deck, while\nMark was steering the craft. \"Hold on a few minutes longer and we'll\nbe alongside!\"\n\n\"They're real! They're real!\" some of those aboard the burning ship\ncould be heard to shout. Evidently more than one of them had taken the\nMermaid for a delusion of their fear-crazed brain.\n\n\"They are real persons!\" they called again and again. \"They are coming\nto save us!\"\n\nMr. Henderson ran his ship as near the burning craft as he dared. Then\nhe called to the crew to leap into the water and swim to him. He, with\nWashington, Jack, Bill and Tom, stood ready to haul aboard any who\nwere too weak to help themselves.\n\nIn a few minutes all of those left alive on the sailing vessel--fourteen\nin all--had come safely aboard the Mermaid. The ship was now\ncompletely enveloped in flames.\n\n\"Are there any more left on her?\" asked Mr. Henderson of one who\nappeared to be a mate of the burning craft.\n\n\"Not a soul!\" was the answer. \"The captain and ten men perished in the\nflames. The fire broke out a week ago in the lower hold. We fought it\nas well as we could but it got the best of us. Then it suddenly broke\nthrough the decks, almost like an explosion, a little while ago, and\nthe captain and others were lost, and so were our small boats. We\nmanaged to get aft but were about to give up when you appeared.\"\n\n\"What ship is it and where are you from?\"\n\n\"The Good Hope, laden with logwood, hides, jute and other materials\nfrom South America,\" the mate answered. \"We were bound for New York.\"\n\n\"It is more like the Last Hope instead of the Good Hope,\" observed Mr.\nHenderson in a quiet voice, as he saw the flames mount higher and\nhigher over the ship. A few seconds later the craft seemed rent by an\ninternal explosion. It appeared to break in two parts, and, amid a\nshower of sparks and a cloud of black smoke, the vessel sank under the\nwater and was seen no more.\n\nThe rescued men turned to behold the final end of their ship. They\nbetrayed no particular emotion, and some of them even laughed, which\nthe professor thought, at the time, was rather strange. But there was\nlittle opportunity for speculation. The men were in a sad plight. Few\nof them had more than the clothes they stood in, though each one wore\nabout his waist a belt, and all of them seemed to guard the leather\ncirclets jealously.\n\nThe professor and his crew were soon busy supplying remedies for\nburns, since several of the men were seared by the flames. Then, as it\nwas learned they had eaten nothing for many hours, it having been\nimpossible to use the galley, a meal was prepared and the survivors of\nthe wreck were well fed.\n\nThe hunger of the newcomers having been appeased, they showed much\ncuriosity over the strange craft that had so opportunely come to their\nrescue. Most of the sailors were ignorant men, and the professor had\nlittle fear of them learning anything concerning his secrets. He\nexplained briefly about the Mermaid, but said nothing of whither she\nwas bound.\n\nThe addition of fourteen men to the rather small accommodations of the\nMermaid was a serious matter to consider. The ship was able to hold\nthem all, and even to sail through the air with them, since Mr.\nHenderson had provided an excess of power. But it was going to be a\nproblem to feed so many, and still save enough provisions, for the\nlong voyage which lay ahead.\n\nHowever, Mr. Henderson felt his first duty to be toward his fellowmen,\neven if his voyage must be delayed, or given up for a time, while he\ngot more provisions. There would be no sleeping quarters for the\nsailors, but when this was explained to them they cheerfully said they\nwould sleep on deck if necessary. In fact some of them had to, but as\nthe weather was warm and clear this was no hardship. A few found\nquarters in the engine room and other apartments of the Mermaid.\n\nFinding, after an examination, that his ship was in good order save\nfor the broken gas apparatus, Mr. Henderson gave orders to proceed\nalong the surface of the ocean. The sailors wanted to see how it felt\nto mount into the air, but Mr. Henderson, refused to attempt a flight\nuntil he had made complete repairs, and this would take a day or more.\n\nAt this there appeared to be some discontent among the survivors, and\nthey muttered to each other as they stood in a group on deck. But the\nprofessor and his assistants were too busy with their preparations for\nfixing the break to notice this.\n\nWhile the men were gathered in a knot near the after part of the small\ndeck, the mate separated from them, and, coming close to where Mark\nwas standing, unscrewing some of the broken parts of the pipe said, in\na low voice.\n\n\"Tell the captain to watch out.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Mark quickly.\n\n\"Hush! Not so loud!\" the mate exclaimed. \"If the men hear me talking\nto you, or see me, they may kill me. Tell the captain to look out;\nthat's all. Be on guard, and watch the engine room carefully.\"\n\n\"But why--?\" Mark began, when, turning suddenly, the mate left him.\nIt was well he did so, for, at that instant, one of the sailors, who\nhad observed the two conversing, strolled in their direction.\n\nMuch alarmed, Mark sought Mr. Henderson and told him what he had\nheard.\n\n\"I suppose the fire may have turned the poor man's head,\" the\nscientist said. \"I wonder if he thinks the men I rescued would mutiny\nand take possession of my ship? If they did they would not know how to\nwork it, so what good would it do?\"\n\n\"Hadn't we better look out?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"I'm not afraid,\" replied the professor. \"I will be too busy the next\nfew days, repairing the break, to think of anything else. Besides,\nwhat would they want to harm us for? Didn't we save their lives?\"\n\nSeeing the scientist placed no faith in what the mate had said, Mark\nwent back to his task.\n\nIt soon became too dark to work, and it was decided, after supper, to\nhalt the ship until morning as it would be less risky.\n\nMark did not sleep well, his dreams being disturbed by visions of\npirates and black flags. But morning came and nothing had developed.\nThe men seemed to recover their spirits with daybreak, and mast of the\ncrew, after breakfast, greeted Mr. Henderson pleasantly, and asked to\nbe allowed to help fix the ship.\n\nIt took the skilled labor of the professor, Washington and the boys to\nmend the break, and, even at that, it was four days in the repairing.\nBut at last the final bolt was in place, and the Mermaid was able to\nresume her trips through the air.\n\n\"We will rise the first thing in the morning,\" said the professor to\nMark and Jack that night. \"I am anxious to see how the ship behaves\nwith a big load aboard.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE MUTINY\n\n\nMARK was awakened that night by feeling some one trying to turn him\nover. At first he thought it was Jack, and sleepily muttered that he\nwanted to be let alone.\n\n\"Sorry I can't oblige ye, my hearty!\" exclaimed a rough voice in his\near, \"but I got particular orders t' tie you up!\"\n\nAt that Mark tried to sit up, but he found he could not. He discovered\nthat he was closely bound with many turns of a rope, while in front of\nhis bunk stood one of the rescued sailors.\n\n\"There,\" said the man, with a final tightening of the ropes. \"I guess\nyou're safe.\"\n\n\"What's the matter? What does it all mean?\" asked Mark, much\nbewildered.\n\n\"It means that we have possession of the ship,\" the sailor answered,\n\"and, if you're wise you'll not make a fuss. It wouldn't do any good,\nanyhow, as all your friends are in the same condition.\"\n\nThen, picking Mark up, as if he was a baby, the man slung him over his\nshoulder and carried him to the living room. There Mark saw Jack, the\nprofessor, Washington, and the others similarly bound.\n\n\"Do you realize what you are doing?\" asked the professor angrily of\nhis captors. \"You are mutinying, and are liable to severe punishment.\"\n\n\"If they ever get us,\" added one of the men. \"We've got the ship now,\nand we mean to keep her. You'll have to run her or show us how.\"\n\n\"Never!\" cried the professor.\n\n\"I guess he will when he feels this,\" said one of the men, as he\ndragged from a recess two wires. \"I happen to know something of\nelectricity, and when he feels these perhaps he'll change his mind.\nI'll start the dynamo.\"\n\nThe sailor showed that he was acquainted with machinery, for soon the\nhum of the electric apparatus was heard.\n\n\"Now to make him tell!\" the man with the wires exclaimed, advancing\ntoward the professor, who turned pale.\n\n\"Stop! You must not torture the old man!\" cried a voice, and the mate\nof the Good Hope stepped in front of the sailor with the electrified\nwires.\n\n\"Who's going to stop me?\" asked the man.\n\n\"I will. It's not necessary,\" the mate went on quickly. \"If we make\nhim weak we may kill him, and he can not tell us what we want to know.\nOne of the boys can tell us how to run the ship.\"\n\nThe mate came quickly over to where Mark lay, and whispered:\n\n\"Consent to tell. It is the only way of saving his life. Tell 'em how\nto raise the craft. Then leave all to me. I will save you all and the\nship, too, if I can. But consent.\"\n\nMark nodded his head, and the mate cried:\n\n\"I knew I could fetch 'em. I have hypnotic power. This boy will raise\nthe ship for us. Loosen his bonds, some of you.\"\n\nSatisfied that they were now on the way to experiencing a new\nsensation, the sailors took the ropes off Mark's arms and legs, and he\nwas allowed to rise. With a reassuring nod toward the professor he led\nthe way to the engine room, followed by half the men. He resolved to\nstart the gas machine slowly, so as to make the upward trip last\nlonger, thinking before it had gone far, some way of escape from the\nmutineers might be found.\n\nWhile a crowd of the sailors stood near him, Mark operated the\nmachinery in the engine room that started the gas generating, and set\nthe negative gravity apparatus working.\n\n\"You'd better not try any tricks on us,\" said one of the men in an\nugly tone of voice.\n\n\"I'm not going to,\" replied Mark. \"If you go out on deck you will soon\nsee the ship leaving the water and mounting into the air.\"\n\n\"Some of you go,\" ordered a man with a big bushy red beard. \"See if\nthe ship rises. When she begins to go up sing out. I'm going to stay\nhere and see how the young cub does it so I can work it myself.\"\n\nObeying the red-bearded man, who seemed to be a leader, several of the\nsailors went out on the deck. It was quite dark, but there was a\nphosphorous glow to the water which made the rolling waves visible.\n\nThe gas was being generated, as could be told by the hissing sound.\nMark watched the machinery anxiously, for he knew much depended on\nhim, and the professor was not at hand to guide and instruct him. He\nwatched the dial of the gage which registered the gas pressure and saw\nit slowly moving. In a little while it would be at the point at which\nthe ship ought to rise.\n\nPresently a quiver seemed to run through the Mermaid. Now a shout came\nfrom the watchers on deck.\n\n\"She's going up!\"\n\nThe ship was indeed rising. The red-bearded man, who was addressed as\nTony, ran from the engine room to the deck. He saw that the ship was\nnow ten feet above the water. Back he came to where Mark stood by the\ngas machine.\n\n\"Lucky for you that you didn't fool us, lad,\" he said with a leer.\n\"See that you mind me hereafter. Now show me how the shebang works.\"\n\nWhen the ship had risen as far as Tony desired he made Mark send it\nstraight ahead. The boy adjusted the air tube to carry the craft\ntoward the south, but Tony, seeing by a compass in which direction\nthey were headed, ordered Mark to steer due east.\n\n\"Fix things so they will stay so, too,\" added Tony. \"I don't want to\nstop until I get a thousand miles away. Then we'll come down, sail to\nsome sunny island, and enjoy life.\"\n\nMark locked the steering apparatus so as to keep the Mermaid headed\ndue east.\n\n\"Now you can go back to your friends,\" Tony said. \"When I want you\nI'll send for you.\"\n\nWith a heavy heart Mark rejoined the professor and others. He found\nthem with their bonds removed. But to guard against their escape\nseveral men were on watch outside the door.\n\n\"What are they doing?\" asked the professor eagerly as Mark entered,\nand the boy told him what had taken place.\n\n\"They will ruin my ship and spoil the whole trip,\" cried the old\nscientist. \"Oh, why did I ever go to the rescue of the scoundrels?\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Jack. \"Perhaps we may yet outwit them.\"\n\nMorning came at last. The ship was still shooting forward at fast\nspeed, in an easterly direction. The sailors had learned, in their\nshort stay aboard, where the food and stores were kept, and they lost\nlittle time in getting breakfast. They sent same in to their captives,\nincluding a big pot of hot coffee, and, after partaking of this the\nprofessor and his friends felt better.\n\nThe mate of the Good Hope came in to help clear away the dishes. As he\npassed Mark he slipped into the boy's hand a note.\n\n\"Don't read it until you are alone,\" he said in a low voice, as he\nhurried from the room.\n\nAs soon as the other sailors had left, Mark glanced at the slip of\npaper. It bore these words:\n\n  \"Open when you hear three raps, then two, then three, and keep\n  silent.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Mr. Henderson.\n\nMark showed him the paper.\n\n\"I wonder what it means,\" the boy said.\n\n\"Do you think he is a friend of ours?\" the professor asked.\n\nMark told him of the mate's conversation the night previous.\n\n\"I think we can trust him,\" the scientist went on. \"He must intend to\npay us a visit when the others are asleep. When we hear the knocks as\nhe specifies we must open the door and let him in.\"\n\nAll that day the captives were kept in the living room. Once or twice\nMark was sent for to make some adjustment to the machinery, but the\napparatus, for the most part, was automatic, and needed little\nattention. The professor, as well as the others, were all impatience\nfor the promised visit of the mate. Still they felt he would not come\nuntil night.\n\nIn fact it was long past midnight before Mark, Jack and the professor,\nwho were anxiously listening, heard the three raps, then two, then\nthree more. Mark quickly opened the door, and the mate stepped inside,\nholding his finger to his lips as a sign of caution. Old Andy,\nWashington, Bill and Tom had fallen asleep.\n\n\"I have only time for a few words,\" the mate said. \"I am closely\nwatched. Tony mistrusts me. I will save you if I can.\"\n\n\"Why have they repaid my kindness with such actions?\" asked Mr.\nHenderson.\n\n\"Because they are desperate men,\" replied the mate. \"They are nothing\nmore than pirates. They mutinied on the other ship, killed the captain\nand those of the crew who would not join them, and started off to seek\ntheir fortunes. I pretended to join them to save my life, but I have\nonly been watching for a chance to escape.\n\n\"Because of lax discipline the ship was sent on fire. We tried to put\nit out but could not. The rest you know.\"\n\n\"I heard them plan to capture this airship, but could do nothing to\nstop them. Then I resolved to pretend to act with them. They fear\npursuit for their other mutiny, and are anxious to get as far away as\npossible.\"\n\n\"Do you think they will abandon the ship in a little while?\" asked the\nprofessor hopefully.\n\n\"I'm afraid not,\" answered the mate. \"I think they want to get rid of\nall of you, so they can sail about as they please. Tony is a smart\nman. He could soon learn to run this ship, he thinks.\"\n\n\"I doubt it,\" Mr. Henderson answered. \"But how are you going to help\nus?\"\n\n\"I have not fully made up my plans,\" the mate answered. \"However I\nwanted you to know I would do my best to save you. Now I must go. Be\non the watch and when I can I will let you know what I have decided\non. I will hand Mark a note when I bring your meals, just as I did\nto-day. I think----\"\n\n\"Hark! What was that?\" asked the professor.\n\nThere was a noise outside the door, as if some one was listening.\n\n\"Put out the lights!\" whispered the mate, and Jack switched off the\nelectric incandescents.\n\nA knock sounded on the door and the voice of Tony called:\n\n\"Mark! Come here! I want you to look at the gas machine. It has\nstopped working, and we are falling!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nFOOLING THEIR ENEMIES\n\n\nMARK hurried into the corridor, taking care to close the door after\nhim, so Tony could get no glimpse of the mate who had risked so much\nto save his friends. But he need not have been alarmed for the leader\nof the mutineers was too excited over the stopping of the gas\napparatus to give any heed to who was in with the captives.\n\n\"Do you think you can fix it?\" he asked the boy.\n\n\"I guess so,\" Mark replied confidently. \"If I can't there is no\ndanger, for we will fall gradually and land in the water.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to do that,\" Tony objected. \"I want to keep on\nthrough the air.\"\n\nMark did not reply. By this time he was at the gas machine. He soon\nsaw nothing was the matter save that new material must be placed in\nthe retort where the vapor was generated. He refilled it, the gas was\nmanufactured once more, and the ship began to rise.\n\n\"I will know how to do it next time,\" Tony said with a grin. Mark\nrealized that every time he showed the leader of the mutineers\nsomething about the ship it was putting the professor and his friends\nmore and more into the power of the scoundrels. But there was no help\nfor it.\n\nThe ship was still plunging ahead, and kept about a mile above the\nearth. As there was no further need of Mark, he was told he could go\nback to his friends. When he reached the room where they were held\nprisoners, he found the mate had gone away, promising again to do all\nhe could for them.\n\nThe next night, which it seemed would never come, for the day, locked\nas the captives were in their room, seemed endless, finally closed in.\nMark, Jack and the professor were anxious to know whether the mate\nwould pay them another visit. As for Andy, Tom and Bill, while they\nwere interested in the ship, and wanted to be free from the power of\nthe mutineers, they did not lose any sleep over it.\n\nShortly after midnight, there came again the peculiar knock, and the\nmate entered the room. He seemed much excited over something, and, as\nsoon as the portal was securely closed he said to Professor Henderson:\n\n\"Is there an island any where near here where men could live for a\ntime?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked the scientist. \"Do you want us to desert the\nship and leave these scoundrels in charge?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort,\" replied the mate, who, had said his name was\nJack Rodgers. \"But first answer my question. A great deal may depend\non it.\"\n\nSeeing Rodgers was in earnest, the professor looked over some maps and\ncharts, and announced that they were within a few hundred miles of a\ngroup of islands.\n\n\"When would we reach them?\" was Rodgers's next question.\n\nMr. Henderson made a few rapid calculations on a piece of paper.\n\n\"At the present rate of sailing,\" he said, \"we should be there about\nten o'clock to-morrow. That is, provided the ship does not slacken\nspeed or increase it.\"\n\n\"There is no danger of either of those two things happening,\" said the\nmate. \"Tony is too afraid of the machinery to do anything to it. So\nyou may safely figure that our speed will continue the same.\"\n\n\"Then I can guarantee, with all reasonable certainty,\" the professor\nsaid, \"that about ten o'clock to-morrow we will be less than a mile\nfrom the islands. They are a group where friendly natives live, and\nwhere many tropical fruits abound. One could scarcely select a better\nplace to be shipwrecked. But I hope the plans of Tony and his friends\ndo not include landing us there.\"\n\n\"No, nothing like that,\" the mate answered. \"Quite the contrary. But I\nhad better be going. I will try and see Mark some time to-morrow. Tony\ndoes not mind when I speak to him.\"\n\nWith this Rodgers left the captives, as he heard some of the sailors\nmoving about and did not want to be discovered. The professor and the\nboys wondered what the mate's plan might be, but they had to be\ncontent to wait and see.\n\nThe night passed without incident. About nine o'clock the next morning\nthe mate came to the door of the room where the professor and his\nfriends were prisoners. He made no secret of his approach, but knocked\nboldly.\n\n\"Tell Mark I want to see him,\" he said, as the professor answered.\n\"All of you keep quiet,\" he added in a whisper. \"There may be good\nnews soon.\"\n\nMark slipped from the room. He followed the mate to the upper deck\nwhich, at that time was deserted as all the sailors were in the dining\nroom eating, which practice they indulged in as often as they could.\n\n\"I have a plan to get rid of these rough men,\" the mate said to Mark.\n\"It may work, and, again it may not. At any rate it is worth trying,\nIt all depends on you with what help I can give you.\"\n\n\"I'm willing to do my share,\" Mark said, and for the next ten minutes\nthe boy and the mate were in earnest conversation.\n\nIt was about thirty-five minutes later when there arose a sudden\ncommotion in the ship. Mark had returned to his friends and the mate\nhad disappeared. The confusion seemed to come from the engine room\nwhere Tony had posted some of his men.\n\n\"We're falling down! We'll all be killed!\" shouted the men. \"The ship\nis falling into the sea!\"\n\n\"What is the trouble?\" asked the professor as he heard the commotion.\n\n\"It is part of the mate's plan,\" said Mark. \"He told me to tell you to\ndo nothing. If Tony or any of the other men come to you just refer\nthem to me.\"\n\nTwo minutes later Tony came rushing into the apartment where the\ncaptives were held prisoners.\n\n\"Here! Come quickly, Mark!\" he exclaimed. \"Something has gone wrong\nwith the gas machine again, and you must come and fix it before we are\nall dashed to pieces!\"\n\nWith every appearance of haste Mark rushed from the apartment,\nfollowing Tony. The latter led the way to the engine room.\n\n\"Can anything be done?\" he asked.\n\nMark took a survey of the machinery.\n\n\"It is too late,\" he said as though much excited. \"The ship is falling\ndown toward the sea with terrific force.\"\n\nIt needed but a glance at the height gage to show this. The pointer\nwas revolving rapidly about the face of the dial.\n\n\"Will the ship stand the blow?\" asked Tony.\n\n\"Not at the rate it is falling,\" replied Mark. \"She will go all to\npieces when she strikes the water, and she may explode!\"\n\n\"What are we to do then?\" asked the leader of the mutineers.\n\n\"We must save ourselves!\" cried the mate, running in at this juncture.\n\"Let our prisoners shift for themselves as best they can. Let's all\nleap into the sea. There we at least have a chance for our lives. But\nif we stay on this ship we will all be drowned like cats in a bag.\"\n\n\"What do you propose?\" asked Tony, his face white with fear.\n\n\"When the ship comes near enough the surface of the water to make it\nsafe we should all drop overboard!\" the mate exclaimed. \"We are near\nsome islands, I understand, and we can thus save our lives by swimming\nashore.\"\n\nThis plan seemed to meet with instant favor, and a little later there\nwas a rush for the deck, as each one wished to be the first to escape\nfrom the boat they believed to be doomed.\n\nLower and lower fell the Mermaid. She was like a wounded bird which\nthe shot of the hunter has crippled. Down and down she fluttered.\n\nBy this time all the sailors, save the mate were on deck. He and Mark\nremained in the engine room.\n\n\"Don't let her get too low,\" the mate whispered.\n\n\"I'll watch out,\" Mark replied. \"I want to give them a good scare\nwhile I'm at it.\"\n\nThe ship was now within fifty feet of the water. There was a cry of\nterror from the sailors. Some of them leaped over the rail and started\nto swim ashore, as the ship was by this time close to a group of\nislands.\n\nSuddenly, from the engine room the mate rushed.\n\n\"Jump! Jump for your lives!\" he exclaimed. \"The ship is about to blow\nup!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nMYSTERIOUS HAPPENINGS\n\n\nTHE voice of the mate echoed through the Mermaid. Those on deck heard\nit, as did Tony in the engine room, where he was vainly trying to\nunderstand the complicated machinery.\n\nAn instant later there sounded from beneath the ship a series of\nsplashes. More sailors were leaping from the deck of the craft to the\nocean. The distance was not great, particularly as they all landed in\nwater.\n\n\"Quick!\" cried the mate to a group of sailors that hesitated before\ntaking the jump. \"The ship may blow up any minute now.\"\n\nThe men needed no second urging. As soon as they struck the water they\nbegan to swim ashore, as it was not far away. One after another they\njumped over the rail. Tony was the last to go. He urged the captives\nto follow him, but they all refused.\n\nA minute later the only one of the pirate crew left on the ship was\nthe mate. The others were all struggling in the sea. Eventually they\nall reached shore in safety.\n\nThe airship was now within about twenty feet of the water. It was\nstill falling but not so rapidly.\n\n\"Better send her up, now,\" said the mate to Mark, and the boy turned\nthe necessary levers to accomplish this.\n\nDipping into the water as a sea gull does when searching for food on\nthe wing, for she had come quite low, the Mermaid mounted once more\ninto the air, and was soon sailing along over the heads of Tony and\nhis gang.\n\n\"What's it all about?\" asked Mr. Henderson, who seemed in a sort of\nstupor. \"I thought the ship was broken. How, then, can it rise?\"\n\n\"It was only a trick of mine,\" Rodgers said. \"The gas machine is not\nbroken. I had Mark fix it so that only a little vapor would be\ngenerated. When the supply in the holder was not enough, and no more\nwas being made, the ship had to sink. Mark and I pretended it was\nworse than it really was just to scare the scoundrels.\"\n\n\"And you evidently succeeded,\" observed Mr. Henderson. \"They have all\nleft us. I am glad you stayed.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" said Rodgers. \"I was just waiting for a chance to escape\nfrom that crowd. This was the plan I thought of that night. I wanted\nto see the men put on some island where they could manage to live, and\nwhich was not too far away.\"\n\nThe Mermaid was now mounting upward rapidly, as Mark had adjusted the\nmachinery properly. The craft was well rid of the pirate crew, and was\nable to proceed on its way, and enable Mr. Henderson to carry out his\nplans.\n\nWhen the Mermaid had reached a certain height her prow was turned the\nother way, and she was sent back racing over the ground she had just\ncovered. But now the ship was in the hands of friends. Fortunately no\ngreat damage had been done by the sailors, and the professor was soon\nable to get things in ship-shape. The engines had not been molested\nand were working better than ever.\n\n\"Now to make another attempt to reach the big hole in the earth,\" the\nprofessor cried. \"We will be careful next time, who we rescue from\nships at sea.\"\n\nThe island was soon left behind, becoming a mere speck on the ocean.\nThose aboard the Mermaid knew no harm could befall the sailors, as\nthere were no savage tribes on the little spot of land. Eventually the\nsailors were picked up by a passing vessel and taken to their homes.\nThe story of their first mutiny leaked out and they were properly\npunished.\n\nIt required several days travel before the airship regained the\ndistance she had lost because of the plans of the pirates. Also, there\nwere a number of minor repairs to make, and the professor and his\nfriends were kept busy.\n\n\"How much longer before we come to the big hole?\" asked Jack, one day.\n\n\"I think we ought to be near it in about two weeks,\" the professor\nreplied. \"I only hope we shall not be disappointed, and will be able\nto explore it.\"\n\n\"'Tain't goin' t' be no fun t' be decimated an' expurgitated inter a\nconglomerous aggregation of elements constituting th' exterior portion\nof human anatomy,\" said Washington in dubious tones.\n\n\"You mean you're afraid of being boiled in the steam from the big\nhole?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Jest so,\" replied the colored man.\n\n\"You don't need to worry about that,\" put in the professor. \"I will\nnot take the ship down if there is any danger, though of course there\nwill be some risk.\"\n\nThe ship, having been fully repaired, was now able to be speeded up,\nand was sent scudding along toward her destination. Rodgers proved a\nvaluable acquisition toward the crew, for he had sailed many years in\nthe waters over which they were flying, and was able to give the\nprofessor many valuable hints. He had heard vague stories of the\nisland with the big hole, but had never been near it. He did not make\nthe trip however, as, at his request, he was put off at an inhabited\nisland one night.\n\nIt was about a week after the sailors were frightened from the ship,\nthat a curious experience befell Mark. Washington was on duty in the\nconning tower, attending to the apparatus as the ship flew through the\nair, and all the others had gone to bed. Mark had remained up, later\nthan the others as he was interested in reading a book on science.\n\nAbout ten o'clock he became hungry, and going to the pantry got some\nbread and cold meat. He set these on a table, and then, remembering he\nwould need some water to drink, started after some in the cooler,\nwhich was in a little room near the tower.\n\nWashington heard the boy as he turned the faucet to draw the liquid,\nand spoke to him, as the colored man was rather lonesome at his post.\nMark did not linger more than a minute or two, but when he returned to\nwhere he had left the food he was much surprised.\n\nThere was not a trace of it to be seen. The dishes were on the table,\nbut every vestige of bread and meat had disappeared.\n\n\"I wonder if a cat or dog has been here,\" was Mark's first thought.\nThen he remembered that no such animals were aboard the Mermaid.\n\nSomething on the floor caught his eye. He stooped and picked it up. It\nwas a slice of bread, but in such shape that the boy stared at it,\npuzzled as to how it could have become so.\n\nIt was flattened out quite thin, but the strangest part of it was that\nit bore what seemed to be the marks of thumb and fingers from a very\nlarge hand. So big, in fact, was the print, that Mark's hand scarce\ncovered half of it, and, where the bread had been squeezed into a\nputty like mass (for it was quite fresh) the peculiar markings on the\nskin of the tips of the fingers were visible.\n\n\"It looks as if a giant grabbed this slice of bread,\" Mark observed.\n\"There are strange happenings aboard this ship. I wish I knew what\nthey meant.\"\n\nHe looked all around for the food, thinking perhaps a rat had dragged\nit off, but there was no trace of it.\n\nSuddenly the boy thought he heard a sound from the big storeroom. He\nwas almost sure he heard something moving in there. He started toward\nthe door when he was stopped by hearing the professor's voice call:\n\n\"Don't open that door, Mark. Have I not told you that place must not\nbe entered?\"\n\n\"I thought I heard some one in there,\" Mark replied.\n\n\"There is nothing in there but some apparatus of mine,\" Mr. Henderson\nsaid. \"I want no one to see it. What is the matter?\"\n\nMark explained matters to the scientist, who had, as he said later,\narisen on hearing the boy, moving about.\n\n\"Oh, it was a rat that took your stuff,\" Mr. Henderson said. \"I guess\nthere are some pretty big ones on the ship. Get some more food and go\nto sleep.\"\n\nMark felt it best to obey, though he was by no means satisfied with\nthe professor's explanation. He listened intently to see if any more\nnoises came from the storeroom, but none did, and he went to bed.\n\nSeveral times after that Mark tried the experiment of leaving food\nabout. On each occasion it was taken.\n\n\"It looks as if the ship was haunted,\" he said. \"Of course I know it\nisn't, but it's very queer. They must be strange rats that can get\nfood from shelves when there is only the smooth side of the ship to\nclimb up,\" for on some occasions Mark had tried the experiment of\nputting the food as nearly out of reach as possible.\n\nIt took several nights to learn all this, and, as he did not want to\ntake any one into his confidence, he had to work in secret. But, with\nall his efforts he learned nothing, save that there was something odd\nabout the ship that he could not fathom.\n\nAt first he believed the professor had some strange animal concealed\nin the storeroom, but he dismissed this idea almost as soon as he\nthought of it. For what could the scientist want with an animal when\nthey were going to the interior of the earth? That some beast had\nslipped aboard was out of the question. Mark was much puzzled, but\nfinally, deciding the matter did not concern him a great deal, gave up\ntrying to solve the mystery, at least for a time.\n\nThe ship was now in the neighborhood of the equator and the climate\nhad become much warmer. So hot indeed were some nights that they slept\nout on deck, with the Mermaid flying through the air at a moderate\npace, for it was deemed best not to go at any great speed after dark.\n\nOne night the professor, after consulting various charts and maps, and\nmaking calculations which covered several sheets of paper announced:\n\n\"We should sight the mysterious island to-morrow.\"\n\n\"That's good news!\" exclaimed Jack. \"I'm anxious to see what's below\ninside of that big hole.\"\n\n\"Everybody git ready for their funerals!\" exclaimed Washington in a\ndeep voice. \"I ain't got many----\"\n\n\"Cheer up,\" interrupted Jack, poking Washington in the ribs. The\ncolored man was very ticklish, and he began to laugh heartily, though,\nperhaps, he did not feel like it.\n\nSuddenly, above the sound of his shouts, there came a crashing,\ngrinding noise from the engine room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE BIG HOLE\n\n\n\"SOMETHING has gone wrong!\" exclaimed the professor as he jumped up.\nHe reached the engine room ahead of any one else, and when the two\nboys got there they found him busy twisting wheels and shifting\nlevers.\n\n\"Anything serious?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"It's the gas machine again,\" Mr. Henderson replied. \"It broke where\nwe fixed it. However it doesn't matter. I was going to lower the ship\nanyhow, as I want to approach the island from the water. We will go\ndown a little sooner than I counted on.\"\n\nThe disabling of the gas machine caused the vapor to escape slowly\nfrom the tank, and this made the ship sink gradually. By means of the\nemergency stop-cock the descent could be controlled almost as well as\nthough the machinery was in working order. Half an hour later the\nMermaid rested on the water.\n\nIt was a little rough, as there was quite a swell on, and not so\npleasant as floating in the air on an even keel, but they made the\nbest of it.\n\nOn account of the little accident, and not being certain of its\nextent, it was deemed best not to send the ship ahead. So they laid to\nuntil morning.\n\nFor the better part of two days all those on board the Mermaid had\ntheir hands full mending the break and making other repairs found\nnecessary. In that time they lay to, floating idly with the currents,\nor blown by the wind, for the professor would not start any of the\nengines or apparatus until the ship was in good condition.\n\nIn this time Mark had several times recalled the curious happenings in\nregard to the disappearing food, and the mystery of the storeroom. But\nthere were no further manifestations, and no other signs that there\nmight be a strange visitor aboard.\n\n\"I couldn't have imagined it all,\" said Mark, \"but I guess what did\nhappen may have been caused by natural means, only I can't discover\nthem.\"\n\nIt was about two days after this, the ship having sailed scores of\nmiles on the surface of the water, that Mark, who was in the conning\ntower exclaimed:\n\n\"That looks like a waterspout ahead of us.\"\n\n\"That's what it is!\" Jack agreed. \"What shall we do?\"\n\n\"Call the professor!\" said Mark. \"He'll know.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Henderson came, he looked for a long time at a cloud of black\nvapor which hung low in the east.\n\n\"It may be a waterspout,\" he said. \"We'll rise in the air and see if\nwe can avoid it.\"\n\nThe ship was sent up into the air. As it rose higher and higher, the\nprofessor, making frequent observations from his conning tower, cried\nout:\n\n\"That is no waterspout!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"It is the steam and vapor rising from the big hole in the earth!\nBoys, we are almost there!\"\n\n\"Are you sure that's it?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Almost positive,\" Mr. Henderson replied. \"You can see how much warmer\nit has become of late, as we approached the equator. We are almost due\nat the island, and I have no doubt we have reached it.\"\n\nAs the ship flew forward the mass of dark vapor became more\npronounced. Through the glasses it could be noticed to consist of\nrolling masses of clouds. What lay beneath them no one knew. The\nadventurers were going to try to find out.\n\nNow that they had arrived at the beginning of the main part of their\njourney, the travelers felt their spirits sink a little. It was one\nthing to plan to go down into the depths of the earth, but it was\nquite another to make the actual attempt. Still, they were not going\nto give up the project. The professor had confidence in his ship and\nbelieved it could safely make the trip. Still it was with no little\napprehension that Mr. Henderson watched the nearer approach of the\ncraft to that strange island.\n\n\"Perfesser, are yo' really an' truly goin' t' depress this elongated\nspheroid an' its human consignment int' that conglomerous convoluted\nmass of gaseous vapor regardless of th' consequences?\" asked\nWashington, as he gazed with wide opened eyes at the sight before him.\n\n\"If you mean am I going to let the Mermaid go down into that hole you\nare perfectly correct,\" the scientist answered, \"though you could have\nsaid it in fewer words, Washington.\"\n\n\"I--I guess I'll get out an' walk,\" the colored man made reply.\n\n\"This isn't any trolley car,\" observed Mark. \"Don't lose your nerve,\nWash. Stay with us, and we'll discover a gold or diamond mine, maybe.\"\n\n\"Is there diamonds down there?\" asked the colored man, his fright\nseeming to leave him.\n\n\"There are all sorts of things inside the earth,\" the professor\nanswered.\n\n\"Then I'm goin' along!\" Washington declared. \"I always did want a\ndiamond ring, an' I knows a little colored gal that wants one, too.\nI'm goin' all right! This suttenly am th' most kloslosterous\nconjunctivity of combativeness that I ever sagaciated!\" and he began\nto do a sort of impromptu cake-walk.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nDOWN INTO THE EARTH\n\n\nIT was now noon, but the adventurers did not think of dinner in the\nexcitement of approaching the mysterious island. The speed of the ship\nwas increased that they might the more quickly come to it. As they\napproached they could see the masses of vapor more plainly, and it\nappeared that some great commotion must be going on inside the big\nhole, since clouds of steam arose.\n\n\"I only hope it doesn't prove too hot for us,\" observed the professor.\n\"However, I provided a water jacket for the ship, and we may need it,\nas well as the vacuum chambers to keep the heat from us.\"\n\nIt was about three o'clock when the flying ship reached the edge of\nthe island. From there it was about a mile to the rim of the big hole,\nover one side of which the waters of the ocean poured with a roar that\ncould be heard over half a mile off.\n\n\"I think we had better halt and see that everything is in good shape\nbefore proceeding,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"Jack, you and Mark make a\nthorough inspection of the engine room, and see that all the apparatus\nis in working order.\"\n\nThe two boys prepared to do as they were told. Mark, who was walking a\nlittle ahead of Jack, entered the apartment from which the storeroom\nopened. As he did so he saw, or thought he saw, the door of the place\nwhere the extra supplies were kept, close. Without saying anything to\nJack he hurried forward, and tried the knob. It would not turn.\n\n\"That's funny,\" said Mark to himself. \"I could almost swear I saw some\none go into that room. Yet I know the professor did not enter, for I\njust left him. And none of the others would dare to. I wonder if I\nwill ever solve the mystery.\"\n\nBut he had too much to do to allow him to dwell on that matter.\nSeveral of the dynamos needed adjusting and for two hours he and Jack\nhad all they could do.\n\nIn the meanwhile the professor had gone over the other parts of the\nship, and gotten everything in readiness for the descent. The Mermaid\nwas lowered to within a few hundred feet of the sea, and, through a\nhose that was let down, the compartments, provided for this emergency\nwere filled with water. These compartments were between the outer and\ninner hulls of the lower part of the craft, and were designed to\nprevent the interior becoming heated in case the travelers found they\nhad to pass close to fire. There were also vacuum chambers, and from\nthese the air was exhausted, as of course every schoolboy knows a\nvacuum is a non-conductor of either heat or cold.\n\n\"Now I think we are ready,\" the professor announced at length.\n\n\"Everything's all right in the engine room,\" announced Jack.\n\n\"Yes, an' everything's all right in th' kitchen,\" put in Washington.\n\"I've got a good meal ready as soon as any one wants to eat.\"\n\n\"It will have to wait a while,\" Mr. Henderson remarked. \"We are going\nto start to make the descent before we dine.\"\n\nThe hose was reeled up, and the ship was sent a few hundred feet\nhigher into the air, as Mr. Henderson wanted to take a last good\nobservation before he went down into the hole.\n\nBut having risen some distance above the masses of rolling vapors he\nfound he was at no advantage, since the strongest telescope he could\nbring to bear could not pierce the cloud masses.\n\n\"We'll just have to trust to luck,\" the scientist said. \"I judge we're\nabout over the centre of the opening. Lower away Mark!\"\n\nThe boy, who, under the watchful eye of the professor, was\nmanipulating the levers and wheels in the conning tower, shifted some\nhandles. The gas was expelled from the holder, the negative gravity\napparatus ceased to work, and the Flying Mermaid sank lower and lower,\ntoward the mysterious hole that yawned beneath her.\n\nThe hearts of all beat strangely, if not with fear, at least with\napprehension, for they did not know what they might encounter. Perhaps\ndeath in some terrible form awaited them. But the desire to discover\nsomething new and strange had gripped all of them, and not one would\nhave voted to turn back.\n\nEven old Andy, who seldom got excited, was in unusual spirits. He took\ndown his gun and remarked:\n\n\"Maybe I can kill some new kind of animal, and write a book about its\nhabits, for surely we will see strange beasts in the under-world.\"\n\nLower and lower sank the ship. Now it was amid the first thin masses\nof vapors, those that floated highest and were more like a light fog,\nthan anything else. By means of a window in the bottom of the craft,\nwhich window was closed by a thick piece of plate glass, Professor\nHenderson could look down and see what was beneath them.\n\n\"The clouds seem to be getting thicker,\" he said, as he peered through\nthe small casement. \"If they would only clear away we could see\nsomething.\"\n\nBut instead of doing this the vapors accumulated more thickly about\nthe ship. It was so dark inside the Mermaid now that the electric\nlights had to be switched on. In the room with the floor-window the\nlights were not used, as had they shone one could not have seen down\nbelow.\n\nThe professor maintained his position. The descent was a perilous one,\nand he wanted to be on the watch to check it at once if the Mermaid\nwas liable to dash upon some pointed rock or fall into some fiery pit.\nHis hand was on the signal levers.\n\nSuddenly he looked up and glanced at a gage on the wall. The hand of\nit was slowly revolving.\n\n\"We are at the earth's surface,\" the scientist said. \"Now we are below\nit. Now we are fairly within the big hole! Boys, we may be on the\nverge of a great discovery!\"\n\nAn instant later it seemed as if a hot wave had struck the Mermaid, or\nas if the craft had been plunged into boiling water.\n\n\"It's going to be hot!\" cried the professor. \"Lucky I provided the\nwater jackets!\"\n\nThen the lights in the interior of the ship went out, leaving the\nwhole craft in darkness.\n\n\"What has happened?\" cried Mark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nMANY MILES BELOW\n\n\n\"DON'T be alarmed,\" spoke the calm voice of the professor. \"I have\nonly turned off the electrics. I want to switch on the search lights,\nto see if we can learn anything about our position.\"\n\nAs he spoke he turned a switch, and, the gloom below the ship, as the\nboys could see by glimpses from the floor-window, was pierced by a\ndazzling glare. In the bottom of the Mermaid were set a number of\npowerful electric arc lights with reflectors, constructed to throw the\nbeams downward. The professor had built them in for just this\nemergency, as he thought that at some time they might want to\nilluminate what was below the craft.\n\nNot that it was of much avail on this occasion, for, though the lights\nwere powerful, they could not pierce the miles of gloom that lay below\nthem. The beams only served to accentuate the darkness.\n\n\"I guess we'll have to trust to luck,\" the professor said, after a\nvain attempt, by means of powerful glasses, to distinguish something.\n\"There is too much fog and vapor.\"\n\n\"What makes it so warm?\" asked Mark, removing his coat.\n\n\"Well, you must remember you are approaching the interior of the\nearth,\" the professor answered. \"It has been calculated that the heat\nincreases one degree for every fifty-five feet you descend. We have\ncome down several hundred feet and of course it is getting warmer.\"\n\n\"Then if we go down very far it will get so hot we will not be able to\nstand it,\" Jack put in.\n\n\"I do not believe we will suffer any great inconvenience,\" Mr.\nHenderson went on. \"I believe that after we pass a certain point it\nwill become cooler. I think the inner fires of the earth are more or\nless heated gas in a sort of inner chamber between two shells. If we\ncan pass the second shell, we will be all right.\"\n\n\"But aren't we liable to hit something, going down into the dark this\nway?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"We will guard ourselves as far as possible,\" the scientist answered.\n\nThe Mermaid seemed to be going down on a side of the immense shaft a\ngood way distant from the strange waterfall. When they had first\ndropped into the hole the travelers could hear the rush of waters, but\nnow the noise was not audible.\n\n\"I think the hole must widen out the farther down we go,\" the\nprofessor said. \"We are probably many miles from the fall now.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I hope so,\" put in Jack. \"It would be no fun to have to take\na shower bath in this place.\"\n\nAfter a meal, the boys and the professor took some more observations,\nbut with all their efforts nothing could be seen below the ship but a\nvast black void, into which they were steadily descending.\n\n\"I wonder when we're going to stop,\" asked Mark. \"It's like playing\nthe game 'Going to Jerusalem,' you keep wondering when the music will\ncease and you will have a chance to grab a chair. I only hope we have\na chair or something else to sit on, in case we go to smash.\"\n\n\"We're not liable to have any accidents with the professor in charge,\"\nJack answered. \"Didn't he bring us safe out of some pretty tight holes\nwhen we went to the north pole in the airship, and again when we found\nthe south pole in the submarine?\"\n\n\"Yes, but this is different,\" objected Mark.\n\n\"Well, I'm not worrying,\" Jack went on. \"It doesn't do any good, and\nonly makes you lie awake nights. By the way, I wonder what time it is\ngetting to be.\"\n\nHe looked at his watch and found it was close on to eight o'clock in\nthe evening. So late had dinner been served, and so varied were the\nhappenings of the last few hours, that time had passed quickly.\n\n\"Why it's almost bed-time,\" said Jack. \"I wonder if we are to go on\ndropping into the depths of nowhere all night.\"\n\nAt that moment the professor entered the room where the boys were. He\nseemed quite pleased over something, and was smiling.\n\n\"Everything is going along famously,\" he said. \"I have just tested the\nair and find it is rich in oxygen. We shall suffer nothing on that\nscore. The heat too, seems to have decreased. On the whole, everything\nfavors us.\"\n\n\"Are we going on down?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"As far as we can,\" Mr. Henderson answered. \"Let me see how far we are\nbelow now.\"\n\nHe went to the gage that indicated the vertical position of the ship.\nBecause of the changed conditions, the craft now sinking below the\nsurface of the earth instead of rising above it, as was its wont, some\ncalculations were necessary. These the scientist made as quickly as he\ncould.\n\n\"We are now ten miles underground!\" he exclaimed. \"That is doing very\nwell. My theories are working out. I think we shall land somewhere\nbefore long.\"\n\n\"I hopes so!\" exclaimed Washington coming in at this point. \"I'm\nmighty skeered shootin' down int' this dark hole, and no time-table t'\nshow when we's due t' arrive.\"\n\n\"We ought to land in a couple of days more,\" the professor answered.\n\"Never mind about worrying Washington, I'll take care of you.\"\n\n\"I hopes so, Perfesser,\" the colored man said. \"I got a little girl\nwaitin' for me back in Georgia, an' I'd like t' see her 'fore I git\nburned up.\"\n\nAccompanied by the professor, the boys made a tour of the ship to see\nthat all the machinery and apparatus were in working order. Owing to\nthe changed conditions the negative gravity engine had to be worked at\nfaster speed than usual, since the downward pull of the earth was\ngreater the farther they descended into the interior and they did not\nwant to fall too swiftly. But this was easily provided for, since the\nprofessor had made the apparatus capable of standing a great strain.\n\nThe ten miles had become fourteen when the professor, finding that\neverything was in good shape, proposed that the boys go to bed. They,\ndid not want to, though they were sleepy, and they feared to miss some\nstrange sights.\n\nBut when the professor had promised to call them in case anything\nunusual developed, they consented to turn in, and Bill and Tom assumed\ntheir duties, which were light enough, now that the ship was merely\nfalling into the immense shaft.\n\nWhen Mark turned into his bunk he could not go to sleep at once. It\nmay have been the excitement over their new position, or because he\nhad eaten too hearty a supper, but the fact was he remained awake for\nsome time.\n\nWhile thus tossing restlessly on his bed, wondering what ailed him, he\nthought he heard a noise in the main apartment out of which the\nstoreroom opened. He crawled softly from his bed, and looked from his\nstateroom door.\n\nIn the light of a shaded electric Mark saw the figure of some one\nglide across the floor and take refuge in the room, which Professor\nHenderson always was so particular about.\n\n\"I wonder what or who that was,\" reasoned Mark. \"There is some mystery\nin this. Can the professor have concealed some one on this ship whose\npresence he does not want to admit? It certainly looks so.\"\n\nNot wanting to awaken the ship's crew, and remembering what Mr.\nHenderson had said about any one entering the storeroom, Mark went\nback to bed, to fall into an uneasy slumber.\n\n\"Breakfast!\" called Washington breaking in on a fine dream Jack was\nhaving about being captain of a company of automobile soldiers. \"Last\ncall for breakfast!\"\n\n\"Hello! Is it morning?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Not so's you could notice it,\" Washington went on. \"It's as dark as a\nstack of black cats and another one throwed in. But breakfast is ready\njest the same.\"\n\nThe boys were soon at the table, and learned that nothing of\nimportance had occurred during the night. The Mermaid had been kept\ngoing slowly down, and about seven o'clock registered more than fifty\nmiles below the earth's surface.\n\nStill there was no change in the outward surroundings. It remained as\nblack as the interior of Egypt when that country was at its darkest.\nThe powerful electrics could not pierce the gloom. The ship was\nworking well, and the travelers were very comfortable.\n\nDown, down, down, went the Mermaid. The temperature, which had risen\nto about ninety went back to sixty-nine, and there seemed to be no\nmore danger from the inner fires.\n\nThey were now a hundred miles under the surface. But still the\nprofessor kept the Mermaid sinking. Every now and again he would take\nan observation, but only found the impenetrable darkness surrounded\nthem.\n\n\"We must arrive somewhere, soon,\" he muttered.\n\nIt was about six o'clock that night that the alarm bell set up a\nsudden ringing. The professor who was making some calculations on a\npiece of paper jumped to his feet, and so did a number of the others.\n\n\"We are nearing the bottom!\" he cried. \"The bell has given us\nwarning!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nIN THE STRANGE DRAUGHT\n\n\nTHE boys ran to attend to the engines and apparatus to which they had\nbeen assigned in view of this emergency. The professor, Washington,\nBill, Tom and Andy, who had kept to themselves since the descent, came\nrunning out of the small cabin where they usually sat, and wanted to\nknow what it was all about.\n\n\"We may hit something, in spite of all precautions,\" Mr. Henderson\nremarked. \"Slow down the ship.\"\n\nThe Mermaid was, accordingly checked in her downward flight, by a\nliberal use of the gas and the negative gravity machine.\n\nThe bell continued to ring, and the dials pointed to the mark that\nindicated the ship was more than one hundred and fifty miles down.\n\nMark, who had run to the engine room to check the descent, came back.\n\n\"Why didn't you slow her down?\" asked the professor.\n\n\"I did,\" replied the boy. \"The negative gravity and the gas machines\nare working at full speed.\"\n\n\"Then why are we still descending?\" asked the scientist. \"For a while\nour speed was checked, but now we are falling faster than before.\"\n\n\"I attended to the apparatus,\" Mark insisted.\n\nJust then, from without the ship, came a terrible roaring sound, as\nthough there was a great cyclone in progress. At the same time, those\naboard the craft could feel themselves being pulled downward with\nterrific force.\n\n\"We are caught in a draught!\" Mr. Henderson cried. \"We are being\nsucked down into the depths of the earth!\"\n\nHe ran to the engine room. With the help of the boys he set in motion\nan auxiliary gravity machine, designed to exert a most powerful\ninfluence against the downward pull of the earth. As they watched the\ngreat wheels spin around, and heard the hum and whirr of the dynamos,\nthe boys watched the pointer which indicated how low they were\ngetting.\n\nAnd, as they watched, they saw that the needle of the dial kept\nmoving, moving, moving.\n\n\"Our efforts are useless! We can't stop!\" the professor cried.\n\nGrave indeed was the plight of the adventurers. In their ship they\nwere being sucked down into unknown regions and all their efforts did\nnot avail to save them. It was an emergency they could not guard\nagainst, and which could not have been foreseen.\n\n\"What are to do?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"We can only wait,\" Mr. Henderson replied. \"The terrible suction may\ncease, or it may carry us to some place of safety. Let us hope for the\nbest.\"\n\nSeeing there was no further use in running the engines in an effort to\ncheck the downward rush the machines were stopped. Then they waited\nfor whatever might happen.\n\nNow that they seemed in imminent peril Washington was as cool as any\none. He went about putting his kitchen in order and getting ready for\nthe next meal as if they were sailing comfortably along on the surface\nof the ocean. As for old Andy he was nervous and frightened, and\nplainly showed it. With his gun in readiness he paced back and forth\nas if on the lookout for strange beasts or birds.\n\nBill and Tom were so alarmed that they were of little use in doing\nanything, and they were not disturbed in their staterooms where they\nwent when it became known that the ship was unmanageable.\n\nThe boys and the professor, while greatly frightened at the unexpected\nturn of events, decided there was no use in giving way to foolish\nalarm. They realized they could do nothing but await developments.\n\nAt the same time they took every precaution. They piled all the\nbedding on the floor of the living room, so that the pillows and\nmattresses might form a sort of pad in case the ship was dashed down\non the bottom of the big hole.\n\n\"Not that it would save us much,\" Jack observed with a grim smile,\n\"but somehow it sort of makes your mind easier.\"\n\nAll this while the ship was being sucked down at a swift pace. The\npointer of the gage, indicating the depth, kept moving around and soon\nthey were several hundreds of miles below the surface of the earth.\n\nThe professor tried, by means of several instruments, to discover in\nwhich direction they were headed, and whether they were going straight\ndown or at an angle. But some strange influence seemed to affect the\ngages and other pieces of apparatus, for the pointers and hands would\nswing in all directions, at one time indicating that they were going\ndown, and, again, upward.\n\n\"There must be a strong current of electricity here,\" Mr. Henderson\nsaid, \"or else there is, as many suspect, a powerful magnet at the\ncenter of the earth, which we are nearing.\"\n\n\"What will you do if the ship is pulled apart, or falls and is\nsmashed?\" asked Mark with much anxiety.\n\n\"You take a cheerful view of things,\" said Jack.\n\n\"Well, it's a good thing to prepare for emergencies,\" Mark added.\n\n\"If the ship was to be separated by the magnetic pull, or if it fell\non sharp rocks and was split in twain, I am afraid none of us could do\nanything to save ourselves,\" the professor answered. \"Still, if we\nwere given a little warning of the disaster, I have means at hand\nwhereby we might escape with our lives. But it would be a perilous way\nof----\"\n\n\"I reckon yo' all better come out an' have supper,\" broke in\nWashington. \"Leastways we'll call it supper, though I don't rightly\nknow whether it's night or mornin'. Anyhow I've got a meal ready.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose any of us feel much like eating,\" observed Mr.\nHenderson, \"but there is no telling when we will have the chance\nagain, so, perhaps, we had better take advantage of it.\"\n\nFor a while they ate in silence, finding that they had better\nappetites than they at first thought. Old Andy in particular did full\njustice to the food Washington had prepared.\n\n\"I always found it a good plan to eat as much and as often as you\ncan,\" the hunter remarked. \"This is a mighty uncertain world.\"\n\n\"You started to tell us a little while ago, Professor,\" said Mark,\n\"about a plan you had for saving out lives if worst came to worst, and\nthere was a chance to put it into operation. What is it?\"\n\n\"I will tell you,\" the aged inventor said. \"It is something about\nwhich I have kept silent, as I did not want to frighten any of you. It\nwas my latest invention, and I had only perfected it when we started\noff on this voyage. Consequently I had no chance to try it. The\nmachine works in theory, but whether it does in practice is another\nquestion. That is why I say there is a risk. But we may have to take\nthis risk. I have placed aboard this ship a----\"\n\nThe professor was interrupted in what he was about to say by a curious\ntremor that made the whole ship shiver as though it had struck some\nobstruction. Yet there was no sudden jolt or jar such as would have\nbeen occasioned by that.\n\nAt the same time Washington, who was out in the kitchen, came running\ninto the dining room, crying:\n\n\"We're droppin' into a ragin' fire, Perfesser!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"I jest took a look down through th' hole in th' bottom of the ship!\"\ncried Washington. \"It's all flames an' smoke below us!\"\n\n\"I wonder if it is the end,\" the professor muttered in a low voice.\n\nFollowed by the boys, the inventor hastened to the floor-window. The\nlights were turned off to enable a better view to be had of what was\nbelow them.\n\nLeaning over the glass protected aperture the boys and the professor\nsaw, far, far down, a bright light shining. It was as if they were\nmiles above a whole town of blast furnaces, the stacks of which were\nbelching forth flames and smoke. The rolling clouds of vapor were\nilluminated by a peculiar greenish light, which, at times, turned to\nred, blue, purple and yellowish hues.\n\nThe effect was weird and beautiful though it was full of terror for\nthe travelers. It seemed as if they were falling into some terrible\npit of fire, for the reflection of what they feared were flames, could\nplainly be seen.\n\n\"I wish I'd never come on this terrible voyage!\" wailed Washington.\n\"I'd rather freeze to death than be burned up.\"\n\n\"Washington, be quiet!\" commanded the professor sternly. \"This is no\ntime for foolishness. We must work hard to save our lives, for we are\nin dire peril.\n\n\"Mark, you and Washington, with Jack, start the engines. Turn on every\nbit of power you can. Fill the gas holder as full as it will hold, and\nuse extra heavy pressure. I will see if I can not work the negative\ngravity apparatus to better advantage than we did before. We must\nescape if possible!\"\n\nThe boys, as was also Washington, were only too glad to have something\nto do to take their mind off their troubles. All three were much\nfrightened, but Mark and Jack tried not to show it. As for Washington\nhe was almost crying.\n\nSoon the whirr and hum of the machinery in the Mermaid was heard. The\ncraft, which was rushing in some direction, either downward, ahead or\nbackwards within the unknown depths, shivered from the speed of the\ndynamos and other apparatus. Soon the boys could hear the professor\nstarting the negative gravity engine, and then began a struggle\nbetween the forces of nature and those of mankind.\n\nOnce more the adventurers anxiously watched the gages and indicators.\nFor a while the ship seemed to be holding out against the terrible\ninfluence that was sucking her down. She appeared to hesitate. Then,\nas the downward force triumphed over the mechanical energy in the\ncraft, she began to settle again, and soon was descending, if that was\nthe direction, as fast as before.\n\n\"It is of no use,\" said the professor with a groan. \"I must try our\nlast resort!\"\n\nHe started from the engine room where Mark and Jack had gone. As he\ndid so, he glanced at a thermometer hanging on the wall near the door.\n\n\"Has any one turned on the heat?\" he asked.\n\n\"It's shut off,\" replied Mark, looking at the electric stove.\n\n\"Then what makes it so hot?\" asked the scientist.\n\nHe pointed to the little silvery column in the tiny tube of the\ninstrument. It registered close to one hundred degrees, though a few\nminutes before it had been but sixty. And the starting of the\nmachinery could not account for the rise in temperature, since most of\nthe apparatus was run by electricity and developed little heat save in\nthe immediate proximity. The thermometer was fully ten feet away from\nany machine.\n\n\"It's the fiery furnace that's doing it!\" cried Washington. \"We're\nfalling into th' terrible pit an' we're goin' t' be roasted alive!\"\n\n\"It certainly is getting warmer,\" observed Mark, as he took off his\ncoat. Soon he had to shed his vest, and Jack and the professor\nfollowed his example. The others too, also found all superfluous\ngarments a burden, and, in a little while they were going about in\nscanty attire.\n\nStill the heat increased, until it was almost torture to remain in the\nengine room. Nor was it much cooler elsewhere. In vain did the\nprofessor set a score of big electric fans to whirring. He even placed\ncakes of ice, from the small ice machine that was carried, in front of\nthe revolving blades, to cool off the air. But the ice was melted\nalmost as soon as it was taken from the apparatus.\n\n\"Them flames is gittin' worser!\" Washington cried a little later.\n\"We's comin' nearer!\"\n\nFrom the bottom window the professor and the boys looked down. True\nenough the curious, changing, vari-colored lights seemed brighter.\nThey could almost see the tongues of flame shooting upward in\nanticipation of what they were soon to devour.\n\nThe heat was increasing every minute. The sides of the ship were hot.\nThe heads of the travelers were getting dizzy. They could hardly talk\nor move about.\n\n\"I must save our lives! I must trust to the----\" The professor, who\nwas muttering to himself started toward the storeroom. As in a dream\nMark watched him. He remembered afterward that he had speculated on\nwhat might be the outcome of the mystery the professor threw about the\nplace. \"I will have to use it,\" he heard the scientist say softly.\n\nJust as Mr. Henderson was about to open the door there came a fiercer\nblast of heat than any that had preceded. At the same instant the\nconditions in the Mermaid became so fearful that each of the travelers\nfelt himself fainting away.\n\n\"Go to--storeroom--get cylinder--get in----\" the professor\nmurmured, and then he fell forward in a faint.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE NEW LAND\n\n\n\"WHAT is it? Tell us!\" exclaimed Jack, almost in his last breath, for,\na few seconds later he too toppled over senseless. Then Washington\nwent down, while Andy, Bill and Tom succumbed to the terrible heat.\n\nMark felt his head swimming. His eyes were almost bulging from their\nsockets. He dimly remembered trying to force himself to go to the\nstoreroom and see what was there. He started toward it with that\nintention, but fell half way to it.\n\nAs he did so he saw something which impressed itself on his mind, half\nunconscious as he was.\n\nThe door of the storeroom suddenly opened, and from it came a giant\nshape, that seemed to expand until it filled the whole of the\napartment where the stricken ones lay. It was like the form of some\nmonster, half human, half beast. Mark shuddered, and then, closing his\neyes, he felt himself sinking down into some terrible deep and black\npit. A second later the whole ship was jarred as though it had hit\nsomething.\n\nHow long he and the others remained unconscious Mark did not know. He\nwas the first to revive, and his first sensation was one as though he\nhad slept hard and long, and did not want to get up. He felt very\ncomfortable, although he was lying flat on the floor, with his head\njammed against the side of a locker. It was so dark that he could not\ndistinguish his hand held close to his face.\n\n\"I wonder if I'm dead, and if all the others are dead too,\" he thought\nto himself. \"What has happened? Let's see, the last I remember was\nsome horrible shape rushing from the storeroom. I wonder what it could\nhave been? Surely that was not the secret the professor referred to.\"\n\nMark shuddered as he recalled the monster that seemed to have grown\nmore terrible as each second passed. Then the boy raised himself up\nfrom his prostrate position.\n\n\"Well, at any rate, some one has turned off the heat,\" he murmured.\n\"It's very comfortable in here now. I wish I could strike a light.\"\n\nHe listened intently, to learn if any of the others were moving about.\nHe could hear them breathing, but so faintly as to indicate they were\ninsensible. Mark stretched out his hand and felt that some one was\nlying close to him, but who of the adventurers it was he could not\ndetermine.\n\n\"If only the dynamo was working we could have light,\" he said. \"But it\nseems to have stopped,\" and, indeed there was a lacking of the\nfamiliar purr and hum of the electrical machine. In fact none of the\napparatus in the ship was working.\n\n\"The storage battery!\" exclaimed Mark. \"That would give light for a\nwhile, if I can only find the switch in the dark.\"\n\nHe began crawling about on his hands and knees. It was so intensely\nblack that he ran into many things and received severe bruises. At\nlast he came to a doorway, and as he did so his hand came in contact\nwith an easy chair. It was the only one aboard, and by that he knew he\nhad passed into the sitting room. He had his general direction now,\nand knew if he kept straight on he would come to the engine room.\nThere he was familiar enough with the apparatus and levers to be able\nto turn the electric switch.\n\nCrawling slowly and cautiously, he reached the room where all the\nengines were. Then he had to feel around the sides to locate the\nswitch. At length he found it. There was a click, a little flash of\ngreenish fire, and the copper conductors came together, and the ship\nwas flooded with the glow from the incandescents.\n\nMark hurried back to where the others were lying. They were still\nunconscious, but an uneasy, movement on the part of Jack told that he\nwas coming out of the stupor. Mark got some ammonia and held it\nbeneath his comrade's nose. The strong fumes completed the work that\nnature had started and Jack opened his eyes.\n\n\"Where am I? What has happened? Are any of them dead?\" he asked\nquickly.\n\n\"I hope no one is dead,\" Mark replied. \"As to the other question, I\ncan't answer. I don't know whether we are a thousand miles\nunderground, or floating on the ocean, though I'm more inclined to the\nformer theory. But never mind that now. Help me to bring the others\nback to their senses. I'll work on the professor and you can begin on\nBill or Tom. Washington seems to be all right,\" for at that moment the\ncolored man opened his eyes, stared about him and then got up.\n\n\"I thought I was dead for suah!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Some of the others may be if we don't hurry,\" said Mark. \"Get to\nwork, Wash!\"\n\nWith the colored man to help them the two boys, by the use of the\nammonia, succeeded in reviving Bill, Tom and old Andy. But the\nprofessor, probably on account of his advanced age, did not respond so\nreadily to the treatment. The boys were getting quite alarmed, as even\nsome of the diluted ammonia, forced between his lips, did not cause\nhim to open his eyes, or increase his heart action.\n\n\"If he should die, and leave us all alone with the ship in this\nterrible place, what would we do?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"He's not going to die!\" exclaimed Mark. \"Here I have another plan.\nWashington bring that medical electrical battery from the engine\nroom.\" This was a small machine the professor had brought along for\nexperimental purposes.\n\nQuickly adjusting it, Mark placed the handles in the nerveless fingers\nof Mr. Henderson. Then he started the current. In about a minute the\neyelids of the aged inventor began to quiver, and, in less than five\nminutes he had been revived sufficiently to enable him to sit up. He\npassed his hand across his forehead.\n\n\"What has happened?\" he asked in a faint voice.\n\n\"I don't know; none of us knows,\" Mark answered. \"We all lost our\nsenses when it got so hot, and there seemed to be some peculiar vapor\nin the air. The last I remember was seeing some horrible shape rush\nfrom the storeroom, soon after the ship struck. Then I fainted away.\nWhen I woke up I managed to turn the lights on, and then I came back\nhere.\"\n\n\"I wonder where we are,\" the old man murmured. \"I must find out. We\nmust take every precaution. Washington, go and look at the gage\nindicating our depth.\"\n\nThe colored man was gone but a few seconds. When he returned his eyes\nwere bulging in terror.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Mr. Henderson, who, thanks to the battery, had\nalmost completely recovered.\n\n\"It ain't possible!\" gasped Washington. \"I'll never believe it!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Mr. Henderson, while the others waited in anxiety\nfor the answer.\n\n\"We're five hundred miles down!\" declared Washington.\n\n\"Five hundred miles!\" muttered the inventor. \"It does not seem\npossible, but it must be so. We fell very rapidly and the terrible\ndraught sucked us down with incredible rapidity. But come, we must see\nwhat our situation is, and where we are. We are stationary, and are\nevidently on some solid substance.\"\n\nThey all felt much recovered now, and, as the terrible fright of being\nconsumed in a fiery furnace had passed, they all were in better\nspirits.\n\nAt the suggestion of the professor, the boys and Washington made a\ntour of the ship. They found, for some unaccountable reason, that\nnearly all the engines and apparatuses were out of gear. In some the\nparts had broken, and others were merely stopped, from the failure of\nsome other machine, on which they were dependent.\n\n\"I'm afraid this is the end of the Mermaid,\" said Mark, in a sorrowful\ntone.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" replied Jack, who was of a more cheerful nature. \"Things\nare not so bad as they look. The professor can fix everything.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I hope so,\" Mark went on, not much encouraged, however, by\nJack's philosophy. \"It would be no joke to have to stay five hundred\nmiles underground the rest of our lives.\"\n\n\"You don't know,\" retorted Jack. \"Don't judge of a country you've\nnever seen. This may be as fine a place as it is on the surface of the\nearth. I want a chance to see it,\" and Jack began to whistle a\ncheerful tune.\n\nThey completed the tour of the ship, and found, that, aside from the\ndamage to the machinery, the Mermaid had not sustained any harm. The\nhull was in good order, though of course they could not tell about the\ngas holder. It was not possible to see this except by going into the\nconning tower or out on the small deck, and this they did not venture\nto do. The connections between the holder and the main ship seemed to\nbe all right, and there was still a small quantity of gas in the big\ntank, as Mark found on opening a stop-cock.\n\nThey went back to the professor and told him what they had observed.\nHe seemed somewhat alarmed, the more so as the experience he had just\npassed through had weakened him considerably.\n\n\"I hope I shall be able to make the repairs,\" he said. \"It is our only\nhope.\"\n\nAs he spoke he looked up at the electric lights that shone overhead\nfrom wall brackets.\n\n\"Who is shutting down the power?\" he asked.\n\n\"There is no power on, Professor,\" replied Mark. \"I am running the\nlights from the storage battery. But something is the matter, for they\nare growing dim.\"\n\nThe filaments were now mere dull red wires, and the ship was being\nshrouded in gloom again.\n\n\"The battery is failing!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson. \"We shall be left\nin darkness, and there is no other way to produce light. I ought to\nhave brought some lamps or candles along in case of emergency.\"\n\nThe next instant the Mermaid became as black as Egypt is popularly\nsupposed to be, and something like an exclamation of terror came from\nthe professor.\n\nFor several minutes they all sat there in the blackness and gloom,\nwaiting for they knew not what. Then, suddenly, there sounded\nthroughout the ship, a creaking as of metal sliding along metal. Some\nbig lever creaked, and, a second later the whole place was flooded\nwith light.\n\n\"What has happened?\" cried the professor, starting to his feet in\nalarm.\n\n\"We are going to be burned up!\" exclaimed old Andy.\n\n\"It's all right! It's all right!\" yelled Washington from the engine\nroom where the boys had left him. \"Don't git skeered! I done it! I\nopened the port holes, by yanking on the lever. Golly, but we's\narrived at the new land! Look out, everybody!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nA STRANGE COUNTRY\n\n\nTHEY all ran to the port holes, which were openings in the side of the\nship. They were fitted with thick, double glass, and covered on the\noutside with steel shutters. These shutters were worked by a single\nlever from the engine room, so that one person could open or close\nthem in a second or two. Washington, by accident, it appeared later,\nhad slid back the protecting pieces of steel, and the rest followed.\n\nAs the adventurers looked from the glass ports they saw that the light\nwhich had flooded the ship came from without. They were in the midst\nof a beautiful glow, which seemed to be diffused about them like rays\nfrom a sun.\n\nOnly, in place of being a yellow or white light, such as the sun gives\noff at varying times, the glow was of violet hue. And, as they\nwatched, they saw the light change color, becoming a beautiful red,\nthen blue, and again green.\n\n\"Well, this is certainly remarkable!\" the professor said. \"I wonder\nwhat causes that.\"\n\n\"We've arrived! We're here, anyhow!\" Washington cried, coming into the\nroom. \"See the country!\"\n\nThen, for the first time, the travelers, taking their attention from\nthe curious light that was all around them, saw that they had indeed\narrived. They were on a vast plain, one, seemingly, boundless in\nextent, though off to the left there was a range of lofty mountains,\nwhile to the right there was the glimmer of what might be a big lake\nor inland sea.\n\n\"See, we are resting on the ground!\" exclaimed Jack. He pointed out of\nthe window, and the others, looking close at hand, noted that the\nMermaid had settled down in the midst of what seemed to be a field of\nflowers. Big red and yellow blossoms were all in front, and some grew\nso tall as to almost be up to the edge of the port.\n\n\"I wonder if we can be seeing aright,\" the professor muttered. \"Is\nthis really the interior of the earth; such a beautiful place as\nthis?\"\n\nThere could be little doubt of it. The ship had descended through the\nbig shaft, had been sucked down by the terrible air current, and had\nreally landed in a strange country.\n\nOf its size, shape and general conditions the adventurers, as yet,\ncould but guess. They could see it was a pleasant place, and one where\nthere might be the means to sustain life. For, as the professor said\nafterward, he felt that where there were flowers there would be\nfruits, and where both of these provisions of nature were to be found\nthere would likely be animal life, and even, perhaps, human beings.\n\nBut, for the time, they were content to look from the port on the\nbeautiful scene that lay stretched out before them. The ship rested on\nan even keel and had landed so softly that none of the plates were\nstrained.\n\n\"We have plenty of air, at all events,\" said the professor as he took\na deep breath. \"I was afraid of that, but it seems there was no need.\nThe air appears to be as good and fresh as that on the surface of the\nearth, only there is a curious property to it. It makes one feel\nlarger. I imagine it must be thinner than the air of the earth, which\nis a rather strange thing, since the higher one goes the more rarefied\nthe air becomes, and the lower, the more dense. Still we can not apply\nnatural philosophy to conditions under the earth. All the usual\ntheories may be upset. However, we should be content to take things as\nwe find them, and be glad we were not dashed to pieces when the ship\nwas caught in the terrible current.\"\n\n\"What do you suppose caused the awful heat, and then made it go away\nagain?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I can only make a guess at it,\" Mr. Henderson answered. \"There are\nmany strange things we will come across if we stay here long, I\nbelieve. As for the fire I think we must have passed a sort of\ninterior volcano.\"\n\n\"But what sort of a place do you think we have come to, Professor?\"\nasked Mark.\n\n\"It is hard to say,\" the scientist replied. \"We are certainly\nsomewhere within the earth. Our gage tells us it is five hundred\nmiles. That may or may not be correct, but I believe we are several\nhundred miles under the crust, at all events. As to what sort of a\nplace it is, you can see for yourselves.\"\n\n\"But how is it we can breathe here, and things can grow?\" asked Bill,\nwho was beginning to lose his fright at the thought of being\npractically buried alive.\n\n\"I do not know what makes such things possible,\" Mr. Henderson\nreplied, \"but that there is air here is a certainty. I can hardly\nbelieve it is drawn from the surface of the earth, down the big hole,\nand I am inclined to think this place of the under-world has an\natmosphere of its own, and one which produces different effects than\ndoes our own.\"\n\n\"They certainly have larger flowers than we have,\" said Mark. \"See how\nbig they grow, and what strong colors they have.\"\n\nHe pointed to the port, against which some of the blooms were nodding\nin the wind that had sprung up, for, in spite of the many differences,\nthe under-world was in some respects like the upper one.\n\n\"Probably the difference in the atmosphere accounts for that,\" the\nprofessor said. \"It enables things to grow larger. And, by the way,\nMark, that reminds me of something you said about seeing some horrible\nmonster fleeing from the ship. Did you dream that?\"\n\n\"I did see something horrible, Professor,\" he answered. \"I'm not\npositive what it was, but I'll tell you as nearly as I can what it was\nlike.\"\n\nThereupon Mark detailed what he had seen.\n\n\"But how could anything, least of all some big monster, be concealed\nin the storeroom, and we not know anything about it?\" asked Mr.\nHenderson.\n\n\"I thought you did know something of it,\" replied Mark.\n\n\"Who, me? My dear boy, you must be dreaming again. Why should I want\nto conceal any being in the storeroom? Come, there is something back\nof this. Tell me all you know of it. I can't imagine why you think I\nwas hiding something in the apartment.\"\n\n\"I thought so because you were always so anxious not to have me go\nnear it,\" answered the boy. \"Don't you remember when you saw me going\ntoward it, several times, you warned me away?\"\n\n\"So I did!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson, a light breaking over his face.\n\"But, Mark, it was not because I had hidden some human being or animal\nthere. I can't tell you what it is yet, save that I can say it is\nmerely a machine of mine that I have invented. For reasons of my own I\ndon't want any one to see it yet. Perhaps it may never be seen. I\nthought, not long ago, that we might have to undertake a terrible risk\nin escaping from this place. I directed you to go to the storeroom--but\nthere, I can't say any more, my friends. Sufficient that I had\nnothing in the animal line concealed there.\"\n\n\"But I am certain there was some beast or human being in there,\"\ninsisted Mark. \"I heard curious noises in there. Besides, how do you\naccount for the food disappearing and the door being open at times?\"\n\n\"It might have been rats,\" said Jack.\n\n\"I don't believe there are rats in the ship,\" put in the professor.\n\"More likely it was one of us who got up hungry and took the\nvictuals.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry I can't agree with you,\" Mark added respectfully. \"I am\nsure some strange being was on board this ship, and I believe it has\nnow escaped. Who or what it was I can't say, but you'll find I'm\nright, some day.\"\n\n\"All right,\" spoke Mr. Henderson with a laugh. \"I like to see any one\nbrave enough to stick up for his opinion, but, at the same time, I\ncan't very well imagine any person or thing being concealed in that\nstoreroom ever since we started. How could it get in?\"\n\nMark did not; answer, but there came to him the recollection of that\nnight, previous to the sailing of the Flying Mermaid, when he had\nobserved some strange shadow that seemed to glide aboard the craft.\n\n\"Now let's forget all about such things,\" the professor went on. \"We\nare in a strange country, and there are many things to see and do.\nLet's explore a little. Then we must see what we can do with the ship.\nWe are dependent on it, and it will not do to allow it to remain in a\ndamaged state. We expect to travel many miles in the interior of the\nearth if it is possible, and we have only our craft to go in.\"\n\n\"I reckon we'd all better assimilate into our interior progression\nsome molecules and atoms of partly disentegrated matter in order to\nsupply combustion for the carbonaceous elements and assist in the\nmanufacture of red corpuscles,\" said Washington, appearing in the\ndoor, with a broad grin on his good-natured face.\n\n\"Which, being interpreted,\" the professor said, \"means, I suppose,\nthat we had better eat something to keep our digestive apparatus in\ngood working order?\"\n\n\"Yo' done guessed it!\" exclaimed the colored man, relapsing into his\nordinary speech. \"I'se got a meal all ready.\"\n\nThey agreed that they might not have another opportunity soon to\npartake of food, so they all gathered about the table, on which\nWashington had spread a good meal.\n\n\"Come on, let's go outside and view this new and strange land at\ncloser quarters,\" the professor said, when they had satisfied their\nappetites. \"We can't see much from inside the ship.\"\n\nAccordingly the heavy door in the side of the Mermaid was slid back,\nand, for the first time the travelers stepped out on the surface of\nthe land in the interior of the earth.\n\nAt first it seemed no different than the ordinary land to which they\nwere accustomed. But they soon found it had many strange attributes.\nThe queer shifting and changing light, with the myriad of hues was one\nof them, but to this the adventurers had, by this time, become\naccustomed, though it was, none the less, a marvel to them. It was odd\nenough to see the landscape blood red one instant, and a pale green\nthe next, as it does when you look through differently colored\nglasses.\n\nThen, too, they noticed that the grass and flowers grew much more\nabundantly than in the outer part of the world. They saw clover six\nfeet high, and blades of grass even taller. In some places the growth\nof grass was so big that they were in danger of getting lost in it.\n\n\"If the grass is like this, what will the trees be?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"There are some away over there,\" Jack replied. \"We'll have to take a\nsail over. They must be several hundred feet high.\"\n\n\"Well, at any rate, here's a little brook, and the water looks good to\ndrink,\" went on Mark. \"I'm thirsty, so here goes.\"\n\nHe hurried to where a stream was flowing sluggishly between grassy\nbanks. The water was as clear as crystal, and Mark got down on his\nface and prepared to sip some of the liquid up.\n\nBut, no sooner had his lips touched it, than he sprang up with a cry\nand stood gazing at the water.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Jack. \"Hot?\"\n\n\"No, it isn't hot,\" Mark replied, \"but it isn't water. It's white\nmolasses!\"\n\n\"White molasses?\" repeated the professor, coming up at that moment.\n\"What are you talking about?\"\n\nHe stooped down and dipped his finger into the stream. He drew it up\nquickly, and there ran from it big drops that flowed as slowly as the\nextract of the sugarcane does in cold weather.\n\n\"You're about right, Mark,\" he said. \"It's water but it's almost as\nthick as molasses.\" He touched his finger to his tongue. \"It's good to\ndrink, all right,\" he went on, \"only it will be a little slow going\ndown.\"\n\nThen he dipped up a palm full, and let it trickle down his throat.\n\n\"It is the strangest water I ever saw,\" he added. \"It must be that the\nlack of some peculiar property of air, which we have on the surface,\nhas caused this. I must make some notes on it,\" and he drew out pencil\nand paper. He was about to jot down some facts when he was interrupted\nby a cry from Washington.\n\n\"Come and see what's the matter with this stone!\" he cried.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nCAUGHT BY A STRANGE PLANT\n\n\n\"WASHINGTON is in trouble!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson. Followed by the\ntwo boys he ran to where the colored man stood in a stooping position\nover a small pile of stones.\n\n\"What is it? Has something bit you?\" asked the scientist, as he came\nup on the run.\n\n\"No, but I can't git this stone up!\" Washington said. \"Look at what a\nlittle stone it is, but I can't lift it. Something must have happened\nto me. Maybe some one put th' evil eye on me! Maybe I'm bewitched!\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed the professor, \"what did you want the stone\nfor?\"\n\n\"Nothin' in particular,\" replied Washington, still tugging away at the\nstone, which was the size of his head. \"I was just goin' t' throw it\nat a big bird, but when I went to lift it this little stone 'peared t'\nbe glued fast.\"\n\nWashington moved aside to give Mr. Henderson a chance to try to pick\nup the piece of rock. As the scientist grasped it a look of surprise\ncame over his features:\n\n\"This is most remarkable!\" he exclaimed. \"I can't budge it. I wonder\nif a giant magnet is holding it down.\"\n\nHe tugged and tugged until he was red in the face. Then he beckoned to\nthe two boys, and they came to his aid. There was barely room for them\nall to each get one hand on the rock, and then, only after a powerful\ntug did it come up. Almost instantly it dropped back to the earth.\n\n\"This is remarkable!\" the professor said. \"I wonder if the other\nstones are the same.\"\n\nHe tried several others, and one and all resisted his efforts. It was\nonly the small stones he was able to lift alone, and these, he said,\nwere so weighty that it would have been a task to throw them any\ndistance.\n\n\"The water and the stones are strangely heavy in this land,\" he said.\n\"I wonder what other queer things we shall see.\"\n\n\"I saw a bird a little while ago, when I went to pick up that stone,\"\nobserved Washington.\n\n\"What kind was it?\" asked the inventor.\n\n\"I don't know, only it was about as big as an eagle.\"\n\nThe travelers wandered about a quarter of a mile from the ship. They\navoided the tall grass and the lofty nodding flowers that seemed to\ngrow in regular groves, and kept to places where they could walk with\ncomparative freedom.\n\n\"Have you formed any idea, Professor, as to the nature of this\ncountry?\" asked Mark, who liked to get at the bottom of things.\n\n\"I have, but it is only a theory,\" Mr. Henderson answered. \"I believe\nwe are on a sort of small earth that is inside the larger one we live\non. This sphere floats in space, just as our earth does, and we have\npassed through the void that lies between our globe and this interior\none. I think this new earth is about a quarter the size of ours and in\nsome respects the same. In others it is vastly different.\n\n\"But we will not think of those things now. We must see what our\nsituation is, whether we are in any danger, and must look to repairing\nour ship. There will be time enough for other matters later.\"\n\nThe travelers were walking slowly along, noting the strange things on\nevery side. As they advanced the vegetation seemed to become more\nluxuriant, as if nature had tried to out-do herself in providing\nbeautiful flowers and plants. The changing lights added to the beauty\nand weirdness of the scene.\n\nThe plain was a rolling one, and here and there were small hills and\nhollows. As the travelers topped a rise Jack, who was in advance,\ncalled out:\n\n\"Oh what queer plants! They are giant Jacks-in-the-pulpit!\"\n\nThe others hastened forward to see what the boy had discovered. Jack\nwas too eager to wait, and pressed on. The hill which sloped away from\nthe top of the little plateau on which he stood, was steeper than he\nhad counted on. As he leaned forward he lost his balance and toppled,\nhead foremost, down the declivity, rolling over.\n\n\"Look out!\" cried Mark, who had almost reached his comrade's side.\n\nThe scene that confronted the travelers was a strange one. Before them\nin a sort of hollow, were scores of big plants, shaped somewhat like a\nJack-in-the-pulpit, or a big lily, with a curved top or flap to it.\n\nThe plants were about eight feet tall, three feet across the top, and\nthe flap or covering was raised about two feet. They were nodding and\nswaying in the wind on their short stems.\n\n\"He's headed right for one of them!\" Mr. Henderson exclaimed. \"I hope\nhe'll not fall into one of the openings.\"\n\n\"Is there any danger?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"I'm afraid there is,\" the inventor added. \"Those plants are a variety\nof the well-known pitcher plant, or fly-trap, as they are sometimes\ncalled. In tropical countries they grow to a large size, but nothing\nlike these. They are filled, in the cup, with a sort of sticky, sweet\nmixture, and this attracts insects. When one enters the cup the top\nflap folds over, and the hapless insect is caught there. The plant\nactually devours it, nature providing a sort of vegetable digestive\napparatus. These giant plants are the same, and they seem large enough\nto take in a man, to say nothing of Jack!\"\n\nWith anxious faces the adventurers turned to watch the fate of their\ncomrade. Jack was slipping, sliding and rolling down the hill. He\ncould not seem to stop, though he was making desperate efforts to do\nso. He was headed straight for one of the largest of the terrible\nplants.\n\nIn vain, as he saw what was in front of him, did he try to change the\ncourse of his involuntary voyage. Over and over he rolled, until, at\nlength, he struck a little grassy hummock, bounced into the air, and\nright into the opening of a monster pitcher plant.\n\n\"It has him!\" cried Mark. \"We must save him! Come on everyone!\"\n\nHe raced down the hill, while the others came closely after him. They\nreached the plant into which Jack had bounced. The flap, or top piece,\nhad closed down, tightly over the unfortunate boy.\n\n\"Quick! We must save him or he will be smothered to death or drowned\nin the liquid the cup contains!\" Mr. Henderson exclaimed. \"Attack the\nplant with anything you can find!\"\n\n\"Let's cut through the side of the flower-cup!\" suggested Mark. \"That\nseems softer than the stem.\"\n\nHis idea was quickly put into operation. Andy's long hunting knife\ncame in very handy. While the sides of the long natural cup were\ntough, the knife made an impression on them, and, soon, a small door\nor opening had been cut in the side of the pitcher plant, large enough\nto enable a human body to pass through.\n\nWhen the last fibre had been severed by Andy, who was chosen to wield\nthe knife because of his long practice as a hunter, there was a sudden\ncommotion within the plant. Then a dark object, dripping water, made a\nspring and landed almost at the feet of the professor.\n\nIt was Jack, and a sorry sight he presented. He was covered from head\nto foot with some sticky substance, which dripped from all over him.\n\nWith hasty movements he cleared the stuff from his eyes and mouth, and\nspluttered:\n\n\"It's a good thing you cut me out when you did. I couldn't have held\non much longer!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHE BIG PEACH\n\n\nJACK soon recovered from his remarkable experience. The terrible plant\nthat had nearly eaten him alive was a mass of cut-up vegetable matter\nwhich attracted a swarm of insects. Most of them were ants, but such\nlarge ones the boys had never seen before, and the professor said they\nexceeded in size anything he had read about. Some of them were as\nlarge as big rats. They bit off large pieces of the fallen plant and\ncarried them to holes in the ground which were big enough for\nWashington to slip his foot into, and he wore a No. 11 shoe.\n\nBut the adventurers felt there were more important things for them to\nlook at than ants, so they started away again, the professor telling\nthem all to be careful and avoid accidents.\n\nIt was while they were strolling through a little glade, which they\ncame upon unexpectedly, that Washington, who was in the lead called\nout:\n\n\"Gracious goodness! It must be Thanksgivin'!\"\n\n\"Why so?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"'Cause here's th' remarkablest extraordinary and expansionist of a\npumpkin that ever I laid eyes on!\" the colored man cried.\n\nThey all hurried to where Washington had come to a halt. There, on the\nground in front of him, was a big round object, about the size of a\nhogshead. It was yellow in color, and was not unlike the golden\nvegetable from which mothers make such delicious pies.\n\n\"I allers was fond of pumpkins,\" said Washington, placing his hand on\nthe thing, which was almost as tall as he was, \"but I never thought\nI'd come across such a one as this.\"\n\nThe professor and the two boys went closer to the monstrosity. Mr.\nHenderson passed his hand over it and then, bending closer, smelled of\nit.\n\n\"That's not a pumpkin!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"What is it then?\" asked Washington.\n\n\"It's a giant peach,\" the inventor remarked. \"Can't you see the fuzz,\nand smell it? Of course it's a peach.\"\n\n\"Well I'll be horn-swoggled!\" cried Washington, leaning against the\nbig fruit, which easily, supported him.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Jack, drawing his knife from his pocket and opening\nthe largest blade. \"I always did like peaches. Now I can have all I\nwant,\" and he drove the steel into the object, cutting off a big slice\nwhich he began to eat.\n\n\"It may be poisonous!\" exclaimed Mark.\n\n\"Too late now,\" responded Jack, the juice running down from his mouth.\n\"Taste's good, anyhow.\"\n\nThey all watched Jack while he devoured his slice of fruit. Washington\nacted as if he expected his friend to topple over unconscious, but\nJack showed no bad symptoms.\n\n\"You'd better all have some,\" the boy said. \"It's the best I ever\ntasted.\"\n\nEncouraged by Jack's example, Mark thought he, too, would have some of\nthe fruit. He opened his knife and was about to take off some of the\npeach when suddenly the thing began to roll forward, almost upon him.\n\n\"Hi! Stop your shoving!\" he exclaimed. \"Do you want to have the thing\nroll over me, Jack?\"\n\n\"I'm not shoving!\" replied Jack.\n\n\"Some one is!\" Mark went on. He dodged around the far side of the\nimmense fruit and what he saw made him cry out in astonishment.\n\nTwo grasshoppers, each one standing about three feet high, were\nstanding on their hind legs, and with their fore feet were pushing the\npeach along the ground. They had been attracted to the fruit by some\njuice which escaped from a bruise on that side, which was the ripest,\nand, being fond of sweets had, evidently decided to take their find to\nsome safe place where they could eat it at their leisure. Or perhaps\nthey wanted to provide for their families if grasshoppers have them.\n\n\"Did you ever see such monsters?\" asked Jack. \"They're as big as\ndogs!\"\n\nAt the sound of his voice the two grasshoppers, becoming alarmed,\nceased their endeavors to roll the peach along, and, assuming a\ncrouching attitude seemed to be waiting.\n\n\"They certainly are remarkable specimens,\" Mr. Henderson said. \"If the\nother animals are in proportion, and if there are persons in this new\nworld, we are likely to have a hard time of it.\"\n\nThis time the immense insects concluded the strangers were not to\ntheir liking. With a snapping of their big muscular legs and a whirr\nof their wings that was like the starting of an automobile, the\ngrasshoppers rose into the air and sailed away over the heads of the\nadventurers. Their flight was more than an eighth of a mile in extent,\nand they came down in a patch of the very tall grass.\n\n\"Let's go after them!\" exclaimed old Andy. \"I was so excited I forgot\nto take a shot at them. Come on!\"\n\n\"I think we'd better not,\" counseled the professor. \"In the first\nplace we don't need them. They would be no good for food. Then we\ndon't know but what they might attack us, and it would be no joke to\nbe bitten by a grasshopper of that size. Let them alone. We may find\nother game which will need your attention, Andy. Better save your\nammunition.\"\n\nSomewhat against his will, Andy had to submit to the professor's\nruling. The old hunter consoled himself with the reflection that if\ninsects grew to that size he would have some excellent sport hunting\neven the birds of the inner world.\n\n\"I wonder what sort of a tree that peach grew on,\" Jack remarked, as\nhe cut off another slice, when the excitement caused by the discovery\nof the grasshoppers had subsided. \"It must be taller than a church\nsteeple. I wonder how the fruit got here, for there are no trees\naround.\"\n\n\"I fancy those insects rolled it along for a good distance,\" Mr.\nHenderson put in. \"You can see the marks on the ground, where they\npushed it. They are wonderful creatures.\"\n\n\"Are we going any farther?\" asked Mark. \"Perhaps we can find the peach\ntree, and, likely there are other fruit trees near it.\"\n\nAt the professor's suggestion they strolled along for some distance.\nThey were now about three miles from the airship, and found that what\nthey had supposed was a rather level plain, was becoming a succession\nof hills and hollows. It was while descending into a rather deep\nvalley that Jack pointed ahead and exclaimed:\n\n\"I guess there's our peach orchard, but I never saw one like it\nbefore.\"\n\nNor had any of the others. Instead of trees the peaches were attached\nto vines growing along the ground. They covered a large part of the\nvalley, and the peaches, some bigger than the one they first\ndiscovered, some small and green, rose up amid the vines, just as\npumpkins do in a corn field.\n\n\"Stranger and stranger,\" the professor murmured. \"Peaches grow on\nvines. I suppose potatoes will grow on trees. Everything seems to be\nreversed here.\"\n\nThey made their way down toward the peach \"orchard\" as Jack called it,\nthough \"patch\" would have been a better name. Besides peaches they\nfound plums, apples, and pears growing in the same way, and all of a\nsize proportionate to the first-named fruit.\n\n\"Well, one thing is evident,\" Mr. Henderson remarked, \"we shall not\nstarve here. There is plenty to eat, even if we have to turn\nvegetarians.\"\n\n\"I wonder what time it is getting to be,\" Jack remarked. \"My watch\nsays twelve o'clock but whether it's noon or midnight I can't tell,\nwith this colored light coming and going. I wonder if it ever sets as\nthe sun does.\"\n\n\"That is something we'll have to get used to,\" the professor said.\n\"But I think we had better go back to the ship now. We have many\nthings to do to get it in order again. Besides, I am a little afraid\nto leave it unguarded so long. No telling but what some strange\nbeast--or persons, for that matter--might injure it.\"\n\n\"I'm going to take back some slices of peaches with me, anyhow,\" Mark\nsaid, and he and Jack cut off enough to make several meals, while\nBill, Tom and Washington took along all they could carry.\n\nAs they walked back toward the ship the strange lights seemed to be\ndying out. At first they hardly noticed this, but as they continued on\nit became quite gloomy, and an odd sort of gloom it was too, first\ngreen, then yellow, then red and then blue.\n\n\"I believe whatever serves as a sun down here is setting,\" the\nprofessor observed. \"We must hurry. I don't want to be caught out here\nafter dark.\"\n\nThey hurried on, the lights dying out more and more, until, as they\ncame in sight of their ship, it was so black they could hardly see.\n\nMark who was in the rear turned around, glancing behind him. As he did\nso he caught sight of a gigantic shadow moving along on top of the\nnearest hill. The shadow was not unlike that of a man in shape, but of\nsuch gigantic stature that Mark knew it could be like no human being\nhe had ever seen. At the same time it bore a curious resemblance to\nthe weird shadow he had seen slip into the Mermaid that night before\nthey sailed.\n\n\"I wonder if it can be the same--the same thing--grown larger, just\nas the peach grows larger than those in our world,\" Mark thought,\nwhile a shiver of fear seemed to go over him. \"I wonder if that--that\nthing could have been on the ship----\"\n\nThen the last rays of light died away and there was total darkness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nOVERHAULING THE SHIP\n\n\n\"KEEP together!\" shouted the professor. \"It will not do to become lost\nnow. We are close to the ship, and will soon be there. Come after me.\"\n\nIt was more by following the sound of the scientist's voice, than by\nany sight which the others could get of him, that they managed to\ntrail along behind. They reached the ship in safety, however, and\nentered. There was no sound as of beasts or insects within, and,\nthough Mark felt a little apprehensive on account of what he had seen,\nhe and the others as well, were glad to be again in something that\nseemed like home.\n\n\"I wish we had some candles, or some sort of a light to see by,\" the\nprofessor remarked. \"We can do nothing in the dark, and there is no\ntelling how long this night is going to last once it has set in. If I\ncould have a little illumination, I might be able to fix the dynamo,\nand then we could turn on the incandescents. That portable light we\nhad is broken.\n\n\"By cracky!\" exclaimed Andy. \"I believe I have the very thing!\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say you have a torch or a candle with you, do you?\"\nasked Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"No, but I have my patent pipe lighting apparatus,\" the hunter said.\n\"I always carry it. It gives a little light, but not much, though it\nmay be enough to work by.\"\n\nNot until after several hours work, handicapped as they were by lack\nof light, were the repairs to the ship completed.\n\n\"Now we'll start the engine and see how we will come out,\" the\ninventor exclaimed, as he wiped his hands on some waste.\n\nIt did not take long to generate enough power to turn the dynamo. Soon\nthe familiar hum and whirr was heard, and, a few seconds later the\nfilaments in the lamps began to glow a dull red, which gradually\nbrightened until they were shining in all their usual brilliancy.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried the boys. \"Now we can see!\"\n\nThey all felt in better spirits with the restoration of the lights,\nand, washing off the grease and dirt of their labors in the engine\nroom, they prepared to sit down to the meal which Washington prepared.\n\nAs soon as the dynamo was working well, care had to be taken not to\nspeed it too much on account of a mended belt. The professor turned\noff part of the lights and switched some of the current into the\nstorage batteries, to provide for emergencies. For there was no\ntelling how long the night might last.\n\nJack was the first one to finish the meal--they did not know whether\nto call it dinner, supper or breakfast. He went into the conning\ntower, and, as soon as he reached it he called out:\n\n\"Come on up here, professor! There's something strange going on!\"\n\nMr. Henderson, followed by Mark, hurried to the tower. As he reached\nit and looked out of the forward window, a beautiful white glow\nilluminated the whole scene, and then, from below the horizon, there\narose seven luminous disks. One was in the centre, while about it\ncircled the other six, like some immense pin-wheel.\n\n\"It's the moon!\" cried Mark.\n\n\"It's seven moons!\" Jack exclaimed. \"Why it's almost as light as day!\"\n\nAnd so it was, for the seven moons, if that is what they were, gave an\nillumination not unlike the sun in brilliancy though it was like the\nbeams from the pale moon of the earth.\n\n\"I guess we need not have worried about the darkness,\" the professor\nremarked. \"Still it is a good thing I fixed the dynamo.\"\n\nFor some time he and the other adventurers watched the odd sight of\nthe moons, as they rose higher and higher overhead. The scene was a\nbeautiful, if weird one, for the whole plain was bathed in the soft\nlight.\n\n\"I guess we can turn off the incandescents, and use all the power for\nthe storage batteries,\" Mr. Henderson went on, as he descended into\nthe ship, and opened the port shutters which had been closed when they\nstarted off on their exploring tour. The interior of the Mermaid was\nalmost as light as when the odd colored beams had been playing over\nthe new earth to which they had come.\n\n\"I think we had better continue with our work of making repairs,\" Mr.\nHenderson said. \"We can't count on these moons remaining here any\nlength of time, and I want to take advantage of them. So though some\nof us perhaps need sleep, we will forego it and fix up the Mermaid. I\nwant to take a trip and see what other wonders await us.\"\n\nThey all agreed that they would rather work than sleep, and soon the\nentire force was busy in the engine room. There was much to be done,\nand the most important things were attended to first. The motive power\nwas overhauled and found to be in need of several new parts. These\nwere put in and then the gas generator, and the negative gravity\nmachine, were put in shape.\n\nIt would have taken something very substantial to have awakened any\none on board the Mermaid that night. They all slept soundly and awoke\nto find the strange colored lights shining in through the glass\ncovered port holes.\n\n\"Well, the sun, or what corresponds to it, is up,\" observed Jack, \"and\nI guess we had better do as the little boy in the school reader did,\nand get up, too, Mark.\"\n\nSoon all the travelers were aroused, and the sound of Washington\nbustling about in the kitchen, whence came the smell of coffee, bacon\nand eggs, told the hungry ones that breakfast was under way.\n\nAfter the meal work was again started on repairing the ship, and by\nnoon the professor remarked:\n\n\"I think we shall try a little flight after dinner. That is, if one\nthing doesn't prevent us.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"We may be held down, as were those stones,\" was the grave answer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHE FISH THAT WALKED\n\n\nIT was with no little apprehension that the professor prepared to take\nhis first flight aboard the ship in the realms of the new world. He\nknew little or nothing of the conditions he might meet with, the\ndensity of the atmosphere, or how the Mermaid would behave under\nanother environment than that to which she was accustomed.\n\nYet he felt it was necessary to make a start. They would have to\nattempt a flight sooner or later, and Mr. Henderson was not the one to\ndelay matters. So, the last adjustment having been made to the\nrepaired machinery, they all took their places in the ship.\n\nThe boys and the professor went to the conning tower to direct\nmatters, while Washington and the others were in the engine room to\nsee that the machinery worked properly. Mark gave a last look outside\nas he closed the big steel cover over the hole through which admission\nwas had to the craft. He thought he might catch a glimpse of the queer\nshadow, but nothing was in sight. It was like a beautiful summer's\nday, save for the strange lights, shifting and changing. But the\ntravelers had become somewhat used to them by this time.\n\nThe professor turned the valve that allowed the gas to enter the\nholder. There was a hissing sound and a sort of trembling throughout\nthe entire ship. The dynamos were whizzing away and the negative\ngravity machine was all ready to start.\n\nFor several minutes the travelers waited until the big lifting tank\nwas filled with the strong vapor. They watched the gages which\nindicated the pressure to be several hundred pounds.\n\n\"I think we can chance it now,\" remarked Mr. Henderson, as he threw\nover several levers. \"We'll try, at any rate.\"\n\nWith a tremor the Mermaid left the surface of the inner earth and went\nsailing upward toward the--well it wasn't exactly the sky, but it was\nwhat corresponded to it in the new world, though there were no clouds\nand no blue depths such as the boys were used to. At all events the\nMermaid was flying again, and, as the adventurers felt themselves\nbeing lifted up they gave a spontaneous cheer at the success which had\ncrowned their efforts.\n\nThe ship went up several hundred feet, and then, the professor, having\nbrought her to a stop, sent her ahead at a slow pace. He wanted to be\nsure all the apparatus was in good working order before he tried any\nspeed.\n\nThe Mermaid responded readily. Straight as an arrow through the air\nshe flew.\n\n\"Well, this is almost as good as being on the regular earth!\"\nexclaimed Jack.\n\n\"It's better,\" put in Mark. \"We haven't seen half the wonders yet.\nLet's open the floor shutter, and see how it looks down below.\"\n\nHe and Jack went to the room where there was an opening in the floor\nof the ship, covered by heavy glass. They slid back the steel shutter\nand there, down below them, was the strange new, world they had come\nto, stretched out like some big map.\n\nThey could see mountains, forests, plains, and rivers, the water\nsparkling in the colored light. Over green fields they flew, then\nacross some stretches where only sand and rocks were to be seen.\nFaster and faster the ship went, as the professor found the machinery\nwas once more in perfect order. Jack was idly watching the play of\ntinted lights over the surface of the ground.\n\n\"I wonder what makes it,\" he said.\n\n\"I have tried to account for it in several ways,\" said the professor,\nwho had called Washington to the conning tower and come to join the\nboys. \"I have had first one theory and then another, but the one I am\nalmost sure is correct is that hidden volcanic fires cause the\nillumination.\n\n\"I think they flare up and die away, and have become so regular that\nthey produce the same effect as night and day with us. Probably the\nfires go out for lack of fuel, and when it is supplied they start up\nagain. Perhaps it is a sort of gas that they burn.\"\n\n\"Well, it's queer enough, whatever it is,\" Jack remarked. \"What\nstrikes me as funny, though, is that we haven't seen a single person\nsince we came here. Surely this place must be inhabited.\"\n\nMark thought of the strange shadow he had seen, but said nothing.\n\n\"I believe it is,\" the professor answered. \"We will probably come upon\nthe inhabitants soon. I only hope they are a people who will do us no\nharm.\"\n\n\"If they tried any of their tricks we could mount up in our ship and\nescape them,\" said Andy.\n\n\"Provided they gave us the chance,\" Mr. Henderson put in. \"Well, we'll\nnot worry about that now.\"\n\nFor several hours the ship traveled on, until it had come to a\ndifferent sort of country. It was wilder and not so level, and there\nwere a number of streams and small lakes to be seen.\n\n\"Are you going to sail all night?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"No,\" replied the professor. \"I think we'll descend very soon now, and\ncamp out for a while. That lake just ahead seems to offer a good\nplace,\" and he pointed to a large sheet of water that sparkled in the\ndistance, for by this time they had all gone back to the conning\ntower.\n\nThe lake was in the midst of a wood that extended for some distance on\nall sides, and was down in a sort of valley. The ship headed toward\nit, and in a short time a landing was made close to shore.\n\n\"Maybe we can have some fresh fish for supper,\" exclaimed Jack as he\nran from the ship as soon as the sliding door in the side was opened.\n\"Looks as if that lake had some in it. It is not thick water like in\nthat stream we stopped at,\" he added.\n\n\"I believe you're right,\" old Andy put in, as he turned back to look\nfor some lines and hooks among his traps. He soon found what he\nwanted, and gave them to the boys, taking his trusty gun along for\nhimself.\n\nWhile the professor, Washington, Tom and Bill remained behind to make\nsome adjustments to the machinery, and to get things in shape for the\nnight, which, they calculated would soon be upon them, Jack, Mark and\nAndy went down to the shore of the lake. The boys cut some poles from\nthe trees, and baiting the hooks with some fat worms found under the\nbark, threw in.\n\n\"Let's see who'll get the first bite,\" spoke Jack. \"I'm pretty\ngenerally lucky at fishing.\"\n\n\"Well, while you're waiting to decide that there contest, I think I'll\ntake a stroll along shore and see if I can see anything to shoot,\"\nAndy remarked.\n\nFor several minutes the boys sat in silence on the bank of the lake,\nwatching the play of the vari-colored lights on the water. Suddenly\nJack felt a quiver on his line, and his pole began to shake.\n\n\"I've got something!\" he cried. Then his pole bent almost double and\nhe began to pull for all he was worth. \"It's a whopper!\" he cried.\n\"Come and help me, Mark!\"\n\nMark ran to his friend's aid. Whatever was on the other end of the\nline was strong enough to tax the muscles of both boys. They could\nhear the pole beginning to break. But for the excellent quality of\nAndy's line that would have parted some time before.\n\nAll at once there came a sudden slacking of the pull from whatever was\nin the water. And so quickly did it cease that both boys went over\nbackward in a heap.\n\n\"He's got away!\" cried Jack, getting up and brushing some of the dirt\nfrom his clothes.\n\n\"There's something that didn't get away!\" cried Mark, who had risen to\nhis knees, and was pointing at the lake. Jack looked and what he saw\nmade him almost believe he was dreaming.\n\nFor, emerging from the water, dragging the pole and line the boys had\ndropped along with it, was a most curious creature. It was a big fish,\nbut a fish with four short legs on which it was walking, or rather\nwaddling along as much as a duck, with a double supply of feet, might\ndo.\n\n\"Say, do I see that or is there something the matter with my eyes?\"\nsung out Jack, making ready to run away.\n\n\"It's there all right!\" exclaimed Mark. \"Hi! Andy! Here's something to\nshoot!\" he yelled, for indeed the creature was big enough to warrant\nattack with a gun. It was about five feet long and two feet through.\n\nOn and on it came, straight at the boys, as if to have revenge for the\npain the fish hook must have caused it, for the barb could be seen\ndangling from its lip. On and on it came, waddling forward, the water\ndripping from it at every step. It had the body and general shape of a\nfish, save that the tail was rather large in proportion. As it came\nnearer the boys noted that the feet were webbed, like those of a water\nfowl.\n\n\"Come on!\" cried Jack. \"It may attack us!\"\n\nAt that moment the creature opened its mouth, showing a triple row of\nformidable teeth, and gave utterance to a sort of groan and grunt\ncombined.\n\nThis was enough to send Jack and Mark off on a run up the bank, and\ndid they stop until they heard Andy's voice hailing them.\n\n\"What's the matter, boys?\"\n\n\"Come here! Quick!\" answered Jack.\n\nThe fish-animal had halted and seemed to be taking an observation. To\ndo this, as it could not turn its neck, it had to shift its whole\nbody. Old Andy came up on the run, his gun held in readiness.\n\n\"Where is it?\" he asked, and the boys pointed silently.\n\nThe hunter could not repress a start of astonishment as he saw the\nstrange creature. But he did not hesitate a second. There was a crack\nof the rifle, and the thing, whatever it was, toppled over, dead.\n\nAndy hurried up to it, to get a closer view.\n\n\"Well, this is the limit!\" he exclaimed. \"First we have grasshoppers\nthat can roll peaches as big as hogsheads, and now we come across fish\nthat walk. I wonder what we will see next.\"\n\n\"I don't want to go fishing in this lake any more,\" spoke Jack, as he\nlooked at the repulsive creature. \"I never want to eat fish any more.\"\n\n\"Same here,\" agreed Mark, and old Andy was of the opinion that the\nthing killed would not make a wholesome dish for the table.\n\n\"There don't seem to be any game in this section,\" he remarked. \"Not a\nsign could I see, nor have I since we have been here, unless you count\nthose grasshoppers. But the fruit is good, I'll say that.\"\n\n\"Come on, we'd better be getting back,\" Mark said, as he noticed it\nwas getting dark. \"I'm hungry.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE SNAKE-TREE\n\n\nTHEY managed to make a good meal of the food supplies they had brought\nalong, and as a dessert Washington made some peach short-cake from the\nslices of the giant fruit they had found, the day before. Just as they\nfinished supper it got very dark, but, in about an hour, the\nmoon-beams, as the travelers called them, came up, and illuminated the\nlake with a weird light.\n\nAs the machinery of the Mermaid was now in working order there was no\nfurther alarm because of the darkness. The ship rested on a level keel\nabout a hundred yards back from the lake, and, seeing that all was\nsnug, and the fastenings secure, the travelers went to bed.\n\nThough they had to forego fish for breakfast the travelers made a good\nmeal. After seeing that the ship was in readiness for a quick start,\nthe professor suggested they take a walk around and see what sort of\ncountry they might be in now.\n\nThey tramped on for several miles, meeting with no adventures, and\nseeing nothing out of the ordinary. It was a pleasant day, just warm\nenough to be comfortable, and a little wind was blowing through the\ntrees.\n\n\"It would be almost like home if it wasn't for the strange lights, and\nthe memory of the queer things here,\" said Jack. \"I feel fine. Let's\nsee if you can hit that dead tree over there, Mark.\"\n\nJack stooped to grab up a stone, but no sooner had his fingers touched\nit than he called out:\n\n\"There! I forgot all about the stones here being heavier than lead.\nGuess we can't throw any of 'em. But come on. I'll race you to the\ndead tree!\"\n\nMark was willing, so the two boys set off at a fast pace.\n\n\"Look out where you're going!\" the professor called after them. \"No\ntelling what may be in those woods,\" for the boys were approaching a\nlittle glade, on the edge of which the dead tree stood.\n\nJack reached the goal first, and stood leaning against the trunk,\nwaiting for Mark.\n\n\"You'd better practice sprinting!\" exclaimed the victor.\n\nMark was about to excuse himself for his poor showing, on the plea of\nhaving eaten too much breakfast, when to his horror he saw what seemed\nto be a long thin snake spring out from the branches of a nearby tree\nand twine itself about Jack.\n\n\"Help me! Save me!\" cried the unfortunate boy, as he was lifted high\ninto the air and pulled within the shadow of the wood.\n\nFor an instant Mark was too horror-stricken to move. Then with a shout\nthat alarmed the others, who were coming along more slowly, he made a\ndash for the place he had last seen Jack.\n\nHad old Andy not been on the watch, with those keen eyes of his, there\nmight have been a double tragedy. He had seen from afar the sudden\nsnatching up of Jack, and noted Mark's rush to save his chum.\n\n\"Stand still! Don't go in there for your life!\" yelled the hunter, at\nthe same time running forward with gun ready.\n\nHis example was followed by the professor, Washington and the other\ntwo men.\n\n\"A snake has Jack!\" called Mark, when Andy was at his side.\n\n\"No! It's not a snake!\" replied the hunter. \"It's worse. It's the\nsnake-tree!\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Mr. Henderson, hurrying up.\n\n\"The snake-tree has Jack,\" the hunter went on. \"It is a plant, half\nanimal, half-vegetable. It has long branches, not unlike a snake in\nshape. They can move about and grab things.\"\n\n\"One of them got a grip on Jack as he leaned against the dead tree\ntrunk. I just caught a glimpse of it, and called to prevent Mark from\nrunning into danger.\"\n\n\"Can't we save him?\" asked Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"I'm going to try!\" replied Andy. \"Quick! Gather up some pieces of dry\nwood. I have some paper, and my pipe lighter. We must fight the\nsnake-tree with fire!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nTHE DESERTED VILLAGE\n\n\nJACK'S Cries were growing fainter and fainter. Peering in through the\nbranches of the dead tree the professor could see the whip-like limbs\nwinding closer and closer about the boy.\n\n\"I am afraid we will be too late!\" he said.\n\nAndy had twisted some paper into a rude torch. He set fire to it with\nhis pocket lighter, and, when Bill and Mark brought him some little\npieces of dead wood the old hunter added them to his bundle, which was\nnow blazing brightly.\n\n\"How are you going to do it?\" asked the professor.\n\n\"I'll show you,\" replied Andy. He bound the sticks and paper together\nwith wisps of grass and then, when it was so hot he could hardly hold\nit longer, he ran as close as he dared to the snake-tree and tossed\nthe torch at the foot of it.\n\nThe blazing bundle fell among some damp leaves and grass, as Andy had\nintended it should, and soon a dense smoke arose, pouring straight up\nthrough the branches of the animal-tree, the limbs of which were\ngathered in a knot about the half-unconscious form of the boy.\n\nFor a few minutes they all waited anxiously. Would Andy's trick\nsucceed? Had the terrible tree not already squeezed the life from\nJack?\n\nBut, while they watched, there seemed to come a change over the tree.\nThe snake-like arms waved less and less. They seemed to straighten\nout, as though deprived of power by the smoke which was now so dense\nas to hide Jack from sight. Then the arms suddenly relaxed and\nsomething rolled from them and fell to the ground. With a quick\nmovement Andy darted in, crawling on his hands and knees beneath the\nlimbs, and brought Jack out. The boy was white and his eyes were\nclosed.\n\n\"Get some water!\" cried the old hunter.\n\nMark ran toward a stream a little distance away. He brought some of\nthe curiously thick liquid in his hat, and while Andy held the boy the\nprofessor sprinkled some of the drops on his face, and forced some\nbetween his lips. In a little while Jack's eyes slowly opened.\n\n\"Don't let it eat me!\" he begged.\n\n\"You're all right now,\" said Andy heartily. \"Not a bit harmed, Jack.\nBut,\" he added in a low tone, \"it was a close call.\"\n\nA few whiffs from a bottle of ammonia the professor carried soon\nbrought Jack's color back.\n\n\"Do you feel better now?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"I guess so. Yes, I'm all right,\" replied Jack, struggling to his\nfeet. \"What happened? Feels as if I had been tied up with a lot of\nrope.\"\n\n\"That's about what you were,\" Andy replied, \"only it was the worst\nkind of rope I ever saw. Those snake-trees are terrible things. I've\nread of 'em, but I never saw one before. The book that told of them\nsays they squeeze their victims to death just as a snake does. The\nonly way to do is to make some smoke and fire at the bottom. This sort\nof kills the branches or makes them stupid and they let go. The trees\nare half animal, and awful things. I hope we don't meet with any\nmore.\"\n\n\"Same here,\" added Jack fervently, as he grasped Andy's hand, and\nthanked him for saving his life.\n\n\"Do you think you can go on, or shall we return to the ship'?\" the\nprofessor asked.\n\n\"Oh I can trail along, if you move a little slowly,\" Jack replied.\n\"I'm a bit stiff, that's all.\"\n\nSo they resumed their journey. They had gone, perhaps, three miles\nwhen Washington, who was in the lead, suddenly stopped and called:\n\n\"Sounds like thunder.\"\n\nThe others listened. Sure enough there was a dull rumble and roar\naudible. It seemed off to the left, but they could see no clouds in\nthe sky, nor any signs of a storm.\n\n\"Let's take a walk over that way and see what it is,\" Mr. Henderson\nsuggested.\n\nAs they walked on the noise became louder, until in about half an hour\nit was like the sound from a blast furnace.\n\n\"What do you suppose it can be?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"Perhaps some new freak of nature,\" the professor replied. \"We seem to\nhave a good many of them here.\"\n\nThey were all on their guard now, for there was no telling into what\ndanger they might run. As they went up a little hill the noise became\nmuch louder. The professor and Andy, who had taken the lead, kept a\nsharp lookout ahead, that they might not unexpectedly fall into some\nhidden stream or lake. As they topped the hill they saw before them a\ndeep valley, and in the midst of it was that which was causing the\nroaring sound.\n\nFrom the centre of an immense mound of rock and earth there spouted up\na great column of water, three hundred feet or more, as straight as a\nflag staff. It was about ten feet in diameter, and at the top it broke\ninto a rosette of sparkling liquid, which as the vari-colored lights\nplayed on it, resembled some wonderful flower.\n\n\"It's a great geyser!\" the professor exclaimed. \"We have come to a\nplace like Yellowstone Park. We must be very careful. The crust may be\nvery thin here, and let us down into some boiling spring.\"\n\nThe others gathered around the professor, and, from a safe distance\nwatched the ever rising and falling shaft of water.\n\nIt was not regular in motion. Sometimes it would shoot up to a great\ndistance, nearly a thousand feet, the professor estimated. Again it\nwould sink down, as the power sending it out lessened, until it was\nonly a few hundred feet above the rounded top of the mound from which\nit spurted. But it never fell below this. All the while there was the\nconstant roaring sound, as though the forces of nature below the\nsurface were calling to be let out.\n\n\"I hope there are not many of those about,\" Mr. Henderson remarked\nafter a pause. \"If the ship should hit one during the night it would\nbe all up with us. We must keep a careful look-out.\"\n\nThe spouting column had a fascination which held them to the spot for\nsome time. From the hill they had a good view of the surrounding\ncountry, but did not see any more geysers.\n\n\"Do you think it is hot water?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"There is no vapor,\" the professor answered, \"but most of the geysers\nare produced by the action of steam in the interior of the earth.\nHowever we'll not take any chances by investigating. I fear it would\nnot be safe to go into that valley.\"\n\n\"Look there!\" cried Andy. \"I guess we're better off here!\" He pointed\na little to the right of where the water spouted. The others looked,\nand saw, coming from a hole in the ground, some shaggy black object.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"It looks like a bear,\" replied the hunter, \"but I never saw one like\nit before.\"\n\nNor had any of the others, for the creature was a terrible one. It had\nthe body of a bear, but the feet and legs were those of an alligator,\nwhile the tail trailed out behind like a snake, and the head had a\nlong snout, not unlike the trunk of an elephant. The creature was\nabout ten feet long and five feet in height.\n\n\"Let me try a shot at it!\" exclaimed Andy. \"That is something worth\nshooting,\" and he cocked his rifle.\n\n\"Don't!\" exclaimed the professor shortly. \"You might only wound it,\nand it would pursue us. We are not ready to fight such creatures as\nthat, and you are the only one armed.\"\n\n\"I never missed anything I aimed at yet,\" said Andy, a little hurt\nthat any one should doubt his ability to kill at the first shot.\n\n\"Perhaps not, but how do you know but what this creature has a bullet\nproof armor under its hide. This is a strange world, Andy. It is\nbetter to take no chances.\"\n\n\"I hate to see him get away,\" the hunter said.\n\nBut, as it happened, the beast was not to get away. As they watched\nthey saw the horrible animal approach the mound from which the water\nspurted. Up the sides it climbed.\n\n\"I guess he's going to get a drink,\" said Mark.\n\nThat was evidently the beast's intention. It went close to the\nspouting column of water, and thrust its head out so that its tongue\ncould lap from the side. It seemed to have been in the habit of doing\nthis.\n\nFor once, and for the last time, however, it made a mistake. The water\nseemed to veer to one side. In its eagerness to get a drink the animal\ntook another step forward. At that moment the direction of the column\nchanged again, and it tilted over toward the beast.\n\nSuddenly, as the travelers watched, the full force of the big column\ncaught the beast just under the fore shoulders. Up into the air the\ncreature shot, propelled by thousands of pounds pressure. Right up to\nthe top of the column it went, and this time the water rose a thousand\nfeet into the air.\n\nUp and up went the animal, struggling to get away from the remorseless\ngrip. Then, when the water had reached its height, it shot the beast\noff to one side. Then the brute began to fall, twisting, turning,\nwiggling and struggling. Down it came with a thud that could be heard\nabove the noise of the geyser.\n\n\"I reckon that finishes him,\" observed Andy. And it had, for there was\nnot a sign of life from the creature.\n\n\"I guess we have seen enough for one morning,\" the professor said,\n\"Let's go back to the airship. It must be nearly dinner time.\"\n\nThey started away. Mark gave a last look at the queer column of water\nand the dead body of the strange animal. As he passed down the hill he\nthought he saw the creature move, and stayed to see if this was so.\nBut a second glance convinced him he was mistaken.\n\nThe others had gone on and were some distance ahead. Mark hurried on\nto join them. As he got a last glance at the top of the column, over\nthe brow of the hill, he happened to look off to the left. There was\nanother hill, about the size of the one they had been on.\n\nAnd, as Mark looked he saw something move. At first he thought it was\nanother beast. But, to his terror he saw that the creature had only\ntwo legs, and that it stood upright like a man, but such a man as Mark\nhad never seen before, for he was nearly twelve feet tall.\n\nHe was about to cry out and warn the others, when the thing, whatever\nit was, sunk down, apparently behind some tall bushes, and disappeared\nas if the earth had opened and swallowed it.\n\n\"I wonder if I had better tell them,\" thought Mark. \"I can't show them\nanything. I wonder if I really saw it, or if it was only a shadow. I\nguess I'll say nothing. But it is very strange.\"\n\nThen he hurried on to join the others.\n\n\"What makes you so pale?\" asked Jack of his chum.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Mark, somewhat confused. \"I guess I'm a little tired,\nthat's all.\"\n\nThey reached the ship in safety, and, having dinner started the\nmachinery and took the Mermaid up into the air.\n\n\"We'll travel on and see if we can't find some human beings,\" the\nprofessor said.\n\nAll that afternoon they sailed, the country below them unfolding like\na panorama. They passed over big lakes, sailing on the surface of\nsome, and over rivers, and vast stretches of forest and dreary plains.\nBut they never saw a sign of human inhabitants.\n\nIt was getting on to five o'clock, the hour when the brilliant lights\nusually disappeared, when Mark, who was steering in the conning tower,\ngave a cry.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked the professor, looking up from a rude map he was\nmaking of the land they had just traversed.\n\n\"It looks like a town before us,\" said the boy.\n\nMr. Henderson and Jack looked to where Mark pointed. A few miles ahead\nand below them were great mounds, not unlike that from which the\ngeyser had spouted. But they were arranged in regular form, like\nhouses on a street, row after row of them. And, as they approached\nnearer, they could see that the mounds had doors and windows to them.\nSome of the mounds wer rger than others, and some were of double and\ntriple formation.\n\n\"It's a city! The first city of the new world!\" cried Jack.\n\n\"It is a deserted village!\" said the professor. \"We have found where\nthe people live, but we have not found them.\" And he was right, for\nthere was not a sign of life about the place, over which the airship\nwas now suspended.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nTHE GIANTS\n\n\n\"LET'S go down and investigate,\" suggested Jack.\n\n\"Better wait,\" counseled the professor. \"It will soon be dark, and,\nthough we will have moonlight, we can not see to advantage. I think it\nwill be best to keep the ship in the air to-night, and descend in the\nmorning. Then we can look about and decide on what to do.\"\n\nThey all agreed this was the best plan, and, after making a circle\nabove the deserted village, and noting no signs of life, the Mermaid\nwas brought to a halt over the centre of the town, and about three\nhundred feet above it. There the travelers would be comparatively\nsafe.\n\nIt was deemed best to keep watch that night, and so, Mark, Jack, Bill\nand Tom took turns, though there was nothing for them to do, as not a\nthing happened. With the first appearance of dawn Mr. Henderson gave\norders to have the ship lowered, and it came to rest in the middle of\nwhat corresponded to a street in the queer mound village.\n\n\"Now to see what kind of people have lived here!\" cried Jack. \"They\nmust have been a queer lot. Something like the Esquimaux, only they\nprobably had more trouble keeping cool than the chaps up at the north\npole do.\"\n\nNow that they were down among the mound houses, they saw that the\ndwellings were much larger than they had supposed. They towered high\nabove the boys' heads, and some of them were large enough in area to\nhave accomodated a company of soldiers.\n\n\"Say, the chaps who lived in these must have been some pumpkins,\" said\nJack. \"Why the ceilings are about fifteen feet high, and the doors\nalmost the same! Talk about giants! I guess we've struck where they\nused to hang out, at any rate.\"\n\nThe houses were a curious mixture of clay and soft stone. There were\ndoors, with big skins from animals as curtains, and the windows were\ndevoid of glass. Instead of stairs there were rude ladders, and the\nfurniture in the mound houses was of the roughest kind.\n\nThere were fire-places in some of the houses, and the blackened and\nsmoked walls showed that they must have been used. In one or two of\nthe houses clay dishes, most of them broken, were scattered about, and\nthe size of them, in keeping with everything else, indicated that\nthose who used them were of no small stature.\n\n\"Some of the bowls would do for bath tubs,\" said Jack, as he came\nacross one or two large ones.\n\nBy this time the professor, Bill and Tom had joined the boys, and the\nfive went on with the exploring tour, while Washington and Andy\nremained in the ship to get breakfast.\n\n\"The inhabitants are evidently of a half-civilized race,\" the\nprofessor said. \"Their houses, and the manner in which they live, show\nthem to be allied to the Aztecs, though of course they are much larger\nthan that race.\"\n\n\"What's bothering me,\" Bill said, \"is not so much what race they\nbelong to, as what chance we'd stand in a race with them if they took\nit into their heads to chase after us. I've read that them there\nAzhandled races----\"\n\n\"You mean the Aztecs,\" interrupted the professor.\n\n\"Well the Aztecs, then. But I've read they used to place their enemies\non a stone altar and cut their hearts out. Now I'm not hankerin' after\nanything like that.\"\n\n\"Don't be foolish,\" spoke Mr. Henderson. \"Wait until you meet some of\nthe giants, if that is what they are, and then you can decide what to\ndo.\"\n\n\"It may be too late then,\" remarked Bill in a low tone, and the boys\nwere somewhat inclined to agree with him.\n\nHowever, there seemed to be no immediate danger, as there was no sign\nof any of the big people about the village. The adventurers walked\nabout for some time, but made no discoveries that would throw any\nlight on the reason for the place being left uninhabited. It seemed as\nif there had been a sudden departure from the place, for in a number\nof the houses the remains of half-cooked meals were seen.\n\n\"Well, I think we have noted enough for the time being,\" the professor\nremarked, after they had traversed almost half the length of what\nseemed to be the principal street. \"Let's go back to the ship and have\nsomething to eat. Washington may have become alarmed at our absence.\"\n\nThey made a circle in order to take in another part of the town on\ntheir way back. While passing through a sort of alley, though it was\nonly narrow by comparison with the other thoroughfares that were very\nwide, Mark came to a place where there was a circular slab of stone,\nresting on the ground. In the centre was a big iron ring.\n\n\"Hello! Here's something new!\" he exclaimed. \"Maybe it leads to a\nsecret passage, or covers some hidden treasure.\"\n\n\"I guess it will have to continue to cover it then,\" Jack spoke. \"That\nprobably weighs several tons. None of us could move it.\"\n\nThey made their way back to the ship, where they found Washington and\nAndy discussing the advisability of going off in search of them.\n\n\"Breakfast is mighty near spoiled,\" said the colored man with an\ninjured air.\n\nBut the travelers did full justice to the meal, notwithstanding this.\nDeciding there was nothing to be gained by staying in that vicinity,\nthe professor started the ship off again.\n\nThey traveled several hundred miles in the air, and, as the afternoon\nwas coming to a close, Jack, who was in charge of the conning tower,\nspied, just ahead of them, another village.\n\n\"We will descend there for the night,\" the professor said. \"Does there\nseem to be any sign of life about?\"\n\n\"None,\" replied Mark, who was observing through a telescope the town\nthey were approaching. \"It's as dead as the other one.\"\n\nThe airship settled down in a field back of some of the mound houses.\n\n\"Now for supper!\" cried Jack. \"I'm as hungry as----\"\n\nHe stopped short, for, seeming to rise from the very ground, all about\nthe ship, there appeared a throng of men. And such men as they were!\nFor not one was less than ten feet tall, and some were nearly fifteen!\n\n\"The giants have us!\" cried Bill, as he saw the horde of creatures\nsurrounding the ship.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nHELD BY THE ENEMY\n\n\n\"KEEP the doors closed!\" cried the professor. \"It is our only hope! I\nwill send the ship up again!\"\n\nBut it was too late. Washington, who had obeyed the signal from the\nconning tower to shut off the engines, had disconnected most of them\nso they could not be started again save from the main room. At the\nsame time there came a yell of dismay from the colored man, who had\nslid back the steel covering of the main side entrance to the Mermaid.\n\n\"I'm caught!\" cried Washington.\n\nAs the professor and the boys hurried from the tower, they could hear\na struggle from where Washington was, and his voice calling:\n\n\"Let me go! Let me go!\"\n\nReaching the engine room, which opened directly on the side entrance,\nthe professor saw a pair of enormous hands and arms dragging poor\nWashington, feet first, out of the ship. Bill and Tom were crouched in\none corner, pale with fright.\n\n\"Wait until I get my gun!\" cried Andy, as he ran for his rifle.\n\n\"Hold on!\" called the professor in a loud voice. \"It will be folly to\nshoot them! We must try strategy!\"\n\nWashington's cries ceased as he was drawn entirely from the ship, the\ngiant hands disappearing at the same time.\n\n\"Follow me!\" yelled Mr. Henderson, running out of the door.\n\nHardly knowing what they did, the boys went after him, and their\nhearts almost stopped beating in fright as they saw the terrible\nthings, which, in the glare of the changing lights, were on every side\nof them.\n\nFor the men were very repulsive looking. They there attired in\nclothes, very similar in cut to those worn by the travelers, and which\nseemed to be made of some sort of cloth. But they were loose and baggy\nand only added to the queer appearance of the giants. Veritable giants\nthey were too. Their faces seemed as large as kegs, and they were so\nclumsy in shape that Mark, even, frightened as he was, exclaimed:\n\n\"They look like men made of putty!\" At the same time he saw they bore\na resemblance to the creature he had observed on the hill top.\n\n\"What shall we do?\" asked Andy of the professor. \"They are really\ncarrying Washington away!\"\n\nThree of the giants were dragging the colored man along the ground,\nwhile the other terrible beings stood about as if waiting to see the\noutcome of the first sally.\n\n\"I will try to speak to them,\" Mr. Henderson said. \"I know several\nlanguages. They may understand one.\"\n\nBut before he could start on his parley a surprising thing happened.\nThere was a struggle in the little group about Washington. The colored\nman seemed to be fighting, though the odds, it would appear, were too\ngreat to enable him to accomplish anything. But, making a desperate\neffort to escape, Washington quickly wrenched himself free from the\ngiants' hands and then, striking out with his fists, knocked the three\ndown, one after another.\n\n\"I never knew Washington was so strong!\" exclaimed Jack.\n\n\"Nor I,\" put in Mark. \"Why I should think the men could carry him in\none arm as if he was a baby.\"\n\nThe three giants rose slowly to their feet. They uttered strange\ncries, and motioned with their hands toward the professor, the boys,\nand the others in the crowd.\n\n\"Look out! They're goin' t' grab yo'!\" cried Washington.\n\nThree of the giants approached Mark, and a like number closed in on\nJack.\n\n\"Back to the ship!\" cried the professor. \"We must defend ourselves!\"\n\nBut by this time the big men had grabbed the two boys. Then a strange\nthing took place. Mark and Jack, though they felt that the giants must\novercome them in a test of strength, struggled with all their might\nagainst being captured. They fought, as a cornered rat will fight,\nthough it knows the odds to be overwhelming. But in this case the\nunexpected happened.\n\nBoth boys found they could easily break the holds of the giants, and\nMark, by a vigorous effort, pushed the three men away from him, one at\na time violently so that they fell in a heap, one on top of the other.\n\n\"Hurrah! We can fight 'em!\" cried Mark. \"Don't be afraid. They're like\nmush! They're putty men!\"\n\nAnd, so it seemed, the giants were. Though big in size they were\nflabby and had nothing like the muscle they should have had in\nproportion to their build. They went down like meal sacks and were\nslow to rise.\n\nJack, seeing how successful his comrade was, attacked the three giants\nwho were striving to make him a captive. He succeeded in disposing of\nthem, knocking one down so hard that the man was unable to rise until\nhis companions helped him.\n\n\"That's the way!\" cried Washington. \"They're soft as snow men!\"\n\nThe vanquished giants set up a sort of roar, which was answered by\ntheir fellows, and soon there was a terrible din.\n\n\"All get together!\" called the professor. \"They are evidently going to\nmake a rush for us. If we stand by one another we may fight them off,\nthough they outnumber us a hundred to one. Besides it will soon be\ndark, and we may be able to escape!\"\n\nWashington, Jack and Mark retreated toward the ship, in the direction\nof which the others had also made their way. The big men had gathered\nin a compact mass and were advancing on the adventurers.\n\n\"What do you suppose makes them so soft?\" asked Mark. \"I believe I\ncould manage half a dozen.\"\n\n\"It must be the effect of the climate and conditions here,\" the\nprofessor replied. \"Probably they have to be big to stand the pressure\nof the thick water, and the increased attraction of gravitation. Then\ntoo, being without the weight of the atmosphere to which we are\naccustomed, they have probably expanded. If they were to go up to\nearth, they might shrink to our size.\"\n\n\"Do you think that possible?\"\n\n\"Of course. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Nothing in particular,\" replied Mark. But to himself, he added: \"That\nwould explain it all.\"\n\nIt was getting dusk now. The travelers had reached their ship, and\nrushed inside and tried to close the doors in the face of the\nadvancing horde. But, by this time the giants were so close that one\nor two of them thrust their big feet in, and prevented this movement.\nAt the same time they set up a great howling.\n\n\"Quick!\" cried the professor. \"We must start the ship and get away!\"\n\n\"I can't close the door!\" yelled Washington, who had been the last to\nenter.\n\n\"Never mind that! Go up with it open! Drag them along if they won't\nlet go!\" answered Mr. Henderson, as he ran toward the engine room.\n\nThere was a sudden rush among the giants, and a sound as if something\nwas being thrown over the top and ends of the ship. Mark turned the\ngas machine on, while Jack worked the negative gravity apparatus. They\nwaited for the ship to rise.\n\n\"Why don't we go up?\" asked the professor.\n\n\"'Cause they've caught us!\" called out Washington.\n\n\"Caught us? How?\"\n\n\"They've thrown ropes over the top and ends of the ship, and fastened\nthem to their big houses!\"\n\nRunning to a side window the professor saw that the Mermaid was\nfastened down by a score of cables, each one six inches thick. They\nwere held captives by the enemy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nA FRIEND INDEED\n\n\nTHOUGH the giants, man for man, were no match for the travelers,\ncollectively the horde proved too much. They had swarmed about the\nship, and, by passing the big cables over her, effectively held her\ndown.\n\n\"Let me get out and I'll cut 'em!\" cried Andy. \"We must get away from\nthese savages!\"\n\n\"No, no, don't go out!\" exclaimed the professor. \"They would\neventually kill you, though you might fight them off for a time. We\nmust wait and see what develops. They can have no object in harming\nus, as we have not injured them.\"\n\n\"I'd rather fight 'em,\" insisted the old hunter.\n\nBut the professor had his way and Andy was forced to obey. The giants\nhad withdrawn their big feet from the side door and Washington had\nclosed it. But nothing else had been accomplished, and the ship could\nnot rise. The gas and negative gravity machines were stopped, as they\nwere only under a useless strain.\n\nSuddenly, the colored lights which had been growing dimmer and dimmer,\nwith the approach of night, went out altogether. Almost as suddenly,\nMark, who was watching the giants from the conning tower, as they made\nfast the loose ends of the cables, saw them make a dash for the mound\nhouses.\n\n\"They're afraid of the dark!\" he cried. \"Come on! We can go out now\nand loosen the ropes!\"\n\nHe hurried to tell the professor what he had noticed.\n\n\"Good!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson. \"Perhaps we can escape now!\"\n\nThey waited a few minutes, listening to the sound of many big feet\nrunning away from the ship, and then, Bill cautiously opened the side\ndoor. The others were behind him, waiting, with knives and hatchets in\ntheir hands, to rush out and cut the restraining cables.\n\n\"All ready!\" called Bill. \"There doesn't seem to be a one in sight!\"\n\nHe stepped out but no sooner had he set foot on the ground than there\ncame a thud, and Bill went down as if some one had knocked his feet\nfrom under him.\n\n\"Go back! Go back!\" he cried. \"They hit me with something. I'm being\nsmothered!\"\n\n\"Bring a light!\" cried the professor, for the sally had been started\nin the dark.\n\nJack brought the portable electric it having been repaired and flashed\nit out of the door. In the gleam of it, Bill was seen lying prostrate,\nhalf covered by an orange, about half as big as himself. The fruit was\nas soft and mushy as some of the giants themselves, or Bill would not\nhave fared so easily.\n\nThen, as the others stood watching, and while Bill arose and wiped\nsome of the juice from his face, there came a regular shower of the\nmonstrous oranges.\n\n\"Get inside quick! We'll be smothered under them!\" Mr. Henderson\ncried.\n\nPausing only to rescue Bill, the adventurers retreated inside the\nship, and made fast the door. Outside they could hear the thud as the\noranges were thrown, some hitting the Flying Mermaid and many dropping\nall about her.\n\n\"I guess they are going to have things their own way,\" observed Bill,\nas he gazed down on his clothes, which were covered with juice from\nthe fruit.\n\nThe night was one of anxiety. The travelers took turns standing guard,\nbut nothing more occurred. The giants remained in their houses, and\nthe heavy ropes still held the ship fast.\n\n\"We must hold a council of war,\" the professor decided as they\ngathered at breakfast, which was far from a cheerful meal.\n\nWith the return of the colored lights the giants again made their\nappearance. They came swarming from the mound houses, and a great\ncrowd they proved to be. Several thousand at least, Jack estimated,\nand when he went up into the conning tower and took a survey he could\nsee the strange and terrible creatures pouring in from the surrounding\ncountry.\n\n\"I'm afraid there will be trouble,\" he said, as he came down and\nreported what he had seen.\n\n\"We must hold a council of war,\" repeated the professor. \"Has any one\nanything to suggest?\"\n\n\"Get a lot of powder and blow 'em up!\" cried Andy.\n\n\"Arrange electric wires and shock 'em to death!\" was Bill's plan.\n\n\"Can't we slip the ropes in some way and escape?\" asked Jack. \"I don't\nbelieve we can successfully fight the giants. They are too many, even\nif they are weak, individually.\"\n\n\"I think you're right there,\" Mr. Henderson said. \"We must try some\nsort of strategy, but what? That is the question.\"\n\nFor a few minutes no one spoke. They were all thinking deeply, for\ntheir lives might hang in the balance.\n\n\"I think I have a plan,\" said Mark, at length. \"Did we bring any\ndiving suits with us?\"\n\n\"There may be one or two,\" the professor replied. \"But what good will\nthey do?\"\n\n\"Two of us could put them on,\" continued Mark, \"and, as they afford\ngood protection from any missiles like fruit, we could crawl out on\nthe deck of the ship. From there, armed with hatchets or knives we\ncould cut the ropes. Then the ship could rise.\"\n\n\"That's a good plan!\" cried the scientist. \"We'll try it at once.\"\n\nSearch revealed that two diving suits were among the stores of the\nMermaid. Jack and Mark wanted to be the ones to don them, but as the\nsuits were rather large, and as the professor thought it would take\nmore strength than the boys had to do the work, it was decided that\nAndy and Washington should make the attempt to cut the ropes.\n\nThe hunter and colored man lost little time in getting into the modern\narmor. In the meanwhile Jack, who had been posted as a lookout,\nreported that there seemed to be some activity among the giants. They\nwere running here and there, and some seemed to be going off toward\nthe woods, that were not far away.\n\n\"Now work quickly,\" urged the professor. \"We will be on the watch, and\nas soon as the last rope is cut we will start the machinery and send\nthe ship up. We will not wait for you to come back inside, so hold\nfast as best you can when the Mermaid rises.\"\n\n\"We will,\" answered Andy, just before the big copper helmet was\nfastened on his head, and Washington nodded to show he understood.\n\nThe two who were to attempt the rescue of their comrades were soon on\ndeck. In the conning tower Jack and the professor kept anxious watch,\nwhile Mark, Bill and Tom were at the various machines, ready, at the\nsignal, to start the engines.\n\nThe giants had now become so interested in whatever plan they had\nafoot, that they paid little attention to the ship. Consequently\nWashington and Andy, crawling along the deck in their diving suits,\ndid not, at first attract any attention.\n\nIn fact they had cut several of the big ropes, and it began to look as\nif the plan would succeed, particularly as they were partly hidden\nfrom view by the upper gas holder. They were working with feverish\nhaste, sawing away at the big cables with keen knives.\n\n\"I guess we'll beat 'em yet!\" cried Jack.\n\n\"I hope so,\" replied the professor. \"It looks----\"\n\nHe stopped short, for at that moment a cry arose from the midst of the\ngiants, and one of them pointed toward the ship. An instant later the\nair was darkened with a flight of big oranges, which the queer\ncreatures seemed to favor as missiles. Probably they found stones too\nheavy.\n\n\"Well, those things can't hurt 'em much with those heavy suits on,\"\nobserved Mr. Henderson. \"There, Washington got one right on the head\nthat time, and it didn't bother him a bit.\"\n\nJack had seen the fruit strike the big copper helmet and observed that\nthe colored man only moved his head slightly in order to get rid of\nthe orange.\n\nIn fact the giants, seeing for themselves that this mode of warfare\nwas not going to answer, since the two men on the ship continued to\ncut the restraining cables, gave it up. There was a good deal of\nshouting among them, and a number ran here and there, seemingly\ngathering up long poles.\n\n\"I wonder if they are going to try the flailing method, and beat poor\nAndy and Washington,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"It looks so.\"\n\nThe two rescuers were now about a quarter through their hard task. The\nthrowing of the oranges had ceased. But the giants were up to a new\ntrick. They divided into two sections, one taking up a position on one\nside of the ship, and the other on the opposite. There were about two\nhundred in each crowd, while the others in the horde drew some\ndistance back.\n\n\"They're up to some queer dodge,\" observed Jack. \"What are they\nplacing those sticks to their mouths for?\"\n\nThe professor observed the throng curiously for a few seconds. Then he\nexclaimed:\n\n\"They are using blow-guns! They are going to shoot arrows at\nWashington and Andy! We must get them in at once!\"\n\nHe darted toward a door that opened from the conning tower out on the\ndeck.\n\n\"Don't go!\" cried Jack. \"It's too late! They are beginning to blow!\"\n\nHe pointed to the throng of giants. The professor could see their\ncheeks puffed out as the big creatures filled their lungs with air and\nprepared to expel it through the hollow tubes.\n\nThen there came a sound as if a great wind was blowing. It howled and\nroared over the ship, not unlike a hurricane in its fury. But there\nwas no flight of arrows through the air, such as would have come from\nregular blow guns.\n\n\"That is strange,\" said the professor. He thought for a moment. \"I\nhave it!\" he cried. \"They are trying to blow Washington and Andy, off\nthe ship by the power of their breaths! They are not blowing arrows at\nthem! My, but they must have strong lungs!\"\n\nAnd, in truth, that was the plan of the giants. The hollow tubes, made\nfrom some sort of big weed, sent a blast of air at the two men on the\nship's deck, that made them lie flat and cling with both hands to\navoid being sent flying into the midst of the giants, on one side or\nthe other. But the giants had reckoned without the weight of the\ndiving suits, and it was those, with the big lead soles of the shoes,\nthat helped to hold Washington and Andy in place.\n\n\"Come back! Came back!\" cried the professor, opening the conning tower\ndoor and calling to the two brave men. \"Come back, both of you! Do you\nhear?\"\n\nAs the portal slid back the rush of air was almost like that of a\ncyclone. Then it suddenly ceased, as the giants saw their plan was not\nlikely to succeed.\n\nBut now there arose from the outer circle of the horde a shout of\ntriumph. It was caused by the return of those who had, a little while\nbefore, hurried off to the woods. They came back bearing big trees,\ntall and slender, stripped of their branches, so that they resembled\nflag staffs. It took a dozen giants to carry each one.\n\nThe whole throng was soon busy laying the poles in a row in front of\nthe ship.\n\n\"What can they be up to now?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"It looks as if they were going to slide the ship along on rollers,\"\nthe professor replied.\n\nSure enough this was the giant's plan. A few minutes later those in\nthe Mermaid felt her moving forward, as the giants, massed behind,\nshoved. On to the poles she slid. The ropes were loosened to permit\nthis, but not enough to enable the boat to rise.\n\nThen the travelers felt the ship being lifted up.\n\n\"They are going to carry us away, with the poles for a big stretcher!\"\ncried the professor.\n\nLooking from the side windows the boys saw that a great crowd of the\nbig men were on either side of the Mermaid, each giant grasping a\npole, and lifting. Farther out were others, holding the ends of the\ncables which Washington and Andy had not succeeded in cutting.\n\nThe ship was being carried along by a thousand or more giants, as the\nancient warriors, slain in battle, were carried home on the spears of\ntheir comrades.\n\n\"This is the end of the Mermaid!\" murmured Mr. Henderson in sorrowful\ntones.\n\nAs they looked from the conning tower the professor and the two boys\nobserved a commotion among the leaders of the giants. They seemed to\nbe wavering. Suddenly the forward part of the ship sank, as those\nahead laid their poles down on the ground. Then those behind did the\nsame, and the Mermaid, came to a stop, and once more rested on the\nearth.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" asked the scientist in wonder.\n\nAll at once the entire crowd of giants threw themselves down on their\nfaces, and there, standing at the bow of the ship, was a giant, half\nagain as large as any of the others. He was clad in a complete suit of\ngolden armor on which the changing lights played with beautiful\neffect, and in his hand he held an immense golden sword. He pointed\nthe weapon at the ship as if he had raised it in protection, and his\nhand was stretched in commanding gesture over the prostrate giants.\n\n\"Perhaps he has come to save us!\" cried Mark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nA GREAT JOURNEY\n\n\nSUCH indeed, seemed to be the case. The golden-armored giant, after\nstanding for a few moments in an attitude of command, waved his sword\nthree times about his head, and uttered a command, in a voice that\nsounded like thunder. Then the prostrate ones arose, and, making low\nbows hurried away in all directions.\n\nWatching them disappear, the golden one sheathed his weapon and\napproached the ship. He caught sight of the professor and the two boys\nin the conning tower, for Mark had gone there when he found the ship\nbeing transported, and held up his two hands, the palms outward.\n\n\"It is the sign of peace in the language all natives employ,\" said the\nprofessor. \"I think I shall trust him.\"\n\nFollowed by the boys he descended from the little platform in the\ntower, and to the door that opened on the deck.\n\n\"Shall we go out?\" he asked.\n\n\"We can't be much worse off,\" replied Mark. \"Let's chance it.\"\n\nSo, not without many misgivings, they slid back the portal and stepped\nout to face the strange and terrible being who had so suddenly come to\ntheir rescue.\n\nThe giant in the golden armor did not seem surprised to see them. In\nfact he acted as though he rather expected them. He continued to hold\nup one hand, with the palm, outward, while, with the other, he removed\nhis helmet and bowed low. Then he cast his sword on the ground and\nadvanced toward the ship. When within ten feet he sat down on the\nground, and this brought his head nearer the earth, so that his\nauditors could both see and hear him to better advantage.\n\nAs soon as the giant saw the travelers were outside their ship he\nbegan to speak to them in a voice, which, though he might have meant\nit to be low and gentle, was like the bellowing of a bull. At the same\ntime he made many gestures, pointing to the ship, to himself and to\nMark.\n\n\"What is he saying, professor?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"I can't understand all he says,\" Mr. Henderson replied. \"He uses some\nwords derived from the Latin and some from the Greek. But by piecing\nit out here and there, and by interpreting his motions I am able to\nget at something.\"\n\n\"And what is it all about?\"\n\n\"It is a strange story,\" the scientist replied. \"He has only gone\nabout half way through it. Wait until he finishes and I will tell\nyou.\"\n\nThe golden-armored giant, who had stopped in his narrative while Jack\nwas speaking, resumed. His gestures became more rapid, and his words\ncame faster. Several times Mr. Henderson held up his hand for him to\ncease, while he puzzled out what was meant.\n\nAt one point, the professor seemed much startled, and motioned for the\nstrange being to repeat the last part of his discourse. When this had\nbeen done Mr. Henderson shook his head as though in doubt.\n\nAt length the story was finished, and the lone giant, for there were\nno others in sight now, folded his arms and seemed to await what the\nprofessor's answer might be. Mr. Henderson turned to the boys, and to\nthe others of the Mermaid's company, who, by this time, had joined\nhim, and said:\n\n\"Friends, I have just listened to a strange story. It is so strange\nthat, but for the fact that our own adventures are verging on the\nmarvelous, I could hardly believe it. In the first place, this man\nhere is the king of this country. That is why all the other natives\nobeyed him.\n\n\"In the second place it seems he has been a passenger in our boat, and\ncame here from the earth's surface with us!\"\n\n\"What's that?\" cried Jack.\n\n\"That explains the strange happenings!\" ejaculated Mark. \"No wonder I\ncould never solve the secret of the storeroom.\"\n\n\"You are right, it does,\" replied Mr. Henderson. \"I will not go into\nall the details of how it happened, but it seems the big hole through\nwhich we came is only one of two entrances to this inner world. Rather\nit is the entrance, and there is another, close to it, which is the\nexit. Through the latter a big stream of water spouts up, just as one\npours down through the opening we used.\n\n\"Hankos, which is the name of the king, was for many years a student\nof science. He longed to see where the big stream of upward spurting\nwater went, and wanted to know whence came the down-pouring one. So he\nundertook a daring experiment.\n\n\"He constructed a great cylinder, and, keeping his plans a secret,\nconveyed it to the spouting water, entered it, and, by means of\npulleys and levers, after he had shut himself inside, cast himself\ninto the up-shooting column. He took along compressed air cylinders to\nsupply an atmosphere he could breathe, and some food to eat, for it\nappears our giant friends are something of inventors in their way. The\ncurrent of water bore him to the surface of the earth, and he was cast\nup on the ocean, in what was probably taken for a waterspout if any\none saw it.\n\n\"Then a strange thing happened. No sooner did Hankos open his\ncylinder, which served him as a boat, than he lost his gigantic size,\nowing to the difference of the two atmospheres. He became almost of\nthe same size as ourselves, except that his skin hung in great folds\non him, and he seemed like a wrinkled old man. His clothes too, were a\nworld too large.\n\n\"He had a terrible time before he reached shore, and a hard one after\nit, for his strange appearance turned almost every one against him. He\nwas sorry he had ventured to solve the mystery of the up-shooting\nstream of water, for he was worse than an outcast.\n\n\"Then he began to plan to get back to his own inner world. But he\ncould not find the downward stream, and, not knowing the language of\nthe countries where he landed, he had no means of ascertaining. He\ntraveled from place to place, always seeking for something that would\nlead him back to his own country.\n\n\"Finally he heard of us, and of our ship, though how I do not know, as\nI thought I had kept it a great secret. By almost superhuman struggles\nhe made his way to our island. He says he concealed himself aboard the\nMermaid the night before we sailed, but I hardly believe it possible.\nIt seems----\"\n\n\"He did it, for I saw him!\" interrupted Mark.\n\n\"You saw him!\" cried Mr. Henderson.\n\nThen Mark told of the many things that had puzzled him so, how he had\nseen the queer figure slinking aboard the boat, of the disappearance\nof food from time to time, and of the strange noises in the storeroom.\n\n\"That bears out what he told me,\" the professor said. \"Hankos says he\nused to steal out nights and take what food he could get, and he also\nmentions some one, answering to Mark's description, who nearly\ndiscovered him once as he hurried back into the apartment.\n\n\"However, it seems to be true, since Mark confirms it. At any rate\nHankos stayed in hiding, and made the entire trip with us, and, just\nas we all became overcome with the strange gas he escaped, having\nbegun to expand to his original giant size, and being unable to remain\nany longer in his cramped quarters.\"\n\n\"That's so, he did!\" cried Mark. \"I saw him come out of the place just\nbefore I lost my senses. It was a terrible sight, and none of you\nwould believe me when I told you some of the occurrences afterward.\"\n\n\"You must forgive us for that,\" the professor said. \"We have learned\nmuch since then.\"\n\n\"What did Hankos do after he left the ship when it landed in this\ncountry?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"He traveled until he came to this village, which is the chief one of\nthis country,\" replied the professor. \"Part of the time he followed us\nat a distance, being able to travel very fast.\"\n\nMark remembered the strange figure of a giant he had seen on the hill\ntops several times, and knew that he had been observing the being who\nhad played such a queer part in their lives.\n\n\"When he came back among his own people,\" went on Mr. Henderson, \"they\nwould not receive him at first, believing him to be an impostor. But\nHankos convinced them of his identity and was allowed to don the\ngolden armor, which is the badge of kingship. He had only been in\noffice for a little while when he heard of the arrival of the strange\nthing, which turned out to be our ship. He recognized it from the\ndescription, and, learning that we were likely to be sacrificed to the\nfury and ignorance of the giants, he hurried here and saved our lives.\n\n\"He says he can never thank us enough for being the means whereby he\nwas able to get back to his own country, and says the freedom of this\nwhole inner world is ours. He has given orders that we are to go\nwherever we like, and none will molest us. He tells me the land is a\nwonderful one, compared to our own, and urges us to make a long\njourney. He would like to go with us, only, now that he has resumed\nhis natural size, he can not get inside the ship.\"\n\n\"Hurrah for King Hankos!\" cried Jack and the others joined him in a\nhearty cheer.\n\nThe giant in the golden armor evidently understood the compliment\nwhich was paid him, for he waved his helmet in the air and responded\nwith a shout of welcome that made the ground tremble.\n\nHankos waited until the professor had translated all of the story to\nthe other travelers. Then the genial giant began to talk some more,\nand the professor listened intently.\n\n\"He says,\" spoke Mr. Henderson to his friends, \"that we will be\nsupplied with all the fruit we want, and with the best of the houses\nto sleep in on our journey. He also tells me he has great stores of\nshining stones and piles of the metal of which his armor is made, and\nthat we are welcome to as much as we want. If this means unlimited\ngold and diamonds, we may make our fortunes.\"\n\n\"Jest let me git ma' hand on a few sparklers an' I'll quit work!\"\nexclaimed Washington.\n\n\"I have told him,\" the scientist went on, \"that we will take advantage\nof his kind offer. We will start on our trip in a day or so, after we\nhave looked over the ship to see if it is not damaged. He tells me the\ngold and sparkling stones are several thousand miles away, on top of a\nhigh mountain. We will make that our objective point.\"\n\nThe interview between the king and Mr. Henderson having ended, the\nformer waved his sword in the air and the swarm of big men came back.\nThey had been hiding back in the woods. Now their manner was very\ndifferent. They carefully removed the rollers and ropes, and soon\nthere was brought to the adventurers an immense pile of fine fruits.\nIf our friends had stayed there a year they could not have eaten it\nall. The giants were judging the appetites of the travelers by their\nown.\n\nThat night the adventurers slept more soundly than they had since\nentering the strange world. They felt they had nothing to fear from\nthe giants. In the morning they were not molested, though big crowds\ngathered to look at the ship. But they kept back a good distance. The\nmachinery was found to be in good shape, save for a few repairs, and\nwhen these were made, the professor announced he would start on a long\njourney.\n\nFor several weeks after that the travelers swung about in their ship,\nsometimes sailing in the air and again on big seas and lakes viewing\nthe wonders of the inner world. They were many and varied, and the\nprofessor collected enough material for a score of books which he said\nhe would write when he got back to the outer world once more.\n\nOne afternoon, as they were sailing over a vast stretch of woodland,\nwhich did not seem to be inhabited, Mr. Henderson, looking at one of\nthe gages on the wall, asked:\n\n\"Boys do you know how far you have traveled underground?\"\n\n\"How far?\" asked Jack, who hated to guess riddles.\n\n\"More than four thousand miles,\" was the answer.\n\n\"But we haven't come to that mountain of gold and diamonds,\" said\nMark. \"I am anxious to see that.\"\n\n\"Have patience,\" replied the professor. \"I have not steered toward it\nyet. There are other things to see.\"\n\nJust then Washington's voice could be heard calling from the conning\ntower:\n\n\"We're coming to a big mountain!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nTHE TEMPLE OF TREASURE\n\n\n\"WHAT'S that?\" fairly yelled the professor.\n\n\"We am propelling ourselves in a contiguous direction an' in close\nproximity to an elevated portion of th' earth's surface which rises in\nantiguous proximity t' th' forward part of our present means of\nlocomotion!\" said the colored man in a loud voice.\n\n\"Which means there may be a collision,\" the professor said, as he and\nthe boys hurried toward the tower.\n\n\"Jest what I said,\" retorted Washington. \"What'll I do?\"\n\n\"Send the ship a little higher,\" answered Mr. Henderson. \"We mustn't\nhit any mountains.\"\n\nWashington forced more gas into the holder, and speeded the negative\ngravity machine up some, so that the Mermaid, which was flying rather\nlow, ascended until it was in no danger of colliding with the peak\nwhich reared its lofty height just ahead of them.\n\nAs the ship sailed slowly over the mountain, Mark gazed down and\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Doesn't that look like the ruins of some building?\"\n\nThe professor took a pair of field glasses from a rack in the wall and\ntook a long view.\n\n\"It must be the place,\" he said in a low voice.\n\n\"What place?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"The temple of treasure,\" was the answer. \"Hankos told me it was on\ntop of the highest mountain in the land, and this must be it, for it\nis the loftiest place we have seen. But we must be careful, for there\nis danger down there.\"\n\n\"What kind?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"The place was long ago deserted by the giants,\" Mr. Henderson went\non. \"Ages ago it was one of their storehouses for treasure, but there\nwere wars among themselves, Hankos said, and this part of the country\nwas laid waste. Savage beasts took up their abode in the temple, and\nsince then, in spite of the great size of the giants, they have not\ndared to venture here. If we brave the animals we may have all the\ngold and diamonds we can take away.\"\n\n\"Then for one, I'm willin' t' go down an' begin th' extermination at\nonce,\" put in Andy. \"I've always wanted t' be rich.\"\n\n\"We must proceed cautiously,\" the professor said. \"We are ill prepared\nto fight any such beasts as we saw at the big geyser. At the same time\nthey may have deserted this place. I think we will lower the ship down\nover the temple, and spend several hours in observation. Then, if\nnothing develops, we can enter and see if the treasure is there.\"\n\nThis plan was voted a good one, and the Mermaid after having been\nsteered directly over the ruined temple, was brought to a halt, and\nenough gas let out so that it fell to about fifty feet in the air\nabove it.\n\nThe adventurers began their watch. The afternoon waned and there were\nno signs of any beasts in or about the temple.\n\n\"I reckon we can take a chance,\" said Andy, who was anxious to get his\nhands on some diamonds.\n\n\"Better wait until morning,\" counseled Mr. Henderson. \"It will soon be\ndark, and it doesn't look like a nice place to go stumbling about in\nby moonlight.\"\n\nSo, though all but the scientist were anxious, they had to wait until\nthe night had passed. Several times Washington got up to see if the\ntemple had, by any chance, taken wings during the long hours of\ndarkness, but each time he found it was still in place.\n\n\"Seems laik it'll never come mornin'.\" he said.\n\nBut dawn came at length, and, after a hasty breakfast, preparations to\nenter the temple were made. Andy loaded his gun for \"bear\" as he\nexpressed it, and the boys each took a revolver.\n\nThe ship was lowered to as level a place as could be found, and then,\nseeing that everything was in readiness for a quick departure, the\nprofessor led the way out of the Mermaid.\n\nThe entrance to the temple was through a big arched gateway. Some of\nthe stones had fallen down, and the whole structure looked as if it\nmight topple over at any moment.\n\n\"Go carefully,\" cautioned Mr. Henderson, \"Watch on all sides and up\nabove. Better let Andy and me go ahead.\"\n\nThe scientist and the old hunter led the way. Through the arch they\nwent, and emerged into what must at one time have been a magnificent\ncourtyard. Before them was the temple proper, a vast structure, with\nan opening through which fifty men might have marched abreast. But the\ndoors were gone, and the portal was but a black hole.\n\n\"I hope there ain't any ghosts in there,\" said Washington, with a\nshiver.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed the professor. \"There may be things as bad, but\nthere are no such things as ghosts. Have your gun ready, Andy.\"\n\nWith every sense on the alert, the old hunter advanced. Every one was\na bit nervous, and, as Mark and Jack afterward admitted, they half\nexpected some terrible beast to rush out at them. But nothing of the\nkind happened, and they went into the interior of the temple.\n\nAt first it was so dark they could see nothing. There were vast dim\nshapes on every side, and from the hollow echo of their footsteps they\njudged the roof must be very high and the structure big in every way.\n\nThen, as their eyes became used to the darkness, they could make out,\nup front, something like an altar or pulpit.\n\n\"Perhaps that's where they offered up the gold and diamonds as a\nsacrifice to their gods,\" spoke Mark in a whisper.\n\n\"Sacrifice to their gods!\" came back a hundred echoes and the sound\nmade every one shudder.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Washington, in a low voice.\n\n\"Oh! Oh! Oh!\" repeated the echoes in voices of thunder.\n\n\"Well, this is pleasant,\" spoke Andy, in his natural tones, and, to\nthe surprise of all there was no echo. It was only when a person\nwhispered or spoke low that the sound was heard. After that they\ntalked naturally.\n\n\"You stay here, and Andy and I will go up front and see what there\nis,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"Be on your guard, and if you hear us coming\nback in a hurry, run!\"\n\nIt was with no little feeling of nervousness that the boys, Bill, Tom\nand Washington watched the two men move off in the darkness. They\ncould hear their footsteps on the stone flags and could dimly see\nthem.\n\n\"They must be almost to the altar by this time,\" said Mark, after a\nlong pause.\n\nHardly had he spoken than there came a loud, sound from where Mr.\nHenderson and Andy had gone. It was as if some giant wings were\nbeating the air. Then came shrill cries and the voice of the old\nhunter could be heard calling:\n\n\"Kneel down, Professor! Let me get a shot at the brute!\"\n\nThose waiting in the rear of the temple huddled closer together. What\nterrible beast could have been aroused?\n\nThe next instant the place seemed illuminated as if by a lightning\nflash, and a sound as of a thousand thunder claps resounded.\n\n\"I think I winged him!\" cried Andy's voice, and the boys knew he had\nfired at something.\n\nThen there came a crash, and from the roof of the old temple a dozen\nstones toppled off to one side, letting in a flood of colored light.\n\nBy this illumination could be seen, flapping through the big space\noverhead, an enormous bat, as large as three eagles. And, as it flew\nabout in a circle it gave utterance to shrill cries.\n\n\"Bang!\" Andy's gun spoke again, and the bat with a louder cry than\nbefore, darted through the hole in the roof made by the falling\nstones, which had been loosened by the concussion from the rifle.\n\n\"Come on!\" cried the old hunter. \"That was the guardian of the\ntreasure! We are safe now!\"\n\nThen, in the light which streamed through the broken roof, the\nadventurers could see, heaped up on a great altar, behind which sat a\nhorrible graven image, piles of yellow metal, and sparkling stones. In\nlittle heaps they were, arranged as if offerings to the terrible god\nof the giants. There were bars and rings of gold, dishes of odd shape,\nand even weapons. As for the sparkling stones, they were of many\ncolors, but the white ones were more plentiful than all the others.\n\n\"Gold and diamonds! Diamonds and gold!\" murmured the professor. \"There\nis the ransom of many kings in this ancient temple.\"\n\n\"Wish I had a big bag!\" exclaimed Washington, as he began filling all\nhis pockets with the precious metal and gems. \"If I had a-thought I'd\nhave brought a dress-suit case!\"\n\n\"A dress-suit case full of diamonds!\" exclaimed Mark.\n\nThen he too, as did all the others, fell to filling his pockets with\nthe wealth spread so lavishly before them. There was the riches of a\nwhole world in one place and no one but themselves to take it.\n\nFor several minutes no one spoke. The only sound was the rattle of the\nstones and the clink of gold, and when some of the diamonds dropped on\nthe floor they did not bother to gather them up. There were too many\non the altar.\n\n\"We will be rich for life!\" gasped old Andy, who had been poor all his\nyears.\n\n\"I can't carry any more!\" gasped Washington. \"I'm goin' back for----\"\n\nWhat he was going back for he never said, for, at that instant,\nhappening to look up at the hole in the roof, he gave a startled try:\n\n\"Here come the terrible bats!\"\n\nThey all gazed upward. Through the opening they could see a great\nflock of the awful birds, headed for the temple, and they were led by\none which seemed to fly with difficulty. It was the guardian of the\ntreasure that Andy had wounded.\n\n\"Quick! We must get out of here!\" shouted the old hunter. \"They are\nbig enough and strong enough to tear us all to pieces. Hurry!\"\n\nDown the centre of the temple they rushed, and not a moment too soon,\nfor, ere they had passed half way to the entrance, the opening in the\nroof was darkened by the coming of the bats, and soon the flapping of\ntheir wings awoke the thundering echoes in the ruined structure, while\ntheir shrill cries struck terror to the hearts of the travelers.\n\nUp to the altar circled the bats, and then wheeling they flapped down\nthe dim aisles toward the adventurers.\n\n\"Hurry! Hurry!\" shouted Andy, who was in the rear.\n\nHe raised his rifle and fired several shots into the midst of the\nterrible creatures.\n\nA number of the bats were wounded, and the others were so frightened\nby the sound of the shots and the flashes of fire that they turned\nback. This enabled the fleeing ones to gain the entrance to the\ntemple, and soon they were outside.\n\n\"To the ship!\" yelled Bill.\n\n\"There's little danger now!\" called Andy, panting, for the run had\nwinded him. \"They will hardly attack us in the light!\"\n\nAnd he was right, for, though they could hear the bats flying about\ninside the temple, and uttering their cries, none came outside.\n\nBut no one felt like staying near the uncanny structure, and little\ntime was lost in reaching the Mermaid. Then the doors were fastened,\nand the ship was sent high up into the air.\n\n\"Which way?\" asked Jack, when Mr. Henderson told him to go to the\nconning tower and steer.\n\n\"Back to where we first met the giants,\" replied the professor. \"We\nmust prepare to start for our own earth again soon.\"\n\n\"I've almost forgotten how real sunlight looks,\" thought Jack, as he\nheaded the ship around the other way. As he turned the levers a big\ndiamond dropped from his pocket and rolled on the floor.\n\n\"This will be a good reminder of our trip though,\" he added.\n\nThe travelers, even including Mr. Henderson, were so taken up with\ntheir suddenly acquired riches that they hardly thought of meals. At\nthe professor's suggestion they tied their gold and stones up in small\npackages convenient to carry.\n\n\"Better place them where you can grab them in a hurry in case of\naccident,\" the old scientist went on. \"Of course if there should be\ntoo bad an accident they would never be of any use to us down here,\nbut we'll look on the bright side of things.\"\n\n\"Do you anticipate any accident?\" asked Jack anxiously.\n\n\"No, Oh no,\" replied Mr. Henderson, but Jack thought the aged man had\nsomething weighing on his mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nBACK HOME--CONCLUSION\n\n\nON and on sped the Mermaid. Now that the travelers felt their journey\naccomplished they were anxious to begin the homeward trip. They made a\nstraight course for the village where they had so nearly met with\ndisaster, and where the king of the giants had saved them. They went\nin a direct line, and did not travel here and there, as they had after\nthey left the town. Consequently they shortened the route by a great\ndistance. Yet it was long enough, and when they finally came in sight\nof the place the dial registered a trip of five thousand miles\nunderground.\n\nIt was one evening when they landed almost at the spot whence they had\ntaken flight eventually to reach the temple of the treasure. Most of\nthe giants had betaken themselves to their mound houses, but Hankos\nwas walking in the fields, and, when he caught sight of the airship\nhovering above him he waved his great sword in welcome.\n\nHe rushed up to shake hands with the travelers when they came out of\nthe ship, though to greet him it was only possible for the adventurers\nto grasp one of his immense fingers.\n\nAs soon as the greetings were over Hankos began to speak rapidly to\nthe professor, at the same time going through many strange motions.\n\n\"It is as I feared!\" suddenly exclaimed the scientist.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"The worst has happened!\" went on Mr. Henderson. \"The great hole by\nwhich we came into this place has been closed by an earthquake shock!\"\n\n\"The hole closed?\" repeated Jack.\n\n\"An earthquake shock!\" murmured Mark.\n\n\"Then how are we going to get back to earth?\" asked old Andy.\n\nA terrible fear entered the hearts of the travelers. The closing of\nthe opening by which they had come to the strange world meant, in all\nprobability that they would have to spend the rest of their lives in\nthis underground place.\n\n\"What good did it do us to get all those diamonds and that gold?\"\nasked Mark in a sorrowful tone.\n\nHankos began to speak again, using his gestures which were almost as\neloquent as words. The professor watched and listened intently. Then\nthere seemed to come a more hopeful look to his face. He nodded\nvigorously as Hankos went on with what seemed to be an explanation.\n\n\"It's worth trying, at all events!\" the scientist exclaimed. \"It is\nour only hope!\"\n\n\"What is?\" asked Jack.\n\n\"Friends,\" began the professor in solemn tones. \"I must admit our\nplight is desperate. At the same time there is a bare chance of our\ngetting back to our own earth. As you remember, Hankos went from this\nplace to the upper regions through the upward spouting column of\nwater.\"\n\n\"If we had our submarine we might also,\" interrupted Jack. \"But the\nMermaid isn't built to sail in that fashion.\"\n\n\"Nor would the Porpoise have served us in this emergency,\" said the\nprofessor. \"It would prove too heavy. But, nevertheless, I think I\nhave a plan. Now, Mark, you are about to learn the secret of the\nstoreroom. The real one, not the hiding of Hankos in there, which you\nimagined to be the cause of my desire to keep something hidden. When\nwe planned a trip to this underground world I had a dim idea that we\nmight meet with trouble. So I planned and made a cylinder lifeboat.\"\n\n\"A cylinder lifeboat?\" repeated Mark.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Henderson. \"I have it in the storeroom. I did not\nwant any of you to see it for fear you would have faint hearts. I\nthought there might be no necessity of using it. But, since there is,\nwe must do our best. I will admit it may be a fearful ordeal, but we\nwill have to risk something in order to escape.\n\n\"I have in the storeroom a large cylinder, capable of holding us all.\nIt will also contain food and drink for a month, but we will all have\nto go, packed almost like sardines in a box. My plan is to take the\nMermaid to the place where the column of water shoots up. There we\nwill get into the cylinder, close it, and trust ourselves to the\nterrible force that may bring us back to the upper world. What do you\nsay? Shall we attempt it?\"\n\nFor a few seconds no one spoke. Then Jack said slowly:\n\n\"I don't see that we can do anything else. I don't want to stay here\nall my life.\"\n\n\"I wants a chance t' wear some of them sparklers,\" put in Washington.\n\n\"Then we will make the attempt,\" the professor added. \"Now all aboard\nfor the place where the water shoots up!\"\n\nQuestioning Hankos, the professor learned how to reach the strange\nplace. It was in the midst of a desolate country where none of the\ngiants ever went, so afraid were they of the strange phenomenon.\n\nIt was a week's journey. Sometimes the Mermaid flew through the air,\nand again it sailed on vast lakes or inland seas. On the trip they met\nwith big waterfalls and terrible geysers that spouted a mile or more\ninto the air. They traveled by night as well as day, though it was\nnecessary to keep a sharp watch.\n\nSometimes the ship passed through great flocks of birds that\nsurrounded her and sought to pierce the aluminum hull with their sharp\nbeaks and talons. Over the mountains and valleys the ship sailed\nuntil, one evening, there sounded through the air a strange rumbling\nsound.\n\n\"It is thunder,\" said Old Andy.\n\n\"It is the water column,\" replied the scientist. \"We are at the end of\nour trip. May the remainder be as successful!\"\n\nThe ship was lowered to the surface, as it was deemed best to approach\nthe column when the lights were shining. No one slept much that night,\nfor the roaring and rumbling never ceased.\n\nIn the morning the ship was sent forward slowly. Ever and ever the\nterrific sound increased, until it was almost deafening. They had to\ncall to each other to be heard.\n\nThen, as the Mermaid passed over a mountain, the adventurers saw, in a\nvalley below them, the up-shooting water.\n\nIt was a vast column, nearly three hundred feet in thickness, and as\nsolid and white as a shaft of marble. Up, up, up, it went, until it\nwas lost to sight, but there were no falling drops, and not even a\nspray came from the watery shafts.\n\n\"There is a terrible power to it,\" the professor said. \"May it prove\nour salvation!\"\n\nThe ship was lowered about a hundred feet away from the waterspout.\nAll around them the ground was vibrating with the force of the fluid.\n\n\"To think that connects with the world above!\" exclaimed Jack.\n\n\"It's a good thing for us that it does,\" Mark answered.\n\n\"We must lose no time,\" the professor put in. \"If the earthquake\ndestroyed the downward shaft, it may effect this one in time. We must\nescape while we can.\"\n\nThen, for the first time, he opened the storeroom and the big cylinder\nwas disclosed to view. It was made of aluminum, and shaped like an\nimmense cigar. The hull was double, and it was strongly braced. Inside\nwere padded berths for the occupants, and there was just room enough\nfor the seven adventurers. Once they had entered they could not move\nabout, but must stay in their little compartment.\n\nCompressed air in strong cylinders furnished a means of breathing, and\nthere were tiny electric lights operated by a storage battery. There\nwas also a chamber to be filled with the lifting gas. The cylinder was\nso arranged that it would float on it's long axis if thrown into the\nwater. A trap door hermetically sealed gave access to the interior. A\nsmall propeller, worked by compressed air, furnished motive power.\n\nThe food supply consisted of compressed capsules on which a man could\nsubsist for several days. There was also some water, but not much,\nsince that can not be compressed and would, therefore, take\nconsiderable room.\n\n\"The only thing for us to do,\" said the professor, \"is to get into the\ncylinder, seal it up, and trust to Providence. This is what I intended\nto use when we were caught in the draught.\"\n\n\"How can we get into the column of water after we shut ourselves into\nthe cylinder?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"The cylinder fits into a sort of improvised cannon,\" said Mr.\nHenderson. \"It is fired by electricity and compressed air. We will\naim it at the column, press the button and be projected into the midst\nof the water. Then----\" He did not finish the sentence, but the others\nknew what he meant.\n\n\"When are we to start?\" asked Mark.\n\n\"As soon as possible,\" replied the professor. \"I must arrange the\ncylinder, compress the air and lay out the food supply.\"\n\nIt took the rest of the day to do this, as the inventor found it would\nbe advisable to attach a weight to the end of the cylinder, to hold it\nupright in the column of water. The weight could be detached\nautomatically when they were shot up into the midst of the ocean,\nwhere, as Hankos had told them, the column spurted forth.\n\nThen some food was stored in the tiny ship that was destined to be\ntheir last hope, and some tanks of water were placed in it.\n\n\"I think we are almost ready,\" Mr. Henderson said about noon the next\nday.\n\n\"What about our gold and diamonds?\" asked Jack suddenly. \"Can we take\nthem with us in the cylinder?\"\n\n\"That's so!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson. \"I forgot about them. I'm afraid\nwe'll have to leave the riches behind. We will not be able to carry\nthem and the food we need, for it may be a week or more before we can\nleave the cylinder. Gold and diamonds will be a poor substitute for\nsomething to eat.\"\n\n\"I'm goin' t' take mine!\" said Washington with much conviction. \"I\nmight as well starve rich as starve poor!\"\n\n\"We may be able to take a few diamonds,\" the professor answered. \"The\ngold will be too heavy. Let each one select the largest of the\ndiamonds he has and put them in his pockets.\"\n\nThen began a sorting of the wealth. It was strange, as they recalled\nafterward, throwing away riches that would have made millionaires\nenvious, but it had to be done. All the wealth in the world would not\nequal a beef capsule when they were starving, and they realized it. So\nthey only saved a few pieces of gold as souvenirs, and took the best\nof the diamonds. But even then they had a vast fortune with them.\n\nAt last all was in readiness. The cylinder had been placed in the tube\nfrom which it was to be shot gently forth by compressed air, so that\nit would fall into the upward spouting column of water. The charge of\ncompressed air was put in and the electric wires arranged.\n\n\"Are we all ready?\" asked Mr. Henderson.\n\n\"I think so,\" said Jack, in what sounded like a whisper, but which was\nloud, only the noise of the water muffled it.\n\n\"Then we had better enter the cylinder,\" spoke the inventor. \"Take a\nlast look at the Flying Mermaid, boys, for you will never see again\nthe ship that has borne us many thousand miles. She served us well,\nand might again, but for the freak of nature that has placed us in\nthis position.\"\n\nFor the first time the adventurers realized that they must abandon the\ncraft in which they had reached the new world. So it was with no\nlittle feeling of sadness that they climbed up the ladder that had\nbeen arranged and slid down into the cylinder. One by one they took\ntheir places in the padded berths arranged for them. It was a snug\nfit, for the professor knew if there was too much room he and the\nothers might be so tossed about as to be killed.\n\nMr. Henderson was the last to enter. Standing at the manhole he took a\nfinal look at his pet creation, the Mermaid. Through the opened\nwindows the colored lights came, shifting here and there. Outside the\nterrible column of water was roaring as if anxious to devour them.\n\n\"Good-bye, Mermaid!\" said the professor softly.\n\nThen he closed down the manhole cover and tightened the screws that\nheld it in place. He touched a button that turned on the electric\nlights and the interior of the cylinder was illuminated with a soft\nglow.\n\n\"Are you all ready?\" he asked.\n\n\"Jest as much as I ever will be,\" replied Washington, who, as the\ncrisis approached, seemed more light-hearted than any of the others.\n\n\"Then here we go!\" exclaimed Mr. Henderson.\n\nHis fingers touched the button that connected with the electric\nmachine, which operated the compressed air.\n\nThere sounded a muffled report. Then it seemed to those in the\ncylinder that the end of the world had come. They shot upward and\noutward, through the top of the conning tower which had been removed.\nThe cylinder, launched straight at the column of water struck it\nsquarely and, an instant later was caught in the grasp of the giant\nforce and hurled toward the upper world.\n\nUp and up and up the mass of metal with its human freight went. Now it\nwas spinning like a top, again it shot toward the earth's crust like\nan arrow from the archer's bow.\n\nIt was moving with the velocity of a meteor, yet because of being\nsurrounded with water, and traveling with the same velocity as the\ncolumn, there was no friction. Had there been, the heat generated\nwould have melted the case in an instant.\n\nFor the first few seconds those in the cylinder were dazed by the\nsudden rush. Then as it became greater and greater there came a\ncurious dull feeling, and, one after another lost consciousness. The\nterror of the water column, and the frightful speed, had made them\nsenseless.\n\n                               --------\n\nIt seemed like a month later, though, of course, it could have been\nonly a few hours or a day at most when Jack opened his eyes. He saw\nhis companions, white and senseless all around him, and at first\nthought they were dead. Then he saw Mark looking at him, and\nWashington asked:\n\n\"Is any one livin' 'sides me?\"\n\n\"I am,\" replied Jack decidedly.\n\nThen, one after another they regained their senses. But they were in a\nstrange daze, for they were being carried along like a shooting star,\nonly, as they went at the same rate as did the element carrying them,\nthey did not realize this.\n\n\"I think I'm hungry,\" said Bill, who had the best appetite of any of\nthe travelers.\n\n\"You'll find a beef capsule in the little compartment over your head,\"\nspoke the professor.\n\nBill was about to reach for it, when they were all startled by a\nsudden side motion of the cylinder. Then came a violent shock, and a\nsound as of splashing water. Next the cylinder seemed to be falling,\nand, a few minutes later to be shooting upward. Following this there\nwas another splash and the cylinder began to bob about like a cork on\na mill pond.\n\n\"We have reached the sea! We are afloat on the ocean!\" cried the\nprofessor.\n\nHurriedly he disengaged himself from the straps that held him to his\nbunk. He pushed back the lever that opened the manhole. Into the\nopening glowed the glorious sunlight, while to the occupants came the\nbreath of salt air.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" cried Jack. \"We are safe at last!\"\n\n\"Safe at last!\" the professor answered, and then they all gave a\ncheer.\n\nFor their cylinder, which might now be termed a boat, was floating on\nthe great Atlantic. The blue sky was overhead and the air of the sea\nfanned their cheeks.\n\nThey had shot up from the underground earth, in the column of water,\nhad been tossed high into the air, had fallen back when the liquid\nshaft broke into spray, had descended into the ocean, gone down a\nhundred feet or more, and then had shot up like a cork to bob about\nthe surface.\n\nFor a week they were afloat, and then they were picked up by a passing\nvessel, rather weak and very much cramped, but otherwise in good\nshape. They said nothing of their adventures, save to explain that\nthey were experimenting in a new kind of boat. About a month later,\nfor the ship that had rescued them was a slow sailer, they were back\non the island whence that wonderful voyage was begun.\n\n                               --------\n\n\"Well, we solved the mystery of the center of the earth,\" remarked\nJack, one evening, when they were gathered in the old shack where so\nmany wonderful adventures had been planned.\n\n\"Yes, we did,\" said Mr. Henderson. \"And no one else is ever likely to\ngo there.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because the only way of getting there was destroyed by the\nearthquake, and no one could ever force his way down through that\nupward-shooting column of water.\"\n\n\"That's so. Well, we have the diamonds, anyway,\" spoke Mark. \"They\nought to make us rich.\"\n\nAnd the jewels did, for the stones proved to be of great value, even\nthough the adventurers had saved only a few of the many they found in\nthe ruined temple.\n\nBut there was money enough so that they all could live in comfort; the\nrest of their lives. As the professor was getting quite old, and\nincapable of making any more wonderful inventions, he closed up his\nworkshop and settled down to a quiet life. As for Washington, Andy,\nand Bill and Tom, they invested their money received from the sale of\nthe diamonds in different business ventures, and each one did well.\n\n\"I am going in for a good education,\" said Jack to Mark.\n\n\"Just what I am going to do,\" answered his chum. \"And after we've got\nthat----\" He paused suggestively.\n\n\"We'll go in for inventing airships, or something like that, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes. We've learned a great deal from Mr. Henderson, and in the course\nof time we ought to be able to turn out something even more wonderful\nthan the Electric Monarch, the Porpoise, or the Flying Mermaid.\"\n\n\"Yes, and when we've invented something better----\"\n\n\"We'll take another trip.\"\n\n\"Right you are!\"\n\nAnd then the two chums shook hands warmly; and here we will say\ngood-bye.\n\n\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Five Thousand Miles Underground, by Roy Rockwood\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FIVE THOUSAND MILES UNDERGROUND ***\n\n***** This file should be named 4994.txt or 4994.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/4/9/9/4994/\n\nProduced by Jim Weiler\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
