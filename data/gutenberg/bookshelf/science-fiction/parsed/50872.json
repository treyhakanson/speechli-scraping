SMITH\n\n                      Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS\n\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\n                   Galaxy Science Fiction May 1953.\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\n\n\n\n            Trading with the natives was like taking candy\n                from a kid--but which were the natives?\n\n\nPpon lowered himself hastily to the orlop and ran toward me. \"Hurry\nup, Qan!\" he projected on a sub-level, trying to escape my mother's\nconsciousness. \"They're coming! All the others are up already.\"\n\n\"Who's coming?\" my mother wanted to know, but her full interest was\nabsorbed by her work, and she gave us only the side of her mind. \"You\nyoungsters really must learn to think clearly.\"\n\n\"Yes'm.\" Ppon projected suitable youthful embarrassment, but on a lower\nlevel he was giggling. Later I must give him another warning; we young\nones could not yet separate the thought channels efficiently, so it was\nmore expedient not to try.\n\n\"The _zkuchi_ are coming,\" I lied glibly, knowing that the old ones\naccept inanity as merely a sign of immaturity, \"on hundreds of golden\nwings that beat faster than light.\"\n\nGrandfather removed a part of his mind from his beloved work. \"The\n_zkuchi_ are purely mythological creatures,\" he thought crossly.\n\"You're old enough to know better than that.... Qana,\" he appealed to\nmy mother, \"why do you let him believe in such nonsense?\"\n\n\"The _zkuchi_ are part of our cultural heritage, Father,\" she\nprojected gently. \"We must not let the young ones forget our heritage.\nParticularly if we are to be here for some time.\"\n\n\"It seems to me you're unnecessarily pessimistic,\" he complained. \"You\nknow I've never failed you yet. We shall get back, I promise you. It's\njust that the transmutation takes time.\"\n\n\"But it's taken such a long time already,\" she thought sadly.\n\"Sometimes I begin to have doubts.\" Then she apparently remembered that\nserious matters should not be discussed before us young ones. As if\nwe didn't know what was going on. \"Run along and play, children,\" she\nadvised, \"but don't forget to check the atmosphere first.\"\n\nGrandfather started to excogitate something about how it would be\nbetter if Ppon went and helped his father while I stayed and did\nmy lessons--you never seem to escape from lessons anywhere in the\nUniverse--but we got away before he could finish.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTopside, the others were jumping up and down in their excitement.\nZtul, the half-wit, was so upset he actually _spoke_: \"Hurry, Qan, the\ntourists are coming!\"\n\n\"Ztul, you must never, _never_ make words aloud!\" I thought fiercely.\n\"The old ones might hear and find out about the game.\"\n\n\"It's a harmless game,\" Ppon contributed. \"And useful, too. Your\ngrandfather needs the stuff.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I agreed, \"but perhaps the old ones wouldn't see it that way.\nThey might even stop the game. Adults have funny ideas, and there's no\nuse asking for trouble.\"\n\nThere was a chorus of assenting thought from the others. All of us had\nour family troubles.\n\nWe got to work. Quickly we arranged the interiors of the shelters which\nwe had cleverly built out of materials borrowed from below when the old\nones' perceptions were directed elsewhere. The essential structure\nof the materials had not been changed and could easily be replaced\nwhen the time came, but there was no use having to give involved\nexplanations. The old ones never seemed to understand anything.\n\nAt first we had just built the shelters as play huts, but when the\nfirst tourists had misunderstood, we had improved upon the original\nmisconception. Now we had a regular street full of rude dwellings.\nLucky for us the old ones never came topside.\n\nAs the little spaceship landed, Ppon and I and four of the others were\nready at its door to form a welcoming committee. The rest dispersed to\nplay villagers. The others took turns alternating the two roles, but I,\nof course, was always leader. After all, I'd made up the game.\n\nTwo members of the crew dropped lightly out of the ship and slid a ramp\ninto place. Then the passengers--there was a sizable group this time, I\nnoted with satisfaction--came, followed by Sam, the guide, a grizzled\nold human. He grinned at us. We were old friends, for he'd been leading\nthese tours for ten of their Earth years.\n\nThe passengers stopped at the foot of the ramp and Sam ran forward\nto face them. By now we were used to the appearance of the human\nbeings--small, binocular, with smooth, pasty skins--although they had\nreally frightened us when we first laid eyes on them.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Now, you see, folks,\" Sam bellowed through his megaphone, \"the\nscientists don't know everything. They said life could not exist out\nhere in the Asteroid Belt--and, behold, life! They said these little\nplanets were too small, had too little gravity to hold an atmosphere.\nBut you just breathe in that air, as pure and fresh and clean as the\natmosphere of our own Earth! Speaking of gravity, you'll notice that\nwe're walking, not floating. Matter of fact, you'll notice it's even a\nlittle hard to walk; you seem a bit heavier than at home. And they said\nthere would be hardly any gravity. No, folks, those scientists know a\nlot of things, I won't deny that, but they sure don't know everything.\"\n\n\"Amazing!\" a small, bespectacled male passenger said. \"I can hardly\nbelieve my own senses!\"\n\n\"Watch out for him,\" Ppon projected to me. \"I think he's a scientist of\nsome kind.\"\n\n\"Don't teach your ancestor to levitate,\" I conceptualized back.\n\nOf course what struck the passengers first was neither the atmosphere\nnor the gravity; it was us. They never failed to be surprised,\nalthough the travel folders should have shown them what to expect.\nOne of the folders had a picture of me, amusingly crude and\ntwo-dimensional, it's true, but not entirely unflattering. I'm not\nreally purple, just a sort of tender fuchsia, but what could you expect\nfrom the rudimentary color processes they used? Sam had let me have the\noriginal and I always wished I could show it to Mother, but I couldn't\nwithout having to explain where it had come from.\n\n\"They're so cute!\" a thin female screamed. \"Almost like big squirrels,\nreally, except for all those arms.\" Her teeth protruded more than those\nof the small rodent she was thinking about, or than mine, for that\nmatter.\n\n\"Be careful, ma'am,\" the guide warned her. \"They speak English.\"\n\n\"They do? How clever of them. Why, they must be quite intelligent,\nthen.\"\n\n\"They are of a pretty high order of intelligence,\" the guide agreed,\n\"although their methods of reasoning have always baffled scientists.\nSomehow they seem to _sense_ scientists, think of them as their\nenemies, and just clam up entirely.\"\n\n\"I think they're just simply too cute,\" she said, gazing at me fondly.\n\n\"Ah, _srrk_ yourself, madam,\" I excogitated, confident that humans\nwere non-telepathic.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe looked a little disturbed, though; I'd better watch myself. After\nall, as leader I had to set a good example.\n\n\"This here is Qan,\" the guide introduced me. \"Headman or chief or\nsomething of the tribe. He is always on hand to greet us.\"\n\n\"Welcome, travelers from a distant star,\" I intoned, wrapping my\nmother's second-best cloak more impressively about me, \"to the humble\nland of the _Gchi_. Come in peace, go in peace.\"\n\n\"Why, he speaks excellent English,\" the scientist exclaimed.\n\n\"They pick up things very fast,\" Sam explained.\n\n\"Natives can be very, very shrewd,\" a stout female commented, clutching\nher handbag tightly.\n\n\"And now,\" Sam said, \"we will visit the rude dwellings of this simple,\nprimitive, but hospitable people.\"\n\n\"_People!_\" Ppon projected. \"You better mind your language, Buster!\nPeople, indeed!\"\n\n\"Our friend Qan will lead the way.\" Sam waved toward me.\n\nI smiled back at him, but didn't move.\n\n\"Whatsa matter?\" he hissed. \"Don't you trust me? Your old pal Sam?\"\n\n\"No,\" I whispered back. \"Last time I let you pay me at the end of the\ntour, the take was $3.75 short.\"\n\nHe tried another tack. \"But look, Qan, it's a hell of a job getting all\nthose coins together. Why can't you take paper money instead?\"\n\n\"What good would paper money do me up here?\"\n\n\"What I can't figure out is what good the metal does you up here,\neither.\"\n\nI beamed. \"We eat it.\"\n\nMuttering to himself, he walked over to the ship and called one of the\ncrewmen. They dragged a bag out of the ship's hold. Puffing, they laid\nit at my feet. I tossed it to Ztul.\n\n\"Count it,\" I ordered out loud, \"and if there's any missing, no one\nleaves this planet alive.\" I snarled ferociously.\n\nEverybody laughed. It was part of the act.\n\n\"You will notice,\" Sam announced as we led the way down the street,\n\"that the _Gchi_ are all about the same size. No young ones among them.\nWe don't know whether this is because they reproduce differently from\nus, or because they have concealed their offspring.\"\n\n\"The children must be dear little creatures,\" the toothy female gushed.\n\"If even the adults are cute when they're seven or eight feet tall,\nthe little ones must be simply precious.... Tell me, Chief, do you have\nany children?\"\n\n\"Don't understand,\" I grunted. \"Concept unfamiliar. Not know what\nchildren is.\"\n\n\"Funny,\" remarked the scientist, \"he was speaking perfectly good\nEnglish before.\"\n\n\"Watch yourself, kid,\" Ppon ideated warningly to me.\n\n\"Children are ...\" she began and stopped. \"They're--well, how do you\nreproduce?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPpon, the _oosh_-head, took it upon himself to answer. \"If you'll just\nstep into my hut, madam, I'll be delighted to show you.\"\n\n\"If you ask me,\" the scientist stated, \"these are frauds.\"\n\n\"Whaddya mean frauds?\" Sam demanded indignantly.\n\n\"Human beings dressed up as extraterrestrials. They speak too good an\nEnglish. Their concepts are too much like ours. Their sense of humor is\nequally vul--too similar.\"\n\n\"You and your big mouth!\" I projected to Ppon.\n\n\"Look who's thinking!\" he excogitated back. I could see I'd have to\ngive him a mind-lashing later.\n\nIt was up to me to save the situation. \"If you would like to examine me\nmore closely, sir,\" I addressed the scientist, \"you will see that I\nam not a human being.\"\n\nHe approached me dubiously.\n\n\"Closer,\" I said, looking him in the eye, as I bared my teeth and\ngrowled. \"I have five eyes, sir, and you will notice that I am looking\nat you with each one of them. I have seven arms, sir--\" here I reached\nout to grab him \"--and you will notice that they are all living tissue.\"\n\n\"No, you couldn't be a human being,\" he agreed, backing away as soon as\nI released my grip, \"but the whole thing is ... odd. Very odd.\"\n\n\"If anthropologists on Earth can't explain all the customs of the\nprimitives there,\" Sam tried to placate him, \"how can we explain the\nbehavior of extraterrestrials? Let's go into some of the houses. The\nchief has kindly given us his permission to look around.\"\n\n\"Our houses are your houses,\" I stated, bowing graciously.\n\nAs always, the tourists grew extremely enthusiastic about the\nfurniture in our simple dwellings. \"What lovely--er--things you have,\"\nsquirrel-tooth commented. \"What are they used for?\"\n\n\"Well, the _pryu_ is for the _mrach_, of course,\" I explained glibly,\n\"and the _wrooov_ is much used for _cvrking_ the _budz_, although the\n_ywrl_ is preferred by the less discriminating.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"How I should love to have one of the--'_wroov_' I\nthink it was you said, for my very own. I wonder whether....\"\n\nBy a curious coincidence, Hsoj arrived at this point, carrying a tray\nfull of things and stuff.\n\n\"Artifacts!\" he shouted. \"Nice artifacts! Who wants to buy artifacts?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAll the tourists did. They were pretty good artifacts, if I do say\nso myself. I'd made them out of the junk I rescued from our dustbins\nbefore the disintegration unit got to work. Honestly, I can't\nunderstand how the old ones can complain about our being wasteful and\nthen go and throw away all sorts of perfectly useful things.\n\n\"You must pay the natives in metal,\" the guide explained. \"They accept\nonly coins.\"\n\n\"Why?\" the stout female wanted to know. \"Do they really eat metal?\"\n\n\"I doubt it. One of them ate a couple of pounds of Earth candy a\ntourist gave him last time and he seemed to enjoy it without ill\neffects.\"\n\n\"Without ill effects!\" Ppon excogitated. \"You should have seen Ztul\nafterward, boy!\"\n\n\"Look, Mac.\" A short fat human offered Hsoj a small silver coin and\nthen five larger brown ones. \"Which would you rather have?\"\n\n\"Them.\" Hsoj pointed unhesitatingly to the brown coins.\n\nA smile rippled covertly through the tourists.\n\n\"They're a simple and child-like people, but really so good-natured,\"\nSam footnoted.\n\nAll of us gave simple good-natured smiles as Hsoj accepted the gift of\nthe brown coins.\n\n\"Keep up the good work,\" I projected. \"We can use all the copper we can\nget.\"\n\n\"You like metal, dear?\" a female asked Hsoj. She unfastened a belt from\naround her waist. \"Would you take this in exchange for some of your\npretty things?\"\n\n\"Say 'yes,'\" I conceptualized. \"That's steel. Old and worthless to her,\nbut not to us.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" Hsoj ideated impatiently. \"What makes you think\nyou're the only one who knows anything?\"\n\nNever had we got such a big haul before, because everybody seemed to\nhave all sorts of metal stuff on him that he valued less than coins.\n\nNow came the sad part of the spiel. \"Remember, folks, these simple,\nhonest individuals you see before you are but the scanty remnants of a\nonce-proud race who spanned the skies. For their ancestors must have\nbeen godlike indeed to have erected such edifices as that commanding\nstructure over there.\" Sam pointed to the portable atmosphere machine\nwhich was set up several _yebil_ away to give our playground proper\nair. \"Once glorious, now fallen into ruin and decay.\"\n\n\"You're going to catch _muh_ from the old ones,\" Ppon ideated, \"when\nthey find out you haven't been keeping the machine clean.\"\n\n\"Don't be a silly _oosh_,\" I thought back with a mental grin. \"I'm\nusing the atmosphere machine to create atmosphere.\"\n\n\"You're getting to be as stupid as a human,\" he thought in disgust.\n\n\"May we go inside?\" the scientific passenger asked Sam.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" I said hastily. \"It is our temple, sacred to the gods. No\nunbeliever may set foot in it.\"\n\n\"What are the basic tenets of your religion?\" the scientist wanted to\nknow.\n\n\"We do not talk about it,\" I said with dignity. \"It is tabu. Bad form.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And now,\" announced the guide, glancing at his watch, \"we have just\ntime for the war dance before we leave for Vesta.\"\n\n\"Against whom are they planning a war?\" asked a small passenger,\nturning pale.\n\n\"It's a vestigial ritual,\" Sam explained quickly, \"dating back to the\ndays when there were other--er--when there was somebody to fight. Just\nan invocation to the gods ... general stuff like that ... nothing to be\nafraid of. Isn't it so, Qan?\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" I replied, folding all my arms across my mother's cloak.\n\"Come in peace, go in peace. Our motto.\"\n\nWe started the dance. It wouldn't have got us a passing mark in first\ngrade, where we'd learned it _rffi_ ago, but our version of the dance\nof the _zkuchi_ was plenty good enough for the tourists.\n\n\"If I ever visit Earth, _Janna_ forbid,\" I thought to Ppon as we\nexecuted an intricate caracole, \"I'm going to wear earplugs all the\ntime.\"\n\nThe dance finished.\n\n\"Now everybody get together!\" Sam shouted, clapping his hands to round\nup his charges. \"We are about to leave little _Gchik_.\"\n\n\"He should only know what _gchik_ means,\" Ppon sniggered mentally.\n\n\"Little _Gchik_ is barren, dying, its past glories all but forgotten,\"\nSam almost sobbed, \"but still its simple, warm-hearted inhabitants\ncarry on bravely....\"\n\n\"Couldn't we _do_ something for them?\" suggested the stout female.\n\nEverybody murmured assent. This contingency arose all too often--a\nresult of our being just too lovable.\n\n\"No one can help us,\" I said in a deep voice, pulling the cloak over\nmy face. The _idzik_ feathers trimming it tickled like crazy. \"We must\ndree our own weird alone. Besides, the air of _Gchik_ has a deleterious\neffect upon human beings if they're exposed to it for longer than four\nhours.\"\n\nThere was a mad scramble to reach the ship.\n\n\"Stand by the atmosphere machine, Hsoj,\" I instructed, \"to poison a\nlittle air in case anybody wants to take a sample.\"\n\nThe scientist actually did, in a little bottle he seemed to have\nbrought along for the purpose; but he got off the \"asteroid\" as rapidly\nas the rest of them, after that.\n\nWe watched the spaceship dwindle to a silver mote in the distance.\n\n\"Whew,\" Ppon thought, sinking to the surface. \"That war dance sure\ntakes a lot out of a fellow.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThen he conceptualized indignantly as he--as well as the rest of\nus--floated off the top level. \"Somebody's cut the gravity!\"\n\n\"Must be Grandfather,\" I mentalized. \"I suppose he thinks we've been\nout long enough, so he's warning us, just as if we were a bunch of\ninfants. I guess we'd better go inside, though. Let's not forget to\nturn off the atmosphere, fellows. It uses too much energy and the old\nones won't let us play topside any more.\"\n\n\"You know everything, don't you, Qan?\" Ppon sneered.\n\nI ignored him. \"Pretty good haul,\" I excogitated as I hefted the bags\nof metal. \"Here, Ztul, catch!\"\n\n\"You always make me carry everything!\" he complained.\n\nGrandfather caught us as we lowered ourselves from the airlock. I\nfigured he must have been getting suspicious or otherwise he'd never\nhave left his beloved engines.\n\n\"What's this you youngsters have?\" he wanted to know, pouncing on\nour bags. \"Metal, eh? I suppose you were going to make another fake\nmeteorite out of it for me, were you?\"\n\n\"I thought you wanted metal, Grandfather,\" I sulked. He could have been\nmore appreciative.\n\n\"Certainly I want metal. You know I need it to get the drive working\nagain. But what I want to know is where you got it from. I'd think you\nstole it, but how could even little _muhli_ like you steal out here in\nspace?\"\n\n\"They have always brought you metal from time to time, Father,\" Mother\nprojected, coming out as she overthought us. \"So clever of them, I\nalways thought.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I've been thinking that their encountering so many meteorites\nwas a singularly curious coincidence. And they were curious meteorites,\ntoo. I suppose the young ones made them themselves.\"\n\n\"But out of what, Father? You know we don't have any spare metal on\nthe ship. That's why you haven't been able to get the repairs finished\nbefore. Where else could they get the metal but from meteorites?\"\n\n\"I don't know where they get their metal from, but certainly not from\nmeteorites. These pieces here are artifacts. Look, the metal has been\nmore or less refined and roughly formed into shapes with crude designs\nupon them. Tell me the truth, Qan, where did you get these?\"\n\n\"Some people gave them to us,\" I replied sullenly.\n\n\"People?\" asked my mother. \"What are people?\"\n\n\"Natives of this solar system. They call themselves people.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" my grandfather interjected. \"It's just another one of your\nfantasies. You know what the astronomers say--none of the planets of\nthis little system is capable of supporting life.\"\n\n\"They come from the third planet,\" I persisted, trying to keep from\ndisgracing myself by _fllwng_ in front of the other young ones. \"There\nis life there. All of us have seen them. Besides, there is the metal.\"\n\nMy companions chorused agreement.\n\n\"You see, Father,\" my mother smiled, stroking my head with three hands,\n\"the wise ones are not always right.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nMy grandfather nodded his head slowly. \"It is not impossible, I\nsuppose. I hope it is true that these--people _gave_ you and your\nfriends the metal, Qan.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Grandfather,\" I thought anxiously. \"Of their own free will.\"\n\n\"Well--\" he continued, not altogether convinced--\"this lot should be\nenough to repair the engines. Perhaps, when we take off, we should have\na look at the youngsters' third planet on the way home.\"\n\n\"But this trip has taken such a long time already, Father,\" my mother\nprotested. \"Almost a _rff_; the young ones have missed nearly two\nsemesters of school. And Qan has been getting some very peculiar\nideas--from those _people_, I suppose.\"\n\n\"But if there is some sort of intelligent life,\" Grandfather thought,\n\"it's our duty to visit it. Next time we need to stop the ship for\nrepairs, it might be more convenient to put in at this third planet\ninstead of just hanging out there in space. And the young ones say the\nnatives seem to be friendly.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see Sam's face when he comes back and finds his 'asteroid'\ngone,\" I conceptualized.\n\n\"Yes,\" Ppon agreed, with the edge of his mind, but his main channel was\nturned in another direction. \"That is the end of this game now, you\nknow. In the next game _I_ shall be leader.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes?\" I thought back. \"I'm the leader and I'm staying leader,\nbecause I am the biggest and cleverest.\"\n\n\"Children!\" my mother protested, distressed. \"I'm afraid you've picked\nup some really unpleasant concepts from those dreadful natives.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Qana,\" Grandfather ideated, \"we mustn't be intolerant.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" she replied with heat, \"and I know the natives probably\ndon't know any better, but I am not going to have my young one or\nanyone else's contaminated. Visit the third planet if you wish, but not\nthis time. You'll have to make a special trip for it. I'm not going to\nlet you stop off there while the young ones are aboard. It's obviously\nno fit place for children.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Not Fit for Children, by Evelyn E.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
