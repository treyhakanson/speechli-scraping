What\n               I got was visitation rights with the most\n             exasperating pack of sleepwalkers in history.\n\n\nA fried egg came floating up through the stone steps of the Medical\nCenter and broke on my shoe. According to my watch, it was time for\nthe breakfast I didn't have that morning, so I waited a moment for the\nusual two rashers of bacon.\n\nWhen they materialized, I hopped aside to avoid them and went back into\nthe building, where the elevator took me straight up to the psychiatric\nfloor, without asking.\n\n\"Your blood pressure, salts, minerals, vitamins, basal metabolism,\nbrain pattern, nervous reflexes and skin temperature control are within\naccepted tolerances,\" it droned, opening the doors to let me off. \"You\nhave no clinical organic disorders; you weigh a hundred and fifty-two\npounds, Earth, measure six feet one inch, and have a clear pallid\ncomplexion and an egg on your shoe.\"\n\nI walked down the corridor to Dr. Doogle Spacio-Psycho Please Enter\nand went determinedly in.\n\n\"Name, please,\" said the blonde receptionist, tapping her nail eroder.\n\n\"Jones. Harry Jones.\"\n\n\"Mr. Harry K. Jones, the physicist?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she said, fiddling with the appointment list, \"Mr. Harry K.\nJones has just had his morning appointment and left.\"\n\n\"I know,\" I said. \"An important piece of clinical data has just turned\nup. I have returned with an egg on my shoe.\"\n\n\"I think you'd better see the doctor.\"\n\nI sat down to wait and took the little bottle of pills from my pocket.\n\"From the Galaxy to you, through Dr. Doogle, Spacio-Psycho,\" it said on\nthe label. \"The last word in tranquilizers. Conservative Zen methods\nonly, appointments any hour, first consultation free, no obligation,\ncall personal transmitter DDK 51212-6790, Earth. Active ingredients\noxylatohydrobenzoic-phe-ophenophino, sugar, coloring to 100%.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe inner office door opened and Dr. Doogle smiled fatly at me from\nbehind his expensive desk.\n\n\"Do come in,\" he called, \"and tell me all about it.\"\n\n\"It's happened again,\" I said, going into his office.\n\n\"Well, why not, if you feel that way? Nurse, bring me Mr. Hing-humph's\ncase history.\"\n\n\"Mr. Har-ry K. Jo-nes' film is in the transcriber, Doctor,\" said the\nreceptionist. \"Mr. Jones, the physicist.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, of course. Please sit down, Mr. Jones. Now what exactly is\nthe trouble? Hold nothing back, tell me all, reveal your intimate\nthoughts.\"\n\n\"The main entrance just served me the breakfast that your diet\nforbids,\" I said, sitting down.\n\n\"Plain case of wish fulfillment. Put it down to poltergeists, Mr.\nJones.\"\n\n\"And what exactly do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Well, now,\" Dr. Doogle said, drumming his fat fingers, \"I don't think\nwe need to go into technicalities, Mr. Jones.\"\n\n\"Look,\" I said firmly. \"I came to you to get a quiet night's sleep. No\nmore insomnia, you said, leave your problems in the laboratory, let not\nthe nucleii banish sleep, work hard, sleep hard, take tranquilizers\nand enjoy the useful recuperation of the daily wear on body tissues,\ndeep dreamless sleep of the innocent.\"\n\nHe look at me suspiciously.\n\n\"It sounds like the sort of advice I might have given,\" he admitted.\n\n\"Well, at least I managed to keep my dreams in my head until I started\nyour treatment. I have an urgent problem to solve that vitally affects\nnational security. I can't have this sort of thing happening in the\nmiddle of an experiment.\"\n\nI pointed to the fried egg on my shoe and shook it off on the pile of\nhis green carpet.\n\n\"Yes. Well,\" he said, peering over the desk at it. \"If you feel that\nstrongly, Mr. Jones, perhaps you'd better give up the diet and just\ntake the pills.\"\n\n\"I want to know how it happens,\" I said, and I settled firmly into the\nconsulting chair.\n\nDr. Doogle coughed professionally. \"Of course, of course. You are an\nintelligent man, Mr. Jones. One of our leading physical scientists.\nNaturally you wish to know the precise mechanism of such phenomena.\nVery commendable and entirely natural. Think no more about it.\"\n\n\"Dr. Doogle, do you know what you are doing?\"\n\n\"Spacio-Psycho is still in its early stages, Mr. Jones. You are really\nprivileged to be a pioneer, you know. We have had some most interesting\nresults with that new tranquilizer. I hope you're not losing faith, Mr.\nJones?\"\n\n\"I accept the orthodox philosophy of Spacio-Psycho, it is only the\nbasic philosophy of Ch'anna or Zen, and I had the routine scientific\neducation, naturally.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Dr. Doogle with rapture, \"the substratum of the universe is\nno-mind, and thus all material things are in constant unimpeded mutual\nsolution. Ji-ji-muge, the appleness of an apple is indistinguishable\nfrom the cupness of a cup.\"\n\n\"And an egg on the shoe is the breakfast I didn't have,\" I said.\n\n\"Here,\" he said. \"I think those pills are sending your sleeping\nmind down beyond the purely personal level of your own emotions and\nsubconscious cerebrations. Take these, in a little water, half an hour\nbefore going to bed.\"\n\nI stood up and walked over to the door.\n\n\"What are they?\" I asked.\n\n\"Same as before, only stronger. Should send you right down to the\nroot of things. Pass quiet nights in no-mind, Mr. Jones, sleep beyond\nthe trammels of self, support yourself on the universal calm sea of\nno-mind.\"\n\n\"If these don't work, there'll be no-fee,\" I told him.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI took three of the stronger pills that night, turned off the light and\nlay back in bed, waiting for sleep to come and get me. The antiseptic\nodor of the Medical Center recalled itself, but nothing else happened,\nand I was still waiting to go to sleep when I woke up next morning.\nNo dreams of a breakfast I couldn't eat, no dreams at all. I had been\nsmelling the memory of formaldehyde and just slid off to sleep. I could\nstill smell it, for that matter, as if it were coming from the slightly\nopen bedroom window. I looked up.\n\n\"Hallo,\" said the tall skinny man in a doctor's coat on the window sill.\n\n\"Hallo yourself,\" I said. \"Go away, I'm awake.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are. At least I assume you are. But I'm not.\"\n\nI sat up and looked at him, and he obligingly turned his head to\nprofile against the brightness of the window. He had a sharp, beaky\nface that was familiar.\n\n\"Haven't we met somewhere?\" I asked.\n\n\"Certainly,\" he said, in a slightly affected voice.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I don't know your name,\" he said, \"but I have a very important\npost-operative case at present, and you keep charging around the ward\nwhen you're asleep. I just came over, as soon as I could get a few\nhours' sleep myself, to ask you to stop doing it, if you don't mind.\"\n\n\"I've done no such thing.\"\n\n\"You were doing it all last night, my friend.\"\n\n\"I was not,\" I said. \"I spent last night here in my own bed. I didn't\neven dream.\"\n\n\"Ah, that probably accounts for it. Tell me, do you take drugs,\ntranquilizers, by any chance? We've had a lot of trouble with that.\nThey seem to cause a bubble in the sequence of probabilities and things\nshift about. I've been taking a new one myself, while this case is on.\nI suspect that although I'm dreaming you, I think, you are not asleep\nat all. At least I wasn't when you made all that noise in my ward last\nnight.\"\n\n\"No, I'm awake,\" I said. \"Very much so.\"\n\n\"I see. Well, I shall wake up soon myself and go back to my own world,\nof course. But while I'm here, I suppose you haven't any advanced works\non post-operative hyperspace relapse?\n\n\"Pity,\" he said, as I shook my head.\n\n\"I suppose you have no information on the fourth octave of\nultra-uranium elements?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Didn't even know they existed,\" he said. \"I don't\nbelieve they do in my probable time. What are you, a physicist? Ah,\" he\nadded, as I nodded, \"I wanted to specialize in physics when I was in\ncollege, but I went in for medicine instead.\"\n\n\"So did I,\" I said, \"medicine, I mean, but I never passed pharmacology\nwith all those confusing extraterrestrial derivatives.\"\n\n\"Really?\" he said interestedly. \"It's my weakest subject, too. I'm a\npretty good surgeon, but an awful fool with medications. I suppose\nthat's how we got together. You won't come busting up the ward again,\nwill you?\"\n\n\"I'd like to be obliging, but if I don't dream and I don't know where I\nam when I'm asleep, I don't see what I can do to stop it. It's not as\nif I'm really there, is it?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe crossed his arms and frowned at me. \"Look,\" he said. \"In my probable\ntime, you're as much physically there as I am now in your time here.\nI'll prove it. I know I'm asleep in the emergency surgeon's room in my\nhospital. You know you're awake in your bedroom.\"\n\nHe held out his hand and walked across the floor to me.\n\n\"My name's Jones,\" he said.\n\n\"So's mine,\" I answered, shaking his solid hand. \"This must be a very\nvivid dream to you.\"\n\nWe smiled at each other, and as he turned away, I caught sight of his\nreflection in the wall mirror beside my hairbrush on the cabinet.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" I said. \"In a mirror, you look exactly like me. Is your\nname Harry Jones?\"\n\nHe stopped, walked over to the mirror and moved about until he could\nsee me in it.\n\n\"Harold K. Jones,\" he said. \"You've got the face I shave every morning,\nbut I've only just recognized you. You're me.\"\n\n\"I prefer to think you are me,\" I said.\n\n\"So you did fail that final pharmacology exam, eh? And I didn't, in my\nprobability. Well, well. I must admit it seemed more probable I would\nfail at the time, but I passed.\"\n\n\"It was that tramp Kate's fault. She said yes too easily.\"\n\nHe coughed and looked at his fingers. \"She said no to me. And, as a\nmatter of fact, after I passed I married her. She's my wife.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. I meant nothing personal.\"\n\n\"You never married?\"\n\n\"I never really got over Kate,\" I said.\n\n\"I wonder what would have happened if I had qualified and then not\nmarried her.\"\n\n\"You mean what _did_ happen--to the Harry K. Jones who passed in\npharmacology but did not marry Kate. He must be around in another\nprobability somewhere, the same as we are. Good heavens,\" I shouted,\n\"somewhere I may have solved the fourth octave equation.\"\n\n\"You're right, Harry. And I may have found out how to get hyperspace\nrelapse under control.\"\n\n\"Harold,\" I said, \"This is momentous! It is more probable that\nyou-I and I-you will make a mess of things, but there must be other\nprobability sequences where we are successful.\"\n\n\"And we can get to them,\" he shouted, jumping up. \"Are you using\noxylatohydrobenzoic-pheophenophino?\"\n\n\"Something like that.\"\n\n\"Three pills last thing at night?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ever have foreign bodies materialize into your time-space?\"\n\n\"Several breakfasts,\" I said. \"The last egg was yesterday, on my shoe.\"\n\n\"It was Virginia ham with me, so I stopped dieting and increased the\ndosage.\"\n\n\"So did I,\" I said. \"I suppose, apart from major points where a whole\nprobability branches off, we lead much the same lives. But eggs don't\ndream. How did the ham get into your waking world?\"\n\n\"Harry, really! I have a tendency to jump to conclusions, which you\nmust control. How do you know eggs don't dream? I would have thought,\nthough, that a pig was peculiarly liable to the nightmare that it will\nend up as a rasher--any reasonably observant pig, that is. But I don't\nthink that is necessary. Obviously, we are dipping down to a stratum\nwhere things coexist in fact, and not merely one in fact and the other\nin mind, or one probability and not its twin alternative. Now, how do I\nget hold of the me that solved this hyperspace relapse business?\"\n\n\"And I the ultra-uranium octave relationship,\" I added.\n\n\"Look out,\" he said. \"I'm waking up. Good-by, Harry. Look after\nmyself....\"\n\nHe flickered, paused in recovery and then faded insubstantially away. I\nlooked around my empty bedroom. Then, because it was time to go to work\nat the laboratory, I shaved, dressed and left my apartment, as usual.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome high brass and politicians had been visiting the laboratory,\nshowing off to their females how they were important enough to visit\nthe top-secret bomb proving labs, and the thick perfume was hanging in\nthe sealed rooms like a damp curtain.\n\n\"I wish they wouldn't bring women into the unventilated labs,\" I\ngrumbled to my assistant.\n\n\"Never mind, Chief. If you can make this bomb work, they'll let you\nbuild your own lab in the Nevada desert, with no roads to it. Have you\nfound the solution?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you when I have,\" I said. \"But I do have a new approach to\nthe problem.\"\n\nAnd as soon as I could, I left the labs and went back to my apartment\ndowntown, took three pills and lay still, waiting for sleep. I could\nnot get the smell of that perfume in the lab out of my nose. It was a\nheavy gardenia-plus-whatnot odor. I woke up in the middle of the night\nwith the perfume still clinging to the air. The room was dark and I\ncrossed my fingers as I leaned over to turn on the bedside lamp. If\nmental concentration on all the possible errors in my work was the key,\nthe successful me should be here in the room, snatched from his own\nsegment of probability.\n\nI turned on the light. There was no one else in the room.\n\n\"Hell,\" I said.\n\nPerhaps it just meant he, or that me, was not asleep, or was perversely\nnot using tranquilizers. Or didn't that matter? No, I controlled this\nalone and had gone wrong.\n\n\"Did you say something, Harry?\" asked Kate, stepping out of the\nbathroom and pulling the top of her nightgown into, I guess, place.\n\"Ooo, fancy dreaming about you. This is odd.\"\n\nI sat up and covered myself protectively in the bedsheets.\n\n\"Look, Kate,\" I said. \"I don't want to see you. I'm not your husband,\nreally. He's a pleasant fellow, I met him today, and he's not me. I\nnever became a doctor. No doubt you remember what I was doing instead\nof studying.\"\n\nThat was a mistake, for she came and sat on the edge of the bed and ran\nher fingers into my hair.\n\n\"I thought it was odd I should dream about my husband,\" she said. \"I'll\nbelieve you, because I don't know how I got here and you do look like\nthe Harry I used to know, before he went all high scientific surgeon\nand no time for fun.\"\n\nShe curved more fully than she had when she was eighteen, but there was\nneat symmetry to her sine formulae, and she still had blonde hair. Her\nperfume was the same as the one in the lab I had been smelling all day,\nit was now reaching me at high amperage.\n\nSo that was the key, the evocative power of smell association. I\nsniffed deeply at the perfume in appreciation.\n\n\"Like it?\" Kate asked, wriggling.\n\n\"Only for its scientific values,\" I said. \"It suggests a most valuable\nline of research.\"\n\n\"I'm in favor,\" she said, and pressed me to the bed.\n\n\"Your husband is coming!\" I shouted, and it worked. She disappeared.\nPresumably she woke up in her own probability time-space. And no doubt\nKate's reflexes by now were trained to snap her awake and away at the\nsuggestion that her husband was around. It was highly improbable that\nKate would alter much.\n\nI got up to make myself some coffee. There was no point in wasting\nsleep without a plan. Clearly, I had to take the pills and fix the\nappropriate smell in my mind, and when I woke up I would drag the\nproper slice of another probability with me. And then I would interview\nthe me who had solved the ultra-uranium heavy element equation. And the\nbomb to end all bombs would be perfected. The test was ready, waiting\nfor me to say, \"Let's go, boys. We know what will happen this time.\"\n\nBut there was, it struck me, the difficulty of finding the right scent\nto evoke the right probable me.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI collected all the toothpaste, deodorant, shaving stick, aftershave\nlotion I could find in the bathroom and started on the toothpaste. I\ninhaled deeply and lay down, with the first tube on my chest. But after\nthe coffee, I slept very briefly, and when I looked up there was only a\ntoothbrush on the carpet. It was not mine in this world and I had no\nidea whose it was, or rather which probable me it belonged to.\n\nBut at least this established the principle. The smell produced the\nobject--and, if I went deep enough in sleep, it would produce the whole\nJones.\n\nI dressed quickly and went out for a walk in the night air, breathing\ndeeply and memorizing every scent I came across. Then I went back to\nthe apartment, sniffed hard at the row of personal unguents, and lay\ndown to sleep.\n\nWhen I woke up, it was morning and the room was full of people.\n\nThere were about a dozen of me, some wearing very odd clothes, some\nscowling, others grinning unbecomingly, and some looking just plain\nstupid.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" I said, standing up on my bed, \"I am sorry to disturb your\ndreams but a matter of vital consequence has made me call you all here.\nI am Harry, or Harold K. Jones, and I became a physicist. I need your\nhelp. Do any of you know anything about the octaves of elements beyond\nuranium?\"\n\nThere was a babble, through which I heard chiefly:\n\n\"The man's mad.... He says he's me.... Who are you, anyway?... No,\nyou're not. _I'm_ Jones....\"\n\n\"Please, gentlemen,\" I said. \"I don't expect we have much time\nbefore some of you wake up in your own probability. You, sir, in the\narmchair--yes, you in the tight pants--how about you?\"\n\n\"Me?\" he said. \"I'm Captain Jones. Third Vector Spacefleet. Engineer\nrank. Who the galactic hellix are you, eh?\"\n\nEven from the bed, I could detect the smell of sweat and grease from\nhis working uniform.\n\n\"I suppose you took up flight engineering at high school?\" I suggested.\n\n\"Quite right,\" he snapped.\n\nAn early deviation, obviously. I remembered being enthralled with the\narrival when I was a kid of the early space rockets, but my enthusiasm\nwas daunted by old Birchall, who made us stick to airplanes. Obviously,\nhis was not.\n\n\"How about you?\" I asked, pointing to the thinnest me in the room.\n\n\"Penal colony on Arcetus,\" he said. \"Eternal labor.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sorry. I wonder which time--well, how many physicists are\nthere here, or physical chemists, or astronomers, or even general\nscientists?\"\n\nI walked around the room, detecting toothpaste brands A, B, C and\nWhitebrighter, and a range of toilet preparations with manly odors\ncontributing to our popularity with friends, relatives, girls and\nbosses, but no other physicist. Not a trace of research in my line. And\none or two of them were already showing signs of waking up elsewhere\nand disappearing from the room.\n\nI was about to start tracing it back to the point when I abandoned a\nmedical career, and I could still smell the formaldehyde, when Dr.\nHarold K. Jones appeared.\n\n\"Look,\" he said, \"I want you to keep away from Kate. Perhaps I didn't\nmake that clear yesterday.... Good heavens, where did you get all of\nthese me from? Does anyone here know anything about post-operative\nhyperspace relapse?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDisgustedly, I saw that more than half of them did. Perhaps I should\nhave been a doctor, after all. The probabilities were heavily\nrepresented in medicine. I sat on the bed and stared at my toes while\nthe doctors babbled excitedly together. I gathered that Dr. Harold K.\nJones had solved his problem, anyway.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said a thoughtful me in a very quiet voice. \"I didn't want\nto make myself obtrusive, but I did do a certain amount of research\non the theoretical possibilities of elements heavier than uranium. It\nseemed to me they might go on being discovered almost indefinitely.\"\n\n\"They are,\" I said quickly, \"octave after octave of them. Tell me about\nit, please.\"\n\n\"Look,\" he said, \"it was only an idea. I really specialized in\nbiochemistry, but we do use trace elements, and the formula I worked\nout at the time was--let me see....\"\n\n\"Please try to remember,\" I said.\n\n\"Ah, yes, it was this,\" he said, and the strain of remembering woke him\nup and he disappeared back to his own probability.\n\n\"This was damned well planned, Harry!\" said Dr. Harold K. Jones\nenthusiastically. \"I think we can save hundreds of people every year\nnow. I always knew I had it in me.\"\n\n\"Listen, Jones,\" said Captain Jones of the Third Vector Spacefleet,\npushing himself through the crowd. \"I've been talking to one or two of\nthe others, see, and if you have the galactic gall to disturb my sleep\nagain, I'm going to blast you. Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" I said.\n\n\"It's tricky out in space, you know. No hard feelings, but the fraction\nof a micro-error and _poof_! You see what I mean. I must get a sound\nsleep at stand-down.\"\n\n\"Don't forget what I said about Kate,\" Dr. Harold K. Jones remembered\nto warn me. \"I know how to do it, too. And you can have an accident\nwith my instruments--easily.\"\n\nHe disappeared. I watched as the others woke up and went, one by one,\neven the felon from Arcetus, until they were all gone and I was alone\nwith dark thoughts on heavy elements. It was so improbable that I was\nthe only me who had worked on these lines, and very probable that if\ntwo of us with similar minds did work on the same problem, we could\nbetween us find the answer. Look at Dr. Jones and his hyperspace\nrelapse.\n\nThinking of Dr. Jones made me think of Kate, and I fell asleep again\nwith the memory of her scent in my head, as if I were really smelling\nit. When I woke up again, halfway through the morning, there she was in\nmy room. She was at least dressed this time, but she smiled familiarly\nat me.\n\n\"For God's sake, Kate,\" I said, \"go back to your husband!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe began to cry. \"Oh, Haroldkin,\" she said. \"I'm so glad to see you. I\nmust be dreaming, because I know you're dead, but I've kept everything\njust the way it was. Look--I haven't even touched your messy desk.\"\n\n\"Are you sitting in a room?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'm in your study, Haroldkin,\" she said, surprised. \"Can't you see?\"\n\n\"No, as a matter of fact, I can't.\"\n\n\"Oh! Then I can throw out all these old papers?\"\n\n\"What old papers?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know, Haroldkin,\" Kate said. \"You made such a fuss about\nfailing that silly medical exam that you never let me touch your desk\nwhen you graduated in physics.\"\n\n\"Physics!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kate, throwing paper after paper onto the carpet. She made\nsweeping motions in the air and dumped a mass of notes into her lap.\nThey appeared on her fingertips, but they stayed in existence when she\ndropped them on the carpet.\n\n\"How did I die?\" I asked, bending down and thumbing rapidly over the\npapers.\n\n\"A bomb went off,\" she said. \"I really don't want to talk about it. But\nyou were so _eminent_, Haroldkin!\"\n\nI must have been very soft in the discrimination to have allowed that\nrevolting nickname, I thought, but it was clear from the papers I was\nholding that I knew my physics. And there it was, printed in an issue\nof the _Commission's Journal_ that never existed in my time-space, the\nwhole equation I was looking for. It was so obvious when I read it that\nI could not understand how I failed to think of it for myself--for my\nown myself, that is.\n\nWhen I looked up, this probable Kate had gone. I wanted to thank her,\nbut the evening would do. Meanwhile, here was the ultra-uranium fourth\noctave equation.\n\nI called the laboratory, read it off to my assistant, and told him to\nget on with the test.\n\n\"Right, Chief. I'll go down myself and give you a report when I get\nback.\"\n\nI said fine and took the rest of the day off. It was the peak of my\ncareer so far, and from the widow Kate's comments, it seemed as if\nI had a great probable career to come. Of course, I would have to\nredouble our safety precautions at the labs and it would be best if I\nnever went near the proving grounds. That other physicist me probably\nmade some error that I would avoid, being forewarned.\n\nBy evening, I decided to try to locate that probable Kate again, to\nthank her, and to find out exactly how that poor me blew himself up\nwith a bomb. With care, I recalled the perfume and also the musty smell\nof the papers, for I did not want Dr. Harold K. Jones' Kate appearing.\nThen I removed all other odoriferous substances from the bedroom, took\nthree pills and was about to lie down to sleep when my assistant\ncalled to report on the test.\n\n\"That you, Chief? What a success! We're made. Your name's in lights,\nChief! It was the most colossal explosion I've ever seen. It burned the\narea like toast. It even smelled like toast, with a touch of ozone and\nsulphur. Very strong smell....\"\n\n\"Stop!\" I screamed. \"Stop!\"\n\nBut it was too late. I could smell it clearly as he had described it.\nAnd now the pills are working. How in the name of heaven am I going to\nstay awake? Because once I fall asleep....\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Scent Makes a Difference, by James Stamers\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SCENT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 51773.txt or 51773.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/5/1/7/7/51773/\n\nProduced by Greg Weeks, Mary Meehan and the Online\nDistributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
