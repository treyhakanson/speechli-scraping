You walk down an empty\nstreet, yearning for the sight of one living face--one moving figure.\nThen you see a man on a corner and you know your terror has only\nbegun._]\n\n\nHe awoke slowly, like a man plodding knee-deep through the thick stuff\nof nightmares. There was no definite line between the dream-state and\nwakefulness. Only a dawning knowledge that he was finally conscious and\nwould have to do something about it.\n\nHe opened his eyes, but this made no difference. The blackness remained.\nThe pain in his head brightened and he reached up and found the big lump\nthey'd evidently put on his head for good measure--a margin of safety.\n\nThey must have been prudent people, because the bang on the head had\nhardly been necessary. The spiked drink which they had given him would\nhave felled an ox. He remembered going down into the darkness after\ndrinking it, and of knowing what it was. He remembered the helpless\nfeeling.\n\nIt did not worry him now. He was a philosophical person, and the fact he\nwas still alive cancelled out the drink and its result. He thought, with\nsavor, of the chestnut-haired girl who had watched him take the drink.\nShe had worn a very low bodice, and that was where his eyes had been at\nthe last moment--on the beautiful, tanned breasts--until they'd wavered\nand puddled into a blur and then into nothing.\n\nThe chestnut-haired girl had been nice, but now she was gone and there\nwere more pressing problems.\n\nHe sat up, his hands behind him at the ends of stiff arms clawing into\nlong-undisturbed dust and filth. His movement stirred the dust and it\nrose into his nostrils.\n\nHe straightened and banged his head against a low ceiling. The pain made\nhim sick for a minute and he sat down to regain his senses. He cursed\nthe ceiling, as a matter of course, in an agonized whisper.\n\nReady to move again, he got onto his hands and knees and crawled\ncautiously forward, exploring as he went. His hand pushed through\ncobwebs and found a rough, cement wall. He went around and around. It\nwas all cement--all solid.\n\nHell! They hadn't sealed him up in this place! There had been a way in\nso there had to be a way out. He went around again.\n\nThen he tried the ceiling and found the opening--a wooden trap covering\na four-by-four hole--covering it snugly. He pushed the trap away and\ndaylight streamed in. He raised himself up until he was eye-level with a\ndiscarded shaving cream jar lying on the bricks of an alley. He could\nread the trade mark on the jar, and the slogan: \"For the Meticulous\nMan\".\n\nHe pulled himself up into the alley. As a result of an orderly\nchildhood, he replaced the wooden trap and kicked the shaving cream jar\nagainst a garbage can. He rubbed his chin and looked up and down the\nalley.\n\nIt was high noon. An uncovered sun blazed down to tell him this.\n\nAnd there was no one in sight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe started walking toward the nearer mouth of the alley. He had been in\nthat hole a long time, he decided. This conviction came from his hunger\nand the heavy growth of beard he'd sprouted. Twenty-four hours--maybe\nlonger. That mickey must have been a lulu.\n\nHe walked out into the cross street. It was empty. No people--no cars\nparked at the curbs--only a cat washing its dirty face on a tenement\nstoop across the street. He looked up at the tenement windows. They\nstared back. There was an empty, deserted look about them.\n\nThe cat flowed down the front steps of the tenement and away toward the\nrear and he was truly alone. He rubbed his harsh chin. Must be Sunday,\nhe thought. Then he knew it could not be Sunday. He'd gone into the\ntavern on a Tuesday night. That would make it five days. Too long.\n\nHe had been walking and now he was at an intersection where he could\nlook up and down a new street. There were no cars--no people. Not even a\ncat.\n\nA sign overhanging the sidewalk said: Restaurant. He went in under the\nsign and tried the door. It was locked. There were no lights inside. He\nturned away--grinning to reassure himself. Everything was all right.\nJust some kind of a holiday. In a big city like Chicago the people go\naway on hot summer holidays. They go to the beaches and the parks and\nsometimes you can't see a living soul on the streets. And of course you\ncan't find any cars because the people use them to drive to the beaches\nand the parks and out into the country. He breathed a little easier and\nstarted walking again.\n\nSure--that was it. Now what the hell holiday was it? He tried to\nremember. He couldn't think of what holiday it could be. Maybe they'd\ndreamed up a new one. He grinned at that, but the grin was a little\ntight and he had to force it. He forced it carefully until his teeth\nshowed white.\n\nPretty soon he would come to a section where everybody hadn't gone to\nthe beaches and the parks and a restaurant would be open and he'd get a\ngood meal.\n\nA meal? He fumbled toward his pockets. He dug into them and found a\nhandkerchief and a button from his cuff. He remembered that the button\nhad hung loose so he'd pulled it off to keep from losing it. He hadn't\nlost the button, but everything else was gone. He scowled. The least\nthey could have done was to leave a man eating money.\n\nHe turned another corner--into another street--and it was like the one\nbefore. No cars--no people--not even any cats.\n\nPanic welled up. He stopped and whirled around to look behind him. No\none was there. He walked in a tight circle, looking in all directions.\nWindows stared back at him--eyes that didn't care where everybody had\ngone or when they would come back. The windows could wait. The windows\nwere not hungry. Their heads didn't ache. They weren't scared.\n\nHe began walking and his path veered outward from the sidewalk until he\nwas in the exact center of the silent street. He walked down the worn\nwhite line. When he got to the next corner he noticed that the traffic\nsignals were not working. Black, empty eyes.\n\nHis pace quickened. He walked faster--ever faster until he was trotting\non the brittle pavement, his sharp steps echoing against the buildings.\nFaster. Another corner. And he was running, filled with panic, down the\nempty street.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling. The ceiling was a\nblur but it began to clear as her mind cleared. The ceiling became a\nsurface of dirty, cracked plaster and there was a feeling of dirt and\nsqualor in her mind.\n\nIt was always like that at these times of awakening, but doubly bitter\nnow, because she had never expected to awaken again. She reached down\nand pulled the wadded sheet from beneath her legs and spread it over\nthem. She looked at the bottle on the shabby bed-table. There were three\nsleeping pills left in it. The girl's eyes clouded with resentment.\nYou'd think seven pills would have done it. She reached down and took\nthe sheet in both hands and drew it taut over her stomach. This was a\ngesture of frustration. Seven hadn't been enough, and here she was\nagain--awake in the world she'd wanted to leave. Awake with the\nnecessary edge of determination gone.\n\nShe pulled the sheet into a wad and threw it at the wall. She got up and\nwalked to the window and looked out. Bright daylight. She wondered how\nlong she had slept. A long time, no doubt.\n\nHer naked thigh pressed against the windowsill and her bare stomach\ntouched the dirty pane. Naked in the window, but it didn't matter,\nbecause it gave onto an airshaft and other windows so caked with grime\nas to be of no value as windows.\n\nBut even aside from that, it didn't matter. It didn't matter in the\nleast.\n\nShe went to the washstand, her bare feet making no sound on the worn\nrug. She turned on the faucets, but no water came. No water, and she had\na terrible thirst. She went to the door and had thrown the bolt before\nshe remembered again that she was naked. She turned back and saw the\nhalf-empty Pepsi-Cola bottle on the floor beside the bed table. Someone\nelse had left it there--how many nights ago?--but she drank it anyhow,\nand even though it was flat and warm it soothed her throat.\n\nShe bent over to pick up garments from the floor and dizziness came,\nforcing her to the edge of the bed. After a while it passed and she got\nher legs into one of the garments and pulled it on.\n\nTaking cosmetics from her bag, she went again to the washstand and tried\nthe taps. Still no water. She combed her hair, jerking the comb through\nthe mats and gnarls with a satisfying viciousness. When the hair fell\ninto its natural, blond curls, she applied powder and lip-stick. She\nwent back to the bed, picked up her brassiere and began putting it on as\nshe walked to the cracked, full-length mirror in the closet door. With\nthe brassiere in place, she stood looking at her slim image. She assayed\nherself with complete impersonality.\n\nShe shouldn't look as good as she did--not after the beating she'd\ntaken. Not after the long nights and the days and the years, even though\nthe years did not add up to very many.\n\nI could be someone's wife, she thought, with wry humor. I could be\nsending kids to school and going out to argue with the grocer about the\ntomatoes being too soft. I don't look bad at all.\n\nShe raised her eyes until they were staring into their own images in the\nglass and she spoke aloud in a low, wondering voice. She said, \"Who the\nhell am I, anyway? Who am I? A body named Linda--that's who I am.\nNo--that's _what_ I am. A body's not a _who_--it's a _what_. One hundred\nand fourteen pounds of well-built blond body called Linda--model\n1931--no fender dents--nice paint job. Come in and drive me away. Price\ntag--\"\n\nShe bit into the lower lip she'd just finished reddening and turned\nquickly to walk to the bed and wriggle into her dress--a gray and green\ncotton--the only one she had. She picked up her bag and went to the\ndoor. There she stopped to turn and thumb her nose at the three sleeping\npills in the bottle before she went out and closed the door after\nherself.\n\nThe desk clerk was away from the cubbyhole from which he presided over\nthe lobby, and there were no loungers to undress her as she walked\ntoward the door.\n\nNor was there anyone out in the street. The girl looked north and south.\nNo cars in sight either. No buses waddling up to the curb to spew out\npassengers.\n\nThe girl went five doors north and tried to enter a place called Tim's\nHamburger House. As the lock held and the door refused to open, she saw\nthat there were no lights on inside--no one behind the counter. The\nplace was closed.\n\nShe walked on down the street followed only by the lonesome sound of her\nown clicking heels. All the stores were closed. All the lights were out.\n\n_All the people were gone._\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was a huge man, and the place of concealment of the Chicago Avenue\npolice station was very small--merely an indentation low in the cement\nwall behind two steam pipes. The big man had lain in this niche for\nforty-eight hours. He had slugged a man over the turn of a card in a\npoolroom pinochle game, had been arrested in due course, and was\nawaiting the disposal of his case.\n\nHe was sorry he had slugged the man. He had not had any deep hatred for\nhim, but rather a rage of the moment that demanded violence as its\noutlet. Although he did not consider it a matter of any great\nimportance, he did not look forward to the six month's jail sentence he\nwould doubtless be given.\n\nHis opportunity to hide in the niche had come as accidentally and as\nsuddenly as his opportunity to slug his card partner. It had come after\nthe prisoners had been advised of the crisis and were being herded into\nvans for transportation elsewhere. He had snatched the opportunity\nwithout giving any consideration whatever to the crisis. Probably\nbecause he did not have enough imagination to fear anything--however\nterrible--which might occur in the future. And because he treasured his\nfreedom above all else. Freedom for today, tomorrow could take care of\nitself.\n\nNow, after forty-eight hours, he writhed and twisted his huge body out\nof the niche and onto the floor of the furnace room. His legs were numb\nand he found that he could not stand. He managed to sit up and was able\nto bend his back enough so his great hands could reach his legs and\nbegin to massage life back into them.\n\nSo elementally brutal was this man that he pounded his legs until they\nwere black and blue, before feeling returned to them. In a few minutes\nhe was walking out of the furnace room through a jail house which should\nnow be utterly deserted. But was it? He went slowly, gliding along close\nto the walls to reach the front door unchallenged.\n\nHe walked out into the street. It was daylight and the street was\ncompletely deserted. The man took a deep breath and grinned. \"I'll be\ndamned,\" he muttered. \"I'll be double and triple damned. They're all\ngone. Every damn one of them run off like rats and I'm the only one\nleft. I'll be damned!\"\n\nA tremendous sense of exultation seized him. He clenched his fists and\nlaughed loud, his laugh echoing up the street. He was happier than he\nhad ever been in his quick, violent life. And his joy was that of a\nchild locked in a pantry with a huge chocolate cake.\n\nHe rubbed a hand across his mouth, looked up the street, began walking.\n\"I wonder if they took all the whisky with them,\" he said. Then he\ngrinned; he was sure they had not.\n\nHe began walking in long strides toward Clark Street. In toward the\nstill heart of the empty city.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was a slim, pale-skinned little man, and very dangerous. He was also\nvery clever. Eventually they would have found out, but he had been\nclever enough to deceive them and now they would never know. There was\ngreat wealth in his family, and with the rest of them occupied with\nleaving the city and taking what valuables they could on such short\nnotice, he had been put in charge of one of the chauffeurs.\n\nThe chauffeur had been given the responsibility of getting the\npale-skinned young man out of the city. But the young man had caused\nseveral delays until all the rest were gone. Then, meekly enough, he had\naccompanied the chauffeur to the garage. The chauffeur got behind the\nwheel of the last remaining car--a Cadillac sedan--and the young man had\ngotten into the rear seat.\n\nBut before the chauffeur could start the motor, the young man hit him on\nthe head with a tire bar he had taken from a shelf as they had entered\nthe garage.\n\nThe bar went deep into the chauffeur's skull with a solid sound, and\nthus the chauffeur found the death he was in the very act of fleeing.\n\nThe young man pulled the dead chauffeur from the car and laid him on the\ncement floor. He laid him down very carefully, so that he was in the\nexact center of a large square of outlined cement with his feet pointing\nstraight north and his outstretched arms pointing south.\n\nThe young man placed the chauffeur's cap very carefully upon his chest,\nbecause neatness pleased him. Then he got into the car, started it, and\nheaded east toward Lake Michigan and the downtown section.\n\nAfter traveling three or four miles, he turned the car off the road and\ndrove it into a telephone post. Then he walked until he came to some\nhigh weeds. He lay down in the weeds and waited.\n\nHe knew there would probably be a last vanguard of militia hunting for\nstragglers. If they saw a moving car they would investigate. They would\ntake him into custody and force him to leave the city.\n\nThis, he felt, they had no right to do. All his life he had been ordered\nabout--told to do this and that and the other thing. Stupid orders from\nstupid people. Idiots who went so far as to claim the whole city would\nbe destroyed, just to make people do as they said. God! The ends to\nwhich stupid people would go in order to assert their wills over\nbrilliant people.\n\nThe young man lay in the weeds and dozed off, his mind occupied with the\npleasant memory of the tire iron settling into the skull of the\nchauffeur.\n\nAfter a while he awoke and heard the cars of the last vanguard passing\ndown the road. They stopped, inspected the Cadillac and found it\nserviceable. They took it with them, but they did not search the weeds\nalong the road.\n\nWhen they had disappeared toward the west, the young man came back to\nthe road and began walking east, in toward the city.\n\nComplete destruction in two days?\n\nPreposterous.\n\nThe young man smiled.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe girl was afraid. For hours she had walked the streets of the empty\ncity and the fear, strengthened by weariness, was now mounting toward\nterror. \"One face,\" she whispered. \"Just one person coming out of a\nhouse or walking across the street. That's all I ask. Somebody to tell\nme what this is all about. If I can find one person, I won't be afraid\nany more.\"\n\nAnd the irony of it struck her. A few hours previously she had attempted\nsuicide. Sick of herself and of all people, she had tried to end her own\nlife. Therefore, by acknowledging death as the answer, she should now\nhave no fear whatever of anything. Reconciled to crossing the bridge\ninto death, no facet of life should have held terror for her.\n\nBut the empty city did hold terror. One face--one moving form was all\nshe asked for.\n\nThen, a second irony. When she saw the man at the corner of Washington\nand Wells, her terror increased. They saw each other at almost the same\nmoment. Both stopped and stared. Fingers of panic ran up the girl's\nspine. The man raised a hand and the spell was broken. The girl turned\nand ran, and there was more terror in her than there had been before.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nShe knew how absurd this was, but still she ran blindly. What had she to\nfear? She knew all about men; all the things men could do they had\nalready done to her. Murder was the ultimate, but she was fresh from a\nsuicide attempt. Death should hold no terrors for her.\n\nShe thought of these things as the man's footsteps sounded behind her\nand she turned into a narrow alley seeking a hiding place. She found\nnone and the man turned in after her.\n\nShe found a passageway, entered with the same blindness which had\nbrought her into the alley. There was a steel door at the end and a\nbrick lying by the sill. The door was locked. She picked up the brick\nand turned. The man skidded on the filthy alley surface as he turned\ninto the areaway.\n\nThe girl raised the brick over her head. \"Keep away! Stay away from me!\"\n\n\"Wait a minute! Take it easy. I'm not going to hurt you!\"\n\n\"Get away!\"\n\nHer arm moved downward. The man rushed in and caught her wrist. The\nbrick went over his shoulder and the nails of her other hand raked his\nface. He seized her without regard for niceties and they went to the\nground. She fought with everything she had and he methodically\nneutralized all her weapons--her hands, her legs, her teeth--until she\ncould not move.\n\n\"Leave me alone. Please!\"\n\n\"What's wrong with you? I'm not going to hurt you. But I'm not going to\nlet you hit me with a brick, either!\"\n\n\"What do you want? Why did you chase me?\"\n\n\"Look--I'm a peaceful guy, but I'm not going to let you get away. I\nspent all afternoon looking for somebody. I found you and you ran away.\nI came after you.\"\n\n\"I haven't done anything to you.\"\n\n\"That's silly talk. Come on--grow up! I said I'm not going to hurt you.\"\n\n\"Let me up.\"\n\n\"So you can run away again? Not for a while. I want to talk to you.\"\n\n\"I--I won't run. I was scared. I don't know why. You're hurting me.\"\n\nHe got up--gingerly--and lifted her to her feet. He smiled, still\nholding both her hands. \"I'm sorry. I guess it's natural for you to be\nscared. My name's Frank Brooks. I just want to find out what the hell\nhappened to this town.\"\n\nHe let her withdraw her hands, but he still blocked her escape. She\nmoved a pace backward and straightened her clothing. \"I don't know what\nhappened. I was looking for someone too.\"\n\nHe smiled again. \"And then you ran.\"\n\n\"I don't know why. I guess--\"\n\n\"What's your name.\"\n\n\"Nora--Nora Spade.\"\n\n\"You slept through it too?\"\n\n\"Yes ... yes. I slept through it and came out and they were all gone.\"\n\n\"Let's get out of this alley.\" He preceded her out, but he waited for\nher when there was room for them to walk side by side, and she did not\ntry to run away. That phase was evidently over.\n\n\"I got slipped a mickey in a tavern,\" Frank Brooks said. \"Then they\nslugged me and put me in a hole.\"\n\nHis eyes questioned. She felt their demand and said, \"I was--asleep in\nmy hotel room.\"\n\n\"They overlooked you?\"\n\n\"I guess so.\"\n\n\"Then you don't know anything about it?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Something terrible must have happened.\"\n\n\"Let's go down this way,\" Frank said, and they moved toward Madison\nStreet. He had taken her arm and she did not pull away. Rather, she\nwalked invitingly close to him.\n\nShe said, \"It's so spooky. So ... empty. I guess that's what scared me.\"\n\n\"It would scare anybody. There must have been an evacuation of some\nkind.\"\n\n\"Maybe the Russians are going to drop a bomb.\"\n\nFrank shook his head. \"That wouldn't explain it. I mean, the Russians\nwouldn't let us know ahead of time. Besides, the army would be here.\nEverybody wouldn't be gone.\"\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about germ warfare. Do you suppose the\nwater, maybe, has been poisoned?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"The same thing holds true. Even if they moved the\npeople out, the army would be here.\"\n\n\"I don't know. It just doesn't make sense.\"\n\n\"It happened, so it has to make sense. It was something that came up all\nof a sudden. They didn't have much more than twenty-four hours.\" He\nstopped suddenly and looked at her. \"We've got to get out of here!\"\n\nNora Spade smiled for the first time, but without humor. \"How? I haven't\nseen one car. The buses aren't running.\"\n\nHis mind was elsewhere. They had started walking again. \"Funny I didn't\nthink of that before.\"\n\n\"Think of what?\"\n\n\"That anybody left in this town is a dead pigeon. The only reason they'd\nclear out a city would be to get away from certain death. That would\nmean death is here for anybody that stays. Funny. I was so busy looking\nfor somebody to talk to that I never thought of that.\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"Is that what you were scared of?\"\n\n\"Not particularly. I'm not afraid to die. It was something else that\nscared me. The aloneness, I guess.\"\n\n\"We'd better start walking west--out of the city. Maybe we'll find a car\nor something.\"\n\n\"I don't think we'll find any cars.\"\n\nHe drew her to a halt and looked into her face. \"You aren't afraid at\nall, are you?\"\n\nShe thought for a moment. \"No, I guess I'm not. Not of dying, that is.\nDying is a normal thing. But I was afraid of the empty streets--nobody\naround. That was weird.\"\n\n\"It isn't weird now?\"\n\n\"Not--not as much.\"\n\n\"I wonder how much time we've got?\"\n\nNora shrugged. \"I don't know, but I'm hungry.\"\n\n\"We can fix that. I broke into a restaurant a few blocks back and got\nmyself a sandwich. I think there's still food around. They couldn't take\nit all with them.\"\n\nThey were on Madison Street and they turned east on the south side of\nthe street. Nora said, \"I wonder if there are any other people still\nhere--like us?\"\n\n\"I think there must be. Not very many, but a few. They would have had to\nclean four million people out overnight. It stands to reason they must\nhave missed a few. Did you ever try to empty a sack of sugar? Really\nempty it? It's impossible. Some of the grains always stick to the sack.\"\n\nA few minutes later the wisdom of this observation was proven when they\ncame to a restaurant with the front window broken out and saw a man and\na woman sitting at one of the tables.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe was a huge man with a shock of black hair and a mouth slightly open\nshowing a set of incredibly white teeth. He waved an arm and shouted,\n\"Come on in! Come on in for crissake and sit down! We got beer and roast\nbeef and the beer's still cold. Come on in and meet Minna.\"\n\nThis was different, Nora thought. Not eerie. Not weird, like seeing a\nman standing on a deserted street corner with no one else around. This\nseemed normal, natural, and even the smashed window didn't detract too\nmuch from the naturalness.\n\nThey went inside. There were chairs at the table and they sat down. The\nbig man did not get up. He waved a hand toward his companion and said,\n\"This is Minna. Ain't she something? I found her sitting at an empty bar\nscared to death. We came to an understanding and I brought her along.\"\nHe grinned at the woman and winked. \"We came to a real understanding,\ndidn't we, Minna?\"\n\nMinna was a completely colorless woman of perhaps thirty-five. Her skin\nwas smooth and pale and she wore no makeup of any kind. Her hair was\ndrawn straight back into a bun. The hair had no predominating color. It\nwas somewhere between light brown and blond.\n\nShe smiled a little sadly, but the laugh did not cover her worn, tired\nlook. It seemed more like a gesture of obedience than anything else.\n\"Yes. We came to an understanding.\"\n\n\"I'm Jim Wilson,\" the big man boomed. \"I was in the Chicago Avenue jug\nfor slugging a guy in a card game. They kind of overlooked me when they\ncleaned the joint out.\" He winked again. \"I kind of helped them overlook\nme. Then I found Minna.\" There was tremendous relish in his words.\n\nFrank started introductions which Nora Spade cut in on. \"Maybe you know\nwhat happened?\" she asked.\n\nWilson shook his head. \"I was in the jug and they didn't tell us. They\njust started cleaning out the joint. There was talk in the\nbullpen--invasion or something. Nobody knew for sure. Have some beer and\nmeat.\"\n\nNora turned to the quiet Minna. \"Did you hear anything?\"\n\n\"Naw,\" Wilson said with a kind of affectionate contempt. \"She don't know\nanything about it. She lived in some attic dump and was down with a sore\nthroat. She took some pills or something and when she woke up they were\ngone.\"\n\n\"I went to work and--\" Minna began, but Wilson cut her off.\n\n\"She swabs out some joints on Chicago Avenue for a living and that was\nhow she happened to be sitting in that tavern. It's payday, and Minna\nwas waiting for her dough!\" He exploded into laughter and slapped the\ntable with a huge hand. \"Can you beat that? Waiting for her pay at a\ntime like this.\"\n\nFrank Brooks set down his beer bottle. The beer was cold and it tasted\ngood. \"Have you met anybody else? There must be some other people\naround.\"\n\n\"Uh-uh. Haven't met anybody but Minna.\" He turned his eyes on the woman\nagain, then got to his feet. \"Come on, Minna. You and I got to have a\nlittle conference. We got things to talk about.\" Grinning, he walked\ntoward the rear of the restaurant. Minna got up more slowly. She\nfollowed him behind the counter and into the rear of the place.\n\nAlone with Nora, Frank said, \"You aren't eating. Want me to look for\nsomething else?\"\n\n\"No--I'm not very hungry. I was just wondering--\"\n\n\"Wondering about what?\"\n\n\"When it will happen. When whatever is going to happen--you know what I\nmean.\"\n\n\"I'd rather know _what's_ going to happen. I hate puzzles. It's hell to\nhave to get killed and not know what killed you.\"\n\n\"We aren't being very sensible, are we?\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"We should at least act normal.\"\n\n\"I don't get it.\"\n\nNora frowned in slight annoyance. \"Normal people would be trying to\nreach safety. They wouldn't be sitting in a restaurant drinking beer. We\nshould be trying to get away. Even if it does mean walking. Normal\npeople would be trying to get away.\"\n\nFrank stared at his bottle for a moment. \"We should be scared stiff,\nshouldn't we?\"\n\nIt was Nora's turn to ponder. \"I'm not sure. Maybe not. I know I'm not\nfighting anything inside--fear, I mean. I just don't seem to care one\nway or another.\"\n\n\"I care,\" Frank replied. \"I care. I don't want to die. But we're faced\nwith a situation, and either way it's a gamble. We might be dead before\nI finish this bottle of beer. If that's true, why not sit here and be\ncomfortable? Or we might have time to walk far enough to get out of\nrange of whatever it is that chased everybody.\"\n\n\"Which way do you think it is?\"\n\n\"I don't think we have time to get out of town. They cleaned it out too\nfast. We'd need at least four or five hours to get away. If we had that\nmuch time the army, or whoever did it, would still be around.\"\n\n\"Maybe they didn't know themselves when it's going to happen.\"\n\nHe made an impatient gesture. \"What difference does it make? We're in a\nsituation we didn't ask to get in. Our luck put us here and I'm damned\nif I'm going to kick a hole in the ceiling and yell for help.\"\n\nNora was going to reply, but at that moment Jim Wilson came striding out\nfront. He wore his big grin and he carried another half-dozen bottles of\nbeer. \"Minna'll be out in a minute,\" he said. \"Women are always slower\nthan hell.\"\n\nHe dropped into a chair and snapped the cap off a beer bottle with his\nthumb. He held the bottle up and squinted through it, sighing gustily.\n\"Man! I ain't never had it so good.\" He tilted the bottle in salute, and\ndrank.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe sun was lowering in the west now, and when Minna reappeared it\nseemed that she materialized from the shadows, so quietly did she move.\nJim Wilson opened another bottle and put it before her. \"Here--have a\ndrink, baby.\"\n\nObediently, she tilted the bottle and drank.\n\n\"What do you plan to do?\" Frank asked.\n\n\"It'll be dark soon,\" Wilson said. \"We ought to go out and try to\nscrounge some flashlights. I bet the power plants are dead. Probably\naren't any flashlights either.\"\n\n\"Are you going to stay here?\" Nora asked. \"Here in the Loop?\"\n\nHe seemed surprised. \"Why not? A man'd be a fool to walk out on all\nthis. All he wants to eat and drink. No goddam cops around. The life of\nReilly and I should walk out?\"\n\n\"Aren't you afraid of what's going to happen?\"\n\n\"I don't give a good goddam what's going to happen. What the hell!\nSomething's always going to happen.\"\n\n\"They didn't evacuate the city for nothing,\" Frank said.\n\n\"You mean we can all get killed?\" Jim Wilson laughed. \"Sure we can. We\ncould have got killed last week too. We could of got batted in the can\nby a truck anytime we crossed the street.\" He emptied his bottle, threw\nit accurately at a mirror over the cash register. The crash was\nthunderous. \"Trouble with you people, you're worry warts,\" he said with\nan expansive grin. \"Let's go get us some flashlights so we can find our\nway to bed in one of those fancy hotels.\"\n\nHe got to his feet and Minna arose also, a little tired, a little\napprehensive, but entirely submissive. Jim Wilson said, \"Come on, baby.\nI sure won't want to lose _you_.\" He grinned at the others. \"You guys\ncoming?\"\n\nFrank's eyes met Nora's. He shrugged. \"Why not?\" he said. \"Unless you\nwant to start walking.\"\n\n\"I'm too tired,\" Nora said.\n\nAs they stepped out through the smashed window, both Nora and Frank\nhalf-expected to see other forms moving up and down Madison Street. But\nthere was no one. Only the unreal desolation of the lonely pavement and\nthe dark-windowed buildings.\n\n\"The biggest ghost town on earth,\" Frank muttered.\n\nNora's hand had slipped into Frank's. He squeezed it and neither of them\nseemed conscious of the contact.\n\n\"I wonder,\" Nora said. \"Maybe this is only one of them. Maybe all the\nother big cities are evacuated too.\"\n\nJim Wilson and Minna were walking ahead. He turned. \"If you two can't\nsleep without finding out what's up, it's plenty easy to do.\"\n\n\"You think we could find a battery radio in some store?\" Frank asked.\n\n\"Hell no! They'll all be gone. But all you'd have to do is snoop around\nin some newspaper office. If you can read you can find out what\nhappened.\"\n\nIt seemed strange to Frank that he had not thought of this. Then he\nrealized he hadn't tried very hard to think of anything at all. He was\nsurprised, also, at his lack of fear. He's gone through life pretty much\ntaking things as they came--as big a sucker as the next man--making more\nthan his quota of mistakes and blunders. Finding himself completely\nalone in a deserted city for the first time in his life, he had\nnaturally fallen prey to sudden fright. But that had gradually passed,\nand now he was able to accept the new reality fairly passively. He\nwondered if that wasn't pretty much the way of all people. New\nsituations brought a surge of whatever emotion fitted the picture. Then\nthe emotion subsided and the new thing became the ordinary.\n\nThis, he decided, was the manner in which humanity survived. Humanity\ntook things as they came. Pile on enough of anything and it becomes the\nordinary.\n\nJim Wilson had picked up a garbage box and hurled it through the window\nof an electric shop. The glass came down with a crash that shuddered up\nthe empty darkening street and grumbled off into silence. Jim Wilson\nwent inside. \"I'll see what I can find. You stay out here and watch for\ncops.\" His laughter echoed out as he disappeared.\n\nMinna stood waiting silently, unmoving, and somehow she reminded Frank\nof a dumb animal; an unreasoning creature with no mind of her own,\nwaiting for a signal from her master. Strangely, he resented this, but\nat the same time could find no reason for his resentment, except the\nfeeling that no one should appear as much a slave as Minna.\n\nJim Wilson reappeared in the window. He motioned to Minna. \"Come on in,\nbaby. You and me's got to have a little conference.\" His exaggerated\nwink was barely perceptible in the gloom as Minna stepped over the low\nsill into the store. \"Won't be long, folks,\" Wilson said in high good\nhumor, and the two of them vanished into the darkness beyond.\n\nFrank Brooks glanced at Nora, but her face was turned away. He cursed\nsofty under his breath. He said, \"Wait a minute,\" and went into the\nstore through the huge, jagged opening.\n\nInside, he could barely make out the counters. The place was larger than\nit had appeared from the outside. Wilson and Minna were nowhere about.\n\nFrank found the counter he was looking for and pawed out several\nflashlights. They were only empty tubes, but he found a case of\nbatteries in a panel compartment against the wall.\n\n\"Who's there?\"\n\n\"Me. I came in for some flashlights.\"\n\n\"Couldn't you wait?\"\n\n\"It's getting dark.\"\n\n\"You don't have to be so damn impatient.\" Jim Wilson's voice was hostile\nand surly.\n\nFrank stifled his quick anger. \"We'll be outside,\" he said. He found\nNora waiting where he'd left her. He loaded batteries into four\nflashlights before Jim Wilson and Minna reappeared.\n\nWilson's good humor was back. \"How about the Morrison or the Sherman,\"\nhe said. \"Or do you want to get real ritzy and walk up to the Drake?\"\n\n\"My feet hurt,\" Minna said. The woman spoke so rarely, Frank Brooks was\nstartled by her words.\n\n\"Morrison's the closest,\" Jim Wilson said. \"Let's go.\" He took Minna by\nthe arm and swung off up the street. Frank and Nora fell in behind.\n\nNora shivered. Frank, holding her arm, asked, \"Cold?\"\n\n\"No. It's just all--unreal again.\"\n\n\"I see what you mean.\"\n\n\"I never expected to see the Loop dark. I can't get used to it.\"\n\nA vagrant, whispering wind picked up a scrap of paper and whirled it\nalong the street. It caught against Nora's ankle. She jerked perceptibly\nand kicked the scrap away. The wind caught it again and spiralled it\naway into the darkness.\n\n\"I want to tell you something,\" she said.\n\n\"Tell away.\"\n\n\"I told you before that I slept through the--the evacuation, or whatever\nit was. That wasn't exactly true. I did sleep through it, but it was my\nfault. I put myself to sleep.\"\n\n\"I don't get it.\"\n\n\"I tried to kill myself. Sleeping tablets. Seven of them. They weren't\nenough.\"\n\nFrank said nothing while they paced off ten steps through the dark\ncanyon that was Madison Street. Nora wondered if he had heard.\n\n\"I tried to commit suicide.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I was tired of life, I guess.\"\n\n\"What do you want--sympathy?\"\n\nThe sudden harshness in his voice brought her eyes around, but his face\nwas a white blur.\n\n\"No--no, I don't think so.\"\n\n\"Well, you won't get it from me. Suicide is silly. You can have troubles\nand all that--everybody has them--but suicide--why did you try it?\"\n\nA high, thin whine--a wordless vibration of eloquence--needled out of\nthe darkness into their ears. The shock was like a sudden shower of ice\nwater dashed over their bodies. Nora's fingers dug into Frank's arm, but\nhe did not feel the cutting nails. \"We're--there's someone out there in\nthe street!\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwenty-five feet ahead of where Frank and Nora stood frozen there burst\nthe booming voice of Jim Wilson. \"What the hell was that?\" And the shock\nwas dispelled. The white circle from Wilson's flash bit out across the\nblackness to outline movement on the far side of the street. Then Frank\nBrook's light, and Nora's, went exploring.\n\n\"There's somebody over there,\" Wilson bellowed. \"Hey, you! Show your\nface! Quit sneaking around!\"\n\nFrank's light swept an arc that clearly outlined the buildings across\nthe street and then weakened as it swung westward. There was something\nor someone back there, but obscured by the dimness. He was swept by a\nsense of unreality again.\n\n\"Did you see them?\"\n\nNora's light beam had dropped to her feet as though she feared to point\nit out into the darkness. \"I thought I saw something.\"\n\nJim Wilson was swearing industriously. \"There was a guy over there. He\nducked around the corner. Some damn fool out scrounging. Wish I had a\ngun.\"\n\nFrank and Nora moved ahead and the four stood in a group. \"Put out your\nlights,\" Wilson said. \"They make good targets if the jerk's got any\nweapons.\"\n\nThey stood in the darkness, Nora holding tightly to Frank's arm. Frank\nsaid, \"That was the damndest noise I ever heard.\"\n\n\"Like a siren?\" Frank thought Jim Wilson spoke hopefully, as though\nwanting somebody to agree with him.\n\n\"Not like any I ever heard. Not like a whistle, either. More of a moan.\"\n\n\"Let's get into that goddam hotel and--\"\n\nJim Wilson's words were cut off by a new welling-up of the melancholy\nhowling. It had a new pattern this time. It sounded from many places;\nnot nearer, Frank thought, than Lake Street on the north, but spreading\noutward and backward and growing fainter until it died on the wind.\n\nNora was shivering, clinging to Frank without reserve.\n\nJim Wilson said, \"I'll be damned if it doesn't sound like a signal of\nsome kind.\"\n\n\"Maybe it's a language--a way of communication.\"\n\n\"But who the hell's communicating?\"\n\n\"How would I know?\"\n\n\"We best get to that hotel and bar a few doors. A man can't fight in the\ndark--and nothing to fight with.\"\n\nThey hurried up the street, but it was all different now. Gone was the\nillusion of being alone; gone the sense of solitude. Around them the\nghost town had come suddenly alive. Sinister forces more frightening\nthan the previous solitude had now to be reckoned with.\n\n\"Something's happened--something in the last few minutes,\" Nora\nwhispered.\n\nFrank leaned close as they crossed the street to the dark silent pile\nthat was the Morrison hotel. \"I think I know what you mean.\"\n\n\"It's as though there was no one around and then, suddenly, they came.\"\n\n\"I think they came and went away again.\"\n\n\"Did you actually _see_ anyone when you flashed your light?\"\n\n\"No--I can't say positively that I did. But I got the impression there\nwere figures out there--at least dozens of them--and that they moved\nback away from the light. Always just on the edge of it.\"\n\n\"I'm scared, Frank.\"\n\n\"So am I.\"\n\n\"Do you think it could all be imagination?\"\n\n\"Those moans? Maybe the first one--I've heard of people imagining\nsounds. But not the last ones. And besides, we all heard them.\"\n\nJim Wilson, utterly oblivious of any subtle emanations in the air,\nboomed out in satisfaction: \"We don't have to bust the joint open. The\nrevolving door works.\"\n\n\"Then maybe we ought to be careful,\" Frank said. \"Maybe somebody else is\naround here.\"\n\n\"Could be. We'll find out.\"\n\n\"Why are we afraid?\" Nora whispered.\n\n\"It's natural, isn't it?\" Frank melted the beam of his light with that\nof Jim Wilson. The white finger pierced the darkness inside. Nothing\nmoved.\n\n\"I don't see why it should be. If there are people in there they must be\nas scared as we are.\"\n\nNora was very close to him as they entered.\n\nThe lobby seemed deserted. The flashlight beams scanned the empty chairs\nand couches. The glass of the deserted cages threw back reflections.\n\n\"The keys are in there,\" Frank said. He vaulted the desk and scanned the\nnumbers under the pigeon holes.\n\n\"We'd better stay down low,\" Jim Wilson said. \"Damned if I'm going to\nclimb to the penthouse.\"\n\n\"How about the fourth floor?\"\n\n\"That's plenty high enough.\"\n\nFrank came out with a handful of keys. \"Odd numbers,\" he said. \"Four in\na row.\"\n\n\"Well I'll be damned,\" Jim Wilson muttered. But he said no more and they\nclimbed the stairs in silence. They passed the quiet dining rooms and\nbanquet halls, and by the time they reached the fourth floor the doors\ngiving off the corridors had assumed a uniformity.\n\n\"Here they are.\" He handed a key to Wilson. \"That's the end one.\" He\nsaid nothing as he gave Minna her key, but Wilson grunted, \"For\ncrissake!\" in a disgusted voice, took Minna's key and threw it on the\nfloor.\n\nFrank and Nora watched as Wilson unlocked his door. Wilson turned.\n\"Well, goodnight all. If you get goosed by any spooks, just yell.\"\n\nMinna followed him without a word and the door closed.\n\nFrank handed Nora her key. \"Lock your door and you'll be safe. I'll\ncheck the room first.\" He unlocked the door and flashed his light\ninside. Nora was close behind him as he entered. He checked the\nbathroom. \"Everything clear. Lock your door and you'll be safe.\"\n\n\"Frank.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid to stay alone.\"\n\n\"You mean you want me to--\"\n\n\"There are two beds here.\"\n\nHis reply was slow in coming. Nora didn't wait for it. Her voice rose to\nthe edge of hysteria. \"Quit being so damned righteous. Things have\nchanged! Can't you realize that? What does it matter how or where we\nsleep? Does the world care? Will it make a damn bit of difference to the\nworld whether I strip stark naked in front of you?\" A sob choked in her\nthroat. \"Or would that outrage your morality.\"\n\nHe moved toward her, stopped six inches away. \"It isn't that. For God's\nsake! I'm no saint. It's just that I thought you--\"\n\n\"I'm plain scared, and I don't want to be alone. To me that's all that's\nimportant.\"\n\nHer face was against his chest and his arms went around her. But her own\nhands were fists held together against him until he could feel her\nknuckles, hard, against his chest. She was crying.\n\n\"Sure,\" Frank said. \"I'll stay with you. Now take it easy. Everything's\ngoing to be all right.\"\n\nNora sniffled without bothering to reach for her handkerchief. \"Stop\nlying. You know it isn't going to be all right.\"\n\nFrank was at somewhat of a loss. This flareup of Nora's was entirely\nunexpected. He eased toward the place the flashlight had shown the bed\nto be. Her legs hit its edge and she sat down.\n\n\"You--you want me to sleep in the other one?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course,\" Nora replied with marked bitterness. \"I'm afraid you\nwouldn't be very comfortable in with me.\"\n\nThere was a time of silence. Frank took off his jacket, shirt and\ntrousers. It was funny, he thought. He'd spent his money, been drugged,\nbeaten and robbed as a result of one objective--to get into a room alone\nwith a girl. And a girl not nearly as nice as Nora at that. Now, here he\nwas alone with a real dream, and he was tongue-tied. It didn't make\nsense. He shrugged. Life was crazy sometimes.\n\nHe heard the rustle of garments and wondered how much Nora was taking\noff. Then he dropped his trousers, forgotten, to the floor. \"Did you\nhear that?\"\n\n\"Yes. It's that--\"\n\nFrank went to the window, raised the sash. The moaning sound came in\nlouder, but it was from far distance. \"I think that's out around\nEvanston.\"\n\nFrank felt a warmth on his cheek and he realized Nora was by his side,\nleaning forward. He put an arm around her and they stood unmoving in\ncomplete silence. Although their ears were straining for the sound\ncoming down from the north, Frank could not be oblivious of the warm\nflesh under his hand.\n\nNora's breathing was soft against his cheek. She said, \"Listen to how it\nrises and falls. It's almost as though they were using it to talk with.\nThe inflection changes.\"\n\n\"I think that's what it is. It's coming from a lot of different places.\nIt stops in some places and starts in others.\"\n\n\"It's so--weird.\"\n\n\"Spooky,\" Frank said, \"but in a way it makes me feel better.\"\n\n\"I don't see how it could.\" Nora pressed closer to him.\n\n\"It does though, because of what I was afraid of. I had it figured out\nthat the city was going to blow up--that a bomb had been planted that\nthey couldn't find, or something like that. Now, I'm pretty sure it's\nsomething else. I'm willing to bet we'll be alive in the morning.\"\n\nNora thought that over in silence. \"If that's the way it is--if some\nkind of invaders are coming down from the north--isn't it stupid to stay\nhere? Even if we are tired we ought to be trying to get away from them.\"\n\n\"I was thinking the same thing. I'll go and talk to Wilson.\"\n\nThey crossed the room together and he left her by the bed and went on to\nthe door. Then he remembered he was in his shorts and went back and got\nhis trousers. After he'd put them on, he wondered why he'd bothered. He\nopened the door.\n\nSomething warned him--some instinct--or possibly his natural fear and\ncaution coincided with the presence of danger. He heard the footsteps on\nthe carpeting down the hall--soft, but unmistakably footsteps. He\ncalled, \"Wilson--Wilson--that you?\"\n\nThe creature outside threw caution to the winds, Frank sensed rather\nthan heard a body hurtling toward the door. A shrill, mad laughter raked\nhis ears and the weight of a body hit the door.\n\nFrank drew strength from pure panic as he threw his weight against the\npanel, but perhaps an inch or two from the latch the door wavered from\nopposing strength. Through the narrow opening he could feel the hoarse\nbreath of exertion in his face. Insane giggles and curses sounded\nthrough the black stillness.\n\nFrank had the wild conviction he was losing the battle, and added\nstrength came from somewhere. He heaved and there was a scream and he\nknew he had at least one finger caught between the door and the jamb. He\nthrew his weight against the door with frenzied effort and heard the\nsquash of the finger. The voice kited up to a shriek of agony, like that\nof a wounded animal.\n\nEven with his life at stake, and the life of Nora, Frank could not\ndeliberately slice the man's fingers off. Even as he fought the urge,\nand called himself a fool, he allowed the door to give slightly inward.\nThe hand was jerked to safety.\n\nAt that moment another door opened close by and Jim Wilson's voice\nboomed: \"What the hell's going on out here?\"\n\nSimultaneous with this, racing footsteps receded down the hall and from\nthe well of the stairway came a whining cry of pain.\n\n\"Jumping jees!\" Wilson bellowed. \"We got company. We ain't alone!\"\n\n\"He tried to get into my room.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't have opened the door. Nora okay?\"\n\n\"Yeah. She's all right.\"\n\n\"Tell her to stay in her room. And you do the same. We'd be crazy to go\nafter that coot in the dark. He'll keep 'til morning.\"\n\nFrank closed the door, double-locked it and went back to Nora's bed. He\ncould hear a soft sobbing. He reached down and pulled back the covers\nand the sobbing came louder. Then he was down on the bed and she was in\nhis arms.\n\nShe cried until the panic subsided, while he held her and said nothing.\nAfter a while she got control of herself. \"Don't leave me, Frank,\" she\nbegged. \"Please don't leave me.\"\n\nHe stroked her shoulder. \"I won't,\" he whispered.\n\nThey lay for a long time in utter silence, each seeking strength in the\nother's closeness. The silence was finally broken by Nora.\n\n\"Frank?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you want me?\"\n\nHe did not answer.\n\n\"If you want me you can have me, Frank.\"\n\nFrank said nothing.\n\n\"I told you today that I tried to commit suicide. Remember?\"\n\n\"I remember.\"\n\n\"That was the truth. I did it because I was tired of everything. Because\nI've made a terrible mess of things. I didn't want to go on living.\"\n\nHe remained silent, holding her.\n\nAs she spoke again, her voice sharpened. \"Can't you understand what I'm\ntelling you? I'm no good! I'm just a bum! Other men have had me! Why\nshouldn't you? Why should you be cheated out of what other men have\nhad?\"\n\nHe remained silent. After a few moments, Nora said, \"For God's sake,\ntalk! Say something!\"\n\n\"How do you feel about it now? Will you try again to kill yourself the\nnext chance you get?\"\n\n\"No--no, I don't think I'll ever try it again.\"\n\n\"Then things must look better.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about that. I just don't want to do it now.\"\n\nShe did not urge him this time and he was slow in speaking. \"It's kind\nof funny. It really is. Don't get the idea I've got morals. I haven't.\nI've had my share of women. I was working on one the night they slipped\nme the mickey--the night before I woke up to this tomb of a city. But\nnow--tonight--it's kind of different. I feel like I want to protect you.\nIs that strange?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said quietly. \"I guess not.\"\n\nThey lay there silently, their thoughts going off into the blackness of\nthe sepulchral night. After a long while, Nora's even breathing told him\nshe was asleep. He got up quietly, covered her, and went to the other\nbed.\n\nBut before he slept, the weird wailings from out Evanston way came\nagain--rose and fell in that strange conversational cadence--then died\naway into nothing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrank awoke to the first fingers of daylight. Nora still slept. He\ndressed and stood for some moments with his hand on the door knob. Then\nhe threw the bolt and cautiously opened the door.\n\nThe hallway was deserted. At this point it came to him forcibly that he\nwas not a brave man. All his life, he realized, he had avoided physical\ndanger and had refused to recognize the true reason for so doing. He had\nclassified himself as a man who dodged trouble through good sense; that\nthe truly civilized person went out of his way to keep the peace.\n\nHe realized now that that attitude was merely salve for his ego. He\nfaced the empty corridor and did not wish to proceed further. But\nstripped of the life-long alibi, he forced himself to walk through the\ndoorway, close the door softly, and move toward the stairs.\n\nHe paused in front of the door behind which Jim Wilson and Minna were no\ndoubt sleeping. He stared at it wistfully. It certainly would not be a\nmark of cowardice to get Jim Wilson up under circumstances such as\nthese. In fact, he would be a fool not to do so.\n\nStubbornness forbade such a move, however. He walked softly toward the\nplace where the hallway dead-ended and became a cross-corridor. He made\nthe turn carefully, pressed against one wall. There was no one in sight.\nHe got to the stairway and started down.\n\nHis muscles and nerves tightened with each step. When he reached the\nlobby he was ready to jump sky-high at the drop of a pin.\n\nBut no one dropped any pins, and he reached the modernistic glass\ndoorway to the drugstore with only silence screaming in his ears. The\ndoor was unlocked. One hinge squeaked slightly as he pushed the door\ninward.\n\nIt was in the drugstore that Frank found signs of the fourth-floor\nintruder. An inside counter near the prescription department was red\nwith blood. Bandages and first-aid supplies had been unboxed and thrown\naround with abandon. Here the man had no doubt administered to his\nsmashed hand.\n\nBut where had he gone? Asleep, probably, in one of the rooms upstairs.\nFrank wished fervently for a weapon. Beyond doubt there was not a gun\nleft in the Loop.\n\nA gun was not the only weapon ever created, though, and Frank searched\nthe store and found a line of pocket knives still in neat boxes near the\nperfume counter.\n\nHe picked four of the largest and found, also, a wooden-handled,\nlead-tipped bludgeon, used evidently for cracking ice.\n\nThus armed, he went out through the revolving door. He walked through\nstreets that were like death under the climbing sun. Through streets and\ncanyons of dead buildings upon which the new daylight had failed to shed\nlife or diminish the terror of the night past.\n\nAt Dearborn he found the door to the Tribune Public Service Building\nlocked. He used the ice breaker to smash a glass door panel. The crash\nof the glass on the cement was an explosion in the screaming silence. He\nwent inside. Here the sense of desolation was complete; brought sharply\nto focus, probably, by the pigeon holes filled with letters behind the\nwant-ad counter. Answers to a thousand and one queries, waiting\npatiently for someone to come after them.\n\nBefore going to the basement and the back files of the Chicago Tribune,\nFrank climbed to the second floor and found what he thought might be\nthere--a row of teletype machines with a file-board hooked to the side\nof each machine.\n\nSwiftly, he stripped the copy sheets off each board, made a bundle of\nthem and went back downstairs. He covered the block back to the hotel at\na dog-trot, filled with a sudden urge to get back to the fourth floor as\nsoon as possible.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe stopped in the drugstore and filled his pockets with soap, a razor,\nshaving cream and face lotion. As an afterthought, he picked up a lavish\ncosmetic kit that retailed, according to the price tag, for thirty-eight\ndollars plus tax.\n\nHe let himself back into the room and closed the door softly. Nora\nrolled over, exposing a shoulder and one breast. The breast held his\ngaze for a full minute. Then a feeling of guilt swept him and he went\ninto the bathroom and closed the door.\n\nLuckily, a supply tank on the roof still contained water and Frank was\nable to shower and shave. Dressed again, he felt like a new man. But he\nregretted not hunting up a haberdashery shop and getting himself a clean\nshirt.\n\nNora had still not awakened when he came out of the bathroom. He went to\nthe bed and stood looking down at her for some time. Then he touched her\nshoulder.\n\n\"Wake up. It's morning.\"\n\nNora stirred. Her eyes opened, but Frank got the impression she did not\nreally awaken for several seconds. Her eyes went to his face, to the\nwindow, back to his face.\n\n\"What time is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I think it's around eight o'clock.\"\n\nNora stretched both arms luxuriously. As she sat up, her slip fell back\ninto place and Frank got the impression she hadn't even been aware of\nher partial nudity.\n\nShe stared up at him, clarity dawning in her eyes, \"You're all cleaned\nup.\"\n\n\"I went downstairs and got some things.\"\n\n\"You went out--alone?\"\n\n\"Why not. We can't stay in here all day. We've got to hit the road and\nget out of here. We've overshot our luck already.\"\n\n\"But that--that man in the hall last night! You shouldn't have taken a\nchance.\"\n\n\"I didn't bump into him. I found the place he fixed his hand, down in\nthe drugstore.\"\n\nFrank went to the table and came back with the cosmetic set. He put it\nin Nora's lap. \"I brought this up for you.\"\n\nSurprise and true pleasure were mixed in her expression. \"That was very\nnice. I think I'd better get dressed.\"\n\nFrank turned toward the window where he had left the bundle of teletype\nclips. \"I've got a little reading to do.\"\n\nAs he sat down, he saw, from the corner of his eye, a flash of slim\nbrown legs moving toward the bathroom. Just inside the door, Nora\nturned. \"Are Jim Wilson and Minna up yet?\"\n\n\"I don't think so.\"\n\nNora's eyes remained on him. \"I think you were very brave to go\ndownstairs alone. But it was a foolish thing to do. You should have\nwaited for Jim Wilson.\"\n\n\"You're right about it being foolish. But I had to go.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I'm not brave at all. Maybe that was the reason.\"\n\nNora left the bathroom door open about six inches and Frank heard the\nsound of the shower. He sat with the papers in his hand wondering about\nthe water. When he had gone to the bathroom the thought had never\noccurred to him. It was natural that it should. Now he wondered about\nit. Why was it still running? After a while he considered the\npossibility of the supply tank on the roof.\n\nThen he wondered about Nora. It was strange how he could think about her\npersonally and impersonally at the same time. He remembered her words of\nthe previous night. They made her--he shied from the term. What was the\nold cliche? A woman of easy virtue.\n\nWhat made a woman of that type, he wondered. Was it something inherent\nin their makeup? That partially opened door was symbolic somehow. He was\nsure that many wives closed the bathroom door upon their husbands; did\nit without thinking, instinctively. He was sure Nora had left it\npartially open without thinking. Could a behavior pattern be traced from\nsuch an insignificant thing?\n\nHe wondered about his own attitude toward Nora. He had drawn away from\nwhat she'd offered him during the night. And yet from no sense of\ndisgust. There was certainly far more about Nora to attract than to\nrepel.\n\nMorals, he realized dimly, were imposed--or at least functioned--for the\nprotection of society. With society gone--vanished overnight--did the\nmoral code still hold?\n\nIf and when they got back among masses of people, would his feelings\ntoward Nora change? He thought not. He would marry her, he told himself\nfirmly, as quick as he'd marry any other girl. He would not hold what\nshe was against her. I guess I'm just fundamentally unmoral myself, he\nthought, and began reading the news clips.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a knock on the door accompanied by the booming voice of Jim\nWilson. \"You in there! Ready for breakfast?\"\n\nFrank got up and walked toward the door. As he did so, the door to the\nbathroom closed.\n\nJim Wilson wore a two-day growth of beard and it didn't seem to bother\nhim at all. As he entered the room he rubbed his hands together in great\ngusto. \"Well, where'll we eat, folks? Let's pick the classiest\nrestaurant in town. Nothing but the best for Minna here.\"\n\nHe winked broadly as Minna, expressionless and silent, followed him in\nexactly as a shadow would have followed him and sat primly down in a\nstraight-backed chair by the wall.\n\n\"We'd better start moving south,\" Frank said, \"and not bother about\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\"Getting scared?\" Jim Wilson asked.\n\n\"You're damn right I'm scared--now. We're right in the middle of a big\nno-man's-land.\"\n\n\"I don't get you.\"\n\nAt that moment the bathroom door opened and Nora came out. Jim Wilson\nforgot about the question he'd asked. He let forth a loud whistle of\nappreciation. Then he turned his eyes on Frank and his thought was\ncrystal clear. He was envying Frank the night just passed.\n\nA sudden irritation welled up in Frank Brooks, a distinct feeling of\ndisgust. \"Let's start worrying about important things--our lives. Or\ndon't you consider your life very important?\"\n\nJim Wilson seemed puzzled. \"What the hell's got into you? Didn't you\nsleep good?\"\n\n\"I went down the block this morning and found some teletype machines.\nI've just been reading the reports.\"\n\n\"What about that guy that tried to get into your room last night?\"\n\n\"I didn't see him. I didn't see anybody. But I know why the city's been\ncleaned out.\" Frank went back to the window and picked up the sheaf on\nclips he had gone through. Jim Wilson sat down on the edge of the bed,\nfrowning. Nora followed Frank and perched on the edge of the chair he\ndropped into.\n\n\"The city going to blow up?\" Wilson asked.\n\n\"No. We've been invaded by some form of alien life.\"\n\n\"Is that what the papers said?\"\n\n\"It was the biggest and fastest mass evacuation ever attempted. I pieced\nthe reports together. There was hell popping around here during the two\ndays we--we waited it out.\"\n\n\"Where did they all go?\" Nora asked.\n\n\"South. They've evacuated a forty-mile strip from the lake west. The\nfirst Terran defense line is set up in northern Indiana.\"\n\n\"What do you mean--Terra.\"\n\n\"It's a word that means Earth--this planet. The invaders came from some\nother planet, they think--at least from no place on Earth.\"\n\n\"That's the silliest damn thing I ever heard of,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"A lot of people probably thought the same thing,\" Frank replied.\n\"Flying saucers were pretty common. Nobody thought they were anything\nand nobody paid much attention. Then they hit--three days ago--and wiped\nout every living soul in three little southern Michigan towns. From\nthere they began spreading out. They--\"\n\nEach of them heard the sound at the same time. A faint rumble,\nincreasing swiftly into high thunder. They moved as one to the window\nand saw four jet planes, in formation, moving across the sky from the\nsouth.\n\n\"There they come,\" Frank said. \"The fight's started. Up to now the army\nhas been trying to get set, I suppose.\"\n\nNora said, \"Is there any way we can hail them? Let them know--\"\n\nHer words were cut off by the horror of what happened. As they watched,\nthe plane skimmed low across the Loop. At a point, approximately over\nLake Street, Frank estimated, the planes were annihilated. There was a\nflash of blue fire coming in like jagged lightning to form four balls of\nfire around the planes. The fire balls turned, almost instantly, into\nglobes of white smoke that drifted lazily away.\n\nAnd that was all. But the planes vanished completely.\n\n\"What happened?\" Wilson muttered. \"Where'd they go?\"\n\n\"It was as if they hit a wall,\" Nora said, her voice hushed with awe.\n\n\"I think that _was_ what happened,\" Frank said. \"The invaders have some\nkind of a weapon that holds us helpless. Otherwise the army wouldn't\nhave established this no-man's-land and pulled out. The reports said we\nhave them surrounded on all sides with the help of the lake. We're\ntrying to keep them isolated.\"\n\nJim Wilson snorted. \"It looks like we've got them right where they want\nus.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, we're damn fools to stick around here. We'd better head south.\"\n\nWilson looked wistfully about the room. \"I guess so, but it's a\nshame--walking away from all this.\"\n\nNora was staring out the window, a small frown on her face. \"I wonder\nwho they are and where they came from?\"\n\n\"The teletype releases were pretty vague on that.\"\n\nShe turned quickly. \"There's something peculiar about them. Something\nreally strange.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Last night when we were walking up the street. It must have been these\ninvaders we heard. They must have been across the street. But they\ndidn't act like invaders. They seemed--well, scared. I got the feeling\nthey ran from us in panic. And they haven't been back.\"\n\nWilson said, \"They may not have been there at all. Probably our\nimaginations.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Frank cut in. \"They were there and then they were\ngone. I'm sure of it.\"\n\n\"Those wailing noises. They were certainly signalling to each other. Do\nyou suppose that's the only language they have?\" Nora walked over and\noffered the silent Minna a cigarette. Minna refused with a shake of her\nhead.\n\n\"I wish we knew what they looked like,\" Frank said. \"But let's not sit\nhere talking. Let's get going.\"\n\nJim Wilson was scowling. There was a marked sullenness in his manner.\n\"Not Minna and me. I've changed my mind. I'm sticking here.\"\n\nFrank blinked in surprise. \"Are you crazy? We've run our luck out\nalready. Did you see what happened to those planes?\"\n\n\"The hell with the planes. We've got it good here. This I like. I like\nit a lot. We'll stay.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Frank replied hotly, \"but talk for yourself. You're not making\nMinna stay!\"\n\nWilson's eyes narrowed. \"I'm not? Look, buster--how about minding your\nown goddam business?\"\n\nThe vague feelings of disgust Frank had had now crystallized into words.\n\"I won't let you get away with it! You think I'm blind? Hauling her into\nthe back room every ten minutes! Don't you think I know why? You're\nnothing but a damn sex maniac! You've got her terrorized until she's\nafraid to open her mouth. She goes with us!\"\n\nJim Wilson was on his feet. His face blazed with rage. The urge to kill\nwas written in the crouch of his body and the twist of his mouth. \"You\ngoddam nosey little squirt. I'll--\"\n\nWilson charged across the short, intervening distance. His arms went out\nin a clutching motion.\n\nBut Frank Brooks wasn't full of knockout drops this time, and with a\nclear head he was no pushover. Blinded with rage, Jim Wilson _was_ a\npushover. Frank stepped in between his outstretched arms and slugged him\nsquarely on top of the head with the telephone. Wilson went down like a\nfelled steer.\n\nThe scream came from Minna as she sprang across the room. She had turned\nfrom a colorless rag doll into a tigress. She hit Frank square in the\nbelly with small fists at the end of stiff, outstretched arms. The full\nforce of her charge was behind the fists, and Frank went backward over\nthe bed.\n\nMinna did not follow up her attack. She dropped to the floor beside Jim\nWilson and took his huge head in her lap. \"You killed him,\" she sobbed.\n\"You--you murderer! You killed him! You had no right!\"\n\nFrank sat wide-eyed. \"Minna! For God's sake! I was helping you. I did it\nfor you!\"\n\n\"Why don't you mind your business? I didn't ask you to protect me? I\ndon't need any protection--not from Jim.\"\n\n\"You mean you didn't mind the way he's treated you--\"\n\n\"You've killed him--killed him--\" Minna raised her head slowly. She\nlooked at Frank as though she saw him for the first time. \"You're a\nfool\" she said dully. \"A big fool. What right have you got to meddle\nwith other people's affairs? Are you God or something, to run people's\nlives?\"\n\n\"Minna--I--\"\n\nIt was as though he hadn't spoken. \"Do you know what it's like to have\nnobody? All your life to go on and grow older without anybody? I didn't\nhave no one and then Jim came along and wanted me.\"\n\nFrank walked close to her and bent down. She reacted like a tiger.\n\"Leave him alone! Leave him alone! You've done enough!\"\n\nNonplused, Frank backed away.\n\n\"People with big noses--always sticking them in. That's you. Was that\nany of your business what he wanted of me? Did I complain?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Minna. I didn't know.\"\n\n\"I'd rather go into back rooms with him than stay in front rooms without\nnobody.\"\n\nShe began to cry now. Wordlessly--soundlessly, rocking back and forth\nwith the huge man's bloody head in her lap. \"Anytime,\" she crooned.\n\"Anytime I would--\"\n\nThe body in her arms stirred. She looked down through her tears and saw\nthe small black eyes open. They were slightly crossed, unfocused as they\nwere by the force of the blow. They straightened and Jim mumbled, \"What\nthe hell--what the hell--\"\n\nMinna's time for talking seemed over. She smiled--a smile hardly\nperceptible, as though it was for herself alone. \"You're all right,\" she\nsaid. \"That's good. You're all right.\"\n\nJim pushed her roughly away and staggered to his feet. He stood swaying\nfor a moment, his head turning; for all the world like a bull blinded\nand tormented. Then his eyes focused on Frank.\n\n\"You hit me with the goddam phone.\"\n\n\"Yeah--I hit you.\"\n\n\"I'm gonna kill you.\"\n\n\"Look--I made a mistake.\" Frank picked up the phone and backed against\nthe wall. \"I hit you, but you were coming at me. I made a mistake and\nI'm sorry.\"\n\n\"I'll smash your goddam skull.\"\n\n\"Maybe you will,\" Frank said grimly. \"But you'll work for it. It won't\ncome easy.\"\n\nA new voice bit across the room. \"Cut it out. I'll do the killing.\nThat's what I like best. Everybody quiet down.\"\n\nThey turned and saw a slim, pale-skinned young man in the open doorway.\nThe door had opened quietly and no one had heard it. Now the pale young\nman was standing in the room with a small, nickle-plated revolver in his\nright hand.\n\nThe left hand was close down at his side. It was swathed generously in\nwhite bandage.\n\nThe young man chuckled. \"The last four people in the world were in a\nroom,\" he said, \"and there was a knock on the door.\"\n\nHis chuckle deepened to one of pure merriment. \"Only there wasn't a\nknock. A man just walked in with a gun that made him boss.\"\n\nNo one moved. No one spoke. The man waited, then went on: \"My name is\nLeroy Davis. I lived out west and I always had a keeper because they\nsaid I wasn't quite right. They wanted me to pull out with the rest of\nthem, but I slugged my keeper and here I am.\"\n\n\"Put down the gun and we'll talk it over,\" Frank said. \"We're all in\nthis together.\"\n\n\"No, we aren't. I've got a gun, so that makes me top man. You're all in\nit together, but I'm not. I'm the boss, and which one of you tried to\ncut my hand off last night.\"\n\n\"You tried to break in here yelling and screaming like a madman. I held\nthe door. What else could I do?\"\n\n\"It's all right. I'm not mad. My type--we may be nuts, but we never hold\na grudge. I can't remember much about last night. I found some whisky in\na place down the street and whisky drives me nuts. I don't know what I'm\ndoing when I drink whisky. They say once about five years ago I got\ndrunk and killed a little kid, but I don't remember.\"\n\nNobody spoke.\n\n\"I got out of it. They got me out some way. High priced lawyers got me\nout. Cost my dad a pile.\"\n\nHysteria had been piling up inside of Nora. She had held it back, but\nnow a little of it spurted out from between her set teeth. \"Do\nsomething, somebody. _Isn't anybody going to do anything?_\"\n\nLeroy Davis blinked at her. \"There's nothing they can do, honey,\" he\nsaid in a kindly voice. \"I've got the gun. They'd be crazy to try\nanything.\"\n\nNora's laugh was like the rattle of dry peas. She sat down on the bed\nand looked up at the ceiling and laughed. \"It's crazy. It's all so\ncrazy! We're sitting here in a doomed city with some kind of alien\ninvaders all around us and we don't know what they look like. They\nhaven't hurt us at all. We don't even know what they look like. We don't\nworry a bit about them because we're too busy trying to kill each\nother.\"\n\nFrank Brooks took Nora by the arm. \"Stop it! Quit laughing like that!\"\n\nNora shook him off. \"Maybe we need someone to take us over. It's all\npretty crazy!\"\n\n\"Stop it.\"\n\nNora's eyes dulled down as she looked at Frank. She dropped her head and\nseemed a little ashamed of herself. \"I'm sorry. I'll be quiet.\"\n\nJim Wilson had been standing by the wall looking first at the newcomer,\nthen back at Frank Brooks. Wilson seemed confused as to who his true\nenemy really was. Finally he took a step toward Leroy Davis.\n\nFrank Brooks stopped him with a motion, but kept his eyes on Davis.\n\"Have you seen anybody else?\"\n\nDavis regarded Frank with long, careful consideration. His eyes were\nbright and birdlike. They reminded Frank of a squirrel's eyes. Davis\nsaid, \"I bumped into an old man out on Halstead Street. He wanted to\nknow where everybody had gone. He asked me, but I didn't know.\"\n\n\"What happened to the old man?\" Nora asked. She asked the question as\nthough dreading to do it; but as though some compulsion forced her to\nspeak.\n\n\"I shot him,\" Davis said cheerfully. \"It was a favor, really. Here was\nthis old man staggering down the street with nothing but a lot of wasted\nyears to show for his efforts. He was no good alive, and he didn't have\nthe courage to die.\" Davis stopped and cocked his head brightly. \"You\nknow--I think that's what's been wrong with the world. Too many people\nwithout the guts to die, and a law against killing them.\"\n\nIt had now dawned upon Jim Wilson that they were faced by a maniac. His\neyes met those of Frank Brooks and they were--on this point at least--in\ncomplete agreement. A working procedure sprang up, unworded, between\nthem. Jim Wilson took a slow, casual step toward the homicidal maniac.\n\n\"You didn't see anyone else?\" Frank asked.\n\nDavis ignored the question. \"Look at it this way,\" he said. \"In the old\ndays they had Texas long horns. Thin stringy cattle that gave up meat as\ntough as leather. Do we have cattle like that today? No. Because we bred\nout the weak line.\"\n\nFrank said, \"There are some cigarettes on that table if you want one.\"\n\nJim Wilson took another slow step toward Davis.\n\nDavis said, \"We bred with intelligence, with a thought to what a steer\nwas for and we produced a walking chunk of meat as wide as it is long.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" Frank said.\n\n\"Get the point? See what I'm driving at? Humans are more important than\ncattle, but can we make them breed intelligently? Oh, no! That\ninterferes with damn silly human liberties. You can't tell a man he can\nonly have two kids. It's his God-given right to have twelve when the\ndamn moron can't support three. Get what I mean?\"\n\n\"Sure--sure, I get it.\"\n\n\"You better think it over, mister--and tell that fat bastard to quit\nsneaking up on me or I'll blow his brains all over the carpet!\"\n\nIf the situation hadn't been so grim it would have appeared ludicrous.\nJim Wilson, feeling success almost in his grasp, was balanced on tiptoe\nfor a lunge. He teetered, almost lost his balance and fell back against\nthe wall.\n\n\"Take it easy,\" Frank said.\n\n\"I'll take it easy,\" Davis replied. \"I'll kill every goddam one of\nyou--\" he pointed the gun at Jim Wilson \"--starting with him.\"\n\n\"Now wait a minute,\" Frank said. \"You're unreasonable. What right have\nyou got to do that? What about the law of survival? You're standing\nthere with a gun on us. You're going to kill us. Isn't it natural to try\nanything we can to save our own lives?\"\n\nA look of admiration brightened Davis' eyes. \"Say! I like you. You're\nall right. You're logical. A man can talk to you. If there's anything I\nlike it's talking to a logical man.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\"Too bad I'm going to have to kill you. We could sit down and have some\nnice long talks together.\"\n\n\"Why do you want to kill us?\" Minna asked. She had not spoken before. In\nfact, she had spoken so seldom during the entire time they'd been\ntogether that her voice was a novelty to Frank. He was inclined to\ndiscount her tirade on the floor with Wilson's head in her lap. She had\nbeen a different person then. Now she had lapsed back into her old\nshell.\n\nDavis regarded thoughtfully. \"Must you have a reason?\"\n\n\"You should have a reason to kill people.\"\n\nDavis said, \"All right, if it will make you any happier. I told you\nabout killing my keeper when they tried to make me leave town. He got in\nthe car, behind the wheel. I got into the back seat and split his skull\nwith a tire iron.\"\n\n\"What's that got to do with us?\"\n\n\"Just this. Tommy was a better person than anyone of you or all of you\nput together. If he had to die, what right have you got to live? Is that\nenough of a reason for you?\"\n\n\"This is all too damn crazy,\" Jim Wilson roared. He was on the point of\nleaping at Davis and his gun.\n\nAt that moment, from the north, came a sudden crescendo of the weird\ninvader wailings. It was louder than it had previously been but did not\nseem nearer.\n\nThe group froze, all ears trained upon the sound. \"They're talking\nagain,\" Nora whispered.\n\n\"Uh-huh,\" Frank replied. \"But it's different this time. As if--\"\n\n\"--as if they were getting ready for something,\" Nora said. \"Do you\nsuppose they're going to move south?\"\n\nDavis said, \"I'm not going to kill you here. We're going down stairs.\"\n\nThe pivotal moment, hinged in Jim Wilson's mind, that could have changed\nthe situation, had come and gone. The fine edge of additional madness\nthat would make a man hurl himself at a loaded gun, was dulled. Leroy\nDavis motioned pre-emptorily toward Minna.\n\n\"You first--then the other babe. You walk side by side down the hall\nwith the men behind you. Straight down to the lobby.\"\n\nThey complied without resistance. There was only Jim Wilson's scowl,\nFrank Brooks' clouded eyes, and the white, taut look of Nora.\n\nNora's mind was not on the gun. It was filled with thoughts of the pale\nmaniac who held it. He was in command. Instinctively, she felt that\nmaniacs in command have one of but two motivations--sex and murder. Her\nreaction to possible murder was secondary. But what if this man insisted\nupon laying his hands upon her. What if he forced her into the age old\nthing she had done so often? Nora shuddered. But it was also in her mind\nto question, and be surprised at the reason for her revulsion. She\nvisualized the hands upon her body--the old familiar things, and the\ntaste in her mouth was one of horror.\n\nShe had never experienced such shrinkings before. Why now. Had she\nherself changed? Had something happened during the night that made the\npast a time of shame? Or was it the madman himself? She did not know.\n\nNora returned from her musings to find herself standing in the empty\nlobby. Leroy Davis, speaking to Frank, was saying, \"You look kind of\ntricky to me. Put your hands on your head. Lock your fingers together\nover your head and keep your hands there.\"\n\nJim Wilson was standing close to the mute Minna. She had followed all\nthe orders without any show of anger, with no outward expression. Always\nshe had kept her eyes on Jim Wilson. Obviously, whatever Jim ordered,\nshe would have done without question.\n\nWilson leaned his head down toward her. He said, \"Listen, baby, there's\nsomething I keep meaning to ask but I always forget it. What's your last\nname?\"\n\n\"Trumble--Minna Trumble. I thought I told you.\"\n\n\"Maybe you did. Maybe I didn't get it.\"\n\nNora felt the hysteria welling again. \"How long are you going to keep\ndoing this?\" she asked.\n\nLeroy Davis cocked his head as he looked at her. \"Doing what?\"\n\n\"Play cat and mouse like this. Holding us on a pin like flies in an\nexhibit.\"\n\nLeroy Davis smiled brightly. \"Like a butterfly in your case, honey. A\nbig, beautiful butterfly.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do,\" Frank Brooks snapped. \"Whatever it is, let's\nget it over with?\"\n\n\"Can't you see what I'm doing?\" Davis asked with genuine wonder. \"Are\nyou that stupid? I'm being the boss. I'm in command and I like it. I\nhold life and death over four people and I'm savoring the thrill of it.\nYou're pretty stupid, mister, and if you use that 'can't get away with\nit' line, I'll put a bullet into your left ear and watch it come out\nyour right one.\"\n\nJim Wilson's fists were doubled. He was again approaching the reckless\npoint. And again it was dulled by the gradually increasing sound of a\nmotor--not in the air, but from the street level to the south.\n\nIt was a sane, cheerful sound and was resented instantly by the insane\nmind of Leroy Davis.\n\nHe tightened even to the point that his face grew more pale from the\ntension. He backed to a window, looked out quickly, and turned back.\n\"It's a jeep,\" he said. \"They're going by the hotel. If anybody makes a\nmove, or yells, they'll find four bodies in here and me gone. That's\nwhat I'm telling you and you know I'll do it.\"\n\nThey knew he _would_ do it and they stood silent, trying to dredge up\nthe nerve to make a move. The jeep's motor backfired a couple of times\nas it approached Madison Street. Each time, Leroy Davis' nerves reacted\nsharply and the four people kept their eyes trained on the gun in his\nhand.\n\nThe jeep came to the intersection and slowed down. There was a\nconference between its two occupants--helmeted soldiers in dark brown\nbattle dress. Then the jeep moved on up Clark Street toward Lake.\n\nA choked sigh escaped from Nora's throat. Frank Brooks turned toward\nher. \"Take it easy,\" he said. \"We're not dead yet. I don't think he\nwants to kill us.\"\n\nThe reply came from Minna. She spoke quietly. \"I don't care. I can't\nstand any more of this. After all, we aren't animals. We're human beings\nand we have a right to live and die as we please.\"\n\nMinna walked toward Leroy Davis. \"I'm not afraid of your gun any more.\nAll you can do with it is kill me. Go ahead and do it.\"\n\nMinna walked up to Leroy Davis. He gaped at her and said, \"You're crazy!\nGet back there. You're a crazy dame!\"\n\nHe fired the gun twice and Minna died appreciating the incongruity of\nhis words. She went out on a note of laughter and as she fell, Jim\nWilson, with an echoing animal roar, lunged at Leroy Davis. His great\nhand closed completely over that of Davis, hiding the gun. There was a\nmuffled explosion and the bullet cut unnoticed through Wilson's palm.\nWilson jerked the gun from Davis' weak grasp and hurled it away. Then he\nkilled Davis.\n\nHe did it slowly, a surprising thing for Wilson. He lifted Davis by his\nneck and held him with his feet off the floor. He squeezed Davis' neck,\nseeming to do it with great leisure as Davis made horrible noises and\nkicked his legs.\n\nNora turned her eyes away, buried them in Frank Brooks' shoulder, but\nshe could not keep the sounds from reaching her ears. Frank held her\nclose. \"Take it easy,\" he said. \"Take it easy.\" And he was probably not\nconscious of saying it.\n\n\"Tell him to hurry,\" Nora whispered. \"Tell him to get it over with. It's\nlike killing--killing an animal.\"\n\n\"That's what he is--an animal.\"\n\nFrank Brooks stared in fascination at Leroy Davis' distorted, darkening\nface. It was beyond semblance of anything human now. The eyes bulged and\nthe tongue came from his mouth as though frantically seeking relief.\n\nThe animal sounds quieted and died away. Nora heard the sound of the\nbody falling to the floor--a limp, soft sound of finality. She turned\nand saw Jim Wilson with his hands still extended and cupped. The\nterrible hands from which the stench of a terrible life was drifting\naway into empty air.\n\nWilson looked down at his handiwork. \"He's dead,\" Wilson said slowly. He\nturned to face Frank and Nora. There was a great disappointment in his\nface. \"That's all there is to it,\" he said, dully. \"He's just--dead.\"\nWithout knowing it for what it was, Jim Wilson was full of the futile\naftertaste of revenge.\n\nHe bent down to pick up Minna's body. There was a small blue hole in the\nright cheek and another one over the left eye. With a glance at Frank\nand Nora, Jim Wilson covered the wounds with his hand as though they\nwere not decent. He picked her up in his arms and walked across the\nlobby and up the stairs with the slow, quiet tread of a weary man.\n\nThe sound of the jeep welled up again, but it was further away now.\nFrank Brooks took Nora's hand and they hurried out into the street. As\nthey crossed the sidewalk, the sound of the jeep was drowned by a sudden\nswelling of the wailings to the northward.\n\nOn still a new note, they rose and fell on the still air. A note of\npanic, of new knowledge, it seemed, but Frank and Nora were not paying\nclose attention. The sounds of the jeep motor had come from the west and\nthey got within sight of the Madison-Well intersection in time to see\nthe jeep hurtle southward at its maximum speed.\n\nFrank yelled and waved his arms, but he knew he had been neither seen\nnor heard. They were given little time for disappointment however,\nbecause a new center of interest appeared to the northward. From around\nthe corner of Washington Street, into Clark, moved three strange\nfigures.\n\nThere was a mixture of belligerence and distress in their actions. They\ncarried odd looking weapons and seemed interested in using them upon\nsomething or someone, but they apparently lacked the energy to raise\nthem although they appeared to be rather light.\n\nThe creatures themselves were humanoid, Frank thought. He tightened his\ngrip on Nora's hand. \"They've seen us.\"\n\n\"Let's not run,\" Nora said. \"I'm tired of running. All it's gotten us is\ntrouble. Let's just stand here.\"\n\n\"Don't be foolish.\"\n\n\"I'm not running. You can if you want to.\"\n\nFrank turned his attention back to the three strange creatures. He\nallowed natural curiosity full reign. Thoughts of flight vanished from\nhis mind.\n\n\"They're so thin--so fragile,\" Nora said.\n\n\"But their weapons aren't.\"\n\n\"It's hard to believe, even seeing them, that they're from another\nplanet.\"\n\n\"How so? They certainly don't look much like us.\"\n\n\"I mean with the talk, for so long, about flying saucers and space\nflight and things like that. Here they are, but it doesn't seem\npossible.\"\n\n\"There's something wrong with them.\"\n\nThis was true. Two of the strange beings had fallen to the sidewalk. The\nthird came doggedly on, dragging one foot after the other until he went\nto his hands and knees. He remained motionless for a long time, his head\nhanging limply. Then he too, sank to the cement and lay still.\n\nThe wailings from the north now took on a tone of intense agony--great\ndesperation. After that came a yawning silence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"They defeated themselves,\" the military man said. \"Or rather, natural\nforces defeated them. We certainly had little to do with it.\"\n\nNora, Frank, and Jim Wilson stood at the curb beside a motorcycle. The\nman on the cycle supported it with a leg propped against the curb as he\ntalked.\n\n\"We saw three of them die up the street,\" Frank said.\n\n\"Our scouting party saw the same thing happen. That's why we moved in.\nIt's about over now. We'll know a lot more about them and where they\ncame from in twenty-four hours.\"\n\nThey had nothing further to say. The military man regarded them\nthoughtfully. \"I don't know about you three. If you ignored the\nevacuation through no fault of your own and can prove it--\"\n\n\"There were four of us,\" Jim Wilson said. \"Then we met another man. He's\ninside on the floor. I killed him.\"\n\n\"Murder?\" the military man said sharply.\n\n\"He killed a woman who was with us,\" Frank said. \"He was a maniac. When\nhe's identified I'm pretty sure he'll have a past record.\"\n\n\"Where is the woman's body?\"\n\n\"On a bed upstairs,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"I'll have to hold all of you. Martial law exists in this area. You're\nin the hands of the army.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe streets were full of people now, going about their business, pushing\nand jostling, eating in the restaurants, making electricity for the\nlights, generating power for the telephones.\n\nNora, Frank, and Jim Wilson sat in a restaurant on Clark Street. \"We're\nall different people now,\" Nora said. \"No one could go through what\nwe've been through and be the same.\"\n\nJim Wilson took her statement listlessly. \"Did they find out what it was\nabout our atmosphere that killed them?\"\n\n\"They're still working on that, I think.\" Frank Brooks stirred his\ncoffee, raised a spoonful and let it drip back into the cup.\n\n\"I'm going up to the Chicago Avenue police station,\" Wilson said.\n\nFrank and Nora looked up in surprise. Frank asked, \"Why? The military\ncourt missed it--the fact you escaped from jail.\"\n\n\"They didn't miss it I don't think. I don't think they cared much. I'm\ngoing back anyway.\"\n\n\"It won't be much of a rap.\"\n\n\"No, a pretty small one. I want to get it over with.\"\n\nHe got up from his chair. \"So long. Maybe I'll see you around.\"\n\n\"So long.\"\n\n\"Goodbye.\"\n\nFrank said, \"I think I'll beat it too. I've got a job in a factory up\nnorth. Maybe they're operating again.\" He got to his feet and stood\nawkwardly by the table. \"Besides--I've got some pay coming.\"\n\nNora didn't say anything.\n\nFrank said, \"Well--so long. Maybe I'll see you around.\"\n\n\"Maybe. Goodbye.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrank Brooks walked north on Clark Street. He was glad to get away from\nthe restaurant. Nora was a good kid but hell--you didn't take up with a\nhooker. A guy played around, but you didn't stick with them.\n\nBut it made a guy think. He was past the kid stage. It was time for him\nto find a girl and settle down. A guy didn't want to knock around all\nhis life.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nNora walked west on Madison Street. Then she remembered the Halstead\nStreet slums were in that direction and turned south on Wells. She had\nnine dollars in her bag and that worried her. You couldn't get along on\nnine dollars in Chicago very long.\n\nThere was a tavern on Jackson near Wells. Nora went inside. The barkeep\ndidn't frown at her. That was good. She went to the bar and ordered a\nbeer and was served.\n\nAfter a while a man came in. A middle aged man who might have just come\ninto Chicago--whose bags might still be at the LaSalle Street Station\ndown the block. The man looked at Nora, then away. After a while looked\nat her again.\n\nNora smiled.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Deadly City, by Paul W.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n"}
